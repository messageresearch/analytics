[1:01:36] Brothers I want to control myself
[1:01:38] because I feel like I'm want to
[1:01:44] jump the first time that I searched the
[1:01:47] word trash in the
[1:01:50] message the first time the prophet
[1:01:52] speaks about
[1:01:53] trash
[1:01:56] have you ever been interested in that
[1:01:57] word
[1:01:58] trash even the prophet he speaks about
[1:02:04] trash and the first time he speaks about
[1:02:08] trash is when his mother in-law Hope's
[1:02:13] mother she said don't you
[1:02:15] dare take my daughter with that
[1:02:21] trash those Pentecostals
[1:02:26] don't you dare to take my daughter with
[1:02:29] that
[1:02:35] trash and for the world we're just
[1:02:38] trash when the
[1:02:40] prophet once the flood
[1:02:42] came and then he was there in his
[1:02:45] boat and he tried to crank the
[1:02:48] motor and it didn't want to
[1:02:51] crank he said Lord if you get me out of
[1:02:53] here
[1:02:54] I will
[1:02:55] never think that those people are
[1:03:07] trash we should never think that the
[1:03:09] people are
[1:03:11] trash the prophet said I
[1:03:14] noticed the cream of the crop in English
[1:03:17] it says the phrase the cream of the
[1:03:20] crop the cream of the
[1:03:22] crop the the the the the good ones the
[1:03:27] good they're the elite the
[1:03:31] best let's read what the prophet
[1:03:36] says I thought what does the sea jump
[1:03:38] like that
[1:03:41] for well there comes a mighty rushing
[1:03:46] wind and that causes a
[1:03:49] Revival well
[1:03:52] brothers so what what is A Mighty
[1:03:55] Wind as you're
[1:04:00] walking there there's many uh those
[1:04:02] Mighty winds that come that uh scatter
[1:04:05] dust and then sometimes you're just
[1:04:08] walking and A Mighty Wind
[1:04:11] comes it it's it's good it feels
[1:04:16] good it almost knocks you
[1:04:18] over
[1:04:20] right it stumbles you almost knocks you
[1:04:23] down
[1:04:25] a mighty rushing
[1:04:27] wind now I want you to follow me because
[1:04:30] I'm getting
[1:04:33] somewhere it says the same amount of
[1:04:35] water that's
[1:04:37] right but it's got a
[1:04:39] Revival what does it
[1:04:43] do it it throw floats all the trash up
[1:04:48] on the
[1:04:49] shore we
[1:04:52] need a scoring out
[1:04:55] once in a
[1:04:56] while oh amen
[1:05:01] amen once in a
[1:05:03] while we
[1:05:05] need a cleaning or a scoring out to take
[1:05:09] out all that
[1:05:12] trash from the trash from my natural
[1:05:15] home my spiritual home my mind my spirit
[1:05:21] my
[1:05:23] soul
[1:05:24] the trash starts to
[1:05:28] accumulate so that's why God sends a
[1:05:31] Revival to cleanse us once in a
[1:05:40] while God gives us a
[1:05:45] Revival and a sweeping Mighty Wind that
[1:05:47] rushes
[1:05:51] down down through the church like that
[1:05:55] like
[1:05:57] that and floats all the trash out of us
[1:06:02] out of
[1:06:03] us God purifies Us by the Holy
[1:06:09] Spirit like our brother Eli told us on
[1:06:12] Friday the holy spirit that
[1:06:15] began and the Holy Spirit that will
[1:06:18] finish the
[1:06:19] work it doesn't matter what level you're
[1:06:22] on it's the Holy Ghost
[1:06:28] God purifies Us by the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost the wind that comes from Heaven
[1:06:35] that shakes your
[1:06:38] soul not your body but it's your
[1:06:42] soul the the body will be
[1:06:45] dying but your
[1:06:49] soul when you can have a differences
[1:06:51] with your
[1:06:52] brother but your
[1:06:54] soul you still love
[1:06:59] him what we need is not bodily
[1:07:02] healing it's the soul
[1:07:07] healing if you can't see your brother
[1:07:09] and greet him with the genuine
[1:07:11] smile then something's wrong with my
[1:07:15] experience I want to be
[1:07:17] bride I want to be like Jesus
[1:07:20] Christ brother Billy Paul says I
[1:07:25] never could see the
[1:07:27] differences between my father's enemies
[1:07:31] and my father's
[1:07:32] friends because my
[1:07:35] father he acts the same with
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:39] everybody he doesn't make differences of
[1:07:43] nobody I'd like to be like
[1:07:48] him Prophet says he sweeps
[1:07:51] you sweeping you with the uh like with
[1:07:54] the
[1:07:57] broom you're still the same
[1:08:01] creature but you got scored
[1:08:04] out when we're here in the
[1:08:07] service and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:08:11] down you think about receiving from God
[1:08:14] and then you receive you start to cry
[1:08:17] you raise your
[1:08:21] hands and how does the prophet say how
[1:08:23] do we know when we're Born
[1:08:24] Again by your fruits by your
[1:08:29] life you take the word
[1:08:32] out and your life will
[1:08:34] demonstrate you've been born
[1:08:37] again
[1:08:39] Prophet that this revival
[1:08:42] comes it scorns you out and it it takes
[1:08:45] out the
[1:08:46] trash but we're the same
[1:08:50] creature now don't forget about that
[1:08:52] quote we're getting to
[1:08:55] something I don't want to be the same
[1:08:58] creature I want to be a new creature in
[1:09:00] Christ
[1:09:01] Jesus I don't want to just be
[1:09:04] cleansed I want to be a new
[1:09:07] creature amen
[1:09:10] Brothers I believe that that should be
[1:09:11] our
[1:09:16] prayer in English he uses the word scorn
[1:09:21] out what the prophet just said that he
[1:09:26] clean in in English it means to be
[1:09:29] polished to be
[1:09:31] cleansed this revival comes and starts
[1:09:34] to polish
[1:09:35] you but yet you're still the same person
[1:09:39] the same
[1:09:41] creature I was a I was a
[1:09:44] hog he takes a hog you I clean it I I I
[1:09:48] I shine
[1:09:50] it and give it a Revival so that I can
[1:09:52] shine it up
[1:09:54] I put a little bow on
[1:09:56] it but then by its
[1:09:59] nature it goes back to the
[1:10:01] mud by its
[1:10:04] nature I can't blame it I can't crucify
[1:10:07] it it's it's a
[1:10:10] hog but once it's an
[1:10:12] eagle he's in the heavens
[1:10:17] flying the prophet
[1:10:21] says El presy and you idolize these
[1:10:25] Idols of these Elvis presence and so
[1:10:29] forth and you permit that stuff to enter
[1:10:32] into your

[1:11:40] house we need to clean our
[1:11:44] house the music we listen
[1:11:48] to that causes an effect in our
[1:11:51] lives what do we see what do we listen

[1:12:32] short you men throw out them
[1:12:35] cigarettes and women
[1:12:40] too get out all the old stuff out of
[1:12:42] this system here that's called the
[1:12:45] world if you love the world or the
[1:12:48] things of the
[1:12:51] world is because the love of God is not
[1:12:53] even in
[1:12:56] you and when you're ready to apply the
[1:12:59] token and then empty up get ready for
[1:13:04] it to receive the Holy
[1:13:07] Ghost we've got to cleanse ourselves get

[1:13:14] God you've got to empty out and get
[1:13:18] ready to receive the Holy
[1:13:21] Ghost Prophet says
[1:13:25] when a little Eagle
[1:13:27] drops the
[1:13:32] mother she went right down picked him up
[1:13:34] and brought him right
[1:13:36] back and if you're an
[1:13:39] eagle you'll do the same
[1:13:43] way by a fallen child of
[1:13:46] God even if he's
[1:13:49] wrong how many can say Amen up to that
[1:13:52] point
[1:13:54] if the the brother is
[1:13:58] mistaken even the mother Eagle will go
[1:14:00] to
[1:14:01] him and if we're
[1:14:04] Eagles we'll do the same thing for a
[1:14:07] fallen Son of
[1:14:10] God if he got out of
[1:14:13] cater and got out of the
[1:14:15] scripture and got Topsy
[1:14:18] turby go to
[1:14:21] him that's what the thing you need to do
[1:14:24] then
[1:14:27] God all men will know you're my
[1:14:31] disciples when you've got love one for
[1:14:38] another when will the World know that
[1:14:39] we're Jesus's
[1:14:41] disciples when we've got
[1:14:44] love for one and for the other what's a
[1:14:49] disciple one that follows Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ now the whole
[1:14:54] world says and prophesies to be
[1:14:59] Christians rock and roll even the rock
[1:15:02] and roll
[1:15:03] artists they say that they're
[1:15:06] Christians and then they all with their
[1:15:09] makeup but I said that's
[1:15:12] tremendous because even the Devils
[1:15:14] believe and
[1:15:17] prophesy that Jesus Christ is
[1:15:22] King
[1:15:24] but how will the people know we're true
[1:15:25] Disciples of Jesus
[1:15:28] Christ that's when you and I love one
[1:15:33] another when you and I love each other
[1:15:35] with a genuine love we can talk about
[1:15:38] the
[1:15:39] Rapture the resurrection of the dead of
[1:15:43] the Prophet the third pole the the
[1:15:47] tent I can speak about all of that bring
[1:15:52] quotes but then if you and I don't love
[1:15:55] one
[1:15:56] another if you will never we'll never
[1:15:59] see
[1:16:02] him amen
[1:16:06] Brothers The Prophet's going to come
[1:16:08] back and the third
[1:16:11] pole I say
[1:16:15] Amen but if we can't love one another
[1:16:19] never will we get to the
[1:16:22] rapture
[1:16:24] do we love one another
[1:16:26] Brothers do we love one
[1:16:31] another and the
[1:16:34] world is so thirsty for
[1:16:37] that
[1:16:39] amen they're thirsting for
[1:16:42] love notice what the prophet
[1:16:45] says the world so thirsty for
[1:16:49] that for a
[1:16:52] friend
[1:16:56] you have a
[1:16:58] friend and that friend is Jesus
[1:17:03] Christ and it's Jesus Christ made
[1:17:08] flesh that flesh is
[1:17:13] me I am your
[1:17:15] friend of every one of
[1:17:18] you it's Jesus Christ in me made flesh
[1:17:24] it's Jesus Christ in him made flesh it's
[1:17:28] your friend your
[1:17:31] friend that's tremendous
[1:17:33] right Jesus Christ is my
[1:17:35] friend but he's a
[1:17:38] spirit and he needs flesh that flesh
[1:17:42] it's you it's
[1:17:45] me the world it's thirsty for a
[1:17:50] friend that friend it's Jesus Christ
[1:17:54] through his
[1:17:56] bride and God is
[1:18:00] love and until we can until we can get
[1:18:03] Brotherly
[1:18:05] Love we'll never get very far with
[1:18:11] God God is
[1:18:15] love until we can get that brotherly
[1:18:18] love will
[1:18:21] never get very part with
[1:18:25] God we
[1:18:28] need a
[1:18:30] Revival of
[1:18:32] Love amongst the children of
[1:18:36] God we need a
[1:18:38] Revival of
[1:18:40] Love amongst the children of
[1:18:43] God it doesn't matter what
[1:18:46] happens it doesn't matter what's going
[1:18:49] on the devil wants
[1:18:51] to he wants to destroy
[1:18:54] but when there's
[1:18:57] love the devil can't get
[1:19:00] in and with with the pyramids of
[1:19:04] Egypt they're so fine and
[1:19:08] together those stones are so stuck
[1:19:11] together a razor blade can't even get in
[1:19:14] between that's how every one of us
[1:19:16] should be a
[1:19:19] pyramid but very stuck
[1:19:21] together
[1:19:24] can penetrate and get among in between
[1:19:26] us that when the spirit
[1:19:29] comes that wants to go against my
[1:19:31] brother my sister it can't get
[1:19:35] in there's a Revival of
[1:19:38] love in between the children of
[1:19:42] God Prophet
[1:19:45] says you see a road is
[1:19:51] built a good road is built the highest
[1:19:54] part is in the
[1:19:57] center it allows all the
[1:20:00] traps wash off both sides that's
[1:20:05] it when a man really comes to
[1:20:09] Christ he's got his eyes centered on the
[1:20:14] church he's got his eyes centered on the
[1:20:20] go he's got his eyes centered on
[1:20:22] everything
[1:20:23] else what does it say Brothers I think I
[1:20:26] need glasses here what does it
[1:20:30] say he's got his eyes centered
[1:20:33] centered on
[1:20:37] Christ not on the church not on the
[1:20:41] pastor not on the associate
[1:20:43] pastor no other
[1:20:46] person only to Jesus
[1:20:49] Christ amen
[1:20:51] Brothers we're on a road the prophet
[1:20:55] says and the road is made at the highest
[1:20:58] point so that the track can fall on both
[1:21:05] sides and the trash goes down to my left
[1:21:07] and to the right but
[1:21:10] man he's got his eyes fixed on Jesus
[1:21:14] Christ on the Destiny on the
[1:21:19] Rapture what's going to come it
[1:21:24] says if he's a little bit
[1:21:27] emotional he'll be a
[1:21:30] fanatic goes a little bit to the right
[1:21:32] he's a
[1:21:34] fanatic if he's a little bit
[1:21:38] cold he'll be on this other side and
[1:21:40] he'll be just a
[1:21:43] cucumber and his
[1:21:46] intellectual but the main
[1:21:50] thing is right in the middle of the
[1:21:55] road with enough spirit in
[1:21:58] you to keep you warm
[1:22:04] and
[1:22:06] moving oh
[1:22:09] Brothers there's a very important key
[1:22:11] right there to be
[1:22:14] warm and always be moving or in
[1:22:18] action to always be doing something for
[1:22:20] Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ always
[1:22:23] something help with something be in
[1:22:27] action because if you don't get into
[1:22:29] action you're going to get
[1:22:31] cold you don't want to do
[1:22:35] anything and then the evil spirit comes
[1:22:38] in when you start to get
[1:22:41] cold but when you're nice and
[1:22:43] warm and you're in
[1:22:46] action doing something for
[1:22:49] Christ then the devil can't move you
[1:22:52] amen the prophet says
[1:22:55] amen and knowing
[1:22:57] enough to keep
[1:23:00] yourself then it is
[1:23:03] necessary for you to know the message
[1:23:06] know your
[1:23:09] Bible you should know enough to keep
[1:23:12] yourself because spirits will
[1:23:15] come to get you out of the
[1:23:18] word but you know enough
[1:23:21] word to keep
[1:23:24] yourself and when you've got no
[1:23:26] doubt you don't know where to go you got
[1:23:29] a
[1:23:30] question that's why we've got a pastor
[1:23:33] to go to
[1:23:34] him I don't know the answer to this
[1:23:40] says to move just as the spirit
[1:23:43] moves not till not
[1:23:48] after just as the spirit
[1:23:51] moves you love the Lord
[1:23:54] Brothers Prophet
[1:23:58] says and there'll never be any
[1:24:01] benefit until every
[1:24:04] person that profess to be a
[1:24:08] Christian will forget his own
[1:24:11] ability and yield himself to
[1:24:13] God then
[1:24:16] God can achieve his
[1:24:19] purpose when you and I we surrender
[1:24:24] our
[1:24:25] ability what we know we surrender to
[1:24:32] God until I can
[1:24:34] say I can't do anything I'm
[1:24:38] nothing that's why problems come in our
[1:24:42] lives problems to Humble
[1:24:47] us sometimes we think I'm at the highest
[1:24:50] point of the mountain but then when a
[1:24:52] problem
[1:24:54] comes then I notice I'm
[1:24:57] nothing the prophet says that
[1:25:00] happens to to shake us
[1:25:06] up then the prophet says then God will
[1:25:08] fulfill his
[1:25:10] purpose
[1:25:13] sending not a
[1:25:16] Revival but then
[1:25:19] brother you just said that we need a
[1:25:21] Revival
[1:25:23] to take out the trash that's inside of
[1:25:25] us now the prophet is telling
[1:25:28] us it's not a
[1:25:30] Revival Prophet
[1:25:32] says
[1:25:35] brother what he needs to do
[1:25:38] first it send a
[1:25:41] killing the prophet says that's
[1:25:44] right so we can
[1:25:47] revive you have to
[1:25:50] die before you can be born born
[1:25:55] again he needs a killing of
[1:25:59] ourselves remember the first
[1:26:02] quote when a Revival comes it it
[1:26:05] polishes it cleans
[1:26:08] us but we're the same
[1:26:10] creature the same
[1:26:13] person that Revival is just
[1:26:16] polishing but first we
[1:26:19] need is a
[1:26:21] killing we need to
[1:26:24] die we need to die to our own
[1:26:26] thoughts our own
[1:26:28] ideas what we want our
[1:26:33] desires the the prophet says it's not a
[1:26:36] Revival first it's a
[1:26:39] killing because a
[1:26:41] Revival what does a Revival mean it
[1:26:44] means to
[1:26:45] revive what we've
[1:26:48] already to bring back unto
[1:26:51] life
[1:26:53] so to bring us back unto life we've got
[1:26:56] to
[1:26:57] die we've got to be dead of this
[1:27:01] flesh the prophet
[1:27:04] saids you have to
[1:27:07] die in order to be born
[1:27:11] again this
[1:27:13] Tabernacle
[1:27:15] needs a
[1:27:19] killing the prophet didn't say brandom
[1:27:23] he said
[1:27:24] this this
[1:27:28] Tabernacle I say this Tabernacle it
[1:27:31] needs a
[1:27:34] killing including myself me that's what
[1:27:38] the prophet
[1:27:39] says this
[1:27:42] Tabernacle from top to bottom it needs a
[1:27:46] killing to
[1:27:48] die to die to
[1:27:50] ourselves includ
[1:27:53] myself we all need a
[1:27:57] killing to be
[1:28:00] revived in a new
[1:28:02] life A New
[1:28:04] Hope A New Hope a new
[1:28:10] experience we need first a day of
[1:28:13] mourning the first
[1:28:17] quote we have to clean ourselves polish
[1:28:20] ourselves but this quote
[1:28:24] we need to
[1:28:25] die that's why we're the same
[1:28:28] person that's why we can't over our
[1:28:31] character
[1:28:34] ourselves the prophet says our worst
[1:28:38] enemy it's not the brother nor is it the
[1:28:42] devil it's
[1:28:46] myself and when you achieve to
[1:28:51] die and then you lift your
[1:28:54] hands and the Revival
[1:28:57] comes that Mighty rushing wind
[1:29:01] comes you get up not as the same
[1:29:04] creature but as a new
[1:29:07] creature in Christ
[1:29:10] Jesus but you first of
[1:29:12] all you need a
[1:29:15] killing the prophet says this
[1:29:18] Tabernacle it needs a
[1:29:20] killing including
[1:29:25] myself the prophet
[1:29:27] says I know that I'm reading many quotes
[1:29:31] it
[1:29:33] says how much do you really mean
[1:29:37] it Prophet says don't play

[1:32:33] the gate to the
[1:32:38] spirit that's why the
[1:32:42] spirit there's sicknesses in the spirit
[1:32:45] when there's
[1:32:46] trash there's
[1:32:49] Spirits that's why we got to throw out
[1:32:51] the
[1:32:52] trash in the natural just like in the

[1:33:57] love to love my bitterest enemy the
[1:34:00] brother that offended the sister that
[1:34:02] offended me oh
[1:34:06] Lord many times it's not even like that
[1:34:09] it's the mind that's play tricks in our
[1:34:12] mind that you
[1:34:14] think you've got something against your
[1:34:16] brother but it's the devil just playing
[1:34:19] with your mind
[1:34:22] we've got to say
[1:34:23] Lord I just want to throw the trash out
[1:34:26] that's in my
[1:34:28] mind I want to take out the trash I want
[1:34:31] to love my
[1:34:36] brother and now I'm about to be
[1:34:39] closing the prophet
[1:34:41] says
[1:34:45] we we hear this cry on the radio and in
[1:34:47] different
[1:34:50] places and coming from sincere
[1:34:55] hearts Lord give us a Revival in our
[1:34:59] time oh amen
[1:35:02] amen I
[1:35:04] remember when I was a little
[1:35:07] younger we had
[1:35:11] Services uh
[1:35:13] wonderful Supernatural
[1:35:16] ones I believe there's many Elders
[1:35:19] here that can tell talk about the the
[1:35:21] Miracles the Wonders over there in
[1:35:23] Filmore I remember being in
[1:35:27] church on a
[1:35:30] Wednesday it didn't matter who was the
[1:35:32] pre just a simple
[1:35:35] message and the altar was full of
[1:35:38] people and people would
[1:35:41] dismiss but there'll be 15 20 people at
[1:35:43] the altar people already
[1:35:47] left an hour after service is
[1:35:50] over and me even being
[1:35:53] there crying out no
[1:35:57] music no nothing going on in the service
[1:36:00] and then
[1:36:02] suddenly a supernatural Wind
[1:36:05] come God is my
[1:36:08] witness you could hear a
[1:36:12] wind and it swept everyone to The
[1:36:17] Altar and people were squirming around
[1:36:19] like a w that's
[1:36:22] Supernatural after a
[1:36:25] service that's a
[1:36:27] Revival oh
[1:36:29] Brothers not what we need we need a
[1:36:34] killing to go back to those times of a
[1:36:39] Revival because the
[1:36:41] bride is getting
[1:36:43] ready when I saw that man when there was
[1:36:46] a
[1:36:49] man the prophet said where's that
[1:36:51] Revival
[1:36:52] LA and then there was a
[1:36:55] policeman that he was swinging his
[1:36:59] keys sir can you help me find that
[1:37:02] Revival he said yes you're looking at
[1:37:06] it I am the
[1:37:10] Revival and that should be
[1:37:13] us I should be that
[1:37:16] Revival you should be that
[1:37:19] Revival to get so close
[1:37:23] it doesn't matter what's happening in
[1:37:25] church whatever is happening in the
[1:37:28] world there should be a Revival in
[1:37:31] you it doesn't matter what's
[1:37:34] happening you're hearing
[1:37:37] you You' got your eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:37:41] no matter what
[1:37:43] comes I am the
[1:37:47] Revival Lord give us a Revival in our
[1:37:50] time
[1:37:53] and from letters and Christians around
[1:37:54] the
[1:37:55] world we hear that
[1:38:01] cry it does something to your heart it's
[1:38:03] inspiring it's uplifting it's quickening
[1:38:08] to the
[1:38:10] soul toar hear the people of the Lord
[1:38:13] call for a
[1:38:16] Revival and God has made us a
[1:38:19] promise if the people
[1:38:23] that are called by my
[1:38:25] name shall assemble themselves and
[1:38:30] pray then I'll hear from
[1:38:34] heaven and so we
[1:38:38] tonight we want to think on that and
[1:38:43] remember in the midst of all this
[1:38:46] cry
[1:38:49] God cannot send a
[1:38:53] Revival till he's got
[1:38:57] men in
[1:38:59] shape to take
[1:39:02] it there's got to be
[1:39:04] men men
[1:39:07] fearlessly men in shape to
[1:39:11] receive that
[1:39:15] Revival God cannot send a
[1:39:18] Revival until he has men
[1:39:21] in
[1:39:22] cons to take
[1:39:25] it we cannot have a
[1:39:28] Revival until we get
[1:39:31] men God called
[1:39:34] men God trained
[1:39:39] men that's not trained up in schools of
[1:39:42] Theology and
[1:39:45] education but rugged men of
[1:39:50] faith
[1:39:52] that God has brought up in the school of
[1:39:53] his rugged
[1:39:56] train men who are not afraid to face the
[1:40:00] fire man who has come in the presence of
[1:40:04] God and knows his
[1:40:07] power and knows his
[1:40:10] omnipotence and knows his healing
[1:40:12] power some
[1:40:14] men that's
[1:40:17] trained to know the Living God
[1:40:24] it's right to train them by the word but
[1:40:27] the letter kill
[1:40:28] it the spirit giveth
[1:40:30] life and
[1:40:33] before we can have this
[1:40:36] revival God has to call out and train
[1:40:41] men God trained
[1:40:44] men to carry this
[1:40:49] message and they don't care what the
[1:40:51] opposition
[1:40:53] is they're willing to go to the fiery
[1:40:56] furnace in
[1:40:58] defeat or to the Lions do or wherever it
[1:41:02] might be they're ready to go to
[1:41:07] go because they've been in the presence
[1:41:09] of
[1:41:10] God and they know what he
[1:41:13] is whether it's to Victory or
[1:41:18] defeat they still stand the same
[1:41:24] that's the kind of training God does to
[1:41:27] men it's very strange to think that God
[1:41:30] would do
[1:41:31] that that God trains his men like
[1:41:35] that but he does
[1:41:38] it how many of you believe
[1:41:42] that that before God can send us a
[1:41:44] Revival there's got to be
[1:41:47] men rugged men of faith it doesn't
[1:41:50] matter what come but those men have
[1:41:54] entered in God's presence it doesn't
[1:41:58] matter if they go to the furnace to the
[1:42:01] Lion's
[1:42:02] Den they're not
[1:42:05] afraid to
[1:42:07] go to save the
[1:42:10] souls God trained
[1:42:13] men that they're in their post of
[1:42:15] doing that take this
[1:42:18] word and when the Revival comes
[1:42:23] these men they're ready to grab that
[1:42:27] Revival so the revival can stay with
[1:42:31] us God cannot send
[1:42:33] them if if there's not men that are
[1:42:37] ready ready to take that
[1:42:40] Revival men that are
[1:42:43] ready I ask the question unto the men
[1:42:46] are you
[1:42:48] ready men with courage
[1:42:51] to take the
[1:42:53] Revival to grab and take that
[1:42:57] Revival please stand
[1:43:02] brothers that
[1:43:05] Revival is to take out all the
[1:43:07] trash that's in our
[1:43:10] mind that we've got in our spiritual
[1:43:18] homes I don't know if you remember
[1:43:22] when the
[1:43:24] prophet when he spoke to the little
[1:43:27] fish the prophet says like
[1:43:32] this now I looked at this little
[1:43:35] fish the prophet was
[1:43:38] fishing and he was there in the midst of
[1:43:40] many
[1:43:41] brothers there was a little
[1:43:47] fish with his gills all turned inside
[1:43:50] out of that fish
[1:43:51] fish and what is a
[1:43:54] fish a fish is you and
[1:44:00] I you remember when Jesus encountered
[1:44:03] Peter and Peter he was a
[1:44:07] fisherman said I'm no longer going to
[1:44:08] make you a fisherman of
[1:44:11] fish but a fisherman of
[1:44:15] men so then the little fish that that's
[1:44:19] you and I
[1:44:22] the prophet saw that this little
[1:44:27] fish with his little belly coming out of
[1:44:30] his
[1:44:31] mouth and the prophet says he saw
[1:44:34] him upon the
[1:44:38] trash this little fish you and
[1:44:43] I with everything came out
[1:44:45] of no hope for
[1:44:48] us they've been cast out out thr away
[1:44:52] they threw you away you're good for
[1:44:57] nothing your organs have come out of you
[1:44:59] you're in the
[1:45:00] church but the prophet was there the
[1:45:03] prophet was there the prophet
[1:45:07] says I was sitting there looking at that
[1:45:09] little
[1:45:13] fish laying back in the trash there on
[1:45:15] the
[1:45:17] water it been dead for some half hour
[1:45:21] his little belly out of its
[1:45:24] mouth his gills had done turned
[1:45:26] white and I was fishing
[1:45:30] there now this can seem
[1:45:34] fiction but the truth is more Stranger
[1:45:36] Than
[1:45:38] Fiction and as I looked at this little
[1:45:44] fellow just then coming down the hollow
[1:45:48] in the
[1:45:49] mountains
[1:45:51] I heard like a
[1:45:55] wind and it comes swooping
[1:45:59] down all of a sudden it covered me
[1:46:03] over and i' just been talking on this
[1:46:06] scripture and just then something said
[1:46:09] to
[1:46:10] me call for that little
[1:46:14] fish and brother Banks said what's the
[1:46:18] matter brother brand you're white
[1:46:21] and I
[1:46:22] said the prophet said little
[1:46:26] fishy your
[1:46:28] creator Jesus Christ makes you
[1:46:33] alive this little
[1:46:35] fish which is
[1:46:37] you typifies that it is
[1:46:40] you there was no hope for that fish he
[1:46:44] was in the
[1:46:47] trash but the prophet was there
[1:46:52] and a Revival wind
[1:46:54] came and the spirit told him speak to it
[1:46:59] to that little fish and if in this
[1:47:02] morning you

[1:47:14] trash let me tell
