[57:37] come particu stairs a few of the
[57:39] experience that I had with the Prophet
[57:40] most experienced most young people want
[57:44] to know each other was over these
[57:47] kiddies of it what was it like being
[57:49] around brother branham go away and I
[57:51] started to let my brother in one way in
[57:56] nomine he was the same where there is in
[57:59] the pulpit or out there lemis knows he's
[58:03] done it but in another way he was
[58:08] different
[58:09] it literally fit anything one time I was
[58:11] across a campfire up at the sunset
[58:13] mountain you and it was when he was
[58:19] preaching some pretty hard things right
[58:21] here in Phoenix about education and
[58:27] things you know what he said about very
[58:29] Llyod ocasion because the second awesome
[58:32] locale this year and he was talking
[58:36] about people with PhDs and all their
[58:38] degrees and studying
[58:44] and also he kind of got onto the women
[58:48] he tambien him for Pentecost which I was
[58:53] raised in in Pentecost and while human
[58:55] created so there's nothing new to me nor
[58:57] another new para me women with long hair
[59:00] nothing good is gonna be a lot of long
[59:01] dresses los vestidos largos
[59:04] in other words what I called a Christian
[59:06] woman I'm almost stadium 79 car seat
[59:11] angle agenda Austin was attending women
[59:14] I remember
[59:15] yo man recuerdo the first time I seen a
[59:17] woman in shorts la primera vez que yo
[59:20] unum I was probably 10 or 12 years old
[59:22] Daniel knows DSO those areas I remember
[59:26] when I seen a woman smoked universe' la
[59:29] primera vez que yo be on a moped for all
[59:31] those things though they estas cosas
[59:33] well they was in the world when I was a
[59:36] child

[59:47] real hard entonces el hermano anonymous
[59:49] our goal pra so so as I was standing
[59:51] across the campfire from brother Branham
[59:53] I see he says does people think I hate
[59:57] women
[59:58] they say lamanno brahma la gente piensa
[1:00:01] que yo audio las mujeres now it's on
[1:00:03] tape you've heard him say that is was

[1:00:07] he says and we had heard people say he
[1:00:10] hates women

[1:05:26] woman preacher the ground is Yenisei
[1:05:32] Bironas es una mujer pre-k or of course
[1:05:36] in my young years I didn't think much
