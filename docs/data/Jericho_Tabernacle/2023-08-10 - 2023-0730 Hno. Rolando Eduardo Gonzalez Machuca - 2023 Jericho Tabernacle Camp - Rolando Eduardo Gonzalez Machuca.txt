[Music] and refresh our souls I mean amen before reading the word of the Lord I'd like for you all to take a seat for a few moments I like to express my gratitude of being here uh my name is Rolando Eduardo Gonzalez my name is Rolando Eduardo Gonzalez the Tabernacle of the word of the Living God San Salvador in San Salvador uh I bring ingredients from my church that now is the years entered in I'm now the general pastor of the church our founding Pastor brother Orlando Galvez Queens which is the father of my brother Jose that's seated right here and I always almost always say he's my father in the faith so I'm the little one out of them I'm the youngest son and that's the one that has to serve the rest you understand the son in faith [Music] righto like Paul would tell Timothy okay thank the Lord for being here at your camp us and this is a day of feasting this is the first of the week this is Sunday uh the day in which the son of right came to light up our hearts with faith I want to give thanks to Jericho Tabernacles the imitation they made for me to come esposa not just to me but myself my wife and my church but the only one who accompanies me is my wife my companion through it all North America the land of Elijah the prophet speaking to the the seed elected by God and speaking to the sons of Brothers you understand me right the way he spoke of those little brand of mites the blue-eyed ones of which some of you have que song and like the Lord said there is another flock that I must bring in how many could say Amen that message had to reach another place thanks to the rejection of some in which it reached that also happened to Israel the efforts that are seen mucho trabajo so much work intensive intense standing next to your pastor okay I believe the Lord sees that from heaven and he will reward you sustain your hearts Aura now granting us this Pope is it's something special I trust the Lord would be with us so that truly we can honor him foreign uh um and speak to you in the prophet's land I'm a little far from home pero and I could also say a what will I do Lord I don't want to go 5 16. if you've got your scripture taken and we can read it again much confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much aura Emos if we can go to the book of Saint Matthew chapter 6. foreign do we have it Brothers no it's gonna go hey squish IES therefore take no thoughts saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first to the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you esos knows alphaneates take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof is let us bow our heads and pray briefly Senor dios Lord God oh Our Father we're so thankful and in our hearts of Happiness we put ourselves before this is that truth is foreign in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated brother is the prayer is the title is Prayer Changes Things and the scripture in James tells us that the the prayer of the righteousness an effectual fervent prayer availeth much and that is true how many can say Amen presentations we've had Friday and Saturday wonderful presentations of the world where I believe paying attention to what we were told we can take so much things so much tools that can help us against the one that's opposing the word of God we know that there's two kingdoms kingdom of darkness they'll always be opposite and in contention may God help us the prayer the factual prayer of the righteous that took me to the thought to the subtitle Primera first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and everything will come um brother Branham tells us the prayer is a strong weapon God's given us I read in a message a poderos he says that it's something powerful yes but it's so powerful okay let's go to Isaiah 38. okay Isaiah 38 we were saying okay in those days Hezekiah got sick unto death and Isaiah the prophet came son of Gamers and came unto him said to him the Lord says the word of a prophet the mouthpiece of God it cannot fail and with a perfect heart now you're following Brothers it wasn't just any prayers and he was saying unto who everyone knew you know I've walked before this and with the perfect heart and then he started weeping in tears within his heart brother Brandon tells us he started to walk when the Lord told him hold on my mind go back a prophet is very obedient God bless us then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah saying verse 4. go and say to Hezekiah in other words turn around correct don't say it to the Lord thy father I have heard thy prayer and I've seen thy tears I will add unto thy name 15 years how many would like to pray like that and we can yeah I'm not lying me you know me is and he made it the opinion change there was a program of God it was his time and I'd like to point out something it was the petition of Hezekiah in a permissive will not in perfect will okay with everything God heard the prayer and gave it 15 more years I know that more things happen that God answered for him another thing that I see is that he did right the hard drives don't get hot that way we've been told the first thing is so that our Focus can change how many like that our self-righteousness in those days we've been given something more not self-righteousness with God who could come before I've been here I've been straight foreign I couldn't do that that's perfect that prayer it'll reach the Throne of God God bless us yeah both yeah are we going okay this is sometimes now that's tremendous you don't have anything to worry about everything was under control in the Garden of Eden do you remember in the evening time he'd go in his father's arms and he talked to him face to face and he would Embrace him oh I'm so happy myself oh when we walk in Eden how many will be there self-righteousness no no foreign by the blood of the Lamb that blood has power Brothers what I'm trying to say that a moment came that something appeared and you know it and it changed the whole scene brother speaks about that when man fell our fathers in Eden are a Los Angeles the angels He paints a picture this is all like a drama God's waiting that the Fallen race of Adam sin opened its eyes look unto calvaryto that the veil was open so that now our prayers anything that we ask of the Lord it can reach his presence don't get tired just hold on it's yours it's your inheritance the prophet says he becomes unconscious of who he is can you think about that that that son he had control there was peace and if the wind would blows that first Adam would say Be Peace at peace how many prayers for the storm to stop I prayed for it right there so then we're on the right path we're on the way back we're on that promise restoration is it not so yeah in a faith to get to a perfect faith necesitamos we need Primera first of all the kingdom of God and his righteousness and that righteous God it's unchangeable things went into judgment and there was a condemnation I'm going back in the tape going way far back I know but I believe because you've been taught we've got to know where we come from where we're standing so no word is that we're going to bendiga God bless us Anton says ah um when that happens brother Brandon quotes the message as a foundation of Faith the man becomes unconscious it seems like he doesn't understand who he is what is Man David said in the Psalms he's the greatest of God's creations um that's a great thing for God to be loved but God is also righteousness that's a little stronger but if you look in the scriptures if love appears a hundred times righteousness appears 200. go and test it out it's easy just test it and introduce and then go search the word righteousness you'll find out that it's double that is scripture my scripture yes and apart from that many times in that condition solamente intellectual strictly intellectual sometimes emotional security they want to get off this off the road from that thought that God is righteousness see yes yes there's a prayer that the Lord said and don't do it like that is that love and make these things in front of the synagogue and etc etc don't be like the Gentiles that they think because of what they do they'll fleas there's a prayer that that one's not he said it yeah you'll be rewarded openly that's a good prayer the Lord presents to us forgive me where I jump around and he says look at the grass they've got all that they need and do you see them praying it's a good question do you see nature praying she's connected to God she continues with God is that good this is our hearts it should always circulate with God God bless us that's why the Lord told us the kingdom of God and his righteousness what are we searching what do we need what is where do we want to reach and his righteous Ness and the kingdom of God the Lord said the Pharisees would ask him can you show us how he's going to come when he's going to come on no it doesn't come with it is amongst you amen inside of a body the Holy Spirit the fullness of the spirit amen he was connected completely continuous in the kingdom of God and his righteousness I've got some food that no one knows about the word the will of My Father which is in heaven continuously that's our food we need to eat for these bodies [Applause] of communion with God we need it I'm barely starting an introduction [Laughter] we needed that comment Amen brother thank you brother Jimmy and Don says uh well just briefly important is righteousness important salmos let's go to Psalms Psalms 11. Psalms 11 7 I mean to prove that it's important just that the brother enjoys it is for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness and his countenance doth behold what an expression that's the word of God then we can go to Psalms let's go to Psalm 15. verse and worketh righteousness and speak of the truth in his heart doesn't do no evil to his neighbors approach against his neighbor I'm here honoring those that fear the lord the Lord is my shepherd says he restoreth my soul that the Lord be my shepherd and I want to clear the clear it up we have a pastor but that's the great Pastor pero but where unto righteous Paths of righteousness for his name that's a great expression do I walk through the valley of the Shadows of death that's everyone I will fear no evil why the rod again who likes the rocks or to the devil right let's hit him with the rock um he loves righteousness and we're just going back he's restored am I wrong the Fallen race of Adam gots to be restored we need the staff we don't like to talk about that yes but that's how it happens I don't know why that happens to me but they say the Lord said there's no preacher that has honor with amongst but in the end forgiveness well in the universe forever oh Lord God just kidding is how many want that I want it every day of my life the kingdom of the Lord and his righteousness things get complicated he's got a big head it is so intelligent it is capable in orbit and with eyes from out there Google Maps now we can see Google Maps Google Earth Google Earth and we can find where you can go already needed the Holy Spirit living in him yes that's better than any GPS that will help you along the path to get once again how many need a GPS to get here what do we do without GPS thank you Lord for GPS the Lord didn't make that man made that haha solely un poquito I want to just read a little God hiding himself in Simplicity God doesn't make things complicated with all these rosaries and all these things here and there so much education and so much theology every day we're getting farther and farther in doing that scientists molecules we can say now how many molecules form an atom cuantos Electronics how many electrons and say how it's what it's made up of but with that to fabricate an atomic bomb is that right this matter right here atomos Adams the wood from the Tree Adams I think this is imitation but forgive me yeah I'm sorry but that one that's the original win that's the good one that's the one that works but it was needed Atomic power to create it what did it the word of God his whole world famous came to existence he made it for creation precious it has to change now we can split the atom fabric May create the bomb we can explain all those things on a leaf how it is that grass is there God and simplicity it's manifested sincere simple parakeets but you revealed it unto babes um and you know when the scripture speaks he's talking about the children he's talking about you he's talking about me the simple children of God not the great intellectuals not the great scientist see yes we appreciate appreciate all the technology it works but one day this won't work but you revealed it unto babes with God's favor why are you talking to us about this Maybe I know a little bit in construction about building there's nothing within building more valuable than the foundation from that excavation if they knew because they're laying the foundation and there is we know the pyramid what is the foundation but before Faith the new birth New Birth what good is if it doesn't have a foundation and his righteousness that which is born of flesh is Spirit what shall I pray but will I pray in the spirit and with understanding into that effectual fervent prayer in the songs that can be received are we okay not too many amends let's drink some water instead they don't understand but when we have a good foundation then we can add and then comes faith and it's not my faith you know it we need the face that was in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that's why the word it's circulated with him and he with the word amen [Applause] he'll have respect but first things first God help us it's not difficult it's not complicated the messenger already said it is the Lord made it easy he did it for us he took can you say Amen to that without faith we understand that baseball baseball we understand we won't even impossible impossible everything is possible oh now the building's starting to get higher it'll reach a point of one day being finished oh yes they're waiting right bro they're waiting they cannot be perfected without us God bless us if I told you that for me it was today was going to be memorable I believe that at the end of the message for many of you will also Sita but we need to be local to be placed upon a solid foundation see yes but also we know that's why this came un Constructor a builder Savi knows that is viral Pablo losupo Paul knew it just like a Chief Architect he laid the foundation man amen and the prophets those that are coming further they see how they're building see right now speaking about Builders we've got quite a large amount of Youth God bless you place your building upon the rock as a good Builder build upon the rock and when you make your your home bam just see how is it homosexual fundamental how the foundation is that's where he gets in the most sometimes you don't need the right materials and you don't mix in the right material you understand me a underground underground the underground that you need to lay the foundation upon brother Brandon tells us and the message the statue of a perfect man they're here the builders contractors [Applause] there'll be no problems nothing will fall down the inspector of the city won't come and then come with the the plans written in the book is there any Builders here okay this is and here are the the plans a they make amendments you understand me but I'm not going to get into that we need the Capstone to come upon it yeah as a wise master builder Paul says uh just a few moments ago I spoke with some brothers there were some ministers to tell you something foreign do it all over again there won't be a pay if you don't fix that and gets angry it's worthless rejected that has a license to the prophet about being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't want my home to come down but the Lord made it easy that's what I'm saying I don't know what the Lord says the pastor also gave me a license for a little bit more time but I want to say this on behalf of the message the message living dying buried and resurrecting the penalty of of death uh the penalty of sin is death and there was no one that could pay it there was no way there was only one foreign foreign to pay the price sin no longer has when he cried it is finished sin died the unbelief it ended and now it's dead that's in the prophet said the enemy of the human race no longer has life it no longer has an effect when it's received When My Sacrifice is received amen amen they needed to please God to find favor to be able to go back where they used to walk do we want to go back there Brothers have the message come for that see yes the prophet said the blood of Jesus Christ and his righteousness it has connected us I put this on es because the servants needed them De Los Reyes of the king of the king servants needed them that's where the use of the tie comes from and the prophet told us that the minister is a servant and he's a public servant whether it's hot Aya whether it's cold he has to continue to serve is follow me I love this Epistle of Hebrews just like Romans I tell my son he's studying law Romanos and I tell them Romans it's going to talk to you to teach you a lot about laws I know maybe some might not understand in great grandfather would gather intense you understand me Hebrews verse 11. Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11. foreign see just once in the Holy Place Eternal Redemption what is redemption is our original condition doesn't that make you happy yeah we're already marching we're on the Third Exodus see yes we're marching yesterday I've been preaching back home about the way of the election how many are left here how many pre-ordained on behalf yeah so you go keep marching under the pillars the angel of the Lord a prophet like Moses marking the way to the people for the people here's one of those priests foreign Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more La Sangre de Cristo shout the blood of Christ foreign see right the blood of Jesus Christ and so for this cause he's the mediator of a new testament a New Covenant see that means I don't know how many calls we have here would receive the promise of the Eternal inheritance Eternal inheritance to receive an inheritance it's always been ours that's eternal principles in the beginning it says Christ the high priest and you know the Spanish language it comes from Latin and in the Latin a high priest comes the word bridge to do in Latin or Italian is to do and so one that came to make a bridge we were separated one deep that's message me the bridge the Seven Seals no one cries unless the prophet says men fell into it there was no way of going back it must be tough to be in there no ideas not that it was difficult and I want to say this to encourage for those that went into prayer that's why I spoke of a foundation then the enemy's going to want to come and steal from you what is yours it's your inheritance it pertains to us so when you're conscious of that how are you going to believe that you have to ask and ask upon if that's yours you understand me someone went through sickness someone asked for the Holy Spirit someone asked for some problems [Applause] it's yours you are the children of God you're God's children what is it that we need in Eden but that's where we're headed it pertains to us now it's a little hot ter but we have ended here yeah someone said it's going to be hotter over there on one occasion I'm just going to speak a little bit once brother Brandon experience he told us his experience how he was out in the hurricane do you remember that and you know that he got lost there he couldn't find his way out many times that happens to us how is it possible that I can be lost do you remember that Eduardo is brother Eduardo 30 years ago he was baptized and now he's ministering for the Lord occasion could have been lost how could that be he gave him a lesson to our prophet the storm s where you were able to to find yourself but there was something precious in the cabin his wife little son Billy Paul say science six years old they will die if I don't managed to get there to them because they don't know how to get around them you remember foreign Brothers after going around a few times I thought okay wrong expert that I was an expert pero luego algo came to my mind for me to understand that I was not sufficient I wasn't as an expert as I thought even though even though he wouldn't give up that happens many times to us that's not for me that could be for someone else a little weak in faith someone that's just starting not for me I can help others but here was our Prophet going in circles and the Nightfall coming when you have time to read the seven compound names of Jehovah and then go over to the message a guide his mind started to tell him what's going on are you going crazy because it started to bounce between intellect and that which was in his heart we've got two means you know that right but the Lord with this one he can't work he's got to work with this one right here and like our brother was telling us the Lord wants us to just take things off house is starting to now getting even hotter the issue is [Applause] I'm lost but there's my family as well I tell that to my beloved brother but it has to be spoken to our hearts it was getting dark ER until you remember that life there was that telephone line that communication that was always there that dance it didn't let him see when he humbled himself then the Lord opened up a Hole In This Cloud and there's where you found that here installed years ago with the man the owner of that ranch do you remember that until he came down he came down the life of life and he connected but first things first that righteous Lifeline all the way to the Savior where I went to El Salvador where I live in English maybe 50 60 times within the country of United States who knows it is that little flea the America of America I don't know truly pero momento there was a moment where the line was long and the prophet's arm got tired and that happens because the arm gets tired many times from keep touching the line yeah you know that he walked a lot muchas many miles it starts to hurt there was a line of communication and we stopped praying foreign that's our message right pero terminal a guide that I mean you know end here my arm got so tired I couldn't hold it I had to bring it down but I held on to that wire I threw my rifle on the ground many times you have to go to what God provides us what God provides is even better now foreign deadline is because back then he didn't know that I was going to serve him a purpose the line got a hold of him [Music] 23. and I'll trust in him the rest of the way unto all righteousness Amigos friends amen foreign hola is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Applause] hello Daddy Hallelujah is foreign [Music] [Music]
