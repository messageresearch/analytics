place i wasn't deserving i was a sinner i was doomed to death but he took the phone [Music] [Music] you can all be seated it's so wonderful to be here with you all in camp i like to say like our prophet would say good evening i've got to catch up with a lot of brothers that i haven't seen in a long time [Music] but we are privileged to be here tonight i'm here with my wife sister yvette hermann would you stand and also my daughter asia i don't know where she is amen it's a privilege and honor to be here with you tonight i want to thank my brother we sure do love to be here with you tonight so many so many that we've seen and it's such a privilege again to be here i also bring you a greetings from brother mark castillo damien hermano mark castillo i i saw him talk to him on her way over here you asked me brother anthony can you bring some shirts to camp i said yes brother we'll bring them in i'd like to give a little testimony before we get started of how we wound up coming here this spring i had uh i had asked the lord that i'd like to take my daughter asia to a church camp and no no we didn't hear nothing but then uh i kind of just left it alone and then uh a couple months ago we went to tucson and i got to sit down and have breakfast by brother i was wondering how i would be able to get a hold of you to see if you come to to our church camp hermano esta tando de coming he never does not listen to our prayers tonight church like brother said he already had answered his prayer before the walk was even over so again we thank the lord for being here for hearing our prayer for inspiring our brother so we think we thank the lord jesus so much for that so many stories i've heard of people coming to camp historians i heard that the brothers from nakadosis they drove 19 hours to be here would you mind standing for the brothers from nagadosha and i've heard that i heard that they've been fasting the whole time excited to come here and hear something like that you have to feel nothing but inadequate um and shame on us if we were to speak anything but the word of god tonight may the lord bless their their blessed hearts tonight amen and all of our amen heavenly father as we approach thy throne of grace and mercy lord we are not adequate lord but father by your blood that you have shed for us there is no reason tonight father that there should be anyone that would leave here tonight that would be sick of those that have sacrificed so much sacrifice bless them exceedingly abundantly bless each heart tonight here we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ holy spirit come into the word tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen before you're seated into your bibles to galatians chapter 5 we are going to read our theme the theme of these services but i've always been taught that if you want to understand the verse read the one before it okay brother jose thank you so much gracias for your service tonight brother god bless you amen galatians 5 24. when you have it would you say amen i see although it is so beautiful to see the pages of the sacred bible being turned you all have been is something you can take with you anywhere i've been to places where they don't have that visit and the demons will tremble just by the look of that book diablo how sweet it is to hear the pages turn amen amen chapter 5 verse 24 it says and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the afflictions amen may the lord add his blessing to his reading of his word amen amen in this scripture that we just read we find that when we take the name of jesus christ in our lives it's a bed of roses right that's not what god's word says when we take the name of christ in our lives there is a crucifixion of the flesh now that doesn't mean that you go and you have someone nailed you want to cross i know many people will try that that's not what it means but there is a crucifixion of the flesh that has to happen and it means that you die to your own self-will your own self-will has to die if you're christ now if you're not christ you'll live whatever old little old life you want to live but if you belong to christ [Music] and so if you're not willing to do that you'll never make it to the next verse in this chapter you'll never make it to the theme of these meetings that's why it's called a crucifixion a crucifixion but if you're not willing to do that you're not christ and you're never going to make it to verse 25. now verse 25 if [Music] you know as as i was a as i was getting ready to come i already had all kinds of notes of a pretty message it sounded real good i got up tuesday morning el martes vinola have you ever let the lord change your mind you don't got nothing else to worry about but as i was considering this team uh i realized something that the way that the theme is written walk with god it's written as a command our subtitle is a command subtitle is written are you here to play games with him is christian walk neil coming out of heaven you're either christ christopher you're not as easy as that there's no halfway no i don't halfway big christians no i am uh walk with christ so what does born again mean significant nature [Music] still alive it has to be crucified this is a commandment you must be born against brother need man-made creeds [Music] the and the police officer yells stop it's implied the thief's name is not important you know who the biggest criminal is [Music] one word maybe some of you are running and maybe you're running alone maybe some of you are crawling solo nobody can obey this command nobody can can can obey it they can't make your choice for you nope can you point to yourself this is my response obey the commandment of the lord with god you might say you might you might say uh well i'm going to walk with god you might say well that don't tell me where i'm going where you're going when you're walking with god because you're already there if you walk with god you're already there [Music] [Music] he is and he calls you tonight he says tonight some of you are looking at me like you don't know what we're talking about how is it that we walk with him it's by the water christ is the word christos words they are spirits and they are life if you don't walk with god tonight you'll walk in an illusion you'll walk alone to a place that don't exist okay i'm gonna say that again if you don't walk with god if you refuse to call him tonight you will walk alone in an illusion and when i lose a place that isn't there how many of you take an english class cuantos antomando clases de engles how many knows what are incomplete sentences it means that most of the sentence is not there significant is lying to your mind he loves you none of you should perish that is the will of the god that we serve as a a lot of hands didn't go up that's okay before these services is over everybody here can say i want to walk away it becomes personal as a command because it's directed to you walk with god let this time here at camp quest let it be a moment where you can come to a commitment and you can tell the lord i choose you tonight i choose you i i say goodbye world i stay no longer with you i've made up my mind to go god's way the rest of my [Music] we want to keep it very since the action in this command is to walk is the coming out let's just focus on walk about so can we get six so we get some volunteers we're gonna turn our bible to proverbs chapter 6 can we get four volunteers cuatro somebody very brave can we get two young ladies somebody very brave with a bible with a rifle on a shoulder and a bible in your hand come on come on get because there's a blessing that comes with what we're going to do can we get two young ladies there we go there's one brave one because we can read one of the verses twice you know that's the thing about god's word if if it if it wasn't worth repeating we shouldn't have said it in the first place did one of these microphones work we good are these good all right the reason that i'm having this is because there's [Music] is he that and them that keep the words of this book so anybody want a blessing tonight raise your hand okay we're going to read it we're going to hear it and then it's going to be our job to keep it okay okay so we'll start our brother we'll start with brother jacob you read you read 20. then our sister here you read 21. and then we'll go back to the brother and read 23 again all right you all got it in your bibles because you're going to receive a blessing tonight so read it you hear it let's go and to keep it either all right go ahead brother kick us off proverbs 6 20 my son obey your father's commands and don't neglect your mother's instruction time out he endorsed the king james version of the bible and we have a different version there that's okay i'm not i'm not against another version of the bible it's just when god's prophet says and endorsed a certain thing with that that's what we like this is verse 20 right here if you guys don't have the right version you can pass that around my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother amen juarez it shall keep thee and when thou awakens shall talk with thee for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life amen brother read that verse again 23 for the commandment is a lamp and the law is the light and reproofs of instructions are the way of life amen hey man can we give our brave brothers [Applause] thank you brothers and sisters you're going to be blessed for that you just you just watched because it brings the entire family and this scripture tells us what it is you need to be in a position necessitating a position to issue godly commands to your children you have to be in a position amen we love our mothers mothers mothers you have a very important role to play us you need to be in a position in your home to issue godly law to your children and now how many children do we have pretty much everybody everybody is somebody's child [Music] amen you got to be in that position that is a huge responsibility don't ever forsake those no you are charged young people by god's word that you stay close to your mother and father's laws and commands everybody's still here why is it important to tie them and bind them upon [Music] [Music] run at some point everybody's gonna try to run but tonight the commandment is to walk to stand on god's [Music] we as parents our children [Music] no matter how old [Music] it's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] she won't let you go young people the enemy he's going to come in like a flood in your life but when he does god raises up a standard the lamp would you walk in this light were they coming out in saluz thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path we got about it looks like about eight to ten more minutes you want to stand for just a minute just down and stretch out your legs for a minute can you just sing the song i [Music] [Music] love me [Music] oh [Music] sometimes we just need a little option can you sing the song just smile and say [Music] [Music] amen amen he can be seated so the first thing we need to know first thing you need in order to walk is what escape what do you need to walk with okay if you don't have feet it's a little hard to walk now your feet are what god gave you to walk with los piezkos i know probably some of you guys some of you girls can probably walk on your hands the next thing you need in this scripture is a lamp into my feet and a light into my path to palabrasi looking down that you choose so immediately this removes all the blame that you can place on somebody else so many of us say oh nobody understands me ok my parents they don't understand me please father if somebody would just understand me i'd feel better we've all felt that way haven't we todd there's a news flash when you we are pulling ourselves into our own little selfish shells and in that we go into a delusion illusion that someone else has caused our problems we become a shellfish we ought to know that as soon as we are feeling that way run walk away from that where you and i wind up don't us nobody else's fault it's an individual decision individual which path of life you're going to take you can choose your choice tonight is a matter of life and death and i'll i'm a good little boy i'm a good little girl okay i go to church i sing in the choirs i sing specials even i play an instrument i'm a song leader but are you in order to have light loose you have to have a lamp see us cellular we'll be walking around camp like this i see you know what the problem with this is because this cell phone cellular is not just a lamp onto your feet and it's not just a light to your path [Music] this is not the lamp we're talking about problem with bones they take your attention off the path here's an idea you're gonna check that brother no i'm not gonna check that bing bing is the biggest distraction in the world put that stinking thing away find time in your life somewhere good to read as a young person read the second time around okay but get get get a a recording of our profit if you've got to put it in your phone okay we don't have tape players no more [Music] [Music] and get it and read page by page follow what brother i'm going to stop right there i believe that that is sufficient i'm going to tell you tonight jesus christ is the same yesterday today and whatever he head bow and every hi eye closed right now try not to go to the restroom unless you're just having an emergency just real quietly now in this moment you know the lord gives us moments this is a moment for us tonight this is a moment of commitment it is a moment of the decision i'm going to ask first of the fathers the dads tonight how many fathers can raise your hand [Music] [Music] to not let hollywood and now young people you would see your mamas and your daddies have their hands up right now i'm going to ask each one of you tonight i'm going to ask you tonight you may not ever get another chance then tonight to make this decision but would you say tonight i choose the lord jesus christ i say i want to stand and follow the laws his laws and commandments i we come before you tonight lord there's a heart behind each one of them in that heart there's been a decision to walk with you lord lord i give my life i raise my hands with them to to walk with you lord

[Music] [Applause] all preparations that you did to be able to be here the time off that you took from work the time that it took to drive the sisters that have been helping us with the food and everything they've been doing in reality god sees all of that we believe that the prophet has taught us implicit god hides and comes out in simplicity and the most simple thing that we do i believe that we have received encouragement or encouragement to and he asked him do you want to walk with me that would be the greatest privilege that i could ever have in my life and god gave us a promise
