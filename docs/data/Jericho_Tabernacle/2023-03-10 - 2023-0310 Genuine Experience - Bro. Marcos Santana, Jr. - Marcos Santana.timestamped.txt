[42:15] the songs were songs
[42:18] we prayed unto the Lord
[42:20] we're here to hear the words
[42:23] but are you ready to receive and take
[42:26] that word
[42:29] we have a youth service here tonight
[42:33] so we're going to try and direct
[42:35] ourselves to the youth this evening
[42:39] that maybe something might be said or
[42:42] something might be read
[42:45] that could touch a young person tonight
[42:49] maybe open up just a little bit of those
[42:51] eyes
[42:54] the little eyes of understanding
[42:57] so they can take another step forward
[43:02] and reach that goal is
[43:07] I'm glad to see a brother and the
[43:09] members of zulima Gracia tonight
[43:13] I was with them not too long ago
[43:18] and it's so awesome for them to return
[43:20] the favor and be back here with us again
[43:27] [Applause]
[43:33] thank you
[43:35] I want to thank our pastor for the
[43:37] opportunity
[43:40] and just greet each and every one of you
[43:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:46] you keep me in prayer for my nerves to
[43:49] come
[43:53] and we don't come to hear the man
[43:57] we come just to hear from God
[44:02] so as we're standing
[44:04] if you'd be so kind to turn to the book
[44:06] of Acts chapter 19. foreign
[44:21] and I couldn't find a good title for
[44:24] tonight
[44:27] so I said why not keep it simple for the
[44:29] use
[44:32] we're going to title tonight a genuine
[44:35] experience
[44:39] so Acts 19 2 reads
[44:42] the same
[44:45] Acts 19 2 said he said unto them have
[44:48] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[44:50] believed and they said unto him we have
[44:53] not so much has heard whether there be
[44:55] any holy ghosts
[45:05] and he said unto them unto what then
[45:08] were you baptized and they said unto
[45:11] John's
[45:13] baptisms
[45:17] then said Paul John verily baptized with
[45:21] the baptism of repentance saying unto
[45:24] the people that they should believe on
[45:26] him which should come after him that is
[45:29] on on Christ Jesus
[45:40] Christ and when they heard this when
[45:44] they heard this they were baptized in
[45:47] the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:53] and then Paul laid his hands upon them
[45:57] and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and
[45:59] they spoke in tongues and prophesied
[46:01] yeah
[46:09] there's Bower has for prayer
[46:12] Lord Heavenly Father we thank you this
[46:15] evening
[46:17] for another blessed opportunity to be in
[46:20] your house Lord
[46:23] what a pleasant blessing to be able to
[46:26] have our visiting Brothers come tonight
[46:32] to bring their lick of fire into this
[46:35] building
[46:38] to bring that Holy Ghost anointing that
[46:41] they carry with them in this building
[46:46] that we can create an atmosphere of
[46:48] Revival here tonight
[46:53] maybe we could have another Pentecost
[46:55] here tonight
[46:58] but father for all of that we need one
[47:01] thing
[47:04] we need of your holy presence here
[47:09] father we ask that you would come this
[47:11] evening
[47:13] make yourself present and evident Lord
[47:19] so that a young person tonight can be
[47:22] touched and transformed
[47:26] you saw this service before the
[47:29] foundation of the world
[47:32] and you know each and every young person
[47:34] that would be here tonight
[47:38] so father just let your word flow
[47:42] and open the hearts this evening
[47:46] help me and my interpreter Lord
[47:49] then we can just surrender ourselves to
[47:52] you
[47:53] we put ourselves in this service in your
[47:56] hands
[47:58] bless the reading of this word
[48:02] we give you the honor and glory and the
[48:04] thanks
[48:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:10] amen amen
[48:13] thank you to the musicians
[48:24] the title genuine experience
[48:28] I believe our entire Christian walk is
[48:31] based upon a single genuine experience
[48:39] every step forward that we take started
[48:42] with a genuine experience
[48:48] that that experience that caused
[48:50] repentance
[48:54] that experience that took us to the
[48:56] Waters of baptism is
[49:00] that experience they gave us the baptism
[49:03] of the Holy Ghost
[49:07] the experience that gave us the new
[49:10] birth experience
[49:12] and you know I really enjoy using this
[49:15] scripture from the book of Acts 19.
[49:19] and specific for the Youth uh
[49:23] because when you read it it seems like
[49:25] the people that Paul was talking to had
[49:27] an excuse
[49:32] because they were able to say we don't
[49:34] know of a holy ghosts
[49:38] and talking to the youth tonight yeah
[49:42] every message believe in youth tonight
[49:47] cannot have that excuse
[49:49] because I know we preach about a holy
[49:52] ghost
[49:55] I've been in service with our brothers
[49:57] and they preach about a holy ghosts
[50:03] unless this is somebody's first time
[50:06] here in a message Church you know about
[50:08] the Holy ghosts
[50:15] but for this specific group of people
[50:20] these were already genuine Christians
[50:24] who are believers that Paul happened to
[50:27] encounter
[50:29] they had a revelation
[50:32] they were following the words
[50:35] they were living the word for their days
[50:38] because they went and they had their
[50:41] messenger John
[50:44] Juan and they were baptized unto the
[50:46] baptism of John foreign
[51:28] the word says the word the Bible says
[51:31] that they were baptized then in the name
[51:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:36] now I find it amazing that in those
[51:38] scriptures
[51:41] there was no record of an argument
[51:45] there was no debate here going on
[51:50] you know many times we run into people
[51:52] that we try to to evangelize muchas
[51:57] many times not even trying to present to
[52:00] them an end-time message
[52:03] and
[52:05] they're so impregnated and rooted with
[52:07] their own doctrines and beliefs yes
[52:13] it immediately comes with the resistance
[52:16] attention
[52:21] but these believers
[52:57] that's why it's so easy to believe if
[52:59] we're Believers today foreign
[53:24] just like these that accepted the
[53:27] baptism of Jesus Christ
[53:31] they would be Believers in this day
[53:35] so as soon as they heard they were all
[53:38] re-baptized
[53:41] and the Bible says that then Paul laid
[53:44] his hands upon him
[53:47] and then they received the Holy ghosts
[53:51] they received it after baptism
[53:55] first was the
[53:58] baptismal and then was the Holy Ghost
[54:01] and we know God has a process that he's
[54:04] mapped out
[54:07] that they are in time messenger has
[54:09] taught us
[54:12] of a process to reach that new birth
[54:18] I want to read a quote I don't know if
[54:20] the brothers got the quotes or not
[54:24] Manos on the message birth pains
[54:27] in paragraph 49 reads
[54:30] and and so it is in the spiritual realm
[54:34] is it yes yes
[54:36] it's water it's agua justification by
[54:40] faith crucification Believing on God
[54:44] receiving him as your personal Savior
[54:47] and being baptized
[54:50] he puts those all together in one for
[54:53] the first step
[54:57] water justification by faith believing
[55:00] on God receiving him as your personal
[55:01] savior crucification
[55:07] and be baptized
[55:09] second is sanctification
[55:14] sanctification of the spirit
[55:17] that God cleanses that spirit
[55:20] and he cleanses it from all the elements
[55:23] of the world
[55:26] all the elements of the world
[55:29] and the desires of the world
[55:32] nobody can tell me that they haven't had
[55:35] desires of the world
[55:39] we're born in this flesh
[55:41] young people every young person in here
[55:43] has an attraction to the world
[55:47] if your Nature has not been changed
[55:52] in all actuality
[55:55] you being in church
[55:57] you forcing yourself to pray
[56:00] you're forcing yourself to see
[56:04] forcing yourself to act decent
[56:08] if your Nature has not been changed
[56:12] we're actually fighting against the true
[56:15] nature that you have right now
[56:20] so why not not fight that nature
[56:54] is
[56:56] that something that you want tonight
[57:05] and the desires of the world brother
[57:06] Branham says
[57:09] and then the Holy Spirit comes in
[57:13] and it gives you the new birth
[57:17] and it fills up that Sanctified vessel
[57:22] the words of our prophets
[57:25] and I wanted to share two testimonies
[57:29] two examples from the Bible
[57:32] of a baptism I don't know maybe you've
[57:37] read about maybe you've read this
[57:38] testimony maybe you haven't
[57:41] but about the eunuch in the Bible
[57:45] I believe he's the Ethiopian
[57:49] who was out on his Carriage
[57:52] Olivia was on his way to Jerusalem
[57:55] and he was reading the book of Isaiah
[57:59] and simple enough
[58:01] he was just on his way trying to maybe
[58:04] Enlighten himself
[58:54] because something's about to happen
[58:58] and then Philip crosses path with this
[59:01] unit
[59:04] eunuch he notices that he was reading
[59:06] the book of Isaiah
[59:12] I forget what exactly he was reading but
[59:14] he couldn't understand
[59:18] and so he uh Philip asks him do you know
[59:22] what you're reading
[59:24] you know like maybe uh maybe our youth
[59:28] leader or some of the brothers that
[59:29] helped in the youth might ask the youth
[59:31] do you understand when you're reading
[59:32] the Bible when you're reading the
[59:33] message
[59:39] and in the honesty of his heart he's
[59:41] just saying I don't get it is he talking
[59:43] about himself is he talking about
[59:44] someone to come here
[59:51] that was the hook or the Real to Reel
[59:54] him in
[59:57] like our brother Emmanuel used to say a
[59:59] lot
[1:00:00] Manuel to study a word study a word
[1:00:03] study a word
[1:00:04] foreign
[1:01:04] this is not an option for me I have to
[1:01:07] do this
[1:01:10] now there's one example
[1:01:13] but we have another example
[1:01:15] we have Paul and Silas Silas and then
[1:01:19] the Jailer in
[1:01:21] prisoner I believe Paul and Silas were
[1:01:24] in Rome
[1:01:27] I could be mistaken
[1:01:29] but they were causing up a stirrup in
[1:01:32] the city
[1:01:34] and they were they were taken captive
[1:01:38] I believe they were beaten down
[1:01:41] they were thrown into that prison
[1:01:46] and and you know maybe this took place
[1:01:48] in the middle of the day when the sun
[1:01:50] was still out
[1:01:53] let's say around 11 12 o'clock in the
[1:01:55] afternoon
[1:01:58] and you know there was a Jailer that was
[1:02:01] appointed with the commission to watch
[1:02:03] over there yeah
[1:02:20] if he was not paying attention
[1:02:24] he might have missed the opportunity
[1:02:26] that was right in front of him
[1:02:29] but he was told to watch so that they
[1:02:32] would not escape
[1:02:35] and so as we know the scriptures if
[1:02:38] you've read it
[1:02:40] around midnight
[1:02:43] there was a great earthquake that
[1:02:45] happened
[1:02:47] and and the doors ripped open and the
[1:02:50] chains fell off
[1:02:54] something Supernatural just took place
[1:02:57] now I was telling my brother Emmanuel in
[1:03:00] the back
[1:03:03] Sometimes the best way that I can
[1:03:05] understand things is to try and get into
[1:03:07] the scene
[1:03:11] that's why I said let's say that Paul
[1:03:13] and Silas got put in prison during the
[1:03:16] afternoon
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:21] the Jailer had to watch over them all
[1:03:24] day till midnight
[1:03:28] what must have the Jailer heard from
[1:03:31] Paul and Silas in that prison
[1:03:38] Paul over here preaching to this group
[1:03:40] of of prisoners
[1:03:44] Silas over here praying for this group
[1:03:47] of sick uh uh prisoners
[1:03:52] Deliverance taking place baptisms of the
[1:03:55] Holy Ghost maybe taking place
[1:03:59] taking place left and right
[1:04:04] and here is the Jailer walking up and
[1:04:06] down the aisles listening and seeing
[1:04:08] these things
[1:04:15] the scriptures say faith
[1:04:21] in hearing the word of God
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:27] foreign
[1:04:36] but this man was watching
[1:04:40] and therefore he was listening foreign
[1:05:20] he's going to get fired he's going to
[1:05:22] get put in prison they're going to kill
[1:05:24] him
[1:05:27] the Bible says that he wanted to kill
[1:05:30] himself stab himself
[1:05:34] in the corner said no stop
[1:05:36] foreign
[1:06:35] it took me back to our are we went once
[1:06:38] to South Africa
[1:06:41] with my sister my wife
[1:06:43] esposa we're at a Convention of about
[1:06:45] three or four thousand people yes
[1:06:49] and this testimony maybe reminded me of
[1:06:52] a certain person yes
[1:06:56] it told us how the bus drivers would
[1:06:58] drop people off at the entrance
[1:07:05] and I think you'll remember
[1:07:08] I believe you'll remember this
[1:07:10] and that the bus drivers would just come
[1:07:12] here
[1:07:14] drop off the two three four hundred
[1:07:16] people
[1:07:18] they sleep in their bus
[1:07:21] they get out and go eat the free food
[1:07:24] from the Fellowship Hall Salinas
[1:07:28] since there was no air conditioning they
[1:07:30] would just open the doors to the to the
[1:07:31] auditorium is
[1:07:36] drivers would just come in and kind of
[1:07:38] hang out and listen to the service for a
[1:07:40] little bit it is
[1:07:45] by the second or the third service
[1:07:55] the little bit that they caught of the
[1:07:57] word of God being priests
[1:08:03] in less than 24 hours
[1:08:09] those bus drivers surrendered their life
[1:08:12] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:16] so the Bible says that this Jailer
[1:08:19] is told what can you do to be safe
[1:08:26] very simple Bible says just believe the
[1:08:30] Lord
[1:08:33] you and your household shall be saved
[1:08:37] and the Bible says that he and his
[1:08:40] household were baptized
[1:08:44] two very different experiences
[1:08:47] but both of them were genuine
[1:08:50] experiences
[1:08:52] you can look at the eunuch and say it
[1:08:55] was so simple so basically
[1:08:59] I don't think Philip had to yell at him
[1:09:02] and try and make him cry and break down
[1:09:07] he just had to Simply take him through
[1:09:10] the scriptures
[1:09:12] but in the Jailer on the other hand
[1:09:17] that Gentile unto the Jews and
[1:09:20] non-believers
[1:09:23] who was there probably even hated the
[1:09:25] Jews that he had there in the prison
[1:09:30] he required of a tremendous Supernatural
[1:09:34] experience
[1:09:36] natural we're both still needed to be
[1:09:39] evangelized
[1:09:43] both still needed to be convicted
[1:09:47] and both also have to repent yeah
[1:09:52] repent and then be baptized
[1:09:57] and you shall receive the gifts
[1:10:01] the young people you shall receive the
[1:10:03] gifts
[1:10:06] of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:09] so both were going through those steps
[1:10:15] repentance
[1:10:19] and if the story could go on at one
[1:10:21] point in their life the baptism of the
[1:10:23] Holy Ghost is
[1:10:29] youth we should know those steps by now
[1:10:34] repent be baptized receive the receive
[1:10:37] the gift of the Holy ghosts
[1:10:42] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:10:44] of the Holy Ghost crucification
[1:10:45] sanctifications
[1:10:47] and thank God for our profit to make it
[1:10:50] even clearer
[1:10:54] very simple water blood and spirits
[1:10:59] and the message the third seal
[1:11:02] so the brother Brandon could say to
[1:11:04] young people tonight
[1:11:07] he says justification sanctification the
[1:11:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:15] the last three messages the last three
[1:11:18] Church ages forms the complete birth
[1:11:25] just like when a woman is having or
[1:11:28] going to have a baby
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:32] the actual first thing that happens is
[1:11:35] water
[1:12:18] so young people do we understand that
[1:12:22] it makes sense
[1:12:25] I I wanted to share a testimony
[1:12:29] of something personally that happened in
[1:12:31] my life
[1:12:33] it was in the first years of me being
[1:12:40] you know it's funny the only time the
[1:12:43] first and only time I ever shared this
[1:12:44] testimony uh from behind the pulpit is
[1:12:51] a few years ago my brother Emmanuel
[1:12:53] foreign
[1:13:19] you know the first time I ever shared my
[1:13:21] testimony
[1:13:24] which is a dual testimony mine in my
[1:13:26] wife's testimony yes
[1:13:30] I don't know who caught wind of it but
[1:13:32] it just spread like
[1:13:34] wildfires
[1:13:37] so for many years I wasn't preaching
[1:13:41] I was just testifying of what God had
[1:13:44] done in my life
[1:13:47] and it took me to testify in many
[1:13:50] countries
[1:13:53] all the way to South Africa that trip
[1:13:55] that I was just talking about
[1:13:59] so for you to get a picture of how many
[1:14:01] times times I kept testifying and
[1:14:03] testifying and testifying
[1:14:07] the more I would Testify
[1:14:10] the more the devil would attack me
[1:14:13] every single time because back then
[1:14:17] I didn't have the same knowledge of the
[1:14:20] scriptures I have today
[1:14:23] I didn't have the same knowledge of the
[1:14:25] message like I have today
[1:14:29] now that I remember
[1:14:31] I believe that was the when I gave that
[1:14:34] Testament the first time I met brother
[1:14:35] Lewis in
[1:14:39] Persona and look how God is
[1:14:43] I'm able to share the battlefield with
[1:14:45] my brother Louise
[1:14:48] God is
[1:14:51] well I will share my testimony
[1:14:55] and I couldn't say clearly without a
[1:14:58] doubt I know that I went through the
[1:15:00] steps of the new
[1:15:36] she was justified Sanctified and filled
[1:15:39] with the Holy Ghost right there on the
[1:15:40] spot
[1:15:45] and because of my lack of understanding
[1:15:50] I like the expression I know that I know
[1:15:52] that I know
[1:15:56] because sometimes if I don't understand
[1:15:58] it
[1:16:01] this much I'm still going to believe it
[1:16:05] I didn't understand how why it happened
[1:16:10] but I know it was real
[1:16:13] and you know I would share her testimony
[1:16:16] in my testimony
[1:16:18] and and I didn't want to tell her
[1:16:22] yeah that I had doubts that she didn't
[1:16:25] go through the steps of the new birth
[1:16:30] maybe she wasn't born again
[1:16:34] maybe these testimonies we've been
[1:16:37] sharing have been fake
[1:16:42] they've been people baptized there have
[1:16:45] been people that have been blessed but
[1:16:46] if we're lying then all this is fake
[1:16:54] and the devil would attack me over and
[1:16:57] over and over
[1:17:00] I want to tell her because I didn't want
[1:17:02] to discourage hero
[1:17:06] did I know she was thinking the same
[1:17:08] thing about herself
[1:17:12] but she didn't want to tell me because
[1:17:14] she didn't want to
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:41] and then he starts explaining what
[1:17:43] they're foreign
[1:17:53] was getting so many letters and
[1:17:56] questions
[1:17:59] that he couldn't open them up and read
[1:18:02] them no more there wasn't enough time in
[1:18:03] the day
[1:18:07] so he was testifying that Billy Paul
[1:18:10] would give him a letter
[1:18:13] he was just under the anointing and the
[1:18:15] gift that God gave him
[1:18:18] he would just write the answer and send
[1:18:21] it back
[1:18:23] write the answer on top and send it back
[1:18:26] it wouldn't even open it
[1:18:30] you don't
[1:18:41] and here we have a letter from a sister
[1:18:43] who asked brother Branham the question
[1:18:45] is
[1:18:49] you have to be baptized in order to
[1:18:52] receive the holy ghosts
[1:18:56] brother Branham writes on the top and we
[1:18:58] saw it
[1:19:01] God bless you Sister you do not have to
[1:19:04] be baptized to receive the baptism of
[1:19:06] the Holy ghosts
[1:19:12] we broke down crying so bad
[1:19:17] she didn't know that I felt that way I
[1:19:19] didn't know that she felt that way
[1:19:24] we turned around and looked at each
[1:19:26] other because she was in front of me
[1:19:30] and at that moment when knew that we had
[1:19:33] the same struggle
[1:19:36] but we knew that we received the same
[1:19:38] answer
[1:19:41] and the very next day my brother that
[1:19:44] gave the tour invited us to his house
[1:19:48] and when we were having a good time
[1:19:50] sharing testimonies and fellowships
[1:19:56] his I believe his mother or his
[1:19:58] grandmother
[1:20:00] who was healed who was healed by Brother
[1:20:03] Branham of cancer
[1:20:05] who brother Branham called her by her
[1:20:08] full name when no one in her family knew
[1:20:10] her full name
[1:20:16] the sister was a little bit deaf she
[1:20:19] couldn't hear
[1:20:21] so she was trying to be discreet asking
[1:20:24] her daughter-in-law
[1:20:28] she wanted to say ask him about the
[1:20:46] okay brother would you share your
[1:20:48] testimony all right
[1:20:50] as we're sharing our testimonies
[1:20:53] there's a certain part that caught the
[1:20:55] attention of the brother that gave us
[1:20:57] the tour is
[1:21:00] and it was like a revelation had struck
[1:21:03] him at that instance
[1:21:07] and he got up from his seat
[1:21:10] he said I get it I get it
[1:21:13] I understand now
[1:21:16] yesterday
[1:21:18] when we were in the voice of God
[1:21:20] building
[1:21:22] and I was telling everyone
[1:21:37] I want you to know we have have hundreds
[1:21:40] of boxes in the back
[1:21:44] filled with hundreds of letters inside
[1:21:47] of them
[1:21:49] and of all the letters we could have put
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:55] we chose to put that one
[1:21:58] because God wanted to preserve this
[1:22:01] letter
[1:22:03] over 60 years
[1:22:07] because the prophet his ministry is
[1:22:10] still working today
[1:22:15] we've seen it how many times since our
[1:22:17] brother Emmanuel told us his testimony
[1:22:22] the brother said it preserved that
[1:22:24] letter for 60 years so you can have your
[1:22:27] doubts answered foreign
[1:23:03] I believe that the reason Paul had to be
[1:23:05] baptized there
[1:23:09] because it's officially an essential in
[1:23:12] the Bible that we are baptized
[1:23:19] official official what does he say
[1:23:22] official and essential official a
[1:23:25] indispensable that every single one of
[1:23:28] these young people here gets baptized
[1:23:32] now he says but I'm going to take it
[1:23:34] right back to them
[1:23:38] when the thief was hanging there on the
[1:23:40] cross
[1:23:43] and he died without being baptized at
[1:23:46] all
[1:23:48] absolutely he was not baptized
[1:23:51] but he just said that we have to be
[1:23:53] baptized foreign
[1:24:32] status but he said that was the first
[1:24:35] time he had the opportunity
[1:24:39] I don't think this is your first time
[1:24:42] for the opportunity
[1:24:46] we can find ourselves in the regions of
[1:24:49] the lost if we die tomorrow
[1:24:54] or we can accept him tonight
[1:24:59] and meet him in Paradise
[1:25:03] but what are you going to do about it
[1:25:06] okay
[1:25:07] are you going to accept him
[1:25:10] are you going to make that decision
[1:25:14] if we jump into the story of Cornelius
[1:25:19] and Cornelius was a Roman Centurion
[1:25:23] Cornelius
[1:25:25] I think the Bible says a good man that
[1:25:28] would pray and do give things to the
[1:25:30] poor
[1:25:42] multiple times kind of like bothering
[1:25:45] him it was it was a burden upon his life
[1:25:51] and eventually told him that he needed
[1:25:53] to go send someone to find this man
[1:25:55] Peter okay
[1:25:59] and to bring that Peter to the house
[1:26:03] there was something Peter had for him
[1:26:08] and now God works on both ends of the
[1:26:10] line
[1:26:15] a deep calling
[1:26:18] if that's the Eternal Light Of God
[1:26:23] then it's a perfect line of God
[1:26:27] and he's going to prepare things so
[1:26:29] perfectly for you in your life
[1:26:32] foreign
[1:27:31] the Holy Ghost was for the Gentiles
[1:27:37] I'm gonna tell you one thing young
[1:27:39] people
[1:27:41] I won't be shocked tonight
[1:27:44] if somebody gets the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:27:49] if some Gentile here tonight
[1:27:53] there's something tonight
[1:28:00] she's like those Jews that were
[1:28:02] surprised
[1:28:04] because I know that this word and this
[1:28:07] message was sent for us
[1:28:11] for us in this day
[1:28:15] they received the Holy Ghost
[1:28:19] first they received the Holy Ghost
[1:28:22] and then Peter says
[1:28:25] you see you see
[1:28:27] can you see now they've received the
[1:28:31] Holy Ghost
[1:28:33] so then can anyone object to them being
[1:28:35] baptized
[1:28:39] they've received the Holy Ghost just
[1:28:42] like we've received the Holy Name is
[1:28:46] the orders and every last one of them
[1:28:49] were baptized
[1:28:52] so this was a little bit different
[1:28:55] this was not baptism than holy ghosts
[1:29:00] these ones receive the Holy Ghost
[1:29:04] and then that drove them to the Waters
[1:29:07] of
[1:29:10] baptismales no but Brandon says in the
[1:29:12] message where is he King of the Jews
[1:29:17] the birth means we have been changed
[1:29:19] from our thinking
[1:29:24] from our attitudes Changed by the
[1:29:26] something that took place on the inside
[1:29:32] it took the blood of God's son Jesus
[1:29:35] Christ
[1:29:39] you don't need to join no churches
[1:29:45] no merits of your own
[1:29:49] I'm going to say this for the young
[1:29:51] people
[1:29:52] and you'll read it up there
[1:29:57] quit trying
[1:30:01] just receive it
[1:30:04] he's the one that's going to lead you to
[1:30:06] the life
[1:30:09] so quit trying for yourself
[1:30:13] just receive it tonight
[1:30:21] he'll take you to that new bird
[1:30:27] you know Young Brother young sister
[1:30:30] have you been born again
[1:30:35] I applaud you I I congratulate you
[1:30:39] I'm happy for you you know because one
[1:30:43] day I don't know whatever age you find
[1:30:46] yourself in right now
[1:30:48] but you're going to be wanting to search
[1:30:50] for a husband or a wife
[1:30:55] it's it's we could say it's inevitable
[1:31:00] a young brother young sister
[1:31:04] if you haven't been born again
[1:31:09] do your spouse a favor
[1:31:13] you know I wanted to say do yourself the
[1:31:16] favor
[1:31:19] but do your future spouse a favor
[1:31:24] you get the Holy Ghost for yourself
[1:31:27] first
[1:31:30] make sure you first are born again
[1:31:35] because you you have no idea the burden
[1:31:39] that you're going to be on your husband
[1:31:40] or your wife
[1:31:45] if you don't first have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:49] and you know it is going to sound a
[1:31:52] little mean
[1:31:55] but you know but young man
[1:31:58] if you're really going to seduce one of
[1:32:01] these young sisters
[1:32:04] and maybe even a young sister that does
[1:32:07] have the new birth
[1:32:11] you run the risk of potentially ruining
[1:32:14] her life
[1:32:18] if you're not on that Highway to Heaven
[1:32:21] yourself
[1:32:23] then you're going on the highway to hell
[1:32:27] and who do you think you're going to
[1:32:30] drag along with you
[1:32:33] and young ladies
[1:32:36] if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:39] you haven't been born again
[1:32:43] and used to do
[1:33:13] just let him do it in your life
[1:33:17] let him change you let him transform you
[1:33:20] tonight
[1:33:23] so the young
[1:33:29] Brothers you can lead a Godly woman
[1:33:35] you know don't expect her to follow you
[1:33:39] if she can't even follow Christ
[1:33:44] expect him to lead you a noise
[1:33:47] if he can't even be led by Christ
[1:33:55] he gets right to the point
[1:33:58] you're not converted till you get the
[1:34:01] holy ghosts
[1:34:08] you know the Miracles the walking on
[1:34:11] water they're giving the keys to the
[1:34:13] kingdoms
[1:34:17] he wasn't converted until that Upper
[1:34:20] Room experience
[1:34:32] you must be
[1:34:49] young people tonight if you're asking
[1:34:51] well then how will I know when will I
[1:34:53] know
[1:34:57] I can't discern Hearts
[1:34:59] corazones I can't look into the future
[1:35:02] of the past of your life
[1:35:06] I'll give you a simple quote
[1:35:09] you take it how you want it
[1:35:12] well could you this was from questions
[1:35:14] and answers uh 0 8 23.
[1:35:23] well could you imagine a mother giving
[1:35:25] birth to a baby and not know it is
[1:35:42] neither can you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:35:44] without knowing it
[1:35:48] there's something that takes place in
[1:35:51] you
[1:35:52] there's something that changes
[1:35:55] the whole system your whole spiritual
[1:35:58] system is made new again
[1:36:05] you become a new creature in Christ
[1:36:10] and you know
[1:36:14] know brother Branham also says that
[1:36:18] there will be thousands
[1:36:20] that will be baptized in Jesus name
[1:36:24] and I hate to believe it of one of our
[1:36:27] youth here tonight
[1:36:31] and I pray it's not one of our youth
[1:36:33] here tonight
[1:36:37] but you know you just go in a dry Center
[1:36:39] and you come out a wet ones
[1:36:45] the title was a genuine experience
[1:36:49] you know you can fake a baptism here
[1:36:54] because it's an outward expression
[1:36:59] it's something that you're showing
[1:37:01] everyone publicly
[1:37:03] is
[1:37:08] I've known so many people that have
[1:37:10] faked that in their life
[1:37:14] but what you can't face
[1:37:16] is the repentance that took place in
[1:37:20] your heart
[1:37:23] because you ain't fooling nobody
[1:37:26] but yourself
[1:37:29] this might fool somebody
[1:37:33] but the repentance in you is only
[1:37:35] fooling yourself
[1:37:42] in the message expectations
[1:37:47] it'll only come through the experience
[1:37:50] of the new birth
[1:37:52] experience a man cannot go to the
[1:37:56] kingdom of God without being born again
[1:38:01] without being born again
[1:38:05] says no more than a bird could fly
[1:38:08] without his wings
[1:38:14] what was it that you told me in the back
[1:38:17] brother uh you said you found a quote
[1:38:20] that said brother Branham said one can
[1:38:22] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost over
[1:38:24] and over and over and still go to hell
[1:38:26] and still be lost and forgive me and
[1:38:28] still be lost
[1:38:37] so we must be born again
[1:39:02] in the message questions and answers
[1:39:05] once again number one preached in uh
[1:39:07] zero one zero three and then upstairs
[1:39:16] but you say brother Bill did you ever
[1:39:20] baptize anybody over is
[1:39:27] who had been baptized when they was a
[1:39:29] little fellow and then be re-baptized
[1:39:35] many times
[1:39:38] says if you want to be baptized
[1:39:43] if that's something that's standing in
[1:39:46] your way
[1:39:48] and you feel like you should be used
[1:39:52] you should go do it
[1:39:55] that's right
[1:39:56] you go do it you said
[1:39:59] don't let nothing stand in your way
[1:40:03] you make yourself perfectly clear
[1:40:08] so it gives the example just like if
[1:40:15] you had taken something years ago
[1:40:21] and you feel like you should go and make
[1:40:23] it right
[1:40:26] no matter what it is
[1:40:28] you keep everything clearly
[1:40:32] because you'll come up to that thing
[1:40:35] and you can't go any farther till you
[1:40:38] get that out of the way you say no
[1:40:42] you've just got to lay aside every way
[1:40:44] and everything that easily besets
[1:40:51] and if you want to be baptized again
[1:40:57] that's the thing to do
[1:41:00] I've baptized
[1:41:05] and if you want to be baptized and but
[1:41:08] if you want to be baptized
[1:41:10] and you was baptized when he was 13.
[1:41:15] or whatever age it was
[1:41:18] you would be baptized if it's in your
[1:41:21] way
[1:41:33] now you don't have to be baptized to
[1:41:35] receive the holy ghosts
[1:41:41] we gave you examples
[1:41:44] from the Bible De La Biblia living
[1:41:47] examples today
[1:41:49] you can receive the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:41:54] if you were to receive the holy ghost
[1:41:59] that same Holy Ghost would Propel you is
[1:42:04] it would push you it would take you
[1:42:08] unto the Waters of baptism
[1:42:11] because there is still an opportunity
[1:42:19] Brother Bruno says like back in acts 2.
[1:42:24] when Peter gave the formula
[1:42:28] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:42:31] Christ
[1:42:34] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:42:36] Ghost
[1:42:40] you need to repent
[1:42:43] you need to have an experience of
[1:42:45] repentance first
[1:42:48] what he says
[1:42:52] yes God turned around
[1:42:55] and gave the Gentiles the baptism of the
[1:42:58] Holy ghosts
[1:43:01] he can give any one of us the baptism of
[1:43:04] the Holy ghosts
[1:43:11] he says you see it he said it's the
[1:43:15] condition of your heart
[1:43:19] is the condition of your heart tonight
[1:43:24] I can't tell you what it is
[1:43:27] but you know what that condition is
[1:43:32] you know if you've been living right
[1:43:36] you know if you've been living halfway
[1:43:38] life
[1:43:40] it's your heart and your condition is
[1:43:49] I spoke to a young sister
[1:43:52] and I asked for her permission
[1:43:54] to talk about her tonight
[1:43:57] you know we have a young sister here
[1:44:01] that blew me away
[1:44:05] about a month ago she shared her
[1:44:07] testimony for the Youth as soon
[1:44:11] of what God had just done in her life
[1:44:16] and you know if you were to know this
[1:44:18] young sister
[1:44:21] when you see her
[1:44:23] you can tell she's a good girl
[1:44:27] you can tell that she listens to her
[1:44:30] mother and her father
[1:44:33] you can tell that she dresses modest
[1:44:36] she's very respectful
[1:44:42] you know everything about her speaks
[1:44:44] about herself
[1:44:47] but who would have
[1:44:51] that she was at the end of the road
[1:44:56] that she didn't want nothing else to do
[1:44:58] with this this message
[1:45:02] with this Bible with this word of God
[1:45:08] that she was at the end of the road
[1:45:12] that she found herself one night
[1:45:16] very bothered molesta and her mother saw
[1:45:20] her all bothered is
[1:45:28] I noticed something's going on in you
[1:45:32] know and she started to confess her life
[1:45:35] to her mother
[1:45:37] and pour out the lifestyle that she was
[1:45:40] living
[1:45:49] lots of intentions of her heart
[1:45:54] that we're black is
[1:45:57] that we're full of sins
[1:46:00] she said Mom I don't want to go to
[1:46:02] church
[1:46:04] I don't want to have nothing to do with
[1:46:06] this no more
[1:46:08] that reminds me of Billy Paula de Billy
[1:46:11] Paul Mr Papa I I don't want to do this
[1:46:16] I'm done with this life
[1:46:19] and brother Brandon let him go yeah
[1:46:23] but this mother of this young lady
[1:46:26] had asked her she could pray for her
[1:46:31] and upon that prayer
[1:46:34] something happened in that young lady
[1:46:38] you know it doesn't always have to be a
[1:46:41] brother
[1:46:43] it doesn't always have to be a minister
[1:46:47] it was the love of a mother foreign
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:26] I need to get baptized
[1:48:29] I don't know how it's going to happen
[1:48:31] I don't know when where but I need to
[1:48:34] get baptized now
[1:48:37] that very next service
[1:48:40] we have the whole thing planned out
[1:48:43] God wiped it away
[1:48:45] said no we're gonna do it my way
[1:48:48] foreign
[1:49:35] and what's amazing
[1:49:37] that's why I read this quote
[1:49:39] she had been baptized before
[1:49:43] but she knew that that was not a genuine
[1:49:46] baptism
[1:49:51] anybody tonight
[1:49:54] if you haven't been baptized
[1:49:57] the invitation is open
[1:50:01] anybody
[1:50:03] if you haven't received the Holy ghosts
[1:50:06] you haven't been baptized yet
[1:50:10] the prophet said it himself
[1:50:14] need to be baptized to receive the Holy
[1:50:17] Spirit
[1:50:23] whatever position you are in tonight
[1:50:28] you have something that you need from
[1:50:31] God
[1:50:48] you bow your hands and close your eyes
[1:50:55] brother Branham says
[1:50:57] in the message the mark of the beast
[1:51:01] what a message he came in second
[1:51:04] now you're either one of these today
[1:51:09] there is no middle ground
[1:51:13] either you're the mark of the beast
[1:51:16] the world the apostate church
[1:51:20] or you're the Seal of God
[1:51:24] holy and acceptable
[1:51:28] there is no lukewarm DBS there's nothing
[1:51:32] in the middle
[1:51:34] are you born again
[1:51:36] does your life cope with his words
[1:51:40] does your actions does your life
[1:51:44] does your dressing does your behavior
[1:51:48] does your spirit and does your faith
[1:51:52] does it all cope with the word of God
[1:51:57] young people ask yourselves that tonight
[1:52:02] it's for you this service was for you
[1:52:06] so do something about it
[1:52:10] Lord Heavenly Father Celestial oh Lord
[1:52:14] God we thank you Lord Jesus
[1:52:17] for just speaking to us tonight
[1:52:20] Lord helping us understand
[1:52:23] the baptism starts with an experience
[1:52:28] repentance starts with an experience
[1:52:32] the new birth starts with an experience
[1:52:36] and Lord you have the perfect order set
[1:52:39] out for every one of your children
[1:52:44] whatever you want of your son and
[1:52:46] daughter tonight Lord

[1:52:52] lives

[1:52:59] the altar is open for them
[1:53:02] if they need you in their lives
[1:53:06] if they want to make a public display
[1:53:08] that they accept you as their lord and
[1:53:10] savior
[1:53:14] the waters are open tonight
[1:53:18] because we have the most important thing
[1:53:21] here in the building tonight
