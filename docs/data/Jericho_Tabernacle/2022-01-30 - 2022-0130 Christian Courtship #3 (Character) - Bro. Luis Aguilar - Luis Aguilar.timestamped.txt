[32:57] [Music]
[33:13] so
[33:21] [Music]
[33:30] [Music]
[34:10] for the honor and glory of the lord
[34:12] jesus christ
[34:17] in 2020 my mom was
[34:21] declared with cancer um
[34:23] [Music]
[34:25] and she struggled throughout the year
[34:27] with that cancer
[34:31] and last year at the beginning of 2021.
[34:34] um
[34:38] i became so desperate for her
[34:42] because i wanted it to
[34:45] hurt for her to be healed
[34:51] i also had a situation with a sibling
[34:54] that she doesn't want to come to church
[35:01] so i began to be desperate and ask the
[35:03] lord for those things
[35:08] [Music]
[35:10] so one week i
[35:12] study and
[35:14] i fast and pray um
[35:22] and everything i heard throughout that
[35:24] week it was it was just about the word
[35:26] of god
[35:28] [Music]
[35:31] and i didn't have that revelation or
[35:33] what was the
[35:34] or what was the the spoken word
[35:40] so i just kept asking and praying
[35:52] and to my surprise the title was
[35:55] speak the word um
[36:01] and another little thing it's about my
[36:03] daughter that she's here with me
[36:08] le pedia que quando el yala
[36:12] and one of the things i ask the lord is
[36:15] is before my husband served the lord i
[36:17] asked the lord to give me a daughter
[36:21] [Music]
[36:24] and as you know my husband has for four
[36:26] years serving the lord
[36:30] so we were just praying for it for for
[36:33] the for my daughter
[36:35] domingo
[36:37] sunday um yo entendi
[36:46] [Music]
[36:48] it revealed to me that speaking the word
[36:50] it's not just to spoke it out
[36:54] it's to speak out the word of the lord
[37:04] and as brother marco said everything we
[37:06] need it's within us
[37:10] like moses when he spoke to the rock
[37:15] he shouldn't smite a rock he should have
[37:17] spoke to it
[37:23] because
[37:24] god had already done all the miracles
[37:26] through him
[37:28] he should have he should have spoke the
[37:30] word anton says
[37:34] incrementally
[37:37] right in that moment my faith increased
[37:39] and i declared
[37:47] i remember that i said my mom is here
[37:50] because by your stripes we are healed me
[37:52] hermana family
[37:58] family
[37:59] i believe my sibling and my mom are
[38:02] going to be healed because your word
[38:03] says that
[38:04] if we believe in you we're going to be
[38:07] safe
[38:10] and i also said i'm going to have a
[38:12] daughter
[38:16] because your word says that anything we
[38:18] should ask we'll shall receive it
[38:26] that sunday i just felt something i
[38:28] never felt before
[38:34] in the past i have felt the holy spirit
[38:36] in my head or within my heart
[38:41] and that day i just felt
[38:44] the spirit in my womb
[38:53] i just had a jubilee and i accepted all
[38:55] my blessings
[39:00] i kept testifying i was i was going to
[39:02] have a daughter and my mom was going to
[39:04] be healed um
[39:09] i want to say that my mom was
[39:12] declared cancer free
[39:15] here
[39:19] my mom is not present either my siblings
[39:22] but i know they are healed
[39:25] saved oh i'm saved
[39:31] [Music]
[39:37] just to finish up i just want to say the
[39:39] lord is very detailed with us
[39:47] to me it's very precious that my
[39:48] daughter was born the october the 10th
[39:54] because that's the day brother branham
[39:56] spoke squirrels into existence
[40:00] a little red squirrel
[40:02] and that's the reason i call my daughter
[40:04] little red squirrel

[1:14:47] restart that courtship with your wife
[1:14:51] it shouldn't just stop when you get
[1:14:52] married
[1:14:54] amen amen amen
[1:14:56] you love the lord
[1:14:58] that's good if you love the lord you
[1:15:00] will eventually love me
[1:15:04] amen on this morning we're going to
[1:15:05] speak on on the subject of character
[1:15:08] established
[1:15:10] and we can open up our base scripture
[1:15:12] that we have
[1:15:14] i hope by now you already memorized it
[1:15:18] hebrews 13 4.
[1:15:22] says marriage is honorable law and the
[1:15:24] bed undefiled but whoremongers and
[1:15:27] adulterers god would judge
[1:15:32] us
[1:15:36] it says that the marriage should be
[1:15:38] honored by everyone
[1:15:41] you should honor marriage
[1:15:43] there's nothing something that you
[1:15:44] should take it out lightly
[1:15:47] and the marriage
[1:15:50] don't defile it uh no lo manche keep it
[1:15:53] pure a man
[1:15:55] but uh adulterers
[1:15:57] the fornicators
[1:15:59] and the sexually immoral morales
[1:16:04] you may take your seats
[1:16:06] um
[1:16:08] i hope i hope that uh
[1:16:10] you love me enough i hope i can stay in
[1:16:12] my time
[1:16:17] amen amen so here we we on
[1:16:20] last sunday we spoke on the foundation
[1:16:24] then on friday we spoke about christian
[1:16:26] friends
[1:16:29] christianos and today we want to kind of
[1:16:31] try to touch the surface of courtship
[1:16:36] and courtship is that i gave the
[1:16:38] definition of courtship
[1:16:42] it says it's the act or process of
[1:16:44] period of courting is
[1:16:54] here the definition says it's a period
[1:16:56] of time when you're recording
[1:17:13] and we've had many examples where
[1:17:15] brother branham will always be courting
[1:17:18] his wife
[1:17:22] even though he was already married
[1:17:24] amen amen
[1:17:26] and what is the importance of courtship
[1:17:29] in this stage you want to completely woo
[1:17:31] or win over the other person
[1:17:36] you never want to stop being in that
[1:17:38] stage
[1:17:40] that stage you really want to find out
[1:17:42] the character of one another
[1:17:46] there you want to show your best
[1:17:47] attributes
[1:17:50] you can come and you bring her a flower
[1:17:53] you can come and she can bring you
[1:17:55] something
[1:17:57] but there you really want to complete
[1:17:58] you want to uh win each other
[1:18:03] and like again you want to look at the
[1:18:05] character
[1:18:07] that that's a very important stage
[1:18:10] because people just think of courtship
[1:18:12] they think it's just a lovey-dovey stage
[1:18:19] but really and truly we should come
[1:18:21] really wise with that stage
[1:18:40] notice when they're in the fellowship
[1:18:43] notice how that young man talks to his
[1:18:44] mom and dad
[1:18:47] and vice versa how the young lady talks
[1:18:49] to her mom and dad
[1:18:51] because we should be looking for
[1:18:53] character
[1:18:56] even though she has a pretty set of eyes
[1:18:59] even though she might seem really nice
[1:19:02] or he might preach really nicely
[1:19:04] but that's that's good whatnot
[1:19:22] when we hear the phrase in spanish that
[1:19:24] that sister she's got a character
[1:19:27] that brother he's got a character el
[1:19:29] espanol
[1:19:31] the hispanic uses the word character
[1:19:33] like a type of attitude or temperament
[1:19:35] amen amen but brother branham
[1:19:39] he's a prophet
[1:19:41] we have to understand how the prophet
[1:19:43] speaks
[1:19:45] when he says character
[1:19:47] he's not talking about the temperament
[1:19:49] of a person
[1:19:52] he's talking about characteristics
[1:19:54] characteristics we've noticed moses
[1:19:58] did he marry a dove
[1:20:01] paloma
[1:20:06] not one amen but everybody laughed
[1:20:12] she was brother brown said she was a
[1:20:14] chainsaw el mano brand name
[1:20:24] so
[1:20:24] if my wife wants to fight with me and i
[1:20:26] fight with her
[1:20:30] that means
[1:20:43] they were both polishing each other
[1:20:55] oh god i wish you gave me the wife like
[1:20:57] that brother
[1:21:11] is
[1:21:25] where the knife is going to be sharpened
[1:21:27] amen amen
[1:21:33] so the woman helps the man get into his
[1:21:35] position amen amen
[1:21:37] amen
[1:21:38] so it's
[1:21:40] character character is one of the
[1:21:43] attributes or features
[1:21:45] of characteristics that make up and
[1:21:47] distinguish an individual component
[1:21:51] so brother ram says look for character
[1:21:54] it doesn't say
[1:22:04] so we want to see how that person is
[1:22:07] individual how they behave
[1:22:13] is to see how he or she treats her
[1:22:16] parents
[1:22:22] it's house how he or she treats
[1:22:24] their parents
[1:22:27] why brother luis
[1:22:30] if he
[1:22:31] wants to fight his mom and dad all the
[1:22:32] time
[1:22:35] and disrespects his mom all the time
[1:23:04] when i see someone disrespecting another
[1:23:06] person
[1:23:08] and talking to him really rudely
[1:23:12] but they want to
[1:23:13] pray really nice and sweet to the lord
[1:23:17] the way you talk to each and every
[1:23:19] single one of us
[1:23:22] that's how you pray to god
[1:23:26] if you think about it
[1:23:28] and the way you treat your husband
[1:23:31] that's how you treat god
[1:24:00] they don't confess
[1:24:28] a time and a place for that
[1:24:31] amen amen oh if you leave me i'm going
[1:24:34] to go back to drugs i'm going to go i'm
[1:24:35] going to stop going to church
[1:24:37] no brother don't do that
[1:24:39] amen amen
[1:24:42] very few amen
[1:24:44] you want to show the best qualities of
[1:24:46] yourself
[1:24:50] let's go to genesis 24.
[1:24:53] on the second verse
[1:24:56] and abraham said unto his eldest servant
[1:24:58] of his house
[1:25:00] that ruled over all that he had
[1:25:02] put i pray thee thy hand o under my
[1:25:04] thighs
[1:25:14] and i will make they swear by the lord
[1:25:17] the god of heaven and the god of the
[1:25:18] earth that thou shalt not take a wife
[1:25:20] onto my son of the daughters of the
[1:25:22] canaanites among whom i dwell
[1:25:35] what are we reading about here the
[1:25:36] question
[1:25:37] wording about when isaac already
[1:25:39] research reached a certain age
[1:25:43] he he already knew his responsibilities
[1:25:47] abraham was getting old
[1:25:49] and he felt it was time for isaac to
[1:25:51] have a wife
[1:26:05] i'm going to make you swear
[1:26:21] verse 4 says but thou shalt go on to my
[1:26:23] country
[1:26:28] and take a wife onto my son isaac
[1:26:32] so they're there we're proving with the
[1:26:34] scriptures
[1:26:48] the testimony of
[1:27:01] on their
[1:27:02] testimonies going to say that again
[1:27:05] we cannot base ourselves on their
[1:27:07] testimony
[1:27:09] we have to base ourselves on the word of
[1:27:11] god
[1:27:13] so he was saying go go to my country to
[1:27:16] my kingdom
[1:27:44] according to the law
[1:27:46] and was brought up in a religious home
[1:27:50] to believe on jehovah
[1:27:54] so notice ahab he had some good roots
[1:27:58] he
[1:28:12] fell in love with some little i'm going
[1:28:14] to say how brother branham says it
[1:28:17] is some flapped eye thing of an idolater
[1:28:25] hey man you love the lord amen
[1:28:28] man
[1:28:29] brother braham says that's right this is
[1:28:32] and today
[1:28:33] fine christian men buenos ombres
[1:28:36] cristianos are
[1:28:38] fell under the the sway of such nonsense
[1:28:41] and glamour
[1:28:42] dominion
[1:28:45] because their that heart hasn't been
[1:28:47] stable in christ jesus
[1:28:50] christ
[1:28:52] why do they fall for women like that
[1:29:07] look for someone who works out
[1:29:20] uh christians are merry christians
[1:29:22] cristianos
[1:29:25] brother ram says you see ahab was
[1:29:26] reigning in israel
[1:29:29] and israel at the time over israel
[1:29:32] israel he was the wickedest kings of all
[1:29:35] of israel
[1:29:48] he failed not to continue to please to
[1:29:50] displease god and everything that he did
[1:29:56] although he had a great military system
[1:30:00] and the people had become become very
[1:30:02] prosperous under his reign
[1:30:16] instead of marrying among his own people
[1:30:54] no doubt jezebel was a beautiful woman
[1:30:58] but he had fell for what she looked like
[1:31:03] instead of what she was
[1:31:06] that so many people make the same
[1:31:08] mistake to this day
[1:31:13] we fall because she wears a nice dress
[1:31:17] because she comes from a renowned named
[1:31:19] family
[1:31:22] and he looked like a really good
[1:31:23] gentleman
[1:31:26] we fall for what they look like
[1:31:29] instead of who they are
[1:31:31] it doesn't matter if they come from a
[1:31:33] renown family
[1:31:35] or they always come to church
[1:31:38] you have to look at their character
[1:31:42] look how they behave look how they act
[1:31:45] there's many people that that are that
[1:31:46] come here to church
[1:31:49] but they're not christians
[1:31:51] i'm going to say that again
[1:31:53] there's people that come to church
[1:31:55] but they're not really
[1:32:10] you stay away from
[1:32:11] [Laughter]
[1:32:24] because it's
[1:32:52] if the sisters keep talking about about
[1:32:53] the whole brothers about the church
[1:33:03] characteristics characteristics look for
[1:33:06] characters
[1:33:08] well brother i married someone here from
[1:33:09] church
[1:33:11] from the world
[1:33:12] yeah yeah but i'm taking it higher than
[1:33:14] that
[1:33:17] there's christians there are people here
[1:33:18] that are not really christians
[1:33:30] amen amen
[1:33:32] genesis 24 9. uh
[1:33:38] and the servant put his hand under the
[1:33:39] thigh of abraham his master
[1:33:45] and swear to him concerning the matter
[1:33:48] and the servant took 10 camels
[1:33:52] of his master
[1:33:54] and departed
[1:33:56] for all the goods of his master were in
[1:33:58] his hand
[1:34:02] and he arose and went to mesopotamia
[1:34:06] on to the city of nehora
[1:34:08] so what do we see here there in the
[1:34:09] tenth verse
[1:34:13] what i put
[1:34:15] is that i put that he was preparing
[1:34:17] himself
[1:34:19] that he was getting ready
[1:34:21] and later on as we continue this
[1:34:24] we're going to talk about how a young
[1:34:26] man should prepare himself in the
[1:34:27] natural vamos a ver como joben
[1:34:31] it's going to say good
[1:34:33] when a young man wants to marry a young
[1:34:35] lady
[1:34:37] and tells her how would i marry you
[1:34:41] you think that he should tell his
[1:34:42] father-in-law to pay for the wedding
[1:35:00] you someone say that again
[1:35:01] i'm gonna nail it really good right here
[1:35:04] so you can get ready for the next time
[1:35:07] if a young man wants to marry a young
[1:35:09] lady
[1:35:11] if i ever the lord ever gives
[1:35:24] is
[1:35:41] love that's what i'm saying young ladies
[1:35:42] you should look for those
[1:35:43] characteristics
[1:35:46] i want to marry you honey
[1:35:48] but can your dad sign us a check
[1:35:52] check
[1:35:56] so there i put on 10 first that he's
[1:35:58] preparing himself
[1:36:02] he's preparing he's getting everything
[1:36:04] ready to go and and to look for a wife
[1:36:09] and he made his he made his camels to
[1:36:11] kneel down
[1:36:12] without the city by the well of the
[1:36:14] water at the time of the evening
[1:36:16] even the time that with the women go out
[1:36:18] to draw water
[1:36:29] and he said oh lord of god of my master
[1:36:32] abraham i pray thee
[1:36:34] send me good speed this day and show
[1:36:36] kindness unto my master abraham
[1:36:41] abram
[1:36:47] now you notice what he did
[1:36:49] what did he do
[1:36:51] he prayed
[1:36:53] as soon as he got everything ready
[1:36:56] he got the holy ghost
[1:36:58] he was ready
[1:36:59] uh materialistic
[1:37:03] after that he prayed
[1:37:06] he said god help me today
[1:37:09] that's the first thing you're supposed
[1:37:11] to do to seek after a while
[1:37:14] he prayed to seek after god
[1:37:17] he said god help me today may i have
[1:37:20] success today
[1:37:23] oh lord my god help me to have success
[1:37:25] to look for a good wife
[1:37:28] the first thing he did was pray
[1:37:31] he didn't go started looking talking
[1:37:46] behold i
[1:37:55] and notice right here he's gonna he's
[1:37:57] going to pray for a certain character
[1:38:08] he's going to pray for something to make
[1:38:09] her different amongst all the others
[1:38:14] they may all
[1:38:26] and he says and let it come to pass
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:43] drink and i will give that camel's drink
[1:38:44] also
[1:38:47] let the same bee that be let the
[1:38:50] same beachy that thou has appointed for
[1:38:52] thy servant isaac
[1:38:57] and thereby shall i know that thou has
[1:38:59] shown kindness onto my master
[1:39:04] what was he praying for certain
[1:39:05] characteristics
[1:39:08] praying for certain features
[1:39:10] to make
[1:39:25] gabriel there was many women out there
[1:39:27] and and
[1:39:28] all of the city there yeah
[1:39:31] but gabriel came to one in pacific
[1:39:35] she kept her virtues
[1:39:37] she kept her dignity
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:18] god has to back up his word
[1:40:48] rebecca
[1:41:00] that's that's sweet that's a good little
[1:41:02] nugget oh
[1:41:13] and her picture upon her shoulder
[1:41:17] i would like to
[1:41:18] see the young ladies with their bible
[1:41:20] under their arm
[1:41:24] we probably won't obviously carry a
[1:41:26] picture
[1:41:29] but when a young lady carries her bible
[1:41:33] coming to church
[1:41:37] but let us not forget our ipads and our
[1:41:40] phones and our purses
[1:41:46] that's that's fine but i have the bible
[1:41:48] in here
[1:41:52] characteristics characteristics
[1:41:55] 16 yes he says notice nothing and the
[1:41:58] damsel was very fair to look upon
[1:42:02] them
[1:42:05] and hearing spanish says it really
[1:42:06] directly it means she was very pretty
[1:42:13] a virgin vitikin neither had any man
[1:42:16] known her
[1:42:18] on friday we spoke about those virtues
[1:42:22] how many of you went back to the
[1:42:23] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:42:27] go back to that message
[1:42:29] he speaks about the virtues that a woman
[1:42:31] should keep elaborated
[1:42:34] her virginity
[1:42:36] or feminism
[1:42:37] for motherhood so maternity she should
[1:42:39] keep that las vegas
[1:43:05] and notice here there's a bigger
[1:43:06] responsibility
[1:43:09] that's why the parents shouldn't let
[1:43:10] their daughters just go with any man
[1:43:19] no he's the son of a minister sometimes
[1:43:21] they're the most
[1:43:48] you're responsible for that
[1:44:19] young ladies keep your virtues
[1:44:23] amen
[1:44:25] young parents don't let their daughters
[1:44:26] dress immorally
[1:44:30] don't let them walk out the house that
[1:44:31] way
[1:44:32] in the casa
[1:44:37] and the servant ran to meet her
[1:44:42] nothing he prayed
[1:44:44] for a woman like this
[1:45:00] sometimes that's what we need
[1:45:03] a little bit of courage
[1:45:07] go up to her
[1:45:10] if you've already prayed and you've
[1:45:11] already reached your requirements yes
[1:45:29] let me i pray they drink a little water
[1:45:31] of thy pitcher
[1:45:34] and she said drink my lord
[1:45:37] and she hates it let down her picture up
[1:45:39] upon her hand and gave me drink he gave
[1:45:41] him a drink
[1:45:52] also until they have done drinking
[1:45:56] water
[1:46:10] and ran again to the well to draw water
[1:46:12] and drew for all of his camels
[1:46:17] if the brother can put that image there
[1:46:18] for me
[1:46:21] i want to see what was a throw que

[1:46:49] gallons
[1:46:51] i don't know what was the this this is
[1:46:53] between the whale and where the camels
[1:46:54] were okay
[1:46:58] they probably drink about 10 or 15
[1:46:59] gallons each 20 gallons each pizzas
[1:47:03] come back and put it again
[1:47:06] come back and
[1:47:18] he was praying for certain
[1:47:19] characteristics
[1:47:31] come on brother don't do this to me no
[1:47:33] the young lady shouldn't be tired
[1:47:36] to come to church
[1:47:39] to show those characteristics
[1:47:41] a man amen
[1:47:43] well brother i i i don't the young lady
[1:47:45] should show the effort to come to church
[1:48:02] we want to
[1:48:30] amen amen
[1:48:32] on the 21st verse
[1:48:36] and the man wondering wandering at her
[1:48:38] held his peace
[1:48:42] to it whether the lord has made his
[1:48:44] journey prosperous or not
[1:48:49] prospered
[1:48:54] he just watched her
[1:48:57] god already showed her that she was the
[1:48:59] one
[1:49:02] god showed him
[1:49:04] but he's he's he just he just kept his
[1:49:07] peace
[1:49:09] he didn't say anything
[1:49:11] he just watched her el solomon

[1:49:44] i'm going to say it again
[1:49:45] you should wait
[1:49:48] or it's not god
[1:49:51] and they came to pass as the camels had

[1:50:07] weight of gold
[1:50:32] we have both straw and provender enough

[1:51:40] branham
[1:51:43] if it makes him uncomfortable
[1:51:45] that's already a sign yeah
[1:51:48] that he's probably not the one
[1:51:51] if you talk about the lord with her
[1:51:53] and she doesn't want to come to church
[1:51:56] and it makes her uncomfortable
[1:51:58] that should already be assigned to you

[2:04:16] without being a bad man
[2:04:21] a man can be bad unless there's a bad
[2:04:22] woman
[2:04:42] aren't you the one that's higher a

[2:06:01] this nature that we have is very
[2:06:03] tremendous
[2:06:06] and no one is except exempt from it
[2:06:09] if we notice joseph in the bible
[2:06:13] where joseph was bought by
[2:06:15] uh
[2:06:16] potiphar josef
[2:06:19] i remember how do you remember joseph in
[2:06:21] the bible
[2:06:23] he was sold by his brethren
[2:06:26] made it to egypt
[2:06:28] and this man
[2:06:40] he saw the jokes of everything that
[2:06:41] joseph did
[2:07:24] and she said joseph lie with me
[2:07:27] come with me
[2:07:29] i'm not going to do that
[2:07:31] how am i going to commit this wickedness
[2:07:32] and sin against god
[2:07:36] when that something's presented you
[2:07:37] should be a man of god
[2:07:51] and then she started to yell all over
[2:07:53] the house
[2:07:55] and say you see you look this is miraben
[2:07:57] we bring this this
[2:07:59] pedocyte into our house
[2:08:02] and now he was trying to be with me
[2:08:06] he stood for the word of god
[2:08:08] he stood for his principles
[2:08:10] he stood for his testimony
[2:08:13] nobody was watching him
[2:08:15] but he knew that god was watching
[2:08:18] he said how can i commit this wickedness
[2:08:51] you read in scripture you read his story
[2:08:54] but you've noticed even joseph
[2:08:56] jose he was presented with temptation
[2:09:00] but he stood with his principles
[2:09:16] stay away from them
[2:09:18] that's not right
[2:09:20] amen amen we're going to be closing
[2:09:23] pretty soon
[2:09:25] if you notice here that we get those
[2:09:27] anointments
[2:09:30] they come to
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:28] first corinthians chapter 6
[2:10:32] verse 12.
[2:10:36] amen you love the lord
[2:10:39] here foster paul says
[2:10:43] all things are lawful onto me
[2:10:46] but all things are not expedient
[2:10:49] all things are lawful for me
[2:10:52] but i will not be brought under the
[2:10:53] power of any
[2:11:38] [Applause]
[2:11:50] can i use this phone to
[2:11:52] to dig a hole
[2:11:56] i mean you can try
[2:11:58] but was it made for that pero
[2:12:02] aguero
[2:12:17] it's not for fornication
[2:12:20] but it's for the lord
[2:12:22] that's what's his body is foreign
[2:13:14] foreign
[2:13:40] and god has both raised up the lord
[2:13:46] and i will raise up
[2:13:48] raise up us by his own power
[2:13:53] so he raised up the lord
[2:13:56] amen
[2:13:57] calvary it was barry
[2:14:01] he was there in a too many he raised up
[2:14:03] the lord
[2:14:05] he raised up the lord from the dead
[2:14:08] and he will raise us also
[2:14:21] corinthians
[2:14:30] how can you raise up something that's
[2:14:32] not right
[2:14:37] no you're not that your bodies or the
[2:14:39] members of christ
[2:14:43] shall i then take the members of christ
[2:14:45] and put in the members of harlot
[2:14:53] so here
[2:14:54] aki do you have a body
[2:14:57] in our body we have many members
[2:15:02] if i commit fornication
[2:15:05] that only my member
[2:15:07] commit that sin or my whole body does it
[2:15:09] solamente
[2:15:15] the whole body
[2:15:21] if the members
[2:15:22] commit adultery
[2:15:25] and the whole body
[2:15:27] commits adultery
[2:15:30] the whole body is guilty
[2:15:32] but i said but i didn't do it
[2:16:02] he shall be one flesh
[2:16:06] do not know that he that unites himself
[2:16:08] with a prostitute is with one body
[2:16:12] but he that is joined unto the lord is
[2:16:14] one spirit
[2:16:26] what does your bible say
[2:16:29] what version of bible do you read
[2:16:58] sometimes because the celeste likes it
[2:17:01] we look back
[2:17:03] we say bye
[2:17:05] fornication
[2:17:08] every sin that a man doeth is without
[2:17:10] the body
[2:17:40] are you
[2:17:41] being single
[2:17:43] no no no you're not you're not complete
[2:17:45] yet
[2:17:47] when you fornicate
[2:17:49] you fornicate against your own body
[2:17:51] that's foreign
[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:18:02] you fornicate against your own body
[2:18:06] against the wife that god has given him
[2:18:21] i know you're maybe not understanding
[2:19:05] for you were bought with a price
[2:19:09] you you just weren't taken away
[2:19:12] you were bought with the prize
[2:19:14] now you're his property
[2:19:17] so therefore

[2:19:23] in your body and to how do you glorify
[2:19:26] the lord in your body
[2:19:28] stay away from fornication
