[31:07] foreign
[31:14] [Music]
[31:29] reaching the precious name of our Lord
[31:30] Jesus Christ
[31:34] just as we're standing if we could
[31:35] please bow our heads
[31:37] foreign
[31:47] [Music]
[31:53] there's various people here
[31:57] and because of that there's different
[31:59] needs here
[32:01] just as the prophet
[32:04] he didn't know the person
[32:07] he didn't know what they needed
[32:11] but you through the spirit would
[32:13] Minister unto that person
[32:15] I'm not the prophet Lord
[32:18] but I'm just a servant of yours
[32:23] I don't know the need of the people
[32:27] but I ask that you would Minister unto
[32:30] that need glorious May the glory always
[32:34] be for thee
[32:36] we put ourselves in your hands Lord
[32:39] asking of the help
[32:43] we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:46] Christ amen amen
[32:48] uh
[32:52] just as you're standing I like to read
[32:54] in two parts in the Bible
[32:58] the first one is in Ephesians chapter 2.
[33:01] verse 20.
[33:18] and are built upon the foundation of the
[33:21] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[33:22] himself being the chief
[33:26] cornerstoneado president
[33:30] in whom all the building fitly framed
[33:33] together groweth unto a holy Temple in
[33:35] the Lord
[33:41] in whom you also are building together
[33:43] for inhabitation of God through the
[33:45] spirit
[33:48] now the second scripture
[33:51] it's in Psalms 118.
[33:54] verse 22.
[34:08] the stone which the builders refused has
[34:11] become The Headstone of the corner
[34:14] may God bless the region of the word you
[34:18] may be seated
[34:25] this evening I want to speak about the
[34:27] Cornerstone
[34:30] we know that the Cornerstone is
[34:32] fundamental it's the foundation
[34:37] now in the last month uh
[34:43] principal I've studied a main theme
[34:47] of the message of the Bible
[34:54] and that is that God makes his
[34:56] redemption in those particles in two
[34:59] parts
[35:00] that's what brother Brandon says
[35:04] God's Redemption is in two parts
[35:09] that's why you find that there are two
[35:11] stones
[35:13] there is a Cornerstone
[35:15] and there is a Capstone
[35:18] as the Bible says he is Alpha Omega and
[35:22] Omega the beginning
[35:27] and the finisher of our faith
[35:31] both parts
[35:33] this
[35:36] evening I want to speak on the
[35:38] cornerstone
[35:40] and as we just read the Cornerstone is
[35:42] Jesus Christ
[35:44] now this Stone avenido indifferentes
[35:48] it's come in different phases
[35:52] first it was manifested
[35:56] in Solomon's Temple
[35:58] being a literal Stone
[36:01] they have to use
[36:03] to build that literal Temple
[36:06] then another Temple
[36:09] the one which is which was the Lord
[36:12] Jesus Christ
[36:13] then there's another Temple which is you
[36:17] all
[36:23] it has to do with every one of those
[36:26] temples
[36:28] now when Jesus Christ himself came in La
[36:31] carne In the Flesh
[36:34] he was that Cornerstone
[36:38] now when he came
[36:41] he had a certain message that he
[36:44] preached Elizabeth I'm going to give you
[36:46] the scriptures
[36:49] before Jesus Christ came
[36:52] he had someone that came before him
[36:55] who was John the Baptist
[37:10] in those days Came John the Baptist
[37:12] preaching in the wilderness of Judea it
[37:15] is
[37:19] and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of
[37:22] Heaven is at hand
[37:25] that's the main theme
[37:36] the Kingdom of Heaven has come now is at
[37:39] hand
[37:42] now that was John the Baptist
[37:46] also the Cornerstone
[37:48] it's coming phases or in waves in
[37:54] Opportunities
[37:56] Time After Time After Time
[37:59] the Bible says they rejected it
[38:02] the Bible says
[38:05] that God is rich in Mercy opportunity he
[38:10] gives opportunity after opportunity
[38:13] for you to accept that stone
[38:15] for you to accept Jesus Christ
[38:32] when he speaks of Jesus
[38:35] in Matthew 4 17.
[38:39] Jesus
[38:45] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[38:48] to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[38:51] is at hand Juan Jesus John and Jesus
[38:55] they preached the same message
[38:59] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[39:06] in opportunities
[39:11] the next phase
[39:14] after John either Jesus and Jesus
[39:16] foreign
[39:37] these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded
[39:39] them saying go not into the way of the
[39:42] Gentiles and into any City the
[39:44] Samaritans entered
[39:46] that stone environment
[39:49] first came to a single people to Israel
[39:53] Jesus that's what Jesus is here no wine
[39:57] don't go with the Gentiles
[40:02] but since it's in phases it's in waves
[40:07] opportunity God gives opportunity after
[40:10] opportunity
[40:13] and then him seeing they don't accept
[40:15] the opportunity
[40:17] he gives the opportunity to another
[40:19] person
[40:23] God first gave the opportunity to Israel
[40:27] but since they rejected
[40:29] that opportunity
[40:31] now it's given unto you
[40:35] but that's in phases it's
[40:40] opportunity after opportunity
[40:42] that God gives
[40:45] God is rich in his Mercy
[40:48] opportunity he gives the opportunity
[40:51] after opportunity
[41:12] and look at what the message is
[41:15] that Jesus gives his disciples
[41:21] as you go preach saying the Kingdom of
[41:25] Heaven is at hand
[41:49] is at hand unto you
[41:57] is an exposition of the seven Church
[41:59] ages
[42:00] the Philadelphian Church age
[42:09] the very first introduction we have in
[42:11] the way the kingdom of God was to be
[42:13] breached
[42:14] foreign
[42:35] this ministry that he gave them was
[42:37] actually the sharing of his own Ministry
[42:39] Jesus so when Jesus is
[42:44] the
[42:48] the main Stone of the corner
[42:53] without him there's nothing
[42:58] he's the main Stone that's needed
[43:00] principal
[43:04] he's the the main thing in the temple of
[43:06] the Lord
[43:08] from that stone
[43:11] everything else is expanded
[43:14] fundamental first of all you need to
[43:16] start with the foundation
[43:18] and the foundation is Jesus Christ
[43:24] you cannot expand it you cannot grow
[43:28] Jesus so Jesus he
[43:36] expanded with his disciples when he was
[43:39] here on the Earth
[43:41] foreign
[44:19] aura
[44:20] Isa Piedra now that stone no solamente
[44:24] it's not just a stone
[44:27] that stone represent something
[44:29] representative brother Brandon says that
[44:31] it represents
[44:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:38] so first of all that's
[44:41] Jesus it was manifested in Jesus
[44:45] then it was manifested in the spirit
[44:49] at the day of Pentecost
[45:12] so Jesus gave power unto the disciples
[45:17] they did not have the power of the new
[45:20] birth
[45:21] though they did what he said
[45:25] they were limited in the power that they
[45:27] had
[45:28] until finally that stone Jesus Christ
[45:31] Jesus Christ in the form of a spirit he
[45:35] entered into them at the day of
[45:37] Pentecost
[45:58] is a covenant
[46:03] so for example let us say that someone
[46:06] buys something
[46:08] let's say when someone purchases a cell
[46:10] phone they buy something
[46:15] they have to read the terms and
[46:17] conditions of what they're purchasing
[46:19] but normally what we all do
[46:23] we just do like this in school and then
[46:26] we accept it
[46:29] we don't read what the terms and
[46:31] conditions are
[46:33] this Cornerstone
[46:36] it has plenty terms and conditions
[46:42] that the Covenant of Grace is
[46:46] an unconditional Covenant um
[47:05] everything's based upon what I'm going
[47:07] to do for you I'm muchos beneficios
[47:10] there's many benefits
[47:14] they're a company that Cornerstone
[47:22] and then finally when Jesus died he
[47:25] resurrected
[47:27] and he was going to ascend into heaven
[47:31] once again he gave the commission unto
[47:33] his men and Marcos this is in March 16
[47:36] verse 15. this is
[47:42] all the world and preach the gospel to
[47:45] Every Creature
[47:51] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[47:53] shall be damned is
[47:59] and these signs to follow them that
[48:01] believe in my name shall they cast out
[48:04] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[48:15] they shall take up serpents and if they
[48:17] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[48:19] them they shall lay their hand hands on
[48:21] the sick and they shall
[48:22] recovery
[48:25] observe the power that they were going
[48:27] to have
[48:29] the Cornerstone first of all
[48:33] it was Jesus here on the earth
[48:35] and when he was on the earth
[48:38] he did these same things
[48:53] it was Jesus Christ
[48:56] the same Stone
[48:59] now in his disciples
[49:01] doing the same thing
[49:05] Jesus Christ did when he was here on the
[49:07] earth
[49:09] without that stone usted
[49:12] as you cannot do this foreign
[49:18] without him there's nothing
[49:37] you say
[49:40] paragraph 108.
[49:44] when the man was made in the image of
[49:46] God
[49:49] and then God came down in the image of
[49:52] man to redeem man
[49:55] that brought man and God together
[49:59] remember the message
[50:02] was that the kingdom of heaven
[50:08] so he says that when God descended
[50:13] in the image of man to redeem man
[50:17] that brought man and God together
[50:21] heavens and earth
[50:38] isotos and sonship when the logos became
[50:41] flesh and dwelt among us
[50:43] so that when Jesus came here
[50:47] in his literal body
[50:52] is that the kingdom of heaven was at
[50:55] hand unto them
[50:56] because the same King that was in heaven
[51:01] he became human flesh
[51:04] to be with them
[51:09] and restore them
[51:11] redeem them
[51:14] remember
[51:16] that the Redemption is in two parts the
[51:20] first part is the Cornerstone
[51:43] [Music]
[51:55] how many know that brother Brandon was
[51:57] given a prophecy in French
[52:09] and I would like to read this note is
[52:12] this is the original note of one of them
[52:16] and it was from this man that had
[52:19] interpreted
[52:21] I may not be able to call his names is
[52:23] Right Ladue Ladue Victor Ledoux Victor
[52:26] Ladue Francis he's a full-blooded
[52:30] Frenchman
[52:31] now here's the message
[52:36] now remember the message the disciples
[52:38] preached
[52:41] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand now the
[52:45] prophecy is
[52:48] because that was chosen the Narrow Path
[52:51] the harder way
[52:55] Dallas walked of your own shoes
[53:00] that was picked the correct and precise
[53:02] decision yes and it is my way
[53:07] because of this momentous decision
[53:14] a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee Los
[53:19] Cielos
[53:20] the the kingdom of Heavens is at hand
[53:23] it's
[53:24] the same message
[53:31] what a huge what a glorious decision
[53:39] this in itself is is that which got
[53:42] which which will give and may come to
[53:44] pass the tremendous victory in love
[53:46] divine
[53:48] now I don't know if it passed over one
[53:50] of you but this is how I used to think
[53:54] I used to think that when the heaven
[53:56] came unto brother Brandon
[53:59] he was going to have a huge section that
[54:02] pertained to him
[54:05] [Music]
[54:35] a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[54:39] now that's what I wondered when I die
[54:44] will it be then I happen to think
[54:51] Heaven is not portioned off to different
[54:53] portions to us up there
[54:55] is
[54:57] the Kingdom of Heaven
[55:01] that's within us foreign
[56:14] but you're still trapped here on this
[56:16] earth
[56:17] now there's a second Redemption of the
[56:20] Cornerstone
[56:33] and then a Capstone
[56:37] are those gracias now there's two Graces
[56:39] now Gracia de salvation the grace of
[56:42] Salvation
[56:43] now there's a second grace
[56:49] of rapture or Rapture in Grace
[56:52] now this is in two parts
[56:56] not everyone can receive the second part
[56:59] is
[57:01] but you're so fortunate to have this
[57:05] message
[57:07] because this message has both parts
[57:11] now it corresponds to you is
[57:15] to get that this message
[57:17] enters in you
[57:26] you don't have to go search anywhere
[57:28] else you need to search in the message
[57:32] both parts
[57:34] both redemptions
[57:36] both Graces
[57:38] both Stones
[57:41] they're in this message
[57:44] you don't have to go search anywhere
[57:46] else it's right here
[57:48] is it possible for a person
[57:53] to have both parts in them
[57:56] yes it's possible
[57:59] it's very possible
[58:04] how about a recording now remember
[58:09] that stone first came unto Israel and it
[58:13] came in phases
[58:15] in opportunities
[58:21] that you would accept it
[58:23] he blinded them
[58:26] even though he gave opportunity after
[58:28] opportunity foreign
[59:01] it says
[59:03] hombre
[59:07] padre de Familia planton Avenue
[59:17] here another Parable there was a certain
[59:19] householder which planted a Vineyard and
[59:21] hedged it round about and dig the wine
[59:24] press in it and built a tower and let it
[59:26] out to the husbandmen and went into the
[59:28] far country
[59:34] and when the time of the fruit junior he
[59:37] sent his servants to the husbandmen that
[59:39] they might receive the fruits of it
[59:42] now I want you to see the waves the
[59:46] phases
[59:48] the opportunities that this man gives
[59:58] and the husbandman took the servants and
[1:00:01] beat one and killed another and stoned
[1:00:03] another
[1:00:05] and again he said other servants
[1:00:08] more than the first
[1:00:12] and they did unto them likewise
[1:00:20] he sent unto them his son saying they
[1:00:23] will have reverence my son Maslow's
[1:00:25] labradores
[1:00:27] but the husband saw the sun
[1:00:30] they said amongst themselves
[1:00:32] this is the air beneath come let us kill
[1:00:36] him
[1:00:39] and let us seize on his inheritance
[1:00:44] and they caught him and cast him out of
[1:00:46] the vineyard and slew him
[1:00:49] when the Lord therefore
[1:01:04] and we'll let out his Vineyard until
[1:01:07] other husbandmen
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:11] God gives multiple opportunities
[1:01:16] and it's got to be a very bad mistake
[1:01:21] for God to take away that opportunity
[1:01:24] and give it unto another but like I said
[1:01:30] that is rich in Mercy
[1:01:33] he gives the opportunity after
[1:01:36] opportunity
[1:01:40] the God is more willing to give you what
[1:01:44] you want
[1:01:45] then you even wanting it
[1:01:51] don't think you'll drain God's mercy
[1:01:56] God seen that there would be someone
[1:02:01] that would accept him
[1:02:04] being that the person that rejected
[1:02:08] Gibson is the person that will accept
[1:02:10] the opportunity
[1:02:12] God gives waves of opportunity
[1:02:19] finally since these wretched men didn't
[1:02:21] accept
[1:02:25] the father gave the opportunity to other
[1:02:27] men
[1:02:40] Jesus saith unto them did you never read
[1:02:42] in the scriptures the stone which the
[1:02:44] builders rejected the same has become
[1:02:46] the head of the corner
[1:02:50] the Lord this is the Lord's doing and it
[1:02:53] is marvelous in our eyes
[1:02:55] now look what Jesus says here
[1:02:58] therefore I say unto you
[1:03:01] the kingdom of God
[1:03:03] shall be taken from you
[1:03:08] and given unto a nation bringing forth
[1:03:11] the fruits thereof
[1:03:13] in English I really like how it says in
[1:03:16] English
[1:03:18] because that stone initial element
[1:03:22] initially came to the nation of Israel
[1:03:26] but after so many opportunities
[1:03:34] and gave you the opportunity
[1:03:40] but it says to be taken from them
[1:03:43] and given unto another Nation
[1:03:46] well the gospel's gone throughout the
[1:03:48] whole world
[1:03:49] what nation is it America America Mexico
[1:03:54] chile Chile Argentina Argentina Francia
[1:03:58] France Italian
[1:04:02] which nation is it
[1:04:06] molado
[1:04:28] they are worthy to take the book and
[1:04:29] open the seals for thou was slain
[1:04:33] and has redeemed Us by unto God by the
[1:04:36] blood
[1:04:40] out of every Kindred and tongue and
[1:04:43] people and Nation
[1:04:54] and after this I beheld and low a great
[1:04:57] multitude which no man could number
[1:04:59] is
[1:05:02] about Nations and kindreds and people
[1:05:04] and tongues
[1:05:08] it stood Before the Throne and before
[1:05:10] the Lambs Blancas
[1:05:13] closed with white robes and Palms in
[1:05:16] their hands
[1:05:22] and one of the elders answered is saying
[1:05:25] unto me what are these which are rated
[1:05:26] white robes and once they come winds
[1:05:28] come day
[1:05:30] and I said unto him sir thou knows
[1:05:41] and he said unto me these are they which
[1:05:43] came out of the Great Tribulation and
[1:05:45] have washed the robes and made them
[1:05:46] white in the blood of the Lamb foreign
[1:05:55] therefore are they Before the Throne of
[1:05:57] God and serve him day and night in his
[1:06:00] Temple this is
[1:06:08] shall dwell among them
[1:06:17] it's not a nation of the earth it's
[1:06:20] a nation of Heaven
[1:06:24] because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:06:28] the way that it's at hand is
[1:06:31] the holy spirit of God being born in you
[1:06:37] foreign
[1:06:57] a Chief Cornerstone electing precious
[1:07:05] and he that believeth on him shall not
[1:07:07] be confounded
[1:07:18] and unto you therefore which believeth
[1:07:20] he is precious but unto them which be
[1:07:22] disobedient the stone which the builders
[1:07:24] disallowed the same is made the head of
[1:07:26] the corner
[1:07:28] and a stone of stumbling
[1:07:32] that same Stone you accept not
[1:07:35] everyone can accept it
[1:07:52] it's elect and precious for the other
[1:07:54] person
[1:08:01] but you are a chosen generation
[1:08:04] royal priesthood Nation Santa and holy
[1:08:09] nation
[1:08:10] so then when Jesus said
[1:08:16] will be taken from the nation of Israel
[1:08:19] and given unto another Nation
[1:08:22] he wasn't speaking
[1:08:25] about a nation here on the earth
[1:08:28] about his present time or about the
[1:08:31] future
[1:08:33] he's talking about the nation in heaven
[1:08:48] the Christian Life is a flowery bed of
[1:08:51] ease
[1:08:53] he is
[1:08:57] or he's never accepted that experience
[1:09:00] himself
[1:09:01] the world hates you
[1:09:04] and the people will hate you
[1:09:10] Senor you've got to take the way of the
[1:09:13] Lord's despised views
[1:09:20] made fun of or anything else
[1:09:24] you've got to be different
[1:09:29] you're born of another Nation
[1:09:34] my wife as I will quote it again but
[1:09:36] foreign
[1:10:41] the Holy Spirit
[1:10:46] and we've got a national spirit is
[1:10:51] that's the Holy Spirit coming from God
[1:10:55] out of Heaven
[1:10:59] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand unto uses
[1:11:03] and you act like that
[1:11:07] makes you conduct yourself as they do up
[1:11:10] there
[1:11:11] is because you are of another world
[1:11:16] we're living in America
[1:11:18] the Cornerstone
[1:11:21] it has the first part of redemption
[1:11:24] which happens inside of you this is
[1:11:30] we live in America that's right
[1:11:33] the Corporal part
[1:11:36] the first part of the Redemption
[1:11:39] it's not for your body it's for your
[1:11:43] soul
[1:12:27] the Cornerstone
[1:12:31] it has the first part of redemption
[1:12:35] it makes the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:38] to be born in you
[1:12:40] the Cornerstone
[1:12:44] it doesn't make
[1:12:47] the Kingdom of Heaven coming to you the
[1:12:50] Cornerstone
[1:12:51] it makes you
[1:12:54] come to the kingdom of heaven
[1:13:25] he
[1:13:28] was taken up above
[1:13:34] it has both parts
[1:13:37] difficulties there's much difficulties
[1:13:43] there's there's bitterness okay a
[1:13:46] companion is that a company though both
[1:13:49] parts
[1:13:51] brother Branham also had to confront
[1:13:53] those bitterness
[1:13:55] the first bitterness he needed to
[1:13:57] confronto
[1:13:58] when he lost his wife and his daughter
[1:14:05] was that of his of his belly
[1:14:10] ambas both of those bitterness
[1:14:14] is
[1:14:14] they're in both parts
[1:14:19] when the wise menero Naches they came
[1:14:22] unto Jesus
[1:14:25] I believe it was a years after he was
[1:14:27] born
[1:14:30] the Bible says that Jesus was a child
[1:14:33] not necessarily a baby
[1:14:37] but when those wise men came with Jesus
[1:14:40] they brought gifts with them
[1:14:43] one of them was myrrh
[1:14:46] bitterness
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:50] when Jesus was at the cross
[1:14:53] they gave him a second bitterness
[1:14:56] the vinegar for him to drink
[1:14:59] there's bitterness
[1:15:04] we've got to go through that bitterness
[1:15:06] it's so fast and they're ugly
[1:15:12] but this message
[1:15:14] it has both Grace
[1:15:17] to overcome the bitterness
[1:15:21] oh God more important it's very
[1:15:24] important
[1:15:25] this message it has both parts
[1:15:35] so that nation that Jesus spoke of
[1:15:38] International
[1:15:39] is the nation from above
[1:15:42] it's no Nation down here
[1:15:46] the way that you enter into that kingdom
[1:15:48] is
[1:15:50] that the spirit of that Kingdom it first
[1:15:53] enters in you the Cornerstone
[1:15:57] it makes the Kingdom of Heaven coming to
[1:15:59] you and the Cornerstone the corona or
[1:16:03] the Capstone
[1:16:05] it makes you come unto the kingdom of
[1:16:08] heaven
[1:16:23] that was placed upon the 120.
[1:16:26] it is and verse 4 it says
[1:16:36] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:38] and began to speak with other tongues of
[1:16:39] the spirit gave them utterances
[1:16:46] and there were dwelling at Jerusalem
[1:16:49] Jews development out of every nation
[1:16:51] under heaven
[1:17:10] and the main nationality for you is
[1:17:12] Christianity
[1:17:18] if you're American culture your Mexican
[1:17:21] culture whatever culture Cristiana it
[1:17:25] clashes with the Christian culture
[1:17:28] is
[1:17:30] you've got to decide what culture is
[1:17:32] more important for you
[1:17:34] to be a citizen of what nation that you
[1:17:38] care most
[1:17:43] foreign
[1:18:11] with certain people
[1:18:25] when he was here literally on the earth
[1:18:29] wherever the word of God is
[1:18:32] the word is repeated
[1:18:35] the story is repeated
[1:18:38] the Bible is manifested once again
[1:18:42] just like the stone was rejected
[1:18:46] and then accepted by others
[1:18:49] there in the past
[1:18:52] once again there's a new generation
[1:18:58] otherwise God wouldn't be just God is
[1:19:02] just
[1:19:04] he gives everyone the opportunity
[1:19:07] he knows already who will accept it and
[1:19:10] who will reject
[1:19:12] but he gives everyone the opportunity
[1:19:16] what opportunity do you have to have
[1:19:20] this message
[1:19:23] that has both parts
[1:19:25] that you need
[1:19:29] I I am
[1:19:31] Christianity there's bitterness that
[1:19:33] every Christian must go through
[1:19:36] we don't want to go through that
[1:19:40] but in both parts there's the bitterness
[1:19:44] there's Grace also but
[1:19:48] overcome that bitterness
[1:19:52] there's a parable in the Bible in
[1:19:55] Luke 14.
[1:19:57] verse 16.
[1:20:01] Jesus
[1:20:05] and he said unto him a certain man made
[1:20:07] a great supper in paid money
[1:20:14] and send his servant at supper time to
[1:20:17] say unto them that were bidden come for
[1:20:19] all things are now ready
[1:20:50] and another said I have married a wife
[1:20:52] and therefore I cannot come is
[1:20:55] hola that was the first wave the first
[1:20:58] phase
[1:21:02] so the servant came and showed his Lord
[1:21:04] these things
[1:21:08] and the master of the house being angry
[1:21:10] said to his servants
[1:21:14] go out quickly into the streets in the
[1:21:17] lanes of the city
[1:21:18] and bring in hither the Poor Los manchos
[1:21:21] the main Los cojos
[1:21:24] and the blind
[1:21:42] it seemed like they weren't included
[1:21:45] if he said
[1:21:47] and he says bring unto the the Poor Los
[1:21:50] mangos Los cojos and the blind
[1:22:46] and let me show my Mercy unto them
[1:22:50] and then they'll believe me
[1:22:54] that's the last call got God's last call
[1:23:00] supper call is healing that's God's last
[1:23:03] call
[1:23:05] so then the second group
[1:23:09] they received Divine Healing campaigns
[1:23:14] the brother Brian says in the message
[1:23:16] you're life worthy of the Gospel
[1:23:21] did you notice there was three pulls or
[1:23:23] three turns of it
[1:23:25] there's different phases different
[1:23:28] opportunities
[1:23:32] when they went out first and called unto
[1:23:34] them that were
[1:23:37] them to come but they didn't do it
[1:23:41] there went out a healing campaign
[1:23:45] went out to get the Blind and the halt
[1:24:12] God gives the opportunity
[1:24:14] for them to want to accept
[1:24:28] and there was a second group
[1:24:36] this is a second healing campaign to get
[1:24:39] the Blind and the main
[1:24:43] reason
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:46] the Long Beach California I believe he
[1:24:49] was in Long Beach California
[1:24:52] he was uh speaking into an auditorial
[1:24:56] compartino he was sharing
[1:25:00] and I believe the person who he was
[1:25:02] sharing it with
[1:25:04] Charles Fuller I believe his name was
[1:25:06] Charles Fuller
[1:25:24] now the group of this other man Charles
[1:25:27] Fuller Charles Charles Fuller
[1:25:31] it's a group that brother Branham says
[1:25:36] paragraph 256. This is
[1:25:39] there was his intellectual group
[1:25:43] of fine dress people walking out of
[1:25:45] there the first group
[1:25:48] Maine
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:07] opportunity God gives opportunities
[1:26:10] after opportunities
[1:26:14] for those that humble themselves enough
[1:26:18] to accept the Cornerstone foreign
[1:26:52] will make you do strange things
[1:26:58] things that you never imagined yourself
[1:27:00] to do
[1:27:03] so then the second group
[1:27:06] was brother branham's group
[1:27:09] with campaign healings now remember
[1:27:14] Brandon said that healing
[1:27:17] was the last call
[1:27:22] so then why are we still here
[1:28:05] there was a new group that would come
[1:28:07] afterwards
[1:28:10] because brother Brandon was only
[1:28:12] accepted
[1:28:14] because of that Supernatural gift that
[1:28:16] he has
[1:28:17] when you would pray for the people they
[1:28:19] would heal
[1:28:20] but they would reject him for
[1:28:24] because the message that he brought
[1:28:27] opportunity God gives opportunities
[1:28:31] the people only wanted Jesus
[1:28:34] because it multiply the bread and he
[1:28:38] will feed them
[1:28:39] but when he gave them the message
[1:28:44] that Cornerstone was rejected Jesus
[1:28:47] Jesus was rejected
[1:28:49] brother Branham was rejected
[1:28:52] if you receive that stone usted
[1:28:56] you will confront rejection
[1:29:00] um
[1:29:02] so they rejected brother Branham they
[1:29:06] didn't want his message
[1:29:07] they just wanted a supernatural gifts
[1:29:10] companies
[1:29:13] brother Brandon said those campaigns
[1:29:15] should have been the last call
[1:29:17] but then in verse 22.
[1:29:20] the Bible says
[1:29:22] and the servant said Lord is
[1:29:26] done as that was commanded
[1:29:30] and yet there is room
[1:29:44] even though it makes us strange
[1:29:48] now we've got the opportunity
[1:29:53] accept God's grace
[1:29:58] it should have ended 60 years 70 years
[1:30:02] ago
[1:30:03] but for some reason
[1:30:05] the servant returned
[1:30:09] and said yet there is still room
[1:30:12] that's where you and I and tramos we
[1:30:15] enter in
[1:30:17] the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:30:19] that's where you and I we had the
[1:30:22] opportunity
[1:30:24] to find ourselves with this message
[1:30:30] that makes the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:30:33] through the Cornerstone
[1:30:37] and also the second part
[1:30:39] that will make you go
[1:30:42] unto the kingdom of heaven
[1:31:13] and
[1:31:20] God gives you Grace
[1:31:23] to overcome
[1:31:39] do you want to accept or reject
[1:31:43] Ed
[1:31:44] because after that he says
[1:31:48] this lord said unto the service
[1:31:53] he said go into the hedges and the
[1:31:56] streets and force them to compel them to
[1:31:58] come in
[1:31:59] so that my house may be filled
[1:32:03] so the third part pertains to you
[1:32:06] and just see what brother Branham says
[1:32:10] he preached this message here in Phoenix
[1:32:13] the message remembering the Lord
[1:32:17] so you pray now for us
[1:32:20] and go out into the streets
[1:32:22] into the hedges in the highways and ask
[1:32:26] them no no
[1:32:28] compel them
[1:32:31] compel them to come in
[1:32:36] for this would be a wonderful time
[1:32:40] visitation for Phoenix to get its great
[1:32:43] visitation
[1:32:45] I hint in Phoenix there's people in
[1:32:47] Phoenix
[1:32:49] that are part of that third group
[1:32:52] now what will you do
[1:32:54] will you accept the Cornerstone
[1:32:59] you'd be a make you a very strange
[1:33:02] person
[1:33:04] it would make you do things
[1:33:07] that you never thought you'd do you
[1:33:10] speak it away
[1:33:13] that before was strange to you
[1:33:20] it'll make you do strange things
[1:33:23] but it's worth it
[1:33:26] continuing it contains a Grace
[1:33:29] and there's also a second grade
[1:33:33] but there's bitterness that you need to
[1:33:36] go
[1:33:37] but don't worry
[1:33:41] after the bitterness
[1:33:43] there's honey
[1:34:11] after the bitterness
[1:34:34] do you want that stone or not
[1:34:40] it's just the beginning of redemption
[1:34:42] that's the second part and it's worth it
[1:34:47] he said
[1:34:50] it'll be a wonderful time
[1:34:54] for Phoenix to get its great visitation
[1:34:59] God is including you
[1:35:02] you've got the opportunity now you want
[1:35:05] to accept or reject
[1:35:12] they're in this message
[1:35:19] [Music]

[1:35:28] and I know that God is willing
[1:35:32] when we are ready yes sir when we're
[1:35:36] ready
[1:35:41] that's why we we these revivals are some
[1:35:46] conditions is to try to meet conditions
[1:35:53] and get ready for this thing to happen
[1:35:56] if you don't please stand
[1:36:07] the reason why that stone is always
[1:36:09] rejected is
[1:36:11] because it has a strange appearance
[1:36:16] the reason why Jesus Christ was rejected
[1:36:19] even the Bible itself says
[1:36:23] there was no Beauty in him for to be
[1:36:26] desired
[1:36:29] it might be strange
[1:36:31] but for us who have accepted him
[1:36:37] it's the most beautiful thing we can
[1:36:40] receive you know I am but there are
[1:36:43] bitterness
[1:36:46] Domingo like the brother told us on
[1:36:49] Sunday you read us the scriptures
[1:36:54] all those that live Godly in Christ
[1:36:56] Jesus
[1:36:58] they will suffer persecution
[1:37:02] there is rejection
[1:37:04] that's on that stone
[1:37:07] but there's also Grace let us pray
[1:37:12] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:37:14] word Lord
[1:37:16] we thank you for your message
[1:37:34] that gave me the opportunity
[1:37:36] and my brother in the opportunity
[1:37:40] to see if we would accept or we would
[1:37:43] reject
[1:37:44] I
[1:37:46] experiences
[1:37:48] Lord their bitterness bitter experiences
[1:37:50] that await us
