[37:05] Ministries missionary Outreach Min we
[37:08] are your
[37:09] brethren right we are your
[37:12] brethren I am your
[37:16] brother maybe the
[37:20] exterior may show that uh I'm
[37:22] inapproachable
[37:25] but I'm very approachable
[37:29] and and and sometimes I have to control
[37:33] myself because uh some people may not uh
[37:36] I might come off too
[37:39] strong but God made me it this way for
[37:42] this certain time that we're in you'll
[37:46] you'll soon hear and you'll
[37:50] learn amen uh I'll share a nice little
[37:53] testimony for the
[37:55] Youth share the word of God
[37:59] overall it's God's power of
[38:02] transformation it's not my power it's
[38:06] not what I could do to for
[38:09] myself I couldn't do absolutely
[38:12] nothing so let's go ahead now that you
[38:15] know my name is
[38:18] esta let's go ahead and go to the the
[38:22] scripture I had a thought I don't know
[38:24] if you if you read that I don't know if
[38:26] you're uh
[38:29] God God bless the
[38:32] musicians sometimes the title itself uh
[38:34] throws people for
[38:38] Loop it says read yourself in
[38:43] it and
[38:46] and how when brother Johnny had asked me
[38:49] to I'm just going to go and relax when
[38:50] brother Johnny your
[38:52] pastor he had asked me one time to do a
[38:54] Deliverance service
[38:57] I said no problem I was in my
[39:00] office I I started to go through I put
[39:03] my message
[39:05] together I G talk about God being a high
[39:08] tower mighty
[39:11] tower I felt the stirring in
[39:14] me this wasn't the
[39:17] message and and so I I just stayed at my
[39:21] desk I asked God said tell me what you
[39:24] want me to
[39:25] speak and then and then I started to
[39:27] hear three times
[39:32] fire fire then third time
[39:36] fire I said that's it it's
[39:39] fire and so I open my bible and it
[39:42] opened exactly where Elijah had called
[39:45] down
[39:50] fire and so I went with
[39:53] that and that's what we need today
[39:58] if you've gotten a little bit
[40:00] cold if your fuel if your oil level is a
[40:03] little bit
[40:05] low if the carbon needs to be
[40:11] trimmed if you've never exper experience
[40:14] that fire that I'm going to talk
[40:18] about or the fire that you
[40:22] see says I pray today it will be that
[40:25] day
[40:27] because within that
[40:29] fire is everything that you have need
[40:32] of for this world to journey
[40:36] in not only in this world but that fire
[40:41] is the
[40:43] ticket take you from this world to where
[40:47] God wants us to
[40:49] be amen
[40:55] amen John 3:16
[40:59] ju and many people are going to say John
[41:02] 3:16 we hear this so many
[41:07] times people have John 3:16 on their
[41:13] shirts how many watch
[41:16] wrestling or you used to watch
[41:19] wrestling tell the truth there's a guy
[41:22] named Austin
[41:24] 316 atin
[41:27] people would wear those
[41:29] shirts but they know nothing about John
[41:34] 3:16 true
[41:36] meaning that's what the word of God is
[41:39] to to people

[44:33] might be
[44:42] saved that believeth on him is not
[44:48] condemned but he that believeth

[48:55] under I'm going to give you I don't have
[48:57] it I'm I messed
[48:59] up but I want to give you I'm just going
[49:02] to read the the
[49:06] definition the power
[49:10] influence the power of capacity of
[49:12] causing and effect in indirect or
[49:15] intangible ways to sway
[49:31] and then the other
[49:33] word same
[49:35] word just helping you guys
[49:38] understand because more that word
[49:43] influence if you go to
[49:46] theology which means the true the study
[49:49] of the true sense of the
[49:55] word we to
[49:58] this
[50:00] influence an astrological
[50:03] term streaming
[50:09] eal power from the
[50:13] Stars When in certain
[50:16] positions acting
[50:19] upon
[50:20] character or
[50:22] destiny of men
[50:28] then that word
[50:31] Stars took
[50:33] me to Lucifer uh
[50:38] Lucero in the Hebrew it says the bright
[50:41] it said
[50:45] lightbearer and then it said Morning
[50:50] Star and then when I was reading it I
[50:52] said hold
[50:54] on there's only one one morning star
[50:57] that I know
[51:00] of how could they have the morning star
[51:02] under the Hebrew definition of
[51:08] Lucifer it had to be brought to my
[51:10] memory once
[51:13] again that Lucifer Luci was God's right
[51:17] hand
[51:19] man and Michael was on the left hand
[51:24] side so therefore there had to be a
[51:27] title
[51:30] switch so God took
[51:33] Lucifer why why because there was
[51:37] iniquity found in
[51:40] him and he took that
[51:43] title of Morning
[51:45] Star and put it upon
[51:48] Michael and then Michael KCK lufer
[51:53] out what is this got to do with what
[51:55] you're talking about brother
[51:59] you see what just that word
[52:01] star I want you to also
[52:04] understand if you could just read I'll
[52:06] give you Isaiah and also
[52:11] Ezekiel who your enemy
[52:15] is and how Splendid he
[52:19] is and how beautiful he
[52:23] is but still Michael
[52:27] kicked him out of
[52:29] Heaven he has no
[52:35] power your enemy is not your mom or
[52:40] dad you may look in the
[52:43] mirror and see an
[52:46] enemy because we're told that the
[52:48] greatest
[52:51] enemy is
[52:53] ourselves we Hinder
[53:01] am I still on bad
[53:05] news you want to hear some more bad
[53:08] news can can you guys handle
[53:12] it can your kids handle
[53:14] it we GNA give you some more bad
[53:18] news Psalms
[53:21] 515 you never had a chance
[53:26] never had a
[53:28] chance each and every one of you never
[53:32] had a
[53:34] chance behold I was shapen in
[53:39] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[53:41] conceive
[53:42] me how many heard brother Bram speak of
[53:46] this and many people say he's not even
[53:48] speaking in
[53:51] scriptures because he said I was born in
[53:54] sin sh iniquity
[53:56] I came out speaking
[53:58] lies they say that's not even in the
[54:02] scriptures what brother Bram did he
[54:04] grabbed two
[54:06] scriptures Psalm
[54:11] 5831 D hailed it together and he brought
[54:15] it
[54:15] forth said that I was born in
[54:18] sin shaped in
[54:20] ini and I came out speaking
[54:23] lies and here's the scripture
[54:26] David's acknowledging behold I was
[54:29] shapen in
[54:32] iniquity and in s did my mother
[54:34] conceived
[54:36] me then Psalms 58 the wicked are
[54:43] estranged from the
[54:46] womb they go
[54:48] astray as soon as they
[54:50] born speaking lies you never had a
[54:54] chance
[54:56] but God so L the
[55:00] world that he
[55:04] came to give you a
[55:08] chance that's why the
[55:11] title again I'm gonna need your
[55:13] help you're gonna think I'm
[55:17] conceited or maybe the st's full of
[55:22] himself but the title says read yourself
[55:25] in it
[55:27] read yourself in
[55:29] what the word of
[55:32] God there's nothing wrong with
[55:34] that you have to find
[55:37] yourself in the word of
[55:40] God and that's what we should search
[55:43] it like when brother
[55:46] Bram gave that
[55:48] illustration of that German car
[55:51] maker he gave a book to the uh to his
[55:54] his uh uh supervisor
[55:58] and he read the
[55:59] book and he says don't bring that stuff
[56:02] here to work
[56:06] again why he said because don't I think
[56:09] he said don't bring that garbage here
[56:14] again this guy called me a
[56:18] buzzard and he said what I don't I don't
[56:21] know
[56:23] why he called me an eagle
[56:27] and he says amen so you got to find
[56:32] yourself he that believeth in
[56:35] him shall not
[56:38] perish but have everlasting
[56:40] life now are you a
[56:43] Believer or are you an
[56:45] unbeliever I didn't say an a make
[56:49] believer you're either a
[56:51] Believer or an unbeliever
[56:56] what well I'm just not sure I hope today
[56:58] is your
[57:04] day all
[57:06] things
[57:08] 19621 that's Slide
[57:12] [Music]
[57:17] Five like a story I read here some time
[57:24] ago an old C up on the
[57:29] sea and he had a pretty
[57:32] near lived his life out in
[57:39] sin but once he had heard of The Bible
[57:43] and
[57:49] God and he laid
[57:54] dying slide six
[57:57] and he said is there one person that
[58:00] could talk to me about the
[58:04] Bible or is there one Bible on my
[58:10] ship see he'd been waiting a long
[58:16] time think about that but God's full of
[58:23] Mercy paragraph 120
[58:27] slide seven and they found a boy that
[58:29] they picked
[58:33] up on the
[58:35] ship and he had a Bible and he told him
[58:39] he said come in son and sit down by my
[58:44] bed and read me that
[58:48] Bible slide
[58:51] eight and the young lad turned to his
[58:54] turned to Isaiah 53
[58:59] and it reads like
[59:00] this he was wounded for our
[59:05] transgression he was bruised for our
[59:09] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[59:12] was upon
[59:14] him and with his stripes stripes we were
[59:19] healed the little boy turned and he
[59:23] said Captain sir
[59:26] he said yes
[59:30] lad he said let me read it the way my
[59:34] mom used to read it to
[59:38] me it gets good and
[59:43] gooder but here's the way that
[59:47] Mama the
[59:49] word the the one who teaches you used to
[59:53] read it to me
[59:59] said go ahead
[1:00:02] son read it the way your mother read
[1:00:08] it slide 11 said Mama used to set me up
[1:00:12] on her knee and
[1:00:17] read he was wounded for willly
[1:00:21] puits willly he was bruised for Wily's
[1:00:26] puit
[1:00:28] iniquities will the chastisement of
[1:00:32] Willie puit peace was upon
[1:00:38] him and with his stripes Willie pu was
[1:00:46] healed you mean
[1:00:49] me the old Captain said I wish I'd had
[1:00:53] have had a mama like that
[1:00:59] how many Mas do we have like
[1:01:04] that maybe we should
[1:01:08] start cast those Devils that followed
[1:01:10] your
[1:01:12] children they come home from school with
[1:01:14] such a horrible influence upon
[1:01:17] them they don't understanding
[1:01:23] themselves don't know why they're being
[1:01:24] tormented themselves
[1:01:28] so it's always good to get them like
[1:01:30] brother Bernie would always say his
[1:01:32] mother
[1:01:36] did she wasn't always just checking
[1:01:39] him she said she would check his
[1:01:42] ears no check his
[1:01:45] ears what did you hear at
[1:01:48] school and she would No Doubt with the
[1:01:51] Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost turn to her son look him over
[1:01:57] pray over him you came from school and
[1:02:01] casting those anointings
[1:02:04] away I plead the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:06] upon
[1:02:07] you putting the blood upon your
[1:02:11] ear putting it upon your
[1:02:13] forehead I the blood of Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ she wasn't saying it that's what
[1:02:20] she was
[1:02:23] doing maybe my name could be read into
[1:02:29] it that's why the
[1:02:32] title little boy said just a minute
[1:02:37] Captain let me read your name into
[1:02:41] it he was wounded for John quartz
[1:02:46] salvation johnz amen he was bruised for
[1:02:49] John quartz
[1:02:51] iniquities johnz the chastisement of
[1:02:54] John quartz peace was upon
[1:02:58] him with his stripes John quartz was
[1:03:04] healed light flashed over the old
[1:03:06] Captain's
[1:03:11] face I see it I see it and what he did
[1:03:16] is he got where's my
[1:03:19] clothes and he dressed
[1:03:23] himself amen amen
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:30] God so
[1:03:33] loved that he gave his only begotten
[1:03:37] son that one day when he was in
[1:03:43] belief he would hear the
[1:03:47] gospel even though his grandpa was
[1:03:50] Pastor an
[1:03:53] evangelist a minor prophet
[1:03:56] his dad is this his dad is this I'm
[1:03:59] sorry but it's an individual
[1:04:02] Affair I don't care if your dad is a
[1:04:05] pastor I care if you're a relative of
[1:04:07] brother
[1:04:09] BR it's an individual
[1:04:12] Affair and when the preaching of the
[1:04:16] Gospel which we are told to
[1:04:20] do why is preaching the gospel
[1:04:27] CU it's a
[1:04:28] commission if you ain't out there
[1:04:30] preaching the
[1:04:32] gospel to The
[1:04:34] Prostitute to the drunkard to the drug
[1:04:37] addict to the one who has diabetes the
[1:04:41] one who has high blood pressure the Lost
[1:04:44] then you're missing it you're not doing
[1:04:48] what God commanded you to
[1:04:53] doen amen
[1:05:01] next slide 15 uh
[1:05:04] trans and when he was this is living
[1:05:06] dying buried rising and
[1:05:13] coming and when he was on his way down
[1:05:16] to the grave of
[1:05:19] Lazarus speaking of Jesus
[1:05:21] Christ I think that was another great
[1:05:24] time that he expressed
[1:05:31] what God is to the human
[1:05:36] beings not not only is he a
[1:05:41] God that could forgive the lowest
[1:05:46] sin that could be
[1:05:53] committed this is what this world needs
[1:05:55] to to there's too many people paying the
[1:06:01] price and they need to
[1:06:03] hear Jesus Christ paid the price for
[1:06:07] you don't torment
[1:06:10] yourself you couldn't help
[1:06:13] it didn't I read the scripture you were
[1:06:15] born in sin shaped in
[1:06:17] iniquity you can help speaking
[1:06:23] lies the moment a man
[1:06:27] or a
[1:06:28] woman would step away from God's
[1:06:32] influence you're on thin
[1:06:36] ice because there's another
[1:06:39] influence that is there and that's the
[1:06:44] enemy and take the
[1:06:47] guilty and make them
[1:06:51] Guiltless by his
[1:06:53] pardoning love
[1:06:57] God so loved the
[1:07:00] world that gave His only begotten
[1:07:03] son if you don't get anything into your
[1:07:07] mind tonight I'm gonna drive this
[1:07:11] down God so

[1:08:10] name sooner or
[1:08:13] later if it hasn't been revealed to
[1:08:16] you and I hope it's
[1:08:19] sooner that your name will be
[1:08:23] read out of this
[1:08:26] book how by the preaching of the
[1:08:30] gospel because the gospel
[1:08:32] says in Romans chapter 8 for the
[1:08:36] manifestation of
[1:08:38] God it wasn't that just one day you
[1:08:41] became a Son of
[1:08:44] God before the foundation of the
[1:08:47] world were a Son of God you were a
[1:08:51] daughter of
[1:08:52] God but it's not known to you
[1:08:56] that's why the scripture says that the
[1:08:58] Earth is
[1:09:00] moaning
[1:09:01] gring for the
[1:09:06] manifestation because the Earth is
[1:09:08] barely holding
[1:09:12] together hurricane after
[1:09:16] Hurricane
[1:09:18] after over
[1:09:20] fire over
[1:09:22] earthquake if you're not listening
[1:09:25] listening to the word of
[1:09:27] God is testifying to
[1:09:32] you hurry up I Want to Break
[1:09:35] Forth into a new
[1:09:38] creation he's waiting for you boys and
[1:09:43] girls what is
[1:09:46] manifested the word
[1:09:48] manifested people avoid
[1:09:51] it but in
[1:09:53] emology it means this
[1:09:57] in the Latin
[1:10:01] hand to be attacked to be
[1:10:07] struck so what do you think that
[1:10:09] scripture
[1:10:11] means for the manifestations of the sons
[1:10:13] of God when you're
[1:10:16] born
[1:10:20] manifest W it says Oh you mean what some
[1:10:23] say Lord manifest yourself to me
[1:10:27] manifest yourself to me Lord show me the
[1:10:30] way and then the hand of God comes and
[1:10:32] gives you
[1:10:35] one oh my
[1:10:37] god that
[1:10:39] hurt yes but what are you
[1:10:42] now I'm awake
[1:10:44] Lord so
[1:10:47] long go out
[1:10:50] there prach the gospel don't teach
[1:10:55] to the the the you got to learn the
[1:10:57] Seven
[1:11:01] Seals but I have you know you're getting
[1:11:05] thunder you're getting
[1:11:08] lightning
[1:11:11] now God so
[1:11:15] loved that he put him in a
[1:11:18] path of a man named Johnny
[1:11:21] aado Johnny a he got on a bus
[1:11:26] and punishing
[1:11:29] himself he didn't know how to go back to

[1:18:26] on a Friday
[1:18:27] service I came to church I think it was
[1:18:29] cut off bald
[1:18:32] head looking like a crazy
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:37] gangster I sat in the back
[1:18:40] hiding when he came up here and
[1:18:43] said he was giving a
[1:18:45] testimony he said that how he received
[1:18:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:54] when he finally cried

[1:19:01] more they keep on telling me you can run
[1:19:05] this yard I'll give you the
[1:19:10] drugs but when I was looking at him I
