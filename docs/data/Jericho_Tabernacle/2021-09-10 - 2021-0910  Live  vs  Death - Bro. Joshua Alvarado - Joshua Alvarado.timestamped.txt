[34:46] so many young men filled with the holy
[34:48] ghost
[34:52] and and and witnessing and bringing us
[34:54] the word of god
[34:59] so i apologize that you guys
[35:01] got like
[35:02] half not even half like a little portion
[35:04] of what should be happening
[35:13] and
[35:14] but
[35:15] whatever god's will is
[35:20] i'm here in obedience
[35:22] and uh i feel the lord uh tugging at my
[35:25] heart
[35:28] and
[35:29] like i said i want to testify of that
[35:35] i want to read another scripture
[35:39] it's found in ephesians
[35:40] 6 10.
[35:48] um
[35:49] if you want to turn with me it's it's it
[35:51] reads us this uh
[35:55] finally my brethren
[35:57] be strong in the lord and in the power
[35:59] of his might
[36:01] put on the whole armor of god that you
[36:03] me ye may be able to stand against the
[36:06] wiles of the devil
[36:09] not against flesh and blood but against
[36:11] principalities against powers
[36:14] against the rulers of the dark darkness
[36:17] of this world
[36:18] against spiritual wickedness in high
[36:20] places
[36:47] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[36:50] of god
[36:52] that you may ye may be able to withstand
[36:54] in the evil day and having done all to
[36:57] stand
[36:59] for tomato
[37:01] pods
[37:08] amen
[37:09] so um
[37:11] i i have a little bit of a title
[37:16] i i call i'm calling it life versus
[37:18] death okay
[37:22] again this is my testimony of
[37:25] what i feel god has
[37:27] been doing in my life
[37:33] and
[37:34] most of most of what i'm going to be
[37:36] saying you can find it in uh
[37:38] in brother branham's message uh the
[37:40] greatest battle ever fought
[37:44] in contrary
[37:49] and putting on the whole armor of god
[37:55] i really felt led um
[37:58] by god to be hearing and and meditating
[38:00] on that embedded
[38:06] you know
[38:08] brother branham we hear him he says we
[38:10] we're not coming to a picnic
[38:17] and and
[38:18] he also says
[38:21] well he says we're coming to a
[38:22] battleground that's what we're coming to
[38:24] right
[38:28] so um
[38:29] in this message he also says that
[38:32] in the time of peace
[38:38] prepare for war
[38:41] and um
[38:42] i think one of the sermons i believe
[38:44] it's when he's talking
[38:47] when he's talking
[38:49] about putting on the whole armor of god
[38:57] it's a convention it's a convention and
[39:00] he's uh reminding the ministers
[39:04] it's a very simple message
[39:08] but he's reminding the ministers
[39:13] to put on the whole armor of god
[39:18] we're here brother branham oh yeah
[39:20] branham we know that he can give us
[39:22] a mouthful
[39:26] there's sermons that are four hours long
[39:28] i said
[39:31] so he begins to speak um
[39:34] about warfare
[39:38] he talks about how
[39:41] um how the stars
[39:45] are are so perfectly aligned
[39:50] and um he types it to god's army
[39:54] alleged
[39:56] he says that
[40:02] he says god's solar system is perfectly
[40:04] aligned we say el sistemas solar de dios
[40:07] esta alinado
[40:09] amen
[40:10] he says that
[40:14] in god's great army nothing gets out of
[40:16] place
[40:22] amen he says that
[40:26] he's talking about how
[40:29] if the moon gets out of place a little
[40:30] bit
[40:34] the ocean will start
[40:36] getting out of place too uh
[40:41] yeah and he types he he says god's
[40:43] heavenly host
[40:47] are perfect
[40:49] and
[40:51] he goes on and says that us earthly
[40:53] hosts
[40:58] are
[40:59] should be in line
[41:02] but clearly we're not we have
[41:30] amen
[41:32] so
[41:35] like i said i i want to testify a little
[41:37] bit about my life
[41:42] um
[41:43] so i was raised in the message like you
[41:45] all know community
[41:50] [Music]
[42:25] and he's going to start uh feeding you
[42:27] his doubt and his lies
[42:33] amen
[42:36] so
[42:37] as a as a young child you know i i i can
[42:40] remember being a very small child
[42:47] always being loved by my families
[42:51] having so much love around me
[42:55] so much brotherly love from all the
[43:01] but
[43:02] i couldn't help
[43:04] but have my day with the devil
[43:11] so
[43:12] as a young child
[43:15] in our mind in my mind and mimente
[43:18] i i can't even remember how far back
[43:20] maybe i was a infant uh
[43:27] but you begin to have these these
[43:29] thoughts that you know they're not from
[43:31] god
[43:37] it's a conscience right we all have a
[43:52] but as a child as having all this love
[43:55] and all this grace and mercy and going
[43:58] to church
[44:03] and people people showing me love my
[44:05] life
[44:20] you know brother banham says where this
[44:22] is a war that's going on this is
[44:27] it
[44:28] you know it's it's life or death it's la
[44:31] vida la muerte
[44:32] we begin to hear
[44:34] his lies
[44:46] that's literally what we're choosing is
[44:48] literally
[44:50] so
[44:51] as i grew older
[44:54] i i understood that i needed god's grace
[44:56] in my life
[45:00] you know i heard a brother say
[45:02] not too long ago
[45:05] he was talking about um
[45:07] the two p the two men that were going uh
[45:10] traveling to emmaus
[45:15] we are going to
[45:17] to masses and jesus appeared to them and
[45:19] they didn't recognize him
[45:25] you know and their hearts burned within
[45:27] them
[45:29] so many people in my life
[45:33] have been a representation of jesus
[45:35] christ
[45:39] you know
[45:39] but i heard this brother say but
[45:42] you know
[45:43] and it was very impactful to me
[45:46] he said that um
[45:49] jesus when he was on on the on the way
[45:52] with them this
[45:53] jesus
[45:56] he was going to continue they got to
[45:58] their destination
[46:02] and um
[46:04] they had to encourage him they had to
[46:06] invite him
[46:09] stay with us
[46:12] and i realized that as a young as a
[46:14] young person
[46:16] i have to invite jesus christ into my
[46:18] life
[46:22] you know
[46:23] i have these bad thoughts
[46:26] but
[46:38] and i um
[46:40] i began my christian walk
[46:43] christian as as a young person
[46:46] i believe i was 18 years old when i got
[46:48] baptized
[46:52] and um
[46:53] and i was it was i was joyful and
[46:56] i had received from the lord
[47:02] i began my personal relationship with
[47:04] jesus christ
[47:08] so along that way
[47:14] you know i i didn't realize
[47:18] that i was to be
[47:20] putting on the whole armor of god
[47:34] that i had
[47:36] been baptized and i received the lord
[47:38] give me my savior
[47:43] and i um
[47:46] i didn't feed myself my spirit
[47:50] i was going with my friends every day
[47:56] i forgot about jesus
[47:58] jesus
[48:00] i would come to church
[48:03] and and i would feel convicted
[48:07] and i would um
[48:11] and i would i would feel convicted and i
[48:13] would i would have remorse
[48:18] and and i stayed there in quebec for a
[48:21] long time
[48:23] just saying god i need your help
[48:27] i love you lord i i i
[48:30] i would say i know your word i believe
[48:32] your word
[48:45] [Music]
[48:46] so for a long time i stayed there
[48:52] i
[48:54] i thought i was a christian your pensaba
[48:56] you are cristiano i
[48:58] but i had
[49:00] somewhere along the line left jesus
[49:06] jesus
[49:07] um
[49:08] not saying that i was a bad person
[49:12] but i was more in tune with um
[49:16] the things of the flesh
[49:25] my friends amigos
[49:27] so
[49:30] i little by little
[49:32] i let the devil in just a tiny bit
[49:36] just a tiny bit
[49:38] you know that's how god needs to work
[49:41] god only needs a little tiny bit of
[49:43] faith
[49:45] but the devil the devil does the same
[49:47] thing
[49:49] says just come just come with me one
[49:51] time
[49:54] you'll have fun you're not gonna do
[49:55] anything wrong just just a little bit
[49:57] yeah
[50:01] you know when i i struggled
[50:04] i can honestly say that
[50:06] i fought
[50:08] yo honestly
[50:10] um and i wanted to
[50:13] um
[50:15] i brought myself down
[50:20] so i remember the first time
[50:24] being with my friends
[50:26] amigos and um i'm a really
[50:30] i like being i don't know if anybody
[50:31] will believe me but i like being the
[50:33] life of the party
[50:39] yeah i like i like you know if if i'm
[50:41] not having fun
[50:46] i kind of like i'll start rubbing off on
[50:48] somebody else or you know i want to
[50:50] leave and i think we're all kind of like
[50:53] that
[50:57] we kind of we we want to be entertained
[50:59] you know we're we're self centered
[51:05] so
[51:06] by the grace of god
[51:09] you know as a young person i
[51:12] i never got into into drugs
[51:17] but there came a life there came a time
[51:19] in my life
[51:27] and
[51:28] i remember i was saying that
[51:31] sometimes we
[51:33] well i remember
[51:34] i fought so hard the first time to to
[51:37] get high
[51:39] recorded
[51:41] [Music]
[51:43] i wanted it
[51:45] and it was something like
[51:46] it might have been something more social
[51:48] than what i really wanted to feel
[51:56] but it was something that i had like a
[51:58] desire because of maybe it was i was
[52:01] living in the flesh or because of my
[52:03] friends
[52:07] amigos
[52:08] you know
[52:09] brother banham talks about those
[52:12] like the pipe dreamers he calls it i
[52:14] think
[52:15] uh
[52:19] he says he says they'll get so high that
[52:22] they'll they'll fall asleep and die
[52:29] so
[52:30] i know that he says that the reason that
[52:33] they do that
[52:37] is because they're they're missing
[52:38] something
[52:41] they have a void
[52:43] and they're trying to satisfy that
[52:46] good things of the world
[52:48] but
[52:49] he types he says jesus is the lily
[52:52] jesus
[52:54] the lily of the valley elite the true
[52:57] opioid
[53:02] so
[53:02] you know for a long time i was happy i
[53:05] was happy doing what i was doing
[53:10] i would go with my friends
[53:12] amigos
[53:26] and i forgot about god
[53:28] i completely forgot about god
[53:31] and you know i was
[53:33] i was i was okay i wasn't i mean uh
[53:37] in in society just
[53:40] social um i was doing fine
[53:45] a little bit of drinking
[53:47] some smoking and
[53:49] and and just living in the world
[53:53] and and although i had a seat in me on
[53:57] youtube and i always knew that
[54:01] i was i was happy in what i was doing yo
[54:04] feliciano
[54:07] you know but
[54:12] things got worse
[54:16] i
[54:18] i started dealing with with
[54:20] with harder drugs
[54:25] i have a very addictive personality
[54:29] addictive so i mean i was just like just
[54:32] trying everything i could illo
[54:35] probably
[54:37] and you know
[54:39] i i still felt god calling in my life
[54:45] but
[54:46] i
[54:47] i wasn't i didn't want to hear the call
[54:54] you know i'd say if god's going to call
[54:56] me he's going to call me
[55:00] and and worse and worse
[55:04] and and to speed up my time
[55:09] i got to the point
[55:12] where i said i'm i'm going to
[55:16] you know my family was always going to
[55:17] church at this time
[55:19] my family
[55:20] tiempo assisted
[55:22] and i hadn't gone to church maybe for
[55:23] like three
[55:24] three four years or somewhere around
[55:26] there for a few years
[55:32] maybe i would go a sunday quesadilla
[55:34] domingo or i would i would just go
[55:37] once in a while
[55:40] um
[55:42] but never never to be to be really
[55:44] paying attention
[55:55] but there came a time where
[55:59] i was so caught up in what i was doing
[56:06] and i felt that
[56:08] i was
[56:09] literally going to die
[56:15] and i was
[56:18] with with evil people some evil people
[56:23] and i just just had a bad company around

[56:33] i i was surrounded by my family still
[56:36] yeah
[56:38] my family had a lot of love around
[56:44] and there was a point in my life that i
[56:46] wanted to
[56:48] i still had the call from god
[56:55] and i wanted to
[56:57] um give god a try
[57:02] i was tired of i was i was
[57:04] going in circles for a little while
[57:10] i was going in circles for a little
[57:11] while
[57:14] and um
[57:16] i realized i was
[57:19] trying to give god a try immediately
[57:25] but it wasn't so easy anymore
[57:29] i would find myself going to church
[57:32] i would say i'm going to go to church
[57:34] today
[57:37] and i would be driving to church
[57:53] it was like they put a wall up for me
[57:56] um
[58:00] so
[58:01] i
[58:04] like i said i was involved in some some
[58:06] pretty bad things
[58:08] just
[58:11] i said well it's all right i can i'll
[58:14] fix myself i'll i'll go clean and
[58:17] and i'll
[58:18] try to get back to church little by
[58:20] little i'll ease my way in
[58:22] yo
[58:25] you know
[58:30] but but the hard part was
[58:34] i couldn't do it anymore
[58:37] i was i was dead inside por dentos
[58:40] i was doing so many things i see a
[58:42] tantasu
[58:44] away from god's word
[58:48] i had
[58:57] that it had a grip on me
[59:00] and i couldn't break free you know
[59:03] so i kept trying to come to church i
[59:05] kept trying i wanted to yo
[59:11] but i would fall deeper and deeper
[59:15] and further and further
[59:19] and i couldn't get out
[59:21] i was lost
[59:26] i couldn't get freed
[59:29] i don't know if i could express myself
[59:31] more no products
[59:33] but i was trapped brothers
[59:36] i couldn't break free no more yeah
[59:39] i wanted to give god my heart
[59:41] regardless
[59:43] but i was so far away prior
[59:46] it's like he couldn't hear me
[59:49] i wanted i wanted to change my life
[59:53] but it wasn't happening
[59:56] brothers i was so desperate
[1:00:23] because i was i was using these these
[1:00:25] hard drugs
[1:00:36] that there was nothing that i could do
[1:00:38] to help myself
[1:00:47] that
[1:00:49] it's it's not
[1:00:51] something that i would encourage anybody
[1:00:53] to go through the que

[1:01:13] with god by the hand
[1:01:17] when i was baptized
[1:01:20] and you know we're living in a dark age
[1:01:27] you know

[1:02:20] and it was like i expected to find god
[1:02:22] just by just by feeling around

[1:02:39] in my life
[1:02:43] my family my family the love i have
[1:02:45] around me el amor

[1:04:24] praise god thank you god for healing me
[1:04:29] and
[1:04:30] it took a good while it took a long time
[1:04:34] it wasn't it wasn't a uh
[1:04:36] it wasn't from one moment to the next
[1:04:45] you know i read the scripture putting on
[1:04:47] the whole armor of god
[1:04:53] sorry i'm not i'm not a
[1:04:55] great speaker
[1:05:00] but i want to read a quote
[1:05:03] from brother branham de la mana branham
[1:05:06] um it's from the greatest battle ever
[1:05:08] fought
[1:05:11] and uh let's see here
[1:05:15] i don't know i don't think they have it
[1:05:16] but
[1:05:20] so it's kind of lengthy but i'm going to
[1:05:22] kind of paraphrase through it here
[1:05:28] i didn't read it i didn't actually read
[1:05:30] the scripture
[1:05:33] but let me let me just read it real
[1:05:35] quick for you bro
[1:05:37] so on ephesians 6 13 it says
[1:05:40] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:05:42] of god
[1:05:48] today
[1:05:50] ye may be able to withstand the evil day
[1:05:52] in having done all to stand
[1:05:58] up
[1:06:00] stand therefore
[1:06:02] establish
[1:06:03] having your low end skirt about with
[1:06:05] truth
[1:06:11] and having on the breastplate of
[1:06:13] righteousness
[1:06:16] and your feet shot with the preparation
[1:06:18] of the gospel of peace
[1:06:22] above all
[1:06:24] taking the shield of faith
[1:06:27] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:06:30] all the fiery darts of the wicked con
[1:06:36] and take the helmet of salvation
[1:06:40] and the sword of the spirit
[1:06:43] which is the word of god
[1:06:54] and watching there unto with all
[1:06:56] perseverance
[1:07:01] and supplication for all for all saints
[1:07:05] santos so brother branham says here
[1:07:09] is branham
[1:07:13] he says now that that's the two great
[1:07:16] forces that's coming together right now
[1:07:23] let me go back he says that's what satan
[1:07:25] is he's a destroyer
[1:07:41] penis and flusteration frustrations and
[1:07:43] worry
[1:07:46] all on satan
[1:07:49] god is life
[1:07:51] faith faith
[1:07:54] peace
[1:07:58] now that's the two great forces that's
[1:07:59] coming together right now
[1:08:06] they're battling
[1:08:07] they're battling right here in the
[1:08:09] building right now
[1:08:12] they battle day by day
[1:08:15] with you every force
[1:08:19] satan following you along satan
[1:08:23] that great big
[1:08:24] kindly priestly goliath
[1:08:31] trying to scare the liver out of you
[1:08:36] he's right
[1:08:40] you're fortified amen
[1:08:43] with the gospel cornelius with the word
[1:08:46] of truth around your loins
[1:08:50] glory
[1:09:18] meet me in the name of organization
[1:09:22] organization you meet me in the name of
[1:09:24] this
[1:09:26] that or the other es
[1:09:28] but i meet you in the name of the lord
[1:09:30] jesus the lord god of israel
[1:09:57] um i don't measure up to how brother
[1:09:59] branham is really saying this here you
[1:10:20] he says satan's army brings diseases
[1:10:25] and god's army is commissioned to cast
[1:10:27] them out
[1:10:45] that's the very technique that god uses
[1:10:50] and use the army of destruction
[1:10:54] to disbelieve god's word and set him up
[1:10:56] a better kingdom than michael had
[1:10:58] paradise
[1:11:02] miguel and god cast them out
[1:11:05] god's method is cast out the devil
[1:11:10] cast down reasoning
[1:11:38] you know
[1:11:39] we live in this flesh here
[1:11:42] five senses we hear about the five
[1:11:44] senses
[1:11:46] we hear about the the five spiritual the
[1:11:49] s of the soul the senses of the soul
[1:11:52] atamino de
[1:12:07] you know there's uh this imagination i
[1:12:10] like
[1:12:11] conscience conscience memory memorial
[1:12:14] reason
[1:12:15] and affection
[1:12:18] you see um a lot of times this is how i
[1:12:20] had it understood
[1:12:24] you know i can't live in the flesh
[1:12:27] you know i got to be careful with my
[1:12:28] eyes
[1:12:31] and i got to be careful of what i'm
[1:12:33] taking in
[1:12:43] so i have to uh be careful with what
[1:12:46] what i'm what i'm reasoning in here
[1:13:03] what i'm coming to understand now
[1:13:07] is that
[1:13:08] those channels
[1:13:10] conductors are only are only used by
[1:13:12] satan
[1:13:15] to give us
[1:13:16] doubt so
[1:13:19] there's there's it's really what matters
[1:13:21] is our soul bro
[1:13:25] you know our faith
[1:13:27] in god's word
[1:13:29] so when we're we can't dwell
[1:13:59] but that's what god's word is
[1:14:03] you know i i had a little bit
[1:14:06] of the world
[1:14:08] poco del mundo and with that little bit
[1:14:11] of the devil
[1:14:16] no matter who my family was important
[1:14:19] no matter who was praying for me it
[1:14:20] seemed important for me you know he took
[1:14:23] over my life
[1:14:26] because i let a little bit of
[1:14:28] imagination
[1:14:33] go away from god's word
[1:14:36] you know i like what brother eli said
[1:14:39] where you have to be faith tested
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:45] you know we uh
[1:14:48] that was one thing that i didn't i
[1:14:50] didn't have it
[1:14:52] i didn't have faith in god's word
[1:14:57] sure i was i i
[1:15:00] i did i did understand christ
[1:15:05] india he died for my sins
[1:15:08] you know he we're coming to the world
[1:15:13] in a sinful condition
[1:15:17] but in order for us to survive
[1:15:22] and overcome even sir we need we need
[1:15:24] god's word
[1:15:27] and only god's word
[1:15:29] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:15:31] bring bring us from death and to life
[1:15:36] you know
[1:15:37] i i
[1:15:38] my dad taught me very well what's
[1:15:40] happening performance in muy bien about
[1:15:42] the word
[1:15:43] and how
[1:15:45] um
[1:15:46] adam and eve
[1:15:51] and we we come to this world in a fall
[1:15:53] in nature
[1:15:58] you know we know so much about the word
[1:16:04] but do we apply it to our lives
[1:16:08] i wasn't applying it to my life
[1:16:12] and um
[1:16:13] i had fallen into so much doubt
[1:16:19] i allowed
[1:16:20] permittee
[1:16:23] influence
[1:16:25] to to lead me astray okay
[1:16:30] you know we're all influenced by someone
[1:16:32] must
[1:16:45] and as an adult elderly person
[1:16:50] will be led by someone
[1:16:52] as well
[1:16:55] and
[1:16:58] we're living in a in a dark age right
[1:17:01] now
[1:17:04] but god is is preparing a bride
[1:17:09] he's preparing someone else
[1:17:11] that's gonna follow his word
[1:17:14] and and we have people around us
[1:17:19] that are filled with the holy spirit
[1:17:22] and and either we we put ourselves
[1:17:24] shoulder to shoulder with them
[1:17:43] we have
[1:17:44] people dedicated to his word
[1:17:48] they have given their lives
[1:17:51] for this message
[1:17:54] and um
[1:17:56] and it's
[1:17:56] it's an individual affair yes
[1:18:00] we all have to die
[1:18:03] like like kane died on the sacrifice
[1:18:07] of sacrificial we have to sacrifice our
[1:18:09] own lives
[1:18:22] there's no there's nothing else left for
[1:18:24] us
[1:18:26] it's life or death it is
[1:18:28] it truly is i can't express myself
[1:18:30] enough
[1:19:07] el diablo
[1:19:10] but by the grace of god
[1:19:13] i believe god i'm a child of god
[1:19:18] i have a i am a seed yo soy simente and
[1:19:22] that life began to sprout yes
[1:19:26] and and it's still working in my life
[1:19:30] i'm not perfect to have a lot of
[1:19:31] problems
[1:19:34] but i believe that
[1:19:36] god's holy spirit is working in my life
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:42] you know i i came back to
[1:19:45] um
[1:19:46] i came back to god around
[1:19:48] say three years ago
[1:19:52] i i try to i
[1:19:55] i dedicated my life yo
[1:19:59] i was at the edge of death
[1:20:02] i i felt like death was haunting me
[1:20:10] and i
[1:20:11] stood i said i am going to stand on
[1:20:14] god's word
[1:20:20] then i will
[1:20:22] die saying that i accept jesus christ
[1:20:28] and i and i became stubborn
[1:20:44] not letting anything knock me over
[1:20:49] just standing
[1:20:51] standing on god's word
[1:20:55] you know we all have to be tested
[1:20:59] i like how brother eli talked about
[1:21:01] those hebrew children
[1:21:06] you know those those hebrew children had
[1:21:08] to to to take a stand
[1:21:12] posture
[1:21:32] you know and sometimes
[1:21:35] that well that's what the devil does
[1:21:37] he'll take something of god
[1:21:40] and pervert
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:57] but they knew not to worship any idols
[1:22:03] like abraham
[1:22:04] abraham
[1:22:07] god god gave him his word
[1:22:11] he said you're going to receive a child
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:17] abraham was becoming old
[1:22:21] he was dying
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:48] you know
[1:22:50] there's there's a there's a whole list
[1:22:52] daniel
[1:22:55] daniel in the lion's den
[1:22:59] he stood on god's word
[1:23:01] regardless of everything happening
[1:23:03] around him
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:24:00] at
[1:24:03] moses actually stood and defied our
[1:24:07] physics our nature
[1:24:14] amen
[1:24:17] just like joshua did to it
[1:24:21] joshua went to the promised land god
[1:24:23] said i promise you this land you're
[1:24:25] going to take this land over joseph
[1:24:33] you know and they stood on god he stood
[1:24:35] on god's word
[1:24:38] he said we're more than able to to
[1:24:40] conquer it
[1:24:46] you know and god has given us his word
[1:24:51] this right here this
[1:24:53] whole armor of god is
[1:24:58] you know it's like you're being enlisted
[1:25:02] and they're giving you this list of
[1:25:04] what's going to protect you it is
[1:25:08] but it's not a lie but
[1:25:11] this is the way to to overcome the devil
[1:25:13] este is
[1:25:16] what does it say when you've done
[1:25:17] everything he says
[1:25:19] when you've done everything you can to
[1:25:20] stand
[1:25:21] you just stand if you say
[1:25:38] what else could i do
[1:25:41] stand on god's word
[1:25:44] you know
[1:25:45] even if death
[1:25:46] were to take me ancilla
[1:25:49] you know by the grace of god i overcame
[1:25:50] that
[1:25:53] i can say now that i'm healed from all
[1:25:54] of my addictions and my problems
[1:26:01] the devil had me bound
[1:26:04] but i'm free
[1:26:06] by the power of jesus christ's blood
[1:26:12] you know i i'm not very good at
[1:26:13] expressing myself no bueno for example
[1:26:17] but
[1:26:18] i have life now but
[1:26:48] i'm not the best at any at anything
[1:26:52] you know i'm i'm like i said i'm just
[1:26:55] like
[1:26:55] barely a fraction of
[1:26:57] of what we have here
[1:27:02] but i know that i want god's word in my
[1:27:04] heart
[1:27:08] you know all these all these uh people
[1:27:12] of the bible that i was going over
[1:27:29] you know but
[1:27:30] we have god's grace and his mercy
[1:27:36] the lamb that was slain before the
[1:27:37] foundation of the world
[1:27:41] jesus
[1:27:42] knows each and every one of you jesus
[1:27:44] christ
[1:27:52] you know he loved he loved us before we
[1:27:54] can
[1:27:55] he loved us before we can love him
[1:28:21] what does it matter if if this world
[1:28:22] falls apart
[1:28:26] if nothing goes right see now
[1:28:28] we have an insert we have an internal
[1:28:30] home waiting for us
[1:28:35] you know we we have an inheritance
[1:28:39] we don't have to do anything not
[1:28:54] we're so
[1:29:05] you know we we may
