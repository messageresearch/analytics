[1:15:46] we have nothing to say

[1:15:54] your divine presence
[1:16:03] i pray you bless everyone that is here
[1:16:05] today
[1:16:08] i pray you grant them the desires of
[1:16:10] their heart
[1:16:12] may it be according to your word
[1:16:17] you said anything that we ask in your
[1:16:19] name
[1:16:20] you would give it to us
[1:16:30] you know the longing the desire that is
[1:16:32] in every heart and this morning
[1:16:37] and give to them your people whatever
[1:16:38] they ask them
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:42] i ask it in the sweet name of the lord
[1:16:44] jesus christ
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:57] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:14] i'll mention it
[1:17:23] i know there's about 50 or 70 people uh
[1:17:25] around that number here in the church
[1:17:26] right now
[1:17:28] is
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:40] the reality is that we didn't want
[1:17:41] everyone to come back
[1:17:44] and i know i knew not everyone was going
[1:17:46] to come
[1:17:48] and as i said there's no problem
[1:17:52] the reason why we don't want everyone to
[1:17:54] come back
[1:17:57] that will cause too much of an issue
[1:17:58] will be too tightly closed
[1:18:04] and just as we are now nicely distanced
[1:18:06] apart we're fine like that
[1:18:23] that she come here to the front and give
[1:18:25] her testimony
[1:18:29] let's pray for her because the sister is
[1:18:31] quite nervous
[1:18:37] we hope that the lord can ease her
[1:18:38] nerves and she can express what she has
[1:18:40] in her heart
[1:18:42] i do wish to say
[1:18:46] what the sister will say in this morning
[1:18:51] it's something that i asked her to give
[1:18:52] her own testimony
[1:18:56] and she asked me what do i speak about
[1:18:58] you already
[1:18:59] familiar and i said sister talk about
[1:19:01] your family
[1:19:03] i didn't tell her what to say exactly
[1:19:19] you can see that it's a bit tied
[1:19:21] together
[1:19:23] with what i want to speak on this
[1:19:25] morning
[1:19:28] may god bless her sister francis alanis
[1:19:48] my name is
[1:19:57] the johnny asked me to give this short
[1:19:58] testimony
[1:20:29] for allowing me to express a little of
[1:20:31] what i have in my heart
[1:20:34] and give a short testimony
[1:20:39] for the honor and the glory of our lord
[1:20:40] jesus christ

[1:28:24] the fight has not been easy because the
[1:28:26] devil walks like a roaring lion
[1:28:28] for those he can devour now the lord has
[1:28:30] blessed me with four children two boys
[1:28:32] and two girls
[1:28:33] some of whom have gone astray and drugs
[1:28:36] have been the most powerful weapon that
[1:28:37] the enemy has used and continues to use
[1:28:40] to destroy
[1:28:41] the young and even adults and as a
[1:28:43] mother it has been very difficult for me
[1:28:45] the saddest and most painful thing that
[1:28:47] has been
[1:28:48] to look is that my children how drugs
[1:28:50] have affected not only their lives but
[1:28:52] also their loved ones
[1:28:54] yet i know that my redeemer liveth and i
[1:28:56] have not lost faith yet
[1:28:58] to see them one day surrender to christ
[1:29:00] because the seed has already been
[1:29:02] planted in them
[1:29:03] and maybe i would not be here to see it
[1:29:05] but i believe with all my heart that god
[1:29:07] will answer the requests and prayers in
[1:29:09] our hearts
[1:29:10] praying for each other claiming our
[1:29:12] loved ones the lord will answer in due
[1:29:15] time
[1:29:16] and about four or five years ago one of
[1:29:17] my daughters was going through a
[1:29:18] difficult time in her life and she
[1:29:20] isolated herself at home
[1:29:22] she did not call me nor did she visit me
[1:29:24] and i knew something was wrong
[1:29:26] so one day my son-in-law called me and
[1:29:28] asked me if
[1:29:29] i could go and stay at his house because
[1:29:31] he had to go out of town to work
[1:29:33] and didn't want to leave my daughter
[1:29:35] home alone and i asked him why what was
[1:29:37] happening
[1:29:38] he replied that she had been cutting
[1:29:40] herself for a long time but she didn't
[1:29:42] want to tell me or didn't want me to
[1:29:44] worry
[1:29:45] i said that was okay and i decided to go
[1:29:47] and see what was happening
[1:29:49] and when i got to their house i was
[1:29:50] surprised at the condition they were in
[1:29:52] the house was a mess trash everywhere
[1:29:54] dirty dishes dirty clothes etc
[1:29:57] so i decided to start cleaning and it
[1:29:59] was so much that i spent
[1:30:00] two entire days cleaning day and night
[1:30:03] and when i finished cleaning i decided
[1:30:05] to pray to for the house and anointed
[1:30:07] with oil
[1:30:08] i had brought an anointed oil which had
[1:30:10] been prayed for at a convention
[1:30:12] and i began to annoy my grandchildren
[1:30:14] and i anointed them with oil
[1:30:16] i also anointed each door and the
[1:30:18] bedrooms and when i got to my daughter's
[1:30:20] room i asked her if she wanted
[1:30:21] me to pray for her she answered yes i
[1:30:24] put oil on her forehead
[1:30:26] her pillow and on the backboard of her
[1:30:28] bed and then i asked her if she believed
[1:30:30] god could heal her
[1:30:31] she answered yes and i told her very
[1:30:33] well close your eyes
[1:30:35] i started praying for her and rebuked
[1:30:37] all the evil spirits that came to my
[1:30:39] mind
[1:30:40] then i said everything is fine don't
[1:30:42] worry anymore
[1:30:43] and and started to leave her bedroom
[1:30:46] when she was about to take the step to
[1:30:48] leave the door of her room
[1:30:50] a loud noise was heard and everything
[1:30:52] went dark the alarm began to ring and
[1:30:54] ring and the cats
[1:30:55] that she had ran from one side to
[1:30:57] another and they jumped on the chairs
[1:30:59] from here to hit there
[1:31:01] my daughter got scared and was telling
[1:31:02] me what's going on mom i replied nothing
[1:31:05] my daughter don't be afraid
[1:31:07] everything is fine now someone is angry
[1:31:09] but everything is fine
[1:31:11] god healed you we try to turn the lights
[1:31:14] back on and turn off the alarm
[1:31:16] everything and and everything was going
[1:31:18] back to normal
[1:31:19] god healed her since that day and she
[1:31:22] has not cut herself again
[1:31:23] the lord healed her and i am more than
[1:31:25] grateful for that
[1:31:26] to him be all the honor and the glory
[1:31:29] although the devil continues to bother
[1:31:31] my children tormenting them i know that
[1:31:33] they are children of god
[1:31:35] and that god is going to bring them
[1:31:36] forward they are going to surrender to
[1:31:38] god
[1:31:39] what i want to say to the mothers and
[1:31:41] the parents
[1:31:42] who are having difficult times with
[1:31:43] their children who are tormented by
[1:31:45] drugs or any other spirit
[1:31:47] not to give up to keep praying for them
[1:31:50] to keep going
[1:31:51] and to trust god that we have a powerful
[1:31:53] god who can do everything
[1:31:54] no matter what the devil brings us god
[1:31:57] is more powerful than him
[1:31:58] god is going to bring us out of this he
[1:32:01] will prevail
[1:32:15] god bless the sister for giving us a
[1:32:17] testimony
[1:32:20] now if you see what i can see
[1:32:23] what the sister just expressed
[1:32:29] she says she's making
[1:32:32] intercession for her children
[1:32:51] not just the parents but the entire
[1:32:52] church
[1:32:56] the other day i asked the brothers to
[1:32:58] start praying for each other
[1:33:02] especially the youth
[1:33:05] they have a great necessity
[1:33:10] if you listen to what the sister said
[1:33:16] she rebuked those evil spirits
[1:33:20] and when she rebuked them they left
[1:33:23] and she says
[1:33:27] it's expressed in words even the brother
[1:33:28] read it
[1:33:31] is whatever came to my mind i believe
[1:33:36] that's exactly the time that we're
[1:33:37] living in
[1:33:38] it this is the time of the mind
[1:33:44] we're not living in the time of the feet
[1:33:47] or the legs
[1:34:02] and when we have the mind of christ
[1:34:06] and it's the holy spirit that's coming
[1:34:08] to you habla
[1:34:09] whatever you speak whatever you long for
[1:34:13] whatever you say that will come to pass
[1:34:28] for someone to have a word or an
[1:34:31] expression
[1:34:36] and then that thought comes down and
[1:34:37] then it's a thought express
[1:34:43] i wanted the sisters to say that it was
[1:34:58] and i'll show you through the slides if
[1:35:00] they could put on the title of the
[1:35:01] lesson
[1:35:12] put it on the screen do you know what
[1:35:15] that is
[1:35:17] it's the cloud we all know what that is
[1:35:22] that is the head that is christ
[1:35:26] our head amen
[1:35:46] i know some people say brother johnny
[1:35:47] you speak so elevated so harsh
[1:35:54] but if you can understand my purpose it
[1:35:56] might go behind it to where i'm taking
[1:35:57] it
[1:36:00] when you connect with god
[1:36:07] then you come to be god himself
[1:36:10] you become an entity you don't
[1:36:14] need someone else
[1:36:17] because you've entered god's kingdom and
[1:36:19] then in english
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:08] i hope you can bear with me because we
[1:37:09] did begin a little late
[1:37:16] and my main focal point is this i'll
[1:37:18] explain it
[1:37:35] if you can turn to second corinthians
[1:37:36] chapter 12 9 through 12.
[1:37:42] now remember what i'll speak this
[1:37:44] morning is tied together with what the
[1:37:45] sister said
[1:37:46] what a way of learning english now i'll
[1:37:48] speak in english
[1:37:49] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:37:50] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:37:52] made perfect in weakness
[1:37:54] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:37:57] glory in my infirmities
[1:37:59] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:38:01] me
[1:38:14] el poder de
[1:38:23] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:38:25] weakness
[1:38:28] the
[1:38:42] you're
[1:38:55] we want the mind of christ to take over
[1:38:57] our mind
[1:39:01] and that's the way we are that's where
[1:39:02] we find ourselves
[1:39:05] in this world in this life all it is is
[1:39:08] just
[1:39:08] full of problems
[1:39:23] it's a very distressful time
[1:39:26] and i know i know you can hear what i'm
[1:39:29] saying
[1:39:31] now watch what verse 10 says
[1:39:35] therefore i take pleasure in my
[1:39:37] infirmities
[1:40:04] i don't know what to do i don't even
[1:40:05] know what to think my mind doesn't help
[1:40:07] me
[1:40:10] but the bible here tells me therefore i
[1:40:13] take pleasure
[1:40:14] in infirmities
[1:40:19] when i am weak
[1:40:23] you got to get yourself out of the way
[1:40:25] brother get yourself out of the way
[1:40:27] me me it's what i think no it's not what
[1:40:29] you think it's what
[1:40:30] god thinks
[1:40:46] i'm talking about not people from the
[1:40:48] outside but people of the message
[1:40:52] well you see my my kids are they're not
[1:40:54] following along they're they've worked
[1:40:55] they've gone wayward
[1:41:00] somebody might tell well if you if it
[1:41:01] was really right and there were good
[1:41:03] parents his kids wouldn't be lost
[1:41:11] and then the reproach comes
[1:41:16] in and necessities well there's a lot of
[1:41:19] things there we can
[1:41:20] we could put in there
[1:41:23] in persecutions are we persecuted
[1:41:29] persecuted
[1:41:47] so we are persecuted
[1:41:50] in distress for christ's sake
[1:41:55] in distress for christ's sake
[1:42:12] my
[1:42:26] because that's exactly what's happening
[1:42:28] right now
[1:42:32] and the bride illinovia are becoming one
[1:42:35] converting
[1:42:36] and we're being placed
[1:42:39] in the head la

[1:43:09] there where the spice went right in
[1:43:11] there and tasted of the things from

[1:43:19] millennium
[1:43:21] millennium how many know that you mean
[1:43:24] just
[1:43:24] one hand
[1:43:29] that's right canaan is not the type of

[1:43:48] land which is canaanite
[1:43:57] jericho was the first city inside the
[1:43:59] promised land canaan

[1:44:17] they had bad fighting killings and
[1:44:19] everything else
[1:44:20] in canaan
[1:44:26] type the holy canaanite is a type of the
[1:44:28] holy ghost
[1:44:46] is where they settle down with the holy
[1:44:47] ghost
[1:44:50] now we've come into the land of the holy
[1:44:52] ghost
[1:44:55] now we have a certain right
[1:44:59] but in in the holy ghost
[1:45:02] let's hear what brother brown says here
[1:45:03] yeah i'm looking this is the man of
[1:45:04] branham be quiet johnny just read the
[1:45:06] quote
[1:45:09] okay canaan is where they settle down
[1:45:11] with the holy spirit
[1:45:17] because they still had wars and if you
[1:45:21] don't believe you have wars if you stay
[1:45:22] creek
[1:45:24] just get the holy spirit once
[1:45:28] one time you get the holy ghost
[1:45:32] it's not going to be everything nice and
[1:45:33] tranquil and peaceful and everything
[1:45:38] it's going to be it's a war war brother
[1:45:42] gerard okay when you enter into the
[1:45:45] promised land the holy ghost
[1:45:49] time to relax and sit down and drink
[1:45:51] your tea and relax
[1:45:56] it's time to get up it's time
[1:45:59] to fight it's important
[1:46:02] it's time for war yes what are you doing
[1:46:06] what do you do in canaan they were
[1:46:09] possessing their rights
[1:46:16] they could not possess their rights till
[1:46:18] they got into canaan
[1:46:22] they didn't own nothing in the
[1:46:24] wilderness
[1:46:53] amen and we got rights
[1:46:56] when you received the holy ghost
[1:47:01] i understand how brother bram types
[1:47:02] these types
[1:47:05] of typos
[1:47:33] you have to fight for every
[1:47:53] how many of you parents are longing for
[1:47:55] or praying for your sons and daughters
[1:47:58] almost all the brothers the devil he's
[1:48:02] tremendous
[1:48:56] bring my son and daughter to your feet
[1:49:17] but if this misbehaved they're not a
[1:49:19] christian they don't want anything with
[1:49:20] god that doesn't matter
[1:49:24] if you join to become one with god
[1:49:54] oh brother
[1:50:08] he's
[1:50:22] not only is he my pastor he's an apostle
[1:50:25] he says that the bride enters the head
[1:50:32] she comes into the head the mind of god
[1:50:35] but the prophet
[1:51:34] and that son and daughter of god that
[1:51:35] does not want to come to god
[1:51:38] but because of your prayers i believe
[1:51:41] all my children
[1:51:43] have eternal life
[1:52:27] my children will surrender to you lord
[1:52:29] that's right that's right
[1:52:31] off of my crown territory your ground
[1:52:34] satan says
[1:52:38] yeah but wait a minute i've got the mind
[1:52:41] of christ
[1:52:42] tengo la
[1:52:54] you can have the same thought that god
[1:52:56] has
[1:53:23] someday the the third pool will kick in
[1:53:29] you don't i'll serve notice on you by
[1:53:31] the holy spirit
[1:53:33] guidance is
[1:54:09] because in canaan they killed and burned
[1:54:11] and took cities
[1:54:15] there will be no death in the millennium
[1:54:18] in the millennium but another thing it
[1:54:19] does
[1:54:35] and the anointing of the sacrificial
[1:54:38] lamb in the wilderness
[1:54:42] and then entering into the land that
[1:54:44] they had been promised
[1:54:48] now what is the land promised to the new
[1:54:51] testament believers
[1:54:56] promise is the holy spirit
[1:55:01] now you have the holy spirit
[1:55:16] apply the
[1:55:30] hallelujah amen
[1:55:34] amen thank you lord jesus gracias jesus
[1:55:38] now the cloud if you can put the cloud
[1:55:40] up there
[1:55:42] now let me explain something to you is
[1:55:57] he says i do nothing until the father
[1:55:59] shows me jesus
[1:56:05] the eternal spirit father eternal el
[1:56:09] padre was before the son jesus jesus
[1:56:12] christ
[1:56:27] amen amen and we were saved by the blood
[1:56:30] of jesus christ
[1:56:33] but even the son had to be subject to
[1:56:35] the father
[1:56:38] so jesus has a head jesus
[1:56:54] and who is the head of the church
[1:56:57] jesus jesus the holy spirit
[1:57:01] amen amen
[1:57:04] a pastor of the church neglected
[1:57:07] the head of the church is
[1:57:14] and i'm going to say something here in a
[1:57:16] minute
[1:57:18] um i get myself in trouble by saying
[1:57:21] these comments
[1:57:32] now it's a real fine line here
[1:57:36] now if the pastor is the head of the
[1:57:39] church
[1:57:42] does that mean that you're married to
[1:57:44] the pastor
[1:57:45] significant question right
[1:57:49] what i understand what brother brown
[1:57:51] says
[1:57:53] we have to be married to the word
[1:57:56] jesus christ jesus christ and when you
[1:57:59] say the pastor of the head of the church
[1:58:04] that's a
[1:58:19] now i've looked and looked for quotes
[1:58:21] where brother branham
[1:58:22] says that all right
[1:58:27] where the pastor pastor is the spiritual
[1:58:30] husband
[1:58:30] of the church is
[1:59:00] the mystical body of
[1:59:13] your first pastor supreme pastor is not
[1:59:17] me
[1:59:17] no soy no sir no senor according to the
[1:59:21] bible conformed
[1:59:22] just read the bible
[1:59:25] your pastor superstore talking to the
[1:59:28] wives now
[1:59:43] pastor okay now
[1:59:46] now the wife alright when
[1:59:49] she's at home casa and the husband is
[1:59:53] there
[1:59:53] he is to be in subjection to her husband
[1:59:56] is
[2:00:17] then who's the pastor or the head of the
[2:00:19] house the wife is
[2:00:21] la the wife is
[2:00:39] because he's gone
[2:00:42] because the wife
[2:00:45] is the head of the home
[2:00:49] right now the messenger is
[2:00:55] physically he's not here with us so
[2:00:58] right now the bride
[2:01:00] she too becomes the head
[2:01:06] of this
[2:02:02] but inside
[2:02:44] i don't know if you're understanding me
[2:02:45] okay
[2:02:48] let's read a scripture colossians 1 18.
[2:02:53] he is the head of the body the church
[2:02:58] is
[2:03:12] okay it's very clear there right now he
[2:03:15] is the head of the body the church
[2:03:20] now ephesians 5 121-24
[2:03:25] cinco de la
[2:03:28] yourself one to another in the fear of
[2:03:30] god
[2:03:33] wives submit yourself unto your own
[2:03:35] husbands as unto the lord las casas
[2:03:38] maridos
[2:03:42] how many here are subject to your own
[2:03:44] husbands
[2:03:47] no brother when i speak my husband he
[2:03:50] shivers
[2:03:51] he trembles because i'm the man i wore
[2:03:54] the
[2:04:26] even as christ is the head of the church
[2:04:30] and he is the savior of the body
[2:04:33] el salvador therefore the church is
[2:04:35] subject into christ
[2:05:02] and i understand that she is the boss
[2:05:04] sir new things and my wife
[2:05:17] but ultimately in the end the man is the
[2:05:19] head of the household
[2:05:28] i'll read you a quote right now it's
[2:05:29] nearly time for me to get down
[2:05:31] i do apologize

[2:06:14] is
[2:06:20] and i just said physically your husband
[2:06:22] is your head he's your pastor
[2:06:27] now for us to be in god's kingdom

[2:09:20] reading the message
[2:09:28] the holy spirit has to reveal it to you
[2:09:44] whatever you say that's
[2:09:47] what it will be so be careful with what
[2:09:51] you say
[2:09:52] be careful what you say notice now god
[2:09:54] is the husband of the church
[2:09:58] is
[2:10:03] who is the husband of the church
[2:10:07] christ in the church is just a being
[2:10:09] made known
[2:10:12] christos
[2:10:21] well i thought we were married to christ
[2:10:24] same person persona and the church
[2:10:27] is his bride amen amen
[2:10:31] what is it not ten people
[2:10:34] the head chip in the body has become one
[2:10:36] unit
[2:10:40] united
[2:11:08] but he also has a head correcto is that
[2:11:12] right
[2:11:12] yes and that pillar of fire
[2:11:17] is that one that's there the same one
[2:11:23] the pillar of fire and jesus are the
[2:11:25] same one
[2:11:27] but even he has a head amen
[2:11:30] amen
[2:11:33] it's got manifested in his people his
[2:11:35] deal's money for someone support
[2:12:02] there's only one name given under heaven
[2:12:09] that is the name of the lord jesus
[2:12:11] christ
[2:12:13] we only worship one person one man and
[2:12:16] that's jesus
[2:12:31] great revelation glory to god
[2:12:46] body of christ
[2:12:50] proving manifested like god did that
[2:12:52] body did compromise
[2:12:59] his bride
[2:13:05] it's the spirit working in the flesh of
[2:13:07] the church
[2:13:10] like it worked in the in the flesh of
[2:13:12] jesus christ
[2:13:57] head
[2:14:00] but it's like the woman when he's not
[2:14:02] there
[2:14:03] she's the head
[2:14:07] but she has a headache
[2:14:11] and the bride always yields to her head
[2:14:15] which is the seven things which are the
[2:14:18] tastes
[2:14:19] which is the message did you understand
[2:14:39] ask and then it came to remind me
[2:14:42] my children and says
[2:14:50] so right then enamour she was the head
[2:14:52] of that
[2:15:58] the mind of christ my god
[2:16:02] they don't know it no los sabin they
[2:16:04] have to do it anyhow
[2:16:07] did you notice a woman when she get
[2:16:08] married
[2:16:11] she put the bell over her face why she's
[2:16:14] coming to her head
[2:16:44] or she's coming to her husband
[2:16:48] just like just like rebecca didn't ask
[2:16:51] she put a veil over her face to meet
[2:16:53] isaac
[2:16:56] she has no more heads
[2:17:40] but are you reading between the lines if
[2:17:43] we do that
[2:17:44] we're submitting ourselves to the words
[2:17:47] you've got to submit yourself to the
[2:17:49] word
[2:17:51] not to each other
[2:18:08] we submit ourselves to the words
[2:18:12] that we're married to the word
[2:18:16] word to his doctrine
[2:18:20] takes no thought up for herself
[2:18:49] it's a perfect place calling
[2:19:03] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[2:19:08] it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a
[2:19:11] perfect people
[2:19:15] because you have to stand and be married
[2:19:17] to the perfect son of god
[2:19:25] marry johnny alvarado marry a man
[2:19:30] oh mary the son of god
[2:20:00] their place
[2:20:10] oh my god i don't know whether it could
[2:20:13] be right or not
[2:20:14] no
[2:20:29] that's where people misunderstand what
[2:20:31] brother branham says
[2:20:34] he's referencing lot's wife
[2:20:38] and here lot's wife she's the one that's
[2:20:40] speaking
[2:20:42] how can i overcome go to the message
[2:20:49] and keep in mind that it's lot's wife
[2:20:51] speaking i don't know whether i
[2:20:53] it could be right or not no esme
[2:21:10] even though he's my husband but yet
[2:21:14] your pastor superstore is your husband
[2:21:24] it's very
[2:23:03] you've got to know not just say well i
[2:23:05] see the other things doing it i see a
[2:23:07] sign
[2:23:13] don't misunderstand
[2:23:25] well i looked and looked and looked
[2:23:27] where brother branham has a quote that
[2:23:28] says it exactly like that
[2:23:38] i challenge you come and bring me look
[2:23:40] here's what brother branham says right
[2:23:41] here
[2:23:43] because this quote
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:26] everything has its
[2:24:37] i'm the dumbest person here and i'm
[2:24:39] understanding what brother branham is
[2:24:40] saying here
[2:24:41] your pastor is your husband
[2:24:48] sister did you understand he's your
[2:24:50] pastor
[2:24:54] and then i looked for brother brenham
[2:24:55] says the pastor this is the church
[2:25:00] where brother branham says that the
[2:25:01] local pastor he's the head of the church
[2:25:06] i do believe it but please come and show
[2:25:08] me
[2:25:46] didn't you say that when william branham
[2:25:47] is gone brother neville is there
[2:26:05] and brother cox who was a deacon
[2:26:10] brother cox says he gave a testimony
[2:26:15] because he was deacon of the church
[2:27:07] i don't know what's going on with this
[2:27:08] generation of people don't put your own
[2:27:10] interpretation today
[2:27:12] it's 12 o'clock
[2:27:28] where it says that the pastor is the
[2:27:29] spiritual husband of the church
[2:27:31] i understand he's the ha he's the head
[2:27:33] of that
[2:27:35] but to the point that you're married to
[2:27:37] him
[2:27:40] we're supposed to be married to the
[2:27:42] world
[2:27:46] it doesn't matter if you're married to
[2:27:47] the pastor if you're not married to the
[2:27:49] word
[2:27:49] amen amen
[2:27:53] because in the beginning
[2:27:56] the word made itself flesh and a man
[2:28:00] and then that word made itself yeah
[2:28:06] now she is also ahead
[2:28:09] no just because she's ahead does not
[2:28:11] mean
[2:28:14] that she has the third pool sword
[2:28:17] no sir she's subject right sister hatty
[2:28:21] right what do you want
[2:28:22] i don't know i want the
[2:28:33] are we subject to who to william branham
[2:28:36] to jesus
[2:28:38] we're
[2:29:02] then we'll come down and then you can
[2:29:08] go and have some lunch and enjoy each
[2:29:11] other's company
[2:29:12] honey talk to your wife and then lay the
[2:29:14] cards on the table and say honey
[2:29:17] who's the boss here
[2:29:20] is
[2:29:34] is
[2:29:48] both he and she surrendered to christ
[2:29:51] which is the word
[2:29:53] there's no longer going to be an issue
[2:29:57] because many women want to boss their
[2:29:59] husbands around
[2:30:01] us and i've seen you sisters
[2:30:04] not only in this church but in other
[2:30:06] churches i've seen it
[2:30:08] just look they snapped their fingers
[2:30:15] and then they the way they speak to the
[2:30:16] man
[2:30:18] like very mean
[2:30:21] old man i told you to do this what's the
[2:30:23] matter with you
[2:30:25] and the poor man he's like
[2:30:28] oh my god the power of christ can plow
[2:30:30] you
[2:30:44] look if you love god i love god
[2:30:48] we must have peace
[2:30:52] you don't boss neither do i boss around
[2:30:54] he is the one that bosses around
[2:30:56] he is
[2:31:02] the holy spirit okay let's just read one
[2:31:04] more and i'll get down and forgive me
[2:31:05] for taking so long it's past 12 o'clock
[2:31:07] already forgive me
[2:31:21] hopefully once you get home and eat you
[2:31:23] eat a nice big chop or some pork chop or
[2:31:26] some big steak
[2:31:30] and you say man i have to forget what
[2:31:32] brother johnny said and eat your little
[2:31:34] tacos or whatever
[2:31:36] but never forget what the seventh angel
[2:31:40] told us
[2:31:42] i like that because i believe it's
[2:31:44] apostolic me
[2:31:48] because the head the highest order in
[2:31:51] the church
[2:31:51] is the shepherd porque vela cabeza
[2:32:11] and how is god going to ever work in
[2:32:13] this church
[2:32:16] you see it just cannot get it see us
[2:32:20] so if i believe that i'm being made of
[2:32:22] god
[2:32:48] and i believe it's on the verge right
[2:32:57] [Applause]
[2:33:04] thank you lord jesus jesus
[2:33:09] i am praying oh god that everyone here
[2:33:11] would understand what i'm trying to say
[2:33:16] i'm not trying to be anti-christian
[2:33:19] not trying to be against the words
[2:33:22] i wanna i wanna just say the word that's
[2:33:26] it the way the word says
[2:33:29] i'm not against anyone i'm foreign
