having delivering his father and i was 11 years old and i was she was going to labour and as she was crying and moaning and groaning at that time i never seen somebody going to labor so i'm there for it could be in hours i was worried about it okay and then after hearing her cry all this time i heard a baby cry and everybody's laughing in there you know this question i could hear about five people laughing and laughing i couldn't figure out why my sister was crying and then you hear a baby cry and then everybody's laughing baby i was the first to hear him crying on the day they put him under he was having problems breathing i called him up and he told me uncle they're going to put me under the hotel and the words that i use i said don't worry i said i'm going to be with you instead of saying i'm going to be praying for you i said i'm going to be with you right now in spirit i'm with them special place on the day uh that boss call me where you it texts me rightly [Music] and i told myself i said i'm going to go because he he'd been telling me about the child i said i'm going to go to his house i'm going to raise the child up like so there again i want to go to the i'm going to read on on and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and the disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them amen suffer this little serum to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of god whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as the little child he should not enter foreign do this in the name of

long [Music] set me free [Music] is [Music] christ jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] how many believe that this morning it's something i believe with all my heart mucho i had a i had a great debt and i was unable to pay it not one time i visited jeffersonville i stayed for a week at a hotel and as a human being i was worried because i knew i had to pay sierta i was there at the hotel for seven days someone said somebody already paid your bill you don't have to worry about it how do you think i felt brothers we owed something that no one could ever pay juan and john wept because he looked down he looked up inside and no one but but for he has overcome i feel like i'm 19 or 20 years of age right now gracias thank you lauren we appreciate every one of you brothers let's open our bibles [Music] we pray to the lord that he can give us of his guidance so that he can help us hide we'll be going to the book of first samuel capitul chapter 17 verse 31 primera de samuel and i'll only read verse 31 and then you can be seated and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him celestial let us pray heavenly father this morning we want to thank you for me for that price that you paid for me when we say for me that's something that's personal but this morning and can realize that they are unable to play there it doesn't matter how much money they have today 58 million dollars were paid for three men to go to space 58 million for three passengers to go to outer space no idea there is thank you for the life rewarded to we appreciate the musicians as well so that he can help us and bless us this morning first corinthians chapter 2. i'll just be reading only for four verses and we thank the lord for how good he has been with everybody many times when we come forth to the brothers that could sit at the church but today gracias adios we thank god for science has increased in a wonderful way and as sons and daughters of god we have to know how to use it because if not that would turn into a giant and this morning my uh title of my message i want to call it david and the giant dapidi and as a subtitle i would like to call it god's numerals god's numerals and the years that the lord allows us to travel in this life it's always made up of numbers we know that it's happened to several pressures when i came to you came not with the excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god brother bannon would always emphasize and he would say i never had an education i'm not as educated as other men are you tomorrow i just uh pay attention to the natural things to be able to talk about spiritual things hermanos educacion as education is something that's good we would always want and we want for our children to have an education not only here locally but them that are watching online as well there's a lot that watch us online so we want god to bless and help them los hollande es que nos maybe they're not watching right now at this moment at 10 in the morning because they have their own services after the service and they watch us so may god bless the young people and we uh perhaps many of us like myself we didn't have the way amina gustava escuela mencantaval but unfortunately i did not have the way and they have a good job in employment to take their family forward now the apostle paul here is talking to us about that he says and my brother when i came to you came not with the excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified christ christ and him crucified may that be our main theme may that be our everything but because many times when we come up here we're uh we're fearful and we read here that paul was with fear and trembling not because he didn't know what to say because he did and what a privilege for example many students that have the opportunity to go to the university have gone universidad if they reach the university even their parents are proud of them and here it is i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling enemy espiritu [Music] in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power we go through very tough days and from then on we have to go to calvary every one of us i have to preach because we want to say something that will actually help you that's why we come here to this place so that god can help us if you all know why you are a traveler and god will help us through the ministry god will help us through what was already said yes it's already there brothers we go through a calvary the one that says he does it will let me know so that i can do the same as well because it truly is a calvary i remember when i would come when i was a visitor entrepreneurs i remember when i went to the mcdowell church and brother johnny allowed me to speak and i mentioned it i said the brothers that help are brother johnny siempre esteem always be ready always be prepared because you don't know when brother johnny will call you pare so you can stand up here to say something to god's people and so we prayed at our house we study at our house and we sit down at church you are a bingo i stay listen now i come to this i'm i'm part of a member of this church so i come to sit down in here and when i hear these young people brothers when i go out and i and i greet my brother i young people that the lord has given us gloria glory to be to be honest this morning i want to repeat i want to explain and talk about predicates on subjects that the brothers the preachers have already spoken and of course something that brother adam has already said verse 4 again and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom si no con demostration of an israel everyone knows that and we're still in the battle brothers gloria glory to his name uh representative for they had to fight for every inch of ground were as they were going forward blessed be the name of our lord now this morning i would like to speak about david and the giants and i want to mention that i also want to talk about joshua and caleb and if you notice all the preachers if you go two months in the past and you just pay attention to the kind of preachings that we've had here today every one of them in some way or another have mentioned joshua and caleb uh in the meeting that we had we had brother judah mata with he almost read the same scripture to us and the message brother eli preached on friday was really awesome it was really good the next day my son jonathan comes some of you know him and some of you don't but he told me i want you to tell brother eli castillo that he tell him that i really loved what he said on friday but make sure you tell him when i also when i saw that the the logo said jericho on it i joined with the thought that brother donais had enough there's other places that the name of the church is also jericho but when i heard what brother ordonez explained about jericho represent because the name of our place is jericho tabernacle and i really liked what our brother said about joshua and we've read it but maybe perhaps i just didn't pay attention but when the brother mentioned joshua the destroying angel [Music] lord we're happy and grateful with the lord but only one house remained god help us bless us to be able to to do that blessed be the name of the lord david in the giants i don't know how many are fighting against giants but i do it every day every day every day i'm fighting and there is not a day that passes that i don't fight it's on gigantes and they are giants many times they want to they want to scare us and terrorize us but uh know one thing if god if the brothers can put up the picture that i gave him we're going to talk about a giant media did anyone anyone ever think what was the height or the measurement of this giant goliath i was interested to go and look that up and i found out that goliath was nine feet and six inches nine feet six inches tall uh the player that you see right there in that picture is eight three three he's and just look at the uh the size of the other player that wants to take the ball away just look how uh he's looking down on him he's looking down on him as if he was nothing like he's looking down saying like what are you to do to me just imagine goliath thank you we have another one hopefully they can put the next one this picture that's there is an americano it's a it's an american he was born in an eastern city here of the united states unfortunately at the age of 22 years of age he passed away because his heart couldn't endure problems he had heart problems because of his height he was eight feet eleven inches tall ocho pierce onsen eight feet 11 inches tall persona natural just look how an average size person looks next to him so just so you can bear in mind this great giant that we're talking about so that's what uh his height was 811. and goliath was nine feet tall and six inches he was nearly a foot taller than this man now what was david's high cinco pies or less five feet cinco pierce or less five feet or menos 11. he wasn't five eight or five eleven cinco piers or less five feet or menos when he came face to face with this giant ese gigante god is in numbers just look how they look how about we get you and put you there in the picture help us brothers and sisters we're fighting against giants every day we fight giants is if we trust in our own height what height we're trusting in him in the same one that david trusted him blessed be the name of the lord amen brothers the one that david trusted it if you trust in the one david trump servant we shall also be overcomers blessed be the name of the lord the greatest battle ever fought and i like i said at the beginning i'm going to mention things that the brothers have already spoken about when rodriguez reportes over nebraska when brother rodriguez was given his report about nebraska i was sitting down there and i have a notebook with me and i'm always writing down it's a it's a habit of mine especially now with the age that i have so i take notes in my notebook for example the preachers that preach i write it down here in my notebook adolfo mata i have brother adolfo mata tengo rodriguez i have brother mike rodriguez tango al hermano eliaser castillo and her brother eliaser castillo hermano marco santana and i have my brother marco santana i have them all here gracias adios we thank god for the ministry that god has given us and i praise the name of the lord for that and we learn from every single one of them and you learn as well rodriguez rodriguez he read a quote in the message the greatest battle ever fought ime gusto and i liked it i really loved it i wrote it down and i went and searched the message the greatest battle ever fought [Music] blessed just pay attention to what brother rodriguez read when he gave the testimony about the brothers in nebraska if you can find it that's fine if not just listen this is he says now this is what i'm saying this morning i'm storing food estoy he doesn't change he's the same and those is are you so there is a storehouse what are store houses for los alamos store houses are made with the intention to store up food los alamos or storages are meant to put away thousands of ganons of diesel of gas now the profit when he would go to jeffersonville when he was in jeffersonville he said we're going to preach the messages here because there'll be food in due season and he would come to jeffersonville and there that's where he goes so that's what i'm talking about this morning i'm storing food how many believe that i'm storing food imagine i was actually scared when i saw it for the first time i got scared of california la paz baja california solamente la paz when there wasn't a rodeo you would either arrive by plane or buy a ship juanitos and of course juanito saucedo couldn't arrive in la paz on a plane i went and uh i boarded the ship uh it was called that was the name of the ship and around two in the morning i got up from my seat and i went outside and i thought i was going to see lights and i didn't see any lights what was happening was actually i was falling down so i had an experience right that i said to the lord if you allow me to get yourself i'll promise i'll think about it before i board another ship so it's better that we don't drink so much water they say he says we might finish the water at the sea two little fish at the sea i think it's better if we don't drink up that much water because we can run it out it doesn't make any sense right it's the sea in egypt now those great storehouses were they stored up for seven years of prosperity brothers and sisters just imagine two little mice they might say oh we better not eat so much when we come to hear the message when god speaks to us through the vessel that he appointed what we're listening is food for us and they're taking it out of that great storehouse so blessed be the name of our lord food so you have something to eat so that you have something to feast upon get it on your tapes maybe when i'm long ways away if you have if you have a job where you can read there i'll go and any moment that you can read something let me tell you the last quote that i'm going to read once i usually would start work at 11 at night i would wake up an hour and 20 minutes earlier [Music] so i saw the starting time that i had to work and i said go back to berwinito [Music] something began to prick me it says get up you lazy man he says get up don't be lazy study a bit so i got up never sleep and it says this food storing it in the storehouse i don't know where the trip is [Music] that's the same thing we do yo solamente i just follow him that's the number gloria praise his name let's go to our next our next quote i were talking in the background and i was asking my brother i like that because my mind at this age i'm very forgetful about anything but my brother and concerning events how many times about the power of the spoken word and talking in the back with my brother we began to talk and we noticed that at least five in the same message the greatest battle ever fought now page 24. page 24 hopefully the brothers can find it and blessed be the name of the lord i will be reading paragraph 151 or rather 152. hallelujah he says god dresses his army hallelujah hallelujah brother branham says god dresses his army and then he says hallelujah [Music] what kind of equipment do we use for the castillo on friday what kind of equipment do we use the word of god [Music] according to hebrews 4. we're talking so that you can have a picture in your mind about what we're trying to talk about the spirit of the sword they say la palabras he says the word of god is sharper than a two-edged sword according to hebrews 4. amen brothers let's here's where we're going to start talking about the gracias adios numeros god's numerals and we thank god for his numerals do you know when brother juanito knew how to multiply and divide and as i mentioned before i really liked schools and maybe with what i say you might say back oh brother i don't really i think you really didn't like it i was in second grade math was always something that would cause me headaches whenever we had to do that at school for me that 19 he says now i want you to bear in mind he but we have to know we're coming out of the world we're coming out of the wilderness he says i want you to bear in mind there is a church and a bride and he says and god runs his messages in the numerals of the bible do you believe it i believe it this morning god runs his message in the numerals of the bible and if you get something that flies off one of those numbers you better watch if you keep reading you'll find brother branham said it's like a rifle even though you have a license but you cannot just hunt any animals it has to be the specific animal that they're telling you that it's the season of hunting for that animal amen he says if the rifle the hunting brothers if you i aim the rifle and the sight is fine or maybe your rifle needs to be adjusted we know that gas today is very up in prices so we would like to find a gas station that would sell the lowest and many times we're going through corners just watching but we can't find something that's cheaper california especially in california super expansive in california hermanos hermanos brothers and sisters but we have to fill our tanks with gases we have to put gas in the car no matter the price look you are going to you idiot so what i do with god's help is i keep the tank full and every on every third day i go to a gas a gas station and i fill it up and i only have to pay fifteen dollars even though the price is being so high sometimes i have to pay 20 and they have to give me some money because the gas tank is letting us know that we're almost out of gas but thank god we're on a saturday and then sunday's coming up and we know that we have to we have to go we have to we have to get uh come to a gas station because our car is being left without any fuel so when we come to church why do we come out to fill our cup once again i don't know how you are this morning [Music] the lord will [Music] let's go to the last quote and if the musicians would like to come forward in the message looking away to jesus yes is [Music] upon a human being i i didn't finish uh speaking about sister brian sister brianna always wishing her heart to have a girl [Music] she began to feel something inside of her just like sister hattie began to feel something when brother brennan began to testify if it happened back then it's also happening now with us sister briana asked for a girl is sister brianna here today they went out and you know what god gave her una nina a baby girl herman and she dedicated her he says for the first time this ever happened the third pull upon a human being was a little humble woman with a little humble woman sisters many times we talk about the brothers the brothers and the brothers it was a woman how many women do we have here this evening a woman he says that making about two hundred dollars a year for her living estonia all she got out of her little farm her husband had died two children that had turned kind of wild and just notice with sister hattie wright donated 20 of that to the building of this tabernacle let's keep reading if the brothers can put it yes and he says mera had give me some money that morning for groceries mira had to give me some money that morning for the groceries and i was going to give it back to her that day to whose sister had it right and i was going to give it back to her that day estaba while i was down there so that she wouldn't have to pay it but she wouldn't take it and blessed be the name of the lord i think about the word woman i'll just leave it there because my time is up when god and we'll just leave it at the part where it says and when and we'll leave it hanging because the good stuff is coming afterwards i've always told the brothers when i have to preach god doesn't give you what you want god doesn't give you juanito if you go give her what she wants and i'll just leave you hanging there blessed be the name of the lord gracias father we thank you this morning you're very good it towards is your mercy endureth forever lord i started off by saying that we're living under numerals and i [Music] if there is someone that needs a bit of fuel if there is someone that just needs a little bit you're here this morning to give it to them i don't know if someone came in this morning but if someone came in defeated today i pray and ask you that you can help them him and her but so they can leave victorious from this place so that he or she can leave this place being victorious we commit all this in your hands in the precious name of our lord jesus christ us we all
