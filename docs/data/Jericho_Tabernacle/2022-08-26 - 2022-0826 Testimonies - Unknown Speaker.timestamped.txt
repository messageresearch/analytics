[14:06] it was a surprise that i was going to
[14:08] ask that i was going to speak first
[14:15] i told my husband that they wanted to
[14:17] give a testimony but unless there was
[14:19] nobody that put god on the list
[14:21] [Music]
[14:26] i want to thank the lord for all of his
[14:28] blessings
[14:43] i asked the lord to return to me the joy
[14:45] of my salvation
[14:51] on friday i sang the special
[14:55] campaign
[14:57] [Music]
[15:07] and during the campaign i would ask the
[15:09] lord to help me to get rid of those
[15:11] things so i can get closer to him
[15:21] [Music]
[15:23] and on friday brother anthony who he
[15:25] spoke he spoke on specific scriptures
[15:27] that were
[15:29] important to me
[15:36] um
[15:40] and on saturday when brother matas
[15:42] preached my daughter wouldn't let me
[15:44] enjoy the service i was outside the
[15:46] majority of the time
[15:52] nope
[15:55] i heard some few things but i couldn't
[15:57] grab my whole thoughts together
[16:03] and i said well maybe i won't receive
[16:05] anything but that's fine
[16:14] there was a prayer line that went up but
[16:16] i didn't really feel the need to go up
[16:25] and towards the end i filled the pool
[16:27] and i left my daughter with the sister
[16:28] and
[16:29] i went up
[16:30] um
[16:42] i was being sincere with the lord
[16:43] telling the lord things that were on the
[16:46] way of me serving him
[16:48] he
[17:05] and when the prayer line started i asked
[17:06] the lord to take those things away from
[17:07] my heart
[17:10] and asking for the joy of my salvation
[17:19] my brother grabbed my hand and gave me
[17:21] the answer when i was waiting from the
[17:23] lord
[17:28] [Music]
[17:29] and then a brother spoke in tongues and
[17:31] i lost control of myself
[17:37] i received from the lord
[17:44] established
[17:46] and i just asked forgiveness from the
[17:47] lord the things that were bothering me
[17:49] and my in the past
[17:52] [Music]
[17:55] and the brother who was preached on
[17:57] sunday el dijo
[18:12] and the lord told me
[18:15] the song that you sang on friday
[18:18] that's for you
[18:22] not to see everyone else but to live
[18:26] and
[18:30] [Music]
[18:36] and i feel led to speak to my sister
[18:38] anna what's next to me
[18:40] e cuando
[18:52] i went to the altar once again i asked
[18:54] forgiveness of the lord once again
[19:03] i want to thank the lord for answering
[19:04] all of my questions
[19:07] can you return the joy of my salvation
[19:22] [Music]
[19:24] and sometimes we see the people and that
[19:26] makes us get out of the path
[19:32] and once we came back or my sister anna
[19:35] sent me a message
[19:40] and she told me the same exact thing she
[19:42] said that song that you sang was for you
[19:47] i want to thank the lord
[20:04] god bless you
[20:05] [Applause]
[20:32] and coming to camp i was asking god that
[20:34] if he could heal me
[20:39] and i had that i had that on my mind the
[20:41] whole camp
[20:45] and so
[20:46] um on saturday
[20:48] in el salvador
[20:50] i had started to feel like anxious and
[20:54] depressed and i was very i was being
[20:57] tormented in my mind
[21:08] and so i went to my cabin to to take a
[21:10] nap because i was like oh i'm just tired
[21:13] of
[21:17] so i
[21:18] i went in there and i was like i can't
[21:20] sleep though i'm not tired
[21:26] and i was like let me try to listen to
[21:28] some music just to calm down
[21:34] but
[21:35] even like behind the music i could still
[21:38] feel being tormented
[21:43] so i said i'm going to listen to a tape
[21:47] and i had um
[21:49] because it was like no internet i had a
[21:51] list of tapes downloaded
[22:00] israel and the church number three
[22:02] israel
[22:05] the indictment
[22:08] hebrews chapter 3.
[22:11] and then the one that i ended up
[22:12] choosing was a court trial
[22:18] so i listened i started listening to the
[22:20] tape but
[22:22] quickly after i was called to
[22:25] practice with the youth
[22:30] and while i was practicing i
[22:32] did not want to practice
[22:37] i felt like i was just fighting with
[22:39] myself and i
[22:41] i felt so like
[22:43] i just didn't want to hear the music i
[22:45] just wanted to be alone
[22:52] and i want to thank sister brianna and
[22:54] hannah for
[22:55] keeping me going and giving me words of
[22:58] encouragement
[23:03] and
[23:04] so after we finished practicing the song
[23:07] i went back to my cabin
[23:12] and i thought i'm going to finish the
[23:15] tape
[23:17] and i started listening to the tape and
[23:19] i was kind of asleep and kind of awake
[23:26] but
[23:26] i heard brother branham say something
[23:28] about healing
[23:32] and he prayed for some young kids
[23:38] and it just made me cry
[23:41] and in the cabin i couldn't stop crying
[23:42] and i didn't understand why
[23:48] but
[23:49] after i knew that it was god telling me
[23:51] that i was going to be healed
[23:57] and then
[23:59] we went to service
[24:02] and
[24:04] hearing um at the all at the when they
[24:07] were praying for me
[24:10] i felt like i was delivered from all the
[24:12] anxiousness and
[24:14] and all like that i had felt being
[24:16] tormented
[24:21] and i felt this
[24:22] just like blanket of like
[24:24] um
[24:25] like calmness
[24:29] and
[24:31] i i had gone to camp and i
[24:33] i we came back and i had still not
[24:37] i didn't really see what i came for but
[24:39] i got what i needed
[24:46] gave me what i needed and words of
[24:47] encouragement to
[24:48] to keep on going and go through the
[24:50] trials
[24:56] and
[24:57] i forget which brother
[25:00] but the brother was talking about
[25:02] how you can be
[25:04] um
[25:06] like seeing god
[25:10] from a distance
[25:12] but you're
[25:19] because i felt like i was going to
[25:20] church and i was i would go to church
[25:22] every day and i would like follow and
[25:24] like wear skirts and everything but i
[25:26] wasn't really getting to know jesus
[25:34] and that was something that really
[25:36] helped me to to keep pushing forward
[25:41] and so
[25:44] after after camp well today i was
[25:46] writing the testimony
[25:50] and i had just finished writing it
[25:54] and then i found out that
[25:56] that my health problems were healed
[26:03] i just want to thank god for that
[26:14] and thank you for um
[26:17] everyone who had
[26:19] been praying for me
[26:22] for me
[26:36] i want to thank the lord for allowing
[26:39] sister connie to come
[26:41] because i felt like she was such a
[26:42] blessing
[26:48] i felt like she was something someone
[26:50] that i needed to talk to
[26:55] she gave me a lot of
[26:57] words of wisdom
[27:01] and
[27:02] thank you
[27:05] [Applause]
[27:35] to speak about a testimony that
[27:38] happened to me while i was at camp
[27:40] testimonial
[27:43] i have
[27:46] i have a verse and a message that really
[27:49] spoke to me
[27:54] in isaiah 9 2.
[27:57] it says
[27:59] the people that walked in darkness have
[28:01] seen a great light
[28:06] they that dwell in the land of the
[28:08] shadow of death
[28:12] upon them half the light that shined
[28:18] and in the message
[28:21] jubilee year paragraph 61
[28:27] brother branham says you can
[28:29] you can't do it yourself
[28:35] but i know someone who can
[28:39] break it for you
[28:42] the lord jesus christ
[28:45] has come to make you free
[28:48] so going to camp thursday afternoon
[28:52] to be honest i wasn't in the right
[28:53] mindset
[28:59] i also wasn't in expectation as i should
[29:01] have been
[29:05] i was tired and stressed from school
[29:10] and also not really feeling like myself
[29:16] i honestly already wanted to go home
[29:21] i was anxious to meet new people
[29:26] and even anxious on what god was going
[29:27] to say to me through the preachings
[29:33] however saturday night that all changed
[29:35] for me
[29:39] i'm sure anyone who is present saturday
[29:41] night
[29:45] can also agree on how strong the spirit
[29:48] was that evening
[29:52] even before
[30:03] instead of feeling
[30:05] relaxed i was anxious and
[30:12] after the preaching was over the spirit
[30:14] began to move throughout the tent
[30:20] i could feel my brothers and sisters
[30:22] receiving something special from the
[30:23] lord
[30:27] and i felt strong emotions
[30:31] but i tend to keep them inside
[31:02] and touched
[31:16] until i couldn't hold it in and my tears
[31:17] poured down my face
[31:22] i put my face into my hands and i
[31:24] started weeping uncontrollably
[31:30] all the emotions i kept in
[31:33] every bit of anger jealousy and fear
[31:36] came flooding out
[31:42] and that's when um my sister daniella
[31:46] spoke some words to me that i feel were
[31:47] straight from the lord
[31:49] for me
[31:54] and once all those negative emotions
[31:56] left me
[31:58] negative
[32:00] i felt an overwhelming sense of love and
[32:02] forgiveness
[32:05] something i haven't truly experienced in
[32:07] my life
[32:10] i felt an unconditional love
[32:50] to know that even if you put up walls
[32:52] god will break through and come and find
[32:54] you
[32:59] god
[33:01] [Applause]

[38:38] um i just wanted to
[38:40] give a short testimony
[38:44] i know there's a lot to say
[38:47] but i just want to
[38:49] hit the highlights
[38:53] i want to give thanks to the lord
[38:55] for allowing me to go to campus
[39:00] [Music]
[39:02] there was so many
[39:05] blessings there
[39:09] so many things that helped me and
[39:11] encouraged me
[39:12] just
[39:14] through the services and um the
[39:17] fellowship and
[39:18] um just being out in nature
[39:26] but the thing that really um stuck out
[39:29] to me
[39:31] was on saturday night
[39:36] i went through the prayer line
[39:40] and i went with uh with faith in my
[39:43] heart
[39:46] and um i
[39:48] really couldn't
[39:50] i was just praying i couldn't no words
[39:54] would come out of my mouth
[39:59] and as i was walking through i just felt
[40:02] so much love from the brothers
[40:07] i felt so
[40:09] encouraged and just
[40:11] lifted up
[40:16] i felt like i entered their dragging on
[40:19] the ground
[40:22] in
[40:24] and they were lifting me up and giving
[40:26] me encouragement
[40:29] and there was a couple brothers
[40:33] ministers
[40:34] that
[40:36] began to tell me everything that i had
[40:39] been asking the lord
[40:44] and uh they told me things that i only
[40:48] told god
[40:53] and
[40:54] they just began to
[40:57] tell me and prophesy to me
[41:03] that the lord was going to help me and
[41:05] he
[41:06] he knew all about what i was going
[41:08] through
[41:12] and they told me all the details
[41:16] of the things that i was asking the lord
[41:30] i know the lord hears our prayers
[41:44] they pray for you and they speak life
[41:46] over you

[41:52] have the victory
[41:56] that all will be well
[41:59] and
[42:00] there's just nothing like that
[42:03] that
[42:04] message from the lord
[42:08] so i just feel really grateful to god
[42:10] and it gave me the strength to continue
[42:12] on
[42:16] and
[42:19] i think the words that stuck out to me
[42:22] from
[42:23] the minister that was discerning me
[42:30] he told me that my sorrow would be
[42:32] turned to joy
[42:37] and i really thank the lord for that
[42:41] god bless you

[1:05:58] you in the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:06:04] i'm just here to give a short testimony
[1:06:07] testimonial of my experience
[1:06:13] how i experienced camp como
[1:06:16] experience
[1:06:17] and the things leading up to it
[1:06:22] um so
[1:06:24] i'm starting off
[1:06:26] i could i could just say i'm blessed to
[1:06:28] be around each and every one of you
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:43] that alone is encouraging
[1:06:47] you know you could if somebody from the
[1:06:49] world were to go by and see us
[1:06:53] they might think we're a little crazy
[1:06:56] why are these people just you know
[1:06:58] they're so happy and so motivated
[1:07:03] but being on the inside you know
[1:07:06] being on the inside and and
[1:07:08] fellowshipping with you guys
[1:07:12] it's beautiful
[1:07:14] it's something like the song says you
[1:07:16] know there's no words words can't
[1:07:18] explain it
[1:07:22] you know
[1:07:23] starting off uh
[1:07:25] you know i got there a day early
[1:07:42] i really enjoyed brother anthony ham
[1:07:45] when he spoke
[1:07:50] i believe i had met him
[1:07:52] a few weeks back and i went to new
[1:07:53] mexico
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:16] so i never expected him to bring the
[1:08:18] message that he brought
[1:08:28] you know i i went to camp um
[1:08:32] kind of hurt i was a little wounded
[1:08:39] i think a lot of us kind of felt like
[1:08:40] that going there
[1:08:46] i felt like a soldier that was uh
[1:08:49] doing everything he could
[1:09:00] when i got there i when i heard brother
[1:09:02] anthony speaking it was very encouraging
[1:09:04] me
[1:09:05] kind of opened my eyes up
[1:09:13] he read galatians uh
[1:09:16] 524 hello
[1:09:21] it says i believe it says
[1:09:24] paraphrasing here
[1:09:26] it says uh those that are christ
[1:09:30] have crucified the flesh
[1:09:37] and i believe that was very
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:40] direct to me
[1:09:44] i felt like i had been attacked and been
[1:09:50] being challenged by the devil
[1:09:55] being a christian
[1:09:56] cristiano
[1:09:58] we are looked at differently
[1:10:08] you know this world is so
[1:10:10] um there's no hope for the world
[1:10:14] although although jesus christ god gave
[1:10:16] his son jesus christ
[1:10:20] we live in darkness
[1:10:24] you know our children i i don't consider
[1:10:26] myself a young person
[1:10:44] i can imagine our children the children
[1:10:48] you know it's very
[1:10:50] um
[1:10:51] it's a dangerous world that we're in it
[1:10:55] you know it's way later than what we
[1:10:56] think
[1:11:10] there's nothing else that's going to
[1:11:11] help me
[1:11:13] unless i stand on god's word
[1:11:17] and even then even though we're on god's
[1:11:19] word
[1:11:21] we're still going to be getting attacked
[1:11:24] on the daily
[1:11:39] you know i asked for your guys prayers
[1:11:44] i really
[1:11:47] i really want to serve the lord with my
[1:11:49] heart
[1:11:52] and i feel like i feel like my mind
[1:11:54] tells me it's impossible
[1:11:58] what can i do
[1:12:00] but
[1:12:01] you know there's nothing else that's
[1:12:02] going to help me
[1:12:05] nobody can help me
[1:12:19] you know i if i can go back to my my
[1:12:22] little timeline i was given
[1:12:27] you know brother anthony um
[1:12:30] kind of remind me of my dad how how he
[1:12:32] spoke emmanuel anthony me
[1:12:34] come
[1:12:43] and you know and when the prayer line
[1:12:45] came the next the following day
[1:12:55] and then also the on sunday
[1:12:58] domingo
[1:13:00] we have to take we have to take what's
[1:13:02] ours you know we have to possess it
[1:13:08] you know i believe that um
[1:13:12] no one's gonna no one's gonna fight for
[1:13:14] us
[1:13:16] not
[1:13:25] and you know when i made that choice
[1:13:30] i didn't expect to fall down so many
[1:13:33] times
[1:13:36] but
[1:13:37] all i can do is get back up
[1:13:41] stand at god's word
[1:13:43] keep moving forward
[1:13:46] you know
[1:13:47] if i stick to god's word
[1:13:50] all of my problems
[1:13:52] start falling away
[1:13:55] i know i have journeyed i've
[1:13:58] walked with the lord i began my past
[1:14:03] but it's so easy to just go to one side
[1:14:05] or the other but
[1:14:08] so we got to get back up
[1:14:11] and continue forward
[1:14:15] you know i can't emphasize or i can't
[1:14:17] express
[1:14:18] that
[1:14:21] i feel like
[1:14:22] i want to i want to grab somebody and
[1:14:24] shake them
[1:14:39] and
[1:14:40] you know stand on god's word there's
[1:14:41] nothing else that's going to help us
[1:14:48] i'm not very good at speaking
[1:14:51] but
[1:14:52] if i can express myself
[1:14:57] and i appreciate everybody's help
[1:15:01] all the talent and
[1:15:03] everyone that went to the camp
[1:15:07] i think that you guys are all special
[1:15:09] people okay
[1:15:12] and i'm blessed to be around you guys
[1:15:15] um
[1:15:17] you know and like i said just keep me in
[1:15:19] your prayers
[1:15:22] let's let's make the circle a little bit
[1:15:24] tighter not smaller but tighter i
[1:15:28] question let's not let the enemy uh take
[1:15:31] us down or come into our our circle
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:36] now i think that we are all on the same
[1:15:40] idea that we're
[1:15:41] fighting for
[1:15:47] and we all got a little fire that we
[1:15:48] received over there
[1:16:04] let's uh
[1:16:05] let's do what our
[1:16:07] well if we are hesitant to do something
[1:16:17] let's not think about it let's just do
[1:16:18] it okay
[1:16:20] in god's name right
[1:16:24] i feel like a lot of us that's what we
[1:16:26] were doing at camp we were saying you
[1:16:27] know what it's camp and it's a special
[1:16:28] moment let's just
[1:16:30] let's do what we can to help
[1:16:36] i feel like we could bring that idea
[1:16:37] home and just keep helping each other
[1:16:39] out
[1:16:44] so um
[1:16:45] i love you guys thank you for sharing
[1:16:47] the ear

[1:17:09] [Music]
[1:17:36] yes
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:45] is
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:18:00] is
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:27] is
[1:18:29] [Music]
[1:18:52] m
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:58] me
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:23] me
[1:19:40] i'd like to start with the scripture
[1:19:42] john 16 20 to 23.
[1:19:48] verily very i say unto you
[1:19:52] that ye shall weep and laminate but the
[1:19:54] world shall rejoice and ye shall be
[1:19:56] sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[1:19:58] turned into joy
[1:20:01] a woman when she is in travail has
[1:20:04] sorrow because her hour has come but as
[1:20:06] soon as she is delivered of the child
[1:20:08] she remembereth no more the anguish for
[1:20:10] joy that a man is born into the world
[1:20:13] and ye
[1:20:14] now therefore have sorrow but i will see
[1:20:16] you again and your heart shall rejoice
[1:20:19] and your joy no man taketh from you and
[1:20:22] in the day ye shall ask me nothing
[1:20:24] verily verily i say unto you whatsoever
[1:20:26] ye shall ask the father in my name he
[1:20:29] will give it to you
[1:20:34] um i think it's amazing that i picked
[1:20:36] this scripture
[1:20:40] and i just heard sister sharon say that
[1:20:44] her sour
[1:20:46] her sorrow shall be turned into joy
[1:20:54] they asked me to share a small part of
[1:20:55] my testimony
[1:20:59] over what happened at this past jericho
[1:21:01] camp
[1:21:05] and the devil started finding me as soon
[1:21:07] as he heard i was going to testify
[1:21:13] yesterday my car's engine overheated and
[1:21:15] i started feeling a little sick
[1:21:24] but don't worry it's not
[1:21:26] covered you know i wish i could sing or
[1:21:29] play an instrument to glorify god
[1:21:35] but i can't not very good
[1:21:40] but you know what
[1:21:54] so
[1:22:08] and i would say yes i'm coming with
[1:22:09] expectations
[1:22:13] i had some things i was struggling with
[1:22:17] and i knew at camp i would receive
[1:22:19] something from the lord
[1:22:24] during camp i was grateful to meet new
[1:22:25] people in fellowship
[1:22:31] during fridays in saturday's service
[1:22:36] when brothers anthony ham and judah mata
[1:22:38] were preaching
[1:22:42] during both preachings i was just crying
[1:22:44] because everything they said touched me
[1:22:50] okay
[1:22:52] but during saturday's service i received
[1:22:54] a lot of confirmation and answers
[1:23:01] to things i was struggling with
[1:23:13] my heart started beating super fast
[1:23:18] and i just felt a call to go through the
[1:23:19] line
[1:23:22] and as i was walking through it
[1:23:26] hearing what the brothers were saying
[1:23:29] made me cry even more
[1:23:32] i was already crying the whole service
[1:23:36] but as i continue to walk through the
[1:23:38] line
[1:23:40] towards the middle of it is when brother
[1:23:42] albert delgado ain't el medio alberto
[1:23:45] delgado said something to me and i just
[1:23:47] started crying really hard
[1:23:52] he pulled me aside and started
[1:23:53] discerning me
[1:23:56] one of the things he told me was just to
[1:23:58] open my heart fully to the lord
[1:24:13] and then he prayed for me
[1:24:16] towards the end of the prayer he put his
[1:24:18] hands on my forehead
[1:24:22] and he casted some things out i was
[1:24:24] struggling
[1:24:28] that's when i felt so light and
[1:24:29] liberated
[1:24:32] i fell back
[1:24:35] i would like to thank the sister who
[1:24:37] caught me and helped me back up
[1:24:43] after i was done praying on the floor
[1:24:45] that's when i continued to walk
[1:24:51] and a couple steps after falling my
[1:24:53] hands and arms started to shake really
[1:24:54] hard
[1:24:56] miss manos
[1:25:37] and just covered my face with my hands
[1:25:38] and kind of leaned over
[1:25:42] and i just kept crying and i was praying
[1:25:44] thanking the lord
[1:25:48] my face in my head felt super hot like
[1:25:50] fire meet me
[1:25:54] after i calmed down i felt tired and
[1:25:56] drained like i couldn't get up
[1:26:01] so i just stayed there worshiping god
[1:26:03] listening to the music
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:08] you know i come from the world and
[1:26:09] there's no better feeling than the
[1:26:11] presence of god
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:18] never in my life i'd imagine i'd be here
[1:26:19] but by god's grace and mercy i'm here
[1:26:26] you know it's like eating at mcdonald's
[1:26:28] your whole life
[1:26:33] and then getting to eat at longhorn
[1:26:34] steakhouse
[1:26:37] longhorn steakhouse why would i ever
[1:26:39] want to go back to mcdonald's
[1:26:44] this monday was my one year mark of
[1:26:46] being baptized is
[1:26:52] i was born 19 years ago but really only
[1:26:54] been living for one year
[1:27:01] and i thank god for this beautiful year
[1:27:03] for all his mercy revelations and
[1:27:05] experiences he has given me grace
[1:27:11] as my favorite song says
[1:27:15] just remember when you're standing in
[1:27:17] the valley of decisions
[1:27:21] and the adversary says
[1:27:25] just hold on
[1:27:28] our lord will show up
[1:27:45] in phoenix january 21st 1962
[1:27:48] in phoenix
[1:27:52] what you need is the holy ghost
[1:27:57] to deflate you a little bit
[1:28:02] that's right let you know that
[1:28:04] the real true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:11] will make a tuxedo suit put his arms
[1:28:13] around a pair of overalls
[1:28:21] and say brother right
[1:28:24] real old time salvation
[1:28:46] [Music]

[1:28:50] got a wrinkle in here

[1:40:04] saturday evening happened after the
[1:40:05] preaching
[1:40:33] asking for the healing for his leg
[1:40:40] because i don't want him to go through
[1:40:41] the same thing we passed several years
[1:40:43] ago
[1:41:00] i thought maybe he went to go sit down
[1:41:02] since his leg hurts
[1:41:09] all the people go through the line
[1:41:14] i saw him walk in the line
[1:41:45] what those legs he goes and provides for
[1:41:47] his family
[1:41:51] we ask for his complete healing
[1:41:58] either i feel the pool to go to the line
[1:42:07] and i was going to line somebody told me
[1:42:09] just gave everything

[1:43:47] and i saw him there with his leg really
[1:43:50] bad
