division of christ brings the bride neither pray i for these alone but for them which also which shall believe on me through their word see what verses john 17 20. that they may be one as thou father art and me and i and thee they also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou has gave us me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one la

you may touch each and every expecting heart that is here thirsting for your word thirsting father you're the one that gives us life and you're the one that takes it away so lord we put our hands we put our lives into your hands father this morning we give it all unto thee in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen amen yemen amen you may be seated god bless each and every one of you as i said my title is the division of christ brings the bride commodity god brings fellowship different than what we think fellowship should be companies it's by one spirit especially we are all united together brother and i wonder about then if we go back to the beginning you want to know a problem today or you want to know something today ok something that is happening today in this day and age you want to see something that has happened in the new testament you can always find it in the beginning everything that is happening now has happened in the beginning brother branham called that uh genesis a seed chapter in the monobram yama libra de genesis because it's the beginning of all things it's the beginning of true fellowship and in genesis it's the beginning of false of fellowships it's the beginning of god's outpouring of his spirit and it's the beginning of satan's reign on the earth said there's two books in the bible that satan hates this element one is revelations because it shows his end pokemon and if we look in the beginning we can have a clear view of what's happening now so brother branham says all things began in genesis and in genesis we find out that god created man for his fellowship it kind of sounds like i'm beating a dead horse here perez he created the angels to worship him el creole los angeles but he created a man a special a position to be sons and daughters of god to have a special fellowship with him that an angel can never have like that no other being no other beast on the earth can ever have this special gift a man and a woman it's to be one in one with god and how does god achieve this fellowship we know brother branham says god doesn't have grandchildren that means we just don't come to church because it's become a personal revelation to each and every person personally it's not because my daddy went to church it's not because my family lied we've done this for so many ages but it's a personal relationship with god so god desires fellowship not through a system no pornerio de un systema not through a church and whenever god achieves that fellowship in you and i e lo grace companies then there's perfect fellowship with you and i entonces existed when i talked to my brother when i talked to my sister when i talked to somebody i'm talking to god that's why whenever we know that we have the holy spirit and there's people out there dying dying for the word of the lord he could have the revelation that jesus christ is represented in that manner just like that child whenever he was scared of the thunderings and his mama said it's just we're christians we know you know that god is with you all the time the kid's like yes yes i know that mama el nino di jose but sometimes i just want god with skin on it and that's the main thing when i'm fellowshipping with god completely to himself it's god all in all because he's in me and he's in you and he's in all ye and that is perfect fellowship yes el when we know that a brother or sister filled with the holy ghost they have the eternal waters the everlasting waters in them dwelling in them the eternal dwelling in them so that's how god achieves fellowship brother branham says in the in oneness let me try to cry out to you don't listen to the lie of the devil anymore to separate is it is breaking your fellowship with god god's oneness by the holy spirit then if you stay if you say you've got the holy spirit and it's not in agree with the word then you're not in oneness with god and nothing could penetrate those immovable walls the power the spirit was there creating the fellowship with one another and god's oneness is by the holy spirit brother branham said continues in oneness he says adam was a part of eve or was eve was a part of adam she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones that's now he's going to show us the correct union sometimes we have to step away and have a different perspective and say why is there so much fussing and fighting why is the husband yelling at the wife why is the wife yelling at the husband why are the kids doing this and the kid's doing that there there has to be a unity there you stay with the word of god you will never falter that word of god heavens and earth will pass away before the word passes away is and you will be in perfect unity with the family brother branham says you'll have your little altar there this is the wife will be the the minister there lies everyone will have their place and it's the same way amen amen amen uh we're going to be talking a little bit about the tower because in genesis all things begin we see the seed of religion start with adam and eve when adam and eve covered themselves and they created themselves a religion brother branham says but then we see in the tower of babel where religion started to grow religion where where organization began there don de aicomensola the tower of babel that's when they begin to build walls around themselves and they begin to denominate each other and say uh you can't come into this area it was a denomination it was an organization it was uh idolatry it was witchcraft it was all evils under heaven was in that place tower of babel but what were they trying to do trying to build this tower brother branham says in the future home of the heavenly bride room and the earthly bride this is speaking on enoch here now this being this way would answer exactly enoch's sign egypt and in this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber yes watch the seventh step if you ever uh study the dimensions of the pyramid what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king that is standing there you'll see the day you're living in in the pyramid position then he says in the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid sin from our lives he says the second bible was written was written by enoch and put it in the pyramids so he created this seven pyramid and on the the top of that pyramid it was a temple it was the king's chamber brother branham said this and that's where they would meet the king and the bible and brother branham says that was the third bible this is that the third bible was written in those pyramids i don't know about you but that is tremendous that is tremendous that the third bible was written on a pyramid and that was the word of god he built a pyramid and that was the word of god and that was the word of god and the second one was the pyramid this is the word of god today the written word of god this is and at that time that was the word of god and the bible says that the whole earth was with one language and one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a place in the land of china and they do out there and in verse 3 it says they said to one another go let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime for mortar electric and they said go let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon they were building a tower enoch built this great pyramid the word of god instagram and that god took him and then here comes these these people these people that were full of sins these people that had the serpent seen in them but this tower was a false word because the word of god was in enoch's pyramid we see that many days many times now people try to build themselves under denominations they pick a word of the bible and they build a whole denomination around it denominationally they were trying to pervert god's original plans they knew that when they got kicked out of eden they didn't get kicked out like saying and the tree of eternal life dwelt in that place and they knew if they could get to that place they could have all their eternal glory they could have everything they needed but it was false brother branham says that in enoch's pyramid this is that that you couldn't even put a razor in between those stones and brother branham says that was the type of us is one but you look in the bible you see these people building uh having brick for stones they didn't really they didn't use real stone no sorrow these people needed mortar to build their tower their pyramid amen amen brother branham says in the message oneness now the tower of babel the union of cain's children with seth's children brought judgment it always brings god's judgment to the world see the descendants of the very act that broke their unity then you see them with says children trying to create a unity for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath with light with darkness and and what happens it disturbs everyone adam ran away from the presents so whenever i come and i fellowship with my wife i have fellowship with my children cristianos there becomes turbulence everywhere occasionally just whenever joshua and and um the the armies went to jericho josue los angeles but they lost the battle even though god gave them the words saying they would never lose a battle the lives become effective always whenever unbelief and belief is yoked together amen amen but brother branham says that there's always three kinds of believers amen amen they said let us make brick you say they said let us build a city they said let us make a name see you christianity's story is completely different de la cristina when there was a break in the spiritual and the fellowship between god and adam was gone who was it looking for who was it adam saying lord lord it was god looking for man that's the the story of christianity today i was in the world i was no good [Applause] we run away every single time but the story of religion historia de la region religion is a different story it's man uniting trying to reach heaven and all of its glory gloria i don't believe they are trying to reach heaven because they love the lord they weren't trying they what did what did a verse say uh verse four say que risel cuatro it said let us build a city and a tower. whose top may reach unto heaven let us make a name say agamos so if they would have built a tower to reach up to heaven you'd think they would say biensen de que uzidion let us build a tower to heaven so that we can worship the lord so we can mend back the unity no it was all self-glorification gloria it was all self-gratification let us go up to heaven so that i can make a name for myself because then anybody would have been able to receive eternal life and whenever they were separated their dominion left eternal life was gone the riches and the glory was all gone gloria when the spirit of the lord left them and today there's people uniting under towers of babel trying to achieve eternal glory gloria we see that in in the science trying to to um build stuff so that they can live forever killing each other it's all a money-making scheme everywhere trying to receive eternal glory gloria amen amen they're trying to receive something from god trying to achieve eternal life is a picture of the bottom of the earth trying to reach up to heaven that's not the way god works christianity is god reaching down to man that's always been the plan of god it's all united to reach to him but it brought division and confusion but yet there's still power in unity the lord said in in verse six and the lord said behold the people is one. they all have one language and this they begin to do now nothing will be restrained from them which they imagine to do there's power in unity there's power in unity amen amen god says there's nothing that will restrain them there's nothing that will hold them back from what they want to imagine if there's a family united together imagine if there's a church united together in one mind in one what is there to hold us back what is there to to to take away your healing there is nothing impossible when we're united under the word under the spirit of the lord they were under a fall in false unity and there was nothing that would restrain them from what they wanted to do and it said what they have imagined to do what was in their imagination he says and god saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually or imagination that's why we have the blood of jesus christ you know no matter what there's always going to be bad thoughts coming in and out no importa but you have the power prosthetic to allow it to dwell in you or push that thought away you have that decision you have that decision to allow that thought to grow brother branham says the mind is a womb you allow those seeds those words of the devil to grow us and it'll be produced in the life you live if you allow those thoughts don't worry and what did these people do it says their imagination was evil continually simply they fought evil every day they used pelian they thought of evil things every day and whenever you allow that thought to grow in that womb of your mind you produce it in your actions you produce it in the way you talk you produce it in your tongue amen amen so god went down he said let us go down and confound their language brother branham now i'm going to turn the corner he said did you ever think that the tower of babylon compared with jacob's ladder has anybody read the story of jacob's ladder he continues and says how that they were trying to build stair steps around the tower that would reach up to heaven only trying to pervert jacob's ladder which reached from heavens to earth angels descending and ascending perverting it los angeles [Music] it has to be heaven coming down to earth if you'd like to turn with me to genesis 28. now this is the story of jacob the bible says genesis 28 11 17. and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place and he dreamed behold a ladder set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven behold angels of god ascending and descending on it is and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land where thou liest to thee i will give it to you and to thy seed yeah and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed god was telling jacob something the one that threw you jacob there will be one that will bless all the nations through together all just to be won but it takes one spirit to unify the whole world together by one spirit we are all baptized into one body he wasn't just to bless one nation but to bless all and he continues on 15 he says and behold i am with thee and with and will keep thee in all places where thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done which i have spoken to the of and jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not it is we we're talking about it this last time babel we have the many people say there's many ways other than jesus camino in verse 17 it says and he was afraid and he said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god this is the gate of heaven no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven what was that door jesus says i am that door we try unto hymn verily verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man los angeles he was the ladder he was that gate he was the way to the tree of life brother branham says [Music] he left the glories of heaven the holy glory he left the highest name that could ever be called and he when he was on earth man give him the lowest name they could give him born in a major wrapped in rags off of the yolk of an ox de las paladio foreign he was made fun of sephora he was rejected and went to the lowest pit stooped down to the vile list of prostitutes is is die it's the day our fellowship is broken the day you disbelieve is the day you separate from my presence as soon as their fellowship was broken their fellowship between each other was broken anything without god is a broken fellowship it all comes back to jesus christ if you want healing if you want salvation if you want true fellowship it comes through jesus christ he came to restore all things if you need something from the lord go back to that dale calvary and you'll see your answer right there if you got a problem a habit go back to calvary go back to the slain word jesus died jesus hey man can i continue just for a little bit more he had no fellowship with his disciples he had no true fellowship you know true unity with his disciples the day you eat thereof is the day you die that is a punishment we all have to complete yes but then here comes this little man he paved the way for each and every one of us because we cannot have true fellowship if we're separated dead spiritually from god spiritually brother branham says that god separated himself from jesus christ how is that possible that god separated from himself jesus was crying and he was sweating droplets of blood jesus it wasn't because he was afraid of the cross it wasn't because he was going to die as a human no especially he was the resurrection in the life he's not afraid of death he walked up to lazarus and said lazarus come forth he wasn't afraid of physical death he was sorrowful because he had to separate from his own spirit he had to separate eternally from god the day you eat there is the day you die brother branham says in the rising of the sun this el monobram elements when god looked upon the body the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man he didn't if he had went up there as god he'd never die that kind of death can't kill god but he had he didn't have to do it god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body there are one the same the same words the same word spoke of the groom spreaks of the bride whenever god separated from jesus christ he saw the bride of jesus christ in him he created man and female he created he them but and adam eve was in adam and when but yet the true fellowship wasn't there yet and that's why god said it is not good that man be alone even though his bride was in him already but he said it's not good for men to be alone and out of her flesh that's when she fell but in her spirit she was perfect for perfect and whenever god saw the bride in jesus christ wherever jesus christ went ahead my god my god why hast thou forsaken me he saw him full and god says i'm going to have to eternally separate from you eternally that he would separate it from himself because you and i were in his mind jesus but brother branham says that adam slept this abraham slept isaac slept abram during but jesus had to die death is separation but the bible says in john 12 24. verily i very very very i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone he had to die but if it died it bringeth forth much fruit what was god's commission to adam he said multiply multiplication i said multiply he said out of your seat all of the nations will be blessed by one man's offense all dies but one man's righteousness all lives but he grabbed the keys of death in hell tomorrow and he opened the way for us amen amen god man realized he was a wanderer even the bible says that he was a wanderer that he was searching for a city whose builder and maker was gone was actually after the confusion of babel when they were trying to find a city whose builder and maker was gone amen amen amen let us stand to our feet i wish i could finish but we'll just uh finish another time what we need we realize that our families are helpless without you we realize that these churches are helpless without you father father we're all helpless without your holy spirit but father you made a way father you opened the gate of heaven so that we can receive eternal life lord
