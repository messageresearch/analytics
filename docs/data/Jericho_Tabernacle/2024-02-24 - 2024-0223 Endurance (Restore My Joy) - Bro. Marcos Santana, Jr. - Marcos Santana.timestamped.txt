[29:55] again uh I know when Wednesday I
[30:00] spoke and I explained a little of how I
[30:02] was on a bit of a
[30:05] vacation just being
[30:08] humorous and to be humorous
[30:12] again when you get off of
[30:16] vacation it's time to
[30:19] worken so we're we're happy to be here
[30:21] this
[30:23] evening uh God bless you all each and
[30:26] every one of you
[30:29] uh we want to thank the Lord for this
[30:32] opportunity and also our pastor for the
[30:34] opportunity to speak to all this
[30:39] evening you may be seated I just want to
[30:41] speak for a few
[30:45] moments and I don't know if this will
[30:47] obstruct the message tonight or
[30:52] not but uh I I witnessed a funeral this
[30:56] morning
[31:00] of our precious brother
[31:04] Ruben I believe the majority of us if
[31:07] not all of us know
[31:10] him and and you know did it did
[31:12] something in
[31:15] me uh when when you when you can
[31:18] identify with
[31:21] somebody when you've been through
[31:23] similar struggles with
[31:26] somebody
[31:29] and and and you just see how people's
[31:31] lives turn
[31:36] out this is a youth
[31:39] service and I just got to thinking as I
[31:41] was watching the
[31:45] funeral how important each and every one
[31:47] of us
[31:49] are and the things that the Lord lets us
[31:51] go
[31:53] through you know sometimes you go
[31:56] through things
[31:59] and on one end of the
[32:01] line when you see someone else going
[32:03] through what you went
[32:06] through you tend to feel for
[32:11] them you want to pray for
[32:14] them your heart goes out to the
[32:19] person and then on the other
[32:21] end the person that's going through
[32:25] it you know there's examples throughout
[32:28] the
[32:29] church people that have had marital
[32:34] problems people that have had drug
[32:36] addiction
[32:39] problems all kinds of
[32:41] problems and then you say Lord I've seen
[32:44] you did something in
[32:47] her I've seen you did something in that
[32:51] brother Lord can you do something in
[32:55] me so are our testimonies are so
[32:58] valuable in the eyes of the
[33:02] Lord and it was it just touched my heart
[33:05] this
[33:08] morning and it's also good to hear from
[33:11] my brother
[33:14] Mendoza uh that his father got
[33:17] out I'm sure we were all praying for his
[33:22] father you know we we went to see his
[33:25] father uh after service last
[33:29] week uh brother Jose S Michael and
[33:34] myself uh just a friendly visit of
[33:38] love and we had a good
[33:41] time a lot of
[33:43] laughs and and we had the opportunity to
[33:45] pray for the brother that God would
[33:46] restore his
[33:51] health and something interesting
[33:53] happened while we were at the
[33:55] hospital
[33:58] I remember as we were going
[34:00] in we were in the
[34:04] elevator and we seen a lady that was in
[34:08] there and I think Michael myself and
[34:11] brother josea we're we're pretty social
[34:17] guys we we tried to kind of talk and
[34:19] make conversation with this woman
[34:24] there and and person she seemed kind of
[34:27] rude on the phone ignoring
[34:33] us but something said I don't know maybe
[34:36] she's going through something
[34:41] intense well we went to see our brother
[34:43] the Mendoza
[34:47] family and then as we
[34:49] left we're going down the down the
[34:53] hallway this uh this woman stops US
[34:58] and I said I think that's that woman
[35:00] that was in the
[35:04] elevator and I just said that inside of
[35:08] myself and and she stopped us I believe
[35:10] her words were are you guys
[35:16] Christians we didn't I don't think we
[35:18] were too dressed up to look like
[35:23] Christians but if we're the light of the
[35:25] world
[35:27] There's Something That We're
[35:30] reflecting there's something we should
[35:32] be
[35:34] reflecting that's why even in the way
[35:36] our young sisters and our young Brothers
[35:42] dress though you might want to look like
[35:44] the newest trends and
[35:49] Fashions it's just so important to
[35:51] uphold that Christian uh uh that
[35:54] Christianity about
[35:55] yourself
[36:00] but she asked are you guys
[36:03] Christians caught me off
[36:06] guard and and said
[36:09] yes and she started asking us for our
[36:11] favorite
[36:14] scripture and as we started answering
[36:16] and having a conversation with
[36:21] her you could tell something was
[36:25] wrong
[36:27] till she opened
[36:30] up and she was
[36:32] there or she finally confessed the
[36:35] reason why she was
[36:38] there she was on her way back home to
[36:42] Utah and she said the last step before
[36:46] boarding the
[36:49] plane her daughter had a I believe it
[36:51] was a
[36:54] seizure and they couldn't take her so
[36:56] they rushed her to the
[37:00] hospital and she showed us the video of
[37:02] this young
[37:04] girl 11-year-old 11year old
[37:10] baby all caged
[37:14] up because now she was mumbling and
[37:22] grumbling launching herself on the
[37:25] walls andc ing up and down like
[37:31] insane this sister she hadn't slept for
[37:34] I think over 24
[37:38] hours you could tell she would just go
[37:40] in and out of her
[37:45] thoughts and I believe it was Brother
[37:49] s that that asked her
[37:52] sister well would you like for us to
[37:54] pray for your daughter
[37:58] and he would ask her I think two or
[37:59] three
[38:01] times to to to to get what is it that
[38:04] she wanted from her
[38:09] heart she
[38:11] agreed and we went ahead and prayed
[38:14] right there at that
[38:16] moment you know one never
[38:20] knows what God has in line for
[38:24] you know it it becomes more of a reality
[38:27] to
[38:29] me how we should always be prepared at
[38:32] every
[38:34] moment I can't imagine veterans like
[38:36] brother Sal and brother brother
[38:41] Tanis always at the
[38:45] disposition to pray for
[38:47] somebody to to speak to
[38:50] somebody to evangelize to
[38:54] somebody it was such a lesson for me
[38:57] me to always be
[38:59] ready you never know what the world is
[39:02] going
[39:04] through you never know how the Satan's
[39:06] tormenting
[39:09] them and this woman she wasn't just any
[39:12] woman she knew her
[39:16] word so that's why she knew there was
[39:18] something in these three
[39:22] men and I'd like to add her to my
[39:25] prayers this evening
[39:29] that God would restore her
[39:32] daughter and just as we prayed for her
[39:34] that
[39:37] night that with that
[39:39] Miracle she can get closer to
[39:43] God so before we
[39:45] begin if You' please stand and bow your
[39:50] heads as we
[39:55] pray Lord heavely
[39:58] father we thank you Lord for another
[40:03] day Lord I just at this moment want to
[40:06] place our sister
[40:11] saf and her daughter Shila sh just once
[40:16] again Lord ask you that you would do the
[40:18] miracle in that sweet
[40:22] baby that that torturous devil from
[40:28] hell would be cast out of
[40:32] her father I I come before you with
[40:36] joining the faith of all our Saints
[40:43] tonight father if if our brother
[40:45] Ramiro's father
[40:49] healed I know this little Shila could
[40:54] heal so father though we don't don't
[40:56] know
[40:59] them as Christians we love
[41:02] them so we place her in her daughter in
[41:04] your
[41:07] hands that your Holy Ghost can perform
[41:09] the miracle in
[41:13] her and also for tonight
[41:16] Lord I ask you to just help me speak a
[41:19] few words to the youth
[41:23] tonight a few words of encouragement for
[41:26] for them this
[41:28] evening for they are the future
[41:30] generation
[41:33] Lord that will carry this
[41:36] baton carry this
[41:39] word and carry this message
[41:42] Lord for we know this is the realest
[41:45] thing there
[41:48] is the testimonies are endless
[41:52] father and though the world will point
[41:55] and mock
[41:58] though they'll make fun of these
[42:01] youth though they'll talk bad about
[42:03] these
[42:05] youth if your holy ghost
[42:09] power can give them a personal
[42:15] experience an
[42:17] unexplainable
[42:20] experience that that that they just know
[42:22] that they
[42:24] know that it comes from God and God
[42:28] Alone it doesn't matter what demon would
[42:31] come against
[42:33] them what story of Lies would come
[42:36] against
[42:39] them what power an enemy would try to
[42:42] come in their minds and make them
[42:47] disbelieve they'll say get away from me
[42:52] Satan I've had an
[42:54] experience I've seen my
[42:57] Jesus I've met my
[42:59] Lord and though my eyes tell me one
[43:03] thing my body tells me another
[43:06] thing and my mind wants to tell me
[43:08] another
[43:10] thing my heart and my spirit tell me
[43:12] another
[43:15] thing father I just pray for these youth
[43:17] in this
[43:20] evening and we put them in your hands
[43:24] Lord along with everyone else this
[43:28] evening we give you the honor and
[43:31] glory and bless the reading of your word
[43:35] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:37] Christ we
[43:40] pray amen
[43:42] amen forgive me for taking so
[43:46] long if you could turn to Matthew
[43:51] 24 and uh for a title this
[43:55] evening
[43:56] uh
[43:58] endurance and as a subtitle restore my
[44:06] joy Matthew 2413
[44:10] reads but he that shall endure until the
[44:13] end the same shall be
[44:19] saved you may be
[44:21] seated thank you to all the
[44:25] musicians but he that shall endure until
[44:28] the end the same shall be
[44:33] saved what a
[44:35] promise I I looked up the synonyms for
[44:37] the word
[44:41] endure and I found the word to
[44:46] remain to Bear
[44:48] trials and to
[44:52] persevere and and and taking this
[44:54] scripture
[44:57] it it talks to us of a
[45:01] timeline a timeline of
[45:05] life and it gives us a responsibility or
[45:08] a
[45:10] job that we must
[45:12] do and lastly it gives us a reward at
[45:15] the
[45:19] end in that timeline it says make it to
[45:22] the
[45:24] end
[45:27] because your responsibility as a
[45:29] Christian young man and young
[45:35] lady is to endure to the
[45:39] end to to to fight until the
[45:43] end because the reward is eternal
[45:49] salvation anybody ever heard of the
[45:51] following
[45:54] Expressions you know just hold
[45:57] on stay stay
[46:00] strong hang in
[46:02] there keep on
[46:04] fighting you know when would somebody
[46:06] tell you
[46:08] that when you think about it when would
[46:10] somebody tell you just keep on
[46:14] fighting when you're in times of
[46:18] difficulty when you're in times of
[46:21] struggle want to say just hang on in
[46:24] there you're in times of
[46:27] anxiety just stay
[46:30] strong just hold
[46:32] on they're telling you so you can keep
[46:34] on
[46:37] fighting because they know they
[46:40] see that there's a prize at the end of
[46:43] the
[46:44] road there's a reward at the end of the
[46:49] fight you know I think there's a a quote
[46:51] out
[46:53] there that that if there's there's
[46:56] something if anything worth uh whatever
[46:59] you want anything worth fighting for
[47:01] whatever you want anything is worth
[47:02] fighting
[47:06] for I believe the brother said it better
[47:08] if it's worth it it's worth fighting
[47:12] for anything that you that you need you
[47:15] desire there's a battle behind
[47:20] it there's a sacrifice behind
[47:24] it there's a fight to get to that end of
[47:26] the
[47:28] road I don't know what greater thing
[47:30] there
[47:33] is than Eternal
[47:36] Salvation And if we fight for all these
[47:38] other
[47:40] things we struggle and sacrifice for our
[47:45] career if we do all we move mountains so
[47:48] we can get
[47:51] married why would we not struggle to the
[47:54] very end for eternal
[47:59] salvation that's the greatest thing God
[48:01] can give you young
[48:04] people you might have seen your
[48:08] parents go through difficult Financial
[48:13] Times difficult personal
[48:16] times and those are part of the
[48:18] sacrifices they're
[48:22] making because they see the end of the
[48:24] road
[48:26] they're willing to fight to the end for
[48:28] that
[48:31] salvation they're setting an example for
[48:35] us of what it is to be an overcomer in
[48:38] the
[48:41] end now Revelation 3:21
[48:44] says to him that
[48:47] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[48:50] in my
[48:52] throne even as I also overcame
[48:57] you know I I see
[48:59] that I say wow that's that's so
[49:03] awesome I'm not the only one that's
[49:07] overcome but I come from a
[49:11] genealogy it's in my genes in my
[49:18] bloodline of Overcomer after
[49:22] Overcomer that's a Christian trait to be
[49:25] an overcomer
[49:29] to overcome the
[49:31] enemy to overcome all of his darts that
[49:34] he throws at
[49:36] us to know that the Lord is on my
[49:39] side and no matter what weapon is formed
[49:42] against
[49:45] me it will not be
[49:49] successful Jesus was an
[49:51] overcomer Abraham was an
[49:54] overcomer Jacob was an
[49:57] overcomer young person you are an
[50:00] overcomer the blood that's flowing
[50:02] through your
[50:04] veins is the blood of Jesus
[50:08] Christ it's the blood of an
[50:12] overcomer if he didn't lose there in
[50:15] heaven he's not going to lose here on
[50:17] this
[50:19] Earth and if he's living in
[50:22] you you're not going to lose either
[50:26] you're going to be an
[50:28] overcomer but if only we could sit back
[50:31] and overcome without doing
[50:38] anything that's why we said it wouldn't
[50:40] be worth it if it was that
[50:44] way I want to fight for what I
[50:47] earn I want to fight for my seat at the
[50:53] throne I want to feel the satisfaction
[50:55] action of knowing this belongs to
[50:59] me in the message God's provided
[51:04] way for this day brother Brown says they
[51:07] had to fight for every inch of
[51:11] it so we fight for every inch of
[51:16] it it isn't something to be baby and
[51:19] petted around like
[51:22] that young people you're GNA fight
[51:27] so get ready for the
[51:28] battle he says come with the
[51:32] determination come that you're going to
[51:35] stay there until it's
[51:41] over stay there till God answers and he
[51:47] vindicates you know we're not saying you
[51:49] have to come to the
[51:51] Altar and you've got to pray here for 5
[51:54] 8 10 hours
[51:58] straight when you come to the altar with
[52:01] an honest
[52:04] heart and you're praying from the
[52:06] deepest part of your
[52:09] heart you're praying here at the
[52:12] altar you're praying until Faith inside
[52:15] of
[52:18] you is making the answer to what you're
[52:20] asking
[52:23] for make it so real to
[52:26] you that's what faith is it it makes it
[52:29] real to
[52:31] you to where if you open your
[52:34] eyes you can see it and touch it right
[52:37] there in front of
[52:39] you and because your faith is so
[52:44] high so high it it you open your
[52:49] eyes you're not healed at that
[52:52] moment you weren't given what you're
[52:54] asking for at that moment
[52:58] but faith has already told you that it's
[53:01] real that it's already in your
[53:04] hands Faith already seen it down the
[53:07] line in the
[53:09] future Faith already knows that it's
[53:11] there waiting for
[53:14] you that's why it's just as real for you
[53:17] at that moment at the
[53:21] altar when you fight for it there at the
[53:24] altar
[53:28] coming with a
[53:30] determination staying until it's
[53:34] over so that your own faith can
[53:37] vindicate the
[53:40] answer Brown says a man that believes in
[53:45] God can see the presence of
[53:48] God can feel the presence of
[53:51] God sense the presence of
[53:53] God knows he's
[53:56] here he's here to answer everything that
[53:59] he made a promise for in that
[54:03] day then you'll cry till you get
[54:07] it and hold on to
[54:09] it don't leave if you have to stay all
[54:12] day and
[54:14] night he wants you to cry out to it till
[54:17] the promise is
[54:21] Vindicated cry out to him until it's so
[54:27] real until you know that you know that
[54:30] you
[54:32] know that nobody can take that from
[54:36] you when you open your
[54:38] eyes and the devil's saying you
[54:41] see what healing your stomach still
[54:46] hurts he died for me already on the
[54:51] cross your your your your your healing
[54:53] is not there yet
[54:57] your son's not there
[54:59] yet your husband's not there
[55:02] yet he don't got to be here right
[55:05] now my faith already told me he's going
[55:08] to be
[55:09] here get away from me
[55:12] Satan in the message the marriage of the
[55:16] Lamb the same way it is about Divine
[55:21] Healing God's got the power to heal you
[55:26] if you've got the courage to accept
[55:31] it if you young people have the courage
[55:33] to accept
[55:36] it but you'll have to fight for every
[55:39] inch of
[55:42] it God's got Amazing Grace to save
[55:46] you and he will do it but you'll have to
[55:50] fight for every inch of the
[55:54] way brother Brown says I've been behind
[55:56] the pulpit going on 31
[56:01] years and every inch of that has been a
[56:08] fight I'm sure our brother Juanito's
[56:10] been behind the pulpit for more than 31
[56:16] years our brother tiis has been the same
[56:19] for more than 31
[56:22] years and if you want to explain your
[56:24] struggles to one of these
[56:28] Elders they'll feel for
[56:31] you they'll have compassion for
[56:34] you but then turn around and ask them
[56:36] some of the fights they've been
[56:40] in so you can see that a Christian is a
[56:45] soldier and it's a constant fight
[56:47] against the
[56:50] enemy brother Brown says but we must
[56:52] fight if we must
[56:53] reign
[56:56] but we find out that the bride has to
[56:58] make herself
[57:02] ready the bride has to make herself
[57:06] ready we all believe we're part of that
[57:10] bride you know I used to think of the
[57:14] Bride when when when I let my
[57:16] imagination just
[57:19] wander and when they say and she gets
[57:22] herself
[57:23] ready
[57:25] and it would look so pretty picking out
[57:27] a dress in the
[57:32] store The Young Bride having these sweet
[57:35] amazing
[57:40] dreams of the husband and the life
[57:42] they're going to
[57:44] live and like almost like a movie
[57:47] running through the flowers in the
[57:52] valley patiently waiting like it says to
[57:55] wear that dress and marry the
[58:02] bridegroom yes there is a
[58:05] bride we are the
[58:07] bride yes there is a
[58:09] dress yes there is a
[58:12] wedding but now I
[58:15] realize that this
[58:18] bride has got to
[58:20] fight is going through
[58:23] battles shedding blood Blood Sweat and
[58:28] Tears getting dirty fighting every step
[58:31] of the
[58:35] way that is getting yourself
[58:39] ready a mental
[58:41] Warfare the spiritual
[58:44] warfare physical
[58:46] Warfare family
[58:48] Warfare all to get in
[58:51] shape to get in condition
[58:55] for the marriage with our
[58:58] King so we can be ready to wear that
[59:03] dress to walk down that
[59:07] aisle but brandham says in the message
[59:09] stand
[59:12] still if God calls
[59:15] you if God calls you young
[59:18] people he intends for you to have he
[59:21] intends for you to have
[59:23] it
[59:25] if he's called
[59:27] you he intends to give you the Holy
[59:32] Ghost if he's called
[59:34] you he intends to give you the new
[59:38] birth there's no doubt about
[59:41] it otherwise he wouldn't have called
[59:46] you but brother Brown says but you'll
[59:48] have to fight for every inch of the way
[59:50] to get
[59:53] it
[59:56] so we won't be strolling down that
[59:58] Valley of
[1:00:01] roses but we're going to fight battle
[1:00:04] after
[1:00:06] battle trial after
[1:00:09] trial because we're going to earn every
[1:00:11] step of the
[1:00:14] way second Timothy 4:7
[1:00:19] says Paul speaking
[1:00:21] here says I have fought a good fight
[1:00:26] I have finished my
[1:00:29] course I have kept the
[1:00:32] faith henceforth there is laid up for me
[1:00:35] a crown of
[1:00:39] righteousness Apostle Paul says I've
[1:00:41] fought a good
[1:00:46] fight he's saying that those fights
[1:00:48] weren't No Mediocre
[1:00:52] fights these are strong battles that the
[1:00:54] Christian goes
[1:00:58] through to stand for your
[1:01:02] convictions stand for the
[1:01:04] word stand for Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ he says and he finished the
[1:01:11] race and you know there there goes that
[1:01:14] fight word
[1:01:16] again we've been saying fight and fight
[1:01:19] and
[1:01:20] fight I looked it up in the
[1:01:23] Greek to see what it tells me
[1:01:26] there and it says to literally
[1:01:32] struggle to compete for a
[1:01:36] prize there's a prize that I
[1:01:39] want to contend with an
[1:01:44] adversary to Endeavor to accomplish
[1:01:50] something to fight to labor
[1:01:55] and to fervently
[1:01:58] strive so young people if you don't get
[1:02:00] it by
[1:02:03] now it's time to
[1:02:07] fight everyone in here seas in
[1:02:12] Christians has been fighting every step
[1:02:14] of the
[1:02:17] way and so it's time for us to fight as
[1:02:21] young
[1:02:23] people
[1:02:25] and you know above all in this
[1:02:28] scripture Paul says most
[1:02:33] importantly that he has kept the
[1:02:38] faith that Faith once delivered to the
[1:02:41] saints that Faith handed down generation
[1:02:44] after
[1:02:46] generation that faith is Satan's been
[1:02:48] trying so hard to
[1:02:53] destroy and he's got so many weapons to
[1:02:56] destroy that faith for the
[1:03:01] Youth education is getting
[1:03:05] better video games and movies are
[1:03:07] getting
[1:03:09] better ideologies and spiritualities are
[1:03:12] getting more
[1:03:18] tremendous even the attack on the
[1:03:21] message is getting more powerful
[1:03:27] and who is it
[1:03:28] attacking not the seasoned veterans that
[1:03:31] we have in
[1:03:34] here but the young people that are
[1:03:38] starting that have just had an
[1:03:42] experience and I was reading brother
[1:03:45] brandham and how many times he
[1:03:49] says even after receiving the Holy
[1:03:53] Ghost how you struggle and struggle and
[1:03:58] struggle and I think of the young
[1:04:01] people you know even after they've been
[1:04:05] baptized even after receiving the new
[1:04:09] birth they're so fresh and so
[1:04:13] tender the devil is just like a roaring
[1:04:16] line waiting to
[1:04:20] attack but be strong young
[1:04:23] people
[1:04:24] we've come to
[1:04:27] fight you know that faith is the whole
[1:04:29] Foundation of
[1:04:33] Christianity if not for that
[1:04:36] Faith this Bible might as well be like a
[1:04:39] a Harry Potter
[1:04:42] book Harry Pot it might as well be a
[1:04:45] fairy
[1:04:46] tale but it's faith that makes it real
[1:04:49] to the
[1:04:52] Christian it's the Holy Ghost
[1:04:55] ghost that gives it life when we open
[1:04:57] the
[1:05:00] pages it's the holy ghost that gives it
[1:05:02] a Vindication in our
[1:05:05] lives it's the holy ghost that can make
[1:05:08] this ancient book relevant
[1:05:14] today how many times do our brother
[1:05:16] Emanuel preached to
[1:05:18] us and he can take something so old and
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:23] insignificant
[1:05:25] that God shows them how we're living
[1:05:27] that right here right
[1:05:32] now because this is a book that will
[1:05:34] that has lasted throughout the
[1:05:39] ages it's lasted throughout eternity
[1:05:41] because it's the word of
[1:05:46] God and we need
[1:05:49] Faith young people you need Faith to
[1:05:51] believe
[1:05:53] it you need simple Faith just to even
[1:05:56] open and read
[1:06:00] it and we're going to need Faith to
[1:06:03] fight we're going to need Faith to reach
[1:06:05] the end of the
[1:06:08] journey I I want some of that
[1:06:10] Pentecostal
[1:06:13] faith not that denominational false
[1:06:16] Pentecostal
[1:06:19] Faith but I want some of that book of
[1:06:21] Acts Pentecostal faith
[1:06:26] where I can cry out to the
[1:06:28] Lord father I want a Pentecostal Faith
[1:06:33] experience I want to be able to
[1:06:37] cry I want to shout unto you I want to
[1:06:41] dance I want to speak in
[1:06:43] tongues however God will manifest
[1:06:46] himself to
[1:06:48] you however he'll show himself in
[1:06:52] you you're going to need that Holy Ghost
[1:06:57] experience you're going to need that
[1:06:59] experience of Faith young
[1:07:03] person because you're going to have to
[1:07:05] build upon that and build upon
[1:07:09] that trial after
[1:07:12] trial adding to that faith and adding to
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:18] faith I'm going to need that Faith to
[1:07:20] fight every step of the
[1:07:22] way
[1:07:26] know we see many things with these
[1:07:27] carnal
[1:07:30] eyes and and there's such a stumbling
[1:07:32] block for
[1:07:35] us you know we we suffer afflictions In
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:41] Flesh some of which they even get us
[1:07:45] doubting and it's going to happen over
[1:07:48] and over and over
[1:07:51] again and and when I see know young
[1:07:53] people people like my brother
[1:07:57] Reuben and then it makes me look in the
[1:07:59] mirror of my
[1:08:02] life how many times did I fall over and
[1:08:05] over and over
[1:08:09] again but you know the Lord was always
[1:08:11] there to pick me
[1:08:15] up and you know sometimes it's a
[1:08:17] difference how you
[1:08:20] fall sometimes you fall from a
[1:08:23] three-step stair like this right
[1:08:28] here and you just sprain your ankle a
[1:08:30] little
[1:08:32] bit but sometimes you fall from a 20
[1:08:35] foot
[1:08:38] ladder and you break your
[1:08:42] hip and there's the enemy getting at you
[1:08:44] once
[1:08:46] again you see you see what you were
[1:08:49] doing you see the condition you're in
[1:08:52] now you shouldn't have been playing
[1:08:56] Church you shouldn't have been messing
[1:08:57] around with those
[1:08:59] things you shouldn't have been getting
[1:09:01] into those
[1:09:05] websites now you've crossed the
[1:09:08] line now you've gone too
[1:09:11] far there's no more hope you've lost
[1:09:15] your
[1:09:16] salvation lies of the
[1:09:19] devil brother brandom says in the
[1:09:21] message questions and
[1:09:22] answers
[1:09:25] he's trying to make you feel like
[1:09:27] because you're
[1:09:31] backsliding that you're
[1:09:33] lost there's no
[1:09:35] hope that this is it for
[1:09:37] you brother BR says backsliding is not
[1:09:42] lost I want somebody to tell me where
[1:09:45] backsliding is
[1:09:49] lost prove it in the
[1:09:51] Bible backslider is is not
[1:09:55] lost he's just out of
[1:09:59] Fellowship that's so tremendous to
[1:10:02] me Israel backslid but they were never
[1:10:05] they never lost their
[1:10:08] Covenant they just lost their praises

[1:10:17] salvation but he never lost his
[1:10:21] salvation he never said restore unto me

[1:10:41] heard oh yeah that sister unfortunately
[1:10:44] she's a
[1:10:46] backslider though the brother he's kind
[1:10:48] of backsliding right
[1:10:51] now you know that we we've all heard
[1:10:53] that
[1:10:54] that no but that that that it's just the
[1:10:57] brother's gotten out of
[1:11:01] Fellowship not out of fellowship with
[1:11:03] the
[1:11:05] church no not that no fellow out of
[1:11:08] fellowship with
[1:11:11] Christ maybe there's a young person here
[1:11:16] today might be saying in their mind or
[1:11:18] in their
[1:11:20] heart probably their brains already
[1:11:22] starting to work
[1:11:26] they're thinking well brother
[1:11:29] Marcos I'm I'm always in
[1:11:33] Fellowship I've never I don't never miss
[1:11:36] service I don't never miss a tape
[1:11:40] night I haven't missed a single Jericho
[1:11:43] Camp since we
[1:11:48] started I'm always in
[1:11:51] Fellowship the question is but are you
[1:11:53] in fellowship with
[1:11:57] God that is the
[1:12:00] difference you can come to tape
[1:12:04] night you can come to Friday night and
[1:12:06] fulfill your posted
[1:12:11] duty but when you're at home all
[1:12:14] alone when it's just you and
[1:12:17] God are you in fellowship with
[1:12:21] God are you having a a relationship with
[1:12:26] God do you have a prayer life with
[1:12:30] God you know I've made the mistake many
[1:12:33] times to describe a
[1:12:37] backslider so
[1:12:40] negatively to where I might as well call
[1:12:42] them and label them
[1:12:48] lost but brother Bram said they're not
[1:12:51] lost that's still my brother brother and
[1:12:53] my
[1:12:54] sister he's just
[1:12:58] backsliding young person maybe you're
[1:13:00] backsliding
[1:13:03] tonight maybe you're just going through
[1:13:05] the motions
[1:13:08] tonight but you're still a son and
[1:13:10] daughter of
[1:13:12] God there's still
[1:13:14] Grace there's still
[1:13:16] Mercy you are still a son and daughter
[1:13:19] of
[1:13:22] God get get back in connection with
[1:13:27] God get back in fellowship with
[1:13:32] god brother brand says in questions and
[1:13:36] answers yes you've not sinned my
[1:13:41] friend you've not sinned so far in God
[1:13:44] to where you could not be
[1:13:49] restored whatever sins you haven't told
[1:13:51] Mama and Daddy
[1:13:55] you have not sinned so far where you
[1:13:57] cannot be
[1:14:01] restored if you sinned so far that you
[1:14:04] could not be
[1:14:09] restored here's the
[1:14:11] key you'd never want to be
[1:14:16] restored says see you
[1:14:19] see but as long as there's something
[1:14:22] dealing with your heart
[1:14:27] you're still in the line of
[1:14:31] restoration I'm reminded of our sister
[1:14:34] Flo when she got
[1:14:37] baptized I don't know the timeline of
[1:14:39] her
[1:14:42] life but from looking at her I thought
[1:14:44] you know she was right with the
[1:14:48] Lord and I don't know how many young
[1:14:50] people might be in that
[1:14:52] condition
[1:14:55] maybe you know you were backsliding
[1:14:57] right
[1:15:00] now but if something's pulling at your
[1:15:03] heart even though you don't say it with
[1:15:05] your
[1:15:06] mouth even though you don't raise your
[1:15:08] hand in
[1:15:10] church even though you never say
[1:15:14] Amen but something's tugging at your
[1:15:17] heart then you're still in line for
[1:15:22] restoration
[1:15:25] it's in our
[1:15:27] heart you don't want to be the way that
[1:15:29] you you don't want to be that
[1:15:31] way or you wouldn't ask this
[1:15:37] question because this was a question
[1:15:39] that was
[1:15:41] asked if she could still be
[1:15:45] saved because of the backsliding
[1:15:47] condition that she was
[1:15:49] in so you wouldn't ask this question
[1:15:55] that itself is a proof that God is still
[1:15:57] dealing with
[1:16:00] you if you
[1:16:04] care if if something is just tugging at
[1:16:08] you that's proof that God is still
[1:16:10] dealing with
[1:16:13] you you've probably gotten
[1:16:17] nervous probably Satan telling you that
[1:16:19] you can't be
[1:16:22] restored
[1:16:23] he's lying and he certainly
[1:16:27] is we want to take the mask off the
[1:16:29] devil
[1:16:32] tonight tell them stop lying to these
[1:16:34] young
[1:16:36] people they've been dedicated to the
[1:16:39] lord they're here serving you in their
[1:16:42] post of
[1:16:44] Duty and if they feel that
[1:16:46] pole father restore them
[1:16:50] tonight don't let don't let your let the
[1:16:52] enemy build a callous around your
[1:16:57] heart build this big brick wall around
[1:16:59] your
[1:17:02] heart remember Jesus is at the door
[1:17:06] knocking and he's just not knocking at
[1:17:08] everybody's
[1:17:10] door he's knocking at the doors of those
[1:17:14] that will open the
[1:17:18] door he came for the whole
[1:17:21] world but the whole world will not
[1:17:23] accept
[1:17:25] him so he's not going to waste his
[1:17:29] time on those that won't open the
[1:17:33] door he's been knocking at your
[1:17:38] door patiently waiting that you'll open
[1:17:40] the door to
[1:17:44] him you know sometimes you might get
[1:17:46] more obsessed for your career than
[1:17:50] Jesus more obsessed for your boyfriend
[1:17:53] and a girlfriend than
[1:17:57] Jesus but he's still
[1:17:59] knocking he's going to keep on
[1:18:02] knocking because he knows that one
[1:18:06] day you're going to open that
[1:18:09] door he knocked
[1:18:12] before and that's when you opened
[1:18:15] it that's why you got
[1:18:18] baptized he knocked
[1:18:21] before and that's why you received the
[1:18:23] new
[1:18:26] birth he's knocked
[1:18:28] before and that's why you received the
[1:18:31] Holy
[1:18:33] Ghost but maybe your backlit
[1:18:36] in maybe I've
[1:18:38] fallen maybe I did something I'm not
[1:18:40] supposed to
[1:18:42] do and it's slowly putting me in a hole
[1:18:45] getting me out of
[1:18:49] Fellowship maybe even making me bitter
[1:18:54] maybe making me
[1:18:56] scared but Jesus Christ don't care about
[1:19:00] that he's going to keep on
[1:19:03] knocking and keep on
[1:19:06] knocking because if you're a Son of
[1:19:08] God if you're a daughter of
[1:19:11] God he knows sooner or
[1:19:14] later you're going to open that door and
[1:19:16] invite him back
[1:19:20] in if You' all please stand we're going
[1:19:22] to be Clos
[1:19:25] in the message the Ephesians Church
[1:19:29] age brother BR
[1:19:31] says but where's that first love you
[1:19:34] once
[1:19:37] had he says
[1:19:39] uhhuh where's that Joy you used to
[1:19:44] have you know when I first got
[1:19:49] baptized and I first had my
[1:19:51] experience
[1:19:53] I was early to church every
[1:19:57] Sunday I had this joy and this glow
[1:19:59] about me every
[1:20:02] day I couldn't wait to be asked to be
[1:20:05] used in the
[1:20:09] church you know that first love
[1:20:12] joy brother Brown says where's that Joy
[1:20:14] you used to
[1:20:18] have as David once
[1:20:21] cried oh Lord restore to me the joy of
[1:20:24] my
[1:20:27] salvation where's them all night prayer
[1:20:32] meetings young person when's the last
[1:20:35] time you've come to the altar just to
[1:20:39] pray when's the last time you came early
[1:20:41] to service just to come here and
[1:20:46] pray brother BR said where's all them
[1:20:48] all night prayer
[1:20:51] meetings
[1:20:54] and the tears on your
[1:20:56] cheek how long has it been since he's
[1:20:58] touched
[1:21:01] you and you can't control
[1:21:05] yourself and you just let the tears flow
[1:21:08] from
[1:21:10] you let his holy spirit just bathe
[1:21:15] you says my goodness even the Bible's
[1:21:18] got Dusty and cobwebs on
[1:21:21] it
[1:21:24] he said we need to get back to our first
[1:21:28] love back to
[1:21:31] Pentecost like David says in
[1:21:35] Psalms create in me a clean heart oh
[1:21:39] God renew a spirit Within
[1:21:43] Me cast me not away from thy
[1:21:47] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:21:50] from
[1:21:51] me restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:21:57] salvation Revelation
[1:22:00] 2
[1:22:02] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:22:05] thee because thou has left thy first
[1:22:10] love maybe that's you tonight who's left
[1:22:12] your first
[1:22:15] love he says remember therefore from
[1:22:18] whence Thou Art
[1:22:21] Fallen
[1:22:23] we're from Heavenly
[1:22:26] places we're from a Heavenly
[1:22:28] Kingdom maybe we got a rocked and
[1:22:31] knocked us down real
[1:22:35] quick but it says
[1:22:39] repent and do those first
[1:22:42] Works go find where you left
[1:22:47] Jesus go find where you stopped serving
[1:22:49] him like you used to serve
[1:22:51] him
[1:22:55] I'm hurt because someone did this or
[1:22:56] that to
[1:22:59] me I'm hurt because I didn't end up with
[1:23:02] this person or end up dating that
[1:23:07] person I'm hurt because I got
[1:23:09] embarrassed whatever it might be young
[1:23:13] person go back to that point in
[1:23:17] time recognize that it was Satan trying
[1:23:20] to knock you
[1:23:21] down
[1:23:25] go back to those first works of love you
[1:23:26] used to
[1:23:30] have brother brandham says in
[1:23:32] condemnation by
[1:23:35] representation you might have left him
[1:23:38] at
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:40] baptism you might have left him at the
[1:23:42] Holy
[1:23:45] Ghost you might have left him somewhere
[1:23:49] else wherever you left him
[1:23:53] don't take this Hy breing Church
[1:23:58] stuff there's one to represent
[1:24:02] you represent you for
[1:24:05] salvation you don't have to be a
[1:24:08] sinner you don't have to be
[1:24:11] that you are if you
[1:24:13] are God don't hold you responsible for
[1:24:16] being a
[1:24:19] sinner he won't hold you responsible
[1:24:21] from now on
[1:24:25] but he's going to hold you
[1:24:28] responsible if you reject
[1:24:31] this he's not going to hold you
[1:24:35] responsible because that may be in the
[1:24:39] past that you didn't know any different
[1:24:41] from water
[1:24:45] baptism or from receiving the holy
[1:24:48] ghost or the power of God might not hold
[1:24:52] you responsible for
[1:24:55] that you might not have heard of it
[1:24:58] before but from here
[1:25:01] on you know
[1:25:03] better so come back to the
[1:25:07] word come back to
[1:25:09] God so you close your eyes
[1:25:12] brother come back to the
[1:25:15] word come back to
[1:25:18] God you might have left him at baptism
[1:25:23] you left him at the Holy
[1:25:26] Ghost you left him a year ago or 10
[1:25:29] years
[1:25:32] ago but he's right there
[1:25:36] waiting he's waiting for you to come
[1:25:40] back and he's going to take you forward
[1:25:43] stronger than
[1:25:46] ever this is just part of your
[1:25:51] testimony part of your
[1:25:53] experience part of what's going to make
[1:25:55] you stronger young
[1:25:59] person but the key
[1:26:01] lies for you to go back where you left
[1:26:07] God he says and what is the way
[1:26:13] back the way of
[1:26:18] repentance if a sinner has to come to
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:24] by way of
[1:26:26] repentance then the lukewarm
[1:26:30] believer then the
[1:26:32] backslider will have to repent that much
[1:26:37] more I don't care if you're lukewarm
[1:26:41] tonight God don't care if you're
[1:26:42] lukewarm
[1:26:44] tonight God don't care if you're a
[1:26:46] backslider
[1:26:49] tonight God don't care how much evil
[1:26:51] you've done
[1:26:54] tonight all that God cares is that you
[1:26:56] can
[1:27:00] repent and if you need to
[1:27:03] repent just open your heart
[1:27:07] tonight tell him with your
[1:27:09] heart Father I remember how I used to
[1:27:14] be when I served you with all my
[1:27:18] heart the way I used to
[1:27:21] interpret
[1:27:22] the way I used to
[1:27:25] songly the way I used to help in the
[1:27:30] audio
[1:27:32] School the way I used to help in
[1:27:36] church I see now
[1:27:39] Lord where I left you
[1:27:42] behind but God
[1:27:45] today I hear you
[1:27:47] knocking and I open the door to
[1:27:50] you come in
[1:27:53] and clean everything
[1:27:55] out I've let more demons into my
[1:28:00] heart then I should have ever let come
[1:28:04] in I let more evil come into my
[1:28:08] mind then I should have ever let come
[1:28:11] in but God I know when you
[1:28:15] enter you can kick those demons
[1:28:18] out you can clean my house
[1:28:22] and I can serve you like I used
[1:28:25] to I accept you tonight

[1:28:32] heart I love you Lord I left you behind
[1:28:35] but I love you
