[56:02] [Music]
[56:08] necessary

[56:16] precious than gold that perisheth
[56:18] though it be tried with fire it may be

[58:04] my title this morning
[58:08] is tried by fire or a trial by fire yes
[58:14] it's a very simple message
[58:17] but i believe it's something so needed
[58:19] for each and every one of us
[58:24] each and every one of us we go through
[58:26] our
[58:26] different trials and our different
[58:28] temptations
[58:33] and
[58:34] we go through them for different reasons
[58:40] there's people that have to go through
[58:42] trials
[58:43] uh so that they can grow stronger in the
[58:46] lord
[58:51] there's trials that we have gone through
[58:53] because we had did something wrong and
[58:55] we made that path for ourselves
[59:03] there's different
[59:04] trials for each and every person and
[59:06] each and every reason
[59:11] and it's our trial
[59:13] it's our personal trial
[59:17] i can never say that my trial is greater
[59:19] than somebody else's
[59:23] persona i can never truly understand
[59:26] what another person is going through
[59:27] [Music]
[59:39] just like each and every person is going
[59:41] through their own trials
[59:45] and god knows why you have to go through
[59:47] those temptations those trials and
[59:49] tribulations
[59:55] but every christian
[59:57] christian
[59:58] every person that confessed
[1:00:01] jesus christ
[1:00:05] every person that says i am a christian
[1:00:09] this morning
[1:00:12] cristiano
[1:00:14] who's a christian this morning
[1:00:17] who's brave enough to say i am a
[1:00:19] christian this morning
[1:00:24] every christian
[1:00:26] christian
[1:00:27] will have to go through a trial
[1:00:31] that's similar to each and every person
[1:00:36] and that's the trial of our faith
[1:00:40] we all go through different trials
[1:00:44] for different reasons
[1:00:47] but every christian that confessed jesus
[1:00:49] christ
[1:00:53] has to go through a trial of faith
[1:00:59] and in the eyes of the person that's
[1:01:00] going through the trial
[1:01:05] they might think that they're just
[1:01:07] getting beat down by
[1:01:20] it's a tribulation of
[1:01:23] de la life
[1:01:24] and most times we cannot see past the
[1:01:26] trials or the fire
[1:01:28] la mayor de vega
[1:01:32] we cannot see that it's something that
[1:01:34] is for our own benefits
[1:01:36] verde
[1:02:04] and it's a test of faith
[1:02:07] it's something that we have to go
[1:02:09] through
[1:02:10] to see if we pass or we don't pass yes
[1:02:16] in court the the ones that are um
[1:02:20] are suspected to be guilty
[1:02:26] they have to go through a trial
[1:02:30] and they go through certain evidences
[1:02:32] and tests
[1:02:36] to see if
[1:02:37] they are
[1:02:38] convicted or they are the the person
[1:02:41] that is suspected to do the crime
[1:03:26] i believe jesus christ
[1:03:48] and every day they that question will
[1:03:50] come to you every single day
[1:03:55] can you live for christ what
[1:03:58] can you suffer for christ
[1:04:01] can you go through this trial by fire
[1:04:03] especially
[1:04:07] in isaiah 48 10.
[1:04:21] i have chosen thee in the furnace of
[1:04:24] affliction
[1:04:29] i have chosen you in the furnace of
[1:04:31] affliction
[1:04:34] of the affliction the bible says that we
[1:04:37] are our faith is being tried
[1:04:41] being more precious than gold
[1:04:46] your
[1:04:47] trial and your faith not your faith but
[1:04:50] your trial of your faith no no
[1:04:54] is more precious than gold
[1:04:58] it's more precious than gold
[1:05:02] the
[1:05:03] most
[1:05:03] greatest thing on earth is gold today
[1:05:15] what people are looking for is gold
[1:05:34] that's what makes these great cities
[1:05:37] thrive because of the goals
[1:05:43] but yet our little trial
[1:05:46] bro
[1:06:10] all the things that we have to go
[1:06:12] through that nobody knows and nobody
[1:06:14] cares
[1:06:27] your trial of faith
[1:06:30] is more precious than gold
[1:06:34] if
[1:06:35] you would like to turn with me to
[1:06:37] daniel chapter 3
[1:06:44] say a little story this this morning
[1:06:50] the story
[1:06:51] of
[1:06:53] meshech shattered
[1:06:55] the message
[1:07:15] in daniel 3 1 it says
[1:07:17] daniel 3
[1:07:19] nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[1:07:21] gold
[1:07:22] whose height was three score cubits and
[1:07:25] breath thereof six cubits and he set set
[1:07:29] it up in a plane of dura
[1:07:31] in the province of babylon
[1:07:46] now uh
[1:07:47] you know we truly don't understand what
[1:07:50] uh three score cubits is if you know
[1:07:53] we don't read our bible
[1:08:16] you don't know how much money that truly
[1:08:18] is
[1:08:22] i don't know how much gold cost today
[1:08:27] it might be 1600 an ounce okay
[1:08:30] uh this is meal
[1:08:33] uh a thousand an ounce or a meal
[1:08:37] but imagine a 90-foot tall
[1:08:40] pure gold image
[1:08:46] how much value that was
[1:08:49] how much it must have shined in the sun
[1:08:52] whenever the sun would would hit that
[1:08:54] image
[1:09:00] and when he made this great statue this
[1:09:02] great image is
[1:09:17] he said when music is played
[1:09:34] and if you don't bow down to the image
[1:09:38] you are cast into the fiery furnace
[1:09:43] so then we see their first test test
[1:09:48] the first test is am i going to bow down
[1:09:51] to this image
[1:09:56] am i going to
[1:09:58] succumb to the things of the world
[1:10:13] if i could only find um
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:56] americano we found that he would worship
[1:10:59] the sun in contrary
[1:11:02] he believed that there was a happy
[1:11:04] hunting ground
[1:11:08] when one died they put corn and so forth
[1:11:15] his bow and arrow and he set him across
[1:11:17] the sea somewhere in his canoe
[1:11:23] that he would find a happy hunting
[1:11:25] ground where he would
[1:11:26] have provisions to carry him over
[1:11:34] there's something in the human heart
[1:11:37] that calls out for worship
[1:11:45] so this statement makes me understand
[1:11:47] things very simply
[1:11:49] declaration
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:12:19] man was made to worship
[1:12:23] oh well you know i don't worship god but
[1:12:26] i i don't do all those things of the
[1:12:28] world
[1:12:33] i've heard that many times muchas versus
[1:12:36] oh well i don't drink
[1:12:38] tomorrow i don't smoke
[1:12:40] it's just me and my family namaste uh is
[1:12:43] yo my family but yet they're worshiping
[1:12:45] something
[1:13:29] worshiping something else and put that
[1:13:32] before god
[1:13:36] in exodus it says you shall not have any
[1:13:39] gods before me
[1:13:44] you shall not have anything
[1:13:47] whether it's an object or a person
[1:13:50] or persona you cannot put it before god
[1:13:53] us
[1:13:58] i'm a witness to that
[1:14:01] where somebody puts
[1:14:03] their
[1:14:04] person or that thing before god
[1:14:08] persona
[1:14:11] god has to show them
[1:14:24] every man will fall and every man will
[1:14:26] fail
[1:14:37] everything we put before god will fall
[1:14:39] and we'll see the demise of it
[1:14:45] whether it's a house or whatever it
[1:14:48] might be
[1:14:51] so we know that
[1:14:54] we know that anything we put before god
[1:14:56] is an idol
[1:15:00] so
[1:15:01] what does it mean to bow down they all
[1:15:04] had to bow down before this image
[1:15:11] they all had to submit themselves
[1:15:16] it means to bow down means to submit
[1:15:19] themselves to whatever they bow to er
[1:15:35] in the conflict between
[1:15:38] god and satan this is
[1:15:40] conflict
[1:15:42] you know
[1:15:43] you have to ignore before
[1:15:46] us
[1:15:49] in order to believe the devil's lie
[1:16:08] you have to deny the truth first before
[1:16:11] you could believe a lie right have to
[1:16:14] deny it
[1:16:17] is
[1:16:44] he said in order to believe satan's lie
[1:16:48] la mentira del diablo you have to deny
[1:16:50] god's truth first
[1:16:54] he put satan's
[1:16:57] word before god's word
[1:17:13] anything you put before
[1:17:25] so even the word of god even the doubt
[1:17:28] that we
[1:17:51] when you see the circumstance with your
[1:17:53] family tells you to bow down
[1:17:59] whenever you think oh the word didn't
[1:18:01] really mean that it's telling you to bow
[1:18:04] down to that word
[1:18:38] had people pray for me
[1:18:41] but yet this trial is just too great
[1:18:46] we put the devil's lie in front of god
[1:18:52] and made it our
[1:19:06] it's just as simple as that it's
[1:19:07] haciency it's as simple as just uh
[1:19:11] bowing down to your sickness
[1:19:16] bowing down to your problems
[1:19:20] and say well that's just the way it's
[1:19:21] going to be
[1:19:24] no not for god
[1:19:27] god's word says this
[1:19:30] that he is a healer
[1:19:33] but by his stripes i am healed
[1:19:37] it says that he is a very present help
[1:19:39] in the time of trouble
[1:19:42] for the problems then i throw every
[1:19:44] other thing out of the picture
[1:19:49] knowing that it's just the devil trying
[1:19:52] to make me bow down to his words
[1:19:58] to have that uncompromising face
[1:20:02] to stand on what you believe in
[1:20:06] every single person bowed down
[1:20:10] and there was three men that stood there
[1:20:14] faithful to the words
[1:20:19] they might have looked um
[1:20:21] just
[1:20:22] they might have looked weird just
[1:20:23] standing there where every single person
[1:20:26] thousands of people bowed down
[1:20:44] faith goes beyond your problems goes
[1:20:46] beyond the glamour of the world
[1:20:52] when you can consider the world in all
[1:20:55] its riches in all its glory
[1:20:57] considered
[1:21:00] and look at the trials that you would
[1:21:02] have to go through as a christian
[1:21:06] cristiano and you compare them
[1:21:10] it doesn't seem right
[1:21:12] uh
[1:21:18] it doesn't seem easy to to turn away
[1:21:20] from the glamour and live that beautiful
[1:21:22] life
[1:21:27] but faith doesn't see the problems
[1:21:32] faith looks beyond all trials and
[1:21:35] tribulations
[1:21:39] there was one time when moses
[1:21:43] moses and pharaoh were standing side by
[1:21:46] side
[1:21:49] and pharaoh looked at all the slaves
[1:21:51] there
[1:21:53] there working
[1:22:06] but when moses stepped out and he looked
[1:22:08] at those people
[1:22:11] pueblo he said that's jacob this is
[1:22:14] jacob that's god's chosen people
[1:22:19] those are the people that are supposed
[1:22:20] to be in the promised land
[1:22:26] when the world sees the worst in in
[1:22:29] god's people
[1:22:33] god sees goals
[1:22:36] god sees the greatest thing on earth
[1:22:40] people that are struggling and trying to
[1:22:43] be to uh to overcome
[1:22:48] believing in the word of god
[1:23:04] to believe and to stand even though the
[1:23:06] world
[1:23:08] uh offers them something different
[1:23:15] god wants christians with integrity
[1:23:22] how many people bowed down
[1:23:26] how many people bowed down that were
[1:23:28] true devout jews quantos personas
[1:23:46] to go through the furnace
[1:23:49] they said well
[1:23:50] i just have to bow to this image
[1:23:55] i just have to compromise that work just
[1:23:57] a little bit
[1:24:00] i just have to compromise
[1:24:02] with this and that just a little bit
[1:24:05] okay
[1:24:07] i just have to do this and that
[1:24:10] yes and then i could get up and just
[1:24:12] continue to serve the lord
[1:24:19] god wants somebody to stand for what's
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:24] whether you receive something or you
[1:24:26] don't
[1:24:42] god wants somebody to stand for him
[1:24:46] so people could say
[1:24:49] that person is different
[1:24:52] that person didn't bow when everybody
[1:24:54] else bowed
[1:24:58] even though it was something so simple
[1:25:00] for algo
[1:25:01] even though they could have just got up
[1:25:03] and went by their days
[1:25:07] yet they stood with the word and did not
[1:25:09] bow or compromise machine
[1:25:24] this faith is going to lead you to the
[1:25:26] fire estafe
[1:25:29] your integrity for god so integrity
[1:25:33] your faithfulness to god will lead you
[1:25:35] to the fires
[1:25:38] see god the devil didn't go up to god
[1:25:43] at the time of job and el tiempo de job
[1:25:45] and he didn't say
[1:25:46] oh look at joe you know
[1:25:49] oh i i bet you i can make him fall
[1:26:06] you
[1:26:34] they're going to the biggest baddest
[1:26:36] person
[1:26:39] hey you don't want to mess with eli
[1:26:43] you don't want to mess with him
[1:26:46] all right be quiet
[1:26:48] i

[1:27:43] he has a product and he says here try it
[1:27:47] for 30 days
[1:27:49] try it
[1:27:51] you can break it you can beat it you can
[1:27:53] try anything you want to do
[1:27:56] i have confidence in my product
[1:27:58] confidence
[1:28:12] poor little job didn't know he couldn't
[1:28:13] see past the fire
[1:28:16] home
[1:28:17] he said why lord because
[1:28:20] all
[1:28:21] just there in a hash heap
[1:28:25] even his wife said you should just curse
[1:28:27] god and die
[1:28:31] and he couldn't see past the fire
[1:28:35] he couldn't see past the trials
[1:28:38] yet it was god trying his child
[1:28:54] my son
[1:29:22] wishy-washy christians
[1:29:25] i have a quality product
[1:29:29] that's what miss shack shadow wreck in
[1:29:31] the bendigo world
[1:29:34] i don't care if all i have to do is bow
[1:29:50] whenever
[1:29:51] everything goes well yeah
[1:29:54] but just one time don't compromise with
[1:29:57] the word
[1:30:00] one time you stand on the word of god
[1:30:04] and all
[1:30:16] the bible says that
[1:30:18] nebuchadnezzar got angry
[1:30:22] even his face chained he was just so
[1:30:24] angry with these young men
[1:30:29] and he goes and he says all you have to
[1:30:31] do is bow it back on
[1:31:15] we are not careful to answer in this
[1:31:18] matter
[1:31:20] is necessary okay
[1:31:23] that means we don't have to think about
[1:31:25] it
[1:31:28] i don't have to weigh out my decisions
[1:31:30] and say well let me see
[1:31:32] okay
[1:31:36] he said we don't we don't even have
[1:31:37] another thought of it we will not bow
[1:31:42] respect
[1:31:46] if it be so our god whom we serve is
[1:31:50] able to deliver us from the fiery
[1:31:53] burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:31:55] deliver us out of thine hand
[1:32:07] our god is able
[1:32:10] not he
[1:32:20] unto thee o king that we will not serve
[1:32:23] thy gods nor worship the golden image
[1:32:25] which thou has set up
[1:32:34] wow what kind of faith is this
[1:32:38] he is able el puede but if not
[1:32:42] you know when i was a uh
[1:32:44] first gave my heart to the lord
[1:32:49] this scripture would would
[1:32:51] i would struggle with the scripture
[1:32:56] i thought that this scripture almost
[1:32:58] gave me an excuse to say god might or
[1:33:01] might not
[1:33:02] ok
[1:33:31] the children of the hebrew children did
[1:33:33] not say well he might and he might not
[1:33:35] well i don't know but i'll still serve
[1:33:37] him
[1:33:42] this is unadulterated faith
[1:33:46] this is the same faith abraham has
[1:33:48] islamism
[1:33:50] this is just a story that shows us a
[1:33:53] different perspective of faith
[1:34:00] most people's faith is based on their
[1:34:02] deliverance
[1:34:11] i believe in the lord i serve him
[1:34:12] because i know he'll get me this
[1:34:15] is
[1:34:19] and faith is based on that prize or that
[1:34:21] deliverance or that salvation premium
[1:34:28] but that's not how true faith works
[1:34:33] faith is based on their love for the
[1:34:35] lord
[1:34:40] true faith is based upon the devotion to
[1:34:43] him
[1:34:58] it's not going
[1:35:12] oh
[1:35:21] i guess the lord didn't want me to get
[1:35:22] this so i have this
[1:35:26] thing
[1:36:05] if i could do it i will love the lord
[1:36:08] with all my heart
[1:36:12] his love wasn't based on the gifts god
[1:36:14] gave him so mora
[1:36:18] his love wasn't based on the
[1:36:20] deliverances that god gave him
[1:36:24] his faith was based on the lord and the
[1:36:27] relationship with the lord
[1:36:32] job says though he slay me yet i will
[1:36:35] trust him
[1:36:49] so what he said was turn the fiery
[1:36:53] furnace seven times harder
[1:36:59] he was angry he was ready to throw him
[1:37:01] in the fiery
[1:37:04] furnace know what seven means it means
[1:37:07] completion or fullness
[1:37:12] it was the fullness of their trial
[1:37:17] it was the maximum of the trial for the
[1:37:20] maximum
[1:37:21] we are in the last days
[1:37:24] where that that uh pale horse rider will
[1:37:28] come
[1:37:30] and he will come with death
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:38:00] not
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:11] you have to be the living word of god
[1:38:28] not just the tablets
[1:38:30] but it's me
[1:38:32] i am the word now all right
[1:38:35] you are the walking word now
[1:38:38] that's what's going to defeat everything
[1:38:40] that satan throws
[1:38:56] begin
[1:39:09] have you fasted to the lord
[1:39:13] are you guys ready to go into this fiery
[1:39:15] furnace
[1:39:18] are you ready to go through this
[1:39:20] tribulation
[1:39:23] they said amen
[1:39:35] the bible says beloved thinking not
[1:39:37] strange they say amal's
[1:39:52] it's not something strange
[1:39:56] nebuchadnezzar had this great image
[1:40:00] and it was
[1:40:02] probably the most expensive thing in all
[1:40:04] the world
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:35] that the trial of your faith being more
[1:40:38] precious
[1:40:39] than of gold that perishes
[1:40:46] the gold of god is a christ-like
[1:40:49] character
[1:40:54] produced by the fiery furnace of
[1:40:56] affliction
[1:41:02] that's the right kind of gold
[1:41:05] but what kind of gold does the church
[1:41:07] have today
[1:41:10] it has a worldly gold that will perish
[1:41:15] it is rich
[1:41:17] it is complacent agusta it is made
[1:41:19] affluence uh the major criterion of
[1:41:22] spirituality
[1:41:28] the evidence of god's blessing and
[1:41:30] correctness of doctrine etc
[1:41:36] etc is now based upon how many rich
[1:41:39] folks you are involved in
[1:41:45] you had better come before it's too late
[1:41:47] saith the lord
[1:41:52] and buy of me gold tribe
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:25] it's that christ-like character this is
[1:42:27] a character
[1:42:28] how do we produce that character
[1:42:32] through the fiery furnace
[1:42:36] of trials and tribulations
[1:42:39] thinking not strange that you go through
[1:42:41] those things
[1:42:46] we go through many things every single
[1:42:48] day
[1:42:51] but it's because you made a stand that i
[1:42:54] am a
[1:43:42] you know a little kid 10 12 years old
[1:43:44] gets pains
[1:43:49] come on come in and say mama my arm
[1:43:51] hurts my legs are hurting
[1:43:56] so forth it's growing pains
[1:44:00] it shows that he's has got some good
[1:44:03] vitamins moisturized
[1:44:08] and when somebody begins to make fun of
[1:44:10] you and say oh she's old-fashioned
[1:44:17] look at him oh i tell you he used to be
[1:44:19] all right just a member growing up
[1:44:22] all right but just remember it's growing
[1:44:24] pains
[1:44:31] that's that persecution is good for
[1:44:39] oh yes he permits crosses and crossroads
[1:44:41] and junctions
[1:44:46] he always does that in order to perfect
[1:44:48] us for his service
[1:44:55] and uh can't you understand that
[1:44:59] he does that so you can be perfect for
[1:45:01] your calling that he has called you for
[1:45:03] it
[1:45:07] and paragraph 183 it says sometimes it
[1:45:10] takes trials to break the bands of the
[1:45:13] world off of us
[1:45:29] just like a man drowning in the river
[1:45:30] you have to take him out of the river
[1:45:32] before you can take the river out of him
[1:45:40] that's about the way god does it
[1:45:42] sometimes yeah this is a siesta
[1:45:45] throw you out one time
[1:45:48] and
[1:45:49] they get the world out of you
[1:45:53] you they went in with with bands and
[1:45:55] they were tied in there
[1:46:22] we think we're going into the fiery
[1:46:23] furnace to die
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:48:16] as all that was going on on earth
[1:48:21] brother branham says it was a dark time
[1:48:24] this
[1:48:25] is a dark picture
[1:48:28] these children of god that stood for the
[1:48:31] word of the lord
[1:48:36] we're about to give their life
[1:48:38] established
[1:48:39] and there was no god to help people
[1:48:43] there was no god to respond
[1:49:14] he said have you noticed your children
[1:49:18] it's the darkest hour for them
[1:49:22] they can't get the victory
[1:49:25] send me down there and i'll flood the
[1:49:27] whole thing i'll make sure that fire is
[1:49:29] out
[1:49:33] god said no it's all right
[1:49:36] he said it's okay
[1:49:38] then michael comes up to him
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:50:07] this is a job for me
[1:50:11] brother burnham says that he bowed down
[1:50:13] the heavens
[1:50:17] and he called the east wind and the west
[1:50:19] winds
[1:50:22] and he rode upon a
[1:50:24] lightning bolt
[1:50:27] and brother brown says that it was god
[1:50:29] himself in that fire with him it is
[1:50:34] no angel no i don't know it was nobody
[1:50:37] else but god himself in your trials
[1:50:42] and your problems it's your child of
[1:50:44] faith
[1:50:46] it's not going to be this great teaching
[1:50:50] it's not going to be this great thing
[1:50:53] it's just going to be a man-sized job
[1:50:55] where god himself comes to you
[1:51:01] remember god is revealed in your
[1:51:03] affliction all right
[1:51:19] is i'm a present helper from the time of
[1:51:21] trouble
[1:51:24] what does that mean
[1:51:26] that he's present every time you're in
[1:51:28] trouble
[1:51:32] every time you're
[1:51:46] they were there thinking they were going
[1:51:47] to die
[1:51:51] but the reason they were delivered
[1:51:55] because their faith wasn't based on
[1:51:57] their deliverance
[1:52:08] [Music]
