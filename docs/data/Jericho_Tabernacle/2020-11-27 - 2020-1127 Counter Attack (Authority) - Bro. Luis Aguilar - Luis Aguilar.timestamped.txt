[29:10] amen amen let us open up our bibles
[29:16] into first samuel primera
[29:19] the 15th chapter el capital verse 22.
[29:25] it's nice to be here in the house of the
[29:26] lord is nice to see
[29:30] all of you here today yes
[29:35] i'd like to thank the lord as always for
[29:37] the life
[29:46] also our pastor brother johnny for the
[29:48] trust he owes he's always has towards us
[30:02] and samuel said hath the lord as great
[30:06] delight and birth offerings and
[30:07] sacrifices
[30:08] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[30:11] behold
[30:12] to obey is better than sacrifice
[30:15] and to hearken than the fed of rams
[30:41] says when the righteous are in authority
[30:45] the people rejoice but when the wicked
[30:47] beareth rule
[30:59] may the lord bless the reading of his
[31:02] word
[31:09] i pray that you pray pray for me in your
[31:13] mind
[31:16] in your heart
[31:26] [Music]
[31:37] so we can bring something for the young
[31:38] people
[31:41] and um i in this evening i have a title
[32:12] and if the church can only understand
[32:15] it how much authority they have
[32:21] in the church in the the individual
[32:24] individual they have a revival when they
[32:26] hear that
[32:29] so i have authority i can do this
[32:32] and i can do that i can come here and i
[32:36] can speak the name of the lord
[32:40] and that's nothing but the truth yes
[32:44] but there is a process system process
[32:47] there is a way
[32:48] access to god has given us the message
[32:52] and we must listen to the messages
[33:09] there is a process existing processor uh
[33:12] on matthew 28 18
[33:14] in mateo when when the lord
[33:18] resurrected he went through a lot of
[33:21] things el paso
[34:04] and he had
[34:10] and if the lord grants us the life and
[34:12] opportunity
[34:15] we will like to speak that on a little
[34:17] bit more as the days go
[34:30] i want you young people to really really
[34:32] focus on the word
[34:36] because this this really uh really
[34:38] struck me
[34:40] he had to be obedient he had to be
[34:44] subject
[34:45] and to be under authority
[34:49] wait a minute now the son of god
[34:53] jesus christ he had to be subject
[34:56] he had to be obedient he had to be under
[35:00] authority
[35:14] jesus had to be subject
[35:18] had to be obedient
[35:21] himself to joseph and mary
[35:24] jose maria now now you might say brother
[35:27] i don't i don't agree with that
[35:41] when joseph said jesus juan jose dijo
[35:44] jesus clean up after your room uh limpy
[35:46] put your shoes where they need to be at
[35:48] guard
[35:50] you can tell so you're going to tell me
[35:52] jesus said no i'm not going to put my
[35:53] shoes where they need to be at
[35:56] is
[36:07] go fetch me some firewood he had to do
[36:10] it
[36:36] because the enemy is really giving us a
[36:38] really good
[37:30] in obedience to the father in obedience
[37:33] i'm gonna repeat that one more time
[37:36] jesus
[37:37] had to get baptized he was baptized in
[37:41] obedience to the father
[37:44] walk back out to the banks
[37:47] and the heavens was opened
[37:58] so even christ had to be baptized
[38:02] now why did christ had to be baptized
[38:07] because the word says you must be
[38:09] baptized
[38:11] he had to fulfill the scriptures
[38:14] he had to go through a process
[38:20] brother branham says in the message the
[38:22] resurrection of jairus daughter
[38:25] restoration 1954.
[38:29] 18.
[38:44] moving from
[38:59] who who haven't been here honestly we've
[39:02] been speaking a little bit of demonology
[39:06] and you might think well brother are you
[39:07] still speaking about that
[39:11] we're still speaking about demonology
[39:27] he was always busy about the father's
[39:29] business
[39:34] he was very he was a very humble son
[39:40] i noticed every word that the prophet
[39:41] says
[39:43] he was a very elera
[39:46] it was a little bit it was very you know
[39:50] humble um
[39:59] don't answer me you you'd say that to
[40:00] the lord you talked that to yourself
[40:04] it was very a very humble son
[40:07] in and obedience even to death
[40:12] he was obedient even to death
[40:17] amen now brother brown i'm going to skip
[40:19] a little paragraph here
[40:22] and it says but he went over there at
[40:24] the cry of
[40:25] one person
[40:29] talking about he crossed the seas to go
[40:31] see that maniac
[40:35] now for the ones who weren't here last
[40:36] time
[40:38] [Music]
[40:46] he said he went over there of the cry of
[40:49] one
[40:49] person
[41:10] perhaps he was a good man one time
[41:14] wow perhaps a good man one time
[41:31] and just like abraham walked up right
[41:33] before the lord yes
[41:40] but but probably got in the wrong crowd
[41:46] you
[43:10] when i see a gray-headed [ __ ]
[43:14] that's a woman who's gone through a lot
[43:16] of stuff
[43:18] the scripture says somewhere in proverbs
[43:21] because these are you forgive me if i'm
[43:22] wrong but you're gonna miss him okay
[43:24] that's like a crown corona when i see an
[43:27] old great head mother
[43:29] i say that woman has been through a lot
[43:31] evi
[43:33] jesus crossed the sea jesus christ all
[43:36] the way over in the gadara hashtag
[44:35] 8 we see a couple verses before
[44:39] jesus runs into a roman soldier jesus
[44:44] and that's in matthew 8 5.
[44:47] and this roman soldiers need
[44:53] is that his servant was sick
[44:56] and and and brother branham says uh this
[44:58] is
[44:59] that he didn't do these things to show
[45:02] his authority
[45:15] which was spoken by isaiah as the
[45:17] prophet
[45:20] himself took our infirmities
[45:26] he's fulfilling the scripture he didn't
[45:30] do these things to display his authority
[45:36] but to fulfill the scriptures now this
[45:39] roman soldier appeared or came to jesus
[45:43] jesus and he said lord my servant lie at
[45:47] home sick
[45:49] grievously tormented jesus said i will
[45:53] come and heal him
[45:56] and verse 8 says the satarian answered
[46:40] i want to break it down for you real
[46:41] quick
[46:43] this soldier is the soldado at authority
[46:47] he says lord i'm not worthy for you to
[46:49] come because
[46:51] because i know authority
[46:54] you have
[47:08] do this i
[47:11] don't have to go and check if he does it
[47:13] nothing okay
[47:15] i don't have to go and check i have to
[47:16] tell him two or three times for him to
[47:18] do it
[47:21] for authorities
[47:36] because you have
[47:49] you don't have to go tell them one or
[47:50] two three times to leave nothing else
[47:55] under authority speak to her
[48:00] page last time we were here
[48:03] ultimately
[48:33] amen i remember i
[48:36] just just just going sidetrack a little
[48:38] bit
[48:40] back home in casa i have uncle who has
[48:43] down syndrome
[48:46] sometimes i'm they're
[49:00] another voice spoke to me he said well
[49:03] he's the only one who says amen
[49:08] so i said okay keep saying amen
[49:12] he's then verse nine excuse me verse 10.
[49:15] yes
[49:16] when jesus heard it jesus when he heard
[49:19] this man
[49:20] say i don't need you to come here
[49:25] jesus marveled jesus
[49:28] he
[49:39] that's why we're still speaking even
[49:41] though we have a different title
[49:42] anki
[50:11] us
[50:15] faith is faith to be under authority
[50:19] because brother branham says in the
[50:22] church authority
[51:20] to be under
[51:34] before you had it has to be under
[51:36] authority
[51:39] when i was a lot younger
[51:42] 1716 somewhere around there
[51:47] and i i began to preach and i helped the
[51:49] ministers and so forth
[51:54] oh i have authority
[51:58] i'm the man and uh so anyways that
[52:01] started getting into my head
[52:05] got the word i got the message i know
[52:07] the order
[52:09] you think i have authority
[52:13] and i go to my home and i start telling
[52:16] you you do this
[52:58] then you will be able to reign and the
[53:00] lord gives us life
[53:03] we want to speak about reigning
[53:06] and that really bursts my bubble yes
[53:12] it just deflated me medicine flow it
[53:14] just got me
[53:16] tumble i thought i had authority
[53:19] but i knew the message and i knew this
[53:21] you know more messages than my mom and
[53:22] my dad
[53:24] yesterday madrid
[53:40] was
[53:54] and
[54:21] and you can base this on any way you
[54:23] want yes
[54:26] in the business
[54:30] whatever you like imagine me telling my
[54:33] boss what to do
[54:36] you need to come this
[55:23] samuel the scripture that we read
[55:26] on the 15th chapter in the capital it
[55:29] says it says
[55:30] has the lord hath great delight in birth
[55:32] offerings and sacrifice
[55:39] and obeying the voice of the lord
[55:43] where does it delight anymore
[55:47] and offerings and sacrifices
[55:50] or obeying the voice of the lord
[55:54] behold you say oh notice behold he says
[55:57] like a great revelation revelations
[56:02] you know you don't say the word behold
[56:04] unless you're going to like
[56:05] show something
[56:10] to obey they say better than sacrifice
[56:14] sacrificing
[57:25] notice he's he's not he's not telling
[57:27] okay be obedient
[57:30] but do i have a mediocre job and just
[57:33] kind of do it like that
[57:36] fear and trembling
[57:54] if you're going to be a barber do it
[57:56] like you're going to do it for christ
[58:00] i'm going to do it for this guy don't do
[58:04] it with all your heart that's
[58:34] outside the church
[58:37] i'm going to i'm going to please the men
[58:40] please brother johnny
[58:42] we can put me to preach a little bit
[58:43] more i'm going to
[58:45] do it like this so they can see me
[59:02] but as the servants of christ
[59:06] doing the will of god
[59:10] from the heart with god with good will
[59:13] excuse me with good will doing service
[59:32] to in order to have fulfillment of his
[59:34] authority
[59:37] first samuel 15 23.
[59:41] for those that don't think paraquas
[59:44] canopy and said obedience

[1:01:19] believe that
[1:02:14] there's a difference between sinners and

[1:02:18] difference entrepreneur
[1:03:30] i'm good right where i'm at right here
[1:03:33] i'm good
[1:03:34] aqui is your being and you have to go
[1:03:37] through the process
[1:03:52] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:03:55] the lord
[1:04:22] you reject the word of the lord
