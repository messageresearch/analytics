and he's been uh he's been trying to get me sick for about a couple weeks i got to the point i said man i had sinus allergies and just wasn't feeling good i said well lord i'm going to get a test a covid test on monday and if i come back positive that means you don't want me to speak this friday so significant so i got i'm able to speak to you guys a little bit about what the lord is doing how he's been moving in our lives how he continues to move in our lives how every day is going to be a battle for you but that's what we're here for for we're we're in a battle i'm going to read a quote before as you're standing here and then we'll read a couple scriptures and i'll you guys can take your seat we'll pray and get started this is out of the the unity of one god and one church it says god's kingdom is not of this earth god's kingdom is in our hearts is and the kingdom of god is within you did you see what it said it said but not without violence have we had a little violence in our lives that's the kingdom i want to read out of luke it's 12 32 if you want to turn with it it's a very simple scripture and the other one we'll be reading is john 3 3 but we're going to read luke first luke says fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom says jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be bored jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except the man be born of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god he's telling them well you got to go and you ought to be born again heavenly father father celestial i want to thank you for allowing me to be here this evening for always being with me lord no matter what situation i'm in independence but i didn't understand your plan that you had for me i asked you heavenly father that you would allow us to see your plan this evening your plan is a simple plan it's a life-changing plan it'll allow you to see the world differently [Music] it'll help you to withstand the anxiety of life the oppression of this world and we ask that you would be with me this evening lord move me aside allow me to say the things that you've done for me lord permit we ask all these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated amen if i could title this little little message here i'm going to title it he wants to give you the kingdom what is the kingdom what do you feel is the kingdom is it a lot of money farmer prosperity that's what man sees and as we start reading the quotes that brother branham is speaking about in the message the unity of one god in one church you'll see that god always has a plan in which he created the ultimate plan for us but then the devil also has a plan to pervert god's plan and you've got to be careful what plan you're following us because it's so deceiving the brother said it would deceive the very elect if it were possible so we're going to start reading we're going to read the quotes and we're going to try to get you guys out of here sooner rather than later amen and all the and all the time these things are going on the spirit of the living god is striving with flesh trying to get man away from his own achievements trying to get man away from his own selfish motives and objectives to a plan which god has laid down and as long as man works on his own plan he will be a failure and man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective and the right motive and that's the according to god's plan for him yes conformed any other foundation fundamentals kind of forgot what my motive here on this earth was i'm going to go out i'm going to get this great job i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and i'm going to do this and before you that's why i didn't before understand the need of fellowship the fellowship of what the right kind of people correct people of like faith that's why we come together and we enjoy time with each other because just like that message our brother spoke i see hermano the sheep come together to keep warm decay las vegas and now i understand what brother branham said education is you got to stay away from it a little bit it's not that it's bad if you're not careful you'll get winded up in it without says god does not force man to do anything he says you want to go do something gotta let you do it brother branham says in this message uh this is that people can be uh working on the wrong plan but if they come together in unity he can warn you you can throw a bear crate across your path but you walk your own self with your own decisions in his presence to make him your savior this is what he says brother please says but satan has perverted god's plan to his own presence i'm going to read these quotes and i wish i could just play it for you but since i can't play it and i'm not savvy enough where i could do it i'm going to read it uh those so-called meetings today and they are great meetings but it only works on the intellectual part of man man gets under a spell of a revival and he says yes i accept christ and he does it intellectually because he's in a crowd he does it because there's a great minister before him but it's only an intellectual conception but a conception intellectual that man can never go on he's got to come from his mind to his heart and be born again he'll never be able to stand the test keep that in mind is telling us here how to be successful in our lives videos just like the intellectual man asked as peter what what should i do intellectually peter said repent he baptized all unrighteousness is only righteousness perverted a lie is only the truth turned around good thing that god does wrong things is good things perverted so therefore that unrighteousness is righteousness perverted satan justice create anything himself he only has to take what god has created to pervert it a man living with his wife absolutely right but take another woman that that's the same act is perverted and it's that's the way that all the things that satan has got in his reach is did you ever think of the u.n and brother branham's mentioning here how this is satan's eden and when i began speaking i said the devil's going to constantly be fighting you el diablo and it says now trying to make all the nations one great brotherhood under satan controls all the nations the scripture says that satan is the ruler of the earth listen to this this is so tremendous what it says here next president he says when he's he taken jesus up into high exceeding mountains and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and he said these are mine jesus did not say they wasn't jesus and brother branham says says for they are. that's the reason we have wars and killing is because that these kingdoms of the world are controlled by the devil can you foreign now why this a son of god struggle so much do you understand now why when you decide to give your heart to the lord jesus christ why the devil is going to come after you with full attack this is not our world that's the reason brother brandon preached message like the oddball pores that's why brother branham tells us and he's telling us that don't live in this world foreign he's telling us to find a secret hiding place there's always two powers working in this world and lately i've been obsessed with the triune beings understanding ourselves how we're still living in this flesh but god built a compartment way deep down in our heart for himself let's continue god's working here satan is working here so what does god what good does this does this big schools and seminars do anyhow and does and listen what he says here you know the scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so he is brother branham goes on to explain this for about a year for about four years ago science found out that the human heart there was a thinking faculty uh la cincia de escubrio de que en el corazon del we're talking about science here science proof is proving that i a little compartment in the human heart it isn't in the animal no i stand in the animal or no other life but in the human heart there is a little place and they can they never could come to conclusion what it was but finally they said this in his heart so he is not in his head if god would have meant head say it again if god would have meant head he would have said he would tells him moses take off your shoes imagine if moses would have said shoes and the sign of the sign of respect is many times brother brandon if you don't have the holy spirit you're going to do things that you shouldn't arrest because the devil's always going to point you to this point so there's two powers always fighting the devil points you to this el diablo you have the elders come and pray for you tina the devil's always pointing us to what man can see el diablo and always god is always pointing us to what man believes in his heart satan's intellectual con conception is all right but remember when the eye looks upon it the devil uses your eye el diablo in the garden of eden it proved that the devil chose the head of man to work in uh diablo but god chooses his heart the devil shows him with his eyes something that he can see is believing that's what satan tells us and on the other end let's see what god tells us but when god comes to man he comes to his heart and he lets him believe things by his heart through faith the evidence of things not seen the devil's always trying to use our own head against us remember what you did last week he's always trying to get us to think opposite of what god is trying to show us in our hearts a lot use [Music] those dirty thoughts that come to your mind you shouldn't be thinking that you wouldn't be thinking that if you had the holy ghost be careful what we're uh what were voices we're listening to we'll see things with our eyes but our take what he can see with his eyes see i believe in every every person's life god is going to ask us what decision are you making you came you gave your you you said you surrendered your heart to the lord jesus christ amen at the beginning i mentioned he wants to give you the kingdom and in the message in the unity of one god in one church as sincere as i can i believe the lord jesus christ has the ability to change your whole entire world if you're in a situation brother branham said he told us he said he'll put barricades in the way this is we'll give you warnings we're going to try to tell you don't go that way go this way he says then why did god make that little place you can't be a human being without being filled the time has come where you are forced to make a decision and this is in 58. yes old people los angeles middle-aged people uh i believe god's asking us to make a decision because if you're not watching to what plan you're following to be important important wanting to be somebody brother branham is telling us here aquinos is that you're going to be filled with something um when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man and when he comes back with seven other devils diablos more worse than he was and the last state of the man is eight times worse than what it was at the beginning for people that grew up in the message we brother branham says and this is really hard this is and i'm sorry but i just i'm all i can do is repeat what brother branham said i've heard a minister get up with charts the scripture says all that didn't receive the seal of god had the mark of the beast there's only two classes on the earth exist in those that's what the scripture said so you're forced to make a decision a decision i hear brother brandon's message message and i hear him one time say he says i know you're tired of hearing it this talking about being born again and how you cannot see the kingdom unless you're born again and he's telling the people and he's saying i know you're tired of live your life like if the lord would be coming today for him we had a funeral here for him akita [Music] i got baptized this year maybe i'll give my heart a surrender everything to the lord next year be careful because you may not get there jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it spiritual revelation revelation spiritual spiritual conception conception your poor hearts may be running over with doubt he i hope your your hearts may be full of fred mickey mouse first preacher um well if my dad was a mickey mouse wanna see me papyrus what am i but i am coming to you antos who's been in battles and has stood in the trenches i'm telling you that the lord jesus christ can transform your life is i'm david you simply say yo i told my daughter the other day everybody talks about david with the sling and killing goliath and putting on the armor of saul and going out and facing the philistines but nobody talks about david the adulterer nobody talks about david the murderer just like david had to pay the price for what he did i believe that every son of god will have to pay the price for what they have done but david story did it in there the lord bless so every son of god that's here this evening god will let you do what you want to do be careful because you might hurt yourself because there's going to come a day or question it took me a lot of years to find a resting place i don't know how much time i have left it took me a lot of time to understand what god was doing in my life i made a mistake after mistake and that i was going to give my heart to the lord jesus christ not only was i going to give my heart to the lord jesus christ if you want god to change your life you can change your life he can make you a new person talk about changing your character hablando de cambianos character yeah even your character if you're a person that's lazy sierra's flojo and you don't just don't have the energy to get up god will change that in you they'll start making you want to work for the lord brother branham says oh brother it pays to know where you got an escape this is the shelter is under the wings of the lord's everlasting protection or with hydrogen el mismo and he gives it to you hey man i'm in brother branham says do you see the man of branham you take somebody that can't control his temper [Music] and give it over to god and let the spirit of the living god and down into his heart and he'll call every word of god the truth you won't have to worry about what's happening on the outside he works with he works with you when the nature of the spirit of the devil is in there and every man born on the earth to the world speaking lies that's right so in that carnal a atomic nature how can man achieve anything christ takes his throne in the human heart then life looks different different perspective then he starts on a new road from his own selfish motives so the big idea of make himself something big he starts right towards calvary to recognize god why don't we just stay home have some family time staying home and having family time bad casuals but it wasn't her life anymore when someone conduct accepts the lord jesus christ in their hearts in that little compartment jesus christ begins to sit in the control room your character to character you become a whole different person then after that what what are you supposed to do why do we come why why do we dress the way we dress up why when a sister porque condo when she's been born again of the spirit of the lord jesus christ why does she not want to show herself anymore why does she cover herself up as a christian como cristiano why can't i go do the same things that i used to do porque he was always the son of god but he was the last son of god until he made a decision what did he have to do [Music] that he wanted to serve the lord jesus christ so if you feel something in your heart you're a son of god [Music] [Music] these signs shall follow some of them the scripture says it says no shall follow them all of them what do you think we come up here we have the elders pray for somebody [Music] amen i'm in [Music] i'm so tired of hearing people people say the holy spirit is and in that message brother branham says in his preaching in 1958 the holy spirit is not real not unreal in the sense where you're going to come to church and lift your hands clap your hands but they say it's not real because it can't change your life i'm a witness it'll change your life it'll make you do different things and it's a continual change yes god will correct you you do something wrong i'm gonna correct you he's gonna make you make it right hey man i'm going to read one more quote since there's so many people today who say the holy spirit is not real today but the working of the holy spirit the kingdom of god in you god sits on the throne of your heart [Music] [Music] when he comes and tells you you're not a son of god i am a son of and he changes your carnal nature into his nature [Music] then in this you become a new creation in christ you just wake up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do you want to be one with the lord jesus christ wherever you're at if you're listening on the internet do you want to be one with the lord jesus christ all you have to do is make a decision so as we pray if you bow your heads see in klingons right where you're at are you understanding i'm i'm doing this with you don't think that i'm because i'm up here i'm above you sorry superior i'm praying just the same way you are lord i want a closer walk with you i want to stop looking at the
