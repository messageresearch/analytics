[52:19] Heavenly Father we come to you this
[52:21] morning
[52:22] because you are the author of life
[52:26] you saw us and yourself
[52:29] even before the foundation of the world
[52:32] and after the foundation of the world
[52:36] and after everything is all finished
[52:38] we'll also be with you Lord
[52:49] that we may be able to enter that Holy
[52:52] Union with the Holy Spirit
[52:55] you see if somebody this morning
[52:59] hasn't taken their decision to accept it
[53:02] perhaps somebody this morning
[53:06] it's struggling to have faith
[53:10] may you be able to give them the oil
[53:12] this morning
[53:14] and you'll be able to anoint them in
[53:16] their hearts
[53:18] so that they can have the plenty of
[53:21] Faith
[53:22] to believe that God will do it
[53:25] [Music]
[53:30] we commend ourselves into your hands ome
[53:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:36] amen amen
[53:42] as you're standing there we're going to
[53:44] read one scripture
[53:48] it's in Jeremiah 32.
[53:51] verses 6 through 14.
[54:04] and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord
[54:07] came unto me saying
[54:16] he says behold and the son of Shalom
[54:19] thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying
[54:21] by thee my field that is
[54:25] for the right of redemption is dying to
[54:28] buy it
[54:30] foreign
[54:49] according to the word of the Lord and
[54:51] said unto me by my field I pray thee
[54:54] that is in anat which is the country of
[54:57] Benjamin for the right of the heritage
[54:59] is thine and the Redemption is thine by
[55:02] it for thyself then I knew that this was
[55:05] the word of the Lord
[55:13] and I brought to the field of Hannah
[55:15] mill on my uncle's son that was in
[55:18] anatoth and weighed him the money even
[55:21] 17 shekels of silver is
[55:29] and I subscribed the evidence and I
[55:32] sealed it and I took Witnesses and
[55:33] weighed him the money and the balances
[55:41] so I took the evidence of purchase both
[55:44] which was sealed according to the law
[55:46] and custom and which was open
[56:01] and they gave the evidence and the
[56:03] purchase unto the Baruch the son of
[56:05] naraya the son of messiah in the sight
[56:07] of hanamel mine's uncle's son and in the
[56:10] presence of the witness and subscribed
[56:12] the book of the purchase before all the
[56:13] Jews that sat in the court of the prison
[56:18] and Charles broke before them saying
[56:27] yes
[56:32] and thus the Lord hosts God of Israel
[56:35] take these evidences the evidence of the
[56:38] purchase both which is sealed and this
[56:40] evidence which is open and put them on
[56:42] the unearthing vessel them they may
[56:45] continue many days
[56:49] God bless his word you may take your
[56:51] seat
[57:00] [Music]
[57:20] because I really feel what God has for
[57:22] you this morning
[57:24] perhaps but if somebody's needing this
[57:26] morning
[57:29] we understand that Jeremiah
[57:32] he bought a property uh
[57:38] and he placed the documents
[57:40] [Music]
[57:41] and he put it in a vase of clay
[57:48] and it had two parts
[57:56] instruction is
[57:59] in the Gabriel's instructions to Daniel
[58:03] and then we see this the
[58:05] Scrolls
[58:08] he said we see the Scrolls how the
[58:10] scroll was handed in his hands
[58:13] how in Jeremiah and Jeremiah 32 6
[58:16] Supremo animel his cousin
[58:19] had left him an inheritance
[58:22] and they were entering into captivity
[58:26] and we were going into it and with it
[58:29] this morning
[58:32] and it was kept in an Earthly vessel de
[58:36] dios shows were the power of God
[58:40] and the Scrolls and the secrets of gods
[58:42] are known in the heart in El Corazon in
[58:44] the heart
[58:46] our Plan of Redemption
[58:50] our plan we've led to the same being
[58:52] kept in Earthly vessels
[58:55] in Jesus name and the revelations
[58:59] we've touched on this topic in the past
[59:02] when we talked about the rainbows and
[59:06] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[59:08] upon top thereof this is
[59:11] we we're just we what we just read is
[59:14] this here
[59:16] verse three this is
[59:23] two olive trees buy it upon the right
[59:26] side of the bowl and on the upon the
[59:28] left side thereof
[59:30] uh
[59:33] we see that Jeremiah had the documents
[1:00:00] can go up to heaven
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:24] because they're up there is
[1:00:28] so if you were able to identify us
[1:00:32] that the open part is here on Earth
[1:00:39] because not everybody can go up to the
[1:00:42] skies
[1:00:43] that's up there in the sky the same
[1:00:48] you saw the seven Church ages because he
[1:00:52] was here on Earth
[1:00:54] but after that
[1:00:58] go see what was in disguise
[1:01:03] not everybody can go up to the sky Jesus
[1:01:07] not everybody's gonna accept Jesus as
[1:01:10] their savior
[1:01:11] see this open part effect
[1:01:15] can benefit
[1:01:17] the Believers
[1:01:21] and the unbelievers
[1:01:23] foreign
[1:02:19] and believers
[1:02:21] but
[1:02:25] these here as they are on the earth
[1:02:29] contaminados can be contaminated by
[1:02:32] unbelievers
[1:02:34] just like the first and second pool
[1:02:38] brother Brandon was rejected by the
[1:02:41] Angels
[1:02:45] because he showed all the other
[1:02:47] ministers how to use the first and
[1:02:49] second pool
[1:02:51] according to the second pool
[1:02:54] is
[1:02:58] it won't be a public Affair or a
[1:03:01] spectacular show a public show
[1:03:04] because
[1:03:08] the first and second have an annoyment
[1:03:11] they have oil pero foreign
[1:03:16] because the people who are using their
[1:03:18] their uh
[1:03:20] anointing
[1:03:23] to bring the attention of the people
[1:03:26] so they could have more money at their
[1:03:28] church
[1:03:30] more people
[1:03:42] to grab the people's attention
[1:03:45] but not for the church
[1:03:48] for himself
[1:04:03] is the close part
[1:04:08] in Zacharias in Zechariah
[1:04:13] we see that this candle stick
[1:04:16] is
[1:04:20] two trees one on each side
[1:04:25] we've just showed you
[1:04:28] is that this Candlestick is here on
[1:04:33] Earth amen amen
[1:04:37] and has it being here on the Earth
[1:04:41] the oil can be perverted foreign
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:06:32] the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:00] It Is Burning Brightly because it has
[1:07:02] plenty of oil
[1:07:07] which is getting from the two olive
[1:07:09] trees
[1:07:12] so the oil that would come upon this is
[1:07:17] from the olives that were in the olive
[1:07:20] trees
[1:07:21] but I like it being here on the earth
[1:07:26] it can be touched by unbelievers
[1:07:29] people that don't believe the original
[1:07:33] continues to say this is
[1:07:37] the two trees represent the old and the
[1:07:39] New Testament
[1:07:43] and of course the oil type advised the
[1:07:45] Holy Ghost
[1:07:49] which alone can give the light to the
[1:07:52] people
[1:07:55] so the angel who spoke to Zechariah was
[1:07:58] saying as much as saying
[1:08:07] this is what you see means the church
[1:08:10] cannot accomplish anything by its own my
[1:08:13] or power but by the Holy Ghost
[1:08:17] how can we help people to be healed
[1:08:51] as you pervert the teaching of the Holy
[1:08:54] Spirit
[1:08:55] you limit the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:58] me as a minister if I get up here
[1:09:01] and I say God no longer heals
[1:09:05] well if you say in your heart while the
[1:09:07] minister said it
[1:09:08] well then I believe that he don't heal
[1:09:11] me
[1:09:12] I'm limiting your faith in the Holy
[1:09:16] Spirit
[1:09:17] if I tell you that the Lord still heals
[1:09:26] that God will heal you
[1:09:30] that's what happened in the seven
[1:09:32] churches
[1:09:35] because it's here on Earth
[1:09:40] not everybody here on the Earth are
[1:09:42] believers
[1:09:44] alvazo
[1:09:53] perdon is
[1:09:58] now you examine this lamp stand
[1:10:01] you will notice that this has a large
[1:10:03] bowl
[1:10:05] parallel
[1:10:07] it's a reservoir that is the central to
[1:10:09] seven arms that come out of it is
[1:10:17] this bowl is filled with olive oil which
[1:10:19] flows through the seven Wicked Wicks
[1:10:22] which are placed in the seven arms
[1:10:30] it is the same oil that burns and makes
[1:10:33] the lights at the end of the seven pipes
[1:10:36] this light never went out Los Angeles
[1:10:41] the priest just kept pouring oil into
[1:10:44] the bowl we said
[1:10:47] since the lamp was lit in a special way
[1:10:52] says first the priest would take fire
[1:10:54] from the sacred altar
[1:10:56] originally foreign
[1:11:25] and so on until the seven lamps were
[1:11:28] burning
[1:11:29] this Holy Fire from the altar Que Paso
[1:11:32] de lampara lampara being passed from Lab
[1:11:35] to land
[1:11:38] it's a wonderful type of the holy spirit
[1:11:41] in the seven Church ages
[1:11:44] the original outpouring on Pentecost
[1:11:50] which outpouring came directly from the
[1:11:52] Jesus from Jesus on The Mercy Seat is
[1:11:59] enduring in his church throughout the
[1:12:01] seven Church ages
[1:12:06] and showing forth perfectly that Jesus
[1:12:08] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:12:10] forever
[1:12:11] the never-changing god
[1:12:14] in his Essence and his ways
[1:12:19] here Brothers
[1:12:23] how the oil can be contaminated is
[1:12:27] paragraph 36. in San Juan Quince and
[1:12:30] John 15 Jesus
[1:12:33] Jesus said I am the vine and you're the
[1:12:36] branches
[1:12:39] remember there are two trees there with
[1:12:41] this Candlestick
[1:12:42] tree has branches
[1:13:00] now the vine does not bear fruit but the
[1:13:03] branches that do it this is
[1:13:06] now watch this
[1:13:12] says you can take a citrus tree in such
[1:13:15] an orange tree
[1:13:19] as a citrus tree in Orange Street
[1:13:27] and you could take a limb a lemon tree a
[1:13:30] tangelo limb and other kinds of
[1:13:31] varieties
[1:13:33] and all those limbs will grow
[1:13:37] the original tree is an orange tree
[1:13:43] but there are trees that are grafted
[1:13:48] branches that are grafted
[1:13:51] that are not oranges but they're similar
[1:13:57] there's two spirits El de Cristo Jesus
[1:14:01] Christ of the Antichrist is
[1:14:04] and there are two similar Spirits
[1:14:09] just like the original tree is an orange
[1:14:14] but you can put a branch of a of a
[1:14:18] grapefruit a grapefruit
[1:14:20] and they're very similar
[1:14:23] let's continue reading
[1:14:27] this is
[1:14:34] get those limbs that will be thriving
[1:14:36] off the life of the tree
[1:14:41] but if that tree ever puts forth another
[1:14:43] branch of itself
[1:14:47] it will be an orange branch and it will
[1:14:49] bear oranges
[1:14:55] because the life of the lamb and the of
[1:14:58] the life in the trunk are identical
[1:15:01] embargo Northwest
[1:15:04] where it was it wasn't so with the
[1:15:06] grafted limbs is
[1:15:12] those grafted branches had their Source
[1:15:15] on other kinds of life from there
[1:15:19] seeds
[1:15:22] or they will bear fruit right all right
[1:15:24] but
[1:15:25] it won't be oranges
[1:15:30] they cannot because they are not the
[1:15:33] original
[1:15:34] that's the way the church is
[1:15:38] the vine has been split and limbs have
[1:15:40] been grafted in
[1:15:42] they have grafted Baptist limbs
[1:15:46] Presbyterian respiratory
[1:15:49] and Pentecostal Limbs
[1:15:53] and limbs are bearing Baptists
[1:15:58] Pentecostals Presbyterians
[1:16:04] denominational seeds from which they
[1:16:06] have produced their fruits
[1:16:09] but if the vine ever brings forth
[1:16:12] another brand
[1:16:13] it'll be it'll be of itself
[1:16:17] it'll be the same kind
[1:16:21] that was brought forth at Pentecost
[1:16:24] we will speak in tongues
[1:16:30] and power and science of the resurrected
[1:16:33] Jesus in it
[1:16:38] because it's thriving on the natural
[1:16:41] resources of the vine itself
[1:16:44] you see it wasn't grafted into the vine
[1:16:48] it was born in Dubai
[1:16:52] when those other branches were grafted
[1:16:54] in
[1:16:58] all they could do was Bear their own
[1:17:00] fruit before they were not born of the
[1:17:02] vine is
[1:17:05] they don't know know about the original
[1:17:08] life and the original Fruit
[1:17:11] they cannot know for they were not born
[1:17:13] in it
[1:17:18] but if they had been born of it in the
[1:17:20] same life that was in the original stem
[1:17:22] Jesus
[1:17:24] Jesus would have come through them
[1:17:27] and manifested through them
[1:17:35] foreign
[1:17:37] we see that the key is
[1:17:42] this has two trees that's here on Earth
[1:17:45] yes
[1:17:47] and the oil that's of the candlesticks
[1:17:50] comes from the trees
[1:17:52] but there's other people
[1:17:56] that graft other branches into that tree
[1:18:01] and they use the life of that tree
[1:18:04] fruto to produce its own fruits
[1:18:07] that's how the denominations today do it
[1:18:12] they come with their own ideas of the
[1:18:14] Bible
[1:18:16] and they use the power of the holy
[1:18:18] spirit
[1:18:21] because the rain falls under Justin the
[1:18:23] unjust us
[1:18:26] they use the anointing of the Holy
[1:18:28] Spirit
[1:18:29] and they produce their own fruit
[1:18:32] s with their false teachings
[1:18:38] this is the limit the power of the holy
[1:18:41] spirit that is in the Bible
[1:18:44] it's a denominational anointing foreign
[1:18:53] but it's a perverted one
[1:18:58] adios
[1:19:10] um let's skip that one I'm building it
[1:19:12] okay
[1:19:14] unveiling God they say
[1:19:16] all right
[1:19:18] there's three offices that Jesus Christ
[1:19:20] had and this is
[1:19:23] paragraph 76 78 68 sorry we said
[1:19:29] notice now he came as a prophet yes
[1:19:37] he came as the son of man this place
[1:19:42] after the Holy Spirit came
[1:19:45] he said he was then the Son of God God
[1:19:49] is a spirit
[1:19:50] he was the Holy Spirit Son of God
[1:19:57] he lived through the church ages as Son
[1:20:00] of God
[1:20:02] this is now in the Millennium he'll be
[1:20:05] son of David
[1:20:06] sitting upon the throne of his father
[1:20:09] David
[1:20:10] he is the son of David
[1:20:20] they
[1:20:22] took out the oil
[1:20:24] is
[1:20:31] he said he would be revealed again as
[1:20:33] son of man
[1:20:35] the prophet
[1:20:38] fulfilling the rest of it is
[1:20:49] it's been bailed through these ages
[1:20:53] according to what God Said
[1:20:56] and it will be open in the last days
[1:21:00] those Seven Seals will be broke
[1:21:05] and the full thing would come into the
[1:21:07] view of the people
[1:21:09] it takes place all along
[1:21:13] the seventh angel message
[1:21:19] this is all the mysteries of God should
[1:21:21] be known in the Elijah is
[1:21:24] this last hour is how the crisis put out
[1:21:29] of his church the Son of God
[1:21:33] how he is revealed as a son of man again
[1:21:37] there's two offices that I want to focus
[1:21:40] myself with
[1:21:41] one is the Son of God
[1:21:45] but the balances that goes to the seven
[1:21:47] Church ages
[1:21:53] that symbolizes a prophetic message
[1:21:59] but in the seven churches
[1:22:03] those two offices they have anointings
[1:22:12] but the anointing of the seven churches
[1:22:15] is
[1:22:17] a Priestly anointing
[1:22:47] that is superior to that anointing
[1:22:51] that is the anointing of the prophets
[1:22:55] that is a prophetic anointing
[1:23:00] this can be contaminated
[1:23:03] because they're people that are not
[1:23:05] faithful to the word yes
[1:23:07] and it's subject to the word Earth
[1:23:13] showed us last week
[1:23:16] you can go up to the skies
[1:23:20] not only is
[1:23:23] but you're also Eagles
[1:23:27] so you have access
[1:23:31] to that other oil
[1:23:57] only the Eagles can
[1:24:58] not
[1:25:02] contaminated Olympia something clean
[1:25:07] but this one is subject to the Earth
[1:25:11] you want to go on a Rapture though we
[1:25:14] need another oil
[1:25:21] this is half of a circle
[1:25:25] another oil
[1:25:26] to go up either
[1:25:28] three
[1:25:45] this is
[1:25:47] first Samuel 3-3 this is
[1:25:56] an air the lamp of God went out in the
[1:25:59] temple of the Lord where the arbor God
[1:26:00] was and Samuel was laid down to sleep
[1:26:06] you can see that the lamp was there
[1:26:10] and says before it all went out
[1:26:13] there was Samuel
[1:26:17] the prophet
[1:26:19] is
[1:26:25] we're lit by the priests
[1:26:29] this is a priest anointing
[1:26:33] prophetic but there's another prophetic
[1:26:36] anointing
[1:26:37] verse
[1:26:41] he said here's the Lord It's called
[1:26:43] Samuel and he said here I am
[1:26:47] three times God called Samuel says
[1:26:50] it's like three times God used
[1:26:54] first second and third pool is
[1:27:06] and he ran unto Ali and he said here I
[1:27:09] am for thou has called me and he said I
[1:27:11] called not lie down again and he went
[1:27:13] and lay down
[1:27:25] and the Lord called yet again Samuel and
[1:27:28] Samuel arose and went to Italy and said
[1:27:30] here I am for thou this called me and he
[1:27:33] answered I called not my son lie down
[1:27:35] again
[1:27:39] now Samuel did not yet know the Lord
[1:27:42] neither was the word of the Lord yet
[1:27:44] revealed unto him
[1:27:48] and said the Lord called Samuel again
[1:27:50] the third time
[1:27:56] and he said he he said here I am for The
[1:27:58] Outfits call me
[1:28:02] and Ali perceived that the Lord had
[1:28:05] called the child
[1:28:08] therefore
[1:28:13] he said go lie down if it shall be if
[1:28:16] you call thee Thou shalt say Speak Lord
[1:28:20] is
[1:28:22] and
[1:28:30] the Lord came and stood called at the
[1:28:32] other time Samuel Samuel then Samuel
[1:28:34] answered speak for thy servant hear it
[1:28:54] there's a transition
[1:29:06] we had a prophet
[1:29:11] verse 12. this is
[1:29:19] in that day I will perform against all
[1:29:22] things which I have spoken concerning
[1:29:24] his house when I begin I will also make
[1:29:26] an
[1:29:31] endos
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] for I will have him and I will judge his
[1:29:39] house for every forever for the iniquity
[1:29:42] which he had known it because his sons
[1:29:43] made themselves vile and he restrained
[1:29:46] them not is
[1:29:50] a Priestly oil
[1:29:53] Paul was a priest
[1:29:57] continues Anton
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:18] they left what was original
[1:30:23] God was going to judge them
[1:30:28] verse 14. this important
[1:30:35] sacrifices he says therefore I have
[1:30:38] sworn unto the house of Eli the iniquity
[1:30:41] of Eli's house shall not be purged with
[1:30:43] sacrifice nor offering forever
[1:30:51] and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh
[1:30:53] for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel
[1:30:55] and Shiloh by the word of the Lord
[1:30:58] is a place
[1:31:06] and they went and crossed over into the
[1:31:09] promised land
[1:31:11] what does that signify to enter into the
[1:31:13] promises
[1:31:15] enter into the promise of the baptism of
[1:31:17] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:19] after that
[1:31:23] rebellious children
[1:31:27] did not subject themselves to
[1:31:44] that place was a place of blessings
[1:31:48] of different types of people would come
[1:31:50] to that place because that's where the
[1:31:52] Tabernacle was
[1:31:54] what the ark was
[1:31:57] because of the sin of the people dios
[1:31:59] Maldives
[1:32:01] God cursed that place
[1:32:58] El Pueblo I said Phil and Los felices
[1:33:03] the Philistines had come
[1:33:06] on they killed these two people okay
[1:33:12] what are these boys
[1:33:15] her wife that was pregnant
[1:33:18] in verse
[1:33:20] 19. you said
[1:33:26] Italian foreign
[1:33:43] and Phineas are dead and the Ark of God
[1:33:47] is taken yeah
[1:33:59] and it came to Pastor when he mentioned
[1:34:01] the Ark of God that he had fell off the
[1:34:03] seat backwards by the side of the gate
[1:34:05] and his neck broke and he died and he
[1:34:08] was an old man and heavy and he had
[1:34:10] judged Israel 40 years and
[1:34:17] now his Hope was not no longer in the
[1:34:20] priesthood
[1:34:21] our hope is no longer here in the
[1:34:25] denomination
[1:34:27] the hope of the people of Israel
[1:34:30] was not in the priesthood anymore
[1:34:33] he was in the prophet Samuel our hope is
[1:34:42] nominations
[1:34:43] are these denominations today
[1:34:47] it's in the message that the prophet
[1:34:49] brought us
[1:34:51] foreign
[1:35:11] to be delivered and when she heard the
[1:35:13] Titan titans of the Ark of God was taken
[1:35:16] and her father-in-law her husband were
[1:35:18] dead she bowed herself and traveled for
[1:35:20] her pains Came Upon her yeah
[1:35:29] and about the time of her death the
[1:35:31] woman that stood by her said unto fear
[1:35:33] fear not for thou has borne a son but
[1:35:35] she answered not neither did she regard
[1:35:37] it
[1:35:38] is
[1:35:48] and she named the child Ichabod saying
[1:35:50] the glory from Israel because the Ark of
[1:35:52] God was taken and because her
[1:35:54] father-in-law and her husband is
[1:36:00] and he said the glory is departed from
[1:36:02] Israel for the Ark of God is taken
[1:36:05] said the name
[1:36:07] in English as it says in English
[1:36:12] the glory of God is departed from this
[1:36:14] place The Silo from Shiloh
[1:36:17] foreign
[1:36:52] suicidad
[1:37:03] it says and to send all these dirty
[1:37:05] filthy things and fashion things to even
[1:37:07] foreign countries come here to pick up
[1:37:09] our filth and send it away

[1:37:32] the wrath of God is belching right
[1:37:34] beneath
[1:37:40] how much longer he will hold this
[1:37:43] Sandbar hanging out over that cuando
[1:37:45] Luciano
[1:37:49] this is when the ocean a mile deep will
[1:37:53] slide in there Plumbing back to the

[1:37:56] Ultimo Dia de pompea it'll be worse in
[1:37:59] the last day of Pompeii Los Angeles
[1:38:03] Christ
[1:38:29] let the people shake themselves tonight
[1:38:32] and flee from the raft that is to come
[1:38:36] because
[1:38:41] Road over the doors and over the Nations
[1:39:31] was lit
[1:39:33] foreign
[1:40:02] the spirit of God is grieved away from
[1:40:04] it
[1:40:22] repeated itself again with drunken
[1:40:25] parties half dressed women calling
[1:40:27] themselves Christians
[1:40:29] you see what happened to Shiloh
[1:40:32] Los Angeles it's going to happen to Los
[1:40:34] Angeles
[1:40:45] there's a prophecy Babylonia against
[1:40:48] Babylon
[1:40:50] it says this an apocalypse is in
[1:40:53] Revelations 18 21.
[1:41:09] like a great milestone and casted in the
[1:41:13] sea saying thus with violence thou shall
[1:41:15] great City Babylon be thrown down and
[1:41:17] shall be found no more at all
[1:41:20] how many know that that took place in
[1:41:23] the time of brother Branham
[1:41:25] 1964 in Tucson in Tucson he picks up a
[1:41:30] rock
[1:41:31] he tells the rest of the brothers that
[1:41:34] are with him
[1:41:35] he says
[1:41:38] because you're about to see God's glory
[1:41:40] and he throws the rock
[1:41:43] there comes a whirlwind
[1:42:02] so he could tell them what that signify

[1:42:45] found any more in thee and the sound of
[1:42:47] Milestone shall be heard no more at all
[1:42:49] indeed
[1:42:51] actors
[1:43:02] all kinds of entertainment
[1:43:05] a lot of artists muchos a lot of
[1:43:08] musicians muchos a lot of actors being
[1:43:11] in they come from there is the Hollywood
[1:43:13] because that's where Hollywood is
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:58] and that's exactly California
[1:44:09] this is in the light of a candle shall
[1:44:12] no more shine at all indeed in Los
[1:44:14] Angeles because in Los Angeles is
[1:44:18] where the seventh Candlestick was lit we
[1:44:21] said
[1:44:23] the voice of the bridegroom and the
[1:44:26] bride shall no longer be heard no more
[1:44:35] for the merchants for the Great Men of
[1:44:37] the earth and for thy sorceries were all
[1:44:39] nations deceived yes okay
[1:44:43] and that's the problem just said in the
[1:44:46] message choosing of a bride
[1:44:48] let's go
[1:44:51] okay
[1:44:54] let's go to Revelations 4.
[1:45:01] yeah
[1:45:02] we're gonna skip that
[1:45:06] it's right there okay
[1:45:10] we just showed
[1:45:13] that this oil is this Candlestick
[1:45:17] can be perverted because it's here on
[1:45:20] Earth
[1:45:26] and they pervert the original message
[1:45:31] to pervert the message
[1:45:34] you limit the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:45:38] but if you show it exactly the same way
[1:45:41] the way the messenger showed it
[1:45:45] because the message received it from God
[1:45:49] you have the Seven original candlesticks
[1:45:57] but you still are subject to the Earth
[1:46:00] because this Candlestick is here on
[1:46:02] Earth
[1:46:03] we want to go in a Rapture
[1:46:06] because this oil is
[1:46:10] going to help you here on Earth
[1:46:14] it's an oil limited to time
[1:46:33] of the ego
[1:46:51] is a prophet
[1:46:55] is
[1:46:56] the anointing ego anointing is
[1:47:01] for all the age
[1:47:03] for the Believers
[1:47:06] those that will not pervert the original
[1:47:08] light
[1:47:29] it's in the tapes
[1:47:31] foreign
[1:48:07] Stone and he was there rainbow round
[1:48:10] about the throne and the sight like an
[1:48:12] old Emerald
[1:48:16] you see the the aspect of the rainbow
[1:48:20] is
[1:48:22] emeralda Emerald this is
[1:48:25] the color of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:31] the rainbow was a complete rainbow
[1:48:34] it was a complete circle
[1:48:36] in other words
[1:48:40] because the Eternal is without beginning
[1:48:42] Without End
[1:48:56] the heavens and the Earth
[1:48:58] that's the same oil
[1:49:02] this is
[1:49:05] the color of the Holy Spirit which is a
[1:49:09] green yellow
[1:49:11] say that
[1:49:13] this is the color of the pillar of fire
[1:49:16] is about green a greenish yellow color
[1:49:19] which is Emerald or Amber
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:31] reservoir of oil
[1:49:34] without beginning or Without End
[1:49:40] aura
[1:49:42] is
[1:49:45] given to us in this day
[1:49:47] cuando when
[1:49:51] when the seals were open
[1:49:54] as the seals were open
[1:49:56] the oil was released
[1:49:59] right now it's something that's in your
[1:50:01] heart
[1:50:03] right now in your heart you could have
[1:50:05] the two Graces
[1:50:14] where are you going to find it only in
[1:50:17] this message
[1:50:19] because only in this message
[1:50:22] shows all of the words
[1:50:25] and it's fullness
[1:50:34] but it is perverted
[1:50:39] don't let them deceive you
[1:50:42] by the appearance
[1:50:45] just because they have oil
[1:50:49] you should listen to a message of
[1:50:51] brother Brandon peaches
[1:50:53] the anointed ones in the end time
[1:51:00] see we have a clean oil pure
[1:51:30] is a complete circle
[1:51:46] to them
[1:51:52] this message
[1:51:55] has the eternal
[1:51:57] light oil
[1:52:04] that allows you to believe every word in
[1:52:07] the Bible
[1:52:09] it was in apocalypses yes in Revelations
[1:52:12] 10
[1:52:13] is where that oil comes I'm going to
[1:52:16] show it to you okay do you say be this
[1:52:18] and there is
[1:52:19] it and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:52:22] down from heaven
[1:52:24] no we're here physically
[1:52:27] in the seventh Church
[1:52:30] the seventh Church ages already
[1:52:32] condemned
[1:52:33] but we have the light
[1:52:36] of the eighth age
[1:52:55] because these seven are Earthly
[1:53:00] it has to come from the heavens
[1:53:05] because the Eternal oil is in the
[1:53:07] heavens
[1:53:09] so who is the eighth messenger it's this
[1:53:13] Cloud here nobody else
[1:53:17] nobody else will give you the oil that
[1:53:19] you need it only comes from this Cloud
[1:53:23] This Cloud is
[1:53:25] our eighth messenger not any man
[1:53:30] yeah amen
[1:53:34] verse two this is
[1:53:41] and he had in his hand a little book and
[1:53:44] he said it right foot on the sea and his
[1:53:46] left foot on the earth
[1:53:49] we see in verse
[1:53:56] it's the same book that we just read in
[1:53:58] Jeremiah has a part that's open that's a
[1:54:02] part that's still
[1:54:19] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[1:54:22] the heavens
[1:54:24] it says the Grace Covenant Grace
[1:54:28] Covenant
[1:54:31] says when you make a
[1:54:33] covenanto you have to do I swear oh
[1:54:38] gotta have an oath
[1:55:05] there has to be a second oh
[1:55:08] yes
[1:55:14] go ahead and he swear by him that liveth
[1:55:16] forever and ever
[1:55:19] you created the Heaven and things
[1:55:22] and the Earth
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:30] that there should be time no longer
[1:55:34] after the seven lights
[1:55:40] a complete circle
[1:55:42] without beginning Without End
[1:55:54] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:55:57] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:55:59] sound the mystery of God shall be
[1:56:01] finished and he has declared to his
[1:56:02] servants the prophets
[1:56:05] he said that the time would be no more
[1:56:07] symbolism
[1:56:09] symbolizing that he was entering into
[1:56:11] eternity
[1:56:13] but in the 70 he says but in the days
[1:56:16] because it's an eternal message
[1:56:21] comes to a place to people that are
[1:56:23] still in time
[1:56:25] what are the teachings
[1:56:30] according to the eighth is symbolizes
[1:56:35] eternity
[1:56:40] it's in the future the future home
[1:56:45] but we're going to read it in paragraph
[1:56:48] to 20.
[1:56:51] 219 Nissan
[1:56:55] you see there's no such thing as eight
[1:56:58] days
[1:57:01] so you go back to the first day again
[1:57:03] see the first day movie
[1:57:06] see the old past and all seven days past
[1:57:09] Jesus
[1:57:11] Jesus raised on the eighth day
[1:57:14] it was a solemn day in order
[1:57:19] and it wasn't there because the day and
[1:57:21] time it had run out
[1:57:23] they passed into eternity see
[1:57:29] Nuevo they swung right back to the first
[1:57:31] day again see
[1:57:35] eternity is like a ring
[1:57:39] you can't find the corner to it
[1:57:43] you can't find no Stompy place to it see
[1:57:47] this message
[1:57:48] of this cloud is eternal is is a
[1:57:54] noise
[1:57:56] there's no such thing as eight days in a
[1:57:58] week
[1:58:01] what does eight mean
[1:58:04] it takes you back to the first day
[1:58:08] you literally go back to the first day
[1:58:10] Los primeros versus go back to the first
[1:58:13] verses of the Bible
[1:58:15] in Genesis 1 1 you say
[1:58:19] dios Los Cielos he says in the beginning
[1:58:23] God created the heavens and the Earth
[1:58:29] by the one that made the heavens and the
[1:58:31] Earth
[1:58:36] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:58:38] and the Earth
[1:58:41] and it said the Earth was that without
[1:58:43] form and void is
[1:58:51] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:58:54] the waters
[1:58:56] and God said let there be light and
[1:58:58] there was light
[1:59:00] and God saw that the light was good
[1:59:04] God divided the light from the darkness
[1:59:06] you
[1:59:34] and there was life
[1:59:36] foreign
[2:00:48] eternal
[2:01:06] according to the spoken word
[2:01:10] says
[2:01:12] is
[2:01:15] exactly to the scriptures
[2:01:32] that was in the first day
[2:02:03] that it's possible in their lives
[2:02:08] I'm going to close with this
[2:02:13] when he speaks about sister Hattie
[2:02:15] Wright
[2:02:16] it says the message my new ministry
[2:02:21] in paragraph 179
[2:02:25] it says and that's super anointing
[2:02:29] it swept over me
[2:02:34] tell Harry that she found Grace in the
[2:02:37] sight of God while Gracia what Grace
[2:02:41] the grace that was
[2:02:47] we can have faith
[2:03:04] by this gift into existence
[2:03:09] speak it into existence
[2:03:19] now I'm sure you all could see what it
[2:03:22] is
[2:03:25] it's a coming of a greater deepen
[2:03:28] anointing
[2:03:29] of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:31] how do you get into it I don't know
[2:03:35] the only thing that I know
[2:03:39] it takes God to put you into it
[2:03:45] so you just live sweet and humble
[2:03:49] and as close to God as you can don't
[2:03:53] doubt it
[2:03:56] just believe that everything is working
[2:03:58] just to the good I want to say this
[2:04:04] I guess I wonder why you got up and
[2:04:06] walked out of the house as quick as I
[2:04:07] did
[2:04:13] I have been with 30 000 heathens were
[2:04:16] saved at one time Africa South Africa
[2:04:18] they come to Christ
[2:04:24] I thought that was the greatest
[2:04:26] anointing that I had ever felt is
[2:04:33] compare what happened down at George
[2:04:35] Wright the other day
[2:04:38] I've never felt anything like that
[2:04:44] the whole room just seemed to be just
[2:04:46] the light of the glory of God
[2:05:05] there was only two kids that were saved
[2:05:10] but the other oil
[2:05:13] was a Priestly
[2:05:16] this is eternal oil it's the same oil
[2:05:21] it's the same oil
[2:05:24] used in the beginning
[2:05:30] through the spoken word foreign
[2:05:41] but it's only for mature
[2:05:44] people that believe
[2:05:45] if you don't believe you're limiting
[2:05:48] yourself if you believe dios
[2:05:53] they will allow you to use that power
[2:05:57] because God's uh the god already knew
[2:06:00] okay
[2:06:02] would ask for the right thing
[2:06:04] he even tempted her a little bit you
[2:06:07] want some money
[2:06:11] but she asked for the right thing
[2:06:15] because she was a mature person madures
[2:06:21] it was required
[2:06:24] for that oil
[2:06:29] would you please stand
[2:06:39] we are in the eighth age
[2:06:50] Celestial oil
[2:06:52] Eternal oil
[2:07:01] [Music]

[2:08:19] involves the man that's been going to be
[2:08:21] Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:22] Christ
