[1:08:33] end verse 38 and verse 39.
[1:08:46] now the just shall live by faith
[1:09:31] us we are not of them who draw back onto
[1:09:34] perdition
[1:09:38] we're not of them who's going to turn
[1:09:39] our back and go to sin nosotros
[1:09:45] that are going to backslide and go in
[1:09:46] reverse
[1:09:50] but be of them that believe to the
[1:09:53] saving of the souls
[1:09:58] we have believers here this morning
[1:10:01] we're going to need believers this
[1:10:02] morning
[1:10:05] for where we're going this morning
[1:10:09] now i see a lot of people here that have
[1:10:11] tasted in one way or another of the
[1:10:13] presence of god
[1:10:14] personal
[1:10:18] they've been in the presence of god's
[1:10:20] glory at some point in their life
[1:10:25] felt his touch they've partaken of the
[1:10:27] grace that he gives
[1:10:40] and now our younger children the younger
[1:10:42] generation they're gonna
[1:10:56] these young sisters from my generation
[1:10:58] they're out their haircut and makeup on
[1:11:05] some of them the young brothers out in
[1:11:07] the club out in the
[1:11:09] bars cantina
[1:11:12] some are living a pretty good life with
[1:11:13] their high paying career and their good
[1:11:15] lifestyle
[1:11:20] and and some have even gotten to the
[1:11:22] point to call this message a lie yeah
[1:11:37] these brothers and sisters that we love
[1:11:41] but i think something had to have
[1:11:43] happened along the way
[1:11:48] something that hit them that hurt them
[1:11:50] that damaged
[1:11:52] them many times it's something that we
[1:11:55] see or something that we hear
[1:11:59] that that caused them to take this very
[1:12:01] same word
[1:12:05] the same word that saved them
[1:12:08] that brought them to their knees
[1:12:12] took them to the waters of baptism
[1:12:16] and for them to count it at one point in
[1:12:18] their life worthy
[1:12:20] of
[1:12:22] by the lifestyle the way they're living
[1:12:24] today they're counting this is unworthy
[1:12:32] like it was just an emotion or a
[1:12:33] sensation it's unworthy comoxinomas
[1:12:37] i don't know maybe they found out our
[1:12:39] prophet wasn't perfect
[1:12:43] maybe they said oops i just found out
[1:12:44] the pastor's not perfect
[1:12:48] the minister's
[1:13:10] well you know what it's better you might
[1:13:11] as well go out
[1:13:14] you come back next sunday
[1:13:15] proximo domingo when you're ready to
[1:13:17] hear jesus not the man
[1:13:21] where he can be the one that can speak
[1:13:23] to you this morning
[1:13:27] i don't want to be mean
[1:13:30] but let's read from the message be not
[1:13:32] afraid
[1:13:36] uh paragraph 51
[1:13:39] and it says that's all it needs
[1:13:43] not so man to say well glory to god
[1:13:45] brother so-and-so laid hands on me
[1:13:51] i felt something go right through me
[1:13:55] you might have felt his hands laying his
[1:13:56] hands on you
[1:14:12] did you feel it
[1:14:46] i've known that i felt some strange
[1:14:48] feelings
[1:14:51] but i never did rest my faith upon that
[1:14:53] feeling
[1:15:08] i've got to build it upon
[1:15:11] okay
[1:15:12] thus saith the lord by the word of god
[1:15:18] not upon a sensation
[1:15:20] not upon a feeling
[1:15:35] my flesh is driven by sensations
[1:15:40] and my flesh is imperfect
[1:15:43] so so if you want to cast some stones at
[1:15:45] me today
[1:15:48] you can go ahead
[1:15:50] i really don't care about this flesh
[1:15:53] because this body to me it's no good
[1:15:57] this is from this corrupted soil of this
[1:15:59] earth
[1:16:02] it's been hybrid it does me no good
[1:16:17] there's a body that i'm waiting for
[1:16:58] and i used to work out on the railroad
[1:16:59] he says
[1:17:00] you anticipate
[1:17:02] and we would load in a boxcar these
[1:17:04] different things
[1:17:06] different
[1:17:07] but the inspector comes around first
[1:17:11] and it's got to it and it's got to go
[1:17:13] over a lot of rough roads
[1:17:17] that train is going to go downhill
[1:17:19] sometimes
[1:17:22] that train sometimes is going to go on
[1:17:24] windy roads
[1:17:27] sometimes on these rough bumpy roads
[1:17:31] and he says if there's anything loose he
[1:17:34] will not seal it
[1:17:39] if there's something moving around in
[1:17:40] that box car the inspector will not seal
[1:17:42] it shut
[1:17:47] he says until that car is loaded and
[1:17:49] compact till nothing can shake it says
[1:18:10] sanctification into the new birth of
[1:18:12] justification
[1:18:15] where there ain't no wind of doctrine
[1:18:17] that's going to shake you left or right
[1:18:24] there's no strange voice that's going to
[1:18:25] shake that box car in your life
[1:18:30] because you know what you're tied down
[1:18:32] to
[1:18:33] a question
[1:18:34] you know what's locked inside of your
[1:18:36] boxcar muster
[1:18:40] and that's the unadulterated word of the
[1:18:41] lord
[1:18:44] brother branham says then he closes the
[1:18:46] door and he seals it
[1:18:50] and it cannot be broken until it's at
[1:18:52] its destination
[1:18:56] i want you to keep that in mind until
[1:18:58] it's at the destination
[1:19:03] what is that destination
[1:19:06] god's got to give the approval
[1:19:09] he's got to check your boxcar
[1:19:12] and inspect it thoroughly
[1:19:16] not like like i'll just say like i've
[1:19:18] been uh
[1:19:20] when i used to work when i was young
[1:19:24] and i used to sell shoes
[1:19:26] and i'd have to check the the back room
[1:19:28] where all the shoes were
[1:19:30] uh
[1:19:32] and the shipments of shoes would come in
[1:19:33] these big old boxes
[1:19:37] and i had to check them off to make sure
[1:19:39] they were there
[1:19:41] but i would just open it up and two
[1:19:43] threes oh okay they're okay it's good
[1:19:47] no this inspector no is the inspector
[1:19:50] the lord jesus christ himself
[1:19:52] he's going to take measurements of that
[1:19:54] boxcar
[1:19:56] he's going to check every corner in that
[1:19:58] box
[1:20:01] and he's going to make sure it's nice
[1:20:02] and secure
[1:20:06] before he can put that seal and send it
[1:20:08] off to its destination
[1:20:13] says in the message the resurrection
[1:20:14] this is
[1:20:17] god comes around and finds a lot of
[1:20:19] foolishness in us
[1:20:24] he didn't say foolishness in me
[1:20:28] in him
[1:20:30] but in us
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:56] truth you'll ever find in your life
[1:21:10] you might believe god's holy word this
[1:21:12] morning
[1:21:26] with the full
[1:21:40] but when we've once got packed in
[1:21:45] god's spirit the right way
[1:21:48] and you become a child of god
[1:21:52] then the door is closed and the seals
[1:21:54] put on that door
[1:22:01] and that door cannot be open until the
[1:22:03] destination
[1:22:07] once you're sealed
[1:22:13] he put that seal on himself
[1:22:16] so that seal is good till you get to the
[1:22:18] destination
[1:22:22] he says that works destined to be
[1:22:26] we're sealed by the holy ghost until the
[1:22:29] day of our redemption
[1:22:34] is that not the scripture that we read
[1:22:48] until the day of our redemption
[1:22:52] but your box car but
[1:22:55] my box car amiibo one it doesn't depend
[1:22:57] on the box car in front of me of the
[1:22:59] boxcar behind me no depending
[1:23:02] on
[1:23:02] you know i got caught in glendale the
[1:23:04] other day
[1:23:07] uh when we were going to take care of
[1:23:08] some matters from my grandmother's
[1:23:10] funeral es almost
[1:23:13] and we got caught behind the tree or we
[1:23:15] got caught at the train tracks
[1:23:19] and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:23:21] and hundreds of boxcars kept passing by
[1:23:25] one link to the other uno
[1:23:29] but they're not dependent upon one
[1:23:30] another to go forward
[1:23:43] you know there's somebody there doing
[1:23:45] something at the front of the training
[1:23:59] there's an evangelist pushing the
[1:24:00] buttons of that train
[1:24:04] there's a pastor watching the tracks of
[1:24:06] that train
[1:24:09] there's a teacher in communication with
[1:24:11] the stations for that training
[1:24:16] there's a fivefold ministry working to
[1:24:19] get that train to the rapture
[1:24:24] that ministry doing its job to get us to
[1:24:27] our destinations
[1:24:31] there's a conductor there's an engineer
[1:24:33] there's an operator that has to move
[1:24:34] that train conductor
[1:24:39] but without an engine in that train
[1:24:44] it's like the worst is the blind leading
[1:24:45] the blinds
[1:24:48] if the train don't got an engine
[1:24:52] i don't care what conductor and engineer
[1:24:53] and operator you've got no important
[1:24:56] conductor
[1:25:09] it's that holy spirit that seals us
[1:25:13] it's that holy spirit that pulls us
[1:25:17] and it's that holy spirit that's going
[1:25:18] to take us into the rapture yes
[1:25:23] no i i was thinking of the prodigal son
[1:25:25] uh yo pence
[1:25:26] prodigal and it might be a little
[1:25:28] different
[1:25:30] different but i thought of the father
[1:25:32] the king
[1:25:34] and and the prodigal son that went off
[1:25:36] in the world
[1:25:39] and i see prodigal sons and daughters
[1:25:40] here this morning
[1:25:43] and you know when he was on his way back
[1:25:46] and and the father the king daddy the
[1:25:48] king he was so happy and emotional
[1:25:52] he started giving orders episodes
[1:25:55] and he wasn't giving orders to just
[1:25:56] anybody
[1:25:59] to to to primo and theo and nico and to
[1:26:03] cousin uncle son daughter no no no he
[1:26:06] started giving orders to the servants
[1:26:11] that fivefold ministry are servants of
[1:26:13] god
[1:26:16] that are here to serve the sons and
[1:26:18] daughters of
[1:26:21] and god king that father said hey hey
[1:26:24] servant go kill that cow
[1:26:26] es padres
[1:26:29] oh jose is coming back
[1:26:31] he told the other servant hey go get the
[1:26:33] royal garments
[1:26:48] and prepare the feast because my son and
[1:26:50] daughter are coming back
[1:26:55] he was giving orders to that fivefold
[1:26:57] ministry for his sons and daughters
[1:27:02] because their
[1:27:16] and this word found you worthy yes
[1:27:21] therefore you're worthy of the finest
[1:27:23] god has to offer entonces
[1:27:28] you know you can't even be linked onto
[1:27:30] that train
[1:27:34] uh unless you've been inspected
[1:27:37] unless you've been approved
[1:27:39] for a problem you've been sealed by god
[1:27:43] because we kept saying that it's got a
[1:27:45] destination
[1:27:48] and there's only one destination for
[1:27:50] this train
[1:27:53] that's to the rapture
[1:27:55] that's to that eternal security
[1:27:58] that's
[1:28:09] and it's not going to take a single box
[1:28:11] car with it
[1:28:23] i don't know what train you're going to
[1:28:24] leave on this morning
[1:29:06] this ministry that ministry the other
[1:29:08] ministry
[1:29:36] because i gave up my name
[1:29:40] i gave up my nature
[1:29:42] i gave up my rights for his rights
[1:29:49] i was hearing a small uh uh
[1:30:05] and i'm assuming he's talking to the
[1:30:07] congregation
[1:30:10] he says what's my name
[1:30:13] and he says
[1:30:14] religion garcia
[1:30:17] garcia and then he says no listen says
[1:30:20] you and he starts expressing
[1:30:24] the person gets caught with their hand
[1:30:26] in the cookie jar
[1:30:29] and like they did something
[1:30:32] they got caught when your hand's in the
[1:30:33] cookie jar
[1:30:35] and brother bernie says and the person
[1:30:36] covers themselves with religion
[1:30:43] he says in other words they cover
[1:30:44] themselves with bernabeu garcia
[1:30:59] garcia told me to do this and told me to
[1:31:01] do that
[1:31:04] brother bernie says
[1:31:07] if that person is wise or prudent
[1:31:12] they would know that brother bernabeu
[1:31:14] garcia
[1:31:27] so when i heard these words
[1:31:30] they impacted me
[1:31:33] and you know we all make mistakes
[1:31:37] the pastor told me to do this so you
[1:31:38] know i i
[1:31:40] i did this and el paso
[1:31:42] is the preacher approached me and told
[1:31:45] me it's better if i do this
[1:31:52] and the sister advised me to do this and
[1:31:54] the brother said this the church said do
[1:31:56] this so that's why i do that
[1:31:59] the word says
[1:32:01] let every man's word be alive but mine
[1:32:04] be true
[1:32:08] and so i went on a trip
[1:32:15] when he was led by the spirit to be to
[1:32:17] be tested
[1:32:21] i took notice that satan spoke the word
[1:32:24] me
[1:32:27] i hope i don't sound crazy today
[1:32:30] but satan got a little bit smarter than
[1:32:33] how he was with eve in the beginning
[1:32:38] you know in the beginning he quoted the
[1:32:40] word in the principle
[1:32:43] but he twisted the word
[1:32:45] added to the word
[1:32:47] when he was back then with eve
[1:32:50] before the presence of the son of god
[1:32:55] he was a little more slick
[1:32:58] but still a coward
[1:33:00] because he had to approach him in a time
[1:33:01] of weakness
[1:33:05] when he was
[1:33:06] fasting but he was smart
[1:33:09] he was slick yeah
[1:33:11] and he quoted the word exactly as it's
[1:33:14] written
[1:33:20] but
[1:33:31] so the word says try the spirits to see
[1:33:34] if they are of god
[1:33:38] and the word also says
[1:33:41] to worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:33:46] now the spirit in satan
[1:33:48] satan
[1:33:58] he first came to jesus and challenged
[1:34:00] him
[1:34:03] then he came and quoted psalms 91 word
[1:34:05] for word to him
[1:34:10] and it didn't work so then he tempted
[1:34:12] him
[1:34:14] he spoke the word and he spoke just the
[1:34:16] truth
[1:34:20] but from the beginning he's always had
[1:34:22] the wrong spirit
[1:34:27] but jesus replied
[1:34:30] with the right spirit and the truth
[1:34:34] and when you come to service
[1:34:36] you that's here this morning
[1:34:39] anyone watching online this morning
[1:34:42] you just simply being here that's only
[1:34:44] half the job
[1:34:48] you know you come and you write down the
[1:34:50] quote
[1:34:52] you bring out your notepad and you write
[1:34:54] down the scriptures
[1:34:57] and you you you hear a word that strikes
[1:35:00] you you said oh you know
[1:35:02] impact so you write it down
[1:35:04] but then you hear a word
[1:35:07] that sounds uncertain
[1:35:10] you also write that down
[1:35:19] and cross check it with the words
[1:35:23] to make sure that it was in spirit and
[1:35:24] in truth
[1:35:26] foreign
[1:35:38] amen to the message service after
[1:35:39] service after service
[1:36:32] is obedience to the words
[1:36:36] can we say that this morning
[1:36:38] obedience to the word obedience
[1:36:42] we've all made mistakes
[1:36:45] that's why we're here
[1:36:47] to ask for forgiveness
[1:36:49] to confess our sins so let them know our
[1:36:52] lord i did do wrong
[1:36:56] can you forgive me and make me white as
[1:36:58] snow again
[1:37:02] but brother and sister we're already
[1:37:03] under the blood but
[1:37:24] we got that conviction to ask for
[1:37:26] forgiveness
[1:37:29] not only to the lord no mental senor but
[1:37:31] to our brother
[1:37:44] maybe you covered yourself in religion
[1:37:55] maybe you've covered yourself in johnny
[1:37:57] alvarado religion
[1:38:00] alvarado
[1:38:11] jose branham maybe it's your first time
[1:38:13] here today he says
[1:38:28] church
[1:38:31] and if we're not careful we'll get
[1:38:32] caught up in the message church religion
[1:38:39] there's no religion that's going to seal
[1:38:41] that boxcar no
[1:39:04] he's the one that will steal your
[1:39:05] railcar your boxcar
[1:39:10] and and just think about this
[1:39:13] you know we've got preachers
[1:39:16] the church has preachers
[1:39:19] domination message all any christian
[1:39:21] church has preachers denominations
[1:39:26] and a preacher is preaching
[1:39:29] because he's got the gift of preaching
[1:39:33] he don't even need to have an experience
[1:39:35] to have the gift of preaching
[1:39:38] experience
[1:39:51] and rappers and political figures and
[1:39:54] activists
[1:39:58] people that are really good preachers
[1:40:03] they can attract the masses
[1:40:06] and we've got some of those preachers in
[1:40:08] the church as well
[1:40:12] and unfortunately
[1:40:14] some of those preachers
[1:40:16] don't even have the holy ghost
[1:40:20] but they know how to preach
[1:40:36] the gift to preach
[1:40:39] it's there
[1:40:41] whether you're saved or not
[1:40:44] god don't give you the gift of being a
[1:40:47] witness
[1:40:51] you've got to become a witness
[1:40:55] what god needs in his church
[1:40:58] what god needs in here today
[1:41:02] is
[1:41:02] witnesses witnesses true and faithful
[1:41:05] witnesses
[1:41:08] a church with people in it
[1:41:11] a church with members in it
[1:41:14] bench warmers that can be real witnesses
[1:41:20] because they've come in contact with the
[1:41:22] living god
[1:41:25] they've heard a voice one day
[1:41:28] they believed in a sign one day
[1:42:06] those are real witnesses
[1:42:10] those are those that can say amen to the
[1:42:12] words
[1:42:24] as i was talking to brother manuel in
[1:42:26] the back
[1:42:28] and i was explaining a little bit about
[1:42:30] the message
[1:42:32] he was telling me
[1:42:34] he's a brother
[1:42:36] hermano i preached the same thing on
[1:42:37] friday
[1:42:39] i said praise god then i don't feel that
[1:42:41] bad this morning
[1:42:44] because we're not just the preachers
[1:42:46] standing up here
[1:42:49] when we look at real faithful witnesses
[1:42:52] in the audience
[1:43:21] you're preaching back to the ministers
[1:43:37] but it says if the shoe fits is uh
[1:43:41] you know
[1:43:41] if the shoe fits i'm sorry
[1:43:45] it's not a bad thing no salgo
[1:43:47] but if the shoe fits
[1:43:50] what you going to do about it
[1:43:54] so remember
[1:43:56] i ring back to what brother eli preached
[1:43:58] a long time ago
[1:44:02] how condemnation is not
[1:44:04] forgive me condemnation is for the world
[1:44:09] not for the believers
[1:44:11] not for the sake
[1:44:13] but correction is for the believer
[1:44:17] correction is for the same
[1:44:26] but because i'm still in this flesh that
[1:44:28] you can cast stones
[1:44:33] i need a little bit of correction
[1:44:37] well you know my home
[1:44:39] it's so hard for me to keep it in line
[1:44:44] well if the shoe fits
[1:44:47] you know
[1:44:48] i try to keep my kids in line and i
[1:44:50] thought i was bringing them to church
[1:44:51] and that's enough
[1:44:56] if the shoe fits
[1:44:58] you know my attitude that brother he
[1:45:00] makes me so mad and i try to be nice to
[1:45:02] him
[1:45:07] well if the shoe fits
[1:45:11] lord give me the correction that i need
[1:45:13] correction
[1:45:14] and we all we all read our bibles in
[1:45:16] here
[1:45:18] and and since we read our bibles
[1:45:21] the word says
[1:45:23] that love is condemning
[1:45:27] love is
[1:45:40] get inspired and have to preach these
[1:45:41] rough things
[1:45:58] and
[1:45:58] to all the brothers and sisters watching
[1:46:00] online
[1:46:04] even myself from the living room back in
[1:46:06] san diego
[1:46:07] party ayanna
[1:46:09] san diego sometimes he would say a
[1:46:11] couple of things
[1:46:14] that i just had it was just
[1:46:16] uncomfortable for me
[1:46:20] it wasn't like a little small prison
[1:46:21] knife
[1:46:27] but it was like a greek sword from back
[1:46:29] there that goes in and out
[1:46:35] and it's because of what the preacher is
[1:46:37] saying
[1:46:52] why does he gotta
[1:46:56] you know maybe you're saying on the
[1:46:57] inside
[1:47:01] can you just give the preacher the love
[1:47:03] that i need so that i can i can change
[1:47:05] my life
[1:47:10] lord can you just give the pastor the
[1:47:12] love that i need to hear so i can i can
[1:47:14] understand this word
[1:47:34] give
[1:47:47] so correction comes with the little bit
[1:47:49] of whooping cough
[1:47:54] does it come with a little bit of
[1:47:55] whooping vienne
[1:47:57] i was whooped from phoenix to san diego
[1:47:59] the phoenix san diego medal
[1:48:01] some sundays i'm whooped in here
[1:48:05] but
[1:48:06] i'm not the one doing the whooping
[1:48:08] coil
[1:48:10] the the pastor is not the one doing the
[1:48:11] whoopings
[1:48:14] the teacher evangelist whoever is not
[1:48:16] doing the whooping
[1:48:43] it's daddy that does the whoopings
[1:48:57] that he took a beating so far
[1:49:02] not not moses that our brothers preached
[1:49:05] to us
[1:49:08] who killed the egyptians
[1:49:11] but a different brother
[1:49:24] he was so jealous and passionate of the
[1:49:26] revelation that he carries
[1:49:30] this conviction that burned inside is
[1:49:32] the conviction
[1:49:34] that he started off with the little
[1:49:36] beating okay
[1:49:38] but he ended up killing his brother
[1:50:07] with this tongue
[1:50:14] unfortunately we have killed one another
[1:50:20] but we need to be very careful
[1:50:31] because it's so easy to kill and condemn
[1:50:34] your brother and sister
[1:50:49] came through him
[1:51:03] day in and day out
[1:51:19] as a brother
[1:51:21] i don't want to be king to you
[1:51:25] and i hope you don't want to be kane to
[1:51:26] your brother's sister
[1:51:32] i know of another brother
[1:51:34] hermano and he and his brother
[1:51:38] they shared the same father
[1:51:42] we shared the same father right
[1:51:45] they heard the same word
[1:51:48] they sat in the same church
[1:51:52] and that brother's name was jacob
[1:51:57] and the promise
[1:51:59] the birthright
[1:52:00] gift
[1:52:04] but jacob knew that his brother didn't
[1:52:05] care for that birthright
[1:52:10] he didn't care for the holy ghost
[1:52:13] he didn't care for his salvation
[1:52:29] we're not waiting for the last family to
[1:52:30] get in no estamos espresso
[1:52:33] ultima family we're waiting for the last
[1:52:35] individual to come in
[1:52:39] that means it's an individual affair
[1:52:41] with god
[1:52:55] and if i've got to be like a brother in
[1:52:57] the bible
[1:53:00] maybe it sounds bad
[1:53:02] but matthew chapter 10 says
[1:53:06] jesus was speaking
[1:53:08] and he gives a warning
[1:53:25] ye wise as serpents
[1:53:29] but harmless as doves
[1:53:33] so maybe it's time this morning
[1:53:37] to take on the garment of the scriptures
[1:53:42] to put on the character of our brother
[1:53:46] of our brother jacob
[1:53:49] no
[1:53:50] brother hermano i i watch how you've
[1:53:52] been and how you act
[1:53:57] i'm kind of like you
[1:53:59] sorry
[1:54:00] you know i'm one foot in and one foot
[1:54:02] out
[1:54:03] you know
[1:54:04] but if you don't want the new birth
[1:54:21] but i've been waiting in line
[1:54:24] and if you don't want salvation
[1:54:27] well get out the way because i'm gonna
[1:54:29] claim it
[1:54:31] you don't want the token this morning
[1:55:02] somebody that's met the person of the
[1:55:04] holy ghost
[1:55:07] someone that knows him
[1:55:09] someone has felt him let's talk to him
[1:55:12] somebody that can say man because he
[1:55:14] changed my life
[1:55:18] that is the amen of the faithful witness
[1:55:23] behold i send you the prophet elijah
[1:55:27] amen amen unless a man is born again he
[1:55:30] cannot see the kingdom
[1:55:33] amen i'm in i must go yo
[1:55:36] but i will send you the comforter
[1:55:39] that he may be with you
[1:55:42] and even in you
[1:55:45] the church needs witnesses
[1:55:50] you close your eyes
[1:55:52] men and women
