[Music] [Music] me amen amen i believe that's the prayer of each and every heart today amen speak my lord yes amen it's so good to be here in the house of the lord once more hey one of his masters to give god all the honor and praise you know there's no better place than to be here in the house of the lord there's many people out in the world you know fridays are the times where they go out and do things but for a christian it's a place where we can come and gather and be under the presence of the lord amen i would like to go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to joshua 1 verses 7 and 8. uh and whenever you have it just go ahead and say amen for this amen joshua 1 7-8 he says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to do all to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou i like how he says that you observe to do all according to the law this is then verse 8 it says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but shall thou sh thou but shalt thou meditate therein and night that they may that thou mayest prosper to to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success heavenly father we have read your holy scriptures lord lord this is the word that came out of your mouth lord yes lord this is the word that can make all things alive father yes lord we ask that your word may go through around through each and every person and may speak to each and every person as the song says lord speak my lord. speak lord that we may receive eternal life we give you all the honor and glory glory we submit ourselves unto you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen amen amen you may be seated i would like to continue my little thought that i had for the young people of the importance of your bible the importance i'm not going to ask who has their bible but every single person should be with their sword today because this this is where eternal life is at america this should be a book that is the most worn down in our homes don't worry when you buy a bible if there's something that that raises in your heart write it down circle it highlight it in your bibles and this contains all the promises of god all the promises that you ask the lord every single day the things that you ask of lord give me strength for today lord uh lord please help my um my family today lord senor my family lord i have an exam today please lord be with me you'll all find all the answers here in this bible we encourage everyone to read their bible every day whether it's a few verses or a few chapters a day if you go to work you could play an audio version of the bible but that you may read the bible and see what's in there you let a person feed on the word for a month you'll see how they change the way of talking i'm not going to say his name but i spoke to a brother and uh he had a very unfortunate event [Music] and i called him and um like if it was anybody else in the world how it's going to affect their way of living that's a regular person and that's normal but when i started talking to him he said you just wouldn't believe it brother you lie no no the testimony in this testimony he said how god he helped me out so much and when when it looked like uh the worst was going to happen god he was the one that healed him and though though he was still in a not a good condition he was praising the lord for the miracle that he saw he saw the miracle in his situation the way of talking will be different you won't be talking about your property you won't talk about how downcast you are because when you read the bible he that heareth the word that's where faith comes faith cometh by the hearing of the word of the lord and allow the lord to give you the tape or give you the faith just read the word every day talk to the lord every day today i want to talk about um about searching the scriptures if you have a desire or you need something read your bibles now i i'm especially um targeting this to the young people all right so you can understand the grace and the goodness of god now reading your bible every day is different than searching the scriptures and that's a good thing yes but you could just read about the bible and forget about what you read the next day bible it's on purpose every comma you see in the bible it wasn't put there by accident there was there was a great divine design how do you say uh all the names of the books of the bible or all the chronology of the bible i'll you know i could testify when i was young i just wanted to skip that part yeah and and and so and so we got and all these big words and it's just it was something that it's like well is there any purpose in this there's there's uh treasures in the genealogies in the chronologies there's mysteries in there now i want to um go to a scripture in matthew 5 18. if you'd like to turn with me matthew 5 18. i just want to take my time today and just uh talk to you for a little bit uh this is jesus talking to the the to the people this is verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle shall not shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled all heavens and earth shall pass away but this word shall not pass away now what is what are these words jot and tittle and tittles have to do with the letters and pen strokes in the hebrew writing brothers if you want to um put up the slide transparency i want to show you how they look so uh the jot la it's the tenth letter in the hebrew alphabet and it's the smallest letter that's the smallest letter in the hebrew alphabet the jot is is related to our modern um english word iota it means a very small amount so it's the smallest letter in the hebrew alphabet now to the next slide i don't know but maybe you're asking well why is he showing me all of this is a letter extension a pen stroke that can differentiate a hebrew word from another until extension is so i don't know if they can bring it up but one one of the word or one of the letters it's called resh and it it's like this yes this is the form and the corner it's a very smooth corner you just do one pin stroke on it then there's another letter that's called delete and that one is made with two pen strokes it looks very similar but if that corner you go like that and you stop and then you go down it looks like a backwards seven but you're using two pen strokes to do it is and this little part right here yes that's called a tittle and that differentiates the two different letters jesus says not one jot nor one tittle in no wise pass from the law till it all be fulfilled [Applause] the fulfillment is inevitable inevitable even the smallest letter of the law will be fulfilled even the smallest pin stroke of the prophets will be accomplished not even one smallest detail of god's law will disappear until its purpose is achieved in english a giant tittle is um just best described as a t the crossing of a t or a dotting of an eye tilde so why am i saying all this because god's word is on purpose it's intentional it's intentional every letter every number every it's a deliberate design intentional to wear thousands and thousands of years before christ god was already speaking about him through the prophets god already spoke about the bride through the old testament god went beyond space and time he went outside and went into eternity and created this book that that every single prophecy has been or will be fulfilled it's the beginning and the end so then how should we approach the scripture reading the bible is good but but i think for every single person we need to search the scriptures there was a great preacher named dwight moody dwight moody he said if a friend were to see me searching around the building i'm sure he'd walk away and think i was very foolish that's what he said but if he said but if i said i lost a dollar yo foreign see whenever you read the scriptures with intention read the scriptures like you're looking for something every single promise is there in the scriptures for you every single thing in acts 17 11 it says these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so yes don't allow church to be your only substance of eating no permit don't allow the the preacher to be your only source of food see back in the day only only the high priest could read these only the priests they were the only ones with access to the word of god and the people were in the mercy of them and sometimes they didn't have really good agendas a lot of times they wanted to twist the words so that it can be for their benefit i'm sure if you don't have your bible here today you have it on your phone you could take it wherever you want to go and you have the eternal words of god and if there's something that maybe you have a question about that maybe a preacher preached look for it that's your freedom you know i have a really precious brother because i want somebody to go and look for it in the bible themselves that's your right god gave revelation to everybody not just to ministers amen amen this is this is for everybody this is so that you can see what promises you have in the bible especially in proverbs 2 1 to 6 it says and proverbial says this he says my son if thou receive word um receive my words and hide my commandments with thee recive so thou inclined thy near unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding if you thou christ after knowledge and lift up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches her for the hidden treasures then thou shalt understand the fear of the lord and find knowledge of god entonces for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding when you search the scriptures you're searching hidden treasures brother there's great places to go into adventures you can go to many adventures in the world but the greatest adventure is hidden in the bible there's love stories in the bible there's stories of anything you like in the bible my favorite story was um the story of david when i first gave my heart to the lord oh i read to see how great the story of david was he was just a little shepherd boy hello and i think we could all relate to this but he was the one that nobody wanted right now so so we sometimes we can relate to these characters and you could see the elevation of his life as you continue to read his life that's all in the scriptures some people would would teach their children that the west side of the mississippi river del rio mississippi was the great american desert american it was a barren land but when they first struck that hard ground with a pickaxe they took out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of silver ellios they realized that the west wasn't just the barren land a lot of the western states are the richest mineral states in the united states but they didn't know they just saw it and they're like oh no and it was and they said no it's a barren land you know that's a large portion of the bible yes many of us are living on just a few scriptures of the bible scriptures that maybe the prophet said and we sit there and we live on those scriptures you know there's scriptures that a preacher might preach and they said oh man this is my scripture uh but there is a large portion of the bible that maybe maybe doesn't seem like it's understandable yet there's life and there's hidden treasures in there brother branham says this yeah in the message god keeps his word well what's the matter with many believers they just take somebody's word for it and they don't search around to see what their book happens is they don't see where their book what their book is every promise in this book is yours no promise um outside of the book but in the book them promises is yours foreign well now if i had a big arcade and was given to me i wouldn't say i own this arcade but i'm just foolish enough to get around and see what i own i like to pull out this drawer and look in it and look up on this shelf and look and and looks a little too high and get me a step ladder when you became a christian christian all these promises became yours from cover to cover this from the words that say holy bible once you begin to realize what the word is and those were the same words that created heavens and earth when he said let there be a there was a foe and everything that you see that is created was created by the word of the lord and now all of those words they have become your promises he said i realized that every promise of the word was mine if i seen a promise i couldn't get to casa yo de cayona promesa la cuando [Applause] the devil will try to rob it from you fellowship is yours everything is yours the world is yours you own it all it belongs to you it's god's promise if your house goes in flames it's gonna hurt but remember you possess all things if remember you are a possessor of all things i remember they asked brother branham the question um how can a christian get deeper in love with god and when you read it that's when you begin to get closer and closer to him if you search from genesis to revelations you'll begin to see all of your promises of god remember when philip found nathanael philippe praying under the tree he said we found him we found the one we were looking for the one the scripture has been talking about the whole time we found him finally he said jesus of nazareth the son of joseph jesus jose phillip said felipe can anything good come from nazareth he was endowed that was a question sometimes we have questions does anything good come from nazareth philip said the best thing he could say he said well let me see i don't know uh let me try to explain it to you he said come and see he said go and look for it yourself and prove him yourself and see if that's the person that you were looking for finally he found him finally he found the verse he found the scripture he found this the the chapter in control and he said behold a man that there is no guile in him he said wow how do you know he said in israel he said how do you know who i am he said i saw you when you were praying under the tree this is the one i've been studying this is the one i've been searching verse 51 john 1 51 jesus tells them jesus he says jesus said unto him because i said unto you i saw you under the fig tree believeth thou shalt thou shalt see greater things than these responders he said he sayeth unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of god descending ascending and descending upon the son of man because he went and he proved i remember when he was there being judged by pilate even to the point where god was was dealing with him in his household and his wife was having terrible dreams and whenever he went and stood in front of all the people he said i've searched them and i have found no fault in this man you'll find the thing that you're wondering about you'll find your questions because it's all in the word there should be an urgency in reading our bibles amen now i just want to give you a little bit of examples here uh now in a christian our specialty should be the word aura cristiano estrada especially right as a christian you should know the word verdacomo cricianos now the first thing is are we saved our la primero says and also being born again is better than the knowledge of greek in hebrew so we can look and we can get things and knowledge and all of this from the bible entonces but the first thing you want to make sure that you are saved and you are born again that's that's the first thing what does the bible say what did jesus say he said uh if you're not born of the spirit you can't even see the kingdom of god so being born you god is able to show you and reveal things to you when you go in your room pray pray before you study we pray whenever we we're about to open up the word here in church do the same thing in your home if you're at your your home and everybody else is doing shut yourself in your in your room put your phone on airplane mode and pray god wrote this word intentionally let's read with intentions let's read with revelation with walking into his presence allow the spirit to the bible says don't only be hears of the word but all but doers also whenever we read and we read and we read then go and and obey and act on the words the greatest adventure is the bible i'm going to give you some examples did you ever notice that there's no chapter in baptism you can't find a specific chapter just that specializes and speaks nothing or only baptism or specifically or receiving the holy ghost there's no chapter of just specifically the holy ghost no these are key thoughts and key ideas that are spread throughout the whole entire book of the bible and then you have to go and you have to search for them you have to go and you have to begin to see the big picture of of baptism or the holy ghost it's you can go and you can find them there's ways to study your bible now i'm just giving you ideas it's how you're led to do it there's a topical way of of reading or topical studies uh if there's a city that you see in the bible you can go and you begin to see the history and read it all in the bible there's themes that show the bigger picture an overall meaning to that reveal why a story matters in the bible there's word studies there's a study of of um the word love well we know because the prophet revealed to us that and and he showed us with the greek words that there's two words for love okay there's a gapo and there's ophelia so if you could get a word study and just study that word and find what that word means there is also a way of studying dispensations you could study from from adam's time all the way down to abraham and study how it works different times and timelines you know there's there's a topic that has really interested me that i i study without um intending to preach on it but there's the five women in the genealogy that's very interesting because you begin to think if you start to look at how genealogies work it was only the men that were mentioned but then in i believe it was matthew they mentioned five women in that genealogy and maybe how it types the bribe and you could start seeing the way they lived their lives what i've noticed is all of every single one of them had something to do with protecting the seed but you can find it all there now um the best book to read from is the king james version of version king james for for me personally for me personally it's okay to go to a different version if you don't understand but you have to be careful because king james version is the closest one to the original words i heard brother luis once um say behind the that in the new international version i believe there's a few verses that are taken out of the of genesis 1. uh so you just have to be careful with that if you go and you read from another version always go back to the king james version you can read that but go back and see what king james version says or king james because i know some other versions are just a little easier but but whenever you need to uh start remembering a verse remember the king james version regret that's how we're able to see um the difference of love this he used the word cosmos it was a greek word for world solar cosmos when he spoken about revelation about the beasts there was two different kinds of beasts we had those different this class is the best there was one zun and one therion oh no so if just go with revelation pray about it and look into the scriptures there's there's uh people that have gifts of studying but that doesn't mean that you don't have to no there's people with gifts of prayer personas there's gifts of faith i don't necessarily faith doesn't mean i'm gonna stop praying and stop having faith because that person has it no significa where the heart is there's gifts of teaching but still go and you go and look at the scriptures yesterday now in closing this is what i want to get to the conclusion of the whole bible is the identity of the lord jesus christ brother branham says this in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said the principle theme of the entire bible or he is the principle theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and you don't see christ in every verse see if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read he is that um to the amen in revelations is is every word testifying of jesus christ in genesis where it says in the beginning in the end where the bible says in revelations amen there is jesus christ that's where the true revelation is so like i said my first true study was the study of david a convention oh one of my favorite parts was seeing the right hand men of saul and david uh david amner and joab amnari oh man those were faithful men yes and then looking at the warriors that would would would destroy thousands because they knew the king was anointed oh but then he asked me this question that just tore my whole world apart he said where do you see jesus i don't know i just see the story and it's so amazing but christ is in every scripture he's the theme of the entire bible that's when you can see christ in the scripture when you could see christ as that anointed rejected as david was asleep and seeing their man going and fighting for him and you see how the the other people rejected him and david cried out he said my god my god why have thou forsaken me that's the same very words that jesus said on the cross you begin to see christ as david walked up to goliath you could see christ whenever david was was the greatest king of all of israel he was there he was there with moses he was the rock that was smitten he was the lamb that was slain whenever adam and eve sinned adam shadow jesus christ whenever he chose his wife over eternal life it was all jesus christ it was all christ in the scriptures god he methodically placed every word every iota in the scriptures and put when you see christ now in closing now a man is if you'd like to stand with me because i i will go over time but a true man his words is a revelation of himself we've heard many people say a man is as good as his word there was one time this great handsome prince was out and and everybody loved him because of of his uh of how he looked he told us but when he stood before the elders and that's who god is yes christ christo is the word of god jesus jesus he is the embodiment of god's word that's why we should see christ in every verse then we can see our fall and our rise to god see it's a dangerous thing to see ourselves without seeing first christ because without christ there is no remission no remission without christ there is no goodness by the brother branham says that christ is the very heart of god uh yourself the only way you can see yourself is through christ then he becomes the center of revelation in your life lord we just want to thank you for your goodness and your grace lord we ask lord that you just bless each and every young person here lord father that you give them an ambition or a heart of fire lord an [Music] your spirit and your word are two in the same father lord we just ask that you be with them and you you anoint them and fill them with the holy ghost lord as they read father that you can reveal yourself to them lord we thank you we ask all these things in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you god be with you [Music] i [Music] happy [Music] land [Music] [Applause] [Music] who will come and go with [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] forever [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] i am oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music]
