cannot be bought with the money of the world doesn't matter how much money we have they personally hand their envelope to the man that's in charge of the finances and he thinks that everything is fine that's what he thinks hermanos hermanos brothers and sisters uh the truth is something that we cannot know regardless of how much money we have if we bring our envelope that's because it's a revelation and god's revelation is needed for everything blessed be the name of the lord amen amen when we give our offering that's because god already placed it in our hearts so now as sons and daughters of god we know that's a responsibility gloria and praise his name brothers and sisters that's part of knowing the truth that's part of being in the truth and i believe with all my heart is part of being in the truth gloria praise his name so truly brothers and sisters it's not something that we can buy god predestinated you to hear it you're going to see just a summary of what we said here in the last few months [Music] of the young people that we have here in this place preaching the word young preachers that are being used of god god is using you this sunday that just passed my son john paul was sitting next to me but john paul stopped me because he was right there next to me it's the worship brothers it's the time to raise your hands it's time to say to god how much we love him what we hear brothers why did we come to church we come to hear the nemo says and listen evening as soon as you leave but no one thinks you have a good defense with you what you heard that morning blessed be the name of the lord so brothers this is the way that god is using these young people we have already that have gone in beyond at the age of 16. yo the way that god used my brother emmanuel my brother eli hermano de on friday and brothers that that's a job and god give it more if you live and god will give him more the book of saint john chapter eight and all this that i'm going to say it's something that i've heard from my younger brothers there's other things that you might hear me say this is but some of the things that i'm going to say this morning in other words and when somebody reminds us of something we then rejoice and we ask god for his guidance gloria glory to his name san juan capitol ocho saint john chapter 8. verse 31 jesus then jesus said to those jews which believed on him which believed on him brothers because you momento just notice a moment when we hear a message we hear them with our ears and in our hearts we're rejoicing glory to his name and what we're listening to then becomes a revelation to us gloria glory to his name 31 then jesus said to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed now listen to verse 32. it goes along with the subject that i'm trying to prove and you shall know the truth and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and the truth shall make you free now what is it going to free us up brothers and sisters it will free us from many things i was telling the brother that many times in our homes we live under the influence of our parents we live under the influence of our uncles and aunts and family members and also under the influence of the church them that have already been born in the message there uh many children that have been mourning the message of parents that have already believed the message blessed be the name of our lord you still need your own personal day at calvary avenue a man brothers and doses so verse 32. and you shall know the truth i don't know what the lord has freed you from you say that i know what he has freed me from we all know front if you want to come there that's an action office that's an act of a courageous person a courageous woman but you don't have to do it where does anybody know you know i don't because we don't know when an accident will happen to us we've heard of brothers that have been in accidents we all heard that he was in a terrible accident is that right and that's something that could have happened to any of us and he will do so and the truth shall set you free and don't say yes so we already know what the lord has made us free from apocalypses let's go to revelations 1 3. revelations 1 3 that's the scripture that we're going to read we're reading god's word that's the weapon that helps us uh yesterday i went to go pick up my son jonathan at the fessa bus and he you know told me something that happened to him along the way says the the trip the ride was fine i was able to cross at the mile 19 you know there's a checkpoint for immigration immigration and uh two immigration officers came up when you're gonna head to fesa and i know how is it that they get on because i drove to pesa several times i came back and forth from nogales so i know what is it how they do we stop we open the door and normally they did not find no police records on it and one of them did ask him you know what do you what do you carry with you now he says no i don't have anything with me with this is the only thing that i have in my luggage is my weapon the most powerful thing that i can carry with me it says check it check it and when they found it they took it out it's not only consisting of reading and they that hear las palavras esta prophecia the words of this prophecy iguardan las cosas and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so i want to highlight on that blessed is when we read god's word we should ask him for understanding remember the man that came from jerusalem back to his own place and it was reading the scroll of the prophet isaiah and [Music] but he was reading but then suddenly god does something that's unusual felipe and samaria phillip was in samaria he said but then the spirit all of a sudden catches him away do you believe it i do not felipe we don't know what the weight of philip was personas there's people that are a hundred pounds a 180 200 300 no peso de felipe we don't know and he was seated in a chariot [Music] when this person was reading their the scripture the first thing that philip asked the man once he arrives says do you understand what do you read it's very beautiful god doesn't make mistakes god knows everything is how can i understand if there is no one to explain it to me gloria glory to his name god will have someone to explain it to you let me bring it a bit closer i was a pentecostal preacher and i was so happy and i was joyful the organization even gave me a bicycle you know why because they already have two three bikes at their home we would have to walk brothers if we managed to get a bike then oh brother well the organization bought me a bike and then after a bit of time they bought me a motorcycle and then i'm upgrading i won i'm upgrading they rented me a house brother juanito in a house with his bicycle and his motorcycles to go to the mission to go preach here and there and i was appointed 150 pesos pesos pesos 150 pesos but pesos hermanos back then that was a lot of money this is a 100 bill or a bill of 100 is their currency this is a bill of 20 from their currency and those is sien so 100 120 pesos and 30 they appointed 150 pesos so you know i was getting along but then a brother comes by pasa a brother comes by says by the and he gives me a book called the anointed ones of the end times that really hit me hard i see i see you that lead the blind says you're one day you're going to reap what you saw hermano eso and that caught my attention remember i had everything set up already [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm speaking about 1970-73 when the message barely came back then and the brother's just passing by mexico he was going to mexico i allowed him to preach to brother but they answered me and told me that he already had passed on and gone with the lord hermanos brothers and sisters buy the truth and sell it not gloria glory to his name god will allow us to hear the truth but what are we going to do with it is the truth is [Music] it doesn't matter i had everything ready but then i get the message the anointing ones of the end times and i begin to read it begins to deal with me allah and i began to preach it the way that god showed me tres messes espresso three months later the ones from the the monterey novoleon [Music] we have you know for the the three or four of us that came renunciation we want you to deny that or to claim it or feed the mississippi or that you claim it fascinating well brothers you make it really easy for me i accept what i have accepted now and the 300 pesos every 15 days are going to finish instead of getting sad and lowering my head amen i said amen my boy i'm leaving i'm leaving even my family was over there and the city of salvation called me familia and well i go with my family and i go look for pedirito and that's how i did it by the truth and if there is something that this messenger teaches with the ministry of the messenger of this age are brother william aaron branham gloria glory to his name let's just read again revelations 1 3. and i just that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand it's so important to listen and every message that was given to every church age but the emphasis is that he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches verse ear let him here what the spirit saved unto the church how many have ears this morning everybody everyone has an ear how many are listening to me everyone is listening we thank god for our hero his name and page 14 in the message the reproach for the cause of the word the reproach for the cause of the word the word la cualdios that god spoke that god spoke to him noah there was a reproach there was a reproach with noah no evil where there was a scientific achievement that they were able to manufacture los cuales that were beyond anything that we've manufactured today what do you think about that they were brighter more intelligent [Music] that he preached 120 years in the face of scoffers the great scientific ways proved to them that in the skies there wasn't any rain no via uv there was no rain this man is a madman that's the reproach for the cause of the word now let me tell you something when god speaks it it has to come to pass how many years are going to go by before it is he's not [Music] um you know in the car my wife's driving and i'm sitting down meditating and then all of a sudden i say mi release this is my luggage my case because i have my bible in it i have my things in there me release this is my case i thought i left it at home because it was the last thing that i brought okay i brought my water first i brought my coffee then i brought my code this is my case he says i got scared again at work 101 i'm under 101. 101. eva uh salinas i was going to come out on cave creek christiana i have christian music that's playing a speaker and a speaker right here to the side and then all of a sudden instead of listening to the song i heard a voice that said i'm sorry are you asking for questions if you're driving on the bus and then you're driving listen to the music and then all of a sudden somebody says that to you i got scared but it's the wisdom and the intelligence that we have today on the phones they even speak to you why did nobody told me that i'm of the old style it scared me and now i i can tell that phones speak to you ask whatever you want and they give it to you if you got 10 yards in your in your truck because they're going to put a little thing inside and is going to tell the inspector that that cement is super hot and they'll turn it down and now they're making us pay for that load so we just we can't afford to get lost but what we do as soon as we know where we're headed we have a book and we just the phone will give you the closest address but not that one that's why we have to get the book the book where all the streets and all the cities are in there oh boy i'm headed to phoenix so today we also have advanced science established we have their great scientific ways proved to them that there was no rain in the skies but yet noah had heard the word of the lord and it was contrary to their conception of it so before his life could be saved and i think that what i'm going to say to you know they use lodico one of them i'm gonna give you the homework to find out which one of them was the one that said because i can tell you who i heard from content but i'm so happy because of these young people and i've told them i've gone to them and told them in one single hour brother you preached you preached something that helped me but i want to give you the testimony when brother branham went to his cabin or to a cave or somewhere to be honest and he was going to pray and you can find this in the message how the angel came to me page 27 and says behold there was a lightning i won't read everything but i'll read the the highlights it says there was the light in the floor he opened and i thought whoa where does that come from and this is i looked around and i saw this light right above me reposando aides that was resting that way and it's swirling as a fireplace as an emerald and that that uh made me feel good that i'm not the only one that gets scared that scared me that's what he said and i heard someone coming in have you ever heard when somebody is approaching pablo this is my wife says uh john possier and i asked you how do you know oh yeah i already know his car what an ear yo me i'm up there in the clouds and i heard somebody approaching el hermanos and then brother branham and i saw the foot of a man coming in the entire room was dark except we're there where it was shining and i saw the foot of a man coming in and when he and what a privilege that an angel came to minister to our brother the same thing happened to paul as well as the number gloria glory to his name have you followed paul's life blessed be the name of the lord they say it says and i said he says very gently he said i am sent from the presence of the almighty god to tell you that your peculiar birth and you already know how my birth was it was the same light that rested above me when i was born ever since he was born that light followed him and what a privilege and he said your peculiar birth and your misunderstood life are blessed be the name of the lord said and this it doesn't matter what they have and he even pointed out god who is my judge knows it okay that he in the movie that we have of him and the deep calling to a deep when he's praying for someone sometimes he would ask them he says do you believe that i'm a man of god do you believe do you believe because he wanted them so that he could help them he had to make them believe cancer he even pointed out cancer nada he said nothing if you pray and you're sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer now i'm going to give you a testimony testimonial the reproach for the cause of the word paragraph 109. and i'll be skipping a few because but this is the testimony of a preacher he married a girl that was a sister i
