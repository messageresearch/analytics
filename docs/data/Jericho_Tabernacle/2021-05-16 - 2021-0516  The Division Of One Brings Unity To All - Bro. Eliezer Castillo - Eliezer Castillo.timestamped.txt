[48:09] if you would like to turn with me
[48:13] to saint john 17
[48:16] verses 20 to 23.
[48:30] i spoke on a message called the division
[48:34] of one brings unity to all
[48:37] men
[48:42] and uh we're gonna try to finish it
[48:56] and the bible says
[49:00] neither i pray neither pray i for these
[49:03] alone but for them
[49:05] also which shall believe on me through
[49:08] their word
[49:15] that they all may be one as thou
[49:18] father are me and i in thee
[49:22] and that they also may be one in us
[49:26] that the world may believe that thou has
[49:40] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[49:42] have given them
[49:44] that they may be one even as we are one
[49:47] gloria
[49:54] i in them and thou and me that they may
[49:57] be
[49:58] perfect in one and that the world
[50:02] may know that thou has sent me and has
[50:05] loved them and thou hast loved me
[50:24] heavenly father father celestial lord we
[50:28] just want to give you the glory and the
[50:29] honor
[50:31] gloria father we we come here
[50:35] already and expecting father father
[50:40] lord without you father we can open up
[50:42] the scriptures but you bring the
[50:44] revelation lord
[50:51] lord we can come here and worship but
[50:53] you'd bring the deliverance
[50:55] father
[50:59] you are the one that brings down eternal
[51:01] blessings
[51:07] so lord we come here fellowshipped under
[51:10] the blood of jesus christ
[51:15] knowing father that your word you are
[51:17] obligated to come and to
[51:20] give to the children whatever they need
[51:22] father savion
[51:28] lord so we commit ourselves into your
[51:30] hands
[51:32] each and every person here personally
[51:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[51:39] amen and amen amen amen amen you may be
[51:42] seated
[51:48] i spoke on um this message
[51:51] a few months ago
[51:56] and spoke on how in god
[52:01] god had his attributes in him
[52:06] but the bible or brother branham says
[52:08] that he desired
[52:10] fellowship
[52:14] he was god and god alone
[52:18] but in him he had attributes to be
[52:20] father
[52:21] son savior healer
[52:28] salvatore and he had attributes
[52:32] which were you and i
[52:37] we are his attributes today
[52:41] we were in him in his mind before the
[52:44] foundation of the world
[52:59] or he divided himself
[53:03] brother branham said that he gave birth
[53:05] to the logos
[53:09] and that was his son
[53:13] and that was his program from then
[53:16] all the way to the end
[53:20] that he divides himself
[53:24] and he fellowships not with somebody
[53:27] else but with himself
[53:32] i once heard a brother once say
[53:36] he said god doesn't have a family he
[53:39] says
[53:46] so in order to fellowship perfectly with
[53:49] god
[53:53] you have to be in him
[54:10] that is god fellowshipping with himself
[54:13] his family
[54:18] he divides himself in adam and eve
[54:24] and has perfect oneness
[54:28] all in one accord through the holy
[54:30] spirit
[54:35] brother branham says this of branham in
[54:37] the message
[54:38] oneness and his purpose
[54:42] as father supreme was to be
[54:45] um with his family earthly family adam
[54:48] and eve
[54:50] is
[54:55] and the only way he could be one with
[54:57] his family or
[54:58] with god
[55:03] because god's nature was in them
[55:09] that's the only way we can be one
[55:12] with our family and with god
[55:18] is when
[55:33] and god they become all one espos
[55:40] they were all one todos by the spirit of
[55:44] the holy
[55:44] ghost
[55:49] that's the only way that's as simple as
[55:51] it gets
[55:54] his true unity is through the holy
[55:56] spirit
[56:00] but we see that in genesis 2 17
[56:03] vemos and genesis that god
[56:06] gave them a commandment
[56:10] now the law was perfect in that time
[56:41] and god didn't give them 613 laws
[56:46] god gave them one thing to obey
[56:51] god told them you can eat of all of
[56:53] these fruits
[56:57] you can do anything you want to do
[57:00] you are god on the earth
[57:04] just don't touch that tree
[57:08] one thing brother
[57:11] or the bible says an amazing quote here
[57:17] that obedience is better than sacrifice
[57:22] and for me that scripture has always uh
[57:26] confused me
[57:29] and many people say well it's like this
[57:33] is that obedience to obey god
[57:39] is better than sacrificing yourself and
[57:41] giving him
[57:42] sacrifices
[57:47] that's not what the bible says
[57:50] he says it's better than the slain lamb
[57:56] well how could anything be better than
[57:58] jesus christ on the cross
[58:03] well in the original in the beginning
[58:17] and they had the nature to follow that
[58:20] obedience
[58:45] but that perfect sacrifice jesus christ
[58:50] was not like a sacrifice of lambs bulls
[58:53] and goats
[58:56] where where they had to sacrifice and
[58:59] sacrifice and sacrifice
[59:22] when he was the sacrifice of sacrifices
[59:27] he brought us back to the beginning
[59:41] because that perfect sacrifice came
[59:50] so that we can come back next year and
[59:52] cover them again
[59:56] he wiped them completely away
[1:00:00] and not only that but he put his
[1:00:04] own spirit back in you
[1:00:09] so that perfect fellowship
[1:00:24] and the bible says the day you eat
[1:00:27] thereof is the day you die
[1:00:34] brother branham says in this message
[1:00:37] it shall be even as it was told to me
[1:00:40] uh
[1:00:43] some men's sins go before um before them
[1:00:47] and some follow
[1:00:48] algonos
[1:00:52] let's confess ours now confess
[1:01:04] and god in the garden of eden when he
[1:01:06] pronounced death
[1:01:07] upon the human race
[1:01:23] and death means separation
[1:01:26] represents separation that's the reason
[1:01:28] we call it death for one another
[1:01:32] we separate from one another
[1:01:36] god says the day you eat thereof is the
[1:01:38] day you die
[1:01:42] and the unity broke he said because they
[1:01:46] separated from god
[1:01:49] they were separated from god
[1:01:53] from that holy spirit
[1:01:56] and they were dead spiritually
[1:02:01] and and the bible says
[1:02:04] that that god kicked him out of the
[1:02:07] garden of eden
[1:02:10] kicked them out from the tree of life
[1:02:15] brother branham says when
[1:02:18] man sin in the garden of eden
[1:02:22] he crossed a great chasm
[1:02:26] separating himself from an eternal one
[1:02:31] he separated himself from eternal life
[1:02:35] he separated himself from that dimension
[1:02:39] where he was in
[1:02:41] dimension because the garden of eden was
[1:02:44] still there
[1:02:47] god just separated him himself from them
[1:02:52] and in reality that's what happens when
[1:02:54] we die physically
[1:02:58] we're separated from one another
[1:03:05] when i can go to the grave and i i could
[1:03:08] see the remains of the one that i lost
[1:03:28] and when man crossed that great chasm
[1:03:32] god kicked him into the three dimensions
[1:03:38] living under the fourth
[1:03:42] and god separating the dimensions
[1:03:46] so that they can't go into the holy
[1:03:48] presence of god anymore
[1:03:52] that throne was what the seventh
[1:03:55] dimension
[1:03:56] is
[1:04:18] god would lay us in his bosom and put
[1:04:20] them to sleep
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:44] and and the bible says that he put
[1:04:46] cherubims around
[1:04:47] and he kept him away it is brother
[1:04:54] branham says in
[1:04:55] fellowship with god through
[1:04:57] reconciliation
[1:05:00] reconciliation and i can see them turn
[1:05:03] away
[1:05:03] from god there you come
[1:05:08] and i can see adam as he starts walking
[1:05:11] away
[1:05:11] and eve around his arm around eve
[1:05:20] as they started to walk out through the
[1:05:22] garden of eden
[1:05:26] and the great jehovah god standing there
[1:05:31] walking away from eternity
[1:05:37] i can see all the great endless
[1:05:40] eternities
[1:05:45] they were walking away from all of it
[1:06:15] he wasn't subject to dimensions
[1:06:20] he could go from there to here
[1:06:25] he was a multi-dimensional creature
[1:06:29] he he was an eternal creature
[1:06:33] and then imagine this eternal creature
[1:06:36] all right
[1:06:38] being subject to death
[1:06:42] the bible says death reigned over them
[1:07:24] the fourth dimension
[1:07:35] but if you notice as redemption becomes
[1:07:38] greater
[1:07:40] than
[1:08:01] we go to the five if we were
[1:08:04] under the blood of bulls and goats vamos
[1:08:06] a la quinta
[1:08:10] but whenever jesus christ
[1:08:13] shed his blood
[1:08:16] he allowed the saints to go to the sixth
[1:08:19] dimension
[1:08:22] and now every single person goes to the
[1:08:25] sixth dimension
[1:08:28] and whenever all things become new again
[1:08:31] the bible says
[1:08:34] in revelations 22 21 and 22 22.
[1:08:40] we will be in that seventh dimension
[1:08:44] the bible says that heavens and earth
[1:08:46] will be embraced
[1:09:04] falling from the heavens it literally
[1:09:07] paralyzed the earth literally
[1:09:09] it throwed every creature on earth and
[1:09:11] all of god's creation in bondage
[1:09:18] and man was under bondage of sickness
[1:09:21] and death and all those things
[1:09:28] that's what state that people are in
[1:09:32] today
[1:10:10] it's one of the greatest days when um he
[1:10:13] ascended up
[1:10:14] um cause or he is send it up
[1:10:20] because all over the earth since that
[1:10:22] day in the garden of eden
[1:10:27] that sin was committed all heavens was
[1:10:30] shut off from mankind
[1:10:36] satan is the prince of the power of the
[1:10:39] air
[1:10:40] principle fourth
[1:10:56] no man could understand because the
[1:10:58] power is just above it
[1:11:04] heaven means atmosphere cielo
[1:11:06] significant atmosphere
[1:11:08] atmosphere above and all these
[1:11:12] powers are shut off from mankind because
[1:11:14] of sin
[1:11:20] so he's saying that the fourth dimension
[1:11:22] or the
[1:11:23] that that place where saint dwells
[1:11:30] is an atmosphere right above us
[1:11:35] and it shut all humanity away from that
[1:11:38] presence of god
[1:11:43] and there was no true unity
[1:11:46] but if you would like to turn with me to
[1:11:49] genesis
[1:11:50] 11. volterra de genesis
[1:11:54] the bible says and the earth was
[1:11:58] of one language and one speech
[1:12:05] we see a unity there
[1:12:33] but it was false because the spirit of
[1:12:37] god wasn't in them anymore
[1:12:41] we see this place they were
[1:12:44] of one language and one speech is
[1:12:50] now in the book of the seven church ages
[1:12:52] the pergy mean
[1:12:53] church age position
[1:12:58] brother says this babylon has always
[1:13:03] been literally and figuratively his
[1:13:06] heck his headquarters he's talking about
[1:13:08] satan
[1:13:15] it was the city of babylon that satanic
[1:13:18] worship had its origin
[1:13:22] babylonia
[1:13:26] all false unity
[1:13:29] begins in babylon commence in babylonia
[1:13:33] all false
[1:13:36] religion today religion comes from
[1:13:39] babylon
[1:13:40] babylonia comes from the tower of babel
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:58] to give back to god
[1:14:02] amen amen
[1:14:06] the bible says in verse 2 it says and it
[1:14:09] came to pass
[1:14:10] as they journeyed from the east they
[1:14:12] found a plane in the land
[1:14:14] of shinar that they dwelt there and they
[1:14:16] do out there
[1:14:26] and they said to one another go to
[1:14:29] let us make brick and burn them
[1:14:31] thoroughly that they may
[1:14:33] they had and they had brick for stone
[1:14:35] and slime
[1:14:37] had they for mortar is
[1:14:48] and let's see what it says in verse 4.
[1:14:52] and they said go to let us build a city
[1:14:56] and a tower whose top may reach unto
[1:15:00] heaven and let us make a name
[1:15:03] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[1:15:06] face of the whole
[1:15:08] earthquake
[1:15:32] brother branham says in um fellowship
[1:15:35] with god through reconciliation
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:40] god longs for fellowship
[1:15:44] he yearns he wants people to speak with
[1:15:47] him to talk with him
[1:16:05] by himself solo he saw himself
[1:16:09] sevilla and when he saw him alone he
[1:16:11] said it's not
[1:16:12] good for man to be alone
[1:16:17] because he felt that feeling
[1:16:21] because he desired fellowship with his
[1:16:24] children
[1:16:27] that's god's heart's desire
[1:16:31] so that we could be one
[1:16:37] so that we could have perfect fellowship
[1:16:39] with one another
[1:16:46] but
[1:16:59] that's not the way god did it
[1:17:03] god doesn't achieve fellowship so or it
[1:17:06] doesn't
[1:17:06] use fellowship to achieve something no
[1:17:09] us the goal is
[1:17:13] fellowship la meta is
[1:17:22] so that i could be one with you so i can
[1:17:24] get something back from you
[1:17:53] they were in one mind established and
[1:17:58] they
[1:17:58] use that fellowship yosaranese
[1:18:00] companerismo
[1:18:02] so that they can get to god but
[1:18:06] they said let us come together
[1:18:10] god said multiply and replenish the
[1:18:14] earth
[1:18:17] god said to scatter
[1:18:21] they said no let's come together
[1:18:25] because god's fellowship is different
[1:18:27] than man's fellowship
[1:18:28] companies we think we have to be under
[1:18:33] one
[1:18:33] church we think we have to be under one
[1:18:38] head
[1:18:51] we see that in in the catholicism we see
[1:18:54] that in denominations
[1:18:58] do we see that in the message oh i'm not
[1:19:01] going to say anything
[1:19:02] you know what i said now but that's the
[1:19:05] way
[1:19:06] man's fallen nature is yes
[1:19:10] that's man's fallen nature
[1:19:14] let's come together let's be under one
[1:19:17] head
[1:19:32] it says for the earth shall be filled
[1:19:34] with the knowledge of the glory of the
[1:19:37] lord
[1:19:40] gloria as the waters cover the sea
[1:19:46] man that water covers the majority of
[1:19:48] this earth
[1:19:51] god wants his glory to be spread abroad
[1:19:57] unity is not coming together
[1:20:00] and building the tower of babylon
[1:20:28] and he wants his glory to be filled all
[1:20:44] if i'm in mexico and you're here
[1:20:47] by one spirit by one spirit we are all
[1:20:51] baptized
[1:20:54] into one body by one spirit
[1:21:01] but they try to fellowship under this
[1:21:04] tower
[1:21:08] they use the very thing god yearns for
[1:21:13] so that they can reach up to heaven it
[1:21:16] says
[1:21:20] amen amen they said
[1:21:23] let us make a name for ourselves
[1:21:27] let us go up to heaven
[1:21:31] that sounds a whole lot like lucifer
[1:21:35] i will ascend to heaven
[1:21:39] i will sit on the sides of the north yo
[1:21:42] establish
[1:21:44] i will be like the most high yo
[1:21:48] it was a demonic unity
[1:21:51] good intentions maybe
[1:22:03] and the bible says in in verse 5 of
[1:22:05] genesis
[1:22:08] and the lord came down to see the city
[1:22:11] and the tower whose the children of men
[1:22:13] build
[1:22:16] us
[1:22:19] and the lord said behold the people
[1:22:23] is won
[1:22:26] and they all have one language and this
[1:22:29] they begin to do
[1:22:31] and now now listen to this now nothing
[1:22:34] will restrain them from them nothing
[1:22:36] will be restrained from them
[1:22:38] which they have imagined to do yes
[1:22:48] nothing nada unity is powerful
[1:22:53] even if it's controlled by the devil
[1:22:58] there's nothing that would constrain
[1:23:00] them
[1:23:03] from what they wanted to achieve
[1:23:14] go to let us go down and confound the
[1:23:16] language that they may not understand
[1:23:18] with another speech
[1:23:26] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[1:23:29] thence upon the face of the earth
[1:23:31] and they left off to build
[1:23:39] therefore the name of this uh the name
[1:23:42] of it
[1:23:43] uh of it called babel because the lord
[1:23:45] did confound their language
[1:23:47] of all the earth and from thence the
[1:23:49] lord scattered them abroad the face of
[1:23:52] all the earth
[1:24:02] brother branham says in the unity of god
[1:24:04] in one church
[1:24:09] in 1958 now they build a tower
[1:24:14] which i doubt that modern science could
[1:24:17] build today
[1:24:23] so they they were way smarter than us
[1:24:28] they were which all their machineries
[1:24:33] and things
[1:24:34] because they were united together
[1:24:41] they had one mind one soul one purpose
[1:24:44] one motive one objective
[1:24:50] that's build a tower so high that if god
[1:24:53] could ever
[1:24:54] took a notion to destroy them again
[1:24:56] they'd run right into heaven
[1:24:58] with him
[1:25:08] wow and they've been there there'd be no
[1:25:11] way
[1:25:12] that they could keep him from doing it
[1:25:18] or he could keep them from doing it
[1:25:22] as they thought and and we find out
[1:25:27] then that they organize themselves
[1:25:29] together and we find them completely out
[1:25:31] of the will of god
[1:25:36] in contra complex
[1:25:40] isn't that a beautiful picture of this
[1:25:42] day
[1:25:45] when men are trying to unite together
[1:25:50] we try we should be united
[1:25:53] we sh and we should be united
[1:25:57] but they're uniting under the wrong
[1:25:59] system
[1:26:03] did you ever notice how the devil
[1:26:05] patterns off the things of
[1:26:12] did you ever see that how he takes the
[1:26:14] things that god has purposed
[1:26:20] the devil patterns everything just like
[1:26:22] god
[1:26:23] el diablo
[1:26:26] now i have a question we don't
[1:26:30] you guys don't have to answer if you
[1:26:32] have the answer you can say it
[1:26:34] response how high was the tower of babel
[1:26:40] how high was it
[1:26:44] there was one time they said that a
[1:26:47] russian astronaut
[1:27:02] he went beyond the atmosphere atmosphere
[1:27:05] he went beyond the orbit of the earth
[1:27:09] and he said well where's your heaven
[1:27:10] you're talking about it
[1:27:14] you keep pointing up there
[1:27:29] and he said where is your god
[1:27:32] there is no god up here
[1:27:35] and maybe that was a rebuke to many
[1:27:37] christians
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:40] christians say wow i i got it wrong here
[1:27:43] why don't we
[1:27:43] make you okay
[1:27:56] is right here in a faster dimension
[1:28:12] so that we
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:25] so how high was the tower of babel
[1:28:29] these men the bible said brother brown
[1:28:31] says that they were completely
[1:28:33] smarter than us
[1:28:37] and we dumb people already know that
[1:28:42] there's no heaven up there nosotros
[1:28:47] it was a pyramid it was a pyramid
[1:28:52] and and they barely found out yeah pena
[1:28:56] they found a tablet
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:59] a stone tablet
[1:29:02] nebuchadnezzar ii
[1:29:06] and they had a pyramid right next to him
[1:29:13] and those pyramids they go down like
[1:29:15] steps
[1:29:19] brother branham says that's the same
[1:29:21] exact uh pyramid that enoch made this
[1:29:23] element
[1:29:26] he said he made a seven stepped pyramids
[1:29:32] and brother berlin says that that
[1:29:34] pyramid that's holy city this is
[1:29:52] and the the river of life was strickling
[1:29:55] right down through it
[1:29:59] and in this tablet when they found it
[1:30:04] they could read the description on the
[1:30:06] bottom podium
[1:30:09] and it was showing that nebuchadnezzar
[1:30:12] ii
[1:30:15] was trying to rebuild the tower of
[1:30:18] babylon
[1:30:25] and it was showing that the tower of
[1:30:27] babel was there with them still
[1:30:32] and he was trying to rebuild it
[1:30:36] but he wasn't trying to build a great
[1:30:38] big tower
[1:30:41] that's sunday school cool coloring book
[1:30:44] stuff
[1:30:45] libros de las clas
[1:31:02] amen amen
[1:31:07] so it was a pyramid
[1:31:10] you know the first bible was the stars
[1:31:28] the stars were there all the
[1:31:31] constellations were there
[1:31:35] and then the second bible
[1:31:38] was built by enoch which was a pyramid
[1:31:42] brother branham says
[1:31:45] and those pyramids if you look into it
[1:31:50] astrologically built
[1:31:53] so that they can reach up to the stars
[1:32:23] the bible says that he walked with god
[1:32:28] and one day he was found
[1:32:32] not anymore
[1:32:35] he was lifted up somewhere somehow
[1:32:38] fueled
[1:32:52] how
[1:33:21] trying to reach heaven not all the way
[1:33:23] up to heaven they were trying to reach a
[1:33:25] dimension
[1:33:29] they were smaller than us and
[1:33:33] us as dumb as we are
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:34:26] that science found out that cancer was a
[1:34:29] four-dimensional disease
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:45] on your chest it's a devil
[1:34:49] diablo and we have men going behind
[1:34:52] the brother brethren says behind god's
[1:34:54] laboratory hey this is
[1:35:12] they're doing it as we speak they did it
[1:35:15] in the 1960s when brother branham
[1:35:17] preached it
[1:35:22] contacting the fourth dimension
[1:35:26] so here these people are trying to get
[1:35:28] into heaven
[1:35:31] well we know what babel means
[1:35:34] it means confusion significa confusion
[1:35:37] but if you dissect
[1:35:38] that word if
[1:35:54] is elohim
[1:36:00] so whenever you hear l in the bible
[1:36:05] like bethlehem it means the house of
[1:36:09] god's bread this
[1:36:10] la casa del panderios el means god el
[1:36:13] significados
[1:36:17] now the word you you can look it up it
[1:36:21] is means
[1:36:30] amen amen brother branham says in the
[1:36:34] messages i'm sorry i don't have them up
[1:36:35] here
[1:36:36] this is
[1:37:05] and that's what churches do today
[1:37:09] we're trying to achieve heaven
[1:37:13] through a false unity unity
[1:37:17] is what god desires
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:38:13] it will always lead to confusion
[1:38:19] amen amen and that was the state of the
[1:38:24] tower of babel yes
[1:38:27] but there was a man brother branham says
[1:38:31] that was there he was there
[1:38:34] at the tower of babel he was there in
[1:38:38] babylon in babylonia his name was abram
[1:38:43] and god says get out of that country
[1:38:48] leave your parents
[1:38:51] leave all that idolatry
[1:38:55] leave all that false religion
[1:38:59] and come even and i will bless you
[1:39:04] and in you ent and in you
[1:39:08] and all families of the earth shall
[1:39:12] be blessed
[1:39:16] what's god's program the division
[1:39:20] of one la division uno brings unity to
[1:39:23] all
[1:39:24] god separates yo and he brings unity to
[1:39:29] all through that
[1:39:29] separation or that emptying of himself
[1:39:37] so he got one man
[1:39:41] out of your loins out of you
[1:39:45] all of the earth will be blessed
[1:39:49] and your your your seed will be like the
[1:39:53] sands of the earth
[1:39:54] of the sea
[1:39:57] amen he was bringing back
[1:40:01] true unity through one man
[1:40:06] he said out of your people they said
[1:40:08] pueblo there's going to be one mind one
[1:40:11] spirit one accord
[1:40:14] and god separated that righteous man
[1:40:18] and that's our calling today yesterday
[1:40:31] he said babylon has fallen they say
[1:40:34] al-qaeda babylonia
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:47] and it's become the habitation
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:15] have committed fornication with her
[1:41:20] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:41:22] rich through the abundance of our
[1:41:23] delicacies
[1:41:28] same commission that he gave abraham
[1:41:34] and i heard another voice from heaven
[1:41:38] saying come out of her okay come out of
[1:41:41] her my people
[1:41:43] partakers of her sins participated
[1:41:47] that ye shall not receive her plagues
[1:41:52] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[1:41:58] and
[1:42:12] and he said i will go down there they
[1:42:14] say
[1:42:15] and i will confound them and confuse
[1:42:17] them
[1:42:19] and while they were all in a confused
[1:42:21] state
[1:42:24] he had arraignment there he had a
[1:42:40] all
[1:42:54] and uh if god's willing we'll we'll
[1:42:58] finish it up next time
[1:43:04] amen let us bow our heads
[1:43:07] heavenly father father celestial lord we
[1:43:10] just want to give you the glory and the
[1:43:12] honor

[2:03:16] before we have two announcements
[2:03:26] the
[2:03:29] we're asking everyone to be very
[2:03:31] cautious when they're
[2:03:32] exiting this place
[2:03:40] like they said earlier when we're
[2:03:42] reversing our cars out
[2:03:50] the drivers can be cautious when they're
[2:03:52] reversing for any kids or any
[2:03:55] adults anybody behind them
[2:04:00] and take your time when you're exiting
[2:04:02] towards the streets
[2:04:08] trafficking and
[2:04:11] also when we're exiting onto the street
[2:04:14] that we be cautious of the traffic on
[2:04:16] rozier
[2:04:22] be cautious of anybody passing by we
[2:04:25] don't cause an accident
[2:04:36] also they're asking when we enter in
[2:04:38] this into the sanctuary
[2:04:40] especially especially here in the
[2:04:43] entrance
[2:04:50] uh
[2:04:53] sometimes we're a little comfortable
[2:04:54] with speaking and greeting each other
[2:04:56] right right in the vegetable
[2:04:58] and says
[2:05:06] if we can be a little more reverent as
[2:05:08] we're going to be seated at the benches
[2:05:14] there might be somebody praying or
[2:05:16] worshiping or reading their bible
[2:05:25] and i'm speaking to somebody there or
[2:05:27] shaking their hand greeting them
[2:05:33] and that can upset the spirit here
[2:05:36] that's in the sanctuary
[2:05:42] you can stand with me and we'll be
[2:05:44] praying to dismiss the service
[2:05:46] vendito

[2:06:25] standing on your word
[2:06:51] but the promise you have given unto us
[2:06:53] that you would be with us until the end
[2:06:55] of the world
[2:07:12] and in this morning lord we place
[2:07:13] ourselves in your hands
