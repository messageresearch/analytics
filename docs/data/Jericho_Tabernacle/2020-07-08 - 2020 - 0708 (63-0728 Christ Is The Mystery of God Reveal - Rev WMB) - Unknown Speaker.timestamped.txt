[4:20] just remain standing a moment while we
[4:22] bow our heads for prayer gracious
[4:26] Heavenly Father we are approaching the
[4:29] again this morning for mercy and for
[4:35] guidance of the Holy Spirit today as
[4:38] it's dawned upon us that we should meet
[4:42] together this morning and to teach thy
[4:45] word and that we might know how to live
[4:50] in this present day and what is the time
[4:53] of day that we're living we last on holy
[4:57] guidance to our thoughts our hearts
[5:01] today that you would direct us to every
[5:04] word that is necessary for us to know to
[5:08] open our mouth freely and our hearts
[5:11] also to receive and that which you would
[5:15] speak to us and would close our mouths
[5:17] to the things that are not right knowing
[5:21] that only you can reveal the Word of God
[5:25] and now as I have to leave the little
[5:29] church right away now for the other
[5:32] parts of the world I'm committing them
[5:35] to the Lord which they are part the
[5:38] apple of my heart as to say they are the
[5:41] the ones that's been begotten to you by
[5:45] the spirit and by the word of truth I
[5:48] pray that you'll bless them Lord and
[5:50] keep them closely knitted together by
[5:54] the bonds of the love of Christ bless
[5:57] our dear beloved pastor the shepherd we
[6:01] pray that you'll anoint him with the
[6:02] Holy Spirit of thy word and
[6:06] reveal to them and feed the flock is
[6:10] once just a while ago when you show the
[6:14] vision the little tabernacle here but to
[6:17] store up the food that that would come a
[6:21] time when this is all being needed when

[6:33] food year for the Time Lord reverently
[6:37] I've tried to do that and now this
[6:40] morning and this lesson that we have
[6:42] thought of I pray that you cap it all
[6:45] off Lord to show that your God and this
[6:48] is your word and your truth granite Lord
[6:51] that the people might feed thereon and
[6:54] grow fat as it was in the grace of God

[11:44] years the past the time that God told
[11:46] him to live that's an ordinary lifetime
[11:48] a past a time that God told him he could
[11:51] live but we had a call the other morning
[11:54] that he was he was dying and we rushed
[11:57] up there and the Lord God was really
[11:59] good to him is spared him just I think
[12:02] he he's ready and just waiting the
[12:05] coming of the Lord but you know we all
[12:07] hold on to one another we just the old
[12:10] fella is like a like a dad to me here
[12:13] I'm everything sitting right down here
[12:15] in the old Tabernacle the old part when
[12:17] he that light flashed across on that
[12:19] water baptism in the name of Jesus
[12:21] Christ right out there he comment about
[12:24] 87 88 years old on a stick come right up
[12:27] here and said I wanna go riding there
[12:28] and be baptized somebody went got him
[12:31] some clothes he couldn't wait til the
[12:32] next time he had come right then alright
[12:34] and so I like that instead the other day
[12:37] I was talking to him he said you think
[12:40] I'm alright now brother branham I said
[12:43] did you ever go to a doctor for a
[12:45] physical checkup he said yesterday I so
[12:47] the doctor cuts tear scopes in his ears
[12:50] and put them on your heart see if your
[12:51] heart's beating right in an electrical
[12:53] cartogram and then blood pressure urine
[12:55] tests and so forth instruments to find
[12:57] out where your physical being now the
[12:59] way he does that he looks back on a book
[13:02] here were specialists on these different
[13:04] subjects writes down if this takes place
[13:06] this is what's wrong and I said
[13:10] now the only steer scope that I have is
[13:13] the Bible aim or the soul I said I'm
[13:18] gonna give you the test
[13:20] I said Saint John 5:24 said he that
[13:26] heareth my words I said that isn't
[13:28] listening to it that's receiving it ever
[13:31] seen it you believe it something inside
[13:34] of you tells you it's right you've
[13:36] accepted it you believe it it's yours
[13:38] either Europe it's already yours my word
[13:42] and believeth on him that sent me you
[13:45] believe that he said I do I said then
[13:47] I'll tell you what the chief doctor said
[13:49] he's passed from death unto life and
[13:51] shall no more come into condemnation our
[13:54] judgment I said as far as I know
[13:57] according to the books you pass the
[13:59] examination at old man of nearly a
[14:02] hundred years old not a church man at
[14:04] all but just the first time that light
[14:07] flashed across his path he received it
[14:10] ci predestinated seed laying there see
[14:15] as soon as the light strikes it it comes
[14:17] to life right quick now I know it's hot
[14:21] today
[14:22] and I look like it's hard for me to call
[14:26] you people together for our service
[14:28] where you sit jammed in like this but
[14:30] yet I thought by the grace of God that I
[14:34] would have another service before I had
[14:38] to leave you on for a short season I
[14:41] trust and I've got to go now tomorrow
[14:45] night to Chicago to begin Wednesday
[14:50] ought to get there a little early if
[14:51] possible and rest up a little before
[14:53] beginning a series of service and I
[14:56] believe they got it here I was looking
[14:57] at right here it's advertised up there
[15:00] it's called the Moringa area yeah
[15:07] marigold
[15:08] marade oh yeah area arena Mariga arena
[15:12] it's worth to be held beginning
[15:14] Wednesday night through Sunday and the
[15:16] Full Gospel businessman has a breakfast
[15:19] also on on Saturday morning and I don't
[15:22] know just
[15:23] where they got that advertised for no
[15:28] then start the evenings at the lean tech
[15:30] I see yours that every time now if
[15:35] you're around in that area up there it's
[15:38] be a regular if just a regular
[15:40] evangelistic service like we have at any
[15:42] time most the message is a beef
[15:44] primarily on something that's been
[15:46] talked to your course here's where we
[15:47] make our tapes you see out there they
[15:49] can fuss but if they get tapes made from
[15:51] here that's up to them if they want to
[15:52] listen to any tape it comes right from
[15:54] here this is our own pulpit so out there
[15:56] use the I'll try to pick around on
[15:58] something not very deep because many of
[16:01] them are shallow and experience and what
[16:03] comes in but your I feel I have a right
[16:05] to say whatever God puts up on my heart
[16:07] to say from right here so our tapes are
[16:09] all made from right here and they're
[16:12] riding the room there now you see their
[16:14] heads up or the cloud of glass in there
[16:16] where they're sitting with their
[16:17] recorders now on if you want to come to
[16:21] the meeting we'd be most happily to have
[16:23] you just if you get there don't know
[16:26] just where to go I just contact any of
[16:28] the Full Gospel people our brother
[16:31] Carlson and he'll you'll tell you that's
[16:33] um you can advise your the Philadelphia
[16:37] Church or any of them they can tell you
[16:39] right how to get to the place then I
[16:42] come back the next Monday evening
[16:44] sometime afternoon or evening and
[16:46] Tuesday we go back to Arizona for for
[16:52] putt the children's school and so forth
[16:54] and then I don't know just exactly when
[16:56] to be back again because the Lord I want
[17:00] him to leave me just don't want to do a
[17:02] very strange thing happened I might as
[17:05] well I know this is taped I might as
[17:06] well place it on here and right while
[17:10] visions and leadings of the Holy Spirit
[17:13] is moving I like to strike just exactly
[17:14] while it's a moving that's now the last
[17:18] year it's been that one right along with
[17:22] one of the most highest time for visions
[17:24] that I've ever had and all my ministry
[17:27] has been this last year of things that
[17:30] has taken place that you people know
[17:32] that it's foretold before it happens and
[17:34] it happened just the way it's said now
[17:37] we
[17:37] come back here and into a visit the
[17:42] climate in this place I certainly don't
[17:45] like cuz it just breaks me down as soon
[17:48] as you get here and I just I can cross
[17:51] the top of the knobs a parent come down
[17:53] in this valley and I'm here about ten
[17:54] minutes I got high get sick weather
[17:58] swimming in it everything looks spooky
[17:59] dark and I I just have to get out of it
[18:02] see and the other day I was talking to
[18:04] the wife but what brings me in first
[18:06] what brings me in here is you people me
[18:10] this church itay of all the places I
[18:12] went my life this is my favorite place
[18:14] to come preach the gospel and it looks
[18:17] like it we can make a tape from here
[18:19] it's ten times better than anywhere else
[18:20] the s reason I say we're God's doing
[18:23] something and stay right with that but I
[18:26] think what the great thing is that's me
[18:28] failing to go out at the first time when
[18:30] he called me and therefore he makes it
[18:32] kind of rough on we want to come in
[18:33] obedience is better than sacrifice and
[18:36] then I'll be coming back and forth all
[18:38] the time preaching in the Tabernacle in
[18:41] you people it's from out of town
[18:42] you're being notified Billy Paul would
[18:44] be here right in the office and and then
[18:46] be reached at any time through him and
[18:48] we'd be coming back here and then the
[18:51] seven trumpets is coming up right away
[18:52] the Lord willing seven last plagues and
[18:55] the vials and so forth just as we can
[18:57] get a little cooler weather maybe or
[18:58] something however the Lord leads and now
[19:02] the other day coming in uh it was a
[19:06] question brought up about something
[19:09] about someone had given me a check and
[19:12] said personally exactly just to me and
[19:16] the only tax paid free everything else
[19:19] what we went and Billy knew that I
[19:21] Connie had need of that check not you
[19:24] went and asked the attorneys if we could
[19:26] cash and he said why he's American
[19:28] citizen why can't he cashes he says tax
[19:31] paid and everything it was free any
[19:32] citizen can do that so then he couldn't
[19:35] be satisfied with that really so he goes
[19:37] to the public accountant he said why
[19:40] certainly you can cash that said he's in
[19:42] since the United States so well he
[19:44] couldn't think good about that so he
[19:45] called Merle Miller
[19:47] the head of the the tax Association at
[19:51] at Indianapolis there was our attorneys
[19:54] and so I simillar so sure it's all right
[19:58] hey hurry can have that check it's it's
[20:01] uh it's made out to him and Dorsey only
[20:04] I can only one can't endorse it
[20:06] go forth and it couldn't be stamped with
[20:08] our CI don't cash no checks that's what
[20:10] they got me for the other time somebody
[20:13] bringing a bunch of checks and say
[20:14] you're a brother branham at the meeting
[20:15] I'd say we didn't Branham William
[20:16] Branham well the government's taking
[20:17] care of all that a whole time I was
[20:19] signing to myself is paying the debts
[20:21] out there they said I will delinquent
[20:22] taxes on all of it anyhow
[20:24] three hundred thousand dollars so so
[20:26] then that's where the fuss came so then
[20:29] as soon as I put the check in whammy
[20:32] here come the agent right bank said we
[20:34] reopen the case for him now so it made
[20:37] it kind of rough and brotherly veils
[20:39] sitting here I guess it's all right to
[20:40] say it
[20:40] we just had come down and this fine
[20:44] scholar Baptists your head i baptize him
[20:48] in the name of Jesus Christ here food
[20:49] yesterday brotherly Valen and so it's
[20:53] really a fine man a brother in Christ
[20:56] he's preached for sure before highly
[20:59] intellectually educated and besides that
[21:02] a spirit-led man and the light flashed
[21:06] across him he said he'd try to get away
[21:08] if it just couldn't do it so I baptized
[21:10] him right here good morning couldn't
[21:11] stand it any longer so we just come down
[21:13] here put on her clothes when he was
[21:14] baptized the name of Jesus Christ well I
[21:17] thought been taking that fine spiritual
[21:19] food maybe to talk a little bit we take
[21:21] some natural food so he goes over to
[21:23] blue board sets down was talking except
[21:25] you come up how can you let people talk
[21:27] about you like that now our brother Vail
[21:29] one of the finest man they ever know but
[21:31] he's just a little too quick on the
[21:33] trigger always told her you know and so
[21:35] on yeah it's all I said I hope that's
[21:38] alright brother
[21:38] so what he's I said don't lie loose all
[21:42] at once that's still gloves the ones are
[21:44] doing it he said I might be alright for
[21:47] you he said he said but well I believe
[21:50] he is so smart so that's what he's been
[21:53] meeting those smart intellectual people
[21:54] so he just knows how to pour it in there
[21:56] and they ain't got no place to stand
[21:58] so I said look brother bail was set at
[22:01] the Blue Boar I said David one day after
[22:03] being thrown from the throne by his own
[22:07] son run off the throne mutiny Israel
[22:12] divided and David took off the throne by
[22:16] his own son and was going out of the
[22:18] city weeping and a guy that didn't like
[22:22] his last a message you know he didn't
[22:25] care for him
[22:26] little old fella kai crippled up going
[22:28] along there I'm making fun of him and he
[22:32] spit on David
[22:33] and that's guard drew that swords that
[22:37] I'll lift the head of that dog stay on
[22:39] him spit on my King David said let him
[22:42] alone the Lord told him to do that spit
[22:46] on making fun of him and then spitting
[22:48] so the Lord told him to do that well we
[22:52] know the story I returned Bank brother
[22:55] Vale though that took a whole lot of
[22:56] grease to do that so no more coming back
[23:00] and entered in the office public
[23:02] accountant called Billy Paul and told
[23:04] him about this so brother Vale went up
[23:07] the house with me I walked in out said
[23:10] to the wife long about sometime the
[23:12] afternoon we wanted to room I said I got
[23:15] something to tell you honey we just been
[23:16] talking for left she said bill I know
[23:18] that God sent you out there we all know
[23:20] that but he never told you come back he
[23:24] said huh that's where I'm worried about
[23:26] I said well I think it's for you and the
[23:29] children don't matter for me I'm gonna
[23:30] serve Him Lord willing more ever ago and
[23:33] so walk back not told her about it like
[23:36] that so I just turned around laid my
[23:38] head up somebody said something about
[23:42] hold this tax collector who Oliver I
[23:44] just kind of raid it out of something I
[23:46] can't not thinking of what I told
[23:48] brother Bale I said let him alone maybe
[23:51] the Lord told him to do that and no more
[23:54] and said that the light flashed on the
[23:56] wall and rolled across her brother Vale
[23:58] my wife sitting there come on back to
[23:59] Arizona with letters rolled across the
[24:02] wall come on back to Arizona I'm trying
[24:04] so here I go
[24:08] and then back to Arizona now this week
[24:12] has been a week of great blessings we
[24:15] had private interviews this week of
[24:18] people who have been waiting since seven
[24:20] seals and I would don't doubt but some
[24:24] of them course was called in from out of
[24:25] the town across the nation but the
[24:28] morning before the interview started
[24:31] setting in the room the Holy Spirit let
[24:33] me ride out exactly everything they knew
[24:36] everything they wanted to ask rotate the
[24:39] questions just the way they want to do
[24:40] and tell them their dreams and
[24:42] interpretation before they ever told me
[24:44] now that people are in the room you're
[24:46] there and I go ahead and let them talk
[24:48] and say well brother branham I come
[24:50] such-and-such I said now remember we
[24:53] have symbol here not for fellowship we
[24:56] haven't come here to fellowship with one
[24:58] another there is a question in your mind
[25:00] in your heart that that you've stumbled
[25:02] into and you don't know what it is and
[25:04] maybe I'll be able by the help of God to
[25:07] do it I said remember the Queen of the
[25:09] South had some questions to when she
[25:12] came to Solomon and the Bible said there
[25:14] was nothing revealed or helped back to
[25:17] what Solomon couldn't answer for now I
[25:20] said of greater than Solomon this year
[25:22] right the Lord Jesus promise wherever
[25:25] two or three are gathered in my name
[25:26] there I am in the midst of them what so
[25:30] everything they can
[25:31] the think of our desire and and she
[25:35] lasts it shall be given to them and now
[25:38] your question is something you don't
[25:40] know about something you don't know how
[25:42] to approach about something you don't
[25:43] know what to do about and I said again
[25:47] the scripture said this that the angels
[25:51] of God are encamped about those who
[25:52] fearing so in another world where the
[25:54] five census does not declare the five
[25:57] senses only contacts this world you have
[26:00] no feeling you couldn't feel nothing
[26:02] feeling won't be nothing to you that'd
[26:03] be another world you have no sight what
[26:06] you look at would be another world you
[26:08] know nothing about it so these five
[26:10] senses is the only thing that God let us
[26:12] lose to now there is another one called
[26:15] faith but by faith you walk up a ladder
[26:19] finally you can get so high
[26:21] until you break into another world which
[26:23] is vision there you can see just like if
[26:26] you never know what this was you is
[26:28] feeling with your sense of feeling never
[26:29] seen it then your eyes come open you can
[26:31] see it it'd be all mystery to that
[26:34] person who never could see you'd be a
[26:35] mystery to him but yet that's it and in
[26:38] there the Lord before we got here two
[26:41] people from across the country
[26:43] everywhere north south west come in for
[26:47] these interviews and as soon as they get
[26:49] through talking just exactly the
[26:50] questions they would ask the thing that
[26:52] they would asked about I'd say watch
[26:54] here raised over and that was a piece of
[26:56] paper with every question to rotate yes
[26:58] exactly why they asked it was going to a
[27:00] sit there answer down here to their
[27:02] question just answer down the Lord is
[27:04] great you know it's all things but yet
[27:08] take me about three days to come out of
[27:09] that afternoon well it was such a tear
[27:12] down and now I thought to get it all
[27:15] before we left and there is a proper way
[27:17] the real way to individuals now these
[27:22] things can be said and if the people
[27:24] share that knows that secrets of hearts
[27:26] that was revealed that would absolutely
[27:29] it would be horrible it calls time
[27:31] because somebody shoot another or
[27:34] something if that be revealed right here
[27:35] at the platform like this in a pub and
[27:37] before the public it would cause
[27:40] penitentiary and offenses and everything
[27:42] else that way but when you're setting
[27:44] together like that the Holy Spirit just
[27:47] two of you together but we understand
[27:49] this that what they ask me is private I
[27:53] say nothing about it and what I say to
[27:54] them it's up to them where they want to
[27:56] say it or no I think but it's been on
[27:59] between us the interview that's taken
[28:01] the person one by time and setting there
[28:03] until everything is completely settled
[28:06] see the Holy Spirit and then to think of
[28:09] the grease the Holy Spirit telling me
[28:11] all about it to each one a whole line
[28:12] them before they ever even got here
[28:14] across the country comes in people I've
[28:16] never seen in life and ride it out so if
[28:18] they had no just a routine according to
[28:20] the questions the way they would answer
[28:22] it one brother had questions on the
[28:24] serpent seed that I didn't get the
[28:27] answer
[28:27] just exactly calls her little half-hour
[28:29] was up I hoped that he got it all right
[28:32] the answers to it on the paper I
[28:35] it rolled out he didn't get to all of
[28:36] his answer so I just give him variety
[28:38] back the answers on the paper if he
[28:41] hasn't Billy Paul has it I know the man
[28:44] sitting here I just looked at in just a
[28:46] few moments ago so if he if he wants to
[28:49] find that it's rolled out on a piece of
[28:51] paper and your answers to your question
[28:54] now oh how good the Lord is I hope
[29:00] everybody's feeling good and now lets us
[29:04] remember now when I pray for these tanks
[29:06] ships do you remember brother Dow he's
[29:08] the precious brother and we want to
[29:10] remember him in prayer and I see brother
[29:13] Agron but I can't see sister Unger in
[29:16] anywhere whether she's all right now yes

[31:45] charge of this Tabernacle honor the Holy
[31:48] Spirit and he's left here and he
[31:52] believes this messages and teaches it
[31:55] just the same as I do all right
[31:57] and anytime she wanted you can see fit
[32:01] to come to here brother navel

[32:06] the great servant of Jesus Christ I've
[32:09] noted arm and Neville since I was a
[32:11] little boy and he hasn't changed one
[32:13] speck only got closer to God I remember
[32:16] when I first saw him on earth I was
[32:18] invited to his Methodist platform and
[32:20] when I come back here at the Tabernacle
[32:23] I said someday I'll baptize him his name
[32:25] is Jesus Christ I have enough here we
[32:28] used with the message not going on a
[32:30] real gallant servant and brother Neville
[32:32] goes too many strings and heartaches
[32:34] that he does his short you're at the
[32:36] Tabernacle but being that the Lord lets
[32:39] me have a little sight into people's
[32:41] life I know what he goes through whole
[32:43] lot of it see and he certainly goes
[32:45] under a lot of labor and strains and
[32:48] things and you new people here hold him
[32:51] up like Joshua Caleb who held up the
[32:53] hands of Moses as he's bringing the word
[32:56] love one another above everything
[32:59] love one another don't no matter what
[33:03] the devil tries to say now you're all

[33:43] that woman or ever hood is it pray for
[33:45] them and stick one with another and stay
[33:47] with your pastor see he's the Shepherd
[33:49] and you give Him respects he leads you
[33:52] through and cause he's ordained of God

[33:58] enemy will come and when he does it's
[34:02] clean that much closer together and the
[34:05] one that the devil is used in foreign
[34:09] enemy will either get out or come into

[37:48] receive a whole barrel full of that
[37:51] granite Lord our tape load that it might

[40:53] or I filled it in this year if God will
[40:57] help me will reveal and bring into your
[41:01] mind all these other things that I have
[41:05] talked on all through the days of the
[41:07] tabernacle why I have said what I've
[41:11] said and why I have done what I have
[41:13] done this is why now from the fifteenth
[41:18] birth who is the image of the invisible
[41:23] God the firstborn of every creature for
[41:27] by him we're all things created that are
[41:31] in heaven and that are in the earth
[41:34] visible invisible were they be Thrones
[41:37] dominions principalities powers all
[41:42] things were created by him and for him
[41:48] and he is before all things and by him
[41:53] all things consist
[41:55] and he is the head of the body the
[41:59] church who is the beginning the
[42:03] firstborn from the dead that in all
[42:07] things he might have the prim poor heed
[42:12] please the father that in him should be
[42:15] all fullness dwell should all fall as
[42:19] well let me put a little emphasis on
[42:22] that again this nineteenth birth bar it
[42:26] pleased the father that in him should
[42:28] all fullness dwell and having made peace
[42:35] through the blood of his cross by him to
[42:39] reconcile all things and to himself by
[42:43] him I say whether they be things in
[42:46] earth or things in heaven watch what
[42:48] that reconciliation went and you that
[42:52] were sometimes alienated and enemies in
[42:55] your mind by wicked works you now has he
[43:00] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[43:04] through death to present you holy
[43:07] unblameable approvable in his sight if
[43:13] you continue in the faith grounded and
[43:15] settled and not be moved away from the
[43:19] hope of the gospel which you have heard
[43:23] and which was preached to every creature
[43:25] which is under heaven were loved I Paul
[43:29] made a minister who now rejoice in my
[43:35] sufferings for you and fill up that
[43:40] which is bound behind all the affections
[43:45] of Christ in flesh for his body's sake
[43:49] which is the church or rod I am made a
[43:53] minister according to the dispensation
[43:55] of God which is given to me for you to
[43:59] fulfill the word
[44:02] of God even the mystery which has been
[44:09] hidden from age and from generation but
[44:18] now is made manifest to his Saints I
[44:21] want to read that verse again even the
[44:25] mystery which has been hidden
[44:29] ages and from generations but now is
[44:34] made manifest to a saint the whom god
[44:38] would make known what is the riches of
[44:42] the glory of this mystery among the
[44:46] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[44:50] of glory whom we preach warning every
[44:57] man and teaching every man and all
[45:00] wisdom that we might present every man
[45:02] perfect in Christ Jesus I want you are
[45:08] also labor striving according to the
[45:11] working which worketh in me mightily now
[45:17] for a text I want to take out of there
[45:21] this for a text basing it upon the
[45:25] entire Bible but I want to title this
[45:31] Christ is a mystery of God revealed
[45:36] Christ being the mystery of God reveal
[45:39] now I took it in order as the Sunday
[45:42] School lesson so we could all read
[45:44] together and and have this fellowship
[45:48] together now God's secret mystery he had
[45:56] before the world began now back in the
[46:00] back part of God's mind there was
[46:04] something that he was trying and was
[46:07] going to achieve and he had a motive and
[46:12] doing
[46:13] in order to let himself be expressed
[46:17] because first there wasn't even a moon
[46:21] star atom molecule or anything he was
[46:26] gone but he exactly wasn't God at that
[46:30] time because God is an object of worship
[46:32] and there wasn't nothing to worship Him
[46:34] so in his great mind he wanted these
[46:39] attributes to be expressed and in him
[46:44] was love in him was to be father in him
[46:50] was to be son in him was to be a savior
[46:53] in him was to be a healer all these
[46:56] great attributes that we see already
[46:58] expressed they were in God so my opinion
[47:03] the first thing that he made was angels
[47:05] and then they worshiped him and that
[47:08] made him God and he started from there
[47:11] as in previous messages I have tried to
[47:14] explain it break it down and now then
[47:18] when angels begin to worship Him that
[47:20] was before there was even a molecule in
[47:24] the earth there was nothing it's all
[47:27] darkness there was no Sun there no moon
[47:30] no stars no nothing then he was God as
[47:33] he asked Jobe where was you when I laid
[47:35] the foundations of the world I think
[47:37] when the morning stars sang together the
[47:40] sons of God shouted for joy now where
[47:44] were you see way back before the earth
[47:46] now God had a purpose and a hidden
[47:51] mystery and that's why I want to speak
[47:54] on to the church this morning the hidden
[47:57] mystery of God that he had in his mind
[47:59] before the world ever began and how
[48:03] that's unfolded itself right down to
[48:05] this present hour that we're living
[48:07] thing then you will understand clearly
[48:11] then see oh I believe what is being done
[48:15] God's great mystery of how it's a secret
[48:19] he kept it a secret nobody know nothing
[48:21] about even the Angels didn't understand
[48:23] it he he didn't read me
[48:25] that's reason under our seventh mystery
[48:30] when the Seventh Seal was open they were
[48:32] silent Jesus when he was on earth they
[48:36] won't know when he would come he said
[48:38] it's not even the son himself don't know
[48:41] when it's gonna happen
[48:41] the God has this all to himself it's a
[48:45] secret that's reason there was silence
[48:48] in heaven first face the half hour and
[48:50] seven thunders are their voices and John
[48:52] was even forbidden to ride it the the
[48:55] coming of the Lord that's one thing he
[48:57] hasn't revealed yet how he will come and
[49:00] when he will come it's a good thing that
[49:02] he doesn't know he is showed or revealed
[49:08] it in every type that's in the Bible
[49:11] therefore the entire Bible is the
[49:15] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[49:18] hmm the entire Bible is an expression of
[49:21] one goal that God had won a purpose he
[49:26] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[49:29] and all the acts of the the believers in
[49:32] the Bible has been in tight and
[49:35] expressing what God's great goal is and
[49:38] now in this last day he has revealed it
[49:41] it shows it and God's help will you see
[49:44] if I here this morning what the Lord has
[49:47] had in his mind all along and has
[49:49] expressed it therefore you can see the
[49:51] great meaning of what it's been to know
[49:54] this and then try to bring it to the
[49:56] people see and then you don't I have him
[49:59] went into details to try to explain it
[50:01] as God has revealed it to me now if you
[50:05] want to mark this down I got so many
[50:07] places I want to read from and now in in
[50:10] the book of st. Luke the 24th chapter of
[50:13] Saint Luke we find out it's it is the
[50:18] two of the Apostles on the road to
[50:20] Emmaus and Jesus stepped out after his
[50:24] resurrection and they were on the road
[50:28] over to Emmaus going along the road
[50:31] thinking and talking and weeping on
[50:34] account of Israel is
[50:37] and how they seen him suffer for what
[50:41] they thought was no value at all they
[50:44] took their lord and crucified Him and
[50:46] and they were going along I weeping and
[50:49] he stepped out from the roadside and
[50:51] begin to talk to them about Christ he
[50:56] said old fools and slow to understand
[51:00] don't you know that all the prophets and
[51:02] the Psalms think what was he doing
[51:05] identifying himself to these apostles
[51:09] that all of the prophets and all of the
[51:14] song and everything was him expressed
[51:19] they I now the reason I never tucked to
[51:24] preach this morning must be called I
[51:25] thought in teaching we would understand
[51:28] it better than just to take a text and
[51:30] skip over it we just teach it he was
[51:33] saying that all the Psalms and all the
[51:36] prophets spoke of him well therefore
[51:40] that shows that all of the Old Testament
[51:43] all of the New Testament and all of the
[51:46] Psalms are singing the songs that were
[51:49] sung were sung of him take the
[51:52] twenty-second song and sing it and
[51:54] compare it with the morning of the
[51:55] crucifixion think my God my God why has
[51:59] thou forsaken me all my bones they stare
[52:01] at me they pierced my feet and my hands
[52:03] yet all those things there at them
[52:06] singing that song down there in the
[52:07] temple and crucifying the very one see
[52:09] see those great religious leaders those
[52:13] great man those great teachers and yet
[52:16] so blinded that was reading the prophets
[52:20] and was singing the songs and doing the
[52:24] crime that they said they would do the
[52:29] same thing is taking place this morning
[52:34] now listen close cause I ain't gonna
[52:38] even pay attention to what that clock
[52:40] says I want you to get these things
[52:41] don't you see
[52:43] so you can see here basically in the
[52:46] beginning
[52:48] the very thought that God had in his
[52:52] mind he hid it from all of those
[52:55] scholars and just a number of selected
[53:00] predestinated number a predestinated
[53:03] people was the only ones that heard it I
[53:07] now search back the scripture down
[53:09] through the age of the prophets and see
[53:11] if it was the same thing now that Jesus
[53:16] shared referring them to the prophets
[53:19] and the sound he said they all spoke on
[53:22] me see and hear these Jewish teachers
[53:27] rabbis doctors of the law professors had
[53:30] did exactly like they had done before
[53:32] now I noticed again he said search the
[53:36] Scriptures for they are they that
[53:39] testify on me search the Scriptures the
[53:44] scriptures the entire scriptures what am
[53:47] I trying to do to show you that this
[53:49] Bible is the thing it's right the other
[53:52] day standing a hospital room halkan
[53:56] sister it asked me to explain about
[53:58] denominations why we was against
[54:01] denominations with some denominational
[54:04] people you see it's got to come back to
[54:08] the word because the word is God I think
[54:12] and Jesus declaring the same year that
[54:15] the word is him you can't make the
[54:19] scripture contradict itself in the
[54:22] beginning was the word wars with God in
[54:24] the Word was God and the Word made flesh
[54:25] then now here he says search the
[54:30] Scriptures they testify on me in them
[54:35] you think you have eternal life that's
[54:37] true and they are the one that bear
[54:39] record of me and I'm bearing record of
[54:43] them if I do not the works that's
[54:45] promised that I would do that don't hear
[54:47] me but if I do the work so you can't
[54:49] believe me believe the works because
[54:51] they testify that he is the word
[54:54] oh it looks like it couldn't be any
[54:56] plainer thing all right now search the
[55:02] scriptures he said Moses and all the
[55:04] laws and so forth and the prophets and
[55:07] psalms spoke of a and again he said the
[55:09] scriptures testify of him he is the
[55:12] principal theme of the entire Bible if
[55:16] you read the Bible and don't see Christ
[55:19] in every verse of it go back to read it
[55:22] again if you can't see Christ in every
[55:26] verse of the Bible then you read it
[55:28] again because you missed something
[55:30] the Bible is Christ he is the word when
[55:34] you read in the beginning God created
[55:36] there's Christ see every from that to
[55:40] the Amen in Revelations is every word
[55:43] testifying of Jesus Christ
[55:45] that's why these added books that call
[55:47] the second Book of Daniel in the book of
[55:51] the Maccabees adds purgatory and stuff
[55:54] like that see it's not spoke up in the
[55:56] scripture see it doesn't theme up with
[55:58] the rest of it there's no place to place
[56:00] purgatory in there there's no place to
[56:02] place intersection of saints and things
[56:04] there's no place in there for that
[56:05] there's no place for a denomination
[56:07] there's no place for the Creed's outside
[56:10] of the of the Bible so when you see
[56:13] those things they just don't come into
[56:15] the picture and that's why people is
[56:17] added those and got there they're
[56:19] they're jigsaw puzzle all mixed up then
[56:22] they can't make it right same yesterday
[56:24] today and forever
[56:25] but if the things put together right
[56:27] there's an entire picture of the fall
[56:30] and regeneration the whole picture of
[56:33] creation of God's whole plan revealed
[56:35] right in Jesus Christ amen that's the
[56:40] whole picture set together every little
[56:42] crook and corner it's just like no I
[56:45] don't mean to be sacrilegious for this
[56:47] but if it's just like putting a jigsaw
[56:49] puzzle together that's why we got
[56:51] pictures today that looks horrible say
[56:53] we are believers the cow picking grass
[56:55] up on top of the tree don't work that's
[56:58] when they say yeah he's ever way but
[56:59] just of a certain he's same yesterday
[57:01] forever all but a certain things he then
[57:03] you ruin your picture the Bible said he
[57:05] is the same
[57:07] st. John PI or st. John 14:12 he said he
[57:11] he
[57:11] anybody he that believeth on me the
[57:14] works that I do shall he do also well
[57:15] that was for another age there you got
[57:17] your picture wrong again
[57:19] you got a man fishing out the desert for
[57:21] fish and a bunch of hot saying where
[57:23] there's no fish I had thing see you've
[57:26] got to bring you back to where he's
[57:27] fishing at Galilee where these plenty of
[57:29] fish you see they you you got to make
[57:31] the picture look right it's God's great
[57:33] picture is only one way you'll sit that
[57:35] when you see Jesus Christ there's the
[57:37] entire Bible he's the principal theme of
[57:40] the Bible are you realized in any of
[57:43] these places here you could take a text
[57:44] it's just hard for a preacher hold his
[57:46] peace you look like you want to keep
[57:47] going with it but you got to get back to
[57:49] what we're teaching on the Bible is a
[58:03] prophetic book it's a historical book
[58:06] it's a book of love it's a book of songs
[58:09] it's a book of life and in there you
[58:13] find Christ he was in the prophets he
[58:16] was in the Psalms he was in the history
[58:19] and he also in the Bible is the things
[58:23] that is to come so he was before enter
[58:27] after what that is that making day is
[58:29] the same yesterday today and forever and
[58:32] you inject something in there that
[58:34] doesn't make him the same yesterday and
[58:36] forever brotherly where do you go to you
[58:39] got an awful picture there for he was
[58:41] the history see and he is the prophet he
[58:46] is the Psalms he is everything and if
[58:49] you can't make him everything and the
[58:51] same word what's your Fisher the pike do
[58:56] you see it all right
[58:58] he is the thing he was the prophets he
[59:00] was in them he was in the Psalms he was
[59:03] in the history and he is the things to
[59:07] come the same yesterday and forever
[59:08] Hebrews 13:8 if you're right to them he
[59:12] should be then he should be the
[59:14] principle if that's what he is and we
[59:17] believe it don't we
[59:19] then if he is that then he should be the
[59:23] principal theme of our talking of our
[59:28] thinking of our singing of our walks he
[59:34] should be the principal theme of our
[59:36] life if he's the principal theme of the
[59:40] Bible and the Bible is in us then he
[59:42] should be the principal theme of
[59:43] everything that we do say our thing
[59:46] should be Christ that right all right
[59:51] since we think this since he's been
[59:54] meant made the head of all things to us
[59:57] the blushing Center here he's a head of
[1:00:00] all things to us for he was made for us
[1:00:05] which we are considered all things he
[1:00:09] said what about the sinner he was made
[1:00:10] to be the judge of the sinner if you
[1:00:14] don't accept it he was made the glory
[1:00:16] for the believer who does accept it so
[1:00:19] their thing all things is made by him
[1:00:22] and for him and it takes the night to
[1:00:26] express the glory of the day it takes
[1:00:29] the best-loved dishonor to express the
[1:00:32] the love and care for the vessel of the
[1:00:34] honored it takes an evil woman that
[1:00:39] would wear immoral clothes and his
[1:00:41] seller morals to express the virtue of a
[1:00:46] decent genuine lady it takes the crook
[1:00:50] and a thief in a man to express the
[1:00:54] genuineness of a real believer a real
[1:00:57] Christian it takes the hypocrite to
[1:00:59] short the believer what he is so all
[1:01:04] things was made by him and since he was
[1:01:10] made all thing made for all of us all
[1:01:14] things was made far by him then since
[1:01:19] that is true we should make our
[1:01:22] identification should be with him we
[1:01:26] should be identified ourselves with him
[1:01:29] because he has a dinner
[1:01:31] fired himself with us we should be
[1:01:34] identified with him how by living for
[1:01:38] him not just a confession so many people
[1:01:42] take your confession see I'd say it's
[1:01:44] got to this place now are you a
[1:01:46] Christian I'm Methodist
[1:01:48] oh that's a long ways to me even making
[1:01:51] yourself known as a Christian I look
[1:01:53] like the Methodist does I'm Baptist look
[1:01:56] what the Baptist does I'm Catholic look
[1:01:59] what they do see but the only way that
[1:02:03] you can actually be a Christian is for
[1:02:06] Christ to identify himself in you how we
[1:02:11] got some a stinger there I hope
[1:02:13] everybody on the tape gets that to think
[1:02:16] you say I'm Pentecostal that don't mean
[1:02:18] a thing it's Christ identified in you
[1:02:23] that's when he has recognized you it's a
[1:02:28] spoke of tongues Devils does too I
[1:02:31] shouted the Muhammadans Buddhas and
[1:02:33] everything shouts the Indians scream at
[1:02:35] the snake dance hey you're all right
[1:02:37] they all do cults clans and everything
[1:02:40] else screaming holiday hollers shouted a
[1:02:42] baseball game but when Christ is
[1:02:45] identified in you identifying itself in
[1:02:48] your christ-like which the word
[1:02:49] Christian means to be christ-like
[1:02:52] there's your identification
[1:02:54] all right now and since he is our
[1:02:59] identification then we should be
[1:03:02] identified with him by leading for him
[1:03:05] notice God has had a three full purpose
[1:03:11] in this great mystery secret God in His
[1:03:17] great mystery secret that he had before
[1:03:21] the world began he's got a three-fold
[1:03:24] purpose in it and now what we want to
[1:03:27] grow up on this morning is what is that
[1:03:31] three full purpose he I believe by the
[1:03:34] help of God who's present and he'll show
[1:03:39] it to it now if he had this threefold
[1:03:45] purpose we want to find out what is this
[1:03:47] threefold purpose the first thing was
[1:03:50] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:03:55] people he couldn't do it as a great
[1:03:58] Jehovah God who covered all space-time
[1:04:02] and eternity he could not is too great
[1:04:05] to ever be revealed to people because it
[1:04:10] would be too mysterious how could that
[1:04:12] great beam that never did began that
[1:04:16] after you went beyond the cycle of a
[1:04:18] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:04:20] trillions of years of life space and all
[1:04:23] out into the infinite into the eternity
[1:04:27] and a great creature that was all that
[1:04:32] is still in
