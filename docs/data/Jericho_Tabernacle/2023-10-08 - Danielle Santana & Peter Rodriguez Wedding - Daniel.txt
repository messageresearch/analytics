gathered here in the sight of almighty God and in the presence of family and of friends to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which is commanded of St Paul to be an honorable estate instituted of God and therefore is not to be be entered into unadvisedly or carelessly but reverently and joyfully in the love of God into this holy estate these two persons present present come to be joined together I ask the question question who gives this bride to this GR very well if you'd all be so kind as to Bow your heads that we could enter into a word of prayer Lord gracious Heavenly Father we thank thank you Lord for this beautiful occasion that you have allowed today for there to be this wonderful wedding ceremony father to be done according to how you have instituted Lord that this amazing couple has chosen to take that path forward we place this ceremony into thy hands that you would bless it father and bless them Father we ask you this in the precious name above all names that is the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may all be seated you look beautiful today look real handsome uh for those that don't know this is my little sister and he's been my brother since before and now he'll be my brother I want to read from the book of Mark chapter 10 and I want to read verse 6 to verse 9 and it reads but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are not no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put us under God bless the reading of his word god is so perfect in all that he does from the beginning of the creation creation of man God created man and woman and no matter how perverse the world has gotten today nothing can change what God has instituted he created man and woman in the beginning he created Adam and Eve in the beginning there are our first marriage they are our first example they are our first Redemption story of a man a man who loved his wife so much that he would literally give his life for her something that we're all trusting our brother Peter has had in his heart for a long time now and as we know as the years went on with Humanity the the the almighty groom came the almighty head came the almighty husband came and that is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that groom he died on the cross for each and every one of us and who is the US that we talk about he died for his bride his bride that he loved so much he loved her so much he took on her blame he loved her so much he carried out his sins he took the responsibility of her faults and placed them upon his shoulders all the qualities of a great man a great husband Jesus Christ came to display the perfect ACT of love he played out the ultimate Love Story the greatest love story in the history of the human race because what awaits us one day is a wedding like this wedding that we're having here today what waits for us that day is a marriage like today with a feast and a great celebration like the celebration we're going to partake in a few hours of a beautiful and wonderful wedding that God has put before us that wedding is the marriage of Jesus Christ and his bride just as our sister Danielle has been getting herself ready and I don't believe she has just started getting herself ready a few months ago but she'd been getting ready for a long time now because she's been waiting for that promise and then when God answered she had to get her her her Affairs in order she had to get her dress a beautiful dress as this with no spot and no wrinkles because that will be us one day his bride on a glorious day like this where we can take his name and take the throne next to our groom so as I said if anyone doesn't know by now this is my younger sister that's why I get so emotional and you know I I remember the phases of life with her all the things that I saw how I embraced her how I loved her and through those phases uh we just entered into another phase where now she's a woman and she's been a woman for a long time but maybe she's just now becoming a woman to me but she's been an adult for a long time and now she's going to be a wife congratulations the Bible says as we read a man shall leave his father in his mother and cleave to his wife and on the other way around the woman will leave father and mother and cleave to her husband now I can't go into all the details uh of this beautiful love story between Peter and Danielle but I encourage you from this day forward get to know these two invite them over have them invite you over and have some fellowship with them and get to know that beautiful story it had so many pivotal moments so many confirmations from God one after the other and I believe if you're here today in part of those confirmations I believe most of you are inside of those confirmations and I can see now how Peter and Danielle they had to stay home the way circumstances in their life made them stay home they had to tend to their parents and and as we could use the Expression they never were able to leave the nest until God made the shift in the Stars to pull this young girl from California out to Arizona God had to make another shift in the stars to pull this almost young man from the darkness of the world we have a good relationship but nonetheless to pull a man like this from the darkness of the world and bring him into the light of the gospel God is so mysterious he brought two men to make them so close as if they were brothers only to use them to paint the bigger picture to bring those two families of those two friends and bring them together through one's brother and through the sister of another to officially make these two families into one larger family so today Peter Rodriguez and Danielle Santana rodri Sana or as my father has been joking for the last few months Rodriguez Mrs Rodriguez today our precious brother Peter and our precious sister Danielle have come to no longer be Twain but to be one flesh for the woman came out of man therefore she is a part of the man and together with Christ at the center they are one and for all of us here both family and friends we're here as Witnesses and as advocates that through our presence being made the actions we extend towards this couple and the prayers we've extended towards this couple we say Amen to the word of God that what therefore God hath joined together let no man put us under let us now enter into the marriage vow Peter I want to read something to you will you petered will you have this woman to be your lofly wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love to honor to cherish support in sickness or in health in riches or poverty and will forsake all others as long as you both shall live I do amen everyone heard that amen Danielle Danel little
