you would like to turn with me to um straight to the scriptures to Proverbs 29 18 if we have any visitors we just want to welcome each and every one of you Bible says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he if you would like to turn with me to Philippians 3:13 14 Bible says Brethren I count not myself to apprehended to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Jesus Christ or in Christ Jesus let us bow our heads Heavenly Father first of all we just want to thank you for your presence Lord Lord you know we're not worthy of your goodness father we're not worthy of your presence to be here Lord but father you died on the cross on that day on Calvary Lord and father we have accepted your blood this night and because of that your Holy Spirit May dwell amongst each and every person here Lord because we are perfect in your sight Lord father I ask Lord that you just help each and every person here tonight that you may speak these um words of encouragement Lord that you may help the youth tonight and all those that have ears to hear father Lord we just put every person in your hands we ask you to have the preeminence as always we put ourselves into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated I just want to thank the musicians thank you very much uh these two scriptures they're um kind of different but my my title this this evening is uh watch the end and keep steady now now don't worry I'm not I'm not going to be talking about what's going on with Hamas and Israel it's a very very simple message I and I I just want to talk usually I I get too excited sometimes but I just want to have a talk and um this is geared of course to the youth but knowing that it's it's going to help each and every person here um the the reason I I got this title was from a message that brother brandham preached it was called uh discern of the spirit preached in 1960 brother brandham he talks about how there was a town there was a town that was holding this little competition for for the young kids they wanted all the bike riders to to go over there because they had this little plank that was 12 in long and it it was a few feet um it was it was a few feet long and they wanted all the kids to ride over it so all the best bicyclist all the best um kids that knew how to um ride their bikes they all went to that competition because if they can get from one side of the plank to the other then they can win uh a bicycle and it was one of the the newest nice I think they were called Schwin bicycles back then brother brandham says that all the greatest um kids that knew how to ride their bikes were there the ones that could ride their bike without holding the Hanah bars all the ones that could do the tricks they they all went to that competition and so one by one they went and they all fell off of the plank and brother bham said that there was this little old boy brother called him a mama's boy he he he wasn't like like um the other children but but he went and he saw how everybody failed and how they fell and he got on his bike and he began to ride and he went from the beginning all the way to the end and all of the kids they were surrounded him and and they asked him how how did you make it how did you make it all the way to the end without falling now brother bham says this in the message Mage he says uh let's see he says um well okay well then he told him he's like well I watched every single one of you and I saw that you guys were looking at the the bicycle wheels I I saw how close you're getting to the to the edge and you were keeping an eye on what you were [Music] doing but he said all I did he said I kept my eyes to the end and I kept steady brother bam says that's what we're to do don't look at these little things now did this one do this or that one do that he says watch the end and keep steady Christ is coming watch the end just keep steady don't go don't notice what's going on now watch what's going on out yonder at the end time when we're going to have to stand and give an account for our lives brother that reminded me of of Peter whenever he started drowning because he saw all the waves he had he had the courage to step out of the boat he had the courage to accept accept Christ's um word when Christ said come to me and he went and he began to step into Miracles that's what Christians do every single day is a miracle for you you guys step into from Miracle to Miracle to miracle every step was on that water but because how how bad the waves were brother Bram already said that those were demon possessed waves so when he began to see those demons around him and he began to see those problems and he began to see um the bicycle wheel he began to drown because he had he has to keep his eyes on Jesus that's the only way we can go from here to there is that we keep our eyes on Jesus there's this little quote um from the message come follow me um I I wanted to send it to our brother Angel pinea and then when I started to listen or watch it it it really inspired me to read this today it's in the message come follow me 1963 he said Lord Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow there's there's men and women here for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow he says we must train them Lord we fill that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow if there is not then today is the day there is people men and women of tomorrow here today and if there is a tomorrow you'll be taking that torch that if there's a tomorrow you'll be growing and you'll be having children you'll be having family you'll be having careers and all these things if there is a tomorrow when when I was young and I was in school I I truly believed that I was never going to be able to graduate in 2009 I I was like nope I'm never going to graduate the Rapture is taking place and then when I graduated I believed I would never have children or be married or anything why the Rapture is at hand it's any moment it could happen tomorrow it could happen tonight and and you you start thinking those things well I'm never going to graduate I'm never getting getting married and then I I thought it kind of selfishly also like man I'm never going to be able to get married man I'm never going to graduate and I have my own car now I see myself I'm 32 and I'm serving the lord and and and if I would have never graduated if the Rapture would have took place I would have never been saved because I I gave my heart to the Lord at at 19 years old I would have never met my wife I I I would have never had children I would have never been able to serve God and his people time continued on even though we think it's tomorrow it's tomorrow then we wake up and we realize how old we are we we realize that that time has went on and we're still waiting for tomorrow we're still waiting for the Rapture and a lot of times a lot of times um it it'll paralyze a person it it scares them to from not doing certain things who remembers what what should have happened in 1977 many people gave land many people uh uh stopped working many people thought that the Rapture was going to take place in [Music] 1977 and then time continued on in 2000 we thought what was it y [Music] 2kk everybody wased scared because this was the end and a lot of times what it does it it stops us from from these Earthly Ambitions brother bam says in 1963 question and answers on the seals first of all he he had to calm the people down because at that time they were doing the same exact thing they said brother brandham should we go to Tucson brother brandom you know what I'm going to give my extra key to my pastor just in case I go to the Rapture and he can have my new car and and and many people said well brother should we move to Tucson should we sell our land brother brandham says said we must be a sane solid Christian see that I'm I'm up here to work up to the last minute I've got a job to do and I'll be right and I'll be right found faithful at my post of Duty at the post of Duty if he comes this morning I want to be standing right here in the Pulpit you say brother Bram If he if he was to come this morning shouldn't you be out there no sir this is my post of Duty I'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things I am then when he comes I'll just move right on out with him see he says if I'm hoing potato if you're going to college if you're working if you're trying to make a career if you got if you got Ambitions and dreams he says if I'm hoing potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as hard as I can and when he when he comes I'll just drop that hole and take off and and we we've heard that quote many times that we live um like like we're going to live for a hundred years but be ready like he coming tonight and and and if I had um uh uh any uh advice to give it's it's fulfill your goals do what you what what you have in your heart many many people have Ambitions and goals and careers certain things that they want to accomplish and that's okay if we have certain visions for our life brother brandham says do that to the very last second it's make a goal for your life um young people you guys um many of you have graduated many of you are are going to graduate make a goal for your life but but when you put Christ in the center of that goal everything is is in equilibrium you don't go too much this way or you don't go too much that way you'll be the best at at what you do in your job not for anybody else but you do your job with with Thanksgiving you be the best student that that there ever ever is not for anybody else not for Jesus Christ you put him in the center watch watch yourself prosper in your job everything that you do just like Joseph even whenever he was in prison even when all of his brothers turned their back on him go he had a vision he had a vision saying one of these days I'm going to be standing on the right hand of that Throne he had a vision and when you have a vision everything becomes very very clear everything becomes very simple when we don't have visions we don't know where to go when we don't have visions we we don't know what to do we're we're all confused but when you have a vision for your life then everything becomes easy now the greatest ambition brother brandham says it continues on in the message come follow me and he and he's praying for the young people here these young people were about to graduate he preaches this message come follow me and now he's praying for them after the the the message he says that voice is still alive tonight and there's still post outposts listening posts receiving stations of faith that can accept it we we pray that each one of these children receive it receive that Lord in their hearts and remember remember that not what they um what they do to be good but they God does not judge us uh by what we do but by what we have accepted God doesn't judge us by our our works we are saved by our faith and not in our works so we pray heavenly father now I want you to pay attention to this part that they'll catch the vision now and see and hear the great Eternal invitation of come follow me the best thing to do is have a goal to have a vision of your life but the greatest vision for for you young people if you can catch this vision and hear this great Eternal invitation of come follow me then you're not looking at here or there your vision is in Christ Jesus and then everything work school family if if um there's a a girl you're interested or a boy you're interested in if if you're going on to the next chapter of your life everything is calibrated by that Vision everything is is the standard is that vision for everything amen Amen brother bam says another thing in the message as the eagle stth up her nest another thing the Church of the Living God is built uh or um is built high because it's got high anticipations and expectations say well we belong to the church Our Father served in this church years ago that might be fine but the Church of the Living God can't sit still its Ambitions is to go higher farther brother there's people with the greatest Ambitions in the world that they can see clearly how they can become a millionaire how they can control many many things and be CEOs and and and be uh Builders of of great things Visionaries but the greatest ambition is in the church because where our Ambitions aren't on the things that are going to fade away when you decide to trust in Jesus when you decided saying Lord I accept your blood I did I made my decision to serve you Lord you made the greatest decision and now you have the greatest ambition you have the greatest vision because it goes past work it goes past all the exciting things of the world it goes Plum into eternity that's the greatest Vision we could have and a lot of us here sitting today we've made our decision we've made our decision to serve the Lord we were in sin but the Lord took us out of that condition many people have given their heart to God years and years ago and they're solid in their position in Christ see see uh the Christian Life it's a journey that's why we we always talk about the three stages of Grace we talk about how how you have to the be in the Statue of a perfect man that it's steps and Journeys it's a pathway and many people are far into that pathway and there is many that that have just started there is many that have just been converted and and come to Jesus Christ and and I know sometimes we can think how can I come into this Perfection if I still need the Holy Ghost people are saying that Jesus might come tomorrow yet I still need to receive my holy spirit yet I I still feel like I need to be sealed sometimes I'm not patient sometimes I feel like I don't have the sufficient faith and then we could see that vision of eternal life the vision of whatever might be out yonder and then compare oursel in our present condition and say how am I going to go from here to all the way over there when Jesus Christ might be coming tomorrow night why Jesus might be coming tonight and yet I'm right here yet yet just I've given my heart to the Lord and I'm sincere and the fact that we are between these things of what shall be and what is it can create Agony in a person's life it can create uh uh complexes in somebody saying saying well how how how can I reach to that level of perfection but in Philippians 16 the Bible says being confident of this very thing that he that which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ [Music] if God called you he's got to finish the work if he started a work in you he's he has to because the he has to finish the work because the reason why I'm where I'm at even though sometimes it doesn't feel like very much it's not because of my merits it's by Grace by Grace you are saved and if by Grace you are saved by grace you'll receive justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost one thing I've always appreciated what brother Bernie preached on the three stages of Grace that he says it's three stages of one Grace you can only make those stages you can only walk you can only move forward you can only Advance as a Christian by grace and if by Grace you are saved by grace he'll see you through by grace and and I I heard my precious um Michael my precious brother Michael always talking about the 11th Hour worker that's in this time that we're living in that's what's going on that there's many people that have lived long lives that that have left the denomination that had to leave all those denominational thoughts and come into the realization of this message and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost receive the unadulterated word see the manifestation of God in them and then somebody that just given their heart to the Lord just today can receive those same blessings that that person took 50 years to receive you can receive that Revelation tonight because those workers they worked all day long but when whenever the evening time came there was 11th Hour workers that received the same reward as those that worked all night or all day by faith you are saved and I don't know how I don't know how we'll get to that point but we know by Grace he took me out by Grace he'll take me on just as long as you keep your eyes on Jesus don't keep it on anything else and if if there's something that you desire to do base that that decision on Jesus Christ make Jesus Christ the standard make Jesus Christ the standard of of a person that you're talking to you're interested in make Jesus Christ a standard of any career decision you make then it doesn't matter if you're there in school if you're there in the farm like brother Bram says work to the very last second and God is faithful to call you because you've done everything you've believed in him you've kept your eyes on Jesus Christ and whatever stage that you're in it's okay that you're in that stage it's okay that you're you're in a a certain place that God has put you in God called the children of Israel out of Egypt that was good but then they kept going God put them in the Red Sea that's good but they kept going it's okay that you're in a stage that you're in today but let's not remain there because in order for us to reach our goal we we have to uh keep in mind we we have to keep our eyes focused on the goal Paul he had a vision and he had a goal ahead of him and he let us know that he kept his eyes on that goal he this man that that has done many many things the Bible says that he went up to the third Heavens he was he was the the first Apostle in in the church ages he was he was he was such a great man yet when he be to write to these people he said I count not myself to apprehend I I haven't reached it yet now this guy you could basically say he could be raptured at any moment yet in his caliber he said I still haven't reached what I needed I'm still pressing I press towards the mark and whenever there's a challenge facing you you need to learn just to press on keep going because God has a purpose for his children God has given us a vision today and this vision is greater than any Vision that we could ever have in the earth Proverbs 29 I want to read it one more time he says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he where there is no vision what happens the people fall off of the plank the people begin to perish the the translation of vision it could be a dream a vision or a revelation re those that have that Revelation now we think when we think of revelation we think of something so high but it's whenever you have a Clear Vision or a clear look at Jesus Christ and he is your goal and whatever happens around you it doesn't matter cuz you're looking at him you caught the revelation of Jesus Christ brother brandham says he says I put my arm around him a real brother now this brother he asked brother brandham brother brandham brother brandham C can I see a vision can I have a vision brother Bram says I said beloved brother every time you open the Bible you see a vision God revealing himself here is God's Vision when you open it up and open and say God now open my eyes that I can see you the word is God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and and here's God every time you open the Bible you see a vision of God speaking forth to you set with a humble humble heart but you want to see your end goal you want you want to see the road map brother Bram says every time you open this Bible you'll see that Vision you'll see Jesus Christ vision is a look into your future your vision will keep you moving because you're looking at the destination you're looking at the end goal and it's something that you can't touch it's something that's not here yet but it's something that only you and only you can see and sometimes it'll it'll break families up sometimes your friends will reject you because they don't understand your vision sometimes they have only um chicken Visions visions of of how to be successful visions of how to be rich visions of of of beauty Vis visions of of all the goodness of this world that has to give and that's good we could have those things but there is a vision that is greater than any Vision out there it make you stand out it'll make you change it'll make you go to the Bible says the narrow way not everybody goes into that narrow W because it's a hard way but let me tell you what that it there's light in that way that you'll be going to a place you'll be going to a destination of eternal life but the Bible says it says when we don't have that Vision we perish now if we think we're going to die or or or something bad is going to happen that's what we think when we hear perish but that Hebrew translation it means to let loose to loose of restraint to go back to make naked to uncover whenever we lose that Vision we we don't have no more discipline in our lives now what I've realized there's a big difference in discipline without Vision because we can discipline ourselves we could look the part we could do everything we could to look like a Christian but if we don't have an end goal see I I believe a lot of times that that people lose their vision of why they're Christians they lose that Vision they just come to church because that's what they've always done they they it becomes routine it it becomes something that okay I just got to do this and um donate my two hours and we lose the vision we lose the reason why we're actual Christians and what happens is when we lose that vision then then we we lose the restraint when you lose the vision that's when you go off the path and and we can go and we can be doing things that like Christians do but it has no value because the only thing that has value is when you're walking in that path I could say I'm going to go walk home and if I start walking that way there is no value in what I just said I'm I lost track and I'm not going to reach my destination and and whenever we lose path in our lives we're not going to reach that destination because we kept we lost our eyes on Jesus Christ we have to keep our eyes on Jesus Christ but the Bible says he says but he that keepeth the law happy is he because the Bible and the word is the vision now we we we've got to um live intentional we've got we've got to make sure that that when you catch the vision when you catch that Vision you begin to live life on purpose everything you do is intentional remember when the little kids they they would hit one another my little boy sitting over there when he hits his sister and she oh she starts crying and it was on accident it was on accident she said no it was on purpose it was a it was he did it for a purpose he did it intentionally that's how we got to live life we got to live life wake up every single day and live life on purpose Brothers I'll tell you something about my life the biggest waste of my time is whenever I forget to live on purpose whenever I lose my eyes off of the goal Brothers God created the fish to swim he created the birds to fly and when you take them out of their natural habitat they're going to perish God created us in his own image to fulfill his purpose and when you leave that natural habitat we are bound to perish because so we every single day we have to live in our purpose even even every single person has a purpose to serve the Lord every single person has a gift to give to the Lord and you know what I've always noticed a gift is the easiest thing you can do why because it is you you were born to do it you you didn't have to um you didn't have to think that Jesus did this on accident no he was the savior he was born for to be a savior so whenever Christ is near you you have to expect that something is going to happen because that was his purpose to heal you to save you to restore you to give you everything you [Music] needed why that was his purpose and whenever he fulfilled his purpose he said it is finished and then he died you you know the most beautiful thing that I saw is when somebody says I've done everything I could and they get to go on to be with the Lord I remember when when my dad my dad he never cried in front of me he never cried I never see him I probably I could could count with my my fingers all the times I've seen my dad cry but that was whenever he was coming to the the end of his life he seemed healthy he seemed okay but but there was one time where he pulled me aside and he began to cry and he says I'm ready to go I I don't want to be here no more but he said but but the reason I'm here is for your sister now I didn't understand what what why he said that what he was saying but he was telling me that that was the reason he was there and then I would have dreams of him leaving but something was holding him back and then there was a point in his life to where he could tell me smiling he says your sister doesn't need me anymore and that that would that's very strange to me and whenever he left there was almost nothing for me to grab on to because it was almost like he said it is finished I'm done with my purpose I'm done with what I did and brothers I'll tell you honestly I he left and my heart was was okay with it our brother Johnny he passed and he fulfilled his purpose but Brothers with my ignorance I hurt more for brother Johnny than my own father because I in my mind I I said oh there's so much to do we got to fulfill so much things and when he left I know it hurt so many people because we saw the hand of God moving but the brother he he didn't leave without fulfilling his purpose God will not take somebody if he hasn't fulfilled his purpose yet he set everything in order so that we could take the Baton not not as a church as individually individually I could take the Baton of my father I could take the Baton of my pastor brother Nick you can take the Baton of brother Bernie we could take the Baton of brother Johnny Alo and we could fulfill our purpose and keep going not a not a purpose of Earthly things but Jesus Jesus that's the only purpose if we we revolve everything on Jesus Christ then nothing's going to fail around you because you are on the goal you haven't apprehended yet but you press forward you got to keep pressing forward and look towards that goal and one of these days you're going to see Christ face to face and you could say it and thank the Lord that I wasn't looking at the wheels I wasn't looking at the plank I wasn't looking at this or that I was looking at Jesus Christ and as
