[33:42] and God has given us a testimony
[33:46] it's nice to hear the young people give
[33:49] their testimony
[33:53] but it's so nice
[33:55] when you have someone that's been in the
[33:58] message for many many years
[34:04] I want you young people to notice
[34:09] we have Elders in our church
[34:13] and they have been here with the gospel
[34:17] for many years
[34:21] don't you love the Lord
[34:23] man let's
[34:25] let's open our scripture first Timothy
[34:28] chapter 5 verse 1.
[34:34] for those who know their Bibles
[34:37] and for those who do not know the
[34:41] scriptures very well
[34:44] this is the Apostle Paul writing to the
[34:47] to a young man
[34:52] you know he's writing a letter to a
[34:55] young persona
[35:00] and I want you to notice what the
[35:02] Apostle Paul is telling this young man
[35:08] rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a
[35:12] father and the younger man as Brethren
[35:15] this is
[35:22] the Elder woman as mothers the younger
[35:26] sisters with all Purity
[35:33] let's bow our heads
[35:39] we come Lord
[35:42] approaching your throne of mercy and
[35:44] Grace at this hour
[35:48] we thank you for the message
[35:51] we thank you for your word
[35:54] and Lord we thank you for the life that
[35:57] you have given us
[35:59] now Lord as we're going to speak for a
[36:02] few moments
[36:04] Lord may you open up our spiritual ears
[36:09] and Lord may we able to understand the
[36:13] scriptures
[36:16] or we might be able to read it
[36:20] but you're the one who can give the
[36:22] Revelation
[36:24] and Lord father may we place this
[36:28] service in your hands
[36:30] name of Jesus Christ
[36:33] amen amen amen you may take your seats
[36:36] real quickly I'm not going to take too
[36:39] much of your time
[36:40] um
[36:42] I want you to notice what the Apostle
[36:44] Paul just told Timothy said
[36:49] he says don't rebuke an elder he said no
[36:53] reprendas but in the fourth chapter on
[36:57] the 12th verse
[37:01] Pastor Paul tells Timothy
[37:04] Mateo let no man despise thy youth
[37:11] in other words don't let nobody make you
[37:14] any different because you're younger
[37:15] trying to serve the Lord
[37:22] and there he is encouraging
[37:27] and once he's done saying those
[37:30] encouraging words
[37:33] because sometimes the younger folks
[37:36] and I say this for myself
[37:39] I remember my uncle in
[37:55] [Music]
[37:56] I want you to tell me that you give up
[38:01] I want you to tell me it was a very very
[38:05] uh comedic a very funny man
[38:09] and that was the way he taught
[38:12] he said I want you to tell me that you
[38:15] you can't do this by yourself so I can
[38:17] help you yeah
[38:21] and I try my best not to say that
[38:26] I didn't want to give up
[38:28] all right stood an hour another hour
[38:30] trying to fix what the problem was the
[38:33] what was wrong with the car is
[38:38] all right you give up now
[38:41] all right I give up now
[38:44] but here is what the Apostle Paul is
[38:46] telling Timothy is
[38:50] just don't rebuke an elderly
[38:54] but take him as a father
[38:58] and the elderly woman
[39:02] as mothers how many can say Amen to the
[39:06] word
[39:24] [Music]
[39:27] you know they're already big trees
[39:30] they got big shade and big branches
[39:35] and they've probably been you know some
[39:38] trees have different scars in different
[39:40] places
[39:44] but those big trees we can lean upon
[39:46] them
[39:49] grab that fruit that they have produced
[39:55] amen I'm going to read just one quote
[39:57] here
[39:59] and I'm not sure if the brothers already
[40:01] have it in the back

[43:51] Brothers
[43:57] I'm going to speak a little bit of what
[43:59] has been
[44:03] the trajectory of my life
[44:09] in regards to me knowing the Lord
[44:16] I go back to the
[44:20] I go back to the year of six of the 60s
[44:22] 62 when I got married
[44:24] and um
[44:31] when my husband and I were about four
[44:33] years married
[44:36] that's when the Lord began to deal with
[44:38] us
[44:41] and
[44:47] is
[44:50] [Music]
[44:53] and that's when we began to have the
[44:54] hardest part
[44:59] to start off I got six
[45:05] from a very severe allergy
[45:08] um
[45:13] ass I got worse
[45:18] and the doctor still didn't know what it
[45:21] was
[45:45] did I have that I had to separate my
[45:48] children from myself
[45:50] and
[45:53] um
[46:03] and back then I didn't know God in any
[46:06] way
[46:10] the only way that I need to cry was
[46:13] saying my God
[46:14] yes
[46:21] when the doctor said that I had to
[46:23] separate myself
[46:25] for me that was impossible to do
[46:32] I cried the entire night
[46:42] foreign
[47:13] [Music]
[47:36] it started
[47:43] I Believe by then God was starting to
[47:45] deal with us
[47:52] [Music]
[47:57] six months later my my husband's mother
[48:00] my mother-in-law yeah
[48:03] she went to go visit us
[48:09] devout woman of the Lord she loved the
[48:11] Lord
[48:12] foreign
[48:14] [Music]
[48:23] [Music]
[48:37] my husband didn't want to know anything
[48:39] because he already came from the house
[48:48] okay
[48:53] okay
[48:56] yes
[49:05] but I did have the knee yeah
[49:13] because when I was younger I always did
[49:15] that
[49:17] much
[49:20] I didn't know much because I really
[49:22] didn't understand that much
[49:34] I heard the songs
[49:38] that's when I began foreign
[50:03] but then she
[50:10] he was very understanding with me
[50:14] it would help me a lot
[50:16] when the female says
[50:21] it was an Apostolic church
[50:27] I don't know how it's called uh nothing
[50:31] I said
[50:33] I just know it was an Apostolic Church
[50:37] a
[50:41] [Music]
[50:49] is
[50:57] but it was about Noah and Noah's
[51:00] preaching for them to
[51:01] [Music]
[51:03] repented
[51:07] and then afterwards
[51:09] but it was a message
[51:12] that's where God was able to gravel over
[51:15] my heart and that's when I understand
[51:21] the gospel was
[51:27] and that's when I remember that my
[51:29] husband
[51:31] yeah
[51:41] and when I heard that message
[51:47] it seemed that I was living in that
[51:49] present time
[51:53] [Music]
[52:04] made me understand more
[52:10] and when the message was over I was
[52:12] eager foreign
[52:23] but I said to the Lord
[52:28] I don't understand that much but I
[52:31] believe I believe
[52:35] and got baptized in that church
[53:35] and when we went back home yesterday

[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:28] God helped us
[1:01:32] um
[1:01:40] because my mother-in-law
[1:01:43] she was a Christian
[1:01:45] and she really loved the Lord
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:51] and speaking about God's word singing
[1:01:57] and you know reading the Bible
[1:02:01] that was very often that would happen in

[1:02:12] for two years at that house
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:20] but just as visitors

[1:03:48] Divine powerful man
[1:03:50] it's the message of the hour he's a
[1:03:53] prophet and all of that
[1:03:55] but my mother-in-law
[1:03:58] had already met the message
[1:04:01] through the brothers
[1:04:07] and another brother
[1:04:10] she had already accepted it
[1:04:14] and when that man passed by through
[1:04:16] there
[1:04:18] okay she said come over here
[1:04:21] she said can you show me that little
[1:04:23] book that you have because
[1:04:27] she showed it and it was brother Branham
[1:04:29] and said
[1:04:34] she said do you know this man and she
[1:04:37] said yes
[1:04:38] she said yeah she's a he's a mighty
[1:04:40] prophet
[1:04:42] and then
[1:04:44] she asked where are you coming from he
[1:04:46] said from Juarez
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] so then
[1:04:54] she asks what's your name
[1:04:56] and his name was macedonio facio
[1:05:00] oh yes
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:04] by chance do you know
[1:05:07] Juan Francisco a man that's named Juan
[1:05:10] Francisco
[1:05:12] she said yes he's my brother he's my
[1:05:16] brother
[1:05:18] where is he he's
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:23] also has he also accepted the message
[1:05:28] and then she got the address and
[1:05:30] everything
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:30] for 11 years
[1:06:39] we were very happy in that church
[1:06:43] he's a good brother
[1:06:49] he's such a he was a such a gentleman
[1:06:55] quite a bit of time from there the Lord
[1:06:58] my husband will go to the missions with
[1:06:59] them
[1:07:00] they would go to different places
[1:07:04] and that's when my children grow up also
[1:07:07] in that church
[1:07:08] so they were young be fair
[1:07:13] and it was such a very beautiful time a
[1:07:17] very beautiful time we have many trials
[1:07:22] and we would also struggle we would
[1:07:24] struggle
[1:07:25] yes
[1:07:30] we haven't wavered at all
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:38] always praising God
[1:07:41] and happy with God and with the Lord
[1:07:44] Jesus Christ
[1:07:50] last thing to know his word in brother
[1:07:52] Branham
[1:07:56] we were there for 11 years in that
[1:07:58] church
[1:08:04] what I want to give the testimony about
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:10] my third daughter uh
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:22] to get an operation on the appendix
[1:08:25] foreign
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:48] but it was actually the appendix
[1:08:53] when I took her to the doctors the
[1:08:55] doctor said it was the appendix that an
[1:08:58] operation had to be done
[1:09:00] but my husband by then was working my
[1:09:03] children were small
[1:09:06] and I was alone going with her alone
[1:09:11] and the doctor said at one o'clock in
[1:09:13] the afternoon
[1:09:16] so I went with the children with her
[1:09:20] then at 1 pm he wanted to operate on her
[1:09:26] but since my daughter she's uh she was
[1:09:29] very nervous
[1:09:31] when they gave her the anesthesia
[1:09:36] it wouldn't have any effect on it
[1:09:40] I think they gave her too much
[1:09:43] but she got operated on
[1:09:49] by the time that she needed to be
[1:09:51] operated
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:10:03] I was very desperate waiting
[1:10:07] I began to pray and pray and pray
[1:10:12] and I would say Lord
[1:10:18] I said Lord give me my daughter back
[1:10:24] giving my give me my daughter back
[1:10:28] those are the only words
[1:10:32] give me back my daughter Lord
[1:10:34] yes
[1:10:37] that's what was going on I didn't know
[1:10:39] what was going on
[1:10:45] a while after the doctor came out and
[1:10:47] said
[1:10:50] we had a setback with your daughter
[1:10:54] she said she had a cardiac arrest
[1:10:56] this is your daughter died
[1:11:02] but then he said she's fine now
[1:11:07] I said I'm sorry I didn't understand
[1:11:09] what do you mean
[1:11:15] your daughter died
[1:11:18] her heart stopped
[1:11:20] eat your
[1:11:22] make adventure and I was in shock
[1:11:26] s
[1:11:30] understand what was going on
[1:11:34] he said yeah but she's fine now
[1:11:37] she said the daughter came back the girl
[1:11:39] came back the girl came back
[1:11:46] to be able to massage your heart
[1:11:52] and I still
[1:12:01] [Music]

[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:15] it was something that was very serious
[1:15:22] and then I came here with him
[1:15:26] and I'm also amazed
[1:15:28] because God did America with him
[1:15:31] because Tony my son
[1:15:35] foreign
[1:15:36] [Music]
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:16:08] and then I took him to the hospital
[1:16:11] they took off the bandages
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:16] the doctor would ask what did you do
[1:16:20] because
[1:16:22] his skin is fully cleaning
[1:16:26] the healing began from his shoulders
[1:16:28] going down foreign

[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:03] foreign
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:51] to be here with him
[1:17:56] but I don't know what happened
[1:18:00] we didn't want to leave my daughter
[1:18:01] didn't want to leave my smallest one
[1:18:04] didn't want to leave
[1:18:06] her alone so that's the reason why we
[1:18:09] stayed here
[1:18:11] I don't know if it was time for us to be
[1:18:14] here right I don't know okay
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:23] these are just the highlights but we've
[1:18:25] had many trials
