[1:02:26] isn't he wonderful
[1:02:29] he's our special guest amen

[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:31] I love you
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:04:02] you know
[1:04:04] I believe with all of my heart
[1:04:07] the Lord Jesus Christ is present to take
[1:04:10] the preeminence in his church
[1:04:19] and I believe that tonight we're right
[1:04:23] in the place the Lord would have us to
[1:04:25] be at this time
[1:04:31] and I'm thankful for this invitation yes
[1:04:37] I am thankful for having my interpreter
[1:04:40] with me tonight
[1:04:46] if I say something that
[1:04:53] you don't like don't blame my
[1:04:55] interpreter see legal articles
[1:04:59] [Laughter]
[1:05:03] we might disagree sometimes but we still
[1:05:06] love one another you're gonna never says
[1:05:12] amen amen
[1:05:15] we haven't had any bitter disagreements
[1:05:20] but the prophet of God taught us that
[1:05:24] we should be able to bitterly disagree
[1:05:27] with somebody
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:35] that's the real Love Of Christ so
[1:05:42] um
[1:05:45] I thought tonight since you don't know
[1:05:48] me from Adam been sickness
[1:05:53] has anybody here ever met the first Adam
[1:05:59] I've never met him
[1:06:02] I've read about him
[1:06:06] but we have a saying in English
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:13] you don't know him from Adam
[1:06:17] but we know the second Adam right
[1:06:21] so I thought tonight it would just uh
[1:06:24] maybe just testify a little bit
[1:06:31] and I'm I'm following the leading of the
[1:06:34] pastor yes
[1:06:36] because he was kind of uh asking a
[1:06:40] little bit of my background and so forth
[1:06:46] and certainly we go by one another
[1:06:49] spirit is
[1:06:53] that right it's correct the spirit has
[1:06:56] to Bear witness
[1:06:58] but we're also admonished to say the
[1:07:01] same thing is
[1:07:06] perfect
[1:07:08] Unity
[1:07:09] was never possible until we received a
[1:07:12] perfect message
[1:07:18] so whether I'm testifying or preaching
[1:07:21] or singing whatever
[1:07:27] I want it to be in harmony with the
[1:07:29] Living Word
[1:07:33] the spirit the prophet and the bride all
[1:07:36] say the same thing
[1:07:43] aren't you thankful that God has given
[1:07:45] us a Divine interpretation of this noise
[1:07:51] we don't have to depend on anything or
[1:07:55] anybody
[1:07:59] but we're trusting in the Vindicated
[1:08:02] word of God
[1:08:06] he's our Center of worship
[1:08:10] amen amen
[1:08:12] so maybe before I start this when I a
[1:08:17] lot of times
[1:08:20] when I Minister I don't even title the
[1:08:23] message till I get finished because I
[1:08:25] don't know how it's going to turn this
[1:08:26] is
[1:08:32] but tonight I want to read a scripture
[1:08:35] before we testify Ernest
[1:08:39] let's go to Luke Chapter 9.
[1:08:46] if you'd like to stand in honor to the
[1:08:48] readings
[1:08:53] with verse 27. Lucas Verso
[1:08:58] mm-hmm
[1:09:04] but I'll tell you the truth there'll be
[1:09:07] some standing here
[1:09:09] which shall not taste of death till they
[1:09:13] see
[1:09:15] the kingdom of God but Oz
[1:09:25] and it came to pass
[1:09:28] about an eight days
[1:09:31] after these sayings he took Peter and
[1:09:35] John and James and went up into a
[1:09:37] mountain to prayers
[1:09:48] and as he prayed the fashion of his
[1:09:51] countenance was altered and his raiment
[1:09:54] was white and glistening
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:04] and behold their talk with him two men
[1:10:07] which were Moses and Elias yes
[1:10:14] who appeared in glory and spake
[1:10:18] of his disease
[1:10:21] which he should accomplish at Jerusalem
[1:10:23] is
[1:10:30] but Peter and I that were with him were
[1:10:33] heavy with sleep and when they were
[1:10:36] awake
[1:10:37] they saw his glory and the two men that
[1:10:41] stood with him
[1:10:48] Gloria De Jesus
[1:10:52] if I could pause in the reading just a
[1:10:55] moment
[1:10:57] I want you to remember that the prophet
[1:11:00] of God taught us that
[1:11:07] Peter James and John get better of one
[1:11:12] he had Kobo of course was the church
[1:11:17] the scripture teaches us that is
[1:11:21] they were the the church the disciples
[1:11:23] that followed Jesus
[1:11:27] faith hope and charity
[1:11:31] but here in this most important event
[1:11:34] the church was asleep
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:44] again we remember in the Garden of
[1:11:47] Gethsemane
[1:11:50] one of the most important times
[1:11:55] the church was asleep
[1:11:58] so let's be sure that we're awake
[1:12:01] tonight
[1:12:05] verse 33
[1:12:08] and it came to pass as they departed
[1:12:11] from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it
[1:12:14] is good for us to be here and let us
[1:12:17] make three Tabernacles one for thee one
[1:12:19] for Moses and one for Elias not knowing
[1:12:22] what he said is
[1:12:38] Wally
[1:12:39] while he does speak there came a cloud
[1:12:43] and overshadowed them
[1:12:45] and they feared as they entered into the
[1:12:48] clouds
[1:12:55] and there came a voice out of the cloud
[1:12:58] saying this is my beloved Son here he is
[1:13:08] and when the voice was passed Jesus was
[1:13:12] found alone and they kept it closed and
[1:13:16] told no man in those days any of those
[1:13:19] things
[1:13:20] which they had seen
[1:13:23] Jesus
[1:13:30] let's pray
[1:13:33] Heavenly Father Celestia may you Open
[1:13:37] the Eyes of our understanding tonight
[1:13:42] and may we hear your voice
[1:13:48] Grant this in Jesus Christ's name
[1:13:52] amen amen you may be seated the Lord
[1:13:59] now this is quite a subject
[1:14:03] and I'm not going to try to to preach
[1:14:06] exactly on this tonight
[1:14:14] but we'll just weave in a few thoughts
[1:14:17] perhaps
[1:14:21] and for some reason my glasses seem to
[1:14:24] be a little blurry tonight so I can't
[1:14:25] really visualize everybody
[1:14:37] as brother as brother uh Steve been
[1:14:40] recognized by the Robinson
[1:14:43] Steve Robinson have you been recognized
[1:14:46] already
[1:14:47] and then the speaker tomorrow night is
[1:14:49] that brother Ron with you yeah
[1:14:54] brother Ryan is supposed to minister
[1:14:56] tomorrow night
[1:15:04] and so I'll save my little
[1:15:07] preaching message till Sunday morning I
[1:15:10] think they asked me to minister Sunday
[1:15:11] morning
[1:15:17] I'll try the testimony testified
[1:15:22] it's been a while and
[1:15:27] um
[1:15:32] how many people will give me 30 minutes
[1:15:35] raise your hands
[1:15:39] 30 hour two hours three hours
[1:15:44] we had all these up
[1:15:46] we can preach all night
[1:15:52] if the Holy Spirit would move in our
[1:15:55] midst in a very special way how many
[1:15:57] would be willing to stay all night
[1:16:08] we want the will of the Lord amen
[1:16:11] and uh
[1:16:14] now the pastor didn't give me any
[1:16:16] limited
[1:16:18] and reminds me one time I was
[1:16:21] ministering actually it was my own
[1:16:24] sister's memorial service
[1:16:31] it was kind of hot and the meeting was
[1:16:35] outside in a Park
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:41] so I told them if I start if I was to
[1:16:44] speak too long they could pull my
[1:16:45] coattails
[1:16:51] but I had pulled my coat off and left it
[1:16:53] in the Carmen
[1:16:56] [Laughter]
[1:16:59] so maybe these brothers back here can
[1:17:02] pull myself
[1:17:03] Hermanos
[1:17:05] if I get warmed up too much I'll just
[1:17:07] pull it off and hand it to him
[1:17:13] very good spirit here tonight
[1:17:17] I felt a very welcome Spirit the first
[1:17:20] and the only time that I visited
[1:17:22] previous to this
[1:17:26] amen so keep that good warm welcome
[1:17:30] spirit is
[1:17:33] if somebody tries to draw a circle and
[1:17:36] draw you out
[1:17:39] bigger circles
[1:17:43] you know little bitty children can only
[1:17:45] draw little bitty circles
[1:17:49] but the more mature you get it
[1:17:58] so as old as I am ought to be able to
[1:18:01] draw big circles
[1:18:07] okay
[1:18:09] so and then The Minister's meeting
[1:18:10] tomorrow so did you announce that
[1:18:16] um
[1:18:17] where's the location of that anyways
[1:18:27] okay and that's tomorrow
[1:18:32] how many ministers do we have president
[1:18:37] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:18:40] nineteen nineteen oh man we got a whole
[1:18:42] bunch of them
[1:18:44] all right so I know brother Steve has
[1:18:46] invited you to the ministry
[1:18:51] and he was telling me since uh we've
[1:18:54] been having the ministers meetings over
[1:18:56] here he's got an awesome 40 different
[1:18:59] um comments about how there's a greater
[1:19:01] Unity among the churches
[1:19:10] certainly the way it should be yes
[1:19:14] uh in the message entitled discernment
[1:19:17] of spirit
[1:19:20] the prophet of God said that
[1:19:23] any person who has the spirit of God
[1:19:26] will have the action of God and
[1:19:33] the action of God never breaks us up the
[1:19:36] action of God brings
[1:19:40] love one another amen
[1:19:46] foreign
[1:19:55] now we have some different quotations
[1:19:59] that we'll share and kind of weave it in
[1:20:00] tonight Lord willing
[1:20:02] difference
[1:20:06] but again I want to kind of go on the
[1:20:08] leading of the pasture
[1:20:12] he asked when I had come into the
[1:20:14] message
[1:20:18] and if I ask for a show of hands
[1:20:23] how many of you are in the message
[1:20:28] we'd probably get a majority of him
[1:20:32] but the real question is
[1:20:35] the message
[1:20:38] is the message
[1:20:42] and we must come to that place to where
[1:20:46] that
[1:20:47] we have an ear to hear
[1:20:53] and we must come to this milk
[1:20:55] Transfiguration experience
[1:21:01] the prophet of God said Lord bring us to
[1:21:04] this Mount Transfiguration experience
[1:21:11] and he said a mouth Transfiguration
[1:21:13] experience doesn't glorify Peter James
[1:21:21] it didn't glorify or magnify
[1:21:27] magnifico Moses and Elijah are Moises
[1:21:30] even though they were in their Glory
[1:21:34] but he said hear ye him
[1:21:38] it glorifies the Lord Jesus only
[1:21:43] glorification Jesus so we're here
[1:21:45] tonight not to glorify by any man
[1:21:48] because
[1:21:52] glorify any church
[1:21:55] but we're here to see Jesus and
[1:22:04] I um
[1:22:06] first heard of the message
[1:22:09] in 1966
[1:22:18] when I was just 12 years old I had been
[1:22:21] baptized by a woman preacher in title's
[1:22:23] Father Son and Holy ghosts
[1:22:30] I had enough of an experience to stand
[1:22:33] up and testify and say that I was saved
[1:22:36] experience
[1:22:41] and that was quite a challenge because
[1:22:43] my girlfriend was present that night in
[1:22:46] the meeting yes
[1:22:50] I was only about 13 years old but I had
[1:22:53] a little girlfriend you know
[1:22:58] and but I I thought what's she going to
[1:23:01] think you know if I stand up and
[1:23:02] testified
[1:23:06] but I finally mustered up enough nerve
[1:23:09] to say I thank God for saving me
[1:23:15] by the time I was 15 years old I was out
[1:23:18] in the world
[1:23:23] and it was only by the grace of God that
[1:23:26] he kept me from fornication or adultery
[1:23:28] foreign
[1:23:35] Cherokee Indian in part Irish siendo
[1:23:38] party Indio
[1:23:41] if there was a sin I thought it would be
[1:23:43] a sin
[1:23:45] is
[1:23:47] to say cathrop
[1:23:49] to give up
[1:23:51] in a fight
[1:23:52] if somebody's fighting you see see that
[1:23:58] and they're really giving you a phrase
[1:24:08] but we had too much pride pero Nosotros
[1:24:13] it was a sin to say calf rope
[1:24:19] foreign
[1:24:21] so I would fight at the drop of the hat
[1:24:23] and this is
[1:24:26] just High tempered
[1:24:32] and
[1:24:34] but you know God took all that out of me
[1:24:39] when I was now this honest confession
[1:24:42] good for the soul
[1:24:46] I don't like to have to say this but um
[1:24:52] I was drinking and smoking
[1:24:58] doing just about anything that I was big
[1:25:00] enough to do
[1:25:06] and one of my older brothers had a
[1:25:10] nervous breakdown
[1:25:15] and he did that because his wife had
[1:25:18] played the Harlot is
[1:25:23] I already had three little boys at that
[1:25:26] time
[1:25:29] and his father-in-law was
[1:25:32] pretty up in the aircraft building
[1:25:34] business in Wichita Kansas
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:44] even though I had already been to
[1:25:46] Washington State the far Northwest and
[1:25:49] around in different parts of the country
[1:25:50] yeah
[1:25:57] a Washington state Jesus lugares
[1:26:02] he asked me to come from Arkansas up to
[1:26:05] Wichita and represent the family there
[1:26:07] my brother
[1:26:14] and my brother was in the Saint Francis
[1:26:19] mental hospital in Wichita Kansas at
[1:26:22] that time
[1:26:28] in Wichita Kansas he's gone on to be
[1:26:31] with the Lord at this time
[1:26:34] but at that time he was so mixed up that
[1:26:37] he thought he had to sacrifice his own
[1:26:39] son as Abraham offered up Isaac is
[1:26:51] it wasn't my brother anymore he had a
[1:26:54] nervous breakdown he was really mentally
[1:26:56] upset
[1:27:04] so it throwed me into desperation to
[1:27:06] start reading the Bible for myself
[1:27:12] and out of a burden for him I began to
[1:27:15] pray
[1:27:22] I told Brother Fabio a brother uh
[1:27:26] otabio today
[1:27:28] it's not
[1:27:30] what you know it's who you know noise
[1:27:36] and so he got me on working for Learjet
[1:27:39] Corporation is
[1:27:48] even though I didn't even have a high
[1:27:51] school education
[1:27:53] the the high school and so I qualified
[1:27:57] as a sealer while I was working for that
[1:27:59] aircraft company
[1:28:02] but it was during that time
[1:28:05] that I felt the presence of the Lord
[1:28:11] first time in my life
[1:28:16] and the Lord
[1:28:19] began to deal with me yes
[1:28:23] I had bought a whole carton of Winston
[1:28:25] cigarettes
[1:28:29] on top of the refrigerator
[1:28:33] and within two weeks I was totally quit
[1:28:36] smoking
[1:28:40] no more drinking
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:44] and
[1:28:46] previous to this point of time I'd been
[1:28:49] watching
[1:28:50] these old
[1:28:53] adulterous movies on the television is
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:03] I remember one of the programs was
[1:29:06] called Peyton Place or something
[1:29:10] place and then I started reading my
[1:29:13] Bible
[1:29:15] now during this time I'm living with my
[1:29:19] sister-in-law
[1:29:23] and her three little boys is
[1:29:26] and she's evaluating me also yes
[1:29:31] and so she went and talked to my
[1:29:34] brother's psychiatrist
[1:29:38] and he said it's probably genetic you
[1:29:43] know
[1:29:45] establish
[1:29:50] he probably needs to be up here in the
[1:29:52] hospital also
[1:29:58] I wasn't the same person anymore
[1:30:02] amen
[1:30:04] something happened
[1:30:07] where I used to fight then I I can turn
[1:30:09] the other cheek now
[1:30:15] and
[1:30:17] then
[1:30:18] when I left Wichita Kansas
[1:30:21] to go back to Northwest Arkansas
[1:30:29] we stopped in Claremore Oklahoma paramo
[1:30:32] Sinclair Oklahoma that's near Tulsa is
[1:30:36] and a lady gave me a book entitled a man
[1:30:40] sent from God
[1:30:44] that was in 1964.
[1:30:48] the first exposure to the message
[1:30:53] but really that book doesn't really
[1:30:56] Place brother Branham in the scriptures
[1:30:58] so much
[1:31:06] and then after coming out of the well
[1:31:10] at the age of 18 I was drafted into the
[1:31:14] army and
[1:31:19] then after coming out of the army it was
[1:31:22] in 1967 it is
[1:31:32] speaking mostly in Arkansas Oklahoma and
[1:31:35] Missouri independent church in Arkansas
[1:31:38] Oklahoma Missouri and
[1:31:44] mostly trinitarian churches
[1:31:50] and
[1:31:51] then when I seen water baptism in the
[1:31:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:58] and I began to say that God was one
[1:32:01] person instead of three different
[1:32:02] persons
[1:32:07] I become a false prophet to all the
[1:32:09] trinitarians
[1:32:14] but at that time also I'd heard two or
[1:32:17] three of brother branham's tapes
[1:32:21] and I believe it was 1968 that I first
[1:32:25] heard brother Junior Jackson
[1:32:33] many of you have heard brother Branham
[1:32:35] speak of brother Jackson muchos used
[1:32:40] he was preaching over in Oklahoma
[1:32:44] a message entitled royalty introduced um
[1:32:52] and he began to show in the scriptures
[1:32:55] how that Jesus Christ was indeed royalty
[1:32:59] says
[1:33:03] and how that he never changes
[1:33:09] Isaiah 3 6 I'm God and I change not he
[1:33:12] said he's not Isaiah
[1:33:16] Malachi 3 6 malakias treses
[1:33:20] I'm God and I change not no Cambio
[1:33:24] Hebrews 13 8
[1:33:26] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:33:29] and forever
[1:33:32] Jehovah the Old Testament none other
[1:33:34] than Jesus Christ
[1:33:41] royalty must be introduced
[1:33:45] and he was showing how that John the
[1:33:47] Baptist fulfilled Malachi 3 even
[1:33:49] According To Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ to introduce the Messiah
[1:34:03] also Isaiah 40 the voice of one crying
[1:34:06] in the wilderness
[1:34:10] John's Ministry introducing the Messiah
[1:34:15] and how it was scriptural
[1:34:18] that's that's sure that's right in the
[1:34:21] Bible
[1:34:24] again to show how that he has to have an
[1:34:28] introduction in his second advantage
[1:34:36] and it's in the scripture yes
[1:34:40] Malachi IV
[1:34:41] malachias cuatro Luke 17 30. Lucas the
[1:34:45] associated Revelations 10 Revelation all
[1:34:50] these scriptures
[1:34:52] although I'd heard a few tapes from
[1:34:54] Brother Branham
[1:34:57] first time I really seen him as a
[1:35:00] scriptural vindicating
[1:35:02] problems
[1:35:05] I've been foretold right here in the
[1:35:08] Bible
[1:35:12] so that was 1968.
[1:35:16] I've never been the same since
[1:35:22] I thank God for brother Junior Jackson
[1:35:26] I trust we'll be able to spend eternity
[1:35:28] together
[1:35:32] but also on tape you'll find where
[1:35:35] brother Graham said brother Jackson
[1:35:36] disagrees with me
[1:35:40] Junior
[1:35:42] that's brother Jackson's problems
[1:35:50] and so where brother Jackson disagreed
[1:35:52] with brother Branham president
[1:35:56] I stayed with brother Brandon
[1:36:01] amen and where you disagree with brother
[1:36:04] Branham even those days
[1:36:06] I'm going to stay with brother Brown
[1:36:11] now we had we've had both the Old and
[1:36:15] New Testament for many years
[1:36:20] but today we have the Divine
[1:36:23] interpretations
[1:36:28] and so let's
[1:36:31] stay with the Vindicated
[1:36:33] message of the hour
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:39] and we'll comment a little bit more
[1:36:41] about that later God willing
[1:36:45] back to my testimony
[1:36:49] after leaving
[1:36:51] Wichita Kansas
[1:36:55] um
[1:36:57] uh
[1:37:00] was
[1:37:03] fellowshipping and a little independent
[1:37:05] Pentecostal Church in Northwest Arkansas
[1:37:07] is
[1:37:12] and I
[1:37:14] thought I fell in love with the pastor's
[1:37:16] daughter
[1:37:20] I was really inflatuated
[1:37:24] she could sing like an angel
[1:37:27] she'd come to the Altar and speak in
[1:37:29] tongues
[1:37:30] I thought surely I I found my
[1:37:34] control I'm missing rib
[1:37:37] foreign
[1:37:49] and the war was hot in Vietnam at that
[1:37:53] time
[1:37:54] in Vietnam and the draft was mandatory
[1:37:58] he is
[1:38:06] we talked about marriage but we wasn't
[1:38:08] engaged
[1:38:11] but I knew that she was willing to marry
[1:38:14] me if we decided to get married
[1:38:23] Lord should I get married or not
[1:38:28] now remember I'm I'm due to be drafted
[1:38:36] at this time
[1:38:38] and when I saw the Lord he gave me this
[1:38:41] scripture right here
[1:38:44] it's found in Deuteronomy 24 5.
[1:38:51] when a man had taken a new wife he shall
[1:38:55] not go out to war
[1:38:57] neither shall he be charged with any
[1:39:00] business
[1:39:01] but he shall be free at home one year
[1:39:04] and shall cheer up his wife which he
[1:39:08] hath taken foreign
[1:39:39] and so
[1:39:41] I said well at least the Lord don't want
[1:39:44] me to get married right now
[1:39:49] but I didn't give up
[1:39:53] that didn't take away my infatuation for
[1:39:56] this young lady
[1:40:00] and so
[1:40:02] when I was
[1:40:04] drafted into the military
[1:40:41] El Nido
[1:40:43] she had gotten married yes
[1:40:48] because she had got expecting out of
[1:40:51] wedlock and it was a shot young wedding
[1:40:57] what we call a shotgun wedding
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:05] and
[1:41:06] so by the time I came back she was
[1:41:09] available
[1:41:17] but her mother really wanted us to get
[1:41:19] married
[1:41:21] now here's the here's the really the
[1:41:24] truth of the thing
[1:41:27] regardless of all that I still have this
[1:41:30] feeling for her
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:36] I knew it wasn't God's programs
[1:41:46] even though I at that particular point
[1:41:48] in time I had not recognized the message
[1:41:54] yet I knew enough about the word of God
[1:41:56] to know that was not the will of God
[1:42:03] and when I found out the details of how
[1:42:08] she became expecting and so foreign
[1:42:16] I made a vow to almighty god
[1:42:19] um
[1:42:23] in my heart
[1:42:24] and I testified to it
[1:42:27] I'm not getting married period
[1:42:32] when I seen how close I had come to
[1:42:35] getting the wrong girl when the job
[1:42:37] Vehicles
[1:42:41] now even at this point in time I was I
[1:42:44] would wake at two or three o'clock in
[1:42:46] the morning
[1:42:50] thinking about this same girl
[1:42:54] it took God to deliver me from that
[1:42:57] infatuation or that feeling that I had
[1:42:59] toward her adios
[1:43:06] but when I come to realize how near I
[1:43:09] had come to marrying the wrong girl
[1:43:15] this is when I made that vowel
[1:43:20] and I I knew the importance of
[1:43:23] especially when you make a vow to God
[1:43:30] it's life and death
[1:43:33] and I said Lord God
[1:43:36] I'm not getting married period unless
[1:43:43] or until osta you speak to me in an
[1:43:47] audible voice
[1:43:49] and reveal to me that that's the one I'm
[1:43:51] supposed to marry is
[1:43:59] now that's quite a challenge
[1:44:02] and there was many times after that I I
[1:44:06] wished I hadn't made that vowel much
[1:44:13] yeah yeah but I kept the vowel
[1:44:18] and the vowel kept me yeah
[1:44:21] it kept me out of a lot of trouble
[1:44:25] muchos problems because
[1:44:27] I'm a young evangelist you know foreign
[1:44:40] in Miracle Valley Arizona
[1:44:48] when I let that was in 67 68.
[1:44:54] probably 69 when I came to first time to
[1:44:57] Arizona
[1:45:00] and I remember coming here
[1:45:05] oh my oh Baja
[1:45:13] I brought my dad because he wanted
[1:45:15] brother Allen to pray for him
[1:45:21] and
[1:45:24] I was driving an old
[1:45:26] about a 1960 model
[1:45:30] Chevrolet swiftwing car Joe you said
[1:45:35] um
[1:45:42] but it had been turned into a pickup
[1:45:48] so it looked like one of these Rancheros
[1:45:53] Rancheros and it was all beat up and
[1:45:57] ugly looking you know is
[1:46:10] everybody else was driving you know
[1:46:14] cars
[1:46:19] but during that meeting I got under that
[1:46:22] anointing
[1:46:26] and I actually vowed to give several
[1:46:29] thousand dollars
[1:46:36] to that man is
[1:46:39] respects to brother Allen
[1:46:42] but when he passed on I was delivered
[1:46:45] from that foreign
[1:46:51] [Laughter]
[1:47:11] that happened just before I recognized
[1:47:13] the message okay
[1:47:17] but when I left here I went back and
[1:47:19] laid hands on a Cadillac Cadillac
[1:47:27] oh it was a beautiful car hello
[1:47:30] two-door push button windows puertas
[1:47:35] and by faith I claimed that car it
[1:47:40] belonged to my brother-in-law
[1:47:44] and he gave it to me
[1:47:46] I didn't tell him I'd laid the hands on
[1:47:49] it
[1:47:51] but he ended up giving me that card
[1:47:56] and after being out here at Miracle
[1:47:58] Valley
[1:48:02] I started wearing all these pink colored
[1:48:05] shirts you know like they were Emperors
[1:48:10] back in those days you know that was
[1:48:13] popular
[1:48:16] bright colors
[1:48:19] brilliantes and uh
[1:48:22] I thought I was really you know
[1:48:27] some of the girls thought I was too
[1:48:29] loud
[1:48:33] especially when I was driving in this
[1:48:36] Cadillac
[1:48:38] a swift Wing is white and kind of uh
[1:48:41] kind of a blue white and blue
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:46] yes
[1:48:48] and here I am unmarried and I put these
[1:48:52] what they call Hollywood woodpecker
[1:48:54] pipes on it Hollywood woodpeckers
[1:49:13] so even though I'm serving the lord I'm
[1:49:15] under this wrong influence this is
[1:49:22] well when I
[1:49:25] recognize the message then and begin
[1:49:28] preaching the message in 67
[1:49:30] 1967.68 1960.
[1:49:36] well I I had to go to Jeffersonville
[1:49:41] I want to meet the family so
[1:49:48] um
[1:49:49] uh I went and stayed two or three weeks
[1:49:52] in
[1:49:54] radiant Jefferson be on the low Motel
[1:49:56] there if we if
[1:50:00] I think it was called Riverview hotel
[1:50:04] Riverview got to meet the family and
[1:50:07] visited the church and so forth and
[1:50:14] I want to try to condense now
[1:50:21] and I believe it was
[1:50:25] 1973
[1:50:28] 70 either 72 or 73.
[1:50:33] while I was visiting there at the
[1:50:36] Tabernacle visitable a young lady was
[1:50:40] introduced to me
[1:50:43] and I'll have to say it wasn't exactly
[1:50:47] love at first sight is but
[1:50:54] um
[1:50:54] her father was under brother John
[1:50:58] Martin's influence how many of you
[1:51:00] remember brother John Martin
[1:51:05] brother John and brother Earl Emmanuel
[1:51:08] and
[1:51:10] um
[1:51:11] so
[1:51:12] her dad was Charles Ray Davis
[1:51:16] Ray Davis living there in Southern
[1:51:21] Michigan
[1:51:25] and we wrote one or two letters to each
[1:51:28] other
[1:51:31] but I was afraid to get too close to her
[1:51:36] because
[1:51:39] and I even went and ministered in their
[1:51:41] home they would have meetings in their
[1:51:43] homes
[1:51:48] and so as I watched her spirit
[1:51:53] I I was really impressed because she's
[1:51:56] very quiet
[1:52:04] but this time she had had an experience
[1:52:06] with the Lord herself
[1:52:12] and
[1:52:13] so then as Brother Davis was Minister
[1:52:16] now I must weave this in all right
[1:52:22] um
[1:52:24] in those days I was one of the very
[1:52:26] youngest ministers in the message
[1:52:30] today I'm one of the oldest
[1:52:37] but
[1:52:41] brother
[1:52:43] uh I was living in Oklahoma at that time
[1:52:46] in Oklahoma uh Bartlesville Bartersville
[1:52:51] and brother
[1:52:55] um
[1:52:56] oh the brother a brother from Macon
[1:52:58] Georgia brother uh Palmer Palmer brother
[1:53:01] Jack Palmer El manude
[1:53:03] Jack Palmer asked me to come over and
[1:53:06] minister in in Macon
[1:53:11] and he took me right into his home and
[1:53:14] you know he'd he'd been to
[1:53:17] uh
[1:53:18] he knew brother Branham and been to
[1:53:20] several of the services
[1:53:27] and after ministering there for tertiary
[1:53:30] Services
[1:53:33] he took me about five hours further east
[1:53:36] over to Columbia South Carolina
[1:53:42] and they're administered at the church
[1:53:44] where brother Ned Iverson was the pastor
[1:53:47] is
[1:53:52] and not too long after that he resigned
[1:53:55] the church
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:54:00] and they asked me to come back and
[1:54:03] Pastor the church
[1:54:08] I said I I can't do it like that exactly
[1:54:16] but I said I'll come and Minister for
[1:54:18] you for a few months and then we'll give
[1:54:20] you opportunity to vote
[1:54:24] Ministries
[1:54:29] they voted about 99 that I should stay
[1:54:32] in pasture
[1:54:36] so I pastored since 1973.
[1:54:43] but I didn't know at that time that it
[1:54:45] was a church that brother Branham had
[1:54:47] been instrumental in established
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:54:59] a brother in our church there at that
[1:55:01] time had to ask brother Branham um
[1:55:06] should we start a church
[1:55:10] and he said get a building and follow
[1:55:13] the leadership of the lord well
[1:55:18] I had
[1:55:22] been
[1:55:24] it was 1975.
[1:55:27] I had already been pastoring two years
[1:55:36] Brother Davis had come down to minister
[1:55:38] for us
[1:55:42] and brought my potential wife
[1:55:47] so I had the opportunity to talk to her
[1:55:50] a little bit and to say
[1:55:52] and I said I've got to tell her about
[1:55:55] this about and
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:00] um
[1:56:01] we got a loan where we have a little
[1:56:03] privacy
[1:56:07] I told her about the vowel is
[1:56:12] that way she could kind of understand
[1:56:14] why I was we was a little bit I was
[1:56:18] distant from her yes
[1:56:23] and I said now you wouldn't want it and
[1:56:27] I wouldn't want it either if it wasn't
[1:56:28] God's will
[1:56:33] I said but now if
[1:56:36] if God would show me that you was the
[1:56:39] one
[1:56:45] would you marry me
[1:56:49] she said
[1:56:52] probably
[1:57:00] I said probably
[1:57:04] I was hoping for a more positive
[1:57:07] responses
[1:57:10] but I'm getting her committed
[1:57:14] and I'm still not committed
[1:57:19] so I could understand why she said
[1:57:21] probably
[1:57:24] but we didn't get engaged with that for
[1:57:27] sure
[1:57:29] okay no well I began praying because I
[1:57:34] knew there was this feeling in my heart
[1:57:36] for her well
[1:57:40] there was something special between us
[1:57:45] and I said you pray I'll pray
[1:57:51] and I was living in the back of the
[1:57:54] church at that time
[1:57:57] the address of the church was on Pope
[1:58:00] Street
[1:58:05] they said well you all must be Catholic
[1:58:08] your own Pope street
[1:58:13] I said yeah we're the original Catholics
[1:58:18] but I was living in the back of the
[1:58:20] church on Pope Street
[1:58:24] and at that particular time
[1:58:27] in particular I had gotten about 300 old
[1:58:31] reel-to-reel tapes from Brother tapes
[1:58:44] which kind seed s-e-e-d that's e-s-e
[1:58:49] seed like Abraham
[1:58:53] seeds at that time we felt like that was
[1:58:56] the main
[1:58:57] seed of the message you know the most
[1:58:59] important message is 300 of them is
[1:59:05] so I had a library in the church
[1:59:09] with all of these real-to-real types
[1:59:13] and one of the old Elders there in South
[1:59:17] Carolina that I used to fish with a lot
[1:59:20] you know the Los Angeles
[1:59:23] he really believed the message
[1:59:27] but he died
[1:59:30] and his wife didn't seem to have a
[1:59:32] revelation of the message
[1:59:36] so she gave me all 90 of his tapes
[1:59:42] so now I've got almost 400 takes
[1:59:47] and so I start listening to these new
[1:59:49] tapes
[1:59:51] and the first one that I listened to is
[1:59:56] secret sudden catch away of the church I
[1:59:58] think I've got the quote here
[2:00:01] is
[2:00:02] and I want you to see the quote here in
[2:00:05] a moment
[2:00:08] but in the meanwhile pero mientratanto
[2:00:13] I had a dream
[2:00:15] and in the dream
[2:00:18] all that was in the Bible
[2:00:22] was Cheryl
[2:00:25] her first name is
[2:00:31] and I could have interpreted that and
[2:00:34] say oh we go together like the Old and
[2:00:36] New Testaments
[2:00:43] but that wasn't my vow the resignation
[2:00:46] of remiboto was
[2:00:51] I would have to hear God speak in an
[2:00:53] audible voice and I'd have to know it
[2:00:55] was God telling me that I was supposed
[2:00:57] to marry this girl is
[2:01:05] you know when a boy falls in love with a
[2:01:07] girl he's loved A Dream anything
[2:01:15] and she might do some dreaming too
[2:01:17] but you have to be careful
[2:01:20] the prophet of God taught us the very
[2:01:23] best gift that God could give a man
[2:01:25] outside of Salvation is a good wife
[2:01:33] then the very best gift that God could
[2:01:36] give a woman outside of Salvation is a
[2:01:38] good husband
[2:01:44] amen amen
[2:01:46] and
[2:01:48] so I'm praying
[2:01:51] after I told my wife about the vowel I
[2:01:54] mean my wife to be in those days and
[2:02:03] she writes me about a five-page letter
[2:02:05] yes
[2:02:09] and he said Dear John yeah
[2:02:15] it was a goodbye letter
[2:02:20] God will never show you anything about
[2:02:23] me
[2:02:28] I'm unworthy to be your wife
[2:02:34] now she knew the message
[2:02:38] and she knew that a minister brother
[2:02:41] Branham said on marriage and divorce a
[2:02:43] minister is supposed to marry a virgin
[2:02:44] yes
[2:02:52] so I got to thinking
[2:02:54] what maybe she's not a virgin
[2:03:00] and so I called her up on the phone
[2:03:05] try to be very modest but
[2:03:07] cross-examining
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] she said oh no brother Hughes
[2:03:16] I've never known another man
[2:03:21] I'm just I'm just unworthy to be here
[2:03:29] I was hoping I'd get some kind of an
[2:03:31] answer on the phone
[2:03:36] but at the close of our say 30-minute
[2:03:38] conversations
[2:03:42] it was the same thing
[2:03:46] and God will never show you anything
[2:03:48] about me
[2:03:54] it was respects that she had for me
[2:03:59] her respects for God and
[2:04:05] so here I am now in
[2:04:09] in the back of this church
[2:04:12] in the bedroom of the church
[2:04:19] I'd gotten a new
[2:04:21] Sony reel to reel tape player
[2:04:26] um
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:35] and I'm setting up in the middle of the
[2:04:37] bed with my legs crossed and I'm playing
[2:04:39] this tape yes
[2:04:46] and I won't pull that quote up if I
[2:04:49] don't know what number it is
[2:04:55] maybe it's number one
[2:04:57] no no no it's not number one it's number
[2:05:00] two it's it's a one of two
[2:05:03] one of two
[2:05:05] okay and it comes from the message the
[2:05:08] sudden secret going away of the church
[2:05:10] yes
[2:05:15] okay I want them to put that on the
[2:05:18] screen if they can because this is very
[2:05:19] important
[2:05:24] and relative to my testimony
[2:05:31] okay
[2:05:35] okay now you've probably heard brother
[2:05:37] Branham speak about this incident many
[2:05:39] times on different tapes
[2:05:46] how the young armor uh
[2:05:51] Rancher's son was going out west to look
[2:05:54] for a wife
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:06:03] now
[2:06:05] now I got a pointer here somewhere okay
[2:06:07] good
[2:06:09] and that's your side and this is my side
[2:06:11] okay where's my what's my pointer
[2:06:17] everybody's still awake
[2:06:26] you know brother Brown said they haven't
[2:06:28] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[2:06:30] the true bride is awake and this is
[2:06:38] and here I am playing this tape now
[2:06:43] and I've been seeking the Lord about
[2:06:45] this
[2:06:50] and I hear Brother Branham say this is
[2:06:56] he said and he told me that you've
[2:06:59] waited
[2:07:00] and he worked El dijo
[2:07:03] and you've labored patient now that's
[2:07:06] that's the
[2:07:09] that's not the one I wanted it's record
[2:07:11] 147.
[2:07:14] record 147.
[2:07:16] that's this is part of it but that
[2:07:19] that's not in the proper order
[2:07:22] one of two is marked on the on there or
[2:07:27] who's doing that
[2:07:28] okay I'll just go back to it here okay
[2:07:32] yeah I'll just read it from here this
[2:07:34] just leave that one up if you want to if
[2:07:36] you don't have the other one listen to
[2:07:38] this everybody awake
[2:07:43] now remember those of you who heard that
[2:07:45] you know he was out there and they all
[2:07:48] these girls were trying to get him you
[2:07:50] know this Rick welding is
[2:08:00] singing with their six shooters
[2:08:08] and here now brother Branham says just
[2:08:11] imagine how those girls must have felt
[2:08:15] when they looked out their window and
[2:08:18] saw holding hands with that little
[2:08:21] despised cousin the man that they had
[2:08:24] tried to vamp
[2:08:26] with all their big fine frocks and
[2:08:29] Frills and carrying onions
[2:08:49] and he said will you marry me
[2:08:54] oh she said sir
[2:08:58] I'm not worthy Senor no soy digna
[2:09:03] that's the real
[2:09:05] Church
[2:09:08] feels about it
[2:09:10] that's the way the real Church feels
[2:09:12] about it
[2:09:16] I'm not worthy no soy digna
[2:09:19] if I could just wash your dishes
[2:09:29] I turned the tape recorder back I put on
[2:09:31] rewind
[2:09:35] I played it again
[2:09:42] something there huh
[2:09:44] so I I listened to it about three times
[2:09:50] you know what he said the fourth time
[2:09:56] surely you know what he said the fourth
[2:09:57] time
[2:10:00] the tapes always say the same thing
[2:10:05] amen amen
[2:10:09] you just be sure you're saying the same
[2:10:10] thing
[2:10:13] let me be sure I'm saying the same thing
[2:10:18] Lord are you are you talking to me
[2:10:23] okay and I had just oh how important it
[2:10:26] is to feed on those tapes
[2:10:31] how important it is
[2:10:40] because just a few days before that I
[2:10:43] had heard the prophet of God say this
[2:10:49] I am God's voice to you
[2:10:57] that's number one this is let's put it
[2:11:00] on the screen
[2:11:08] okay
[2:11:11] that first quote was from
[2:11:13] you know 58 10 12.
[2:11:17] now listen to this
[2:11:22] now I'm just your brother
[2:11:24] by the grace of God but when the angel
[2:11:27] of the Lord moves down it becomes then a
[2:11:30] voice of God to you all right
[2:11:38] maybe if I offended you by saying that
[2:11:42] because
[2:11:44] forgive me
[2:11:47] but I felt that might have been resented
[2:11:50] but
[2:11:53] I am God's voice to you
[2:12:05] the Lord
[2:12:07] there's my answer perhaps so
[2:12:14] I cut off the tape player don't say
[2:12:18] went into the altar of the church
[2:12:22] in the auditorium
[2:12:24] and I asked God
[2:12:27] and in prayer I said now Lord
[2:12:31] we can make the Bible say about anything
[2:12:33] we want
[2:12:36] um
[2:12:39] I'm not just hearing what I want to hear
[2:12:42] is
[2:12:44] or is this you speaking to me
[2:12:50] say
[2:12:52] that exactly Met My Vow
[2:12:55] it's a Sacramento
[2:12:58] because I had already asked her if she
[2:13:01] would marry me
[2:13:03] she had already said twice
[2:13:08] once in the letter and once on the
[2:13:10] telephone universe
[2:13:16] but I didn't tell anybody
[2:13:21] I got in my little
[2:13:23] Jeep
[2:13:28] in the spring of
[2:13:31] 1975. yeah
[2:13:34] I drove to Hardy Arkansas
[2:13:37] Harley Arkansas where
[2:13:41] that they were at a camp meeting there
[2:13:43] at rather Earl Martin's done the Earl
[2:13:47] Martin is
[2:13:50] the carpet
[2:13:53] and I got permission to take her home
[2:13:56] that night yes
[2:14:01] and I told her exactly what had happened
[2:14:07] she talked about the background of her
[2:14:10] life I talked about the background of my
[2:14:12] life
[2:14:16] and then that same night I called her
[2:14:19] father yes
[2:14:21] he was not present at that meeting he
[2:14:24] was in Michigan and
[2:14:31] when I called him up probably 11 o'clock
[2:14:34] at night he
[2:14:39] when I finally got him awake
[2:14:45] his name his first name was Charles
[2:14:48] like brother branham's father-in-law
[2:14:51] first father-in-law come on
[2:14:55] and since he knew the message I said
[2:14:57] well brother Charles would you like to
[2:15:00] step out on the porch I'd like to ask
[2:15:02] you a question is
[2:15:08] but he didn't catch the hint
[2:15:13] so I finally I said well what I'd really
[2:15:16] I'm asking for is I'd like to
[2:15:19] could I marry your daughter
[2:15:24] he said was son he said I don't know of
[2:15:28] another man in the country that I'd
[2:15:31] rather have as a son-in-law than you yes
[2:15:38] he said in fact God already showed me
[2:15:40] that he was going to be my son
[2:15:47] okay
[2:15:48] so
[2:15:50] I didn't stay for the meeting I went
[2:15:52] right straight back to South Carolina
[2:15:53] because I had to minister that Sunday
[2:15:55] morning
[2:16:01] I was supposed to announce that their
[2:16:04] Pastor was going to get married you know
[2:16:05] but we hadn't set a date yet
[2:16:15] and so I didn't I didn't announce it
[2:16:18] and we dismissed the service and we're
[2:16:21] standing out in front of the church
[2:16:24] and my song leader said I believe our
[2:16:28] pastor has an announcement
[2:16:34] and so then I told them that their
[2:16:36] Pastor was uh engaged
[2:16:43] standing right beside me but although a
[2:16:46] lava meal was Sister Arnett
[2:16:49] and brother Branham had interpreted
[2:16:52] several dreams for her yeah
[2:16:58] she said I could have told you that yes
[2:17:03] God already showed me that in the dreams
[2:17:08] but I didn't know anything about that
[2:17:11] respect but see you can't go by these
[2:17:15] we've got the word of God we've got to
[2:17:17] go by the voice of God
[2:17:22] and that girl
[2:17:26] that woman Yes
[2:17:29] somewhere and I often say my wife and my
[2:17:32] sweetheart is the same job
[2:17:37] we have nine children together uh
[2:17:43] I don't have any well I had
[2:17:45] um
[2:17:47] six daughters and three sons says he has
[2:17:51] is
[2:17:53] and all my daughters are married
[2:17:56] but I don't have any son-in-laws
[2:18:02] no son-in-laws
[2:18:04] they're all sons in Grace
[2:18:11] so from from that beginning there's 40
[2:18:15] 42 or 43 of us are going to be gathered
[2:18:17] together next week for Thanksgiving is
[2:18:26] and I'm so thankful that all of them are
[2:18:29] serving the lord except too yes
[2:18:34] and I want you to remember
[2:18:37] my youngest daughter and her husband
[2:18:43] they're not really serving the lord like
[2:18:45] they should right now I deserve your
[2:18:47] prayers
[2:18:53] three of my son-in-laws are ministers in
[2:18:55] this message
[2:18:58] and I'm sure thankful that they're all
[2:19:02] serving the lord
[2:19:05] and they're all in message churches by
[2:19:07] the grace of God
[2:19:12] just a little background seeing
[2:19:17] I
[2:19:24] your experience I know each one of you
[2:19:26] would have a a testimony how the Lord
[2:19:29] has dealt with you and so forth all
[2:19:31] right
[2:19:36] I feel like I shouldn't carry on much
[2:19:39] longer here tonight
[2:19:43] I know that brother Ryan is going to be
[2:19:45] ministering for us tomorrow night
[2:19:48] and so forth but I'm so thankful that
[2:19:54] you know God has
[2:19:57] has revealed to me I've got an absolute
[2:20:00] that's what I'm trying to say is
[2:20:07] in all serious could I have just a
[2:20:09] little bit more time just a little more
[2:20:10] just five minutes
[2:20:14] so what time it is
[2:20:18] oh there it is
[2:20:20] it's a clock back there somewhere I
[2:20:23] don't want to take advantage
[2:20:25] okay just a little bit more Poquito
[2:20:28] Tomas
[2:20:32] oh my we've got to share a few of these
[2:20:34] quotes
[2:20:37] a few of them here gunas
[2:20:41] this is so rich is
[2:20:47] number two I'm just going to read these
[2:20:49] off because they're having a little
[2:20:50] trouble getting them on the screen
[2:20:54] uh Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:20:56] and forever 1953.
[2:21:02] in the 20 years of research of the Bible
[2:21:05] and talking with the angel of the Lord
[2:21:07] and many things I find here two things
[2:21:16] that is
[2:21:21] now notice this is 1953 brother random
[2:21:25] makes this statement is
[2:21:29] and already he has 20 years of research
[2:21:33] in the Bible
[2:21:38] and talking with the angel of the Lord
[2:21:42] so that goes back to 33 right
[2:21:49] 33 43 53.
[2:21:52] 33 is when the angel of the Lord
[2:21:54] appeared to him
[2:21:59] okay he said I find two things love and
[2:22:01] faith and going through those courses
[2:22:03] and when love and faith gets married
[2:22:09] ask what you will
[2:22:11] and it'll be done for you
[2:22:15] I've found that to be so
[2:22:18] ES
[2:22:21] be not afraid 1960.
[2:22:28] now I regard you all as my friends
[2:22:33] Amigos and I do the same thing here
[2:22:36] tonight
[2:22:39] I regard you all as my friends and my
[2:22:42] brothers and sisters and I expect to
[2:22:44] spend eternity with
[2:22:48] Amigos
[2:22:52] and if you disagree with me on my
[2:22:55] teaching that's perfectly all right
[2:23:02] but I believe if you'll search your
[2:23:06] Bible real good you'll find out it's on
[2:23:09] the marks
[2:23:19] because first the angel of the Lord came
[2:23:22] to me and taught it to me
[2:23:27] then he showed me in the Bible where to
[2:23:30] find it
[2:23:39] do we realize what we have received in
[2:23:41] this hour
[2:23:53] oh
[2:24:07] number three
[2:24:13] Hebrews chapter 3
[2:24:15] 1957. everyday
[2:24:21] and he's actually referring back to
[2:24:23] Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 3 even
[2:24:25] though this is the Hebrews 3
[2:24:27] tape
[2:24:29] um
[2:24:35] in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 3 Paul
[2:24:38] had said how shall we escape if we
[2:24:42] neglect so great a Salvation Grande
[2:24:53] if that was taught by the Lord then
[2:24:56] confirmed by his disciples that we've
[2:24:59] heard Paul being the same how shall we
[2:25:02] escape
[2:25:15] now Paul was saying that to his Hebrew
[2:25:18] audience
[2:25:21] and they didn't have tape recorders
[2:25:25] today like we got here okay
[2:25:29] but they had scribes who was sitting
[2:25:32] there taking it down justice Paul was
[2:25:34] preaching it
[2:25:39] and that's what it is right here we're
[2:25:42] getting hit by tape recorders
[2:25:48] and that's what it is right here yes
[2:25:51] this look is
[2:25:53] we're getting it by tape recorders this
[2:25:55] thumb is
[2:25:56] and these tapes go around the world see
[2:25:59] yes
[2:26:01] show that it's the truth
[2:26:04] our religion is not in vain
[2:26:09] absolutely the resurrected Jesus Christ
[2:26:12] the same thing it's absolutely
[2:26:16] now we must neglect it is
[2:26:25] amen
[2:26:29] I'm just going to refer to this next
[2:26:31] quotation
[2:26:36] if there's a question about it I'll be
[2:26:38] glad to get it to you is
[2:26:45] brother Branham has been preaching about
[2:26:47] this male Transfiguration experience
[2:26:54] and when it comes down to his prayer
[2:27:02] he said now
[2:27:04] we
[2:27:07] we like Peter James and John could say
[2:27:11] Lord
[2:27:13] how
[2:27:15] good it's been to be here
[2:27:23] and we could say like they said let's
[2:27:26] build three Tabernacles
[2:27:32] and put Pastors in each one of themes
[2:27:40] but you said hear ye him
[2:27:45] then let us turn from these Moses and
[2:27:49] Elijah's so this is
[2:27:55] and pastors
[2:27:59] and the great man of the Earth
[2:28:02] because you said
[2:28:11] now here is the prophet of God saying
[2:28:14] this in an anointed prayer
[2:28:21] with the Revelation and the realization
[2:28:24] that he is the Elijah Prophet is
[2:28:31] yet
[2:28:33] he says let us turn yeah
[2:28:38] from these Great Men of the Earth
[2:28:49] because you said
[2:28:59] what are you trying to say brother
[2:29:00] Hughes
[2:29:04] I'm trying to point you to the only
[2:29:09] person
[2:29:12] that
[2:29:14] is important
[2:29:21] not you
[2:29:23] not me
[2:29:25] not even brother Branham
[2:29:29] he was only God's mouthpiece
[2:29:34] listen to this anointed
[2:29:44] now I want you to know this is sure
[2:29:50] I knew that listen to this tape
[2:29:54] you might have thought today that I was
[2:29:57] trying to say that about myself
[2:30:03] being that I was packing this message
[2:30:08] I have no more to do with it than
[2:30:11] nothing
[2:30:14] no more than just a voice
[2:30:18] and my voice even against my better
[2:30:21] judgments
[2:30:25] I wanted to be a Trapper
[2:30:28] but it's the will of my father that I
[2:30:31] declare to do and determined to do
[2:30:33] is
[2:30:38] I wasn't the one that appeared down
[2:30:40] there on the river
[2:30:43] is only standing there when he appeared
[2:30:48] I'm not the one that performs these
[2:30:51] things and foretells these things this
[2:30:53] happens as perfectly as they are
[2:31:01] I'm only one that's near when he does it
[2:31:04] just Implement
[2:31:07] I was only a voice
[2:31:09] that he used to say it
[2:31:15] it wasn't what I knew is
[2:31:19] what I just surrendered myself
[2:31:23] that he spoke through
[2:31:26] it isn't me
[2:31:28] it wasn't the seventh angel
[2:31:32] oh no oh no it
[2:31:35] was the manifestation of the son of
[2:31:39] manifestation
[2:31:40] it wasn't the angel
[2:31:43] his message
[2:31:46] it was the mystery that God unfolded
[2:31:51] it's not a man it's God
[2:31:55] the angel was not the son of man
[2:32:00] he was the messenger
[2:32:03] from the son of man
[2:32:05] the son of man is Christ
[2:32:08] he is the one that you're feeding us
[2:32:14] you're not feeding on a man
[2:32:18] his words will fails
[2:32:25] all right
[2:32:28] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[2:32:32] word of the son of man element
[2:32:38] and we're going to wrap it up tonight by
[2:32:41] saying this
[2:32:43] if you haven't fed fully sisters
[2:32:48] on every word
[2:32:51] to give yourself strength to Fly Above
[2:32:54] these denominations and things of the
[2:32:56] world

[2:40:02] of her good works or a good track record
[2:40:08] but it'll be rapturing grace
[2:40:22] also

[2:40:29] our love to him
[2:40:33] that would make us The Originators of
