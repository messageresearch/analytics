[21:57] pre
[22:01] God bless
[22:03] you um before I sing this song I wanted
[22:05] to give a short testimony so uh few
[22:09] weeks
[22:10] ago um my dad had the desire to go visit
[22:13] brother Po and uh I asked my dad the
[22:18] night before to sing a song to sing a
[22:21] special at his church and I had the
[22:22] desire to sing a special and um Sunday
[22:25] morning when I was getting ready I had
[22:27] already had my song and I was like okay
[22:28] I'm going to sing this song and this is
[22:30] the song I'm going to sing and then my
[22:34] mom told me she's like go get a jacket
[22:35] because it's going to be cold and so I
[22:38] grabbed my jacket and when I was leaving
[22:40] the house I put my hand in the jacket
[22:42] and there was a crumpled piece of paper
[22:44] of some chords to a song and I was like
[22:47] well I might as well just sing this song
[22:48] I already have it and so we went to
[22:51] Tucson and the I got to sing my special
[22:56] and the sister after me the song that I
[22:58] was going to sing she ended up singing
[23:00] that song so I thank God that he even
[23:03] though that I didn't get to sing the
[23:04] song that he allowed the song to still
[23:06] be sung and um we decided to save for
[23:10] the afternoon service and that night uh
[23:14] the brother who
[23:15] preached um his name was brother George
[23:18] Moore he came up to my dad and my dad
[23:21] told him what had happened in the
[23:22] morning and he said that he had heard
[23:27] that preaching or that song
[23:29] he had heard that song in Canada a choir
[23:32] sing
[23:33] it and it was exactly what he had
[23:36] preached about the song was called never
[23:40] a time and it was this exact same thing
[23:44] they had preached about and he told us
[23:47] that the night before on Saturday that
[23:49] he was praying because nobody in his
[23:51] church knew that song and that he was
[23:53] praying that someone would come and sing
[23:55] it and so Sunday morning I sang that
[23:58] song and God fulfilled his um wish and I
[24:03] thought that was beautiful amen thank
[24:20] you there's no one great Among
[24:25] Us where nothing
[24:29] on our
[24:34] own we make

[1:00:21] John this will be our sixth
[1:00:24] message
[1:00:26] he that have an ear let him
[1:00:30] hear and as a subtitle uh what is the
[1:00:36] truth and in this morning I'm going to
[1:00:38] read a couple of
[1:00:41] scriptures so I'm asking that you have a
[1:00:43] little bit of patience with
[1:00:45] me you maintain your Bibles
[1:00:49] open because we're going to be going
[1:00:51] through uh quite a few
[1:00:54] scriptures so in the Book of John uh
[1:00:57] chapter 18 uh verse
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:17] 37 pilate therefore said unto him art
[1:01:20] thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[1:01:23] sayest that I am a king to this end was
[1:01:27] I born and for this cause came I unto
[1:01:30] this world uh that I should bear witness
[1:01:32] unto the Earth everyone that is of the
[1:01:35] truth heareth my
[1:01:46] voice pilate say unto him what is truth
[1:01:50] and when he had said this he went out
[1:01:52] again unto the Jews and said unto them I
[1:01:55] find him in him no fault at all
[1:01:59] amen you may take your
[1:02:03] seats if you wouldn't mind keeping your
[1:02:05] scriptures
[1:02:11] open I don't know how you feel about
[1:02:14] when a preacher reads a lot of
[1:02:19] scriptures many times people have their
[1:02:21] own
[1:02:23] thoughts of what should a preacher be
[1:02:31] doing but this morning I believe
[1:02:33] everything should be founded upon the
[1:02:35] word of
[1:02:40] God not just this morning but every day
[1:02:43] and I believe that everything that we
[1:02:46] do should be according to the word of
[1:02:52] God and a certain time ago I heard a
[1:02:55] certain story
[1:02:59] that if the Bible of a certain
[1:03:01] person is falling into
[1:03:07] pieces what would be the reason or the
[1:03:09] cause for the pages to fall out of the
[1:03:12] Bible can anybody think of
[1:03:20] why if you see a Bible That's all torn
[1:03:22] up and falling into pieces what would be
[1:03:24] the reason to cause all of that
[1:03:27] damage because the Bible is very
[1:03:28] well-kept
[1:03:30] no because that
[1:03:34] person is constantly reading and reading
[1:03:37] and reading the
[1:03:39] Bible Turning Page from page to
[1:03:43] page I have a Bible when I first started
[1:03:46] I still have
[1:03:49] it that the pages were falling
[1:03:53] apart so then I had to stap back
[1:03:57] together and that's the reason why I
[1:03:59] have now a new
[1:04:02] Bible but then when I see a Bible of a
[1:04:06] person that's not uh written
[1:04:11] on highlights and doesn't have their
[1:04:15] highlights onto
[1:04:17] it and doesn't have any
[1:04:21] notes I could notice that that person
[1:04:23] doesn't really read their Bible
[1:04:29] but I think that if a person has a Bible
[1:04:30] that's just falling all all into
[1:04:33] pieces and they have notes everywhere
[1:04:35] all written
[1:04:36] across I could see that that
[1:04:39] person is not falling into
[1:04:43] pieces when I see a Bible that's falling
[1:04:45] into
[1:04:46] pieces that person that's reading that
[1:04:49] Bible is not falling into
[1:04:53] pieces but if the Bible is almost brand
[1:04:57] new then
[1:05:00] perhaps hear me close
[1:05:04] perhaps maybe that person is the one
[1:05:06] that's falling into
[1:05:08] pieces so in this morning I would like
[1:05:10] to encourage you ex you
[1:05:13] exort for you to read your
[1:05:20] Bible and in this morning we're going to
[1:05:22] be speaking about what is the
[1:05:24] truth
[1:05:30] so we see in the scriptures that Jesus
[1:05:31] came to speak forth of the
[1:05:37] truth and he was going to give testimony
[1:05:39] of it and so then if he's going to give
[1:05:40] a testimony then he's a
[1:05:43] witness so then in uh Revelations
[1:05:48] 15 it says Jesus the uh true
[1:05:53] witness to give testimony unto the
[1:05:58] truth everyone that is of the
[1:06:00] truth heareth my
[1:06:03] voice he that have an ear to hear Let
[1:06:06] Him
[1:06:08] hear and so then my question is today
[1:06:11] what is the truth or what
[1:06:13] is and we're having our Sunday school
[1:06:15] this
[1:06:16] morning what is the
[1:06:20] truth the truth are of certain fact
[1:06:23] events that have made uh in fulfill
[1:06:28] the things that are
[1:06:32] true and then me knowing this
[1:06:36] message and the prophet declares unto me
[1:06:38] many
[1:06:39] things if there is a
[1:06:41] truth there is also a
[1:06:44] lie if there's a
[1:06:46] hypocrite there is a genuine
[1:06:50] Christian if there's a false
[1:06:52] dollar then there's a genuine dollar
[1:07:00] and there's a lot of people that are
[1:07:02] more attracted to those things that are
[1:07:04] false and why is
[1:07:08] that why is it that they're more
[1:07:09] attracted to the LIE than the
[1:07:14] truth and forgive me for the saying but
[1:07:16] why is it that people are more attracted
[1:07:17] to
[1:07:19] Hypocrites than the genuine
[1:07:21] Christian why is
[1:07:24] that
[1:07:27] if Jesus came to speak forth
[1:07:30] truth and everything that is the
[1:07:33] truth here's the voice of the
[1:07:36] truth and so then what is a
[1:07:40] lie a lie according to the
[1:07:45] dictionary is to make a false
[1:07:48] testimony with the
[1:07:51] intention of uh lying to deceive or to
[1:07:54] deceive sorry
[1:07:57] a
[1:08:00] lie it's a false declaration that's not
[1:08:05] true but then that lie has an
[1:08:08] intention and what is that intention is
[1:08:11] to
[1:08:14] deceive now we're speaking about the
[1:08:16] message of the hour what did the devil
[1:08:20] come he brought forth A
[1:08:23] Lie from the very beginning
[1:08:29] and that same lie has gone throughout
[1:08:30] all the
[1:08:32] ages and now the prophet says what is a
[1:08:36] lie it is 99%
[1:08:40] truth and 1% a
[1:08:44] lie and so then a lie is not a 50%
[1:08:49] lie it has 99% of the
[1:08:53] truth but just a a certain small
[1:08:57] percentage that's been Twisted into a
[1:09:01] lie with the intention to
[1:09:07] deceive and the devil came forth to with
[1:09:09] the intention to deceive the
[1:09:13] woman may God help us this
[1:09:18] morning so the prophet tells us I didn't
[1:09:21] give you this
[1:09:23] call in the message adoption number
[1:09:28] he says that sin was not a
[1:09:30] creation no
[1:09:33] sir sin is a
[1:09:36] perversion there's only one
[1:09:39] Creator and who is that it's God okay
[1:09:43] okay all right so we're having our
[1:09:45] Sunday school
[1:09:48] here uh sin is righteousness
[1:09:52] perverted what is an adultery
[1:09:56] it's a righteous act
[1:09:58] perverted and what is a
[1:10:01] lie it is the
[1:10:03] truth
[1:10:05] misrepresented
[1:10:11] wow and so then we see that you're
[1:10:13] presenting to me a certain amount of
[1:10:17] truth but I want to present it to you
[1:10:19] the way that I want
[1:10:22] to may God help us
[1:10:26] so then what is a
[1:10:29] lie it is a
[1:10:32] truth that I want to
[1:10:35] represent what is a bad
[1:10:38] word it is the blessings of
[1:10:42] God converted into a
[1:10:45] curse instead of a
[1:10:48] blessing sin is not a
[1:10:51] creation sin is just a
[1:10:54] perversion
[1:10:56] uh Satan can't create
[1:11:00] sin he only perverted that which God had
[1:11:05] created I have a friend that told me a
[1:11:07] story
[1:11:11] once I might not say it the same way
[1:11:13] that he told
[1:11:16] me says that the truth was here and then
[1:11:18] the lie was over
[1:11:20] here and the lie was uh bathing in the
[1:11:24] pool
[1:11:26] and the light tells the
[1:11:28] truth truth come into the
[1:11:32] pool and the water is very
[1:11:37] warm he said liar you're very good
[1:11:41] liar I'm not going to get in
[1:11:44] there and he says come in I'm telling
[1:11:46] you the
[1:11:48] truth what what's the lie it's a
[1:11:51] truth
[1:11:53] misrepresented and he said come in
[1:11:56] so then the truth got a little bit
[1:11:59] closer and the truth had his clothes on
[1:12:02] had his suit with a
[1:12:05] tie his dress
[1:12:07] shoes he might perhaps had boots on I
[1:12:14] don't if he was from Mexico he might
[1:12:16] have had some crocodile boots I don't
[1:12:20] know but then the truth comes
[1:12:22] near and he begins to touch the water
[1:12:25] to kind of test it
[1:12:28] out lie you told me the truth it is
[1:12:32] warm and he said come
[1:12:37] in and and then in order for you to get
[1:12:39] into the pool you have to first take off
[1:12:41] the
[1:12:42] clothes so he took off his crocodile
[1:12:46] boots and he took off what he had and he
[1:12:49] began to get into the
[1:12:51] water and he began to get into the water
[1:12:53] with the with the LIE
[1:12:57] and when the truth hadn't
[1:12:59] realized the LIE gets out of the
[1:13:03] water and the LIE puts on the clothes of
[1:13:06] the
[1:13:07] truth puts on the suit of the
[1:13:11] truth and puts on the crocodile boots of
[1:13:13] the truth and begins to
[1:13:18] run and the truth begins to realize that
[1:13:21] the LIE had lied to him and he said liar
[1:13:25] you lied to
[1:13:26] me and you stole my clothing and he took
[1:13:29] off and now the truth was left
[1:13:35] naked and when he got
[1:13:38] out nobody wanted to come near the
[1:13:43] truth because nobody wants that naked
[1:13:49] truth nobody wants the truth the way it
[1:13:52] is RA
[1:13:54] Raw
[1:13:56] they wanted a little bit
[1:13:59] pampered but then when the truth
[1:14:02] is they don't want
[1:14:05] it but then they accept the
[1:14:07] lie that is
[1:14:09] covered in
[1:14:11] truth but it isn't
[1:14:15] truth it's only being
[1:14:20] misrepresented and so then Jesus
[1:14:24] came to give testimony to the
[1:14:27] truth and everybody that is of the truth
[1:14:30] heareth my
[1:14:36] voice we're going to go to the Book of
[1:14:38] Mark chapter
[1:14:41] 4 go to verse
[1:14:54] 21
[1:14:56] and he said unto them is a candle
[1:14:57] brought to be put under a brush brushel
[1:15:00] or under a bed and not to be set on a
[1:15:10] Candlestick loose for there is nothing
[1:15:13] hid which shall not be manifested
[1:15:15] neither was there any thing kept secret
[1:15:18] but that it should come
[1:15:22] abroad If any man have ears to hear Let
[1:15:26] Him
[1:15:27] hear and it's speaking about the the
[1:15:31] light if we have the light are we going
[1:15:33] to hide
[1:15:34] it what is that
[1:15:39] light and what is that light that we
[1:15:41] must
[1:15:43] manifest now we're going to go to the
[1:15:45] book of First
[1:15:49] John uh uh John 8
[1:15:53] sorry
[1:15:55] going to go to John
[1:15:58] 8:31 and it says like
[1:16:03] this and here we see Jesus uh talking to
[1:16:05] the
[1:16:15] Jews then said Jesus to those Jews which
[1:16:17] believed on him if you continue in my
[1:16:20] word then you then are ye my disciples
[1:16:23] indeed
[1:16:27] and so then we see that there's a very
[1:16:28] special key
[1:16:31] here if we continue in his
[1:16:36] word it's not that one day we're here
[1:16:38] and then the next day we're over
[1:16:41] there we must maintain ourselves within
[1:16:44] his word what does his word
[1:16:49] say you should not forsake the assembly
[1:16:53] as many have
[1:16:57] and there's many things that we must uh
[1:17:00] continue to do and verse
[1:17:04] 32 and you shall know the
[1:17:07] truth and the
[1:17:09] truth shall make you
[1:17:12] free there's something tremendous right
[1:17:17] there I come to give testimony of the
[1:17:20] truth and what is the
[1:17:23] truth is the Lord Jesus
[1:17:28] Christ and if and I am going to tell you
[1:17:31] the
[1:17:32] truth and you shall know the
[1:17:36] truth and the first thing that someone
[1:17:37] has to
[1:17:41] recognize is that a person is in the
[1:17:46] wrong and when a person thinks that
[1:17:47] they're always
[1:17:49] right then we can't help
[1:17:52] them and you shall know the truth
[1:17:57] and the truth shall make you
[1:18:02] free they answered him we be Abraham's
[1:18:07] seed and we're never in bondage to any
[1:18:10] man how sayest thou ye shall be made
[1:18:17] free and so then the Jews heard this
[1:18:19] phrase that Jesus
[1:18:22] said and they said we be Abraham
[1:18:26] seed and we are a blessed
[1:18:31] people and how dare you tell us that
[1:18:34] we're
[1:18:37] slaves and so in order for a person to
[1:18:40] be free they first have to be in
[1:18:44] bondage and I don't see any uh chains on
[1:18:46] my hands or
[1:18:48] feet and we've never been
[1:18:51] slaves and how do you say that we should
[1:18:53] be free
[1:18:56] and so then Jesus answers to
[1:18:59] them verely verely I say unto
[1:19:04] you if you notice that phrase verly
[1:19:06] fairly I say unto you every
[1:19:10] Prophet even brother
[1:19:12] Bram says this thus sayith the
[1:19:15] lord it's thus sayith the
[1:19:18] Lord is thus sayith the
[1:19:21] Lord but then when the Lord Jesus came
[1:19:25] he didn't say thus sayth the Lord he
[1:19:28] says I tell you unto
[1:19:33] you because he is the
[1:19:36] Lord he wasn't just a simple
[1:19:39] prophet he was the god of the
[1:19:44] prophets verily verily I say unto
[1:19:48] you whosoever committs
[1:19:53] sin is the vant of sin
[1:19:57] okay and so what is
[1:20:02] sin to smoke and drink no those are just
[1:20:05] attributes of
[1:20:07] sin and so then what is
[1:20:11] sin sin is
[1:20:13] unbelief of the word of
[1:20:21] God and so then if I believe just the
[1:20:24] certain part of the whole
[1:20:27] Bible or if I just believe 99% of the
[1:20:34] Bible but then when I come across a
[1:20:36] certain percentage of the word that
[1:20:38] begins to hurt
[1:20:42] me and if I don't believe it or accept
[1:20:45] it
[1:20:47] then that becomes
[1:20:50] unbelief that's to not believe in his
[1:20:53] word
[1:20:55] but brother I believe the whole
[1:21:00] Bible but just this certain part I don't
[1:21:02] believe I don't
[1:21:05] understand and I can't accept it so it's
[1:21:07] not that we can't understand
[1:21:10] it not if you can accept it or not
[1:21:13] accept
[1:21:14] it that's what it's about do you believe
[1:21:17] or not
[1:21:18] believe to understand it is a completely
[1:21:21] different
[1:21:23] thing I don't ask the Lord to be able to
[1:21:26] understand every single
[1:21:27] thing I ask the Lord to help me to
[1:21:31] believe that's why the prophet brother
[1:21:34] Bram in the scripture
[1:21:35] say help my
[1:21:39] unbelief because when we begin to read
[1:21:44] something and it begins to hit directly
[1:21:46] in our own
[1:21:49] lives then it be becomes to be a little
[1:21:51] bit difficult to accept
[1:21:53] it
[1:21:55] but if we reject that
[1:21:57] word then we're now in
[1:22:00] sin and we have now become
[1:22:05] bondage so then Jesus said You shall
[1:22:07] know the
[1:22:09] truth and the truth sh shall set you
[1:22:12] free now I'm going to give a curve
[1:22:15] here now the truth is going to set you
[1:22:18] free what is the truth it's the word
[1:22:21] it's the
[1:22:22] message it's to make you
[1:22:26] free but then when somebody rejects
[1:22:29] it what does that
[1:22:34] do we're GNA continue
[1:22:37] reading we're going to go to the first
[1:22:41] John first John chapter
[1:22:44] 1 verse
[1:22:50] 8 first John
[1:22:53] 18 if we say we have no
[1:22:57] sin we deceive
[1:23:02] ourselves and I think I've said it
[1:23:04] enough behind this
[1:23:07] Pulpit it's very sad when somebody
[1:23:09] deceives
[1:23:10] you but the even worst
[1:23:14] part is when you look at yourself in the
[1:23:17] mirror and you tell
[1:23:19] yourself you're
[1:23:21] okay you're
[1:23:23] okay
[1:23:26] just stand as you are you're perfectly
[1:23:30] fine and we must make sure that we're
[1:23:33] right on the
[1:23:36] word we deceive
[1:23:38] ourselves and the truth is not in
[1:23:44] us may God help
[1:23:47] us now we're going to go back to
[1:23:51] John John uh chapter 1
[1:23:56] verse
[1:24:09] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:24:12] among us and we beheld his glory and the
[1:24:14] glory as of the one only begotten of the
[1:24:16] father Full of Grace and
[1:24:19] Truth full of
[1:24:22] grace and truth
[1:24:26] now verse
[1:24:37] 15 John bear witness of him and cried
[1:24:40] saying this was he of whom I spake and
[1:24:43] he that came after me is preferred
[1:24:44] before me for he was before
[1:24:49] me and so then we find something here
[1:24:51] that's a bit
[1:24:53] peculiar
[1:24:55] uh something a bit
[1:24:57] outstanding he says that it comes after
[1:25:01] me but he's before
[1:25:04] me he's coming after me but he is before
[1:25:12] me and of his fullness have we all
[1:25:15] received and Grace for
[1:25:18] grace for the law was given by
[1:25:23] Moses
[1:25:25] for the law was given by
[1:25:28] Moses but
[1:25:31] Grace and
[1:25:34] Truth came by Jesus
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:40] Christ the law came through
[1:25:42] Moses the law uh had to
[1:25:46] come and a man by the name of Moses
[1:25:49] came but the
[1:25:51] grace and the truth
[1:25:55] came by Jesus
[1:25:59] Christ and now John
[1:26:08] 14 it's very nice to hear those pages
[1:26:14] turning John
[1:26:19] 146 and you know when you read it helps
[1:26:21] your mind did you know that
[1:26:26] that's why the prophet said that this
[1:26:28] generation is much
[1:26:30] wiser but more
[1:26:32] weaker have you noticed
[1:26:36] that almost all the young people are
[1:26:40] dying but all the elders are very strong
[1:26:44] why because they ate Genuine
[1:26:50] Food natural organic
[1:26:53] meat
[1:26:55] but nowadays everything is all
[1:27:02] contaminated I'm going to prephase it a
[1:27:04] little bit chopped
[1:27:05] up but you can go and search it
[1:27:09] out prophesy that the angel told Brother
[1:27:15] brandham don't uh don't eat the the
[1:27:18] white yolk from the
[1:27:21] eggs because it's going to damage your
[1:27:23] teeth
[1:27:25] and now you go out and search
[1:27:28] that all the natural food is now
[1:27:32] contaminated that's why it's so hard for
[1:27:34] women to get pregnant
[1:27:36] now now and now when they reach the age
[1:27:38] of 30 they're hitting
[1:27:40] menopause but the elderly from those
[1:27:44] days they were firm and
[1:27:46] strong but now the young
[1:27:48] people they're so
[1:27:51] weak they can't they can't take
[1:27:54] speaking about the
[1:27:56] natural but the natural also typifies
[1:27:58] the
[1:28:00] spiritual this generation is much
[1:28:02] wiser they know everything but they're
[1:28:05] way
[1:28:08] weaker may God help
[1:28:13] us that's why it's very important for us
[1:28:15] to
[1:28:16] read I'm not against
[1:28:18] this but it's also good for you to
[1:28:21] read so that you have your mind alert
[1:28:25] to be
[1:28:26] alive
[1:28:29] amen and what better book to read than
[1:28:31] the
[1:28:33] Bible what other better thing to
[1:28:36] do John
[1:28:39] 146 Jesus said unto him I am the way the
[1:28:44] truth and the
[1:28:47] life no man cometh unto the father but
[1:28:50] by
[1:28:51] me I am the way the truth and the
[1:28:56] life if there is any truth there is a
[1:28:59] lie if there is a correct way then
[1:29:02] there's an incorrect
[1:29:04] way if there's an eternal way eternal
[1:29:06] life if there's a heaven there's a
[1:29:10] hell and may God help
[1:29:14] us but Jesus said I am the
[1:29:17] way and that way is going to take you to
[1:29:19] the
[1:29:21] truth is going to take you to eternal
[1:29:23] life
[1:29:29] and now we're going to jump over to
[1:29:31] Matthew
[1:29:44] 7 Matthew
[1:29:52] 713 go ahead
[1:30:21] uh Matthew 7:13 m
[1:30:26] 7133 enter ye into the Straight Gate for
[1:30:29] wide is the gate and Broad is the way
[1:30:31] that leadth to destruction and many
[1:30:34] there be which go in uh there
[1:30:38] at and so then Jesus is the way the
[1:30:42] truth and the
[1:30:44] life and we see that there's
[1:30:47] two two ways and and
[1:30:52] doors the two doors better said are
[1:30:56] going to be uh represent themselves unto
[1:30:58] you one is the good one and the other
[1:31:01] one is the
[1:31:03] incorrect but then who makes that
[1:31:05] decision you
[1:31:09] yourself but before you make that
[1:31:12] decision you are going to hear the
[1:31:17] gospel you're going to hear the message
[1:31:19] of the hour for your
[1:31:20] day you have your day and this is your
[1:31:26] this is the message for your
[1:31:29] day and so then now you're going to make
[1:31:31] your own
[1:31:33] decision and there's going to be two
[1:31:35] doors in front of
[1:31:37] you you're going to go through the
[1:31:39] narrow uh uh the W the broad uh
[1:31:45] door it's
[1:31:48] wide it's very wide and very
[1:31:51] pretty because uh broad is the
[1:31:56] gate that leadth to destruction it's
[1:31:59] spacious
[1:32:01] spacious there's so much road on
[1:32:06] that you can see how many are are always
[1:32:09] walking through that but that road will
[1:32:12] take
[1:32:14] you
[1:32:16] to and it's
[1:32:19] many it's not few it's
[1:32:22] many that go
[1:32:28] therein it's not a few it's
[1:32:32] many and then verse 14
[1:32:34] says because straight is the
[1:32:37] gate now we're talking about the other
[1:32:40] one and narrow is the
[1:32:45] way and we see that that path is very
[1:32:47] narrow and not wide as the other
[1:32:50] one now the other one takes you to
[1:32:53] Perdition
[1:32:55] and this one will take you onto
[1:32:58] life and very
[1:33:00] few there be that find
[1:33:05] it many will go in through that door
[1:33:07] that will take you to
[1:33:10] Perdition but very few will go to those
[1:33:13] that will go to life he is the
[1:33:17] way and that way he's going to take you
[1:33:18] to the
[1:33:20] truth and that truth will take you onto
[1:33:23] eternal life
[1:33:24] there's two
[1:33:25] doors there's a truth and there's a lie
[1:33:29] there's a right way and there's an
[1:33:31] incorrect way there's a good
[1:33:34] door and there's an incorrect
[1:33:39] door we're GNA go to First
[1:33:42] John once again back to First
[1:33:48] John first John uh chapter 4 verse
[1:33:52] 5
[1:33:59] they are of the world therefore speak
[1:34:01] they of the world and the world Heth
[1:34:08] them and when you're in the
[1:34:11] world that's all you can hear is the
[1:34:13] things of the world incorrect
[1:34:17] things but when someone is of
[1:34:21] God when somebody is an eagle
[1:34:30] and when you're there the in the Eagle's
[1:34:34] Nest and when you hear that mother Eagle
[1:34:37] Cry The Gospel the message of the
[1:34:41] hour you begin to
[1:34:43] react and you begin to say what is
[1:34:48] this because the only one that can hear
[1:34:51] another Eagle is an
[1:34:52] eagle and now verse
[1:34:56] six we are of
[1:34:59] God he that knoweth God he with
[1:35:04] us that's the reason why you're
[1:35:05] listening to me because you are of
[1:35:09] God and since you are of
[1:35:13] God you're thinking about every word
[1:35:15] that I'm telling
[1:35:16] you and you can say that is the
[1:35:19] truth because just like an
[1:35:22] eagle
[1:35:25] you understand or know the language of
[1:35:27] an
[1:35:30] eagle but if you're a
[1:35:33] chicken you're only going to hear the
[1:35:36] hen uh he that is not of God Heth not
[1:35:42] us hereby know we the and the spirit he
[1:35:47] that have let him
[1:35:50] he and this we shall
[1:35:52] know the spirit of
[1:35:55] truth and the spirit of
[1:35:58] error may God help
[1:36:02] us hereby we know we the spirit of
[1:36:06] truth and the spirit of
[1:36:10] error and so we see that the spirit or
[1:36:13] the truth is a spirit and the
[1:36:15] error is also a
[1:36:18] spirit and that
[1:36:20] error will make you think
[1:36:24] that you are in the
[1:36:29] truth that
[1:36:31] error will tell you here's the word
[1:36:35] here's the
[1:36:37] message but there is a
[1:36:41] spirit may God help
[1:36:45] us he that have an ear let him
[1:36:49] hear
[1:36:52] okay we're in good time
[1:36:54] here we're going to go to John
[1:37:00] 12 John
[1:37:08] 12:44 here we're going to make some
[1:37:09] emphasis on what we read in The Book of
[1:37:14] Mark is it that you bring forth the
[1:37:16] light to hide
[1:37:17] it or is it just to keep it there nice
[1:37:19] and
[1:37:21] clean but everything shall be made
[1:37:23] manifest
[1:37:27] nothing that's been hidden shall stay
[1:37:29] hidden everything shall be made
[1:37:33] manifest that's the reason why the Bible
[1:37:35] tells us he that is uh
[1:37:39] unclean that he may continue to be un
[1:37:43] but he that is clean continue to be
[1:37:47] clean in verse 44
[1:37:50] says Jesus cried and said
[1:37:55] uh I like this part he's
[1:37:57] cried he didn't just talk he cried out
[1:38:02] and
[1:38:02] said he that believeth on
[1:38:05] me believe not on
[1:38:08] me but on him that sent
[1:38:11] me
[1:38:12] amen what is that what is that telling
[1:38:15] us we're going to say this by an
[1:38:18] example brother Manuel Santos is in
[1:38:20] Mexico right now he's over there
[1:38:25] is he only representing uel Santos no
[1:38:28] he's representing all of
[1:38:33] us brother Marcos and brother Octavius
[1:38:35] is representing all of us over there in
[1:38:39] Peru believe not on me but on him that
[1:38:41] sent
[1:38:44] me and he that seeth
[1:38:48] me uh him that sent me see him that sent
[1:38:52] me
[1:38:54] and he that seeth me seeth him that set
[1:38:58] me now verse
[1:39:00] 46
[1:39:02] I am come a
[1:39:05] light into the
[1:39:11] world and the Book of Markus says is it
[1:39:13] that we're going to hide our
[1:39:15] light under a pillow or something hidden
[1:39:20] what is that
[1:39:22] light and we're going to read it here on
[1:39:24] verse 46 I am I am came a light what is
[1:39:28] the
[1:39:29] light the Lord Jesus Christ he is the
[1:39:33] light he is the
[1:39:36] truth and that truth should not be
[1:39:39] hidden but it should be brought
[1:39:42] forth and showed onto the
[1:39:45] world that Jesus Christ is the light of
[1:39:47] the world that he is the
[1:39:50] truth I am come a light into the
[1:39:55] world that whosoever believeth on
[1:39:58] me shall not abide in
[1:40:02] darkness he that hear my
[1:40:05] words and here it's going to get a
[1:40:07] little bit
[1:40:08] rough and if any man hear my
[1:40:11] words and believe
[1:40:14] not what does that mean that believeth
[1:40:19] not it's when you're here listening to
[1:40:21] the message of the
[1:40:22] hour
[1:40:24] you begin to listen to the message in
[1:40:25] the morning on
[1:40:27] Sunday you come Monday or
[1:40:29] Tuesday and you don't keep it you don't
[1:40:32] live it you don't accept
[1:40:37] it brother we're living in the end
[1:40:41] times and what are you doing with this
[1:40:46] word why isn't there any more new
[1:40:50] births there's many people
[1:40:55] that haven't been born
[1:40:57] again but they've been here in
[1:40:59] church for
[1:41:01] years for
[1:41:04] years and even
[1:41:07] then they can't see the
[1:41:12] word because it's not by flesh or
[1:41:16] blood not because my son is my son he
[1:41:21] himself when he's born or
[1:41:25] comes to the age of
[1:41:26] accountability he has to accept this or
[1:41:29] he has to reject
[1:41:33] it I can't save

[1:44:32] word that will condemn the
[1:44:35] world the same
[1:44:37] Waters that destroyed the
[1:44:40] world will be the same work Waters that
[1:44:43] saved
[1:44:44] [Applause]
[1:44:46] Noah Jesus
[1:44:50] said in this moment this day
[1:44:53] I didn't come to condemn I
[1:44:56] came in an office to
[1:44:59] save but there will come a day there
[1:45:02] will be a
[1:45:03] judgment and who's going to
[1:45:06] judge the same
[1:45:10] word the same
[1:45:12] gospel that all the apostles have
[1:45:16] preached it's the same
[1:45:18] gospel that was
[1:45:20] preached in this Tabernacle
[1:45:25] and it's the same gospel will either
[1:45:27] save you or it's going to judge
[1:45:36] you the word that I have spoken will
[1:45:41] judge
[1:45:45] it shall the same judge him on the last
[1:45:50] day right now he came to save the world
[1:45:54] but there will be a day there is a
[1:45:57] date where there will be
[1:46:00] judgment and the same
[1:46:02] word that we have
[1:46:05] rejected will be the same
[1:46:07] word that will judge
[1:46:16] you now we're going to go to the book of
[1:46:19] Acts acts
[1:46:21] 17 verse 31
[1:46:25] one because he hath appointed a
[1:46:29] day in which he will judge the world in
[1:46:35] righteousness and so then we see that he
[1:46:37] has appointed a
[1:46:39] day which the world will be
[1:46:42] judged now we're going to go to the Book
[1:46:44] of
[1:46:45] Matthew Matthew chapter
[1:46:49] 10 Matthew
[1:46:51] 10:14
[1:47:02] and whosoever shall not receive you nor
[1:47:04] hear your words when you depart out of
[1:47:06] their house or city shake off the dust
[1:47:08] off your
[1:47:11] feet verely I say unto
[1:47:14] you that on the day of
[1:47:17] judgment shall be more
[1:47:21] tolerable for the land of Sodom and
[1:47:24] Gomorrah in the
[1:47:25] day than for that
[1:47:29] City saying that later day of
[1:47:35] judgment that judgment that fell down on
[1:47:37] Sodom and
[1:47:39] Gomorrah is uncomparable
[1:47:41] you can't compare
[1:47:45] it there are some people that think that
[1:47:47] what happened in Sodom and gomorah was
[1:47:49] very terrible and it
[1:47:51] was but what will happen on that other
[1:47:55] day will won't even
[1:47:57] compare that's why on this
[1:48:01] day the only one that's judging herself
[1:48:04] is the
[1:48:06] bride with the same
[1:48:09] word the
[1:48:11] word is judging the
[1:48:14] bride a brother or
[1:48:16] sister take the
[1:48:18] word and judge
[1:48:21] yourself because that lat later day will
[1:48:26] come that appointed day that God has
[1:48:30] appointed that won't even compare to
[1:48:32] what happened
[1:48:35] on Soro don't compare to what will
[1:48:37] happen on that Judgment
[1:48:40] Day and that same
[1:48:42] word that came to save you will be the
[1:48:46] one to judge
[1:48:50] you the same Waters that destroy the
[1:48:52] world
[1:48:54] were the same Waters that saved
[1:48:58] Noah the same gospel that all the
[1:49:00] Pharisees
[1:49:03] rejected were the same was the same
[1:49:05] gospel that the 120
[1:49:07] accepted he that have an ear let him
[1:49:10] hear what is the
[1:49:12] truth the truth is this message is this
[1:49:16] word and that who he who is of the truth
[1:49:19] Hearth the
[1:49:21] truth
[1:49:23] uh and then we're going to go to the
[1:49:24] last scripture
[1:49:26] here Revelations uh chapter
[1:49:36] 20 chapter 10 verse
[1:49:47] 10 I recommend that you read the whole
[1:49:50] chapter but we're going to start off on
[1:49:52] verse 10
[1:50:00] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:50:02] cast into the lake of fire and
[1:50:05] brimstone where the Beast and the false
[1:50:07] prophet
[1:50:10] are and shall be tormented day and night
[1:50:13] forever and
[1:50:17] ever and then verse
[1:50:21] 11 and I saw great white
[1:50:33] throne and him that sat on it from whose
[1:50:36] face the earth and the heaven fled away
[1:50:39] and there was found no place for
[1:50:42] them and we see here that even the
[1:50:45] earth and the
[1:50:48] heavens couldn't stand before that white
[1:50:51] Throne judgment
[1:50:56] and they tried to hide but there was no
[1:50:58] place for them to
[1:50:59] hide and may God help us brother verse
[1:51:04] 12 and I saw the
[1:51:06] dead small and
[1:51:09] great stand before
[1:51:13] God and the books were
[1:51:17] opened and another book was opened which
[1:51:20] was The Book of Life
[1:51:26] and the dead were judged out of those
[1:51:28] things which were written in the
[1:51:31] books according to their
[1:51:34] works and the
[1:51:36] Sea gave up the dead which were in
[1:51:42] it and death and Hell delivered up the
[1:51:44] dead which were in
[1:51:48] them and they were judged every man
[1:51:50] according to their works
[1:51:57] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:51:59] Lake of Fire this is the second
[1:52:05] death and whosoever was not found
[1:52:07] written in the Book of Life was cast
[1:52:09] into the Lake of
[1:52:12] Fire and we see that there's a white
[1:52:19] throne and even the heavens and the
[1:52:21] Earth were trying to hide hide
[1:52:22] themselves because they could not stand
[1:52:24] being before that white
[1:52:26] throne and the dead were
[1:52:29] risen small and
[1:52:32] great and everyone has a
[1:52:35] book everybody has a
[1:52:38] book and everything that's written in
[1:52:40] that
[1:52:43] book are the works that that individual
[1:52:46] committed here on
[1:52:47] Earth I have a book I have a
[1:52:51] book each and every one of us has a
[1:52:54] book brother all of this has to be
[1:52:57] preached because it's Our
[1:53:01] obligation to prepare God's
[1:53:05] people everybody has their own
[1:53:09] book but there was another book called
[1:53:11] The Book of
[1:53:13] Life and the
[1:53:17] Sea and the Sea also has his
[1:53:21] dead and death and Hell delivered up
[1:53:23] their dead and each and every one of
[1:53:26] them was
[1:53:29] judged and then at the
[1:53:32] end death and
[1:53:34] hell were cast into the Lake of
[1:53:38] Fire the Lake of Fire wasn't made for
[1:53:40] the children of
[1:53:41] God it's not for
[1:53:44] us it's for the devil and his
[1:53:48] angels so then what hope do we
[1:53:51] have
[1:53:53] is that you're still
[1:53:55] alive my brother and sister you're still
[1:53:58] alive blessed be the name of the
[1:54:02] Lord those that are dead they have no
[1:54:04] more
[1:54:06] opportunity but you are do have an
[1:54:11] opport and why do you worry about the
[1:54:13] things that you shouldn't
[1:54:15] have you should be more worried about
[1:54:17] your own
[1:54:20] salvation and not lose your salvation
[1:54:26] because you can cross that line of
[1:54:28] Mercy brother you
[1:54:31] can the prophet tells
[1:54:33] us that you can lose your
[1:54:36] salvation even with your suit on even
[1:54:39] with your
[1:54:41] Bible Crossing that line of
[1:54:44] Mercy you lose your your
[1:54:49] salvation but when I I accepted the Lord
[1:54:53] Jesus Christ I said
[1:54:55] Lord I've done so many incorrect
[1:54:59] things and I'm not
[1:55:01] worthy to accept
[1:55:04] you and when I accepted him he took my
[1:55:08] book he took
[1:55:10] it that was full of so many incorrect
[1:55:14] things from the day I was
[1:55:17] born I was already condemned to
[1:55:19] death and the prophet tells us
[1:55:23] that the moment that you were
[1:55:25] born you already destined to go to
[1:55:29] hell but when you accepted the Lord
[1:55:31] Jesus
[1:55:32] Christ Jesus Takes that book he takes
[1:55:36] it and he fills it with blood and he
[1:55:39] throws it
[1:55:40] away and your
[1:55:42] name isn't now in the Lamb's Book of
[1:55:45] Life because you accepted the
[1:55:48] Judgment of your
[1:55:51] day
[1:55:54] accept your judgment
[1:55:56] brother but those that don't want to
[1:55:58] judge themselves on this
[1:56:00] day Jesus says I won't judge you but the
[1:56:04] same word will judge you on that
[1:56:07] day and that word will tell
[1:56:11] you didn't Luis agil preach to you
[1:56:14] didn't Bernie Garcia preach to you bober
[1:56:17] didn't Bob Willer preach you I sent you
[1:56:20] the
[1:56:21] prophets I sent you the pastors and what
[1:56:24] have you done with them it's because I
[1:56:26] don't accept them but they're my
[1:56:29] servants to bring forth this word but
[1:56:34] Lord I don't accept that human flesh
[1:56:37] it's not that you w't accept it it's not
[1:56:40] because of the person it's the word that
[1:56:43] comes for of that human
[1:56:49] being
[1:56:51] amen
[1:56:54] and we're in a throne of
[1:56:56] Mercy but one day that Throne will turn
[1:57:00] into and will be a throne of
[1:57:03] judgment that the Earth the trees and
[1:57:07] the
[1:57:08] Rocks they will try to
[1:57:11] hide because they don't want to be
[1:57:12] before that white Throne what about us
[1:57:18] wow may God help
[1:57:21] us
[1:57:23] can you go uh can you go to the first
[1:57:29] slide I've done
[1:57:34] preaching we have something very special
[1:57:36] that will happen
[1:57:37] tomorrow solar eclipse Sol we have a
[1:57:41] solar eclipse for
[1:57:46] tomorrow and you can see that that
[1:57:51] eclipse has roughly around seven
[1:57:55] stages seven
[1:57:59] stages and those stages are almost like
[1:58:02] the seven Church
[1:58:05] ages the first Bible that God had was
[1:58:08] the
[1:58:11] stars and then on August
[1:58:13] 21st of
[1:58:18] 2017 we had an eclipse that passed
[1:58:20] throughout the whole United States
[1:58:22] Oregon started in
[1:58:27] Oregon and I believe it ended in South
[1:58:30] Carolina and you can see it on the
[1:58:37] map and I believe that almost everybody
[1:58:40] here has studied this
[1:58:42] already but those that don't know
[1:58:46] this in this
[1:58:51] eclipse it went through every town it
[1:58:53] went through every
[1:58:55] town called
[1:58:57] Salem every
[1:59:01] town Salem Oregon it went through Salem
[1:59:04] Oregon um Salem Idaho Salem Idaho Salem
[1:59:09] Wyoming and Wyoming Salem Nebraska Salem
[1:59:12] Nebraska Salem Missouri and Missouri
[1:59:15] Salem Kentucky and Salem Kentucky Salem
[1:59:19] South Carolina and it ended up coming
[1:59:21] out through Salem South
[1:59:23] Carolina and the
[1:59:26] sun now in English you can say it a
[1:59:28] little bit s o n because in English s s
[1:59:33] n and s o
[1:59:35] n and then in Spanish it's the Sun
[1:59:39] and and when this eclipse happened the
[1:59:43] sun the
[1:59:45] sun Leo was in the constellation of Leo
[1:59:49] Leo and Leo the Lion
[1:59:52] Sal passing through
[1:59:56] Salem oron and then uh at the hour of
[1:59:59] the Salem
[2:00:02] Eclipse when the eclipse hit Salem
[2:00:05] Oregon was the precise
[2:00:08] hour of the position of the sun of the
[2:00:11] sunset the sunset in in
[2:00:15] Jerusalem both
[2:00:17] cities both were darkened at the same
[2:00:20] time on August 21st of
[2:00:25] 2017 and and then on that same
[2:00:30] day there is a special day of the
[2:00:33] Jews that it's uh read like
[2:00:38] this Rose
[2:00:43] Jes and that day begins on the 21st of
[2:00:46] August the day of the
[2:00:49] eclipse and El
[2:00:56] begins on the uh day 12 of the Jewish
[2:00:59] calendar and that
[2:01:02] means uh the Harvest Time has
[2:01:06] begun the Harvest Time has
[2:01:09] begun Brothers we're at the end time
[2:01:13] now the stars are one
[2:01:16] Bible the pyramids are
[2:01:18] another and we have the third one right
[2:01:20] here
[2:01:24] and then this Eclipse that we will have
[2:01:27] tomorrow and if you can put the next
[2:01:33] slide it will begin through Mexico going
[2:01:36] through Texas and then come out through
[2:01:37] Canada
[2:01:41] um and then in Matthew
[2:01:43] 16 uh verse
[2:01:47] 4 a wicked and adulterous
[2:01:50] generation seeketh after a
[2:01:54] sign and there shall no sign be given
[2:01:56] unto
[2:01:58] them but the sign of the prophet of
[2:02:01] Jonas and what I like at the end of this
[2:02:06] verse and it says that and he left them
[2:02:09] and
[2:02:10] departed he
[2:02:13] left they want a
[2:02:15] sign but the Lord
[2:02:20] left
[2:02:26] and there's a rumor that the eclipse was
[2:02:28] supposed to pass through a certain
[2:02:29] cities called
[2:02:36] nineve and some of us here know that the
[2:02:39] prophet Jonas was sent uh to the city of
[2:02:44] nineve
[2:02:46] and and to be exact it's not really
[2:02:48] going to pass through seven
[2:02:50] nineve
[2:02:52] but there are seven nineve cities in
[2:02:55] States and they're going to be very
[2:02:58] close and seeing that
[2:03:03] eclipse and the zodiac
[2:03:06] sign for tomorrow April
[2:03:08] 8th is going to be
[2:03:11] Aries but tomorrow on the 8th of
[2:03:16] April uh it said that the sun will not
[2:03:19] be in the in the constellation of Aries
[2:03:23] but it will be still in
[2:03:25] Pisces Pisces is is the
[2:03:28] fish Jonah was in the
[2:03:30] fish and the
[2:03:33] sun Pisces the s n will be in
[2:03:37] Pisces eclipse or the Su will be in
[2:03:40] Pisces going through the
[2:03:44] eclipse this Eclipse will pass through
[2:03:46] the cities called
[2:03:50] nineve
[2:03:53] but not all of them will be touched by
[2:03:54] this uh Eclipse but they will be very
[2:03:58] close but there will be one in
[2:04:02] special that will hit that
[2:04:05] Eclipse that will be in Neve indana
[2:04:12] Indiana it's really tremendous so I
[2:04:14] started looking at the map of
[2:04:18] Indiana and Indiana has a lot of towns
[2:04:20] that are named biblically
[2:04:25] and I'll leave that for
[2:04:28] homework so then when the eclipse passes
[2:04:30] by it's going to pass through n Indiana
[2:04:33] Indiana can you go to the next one
[2:04:40] brother and the states that are marked
[2:04:43] in blue that's where the eclipse will be
[2:04:45] passing through okay one more
[2:04:48] brother
[2:04:50] okay
[2:04:54] you can see what happened on the 1st of
[2:04:55] August 21st
[2:04:58] 2017 and the one that's on the bottom is
[2:05:00] the one that's going to happen
[2:05:03] tomorrow and you can see the United
[2:05:05] States right before
[2:05:07] us and you can see it as an
[2:05:11] X and others might say well it looks
[2:05:13] like a
[2:05:15] cross and it's just really up to your
[2:05:17] own
[2:05:20] perception I believe that it's going to
[2:05:22] be both
[2:05:24] things because salvation came to the
[2:05:27] United
[2:05:28] States but the United States
[2:05:31] rejected the prophet of this
[2:05:35] age and that's why the prophet says
[2:05:38] that that I indict this
[2:05:43] nation for rejecting the message of the
[2:05:47] day and so then the United States is now
[2:05:50] condemned there's an X
[2:05:54] that's why the prophet says don't even
[2:05:56] vote don't even
[2:05:58] vote everything is now
[2:06:01] condemned everything is
[2:06:04] condemned but where that uh very Target
[2:06:07] of the
[2:06:08] AES is the Southern
[2:06:12] Indiana why in Southern
[2:06:15] Indiana because the prophet was there of
[2:06:19] Malachi
[2:06:20] 45
[2:06:22] where he brought forth the message of
[2:06:24] the hour for our
[2:06:26] day that's where he brought the Seven
[2:06:28] Seals he brought the
[2:06:30] messages from that very
[2:06:33] point from their salvation
[2:06:35] came and from their condemnation will
[2:06:37] come
[2:06:42] amen and I was speaking to someone this
[2:06:47] week and this man is from
[2:06:49] Indiana indana in sou South Indiana and
[2:06:53] he told me look at there at Southern
[2:06:55] Indiana there's fault there's some
[2:06:57] faults
[2:06:59] there and in those Faults Are the reason
[2:07:02] why we have earthquakes there in Indiana
[2:07:04] and I asked him in Indiana in indana and
[2:07:07] Southern Indiana and he said
[2:07:11] yes and the scientist in
[2:07:14] Indiana have told all the people of
[2:07:17] Indiana that sooner or
[2:07:20] later there will be an earthquake in
[2:07:23] that in that southern fault of Indiana
[2:07:26] and
[2:07:28] literally will break the United States
[2:07:30] in
[2:07:31] half and that will cause the United
[2:07:33] California to sink what and I told him
[2:07:39] what and this is a man that doesn't even
[2:07:41] know the
[2:07:43] message and he's telling me that there
[2:07:46] ises
[2:07:47] there that are crossing through southern
[2:07:50] Indiana and brother
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:57] repents now I don't know how much of the
[2:07:59] truth that is but you can take it or
[2:08:02] reject
[2:08:04] it you can make your own decision here
[2:08:07] you go to the next
[2:08:11] one and right here we see where the x is
[2:08:14] where both of them
[2:08:16] cross I know you can't really see it
[2:08:18] very
[2:08:20] well but there's a lot of small towns
[2:08:23] there where it's going to
[2:08:26] cross uh where the eclipse will be
[2:08:28] Crossing through okay you go to the next
[2:08:30] one
[2:08:33] brother
[2:08:36] okay indana and in this spot where it's
[2:08:39] going to pass through Indiana Louisville
[2:08:42] you can see Louisville Louisville you
[2:08:44] can see the the town of Louisville you
[2:08:46] can't see it Louisville is right there
[2:08:49] it's going to be over here on the right
[2:08:50] side okay okay um lverson it's very
[2:08:55] close to
[2:08:58] Jeffersonville at Jeffersonville and so
[2:09:01] then we see that the eclipse won't
[2:09:03] really pass through uh
[2:09:06] Jeffersonville but you can see where
[2:09:07] it's going to pass
[2:09:09] through and where you see that green
[2:09:12] line that's the very center of the
[2:09:16] eclipse Mon carel and you can see here
[2:09:20] that it says mount carel
[2:09:22] can you see
[2:09:24] it can you can see it okay can you see
[2:09:27] it okay right there in midd C right
[2:09:31] there in the very middle Monte carelo it
[2:09:34] says here Mount Carmel in Indiana
[2:09:37] Indiana and what happened in Mount car
[2:09:42] Elijah made that fire come
[2:09:46] down and he destroyed those false
[2:09:48] prophets and in this day we have our
[2:09:51] prophet in mon in Indiana in
[2:09:54] Indiana car there's a Mount Carmel okay
[2:09:56] let's go to the next
[2:10:02] one and here we have another
[2:10:05] map where the eclipse is going to pass
[2:10:07] through Indiana okay the last one
[2:10:10] brother
[2:10:12] okay there is a town in that
[2:10:17] section where both of those Eclipse pass
[2:10:20] through very small
[2:10:23] town it's not a huge Town very few very
[2:10:27] small Rapture indana named Rapture
[2:10:31] Indiana because the
[2:10:33] Rapture is not something
[2:10:38] big it's only for the small
[2:10:43] elect and when I went to the map and I
[2:10:45] saw the the city it was so
[2:10:50] small probably less than couple hundred
[2:10:53] people maybe about 300
[2:10:55] people but there where there ex is
[2:10:58] Rapture Indiana is Rapture
[2:11:01] Indiana you can take it however you
[2:11:06] want but the the gospel has been uh
[2:11:09] preached to us in our
[2:11:11] day is the rapture going to happen
[2:11:13] tomorrow I'm not saying that but it will
[2:11:17] happen are we going to die tomorrow I
[2:11:19] don't
