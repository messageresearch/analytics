[34:39] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[34:41] amen amen
[34:46] just as we're standing if we can go to
[34:48] matthew 16.
[34:51] verse 13.
[34:58] if you would please say amen once you
[34:59] have it
[35:13] when jesus came into the coast of
[35:15] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[35:18] saying whom do men say that the son of
[35:20] man that i the son of man am
[35:23] i
[35:24] juanias
[35:30] and they said some say thou art john the
[35:33] baptist some elias and others jeremiah
[35:36] or one of the prophets
[35:41] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[35:44] that i am
[35:45] responding
[35:48] and simon peter answered and said thou
[35:50] art the christ the son of the living god
[35:53] entonces
[35:54] jesus
[36:01] and jesus answered and said unto him
[36:03] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[36:05] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[36:07] but my father which is in heaven
[36:18] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[36:20] and upon this rock i will build my
[36:22] church and the gates of hell shall not
[36:24] prevail against it
[36:26] hey man you may be seated
[36:30] may the lord bless the reading of his
[36:32] word this evening
[36:42] this evening i brought a message that
[36:43] i've titled the benefits and the
[36:45] consequences of revelation
[36:50] when i say the word consequences
[37:04] but consequences aren't always something
[37:07] negative
[37:08] it's also something positive
[37:12] and the revelation
[37:15] i believe that for the believer
[37:19] revelation is always something positive
[37:21] for the believer
[37:23] it has its benefits
[37:30] now first off i'd like to read what the
[37:32] prophet says here this is
[37:37] in the exposition of the seven church
[37:39] ages the revelation of jesus christ
[37:45] speaking about the devil
[37:47] received
[37:51] he knows that if the people get the true
[37:52] revelation of the true church
[37:56] and what she is
[38:01] and what she stands for and that she can
[38:03] do the greater works
[38:06] she will be an invincible army
[38:13] christian if they get a true revelation
[38:15] of the two spirits within the framework
[38:17] of the christian church
[38:24] and by god's spirit discern and
[38:26] withstand the antichrist spirit
[38:29] revelation revelation
[38:36] [Music]
[38:49] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[38:51] as when christ withstood every effort to
[38:53] gain power of him
[38:58] in the desert
[39:13] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[39:16] us
[39:20] but we will prevail over them
[39:26] it's the revelation of god that will
[39:28] give you the authority over the devil
[39:34] and you can see why they who add or take
[39:37] from it would be cursed
[39:40] because it's the revelation of jesus
[39:41] christ
[39:43] that's given to you
[39:46] not that it's your revelation
[39:49] it's the revelation he gave you
[39:52] because it's his word
[39:53] it's not our word
[40:08] for who can add or take away from the
[40:09] perfect revelation of god and overcome
[40:11] the enemy i see is the sincere it's that
[40:14] simple
[40:17] revelation
[40:18] there's nothing of such prevailing power
[40:20] as the revelation of the word revelation
[40:34] [Music]
[40:36] we're
[40:50] and sometimes it feels vamos
[40:53] that we're barely overcoming
[40:58] but we're not just going to survive
[41:00] we're going to prevail
[41:19] it produces war
[41:22] revelation
[41:23] if you receive revelation on god's
[41:24] behalf
[41:27] you will be in a war
[41:32] embrace i would like for the youth to
[41:34] understand this
[41:37] because revelation is something so
[41:39] beautiful
[41:41] for me personally
[41:44] ever since i had my experience
[41:45] essentially
[41:48] i felt as though my eyes have been
[41:50] opened
[41:51] and he does it over and over
[41:55] but also since my experience
[41:59] i've been attacked so much by the devil
[42:02] and i couldn't understand why
[42:04] yo
[42:07] if i was seeing these great things
[42:10] being so beautiful
[42:12] in the bible and in the message
[42:28] a
[42:41] the rock of revelation
[42:45] and the gates of hell no prevalence
[42:48] shall not prevail against it
[42:51] you receive a revelation
[42:55] the gates of hell will make the effort
[42:58] but they will not prevail
[43:01] but they will make the effort
[43:03] and it's not the way you think
[43:06] because if you look in the old
[43:11] you testament see that both abraham and
[43:13] sarah they made mistakes
[43:16] and it's registered in the bible
[43:19] but they're now in the new testament
[43:22] it speaks about only the good things
[43:24] it's not important
[43:38] it sees to the
[43:52] god already said
[44:06] and will
[44:19] we know the prophet says it's like wine
[44:25] have you seen a person when they receive
[44:27] revelation
[44:29] they get crazy
[44:31] the person goes crazy
[44:49] and the third time that this happened to
[44:50] me
[44:51] it was myself
[44:55] i found myself identified with the
[44:56] nathaniel porque porque jesus
[44:59] why because jesus saw it in division
[45:02] under a
[45:15] the first time this happened to me are
[45:18] you hermano
[45:19] there's a brother here in church
[45:25] he had his experience a few years ago
[45:29] and from then on out he's been serving
[45:30] the lord
[45:33] and that brother he has a brother in the
[45:35] flesh
[45:37] i don't want to say names
[45:41] because maybe the people might be a
[45:43] little embarrassed
[45:54] would tell me how it is that they had
[45:55] this feeling in their heart
[46:09] he told me things about how god would
[46:11] work in their family
[46:24] and there's a very special number for
[46:26] them
[46:29] and that's something biblical
[46:35] one day i was studying
[46:37] [Music]
[46:38] but honestly i wasn't really studying
[46:51] go to bed if you're not going to study
[46:53] okay okay studying science i said okay
[46:55] okay well it's all right
[46:58] she went to her bedroom then she came
[46:59] back
[47:01] once again i was on myself
[47:04] and she's calling me again
[47:05] okay stephen
[47:06] i said all right all right
[47:14] and it was that night that i found that
[47:15] person es hermano that brother
[47:20] that has now had his experience
[47:25] and he has a brother that's in the world
[47:30] i found once that there were two
[47:31] disciples in the bible
[47:34] one was running
[47:36] one reached its destiny first
[47:39] and then the other came
[47:41] and he arrived later
[47:45] there's other details as well
[47:48] but i went with that person
[47:49] and i told him
[48:03] that person
[48:18] i was
[48:32] told the person god bless you you know
[48:35] and then he continued to preach
[48:38] and the day that that person arrived
[48:40] he arrived late
[48:43] why because the scripture has to be
[48:45] fulfilled
[49:00] it's something that i would really like
[49:01] for the youth to understand
[49:04] if you receive a revelation el diablo
[49:08] the devil will come to attack you after
[49:10] especially
[49:12] after i received my experience
[49:27] it was a friday evening
[49:41] i had to get to a certain place to
[49:42] perform a certain job
[49:45] but i was distracted in my mind
[49:49] so i took an exit i shouldn't have taken
[49:51] it
[49:54] when i noticed i got off on the wrong
[49:55] exit to
[50:06] and as you already know the right lane
[50:08] is the slow lane
[50:11] and as we all know us here from phoenix
[50:14] we like to drive fast
[50:19] and i saw many they kind of put their
[50:21] head down
[50:25] but that right lane was going a little
[50:27] slow
[50:32] so i turn my head to look and see if i
[50:34] can get in the left lane
[50:36] once i turn my head
[50:51] and my car was going to smash into a
[50:53] sign
[50:56] i received three three impacts
[51:00] i remember i received three impacts
[51:03] but when i got off the car
[51:07] my car showed that i was only hit once
[51:09] those vessels are hit twice
[51:15] on this part right here in the front
[51:17] left
[51:18] and then on the side
[51:35] but that last impact that struck me from
[51:37] behind
[51:39] it made me avoid that sign noise
[51:42] and not crash into the signs
[51:45] because i would have crashed
[51:54] then that sign would have bent over and
[51:56] it would have crushed me
[51:58] and what is it that happened
[52:00] the devil got angry
[52:15] revelation produces war
[52:26] do i repent from the decision that i
[52:28] made no no loss beneficials
[53:07] it's the revelation of jesus christ
[53:09] personally to you el prophet
[53:11] the prophet himself says
[53:14] that the new birth
[53:17] it's a revelation
[53:21] and myself in these last days
[53:24] i was just asking myself
[53:40] i believe that's a good way to take the
[53:42] prophet's words
[53:44] to believe him
[53:46] though we don't understand
[53:49] and the lord in his grace
[53:52] he'll allow us to understand afterwards
[54:00] and i would ask myself well why did the
[54:02] prophet say it like this
[54:04] then i remember the scriptures
[54:07] in first john 5 4.
[54:12] remember the new birth is a revelation
[54:16] first john 5 4.
[54:21] yes
[54:25] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[54:27] the world and this is the victory that
[54:29] overcometh the world even our faith
[54:34] what does the prophet say faith is
[54:36] revelation
[54:43] he says this is the victory that
[54:45] overcometh the world our faith
[54:49] is whatsoever is born of the world of
[54:52] god overcometh the world
[54:56] and the way that you overcome the world
[54:59] is through your faith
[55:02] and faith is revelation
[55:04] porque
[55:18] now it is a revelation
[55:21] for the revelation is faith
[55:26] you cannot have a revelation without it
[55:27] being faith
[55:29] faith is a revelation
[55:50] that could call anything contrary to
[55:52] what had been revealed to him
[55:55] as though it wasn't so our faith
[55:59] now faith that's what faith is
[56:02] it's the revelation of god
[56:07] revelation the church is built upon a
[56:09] revelation
[56:11] the whole entire body
[56:14] because the revelation produces action
[56:16] produces action
[56:24] how many times have we told the sisters
[56:28] about the skirts
[56:30] and the heels
[56:33] and how many times have we told them
[56:37] that they need to compose themselves
[56:38] correctly
[56:40] how many times
[56:42] but when
[56:56] it produces
[57:26] it's distinct when god accepts it
[57:30] one could say they've got it
[57:32] but when god says you've got it
[57:35] it's because that's how it is
[57:44] i would like to show you in daniel
[57:45] chapter 10.
[57:48] how it is the revelation produces war
[57:50] daniel
[57:52] daniel 10 1 says
[58:08] in the third year of cyrus king of
[58:10] persia a thing was revealed unto daniel
[58:12] whose name was called belteshazar and
[58:14] the thing was true but the time
[58:16] appointed was long and he understood the
[58:18] thing and he had understanding of the
[58:20] vision
[58:34] but in spanish it says a word was
[58:36] revealed
[58:39] and in spanish it also says there was a
[58:41] great conflict
[58:45] now we're going to jump to verse 12.
[58:59] then said he unto me fear not daniel for
[59:02] from the first day that thou didst set
[59:03] thine heart to understand and to chasten
[59:06] thyself before thy god the words were
[59:08] heard and i am come for thy words
[59:12] because the bible says
[59:15] that the eyes of the lord is
[59:58] us
[1:00:07] but the prince of the kingdom of persia
[1:00:09] withstood me and 20 days one in 20 days
[1:00:12] but lo michael one of the chief princes
[1:00:14] came to help me and i remain there with
[1:00:16] the kings of persia
[1:00:18] persona i know that everyone here
[1:00:21] when they pray
[1:00:24] immediately sometimes feel as though the
[1:00:26] answer comes immediately
[1:00:30] and then sometimes the person feels when
[1:00:32] they pray okay
[1:00:34] nothing happens
[1:00:38] then the devil immediately comes with
[1:00:39] the answer no
[1:01:20] we know that the prince is the son of a
[1:01:22] king
[1:01:40] those that govern those that govern a
[1:01:42] people
[1:01:47] in verse 1
[1:01:50] it's a cyrus
[1:02:03] but there's a prince that controls that
[1:02:05] king
[1:02:07] the bible says
[1:02:10] brother branham also says
[1:02:14] the devil is the prince of the powers of
[1:02:16] the air
[1:02:17] branham and what does brother branham
[1:02:19] say
[1:02:22] that the devil controls every government
[1:02:24] in the world
[1:02:28] so you've got to understand
[1:02:29] the principles but it speaks of princes
[1:02:32] what
[1:02:55] now the bible also says that there are
[1:02:56] princes
[1:02:58] on the devil's side
[1:03:00] there's
[1:03:21] but the prince of the kingdom of persia
[1:03:23] would stood me one in 20 days but lo
[1:03:25] michael uno de los principales principes
[1:03:28] one of the chief princes
[1:03:31] there's not just one prince
[1:03:33] principles there's many principles
[1:03:35] because there's many governments
[1:03:40] now because of the time
[1:03:42] and
[1:03:57] many times people depend upon the
[1:03:58] preacher
[1:04:01] but the revelation doesn't just come
[1:04:02] from the preacher
[1:04:04] the revelation comes to you
[1:04:08] you can receive revelation
[1:04:28] now i am come to make thee understand
[1:04:30] what shall befall thy people in the
[1:04:32] latter days for yet the vision is for
[1:04:34] many days
[1:04:48] greatly beloved fear not peace be unto
[1:04:50] thee be strong ye be strong and when he
[1:04:53] had spoken unto me i was strengthened
[1:04:55] and said let my word speak for thou has
[1:04:57] strengthened me
[1:05:06] el principede
[1:05:08] then he then said he knowest thou
[1:05:10] wherefore i come unto thee and now will
[1:05:12] i return to fight with the prince of
[1:05:14] persia and when i am gone forth lo the
[1:05:16] prince of greece shall come
[1:05:19] aura pueden verde
[1:05:32] of peace
[1:06:06] it says that melchizedek is the prince
[1:06:07] of pete is the king of peace
[1:06:11] and what did jesus say when he was here
[1:06:12] on the earth
[1:06:14] my peace i give unto you
[1:06:30] his piece is genuine
[1:06:35] now notice what the brother brandon says
[1:06:36] in the message at thy word
[1:06:41] some time ago it was two couple of women
[1:06:43] in the meeting
[1:06:53] and when on the platform the lord i
[1:06:55] don't know whether she's at the platform
[1:06:57] or in laudence
[1:07:02] anyhow the words spoke out
[1:07:07] thus saith the lord that you're healed
[1:07:11] told her to go eat anything she wanted
[1:07:13] to observe
[1:07:15] watch that when he speaks
[1:07:19] that ain't me
[1:07:22] but thus saith the lord
[1:07:26] and so the woman went home to try to eat
[1:07:28] it
[1:07:30] and when she did she liked to die
[1:07:35] now remember
[1:07:38] the the answer doesn't always come
[1:07:40] immediately i
[1:07:43] and it's not that god doesn't want to
[1:07:44] answer me
[1:07:47] it's because there's spirits that come
[1:07:48] against that spirit
[1:07:51] they want to heal you
[1:07:53] they want to respond to you
[1:08:04] and finally that angel comes and
[1:08:06] confirms his word
[1:08:20] and the angel will come with the
[1:08:21] confirmation of that word
[1:08:29] she had an awful case of it
[1:08:33] it went on for several days
[1:08:36] fresco pasar
[1:08:38] and one morning she feels something cool
[1:08:39] passed right through her yeah
[1:08:42] weeks later yeah
[1:08:44] and she began to eat todd
[1:08:46] it was all right cuando when diesel
[1:08:49] maron diesel ranking
[1:08:59] she run down the street to tell her
[1:09:01] neighbor and her neighbor that had a big
[1:09:02] lump in her throat
[1:09:04] so there were
[1:09:18] and when this woman went to see the
[1:09:19] neighbor
[1:09:20] from ella corrio
[1:09:23] brother brown said she ran down the
[1:09:24] street
[1:09:28] to tell her neighbor that had a big lump
[1:09:30] on her throat
[1:09:32] led
[1:09:35] and the lord had spoke to her and said
[1:09:37] that she was going to be well thus saith
[1:09:39] the lord
[1:09:41] and then when she went out to see her
[1:09:45] establish
[1:09:47] she found her neighbor just screaming at
[1:09:49] the top of her voice
[1:09:52] the lump had just left her throat
[1:09:54] entonces
[1:09:56] so then what happened aquista here was
[1:10:00] declared
[1:10:15] see sometimes they don't get it on the
[1:10:16] spur danielo a spur of the moment daniel
[1:10:19] prayed
[1:10:21] fuel
[1:10:23] the angel said it was 21 days
[1:10:26] i believe before it was right anthony
[1:10:55] but you stay with the word of god
[1:10:58] just wait
[1:11:01] wait upon the lord
[1:11:03] will renew their strengths
[1:11:06] what happened to daniel yeah
[1:11:09] the angel gabriel came to him
[1:11:38] just
[1:11:52] a trumpet is sounded to summon an army
[1:11:55] into battle
[1:11:56] to get into that battle
[1:12:01] and first corinthians 14 8 it says
[1:12:10] for if a trump had given uncertain sound
[1:12:12] who shall prepare himself to the battle
[1:12:14] prophet
[1:12:18] the prophet says in the message
[1:12:19] revelation chapter four number
[1:12:48] either a revelation
[1:13:44] significant
[1:14:00] then the spiritual war begins
[1:14:06] when someone receives the revelation of
[1:14:08] the new birth
[1:14:41] experience he confirms the experience
[1:14:44] with the revealed word
[1:14:47] says this is that
[1:14:50] which was prophesied by the prophet joel
[1:14:54] espiritu then in the
[1:16:04] he attacks the authenticity of it
[1:16:07] because the word is authentic
[1:16:10] but our faith has to be tested
[1:16:12] if we believe it or not
[1:16:16] if you receive the revelation of the new
[1:16:17] birth
[1:16:45] and the trumpet sounds
[1:16:50] and the prophet says in the message uh
[1:16:52] is this the sign of the sir is this the
[1:16:54] end of the signs of the end time
[1:17:00] the sounding
[1:17:09] and the sounding of a trumpet in the
[1:17:10] bible means get ready for spiritual war
[1:17:14] but we're not in the literal war
[1:17:18] the majority of our battle is con el
[1:17:20] diablo it's with the devil
[1:17:24] about the word the revealed word that
[1:17:25] god gave us
[1:17:28] it's a spiritual
[1:17:43] or not
[1:17:45] it's a spiritual war or scriptural war
[1:17:50] preparation
[1:17:52] in the bible it means get ready for a
[1:17:54] scriptural war lost
[1:18:04] if you want to put this down first
[1:18:05] corinthians 14 8.
[1:18:10] if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[1:18:12] how will a man know what to prepare for
[1:18:14] enemies
[1:18:16] in the message the feast of the trumpets
[1:18:23] the trumpet sounded in the trumpet
[1:18:24] denotes either war or a feast day
[1:18:32] or what it means is a gathering together
[1:18:34] of the people pablo dijo
[1:18:39] paul said that when a trumpet gives an
[1:18:40] uncertain sound queen
[1:18:44] who can prepare themselves for war
[1:18:46] or for peace
[1:18:49] or whatever it is
[1:18:53] who knows you have to know what the
[1:18:55] trumpet sounds
[1:19:20] the
[1:19:33] but there's also princes on jesus christ
[1:19:37] jesus himself is a prince
[1:19:46] the the prophet says in the message the
[1:19:48] mighty conqueror
[1:19:51] diablo this earth belonged to the devil
[1:19:55] through the fall
[1:19:58] this earth was given to the devil
[1:20:02] diablo every kingdom of this world is
[1:20:04] governed by the devil
[1:20:06] we hate to think that
[1:20:10] but the bible says it is
[1:20:13] that's the reason we have wars
[1:20:16] and shooting and fighting in trouble
[1:20:20] it's because the kingdoms of this world
[1:20:24] is the kingdoms of the devil
[1:20:29] the bible said so
[1:20:46] for the kingdoms of this earth have
[1:20:48] become the kingdoms of our lord
[1:20:54] and he shall rule and reign forever
[1:20:58] now they will
[1:21:06] when jesus literally will become a
[1:21:07] prince of this world no abraham
[1:21:10] there will be no more war
[1:21:12] when
[1:21:38] but to prevail
[1:22:05] and from jesus christ who is the
[1:22:07] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:22:09] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:22:11] of the earth
[1:22:16] where this scripture will be manifested
[1:22:18] literally
[1:22:22] the governments of this world will not
[1:22:23] always be governed by the devil
[1:22:26] jesus christ
[1:22:29] of the kings of the earth
[1:22:32] because even today
[1:22:35] nothing happens unless he first of all
[1:22:37] allows it
[1:22:39] he's the prince
[1:22:42] the governor of the kings of the earth
[1:22:46] yes satan controls them
[1:22:49] but first he goes and asks for
[1:22:50] permission
[1:23:24] feed the flock of god which is among you
[1:23:26] taking the oversight thereof not by
[1:23:28] constraint but willingly not by filthy
[1:23:30] lucker but of but of a ready mind no
[1:23:33] common sense
[1:23:39] neither is being lords over god's
[1:23:41] heritage but being examples of the flock
[1:23:57] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[1:23:59] you shall receive a crown of glory that
[1:24:01] fadeth not away
[1:24:04] a prince is a governor in england
[1:24:09] and in english it says the chief of the
[1:24:11] shepherds
[1:24:12] the prince
[1:24:13] and a prince is a chief
[1:24:16] one that governs
[1:24:18] for example i'm going to use your
[1:24:19] brothers for example
[1:24:22] he's the pastor here of our church
[1:24:25] but he has a chief
[1:24:28] jesus christ jesus christ
[1:24:32] every pastor of every church no puerto
[1:24:34] de clara
[1:24:36] cannot declare himself
[1:24:39] as the prince of the pastor
[1:24:42] he
[1:24:57] just to clear it up for you a little bit
[1:24:58] more ensembles
[1:25:00] in psalms 23 1 it says
[1:25:02] my pastor the lord is my shepherd
[1:25:05] i shall not want
[1:25:06] me
[1:25:07] david himself
[1:25:09] he was a pastor of the sheep but he also
[1:25:12] had a pastor
[1:25:14] he was my pastor the lord is my shepherd
[1:25:17] the lord of the old testament jehovah of
[1:25:19] the old testament
[1:25:23] is the same of jesus of the new
[1:25:24] testament
[1:25:37] i hope you don't think questions
[1:25:51] jesus isn't jesus christ is not just a
[1:25:53] prince
[1:25:55] but he's a prince charming
[1:26:02] because the way that he directs himself
[1:26:04] to the bride
[1:26:34] governs
[1:26:36] though yes he does govern
[1:26:38] is a principle but he's a prince charm
[1:26:43] he has very special attention toward us
[1:26:46] those are your revelations
[1:27:31] and there that bride is looking for the
[1:27:32] coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:40] which that secret secret coming of the
[1:27:42] lord secret coming of christ shall come
[1:27:44] and catch away his bride in the night
[1:27:45] come on libro
[1:27:48] julieta like a book i read of romeo and
[1:27:50] juliet
[1:27:55] one time how he came with the ladder and
[1:27:56] he got his bride out among them
[1:28:01] that's what jesus will come someday
[1:28:10] looking for that one who's looking who's
[1:28:12] not looking to his creeds
[1:28:17] but looking to christ
[1:28:20] waiting for him to come with his heart
[1:28:22] centered
[1:28:25] because the center of our heart is
[1:28:49] but there's something that we share
[1:28:50] between us
[1:28:52] it's a deep calling to another deep
[1:29:10] christ does vindicate his word which
[1:29:11] attracts the people
[1:29:15] because christ has his personal uh his
[1:29:18] specific liking
[1:29:22] is
[1:29:25] he don't attract the people he don't
[1:29:26] attract the people at churches that are
[1:29:28] attracted by big denominations
[1:29:32] and big and big doings and great big
[1:29:35] carry-ons and fancy things
[1:29:39] but the word of god attracts the bride
[1:29:40] of christ
[1:29:44] if you've got a genuine attraction for
[1:29:46] christ
[1:29:48] it's the word of god in specifically
[1:30:08] now notice it's interesting to notice
[1:30:09] how that the church tries to attract the
[1:30:11] attention of the people by fine ropes
[1:30:15] and dress choirs
[1:30:33] and think nothing about it
[1:30:36] and that's what they think
[1:30:38] that it's all right that's beautiful
[1:30:41] but you see eso
[1:30:43] that's false
[1:30:46] that's not the word of
[1:30:59] and the way that you can keep his
[1:31:40] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:31:42] was open in heaven
[1:31:46] and the first voice which i heard as it
[1:31:48] were trumpet
[1:31:56] talking with me which said come up
[1:31:57] hither and i will show you these things
[1:31:59] which would be hereafter
[1:32:01] it says i saw una puerta vietnam uh
[1:32:04] behold a door that was opened in heaven
[1:32:09] because there's a mutual attraction
[1:32:11] between him and us
[1:32:14] it's a deep from up there
[1:32:18] trying to reveal himself to the deep
[1:32:19] that's right here
[1:32:22] up there
[1:32:24] trying to
[1:32:52] which is
[1:33:06] that will
[1:33:32] the veterans will be there with their
[1:33:33] battle scars
[1:33:48] thomas
[1:33:51] gusta
[1:33:52] we don't like war
[1:33:57] but it has to happen
[1:34:00] the bible has to be fulfilled
[1:34:44] don't go
[1:34:58] thankful
[1:34:59] with the lord that got you out of that
[1:35:04] but your desire
[1:35:07] that you would have never done it to
[1:35:08] start off with
[1:35:10] completely
[1:35:11] the prophets it has to be fulfilled
[1:35:15] we'll show the scars
[1:35:17] just like jesus did
[1:35:19] necessarily but there are some that are
[1:35:21] unnecessary
[1:35:26] there's many here that could tell you
[1:35:27] the same thing
[1:35:29] don't do it
[1:35:31] though it seems very attractive
[1:35:34] no it's an attraction
[1:35:37] if the traction is not to christ
[1:35:40] in that attraction is a distraction is a
[1:35:43] distraction
[1:35:50] you don't have to do it
[1:35:52] but if you do it
[1:35:54] he'll
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:32] if you just put your attraction on
[1:36:33] christ
[1:36:35] the prophet says okay
[1:37:04] because
[1:37:33] and i found a quote from the prophet of
[1:37:35] the new year in the year 61.
[1:37:38] he says
[1:37:41] granted lord consider
[1:37:43] granted again

[1:38:17] holy spirit

[1:38:33] help me lord to go down and protect and
