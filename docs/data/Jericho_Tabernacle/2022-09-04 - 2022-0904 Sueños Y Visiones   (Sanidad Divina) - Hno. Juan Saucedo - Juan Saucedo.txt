confidence in the faith that you will do it now here listos ready to be able to say something that will help your sons and daughters the ones that presently are here in the tabernacle observes because some of them have their own services they have to attend to this morning i pray that you give a special portion to them this morning lord if there's someone that needs you in their life may you hearken to their call as long as you have it open then everything will be fine so lord allow us to run as the door remains open as our brothers on friday told us so therefore please help us this morning help our pastor lord william and to those that are here this morning [Music] we ask for all these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen i want to go to the next scripture which is the fulfillment of the scripture of what we did and as well we appreciate the musicians for the beautiful music everyone that plays an instrument may god bless you it's something very impressive i'm the person that's really uh deeply moved by music and the singing whenever you're singing i really play and many times god inspires me to preach a message due to the song that you're saying when you give a testimony many times god inspires me with the message over that testimony that you gave opportunity so whenever god gives you the chance to be able to come this is what it means to be yielded to him this morning if someone steals something from us and mexico city happens a lot of times you just raise your hands up especially if they have an ice pick and you can see them or a knife or some kind of gun you just want to lift your hands all the way high doses when we raise our hand it's because we're surrendering to number like gloria man glory to his name [Music] i would say put it in your mind throughout the entire week i had a real struggle gracias hermano luis thank you brother luis we love brother luis [Music] but the entire week i've been struggling we just can't simply take something and say well i'm just going to talk about this and that's it and just take out some old notes well i preached this a year ago i preach it then i'll preach it now you're the best therefore you deserve the best yes and that's why we come back that's why we come to every service our clothes won't fit anymore how much more the spiritual food for our souls that's why we come to the services i believe this morning that's why we came here and i want to give a little testimony of what i learned on friday the brother spoke no they said what they said to us go listen to it if you haven't already adios and i asked god for something and he gave it to me on friday for four days the truck that i used to go to work my i started to feel that once i reached the 40 mile per hour mark it began to pull back in the last two days on thursday i would put it in reverse you know and it wouldn't go it wouldn't go i stepped on the gas [Music] and i was shifting gears the same thing happen again i asked god again lord take me down that's the little truck that i used to go to work to get my everyday bed right but then on friday when i was sitting down listening to these two young men may god bless these two young men when i saw them both here so i reminisced years and years and years ago what those young men said was something very tremendous for us [Music] when they said if there's someone that needs anything [Music] it's what gives me the money to be able to live it gives me the money so i i can help the church and it gives me money so that every so often i can help a brother on saturday it ran completely fine without any failure how can i not be happy this morning i won't i be happy this morning the truck that i use for my job it got fixed and now it's fine and saturday i took my wife out to eat and we went in that truck but we're human let me come to you by walking on the water and jesus's spoken word was to come here is that true come on he said and peter got off the ship without the truck a test drive we must so we went to where we went we almost lost uh walmart we went to walmart we went to one of the places we came back and then everything was fine hermanos brothers when don't here we have the fulfillment of the initial scripture but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as foreign there were so but now here we're reading the fulfillment of that prophecy proving to us that jehovah is the same i will pour out my spirit upon allah they acted in such a way that confused the other people to think that they were drunk but this is the fulfillment of the prophecy this is and it says and your sons shall what your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams glorious glory to his name dreams and visions now i just want to say a few of them testimonial maybe just like a testimony i mean god use it in whatever way he wants to use it like gloria glory to his name a dream is when you're sleeping a dream is when you're sleeping now a vision is when you're awake again [Music] and a vision is when you're awake now one time paul was awake what was he doing we don't know but he was in a but then all of a sudden he sees a man from macedonia lomira he sees him as if i was seeing my brother [Music] there was no doubt that god was giving him the victory when god sends you then god is helpless when god sends you god god goes with you don't get worried [Music] then he will grant you the victory gloria glory to his name then immediately that a vision is when you're awake and i don't know how many of us that are here there's plenty of us here i'm sueno have had a dream or have seen a vision now there's no doubt has seen that yesterday now there are dreams that come from god blessed be the name of the lord there are dreams that come from god but there are dreams that are just simply dreams sometimes i think i'm the sheriff from the west but in fact i'm just running [Music] because the cops are after me but those are two different kinds of dreams but they're just simply dreams i don't know how many dreams but brothers i'm dreaming [Music] a while ago i mentioned that at one point in life i wanted to make easy money i put some gloves on i wanted to become a boxer it was easy money easy questions because the american dream do you think it's easy i knew that that was not my future but every so often you did i think one day even my wife had to say hey hold up just take it easy it's because i was in a dream that i was boxing that when we left that sister that was about to give birth i dreamt that she gave birth and now she was breastfeeding she was breastfeeding a little baby boy we reached the city limits of denver i told my wife [Music] and i asked her and i said sister how's everything we're now back we're here now [Music] how's it going with your little baby boy and brother tell you so i dreamt that it was a boy why do i know that it's a dream from god because and this is the part that i'm happy about it says and your old man shall dream dreams and your old man shall dream dreams and there are some dreams that you have to be careful with yes and it's this one that i'm about to say a month ago i dreamt of a sister from new mexico i dreamt that a sister from new mexico passed away i saw and i saw her funeral and i saw her name as well i had it a month ago and i have not called the sister neither have i called her children it's the first time i'm ever speaking i haven't even told my wife whenever you have a dream like that just wait don't don't go immediately to my house don't come and say brother i had a dream of you i saw you that you were in a drawer i dreamt that they died if oh in a casket rather if i haven't uh died then maybe i will by receiving those news that you give me can hormones and i have not called this family esperando esperando esperando i'm just waiting and waiting and waiting because if it would have come to pass would have already invited us to the funeral repetitive i'll say it again i know the sister i know who she is but i have not called her and if you hear that i'm preaching here this morning my brother's in new mexico and they're listening remember i didn't say a name nor so are we going to be careful with the dreams amen amen now there are dreams let's go to genesis chapter 20. the genesis of the book of genesis we'll begin with verse three capitulo de and abraham journeyed from dance toward the south country and dwelled between kadish and sure and sojourn in gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister did abraham say that a promise was given to them sarah would have a son isn't that right but in the humanity of sarah what did he do he doubted it sometimes we doubt my best is there's sometimes not always sometimes doubt does creep in there and it's something natural because we're humans brothers [Music] whatever god does with us we must testify of it glory to his name the people have to know that we serve a real god a living god a god that answers what you're asking so blessed be the name of the lord he said she's my sister [Music] what do you think about that abraham said she's my sister he said uh she said he's my brother they agreed on that because abraham said look they're going to kill me because of this because you're beautiful whatever god does he does it beautifully you don't have to spend 100 on whatever that thing is called max factor whatever it is [Music] god made you beautiful sister blessed be the name of the lord before coming to church how many of you looked in the mirror i did it just how as you are you stand up and look and you can say oh man i didn't know i was so gorgeous sometimes you even want a fame man you say man i didn't know i was so drop dead gorgeous it's just the mirror brothers i'm waiting for someone to tell me that it doesn't happen right glory to the name of the lord blessed be the lord [Music] god had rejuvenated abraham and sarah they [Music] now listen to this we're in the subject of dreams and visions god many times speaks to us through dreams do you believe it i believe in it i believe it that's the number gloria glory to his name [Music] god came to abimelech in a dream by night but god came to a boom like in a dream binding and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the man which thou has taken for she is a man's wife glory to the name of the lord when someone is sincere [Music] when someone does things correctly but god is careful with that and we see that god here took care of this we knew that the king did it because they said she's my uh brother and she's my sister isn't that right this is but in verse 4 but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord will thou also slay a righteous nation he didn't get closer he didn't touch her at all and she even she herself said he is my brother and he says in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands i have done this [Music] and god said unto him in a dream [Music] it wasn't a prophet saying this to him god is telling him the lord but through a dream that's why i'm saying that there are dreams that come from god and there are other dreams that are not from god there are other dreams that are just simply dreams yeah i know the dao did this in the integrity of die hard with healthy from sinning against me [Music] therefore suffered i thee not to touch her i want for he is a prophet everybody that many things that are done it's a good thing that they won't be taken into account because god knows your heart that's the number like gloria glory to his name amen he knew that the intention was never there god will help you to be able to overcome in triumph glory so it's good that there are mistakes that won't be taken into account it was a mistake that abraham made wrong it was a mistake that abraham is ceremonial they did it with the purpose to be able to preserve their life because they were going through a specific city that was dangerous because that through a dream god fixed that problem another one our brothers have spoken on this album it's not because we're talking about dreams and visions he made a statement and he said he said the spoken word is here we have to believe it on friday i took it for the tennis and now my truck is fine now my truck can get worse like sometimes we get sick we come here so they can pray for us because we have a headache and then on monday tuesday there's nothing there the lord healed us now notice the difference healing is something that happens gradually [Music] you were even though you leave through the that's what happened with that black man that was blind he went with the barber to get his haircut brothers that are barbers i'm starting to notice that we have a lot of barbers here and i didn't know that before but i've invited some to go out to eat on saturday because i don't work saturdays and they said brothers i can't i'm a barber but the brothers that are barbers they'll understand [Music] and that man was giving the testimony of the meeting to his barber and the barber without her that was looking at this man but he was still believing healing sometimes can take weeks a miracle can happen immediately miracle can happen to you right now if you have a great excruciating pain in your legs or excruciating pain in your back excruciating pain in your head and [Music] back identifier he's white he looks like an american i couldn't go back but just to reminisce about years in the past and then they knock at our door a young man of 13 14 years of age [Music] i knew the city where i was at pretty well and then they came to ask her if certain brothers lived at this place just like when there were people that came to peter's house when cornelius sent messengers to peter's house asking does peter live here and the reply was yes they and they told us that you pray for the sick and they're asking if you can come to our house to pray for our sister after we heard that we narrated to a young american boy whose name was tim he was around the same height as ben chavis he was just as skinny as him maybe a bit taller and timothy he came from the city of louisiana and he came to preach to us a young man dedicated to god this is something that happened about 40 years ago i was still back then in the organization i was barely giving my first steps in the organization and when it came that we had to go to this address and they asked me if i knew where it was and i said i did and i said um i know where it's at well but i do remember timothy he was the one that was going to pray for the spirit the young man that came from louisiana a young preacher i was 13 14 years back then yeah and now we were on our way when we got to the house we knocked on the door they opened the door for us as soon as they opened the door for us the horrible the horrible shrieks or yelling that you've ever heard what is the most horrible yelling you've ever heard from the from the yoronas i don't know what other kind of horrible yelling you've ever heard in your life but back then at that short age of 14 that was the most horrible yelling i've ever heard and it was coming from the house where we were going to germany there was a young girl tied in her feet in hands she had long hair and she has such a and i began to send timothy in the front the bed would actually move those demons brothers the bed would move brothers and it was such a scream no i'll leave this for later but i'll finish with this we got close to the bed timothy in the front and me right behind him brother juanita was barely starting out and when we got close enough that's something that girl all of a sudden stops the girl was telling him i know you how do you think brother juanito that was in the back how do you think he fell [Music] that demon did know [Music] i was brand new [Music] i [Music] imagine what god won't do today [Music] and she began to move and move the bed and when timothy was done with his prayer there was just such a serenity that was felt that was so calm blessed be the name of the lord her mother got back and and part of her hair she was a very pretty young girl a brother's uh when a demon takes possession that situation becomes very terrible illegal [Music] and then her mother got close got the pillows closer to her and then she got a bit closer she began to look at us and then brothers thank you gracias thank you so much her mother and her we're saying thank you dreams and visions divine healing how many things has god not done with us [Music] time is never on my side may god help us this morning i appreciate you with all my heart i have another dream that i want to mention but i'll leave it for next time may god bless you may god be with you is there someone that has a need just as you are sitting down if you want you can come forward we have five [Music] because he was waiting for something [Music] for them that had a need lord by faith we know that you're here

right hand being raised so man your right hand being raised that's for every one of us so this morning therefore we declare that there is no doubt that you will answer to every one of them to their need i don't know what it is on friday i had one yes and the lord answered me no i knew that me there's no doubt in me [Music] for a super faith to come into us and we believed it and we only spoke the word and we left believing it igracias where in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you brothers [Applause] believe [Music] is and be with you what else [Applause] [Music]
