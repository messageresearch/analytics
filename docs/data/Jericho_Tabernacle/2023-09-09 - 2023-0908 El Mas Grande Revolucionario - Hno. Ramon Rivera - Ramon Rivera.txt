well to the hands of our God and we know that in the Bible says that I just want to read a base scripture which is the base scripture of why we do this Mark 10 13. this is and they brought young children to him that he should touch him and his disciples rebuke those who brought them Jesus but Jesus saw it and he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come up to me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God so if you can please just bow your heads we can pray thank you [Music] and Lord gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord we're here with the family [Music] for we know that the Bible says that even though even though I wasn't even in the womb of my mother you still knew me for we know that everyone that came into the Earth is predestinated for a certain purpose and you take care of the child just as you took care of Moses Jesus and you took Jesus you can also take care of this child and Lord we plead and ask for your blessings we always Camp around them [Music] and to keep forward on the Walk of God we also asked for the fathers may you help them may you give them the wisdom that comes from your word so they can guide their little little child and also the rest of their families and Lord we ask for this blessing for we know this comes straight from your word and we ask all of this Lord Jesus Christ [Music] no problem [Applause] [Music] [Music] this time we'll be entering into the word of God [Music] it's going to be brought forth from our brother Ramon Rivera Emmanuel Santos Marco Santana and his interpreter brother Marco Santana uh how many are in prayer amen may God give us what we need today for he is Lord for when we sing this song for his Lord amen [Music] four years his love [Music] I need his love every day [Music] that you thoughts [Music] for you he is [Music] [Music] within the day [Music] foreign [Music] it's a pleasure to greet every one of you this evening [Music] very well Brothers I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ this beautiful evening that we're sharing Ordonez [Music] for trusting the pulpit with me in this hour to voice the word of God and to our Brethren of the government of this church [Music] I also thank you for granting me this place and Brethren before beginning I wanted to ask the musicians if they please don't leave is I always like to sing a song before starting if I'm gonna have you still standing at this moment but I'd like for you to accompany me with this song because I feel that every one of us we need to renew ourselves in the Lord amen amen the song is called renew me I believe that we all know it is that right Amen Let us sing it brother and let us gain Trust [Music] you're together [Music] [Music] everything [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] order [Music] Ed their eyes [Music] [Music] [Music] this is [Music] we all need more of our Lord Jesus Christ and that's the reason why we're in this place we've come to fill our hearts to fill our spirit like a brother would say and to recharge the batteries stuck it's good being made around us forgive me brother we're going to read a scripture gracias our brother and our musicians thank you so much you're very kind yeah we're going to read a scripture which is the basis of this small thoughts yo small thought that the lord gave us is came to me when I was listening to something about a very famous leader there in Mexico [Music] I don't want to say his name but he's the one that governs all of Mexico and he was asked if he was a Christian or if he was a Catholic Cristiano if you're a Christian or you're a Catholic foreign [Music] but I want to follow the footsteps of Jesus I want to follow his Footprints because Jesus was the opposer in his time against all the government in the system against him to the point where those that were governing there they condemned him and they killed him he didn't say many words brothers pero Perez but that came to my heart and I said well I'm going to speak to my brothers about that it's been so many years that I haven't stood behind a Pulpit honestly I tell you and I'm not here to start lying to anybody but the word of God is always burning in my heart and I hope that with all all of my heart that's something of this part of this message can serve you for good can help you in your walk and can guide you Allah on to the footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ this could be me forgive me we're in Matthew chapter 10 verse 34 . the word of God says if you found it already passed Espada think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I am come not to send peace but a sword and in the gospel of Saint Luke chapter 12 verse 51 . and he says the same thing but in a different form this is a in signals the interrogation in the form of interrogation like that of a question no suppose ye that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you nay but rather division is you can read the following scriptures 52 and 53. it'll say it's be father against the son against the Father the daughter against the mother the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law and it says all of that there why to follow Jesus Jesus the other isn't foreign because he's come to put division is Cristiano but what about you which is firm and a Christian that has to continue the footsteps of the Lord if you like to be seated forgive me brother is this theme is called the greatest revolutionary maybe the word revolutionary might sound a little exaggerated when talking about the Lord Jesus Christ existed revolutionarios but in the word of God there exists many revolutionaries if you go to the Old Testament Brothers you'll find out that Joshua was Joseph was a revolutionary when he was a young man he had dreams and he had Visions I'm not going to read it to you you've read it and you already know it Joseph had Visions he saw that he was seated upon a throne and his his brother were beneath him like worshiping him as they worshiped him him so he had those Visions even being a young man you know how he was sold by his brothers how he was taken to Egypt the Lord had to place him in a prison [Music] as second in charge over the whole country the Egyptian people and the and the Israeli people his brothers from dying of hunger I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit yeah foreign before continuing I'd just like to say I believe it's prudent um that I can present myself before you all I'd like to share a small testimony of my life and it's more so so that those people those brethren nor did they know my family cuatro we got here to this message in the year 2004. in uh in the Iglesia Garcia at the church of our brother bernabe Garcia and we got there by the attendance of a brother that he attends here his name is Alfredo Sosa he's got more or less the same age as I have he works alongside with me in the company is and he was hired the same day that I was hired I was in the denomination he started to speak to me of the prophet every time that we go out to eat bring me a message and talk to me and I'd listen to him he started placing a seed in my heart he had plenty of patience brothers because he started doing this since the year in 1999. all the way to 2004 five years had passed so that I could come to the feet but better said so I can come to the message my family and I were already Christians but we came to get to know all of this and we just fell in love yeah and we've been here for all the years of our life alfredo no libros brother Alfredo he gave me some books some books that impacted me so much books of the prophet foreign I know that you've read it that that book it impacted my mind it just shook my brain and I said Within Myself this makes sense this makes sense I started going back to the word of God and I compared them he graciasuke denomination thank God that impacted me so much I was able to get away from the denomination and I could embrace the message Anton says so then going back to what I was telling you thanks to our brother alfredo sauce he had the patience to work with me they call me familiar and with my family and for my whole life I'd be grateful for that to the point where just a small testimony I'd like to tell you so that you can get to know me better okay I come from a very small town I was born in a town called Veracruz about 40 kilometers north of Veracruz [Music] when I was born there wasn't any electricity in that town I pertain to a very humble home my father didn't have land we just worked off we just lived off of what he worked doing economics and we live very difficult Financial situations it's six of six brothers Una Yuna Romano it was five males and one female he is and the situation is very difficult my father immigrated to the city of Veracruz there he found a better job foreign and then once in the city we could prepare ourselves we could study my father worked very hard so that we can get an education we isos we're very proud for that the Lord took me when I was in the sixth semester mechanical electrical electrical engineer is some of you know that I'm a mechanical electrical engineering I went and I took my exam and I passed there in veracruzana they're in the Veracruz University and also my brothers and I tell you this Brothers not to think that I'm something great but just so that you can see where the Lord took me out of from the sixth semester of engineering I wanted to know why the moon wouldn't strike the Earth [Music] I wanted to know what happens when two cars Collide how to build a turbine um and how a combustion engine works that took me that drove me to study all that I studied but then the day came where I said and I said who was it that formed the Earth the one that formed the Earth if within the Earth lies the materials and the steel which we make the cars with we can build a car and we work the steel but who placed it there who put the moon there yeah who put the Stars over there amen entrances told us of buenos so that all that that I studied then for what is I wanted to know what why this is how the Lord took me yeah and I started to follow the lord Jesus Christ someone spoke to me of the Lord Jesus Christ and then I understood it in my heart there was no other solution so then briefly Brothers just wanted to say this for those Brothers they don't know my family we come from there yes we were with our brother Bernie for some Years also with the brothers and now here we are Familia this has been our family our brother obedience from way back in those years up to now Los Angeles and the years don't pass in vain bien Hermanos very well Brothers but let us continue Brothers the females about the greatest revolutionary [Music] um and I'd like to just abbreviate real quick the [Music] the word revolutionary the word revolutionary according to the dictionary as means a person who's actively participating in A revolution is a person that's a part of ideologies a revolutionary ideologies is and another dictionary it says someone who stirs things up and a turbulent person but Brothers in in el mundo avido muchas personas but in the world there's been many people of this type with ideals and because of time I'm just going to show you a few examples that are more significant chronological chronologically the first Revolution and revolutionary that I remember was called robespiere this man Maxim miliano Robin he started the French Revolution taking the Baton Paris there to to Paris and he rebelled he rebelled absolutismo De Los Reyes against all of the absolute of the Kings if you've read a little bit of the French Revolution you know that the king had the absolute power within his hands the revolutionaries they stripped That Power from the King they got him out him and his wife Mary antonetta is we're talking about Louis XVI is to sum it up that was the French Revolution and it was established um during the leadership of this man robespiere declaration They promoted the Declaration of Independence of man either and of the citizens that established a series of basic rights for all citizens he was executed in 1964. who liberated and did great things was Abraham Lincoln foreign unto his death principal Motivo era abolition his main motive was to abolish slavery de los afro-americano of the African Americans in all the states of the Union as many of us already knows the 23 states of the north they were against slavery and all the southern states they were in favor of slavery discuss the separation of the states in parentheses separation it was the Civil War that we had in this country Abraham Lincoln tried to come and to work with the Southern States but the southern states they started the war tomando Uno de los fuertes De Los Estados Del Norte taking one of the taking one of the strongholds of the states in the north and you know how Abraham Lincoln he died there's a message of the Prophet brother Branham that's called a paradox it says like this Brothers when I was a young man I'd sit down and read my history book I was reading one day Abraham Lincoln and I saw there were Abraham Lincoln he got down from a train there in New Orleans and they were selling a slave a black slave location and they wanted to use him to to mix him with other large women to create better slaves they wanted to mix him in with a large statured women Abraham Lincoln took off his his hat and he squeezed his uh fist he was also from Kentucky he said he said that's wrong and he repeated again that's wrong and the prophet said even I say that's wrong God made man el hombre is man-made slaves amen amen we could mention some other revolutionary man brothers that were leaders and then thousands of people followed themes trying to change the social economical system the surprise of their country like Vladimir Lenin and Russia in Russia Mahatma Gandhi and La India Gandhi in India in Mexico in Mexico we should we can mention Juarez that would take away all the riches from the Catholic church and separate the church the government from the church foreign and I believe we all know about these two revolutionaries both fought for their ideals for a more just country para los Mexicanos for the Mexicans but both also paid with their lives every one of you knows that they were killed yes and murdered they were persecuted and murdered see was murdered Zapata and I'm sure there in the south being very well es the ideals and the change the form and the way that we were able to realize these changes through our Lord Jesus Christ we can see it clearly sermon on the mountain was the first place Brothers the first sermon the Lord Jesus gave us he got up to the mountains and he saw the multitude without a pastor it is and and forgive me and he said this is and it's chapter five six and seven of the Book of Matthew I'm just going to show you a few but you can read it easily at home he declares unto his disciples the beginning of his kingdom Christo convert in this message the Lord Jesus confirms and reaffirms the Mosaic law um as the core of his Earthly Kingdom the Earthly Kingdom that is coming in Matthew 5 17 it says don't think that I've come to stir up the law or the prophets I haven't come for that how many of you have read this amen amen the Lord Jesus also tells us that the attitude of man for this shall determine his place in King in heaven erate in the kingdom and if anyone were to break these Commandments the least shall be called in the Kingdom of Heaven but whoever would do so yes and would teach them shall be caught great in the Kingdom of Heaven foreign and the intention amen amen in verse 27 of chapter 5. have you heard that it was said thou shall not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever look it's on a woman to lust after her you have committed adultery with her already in his heart and If thy right eye offended pluck it out and cast it from for it is profitable for thee one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell the perfect standard of Justice required by our Lord Jesus Christ is in chapter 5 verse 48. be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect is perfect us today they're in this dispensation what happens with all the redeemed because we're not under the laws we are under grace Romans 6 14. for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace amen amen I would add to that the paragraph that says in John 1 12. he came to his own but his own did not receive him but to all those that received him he gave them power to become egos sons of God those which the word says which are redeemed Los cuales which were redeemed I mean that's the part that I added there's a message it's called the exposition of the seven Church ages and it says it doesn't have a paragraph in Divine service you always hear the words of man then the word of God of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power to bind all that's left is losing power just that thing is was necessary to go back to Christ to look to Christ as the only leader and to walk in his footsteps in elementary and the message go and tell my disciples paragraph 41. the life of the great men they remind us we can make our lives and we leave behind us footprints in the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life's solemn Maine a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother alberlas shall take their heart again the Revolutionary system of our Lord Jesus Christ it was very distinct EMA the cameos revolutions to the system of change that these revolutionary leaders have have had that have existed on the earth throughout all the ages because the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 5 43 this is you have heard that it was said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy bless them that curse you I said do that do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you might be the children of your father which is in heaven for you make it the sun rise on evil and the good and send it rain on the just and on the unjust he left us instructions on how to pray he taught us not to judge the rest he left us the Golden Rule how many remember the Golden Rule I thought that if we all follow the Golden Rule Church would be something else and the world I'm going to read it for you in case somebody forgot so all things that you want man to do to you do also unto them for this is the law and the prophets this is a thought that breaks everything if you want a cold glass of water in the time of heat you've got to First give it to your neighbor you understood me in a few words that's what the Lord is trying to tell us if you want something more [Music] maybe you want some expensive shoes first give the shoes just the way you want them the 200 kind for example he is you stayed in that opportunity and you'll have the opportunity that someone could give it to you it's got to start with yourself we're always waiting to come from another um well the brother is going to bring me some cake first you take it to them that's it it says that's the Golden Rule forgive me to close this Brothers I want to tell you that when the Lord was here on the earth as a human being just like us he also rebelled against what was established I don't know if you remember he made a act with the court before templo and he went to the temple and then he destroyed everything he flipped the tables and he scolded all of them you made the house of my father um a den of Thieves oh Los governantes the governors of this time this day on that day they were offended they looked for a way they look for a word how to trap him to imprison him and then kill him that's why Jesus always told them their truths to their face he's called them Hypocrites white and sepulchers there on the outside you look beautiful but on the inside you're full of rotten bones of worldliness [Music] a code of righteousness for all the Christians they believe in his name yes and we're waiting for his coming he is our leader Cristiano because to be a Christian is to follow the footprints of the Lord Jesus Christ to continue his footsteps is to be like Christ apart from the book of Acts you can also read when he appeared to the Apostle Paul in a light they blinded him and knocked him to the ground amen amen why do you persecute me it's hard to kick against the thorn amen amen if the musicians can come forward if they can please come forward if you can understand we're going to be praying let us give thanks to God for his word is what we brought this evening is just a part of the testimony we've got so much
