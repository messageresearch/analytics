[55:59] before we go into the message we'd like
[56:02] to give you a quick update
[56:07] I'd like to give you
[56:09] the trip we had to El Salvador
[56:16] I'll be saying a few words and
[56:20] our brother Galvez will be saying a few
[56:22] words and then
[56:24] brother luiso oh
[56:28] I'll say a few words and bring a message
[56:30] to you yesterday
[56:34] [Music]
[56:37] we first thank the Lord for
[56:40] being here once again
[56:44] it's good to be home
[56:48] casa
[56:50] it's good to go out and fellowship with
[56:53] the brothers
[56:54] in El Salvador
[56:57] buenos Salvador
[57:04] but first I'd like to mention that
[57:06] brother Eli is in Chandler
[57:09] China Church preaching this morning
[57:15] brother Marco Santana and Emmanuel
[57:18] Santos are in South Carolina
[57:23] [Music]
[57:27] and so let's keep them in prayer
[57:33] you know Mark 16 uh talks about the the
[57:36] Great Commission
[57:40] says to go out and preach the word
[57:44] preach the gospel
[57:47] so us as a church
[57:52] if we're capable of yes
[57:56] to go out and preach the word
[58:00] then then we should go out maybe
[58:05] we can help them
[58:09] or maybe they can help us
[58:13] but when we arrived at El Salvador
[58:18] we're actually there for about a week
[58:22] foreign
[58:35] the pastor there is Eduardo Gonzalez
[58:41] and the name of the church is
[58:49] foreign
[58:55] The Living Word of San Salvador they're
[58:58] the ones that invited us over there
[59:03] we were there for the 17th anniversary
[59:06] of the church
[59:11] and uh
[59:13] their Pastor their first pastor Pastor
[59:17] his name is brother Galvez
[59:22] the father of our brother Galvez
[59:27] he was a pastor for about 40 years
[59:34] and they've had many ministers
[59:38] visit them in the past
[59:41] visit they have a lot of history over
[59:45] there
[59:47] so it was an honor for us to be there to
[59:50] celebrate the 17th year of the church
[59:54] they're in now
[59:59] we were able to fellowship with them
[1:00:03] talk to the ministers there
[1:00:06] we received a few invitations to return
[1:00:14] we talked to other pastors from other
[1:00:17] countries there
[1:00:21] the countries are real small foreign
[1:00:41] so once again it's it's really good to
[1:00:44] fellowship with them so I don't know
[1:00:49] like we know when you have someone from
[1:00:52] out of town come into your church yes
[1:00:58] it creates a little excitement
[1:01:03] it creates a little Revival
[1:01:08] and uh
[1:01:11] it was good to be there
[1:01:15] uh brother Galvez
[1:01:18] he was our bodyguard
[1:01:23] our chauffeur
[1:01:24] he's the one that showed us around
[1:01:28] that's his hometown
[1:01:31] and we're privileged to know him
[1:01:34] Brothers
[1:01:45] God bless you Brothers
[1:02:05] I would just like to thank you for your
[1:02:07] prayers
[1:02:10] and I also want to thank the Lord for
[1:02:12] being able to take us and bring us back
[1:02:14] home safe
[1:02:17] my throat is a little sore it's like if
[1:02:20] I were to be preaching over there
[1:02:25] and my brother at least I preached every
[1:02:27] day came back like nothing
[1:02:30] that's the difference between the ages
[1:02:32] right
[1:02:43] but we do want to thank our pastor and
[1:02:46] brother Luis to be able to go and visit
[1:02:47] our our country
[1:02:53] where there is a group of people that
[1:02:55] love the fellowship and love the world
[1:02:59] and they love our brothers
[1:03:03] and then the most humble and simple way
[1:03:07] that they can do it
[1:03:11] they try to demonstrate the love towards
[1:03:13] our brothers
[1:03:17] and they send their greetings in the
[1:03:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:03:29] and just how they know us over here they
[1:03:33] we they know them over there as well
[1:03:38] because you preach something in the
[1:03:40] words of that we were written the
[1:03:41] pistols
[1:03:49] they might not know us but they know
[1:03:51] where we come from in the church that we
[1:03:52] this is
[1:03:56] so I won't take too much time so I could
[1:03:59] leave some time for brother Louise
[1:04:03] Paul
[1:04:07] said it was an honor and a privilege to
[1:04:09] be over there with them and be their
[1:04:11] bodyguard is
[1:04:21] and I want to thank the Lord because I
[1:04:23] know he took care of them but it did
[1:04:24] feel a lot of pressure to be able to
[1:04:25] take them and bring them back
[1:04:30] so when we arrived I think the door and
[1:04:33] I felt like a big burden fell off of my
[1:04:34] back
[1:04:36] is
[1:04:43] it's a great responsibility to be able
[1:04:46] to take servants over to a different
[1:04:47] country and and take care of them
[1:04:56] for them to be a blessing and to be able
[1:04:58] to enjoy the places over there
[1:05:03] so once again I want to thank you for
[1:05:05] your prayers and your support
[1:05:08] may the Lord bless each and every one of
[1:05:11] you
[1:05:18] God bless you Brothers
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:29] so we're going to speak about a little
[1:05:31] bit about what happened over there in
[1:05:32] the country of Salvador
[1:05:34] um
[1:05:42] and the way that the fellowship had been
[1:05:45] created between us and the people from
[1:05:47] El Salvador as cuando of
[1:05:49] Julio was when we went in the month of
[1:05:52] June July Joy sorry
[1:05:56] um San Jose California there was a
[1:05:59] brother from San Jose California
[1:06:00] yesterday
[1:06:07] and this brother found a way to go back
[1:06:09] into his country is
[1:06:14] and our brother heard the testimony of
[1:06:17] our brother Marco Santana
[1:06:20] so when this brother was going to return
[1:06:22] back to his home
[1:06:26] he told them they you know he should
[1:06:28] invite brother Marcos to come
[1:06:32] is
[1:06:38] that was the dwarf open for us to be
[1:06:41] able to go and have fellowship with the
[1:06:42] people of Salvador yeah
[1:06:47] so in this last moments this past couple
[1:06:50] weeks
[1:06:54] so the church where our the father of
[1:06:57] our brother Galvez administered
[1:07:01] now the pastor that there is her brother
[1:07:09] he called us and he invited us to be
[1:07:12] able to attend the anniversary services
[1:07:14] that they were having he he is
[1:07:20] so we placed it in the hand and the Lord
[1:07:22] the Lord's hands and he opened up the
[1:07:25] way to be able to go
[1:07:28] so we arrived there February 9th on
[1:07:31] Thursday
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:33] in the Church of our brothers
[1:07:37] he said the the word of the Living God
[1:07:42] so that Thursday
[1:07:47] we United at our sister's home of Galvez
[1:07:53] which is the mother of our brother
[1:07:58] galvezia they're the pastor United a
[1:08:01] couple of the youth there from church
[1:08:06] and the brother permitted us to be able
[1:08:09] to speak a couple of words unto the
[1:08:10] youth um
[1:08:14] to be able to help them in their journey
[1:08:17] and to be able to for their spiritual
[1:08:19] growth services
[1:08:26] and on Thursday or Friday
[1:08:30] was the the initiation of the special
[1:08:33] services
[1:08:35] we had it there at the local church
[1:08:40] and it fell in our lot to be able to
[1:08:42] preach the word
[1:08:44] and Saturday
[1:08:48] we had a youth service in the morning
[1:08:54] Salvador a lot of brothers from
[1:08:56] different areas around El Salvador
[1:08:57] United
[1:08:59] Guatemala we have some from Guatemala
[1:09:01] Hermanos Nicaragua we had some from
[1:09:04] Nicaragua
[1:09:05] tremendous
[1:09:08] and the most tremendous part was that
[1:09:10] originally Los Hermanos
[1:09:14] they only really rented the place out
[1:09:17] for a Sunday
[1:09:20] but after they saw that a lot of people
[1:09:22] were going to arrive Anton
[1:09:25] so the pastor who got in contact with
[1:09:28] the location
[1:09:31] and he told them that we might need or
[1:09:34] we need to rent the location out one day
[1:09:37] earlier
[1:09:40] and we'll pay whatever it's worth you
[1:09:44] know tremendous
[1:09:46] so and the most tremendous thing is that
[1:09:48] the people there
[1:09:51] didn't charge them a bit
[1:09:54] they only really charge them for Sunday
[1:09:58] they didn't charge them for a Saturday
[1:10:03] so we saw that God was opening up the
[1:10:05] way
[1:10:06] um
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:10] and there was a young Minister there
[1:10:12] from Nicaragua that administered to the
[1:10:14] young people
[1:10:17] and likewise me as well I spoke to the
[1:10:20] youth Como Circle
[1:10:25] we had roughly around 105 young people
[1:10:28] there
[1:10:30] um
[1:10:31] and then on Saturday night
[1:10:36] our pastor brother ordone as he preached
[1:10:39] that night
[1:10:40] and I interpreted for him
[1:10:43] um
[1:10:46] the most tremendous thing was that our
[1:10:48] pastors
[1:10:51] that he had about 41 pages of notes
[1:10:56] and he didn't hardly use any one of them
[1:11:01] he was only speaking what the Holy
[1:11:03] Spirit was speaking and anointing them
[1:11:04] to say yeah
[1:11:07] so I would see in the hand of the Lord
[1:11:09] working through him
[1:11:11] and then on Sunday
[1:11:16] to speak again
[1:11:20] we had roughly about 200 people there
[1:11:23] yes
[1:11:25] and that was the first anniversary
[1:11:29] where the founding pastors
[1:11:31] the father of our brothers
[1:11:45] they were kind of felt a little sorrow
[1:11:47] in their heart to be there
[1:11:51] but they saw the hand of the Lord
[1:11:54] working
[1:11:56] pastor and by custom they're founding
[1:12:00] Pastor anniversario pastel
[1:12:03] every anniversary they would buy a cake
[1:12:08] and since the pastor wasn't there
[1:12:10] president
[1:12:13] Rolando they bought the cake that are
[1:12:16] that the brother really liked uh
[1:12:20] so it was a great privilege to be there
[1:12:22] amongst them yeah
[1:12:27] so after that we received a lot more
[1:12:29] invitations from different churches
[1:12:31] around the area
[1:12:36] and then on Tuesday we went to a church
[1:12:38] called The taberno Tabernacle of
[1:12:41] bethlehemas
[1:12:46] Calderon and the pastor there is
[1:12:58] a domination with along with our brother
[1:13:01] Galvez
[1:13:03] so they were both Elders
[1:13:09] so they were both two spies that opened
[1:13:12] up the way
[1:13:13] ayenne El Salvador in El Salvador uh
[1:13:17] so it was a great privilege to be among
[1:13:20] them is
[1:13:23] and in that church they have many
[1:13:25] musicians
[1:13:29] both brothers and sisters that play the
[1:13:32] violin
[1:13:33] Hermosa a very beautiful church
[1:13:36] and then on Wednesdays
[1:13:42] and we were invited to a church there in
[1:13:44] the capital of San Salvador like
[1:13:49] and the Tabernacle name is the voice of
[1:13:52] God El pastores
[1:13:54] and the pastor there is brother Ivan
[1:13:56] Cordova is
[1:14:00] a very beautiful congregation there
[1:14:03] yeah it's pretty small
[1:14:06] companies
[1:14:08] but it was a very clean fellowship
[1:14:11] and then on Thursday
[1:14:17] Julio we were there at the church where
[1:14:21] we were originally invited to back in
[1:14:24] July
[1:14:33] and the name of the church is the voice
[1:14:35] of the seventh angel Pastor Carlos
[1:14:39] Polanco and the pastor there is Carlos
[1:14:41] Polanco Alonso Pastor our pastor spoke
[1:14:48] Billboards uh Pastor spoke about the
[1:14:52] Billboards
[1:14:54] and I interpreted it for him
[1:14:59] and then I spoke a couple of words
[1:15:04] and we saw that the Lord came down in a
[1:15:07] tremendous way
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:09] and we had a prayer line
[1:15:16] and just to close all this
[1:15:18] Julio when we went in the month of July
[1:15:24] there was a brother that had an issue
[1:15:27] with his bones
[1:15:28] he couldn't move
[1:15:32] when we went to visit him in his humble
[1:15:34] homes
[1:15:35] he was laying down
[1:15:39] and he couldn't move
[1:15:45] which is the brother that you see here
[1:15:47] in the in the pictures
[1:15:50] [Music]
[1:15:55] the privilege to pray for this brother
[1:16:00] so all the days that we were there he
[1:16:02] never rose up
[1:16:05] until the very last day when we were
[1:16:08] about to leave at the airport
[1:16:12] his brother sent me a video that he was
[1:16:14] already walking yes
[1:16:17] and that we showed in the last report
[1:16:19] that we did when we came back yet
[1:16:24] so in the back of my head or my mind I I
[1:16:27] kept thinking where is this brother
[1:16:31] was it that he got sick again and Anton
[1:16:33] says
[1:16:35] and by our surprise
[1:16:37] once we got to the city
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:42] his wife invited us to go and have some
[1:16:46] soup with them is
[1:16:49] and the brother was there to receive us
[1:16:53] he was up and walking around
[1:16:57] and if the sister would continue with
[1:16:59] the photos
[1:17:02] here's the testimony
[1:17:05] of this product
[1:17:07] if you keep going
[1:17:13] there's our brother como como testimono
[1:17:16] as a testimony
[1:17:20] that prayer really works
[1:17:26] we see that the body can get sick
[1:17:31] he still has a little bit of shocks here
[1:17:34] and there in his body
[1:17:37] his spirit is
[1:17:41] healed is delivered
[1:17:44] and he's there as a testimony
[1:17:48] speaking and saying that the Lord has
[1:17:50] already healed them
[1:17:51] amen brothers
[1:17:54] please stand uh
[1:17:59] it was a privilege to be over there with
[1:18:01] her brother Jose and our pastor ordonos
[1:18:05] to be able to have that Fellowship um
[1:18:12] to be able to have a couple of laps and
[1:18:15] and be able to have Fellowship
[1:18:17] to be able to get to know each other a
[1:18:19] little bit more
[1:18:21] and I told our brother Jose is
[1:18:27] towards the end of the trip my brother
[1:18:29] Jose was a little bit sore from his
[1:18:32] throat
[1:18:34] as I told him brother you don't even
[1:18:36] preach one single day
[1:18:39] and just by hearing me you already got
[1:18:41] sore throat
[1:19:07] you're just going here left and right
[1:19:09] until you actually hit the mark
[1:19:12] is
[1:19:16] and it was a great privilege to be able
[1:19:18] to know those two brothers a little bit
[1:19:20] more
[1:19:22] and we're going to open up our
[1:19:23] scriptures
[1:19:28] and the brothers there from Salvador
[1:19:31] send their greetings
[1:19:34] the pastor Ramon
[1:19:37] Ivan and likewise the pastor brother
[1:19:41] Ivan is Carlos and Brother Carlos
[1:19:46] and all their congregations and their
[1:19:48] greetings
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:54] so we're going to go to Luke 15 verse
[1:19:57] 11.
[1:20:02] before we uh read the scriptures we're
[1:20:04] going to Bow our heads and and do a
[1:20:06] quick prayer
[1:20:08] dear heavenly father the universe
[1:20:12] Lord we thank you for everything that
[1:20:14] you have given us
[1:20:22] for the privilege to be able to go and
[1:20:23] bring us back from Salvador Padres
[1:20:27] and now Lord we're here to be able to
[1:20:29] speak a little bit about your words
[1:20:33] father we pray that you clean our hearts
[1:20:35] yes
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:47] and we subject ourselves under your
[1:20:50] power yoras
[1:20:53] and father we ask that you help us to be
[1:20:56] able to speak a little bit about your
[1:20:57] words
[1:21:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:03] amen amen
[1:21:04] nice and Lucas so we can go to Luke 15
[1:21:08] verse 11. he says
[1:21:12] and he said a certain man had two sons
[1:21:25] and the younger of them said to his
[1:21:27] father father give me the portion of
[1:21:28] goods that fall that followeth to me
[1:21:37] yeah
[1:21:41] and he divided unto them his living and
[1:21:44] not many days after the younger son
[1:21:45] gathered all together and took his
[1:21:47] journey into the far country and there
[1:21:50] wasted his substance with uh righteous
[1:21:53] righteous living
[1:21:56] you may be seated
[1:22:00] we're going to continue reading the
[1:22:02] scriptures
[1:22:07] hear the scripture that we're reading
[1:22:09] this morning
[1:22:11] it's a scripture that we know already
[1:22:17] as the lost son or The Prodigal Son
[1:22:22] the prophet speaks a lot about them
[1:22:28] so I would like to speak a little bit
[1:22:30] about this young man
[1:22:37] and the prophet speaks to us and the
[1:22:41] message the approach to God
[1:22:44] preached in 1955 the prophet says this
[1:22:48] way is
[1:22:52] okay pretty
[1:22:59] foreign
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:26] the prophet says that's correct there's
[1:23:29] no hunger no I peligro there's no danger
[1:23:32] there's no trials sufferings
[1:23:38] nothing can separate us
[1:23:40] that is in Christ Jesus
[1:23:44] when you are truly born again
[1:23:51] and the prophet tells us that in every
[1:23:53] congregation
[1:23:54] there's three types of Believers there's
[1:23:58] the unbelievers
[1:24:00] there's the make-believer and there's a
[1:24:03] genuine belief
[1:24:06] and the prophet tells us that within the
[1:24:09] genuine believer
[1:24:12] there's two that
[1:24:52] they
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:59] never went to the stage to be able to
[1:25:01] receive the holy ghosts
[1:25:03] that's why and sometimes we realize
[1:25:09] we feel that our batteries are going a
[1:25:12] little bit low yes was normal and that's
[1:25:14] normal but
[1:25:46] because there was a man that over there
[1:25:48] in Salvador did come up to me and
[1:25:49] approached me and he said brother
[1:25:54] I know that the prophet is a typologist
[1:25:59] I don't have here many people in the
[1:26:01] flesh family members
[1:26:05] does that mean that I won't have a
[1:26:07] family over there on the other side
[1:26:08] I told him look brother
[1:26:11] when you were born
[1:26:14] there was a father
[1:26:16] and a mother
[1:26:19] in order for you to be born here on this
[1:26:21] earth
[1:26:23] now when you are born again
[1:26:26] the prophet tells us
[1:26:28] we have a new father
[1:26:31] and we have a new mother
[1:26:34] Sangre we no longer have the blood
[1:26:38] of our last name
[1:26:40] we don't no longer have the DNA
[1:26:44] of our Earthly father
[1:26:47] and now we have the DNA Celestial of our
[1:26:51] heavenly father
[1:26:53] who is Our Father
[1:26:55] who is our mother
[1:26:59] when the disciples approached Jesus or
[1:27:02] the Pharisees I'm sorry
[1:27:05] they said we are the children of Abraham
[1:27:10] and Jesus said I know
[1:27:15] he never denied that they were the
[1:27:17] descendants of Abraham
[1:27:20] but he said if you were the children
[1:27:22] children of abrahamas
[1:27:25] you would do the same works as Abraham
[1:27:28] because
[1:27:31] looks just like his father
[1:27:34] acts like his father
[1:27:36] acts like his father
[1:27:38] and Jesus told them
[1:27:41] you are the sons of the devil
[1:27:47] so we see that when you are born again
[1:27:50] when someone be is able to
[1:27:54] uh be born again
[1:27:56] that is the beginning
[1:27:59] to be able to see to understand
[1:28:03] the kingdom of God
[1:28:09] because sometimes we want to start at
[1:28:11] the seventh step or the fifth
[1:28:14] but we must be born again
[1:28:18] our new mother and our new father
[1:28:22] but now the question is who is
[1:28:24] our mother
[1:28:26] it's God
[1:28:29] the word the word is our mother
[1:28:33] that's why we behave like
[1:29:02] and now every single one that's born
[1:29:04] again
[1:29:05] now he's my brother now she's my sister
[1:29:09] he is my brother
[1:29:13] Familia maybe here on Earth you might
[1:29:15] not have a big family
[1:29:19] maybe you're the only one in your family
[1:29:21] that accepted this message that believes
[1:29:24] this word
[1:29:26] but the moment that you are born again
[1:29:30] now you are inherited into a new family
[1:29:33] in the family of God
[1:29:35] amen brothers
[1:29:40] that is the reason why we when we go
[1:29:42] over to the past the curtain of time
[1:29:45] there is no more last names
[1:29:48] now we are all brothers and sisters
[1:29:52] from that which has been born again
[1:29:56] that's what the scripture says that who
[1:29:58] is flesh is the flesh
[1:30:00] it wasn't for the spirit is of the
[1:30:03] spirit
[1:30:06] when someone has genuinely been born
[1:30:09] again
[1:30:11] who can separate them from the love of
[1:30:13] God
[1:30:15] that Christian stands first
[1:30:18] between the tests and the torments
[1:30:22] the prophet says
[1:30:24] you can say
[1:30:28] I started out as a Christian once
[1:30:32] and then things started going this other
[1:30:34] way and that other way and then I
[1:30:38] started thinking
[1:30:42] I used to think that I was in a better
[1:30:44] conditions
[1:30:48] if you think that you're in a better
[1:30:50] condition before you met God
[1:30:54] you never came to God hermano my
[1:30:57] brothers
[1:31:00] if you once come truly to God
[1:31:05] and you begin to satisfy with the real
[1:31:08] gift of God
[1:31:12] participants of his divine nature
[1:31:19] you will never be able to be a sinner
[1:31:21] again
[1:31:24] you can never be the same person
[1:31:27] when you genuinely
[1:31:30] have tasted of the presence of the Lord
[1:31:36] the Lord has touched your heart
[1:31:38] it is very different
[1:31:43] for that person to go back into the
[1:31:45] world
[1:31:48] because now you have tasted of the
[1:31:51] things of God
[1:31:54] imagine a man eating from a trash can
[1:32:02] and then he comes into the home and then
[1:32:04] he eats on the table with steaks
[1:32:09] and then he says how can I ever return
[1:32:11] back into that
[1:32:13] if I've already tasted
[1:32:17] what is of God
[1:32:21] it is very difficult for that man to be
[1:32:23] able to return but if you
[1:32:25] know I don't want anything to do with it
[1:32:31] then you've never really genuinely come
[1:32:33] to God foreign
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:33:06] one has to be born again
[1:33:09] that is the beginning
[1:33:13] amen
[1:33:16] now in the description of Saint Luke 15
[1:33:20] when we read uh verse 13.
[1:33:24] we see that this man had two sons
[1:33:31] the prophet says that I don't know if it
[1:33:33] was the younger or the older but this
[1:33:36] young man yes
[1:33:37] he got tired of going to church
[1:33:42] if you think that the young people from
[1:33:44] the Biblical times
[1:33:46] we're different than the people of today
[1:33:49] they're the exact same thing the same
[1:33:52] character the same thoughts yes
[1:33:58] and this young man got tired of his
[1:34:00] father and mother telling him or taking
[1:34:02] them to church
[1:34:04] there came a certain pointers in his
[1:34:07] life
[1:34:08] that he wanted to be independent
[1:34:13] and he wanted his inheritance that
[1:34:15] belonged to him
[1:34:17] and he wanted to leave the his the house
[1:34:21] of his father
[1:34:24] now in verse 13.
[1:34:29] and took his journey into a far country
[1:34:35] and there wasted his substance with
[1:34:38] riotous living this is
[1:34:42] the prophet says that perhaps this
[1:34:44] father had a great land
[1:34:47] and he had to sell it
[1:34:52] his son wanted his inheritance right
[1:34:54] then and there
[1:34:57] and then the father said you know son
[1:34:59] you already know
[1:35:01] you have been born in the message
[1:35:04] don't do this
[1:35:07] but the young man was already decided in
[1:35:10] his mind
[1:35:11] and then in verse 14.
[1:35:17] foreign
[1:35:21] and when he had spent all there arose a
[1:35:24] mighty famine in the land and he began
[1:35:26] to be in wants is
[1:35:35] and he went and joined himself into a
[1:35:37] citizen of that country and he sent him
[1:35:39] into his fields to feed swine
[1:35:43] so then you can see
[1:35:45] where this young man ended up
[1:35:50] well you might say this is just for the
[1:35:52] young people
[1:35:55] no this is something Universal foreign
[1:36:03] but he wanted to leave
[1:36:07] and then we see that he lost all of his
[1:36:09] goods
[1:36:12] and we see that we find them there with
[1:36:15] the pigs
[1:36:17] you can see how low a human being can go
[1:36:21] where he can go on without God he can go
[1:36:25] so low
[1:36:26] that he could be with the swine
[1:36:30] this is and then in verse 16. it is
[1:36:42] filled with his belly with the husks
[1:36:45] that the swine did eat and no man gave
[1:36:47] unto him
[1:36:59] can you imagine how his father and
[1:37:02] mother must have felt
[1:37:05] they must say to each other we must keep
[1:37:07] praying foreign
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:48] wasn't in his right mind
[1:37:51] why wasn't he in his right mind
[1:37:53] C why is it that he came back to him
[1:37:58] sometimes we find ourselves
[1:38:02] where we want to go back into the world
[1:38:05] we want to commit those errors again
[1:38:13] but then we turn back to ourselves
[1:38:15] and start asking ourselves what are we
[1:38:18] doing what am I doing here in the in the
[1:38:21] bars
[1:38:23] what am I doing here with my friendly
[1:38:25] worldly friends coming back to himself
[1:38:29] like if someone was asleep
[1:38:35] telling me about his testimony on
[1:38:38] a child of a pastor
[1:38:42] and I I see that he told me that he went
[1:38:46] out to the world
[1:38:48] maybe one day he can speak to that to us
[1:38:50] Cristiano
[1:38:56] he was doing something that a Christian
[1:38:58] or a son of a pastor shouldn't be doing
[1:39:01] he almost went out to the street
[1:39:04] he didn't even have a single Cent to be
[1:39:06] able to call his father
[1:39:08] and he said and he told me it came back
[1:39:11] to himself
[1:39:22] if I
[1:39:25] have a mother that's always cooking
[1:39:29] what am I doing here on the street
[1:39:33] amen Brothers
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:39] sometimes that's how we feel
[1:39:42] coming back towards
[1:39:45] say what am I doing out here
[1:39:48] if I have very good prayers
[1:40:01] how many of my father's servants have
[1:40:04] abundance of my father
[1:40:07] and here I am hunger
[1:40:11] can you imagine this
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:19] they would have meetings after meetings
[1:40:21] and conventions after conventions with
[1:40:25] a table full of food
[1:40:27] foreign
[1:41:40] the floor mat in the front door
[1:41:50] a genuine repentance
[1:41:53] because the scripture tells us that it
[1:41:55] repents
[1:41:58] when a person comes back to himself
[1:42:03] because when you realize
[1:42:06] that you are a child of God
[1:42:09] not when you were born here on Earth
[1:42:12] you were here a child of God
[1:42:15] you were one before the foundation of
[1:42:17] the world
[1:42:19] you were a child of God before yourself
[1:42:24] and maybe you got lost
[1:42:27] but then you heard the word of God
[1:42:31] and then the word of God
[1:42:33] and when you came back to yourself
[1:42:42] you were a child of God before the
[1:42:45] foundation
[1:42:46] coming back to yourself
[1:42:50] and when you heard the word and you came
[1:42:52] back
[1:42:53] you repented
[1:42:57] you no longer want to be the same person
[1:42:59] you don't want to be out in the bars
[1:43:04] you don't want to be doing the
[1:43:11] I'm not going to stay here
[1:43:40] and there we find the genuine repentance
[1:43:46] foreign that's why the prophet said that
[1:43:49] I don't believe in a dry eyed repentance
[1:43:52] when you genuinely repent is
[1:43:58] Savor the true love of God
[1:44:01] then you genuinely feel what love is
[1:44:05] more
[1:44:08] drinks aren't loved
[1:44:10] the world is not love yes God is love
[1:44:17] and then we see in verse 19.
[1:44:21] and I am no more worthy to be called
[1:44:24] yourself
[1:44:25] make me as one of your hired servants
[1:44:28] make me a formatter
[1:44:38] and came to his father but when he was
[1:44:40] yet a great way
[1:44:43] so then we see that his father saw him
[1:44:45] from afar this is
[1:44:48] that is a key word there
[1:44:51] is
[1:44:55] how we were
[1:44:59] far away from the word of God
[1:45:02] far from the grace of God
[1:45:05] there was no human being
[1:45:17] so right then and there the fellowship
[1:45:20] between man and God was separated
[1:45:24] now there was no more Fellowship between
[1:45:26] God
[1:45:29] now the only Fellowship that there was
[1:45:31] was between the priests
[1:45:35] but then the second Adam came along
[1:45:38] which his name was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:42] and the scripture tells us that he
[1:45:44] reconciled us He restored
[1:45:48] that Fellowship between Gods
[1:45:52] now there's peace
[1:45:56] because man could not speak to God
[1:45:59] there was no Fellowship
[1:46:01] but the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:06] it was
[1:46:26] that each and every one of us
[1:46:29] that we may have fellowship with God
[1:46:32] that we can speak with God
[1:46:36] because of the blood
[1:46:39] through the blood
[1:46:41] the fellowship
[1:46:43] has been restored
[1:47:11] in the name of the Jesus Christ
[1:47:14] for the remission of sins
[1:47:17] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:47:20] Holy Ghost
[1:47:41] if you really want to know what the Lord
[1:47:43] Jesus Christ is
[1:47:46] receive that same spirit that was in him
[1:47:50] then you can have him in your heart
[1:47:57] because unto us is the promise
[1:48:00] there is the promise
[1:48:02] the gift of the Holy Ghost yes and it is
[1:48:06] for us
[1:48:08] oh so it's for me
[1:48:11] and for your children
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:15] so it's not just only for me it's also
[1:48:18] for my kids for my grandkids for maybe
[1:48:22] my great grandchildren
[1:48:24] This Promise is for everyone
[1:48:34] all those that are far off
[1:48:38] and then in Ephesians 2 13.
[1:48:42] but now in Christ Jesus
[1:48:45] Us in other times
[1:48:50] which were far off
[1:48:56] have now been
[1:48:59] have been made
[1:49:04] and one time you were away from God
[1:49:09] but through the blood
[1:49:12] now we've made ourselves a lot closer
[1:49:15] closer to God
[1:49:17] and it is not of our words
[1:49:20] it is because of the blood of the Lord
[1:49:22] Jesus Christ
[1:49:30] and in Ephesians 2 17
[1:49:35] and came and preached at peace unto you
[1:49:38] which were far off
[1:49:41] which were afar off
[1:49:43] he came
[1:49:46] and he preached the good news
[1:49:48] of peace
[1:49:59] peace between man and God
[1:50:03] because every time that God will look
[1:50:05] down
[1:50:06] and there was no blood
[1:50:10] God would get mad and repent that he
[1:50:13] ever made
[1:50:16] but when Jesus came and he was hung on
[1:50:18] the cross
[1:50:19] now there's peace
[1:50:22] between man and God
[1:50:25] when we were far off and now estamos we
[1:50:30] are now nigh
[1:50:33] Uno
[1:50:40] and now in Ephesians 2 1
[1:50:43] .
[1:50:49] and you have he quickened who were dead
[1:50:51] in trespasses and sins
[1:50:56] wherein in temp and time passed he walks
[1:51:02] so now we're speaking that in past times
[1:51:04] we were out lost in sin sigiendo la
[1:51:07] corre
[1:51:09] and just following the course of this
[1:51:11] world
[1:51:12] and when you see a river
[1:51:20] and together
[1:51:23] then you feel the stream pushing you
[1:51:27] but once you accept the Lord
[1:51:30] and you repent is
[1:51:44] it is very difficult
[1:51:46] it is not something easy it's something
[1:51:49] very difficult
[1:51:51] to go against the the world's course
[1:51:58] because here in the scripture says that
[1:52:00] according to the course of this world
[1:52:06] according to the prince of the power of
[1:52:08] the air quality satanas which is
[1:52:14] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:52:17] children of Disobedience
[1:52:21] among whom also we all had our
[1:52:23] conversation in time passed
[1:52:26] in the lust of our flesh
[1:52:30] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh
[1:52:33] and of the mind
[1:52:37] and we're by Nature the children
[1:52:45] so then we see that by Nature
[1:52:50] the children of Wrath are the children
[1:52:51] of this world
[1:52:54] which is the reason why it is very
[1:52:57] important to be born again
[1:52:59] and if you feel that person if you feel
[1:53:01] the anger
[1:53:03] if you feel those things of the world
[1:53:08] then it is very necessary to be born
[1:53:10] again
[1:53:12] so then we see that we are lost
[1:53:15] Allah
[1:54:15] and just as Jesus
[1:54:18] he called him by his name
[1:54:22] he didn't say that right
[1:54:25] no he called the individual foreign
[1:54:46] hey
[1:54:47] Lord say road is High there's many
[1:54:49] errors
[1:54:50] but there's also Grace there's love
[1:54:53] there is forgiveness for a sinner
[1:54:59] there is Mercy for each and every one of
[1:55:01] us
[1:55:02] that wants to receive that Grace
[1:55:05] I don't want Justice
[1:55:09] I want Grace
[1:55:11] everybody wants Justice
[1:55:15] I want Mercy
[1:55:18] because if I want Justice
[1:55:21] the first one that wants justice
[1:55:26] but I want Mercy
[1:55:29] I don't want God to see how I am
[1:55:32] because I'm not worthy
[1:55:36] only the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:40] that's why this morning you have the
[1:55:42] opportunity
[1:55:43] you don't know if you're going to be
[1:55:45] dying tomorrow
[1:55:51] only God
[1:55:55] and then we see okay
[1:56:00] that along with him he resurrected us
[1:56:02] yes
[1:56:06] and he said else upon the Heavenly
[1:56:09] places in Christ Jesus Christ when Jesus
[1:56:12] suffered I know he has fulfilled the
[1:56:15] bride suffered
[1:56:16] when Jesus was crucified
[1:56:19] the bride was also crucified
[1:56:28] but when he rose
[1:56:32] a bride also Rose
[1:56:35] this is enough today
[1:56:37] this is before the foundation
[1:56:40] if you find yourself it is
[1:56:46] because of Grace that you are here
[1:56:50] the greatest mystery
[1:56:54] it's not the Mysteries
[1:56:58] now I like to hear them
[1:57:00] Stadium but the greatest mystery of all
[1:57:03] when you bring me a drunk person
[1:57:06] and now he's a preacher
[1:57:10] when you bring me a prostitute
[1:57:13] and now she's a lady
[1:57:17] Mysterio that is the greatest message
[1:57:22] when God changes the human heart
[1:57:26] that is the mystery that people cannot
[1:57:29] understand
[1:57:30] which is the reason why we must be born
[1:57:33] again
[1:57:33] to be able to understand the kingdom if
[1:57:37] I haven't been born again
[1:57:39] then I'm not a children of God
[1:57:42] because I must be born again for your
[1:57:45] father to be God and for your mother
[1:57:50] to be the word
[1:57:53] and now in closing
[1:57:58] and then the father saw him from far off
[1:58:03] and he was moved under mercy and Iran
[1:58:09] and he went and gave him the Holy Spirit
[1:58:14] so we see that the Lord is not going to
[1:58:16] protect us
[1:58:17] he's going to run towards us
[1:58:20] he wants to have more fellowship with
[1:58:23] you
[1:58:24] more than you want to have fellowship
[1:58:26] with him
[1:58:28] foreign
[1:59:16] so then we also see that he didn't even
[1:59:18] have any clothing
[1:59:21] but the father took out everything
[1:59:24] the best that he has what's the best
[1:59:26] and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:59:29] he gave us
[1:59:33] and the ring means signifies the
[1:59:35] marriage between man and God is
[1:59:42] and let's kill it so that we can let us
[1:59:44] eat
[1:59:45] because my son
[1:59:47] was dead
[1:59:50] and is alive again
[1:59:53] so then the word relief
[1:59:56] you see the word live
[2:00:00] so you can see that he was alive
[2:00:04] and then he died
[2:00:07] and now he's come back alive
[2:00:09] he's been risen again
[2:00:13] it was a Revival that he had okay
[2:00:15] because the prophet says
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:30] is to revive what the individual is
[2:00:35] foreign
[2:00:41] that is the reason why the Revival is
[2:00:43] there
[2:00:44] is
[2:00:45] and now he and now he had been lost and
[2:00:49] now he is found
[2:00:52] your condition this morning brother and
[2:00:54] sister
[2:00:57] but we are here to preach you the good
[2:00:59] news
[2:01:04] is to be ready when the Lord
[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:08] you might have been in the message your
[2:01:10] whole life
[2:01:11] you might dress up
[2:01:16] but the main question is have you been
[2:01:18] born again
[2:01:19] have you received God's pardon
[2:01:23] have you received the gift of the Holy
[2:01:26] Ghost that's the question
[2:01:30] if you can please stand and the
[2:01:31] musicians come forward
[2:01:35] the opportunity for every single one of
[2:01:37] us is
[2:01:38] before us
[2:01:42] the mercy La Gracia Grace El Perron
[2:01:46] forgiveness
[2:01:48] is before every single one of us
[2:01:54] I don't deserve to be called your son
[2:01:56] I'm not worthy
[2:01:58] to be here in this church
[2:02:01] make me a floor mat
[2:02:04] but Lord I Thank You for Your Grace
[2:02:08] because if it was for my Works
[2:02:13] my works are as filthy rags before you
[2:02:17] but it's by grace that we're saved
[2:02:20] if you could please close your eyes
[2:02:23] if you could raise your hands
[2:02:26] and Worship the Lord say Lord
[2:02:31] us on father you know my heart
[2:02:35] father I've been in this church for many
[2:02:37] years
[2:02:38] and I've really understood
[2:02:42] that I've really been haven't been born
[2:02:44] again
[2:02:45] because I can't forget I can't love nope
[2:02:50] I can't stop doing these things
[2:02:53] but Lord I want to be a new creature
[2:02:56] I want a new nature
[2:02:59] I don't want the nature of my life
[2:03:03] I want the nature
[2:03:05] the nature of the word
[2:03:09] I want a blood transfusion
[2:03:12] take out those Blood Of The World
[2:03:17] Lord I want the blood
[2:03:19] may it come into my blood
[2:03:23] and I want you to baptize me with your
[2:03:26] blood Lord

[2:03:47] and now you my brother and sister
[2:03:49] what are you going to tell God
[2:03:53] if tomorrow you die
[2:03:57] and now you're before the Lord and God
[2:04:00] is going to ask you yes
[2:04:03] what have you done with the word that

[2:04:12] why didn't you accept my grace
[2:04:15] I offered it to you what have you done
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:21] because we can't approach god with our
[2:04:24] own words

[2:04:26] it is only by the grace of God
[2:04:29] my brother and sister

[2:06:10] hatred that I had in myself
[2:06:14] Lord it was because I couldn't get away
[2:06:16] from that Pride that I had in my heart
[2:06:18] and God is going to say
[2:06:20] yes you could
