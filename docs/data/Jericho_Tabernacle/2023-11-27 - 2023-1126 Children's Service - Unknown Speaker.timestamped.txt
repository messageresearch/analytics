[43:26] [Music]
[43:40] [Applause]
[43:54] bless you are you everybody hear
[43:57] me not yet can you hear can everyone
[44:00] hear me now amen how are we doing this
[44:02] evening is everyone feeling
[44:05] good I can feel the expectation rising
[44:08] from everybody's faces they're really uh
[44:10] expecting to receive something from the
[44:12] Lord and uh the youth and as well
[44:15] brother maros Saragosa and brother maros
[44:17] Santana have been uh putting in a lot of
[44:19] effort to prepare this play for you and
[44:22] uh it was a blessing for me just
[44:23] watching it and I believe it will be a
[44:25] blessing for you
[44:27] uh the whole theme about this play is
[44:29] basically Prayer Changes Things and
[44:32] there's a story in the Bible that speaks
[44:34] of a shunamite woman in the book of 2
[44:36] Kings chapter 4 who wanted a son and by
[44:39] the grace of the Lord the Lord granted
[44:41] her to be able to have a son but then
[44:44] that son passed away but then the Lord
[44:47] sent Elisha again to bring that child
[44:50] back to life now we know that's a Bible
[44:53] that's in uh that's in ancient history
[44:56] that's a story that's a part of history
[44:58] but now uh we know that God is still a
[45:01] god of Eternity that what he did in the
[45:03] past he can do today presently as well
[45:05] he's the same yesterday today and
[45:07] forever so what he did in the past he
[45:09] can still to uh do today because he's
[45:11] still the Eternal God so there was a
[45:13] story during our time during our
[45:15] prophet's time that he uh one day had to
[45:18] go pray for a boy who was dying and we
[45:22] know the story it was uh the story of
[45:25] when he had to to land his plane in an
[45:28] emergency landing because he there was a
[45:30] storm and then he uh God led him to a
[45:33] house where there was a woman who uh she
[45:36] compared herself to the shunamite woman
[45:38] if you remember the story and she called
[45:40] herself the Ana so uh basically we want
[45:43] to give you a play that shows a little
[45:46] bit of backstory of what happened to the
[45:48] child in the Bible but then modernize it
[45:50] and show how that applies to today so we
[45:53] have different scenes biblically and and
[45:55] then different scenes of how that child
[45:58] uh during brother brandom's time had to
[45:59] grow up and had to face the different
[46:02] influences if you remember when brother
[46:03] Bram talks about the the story he says
[46:06] that that child got with the wrong
[46:09] company so we're just showing different
[46:11] parts of that child's life how he uh got
[46:13] with the wrong company and that led him
[46:15] to be in that dying condition and so
[46:18] we're just going to show different plays
[46:20] about that so if uh you can pray for us
[46:22] and I I I know it's going to be a
[46:24] blessing it'll be a blessing for me as
[46:25] well
[46:26] amen and you may be seated Brothers God
[46:28] bless
[46:54] you
[47:24] for
[47:43] 2 Kings 4:
[47:47] 11-2 and also verses 14-
[47:51] 22 one day Elisha returned to Schuman
[47:55] and he went up up to this Upper Room to
[47:57] rest he said to his servant gahaz tell
[48:01] the woman from Schuman I want to speak
[48:03] to her when she appeared later Elisha
[48:06] asked gazi what can we do for her gahaz
[48:11] replied she doesn't have a son and her
[48:14] husband is an old man call her back
[48:16] again Elisha told him when the woman
[48:19] returned Elisha said to her as soon as
[48:21] she stood in the doorway next year at
[48:24] this time you will be holding the son in
[48:26] your
[48:26] arms no my Lord she cried oh man of God
[48:31] don't deceive me and get my hopes up
[48:33] like that but sure enough the woman soon
[48:36] became pregnant and at that time the
[48:38] following year she had a son just as
[48:41] Elijah had said one day when her child
[48:45] was older he went out to help his father
[48:48] who was working with the Harvesters
[48:51] suddenly he cried out my head hurts my
[48:54] head hurts his father said to one of the
[48:57] servants carry him home to his mother so
[49:00] the servant took him home and his mother
[49:02] held him on her lap but around noon time
[49:05] he died she carried him up and laid him
[49:08] on the bed on the man of of God then
[49:11] shut the door and left him there she
[49:14] sent a message to her husband send me
[49:17] one of the servants and a donkey so that
[49:20] I can hurry to Elisha the man of God and
[49:23] come right back
[49:32] Lord my
[49:35] son why Lord why
[49:40] Lord you you made a promise to me
[49:43] through your Prophet Elijah Lord why my

[1:15:24] walking on I went walking on down first
[1:15:28] thing you know I come over into the side
[1:15:30] of the river part there I found myself
[1:15:33] down in a little color
[1:15:35] District bunch of little shadies all the
[1:15:39] sun was high I looked at my watch was
[1:15:43] was already
[1:15:44] 7:30 I was then good two miles from a
[1:15:49] hotel but something just kept saying
[1:15:52] walk
[1:15:55] and I started singing that little song
[1:15:58] that you Pentecostal people
[1:16:00] sing uh people almost everywhere whose
[1:16:04] hearts are all of flame with the power
[1:16:07] that fell on Pentecost that cleans and
[1:16:09] made them clean oh it's burning now
[1:16:13] within my heart Oh Glory to his name I'm
[1:16:16] so glad that I can say I'm one of them
[1:16:19] you know that song I just heard him
[1:16:21] saying it and I was humminging
[1:16:24] and I looked at a little old shack there
[1:16:28] and a leaning across the gate was a very
[1:16:31] typical old A J
[1:16:34] Mami she had a man's shirt tied around
[1:16:37] her
[1:16:39] head great big fat
[1:16:42] cheeks I was about 40 yards from her I
[1:16:46] was humming that song and I just quit
[1:16:48] humming it passed on by not knowing oh
[1:16:52] it was a beautiful morning morning after
[1:16:54] the storm the Roses the honeysuckles the
[1:16:56] fragrance just just bursting into the
[1:17:01] air and I was singing in the spirit as I
[1:17:05] moved along and this old colored woman
[1:17:09] when I passed by she said good morning
[1:17:13] Pon now a minister in the South and then
[1:17:16] I can say I'm one of
[1:17:19] them oh one of
[1:17:22] them I'm one of
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:29] them oh one of
[1:17:32] them I'm one of
[1:17:35] them and I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[1:17:39] one of them good
[1:17:41] morning oh good morning
[1:17:48] Auntie how' you know I was a person I
[1:17:51] known you was coming
[1:17:53] and how did you know I was coming did
[1:17:55] you ever a read in the Bible about that
[1:17:57] shunamite woman well I sure have I is
[1:18:01] that kind of woman I promised the Lord
[1:18:03] that if he gave me a son I would raise
[1:18:05] him to in the God's glory the lord gave
[1:18:08] me a fine boy but Parson he's got with
[1:18:11] the wrong company and he caught some
[1:18:12] social
[1:18:13] disease doctor said there's nothing we
[1:18:15] can do for him he's in the other room
[1:18:18] dying I can't stand to see my baby die
[1:18:19] in these conditions I prayed to the Lord
[1:18:22] all last night
[1:18:23] and at 2:00 this morning I fell asleep I
[1:18:26] dreamed I was talking to the Lord and
[1:18:28] said you gave me this baby like the
[1:18:29] shamonite woman but where is my Elisha
[1:18:33] Lord told me look and I seen a man
[1:18:35] wearing a tan suit and a tan hat just
[1:18:37] like yours it was you Parson I've been
[1:18:40] standing here at the gate waiting for
[1:18:41] you God's work on both
[1:18:44] ends well Auntie my name is brandham
[1:18:48] have you ever heard of me no sir Parson
[1:18:50] brandham I never heard of you well I
[1:18:54] pray for the
[1:18:56] sick when I went to that house no rug on
[1:18:59] the floor and little old iron bed bed
[1:19:03] Steed and a great big huge black boy
[1:19:06] laying there about 180 lbs about 6t tall
[1:19:10] I looked around that little old house
[1:19:13] and little old stove sitting there one
[1:19:15] of those little step stoves and a sign
[1:19:17] on the side of the wall saying God bless
[1:19:20] our home but never did I feel any more
[1:19:23] welcome than I did in that little negro
[1:19:25] Shack that morning because God was there
[1:19:29] and as I walked in that big boy was
[1:19:31] laying
[1:19:32] there pson he hasn't spoken a word in
[1:19:35] days he's
[1:19:36] dying
[1:19:38] well why don't we
[1:19:46] pray let us
[1:19:48] pray and I thought that poor fellow I
[1:19:53] fell of his feet just as stiff and icy
[1:19:56] as they could be and she said begin to
[1:19:59] pray and oh my you talk about a prayer
[1:20:04] that old black woman rendered a prayer
[1:20:06] to God that would make the hardest heart
[1:20:09] cry I stood there and just bathed in the
[1:20:12] beauty of God while she was
[1:20:16] praying now will you pray
[1:20:20] Parson yes of course
[1:20:25] oh Lord heavenly father I just don't
[1:20:28] know why you L me down here this little
[1:20:30] Shack Lord but maybe it's just a
[1:20:33] place but Lord I can feel your presence
[1:20:36] here this morning Lord and I know that
[1:20:38] Lord I just can't understand but I just
[1:20:42] pray you help this poor little dear
[1:20:45] saint of yours who stood Faithfully
[1:20:48] Lord Lord I just ask you to help her
[1:20:52] Lord and spare the life of this young
[1:20:54] man right here
[1:20:56] Lord Mama yes honey what does mama's
[1:21:00] baby want mama I can't see a
[1:21:03] lie that shows love though he would
[1:21:06] disgrace her home though he was dying in
[1:21:10] sin and and disgraced with the venal
[1:21:14] disease yet that Mother's Love still
[1:21:17] regarded him as her baby then think
[1:21:20] about the grace of God and less than 5
[1:21:23] minutes time that big boy was sitting on
[1:21:25] the side of the bed giving glory to
[1:21:31] God talk about Sovereign Grace the faith
[1:21:35] of that ignorant colored woman grounded
[1:21:37] that plane and it held it there my when
[1:21:41] I think of those things and the many
[1:21:43] I've seen I think how rich how pure how
[1:21:47] fathomless and strong the love of God is
[1:21:50] for a poor insignificant peasant
[1:21:53] ignorant colored woman but her prayers
[1:21:56] grounded that plane and held it there
[1:22:00] and sent me down there to pray for that
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:21] boy
[1:22:46] how many enjoyed the play and how many
[1:22:48] other children understood what happened
[1:22:50] to that boy that if you get with the
[1:22:52] wrong wrong company eventually it can
[1:22:54] lead you to a dark condition and
[1:22:57] something amazing that struck me about
[1:22:59] uh this play and the things that brother
[1:23:00] Brandon says about it is that so quickly
[1:23:04] the condition of that boy changed he
[1:23:07] said that first of all the boy said that
[1:23:09] he felt that he was in a dark place he
[1:23:11] said it was in the ocean rowing his boow
[1:23:14] and that he was in a dark place but
[1:23:16] after brother randam said he said within
[1:23:18] five minutes he said he could see the
[1:23:19] light and and he was praising God so
[1:23:22] that's how quickly things can change
[1:23:24] when you pray because Prayer Changes
[1:23:30] Things amen and so one of the things
[1:23:32] that I was thinking about that struck me
[1:23:34] when I was hearing brother brandham and
[1:23:36] I was watching them practice for the
[1:23:39] play was something that brother vom says
[1:23:41] about that boy he says that that boy was
[1:23:44] in that condition lying and that for
[1:23:46] some reason he says that he felt that he
[1:23:47] was out in the ocean on a little boat
[1:23:49] rowing his boat and he said that it was
[1:23:52] dark out outside and for some reason I
[1:23:54] kept thinking there has to be a reason
[1:23:56] for that there has to be a reason why
[1:23:58] him in that dying sinful condition God
[1:24:01] has him out in the ocean alone at dark
[1:24:04] and then I started thinking myself how
[1:24:07] one time our lord Jesus when he was here
[1:24:09] on the earth he sent his own disciples
[1:24:11] out onto the ocean by themselves and the
[1:24:15] Bible says that at evening time Jesus
[1:24:17] went out to a mountain to pray but his
[1:24:20] disciples were already out in the water
[1:24:22] and the Bible says that around the hour
[1:24:24] 3: to 6 in the
[1:24:26] morning that's when the waves started
[1:24:29] rocking the boat the winds begin to pick
[1:24:31] up pace and begin to go stronger and
[1:24:33] began to rock that
[1:24:35] boat now one thing that brother Ram says
[1:24:37] is that Jesus always appears at the
[1:24:40] darkest
[1:24:41] hour so does anyone know what the
[1:24:43] darkest hour of the day
[1:24:45] is it's in the morning time between 3
[1:24:48] and 6:00 in the morning so Jesus
[1:24:51] literally with his own disciples
[1:24:53] appeared at the darkest point of the day
[1:24:56] because what brother random says that's
[1:24:58] the truth Jesus always comes at the
[1:25:01] darkest hour but just at its darkest
[1:25:04] then when Jesus comes he's the son of
[1:25:07] righteousness so that's exactly what
[1:25:10] happened with this boy he was in a dark
[1:25:12] condition just like the disciples but
[1:25:15] then Jesus came and quickly everything
[1:25:18] changed so what must we do we when we
[1:25:23] are in our darkest moments we must pray
[1:25:25] to the Lord because Prayer Changes
[1:25:28] Things and it can change it so quickly
[1:25:30] within five minutes like it did for the
[1:25:33] disciples and like it did for this uh
[1:25:35] woman with her boy amen so if we can
[1:25:39] please stand we're going to welcome the
[1:25:40] musicians and the song
[1:25:42] leader we're going to Worship the
