take control of the ears that hear me because faith cometh by hearing our faith this morning also bless the musicians and what remains of this service we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen just as we're standing i'd like to go to deuteronomy chapter one verse 19. we're going to read up to verse 21 and when we departed from horeb we went through all the great and terrible wilderness which he saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadesh barnea entonces and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god hath given to us behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee and go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers has said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged previously last time i spoke on sunday i mentioned that we're almost finishing the year of jubilee prologue but then i started to study again one of your the lord gave it to me a few months ago and in these last days i believe i've received confirmation after confirmation that this is the message for today [Music] that's why last time the previous times i spoke on those themes [Music] questions and answers on the holy ghost paragraph 173 here if you would turn with me you don't have time i know now persistence but if you would turn to deuteronomy the first chapter and read it you'll see the same thing marking it down deuteronomio el capitolo primero e comenzano con el presidente elena the first chapter now and begin at the 19th verse and read through the 26. deuteronomy you'll find out now look all of israel when them people do they come to caitis barnia now notice what brother branham says oh i see something this tabernacle world is encodes moments is that cades barnea right now that's exactly right brother neville estamos encades we're at cades barnea where people will receive judgment based upon the decision they make in regards to the promise god gave them for their dates but the brandon also says because jesus the great king and judge the one that's seated at his throne ayanel calvario there at calvary he received the judgment of all of our sins there were 12 men if you accept christ's promise or us or if you don't accept it you're going to suffer the consequences in philadelphia and unto the angel of the church in philadelphia right these things saith that is holy he that is he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shut it and no man openeth it is i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name when the age of the open door began is in philadelphia it started in philadelphia like i mentioned last time it started with the missionary age it started with missionaries that went to various parts of the world a specifically to preach the gospel the gospel as i mentioned it consists of two parts the preaching of the gospel your i fulfill that part los micioneros apartments the missionaries fulfilled that part of philadelphia and that was during the time of philadelphia but once lauda began a and the open door has to do with that philadelphia the second part of the open door is fulfilled the second part of the gospel the predication the preaching in philadelphia in philadelphia the power of the gospel when lawrence began our if you study the message of philadelphia brother branham touches on every single part of jesus and the open door is jesus that's why this age is not the open door loud because first of all they're closing the doors to their heart it is and that spirit's going to materialize in the literal churches but we're not allowed to say that just like the israelites they were in egypt but one to the revelation of jesus christ to the rapture and with the jubilee vamos alert we're going to read isaiah 51 61 this is the prophecy of the jubilee spirit the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he anointed me to preach good tidings of philadelphia and how did philadelphia begin with the preaching of the gospels the good tidings verse 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord the year the acceptable year of the lord is the year of jubilee the acceptable year of the lord jesus in lucas and brother branham never understood why it was that that happened until god showed him that the first part pertained to his first coming pentecostal which says is the day of vengeance of our god he says that that part pertains to his second coming that's why he never read the read the second part it didn't pertain to his first coming but it pertained i believe when they were going to put the cornerstone in the tabernacle branham at the branham tabernacle he had a vision and in that vision the voice told him read second corinthians chapter second timothy chapter 4. speaks to timothy and there's many parts there but what i want to focus on you notice he wasn't told that he is an evangelist he started having evangelistic campaigns though he was a prophet he started as an evangelist do the work of an evangelist being that the year of the jubilee came recorded remember la gracias brother branham says that america rejected god's grace in that prophecy of second timothy chapter four he says that for some reason and he says for about 30 years preaching in that tabernacle i don't know why i never read the second part it is jesus that's because just like jesus when he read the prophecy of jubilee una parte the jubilee in that prophecy of uh to second timothy chapter four they're connected we're going to read a quote from brother branham from the message the junction of time i that we're living just at the near appearing of the second time of the coming of the lord jesus this time he's coming as a king of glory to take vengeance upon all who obey not the word of god remember brother branham says that in the stars you can find the bible and in his first coming was virgo he was born of a virgin we could say the second important star is leo the lion and when he comes for the second time he comes as a lion now the day of vengeance we're going to read the scripture of the second coming of our lord jesus this christ first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16. of some time in the message and have now studied we understand this talks about the second coming of our lord jesus christ i want you to pay much attention to what i'm about to say increasing for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout with the voice of archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first of all then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord yes [Music] now spiritual brother branham says that the trumpet means spiritual war iguera es critoral and scriptural war in canada in every age el mensahiro the messenger of that age a trumpet would sound also says that trump means feast and gathering of people that's why he says that the rapture is a revelation it's a revelation because the trumpet sounds there'll be a squeeze gathering all the to and with and and the first voice which i heard was that was as it were a trumpet with talking with me which said come up hither and i will show the things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne all right now brother branham says in revelation chapter four part three is the apocalypse revelation four one despot after the church was gone a door was opened and we went through all of that and found that was christ was the door and the same voice that was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and was also the same voice he heard in heaven saying come up hither juan subion john went up eso represent that it represented the church going in the rapture people take revelation 4 1. and they say that's the rapture and it is because it says come up hither [Music] jesus what does jesus do here in revelation 4 1. there's a voice of archangel and he joins it with the trumpet of god to resurrect and he said let's go to first thessalonians chapter four yes without before reading it the same voice that sum and john come up the same voice that said to john come up islamism is the same voice that summons the church someday amen summons the church and also the same voice that summoned john to come up here is the same voice that summoned dead lazarus out of the grave that same voice of archangel christo christ is the voice of archangels the same voice summoned lazarus did you notice that at the grave of lazarus he spoke with a loud voice trumpet voice of a trumpet voice of archangel the same voice we're going to show it to you a little more we're going to read from the message revelation chapter four part three paragraph 106 now i'd like to comment this in primera in first thessalonians where it speaks about the second coming of our lord jesus christ we think that that scripture only speaks of the future but with the message on the resurrection and the trump for the different rapture but there's two things that make the voice of an archangel it's resurrection it's resurrection yes and it's judgment recorded says that it was two archangels miguel gabriel michael and gabriel that got set unto fire came from heaven for those that accept the message of their day yes and it's judgment but for those that reject the message now let's read the quote an apocalypse revelation chapter four number three let's turn to exodus 19th chapter of exodus and 16th verse brother branham here is just reading scriptures and it came to pass listen what when god ascended upon mount sinai a contest it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a voice of a trumpet exceedingly loud all right in espanol now in spanish and it says the sound of a trumpet uh so that i believe it was last sunday and only a single person was able to overcome that what happened the sound of the trumpets but that person that received the message she lived let us keep reading in paragraph 168. god said assemble them together i'll let you know what it is i'll show them what it is read and listen and the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder until it shook the earth you see what judgment is i don't want that then misericordia give me mercy what did he descend no enzo gloria shakina not in his shekinah glory but in the wrath of his judgments bowser voice of archangel is resurrection is resurrection and it's judgment but also voice of archangel it produces two things and tremble terramotos earthquakes elements in the message of the rapture in paragraph 168. here it's talking about the crucifixion of jesus but the rest said let us see whether elias will come and save him notice this jesus aviendo jesus when he had cried with a loud voice he yielded up a loud voice grant was observing loud voice watch volcan voice of screamed with a loud voice it was hiding god's throne but the true throne of god el calvario was at calvary brother adam says when the veil was wrenched one could see from the window the temple the ghost and behold the veil of the temple is rhett and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks did rent graves were and many bodies of the saints that slept the rose they arose and came out of the graves de and his santos of those that were sleeping were awakened and going out of the the the two of the graves after the resurrection into the holy city and appeared unto many was that voice of archangel it's judgment and jesus was receiving our judgment yes resurrection and that's resurrection voice of archangel is a loud voice cross dimensions earthquakes got to that place for a period of time three days later the bible says well he was at the tomb angel descended and there was a great earthquake and the stone was removed voice of archangel resurrection is judgment and resurrection it produces and it produces fear and earthquakes you read matthew 27 when 27. when he cried with a loud voice he said that those that were there were were fearful now voice of archangel is a very loud voice let's go to job 37 hope mismo experiment job himself also experience the voice of god verse 1 here attentively the noise of his voice and the sound they go with out of his mouth he directed it under the whole heaven and the lightning unto the ends of the earth despues brahma is he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay and he will not stay them when the voice is heard god thundered marvelously with his voice great things he doeth which we cannot comprehend was the trumpeter voice of trumpet the voice of archangel is judgment and resurrection jude chapter 1 verse 9. just notice the words that he uses here diablo disputant yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses does not bring does not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuked thee in espanol now i like it better how it says in spanish you say arkansas says archangel body of moses because moses himself experienced the voice of archangel cuando branham brother branham says that he died and his body was not did not was corrupted and he was raptured and in the mountain of transfiguration he appeared with elijah jesus and with jesus the reason why he went through that because he is a type of christian christ died but his body was not corrupted he resurrected and he was raptured now the clown is la peluca the cloud is the wig of the judge the cloud also is god's throne god transports his throne [Music] that there was a great explosion a great sound a thunder que that it was like a roar he says in the message trying to do god's service without it being god's will something said to me turn it right i forgot to bring the article about the clown but you know that the prophet about the cloud the prophet had to turn it over the christian to be able to see christ's face when that angel descended unto the tomb of jesus hero la piedra he moved the the stone circle there's more about that but there's not enough time he said turn it to the right you see what it is the cro the head of christ for hoffman hoffman at 33 years here look in here see his black beard his face his eyes nose and everything else you see the part of his hair right here he's the universe of the universe supreme judge of heaven and of earth in the message the patmos vision pelo blanco this is white hair antigone anybody knows that those are the old judges in the ancient days like english judges used to wear a wig snow white and here he is showing that john over in that's also the voice of a trumpet trumpet voice of trump voice of archangel jose voice of thunder islamism it's the same voice here's the key that connects to catas barnia depends when they hear the voice ventidos the father in saint john 5 22. let's go to john 5 22. there's a judgment further on in the future del for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will poor el padre and for the father judgeth no man but have commanded all judgment unto the sun verse 25 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they and they that here shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given the son to have life in himself also giving him authority to to execute because he is the son of man today for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation every human being in the past in this present time and in the future and he was raptured this quote first in the message what is the attraction on the mountain paragraph 144. the very next day standing there a whirlwind came down and blasted the mountains out rocks cut the top of the trees about three or four feet above my head made three big blasts hermanos vigneron coriendo and the brothers come running over there was about 15 men standing there preaches and everything else give way what is it he said what was it i said judgment is striking the west coast about two days after that alaska the earthquake almost sunk alaska they said it was a whirlwind an explosion an explosion judgment earthquake alaska that almost drowns alaska salmon psalm this scripture will explain why it took place that way the voice of thy thunder estava was in the whirlwind the lightnings lightened the world and the earth trembled and shook when the earthquake that almost drowned alaska took place i thought it was during the same time in 1963 when the cloud appeared but it wasn't so gifts my brother angel he answered some of those questions young foundations a young foundation sent to my brother a calendar las vegas important appeared and the 27th in alaska is when the earthquake of alaska took place today is the 27th in alaska for instance the great earthquake in alaska never has been an earthquake like that in all the world sevilla did you notice it came on good friday so it's no way this could have happened in the month of april and on that calendar yeah yeah the young foundation they're from young foundations it says it was the 27th of march and google so what i did i got on google and surely it was on the 27th of march today is the 27th of march and when god jesus used the voice of archangels it was in matthew 27. would he use the voice of archangel that was in verse 15. cincuenta this date is very important i believe he also uses the word voice of trumpet says that they're killed they're placed in the plaza in jerusalem produces fear eaten and and trembling a tremble an earthquake el raptor let's go to the message of the rapture paragraph 191 save i know the voice of archangel produces fear but in california but for our brother and there in california how much more would god have to protect the bride that's in california asi como rabe just like rehab de la noble she is a type of bride god protected though there was judgment and earthquakes around the entire in california i believe god's going to protect our brethren in california it says here in the message the rapture from brother branham just los angeles will go beneath the ocean i see diesel senor thus saith the lord it will estaba she is done she is washed she is finished i don't know when pero dida remember many of you men standing right there that rock los angeles now he starts to speak of los angeles and then he starts to speak of the world when they're in 64. and that light and fire falling from heaven around the rock where we were standing there rocks flying out the mountains and flying across there she blasted three times hard and i said judgment would strike the west coast alaska two days after that alaska almost sunk all right now i written a message okay that's titled ashamed and elijah says preach in 1965. julio uh the 11th of july he said that when he did that in california he was unconscious the first thing that he remembered is that he was on the street with billy and another brother he wasn't conscious [Applause] and it's on the tape do you know that brother johnny was there what a privilege jude 1 7. even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities of them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth as an example suffering the vengeance of eternal life now and i like how it says in english they were placed set forth as an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire if god wants to condemn a city he took that same doctors heal yourselves brother brother mata says that brother branham says it's because maybe jesus jesus had a fractured leg heaven and speaks about the great works that were done there brother branham says the great works that were performed there in capernaum because it means that the resurrection is going to take place and the rapture but it's also judgmental for those that reject the message not of the past but of their present day many people accept jesus on calvary but they don't accept the message of today they'll be saved they'll he'll hear voice of archangel in the white throne judgment jesus in el calvario but just because they believe in the cross of jesus at the cross on calvary doesn't mean they'll go in the rapture you've got to be born again those of you that went if you remember when we went to sabino canyon these are enormous rocks one is over here on this side like right up here and one others like down here come on for you are not come unto the mount that might be touched that burned with fire nor blackness nor darkness and tempest also needed and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which the voice that they which heard and treated that the that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned and or thrust through with the darts here talks about mount sinai they were receiving laws because they rejected the grace of their date and it was so terrible and so terrible was the site that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake the bible says that we have not got close to that mountain syno and to an innumerable see that you refuse not to speaketh for if they escape not who refuse them to speak on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from he that speaketh from heaven because when jesus comes the heavens and the earth multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decisions the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall withdraw the shining the lord shall also roar out of cyan another is voice from jerusalem you shall know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy ye and there shall no strangers pass through her anymore and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as if it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire had in his hand a little is open and set right up set his right foot upon
