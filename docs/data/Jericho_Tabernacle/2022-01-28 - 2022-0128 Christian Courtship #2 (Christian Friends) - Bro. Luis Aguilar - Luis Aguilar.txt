to speak in the most cleanest way we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen brothers if you can open up your scriptures or basic scriptures that we have and he uh that is found in hebrews the 13th chapter verse 4 once again it it does me really good to see every single one of you here names it shows that that you are interested to hear god's word questions [Music] this is our base scripture and i would like for everyone and especially the young people to memorize this scripture hebrews 13 4. marriage is honorable in all and the bed on the foul but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge and the other version that we read last time it says marriage should be honored by everyone this is everyone should honor marriage what is honor to give respect to it and the marriage should be kept pure i am once again i'm really glad to see you here especially after a message like that on sunday especially [Music] we're going to speak on our second message of christian courtship and we're going to put a subtitle last week we we spoke on several subjects and i would like for the brother if they could put that pyramid for us again on the steps of courtship amen amen we have it in english and we have it in spanish in espanol the first step is friendship the second step is courtship third is confession fourth is the word of promise or the engagement the wedding ceremony the ceremony the wedding supper la sena de la voda the honeymoon luna damiel and then the intimacy the bedroom spiritual what it is what are our walk with christ a man amen but this is here in the natural natural and i would love for the young people to memorize those steps we left last time on speaking on the wedding vows we we read the wedding vows that the minister reads to the couple wisely uh saviamente and all those definition definitions he told us amen amen no one should come into this without advice we should come in with this with the fear of god amen now we're going to continue where where we left off almost going to continue where what a young man should be looking for and the message choosing of a bride brother branham says now for it's becoming if a christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman regardless of what she looks like that's what she is what makes her lo and then again that reflects his own godly character reflection for his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans of his home por los planes polos planes futuros de solar if he marries one of these little modern requests sex queens uh modernized what could he expect de que puede esperar what kind of home could a man expect to have que tipo de garpo if he marries a girl that ain't got enough moral about her she said to stay home and take care of a house and wants to go out and work on somebody's office what kind of housekeeper will she be you have babysitters and everything else so if you if you chew and you break down what brother branham just said analysis is something very very important he said he should choose a genuine born-again christian he says of what he wants in the future brother branham said he went to a christian man's office one day and he had christian music on christianity and he had a bunch of crucifix on the wall and he had a picture of his wife in the office she had she was dressed in a certain way but it wasn't a christian way she had makeup on and so forth and brother brown says i don't care what that man tells me if he has christian music on christianity he dresses like a christian christian it shows me that he is not a christian christian i'm going to say that again when i see his wife juan dobellos was supposed to act a certain way a certain way it doesn't matter what that man tells me i'm important he's showing me his heart amen amen have you heard brother brown say that before i don't know either brown you see that says the woman reflects the man reflection whenever you want to see a man look at his wife me that's supposed to be how she is look at her character if she always wants to fight that's how if you want to see the stage or the level that church is in sierras iglesia it is by the woman in the church if you want to see the level of what that church is at if you want to see how where jericho is at look amen amen amen do you love the lord amanda senor well you say well brother the sister told me she was born again and the brother told me he was born again how do we know he's born again by their it's something that is tested something that is proven someone that's a man a young man that's born again there's fruits behind what they're saying are you amen you love the lord amen when a man says well look i'm born again i love the lord young man that has the holy ghost that wants to talk to a young lady it doesn't matter how old that man is 16 years old 18 years old 20 years old 22 years old and they're still fighting with mom and dad they're still yelling at his parents they still want to bully his kids his siblings he still wants to fight toe-to-toe with his dad mature enough for a responsibility [Music] it's going to act like a young lady she's going to dress like a young lady not dressed like the modern girls of today when there's young ladies they dress sometimes they have these now there's new modern style where they have shirts that are up to their belly button young ladies shouldn't be showing their so people don't look at them and and the parents they let the daughters dress like that they say what honey it's fine dressed like that the parent knows how they're dressing and let them i'm going to say that again young ladies should dress their age they shouldn't be showing their skin it shouldn't be showing their bodies a young lady should act like listen to the message the invisible union of the bride of christ has been gave given to her a sacred trust sacred trust that they should keep it amen amen well if you go back to that message and study it except three things her sacred virginity her sacred feminism and her sacred motherhood [Music] again three things that god has given the young ladies three sacred virtues that she should keep her sacred virginity her sacred feminism marriage is the oldest institution in the world a woman is entrusted with certain characters the womanhood is speaking of of here is her conduct her character around men not letting every man know and it just says several points not letting every man no deja que todo los sombres now she's been giving three trusts that she should keep her sacred virginity he says well go and test drive it if you guys don't cope together you're not meant to be together but if you guys don't live with each other how do you know he's the one woman should keep her virginity and her womanhood her feminism don't talk like a man no hables don't walk like a man don't dress like a man you you were giving this this this this this virtue to be like a woman and to give to bring forth life she can be forgiven if she defiles them but she cannot be justified in this life it was given to her amen i encourage you to study that message the invisible you you know the bread of christ now i'm going to read another quote here the ram says i think today we got so many divorce cases now divorce we leave the world in america in divorce cases in america we leave the rest of the world the more divorce is here than anywhere else this national and i think the reason of it is what does the prophet say why there's so many divorce cases if a not just look over a pretty set of eyes or big strong shoulders or such as that or some worldly affection because but we'll look first to god a young lady but when the young man approaches her that young lady should pray god is this your plan is this is what you have for my life why it's a serious matter that doesn't mean just because you chose the right person it's not gonna be an argument and if we could study what we're doing is the chapters and so forth that's what you got to do study study yourself study the scriptures young ladies before you get into into marriage a man should pray why should we pray why should we pray earnestly [Applause] will send you to help i differ of what you just said you can choose the wrong card he said he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice i love i i love that god doesn't leave anything out because i don't have to feel anything and he says it said amen but if he knows that he's making a wrong choice that's enough let's go home let's go home that's it yes you want to keep going amen amen but if he knows that he's making the wrong choice and he's marrying a woman that isn't fit to be you told me that it was here you know that she wasn't supposed to be here you marry her anyhow it's your fault but i went with the pastor pastor yes yeah that's fine the pastor's gonna give you his best advice he's only gonna give you what he knows but it's and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you is you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through it don't go through it unless you have prayed over the matter because if you know that he's the wrong one and if you know she's the wrong one in and the church there's no good looking people at church there's only two young men at church there's only three young ladies at church there's a testimony of a brother that marries someone from the world we can only base ourselves on god's word what the prophet of god told us you see ahab was was reigning in israel in israel over israel and he was the wickedest of all the kings of israel there had been no king as wicked as ahab foreign nothing being taught but he kept continuing to please to displease god and everything he did although he had a great military system and the people had become very prosperous under his reign you cannot displease god and expect to get to get by very long you cannot displease god and expect to get by very long and then in his wedding no doubt that jezebel was a beautiful woman and he had fell for what he had fell for what she looked like instead of what she was that so many people make the same mistake today we can't base ourselves on testimonies of other brothers and we're glad that the brother or the sister converted their spouse but we can't base ourselves on their testimony we can't based ourselves on that we can only base ourselves on god's word and the prophet told us under no one of the others going to be converted the unbeliever is going to get converted to be a believer or the believer is going to be converted to be an unbeliever but someone is going to get converted brother branham said he had failed for what she looked like instead of what she was that so many people make the same mistake today and you have to the young man should pray over this matter because whatever you choose is going to reflect who you are is going to amen amen it's a very serious matter and it's the same thing with christ we reflect christ the way we behave the way we act at home the way amen so so friendship what is what is the first stage friendship let me start amen right let's open up our scriptures to first timothy chapter five but i think that uh we're going to be finishing up pretty soon first timothy chapter 5 verse 1 rebuke not an elder we see elders at the church sometimes the elder comes to you and and tells you look i have a piece of advice for you young man don't rebuke him no no treat the younger men as your brothers verse 2. the elder woman has mothers the younger sisters with all purity hermanas so the young man how should he be treating a young sister with all purity with respect don't be disrespecting her no faltered even before you get to that friendship stage the young man at home should be treating all the young people young ladies with all purity don't disrespect them and he would tell his he would tell his young man his son he says don't ever do anything to a young lady that you don't want a young man doing to your sister don't ever do something to a young lady that you don't want your your a young man to do to your sister treat them without purity they're your sisters in christ the young ladies to treat the young men as brothers in christ what kind of friends should we have amigos let's go to hebrews chapter 10. on the 21st 24th here it says and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works so what should a friend be doing he says provoke say consider to provoke not not not to provoke onto anger or to do bad things but to provoke onto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more than thomas and you see the day approaching so we're looking for a christian friend what a friend should be doing they should be provoking one another onto good works even though you say brother that's a little religious don't you think okay i'd rather have list i'd rather have them listening to tapes good friend amigos that good friend amigo will provoke you to do good work it won't provoke you to stop doors or to tell you to stop coming to church one another so tell one another look i'm gonna go on tuesdays we're gonna go on fridays even though at the end of the day you're gonna go to look at the young lady not because there's a young lady that we like or because of this young man that we like i only come to church because that young man comes let's say because a young lady comes no we should come to church with the true [Applause] and to stimulate to keep congregating in the church first thessalonians chapter five uh verse 11 therefore encourage one another and build each other up just as fact as you're doing so what what should have again what should a friend be doing amen amen brother branham says now if now if there's a true fellowship the man of brandon muchacho conocer la muchacho and he says to her he thinks she's so pretty and she's found of him and they want to have fellowship a real fellowship before and it's based upon the trusses or the their pledges to each other and i and then holy wedlock and then we enter in a lifelong fellowship but before we can enter in that fellowship there has to be an agreement first i want to re i want to repeat what brother branham just said because i went to the second step and i went to the third stage and i'm already married that fellowship between one another so stay between you to become friends to be friends and he says before you can get into that there has to be an agreement so no one can enter into anything forcefully now there's two types of friendships that we have amigos we have the normal or the superficial friendship normally then we have what is called a form of friendship we're going to give you the definitions here and i have the definitions up there a friend an amigo a person who you like and enjoy being with a person a person who helps or supports someone or something and that is what the scriptures that we read is someone who helps or supports someone or something someone who encourages you someone who builds you up we should look for friends that are here and are saying beliefs i'm talking about friends and and and the formal friendship stage of course we have friends outside of our of our religion or what we believe in but when you're looking for someone with the intention of marriage or something serious it's affecting only the outer part or the surface of something is that we just have there's no there's nothing serious that we have between each other regular friends amigos it's only the surface there's nothing deep or there's nothing serious in our friendships it's done accordance with rules of convention or etiquette suitable for or constituting an official and important situation so then that's when we come into the form of friendship we're no longer they're just the regular common friends that are outside in the fellowship but now there's an intention behind that there's something that they have between one another that they they like there's something that they like in each other and they want to make it formal that was not now not just the surface amen amen now what do you do in this stage what do we do when we become friends what do we do [Applause] there shouldn't be anything like that to start confessing to one another say i'm going to marry you and god gave me a sign that you're the one that's not that's not the time there have get to know each other each other's characters and keep praying and waiting asking god to review to you about this young man or this young lady a lot of people think well we're formal friends we're dating now there's something that is mutual between you two so when you guys want to be together you can't be together by yourself you have to be amongst the youth groups there is no such thing as dates amen amen do you love the lord i want to go on a date with you there's no date no no there's no dates you're just friends amigos you only get to see each other here in the fellowship i hope on sundays evenings we have a lot of young people espero domingos amen that's where we should see him at yeah not to be organizing themselves to meet at a coffee place or to me at the movies or anywhere else she meet each other over here you can't be touching each other you're allowed to be each other with the youth group but they shouldn't be back there in the back by themselves because you are friends amen the scripture that we read last week it says it is good for a man not to touch a woman to the young ladies excuse me young man ever does that to you you should tell them you better stop there leave me alone that is not christ like es you should tell your parents tell the pastor you're a young man i wanted to kiss you on the left because a young woman has a sacred virtue that she tell the young lady has to confess to her husband i did this and i did that oh i did this keep yourself as clean and unstable don't stain your testimony you don't want to tell your wife keep yourself clean amen amen what we want is that in five or ten years from now in cinco de la preaching now we can see the harvest [Music] don't let that don't let your parents go through that don't let your pastor go through the pastor amen amen you love the lord do you love me amen amen you love the lord eventually you love me and i trust that one day it's very soon we're closing now things that you should do what are the things that you should do because the bible says first seek fir seek ye first the kingdom of god it doesn't say first seek a girlfriend no this is a primer oh look for this it says first seek the kingdom of god the holy ghost will give you the right mind to be able to choose el espiritu amen the holy ghost will give you a right mind you're able to choose the right spouse how do i know i have the holy ghost by wearing a nice suit and a beautiful dress by your fruits and you know who the first ones to know if you have the holy ghost i'm gonna let you think about that you know the first ones to know you have the holy ghost your parents fathers i'm going to say that again your parents not too many amens you know why and he knows if that young man is ready you're going to work until the day you die clean up the backyard the dog has left her droppings all over the backyard throw the trash and do this you're gonna work until the day you die you're just in training right you're in training right now amen amen there's many ministers many elders there's kids they will call the cops because their parents want to spank them wow wow young man young sisters don't do that uh she interested in learning how to cook
