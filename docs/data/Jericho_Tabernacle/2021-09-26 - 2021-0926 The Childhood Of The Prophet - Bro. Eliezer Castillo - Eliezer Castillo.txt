reason and why we're here is to be able to glorify god and to exalt his we also appreciate the vote of confidence of our pastor the parents and the children to be able to start on this project it wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the the great amount of help that we received from several brothers and sisters and young people that have been helping us and of course we're all learning [Music] of our christian nation and practically in the future they will become the pillars of this church i'm very pleased with that because we're starting with them at such a young age as you can see here in the back we have a setup a decoration that we have put up practically basically we'll be talking about the type or the format that we want to uh implement and it's a format that we can change but we'll need your help for that jericho tabernacle children's news uh we want to handle these news and it's jericho tabernacle children's news significance if someone is asking what are the what are

through this oh no children no way did your mom make you go through the trash i'm a son of god the son of the king i shouldn't be doing chores well you know when i was a young boy i used to do chores too i used to feed the cows and then bro bran had plenty of chores to do too ah i like that name brother branham we the brother branham also had to do chores oh yes yes he did he did not like it but he did it anyways yeah brother branham i know that name my parents always play the tapes all day long was he was he a preacher was he also a kid was that preacher a kid yes i was also a kid at one point in time too yeah so you know i'm a very curious little mexican boy and i have a question about brother bannon's life when he was a young boy i wonder what if he liked candy did he like candy yes he did he liked uh what they called red hots and from from a store called shifts and louis louisville indiana oh okay and did he also did brother brother have brothers and sisters like me i have a bunch of brothers did he have brothers and sisters that he did he had i believe 10 brothers and sisters oh that's awesome then did brother branham talk to his brothers and sisters about when when they were older did he talk to the muscle i believe so yes and another question was brother branham tempted when he was a kid yes so but let me introduce you to a brother oh yeah because i got a lot of questions he can answer all the questions for you introduce him i'm getting to that now his name is brother eli costillo brother eli god bless you brother yes god bless you brother god bless you god bless you god bless you so you had uh questions about brother branham yes yes yes i have questions about brother branham i asked that i asked brother tim the questions and i believe you heard some of the questions right yeah yeah i heard them i could answer a few questions um but i want to ask you a question what made brother branham so special i want to really know well it's the same way he we are all special it's because jesus christ loved us and he knew us amen amen and and brother branham he had a great big responsibility he had a big responsibility to bring us the word of god and to show us what the word of god truly was so that was his great responsibility but you're just as special as brother branham and it's not because of your great big responsibility but it's because jesus knew you and he loved you okay amen maybe maybe you have a little responsibility amen maybe your responsibility is to clean your room maybe every day you got to make your bed that's your responsibility maybe you have a gift that the lord has for you maybe a gift to i heard a brother play the drums really really well god bless you brother um i heard you i heard little brothers singing really well and the sisters sing their specials that's that's a gift and god has given a gift to each and every one of you but what really makes you special is because jesus loves you yes do you do you know when brother banham call or when god called brother branham when he was little was it when he was a good boy maybe when he started to think about serving the lord the bible says in jeremiah 1 5 it says i knew you before i formed you in your mama's tummy amen amen so he already knew us before we were in our mama's tummy he knew us before we were even born that's when he knew us and that's when he already loved us amen so now we know that brother branham wasn't called when he was a good boy because i know sometimes we're not all good boys or good girls but god calls us either way no matter what if we're good or bad god calls us and he's the one that begins to deal with us in our lives do you know when brother god showed up to brother branham the first time does anybody know what when that's a good answer that's a good answer but it was actually before he preached there was when brother branham was born that was the first time god showed up to brother branham it was when he was born in a little log cabin in a little log cabin he was born and brother branham says that outside the window in a little bush there a robin started to sing and it was early early in the morning and the robin started to sing and his father charles branham he wanted to open the shutters to the windows so when he opened the window there was a light that came into the room do you guys know that yes there was a light do you know what that light was what was the light man i like you brother it was jesus we have two pictures up here do you know where jesus is at can you guys point where jesus is at oh i like that some people point right here and some people point there you guys are correct jesus is right here and jesus is right there on top of brother branham that light that's the very light that came into the cabin and he went over brother branham so even when he was born god already knew who brother branham was and it's not because of his great big gift what makes him special but because jesus knew him um so god will show up and will be with us when we are good and when we are bad i know for a fact for me sometimes i'm not always good sometimes i'm i'm bad when i was a kid i sometimes i was a bad boy but was where was god when i was a bad boy he was still there there was one time when brother branham he i believe he was two or three years old he had a great big rock and he was throwing this great big rock in a puddle trying to show his brothers how strong he was he was trying to show his little brother and when he was throwing that rock he heard that same bird that you saw up here on a tree he's heard that bird sing sing sing just as loud as you can hear it seeing and when brother branham looked at that bird he saw the bird and the bird flew away and when the bird flew away brother branham that was the first time brother branham heard god's voice and the voice told him that he was going to live in a city close to new albany so that was the first time brother branham heard god heard jesus christ it wasn't when he was praying it wasn't when he was singing in church but he was just plain as a little boy god was there with them and when he was seven years old brother branham was playing marbles who still plays marbles here do you guys know how to play marvels what is it today you guys love to play with legos huh yeah who can raise your hand who loves to play with legos maybe he was playing with legos but back then they were marbles he loved to play with marbles and he was seven years old and when he was playing with marbles with his friends something began to happen he began to have a vision and the vision was a vision of a great big bridge it was called the municipal bridge it's that bridge right there and they were building that great big bridge and he saw 16 men lose their lives in that vision and that was the first time brother branham ever had a vision he was seven years old can somebody raise their hand who's seven years old seven years old seven years old who's 10 years old who's under 10 years old all right so we have a lot of young ones here today that's when brother branham called him when he was just a little boy so you don't have to be a older preacher like me or just like your mom or just like your father but god has already called you now he'll call you whenever you're playing with your legos god is there watching you and he's with you whether you're a good boy or a bad boy god is always watching and that's a good thing to understand so whenever we're about to do something wrong or when we're about to steal or lie we got to remember you know what god is there with me even if i'm crying or if i'm happy i got to remember god is always there with me amen can i hear amen from the young ones amen i like that i like that one more time amen amen he was seven years old and you know he was seven years old whenever his dad told him to help him pack some water for for his still but brother branham he wanted to go fishing he wanted to go fishing he was seven years old and he wanted to go fishing with his friends at the ice pond so he went and he ran to his dad and he said daddy daddy can i go can i go fishing and his dad said nope we have to work today and what did he do was he happy and he said okay no he started crying and started kicking the dirt and sometimes we act that way right sometimes when we don't have our way it makes us feel sad and makes us cry but that's normal but while he was crying and he was there stomping his feet i want you to hear brother branham what happened let's see and i've turned to look and about halfway up that tree was another whirlwind caught in that tree just going around and around moving those leaves well i thought nothing strange about that because it just in that time of year and the autumn why those whirlwinds come little we call them whirlwinds and they uh and they pick up dust you see them on the desert like that same thing so i watched but it didn't leave off usually just to puff for a moment and it goes but it had already been in there two minutes or more well i started up the lane again and i turned to look at this again and when it did a human voice just as audible as mine is said don't you never drink smoke or defile your body in any way there will be a work for you to do when you get older what like to scared me to death would have scared you if you would have heard a man in a tree yeah that was scary but it was god watching over brother branham just like he watches over us even when we're crying even when we don't want to listen to our parents god is there and maybe he's in the tree or maybe he's there around the corner and he's watching and he wants wants to see what we're doing but god told him never to drink never to smoke or defile his body in any way why why did he tell him to to do that why brother the one playing the drums i like that you shouldn't do those things when you're a christian yeah because he had a work for him when he was older so god he has a purpose and a work for each and every one of you so god wants us to live the best kind of life for him he wants us to live 100 percent for him because he has a work and he has a purpose for us do you believe that he wants you to be the best boy and the best girl in school he wants you to do the best for your parents because he has something awesome for you guys and and and so he tells them not to drink smoke or defile his body so brother branham no matter what god was always with him you know there was one time brother branham he tried to smoke he finally picked up a cigarette and he tried to smoke guess what he heard whenever he began to smoke go ahead brother and he remembered when that whirlwind came he heard the voice never to smoke so that whirlwind caused him to remember never to smoke and whenever he tried to pick up a a bottle to drink guess what he heard he began to hear a whirlwind and he remembered never to drink never to defile his body because god was there and he was protecting him that because jesus loves us that's why you're special because jesus loves you and jesus wants you to live the best kind of life for him and be the best son or daughter for your your parents so that you can have an awesome work to do whether it's a great big work like brother branham or it's a little tiny work god is going to protect his gift amen amen amen can you guys say amen amen amen finally brother branham he wanted to give his heart to the lord but he didn't know where to go he said i don't know where to find god well god was in the tree god was in the cabin god was there when he was about to smoke but he couldn't find him so the best thing he could do was write god a letter and he wrote him a letter and he put it on a tree and the next day he said well maybe god isn't over there i've never seen god walk over there in the woods so he looked back and he said you know what i'm going to try to do i'm going to try to pray prayer is a very great thing and it's very powerful that's where you can talk to with god you can talk with him when you're going to school when you're having a hard time you could talk to him and you know if you have faith god will answer your prayers so brother branham he got on his knees and he folded his hands like that and he said maybe this is how i'm supposed to do it and he began to pray to god as best as he could he didn't know how it was his first time and no answer he said well maybe i'm doing it wrong maybe i'm supposed to go like this and pray he began to pray to god and no answer and he began to get very very desperate and he began to cry and he said lord i need you i need you in my life and guess what he saw whenever he opened his eyes he saw that same light jesus christ that was with them all the way when he was born jesus christ was there that same light was there with him and he answered his prayers and when he began to cry out and pray more and then he began to feel different you know why because that whirlwind or that light wasn't in the tree no more it wasn't in the cabin anymore it wasn't on the bush at the cabin anymore but that light was in him now jesus christ can be in you and he can guide you wherever you go whatever you do god can be with you not just in a tree not just around the corner but god can be in you and wherever you are you pack jesus christ with you and you're never alone even though you're sad you got to remember jesus christ is with me and you know what he began to jump and he began to shout that same fire that same thing that guided him all the way to the beginning is with him now and can be with you all you have to do is accept jesus christ and allow him to be in your life every day every day talk to him every day if you can read your bible every day just have a good communion with christ and whenever jesus christ was in him he began to jump he began to shout he went and he told his mama and his mama said oh you you're crazy because he was so excited he was so happy because he had jesus christ in his life he went to the railroad and he would jump up in the railroad feeling like he was going to fly because jesus christ was not only in a tree but he was in him amen amen let us stand to our feet we're going to pray if you guys would like to bow your heads heavenly father lord we just want you to bless these children lord we want to thank you for all your goodness and all your grace in knowing that you are with us everywhere we go father whether we have to go to school whether we're happy or
