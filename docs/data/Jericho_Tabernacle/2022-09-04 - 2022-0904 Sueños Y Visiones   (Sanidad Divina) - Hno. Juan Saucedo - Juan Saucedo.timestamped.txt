[59:00] morning
[59:18] i pray that you give a special portion
[59:20] to them this morning
[59:26] lord if there's someone that needs you

[59:57] so lord allow us to run as the door
[59:59] remains open
[1:00:03] as our brothers on friday told us
[1:00:07] so therefore please help us this morning
[1:00:11] help our pastor lord william
[1:00:24] and to those that are here this morning
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:51] we ask for all these things in the name
[1:00:52] of our lord jesus christ amen amen
[1:01:05] i want to go to the next scripture which
[1:01:07] is the fulfillment of the scripture of
[1:01:09] what we did
[1:01:13] and as well we appreciate the musicians
[1:01:15] for the beautiful music
[1:01:18] everyone that plays an instrument
[1:01:22] may god bless you it's something very
[1:01:23] impressive
[1:01:26] i'm the person that's really uh deeply
[1:01:29] moved by music
[1:01:31] and the singing
[1:01:35] whenever you're singing i really play
[1:01:42] and many times god inspires me to preach
[1:01:44] a message due to the song that you're
[1:01:46] saying
[1:01:48] when you give a testimony
[1:01:56] many times god inspires me with the
[1:01:57] message over that testimony that you
[1:01:59] gave
[1:02:01] opportunity
[1:02:02] so whenever god gives you the chance to
[1:02:04] be able to come
[1:02:16] this is what it means to be yielded to
[1:02:18] him this morning
[1:02:20] if someone steals something from us
[1:02:24] and mexico city happens a lot of times
[1:02:28] you just raise your hands up
[1:02:32] especially if they have an ice pick
[1:02:36] and you can see them
[1:02:38] or a knife
[1:02:40] or some kind of gun
[1:02:43] you just want to lift your hands all the
[1:02:45] way high
[1:02:46] doses
[1:02:56] when we raise our hand it's because
[1:02:57] we're surrendering to number like gloria
[1:02:59] man glory to his name
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:40] i would say put it in your mind
[1:03:55] throughout the entire week i had a real
[1:03:57] struggle gracias hermano luis thank you
[1:04:00] brother luis
[1:04:03] we love brother luis
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:08] but the entire week i've been struggling
[1:04:26] we just can't simply take something and
[1:04:27] say well i'm just going to talk about
[1:04:29] this and that's it
[1:04:36] and just take out some old notes well i
[1:04:38] preached this a year ago i preach it
[1:04:40] then i'll preach it now
[1:04:42] you're the best
[1:04:45] therefore you deserve the best yes
[1:04:48] and that's why we come back
[1:04:51] that's why we come to every service
[1:05:04] our clothes won't fit anymore
[1:05:37] how much more the spiritual food for our
[1:05:39] souls
[1:05:41] that's why we come to the services
[1:05:45] i believe this morning that's why we
[1:05:46] came
[1:05:48] here
[1:06:02] and i want to give a little testimony of
[1:06:03] what i learned on friday
[1:06:05] the brother spoke no
[1:06:08] they said what they said to us
[1:06:12] go listen to it if you haven't already
[1:06:15] adios
[1:06:19] and i asked god for something and he
[1:06:21] gave it to me on friday
[1:06:23] for four days
[1:06:26] the truck that i used to go to work
[1:06:30] my
[1:06:38] i started to feel that once i reached
[1:06:40] the 40 mile per hour mark it began to
[1:06:42] pull back
[1:06:44] in the last two days
[1:06:46] on thursday
[1:06:48] i would put it in reverse you know
[1:06:51] and it wouldn't go
[1:06:53] it wouldn't go
[1:06:56] i stepped on the gas
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:11] and i was shifting gears
[1:07:26] the same thing happen again
[1:07:29] i asked god again lord take me down
[1:07:35] that's the little truck that i used to
[1:07:36] go to work to get my everyday bed right
[1:07:41] but then on friday when i was sitting
[1:07:43] down listening to these two young men
[1:07:46] may god bless these two young men
[1:07:50] when i saw them both here
[1:08:05] so i reminisced years and years and
[1:08:07] years ago
[1:08:11] what those young men said was something
[1:08:13] very tremendous for us
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:20] when they said if there's someone that
[1:08:22] needs anything
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:35] it's what gives me the money to be able
[1:08:37] to live
[1:08:40] it gives me the money so i i can help
[1:08:41] the church
[1:08:46] and it gives me money so that every so
[1:08:47] often i can help a brother
[1:09:04] on saturday it ran completely fine
[1:09:06] without any failure
[1:09:10] how can i not be happy this morning
[1:09:14] i won't i be happy this morning
[1:09:20] the truck that i use for my job it got
[1:09:22] fixed and now it's fine
[1:09:26] and saturday i took my wife out to eat
[1:09:28] and we went in that truck
[1:09:30] but we're human
[1:09:42] let me come to you by walking on the
[1:09:44] water
[1:09:48] and jesus's spoken word was to come here
[1:09:51] is that true come on
[1:09:53] he said
[1:09:57] and peter got off the ship without
[1:10:28] the truck a test drive we must
[1:10:30] so we went to where we went we almost
[1:10:32] lost uh walmart we went to walmart
[1:10:35] we went to one of the places
[1:10:38] we came back and then everything was
[1:10:39] fine
[1:10:40] hermanos brothers
[1:10:42] when
[1:10:56] don't
[1:11:06] here we have the fulfillment of the
[1:11:07] initial scripture
[1:11:18] but peter standing up with the eleven
[1:11:20] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[1:11:29] ye men of judea and all ye that dwell at
[1:11:31] jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:11:33] hearken to my words
[1:11:37] for these are not drunken as
[1:11:52] foreign
[1:12:06] there were so
[1:12:13] but now here we're reading the
[1:12:14] fulfillment of that prophecy
[1:12:19] proving to us that jehovah is the same
[1:12:46] i will pour out my spirit upon allah
[1:12:58] they acted in such a way that confused
[1:13:00] the other people to think that they were
[1:13:01] drunk
[1:13:14] but this is the fulfillment of the
[1:13:15] prophecy this is
[1:13:40] and it says and your sons shall what
[1:13:43] your young men shall see visions
[1:13:58] and your old men shall dream dreams
[1:14:01] glorious glory to his name
[1:14:06] dreams and visions
[1:14:10] now i just want to say a few of them
[1:14:12] testimonial maybe just like a testimony
[1:14:17] i mean god use it in whatever way he
[1:14:19] wants to use it
[1:14:20] like gloria glory to his name
[1:14:25] a dream is when you're sleeping
[1:14:31] a dream is when you're sleeping
[1:14:34] now a vision
[1:14:38] is when you're awake
[1:14:40] again
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:56] and a vision is when you're awake
[1:15:00] now one time paul was awake
[1:15:05] what was he doing we don't know
[1:15:08] but he was in a
[1:15:13] but then all of a sudden he sees a man
[1:15:15] from macedonia lomira he sees him
[1:15:20] as if i was seeing my brother
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:16:03] there was no doubt that god was giving
[1:16:05] him the victory
[1:16:10] when god sends you then god is helpless
[1:16:14] when god sends you god god goes with you
[1:16:18] don't get worried
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:31] then he will grant you the victory
[1:16:33] gloria glory to his name
[1:16:36] then immediately
[1:16:40] that a vision is when you're awake
[1:16:43] and i don't know
[1:16:46] how many of us that are here there's
[1:16:48] plenty of us here i'm
[1:16:50] sueno have had a dream
[1:16:53] or have seen a vision
[1:16:55] now there's no doubt
[1:16:59] has seen that yesterday
[1:17:14] now there are dreams that come from god
[1:17:18] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:17:22] there are dreams that come from god
[1:17:28] but there are dreams that are just
[1:17:29] simply dreams
[1:17:34] sometimes i think i'm the sheriff from
[1:17:35] the west
[1:17:40] but in fact i'm just running
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] because the cops are after me
[1:17:47] but those are two different kinds of
[1:17:48] dreams
[1:17:51] but they're just simply dreams
[1:17:54] i don't know how many dreams
[1:18:08] but brothers i'm dreaming
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:16] a while ago i mentioned that at one
[1:18:18] point in life i wanted to make easy
[1:18:19] money
[1:18:22] i put some gloves on i wanted to become
[1:18:24] a boxer
[1:18:26] it was easy money
[1:18:28] easy
[1:18:29] questions
[1:18:31] because the american dream
[1:18:33] do you think it's easy
[1:19:01] i knew that that was not my future
[1:19:04] but every so often you did
[1:19:11] i think one day even my wife had to say
[1:19:13] hey hold up just take it easy
[1:19:16] it's because i was in a dream that i was
[1:19:18] boxing
[1:20:30] that when we left that sister that was
[1:20:32] about to give birth
[1:20:34] i dreamt that she gave birth
[1:20:40] and now she was breastfeeding
[1:20:42] she was breastfeeding a little baby boy
[1:20:52] we reached the city limits of denver
[1:20:57] i told my wife
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:39] and i asked her and i said sister how's
[1:21:41] everything
[1:21:43] we're now back we're here now
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:50] how's it going with your little baby boy
[1:21:54] and brother
[1:22:08] tell you
[1:22:12] so i dreamt that it was a boy
[1:22:19] why do i know that it's a dream from god
[1:22:22] because
[1:23:06] and this is the part that i'm happy
[1:23:08] about it says and your old man shall
[1:23:09] dream dreams
[1:23:12] and your old man
[1:23:14] shall dream dreams
[1:23:35] and there are some dreams that you have
[1:23:36] to be careful with yes
[1:23:39] and it's this one that i'm about to say
[1:23:41] a month ago
[1:23:44] i dreamt of a sister from new mexico
[1:23:59] i dreamt that a sister from new mexico
[1:24:01] passed away
[1:24:04] i saw and i saw her funeral
[1:24:06] and i saw her name
[1:24:08] as well
[1:24:11] i had it a month ago
[1:24:15] and i have not called the sister
[1:24:18] neither have i called her children
[1:24:22] it's the first time i'm ever speaking
[1:24:25] i haven't even told my wife
[1:24:37] whenever you have a dream like that
[1:24:39] just wait
[1:24:42] don't
[1:24:54] don't go immediately to my house
[1:25:00] don't come and say brother i had a dream
[1:25:02] of you i saw you that you were in a
[1:25:03] drawer
[1:25:05] i dreamt that they died
[1:25:09] if oh in a casket rather if i haven't uh
[1:25:12] died then maybe i will
[1:25:17] by receiving those news that you give me
[1:25:22] can hormones
[1:25:24] and
[1:25:37] i have not called this family esperando
[1:25:40] esperando esperando i'm just waiting and
[1:25:43] waiting and waiting
[1:25:45] because if it would have come to pass
[1:25:51] would have already invited us to the
[1:25:52] funeral repetitive i'll say it again
[1:25:56] i know the sister
[1:25:59] i know who she is
[1:26:02] but i have not called her
[1:26:07] and if you hear that i'm preaching here

[1:26:10] my brother's in new mexico
[1:26:12] and they're listening
[1:26:18] remember i didn't say a name nor
[1:26:27] so are we going to be careful with the
[1:26:28] dreams
[1:26:29] amen amen
[1:26:32] now there are dreams
[1:26:47] let's go to genesis
[1:26:53] chapter 20. the genesis of the book of
[1:26:56] genesis
[1:27:00] we'll begin with verse three capitulo de
[1:27:26] and abraham journeyed from dance toward
[1:27:28] the south country and dwelled between
[1:27:30] kadish and sure and sojourn in gerar
[1:27:39] and abraham said of sarah his wife she
[1:27:41] is my sister
[1:27:43] did abraham say that
[1:27:57] a promise was given to them
[1:28:02] sarah would have a son isn't that right
[1:28:07] but in the humanity of sarah what did he
[1:28:09] do he doubted it
[1:28:12] sometimes we doubt
[1:28:14] my best is
[1:28:15] there's sometimes
[1:28:17] not always
[1:28:20] sometimes doubt does creep in there
[1:28:23] and it's something natural because we're
[1:28:24] humans brothers
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:29:21] whatever god does with us we must
[1:29:22] testify of it
[1:29:24] glory to his name
[1:29:28] the people have to know that we serve a
[1:29:30] real god
[1:29:31] a living god
[1:29:35] a god that answers what you're asking
[1:29:44] so blessed be the name of the lord
[1:30:03] he said she's my sister
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:17] what do you think about that
[1:30:21] abraham said she's my sister
[1:30:23] he said uh she said he's my brother
[1:30:26] they agreed on that
[1:30:32] because abraham said look they're going
[1:30:34] to kill me because of this because
[1:30:35] you're beautiful
[1:30:39] whatever god does he does it beautifully
[1:30:45] you don't have to spend 100 on whatever
[1:30:46] that thing is called max factor whatever
[1:30:48] it is
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:50] god made you beautiful sister
[1:30:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:30:59] before coming to church how many of you
[1:31:00] looked in the mirror i did it
[1:31:06] just how as you are
[1:31:09] you stand up and look
[1:31:13] and you can say oh man i didn't know i
[1:31:14] was so gorgeous
[1:31:18] sometimes you even want a fame
[1:31:22] man you say man i didn't know i was so
[1:31:24] drop dead gorgeous
[1:31:26] it's just the mirror brothers
[1:31:41] i'm waiting for someone to tell me that
[1:31:44] it doesn't happen right
[1:31:47] glory to the name of the lord
[1:31:49] blessed be the lord
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:54] god had rejuvenated abraham and sarah
[1:32:10] they
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:21] now listen to this we're in the subject
[1:32:23] of dreams and visions
[1:32:38] god many times speaks to us through
[1:32:40] dreams
[1:32:41] do you believe it i believe in it
[1:32:43] i believe it that's the number gloria
[1:32:45] glory to his name
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] god came to abimelech in a dream by
[1:32:52] night
[1:33:12] but god came to a boom like in a dream
[1:33:13] binding
[1:33:22] and said to him behold thou art but a
[1:33:24] dead man for the man which thou has
[1:33:26] taken for she is a man's wife
[1:33:30] glory to the name of the lord
[1:33:33] when someone is sincere
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:37] when someone does things correctly
[1:33:41] but god is careful with that
[1:33:46] and we see that god here took care of
[1:33:47] this
[1:34:03] we knew that the king did it because
[1:34:04] they said she's my uh brother and she's
[1:34:07] my sister
[1:34:08] isn't that right
[1:34:10] this is
[1:34:18] but in verse 4 but abimelech had not
[1:34:20] come near her and he said lord will thou
[1:34:22] also slay a righteous nation
[1:34:27] he didn't get closer he didn't touch her
[1:34:29] at all
[1:34:40] and she even she herself said he is my
[1:34:43] brother
[1:34:49] and he says in the integrity of my heart
[1:34:51] and innocency of my hands i have done
[1:34:53] this
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:56] and god said unto him in a dream
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:01] it wasn't a prophet saying this to him
[1:35:04] god is telling him the lord
[1:35:08] but through a dream
[1:35:12] that's why i'm saying that there are
[1:35:13] dreams that come from god
[1:35:16] and there are other dreams that are not
[1:35:17] from god
[1:35:20] there are other dreams that are just
[1:35:21] simply dreams
[1:35:26] yeah i know the dao did this in the
[1:35:28] integrity of die hard
[1:35:33] with healthy from sinning against me
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:38] therefore suffered i thee not to touch
[1:35:40] her i want
[1:35:51] for he is a prophet
[1:35:54] everybody
[1:36:07] that many things that are done
[1:36:19] it's a good thing that they won't be
[1:36:20] taken into account
[1:36:22] because god knows your heart that's the
[1:36:24] number like gloria glory to his name
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:28] he knew that the intention was never
[1:36:30] there
[1:36:33] god will help you to be able to overcome
[1:36:35] in triumph
[1:36:36] glory
[1:37:02] so it's good that there are mistakes
[1:37:03] that won't be taken into account
[1:37:06] it was a mistake that abraham made wrong
[1:37:09] it was a mistake that abraham is
[1:37:11] ceremonial
[1:37:12] they did it with the purpose
[1:37:15] to be able to preserve their life
[1:37:19] because they were going through a
[1:37:20] specific city that was dangerous
[1:37:29] because that through a dream god fixed
[1:37:32] that problem
[1:37:45] another one
[1:37:57] our brothers have spoken on this
[1:37:59] album it's not
[1:38:12] because we're talking about dreams and
[1:38:14] visions
[1:38:28] he made a statement and he said
[1:38:32] he said the spoken word
[1:38:34] is here
[1:38:37] we have to believe it
[1:38:41] on friday i took it for the tennis
[1:38:45] and now my truck is fine
[1:38:49] now my truck can get worse
[1:38:52] like sometimes we get sick
[1:38:58] we come here so they can pray for us
[1:38:59] because we have a headache
[1:39:03] and then on monday tuesday there's
[1:39:04] nothing there
[1:39:06] the lord healed us
[1:39:09] now notice the difference
[1:39:21] healing is something that happens
[1:39:23] gradually
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:38] you were
[1:39:51] even though you leave through the
[1:40:06] that's what happened with that black man
[1:40:08] that was blind
[1:40:11] he went with the barber to get his
[1:40:12] haircut
[1:40:14] brothers that are barbers
[1:40:18] i'm starting to notice that we have a
[1:40:20] lot of barbers here and i didn't know
[1:40:21] that before
[1:40:23] but i've invited some to go out to eat
[1:40:27] on saturday because i don't work
[1:40:28] saturdays
[1:40:30] and they said brothers i can't
[1:40:32] i'm a barber
[1:40:44] but the brothers that are barbers
[1:40:45] they'll understand
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:41:02] and that man was giving the testimony of
[1:41:03] the meeting to his barber
[1:41:08] and the barber without her that was
[1:41:10] looking at this man
[1:41:14] but he was still believing
[1:41:41] healing sometimes can take weeks
[1:41:55] a miracle can happen
[1:41:58] immediately miracle can happen to you
[1:42:01] right now
[1:42:04] if you have a great excruciating pain in
[1:42:06] your legs
[1:42:07] or excruciating pain in your back
[1:42:10] excruciating pain in your head
[1:42:26] and
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:54] back
[1:42:57] identifier
[1:43:06] he's white he looks like an american
[1:43:23] i couldn't go back but just to reminisce
[1:43:25] about years in the past
[1:43:32] and then they knock at our door
[1:43:36] a young man of 13 14 years of age
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:40] i knew the city where i was at pretty
[1:43:42] well
[1:43:44] and then they came to ask
[1:43:48] her if certain brothers lived at this
[1:43:50] place
[1:43:55] just like when there were people that
[1:43:56] came to peter's house
[1:44:00] when cornelius sent messengers to
[1:44:02] peter's house asking does peter live
[1:44:03] here
[1:44:17] and the reply was yes they
[1:44:30] and they told us that you pray for the
[1:44:32] sick
[1:44:40] and they're asking if you can come to
[1:44:42] our house to pray for our sister
[1:44:45] after we heard that
[1:44:55] we narrated to a young american boy
[1:44:57] whose name was tim
[1:45:01] he was around the same
[1:45:03] height as ben chavis
[1:45:06] he was just as skinny as him
[1:45:09] maybe a bit taller
[1:45:14] and timothy he came from the city of
[1:45:16] louisiana
[1:45:19] and he came to preach to us
[1:45:24] a young man dedicated to god
[1:45:28] this is something that happened about 40
[1:45:29] years ago
[1:45:33] i was still back then in the
[1:45:35] organization
[1:45:40] i was barely giving my first steps in
[1:45:41] the organization
[1:45:57] and when it came that we had to go to
[1:45:59] this address
[1:46:02] and they asked me if i knew where it was
[1:46:03] and i said i did
[1:46:06] and i said um
[1:46:07] i know where it's at
[1:46:09] well
[1:46:17] but i do remember timothy he was the one
[1:46:19] that was going to pray for the spirit
[1:46:21] the young man that came from louisiana
[1:46:24] a young preacher
[1:46:38] i was 13 14 years back then yeah
[1:46:41] and now we were on our way
[1:46:43] when we got to the house
[1:46:46] we knocked on the door
[1:46:48] they opened the door for us
[1:46:51] as soon as they opened the door for us
[1:46:57] the horrible the horrible shrieks or
[1:46:59] yelling that you've ever heard what is
[1:47:01] the most horrible yelling you've ever
[1:47:02] heard
[1:47:03] from the from the yoronas
[1:47:32] i don't know what other kind of horrible
[1:47:33] yelling you've ever heard in your life
[1:47:39] but back then at that short age of 14
[1:47:41] that was the most horrible yelling i've

[1:47:47] we were going to germany
