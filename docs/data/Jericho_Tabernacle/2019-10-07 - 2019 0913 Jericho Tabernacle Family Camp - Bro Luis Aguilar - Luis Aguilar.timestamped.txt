[6:15] Madison now the theme or the subject is
[6:21] once in unbelief I'm gonna believe that
[6:27] there's not to sins
[6:28] no I don't speak about three sins my
[6:30] praise be there's only one sin now if I
[6:36] could place just a title if it be
[6:39] appropriate I like to grab brother
[6:43] Graham's message he preaches God's Word
[6:48] calls for a total separation of unbelief
[6:53] Paris I'm totally incredibly not that he
[6:55] calls for yama a total Runa complete
[7:01] separation tile of unbelief now in order
[7:06] for us to separate from something we
[7:09] first have to understand what we're
[7:11] separating ourselves from chaos is
[7:14] Thomas Esperanto
[7:15] if there's one sin we have to understand
[7:18] what that one sin is and if it is
[7:22] unbelief we must understand unbelief and
[7:25] what the van was venting are you with me
[7:29] am I seeing a man a man now what is shin
[7:33] what is unbelief but the branch says
[7:37] 1957 the book of Hebrews chapter seven

[11:12] his words we we do those things because
[11:17] we disbelieve his word okay no cables
[11:19] below and if we believe God's Word we
[11:22] wouldn't be doing it to begin with
[11:24] yeah this is years of millennium who
[11:26] will say what I believe the word naki
[11:28] says the egg yolk Crayola but I'd like
[11:29] to do this and I like to smoke and I
[11:33] like to steal but I believe there's a
[11:36] guy we believe 99% of the world but
[11:41] nobody take 1% out that's what he said
[11:44] in revelation 22 in a book RBC's maybe
[11:48] those who so ever but I can say
[11:50] whosoever can say doesn't matter who it
[11:52] is she can say if you take one word Zito

[12:00] one word - is he like it does your your
[12:03] name no shall we take away sake can you
[12:08] say amen to that
[12:09] mother Branson is very hard this is
[12:12] maneuver is passed on to be easy for a
[12:13] man but I came home buddy to believe
[12:15] another man is it's very difficult but
[12:19] Jesus who it's not just any other man no
[12:23] sentimental drama Jesus because the Word
[12:25] made flesh
[12:28] you know he was bad in he was he was he
[12:30] was God becoming man it has the old
[12:32] comedian who say a gnome but any man
[12:34] does if it says if you don't believe me
[12:35] and this is the economy create this and
[12:37] me believe the words that I do because
[12:40] there's actions a lot of a lot of a lot
[12:44] of times we speak a blonde there's no
[12:47] action
[12:47] I'm gonna promise I'm gonna do this yo
[12:50] we never do it but Jesus gave us a bunch
[12:54] of promise in my lose your mood just
[12:56] promise he's didn't just speak it
[12:58] no solamente love law but he acted upon
[13:00] it man that's why the disciples told
[13:02] told Jesus and lo que los the simple
[13:04] rather they asked them we listen to a
[13:09] tooth fairy she says couch amor que
[13:11] dicen us body sales should we listen to
[13:12] them the vamos muchachos this is sure
[13:15] this is listen to what they say it's
[13:17] couch I look at me and do what they say
[13:19] yeah I said okay but don't do what they
[13:21] do because they say what can peace and
[13:25] they don't do must know us you say amen
[13:28] to that
[13:28] that's why it's hard for a man you know
[13:32] to believe another man lately our hombre
[13:34] that's why in the beginning what is CP
[13:37] one word una para was disbelief no for
[13:40] creator and that brought forth death yes
[13:42] oh you so they kill important being that
[13:44] Brad for sorrow is so truffula three
[13:46] states that Brad for sickness is a
[13:48] struggle for me that that rock fourth
[13:50] time is tiempo
[13:52] but we want to fix the Scriptures to our
[13:54] benefit we want to cherry-pick
[14:00] but in March 16 16 miles and Marcos did
[14:04] he say he said who he that believeth
[14:06] shall be says he that believeth not
[14:10] shall be there you say amen to that
[14:14] now that is unbelief
[14:17] in God's Word not in my word in his word
[14:22] now brother Graham tells us that we want
[14:26] to see God's miracles we want to see his
[14:29] power do you want to see his power do
[14:33] you see do you want to see this
[14:34] manifestation get embarrassed the money
[14:36] fist asean do you want to see it but why
[14:39] don't we see it passport came out of him
[14:42] why don't we see it because of our
[14:45] unbelief one thousand was thinking every
[14:47] night in Matthew 13 and that's what
[14:51] Jesus was rejected in Nazareth he should
[14:55] have prospered it's now received in his
[14:56] own country same prophet that voice in
[15:01] verse 58 Matthew tells us my fairness he
[15:05] said that he did not perform perform
[15:08] mighty miracles you know overall because
[15:12] of their unbelief a cow sabisu
