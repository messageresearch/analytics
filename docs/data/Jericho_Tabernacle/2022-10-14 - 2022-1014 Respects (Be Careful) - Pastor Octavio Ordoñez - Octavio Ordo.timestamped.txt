[36:03] when you go to Mexico
[36:07] you don't realize what you have until
[36:09] you go
[36:14] they send their greetings
[36:18] we were able to see the brother from San
[36:21] Luis uh
[36:23] and he wanted us to greet you

[36:33] that's one thing I heard over and over

[38:21] evening
[38:25] we'd like to go over a few important
[38:27] subjects
[38:30] I'm sure they mentioned them just now
[38:35] and it should be a very informative
[38:38] meaning
[38:41] I think everyone that participates in

[38:51] including all our elders ministers
[39:00] we also have uh my sister-in-law here
[39:06] my wife's sister Esposa

[39:28] [Applause]
[39:35] when we go over there

[44:02] Everlasting Covenant
[44:09] saying unto thee will I give the land of
[44:13] Canaan the lot of your inheritance
[44:22] when they were but a few men in number
[44:25] yeah very few and strangers in it
[44:34] when they went from one nation to
[44:37] another from one Kingdom to another
[44:40] Pueblo
[44:44] and he suffered no man to do them wrong
[44:52] yeah he reproved Kings for their sake
[45:11] church not

[45:18] yes sir
[45:32] and do my prophets no harm
[45:34] not okay
[45:41] amen you may be seated
[45:57] here's a message that brother Brian
[45:59] spoke about is
[46:03] called respects yes
[46:07] the subtitle is be careful
[46:11] so I'm just going to read from Brother
[46:13] Branham um
[46:16] and uh it would be nice if you could go
[46:19] home and read or hear the message
[46:26] I don't want to take too much time
[46:30] but I want to bring a point
[46:35] I like for everyone to everyone to check
[46:39] up in their hearts
[46:43] and find out
[46:48] yes
[46:50] how you stand before God
[47:00] having a hard time
[47:04] you guys uh pray for me okay
[47:08] all right we'll go home early
[47:14] okay I'm just gonna re try and keep calm
[47:19] um
[47:22] uh
[47:24] I think the brothers have the message
[47:26] I'm going to start with line 45 or
[47:29] paragraph 45.
[47:35] I want to take a subject from there
[47:39] of respects
[47:49] really near David crying out to the Lord
[47:57] respects is what we owe to God El
[48:01] respect is
[48:04] and that's one thing that I would like
[48:08] yes
[48:09] to drill this to the heart of every
[48:13] person here tonight that in all things
[48:16] that we see going on we must give
[48:21] respects to it
[48:23] is
[48:37] when they were very few men in Israel
[48:42] perhaps Abraham Isaac and Jacob Who had
[48:45] who he was speaking of very few men and
[48:50] that he
[48:53] rebuke Nations and kingdoms for them
[48:59] is
[49:10] God rebuked the Nations and Kings saying
[49:14] touch now my anointed and do my prophets
[49:16] no harm
[49:21] is prophetas
[49:25] over an eggless this
[49:28] eclassistus Ecclesiastes the 12th
[49:31] chapter
[49:34] 13 verses
[49:37] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[49:40] matter
[49:41] fear God and keep his Commandments
[49:46] for this is the full duty of the hand
[49:50] is
[49:59] the conclusion of the whole manner is to
[50:03] fear God
[50:09] and when you cannot have respects until
[50:13] you have fear equal
[50:18] you've got to have fear of God
[50:24] also in the Proverbs that Proverbs 9 10.
[50:33] the fear of God is the beginning of
[50:36] wisdom
[50:39] the fear of God
[50:54] now that don't mean that you're afraid
[50:56] of him
[50:59] but that means that you are giving him
[51:02] respects and reverence
[51:12] and when you respect God you fear God
[51:19] you fear that you might displease him in
[51:24] some way you Fearless you would do
[51:26] something wrong you won't want to
[51:30] um
[51:42] says I fear my mother I fear my wife I
[51:46] fear my church I fear all of God's
[51:50] servants
[51:51] but it's all
[51:52] unless I should put a stumbling block
[51:56] somewhere in their way this is
[52:12] I fear the people
[52:16] I feel the people of the city unless I
[52:20] should do something wrong that would
[52:22] cause them to think that I wasn't a
[52:25] Christian it is
[52:33] see you've got before you can have
[52:37] respects you've got to have fear
[52:45] and God demands
[52:49] God demands it
[53:02] he demands respects
[53:08] he demands
[53:11] and fear brings it
[53:14] and we know that fear brings respect is
[53:21] now you talk for instance the man he's a
[53:24] farmer or maybe he's a shop worker and
[53:28] nobody pays attention to him
[53:34] [Music]
[53:37] but let him get the job and the
[53:40] policemen
[53:44] and come down the street
[53:48] and a policeman with this badge and
[53:51] uniform on police
[53:56] well maybe someone wouldn't speak of him
[54:00] the day before
[54:05] hello there's John how are you see why
[54:10] is it
[54:14] it's kind of an awe or a fear or a
[54:17] respect because of it is
[54:29] of the city or maybe uh
[54:34] who would President Kenny Kennedy
[54:37] tonight be if he wasn't a President
[54:39] Kennedy Kansas
[54:44] but it was just the man he is but yet he
[54:49] was a worker at the that worked at a
[54:54] Colgate down here for forty dollars a
[54:57] week
[55:07] see he wouldn't come through the city
[55:09] here and nobody would pay much attention
[55:12] to him only his own Associates
[55:22] but being he's the president of the
[55:24] United States he deserves a respect
[55:27] president
[55:34] and uh and because that God is God he
[55:39] deserves respect
[55:45] that's right and and he we've got to
[55:49] respect him
[55:54] and give appear to him
[55:57] and that brings respect yes
[56:02] God has demanded that for himself and
[56:06] for all his servants
[56:13] I want to make sure you heard that
[56:18] God has demanded that for himself and
[56:23] for all his servants
[56:28] God demands respect for his servants
[56:34] he his servants
[56:37] how we know that they are his servants
[56:40] because he vindicates these sermons by
[56:44] his word
[56:53] he takes these servants and makes them
[56:57] Servants of God
[57:02] and proves that they are servants
[57:07] by making his word word through them
[57:10] sermons
[57:13] then as you respect that servant you
[57:17] respect God
[57:22] so when I respect you and you respect me
[57:27] we respect each other then we're
[57:30] respecting God is
[57:45] you respect me
[57:48] we respect each other
[57:52] then we're respecting God
[57:58] I was good
[58:05] did not Jesus say in so much as you have
[58:08] done unto the least of these my little
[58:11] ones you have done it unto me Matthew 25
[58:14] 10 25 40.
[58:26] and it would be better
[58:29] for you that a millstone was hanged at
[58:34] your neck
[58:40] and you were drowned in the deeps of the
[58:43] sea Italian
[58:47] one of my little ones
[58:56] who are I say unto you
[58:58] behold their face their Angels always
[59:03] behind my father's face which is in
[59:06] heaven
[59:09] is
[59:13] Matthew 18 10.
[59:16] now we know that
[59:19] now we know that they are that we being
[59:23] children of God
[59:25] we are a part of God and God demands
[59:29] this respect
[59:32] is
[59:38] and then God shows who's his children
[59:41] are
[59:43] and shows by the Wonders and signs and
[59:47] that it's being done
[59:54] if they won't take God's prep
[59:58] aration of Escape
[1:00:01] then there's only one thing left
[1:00:05] last Divine judgment see there's no
[1:00:08] receiving La preparations
[1:00:17] pretty interesting message
[1:00:35] so what happened to him
[1:00:41] made fun of a servant of God
[1:00:45] they received Divine judgments Moses
[1:00:54] Moses tried to help the people when he
[1:00:56] was 40 years old
[1:01:01] they rejected him
[1:01:03] they disrespected him
[1:01:09] God sent them back
[1:01:13] he turned to my room
[1:01:23] but they disrespected him
[1:01:28] after all the things he did in Egypt
[1:01:34] at the sea at the Red Sea this place
[1:01:42] then we're asking for food
[1:01:49] then they're asking for water
[1:01:54] but that's not the worst of it
[1:02:02] his own brother
[1:02:05] his own sister hermana
[1:02:09] made fun of them
[1:02:16] his own brother
[1:02:18] his own sister
[1:02:28] they disrespected his wife
[1:02:34] and they had to plea
[1:02:37] to Moses
[1:02:40] and Moses had to go
[1:02:43] and pray for
[1:02:45] for deliverance
[1:03:07] line 71
[1:03:11] but I want to bring another thing
[1:03:21] and Vindicated by science
[1:03:27] that he was a messenger sent from God
[1:03:32] then it's up to you
[1:03:35] then it's up to them to obey this
[1:03:38] messenger
[1:03:40] uh
[1:03:42] exactly
[1:03:44] they must obey the messenger and have
[1:03:48] respects to that messenger is
[1:03:55] look at Joshua and Caleb they stayed
[1:03:59] right by his side
[1:04:03] yes sir whatever Moses was in they was
[1:04:07] in it too
[1:04:11] whether Moses was right or wrong they
[1:04:13] stayed right with him anyhow
[1:04:21] see because they know that God was God's
[1:04:25] they know
[1:04:27] that he was God's messenger foreign
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:05:00] or whatever
[1:05:02] call it
[1:05:04] let the world do whatever they want
[1:05:08] but you give respects
[1:05:19] and when they come before God
[1:05:24] that's a Miriam
[1:05:26] videos
[1:05:39] the world
[1:05:42] God said don't you fear God
[1:05:49] to the high priest and Miriam the
[1:05:52] prophetesses
[1:05:56] said if there be any
[1:05:59] A man among you because
[1:06:07] spiritual or a prophet
[1:06:11] I the Lord
[1:06:14] or make myself known to him
[1:06:20] I speak to him in visions and reveal
[1:06:24] myself in dreams to him
[1:06:27] and so forth if he's spiritual or a
[1:06:30] prophet numbers 12 6 is
[1:06:47] my servant Moses
[1:06:49] I speak to him live two years
[1:06:54] numbers
[1:06:58] so don't you fear God
[1:07:01] in other words you talk about Moses
[1:07:07] they're talking about me
[1:07:20] if you can't respect Moses
[1:07:24] you don't respect me
[1:07:28] I haven't I've proven
[1:07:31] prove among you that my servant Moses
[1:07:45] and you have no reverence for him at all
[1:07:54] but that would be a lesson for the
[1:07:56] people of this day
[1:08:00] no respect no honors
[1:08:13] 79.
[1:08:15] no he said and because you don't do that
[1:08:18] that's
[1:08:19] the reason you got leprosy is
[1:08:26] that's the reason these things has went
[1:08:29] it's a lot
[1:08:32] because you ought to have known that
[1:08:35] this was my servant
[1:08:39] you don't know it
[1:08:41] so when you say something against him
[1:08:44] you're saying something against me
[1:08:51] so Moses praying for her life to be
[1:08:54] spared and God did spare her life
[1:09:05] and if that was the attitude of God in
[1:09:10] that day
[1:09:11] and God can't change
[1:09:14] God wants us to respect what he is doing
[1:09:18] is
[1:09:29] that you either respect that or
[1:09:31] something else is going to happen
[1:09:38] you know there was a woman that made fun
[1:09:41] of brother Bradham uh
[1:09:45] you remember she said I won't let a pet
[1:09:48] cow have the religion that William
[1:09:50] branham's got yes
[1:09:57] says that next day she died
[1:10:02] you've got to respect God
[1:10:06] you've got to do
[1:10:09] you you've got to do you you God demands
[1:10:13] respect and he demands it is
[1:10:29] Aaron to know better and knowing this
[1:10:33] that Moses was led by the spirit of God
[1:10:36] to do what he was doing yes
[1:10:48] there's a lot of examples that brother
[1:10:50] Brian talks about yeah
[1:10:58] making fun of Elijah
[1:11:01] disrespected Elijah
[1:11:06] and then the children
[1:11:10] that disrespected Elijah okay
[1:11:19] and about
[1:11:26] where Ahab
[1:11:28] caused the death of a first king 21.
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:38] and they did it because they respected
[1:11:41] God's messenger is
[1:12:07] or suffer the consequences
[1:12:13] it's either receive it or go into
[1:12:17] judgment
[1:12:21] either one you want
[1:12:26] and remember another time there was some
[1:12:28] irreverent children they have been
[1:12:31] raised up in a home
[1:12:38] where did the children learn to be
[1:12:40] Reverend is
[1:12:51] and you have the shermanite woman
[1:12:55] she respected the prophet ASC respect
[1:12:59] and God honored that respect
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:13] Mary the sister of Lazarus
[1:13:17] she respected the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:22] she got her brother back
[1:13:28] would you please stand
[1:13:37] a brother told me this this tax of
[1:13:40] brother Branham once
[1:13:42] um
[1:13:46] and I thought it was pretty good but I
[1:13:49] mean
[1:13:50] line 165.
[1:13:59] if you can't respect the man
[1:14:04] respect yeah
[1:14:07] the office he holds
[1:14:11] it is
[1:14:22] that's exactly right
[1:14:25] see respect him
[1:14:31] now in closing
[1:14:35] I really chopped up this message
[1:14:43] that we need to respect each other
[1:14:48] inspect the people out there too
[1:14:55] we'll be in good hands that we respect
[1:14:57] the people
[1:15:00] and then we respect each other

[1:15:32] Lord I pray Lord that this chopped up
[1:15:35] message Lord that the brothers sisters
[1:15:38] can go back and listen to this message
[1:15:50] talked a lot about respect
[1:15:55] are the Servants of God are not
[1:15:58] respected
[1:16:01] but then they had to pay for that so

[1:16:51] the Lord Jesus Christ problems
[1:17:05] but we trust in you Lord
[1:17:08] you are with us
