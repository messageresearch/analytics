[49:59] come unto me all you that are that labor
[50:02] and are heavy laden and I will give you
[50:03] rest
[50:08] that we're here today
[50:13] and there's only one place that there is
[50:16] rest in this world
[50:18] and that is on the unfailing unchanging
[50:21] unsearchable Promises of God yes
[50:27] that is what gives us rest tonight
[50:31] so with that if you would all please
[50:33] stand
[50:35] and we're going to open our Bibles in
[50:37] just a moment and then throw them
[50:40] before we do
[50:42] um before we uh open his word
[50:46] before we open his book
[50:50] says it's always good to approach the
[50:52] author of the book first
[50:56] there's a lot of books in this world
[50:58] that I I will never meet the authors
[51:03] but this is the top selling book of all
[51:06] time
[51:10] no other book that's been printed More
[51:13] Than This Bible
[51:16] and you have the opportunity to meet the
[51:19] authority he'll even sign your book for
[51:22] you tonight
[51:25] he'll sign your book in his own blood
[51:29] would you let them tonight
[51:32] the author is here to sign your book
[51:36] but before we open it let's just
[51:38] approach him now
[51:39] your heads
[51:41] our dear Lord Jesus
[51:44] Lord there is only one way that we come
[51:47] to you this evening
[51:50] that is by thy blood tonight
[51:53] no one of us are sufficient tonight
[52:01] we approach Thy word tonight
[52:04] is sufficient tonight
[52:07] it is sufficient to heal the sick
[52:11] it is sufficient to save the souls
[52:16] it is still sufficient to cleanse sin
[52:19] tonight
[52:23] precious sacrifice that you made for us
[52:29] in other words we open my word
[52:32] he simply asked that the Holy Spirit
[52:34] would come into the word tonight
[52:38] would it become alive to each one
[52:41] tonight
[52:42] and whatever need that amen
[52:58] in the book of First Corinthians chapter
[53:00] 11
[53:02] and that is going to be verse one we're
[53:05] going to read that
[53:08] and uh and when you have it you can say
[53:10] Amen First Corinthians
[53:13] chapter 11 verse
[53:17] and it says this is Paul speaking okay
[53:20] yes
[53:21] be ye followers of me
[53:25] even as I also am of Christ
[53:31] amen may the Lord has blessings to the
[53:34] reading of the word he will be seated
[53:38] so uh in this in this short verse that
[53:41] we just read
[53:45] it's all we're going to speak about
[53:47] tonight is
[53:49] and in this very short verse
[53:52] there's a great truth in it
[53:55] the great truth is there's two kinds of
[53:58] people in the world
[54:01] there are imitators existing imitadores
[54:05] and there are imitations
[54:07] two kinds of people
[54:10] you're either an imitator
[54:13] or you're an imitation
[54:15] which one are you tonight
[54:20] so there's a difference between the two
[54:22] existence
[54:24] the biggest difference between those two
[54:26] La difference
[54:28] is who do they follow is again the
[54:32] biggest difference in the imitator and
[54:34] the imitation is who do you follow the
[54:37] difference

[57:42] that's a real brother a real sisters
[57:46] so we just want to be real for just a
[57:49] few minutes
[57:50] I was reading an article in a magazine
[57:53] that's put out by focus on the family
[58:00] and it was an article about the the
[58:04] problems that we face in society today
[58:11] regarding devices

[58:17] and the article was telling everybody
[58:19] about you gotta be real El articulo

[59:49] real worried about how many steps
[59:54] let me tell you something tonight
[59:56] don't worry about how many steps you
[59:58] took foreign
[1:00:30] who are you following tonight
[1:00:34] I've heard many say that I'm a follower
[1:00:37] of this one on tick-tocks
[1:00:41] all right I'm a follower of so and so on
[1:00:44] on Facebook
[1:00:47] and Facebook or Instagram or in
[1:00:50] Instagram I hope this isn't digging too
[1:00:52] hard right
[1:00:54] but uh I'm a subscriber to someone's
[1:00:58] YouTube channel
[1:01:01] the YouTube
[1:01:03] so if you ever found yourself saying
[1:01:06] those things
[1:01:08] and be honest with yourself
[1:01:11] again I'm not here to scold anybody
[1:01:14] in particular I've got to walk this walk
[1:01:19] and the fingers point at me first
[1:01:24] but be honest with yourself
[1:01:27] have you do you ever say that I'm a
[1:01:30] follower of this one or I'm a follower
[1:01:31] of that one
[1:01:35] if uh if you do
[1:01:39] you you may be in real danger okay
[1:01:45] not not virtual danger
[1:01:48] virtual you may be in real dangerous
[1:01:54] because there's because Satan has
[1:01:57] figured something out
[1:02:00] he's figured out a way to take something
[1:02:02] that's not real foreign
[1:03:03] what are those those five things I just
[1:03:05] said what are those I just said is
[1:03:15] the five minutes to the spirit right
[1:03:18] we know the body has five minutes
[1:03:23] but our spirit has inlets
[1:03:27] and the devil will use our eyes and our
[1:03:30] ears
[1:03:32] take something that's not real
[1:03:35] and then all of a sudden our imagination
[1:03:39] and our memory and our conscience and
[1:03:41] our reason and our affection imagination
[1:03:46] all of a sudden it becomes
[1:03:50] and you hear way too much
[1:03:53] that a young person took their life
[1:03:56] because of something that became real to
[1:04:00] them
[1:04:02] that should have never been real okay
[1:04:08] if you find yourself caught in one of
[1:04:10] those website
[1:04:15] yeah
[1:04:18] it's real it's algo real your body is
[1:04:21] real
[1:04:22] your spirit is real
[1:04:25] and your soul is
[1:04:28] we're not playing games tonight
[1:04:31] I pray that that we have your attention
[1:04:35] ask her ask yourself what am I following

[1:05:01] followings of of with our devices
[1:05:08] here are some of the symptoms that they
[1:05:10] identified

[1:06:28] but that's just bait on the hook is
[1:06:33] following somebody on these platforms
[1:06:36] platform it's not just a way to connect
[1:06:39] you with others
[1:06:42] it's a way to trap you
[1:06:46] might say oh brother you're just getting

[1:07:52] today and forever
[1:07:55] but believe me
[1:07:57] bro Hermanos Hermanas I do live on the
[1:07:59] same Planet as you do Yota
[1:08:02] and I understand
[1:08:04] and I'm not telling you to shut down
[1:08:07] unplug all that
[1:08:13] if you find something take you your
[1:08:16] footsteps down the wrong path
[1:08:21] learn how to recognize it
[1:08:25] be aware
[1:08:27] the Bible says in Isaiah 5 14.
[1:08:32] and the prophet Isaiah is saying this
[1:08:35] because the people were following the
[1:08:37] wrong things
[1:08:39] and they've failed to consider the work
[1:08:42] of the Lord in their lives
[1:08:45] and the prophet came out and said
[1:08:47] therefore Hell hath enlarged herself
[1:08:54] and opened her mouth without measure
[1:08:59] and their Glory
[1:09:01] and their multitude and their pomp and
[1:09:05] he that rejoiceseth shall descend in
[1:09:08] yeah
[1:09:13] I pray that this is real to you tonight
[1:09:18] I'm your brother I'm just here to warn
[1:09:22] you yes
[1:09:25] you have to consider the Lord in every
[1:09:28] moment of your life
[1:09:31] even when you're connected
[1:09:34] be aware
[1:09:54] you might see a little benefit from them
[1:09:58] because they'll provide you with a
[1:10:00] little bit of perceived Unity
[1:10:04] but oftentimes this Unity is false
[1:10:08] um
[1:10:10] oh that's bad brother you're just bad
[1:10:13] news all day long today
[1:10:16] but there's good news tonight
[1:10:19] because if there's a false one
[1:10:21] it's only pointing that there's a true
[1:10:24] one somewhere
[1:10:26] there is a true one tonight
[1:10:29] in Christ there is connectivity
[1:10:32] and there is true Unity
[1:10:36] and it'll Build You Up
[1:10:38] it'll establish you
[1:11:15] Unity will be
[1:11:17] is
[1:12:05] so listen closely
[1:12:07] give you a conspiracy theory
[1:12:11] this technology is the technology it's
[1:12:15] not developed with your well-being in
[1:12:16] mind
[1:12:21] a lot of these things you think they're
[1:12:24] they're doing is good
[1:12:27] they're not doing good with your good in
[1:12:29] mind
[1:12:32] it's developed to gain information about
[1:12:35] you is
[1:12:42] the world of artificial intelligence
[1:12:47] not real intelligence
[1:12:56] it's being based yes on what is being
[1:13:00] harvested
[1:13:03] from you and me the
[1:13:08] that information that false intelligence
[1:13:10] is
[1:13:12] coming from what is harvested
[1:13:18] Tick Tock was built around the
[1:13:19] recommendation or algorithm
[1:13:23] programs
[1:13:26] you can look that up for yourself
[1:13:30] the algorithm uses your followings uh
[1:13:33] Los algoritos
[1:13:37] it takes your views your likes your
[1:13:40] conversations
[1:13:44] well I hope you're feeling violated
[1:13:46] right now by this is
[1:13:53] your your followings your views your
[1:13:56] likes your conversations
[1:14:00] to build a profile on you
[1:14:04] and then it knows
[1:14:07] the danger is how quickly it can come to
[1:14:09] know you yeah
[1:14:12] you get down on the clicking business
[1:14:19] building who this person is
[1:14:27] and how quickly it can know you
[1:14:31] quickly it can trap
[1:14:34] I hope I'm scaring somebody tonight
[1:14:38] I heard a report
[1:14:41] of people who said Tick-Tock knew about
[1:14:44] more about them in a few minutes
[1:14:50] then anybody would know for the rest of
[1:14:53] your life
[1:15:00] Masters Academy
[1:15:20] there's a real one tonight
[1:15:23] the real one he created you
[1:15:28] for more and he made you for a purpose
[1:15:31] and before the foundation of the world
[1:15:34] was placed
[1:15:38] he didn't need you to click click click
[1:15:41] hello
[1:15:47] and he already provided a way of Escape
[1:15:50] for you and me yes
[1:15:55] the real one he knows how many times
[1:15:59] he'll blink your eyes
[1:16:02] he knows how many times he'll comb your
[1:16:04] hair
[1:16:06] you don't know how many hairs are on the
[1:16:08] comb when you're done
[1:16:24] and he wants to be in your life
[1:16:27] but you have to afternoon
[1:16:35] and he has a name it's a real name and
[1:16:40] my real name is Jesus
[1:16:43] you might not think that a God who can
[1:16:46] possibly know that much about you says
[1:16:53] if garbage that's made by men
[1:16:57] somebody so quickly foreign
[1:17:15] praise the Lord
[1:17:18] amen
[1:17:20] he is your creator tonight
[1:17:24] we're about two-thirds of the way done
[1:17:26] everybody okay
[1:17:29] just got a few more minutes
[1:17:31] that was a little background
[1:17:35] now let's get into the scriptures
[1:17:38] First Corinthians
[1:17:42] again Paul says Be You followers of me
[1:17:45] even as I also am of Christ
[1:17:50] so here in this verse we missing we
[1:17:53] misunderstand this verse a lot
[1:17:56] we say that Paul said follow me as I
[1:17:59] follow Christ
[1:18:03] we've repeated it that way many times
[1:18:06] but the way it is written
[1:18:10] Paul said to follow him
[1:18:14] even as he is he also is of Christ
[1:18:21] he also is of Christ
[1:18:24] in First Corinthians chapter 4 in
[1:18:27] primary Corinthians Paul also said you
[1:18:30] have 10 000 instructors in Christ
[1:18:36] but not many fathers
[1:18:39] he goes on to say that in Christ Jesus
[1:18:43] says I Paul Joe Pablo have begotten you
[1:18:47] thank Andre in the channel of the
[1:18:50] message
[1:18:51] so by this understanding
[1:18:55] we can say that Paul said he said follow
[1:18:59] me
[1:19:01] how are we supposed to follow
[1:19:04] in Christ increased in the word
[1:19:08] that is the only correct way that we can
[1:19:11] follow tonight
[1:19:14] you'll never understand brother
[1:19:25] follow me even as I also am
[1:19:28] said
[1:19:30] I'm in Christ
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:42] we get outside of that
[1:19:45] angel from
[1:19:48] teaches you something different
[1:19:58] so where's the Misunderstood
[1:20:01] it's in the it's in the statement follow
[1:20:04] me
[1:20:06] in Greek in the Greek
[1:20:22] or be an
[1:20:24] us
[1:20:27] as he is
[1:20:34] that's hard that's hard to understand
[1:20:36] this is
[1:20:47] in our message title is imitator or
[1:20:50] imitation is
[1:20:57] not talking
[1:21:00] about imitations
[1:21:13] there are many invitations in
[1:21:15] Christianity
[1:21:18] there are many artificial
[1:21:26] imitations produce false religion
[1:21:29] imitations
[1:21:52] hard to tell the difference is
[1:21:59] in fact and Jesus said in Matthew 24 24
[1:22:02] Jesus
[1:22:06] they tell the imitation
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:18] thank God that our prophet clarifies it
[1:22:20] but it
[1:22:21] is foreign
[1:22:32] but every
[1:22:35] everything
[1:22:37] imitation every great name
[1:22:42] is
[1:22:48] everybody
[1:22:50] if you were being accused of being a
[1:22:54] Christian
[1:22:56] o and you went before
[1:23:06] for every great name
[1:23:09] imitation
[1:23:14] Michael Kors
[1:23:19] of course coach lamarca coach some of
[1:23:22] the girls are like they're he's not
[1:23:24] saying the right names yeah
[1:23:38] lots of imitations every great name has
[1:23:44] what's the
[1:23:46] difference it looks just like it
[1:23:50] has the name
[1:23:53] but I can get it
[1:23:56] that's good right
[1:23:59] let me tell you something tonight
[1:24:06] he gave everything that he is
[1:24:18] this real man
[1:24:22] this is a
[1:24:26] take his life
[1:24:29] for me he would lay him
[1:24:35] in
[1:24:36] real life
[1:24:42] and if he was willing to pay the
[1:24:45] greatest Price
[1:24:56] it's the same
[1:25:01] but I can get it
[1:25:12] is
[1:25:20] you make bad
[1:25:23] decision is
[1:25:39] and I saw this person I said that's a
[1:25:41] good deal on this foreign
[1:26:23] I I had to give that present to my wife
[1:26:30] fortunately she's gracious
[1:26:34] she used it it didn't take long and it
[1:26:37] was not usable anymore no but she used
[1:26:40] it
[1:26:43] but uh but what makes the difference in
[1:26:45] a in a real and a fake
[1:26:49] the difference is who made it
[1:26:56] you're real tonight
[1:27:01] somebody a master
[1:27:12] I know that that watch was made with the
[1:27:15] finest materials in the world foreign
[1:28:04] Metallica
[1:28:27] so it is in the religious World
[1:28:30] many put the name of Christ
[1:28:34] but all they have is a green band around
[1:28:38] them
[1:28:40] a green religious
[1:28:43] bands
[1:28:46] that man-made religion will just leave a
[1:28:49] marker is
[1:28:55] a true Christian
[1:28:57] it is the genuine Life of Christ
[1:29:02] he said he had a little while in the
[1:29:04] world will see me no more
[1:29:07] but you shall see me foreign
[1:29:52] change where your footsteps is
[1:30:07] look at different things
[1:30:16] you're born of Christ the word
[1:30:20] and that word comes to a prophet yes
[1:30:23] and it is through that channel of the
[1:30:26] message
[1:30:28] you follow that channel
[1:30:31] by one Spirit foreign
[1:30:48] a true Christian doesn't make their life
[1:30:50] up
[1:30:52] it is Christ Living in them doing the
[1:30:56] works of Christ on Earth today
[1:31:00] a true Christian follows Christ the word
[1:31:03] um
[1:31:04] and nothing else will do
[1:31:08] Jesus said my sheep hear my voice Jesus
[1:31:13] and I know them
[1:31:15] he knows you tonight
[1:31:17] my sheep know my voice and I know them
[1:31:25] nothing else will do
[1:31:28] everything else is imitation
[1:31:31] it might look like the real thing
[1:31:34] but the difference is
[1:31:37] if you're not in Christ the words
[1:31:41] something else
[1:31:45] let me ask you a personal question
[1:31:48] if you want for just a minute
[1:32:10] this could be the night that you break
[1:32:12] free is
[1:32:16] am I being real with myself
[1:32:20] am I truly following Christ the word
[1:32:24] or am I following after something else
[1:32:28] we're going to close it in just a moment
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:32] our oldest daughter Chloe
[1:32:36] she I think she's online I think my mom
[1:32:38] and dad are online as well
[1:32:43] we have this painting hanging in our
[1:32:45] home that she made for us
[1:32:49] brother Branham I believe it's in the
[1:32:51] message broken sisters
[1:32:55] listen close to this is
[1:32:58] Brother Branham says the more of Christ
[1:33:02] you put on
[1:33:05] the more conscience you will be of your
[1:33:09] own conditions
[1:33:14] this is the word of the Lord that came
[1:33:17] to the prophets
[1:33:19] the more of Christ you put on
[1:33:23] the more conscious you will be of your
[1:33:26] own conditions
[1:33:30] if you choose to follow Christo
[1:33:34] it'll make you become more conscious of
[1:33:37] your conditions
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:40] you gotta be ready for that if you're
[1:33:44] not ready if you're not really ready to
[1:33:45] follow Christ
[1:33:48] don't just take his name
[1:33:51] you'll be responsible for that
[1:33:55] if you take the name of Christ done
[1:33:59] you better be ready for Wars
[1:34:03] because when you take the name of Christ
