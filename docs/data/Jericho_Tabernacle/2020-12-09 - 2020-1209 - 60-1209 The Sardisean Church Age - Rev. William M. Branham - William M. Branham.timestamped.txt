[9:43] up
[10:13] after the service is closed at night to
[10:15] keep children from running through it
[10:17] showing breaking out the windows and so
[10:18] forth you know how kitties are

[12:32] it makes it quite a problem
[13:03] but we're always happy to meet the
[13:06] people and do what we can for them
[13:08] because
[13:09] it's the that's our we are a public
[13:11] servant
[13:12] for the lord jesus christ to his people
[13:14] in this state
[13:15] we like to do more than we do do but

[14:37] you remember your physical and we we
[14:39] won't we think the whole burdens laid on
[14:41] us but
[14:42] you know god got servants everywhere to
[14:43] take care of some of that so
[14:45] we just do the best we can but a
[14:47] gracious minister trying to
[14:48] do all he can in this last days for his
[14:56] lord
[15:10] is

[15:56] lord's got a message for him
[16:14] i raised up the bible and i said i'm
[16:16] going to lay these things in here so you

[16:44] spirit said
[16:48] the polonium
[17:04] stayed right with him all along and
[17:06] finally drugged him from kansas city
[17:08] to the building last night and then he
[17:10] really got confused when he heard about

[22:38] time
[22:51] now there uh many of the folks at
[22:54] jeffersonville was telling me said
[22:56] they come up the time they get here
[22:58] about five o'clock so they didn't
[22:59] even room for their cars or six so they
[23:02] i said well you
[23:03] this is our visiting brethren from
[23:05] everywhere people
[23:06] many ministers i said they're they're
[23:08] laying on to the teaching of this
[23:12] person
[23:20] is
[23:37] and we're just trying to hit the
[23:39] highlights and then
[23:41] a little later why we'll have it in book
[23:43] form so he can read it and
[23:45] and it'll be a little a little more
[23:47] added to it because at night
[24:02] you noticed last couple nights of trying
[24:04] to save the voice you see because
[24:06] that big climax that's what i want to
[24:08] see there the revelation of christ be
[24:10] made in this age
[24:12] thing of what it is
[24:27] and now before we start reading the
[24:31] scriptures and i know tomorrow's the big
[24:32] commercial day when we all have to go
[24:34] get our
[24:35] saturday nights groceries in and we have
[24:37] to get them on saturday afternoon or
[24:38] saturday morning one so we can have
[24:40] saturday night
[24:41] free to come to church
[25:01] so we'll try to let out early tonight so
[25:02] he will be too tired tomorrow to get it
[25:04] and get back to the afternoon service
[25:06] with the brothers here with the tapes
[25:08] and and also for
[25:09] tomorrow night
[25:23] now can we just stand a moment for
[25:25] prayer if you will
[25:28] i wonder before we pray if there's
[25:30] anyone here has special requests for
[25:32] prayer if you just
[25:33] let it be known by enough lifted hand
[25:35] god sees
[25:36] now you see whether we're in a needy
[25:38] world or not brother i guess
[25:40] 95 or 98 percent of the audience lifted
[25:42] their hands
[25:51] especially
[26:09] i remember you can't even move without
[26:12] god knowing it
[26:13] he knows your intentions he know what
[26:15] she was asking for
[26:16] let us bow our heads
[26:31] gracious heavenly father we are
[26:34] approaching thy
[26:35] holiness tonight that throne
[26:39] through that promise that you said that
[26:41] you would hear
[26:42] and if we would believe you would give
[26:44] us what we asked for
[27:00] and we are confessing all of our wrongs
[27:03] we
[27:03] realize lord that we're not we're not
[27:05] worthy of any of your blessings
[27:08] we are we are unworthy we are
[27:11] all together unworthy and we do not
[27:14] come as if we were we were worthy and
[27:17] and we've done something great
[27:19] oh father when we look at calvary that
[27:21] takes all the greatness away from us
[27:23] we know nothing else and but christ and
[27:25] him crucified
[27:28] us
[27:46] oh
[27:58] then when we see that he raised up on
[28:00] the third day according to the
[28:01] scriptures for our justification
[28:04] return back forty days later in the form
[28:07] of the holy spirit to abide with us
[28:09] until his
[28:10] visible appearing in the skies at the
[28:12] end time

[38:20] now we begin on the first verse
[38:23] of the third chapter of this church age
[38:28] the message to sardis the period of the
[38:31] reformation
[38:32] a small believing remnant left
[38:36] just almost out
[38:40] of
[38:44] the mensah
[38:55] some of the newcomers i might say on
[38:58] this share that so much you won't be
[39:00] behind in it
[39:03] it's rather crude and sometimes we're
[39:06] going to
[39:07] come where we can place our messages out
[39:10] on the
[39:11] draw it up come in the afternoon fix it
[39:13] up may do it sunday
[39:26] carlos
[39:33] now these each represent the church age
[39:35] one two three four five six seven
[39:38] this beginning with philadelphia and
[39:40] this
[39:41] up here represents the the pentecostal
[39:45] power or a church that was on pentecost
[40:07] it was quite a large church at the
[40:10] beginning
[40:11] but they started
[40:15] a denominational spirit coming among
[40:17] them trying to denominate the church
[40:19] which was called the deeds of the
[40:22] nicholades can you hear me way back
[40:24] yeah all right
[40:36] let's get
[40:48] no it wasn't a doctrine yet and then we
[40:51] tucked the word and broke it down
[40:52] what was deeds what was nick o'lady and
[40:55] that's a foreign name to us
[40:57] nick oladian la sobras de los nicolaitas
[41:14] so i took the greek and broke it down
[41:17] and
[41:17] nickel means to conquer or to
[41:20] overcome or overthrow something nicole
[41:24] layton lady is the church laity
[41:28] nick only uh a deeds that was trying to
[41:32] overthrow the laity and put all
[41:36] the blessing and the only one to read
[41:38] the bible the only one to give the
[41:39] interpretation
[41:40] would be the bishop or some great head
[41:44] person of the church
[41:46] [Music]
[42:00] a
[42:15] principal de la iglesia then we find out
[42:18] in the second church agent would be in
[42:21] the squeeze way out this is
[42:22] still pentecost and this
[42:26] is denomination d now in the third
[42:30] church eight
[42:31] pergamus pentecost is almost squeezed
[42:34] out
[42:35] but the doctrine of denomination
[42:38] it become from a deedshare all the way
[42:41] to a doctrine here
[43:07] married right here they married
[43:11] the this group here that had overpowered
[43:13] the pentecostal groups
[43:15] now the way i'm saying that brethren
[43:18] that is the
[43:19] honest stack that's according to
[43:23] the sacred writings of the histories
[43:27] the books of the nicene council fox book
[43:30] of the martyrs
[43:30] and all the great ancient writings
[43:52] historia
[44:01] i've got some of the oldest manuscripts
[44:02] there is and everyone i'll say this was
[44:05] not
[44:06] not saying uh pentecost that don't mean
[44:08] when i say pentecost that doesn't mean
[44:10] this organization the day we're living
[44:12] in
[44:13] that's just as guilty as the rest of
[44:15] them
[44:34] but i mean the real pentecostal the real
[44:37] spirit of god with the original doctrine
[44:40] with the original blessings with the
[44:42] original names
[44:43] with everything exactly the way it began
[44:45] at the beginning
[44:46] like it went through the bible
[45:06] now then when we come to this age you
[45:08] see how far pentecost comes up
[45:10] can you see it in the back all right can
[45:12] you make it out way back there all right
[45:14] hold on hold on
[45:26] now here come last night the
[45:29] great age that were in here constantine
[45:33] constantine c-o-n-f
[45:37] he being a pagan
[45:40] was asked these christians here
[45:44] the ones that had the doctrine of the
[45:46] nicolas if they would pray
[45:48] that he would win a certain battle well
[45:51] he would become a christian
[45:57] constantino
[46:15] during that time when he was at battle
[46:17] he dreamed a dream
[46:19] that he should by a white cross that was
[46:22] put before he said
[46:24] buy this you win that's right
[46:38] [Music]
[46:41] then he woke his army up and painted on
[46:43] their shield
[46:44] a white cross and that was the
[46:47] birthplace or the beginning of the
[46:49] catholic order today called the knights
[46:52] of columbus
[47:09] you can't glean one thing from the
[47:11] histories
[47:12] of him being converted he was nothing
[47:15] but a crooked politician
[47:20] hi
[47:21] [Music]
[47:30] he had in his mind the idea to to unite
[47:34] his kingdom
[47:35] and make it strong so he and himself
[47:38] being a pagan
[47:39] worshipped the idols then he seemed that
[47:42] the doctrine of the nickelodeons had
[47:44] almost squeezed out to a place so he
[47:47] used the same a strategy that we found
[47:49] out last night
[48:09] and jesus predicted it 304 years before
[48:13] it come to pass
[48:14] that he would teach the doctrine of
[48:17] balaam
[48:18] how that balaam deceived the children of
[48:20] israel calls them to commit fornications
[48:23] and
[48:23] and offered take things offered to idols
[48:26] eat things
[48:27] now we know that eating these things
[48:29] offered to idols
[48:31] what it really was was worshiping
[48:46] is
[49:00] adoration going in they were bowing
[49:03] down to idols putting
[49:06] idols back in the christian church just
[49:09] like
[49:10] balaam did back there had israel to
[49:13] commit fornications
[49:28] is
[49:34] well constantine did the same thing with
[49:36] his strategy
[49:38] and he made a church he gave a lot at
[49:40] the nazi
[49:41] council and then they he made a a lot of
[49:45] um
[49:46] great buildings that he had and he
[49:48] converted these into churches
[49:56] much
[50:07] and then he made a big marble altar
[50:10] decorated with gold and gems up above
[50:13] there he put like a throne
[50:15] and he made one man the head like a he
[50:17] was called then
[50:18] a bishop and they put him up on this
[50:22] throne
[50:22] uh boniface iii
[50:47] not only did he walk around with clothes
[50:49] on like the
[50:50] peasant did but they made him um a
[50:54] great uh fine robes and dressed him up
[50:57] like a god
[50:58] and set him up there and called him the
[51:01] biker
[51:03] viker or the vik vicarious
[51:06] ophelia adelia means instead
[51:09] of the son of god
[51:20] grandest
[51:35] draw write that out by carius ophelia
[51:38] and then when you draw a line on here
[51:40] and add the numbers and you got
[51:42] exactly what god said the mark of the
[51:43] beast was 666
[51:46] amen
[52:10] i've been in rome have been in the
[52:11] vatican and the triple crown
[52:14] jurisdiction hell heaven and purgatory
[52:17] see seen the crown seen the vest
[52:36] actually on a thursday afternoon at
[52:38] three o'clock i was supposed to meet
[52:40] the last pope that was there baron von
[52:43] bomberg
[52:44] heather and he said now when you go
[52:45] brother branham the first thing you have
[52:47] juice batter on your right knee and kiss
[52:48] that ring
[52:50] really down
[52:56] bloomberg daniella
[53:10] amen i said i give i have nothing it's a
[53:12] man
[53:13] he they said i said there's one thing
[53:15] i'll give a man his title if he's
[53:17] reverend uh that's all right bishop
[53:20] elder
[53:20] doctor whatever i'm glad to sue the man
[53:26] sonny pence
[53:43] do a worship to a man i'll owe my
[53:45] homereach to one man jesus christ
[53:47] that's the only man i doubt now for us
[53:49] to just forget it just cancel
[53:51] out i wouldn't take it
[54:07] and so after coming home i found out
[54:09] there was another great american did
[54:11] that too
[54:12] teddy roosevelt he refused to do it on
[54:13] account remember that in history
[54:15] that he refused to see the pope because
[54:17] he had to kiss his
[54:18] ring or they have it on a big toe also
[54:20] you know so
[54:22] oh no
[54:51] balaam then we found out last night over
[54:54] now here first before we leave here they
[54:56] consolidated this church and married
[54:59] got some pagan ideas pagan idols that
[55:02] was in the church
[55:03] nasi quentos
[55:22] the god of jupiter the god of the sun
[55:26] the god of mars the god of venus and all
[55:29] those
[55:30] idols of gods and he took all them out
[55:34] of the pagan churches and put up paul
[55:38] peter virgin mary
[55:41] all those and said here is your biker
[55:44] because jesus told peter i gave you the
[55:47] keys and
[55:48] he is an apostolic successor that's
[55:50] still catholic doctor to this day
[55:53] jupiter
[56:23] and what did they do brought idol
[56:25] worship into christianity
[56:28] so-called christianity not real
[56:30] christianity
[56:31] because the little pentecostal yes
[56:39] christianism christianism
[56:46] i remember i don't i didn't say baptist
[56:49] methodist presbyterian
[56:50] they're at all but the real january wine
[56:53] article of god
[56:54] was pentecost was is and will always be
[57:00] that's where the church begins right
[57:01] here with pentecostal power
[57:10] alberta
[57:22] now you say is that right brother brahm
[57:25] i'll ask you to take the histories
[57:27] and look down through the stream of time
[57:30] to hear and find out if every
[57:32] one of those real true children of god
[57:35] didn't hold on to that pentecostal
[57:37] blessing
[57:38] is
[57:55] spoke in tongues interpret tongues had
[57:57] signs and wonders
[57:59] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[58:01] everything that the apostles did they
[58:03] did too right down to that
[58:05] was interpreted
[58:21] i took paul and arenas
[58:24] and um and and down to saint martin
[58:27] columbus
[58:28] every one of those men's plum down into
[58:30] this age here
[58:31] had signs and wonders
[58:49] the mic was having a little uh is that
[58:51] better
[58:52] yes all right no it's shake their head
[58:54] they can't hear at all now bill
[58:57] all right can you is it oh you hear me
[58:59] now
[59:01] now how's that is that better everybody
[59:04] says all right paul
[59:05] that's one mark against you all right
[59:08] [Music]
[59:10] okay
[59:16] muy
[59:40] in this age here then while he made up
[59:42] this great big thing and put up
[59:44] this man here as a universal bishop over
[59:47] all the churches
[59:49] given plenty of money and so forth and
[59:51] promised them and did
[59:52] unite the church and state together and
[59:55] let the church control the state
[59:57] made him a great man
[1:00:18] so there is exactly
[1:00:22] what constantine did is the very same
[1:00:25] thing that we found over in this other
[1:00:26] church
[1:00:27] that what god said that um in the days
[1:00:30] of elijah
[1:00:31] that they suffered that woman jezebel
[1:00:35] to subdue his children that taking place
[1:00:37] in the dark age
[1:01:03] just black it out and for almost 1 000
[1:01:07] years
[1:01:08] it from about 500 to 1500 right that's
[1:01:11] 606 to 5 30
[1:01:13] at 5 20 is exact numbers but right on 1
[1:01:16] 000 years
[1:01:17] there are bloody persecutions read the
[1:01:20] history
[1:01:47] a catholic will tell you that the
[1:01:48] christian church they was a christian
[1:01:50] church they
[1:01:51] are the denominational christian church
[1:01:54] but the true pentecostals was pressed
[1:01:56] out
[1:01:57] killed and murdered and put to death by
[1:02:00] the popes and bishops and so forth
[1:02:02] bloody as it could be
[1:02:27] someday that's going to cost me my life
[1:02:29] see to say that
[1:02:31] well that's one thing sure i know which
[1:02:33] way i'm headed
