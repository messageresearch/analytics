[54:19] worthy we ask for all this in the name
[54:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen epes
[54:26] Ephesians
[54:35] 1:4 according as he has chosen according
[54:39] he has chosen Us in him before the
[54:41] foundation of the world that we should
[54:43] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[54:54] love having predestinated us unto the
[54:57] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[54:59] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:01] of his well
[55:02] amen you may be seated
[55:09] Brothers this morning if we can give a
[55:11] title to our
[55:15] thought I would like to call it the
[55:17] mystery of his
[55:21] will now that word mystery is something
[55:24] that is very out
[55:30] understanding and I believe that the
[55:32] people uh they really pay close
[55:34] attention to the
[55:36] Mysteries and I think that's something
[55:38] that's very
[55:41] good but I also believe that the
[55:43] simpleness of the
[55:46] word will bring us the revelation of
[55:49] those
[55:52] Mysteries if we go to that very same
[55:54] chapter
[55:58] chap if you can have your Bibles open
[56:00] we'll be reading several
[56:05] scriptures once again we'll be reading
[56:07] verse
[56:18] five having predestinated us unto the
[56:21] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[56:23] himself according to to the good
[56:25] pleasure of his
[56:28] well so the word is now telling us that
[56:31] he predestinated
[56:33] us the word
[56:36] predestinate uh the prophet says it in a
[56:38] very simple
[56:43] way it's not that he chooses this one
[56:45] and this one and not this one and not
[56:47] this
[56:48] one but he sent his only begotten son to
[56:51] the entire
[56:53] world so that who whoever believeth in
[56:57] him shall not perish but will be
[57:00] saved but
[57:04] predestination is that he chose
[57:08] us but then we chose him back
[57:12] amen we chose
[57:15] him when did where did we choose
[57:18] him did we choose him here on the
[57:21] earth we chose him back then when
[57:25] thought about
[57:26] us and then he shaped
[57:29] us and and then he said you're going to
[57:32] choose
[57:32] me do you want to choose me because I
[57:36] will choose
[57:38] you and did you choose you
[57:43] did then it says unto the adoption of
[57:46] his
[57:47] children so what is
[57:50] adoption is to be placed as a
[57:53] child
[57:56] in other words it's God giving you the
[57:58] entire
[58:01] load in other words your signature is
[58:04] just as good as the father's amen amen
[58:07] when I have my
[58:10] son and I believe that you know my son
[58:14] right imagine I go to my house and I say
[58:19] Lucas me and the pastor are going to
[58:23] color I want you to take take care of
[58:25] this entire
[58:27] house make sure that all the lights are
[58:29] turned
[58:30] off give water the
[58:32] plants imagine what what is Lucas gon to
[58:35] say he's going to say no no
[58:37] no he doesn't understand
[58:40] yet but he will
[58:42] grow and then he's going to learn
[58:47] amen so the father will see that his son
[58:51] that he's ready
[58:53] amen that is is being
[58:59] adopted it says according to the good
[59:01] pleasure of his
[59:04] will so the
[59:07] Lord in his good will he chose
[59:12] us so he has a
[59:15] will what is a will it's a
[59:18] desire a heart's desire amen amen
[59:22] Brothers verse seven now
[59:32] in whom we have Redemption through his
[59:35] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[59:37] to the riches of his
[59:38] grace verse
[59:43] n having made known unto us the mystery
[59:46] of his
[59:51] will according to his good pleasure
[59:53] which he had purposed in
[59:57] himself now I see two very important
[59:59] things in this one
[1:00:01] verse I see the mystery of his
[1:00:08] will and then the last phrase says which
[1:00:11] he ha purposed in
[1:00:16] himself so he himself before the
[1:00:18] foundation of the
[1:00:20] world he chose
[1:00:23] us in him
[1:00:27] self he chose us in
[1:00:31] himself the mystery of his
[1:00:34] well it said but it also says having
[1:00:37] made known unto
[1:00:39] us so there is a mystery to his will
[1:00:45] okay so a will means the desire of the
[1:00:50] heart but then it says the
[1:00:53] mystery there's a mystery in that
[1:00:58] desire there's a mystery in what the
[1:01:00] Lord is
[1:01:03] Desiring but here the scripture says
[1:01:05] that he will make known unto
[1:01:08] us that mystery of his will
[1:01:14] okay let's go to verse
[1:01:23] 10
[1:01:26] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:01:28] of times he might gather together into
[1:01:31] one all things in Christ both both which
[1:01:34] are in heaven and which are on earth
[1:01:36] even in
[1:01:53] him
[1:01:55] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[1:01:57] an inheritance being predestinated
[1:02:00] according to the purpose of him now
[1:02:02] listen of him who worketh all things
[1:02:05] after the counsel of his own
[1:02:10] will so in him we have an
[1:02:13] inheritance being
[1:02:18] predestinated it says according after
[1:02:21] the counsel of his own
[1:02:23] will
[1:02:25] so we're seeing out the mystery of his
[1:02:28] will and then the counsel of his will
[1:02:32] amen one is the
[1:02:35] mystery the other one is the counsel or
[1:02:38] the
[1:02:42] plan I have some slides if the sisters
[1:02:45] can help uh show
[1:02:48] it I'm a I'm a person that doesn't
[1:02:51] really speak good in English nor in
[1:02:53] Spanish
[1:02:56] so I have to go look up the
[1:02:59] words so the word uh in Spanish that it
[1:03:02] uses is design plan or purpose which
[1:03:05] means and the definition is is purpose
[1:03:12] intention or plan to make something come
[1:03:15] to
[1:03:16] pass so the
[1:03:19] synonyms for the word design is plan is
[1:03:23] thought
[1:03:26] plan or a final
[1:03:30] outcome so when I read the word uh
[1:03:32] design or
[1:03:34] counsel I can substitute
[1:03:38] them I can put there the thought of his
[1:03:42] will the purpose of his
[1:03:45] will the plan of his
[1:03:48] will and then in
[1:03:50] English it doesn't use the word plan or
[1:03:53] design
[1:03:54] it says the word
[1:03:57] counsel and I said that's really
[1:04:02] tremendous so the definition of the word
[1:04:07] counsel which is a advice given a
[1:04:12] consultation and then here's something
[1:04:15] tremendous uh a
[1:04:18] lawyer that represents someone
[1:04:21] else or a group at a court
[1:04:25] setting and then here are the
[1:04:28] synonyms
[1:04:30] recommendations
[1:04:32] ideas
[1:04:33] attorney or a
[1:04:38] Defender so when I read that it says the
[1:04:40] plan of his
[1:04:43] will the counil of his will and in
[1:04:46] English the word that he uses in that
[1:04:47] translation says the counsel of his
[1:04:50] will so the Lord had counsel in his his
[1:04:54] own will in
[1:04:56] himself he had a thought and he
[1:05:00] thought in each and every one of us
[1:05:03] every one of
[1:05:07] us after the counsel of his
[1:05:10] will now remember what is that word uh
[1:05:14] design mean it's a plan it's a
[1:05:18] thought so his
[1:05:20] will had a had a
[1:05:22] thinking and thought about us to choose
[1:05:27] us and then it also says that it's an
[1:05:30] attorney he's a an
[1:05:33] advocate a Defender and I think that's
[1:05:35] very
[1:05:36] tremendous because that's exactly what I
[1:05:38] need I need an
[1:05:42] advocate because we uh make mistakes
[1:05:44] every
[1:05:48] day we think we're doing a service to
[1:05:50] God when we're not doing a service for
[1:05:53] God but in first John it
[1:05:55] says it says my little
[1:05:59] children these things write I unto you
[1:06:03] that you sin
[1:06:05] not and if any man
[1:06:08] sin we have an
[1:06:11] advocate with the father who is
[1:06:14] it it's Jesus
[1:06:16] Christ he's our
[1:06:21] Advocate we cannot advocate for
[1:06:23] ourselves
[1:06:25] David Henry or John Henry I don't
[1:06:27] remember the name of the man David or
[1:06:28] John
[1:06:32] Henry quickly when he dreamt that he
[1:06:34] went into God's
[1:06:36] presence and the Lord asked him did you
[1:06:38] ever
[1:06:40] lie there
[1:06:42] here in in our conscience of our own
[1:06:44] testimony he
[1:06:46] answered yes Lord I
[1:06:49] did did you ever
[1:06:51] steal yeah yes Lord I did
[1:06:55] did you ever do this or that well yes
[1:06:58] Lord I did well I was an
[1:07:00] evangelist I was such and such in the
[1:07:03] church I had this position in the
[1:07:07] church that won't help you
[1:07:10] here God answered with that great
[1:07:14] voice so then his face
[1:07:18] fell and then brother Adam says he was
[1:07:21] expecting for God to send him to
[1:07:22] hell but then the advocate came the
[1:07:26] defender
[1:07:28] came the Lord Jesus Christ came he said
[1:07:32] yes
[1:07:33] Lord he did all these
[1:07:36] things he failed in every
[1:07:39] point but he stood for
[1:07:41] me so I'll stand for
[1:07:44] him he's our
[1:07:46] Advocate he's our
[1:07:48] Defender but
[1:07:50] you have to stand for him today
[1:07:54] not
[1:07:55] tomorrow not the next week but
[1:07:59] today you have to make your stand for
[1:08:02] him amen
[1:08:07] Brothers he's our
[1:08:11] Advocate these words are very
[1:08:13] tremendous the counsel of his
[1:08:16] will the mystery of his
[1:08:20] will I believe that every
[1:08:22] mystery propeta William Mar Bram that
[1:08:25] has been reveal has been revealed by the
[1:08:27] prophet William Mar and
[1:08:31] Bram the word councel in
[1:08:35] Greek which is U it means to call to one
[1:08:39] side it's a
[1:08:45] decision and so Council in Greek means
[1:08:48] called to one
[1:08:49] side so the Lord in his councel called
[1:08:55] you to be on his
[1:09:00] side the word counsel in
[1:09:05] Hebrew it's a confidential
[1:09:08] discussion it's a
[1:09:10] secret or a
[1:09:13] plan it's a circle of confidants or
[1:09:17] counsel so it's a
[1:09:20] secret his will is a
[1:09:22] secret
[1:09:25] I want you to follow me because I'm
[1:09:26] heading
[1:09:28] somewhere so what is his
[1:09:31] plan what is his counsel his
[1:09:36] thinking what is it that he wants what
[1:09:38] is his
[1:09:39] mystery let's go to the book of
[1:09:43] Isaiah verse
[1:09:46] 46 forgive me chapter
[1:09:49] 46 verse
[1:09:52] 9
[1:09:56] it says remember the former things of
[1:10:00] old so here the scripture is telling us
[1:10:03] one
[1:10:06] thing it says remember the former things
[1:10:09] of
[1:10:12] old so now in Deuteronomy
[1:10:15] 327 that's what the exactly the Bible
[1:10:20] says it says remember the days days of
[1:10:26] old consider the years of many
[1:10:30] generations ask thy
[1:10:32] father and he will show thee thy
[1:10:37] elders and they will tell
[1:10:41] thee so the word here in
[1:10:46] Isaiah it says remember the former
[1:10:48] things of
[1:10:49] old and in
[1:10:51] Deuteronomy it says
[1:10:54] it says go ask your
[1:10:56] father and he will show you what the
[1:11:00] Lord Has
[1:11:01] Done ask your
[1:11:03] elders and they will tell
[1:11:06] you how the Lord brought us through the
[1:11:08] Red
[1:11:09] Sea how the water came out of the
[1:11:12] rock they will tell
[1:11:15] you but remember those
[1:11:19] times because sometimes we begin to
[1:11:22] forget where God brought us out
[1:11:25] of that's why we have our
[1:11:28] parents that's why we have the
[1:11:30] elders so they can remind us
[1:11:34] remember where God brought us out
[1:11:38] of how God showed
[1:11:42] this how there was a pillar of fire and
[1:11:44] he brought us out of the
[1:11:46] Wilderness we thank God for the
[1:11:49] fathers the spiritual fathers the elders
[1:11:54] am and then it keeps saying here it gets
[1:11:58] more
[1:11:59] tremendous it says I am
[1:12:02] God not that I was God or I will be
[1:12:06] God it says I am
[1:12:09] God and there is none
[1:12:12] else and there is none like
[1:12:16] me so uh your job can be your
[1:12:20] God your money can be your God
[1:12:24] everything else can be your
[1:12:26] God but God is telling us that I am God
[1:12:31] and there is no none
[1:12:34] else and there is none like
[1:12:37] me verse 10
[1:12:46] now declaring the end from the beginning
[1:12:49] and from ancient times the things that
[1:12:51] are not yet done now notice
[1:12:58] this saying my counsel shall
[1:13:03] stand and I will do all my
[1:13:05] pleasure so God is tremendous
[1:13:08] amen it says my counsel my plan my
[1:13:14] thinking shall
[1:13:16] endure and I will be or I will do all my
[1:13:20] pleasure because he's
[1:13:22] God he can do whatever he wants
[1:13:27] amen let him do whatever he wants with
[1:13:33] us the counsel of his
[1:13:36] will the mystery of his
[1:13:40] will my counsel shall
[1:13:43] endure and I will do all my
[1:13:47] pleasure says calling a ravenous bird
[1:13:50] from the
[1:13:52] East
[1:13:54] the man that executed my counsel from a
[1:13:56] far
[1:13:59] country so now the
[1:14:01] Lord in his
[1:14:03] thinking he called the
[1:14:06] man from a far contr he
[1:14:09] called because it was the purpose of his
[1:14:13] will he called every one of
[1:14:15] you some from from
[1:14:19] Chihuahua from wherever you
[1:14:22] were but he called you from a far
[1:14:25] country because he had a counsel he had
[1:14:29] a
[1:14:31] thought there is a mystery in his
[1:14:35] will and no one knows the mystery of his
[1:14:39] will how God called this
[1:14:41] person and now this person doesn't want
[1:14:44] anything to
[1:14:45] do but the word
[1:14:52] says
[1:14:54] and says the man that executed my
[1:14:55] counsel from a far
[1:14:57] country yay I have spoken it and also
[1:15:01] will also bring it to pass I have
[1:15:04] purposed
[1:15:05] it I will also do
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:10] it God's word is so beautiful
[1:15:12] amen his
[1:15:15] counsel says yay I have spoken he spoke
[1:15:19] to
[1:15:19] us because none comes onto the father
[1:15:23] but first the the the father calls you
[1:15:26] first you never saw
[1:15:29] God is God seeking
[1:15:32] you our nature runs away from God from
[1:15:37] the word from the right
[1:15:41] things and when God calls us he spoke to
[1:15:45] us and then it
[1:15:47] says and I will bring it to
[1:15:51] pass sometimes we don't want to come
[1:15:55] but God will make us
[1:15:57] come because we're his
[1:15:59] children you don't want to be
[1:16:04] here by our own nature we don't want to
[1:16:06] be here but our soul wants to be
[1:16:12] here says y I have purposed
[1:16:16] it I will also do
[1:16:19] it God's counsel is so beautiful amen
[1:16:23] let's go to the Book of
[1:16:26] Daniel chter 4 verse
[1:16:31] 35 here we can see that there's a
[1:16:33] tremendous
[1:16:36] story A King by the name of
[1:16:40] Nebuchadnezzar a tremendous
[1:16:44] man and he had a prophet with him by the
[1:16:46] name of
[1:16:50] Daniel so one morning this King he rose
[1:16:53] was up in the
[1:16:54] morning he went to get his cup of
[1:16:57] coffee he brushed his
[1:17:02] teeth so opening the big doors of his
[1:17:06] bedroom he saw his entire
[1:17:10] Kingdom he had his black coffee in his
[1:17:13] hand he says he says what what a great
[1:17:17] king I
[1:17:18] am what a great Kingdom I
[1:17:21] have he took a sip of
[1:17:26] coffee and then a curse
[1:17:31] came he became like a beast of the
[1:17:37] field he was there eating off of the off
[1:17:40] of the field like a
[1:17:43] beast amen
[1:17:46] brothers and then time
[1:17:51] passed to that spirit of the Beast or
[1:17:53] that cursed came off of
[1:17:55] him so now he came back to his right
[1:17:58] mind he got
[1:18:01] up now let's read what this King
[1:18:04] said verse
[1:18:21] 35
[1:18:27] and all the inhabitants of the Earth are
[1:18:29] reputed as nothing and he doeth
[1:18:31] according to his will in the army of
[1:18:33] heaven and among the inhabitants of the
[1:18:35] earth and none can stay his hand or say
[1:18:38] unto him what do thou doest
[1:18:43] thou so now this King had a
[1:18:46] revelation he says I'm barely
[1:18:50] recognizing that the Lord is the Lord
[1:18:51] over over everyone
[1:18:54] no
[1:18:55] one no one can stay his
[1:18:58] hand he does and
[1:19:01] undo he moves and then removes he places
[1:19:05] he heals he does everything he
[1:19:09] God he sends the plagues he removes the
[1:19:13] plagues he does
[1:19:16] everything this
[1:19:17] King
[1:19:19] realized that he was not King he real
[1:19:23] that he was a
[1:19:26] worm he thought he was the greatest King
[1:19:29] in all the
[1:19:31] Earth but God humiliated him such a
[1:19:34] humble
[1:19:35] way he made him as a beast of the
[1:19:39] field and God said I am
[1:19:41] King you're not
[1:19:44] King I am
[1:19:46] King and then he
[1:19:49] realized Sayes none can say his hands
[1:19:52] and say unto
[1:19:54] God what what doest
[1:20:00] thou have you have you ever asked God
[1:20:03] one time what are you
[1:20:06] doing why is this
[1:20:08] happening why is this happening to me
[1:20:11] what are you doing what are you
[1:20:14] doing it's the
[1:20:16] mystery of his
[1:20:19] will the
[1:20:21] counsel of his will
[1:20:24] am amen
[1:20:30] brothers let's go to the book of
[1:20:33] Acts you love the
[1:20:42] Lord we can see in the book of Acts
[1:20:44] chapter
[1:20:46] 10 that there was a
[1:20:49] man whose name was
[1:20:51] Cornelius
[1:20:53] this man was a
[1:20:55] centurion a Godly
[1:20:57] Man fearful of
[1:21:01] God the tremendous thing it wasn't just
[1:21:05] him but it was all of his
[1:21:10] household that's what we desire is that
[1:21:14] right I don't want to be the only one
[1:21:16] that's Godly and fearful of
[1:21:18] God I want my entire
[1:21:21] household now this
[1:21:25] man we can preach series of messages
[1:21:28] about this
[1:21:29] subject with that same
[1:21:32] phrase Godly and fearful of
[1:21:36] God with all of his
[1:21:38] household amen
[1:21:43] brothers that did gave a lot of arms to
[1:21:46] his
[1:21:48] people and would always pray to
[1:21:51] God so we saw that this man was always
[1:21:59] praying if we can say like this this man
[1:22:01] had his house in
[1:22:04] order then we see that he had a
[1:22:07] vision an angel came and spoke to
[1:22:11] him how we also want that God speaks to
[1:22:14] us we want God to speak to us but we
[1:22:18] must pray
[1:22:21] always and to be right with
[1:22:24] God so that God then can speak to
[1:22:29] us he had a vision an angel spoke to
[1:22:34] him says go have Peter come to
[1:22:40] you not only did the angel tell him who
[1:22:42] he
[1:22:45] was the angel also said where he
[1:22:50] lived he says he loded just with one
[1:22:53] Simon a
[1:22:56] Tanner he says whose house is by the
[1:23:00] seaside because God never messes up he
[1:23:03] never
[1:23:04] fails he always hits the
[1:23:07] target that's why brother
[1:23:09] brandom when the uh anointing would come
[1:23:12] upon him the angel right next to
[1:23:15] him it it would say you live in such a
[1:23:18] place your address is this and this is
[1:23:22] that true
[1:23:23] and now this
[1:23:25] Angel gave Peter's
[1:23:28] address he says he lives with
[1:23:31] this by in a house by the
[1:23:35] seaside and then
[1:23:37] Peter in that same time
[1:23:40] frame he had an
[1:23:42] ecstasy that's what the Bible
[1:23:45] says so the Bible says that he he was in
[1:23:48] a trance and he he was uh
[1:23:51] fasting so he saw a curtain or a
[1:23:56] sheet with the four points that were
[1:24:00] hanging how do you say that word
[1:24:04] quadros he saw uh four-footed
[1:24:08] Beast
[1:24:10] reptiles and birds of the of the
[1:24:14] sky what a strange Vision he had he saw
[1:24:18] a
[1:24:19] curtain the Four Corners were hanging
[1:24:28] imagine when we grab a credit and then I
[1:24:29] have two sides brother Lis has the other
[1:24:31] two
[1:24:32] sides so in that
[1:24:35] curtain there was animals there was
[1:24:38] lions
[1:24:40] tigers a little kitten there was
[1:24:43] reptiles there was
[1:24:45] iguanas is that right there was
[1:24:48] everything there was Birds
[1:24:51] there and and the voice said unto Peter
[1:24:54] it says
[1:24:56] arise says Peter kill and
[1:24:59] eat but Peter said Lord no not
[1:25:06] so no one can tell him what to what to
[1:25:09] do he said
[1:25:13] no brother Ram says that Peter being a
[1:25:16] Jew he had such a a strict
[1:25:20] lifestyle and Peter said not so
[1:25:26] Lord for I have never eaten anything
[1:25:28] that is common or
[1:25:32] unclean and the voice spake unto him
[1:25:34] again the second
[1:25:36] time says what God hath
[1:25:39] cleansed that can not call thou
[1:25:44] uncommon it's the Myster of his
[1:25:48] will no one can say to the Lord what are
[1:25:51] you doing
[1:25:56] so then the voice spoke to him a third
[1:25:59] time because every
[1:26:01] Vision has to be
[1:26:04] perfect so when those men
[1:26:07] came and took Peter to
[1:26:10] Cornelius because
[1:26:12] Peter had the
[1:26:16] germ just like Philip had the
[1:26:21] germ
[1:26:23] the angel couldn't be the one that went
[1:26:25] to
[1:26:28] Cornelius oh the the angel couldn't go
[1:26:31] to the Ethiopian man it had to be
[1:26:34] Phillip it had to be a
[1:26:41] man so when Peter knocked at cornelius's
[1:26:48] house I hope that you're following
[1:26:51] me Peter's a
[1:26:54] Jew Cornelius was a
[1:26:58] gentile the Jews and Gentiles would not
[1:27:02] intermingle there was no kind of
[1:27:04] discussion there was
[1:27:09] racism that's when when Jesus went with
[1:27:11] the Samaritan
[1:27:12] woman and Jesus said to the Samaritan
[1:27:16] give me to
[1:27:17] drink and the Samaritan woman was
[1:27:21] shocked
[1:27:23] he says because you and I we don't speak
[1:27:26] there's
[1:27:27] difference there's racism between Jews
[1:27:31] Gentiles and
[1:27:35] Samaritans it's the mystery of his
[1:27:40] will and when Jesus commissioned his
[1:27:44] disciples he sent them first to the
[1:27:47] Jews not to the
[1:27:50] Gentiles not to the Samaritan
[1:27:53] only to the
[1:27:55] Jews because Jesus came to his
[1:27:57] own he came to the
[1:28:00] Jews and the Jews rejected him and they
[1:28:03] crucified him and
[1:28:06] said that his
[1:28:09] blood let it be upon us and our
[1:28:13] children imagine when you kill
[1:28:16] someone the blood is on your hands and
[1:28:19] now those
[1:28:20] Jews let's said that let his blood be
[1:28:24] upon
[1:28:26] us and the tremendous thing they said is
[1:28:29] and also upon our
[1:28:31] children they didn't know what they said
[1:28:34] they they rejected and crucified
[1:28:39] him so so then he got
[1:28:42] up and now we're here at this
[1:28:45] setting and now
[1:28:47] Cornelius looking at
[1:28:50] Peter he fell down at Peter's feet and
[1:28:54] began to worship
[1:28:55] Him and Peter says
[1:28:58] arise I am also a
[1:29:04] man now the scripture says that there
[1:29:06] was many there in the
[1:29:08] household there was many
[1:29:11] Gentiles in Acts
[1:29:16] 10:28 Peter says this unto the
[1:29:19] Gentiles to cornelius's house
[1:29:31] says you know how that it is an an
[1:29:33] unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew
[1:29:35] to keep company or come onto one of
[1:29:38] another
[1:29:42] Nation so here he says in Spanish uh
[1:29:45] that's something that is an
[1:29:46] Abomination it's not something that's
[1:29:49] pretty it's something horrible that a
[1:29:53] Jew would uh have keep
[1:29:56] company or to draw
[1:29:58] close to one that is of another Nation a
[1:30:04] gentile now notice what the Bible
[1:30:08] says but God has showed
[1:30:11] me that that I should call not any man
[1:30:16] common or
[1:30:19] unclean so when he saw that vision
[1:30:25] with that sheet that had a lot of beasts
[1:30:27] in that
[1:30:28] sheet he says uh kill and
[1:30:32] eat he said Lord I can't kill I can't
[1:30:35] eat something that is
[1:30:37] unclean whatever God is
[1:30:39] clean don't call it
[1:30:45] common because when he died and was
[1:30:47] crucified at calvary's
[1:30:49] Cross it was not only for the Jews
[1:30:53] it was for the entire
[1:30:56] world because when the temple was there
[1:30:59] and the curtain was
[1:31:01] there the Bible and the prophet
[1:31:04] says that the veil was
[1:31:06] rent from up to
[1:31:10] down from top to
[1:31:13] bottom not from bottom to
[1:31:16] top but from top to
[1:31:18] bottom the
[1:31:20] Gentiles we
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:23] had no parts with
[1:31:27] this had nothing to do with
[1:31:29] it that's why Peter said it's an
[1:31:33] unlawful thing a Jew like
[1:31:37] me to keep company with this house of
[1:31:40] Gentiles but he said but God has showed
[1:31:45] me that no
[1:31:47] man or is common or unclean every
[1:31:50] man has the chance to get the Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] Every Man Has the chance to draw close
[1:31:59] to God not only the
[1:32:02] Jews it was the Revelation that came to
[1:32:06] Peter and Peter said how tremendous is
[1:32:09] this because I saw the
[1:32:13] father reject a serici
[1:32:17] women do you remember that
[1:32:20] scripture he called called her a dog and
[1:32:24] now I'm at the house of the
[1:32:28] Gentiles and God said to me whatever God
[1:32:33] has cleansed don't call it common so
[1:32:38] now every one of
[1:32:40] us are
[1:32:43] cleansed it's
[1:32:46] us that we call ourselves
[1:32:49] filthy but God
[1:32:56] us
[1:33:00] 10:34 then Peter opened his mouth he now
[1:33:03] started
[1:33:05] preaching and said of a truth I
[1:33:11] perceive that God is no respector of
[1:33:14] persons it doesn't matter
[1:33:17] then if your father's a pastor or not it
[1:33:20] doesn't matter
[1:33:23] if you come from a line of
[1:33:27] drunks if you come from the line of the
[1:33:29] message or not God is no
[1:33:34] respector of
[1:33:39] persons it doesn't matter what your last
[1:33:41] name is who you are where you came from
[1:33:46] what you've done or what you have not
[1:33:49] done God is no respector
[1:33:52] person I can imagine then Peter there
[1:33:55] with his eyes being
[1:33:57] open
[1:33:59] shocked then he began to
[1:34:03] preach the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:34:07] Gentiles because when he was there on
[1:34:08] the day of Pentecost he said go
[1:34:14] and until you're ued with
[1:34:17] power he didn't say until
[1:34:20] when but when they were there in the
[1:34:22] upper
[1:34:23] room the Virgin Mary was
[1:34:26] there she was also
[1:34:30] there but brother Bram says when they
[1:34:32] got into one
[1:34:35] Accord when they got in one
[1:34:38] Accord they put the doctrinal points to
[1:34:41] one
[1:34:42] side and they got in one
[1:34:46] Accord then they began to make things
[1:34:49] right then the Holy Ghost fell
[1:34:53] upon the
[1:34:55] Jews they were as
[1:34:57] drunkards because
[1:35:00] Peter had the keys to the
[1:35:02] kingdom and he
[1:35:05] preached he Christ whom ye have
[1:35:09] crucified is God has made him Christ and
[1:35:12] Lord now what can we do
[1:35:15] repent and be
[1:35:18] baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:35:20] Christ for forgiveness of
[1:35:23] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:35:26] the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost that was a promise for the
[1:35:31] Jews because Peter had the keys to the
[1:35:34] kingdom but for the
[1:35:37] Gentiles it wasn't still set in motion
[1:35:41] yet because the Jews were still
[1:35:44] thinking it's only it's only for
[1:35:47] us but it's not for the
[1:35:50] Gentiles
[1:35:52] so when then Peter started to preach and
[1:35:54] the and the
[1:35:56] Gentiles began to worship
[1:35:59] God the spirit began to come
[1:36:02] in the spirit fell on
[1:36:05] Cornelius and upon everyone that was in
[1:36:07] the
[1:36:08] household they got baptized were
[1:36:11] baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:36:14] Christ not in the name of Father Son and
[1:36:17] Holy Ghost because there Peter the
[1:36:20] prophet says
[1:36:22] he had the Keys of the
[1:36:24] Kingdom and he only used it for the Jews
[1:36:27] and he used it for the
[1:36:29] Gentiles he opened the
[1:36:31] kingdom he removed the
[1:36:34] lock for the
[1:36:35] Gentiles so that the
[1:36:38] Gentiles could
[1:36:40] access the kingdom of
[1:36:45] God that's what the prophet says we're
[1:36:47] going to read it amen amen Brothers
[1:36:52] and then we
[1:36:55] see so when Peter had ended that Revival
[1:36:59] and then he
[1:37:02] left and then the Jews got close to
[1:37:06] Peter they were hoping to have a meeting
[1:37:09] with
[1:37:11] him and in
[1:37:18] 10:45 it says and they of the
[1:37:20] circumcision which believed were
[1:37:22] astonished and many as came with
[1:37:28] Peter because they still believed that
[1:37:30] they had to circumcise the flesh but
[1:37:33] then Paul then
[1:37:34] came he says it's of the
[1:37:38] heart it's a change of
[1:37:42] dispensation so those in the ancient
[1:37:46] times they it says they came unto Peter
[1:37:49] and were astonished
[1:37:52] because that on the
[1:37:55] Gentiles also was poured out the gift of
[1:37:58] the Holy
[1:37:59] Ghost the Jews were unable to
[1:38:02] understand because they had no
[1:38:05] parts it was only the
[1:38:10] Jews and Peter said just take it up with
[1:38:13] him no one can say to God what doest
[1:38:18] thou it's the mystery of his will
[1:38:23] why did God send
[1:38:25] Peter because Peter held the keys to the
[1:38:31] kingdom brother Bram
[1:38:35] says this is just can put
[1:38:38] it he says now did you
[1:38:43] notice Jesus never done that to a
[1:38:46] gentile nor in presence of a
[1:38:50] gentile
[1:38:52] because he forbid his disciples to go to
[1:38:54] the
[1:38:58] Gentiles and when the serici woman said
[1:39:01] to him come have mercy on my
[1:39:07] daughter he said it's not mean for me to
[1:39:09] take the children's bread and cast it
[1:39:11] unto the
[1:39:13] dogs so then the Lord called her a dog
[1:39:16] that's very strong but the
[1:39:20] Gentiles because the bread was not for
[1:39:22] the Gentiles it was for the
[1:39:25] Jews so then she
[1:39:27] understood she said yes
[1:39:30] Lord yeah I know that's
[1:39:34] true but the dogs eat the
[1:39:39] crumbs she uh he said that's great
[1:39:42] faith if you believed it that way go
[1:39:46] find it the same
[1:39:47] way that's all he said to her now notice
[1:39:53] no vision for
[1:39:56] her he let her own faith do
[1:39:59] it
[1:40:04] okay the son doeth
[1:40:07] nothing until the fir until he first
[1:40:09] sees the father do it is that
[1:40:13] true so in other
[1:40:15] words he first has to see a
[1:40:18] vision and then it happens
[1:40:21] because he won't do anything if
[1:40:26] first the father tells him what he must
[1:40:29] do when it was with
[1:40:31] Lazarus why did Lazarus
[1:40:34] ra because the prophet
[1:40:37] said he had a
[1:40:39] vision that Lazarus would
[1:40:43] rais then he had the
[1:40:46] authority he said Lazarus come
[1:40:49] forth but this
[1:40:52] woman there was no vision that was for
[1:40:55] her it was merely her
[1:40:58] faith that reached Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ The Vision was not for her but
[1:41:04] her
[1:41:06] faith got in either way in other words
[1:41:11] she said
[1:41:12] Lord she said I know that I'm not
[1:41:15] worthy I know that you're not coming for
[1:41:17] me but either way I'm coming in
[1:41:21] because I have faith that you will heal
[1:41:24] my
[1:41:25] daughter there was the
[1:41:27] vision and she got in them by her
[1:41:31] faith when Jesus was going to the house
[1:41:34] of
[1:41:35] gyrus why was he going to the house of
[1:41:37] gyrus because his daughter was dead but
[1:41:41] Jesus had the
[1:41:43] vision that she was going to
[1:41:46] raise that's why he
[1:41:49] went but the woman with the blood
[1:41:51] issue there was no vision for
[1:41:54] her she was not in the plan but her with
[1:41:58] her
[1:41:59] faith with her
[1:42:01] knees she started crawling on her
[1:42:04] knees she said I know there's no vision
[1:42:06] for
[1:42:07] me I know that I'm not in the
[1:42:10] plan but I have a
[1:42:12] problem and I need
[1:42:15] healing and her with her knees she
[1:42:18] started
[1:42:19] crawling and she touched the Hem of the
[1:42:22] Garment of the Lord and she was
[1:42:25] healed he said virtue has left
[1:42:28] me she was not in the
[1:42:31] plan but with her faith she came
[1:42:41] in in Galatians
[1:42:46] 3:26 says by all are children of God by
[1:42:49] faith in Christ Jesus
[1:42:51] there is no more Jew nor
[1:42:54] Greek neither Bor or
[1:42:56] free there is neither male nor
[1:43:01] female for ye are all one in Christ
[1:43:05] Jesus Colossians
[1:43:15] 1:26 even the mystery which had been hid
[1:43:17] from ages and from Generations but now
[1:43:20] is made man to his
[1:43:22] Saints a a mystery that has been
[1:43:25] hid the mystery of his
[1:43:38] will now verse 27 to whom God would make
[1:43:41] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:43:44] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:43:47] Christ in you the hope of glory amen
[1:43:51] R Romans
[1:43:57] 9 Romans
[1:44:03] 9:14 what shall we say then is there
[1:44:06] unrighteousness with
[1:44:08] God what if I
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:12] say that God answered her prayer but not
[1:44:16] yours is there any unrighteousness with
[1:44:19] God
[1:44:23] let's say that God blessed your brother
[1:44:25] but not
[1:44:26] you is God
[1:44:30] unfair the Apostle Paul answerers says
[1:44:33] God
[1:44:35] forbid what I understand with God
[1:44:41] forbid that neither this way or this way
[1:44:44] or no
[1:44:45] way God is Not
[1:44:48] unfair he's perfect
[1:44:52] says for he saith to
[1:44:55] Moses I will have mercy on whom I will
[1:44:57] have
[1:44:59] mercy and will have compassion on whom I
[1:45:02] will have
[1:45:07] compassion so then it is not of him that
[1:45:10] willth nor of him that
[1:45:11] runthe
[1:45:13] Mercy for the scripture saith unto
[1:45:18] Pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[1:45:20] I raised thee
[1:45:22] up so who raised up Pharaoh God did God
[1:45:27] raised
[1:45:28] Pharaoh from the womb of his
[1:45:30] mother he raised up
[1:45:33] Pharaoh just like he raised up
[1:45:36] Moses and took care of him when he was
[1:45:38] in the river with all the crocodiles
[1:45:41] that were there he took also care of
[1:45:44] pharaoh just like that little
[1:45:47] fish that swallowed the prophet Jon
[1:45:52] the Bible
[1:45:53] says that God
[1:45:55] prepared that that
[1:45:58] fish that's very
[1:46:01] tremendous
[1:46:02] God spent his
[1:46:05] time in
[1:46:07] thinking in a little fish he shaped him
[1:46:11] he designed
[1:46:13] him in a very special
[1:46:16] way we're talking about a little
[1:46:19] fish and when this little fish was born
[1:46:22] his little siblings his little
[1:46:25] cousins it says you're so
[1:46:28] tiny you're H you're not going to amount
[1:46:31] to
[1:46:33] anything you're the slowest of all of us
[1:46:36] here but
[1:46:38] God it says that God
[1:46:41] prepared this little
[1:46:44] fish for a very special
[1:46:48] work he began to feed the fish he began
[1:46:52] to grow and he began to
[1:46:55] grow he went from being the
[1:46:58] tiniest he became a big
[1:47:01] whale and he
[1:47:03] swallowed the prophet Jonah and if God
[1:47:08] could
[1:47:08] think could
[1:47:10] prepare a little
[1:47:12] fish what about you
[1:47:15] them God thinks about you God prepares
[1:47:19] you for a very special work so that
[1:47:24] you can have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:47:29] hearts God prepared
[1:47:31] you maybe for the entire
[1:47:33] world you're nothing special for but for
[1:47:37] God God thought about
[1:47:41] you he had you in the thinking of his
[1:47:44] will he had the mystery of his
[1:47:47] will and that mystery of his will it was
[1:47:52] you because no one
[1:47:55] knows whom God
[1:47:58] chooses that's why it's the mystery of
[1:48:00] his
[1:48:03] will No One Ever
[1:48:05] Knows who is and who
[1:48:09] isn't that's why it's the mystery of his
[1:48:12] will but
[1:48:14] you God thought on
[1:48:16] you God prepared you for today
[1:48:21] for you to have the Holy
[1:48:32] Ghost verse 18 therefore he had mercy on
[1:48:35] whom he will have mercy and whom he will
[1:48:38] harden
[1:48:40] it so we see that God does whatever he
[1:48:44] pleases thou will say then unto me
[1:48:49] why
[1:48:53] sometimes we reply to God and say why
[1:48:56] Lord why this and this and
[1:49:00] this says who are thou oh
[1:49:08] man for who haveth resisted
[1:49:13] god let's read it again verse
[1:49:16] 20 says
[1:49:19] why says why do you say it on me why
[1:49:23] Lord why am I sick why this my children
[1:49:29] my
[1:49:29] daughter this and that why
[1:49:34] Lord who art
[1:49:39] thou that repliest against
[1:49:45] God shall the thing form say to him that
[1:49:48] formed it
[1:49:50] why H has Thou made me
[1:49:54] thus why did you make me this way
[1:50:00] Lord can can the clay say to the
[1:50:03] Potter change me I don't want to be like
[1:50:13] this have not the Potter power over the
[1:50:18] clay of the same LP to make now
[1:50:22] notice the same
[1:50:26] lump to make one vessel onto honor and
[1:50:29] another onto
[1:50:30] dishonor now notice what verse 22 says
[1:50:34] what
[1:50:36] if it's more tremendous in Spanish it
[1:50:39] says and it says
[1:50:41] what what
[1:50:44] if God willing to show his
[1:50:48] wrath and to make his power
[1:50:52] known endured with long suffering the
[1:50:55] vessels of
[1:50:57] Wrath fitted to
[1:51:00] destruction now notice if you can please
[1:51:05] stand and that he make known The Riches
[1:51:08] of his
[1:51:12] glory
[1:51:14] how it's the mystery of his
[1:51:18] will it says
[1:51:21] we read in
[1:51:26] Colossians where it says to whom God
[1:51:28] wanted to make known The Riches of his
[1:51:30] glory this
[1:51:33] mystery among the
[1:51:35] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:51:40] of glory okay now notice now verse
[1:51:46] 23 and that he might make known the
[1:51:49] riches of his
[1:51:53] glory he says he showed them on the
[1:51:55] vessels of
[1:51:57] Mercy which he had
[1:51:59] aord prepared unto
[1:52:04] Glory vessels of
[1:52:06] Mercy who are his vessels of Mercy
[1:52:09] that's
[1:52:12] you he showed his
[1:52:16] Mercy there was no chance that we had
[1:52:21] there was that woman there she said Son
[1:52:23] of David my daughter is demon
[1:52:30] possessed he said it's not good to give
[1:52:32] the children's me bread to the to the
[1:52:35] dogs and now he changed her title she
[1:52:39] said oh

[1:52:43] us he is
[1:52:45] Lord he is our
[1:52:48] Lord
[1:52:51] he showed
[1:52:52] Mercy to that young
[1:52:55] woman
[1:52:57] Mercy he's
[1:53:00] rich in
[1:53:07] Mercy because
[1:53:09] God who is rich in
[1:53:12] Mercy where with his great
[1:53:15] love that he loved
[1:53:18] us
[1:53:21] even while we were yet dead in

[1:54:09] will none knows
[1:54:12] it because none can say he's saved and
[1:54:17] this one isn't he is saved and this one
[1:54:20] isn't it's a
[1:54:25] mystery it's a
[1:54:28] mystery that's why Peter
