[1:52] this message God doesn't call him into
[1:54] to judgment without first warning him by
[1:57] Brother William Marian branam was was
[1:59] delivered Wednesday evening July 24th
[2:02] 1963 at the Branham Tabernacle in
[2:05] Jeffersonville Indiana
[2:25] USA Bram the Jeffersonville
[2:28] Indiana the North
[2:31] America
[2:32] now my uh sight falls upon a texture of
[2:37] Isaiah Isaiah
[2:42] 38 let's read over to
[2:46] Isaiah Isaiah
[2:58] 38
[3:00] in those days was Hezekiah sick unto
[3:05] death and Isaiah the prophet the son of
[3:09] Amos came unto him and said unto him
[3:13] thus sayeth the
[3:15] Lord set thine house in order for Thou
[3:18] shalt die and not
[3:28] live
[3:38] then Hezekiah turned his face towards
[3:40] the wall and prayed unto the Lord and
[3:43] said Remember Me Oh Lord I beseech Thee
[3:47] I have walked before thee in truth and
[3:50] with a perfect heart and have done that
[3:53] which is good in thy sight and e ezekiah
[3:58] wept sore
[4:23] then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah
[4:25] saying go and say to Hezekiah thus
[4:28] sayeth the Lord the god of David thy
[4:31] father I've heard thy prayer I have seen
[4:35] thy tears behold I will add unto thy
[4:38] days 15
[4:58] years may the Lord add His blessings to
[5:02] this reading it's a
[5:06] very um
[5:08] outstanding uh subject for a short
[5:11] message here I believe I want to call it
[5:15] God doesn't call man to judgment without
[5:18] first
[5:28] warning
[5:35] and we are we we C the the background or
[5:39] the platform of it here and this text
[5:41] tonight God warning man before bringing
[5:45] him to uh his
[5:58] death
[6:03] now
[6:05] everyone has this we might say well this
[6:08] fell died without a warning no no no God
[6:12] never you don't know what was in that
[6:13] man's heart you don't know what's been
[6:15] going on in his life see God never
[6:17] brings any man to his death without
[6:19] first warning him about it telling him
[6:21] it's something a
[6:28] preparation
[6:47] God is is Sovereign and he he knocks at
[6:51] the heart of every man giving him the
[6:54] opportunity to
[6:58] come
[7:04] now he might War it away and turn it
[7:06] down and and shake his head to it and
[7:08] walk away so it's just a funny feeling
[7:10] I'll get over it but anyhow it was God
[7:14] God speaking to him
[7:28] amen
[7:34] and God never even brings judgment upon
[7:38] the Earth without first giving the
[7:39] people a
[7:40] warning God never does nothing without
[7:43] declaring it first what he's going to
[7:56] do and he gives people a choice and you
[7:59] can you can do right or wrong that's his
[8:02] see God can never
[8:04] change his nature his program can never
[8:07] change from what he started with because
[8:10] he's infinite in his program and his
[8:12] ideas are all
[8:28] perfect
[8:35] so if he would change it that would show
[8:37] that he'd learn more so being infinite
[8:39] he cannot learn more his his first his
[8:43] first decision is always perfect and
[8:45] there nothing can ever change
[8:58] it
[9:03] God before man ever was put had a chance
[9:07] to do wrong God put him on the basis to
[9:10] where he could accept or deny he could
[9:13] receive or
[9:27] not say by the way if that minister in
[9:30] here brother Baker uh I believe was on
[9:34] the the interviews the other day I've
[9:36] got his questions that he had wrote out
[9:38] for me on the serpent seed I got him
[9:41] laying back here
[9:54] now if he's sure well well I don't see
[9:57] him anywhere right the present time but
[9:59] and Sh he and his wife a very fine man
[10:03] and and a woman but they they couldn't
[10:06] understand a few things about the
[10:08] teaching of the Serpent's
[10:25] Seed how that that some questions about
[10:28] what I said in in sermons beyond that
[10:31] and and talking about the the pregnation
[10:35] and so forth but I um then it's just
[10:38] like a a brother fine man just a
[10:41] Christian for a couple years or two but
[10:43] just didn't understand you
[10:58] see
[11:05] it's hard if you don't you have to
[11:07] depend on the holy spirit because this
[11:09] Bible is wrote and riddles you just
[11:11] can't sit down and read like a newspaper
[11:14] it's head
[11:27] yes
[11:30] how would you ever justify God when he
[11:32] told Moses uh up there said now don't
[11:36] you make any engraving images in his
[11:38] Commandments don't you make anything
[11:40] like heaven any any angel or anything
[11:42] else don't make any engraving images And
[11:45] yet on the same day he told him to mold
[11:47] two angels out of brass and put them
[11:50] right at the mercy seat where Mercy's
[11:57] at
[12:25] you have to know God in his nature
[12:27] before you can understand his word he he
[12:30] he has the key to that word himself amen
[12:33] and he he's the only one can can handle
[12:35] it open it and so he's the one has to
[12:39] reveal
[12:55] it and now we find out that is
[12:59] naturewise here that always to warn a
[13:03] man uh before judgment to warn a nation
[13:06] before judgment and so
[13:19] forth he always gives his warning a
[13:22] reminder to we of a
[13:27] responsibility we are
[13:29] responsible amen and God has put us her
[13:32] on the earth for a reason and that
[13:35] reason that he is Punisher for we are
[13:38] responsible to him for that reason you
[13:41] should go to him and find out what he
[13:43] wants you to
[13:57] do
[14:09] if you don't if you went to work for a
[14:11] man he give you a job on a ranch or
[14:13] something other and you just went out to
[14:14] the barn and just sat down out there and
[14:17] say well see you must go ask him what he
[14:20] wants you to do and then do it if you're
[14:23] working for a man find out what your
[14:25] duties
[14:27] is
[14:48] and then if our life is on the the Earth
[14:51] here then we should go to the one who
[14:53] punish her and Lord what would you have
[14:55] me do what what what must I do why am I
[15:13] here if it's to be a housewife
[15:16] dishwasher if it's to be whatever God
[15:18] wants you to do then you do that the
[15:20] very best that you know how to do it no
[15:22] matter how little no matter how little
[15:26] it is you must do it
[15:43] you say well the trouble of it is each
[15:45] one of us wants to do the next man's job
[15:47] we all want to pack the ball as we say
[15:50] you
[15:57] see
[16:02] like this watch here now every little
[16:05] movement in there has its
[16:07] place now every part of it can't be the
[16:11] hands now I only look at the hand to see
[16:13] what time it is but if one of them
[16:15] little wheels in there gets out of order
[16:18] that won't keep the right
[16:27] time
[16:40] that's the way it is with people we've
[16:42] all the body of Christ has got to be in
[16:45] their position and Harmony see and then
[16:49] we can look around and see what time of
[16:51] day it is
[16:57] see
[17:06] then the world's looking to see what it
[17:08] is see but they're watching you and if
[17:11] you're just a little hairspring main
[17:13] spring or whatever you are you do the
[17:17] very best job you can at
[17:27] that
[17:35] now because we have a responsibility
[17:38] that we've got to answer to God someday
[17:40] for every man that come on the face the
[17:43] Earth has to answer to God for our
[17:45] responsibility and to many of us a
[17:48] stewardship we have to answer
[17:57] for
[18:07] we this responsibility is a stewardship
[18:10] that's been committed to us by God I
[18:12] don't care what it is as I said a few
[18:14] must go a housewife then be a genuine
[18:17] housewife that's right if it's to be a
[18:20] farmer be a genuine
[18:27] farmer
[18:41] whatever it is that God has put you to
[18:43] do you got a stship to that you've got
[18:45] to answer to God for because it takes
[18:48] all these things to do
[18:57] it
[19:02] Hezekiah was told to make ready and to
[19:05] get ready because that he had to meet
[19:09] his maker ezekiah was a king and a great
[19:24] man you notice this plea here Lord I
[19:27] beseech you to consider me I I've walked
[19:29] before you with a perfect heart what a
[19:32] testimony that is to to us today it
[19:35] should be a man that walks before
[19:55] God even death was pronounced upon upon
[19:58] the man and yet God changed his mind
[20:00] about him amen because Hezekiah wanted
[20:05] to do something and God said he would
[20:06] give us the desires of our
[20:21] heart's time had come and he got a
[20:24] cancer on him or something other they
[20:26] call it a bar in that day but we know
[20:28] bars don't regularly kill you they just
[20:30] get well but it's perhaps a Cancer and
[20:33] it opened up like a bar
[20:52] and and God told Isaiah said go up there
[20:55] and tell him that he's going to die and
[20:57] hez had something he wanted to do
[21:07] yet yet yet when you plead anything to
[21:09] God you got to be a reason for it it's
[21:12] just like this scripture that is so
[21:14] often refer to if you say to this
[21:16] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[21:18] believe that what You' said will come to
[21:20] pass you can have what you said now
[21:22] that's all together controlled on motive
[21:25] and
[21:26] objective or it won't
[21:54] happen so you just can't go out here
[21:56] that's where many of us makes many
[21:58] mistakes is going on say now I'll show
[22:01] you I got faith to do this now you're
[22:03] wrong to begin with God don't give you
[22:06] gifts just to play with
[22:23] it as I was saying a while ago they
[22:26] don't show you Visions just to play with
[22:28] that's nothing to play with that's
[22:30] sacred just use it in as the Lord will
[22:33] let you be a prisoner to
[22:48] him no matter how much you want to tell
[22:50] that guy is wrong and what this that or
[22:52] the other you hold still to God says so
[22:55] then when God says so then you can come
[22:57] with thus say the Lord and tell that
[22:59] just forget
[23:17] about the the world today just like
[23:20] Hezekiah was then it's been
[23:23] warned it's constantly being warned the
[23:26] church is being warned
[23:28] and now these things just don't happen
[23:30] by uh by chance they've all got
[23:34] something behind
[23:51] them now Hezekiah being sick having this
[23:56] bar that wasn't by chance God sent
[23:59] Isaiah up there and told him to set his
[24:01] house in order now because he's going to
[24:14] die Hezekiah wept and told God I walk
[24:18] before the perfect heart and I I pray
[24:21] you spare my life for a cause a good
[24:24] cause a cause of God God told the
[24:26] prophet said go back and tell him
[24:44] Now isn't that strange Hezekiah was the
[24:46] greatest man in the
[24:47] land Hezekiah was a king and a godly
[24:51] man he was a real man if he could plead
[24:55] that before God and God didn't rebuke F
[24:58] I've walk before you with a perfect
[25:00] heart now that's a saying a whole
[25:24] lot and God never said no Hezekiah you
[25:27] didn't do it but he admitted he did do
[25:29] it and he said I'm going to I'm going to
[25:31] spare your life a little longer see I'm
[25:33] going to give you a request see because
[25:35] he had been a just man he had been a a
[25:38] real servant to
[25:56] Christ Lord and then we feel that we
[25:59] have a right to ask something if if our
[26:02] objective is right and then our motive
[26:04] to
[26:13] it now we see today that for the past
[26:18] many years I'd say for the past 15 to
[26:22] more years that constantly there's been
[26:25] a warning out Across the Nation amen
[26:28] repent our
[26:42] Parish you notice I was talking today to
[26:45] the wife just early this morning and I
[26:49] early at breakfast we were sitting at
[26:51] table talking before I
[26:56] left
[27:02] I said wife uh she's was talking about
[27:05] Billy Graham and about his wife just how
[27:09] common and everything they tried to live
[27:11] I said that is a real servant when he
[27:14] Tri
[27:24] not when a man maybe makes two or three
[27:26] million a year
[27:28] out in his campaigns but he doesn't
[27:30] receive it his foundation takes it
[27:32] placing it back into the work and the
[27:34] broadcast and so forth and Billy gets
[27:36] about
[27:50] 25,000 she said how would he ever spend
[27:53] 25,000 year I said he he takes just what
[27:56] he has to have that's all all he's got a
[27:57] home to pay for and everything and went
[28:00] on I said I've got lots of respects for
[28:02] Billy Graham I said because he has a
[28:05] message and that message is
[28:26] repentance
[28:28] and I I tell you there's nobody that I
[28:30] know of in the lands today that God has
[28:33] used for that message like Billy Graham
[28:35] oh he's got a down pat he just stands
[28:38] there and I mean he calls them
[28:40] politicians and church members to
[28:42] repentance but that's as far as he
[28:51] goes
[28:56] Billy
[29:03] and here comes brother or Roberts
[29:06] another great servant of the Lord and
[29:09] there's nobody comes out there and
[29:11] compare with or
[29:13] Roberts
[29:19] Roberts Roberts that Bulldog grip of if
[29:23] uh just casting out evil spirits and
[29:26] calling the name of of the Lord and and
[29:28] little Sensations and so forth that uh
[29:31] about Divine Healing that's exactly
[29:46] right there is a messenger to the
[29:48] Pentecost there is a messenger to the
[29:50] church denominational world see and the
[29:53] co world then look around at our own
[29:55] little humble Ministry standing Jesus
[29:58] Christ the same yesterday today and
[30:00] forever you
[30:20] see what's that doing calling that bride
[30:23] group you see Hallelujah it it calls
[30:27] from both those groups it's taking a
[30:29] wheel out of the wheel see what I mean
[30:44] Hallelujah and then God confirms that
[30:47] message that Billy Graham preaches God
[30:49] heals the Sick by or robers prayers and
[30:52] God produces the things that Jesus
[30:55] proved that Jesus Christ is the same
[30:56] yesterday forever and it's calling those
[30:59] sa it's messages of the
[31:03] hour Billy
[31:20] GRS and each one of those messages is
[31:23] calling repent our perish amen amen
[31:27] that's right repent or perish there's no
[31:31] hopes it's all gone worlds warned of his
[31:35] coming each one of the messages speaks
[31:37] and warns of the coming of the Lord
[31:40] Jesus both through the chur
[31:56] Church
[32:05] remember God's always in threes like
[32:08] Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[32:09] justification B and sanctification
[32:11] baptism the Holy Ghost so forth
[32:24] these now God is that message of
[32:26] repentance to the church nominal God's
[32:29] in that message of Divine Healing to the
[32:31] church Pentecostal God's in the message
[32:33] to the
[32:48] bride so we find out that all of them
[32:53] calling one to this this to that and
[32:55] that to that God calling the church out
[32:57] of the world the calling the church in
[33:01] the denominal church into Pentecost and
[33:04] calling the bride out of
[33:25] P
[33:30] like Luther Wesley and now see it just
[33:34] all perfectly typed up and there's no
[33:37] mistake about it I've hit all around the
[33:40] ends of it and sides of it inside and
[33:42] outside of it and showed it by the
[33:43] scripture and the chronology of it till
[33:45] we know that it's absolutely the
[33:50] truth
[33:55] Wesley
[34:09] there's no mistake Sunday I hope that
[34:12] God sinks it so deep that you'll never
[34:15] be able to get away from
[34:25] it now
[34:27] God giving
[34:29] warning prepare for a
[34:33] judgment the atomic bombs are in the
[34:35] hangers everything's setting ready and
[34:38] God before he can let this thing happen
[34:41] he makes a call down through like he did
[34:44] in Sodom come out of it get ready
[34:46] there's something going to
[34:55] happen
[35:08] like in the days of Noah before God sent
[35:12] the waters to destroy the world in the
[35:16] great Andel luian world that had come
[35:18] off into sin as Jesus clearly said that
[35:22] it was a day just like this as it was in
[35:25] the days of Noah so shall it be at the
[35:29] coming of the son of
[35:50] man how that uh the women on the Rampage
[35:54] and and marrying and giving and marriage
[35:56] marage and and the great scientific
[35:59] achievements and the smart educated
[36:02] going into the intellectual sides and
[36:04] the little humble flock sitting off to
[36:06] one side waiting the pending judgment
[36:09] and the
[36:25] Escape
[36:30] and before God sent that judgment he
[36:34] sent a
[36:36] prophet just like he did to Hezekiah
[36:39] said get ready for the judgments are
[36:41] ready to
[36:55] fall and and he made the people ready
[36:59] for the time
[37:01] Noah made the people ready and it was a
[37:05] call of Mercy before
[37:15] [Music]
[37:19] judgment was made to know before their
[37:22] time God looked down to Nineveh and he
[37:24] said I'm I'm just
[37:27] tired of these
[37:38] things I I understand that that great
[37:43] Heathen Gentile World their city as it
[37:46] was in them days they judg him by City
[37:48] not by Nations now at the population has
[37:52] spread the way it
[37:55] has
[38:09] he said that great city is give over all
[38:12] together to sin and God before he would
[38:16] send judgment he sent a warning
[38:20] message come out of it get right watch
[38:24] the prophet never set up
[38:28] but but to get said within 40 days this
[38:32] city will be
[38:55] destroyed
[38:57] D and oh how sometime it's hard to do
[39:02] such things as that to tell people if
[39:05] the prophet don't watch he'll get in
[39:07] trouble because he'll kind of go off to
[39:09] one side trying to make it easier
[39:11] compromise a little bit you're a little
[39:13] bit
[39:25] there
[39:31] but the real prophets got the order from
[39:34] God should never compromise
[39:36] nothing he should absolutely lay it
[39:39] right on the
[39:49] line that's the reason he use the spirit
[39:51] of Elijah so much see because that
[39:54] spirit always carried out his arm ERS
[39:56] you see it brought his AR just exactly
[40:00] what it was and always a come back to
[40:01] the word always a bring him back to the
[40:25] word now it's find Nineveh in sin and
[40:30] the prophet was hant because it was a
[40:32] gentile world see it's a gentile Nation
[40:35] gentile people not his own it wasn't
[40:38] Hebrews they were
[40:54] Gentiles the Great uh ship commercial
[40:58] sea port at Nineveh was great
[41:02] fishing industrial there the people
[41:05] fished
[41:12] and and they they had must have had a
[41:15] great sinful country there plenty of
[41:18] money and and more money is planful and
[41:20] people are in a popular opinion of the
[41:23] day sin always sets in and violence
[41:42] was tired of it so he had a prophet in
[41:45] the land so he said to his Prophet go
[41:48] down there to Nineveh and cry out and
[41:50] say within 40 days the city is going to
[41:52] be
[41:55] destroyed
[42:05] now Jonah thought now you know I might
[42:08] get in a little trouble so he wanted to
[42:10] be more sure so he thought he take a
[42:12] little vacation and and go down to
[42:25] tarus
[42:27] and we found out that the there's just
[42:30] 40 days
[42:31] left see so the message is urgent the
[42:36] time is at
[42:37] hand don't play around with other things
[42:40] and get a Bachelor of art degree and
[42:43] find out something the hour is at
[42:55] hand
[43:03] what's a matter people today we're
[43:04] trying to uh build up big schools and
[43:07] have big things like that when mercy why
[43:11] if we preach a coming of the Lord what
[43:12] do we need with schools we need
[43:15] repentance towards
[43:25] God
[43:36] like Hudson Taylor said to the young
[43:38] missionary he said a young Chinese boy
[43:40] come to him and said Mr Taylor said the
[43:43] Lord Jesus has filled me with his spirit
[43:46] said I I'm so happy said shall I take 10
[43:49] years now and get my degrees and so
[43:55] forth
[44:10] he said Son don't wait for degrees if
[44:12] the candle's lit Go Tell
[44:15] It Go Tell it don't wait for degrees no
[44:20] you'll be half burned out before you get
[44:21] on with your degrees let's when it's lit
[44:24] if you don't know nothing else just tell
[44:25] how
[44:47] live just don't try to take somebody
[44:49] else's place or something place when you
[44:51] know just tell what you know to be the
[44:52] truth This Is Where It come on me and
[44:54] this is how I feel about it that's you
[44:56] don't know no more than that say that
[44:59] let's go the message is urgent the time
[45:02] is at
[45:24] hand
[45:28] what if Isaiah say well now I'll wait
[45:30] and see how it gets along with that b
[45:31] first you see see I I see God told him
[45:34] go up there and tell him right
[45:49] now and he told Jonah to go oh my and
[45:54] when he got out there and that ocean and
[45:56] that deep sea and and the ship got
[46:00] stalled in a storm and that harshed up
[46:02] the sails and turned around around they
[46:04] wonder what the world was the matter out
[46:23] there but they couldn't make out look
[46:25] like the thing getting water loged and
[46:28] every man calling on his God and first
[46:30] thing you know Jonah was on his vacation
[46:32] so you thought he might as well sleep he
[46:34] must have went out the booke of the ship
[46:36] and laying up there his feet propped up
[46:54] asleep
[46:59] and he said awake oh Slugger and call
[47:01] upon your God and Jonah knew what was
[47:05] wrong so does every man
[47:08] know what's wrong
[47:24] today and he said it's all my fault take
[47:28] me and bind my hands and throw me out in
[47:30] the sea and then this trouble will let
[47:39] up and they were kind of gentl like
[47:42] bunch of fellas and they didn't want to
[47:44] do that but they found out he was a
[47:46] prophet know what he was talking
[47:54] about
[47:58] he said I thought I'd take my vacation
[48:00] first but but the Lord don't want me to
[48:02] take this vacation I got to get down
[48:04] there I got a job to do I thought I'd
[48:06] rested up a little bit before I went but
[48:08] I got to go the the message is urgent I
[48:10] got to get
[48:24] there
[48:31] I'd imagine when that certain prepared
[48:34] fish uh got Jonah down in his stomach he
[48:38] done a about face and throwed water all
[48:40] over the country and Tuck out for n of
[48:41] his hard as he could go God was taking
[48:44] that message over there that certain
[48:47] prepared
[48:54] fish
[49:04] and he took out for Nineveh just as hard
[49:06] as he could go because he he had the
[49:09] messenger board and he had to get him
[49:11] over there he took the wrong ship but
[49:13] God provided a ship for
[49:24] him
[49:29] so you know God's able to do great
[49:32] things if we just listen see he he'll
[49:34] make he'll make ways where there is no
[49:37] way he is the way see and when the
[49:40] message is absolutely urgent as it is
[49:43] today God provides a
[49:54] way
[50:05] we notice again when Amos I preached on
[50:08] this fellow Amos if you'd like to read
[50:10] the story sometime it's great read the
[50:12] story of Amos first chapter of Amos he's
[50:16] another type of the the warnings before
[50:20] judgment strikes
[50:22] [Music]
[50:24] sin
[50:42] now um the city that he was uh going to
[50:46] warn against over there was a bunch of
[50:48] Jews and that he all got kind of off of
[50:51] the beaten line and become a great
[50:54] tourist center and
[51:07] and I imagine as I give the illustration
[51:09] that morning speaking on him that when
[51:11] he bald head come up over the top of the
[51:14] hill and his little eyes narrowed as he
[51:16] looked down seen the sin of that great
[51:19] nation and people uh his white beard as
[51:23] he fingered it like that W what a
[51:45] thing but nobody knows where he come
[51:48] from nobody knows those prophets they
[51:51] just Rise Up from somewhere and go the
[51:53] same way but he went went into the city
[51:56] with thus sayith the
[51:59] Lord repent or perish for God will
[52:03] destroy this nation he'll he'll wipe
[52:06] this place off of the
[52:24] Earth
[52:27] you've made an agreement with your enemy
[52:30] and you're you're at peace you think
[52:32] with your enemy but all the time the
[52:33] Assyrians are are building up out there
[52:36] you can't walk to together unless you be
[52:39] agreed that's
[52:54] all
[53:00] so he God wants us to separate ourselves
[53:02] he wants us come out from the world not
[53:04] try to live with the world and God too
[53:06] not try to Fashion After the world after
[53:09] God you have to live for one or the
[53:11] other you have to believe one or the
[53:24] other
[53:33] now we find out that this Amos he
[53:36] certainly predicted a judgment upon this
[53:40] people except they repented and and M
[53:46] so so well does it fit
[53:54] our
[54:01] I think this great city as looking back
[54:04] to this again the great City down there
[54:06] high that is all give over and and a
[54:09] great uh economy they had of everything
[54:13] prosperous and they thought they were
[54:15] just exactly in the will of the Lord
[54:17] because they were
[54:24] prospering
[54:36] but they found out that God is not
[54:39] always the author of prosperity am no
[54:44] God sometimes when Prosperity strikes
[54:47] the church usually gets away from
[54:54] him
[55:00] you know God spoke of Israel one time
[55:01] said I found you blood in the field
[55:03] washed you up and brought you in to be
[55:06] his own child and then when he got big
[55:07] and a beautiful young woman you played
[55:09] the part of a he said you you just
[55:12] give yourself to every passer
[55:24] by
[55:36] for see but when you were poor and needy
[55:41] when when you had need you serve me but
[55:43] when I bless you and give you plenty
[55:45] then you went away from me and it's just
[55:48] about prove
[55:54] that
[56:05] oh my now we find out that this Prophet
[56:09] really struck down on that Nation this
[56:13] Amos just a plow boy but we find out
[56:17] that when he did struck down and told
[56:20] him what it would be and told him that
[56:23] they didn't get right with God that the
[56:26] enemy that they had taken in Partnership
[56:29] would be the very one that destroyed him
[56:53] oh now we find out that our proud
[56:58] America is not going to escape the wrath
[57:01] of God I spoke one day since I've been
[57:05] here I'm sure it was here uh of the
[57:08] everything at the
[57:20] end you know I I can't see nothing to
[57:22] build
[57:23] to you can't build a
[57:26] politics it's
[57:28] gone you you can't build uh to uh social
[57:33] life because it's so demoralized there's
[57:36] there there's nothing that you can build
[57:37] to
[57:38] there and uh you can't put no hopes or
[57:53] nothing
[58:04] how about the church well you can't do
[58:06] nothing with the church it's so farm and
[58:08] gone there's nothing left they've done
[58:11] sold out their birth rights for a mess
[58:13] of pottage and and they're just waiting
[58:23] judgment
[58:32] the Holy Spirit has cross this nation
[58:34] showing his signs and wonders they
[58:36] continually spurn his
[58:47] grace vindicates himself and proves by
[58:51] his great Vindication that he's a word
[58:54] of God God manifested in this day and
[58:56] they still turn it
[58:58] down there's nothing left now you just
[59:01] can't always do that to God
[59:20] see all right we find out the first he
[59:25] sends his prophets with
[59:27] warning he doesn't change his way his
[59:29] method of doing things he does not
[59:32] always strike when he
[59:46] warns I want you to watch this quotation
[59:49] God gives a warning but he don't always
[59:51] strike the same time he warns did you
[59:54] notice that
[1:00:04] amen and then when he doesn't strike
[1:00:06] when he sends a warning then the prophet
[1:00:08] is
[1:00:09] mocked you didn't have it you told a
[1:00:14] lie you you wasn't
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:30] this same thing might have been said to
[1:00:33] Isaiah what do you think that man
[1:00:35] thought when he went up there and
[1:00:36] prophesied the King was going to die
[1:00:38] then come back down said no he's going
[1:00:40] to
[1:00:53] live
[1:00:56] come we that love the Lord and let our
