[1:01:21] is
[1:01:22] if you have it is
[1:01:31] foreign
[1:01:37] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[1:01:40] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:01:42] and your sons and daughters shall
[1:01:43] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:01:46] your young men shall see visions
[1:01:52] and also upon the servants and upon the
[1:01:55] hands made in those days will I pour out
[1:01:56] my spirit
[1:02:02] and I will show wanders in the heavens
[1:02:04] and in the earth blood and fire and
[1:02:06] pillars of smoke oh let us pray our
[1:02:10] heavenly father
[1:02:12] glorios we thank you this glorious
[1:02:15] morning
[1:02:17] such a beautiful glorious morning that
[1:02:19] we have
[1:02:20] the opportunity
[1:02:24] you have granted us the opportunity to
[1:02:27] walk to this place again
[1:02:29] to hear your words
[1:02:37] there's many places that don't have a
[1:02:40] pasture
[1:02:43] they don't have a church
[1:02:46] but they get together at a house
[1:02:50] and there they honor the resurrection
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:55] but what a privilege that we have this
[1:02:58] morning
[1:02:59] Phoenix speaking locally here in the
[1:03:02] city of Phoenix
[1:03:04] where you give us the opportunity
[1:03:08] to fellowship with each other yes and to
[1:03:12] hear your word
[1:03:13] we're a blessed people
[1:03:17] so help us with everything this morning
[1:03:20] lead us in everything
[1:03:23] may we set aside
[1:03:26] a
[1:03:31] alent Iglesia I believe one time brother
[1:03:34] Adam said I only wish to be a doormat
[1:03:36] coming into church
[1:03:39] sometimes that's how I feel
[1:03:43] better
[1:03:47] I just merely want to be a doormat where
[1:03:49] the brother can clean off their feet
[1:03:50] before coming into church
[1:03:53] so Lord help us this morning
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:27] and we come to find errors and mistakes
[1:04:30] we'll also take those with us
[1:04:38] but I believe we all come with a desire
[1:04:40] to come better than when we came in
[1:04:42] thank you Lord
[1:04:44] help us
[1:04:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:48] amen amen
[1:04:50] we thank the musicians
[1:04:59] and you may be Cedar Brothers
[1:05:04] gracias
[1:05:06] we think brother Octavio for the for the
[1:05:09] trust and the confidence
[1:05:12] it's uh several of us the brothers that
[1:05:15] are helping you know
[1:05:22] and undoubtedly the brother has to be in
[1:05:24] a lot of prayer under the leadership
[1:05:30] where can I said this brother where can
[1:05:32] I place this brother in this building
[1:05:36] it's not an easy thing no lawyers it's
[1:05:39] not
[1:05:42] and then the brothers that on Fridays
[1:05:44] have spoken to us
[1:05:46] mano
[1:06:05] and when I when we exit I agree brother
[1:06:08] Octavio and I said that was very
[1:06:10] beautiful
[1:06:12] the testimony that the brother gave us
[1:06:15] tonight really helped me out Gloria dios
[1:06:17] so we thank God for that
[1:06:19] so when it's our turn
[1:06:23] we have to come asking God for help
[1:06:27] that's why we come
[1:06:30] to try to help amen Hermanos amen
[1:06:33] Brothers
[1:06:36] one time there was a sister that asked
[1:06:38] permission to give a testimony
[1:06:42] and after they gave her permission
[1:06:45] I'm not what I ought to be
[1:06:49] and how many of us can say the same
[1:06:51] thing
[1:06:53] I'm not what I should be
[1:07:04] we're not what we used to be
[1:07:17] that prayer really touched me this
[1:07:19] morning
[1:07:27] and it seems that brother Luis or one of
[1:07:29] the young men touched that scripture a
[1:07:31] while back
[1:07:36] how is it that Daniel went to the river
[1:07:38] and began to pour out his heart unto God
[1:07:42] and he said we have sinned
[1:07:45] he said we have Nosotros
[1:07:48] he says we have failed noise
[1:07:53] not hearkening to the voice of your
[1:07:55] prophets
[1:07:57] and that's the truth
[1:08:00] the reason why they were in Babylon is
[1:08:07] the old because they refuse to listen to
[1:08:09] the true prophet of God
[1:08:12] 70 years you'll be there
[1:08:17] and
[1:08:19] he said the other Prophet then came and
[1:08:21] said it's not 70 it's only going to be
[1:08:24] okay
[1:08:25] of course we'll like that better
[1:08:28] it's not 70 but yeah
[1:08:31] and he had horns with him
[1:08:35] it won't be 70 it's only going to be two
[1:08:39] but it was 70.
[1:08:55] young children when they went into
[1:08:57] captivity
[1:09:03] but Daniel's studying and searching the
[1:09:05] writings of Jeremiah
[1:09:07] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:13] just as we go and we get a message and
[1:09:15] we go get another message it's the same
[1:09:18] thing
[1:09:19] we have the promises
[1:09:22] what we need is there
[1:09:26] So Daniel suddenly realizes he takes
[1:09:30] notice
[1:09:35] that they were for 68 years in captivity
[1:09:38] in Babylon
[1:09:41] the Lord God had taken care of them
[1:09:47] but he noticed that there was two years
[1:09:49] left to to uh sum up the 70 years
[1:09:56] and when he saw that he ran to the river
[1:09:59] to pour out his heart before the Lord
[1:10:02] he says we're guilty we have been killed
[1:10:06] we deserve this we deserve all of this
[1:10:10] but you're a forgiving God foreign
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:36] Jeremiah says 70 years so it's going to
[1:10:39] be 70 years
[1:10:42] it's going to be seven years
[1:10:45] but now 68 had passed
[1:10:49] and Daniel's searching reading
[1:10:52] that's what we should do as well
[1:10:55] not lead everything up to the preachers
[1:10:59] many times we rejoice when we come to
[1:11:02] church and we hear the brothers we hear
[1:11:06] the other brothers
[1:11:08] and that's something that we have
[1:11:10] already read
[1:11:11] on Friday
[1:11:15] uh
[1:11:20] I went to go preach to the at the
[1:11:22] brothers church that visited us on
[1:11:23] Friday
[1:11:24] Oscar is
[1:11:27] I'm quite forgetful
[1:11:30] this morning I left my house with my
[1:11:33] coffee I left with my water speaker I
[1:11:37] left with my little speaker
[1:11:38] and guess what
[1:11:42] I left my 45 at home
[1:11:56] and when I was going to get my brick
[1:11:58] face where's the where's the briefcase I
[1:12:00] didn't have anything
[1:12:01] and today I have to preach
[1:12:05] just imagine that
[1:12:09] I said to my wife get out and
[1:12:13] I'm going back home
[1:12:16] and hopefully I get all green lights in
[1:12:18] the stoplights
[1:12:21] and if there's a red light well Lord
[1:12:23] forgive me for that
[1:12:25] and I'm on my way
[1:12:27] and then suddenly I get a call
[1:12:30] John Paul's on his way oh
[1:12:33] Hermano
[1:13:08] by the way today the morning's uh title
[1:13:11] is the what is the Holy Ghost Hermanos
[1:13:14] I've heard the rest of the brothers
[1:13:16] I like I said I heard brother Louise I
[1:13:20] heard brother Emmanuel
[1:13:22] brother
[1:13:24] and today I told Brother
[1:13:30] this whole time I was between two things
[1:13:40] on the dates
[1:13:43] when we're going to be up here
[1:13:47] then your stomach is
[1:13:51] you know what a stomach ache is
[1:13:54] you're nervous your nervousness
[1:14:15] and the Ducks are inside
[1:14:18] and they're like nothing's going on
[1:14:22] they dipped their head and then they
[1:14:24] come back up
[1:14:26] but if you can get under the water
[1:14:30] you can see their little legs they're
[1:14:32] going back and forth
[1:14:33] the little legs going back and forth
[1:14:37] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:14:41] so may God help us and bless us
[1:14:46] it's such a nervous thing
[1:14:52] so Daniel reading the writings of the
[1:14:55] Prophet Jeremiah
[1:14:57] he realized that there was two years
[1:15:01] and he began to pour out his soul before
[1:15:07] he began to ask forgiveness for himself
[1:15:09] and for the rest
[1:15:16] we have we have we have because he uh
[1:15:18] counted himself with the rest
[1:15:20] and Daniel was a good man
[1:15:23] Daniel had a good testimony
[1:15:27] stood up while in Babylon for what he
[1:15:30] believed
[1:15:31] he didn't worship the image
[1:15:35] they cast him into the lion's den but
[1:15:38] you know what happened
[1:15:40] they cast him into the lines
[1:15:43] and when they come to look in then
[1:15:47] he had a a line as it had as his
[1:15:50] headrest
[1:15:51] just imagine what God does
[1:15:55] God is good
[1:15:58] God knows what he's doing man amen
[1:16:01] So Daniel
[1:16:04] at all he didn't work
[1:16:09] he obeyed the almighty
[1:16:12] glory to his name
[1:16:16] three times you would open as well
[1:16:19] that was facing towards Jerusalem
[1:16:25] and you would ask God for mercy and
[1:16:27] Grace
[1:16:31] I can imagine when he realized that
[1:16:33] there was two years
[1:16:34] glory to his name
[1:16:38] we're leaving we're about to leave
[1:16:40] there's two years left we're about to
[1:16:41] leave
[1:16:44] that it's the same thing with us
[1:16:47] how many are ready to leave
[1:16:50] California brother Brandon was preaching
[1:16:53] a message in California
[1:16:57] and brother Brad I'm saying I would be
[1:17:00] so happy if this would finally reach its
[1:17:02] ends
[1:17:04] and we can finally go with our Lord
[1:17:06] Gloria praise His name
[1:17:10] as Paul said I'm between I'm betwixtures
[1:17:16] Lord I want to go to be with you
[1:17:20] but I'm betwixties
[1:17:24] because if I say that is to help our
[1:17:27] brothers
[1:17:28] so blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:31] that's how many of us feel
[1:17:34] we're uh in between two things
[1:17:44] we're waiting for that Resurrection
[1:17:48] there can't be a Rapture
[1:17:52] I'll say it again there cannot be a
[1:17:54] Rapture Resurrection without first
[1:17:57] having the resurrection
[1:18:00] there first has to be a resurrection
[1:18:03] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:18:06] Esperanto how many are waiting foreign
[1:19:33] your tears
[1:19:46] and when I hear the word the word brings
[1:19:48] joy to my heart so glory to his name
[1:19:53] when the worship comes sometimes you see
[1:19:55] me that I'm running
[1:19:58] it's the worship and the praise
[1:20:02] so raise up your hands worship
[1:20:05] it's the time to do so
[1:20:08] but we're afraid we're scared
[1:20:11] we we have we are
[1:20:15] but you should worship raise up your
[1:20:17] hands
[1:20:19] raise them up
[1:20:24] when you raise your hands you're showing
[1:20:26] that you surrender to him
[1:20:30] and I surrendered to him this morning
[1:20:33] take over my life the glory to his name
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:39] when you raise your name you raise your
[1:20:41] hand it's because you surrender glory to
[1:20:44] his name
[1:20:47] don't let what happened to an American
[1:20:49] in Mexico happen to you
[1:20:52] the Americans didn't know that much
[1:20:54] Spanish he only knew a little bit of
[1:20:57] Spanish
[1:20:58] so then the thieves came
[1:21:01] and they put two knives
[1:21:04] in front of his stomach
[1:21:06] and they said he said the wallet raise
[1:21:10] your hands so he understood that part
[1:21:13] raise your hands
[1:21:14] and he says give me your wallet or your
[1:21:16] life
[1:21:19] and these were obviously turning
[1:21:21] everywhere
[1:21:23] and he with his hands up he was
[1:21:26] surrendering
[1:21:28] when you raise your hands you're
[1:21:29] surrendering
[1:21:34] no one has a a knife or a pistol
[1:21:38] it's his holy ghost that is touching you
[1:21:43] it's the holy ghost that tells you to
[1:21:45] raise your hands so blessed be the name
[1:21:48] of the Lord
[1:21:50] even we're lazy even to do that
[1:21:56] raise your hand please
[1:21:59] raise your hands
[1:22:02] show God you're surrendering to him
[1:22:05] show God that you're surrendering to him
[1:22:08] give me your money or your life
[1:22:13] and he wouldn't answer or reply anything
[1:22:16] just with his hands up
[1:22:18] come on come on give me your money or
[1:22:20] your life and you know what he said in
[1:22:22] the end
[1:22:25] he says wait wait wait
[1:22:27] I'm thinking on what to do
[1:22:31] it's not time to think on what to do
[1:22:36] take out your wallet and give it to him
[1:22:41] foreign
[1:22:43] take off your shoes and the money that
[1:22:45] you're having issues give it to him as
[1:22:46] well
[1:22:47] because they're going to ask for what
[1:22:49] you're hiding in your shoes take off
[1:22:51] your shoes
[1:22:53] your socks
[1:22:55] brothers from Mexico City
[1:22:59] they lost you
[1:23:00] from Mexico City yes
[1:23:02] yes and even Guadalajara it happens too
[1:23:06] not only in Mexico City
[1:23:09] we were on the bus
[1:23:11] there wasn't any seating
[1:23:21] are just standing up from during the
[1:23:24] whole journey through Mexico
[1:23:26] Jesus and my brother Jesus was there
[1:23:31] the father of a sister that's here this
[1:23:33] morning
[1:23:34] and when we got there and dropped off
[1:23:38] they took uh the wallet from him
[1:23:47] if we were just grabbing on they took it
[1:23:50] from him
[1:23:52] now let me tell you something more
[1:23:53] serious
[1:23:56] I was coming from that City from to
[1:23:58] Mexico City
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] I was uh going from a bus that was going
[1:24:03] to take me to the metro
[1:24:05] and when I'm dropping off there at the
[1:24:07] Metro
[1:24:09] I do this to check my what time it is
[1:24:12] and I didn't have my watch
[1:24:28] brothers from Mexico City
[1:24:32] Javier
[1:24:33] hermano brother
[1:24:36] Gloria glory to his name amen amen
[1:24:42] I didn't even feel at what time they
[1:24:44] they took away my watch and it was a
[1:24:47] good watch
[1:24:48] it was a Citizen watch
[1:24:51] one of the most expensive ones at that
[1:24:53] time in New Mexico
[1:24:54] and they stole it from me why because I
[1:24:58] fell asleep
[1:25:00] that's why when brother Johnny when he
[1:25:02] would get up
[1:25:03] he says Be watchful
[1:25:17] the shrimp that falls asleep
[1:25:21] [Laughter]
[1:25:24] whoever falls asleep
[1:25:51] but that day when he went to a church
[1:25:54] and God touched his heart
[1:26:00] the whole time my father was crying
[1:26:03] he got home
[1:26:05] yoran he was crying
[1:26:08] sister Yolanda comes to see him and he's
[1:26:12] crying
[1:26:14] and he kneels to ask for forgiveness
[1:26:19] and sister Yolanda Caesar sanus where'd
[1:26:23] you take him
[1:26:26] he took him to a place where he got
[1:26:29] Jesus
[1:26:30] the Lord Jesus in his heart
[1:26:35] when you receive him you're no longer
[1:26:37] the same
[1:26:38] you're no longer the same
[1:26:42] the woman said I'm not what I ought to
[1:26:45] be but
[1:26:46] I'm certain of one thing I'm not who I
[1:26:49] once was
[1:26:52] let that be the same thing with us
[1:26:55] if there's still something that's
[1:26:57] lingering
[1:26:59] the Holy Ghost is here to help us
[1:27:02] glory to his name
[1:27:05] how many of us can go with our hands
[1:27:09] there's no reason to put a wrench behind
[1:27:12] it
[1:27:14] it's a sign that we're surrendering to
[1:27:16] him this morning
[1:27:19] it's a sign that we need something from
[1:27:21] him
[1:27:53] Acts 2
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:57] we're going to read some verses there
[1:28:02] Acts 2.
[1:28:04] 0
[1:28:09] beginning with verse 17.
[1:28:11] did you find it
[1:28:17] let me read first acts 1 8
[1:28:21] this morning we're speaking about
[1:28:24] on what is the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] Brothers we can't receive something uh
[1:28:32] without first knowing what it is
[1:28:34] is that true
[1:28:38] we can't receive something without first
[1:28:41] knowing what it is
[1:28:42] when you know what it is
[1:28:46] and you know that it's for you
[1:28:49] then you know that it's a promise
[1:28:53] that was made for all of us
[1:28:56] Look what Jesus said here in verse 8.
[1:29:06] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[1:29:09] upon you
[1:29:10] he was about to leave
[1:29:13] he was about to leave then
[1:29:16] and notice what his Apostles are
[1:29:18] answering
[1:29:21] and he said and he shall be Witnesses
[1:29:24] unto me both in Jerusalem
[1:29:27] and in Samaria
[1:29:29] and unto the uttermost part of the year
[1:29:35] when the Holy Ghost will come
[1:29:40] I think it was brother Luis I said you
[1:29:42] can't be a witness
[1:29:44] you have to be a witness
[1:29:47] and you're a witness because you saw
[1:29:50] something
[1:29:51] we cannot be Witnesses
[1:29:55] unless we first saw something
[1:29:57] but when we see it when we hear it
[1:30:20] because he's done so many things
[1:30:23] because he's done so many things with
[1:30:25] you
[1:30:29] we hope that everyone has a chance to
[1:30:31] give a chance if there's a brother
[1:30:36] because God has done so many things with
[1:30:39] us
[1:30:40] and that's why you're here this morning
[1:30:48] we can be somewhere else
[1:30:55] because he did something in us the glory
[1:30:59] to his name amen Hermanos amen Brothers
[1:31:01] Royal
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:22] he found it those
[1:31:25] this is
[1:31:27] and in the last it shall come to pass
[1:31:30] that in the last day saith God is
[1:31:34] my spirit upon All Flesh it was through
[1:31:37] Secrets it was
[1:31:39] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:31:41] prophesy
[1:31:43] that is the Fulfillment of Joel amen
[1:31:47] Brothers
[1:31:49] Years prior to that happening
[1:31:56] that in the latter days in the last days
[1:32:01] he will power his Spirit Upon Our flesh
[1:32:05] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[1:32:12] your old men shall dream dreams
[1:32:15] and now look at verse 18.
[1:32:20] and on my servants and handmaidens I in
[1:32:24] those days
[1:32:31] so brother Marcus mentioned Azusa Street
[1:32:35] and I've read that story
[1:32:39] the man that God used in that place
[1:32:43] he was a descendant from slaves
[1:32:47] and he was missing an eye
[1:32:50] he was missing an eye
[1:33:45] the presence of the almighty was
[1:33:48] shedding us up there
[1:33:50] so may the name of the Lord be glory
[1:34:37] he says where is that where is the Welsh
[1:34:40] Revival
[1:34:41] and he answered
[1:34:47] he was uh he pointed to himself with
[1:34:49] that club that he was he was pointing to
[1:34:51] himself
[1:34:53] and he said it's in my heart
[1:34:56] when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:35:00] I think his brother Emmanuel that
[1:35:02] mentioned it
[1:35:04] he says we visited churches in the
[1:35:07] message
[1:35:08] and we've seen
[1:35:10] we've seen yes and we've heard
[1:35:14] the way that they sing
[1:35:17] the way they play the instruments
[1:35:21] the way that they sing
[1:35:25] and then we can see how they raise their
[1:35:27] hands
[1:35:28] many are crying many are running
[1:35:33] I'm a runner and I'm not ashamed
[1:35:36] why because you've already seen me
[1:35:41] why be embarrassed
[1:35:50] I think one time a son of mine told me
[1:35:52] that brother Flores fell over
[1:36:31] it's good for the Sisters to come and
[1:36:33] stand behind the other sisters and we've
[1:36:36] seen that before
[1:36:38] because they fall back
[1:36:42] and it's a good thing that the other
[1:36:44] sister's there to help her out
[1:36:47] and thank you to the sisters
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:37:37] it seemed weird to them so they said
[1:37:40] they're drunk on new wine or they're
[1:37:41] drunk
[1:37:43] but Peter rolls up and said
[1:37:47] among the 11 Peter Rosen said
[1:37:51] now notice in Acts 2 14. and those are
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:38:17] it was no longer that Peter that said to
[1:38:19] the woman it's not me you're mistaken
[1:38:45] hopefully that never happens to us
[1:38:48] because we must be Witnesses have you
[1:38:51] seen something then you're a witness
[1:38:54] have you felt something you're then a
[1:38:58] witness a glory to his name
[1:39:00] God has healed you you're a witness then
[1:39:05] glory to his name amen yes
[1:39:10] you're a witness he or she is
[1:39:14] I'm not speaking about the Jehovah
[1:39:16] Witnesses
[1:39:17] but we're Witnesses
[1:39:20] real Witnesses
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:40:20] maybe there's no funds
[1:40:24] and you just keep it to yourself
[1:40:28] and maybe no they were mistaken he makes
[1:40:31] no mistakes
[1:40:33] he's never made a mistake so glory to
[1:40:37] his name
[1:40:38] it's in it's in your name
[1:40:42] so go to the bank and cash it out
[1:40:45] so blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:51] one time I was in my truck and my
[1:40:53] supervisor came to me oh I was listening
[1:40:56] to a message and I come and open the
[1:40:59] window and he had an envelope a big one
[1:41:02] and he gives it to me
[1:41:06] he says do you know what this is
[1:41:12] but I saw that it had my name on it
[1:41:17] and he says do you know what this is and
[1:41:21] I said I don't have the slime
[1:41:22] foreign
[1:42:26] whatever you have but just give them to
[1:42:29] me
[1:42:30] Gloria glory to his name
[1:42:33] hermanosion
[1:42:35] there's a blessing when you give as well
[1:42:39] God blesses you in God
[1:42:44] one way or the other God will bless you
[1:42:47] there's a text and the Bible says I was
[1:42:51] young
[1:42:52] and I apply that to myself
[1:43:00] I remember when I saw that Chihuahua
[1:43:02] they would go through Mexico
[1:43:04] and I saw that those were beautiful
[1:43:06] buses
[1:43:08] I said one day I'ma drive that bus
[1:43:12] and I was just a little okay a little a
[1:43:16] little kid you're dreaming right
[1:43:18] I didn't even have any shoes with me at
[1:43:21] the time
[1:43:22] but I would say one a day one of these
[1:43:25] days I'll drive one of those buses
[1:43:27] I said one day one day
[1:44:23] saying that one day I'll drive a bus Los
[1:44:26] Angeles
[1:44:29] okay
[1:44:51] and I mentioned before and I saw that
[1:44:53] there's wrinkles there I have wrinkles
[1:44:57] so I I put my eyes real close and I saw
[1:45:00] that there's wrinkles okay please
[1:45:02] what happened
[1:45:05] I was once young but now I'm old little
[1:45:08] pillow now look at my hair
[1:45:10] and don't worry
[1:45:12] if you make fun of me you're having
[1:45:14] jokes like me Marcos
[1:45:18] Terrace
[1:45:33] best you see this one
[1:45:36] you'll be the same
[1:46:32] is living for others
[1:46:35] may God forgive us but do you know what
[1:46:37] we do many times
[1:46:42] he's my friend
[1:47:12] he won't
[1:47:16] notice but he will notice
[1:47:40] the Bible says search not for your own
[1:47:42] good but foreign
[1:48:46] it's Christ in you
[1:49:45] it's Christ in you
[1:49:49] to Santo s another thing that the Holy
[1:49:51] Ghost is
[1:49:54] look what it says in the message the
[1:49:56] bridge
[1:50:00] I don't know if the brothers have it
[1:50:02] I've already passed over so many things
[1:50:05] and the message the bridge
[1:50:08] page 73.
[1:50:12] the 17th of March 1963. you know this is
[1:50:16] the prophet says
[1:50:20] paragraph 72 he says another thing that
[1:50:22] still signifies is ownership how many
[1:50:25] believe it
[1:50:26] I believe it this morning
[1:50:32] see the seal has a mark on it shows
[1:50:36] ownership
[1:50:39] why did the supervisor come and give me
[1:50:41] the envelope because they had my name is
[1:50:45] that envelope didn't belong to anyone
[1:50:47] else it only belonged to me amen amen as
[1:50:50] the numbers
[1:50:53] as you see the seal has a mark on it
[1:50:56] shows ownership
[1:51:00] it says when you are bobbed by the blood
[1:51:03] of Jesus Christ
[1:51:10] you no longer belong to the world
[1:51:13] or anything pertaining to it
[1:51:17] you are owned by God
[1:51:21] I love our brother Marcos preached
[1:51:25] De La Cruz the thief on the cross
[1:51:29] that was his last chance
[1:51:32] that was his last chance
[1:51:35] and Jesus said
[1:51:58] has done nothing wrong
[1:52:15] but then the words that came from him he
[1:52:18] said Lord
[1:52:20] remember me
[1:52:23] when you're in your kingdom
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:37] but the Lord took him to a beautiful and
[1:52:39] lovely place
[1:52:41] and he did not get baptized
[1:52:44] he did not get the chance to be baptized
[1:52:48] but what about us
[1:52:53] you say oh brother that's good I have no
[1:52:55] intention on getting baptized
[1:53:00] because we do have the chance
[1:53:05] we're given the chance
[1:53:07] so glory to his name amen
[1:53:10] so Brothers
[1:53:14] when you accept the Lord
[1:53:17] when you confess him
[1:53:22] when you fully surrender to him and Don
[1:53:26] says
[1:53:29] then that will take you to this spot
[1:53:31] that we have back here
[1:53:34] when I was in Torreon I said one time
[1:53:38] I knew that I was already baptized
[1:53:45] and I wasn't sure if I was baptized in
[1:53:48] this name I think it was only backwards
[1:53:52] but nevertheless preached a message on
[1:53:55] baptism
[1:53:57] that it must be done in the name of the
[1:53:59] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:09] and here I come running and when I got
[1:54:13] baptized
[1:54:24] just a desire to do it
[1:54:27] and God will provide the rest so glory
[1:54:31] to his name
[1:54:35] but brother also mentioned that can you
[1:54:37] go
[1:54:39] we're bringing a dry sinner we wet him
[1:54:44] and then he comes out as a wet Center
[1:54:49] because surely there was no repentance
[1:54:53] and truly there was no change
[1:55:00] to do everything while we have life and
[1:55:03] health
[1:55:03] amen
[1:55:08] and then another thing brother Brandon
[1:55:10] says is a CEO it represents security
[1:55:18] means that you are secured you are
[1:55:20] secured glory to his name
[1:55:24] this is now you that don't believe in
[1:55:26] internal security he says
[1:55:34] he says but now a seal signifies
[1:55:37] security to a
[1:55:59] that people said the devil made me do it
[1:56:03] what a poor devil we blame him for so
[1:56:06] much
[1:56:07] and sometimes he's just resting relaxing
[1:56:11] he's sleeping taking a nap
[1:56:13] and we're the ones that go to wake him
[1:56:16] up
[1:56:20] they said
[1:56:22] I'll go knows this and he says now some
[1:56:25] say
[1:56:28] s you all have heard me that said
[1:56:31] that people said the devil made me do
[1:56:33] this is
[1:56:36] that isn't the truth
[1:56:39] he says that isn't true
[1:56:42] he says the devil didn't do it
[1:56:48] he says the truth is you just wasn't
[1:56:51] sealed in where
[1:56:53] are there in
[1:56:56] Houston
[1:56:58] this is the the thing is that you
[1:57:00] justice was wasn't sealed in
[1:57:05] cause when you are sealed in
[1:57:09] he is sealed out
[1:57:13] even though the devil wants to come and
[1:57:16] he can't glory to his name
[1:57:19] because you're sealed in
[1:57:22] glory to his name
[1:57:25] so the devil is sealed out
[1:57:27] so this is what happened
[1:57:30] what happened is that you went out
[1:57:34] to him the devil
[1:57:38] he couldn't get into you
[1:57:44] because the only way to get into you
[1:57:48] speaking about us he's speaking about
[1:57:50] the devil Satan this is
[1:57:53] because the only way he can get into you
[1:58:00] it's come through the same process that
[1:58:03] you have
[1:58:04] and for that
[1:58:06] speaking of the devil
[1:58:08] he would have to be saved
[1:58:18] and
[1:58:23] consequently afterwards he'd be your
[1:58:25] brother and Don says
[1:58:27] so you see the devil wasn't the one
[1:58:33] who said yo
[1:58:37] it says you just went to the borderline
[1:58:41] you went to the borderline
[1:58:45] and come back last lusting for the
[1:58:48] things of the world
[1:58:51] you never went all the way over into
[1:58:54] Kings you see across Jordan
[1:58:59] which is death to self
[1:59:05] you fight for every inch
[1:59:08] of ground
[1:59:20] we have to fight for every inch of
[1:59:23] ground brothers
[1:59:24] and to do that
[1:59:27] we need his spirit inside us
[1:59:31] so this morning I hope God can bless you
[1:59:35] and God keep you I I didn't finish
[1:59:39] I'll finish some other time
[1:59:44] just in closing I want to ask
[1:59:47] you pray for my wife and myself
[1:59:53] on March 31st we'll be boarding a plane
[1:59:55] for three days going to Puerto Vallarta
[1:59:59] on Tuesday we'll be going to Guadalajara
[2:00:01] for two days
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:07] and then on the fourth we'll be going on
[2:00:09] a bus to go to Mexico
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:29] Mexico City
[2:00:38] uh the faith that saves
[2:00:41] when I left escouch I heard the
[2:00:45] conversations
[2:00:51] and this was the conversation
[2:00:56] he invited brother Johnny to go to
[2:00:58] Mexico City
[2:01:00] and when I I'm passing by and I heard
[2:01:02] this Johnny
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:48] and some other brothers were there as
[2:01:50] well
[2:01:56] now everything touched my heart but what
[2:01:58] really struck my heart
[2:02:00] was what brother Eli mentioned
[2:02:05] that brother Octavio walked over and
[2:02:07] leaned in to where the brother Daniel
[2:02:09] was and he said
[2:02:11] he says tell brother Johnny
[2:02:16] that we're doing the best that we can
[2:02:19] it's
[2:02:23] always have that with me Gloria so glory
[2:02:27] to his name
[2:02:31] he's in a better place than Mexico City
[2:02:55] and that this missionary work that was
[2:02:57] in the heart of brother Johnny
[2:03:10] I hadn't seen him for years
[2:03:16] but God turned him into a magnet do you
[2:03:19] know what a magnet is
[2:03:22] I'm closing my time is up if the
[2:03:24] musicians can come
[2:03:26] please come
[2:03:34] a magnet
[2:03:36] you know what a magnet is
[2:03:41] put it
[2:03:46] to the other object that has a magnetism
[2:03:51] you need to have one to be able to make
[2:03:53] contact with him
[2:03:56] and I believe that for many of us
[2:03:58] brother Brian brother Johnny was a
[2:04:00] magnifier
[2:04:01] I stopped seeing him for many years
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:05] but the last times that God allowed me
[2:04:08] to see him for me he was a magnet and
[2:04:12] now we're here
[2:04:27] you'll see me here again next Sunday
[2:04:31] [Music]
[2:04:37] okay
[2:04:42] sometimes we don't actually kick the dog
[2:04:44] but we're nudging him wanting him to
[2:04:46] leave and he and he takes off
[2:04:50] and now we're happy because
[2:04:52] and then you turn around and he's there
[2:04:54] again
[2:04:56] that's me
[2:05:03] so this is where we'll say this is
[2:05:17] this morning I joined with Daniel's
[2:05:19] prayer please
[2:05:21] we failed
[2:05:26] we've committed iniquities
[2:05:31] we've sinned
[2:05:36] we haven't heard
[2:05:39] what your Prophet has said
[2:05:44] but this morning with our hands raised
[2:05:48] as a sign that we're surrendering to you
[2:05:53] we ask for forgiveness
[2:05:57] and you're a forgiving God
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:12] but gets back up
[2:06:14] Gloria dios so praise God
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:18] Lord help us to get back up
[2:06:22] help us to keep going forward
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:27] don't let what happened to that man
[2:06:30] happen to us
[2:06:32] that one day he was talking to God and
[2:06:34] he said Lord
[2:06:38] this is the cross that you gave me is
[2:06:41] too heavy and I can't take it anymore
[2:06:45] I can't bear it anymore it's too heavy
[2:06:50] is
[2:06:52] could you give me a smaller one special
[2:06:55] with that is lighter in weight
[2:07:00] and the the story says that God said yes
[2:07:05] you see that warehouse over there
[2:07:09] there's crosses there
[2:07:11] pesos of different sizes and weights
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:16] go and pick the one that you want
[2:07:18] [Music]
[2:07:25] the first thing that he saw were the
[2:07:27] crosses in the weights
[2:07:30] and he got the smallest one
[2:07:34] he got the smallest one
[2:07:38] and when he left out with it
[2:07:41] he said God
[2:07:45] told him the one year living behind is
[2:07:49] smaller than the one that you just took
[2:07:54] but for us it seems to be very happy
[2:07:58] there's mountains that we can't climb
[2:08:03] there's valleys that scare us
[2:08:06] there's Giants in the land
[2:08:09] come on
[2:08:12] [Music]
