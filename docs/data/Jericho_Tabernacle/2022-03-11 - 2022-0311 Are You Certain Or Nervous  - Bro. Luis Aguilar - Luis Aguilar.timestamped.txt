[41:04] and then
[41:19] listening to a message from our prophet
[41:21] yes
[41:24] titled be certain of god
[41:28] and then i was hearing a message of or
[41:30] my apostle brother bernie garcia
[41:32] mensah
[41:34] it says mankind is having a nervous
[41:37] breakdown
[41:41] and i felt that the lord spoke to me
[41:43] there is antique
[41:46] and i want to share with you what the
[41:47] lord gave me
[41:50] here in the scripture in saint john 14.
[41:56] lord jesus christ says peace
[41:58] i live with you
[42:00] el senor jesus
[42:12] there's people that can't sleep at night
[42:29] they go to work and they have no peace
[42:34] they try to go to sleep and they they
[42:35] have no peace
[42:38] so they go to drugs or alcohol or or
[42:41] some outlet and a recurrent
[42:51] and to come to a point where they just
[42:53] end up killing themselves because they
[42:54] can't have peace
[43:11] and the world today they try or they
[43:13] they they try to fake that piece
[43:18] and how do you say that brother louise
[43:21] what makes you think that the world
[43:22] gives peace
[44:05] i hope your heart is not troubled today
[44:10] your heart might be troubled about your
[44:11] son
[44:14] maybe your heart is troubled because of
[44:15] your family
[44:18] your grandchildren
[44:20] your husband
[44:23] you're always constantly thinking about
[44:25] it
[44:28] jesus says but rather neither let it be
[44:31] afraid
[44:35] amen that's very it's easier said than
[44:37] done
[44:39] but that's why i asked this question to
[44:41] you
[44:43] are you certain
[44:45] or are you nervous
[44:46] amen i hope you're not as nervous as i
[44:49] am yes

[44:54] it makes me feel okay
[44:57] the the the definition of the word
[44:59] certain uh definition
[46:11] [Music]
[46:12] those questions to maybe you can answer
[46:14] that question question to yourself more
[46:16] assured
[46:20] are you certain
[46:23] or are you nervous
[46:25] the world is very nervous today
[46:40] and the people are getting nervous
[46:43] the people don't know what to do
[46:46] there's people that that have a
[46:48] understanding of what's going on
[46:53] what's going
[46:55] many on think that russia is the
[46:57] antichrist
[47:00] but russia is not the antichrist
[47:04] russia russia was was raised up
[47:08] not by an angel no puruna not by the the
[47:11] third best angel of god
[47:15] not by michael or by gabriel
[47:17] miguel gabriel russia was raised up by
[47:20] god himself
[47:22] raised
[47:32] the owner himself comes to you and talks
[47:34] to you
[47:50] it's the same thing with russia
[47:53] he went straight to russia
[47:56] and russia accepted that challenge
[48:01] what is that what is that challenge
[48:03] to destroy the united states
[48:13] but are you certain or are you nervous

[48:19] the question are you nervous about
[48:21] russia
[48:24] are you nervous about the rapture
[48:29] or are you certain
[48:31] are you sure
[48:45] it says rejoice in the lord alway
[48:50] he didn't say that rejoice in the lord
[48:52] sometimes
[48:55] the things are good rejoice in the lord
[49:00] he says rejoice
[49:19] [Applause]
[49:42] don't
[50:09] one thing is
[50:11] and supplication thing is thanksgiving
[50:15] so here he says don't be scared about
[50:16] anything

[50:22] pray about it
[50:24] and when
[50:37] i surrender i surrender this need on to
[50:40] you lord
[50:42] necessity it seems impossible what i'm
[50:44] asking to you
[50:47] it seems what it's what i'm asking for
[50:48] you lord it's it's it's it's impossible
[50:51] to for man to give but
[51:06] let your request be known unto god
[51:12] don't just pray about it

[51:18] but say god thank you lord but
[51:49] sermon

[1:05:48] i'm gonna speak a little bit of elijah
[1:05:51] now here where i'm going to take off is
[1:05:53] where eliza elijah just finished
[1:05:56] with the widow woman
[1:06:00] and she had no food yeah
[1:06:21] there was a wicked woman by the name of
[1:06:23] jezebel
[1:06:26] this woman killed the prophets of god
[1:06:32] and
[1:06:33] elijah was there and he was quiet down
[1:06:35] for a couple for a while
[1:06:40] and ahab and obadiah e akabi abdi
[1:06:44] abbadaya was a governor
[1:06:54] he saw how jezebel cut the heads off of
[1:06:57] these prophets
[1:07:26] there was a famine in the land and he
[1:07:27] said okay
[1:07:28] you go this way and i'm going to go that
[1:07:30] way
[1:07:36] we're going to make sure we can get
[1:07:37] everything ready because we can have
[1:07:39] food for our our livestock
[1:07:54] is
[1:08:18] looking for you and made those nations
[1:08:20] swear to know that you to tell the truth
[1:09:03] and here on the 17th verse
[1:09:07] ahab saw elijah
[1:09:09] alias they have said on to him
[1:09:12] what are you doing here who troubleth
[1:09:14] israel
[1:09:18] so here is ahab uh accusing elijah to be
[1:09:22] troubling israel
[1:09:26] israel art
[1:09:27] that trouble with israel
[1:09:31] and he said i have not troubled israel
[1:09:35] but you in your father's house have
[1:09:37] trouble israel
[1:09:40] you have forsaken the commandments of
[1:09:42] the lord
[1:09:44] you have followed balaam
[1:09:47] now he said gather all the all the all
[1:09:49] of israel onto mount carmo
[1:09:55] the prophets of baal and the 450.
[1:10:00] and all those prophets that sit in
[1:10:01] jezebel's table
[1:10:06] and elijah came to the people
[1:10:10] here what elijah's doing he's making a
[1:10:12] challenge
[1:11:18] are you certain or are you nervous
[1:11:21] and it says if the lord be god follow
[1:11:23] him
[1:11:37] my question is for the young people
[1:11:52] follow him
[1:12:04] and it says you pick yourself
[1:12:16] but don't set it on fire but
[1:12:19] for god has to answer
[1:12:35] bullock that was given to them
[1:12:39] and they dressed it up
[1:12:41] you know how you dress yourself come on
[1:12:44] you put your little tie on it
[1:12:46] put your dress on
[1:12:47] what these prophets were doing they were
[1:12:49] dressing up the altar
[1:12:52] and they call the name of belle from
[1:12:54] morning until noon
[1:12:59] that's a long time
[1:13:02] when does the morning actually start
[1:13:03] cuando coming in
[1:13:05] maybe about six in the morning
[1:13:08] so they were calling the name of bell
[1:13:09] for about four or five hours six hours
[1:13:15] and this is and they were saying oh
[1:13:58] so
[1:14:11] is
[1:14:26] is
[1:14:29] the scripture says nothing happened
[1:14:32] nothing happened
[1:14:34] elijah told the people come here
[1:14:38] and then elijah started to repair the
[1:14:39] altar of the lord
[1:14:54] around the altar
[1:14:58] imagine this is the altar right here
[1:15:01] elijah grabbed the shovel
[1:15:03] and he made a trench around it
[1:15:08] he cut the bollock up to pieces
[1:15:15] and he says go bring me four barrels of
[1:15:17] water
[1:15:20] four barrels of water
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:19] in israel
[1:16:22] and that i am thy servant
[1:16:24] and i've done all these things at thy
[1:16:26] word
[1:16:30] hear me o lord hear me
[1:16:32] respond to me
[1:17:10] then the scripture says then the fire of
[1:17:12] the lord fell upon
[1:18:08] without messing up any of the nerves sin
[1:18:10] disoriented
[1:18:39] and when the people saw it
[1:18:43] do we still deny the presence of the
[1:18:45] lord when we see something like that
[1:18:49] the people they fell on their faces
[1:19:20] you're
[1:19:34] hey when they saw that
[1:19:38] elijah said go give me all those
[1:19:40] prophets
[1:19:42] none of them run away
[1:19:45] and elijah killed all those prophets it
[1:19:48] is
[1:19:56] i'm going to fast forward but ahab went
[1:19:58] to jezebel
[1:20:00] aka
[1:20:04] told them everything
[1:20:07] because she was the boss
[1:20:13] so jezebel said

[1:20:18] i have a big denomination
[1:20:22] i have a big church
[1:20:24] who does he think he is
[1:20:26] in secret he doesn't even have a bank
[1:20:27] account
[1:20:29] and she sent down the messenger yeah
[1:20:33] she even jezebel has messengers
[1:20:39] she has profits
[1:20:41] jezebel sent the messenger
[1:20:44] go tell elijah
[1:20:58] do queso
[1:21:02] you ran
[1:21:04] he felt nervous
[1:21:06] so scared
[1:21:08] he felt nervous
[1:21:10] he was he was right there in the
[1:21:11] presence of god
[1:21:54] then finally after he done proved that
[1:21:56] god was god
