[38:28] who are joining us this
[38:32] morning they were they asked me to give
[38:34] a
[38:36] [Music]
[38:37] report to the from the trip from El
[38:40] Salvador
[38:42] um
[38:45] um recently in these past
[38:49] weeks I was uh traveling quite a
[38:54] bit before going to Al Salvador I was in
[38:56] tuon
[39:00] and before tuon I was in
[39:05] Mex I would say something strange
[39:07] happened to me in
[39:12] Mexicali and God showed me later on
[39:14] there in
[39:18] Salvador the last occasion that I was in
[39:21] Mexicali it was about two years
[39:25] ago I went with brother
[39:27] into a minister
[39:33] meeting the reason why we went is
[39:35] because was going to speak in those
[39:39] meetings and every Minister that was
[39:41] going to
[39:43] speak had an appointed topic of what
[39:46] they were going to talk
[39:52] about and brother mata's topic was like
[39:55] the flying saucers the UFOs
[39:59] and we find that those are fine in the
[40:05] Bible and after the minister meeting was
[40:10] done we were going to go to the the
[40:12] mission there in St
[40:15] Louis and that trip was cancelled so we
[40:17] stayed in
[40:20] Mex Min amicos in the same time there
[40:24] was an American brothers that visited us
[40:27] uh
[40:29] and they needed an
[40:31] [Music]
[40:32] interpreter since we didn't go to St
[40:34] Louis and we
[40:38] stayed I I stayed to interpret the
[40:45] brothers and for one reason I couldn't
[40:49] understand
[40:55] uh there on Sunday had to stay with the
[40:57] pastor and other ministers to interpret
[41:01] them and the pastor shared with me a
[41:04] dream of his
[41:09] mother and this is before this is before
[41:13] they came in the
[41:18] message and he he said that in his
[41:21] mother's dream she saw a flying
[41:26] saucer
[41:27] and that Flying Saucer was coming and
[41:29] then it stayed
[41:31] still a window was
[41:35] open and someone came out of that Flying
[41:39] Saucer and that person was brother
[41:43] Bram and a voice came out and
[41:48] said this is the most sincere person who
[41:51] I can can trust with my
[41:56] word for for one reason or another I
[41:57] couldn't understand why on
[42:01] Sunday that the brother was sharing this
[42:03] dream of the Flying
[42:06] Saucer and the day before brother Mata
[42:09] was speaking of the topic of the flying
[42:11] saucers I didn't make the
[42:15] connection until this last occasion that
[42:17] I went to
[42:21] Mexicali I remember what the pastor
[42:22] shared with
[42:26] me
[42:28] then me I started to study the flying
[42:30] saucers according to the
[42:34] message and the day I spoke was the 25th
[42:37] of
[42:39] February and this scripture came to my
[42:42] mind in the book of
[42:56] aladiah
[43:00] the vision of abah thus sayth the Lord
[43:02] God concerning Edom we have heard a
[43:04] rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is
[43:05] sent among the Heathen arise he and let
[43:07] us rise up against her in
[43:13] battle behold I have made thee a small
[43:16] among among Thee the Heathen Thou Art
[43:19] greatly
[43:26] despised
[43:31] the pride of thine heart hath deceived
[43:33] thee thou that dwellest in the Cass of
[43:35] the Rocks whose habitation is high that
[43:38] that saith in his heart who shall bring
[43:39] me down to the
[43:42] ground if you notice that's speaking
[43:44] about the
[43:46] devil that arrogant spirit that wants to
[43:48] come up
[43:49] higher where God is
[43:52] found that is the spirit of the
[43:56] devil
[44:02] verse four says Thou though thou exalt
[44:06] thyself as the eag and though thou set
[44:08] thy Nest Among the Stars Then will I
[44:10] bring thee down sayith the
[44:14] Lord there's a message that brother Ram
[44:16] preaches as called a
[44:20] countdown and he speaks about the
[44:22] astronauts in that
[44:26] message
[44:28] and brother R says what God allows them
[44:30] to do in
[44:34] science because God is showing what
[44:36] God's going to do in the
[44:39] church so when we went to
[44:44] Salvador houon it seems that we made a
[44:47] layover or a flight layover there in
[44:49] Houston Houston is
[44:51] is and Houston is the city of the
[44:55] astronauts I didn't find out until we're
[44:57] coming
[45:01] back and when we got to Salvador the
[45:03] pastor brother picked us
[45:07] up he took us to a high
[45:12] mountain that is called the devil's
[45:17] gate I find it very
[45:20] humorous that we were in the place of
[45:23] the El Salvador the
[45:25] savior
[45:28] and there is a place called The Devil's
[45:35] gate but I found out that that place is
[45:38] in the
[45:40] Bible it's here in abah that we just
[45:46] read because there there's a legend
[45:49] about that
[45:55] place that Legend is about the Civil War
[45:57] that they were having there in the in
[45:59] the country of El
[46:04] Salvador and the legend itself it says
[46:07] the devil was trying to seduce a young
[46:13] lady and he finally seduced her and took
[46:16] her to that mountain or that high
[46:19] place and she uh made the the bride for
[46:25] him
[46:28] and when her family found out that she
[46:30] was up
[46:33] there not wanted to leave her in the
[46:35] claws of the
[46:37] devil they went to go and rescue
[46:41] her and they said the legend says they
[46:43] had the devil
[46:49] surrounded and he went through the Rock
[46:51] and he split open The
[46:55] Rock
[47:08] you abah 13 it says the pride of thine
[47:10] heart had deceived thee thou that
[47:11] dwellest in the class of the rock whose
[47:14] habitation is high that saith in his
[47:16] heart who shall bring me down to the
[47:22] ground then I remember why I went to
[47:25] Mexicali I begin to study the flying
[47:31] saucers how that the devil is trying to
[47:33] copy the
[47:35] astronaut then they take us to the
[47:37] devil's
[47:39] gate then I keep reading in
[47:42] aladiah and then I go to verse
[47:46] 21 we're in the country of
[47:50] salad in verse 21 it
[47:55] says
[47:59] and it says and saviors shall come up on
[48:02] on the Mount Zion to judge the Mount of
[48:04] Esa and the kingdom shall be the
[48:09] Lords how can I see that the Brethren of
[48:12] the the salvadorians are in the
[48:16] Bible it says and
[48:19] saviors not savior but
[48:25] saviors we we had a really good time
[48:27] there with brother
[48:31] Ardo we had really good fellowship with
[48:33] brother Jose and his
[48:35] family they treated us very
[48:38] well the food was very
[48:42] good the bestas I ever had in my
[48:49] life and I can see why the the God was
[48:52] guiding me in that
[48:54] way sometimes God has to put you will
[48:57] guide you to different
[48:59] places and then he shows you why he took
[49:01] you to that
[49:04] place there were other things that are
[49:06] in my
[49:09] heart I can find answers for that there
[49:13] in
[49:14] salvad there's a reason for
[49:18] everything so receive greetings from the
[49:22] brothers from the G
[49:25] family from Brother and his
[49:28] wife they send forth their greetings may
[49:32] the Lord bless

[1:17:15] blessing to have a ministry that's
[1:17:17] capable to go out and
[1:17:23] preach
[1:17:27] I'd like to go over the stature of a
[1:17:29] perfect
[1:17:32] man we we touched this subject last
[1:17:37] week this is uh this stature of a
[1:17:41] perfect
[1:17:43] man if you can put it up
[1:17:46] there it is is really loaded with
[1:17:53] information it it has has uh the church
[1:17:58] ages it has the
[1:18:01] virtues and it has The
[1:18:07] Messengers and not only
[1:18:09] that but we can add to
[1:18:13] that other teachings that brother Braham
[1:18:19] brought we can add to
[1:18:23] that the lion
[1:18:26] age see the first church age was was
[1:18:31] Brother Paul's or or the Apostle Paul's
[1:18:34] Church
[1:18:37] age it was the church age of the
[1:18:41] word the lion
[1:18:44] age the second age the church started
[1:18:47] dying
[1:18:53] off in the third age ages it
[1:18:56] died in the fourth age it was actually
[1:19:03] buried that whole
[1:19:05] age is called the ox
[1:19:08] age the sacrificial animal
[1:19:13] age age that the that the people died
[1:19:17] for their
[1:19:20] testimony for what they
[1:19:23] believe they were
[1:19:26] killed as we know in the
[1:19:28] 300 year or so uh the Catholic Church
[1:19:32] started
[1:19:36] up but then in the fifth Church
[1:19:40] age we have what we call the the
[1:19:44] Reformation
[1:19:47] age it changed to a man
[1:19:51] age so that man age is a Martin
[1:19:56] Luther it's called the the the man
[1:19:59] age the Reformation
[1:20:01] age just shall live by
[1:20:05] faith and then the next
[1:20:07] age the sixth agage we have
[1:20:13] sanctification with John Wesley ju
[1:20:16] Wesley it it started
[1:20:20] improving and then now we have what we
[1:20:22] call is a Pentecostal
[1:20:28] and this Pentecostal age is it's much
[1:20:33] different of the other
[1:20:35] ages because it
[1:20:37] changed changed over to an eagle
[1:20:41] age and the eagle age can see a little
[1:20:47] further see a little
[1:20:50] different than the other
[1:20:53] ages
[1:20:55] once
[1:20:56] again the first church
[1:21:00] age it's also called the seed
[1:21:06] age the seed
[1:21:09] age is a very important part or very
[1:21:12] important
[1:21:15] age that's the age that we
[1:21:18] study the first church age the first
[1:21:21] church age has to do with the Apostle
[1:21:24] Paul
[1:21:27] and that's the only really the only age
[1:21:30] that we really
[1:21:33] study the only age that is referred back
[1:21:39] to that first church
[1:21:42] age is what wrote the fir the New
[1:21:48] Testament that's the only one we compare
[1:21:52] to is that first church
[1:21:55] age it was the word
[1:21:58] age and as we studied last
[1:22:01] week that word started dying out right
[1:22:06] away the second age in the third age
[1:22:10] once again it
[1:22:13] died but in the fourth age it was
[1:22:18] buried but we have something different
[1:22:21] on the fifth Church
[1:22:23] age
[1:22:26] fif church is the word started coming
[1:22:30] back brother Braham talks about this
[1:22:33] quite a bit in
[1:22:40] 1965 and he said it very uh quite a few
[1:22:45] times and that is called the the age or
[1:22:50] the time that we had the stock age yes
[1:22:58] of the
[1:23:00] wheat and Wesley says the tassel started
[1:23:06] growing and now in this
[1:23:10] age we had John
[1:23:13] Wesley Wesley and then on the seventh
[1:23:17] age says on the seventh
[1:23:20] age you have to be very
[1:23:23] careful
[1:23:25] because this age is very
[1:23:28] deceiving it's the most deceiving
[1:23:31] age is the age that we live
[1:23:34] in the seventh Church
[1:23:38] age because we have what was called the
[1:23:40] Chuck
[1:23:42] age the Chuck the very deceiving
[1:23:48] age the Chuck must be sure to wait in
[1:23:53] the sun to be
[1:23:59] ripen to be sure the seed is back to its
[1:24:04] original
[1:24:05] form from the beginning Pentecostal
[1:24:17] age this seed has to
[1:24:22] ripen and it has to ripen under under
[1:24:24] the
[1:24:26] word under this
[1:24:29] church under this
[1:24:31] message it has to
[1:24:34] ripen it's not the Chuck but it's the
[1:24:37] seed that's in
[1:24:40] there once again Martin Luther has a
[1:24:45] stock John Wesley has a tassel ju
[1:24:49] W and in this Pentecostal
[1:24:52] age we have the child
[1:24:55] but within that
[1:24:57] sh we have this
[1:24:59] message it's the message of the
[1:25:02] hour it's the seed
[1:25:05] hour the time this seed goes back to its
[1:25:12] original we have something we called the
[1:25:15] message of the
[1:25:17] hour someone asked me okay you say you
[1:25:21] have the message of the
[1:25:23] hour
[1:25:26] what's that
[1:25:29] message have you ever thought of
[1:25:31] that someone asked me the other
[1:25:35] day well you have the
[1:25:38] message what is that
[1:25:41] message it's a message of
[1:25:45] restoration that brings us back to the
[1:25:49] original the Pentecostal
[1:25:53] age but that's not
[1:25:55] all it takes us even farther than
[1:26:00] that into a
[1:26:03] resurrection and into a
[1:26:06] Rapture it's a message of
[1:26:09] restoration bringing us back to the
[1:26:14] word we don't compare to any other
[1:26:17] Church
[1:26:19] age except that first one the one we're
[1:26:23] supposed to go back
[1:26:25] to the
[1:26:27] message the one we
[1:26:30] study we study that first church
[1:26:36] age everything else will be
[1:26:40] burned everything else will be burned
[1:26:44] except this message of the
[1:26:47] hour the the Bride of this church
[1:26:51] age of this message
[1:26:54] will be the one that's being
[1:26:58] resurrected and
[1:27:00] raptured now each
[1:27:04] age had its
[1:27:07] time each Church age
[1:27:11] Messenger will present his
[1:27:17] group each Messenger will present his
[1:27:23] group in the message beyond the curtain
[1:27:26] of
[1:27:27] time brother Braham mentions
[1:27:31] that each message will present its
[1:27:36] group but we also have something that we
[1:27:39] call unleavened
[1:27:44] bread each Church
[1:27:47] age had its time of
[1:27:52] word but we canot use any other's bread
[1:27:57] or any others
[1:28:01] word because each Church age had his
[1:28:06] own we have seven unleavened bread
[1:28:10] Church
[1:28:14] ages I hope that makes
[1:28:19] sense the
[1:28:21] church is in pregnated with this
[1:28:29] word the
[1:28:31] church is takes in this
[1:28:37] church this church
[1:28:42] message does that make
[1:28:44] sense the
[1:28:46] bride is
[1:28:49] marrying at this
[1:28:53] time
[1:28:55] I hope that makes
[1:28:57] sense see we're going to the
[1:29:00] marriage Lamb's
[1:29:05] supper so we're getting married
[1:29:09] here and Christ is coming back for his
[1:29:14] bride to take
[1:29:17] her now the
[1:29:20] bride there's three phases to the bride
[1:29:25] if you remember the vision of the
[1:29:29] Bride the first bride
[1:29:33] age was clean was
[1:29:38] beautiful prophets are
[1:29:41] walking it was great it was it was
[1:29:46] perfect but then we had what he was
[1:29:49] called a vulgar

[1:38:00] of Barak and of Samson and of
[1:38:03] jof of David also and S Samuel and of
[1:38:07] the prophets
[1:38:18] he who through faith subdued kingdoms
[1:38:22] righteousness obtain promises stopped
[1:38:26] the mouth of
[1:38:33] lions quench the violence of fire
[1:38:36] escaped the edge of the
[1:38:39] sword out of weakness were made strong
[1:38:43] wax violent and fight turned to fight
[1:38:47] the armies of the
[1:38:52] aliens
[1:39:01] woman raised their dead raised to life
[1:39:04] again and others were tortured not
[1:39:06] accepting Deliverance that they might
[1:39:09] obtain a better
[1:39:20] resurrection and others had trial of
[1:39:23] cruel mocking and of
[1:39:26] scorings yeah moreover the bonds and
[1:39:36] imprisonment they were ston they were s
[1:39:39] aunder were tempted were slain with a
[1:39:43] sword they wandered about in Chief skins
[1:39:46] and goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[1:39:52] tormented
[1:40:04] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:40:06] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:40:10] in dens and in caves of the
[1:40:19] earth and these all having the T a good
[1:40:23] report through faith received not the
[1:40:33] promise God having provided some better
[1:40:37] thing for us that they without us should
[1:40:41] not be made
[1:40:51] perfect Matthew chapter
[1:40:57] 548 brother Bram says that God is
[1:41:00] waiting for
[1:41:03] us he is waiting for
[1:41:12] us Matthew
[1:41:16] 5:48 but be ye
[1:41:20] perfect even as Our Father which is in
[1:41:23] heaven is
[1:41:30] perfect remember we're talking about
[1:41:35] perfect be ye
[1:41:39] perfect we'll explain that in a little
[1:41:42] bit Ephesians
[1:41:52] 41
[1:42:10] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:42:14] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:42:16] pastors and
[1:42:22] teachers
[1:42:26] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:42:29] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:42:33] the body of
[1:42:40] Christ for the perfecting of the
[1:42:45] Saints so we all come in the unity of
[1:42:50] faith and of the knowledge of of the Son
[1:42:53] of God unto a perfect
[1:42:58] man unto the measure of the stature of
[1:43:02] the fullness of
[1:43:13] Christ be ye
[1:43:17] perfect perfecting of the
[1:43:20] Saints and unto a perfect
[1:43:24] man that we henceforth be no more
[1:43:28] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:43:32] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:43:35] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:43:38] whereby they lie and wait to
[1:43:52] deceive
[1:43:54] but speaking in the truth and love may
[1:43:58] grow up into him in all things which is
[1:44:03] the head even
[1:44:15] Christ so we need to be
[1:44:19] perfect mentioned that several times in
[1:44:21] the Bible
[1:44:25] so how can we be
[1:44:28] perfect brother Braham uh teaches a
[1:44:32] series of
[1:44:36] messages we won't have time to read them
[1:44:38] but I'll mention
[1:44:42] them and then I'll read the last
[1:44:45] one but what's very
[1:44:48] interesting is how he brought
[1:44:51] it on the
[1:44:55] 1964 then
[1:44:58] 1965 and he finishes with the message
[1:45:04] Rapture and things that are to
[1:45:08] be in
[1:45:11] 1964 7:26 in the morning he preached
[1:45:14] recognizing your day and his
[1:45:21] message and he explains the evening time
[1:45:28] message how it was to restore back again
[1:45:32] to bring back the same thing
[1:45:38] again and he talks about the
[1:45:42] bride and he shows who the bride
[1:45:45] is throughout the
[1:45:49] ages then he says the the bride will
[1:45:52] come and to preview
[1:45:57] again the very same
[1:46:00] bride the very same looking bride that
[1:46:04] passed in the
[1:46:09] beginning bride in the
[1:46:12] beginning vulgar
[1:46:14] bride and another
[1:46:17] bride very very interesting how brother
[1:46:19] B brings
[1:46:21] that
[1:46:23] 1964 1212 brother Bram preaches the
[1:46:27] Harvest
[1:46:34] time and it has it has to do with the
[1:46:36] ministry just exactly on the
[1:46:42] word the ministry has to be exactly on
[1:46:46] the
[1:46:50] word it says here uh Ministry just
[1:46:53] exactly on the word like he was on the
[1:47:01] word the first church was on the word
[1:47:06] spirit filled word fed not
[1:47:10] denominational fed word
[1:47:21] fed
[1:47:25] in 64 1212 we preached the Harvest
[1:47:33] Time and he really goes into talking
[1:47:35] about the
[1:47:39] wheat how he had Lutheran age the Wesley
[1:47:46] Age and and he types the
[1:47:51] two with the wheat
[1:47:53] and he says on that Matthew
[1:47:58] 2424 it would deceive the very elect if
[1:48:02] it was
[1:48:05] possible is it possible to fool the
[1:48:11] elect it's not it can't fool the
[1:48:16] elect we have come out of those
[1:48:18] denominational
[1:48:21] systems to this
[1:48:27] word in
[1:48:33] 1965 the seed is not air with the
[1:48:39] Shu again he really hammers at the stock
[1:48:43] the tassel and the
[1:48:49] Chuck says like a seed is planted
[1:48:54] brings fors the
[1:48:56] stock the blade shoots from
[1:49:00] it and the
[1:49:02] tassel the P the pollen hangs on
[1:49:07] it and then the
[1:49:09] Chuck and then the seed
[1:49:16] age in
[1:49:18] 1965
[1:49:21] 410 the east Easter
[1:49:26] seal he say son of man come back as a
[1:49:31] prophetic message for the last day when
[1:49:35] that age will be
[1:49:38] flying not the lion not the ox in the
[1:49:42] sacrifice age
[1:49:51] see
[1:49:56] see every time a religious power went
[1:49:59] forth to meet the challenge of the
[1:50:01] political power of the
[1:50:09] world when the lion raised up the
[1:50:13] religious power it went to meet the
[1:50:15] Roman
[1:50:20] power and then when come the sacrifice
[1:50:24] our the ox went because he's the
[1:50:29] sacrifice or beast of the
[1:50:39] Lord then comes the reformers down
[1:50:43] through the church Ages come to the face
[1:50:46] of man and the reformers had been since
[1:50:51] Luther Wesley
[1:50:53] C and on down then Pentecostal
[1:51:09] age but in the message that went forth
[1:51:14] there come a flying eagle the eagle time
[1:51:18] revealed time the word of God made
[1:51:21] manifest the word of God

[1:51:56] there get out of those pens your Eagles
[1:52:00] you're flying higher than
[1:52:03] that out of those denominational
[1:52:08] systems why brother Brams hit so hard
[1:52:11] those denominal denominational
[1:52:16] systems that was his
[1:52:18] job to get those denominational those
[1:52:22] people off off those denominational
[1:52:26] systems and bring them to the
[1:52:28] word the message that's our place of

[2:21:12] [Music]
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:38] the reason why we're here is because I
[2:21:40] asked the
[2:21:44] pastor yeah that we've been walking for
[2:21:47] roughly about three years
[2:21:49] now
[2:21:51] and
[2:21:53] tomorrow we're going to be fulfilling
[2:21:55] three
[2:21:57] years my wife and
[2:22:03] I of having the Monday morning prayer
[2:22:10] service I call her
[2:22:14] my uh not so that anybody would
[2:22:16] misunderstand me but we have 57 years of
[2:22:19] marriage
[2:22:22] and she has Stood Beside
[2:22:24] Me she has backed me
[2:22:27] up and she's
[2:22:31] cooperated in all of the activities that
[2:22:33] I
[2:22:36] attend and the day that she
[2:22:39] leaves I'm going to be left with limp in
[2:22:43] my
[2:22:44] walk and if I
[2:22:46] leave I'm coming for
[2:22:49] her
[2:22:55] and so since it's been three
[2:23:00] years I just want you to understand that
[2:23:03] it's good to remember certain
[2:23:06] things about how God has helped
[2:23:12] us since we started here in this
[2:23:19] place brother Johnny told me that he had
[2:23:21] a job to
[2:23:30] do and later on we came into an
[2:23:32] agreement that if I could uh have this
[2:23:35] prayer service between 10 to 11:
[2:23:38] a.m. every
[2:23:41] Monday from 10 to
[2:23:44] 11 just one
[2:23:47] hour to dedicated to meditation
[2:23:52] to pray in
[2:23:55] silence and God has done great
[2:24:02] things and in those times that we've had
[2:24:08] prayer there's many testimonies even
[2:24:11] amongst
[2:24:13] you that have given testimony about
[2:24:16] being
[2:24:19] healed
[2:24:21] because if there is an hour to be
[2:24:22] dedicated to
[2:24:24] prayer we must take advantage of
[2:24:29] it and then every time that we finish in
[2:24:32] that
[2:24:34] hour I as an
[2:24:38] elder and the person in charge of the
[2:24:41] prayer
[2:24:48] service alongside with my brother here
[2:24:51] that helps me
[2:24:55] brother this brother has been a great
[2:24:57] help to
[2:24:59] me he is
[2:25:04] [Music]
[2:25:06] aacon so then he has the authority to
[2:25:09] anoint the people with
[2:25:12] oil because after the
[2:25:16] prayer I pray for the brothers that come
[2:25:18] in sick
[2:25:21] or that are
[2:25:23] sick or that have a
[2:25:27] need because I see that people come
[2:25:34] here and I hear the people come and tell
[2:25:36] me brother T please pray for my husband
[2:25:39] who is in
[2:25:42] prison and you know when a mother or a
[2:25:44] wife is
[2:25:48] asking then you have to give kind of
[2:25:50] words of
[2:25:53] encouragement God has answered thanks be
[2:25:58] to or if somebody has a sick family
[2:26:01] member at
[2:26:03] home we pray for them as
[2:26:07] well and we can also go to your home if
[2:26:10] you invite
[2:26:13] me whatever time is lotted we can go and
[2:26:17] visit and pray for that person that's
[2:26:20] sick
[2:26:23] and by God's grace he has accompanied
[2:26:26] us and there have been many
[2:26:30] testimonies where brothers and sisters
[2:26:32] have healed from
[2:26:35] cancer of
[2:26:39] nervousness of
[2:26:44] fear of many different
[2:26:49] sicknesses
[2:26:50] and we have here many
[2:26:53] testimonies between or amongst
[2:26:56] us that have been
[2:26:59] delivered of a demon called
[2:27:05] cancer because that's one of the great
[2:27:08] demons that are empowering themselves
[2:27:10] here on
[2:27:12] Earth and the prophet said that the day
[2:27:15] would
[2:27:16] come that
[2:27:18] cancer would be like a
[2:27:21] toothache how many of you have ever had
[2:27:23] a
[2:27:25] toothache it's something tremendous
[2:27:31] right and in another occasion he said in
[2:27:34] World War
[2:27:36] II so that over 200 million demons were
[2:27:39] set
[2:27:41] free unto
[2:27:46] humanity and those are the ones that are
[2:27:49] are tormenting many of
[2:27:52] us but the prayer of the
[2:27:56] just the word of God the God
[2:28:00] says shall heal the
[2:28:03] sick and the Lord shall raise him
[2:28:06] up the Lord raises him up not
[2:28:11] me God gives him the healing not
[2:28:14] me the only thing that I tell him is
[2:28:16] that when I
[2:28:18] pray I pray
[2:28:22] believing I I don't go in the prayer
[2:28:24] saying oh hopefully he
[2:28:26] can I believe it with all my
[2:28:30] heart that the power of the spoken
[2:28:32] word is in
[2:28:36] us because since the beginning it was
[2:28:38] given in that
[2:28:41] manner man was made in the the likeness
[2:28:44] of
[2:28:46] God and he gave him the power of the
[2:28:48] spoken word
[2:28:52] and man named all the beasts on the in
[2:28:55] the
[2:28:57] land you shall be called elephant and
[2:29:01] giraffe you this and
[2:29:05] that and the names that you hear right
[2:29:08] now from the
[2:29:10] animals the man that was uh made out of
[2:29:14] clay he spoke
[2:29:18] his and gave the power of the spoken
[2:29:21] word and until
[2:29:24] today those names are still set in
[2:29:29] place and we are now living in the time
[2:29:31] of
[2:29:34] restoration where we will go back to the
[2:29:36] original
[2:29:39] restoration when the bride shall then
[2:29:42] dress
[2:29:43] herself and
[2:29:46] restore back to her original
[2:29:49] state
[2:29:50] because the scriptures
[2:29:54] say about a
[2:29:57] virgin that he shall have a uh virgin
[2:30:00] without any spot or
[2:30:02] wrinkle who the Lord Jesus
[2:30:06] Christ because back in the beginning the
[2:30:08] first
[2:30:09] Adam was unto
[2:30:12] death but the later
[2:30:16] Adam is unto eternal
[2:30:18] life
[2:30:20] and whoever has believed in the Lord
[2:30:21] Jesus
[2:30:23] Christ shall return back to eternal
[2:30:27] life and when we have
[2:30:30] prayed on
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:35] Mondays there's been a couple of
[2:30:38] brothers and sisters here that have
[2:30:39] given
[2:30:48] testimony
[2:30:52] and if you would come to me and ask if
[2:30:54] you can say a couple of those
[2:30:55] testimonies I would say that we were
[2:30:57] very short on time to be able to express
[2:30:59] all of
[2:31:02] them so we just want you to know that
[2:31:04] the prayers that we do are not in
[2:31:07] vain and it and it has been three
[2:31:18] years and I said say unto the Lord
[2:31:23] Lord why do the sick get
[2:31:27] healed why are there so many
[2:31:30] healings and Lord please uh don't forget
[2:31:34] about
[2:31:36] me and he told me in a
[2:31:39] dream I'll take it
[2:31:41] away but I'll put another one
[2:31:44] on and I say oh God
[2:31:48] no just as I am
[2:31:50] [Music]
[2:31:53] in other occasions I'm I'm happy just
[2:31:55] the way I
[2:31:57] am all every man that's
[2:32:02] called has a stumbling Stone before
[2:32:06] them and he showed me St
[2:32:10] Paul and various
[2:32:15] people even unto Jesus they told
[2:32:18] them you who healed the sick
[2:32:22] why don't you heal
[2:32:24] yourself and they just told him
[2:32:27] that and so then who am
[2:32:30] I to change the word of
[2:32:34] God I only
[2:32:37] believe that if I pray for the
[2:32:41] sick the demons will
[2:32:44] obey because that's what they were made
[2:32:48] for go and preach the gospel to every
[2:32:51] living
[2:32:53] creature he that believeth and was
[2:32:55] baptized shall be
[2:32:57] saved and who didn't shall be
[2:33:02] condemned and these
[2:33:04] signs shall follow them that
[2:33:07] believe in my name shall they cast out
[2:33:10] Devils to speak in new
[2:33:14] tongues and if they should eat any
[2:33:16] deadly thing it should not harm
[2:33:18] them
[2:33:21] and upon the sick they shall lay their
[2:33:23] hands and they shall be
[2:33:26] healed do you believe it
[2:33:35] Brothers if
[2:33:38] anybody if there's anybody here who God
[2:33:41] has answered prayer
[2:33:43] here and your brother your sister your
[2:33:46] son and
[2:33:48] yourself mind raising your hand because
[2:33:50] of the Grateful one thanks
[2:33:55] God there was a sister that once came
[2:33:58] from
[2:34:00] Durango and was here on a
[2:34:04] Monday and she gave a testimony that she
[2:34:06] was healed from
[2:34:08] cancer but over the
[2:34:17] phone uh and it was a tremendous
[2:34:19] testimony because the the doctors had
[2:34:20] given up all hope on
[2:34:27] her and she was healed in the manner
[2:34:29] that doctors couldn't even explain
[2:34:32] it and we have so many of
[2:34:36] those and the past week or so the last
[2:34:39] person that was
[2:34:41] here
[2:34:43] from she gave us
[2:34:48] testimony
[2:34:50] that she was delivered from a demon that
[2:34:52] was tormenting her with fear of
[2:34:56] panic and God delivered
[2:35:00] her and she was here visiting
[2:35:04] us she's a family member of one of our
[2:35:07] uh members of the
[2:35:10] congregation and So within the past
[2:35:12] three
[2:35:14] years we have used every
[2:35:18] Monday
[2:35:20] from 10:00 a.m. to 11:
[2:35:29] a.m. and so in that matter this is just
[2:35:31] an invitation for anybody who would like
[2:35:32] to visit us Monday
[2:35:36] mornings only one time I
[2:35:43] failed and that was because of a
[2:35:45] misunderstanding of reporting
[2:35:48] themselves
[2:35:50] but I have fulfilled every Monday for
[2:35:53] the past three
[2:35:55] years and being
[2:36:00] here and so we give all the honor and
[2:36:02] glory to our Lord Jesus
[2:36:05] Christ and I want to tell you one
[2:36:11] thing because of time I can't say
[2:36:14] everything but I do want to say one
[2:36:17] thing that we have to Crown our
[2:36:19] ourselves with that Divine
[2:36:22] love that we may reach up to that
[2:36:26] point that you can pray for your
[2:36:29] enemy for that who that person who
[2:36:32] persecutes you who speaks evil of
[2:36:36] you how many of us are
[2:36:39] willing to lift up our
[2:36:43] prayer and ask the Lord to forgive
[2:36:47] us for not forgiving our
[2:36:52] enemies or for not asking for a blessing
[2:36:54] for our
[2:36:56] enemies brother T you're
[2:37:02] crazy well that's the type of sincerity
[2:37:04] that has to be in the
[2:37:06] believer that we can
[2:37:09] recognize that our
[2:37:11] prayer is something really
[2:37:14] special if you can forgive your
[2:37:18] enemies you are are part of God's
[2:37:21] seed you are a child of
[2:37:25] [Music]
[2:37:26] God I pray in the
[2:37:28] mornings or at
[2:37:32] nights the first thing I do is pray for
[2:37:34] my sons and
[2:37:37] daughters for my children my
[2:37:39] grandchildren my great-grandchildren
[2:37:42] my brothers and
[2:37:46] church and all those beloved brothers
[2:37:49] that live far
[2:37:52] off for our deacons and
[2:37:56] pastors I don't do it to try to show
[2:38:01] off but I do it considering the kind of
[2:38:04] pressure that they're all
[2:38:05] in because a
[2:38:07] church is the same as a
[2:38:11] home the same
[2:38:14] thing and just consider what would what
[2:38:17] would you do if the pastor
[2:38:21] how he has treated his
[2:38:23] home how he has managed his
[2:38:27] home that's how he would manage a
[2:38:31] church job was rightness was righteous
[2:38:34] and
[2:38:36] upright and he would pray for his
[2:38:39] children for any that would have
[2:38:42] possibly committed
[2:38:45] sin and that's the way that we have to
[2:38:47] do it with our
[2:38:48] children
[2:38:50] I don't know I have six
[2:38:53] children I lift up my hands and I pray
[2:38:55] for
[2:38:57] them asking for Mercy for
[2:39:01] them forgive them Lord for their
[2:39:04] sins for their
[2:39:07] mistakes and whatever they may have
[2:39:10] done for my
[2:39:13] kids I claim them
[2:39:16] Father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:39:18] Christ
[2:39:21] and in that same
[2:39:22] manner each and every one of you should
[2:39:24] do it at
[2:39:29] home and love should be unto that
[2:39:31] perfect love that which is going to
[2:39:32] Crown the
[2:39:36] pyramid you're not going to be crowned
[2:39:38] with so much
[2:39:40] intelligence you're going to be crowned
[2:39:42] by
[2:39:43] faith may the Lord bless you and thank
[2:39:48] you
[2:40:07] may the Lord bless our brother
[2:40:09] Tanis and may the Lord give him more
[2:40:14] strength we've come to the part of
[2:40:16] dismissing the
[2:40:18] service
[2:40:20] but not before giving you a couple of
[2:40:32] announcements just a quick reminder that
[2:40:34] our Wednesday service doors open at 700
[2:40:36] p.m. and our service starts at 7:30

[2:40:56] so we can have a special service for the
[2:40:58] Good Friday on the 29th of March
[2:41:01] Amen Let Us bow our
[2:41:04] heads loving Heavenly
[2:41:11] Father we give you thanks once again for
[2:41:13] the Sunday that you have provided for
[2:41:14] [Music]

[2:41:36] us and that it may be something
[2:41:38] beneficial into our
[2:41:42] walk and waiting until the day that you
[2:41:45] come back for
[2:41:46] [Music]
[2:41:47] us we ask that you dismiss us from this

[2:41:51] place but never from your presence
[2:41:56] Lord and may your presence be with us
