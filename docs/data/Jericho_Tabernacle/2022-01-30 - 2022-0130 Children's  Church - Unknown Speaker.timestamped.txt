[39:21] so moses's father and mother were
[39:24] amram and yukabe
[39:34] hope to god because he had thought that
[39:36] god wouldn't hear him
[39:44] they were all enslaved and
[39:46] worked very hard
[39:51] abraham's job was to put bricks into a
[39:54] furnace
[40:05] says that we should never give up on
[40:07] praying even when times are tough
[40:17] one night pharaoh had a council meeting
[40:29] and he ordered to kill every boy due to
[40:32] increasing slaves
[40:36] hombres
[40:42] oh
[40:59] sometimes god takes time to answer
[41:02] prayers
[41:08] one important night there came an angel
[41:10] down to amram's room
[41:20] and said that he would have a baby named
[41:23] moses
[41:29] and he also showed him north which would
[41:32] lead him to the promised land
[41:40] and told amram that baby
[41:42] would be the deliverer to all the slaves
[42:00] the next day abram was motivated to work
[42:03] because he knew that god had hurt him
[42:15] a contested passes and
[42:17] brother branham said the cutest little
[42:19] darling what was adorable
[42:28] okay
[42:35] he was
[42:36] born
[42:38] but they had to hide him because of the
[42:40] witches killing every baby boy
[42:51] and sure enough came the motherlessly
[42:54] loving witches
[42:56] either
[43:13] [Music]
[43:23] say left slamming doors shut
[43:29] so then night comes and amram slept
[43:38] and had an important dream making a
[43:40] basket for the baby
[43:47] to float along the nile river so the
[43:49] next day at night he starts working on
[44:06] what do you think is going on at this
[44:09] time
[44:12] hallelujah hallelujah you know when
[44:15] things go on

[48:57] no crocodile touch to that cargo
[49:20] it shall be done the trumpet sounded and
[49:22] ten thousand angels came down
[49:32] when you keep it you lose it due to the
[49:34] temptations and the witches from hello
[49:46] but if you give it to god it will be
[49:48] safely stored for eternal life
[50:00] and so the choice that emirate chose was
[50:03] to deliver it to god
[50:11] give it to god and
[50:13] brother branham said
[50:15] adios
[50:17] it was the most precious cargo called it

[54:13] then announce to him
[54:15] the lord the god of the hebrews has sent
[54:18] me to tell you
[54:22] let my people go so this is what the
[54:24] lord says

[54:31] with this staff in my hand and the river
[54:34] will turn into blood
[54:42] let my people go
[54:53] and the water turned into blood
[54:56] but that blood in the river it stayed
[54:58] water for seven whole days where nobody
[55:01] could drink the water nobody could jump
[55:04] into the water and it smelled really bad
[55:06] the bible says that the fishes were
[55:08] dying left and right all across the
[55:10] river there was no more way to make mon
[55:12] posole we couldn't make any menudo
[55:14] there's no more way to make some
[55:16] frijoles because the water had turned
[55:18] into blood but pharaoh he was still as
[55:22] stubborn as can be
[55:24] he did not let the people go so god had
[55:27] to come and bring yet another plague
[55:29] upon egypt does anyone know what that
[55:31] plague was yes it was frogs that's
[55:35] absolutely right the bible says then
[55:38] then the lord said unto moses go to
[55:40] pharaoh and announce to him
[55:44] let my people go and if you refuse i'm
[55:46] gonna send a plague of frogs in the nile
[55:49] and swarm and come out of the river and

[56:04] they're everywhere
[56:06] oh no
[56:12] and then the frogs disappeared
[56:15] but pharaoh
[56:16] was still as stubborn as could be
[56:19] he did not let the people go
[56:22] so god had to bring yet another plague
[56:25] and the bible says
[56:27] then the lord told moses get up early in
[56:30] the morning
[56:32] and stand in pharaoh's way right down by
[56:34] the river and say to him
[56:37] this is what the lord says
[56:41] and if you refuse then i will send

[57:51] deadly plague where the animals would
[57:53] start to fall over and die and get very
[57:57] very sick
[57:58] but god still didn't stop there
[58:01] the bible says
[58:02] then the lord said to moses and aaron
[58:05] take a big handful of ashes from the
[58:08] brick furnace
[58:09] and go have moses
[58:11] toss it in the air towards pharaoh as

[58:46] so tomorrow at this time i will send a
[58:49] hailstorm more devastating than any in
[58:52] all the history of egypt
[58:54] that so moses lifted his staff to the
[58:56] sky and thunder and hail and lightning
[59:00] flashed towards the earth and the lord
[59:02] sent a tremendous hailstorm across egypt
[59:05] that destroyed the entire land
[59:08] but i'm sure you can guess
[59:10] pharaoh was still as stubborn as could
[59:13] be
[59:14] he did not let the people go
[59:18] the bible says
[59:20] so moses and aaron
[59:22] they walked out and went unto pharaoh
[59:25] and they said
[59:27] this is what the lord the god of the
[59:29] hebrew says
[59:32] how long will you refuse to listen to
[59:34] the lord
[59:37] let my people go so that they can
[59:39] worship me and if you don't listen
[59:43] and watch out for tomorrow
[59:45] i will bring a swarm of locusts upon
[59:48] your country
[59:49] locusts that will cover the entire land
[59:52] to where you won't even be able to see
[59:54] they'll eat up all your crops
[59:58] we here in locust running around all
[1:00:01] right
[1:00:02] back here
[1:00:04] underneath i think they're in the back
[1:00:06] of the church they're back there
[1:00:08] oh there come the locust
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:16] and pharaoh saw
[1:00:17] the frogs
[1:00:19] he saw the river
[1:00:21] he saw the hailstorms his people
[1:00:24] suffering from the boils
[1:00:25] but still a stubborn face upon pharaoh
[1:00:29] he would not let the people of israel go
[1:00:32] so god had to send another plague
[1:00:35] the bible says then the lord said to
[1:00:38] moses
[1:00:39] lift your hand toward heaven and the
[1:00:42] land of egypt will be covered with
[1:00:44] darkness
[1:00:45] darkness so thick that you can't even
[1:00:48] feel it
[1:00:49] so moses lifted his hand to the sky and
[1:00:52] the darkness covered the entire land
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:02] and it covered the entire land for three
[1:01:05] days
[1:01:06] but during all that time
[1:01:08] the people could not see each other and
[1:01:10] no one moved but there was light
[1:01:14] there was light in the land of goshen
[1:01:17] where the people of israel they lived
[1:01:19] and they were protected by god
[1:01:22] himself where he would watch over them
[1:01:25] and none of these plays got over them
[1:01:27] before the egyptians
[1:01:29] it was so dark there was no school
[1:01:31] there was no work there was no play time
[1:01:34] after the third day
[1:01:36] that darkness was over
[1:01:40] but then something very special happened
[1:01:44] really special in the scriptures
[1:01:47] the bible says
[1:01:49] then moses said
[1:01:51] go pick out a lamb
[1:01:53] a little young goat for each of your
[1:01:55] families
[1:01:56] and slaughter the little passover animal
[1:01:59] and then take a bundle of hyssop
[1:02:02] branches
[1:02:03] and dip it into that blood
[1:02:05] and then i want you to brush it across
[1:02:08] the tops and the sides of your door
[1:02:10] frames of your houses
[1:02:12] for the bible says for the lord will
[1:02:14] pass through the land to strike down the
[1:02:17] egyptians but when he sees the blood
[1:02:21] that blood on the door frames
[1:02:23] he will not permit that death angel to
[1:02:26] enter your house and to strike you down
[1:02:29] so now everyone i'm gonna need your help
[1:02:31] okay
[1:02:32] and we can all do this together can you
[1:02:34] all grab that paint brush you can all
[1:02:36] grab that paintbrush and let's dip it
[1:02:39] into that blood
[1:02:40] mix it up real nice and let's paint that
[1:02:43] door frame up and down up and down and
[1:02:46] get it ready because shortly after the
[1:02:50] bible says
[1:02:51] that moses had announced to pharaoh
[1:02:54] this
[1:02:56] this is what the lord says
[1:02:59] at midnight tonight
[1:03:01] i will pass through the land of egypt
[1:03:04] and all the firstborn sons will die in
[1:03:07] every family in egypt from the oldest
[1:03:10] son of pharaoh who sits on that throne
[1:03:14] to the oldest son of the lowliest
[1:03:16] servant girl who grinds the flower
[1:03:19] even the firstborns of all the animals
[1:03:22] will die
[1:03:23] and then a loud whale will arise
[1:03:25] throughout the land of egypt no
[1:03:28] my son he's dead
[1:03:32] the death angel came upon egypt because
[1:03:35] of pharaoh's stubbornness
[1:03:38] that is why
[1:03:39] it's good to listen to the word of god
[1:03:42] and always heed to his word and his
[1:03:45] message that's been brought for you
[1:03:46] little ones
[1:03:48] the lamb's blood on the doorpost
[1:03:50] that represented the blood of jesus
[1:03:52] christ for us
[1:03:53] it was a token it was a sign of his
[1:03:55] protection
[1:03:57] and god protected the israelites back
[1:03:59] then
[1:04:00] from all the plagues
[1:04:02] but right now god is protecting us
[1:04:04] through jesus christ the blood was a
[1:04:07] sign on the door
[1:04:08] that the death angel you're not welcome
[1:04:10] in my house but the blood of jesus on my
[1:04:14] heart
[1:04:14] is telling the devil devil you're not
[1:04:17] welcome here
[1:04:18] you're not welcome in my home
[1:04:20] sin you're not welcome here you're not
[1:04:23] welcome in my life
[1:04:25] so if you'd all please stand with me
[1:04:28] if you want to apply the blood of jesus
[1:04:30] to your heart
[1:04:31] please stand raise your hands
