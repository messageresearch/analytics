[1:15:19] father we put you before all things this
[1:15:22] morning
[1:15:25] and we ask that you take full control of
[1:15:27] this service
[1:15:31] lord calm my nerves and may it be you
[1:15:33] speaking this morning

[1:15:44] amen you may be seated
[1:15:50] once again i greet you all in the name
[1:15:52] of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:58] it was uh of a surprise and a pleasure
[1:16:00] to see brother osorio and the youth from
[1:16:02] tucson
[1:16:03] as i pulled in
[1:16:19] just when i thought my nerves couldn't
[1:16:21] get any stronger
[1:16:26] then i saw the brother and then the
[1:16:28] pressure got on
[1:16:29] her but
[1:16:32] let's trust in the lord this morning
[1:16:36] uh as i had mentioned we're going to be
[1:16:38] continuing on from brother what brother
[1:16:40] luis brought us last week
[1:16:46] and i i sound like a broken record
[1:16:49] sometimes
[1:16:52] but i just like to remind myself
[1:16:57] that i i don't too much get into these
[1:17:00] deep things
[1:17:04] or these deep revelations
[1:17:07] but i like to share or speak upon but
[1:17:12] upon what god has done for me
[1:17:15] of the grace that he's given unto me
[1:17:19] of the small portion he's given unto me
[1:17:22] that i might be able to share that unto
[1:17:24] another parque la poda
[1:17:26] and therefore we have the title this
[1:17:28] morning
[1:17:32] the simple message that our prophet
[1:17:33] preached
[1:17:37] faith by experience and in listening to
[1:17:41] this message
[1:17:45] yeah things just came kept coming out to
[1:17:47] me and out to me
[1:17:50] and i just followed along that sequence
[1:17:52] as brother branham was preaching
[1:17:57] and i believe for the most part we all
[1:17:59] know the story of david and goliath
[1:18:05] if anyone doesn't you might learn a
[1:18:06] little to this morning
[1:18:11] we know how the armies of israel
[1:18:16] israel were ready and out at war versus
[1:18:19] the armies of the philistines
[1:18:24] now the army or the soldiers of israel
[1:18:29] israel these weren't pagans
[1:18:32] these weren't heathens these weren't
[1:18:34] unbelievers
[1:18:36] incredulous these were believers like
[1:18:38] you and i
[1:18:41] could say us as well we are soldiers
[1:18:45] we are of the army of the lord
[1:18:49] and and thus these were the same
[1:18:51] believers soldiers in the army of israel
[1:18:58] and i believe here this morning
[1:19:01] that everyone in here is a believer of
[1:19:04] this end-time message
[1:19:34] and the hour of our day
[1:19:38] now in this message brother branham says
[1:19:40] and it is
[1:19:41] that there's a difference between an
[1:19:43] intellectual faith
[1:19:47] intellectual and a god
[1:20:04] and he expresses sternly that's nothing
[1:20:06] but the intellectuals
[1:20:10] intellectual so in thinking of that
[1:20:13] and then looking upon the soldiers of
[1:20:15] israel miranda
[1:20:18] they were just trusting on that
[1:20:19] intellectual faith that they had
[1:20:21] solamento
[1:20:23] intellectuals sometimes unfortunately
[1:20:25] some of us have trusted on that
[1:20:27] intellectual faith we have
[1:20:44] even the man-made weapons that had
[1:20:46] helped them defeat armies before
[1:20:49] las armas problems
[1:20:53] but nothing that they had on the
[1:20:55] exterior or on the outside
[1:21:06] what was good enough or strong enough to
[1:21:09] defeat this goliath
[1:21:25] those goliaths like brother louis spoke
[1:21:27] on last week
[1:21:31] the goliaths you might be battling in
[1:21:33] your life today
[1:21:37] you don't have that god sent faith
[1:22:07] he said all these things that i thought
[1:22:09] that i knew
[1:22:13] i didn't know anything until he had that
[1:22:17] faith by experience
[1:22:21] and now this man has been on fire day
[1:22:23] after day
[1:22:26] because it takes an experience
[1:22:30] a genuine experience of god an
[1:22:32] experience
[1:22:34] one that will bring about that faith
[1:22:38] and produce a miracle like this produce
[1:22:42] a produce a miracle like you this
[1:22:44] morning
[1:22:47] amen amen
[1:22:50] going back to david and goliath
[1:22:53] from the king on down to the very last
[1:22:56] soldier
[1:22:58] collectively all of them collectively
[1:23:01] probably looking around they saw that no
[1:23:04] one was worthy or capable of defeating
[1:23:06] this goliath
[1:23:12] from the strongest to the smartest ah
[1:23:17] but what a difference what a
[1:23:20] huge difference it is
[1:23:24] when the person has that faith
[1:23:28] when that person has that faith it gives
[1:23:30] them the confidence
[1:23:46] that they've already won the battle yeah
[1:23:49] and this was the case with david
[1:23:51] yesterday
[1:23:53] i want to read from the message of the
[1:23:54] power of god
[1:23:58] brother branham says what are eyes of
[1:24:01] faith
[1:24:03] what a power that faith has
[1:24:06] it goes so far beyond the devil's power
[1:24:12] the devil takes you to death
[1:24:29] el senor perdura we too one day will die
[1:24:31] on this earth
[1:24:34] so the devil's just showing us something
[1:24:36] we already know
[1:24:40] but listen to what brother branham says
[1:25:04] so faith is much more powerful than
[1:25:07] anything the devil has
[1:25:25] listen that's the way it is today
[1:25:30] it doesn't take an education
[1:25:33] it doesn't take a lot of thinking
[1:25:36] it takes a humble heart who's been
[1:25:39] dedicated
[1:25:40] to the power of the resurrection of
[1:25:42] christ
[1:25:50] and filled with the holy ghost
[1:25:54] that's the key right there and filled
[1:25:57] with the holy ghost
[1:26:01] that's something each and every one of
[1:26:03] us need to look in that mirror
[1:26:06] is
[1:26:18] now that's what they're talking about
[1:26:20] the one that knows what they're talking
[1:26:21] about
[1:26:25] speaking of david your servant will go
[1:26:29] fight him now
[1:26:32] this wasn't king david
[1:26:46] someone who had no business on the
[1:26:48] battlefield
[1:27:08] and he had that experience and now that
[1:27:10] conviction
[1:27:12] is a conviction to know that god was on
[1:27:15] his side
[1:27:44] of what real faith is
[1:27:47] of a real faith in god
[1:27:50] then maybe they might open up and wake
[1:27:53] up
[1:27:55] and obtain of that same faith
[1:28:14] like you all know the intellectual
[1:28:17] shield
[1:28:18] intellectual the theological sword
[1:28:22] that intellectual helmet intellectual
[1:28:25] and common sense tells me
[1:28:29] and i think if you read it you know with
[1:28:31] common sense
[1:28:34] that if that intellectual faith didn't
[1:28:36] help those soldiers
[1:28:41] what made them think that it was going
[1:28:42] to do anything for david
[1:28:44] pence he said no no i don't want that
[1:28:50] i don't need that no necessity it's
[1:28:52] going to hold me down
[1:28:53] okay it's going to set
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:20] that is why we need of that holy ghost
[1:29:34] yes brother branham says in the same
[1:29:35] message faith by experience
[1:29:39] for a little bit of encouragement
[1:29:43] speaking about moses now when he was 80
[1:29:47] years old
[1:29:49] he knowed more about god in five minutes
[1:29:55] in the presence of that bush
[1:29:58] then he learned in 80 years in the
[1:30:00] schools of egypt
[1:30:04] what moses lacked
[1:30:07] the bush hat what our educated
[1:30:10] conception lacks
[1:30:14] the holy ghost hasanto
[1:30:20] and i was listening to this message yes
[1:30:22] and as i was in the broom
[1:30:24] and brother branham has said something
[1:30:28] that it brought me to a chuckle or
[1:30:30] laughter
[1:31:00] so if we can bring that a little closer
[1:31:01] to us
[1:31:04] and i don't want to hurt any feelings
[1:31:07] nor do i want to be too religious
[1:31:11] but we don't need a messageology but
[1:31:30] you know i've shared my testimony here
[1:31:32] but doing all those things
[1:31:36] within that time frame that i was out in
[1:31:38] the world
[1:31:41] i had gone to church maybe a handful of
[1:31:43] times five or six
[1:31:45] verses and don't think that it was a
[1:31:50] church of the message
[1:31:52] because i was trying to get as far away
[1:31:54] as i could
[1:31:58] but i'd get invited to a baptist church
[1:32:00] in an apostolic church
[1:32:03] i went to a catholic church a couple of
[1:32:05] times
[1:32:08] and i had so much of that messageology
[1:32:10] in me
[1:32:25] the woman preacher goes up
[1:32:28] and i'm already criticizing critic
[1:32:31] one thing is out of order and i was
[1:32:34] already criticized
[1:32:36] and what good did it do me to sit in
[1:32:38] church
[1:32:52] if i didn't have a new birth experience
[1:32:54] in me
[1:32:58] all this doctrine all this theology
[1:33:01] but nothing on the inside there was no
[1:33:05] fire
[1:33:05] on the inside fuego i repeat again for
[1:33:09] my brother emmanuel
[1:33:11] manuel all the things that he knew
[1:33:14] but he didn't know nothing until he had
[1:33:18] his
[1:33:18] own experience of faith
[1:33:28] i'd rather have the right spirit in the
[1:33:30] wrong doctrine
[1:33:34] than the right doctrine and the wrong
[1:33:36] spirit
[1:33:38] incorrect and what is that spirit that
[1:33:41] is god's own spirit the holy spirit
[1:33:46] that spirit of love is the spirit that
[1:34:02] with no experience of faith scene
[1:34:04] experience
[1:34:06] what i needed in my life
[1:34:09] was some hardcore neology
[1:34:12] extrema i needed to be born again
[1:34:16] i needed
[1:34:41] i was reading the story of paul on the
[1:34:43] road to damascus on the road of damascus
[1:34:48] and as i was going through the
[1:34:49] scriptures
[1:34:52] uh once again you all know the story one
[1:34:55] of his masters
[1:34:57] how he was struck down by that light
[1:35:00] and i was followed by a voice
[1:35:04] and if you read paul addresses that
[1:35:07] voice
[1:35:11] by using the term lord
[1:35:19] that paul knew that that was a
[1:35:21] supernatural quest
[1:35:24] paul knew that that was the pillar of
[1:35:26] fire
[1:35:39] like sometimes it might happen to you
[1:35:43] like it happens to the young people like
[1:35:46] it happened to me
[1:35:49] to know god intellectually like paul did
[1:35:52] intellectually but he didn't know but
[1:35:56] that the father son and holy ghost
[1:36:01] what he didn't know was the revelation
[1:36:04] of jesus christ
[1:36:07] for himself but he too had to have a
[1:36:10] faith by experience
[1:36:14] and i don't know why sometimes that's
[1:36:15] young people
[1:36:18] why we get so stubborn
[1:36:21] because if you read for yourselves and
[1:36:23] go back to that story of paul
[1:36:27] pablo when the voice spoke to him
[1:36:31] there wasn't much that was said
[1:36:34] there wasn't no bible study given about
[1:36:36] from that
[1:37:18] i am jesus whom thou persecutes jos
[1:37:22] jesus and that's all it took for paul
[1:37:28] he surrendered everything at that moment
[1:37:32] what should i do lord senor que devo
[1:37:34] said where should i go lord i don't
[1:37:36] know what do you want from me lord do
[1:37:38] what you will with my life lord i look
[1:37:40] at
[1:37:40] me take me i'm yours he got a revelation
[1:37:44] at that moment it is
[1:38:01] the titles of that voice of god are
[1:38:03] enough preaching to us
[1:38:08] faith by experience faith
[1:38:11] is the substance faith
[1:38:28] wisdom
[1:38:39] oh i could just read those titles and it
[1:38:40] speaks to my heart so loudly
[1:38:49] going back in my life nine years ago
[1:38:54] as i read the story of paula
[1:38:57] it says that there were men that were
[1:38:59] with paul
[1:39:03] and in the midst of what was taking
[1:39:05] place
[1:39:07] the bible says that these men they heard
[1:39:09] a voice
[1:39:24] but it says that they heard the voice
[1:39:28] and going back nine years ago in my life
[1:39:32] i go back to that sunday morning
[1:39:36] when my wife received her new birthday
[1:39:43] and when i seen the first miracle right
[1:39:46] in living color before my eyes
[1:39:51] in a building just like this
[1:39:55] everyone in the building they heard the
[1:39:58] voice
[1:39:59] they heard the preaching oh yeah they
[1:40:02] heard god's word
[1:40:04] but there was only one
[1:40:18] of all those that heard the voice
[1:40:34] this morning
[1:40:48] then god's word is not in vain
[1:40:51] that pillar of fire wasn't for all those
[1:40:54] on the road to damascus
[1:40:58] that pillar of fire wasn't for everyone
[1:41:00] that morning nine years ago
[1:41:32] because it's here for you
[1:41:36] and you're hearing that voice
[1:41:39] the voice of god
[1:41:44] amen in the message faith by experience
[1:41:48] going back
[1:41:52] it was somewhere along the middle of the
[1:41:54] message
[1:41:56] that it almost seems like brother
[1:41:58] branham says something a little random
[1:42:00] this parenthesis
[1:42:03] but uh nothing is a coincidence with god
[1:42:07] god knows what he's saying when he says
[1:42:09] it and to who he's saying
[1:42:13] and it once more took me back to my
[1:42:16] memory
[1:42:19] it says that afternoon
[1:42:23] at a holiness church
[1:42:27] and now let's emphasize whether random
[1:42:29] says a holiness church
[1:42:34] so i'm assuming back then that was
[1:42:36] probably the holiest that there was at
[1:42:38] the time
[1:42:43] he says he wanted to introduce me to his
[1:42:45] wife
[1:42:48] and this was a young man from the church
[1:42:52] and i tell you i'm not making fun of
[1:42:54] anybody
[1:43:05] and great big long earrings
[1:43:18] i said well she looks like a hate to me
[1:43:22] foreign she looks like a hint to me
[1:43:25] diablo well brother branham says
[1:43:29] i don't say that for a joke
[1:43:33] i mean that's the truth
[1:43:36] now
[1:44:02] i'm just telling you the conditions of
[1:44:04] the church and what we need
[1:44:09] so as i heard this uh
[1:44:12] in the privacy of just me and my wife
[1:44:16] i believe we were driving in the car one
[1:44:18] day
[1:44:30] uh we've got a long road ahead
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:56] are you going to turn into them sisters
[1:45:00] that instead of getting older and
[1:45:03] it seems like they're getting younger
[1:45:04] but
[1:45:06] she kind of got a little startled
[1:45:09] i said you know those dresses start
[1:45:11] getting a little tighter
[1:45:15] that hair color starts getting a little
[1:45:17] brighter
[1:45:20] those lips are getting a lot more
[1:45:21] shinier
[1:45:24] and those heels keep getting a little
[1:45:26] taller
[1:45:28] and all that makeup on your face just
[1:45:30] makes them look so young
[1:45:35] where it seems like the older they get
[1:45:37] and pares
[1:45:40] the sexier they want to look sexy
[1:45:43] and so she answered me said oh no no
[1:45:46] that's ridiculous
[1:45:49] if you ever see me get in that state
[1:45:53] you can go ahead and slap me back into
[1:45:55] my senses
[1:46:07] i believe with all my heart she'll fight
[1:46:09] for that to be true
[1:46:25] a long journey
[1:46:28] where many have fallen muchosan
[1:46:32] where many have gone astray
[1:46:37] the ones that we love
[1:46:51] but we need to continue on that road
[1:46:58] and my dad uses the expression
[1:47:02] expression when he talks to me
[1:47:05] when he advises me
[1:47:09] he tells me careful son
[1:47:16] the bigger they are the harder they fall
[1:47:20] so in other words
[1:47:23] in other words holy ghost or not
[1:47:28] you still need to feed your spirit more
[1:47:31] than the flesh
[1:47:34] el espiritu
[1:47:46] it's a daily fight
[1:47:50] sometimes it's not easy this is fussy
[1:47:52] but we've got to keep on fighting
[1:47:59] so i don't mean to attack the sisters or
[1:48:02] the women no
[1:48:02] it's that's why i use
[1:48:07] myself and my wife as an example
[1:48:12] because i'm not the exception
[1:48:15] she's not the exception none of us
[1:48:18] are the exception we all can fall
[1:48:24] but we need to make sure that we have
[1:48:26] received that holy ghost
[1:48:31] start with that and build upon it
[1:48:35] like brother louis said last week
[1:48:39] faith is the foundation la fey is the
[1:48:42] fundamental and to build upon that
[1:48:44] difficult
[1:48:52] uh i believe it comes down to one of two
[1:48:54] things
[1:48:57] number one el somewhere along the road
[1:49:02] uh in album el camino you let sin
[1:49:05] into the camp
[1:49:09] you let sin into your home
[1:49:13] and therefore those are the fruits or
[1:49:14] the results of that sin that you let in
[1:49:18] fruit
[1:49:22] male or female ombre husband or wife
[1:49:26] now number two there was
[1:49:29] never a new birth experience to begin
[1:49:32] with
[1:49:36] without that experience
[1:49:39] you can hold on for five years
[1:49:43] you can act right for 10 years
[1:49:46] how many do we know that have acted
[1:49:47] right for 20 30 years
[1:49:53] but sooner or later
[1:50:08] like i said none of us are the exception
[1:50:14] so we need to look at ourselves in the
[1:50:16] mirror
[1:50:19] and if you need that this morning
[1:50:22] you can obtain that faith by experience
[1:50:28] now if there was never a new birth
[1:50:30] experience to begin with
[1:50:36] he or she
[1:50:40] they've just been convinced of the
[1:50:42] gospels
[1:50:45] they've been convinced of the message
[1:50:49] they have not been converted to the
[1:50:51] gospel
[1:50:54] they haven't been converted onto the
[1:50:56] message
[1:50:58] because convinced and converted
[1:51:02] they look alike just like faith and hope
[1:51:05] look alike
[1:51:08] but they're very different but different
[1:51:10] you've got to be sure of what you've got
[1:51:12] us
[1:51:17] you've had an experience you got the new
[1:51:21] bird
[1:51:23] and you know you get a little relaxed
[1:51:25] you say
[1:51:26] you get a little comfortable and then
[1:51:29] you let your guard down
[1:51:32] and the enemy comes in vienna and then
[1:51:34] sin has gotten into your life
[1:51:37] has gotten into your home it's going to
[1:51:40] be
[1:51:41] very very hard to get that sin back out
[1:51:52] [Music]
[1:52:15] we need to be careful
[1:52:19] but we're all christians here but we
[1:52:22] know there's nothing impossible for god
[1:52:27] just as easy as god can do a miracle
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:42] but then there's also progressive
[1:52:43] healing that is progressive
[1:52:46] sometimes we don't like that healing
[1:52:50] because it's just a little too
[1:52:52] progressive
[1:52:55] it's not coming fast enough for our
[1:52:57] wants
[1:53:01] but if we have faith if we've asked of
[1:53:05] god
[1:53:07] then it's already done yeah
[1:53:10] like brother johnny said last week
[1:53:14] to stop stop confessing that you're sick
[1:53:16] the the heart
[1:53:17] confess stop confessing that this is
[1:53:19] wrong with you and that's wrong with me
[1:53:23] i'm already it's already been done
[1:53:27] consumado fue my stripes i've been here
[1:53:31] let us use that foundation of faith
[1:53:35] and just build upon that
[1:53:44] but you're going to feel the pain of
[1:53:47] fighting for each and every inch
[1:53:52] so
[1:53:54] like a boxer in a 12th round victory
[1:53:59] you see them in the interview sweating
[1:54:02] from head to toe
[1:54:06] bruised cut
[1:54:20] i was in a service one morning
[1:54:23] and the brother started his preaching
[1:54:27] and he says the words we want to have a
[1:54:30] revival today
[1:54:34] i'm going to ask you all do you want to
[1:54:35] have a revival today
[1:54:39] and he says so we're going to have a
[1:54:40] revival today
[1:54:44] the brother said now a revival
[1:54:49] is to revive something that we've
[1:54:51] already got is
[1:54:54] to make it stronger to make it greater
[1:54:57] hasselhoma
[1:54:58] like the bible says to quicken
[1:54:59] commodities
[1:55:01] and what got me me the brother says
[1:55:05] but if you don't have that something to
[1:55:07] revive
[1:55:11] then you better worry about getting that
[1:55:12] something today
[1:55:17] i don't know about you those are some
[1:55:18] powerful words to me
[1:55:21] because that should open up the eyes of
[1:55:23] the sinner
[1:55:26] that should open up the eyes of the
[1:55:27] hypocrites
[1:55:30] that should open up the eyes of the
[1:55:31] make-believers
[1:55:34] why can't i get into a revival
[1:55:42] because you don't have that something to
[1:55:44] revive
[1:55:46] specifically but jesus christ is here
[1:55:49] this morning
[1:55:51] and he can give you that something to
[1:55:53] revive
[1:55:57] he can give you that experience
[1:56:00] it don't matter if you're a mother or
[1:56:01] father
[1:56:03] if you've got children or not or you're
[1:56:06] one of the young people this morning
[1:56:10] that pillar of fire is here to give you
[1:56:12] that holy ghost
[1:56:16] all you've got to do is claim it
[1:56:21] open your heart be honest
[1:56:24] and let him in
[1:56:29] brother caleb once told me one time el
[1:56:31] mono que la buena vez medico
[1:56:33] uh as we were driving in his car
[1:56:37] and these words i hold dear to my heart
[1:56:50] no once that fire is lit inside of you
[1:56:53] this is
[1:56:56] and it's burning inside of you
[1:57:00] everything's all good but the problem is
[1:57:04] but the problem is to keep it alive
[1:57:07] montenerlo vivo in sendido
[1:57:32] it's going to cost you so much work to
[1:57:35] get it back
[1:57:35] up and burning
[1:57:40] so what is it that you're asking for
[1:57:41] this morning
[1:57:44] by faith you can have it
[1:57:47] was there anything you're fighting for
[1:57:48] this morning
[1:57:55] we're going to be closing now yeah
[1:57:59] i wanted the holy ghost in my life
[1:58:02] i wanted that new birth in my life
[1:58:06] and by the grace of god
[1:58:10] i was able to get it
[1:58:14] that now i'm fighting even harder every
[1:58:17] single day
[1:58:20] just to keep that fire lit
[1:58:24] and if you ask any one of these
[1:58:25] believers here this morning
[1:58:30] if it got harder after that fire's been
[1:58:32] lit
[1:58:45] they're adding wood to that fire to keep
[1:58:47] it burning day and night
[1:58:51] and there's many examples of elderly
[1:58:53] warriors here this morning
[1:58:58] that if you want a testimonial you need
[1:59:00] a testimonial
[1:59:15] it with you but i'll tell the person
[1:59:17] that doesn't have that fire
[1:59:19] but there's no
[1:59:22] better feeling than coming
[1:59:26] into the warmth of that word
[1:59:44] where it's so dark and gloomy
[1:59:48] and now you have a fire to keep you warm
[1:59:51] and light the way
[1:59:52] out
[1:59:55] so let's invite god into
[2:00:09] you please stand
[2:00:22] the struggles are just too great
[2:00:51] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[2:00:56] if you bow your heads close your eyes
[2:01:00] like i said you just need a witness
[2:01:06] you have witnesses all around you
[2:01:09] i see testimony after testimony after
[2:01:11] testimony
[2:01:13] testimonial but you can be a testimony
[2:01:16] this morning
[2:01:19] you accepted faith is your foundation
[2:01:35] your nature as the sacrifices
[2:01:40] i don't care if it was of drugs
[2:01:43] i don't care if it was of theology
[2:01:46] i don't care if you've been in church
[2:01:47] for 50 years i'm
[2:02:01] let us get in connection with god in
[2:02:04] connection
[2:02:05] let us add more wood to the fire charles
[2:02:08] fuego give him praise this morning
[2:02:11] give him glory this morning but brother
[2:02:14] i i don't dance and shout but hermano
[2:02:16] you know
[2:02:31] then just close your eyes he cries
[2:02:35] and give him thanks what he has done in
[2:02:38] your life
[2:02:40] for how he's transformed you transform
[2:02:44] how he's taking
[2:03:00] oh samson he was called of god for
[2:03:04] yamado
[2:03:05] he was used by god
[2:03:08] he had the mighty power of god in him
[2:03:13] but he didn't protect that fire
[2:03:17] he didn't take care of that fire
[2:03:20] and samson was restored is samson
[2:03:24] but it came at the ultimate price
[2:04:06] [Music]

[2:04:22] old lord
[2:04:25] as it's giving revival to those that

[2:18:11] [Music]
[2:18:23] [Music]
[2:18:30] [Music]
[2:18:36] in which we are grateful for this
[2:18:38] opportunity
[2:18:40] we're passing by here
[2:18:47] with a major part of oh we're going to
[2:18:50] the north up north
[2:18:56] and all of the congregation here is
[2:18:58] honoring the resurrection with you guys
[2:19:03] it truly is good to be in the house of
[2:19:05] the lord
[2:19:10] when i was hearing brother marco speak
[2:19:12] about faith by experience
[2:19:19] i was recalling some experiences god has
[2:19:21] allowed me to experience throughout my
[2:19:22] life
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:26] and one of them that came to my memory
[2:19:31] [Music]
[2:19:32] is
[2:19:37] isaac the one that's here he was around
[2:19:39] two or three months or three
[2:19:40] three months
[2:19:45] and as as it happened he had uh
[2:19:50] he he died in his crib
[2:19:57] and at that moment i couldn't see that
[2:19:59] it was the grace of god
[2:20:13] she realized that he had passed away
[2:20:16] he wasn't breathing
[2:20:20] and so in that desperation
[2:20:22] [Music]
[2:20:28] she cried out said the baby and she she
[2:20:30] literally
[2:20:31] put him and tossed him into my arms
[2:20:35] so i cried out to god and god answered
[2:20:41] today he is serving the lord
[2:20:55] and he was around six years old
[2:21:00] and we had gone to pray and to attend to
[2:21:03] a family
[2:21:07] and they had said i was going to be
[2:21:08] praying for a sick person
[2:21:13] but in reality i was going to go pray
[2:21:15] for a dog that was sick
[2:21:20] so we got there i prayed for the dog
[2:21:22] that was sick
[2:21:26] but something was happening in my home
[2:21:30] my son the same child
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:38] he had his his he had a hemorrhage or
[2:21:41] his nose was bleeding
[2:21:44] and the blood wasn't stopping
[2:21:48] and he was he was choking on his own
[2:21:50] blood
[2:21:52] and
[2:22:04] he's choking he's he's he's drowning in
[2:22:06] his own blood
[2:22:09] what do i do
[2:22:12] do i call the paramedics
[2:22:18] the prophet tells us when someone is
[2:22:20] sick
[2:22:24] anybody in their right mind would go to
[2:22:26] the doctor
[2:22:28] so that they could help them this year
[2:22:32] i said well call the call the paramedics
[2:22:37] and while the paramedics were on their
[2:22:39] way
[2:22:41] i was on the phone with her yes and i
[2:22:44] was praying
[2:22:45] for this my son and in my mind
[2:22:56] how was it that i came here to pray for
[2:22:58] a dog and my son is over here
[2:23:02] lord
[2:23:09] and through the phone i could hear the
[2:23:10] siren that was approaching the house
[2:23:21] and the thing that was so surprising
[2:23:26] that the blood stopped instantly
[2:23:30] uh
[2:23:33] my wife told the paramedics it was no
[2:23:35] longer needed
[2:23:38] there's many experiences
[2:23:43] and that just confirms and affirms your
[2:23:46] faith with god
[2:23:49] while i was sitting there thinking
[2:23:58] the the weakest soldier of the
[2:24:00] philistines
[2:24:03] was still a threat
[2:24:09] i i myself i don't think i would
[2:24:11] approach them with a sword
[2:24:12] uh
[2:24:21] maybe there was soldiers in israel that
[2:24:23] didn't fear any of the soldiers in the
[2:24:26] philistines
[2:24:32] [Music]
[2:24:40] the most frail one didn't come out to
[2:24:41] intimidate the god's people
[2:24:46] they sent the biggest one
[2:24:55] this giant philistine wasn't the only
[2:24:58] giant philistine that was among them
[2:25:02] that giant himself had brothers
[2:25:06] but they were all a threat
[2:25:11] and i see any philistine soldier
[2:25:14] as a sickness
[2:25:17] [Music]
[2:25:20] and in this last day they sent the
[2:25:22] biggest one
[2:25:25] that looks like a king because he has a
[2:25:28] crown
[2:25:30] yeah and he's threatened the world
[2:25:33] the whole entire world and the people
[2:25:37] are afraid
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:47] the unbelievers there's churches that
[2:25:50] have closed
[2:25:56] the sicknesses is he's bluffing the
[2:25:59] believers
[2:26:04] it's something sad the world over
[2:26:07] uh but we're not gonna blame anyone
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:17] so us in tucson we close the church
[2:26:19] because of the the government that
[2:26:21] has ordered us to shut it down
[2:26:26] but when they set all the places they
[2:26:28] can open back up
[2:26:30] i told the church
[2:26:44] there's people that don't come because
[2:26:45] they're afraid of the big giant
[2:26:50] we're not the only ones the people of
[2:26:51] israel were also afraid
[2:26:54] but when we speak about faith by
[2:26:56] experience
[2:26:58] we have to live with the enemy by our
[2:27:00] side
[2:27:03] we have to believe that god is going to
[2:27:04] help us
[2:27:05] [Music]
[2:27:13] i'll never forget with sister alba alba
[2:27:16] said on one occasion
[2:27:21] we have to have confidence in god
[2:27:24] but even though
[2:27:28] even just across the road we have to
[2:27:29] trust in god
[2:27:33] but either way you look left and you
[2:27:34] look right when you're going
[2:27:36] we're cautious
[2:27:40] but we have to do it through faith amen
[2:27:42] amen
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:57] each and every one of us had a faith by
[2:27:59] experience
[2:28:01] and i believe the message today is
[2:28:04] helping our faith
