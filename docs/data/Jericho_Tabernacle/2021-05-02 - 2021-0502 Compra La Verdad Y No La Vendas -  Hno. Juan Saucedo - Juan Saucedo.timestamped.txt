[48:42] [Music]

[48:48] [Music]
[48:53] [Music]
[48:55] verse 23.
[49:01] [Music]
[49:27] buy the truth and sell it not
[49:37] [Music]
[49:54] we are reporting for service
[50:01] [Music]
[50:24] but this morning i'm saying if we can
[50:25] help even more agatha
[50:28] please do so lord
[50:31] because we're trusting in you
[50:36] this morning we're only trusting gracias
[50:40] thank you in the name of the lord jesus
[50:42] christ
[50:45] you may be seated
[51:18] in the same way that we buy a house
[51:33] please bear that in your heart
[51:42] the truth is something that cannot be
[51:43] bought with the money of the world
[51:44] doesn't matter how much money we have
[52:02] they personally hand their envelope to
[52:04] the man that's in charge of the finances
[52:09] and he thinks that everything is fine
[52:11] that's what he thinks
[52:13] hermanos hermanos
[52:16] brothers and sisters uh the truth is
[52:18] something that we cannot know
[52:21] regardless of how much money we have
[52:26] if we bring our envelope that's because
[52:30] it's a revelation
[52:35] and god's revelation is needed for
[52:37] everything
[52:39] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[52:42] amen
[52:49] when we give our offering that's because
[52:51] god already placed it in our hearts
[52:57] so now as sons and daughters of god we
[52:59] know that's a responsibility
[53:01] gloria and praise his name
[53:07] brothers and sisters that's part of
[53:08] knowing the truth
[53:12] that's part of being in the truth
[53:18] and i believe with all my heart is part
[53:23] of being
[53:23] in the truth gloria praise his name
[53:30] so truly brothers and sisters it's not
[53:32] something that we can buy
[53:37] god predestinated you to hear it
[54:06] you're going to see just a summary of
[54:08] what we said here in the last few months
[54:15] [Music]
[54:19] of the young people that we have here in
[54:21] this place preaching the word
[54:34] young preachers that are being used of
[54:36] god god is using you
[54:41] this sunday that just passed
[54:46] my son john paul was sitting next to me
[55:06] but john paul stopped me because he was
[55:08] right there next to me
[55:10] it's the worship brothers it's the time
[55:13] to raise your hands
[55:18] it's time to say to god how much we love
[55:20] him
[55:24] what we hear brothers why did we come to
[55:28] church
[55:29] we come to hear the nemo says and listen
[55:32] evening
[55:46] as soon as you leave but no one thinks
[55:51] you have a good defense with you
[55:55] what you heard that morning blessed be
[55:58] the name of the lord
[56:15] so brothers this is the way that god is
[56:16] using these young people
[56:22] we have already that have gone in beyond
[56:25] at the age of 16.
[56:28] yo
[56:37] the way that god used my brother
[56:38] emmanuel
[56:41] my brother eli hermano de
[57:38] on friday
[57:42] and brothers that that's a job
[57:49] and god give it more if you live and god
[57:51] will give him more
[58:04] the book of saint john chapter eight
[58:21] and all this that i'm going to say it's
[58:22] something that i've heard from my
[58:23] younger brothers
[58:27] there's other things that you might hear
[58:29] me say this
[58:31] is
[58:34] but some of the things that i'm going to
[58:36] say this morning
[58:39] in other words
[58:45] and when somebody reminds us of
[58:47] something we then rejoice
[58:50] and we ask god for his guidance gloria
[58:53] glory to his name
[58:54] san juan capitol ocho saint john chapter
[58:56] 8.
[58:59] verse 31
[59:02] jesus
[59:07] then jesus said to those jews which
[59:10] believed on
[59:11] him
[59:14] which believed on him brothers because
[59:17] you momento
[59:18] just notice a moment
[59:22] when we hear a message
[59:25] we hear them with our ears
[59:30] and in our hearts we're rejoicing
[59:33] glory to his name and what we're
[59:36] listening to
[59:40] then becomes a revelation to us gloria
[59:43] glory to his name
[59:58] 31
[1:00:04] then jesus said to those jews which
[1:00:05] believed on him
[1:00:10] if you continue in my word
[1:00:16] then are ye my disciples indeed
[1:00:20] now listen to verse 32.
[1:00:26] it goes along with the subject that i'm
[1:00:28] trying to prove
[1:00:31] and you shall know the truth
[1:00:35] and you shall know the truth
[1:00:39] and the truth shall make you free
[1:00:45] and the truth shall make you free
[1:00:49] now what is it going to free us up
[1:00:53] brothers and sisters it will free us
[1:00:54] from many things
[1:00:59] i was telling the brother that many
[1:01:00] times in our homes
[1:01:04] we live under the influence of our
[1:01:06] parents
[1:01:14] we live under the influence of our
[1:01:15] uncles and aunts and family members
[1:01:20] and also under the influence of the
[1:01:22] church
[1:01:49] them that have already been born in the
[1:01:51] message
[1:01:59] there uh many children that have been
[1:02:01] mourning the message of parents that
[1:02:02] have already believed the message
[1:02:16] blessed be the name of our lord
[1:02:20] you still need your own personal day at
[1:02:22] calvary avenue
[1:02:24] a man brothers and doses so
[1:02:27] verse 32. and you shall know the truth
[1:02:39] i don't know what the lord has freed you
[1:02:40] from you say that
[1:02:42] i know what he has freed me from
[1:02:46] we all know
[1:03:14] front if you want to come there
[1:03:19] that's an action office that's an act of
[1:03:22] a
[1:03:22] courageous person a courageous woman
[1:03:26] but you don't have to do it where
[1:03:54] does anybody know you know i don't
[1:04:16] because we don't know when an accident
[1:04:17] will happen to us
[1:04:21] we've heard of brothers that have been
[1:04:23] in accidents
[1:04:33] we all heard that he was in a terrible
[1:04:34] accident
[1:04:36] is that right
[1:04:48] and that's something that could have
[1:04:49] happened to any of us
[1:05:20] and he will do so
[1:05:32] and the truth shall set you free and
[1:05:34] don't say yes
[1:05:38] so we already know what the lord has
[1:05:39] made us free from
[1:05:41] apocalypses let's go to revelations 1
[1:05:44] 3.
[1:05:49] revelations 1 3 that's the scripture
[1:05:51] that we're going to read
[1:05:54] we're reading god's word
[1:06:02] that's the weapon that helps us
[1:06:09] uh yesterday i went to go pick up my son
[1:06:10] jonathan at the fessa bus
[1:06:15] and he you know told me something that
[1:06:17] happened to him along the way
[1:06:19] says the the trip the ride was fine
[1:06:23] i was able to cross
[1:06:31] at the mile 19 you know there's a
[1:06:33] checkpoint for immigration
[1:06:35] immigration and uh two immigration
[1:06:37] officers came up
[1:06:39] when you're gonna head to fesa and i
[1:06:42] know how is it that they get on because
[1:06:43] i drove
[1:06:44] to pesa
[1:06:48] several times i came back and forth from
[1:06:50] nogales
[1:06:52] so i know what is it how they do we stop
[1:06:56] we open the door
[1:06:58] and normally
[1:07:41] they did not find no police records on
[1:07:42] it

[1:09:18] is
[1:09:29] when we read god's word we should ask
[1:09:30] him for understanding
[1:09:36] remember the man that came from
[1:09:37] jerusalem back to his own place
[1:09:42] and it was reading the scroll of the
[1:09:44] prophet isaiah
[1:09:46] and

[1:10:36] that's unusual
[1:10:38] felipe and samaria phillip was in

[1:11:01] but then the spirit all of a sudden
[1:11:02] catches him away do you believe it i do
[1:11:06] not

[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:42] when this person was reading their the
[1:11:44] scripture
[1:11:51] the first thing that philip asked the

[1:12:02] mistakes

[1:12:35] how can i understand if there is no one
[1:12:36] to explain it to me
[1:12:38] gloria glory to his name
[1:12:43] god will have someone to explain it to
[1:12:45] you
[1:12:47] let me bring it a bit closer
[1:12:51] i was a pentecostal preacher and i was
[1:12:53] so happy
[1:12:55] and i was joyful
[1:12:58] the organization even gave me a bicycle
[1:13:29] you know why because they already have
[1:13:30] two three bikes at their home
[1:13:35] we would have to walk brothers
[1:13:40] if we managed to get a bike then oh
[1:13:41] brother
[1:13:44] well the organization bought me a bike
[1:13:49] and then after a bit of time they bought
[1:13:51] me a motorcycle

[1:25:21] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:25:22] unto the churches

[1:26:59] for the cause of the word
[1:27:12] the reproach for the cause of the word
[1:27:30] the word la cualdios that god spoke
[1:27:37] that god spoke to him noah there was a
[1:27:38] reproach
[1:27:41] there was a reproach with noah no evil
[1:27:52] where there was a scientific achievement
[1:27:54] that they were able to manufacture
[1:27:56] los cuales
[1:28:00] that were beyond anything that we've
[1:28:02] manufactured today
[1:28:04] what do you think about that
[1:28:09] they were brighter more intelligent
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:29] that he preached 120 years
[1:28:33] in the face of scoffers
[1:28:38] the great scientific ways proved to them
[1:28:57] that in the skies there wasn't any rain
[1:28:59] no
[1:29:00] via uv there was no rain
[1:29:04] this man is a madman
[1:29:07] that's the reproach for the cause of the
[1:29:08] word
[1:29:13] now let me tell you something when god
[1:29:15] speaks it
[1:29:17] it has to come to pass
[1:29:20] how many years are going to go by before
[1:29:21] it is

[1:30:30] things in there

[1:31:22] christiana i have christian music that's
[1:31:24] playing a speaker
[1:31:26] and a speaker right here to the side
[1:31:32] and then all of a sudden instead of
[1:31:34] listening to the song
[1:31:36] i heard a voice that said i'm sorry are
[1:31:39] you
[1:31:39] asking for questions
[1:31:57] if you're driving on the bus and then
[1:31:59] you're driving listen to the music and
[1:32:01] then all of a sudden somebody says that
[1:32:02] to you
[1:32:04] i got scared
[1:32:10] but it's the wisdom and the intelligence
[1:32:11] that we have today
[1:32:14] on the phones they even speak to you
[1:32:18] why did nobody told me that
[1:32:23] i'm of the old style
[1:32:27] it scared me
[1:32:31] and now i i can tell that phones speak
[1:32:33] to you
[1:32:34] ask whatever you want and they give it
[1:32:38] to you
[1:33:04] if you got 10 yards in your in your
[1:33:06] truck
[1:33:19] because they're going to put a little
[1:33:19] thing inside
[1:33:24] and is going to tell the inspector that
[1:33:26] that cement is super hot
[1:33:28] and they'll turn it down
[1:33:33] and now they're making us pay for that
[1:33:34] load
[1:33:38] so we just we can't afford to get lost
[1:33:44] but what we do as soon as we know where
[1:33:45] we're headed
[1:33:48] we have a book and we
[1:34:02] just
[1:34:16] the phone will give you the closest
[1:34:17] address but not that one
[1:34:20] that's why we have to get the book
[1:34:25] the book where all the streets and all
[1:34:26] the cities are in there oh boy
[1:34:29] i'm headed to phoenix
[1:34:41] so today we also have advanced science
[1:34:43] established
[1:34:44] we have
[1:35:01] their great scientific ways proved to
[1:35:04] them that there was no rain in the skies
[1:35:10] but yet noah had heard the word of the
[1:35:13] lord
[1:35:17] and it was contrary to their conception
[1:35:20] of it
[1:35:23] so before his life could be saved
[1:36:04] and i think that what i'm going to say
[1:36:06] to you know they use lodico
[1:36:07] one of them
[1:36:13] i'm gonna give you the homework to find
[1:36:14] out which one of them was the one that

[1:36:21] but i'm so happy because of these young
[1:36:22] people and i've told them

[1:36:30] in one single hour brother you preached
[1:36:34] you preached something that helped me
[1:36:51] but i want to give you the testimony
[1:36:59] when brother branham went to his cabin
[1:37:01] or to a cave or somewhere to be
[1:37:04] honest
[1:37:07] and he was going to pray and you can
[1:37:08] find this in the message how the angel
[1:37:10] came to me
[1:37:12] page 27
[1:37:16] and says behold there was a lightning
[1:37:20] i won't read everything but i'll read

[1:42:39] in the movie that we have of him and the
[1:42:41] deep calling to a deep when he's praying

[1:43:07] if you pray
[1:43:22] and you're sincere when you pray
[1:43:27] nothing will stand before your prayers
[1:43:31] not even cancer
[1:43:34] now i'm going to give you a testimony
[1:43:36] testimonial

[1:43:53] paragraph 109.
[1:43:58] and i'll be skipping a few because
[1:44:02] but this is the testimony of a preacher
[1:44:35] he married a girl that was a sister i
[1:44:36] believe to george
[1:44:40] was the mayor of the city
[1:44:44] or the judge was his brother
[1:45:11] they brought him from a certain place to
[1:45:12] another so that he could die el medico
[1:45:18] the doctor in middletown and the doctor
[1:45:20] in new albany via nostitu
[1:45:22] diagnosed his case
[1:45:27] as cancer of the liver cancer deliga
