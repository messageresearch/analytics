[54:21] capitolo cinco versus
[54:27] [Music]
[54:33] you can truly feel a precious atmosphere
[54:35] this morning
[54:37] of reverence
[54:41] amen amen
[54:47] the book of daniel 5 27
[54:49] [Music]
[55:35] if you come to hear something excellent
[55:37] from brother luis hermano
[55:39] recommendation brother my recommendation
[55:44] is don't listen to what i want to say
[55:59] and then the word that he preaches
[56:03] come straight from the tapes
[56:09] so we just come to be an echo this
[56:10] morning
[56:14] to repeat what the
[56:41] i'd like to thank our pastor for the
[56:42] trust he always gives us
[56:47] to be able to stand behind the pulpit
[56:48] and speak unto the bride
[56:52] this morning we want to continue with
[56:54] our talk
[56:56] is
[57:10] and we'd like to say prayer and action
[57:15] how many of you pray
[57:17] important it's something very important
[57:20] it's like vitamins
[57:22] it's like a recipe
[57:24] of
[57:36] but just like we have our plate of food
[57:37] when we go and have lunch
[58:18] so this morning the scripture tells us
[58:19] we've been weighed in the balances
[58:34] and just like a boxer
[59:30] let me tell you
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:09] so we need to watch ourselves in the
[1:00:11] mirror of the world
[1:00:39] but if we're not ready or prepared
[1:00:44] god cannot give us those good things
[1:00:49] because our hands are occupied with
[1:00:50] other things amen amen
[1:00:54] oh
[1:00:57] imagine grabbing your groceries taking
[1:00:59] them from the vehicle to the house
[1:01:02] and your hands are occupied
[1:01:06] and your wife says here look take this
[1:01:50] and see if we're wanting something
[1:01:53] and put ourselves in the balance of that
[1:01:55] word
[1:01:59] just like the the the the woman that the
[1:02:01] lord jesus christ gave a parable uh
[1:02:04] parables
[1:02:17] a certain stone uh that's a
[1:02:21] that's a bracelet a bracket a bracelet
[1:02:27] and she had 10 spaces in it
[1:02:31] just like us today
[1:02:45] but in the times of the east back then
[1:02:48] they had that bracelet
[1:02:53] and they had uh ten coins
[1:02:56] of silver
[1:02:59] and every one of those coins
[1:03:27] that means that woman is now staying
[1:03:28] stained
[1:03:31] she's an adulteress before her husband
[1:03:35] before her husband can come home
[1:03:38] she started to surf
[1:03:41] she went into her dress
[1:03:42] in the
[1:04:10] he
[1:04:24] and the message
[1:04:29] in the bible
[1:04:32] they'll tell you what you need
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:36] let's go to the book of james
[1:04:56] my brother encountered all joy when you
[1:04:58] fall into diverse temptations
[1:05:03] it's a test right
[1:05:05] it's a challenge
[1:05:32] [Applause]
[1:06:17] it's very tremendous when i see an
[1:06:18] elderly man elderly sister
[1:06:21] and they're very calm
[1:06:23] they're they're so trained
[1:06:26] everything's falling apart
[1:06:29] they stay calm
[1:06:44] one that's spiritually
[1:06:58] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:07:01] so you may be perfect
[1:07:08] nothing says
[1:07:10] so then the book of daniels
[1:07:40] anything watching nothing amen amen
[1:07:45] and another version of the scriptures
[1:07:49] it says let patients have her perfect
[1:07:51] results
[1:07:54] and do a thorough work
[1:07:58] so that you can be perfect
[1:08:01] and completely the role
[1:08:04] so then there come the tests
[1:08:08] for
[1:08:21] find us wanting nothing uh
[1:08:36] detailed
[1:08:37] meticulous
[1:08:39] careful elaborado elaborated
[1:08:45] and accurate
[1:08:46] anton says
[1:08:49] so then patience are the texts
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:57] search the scriptures for in them ye
[1:09:59] think you have eternal life
[1:10:41] and you will not come to me that you
[1:10:43] might have life
[1:10:46] so then they search the scriptures
[1:10:49] searching for life
[1:10:52] and they can't find life
[1:10:55] but it says the scripture is
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:46] it's something i think we probably never
[1:11:47] do
[1:11:50] the prophet says like this
[1:12:20] sickness
[1:12:27] we're paying attention to how powerful
[1:12:28] prayer is
[1:12:32] now i want you to observe what the
[1:12:34] prophet is saying
[1:12:35] gambia los pecadores it changes sinners
[1:12:40] into saints
[1:12:43] it doesn't say their hospital
[1:12:46] a rehab center no he said
[1:13:16] and doctors can't
[1:13:27] why don't we use it
[1:14:26] three times a day and i've reached my
[1:14:27] limit
[1:14:29] the doctor says well if you've got a
[1:14:30] headache
[1:14:35] don't take more than two okay
[1:14:37] because you can have an overdose
[1:14:40] with prey
[1:15:23] i wish that man would pray everywhere
[1:15:28] where do we pray brothers
[1:15:30] do we only pray here at church
[1:15:34] do we only pray in the car in
[1:16:05] out and i'd say let's pray
[1:16:07] many times
[1:16:09] we pray
[1:16:11] without caring who was around
[1:16:16] was over here to the side or at another
[1:16:18] table they're laughing who what it
[1:16:19] doesn't matter
[1:16:20] let us pray
[1:16:27] i can't i can't remember the amount of
[1:16:29] people that would come close to us
[1:16:31] elders they would draw clothes
[1:16:34] congratulations
[1:16:36] you pray
[1:16:37] without any shame
[1:16:42] you never see young people praying for
[1:16:44] food at a restaurant
[1:17:56] a language that you give off
[1:18:01] when you raise your hand
[1:18:04] that's giving to understand you've
[1:18:05] surrendered
[1:18:09] so here the lord jesus christ in the
[1:18:10] book of matthew capitola
[1:18:13] chapter 26
[1:18:16] it says that we have to watch and pray
[1:18:20] jesus
[1:18:23] then cometh jesus unto the place called
[1:18:25] gethsemane
[1:18:31] and said unto his disciples sit here
[1:18:33] while i go and pray yonder
[1:18:35] pedro
[1:18:43] and he took him and he took with him
[1:18:44] peter and the two sons of zebedee and
[1:18:46] began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[1:18:48] entonces
[1:18:54] then said he unto them my soul is
[1:18:56] exceeding sorrowful even unto death
[1:18:58] tarry ye here and watch with me
[1:19:12] and he went a little farther and fell on
[1:19:13] his face and prayed saying oh my father
[1:19:16] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[1:19:18] me nevertheless not as i will but as
[1:19:21] thou wilt
[1:19:22] establish so then when one is praying
[1:19:31] but let it be your will
[1:19:41] and he cometh unto his disciples and
[1:19:43] findeth them asleep and saith unto peter
[1:19:45] what could you not watch with me one
[1:19:47] hour
[1:20:02] you cannot
[1:20:31] a purpose why the lord says we need to
[1:20:32] pray
[1:20:34] so that we don't enter into temperatures
[1:20:37] if we begin to pray
[1:20:40] pray and pray
[1:20:44] you see a test
[1:22:09] sanders okay brother branham brother
[1:22:12] i got close just to hear it
[1:22:15] i wanted to preach to them the gospels
[1:22:21] i was already dancing with him
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:52] what does brother johnny say
[1:22:54] the flesh of the flesh
[1:22:56] it's the flesh's fault
[1:23:01] very tremendous phrase for the johnny
[1:23:02] hughes
[1:23:32] do you walk
[1:23:46] watch
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:24:42] let
[1:24:58] if there's a better healing than that
[1:25:02] then the bible would have told us
[1:25:06] that if anyone is afflicted among you
[1:25:08] afflicted
[1:25:09] it just says tylenol
[1:25:37] is
[1:25:53] no i remember
[1:25:55] there's no remedy
[1:25:58] and i feel as though i'm going to die
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:03] my father's loss
[1:26:06] i just don't know what to do
[1:26:08] and they enter into that
[1:26:10] and then those spirits
[1:26:13] they get fed off of them
[1:26:19] freaking them
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:54] that means they don't want to listen to
[1:28:55] me right yes
[1:28:57] i haven't heard brother bernie say that
[1:28:58] yolo
[1:28:59] i see them like this
[1:29:02] it's that they don't want to listen
[1:29:04] but when their arms are loose
[1:29:06] they're writing their notes
[1:29:08] raising their
[1:29:37] okay your tiger is crazy
[1:29:44] unanimously
[1:29:47] lord that demon is going to run
[1:29:49] because that demon is here he is having
[1:29:52] training and they talk amongst each
[1:29:53] other
[1:29:56] you fought with your wife
[1:29:58] then don't sing today
[1:30:01] you fought with him so don't go to
[1:30:03] church
[1:30:32] but we can
[1:30:48] do you have the confidence to go and
[1:30:50] talk to god
[1:30:52] sometimes
[1:30:56] brother can you please pray for me
[1:31:14] you don't
[1:31:42] if we're not
[1:31:58] reconciliations
[1:32:02] we were reconciled to god by the death
[1:32:04] of his son
[1:32:06] much more estando reconciliators being
[1:32:08] reconciled
[1:32:38] is
[1:32:52] but
[1:33:06] very tremendous question the scripture
[1:33:08] is going to ask
[1:33:11] from whence comes wars
[1:33:13] platos
[1:33:15] and fightings among you
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:19] tremendous questions
[1:33:32] that war with your members
[1:33:34] he said
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:36:02] that the friendship of the world is
[1:36:03] enmity with god
[1:36:10] whatsoever therefore will be a friend of
[1:36:12] the world is the enemy of god
[1:36:16] now i like what it says in spanish
[1:36:19] it says souls
[1:36:22] adulterous
[1:36:36] yes
[1:36:50] that
[1:38:00] is
[1:38:38] let us not love in word neither in
[1:38:40] tongue but in deed and in truth
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:40:06] we
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:36] if our heart condemns us we did
[1:40:38] something wrong
[1:40:43] god is greater than our heart
[1:40:47] no one's perfect
[1:41:45] i can't make it i can't make it
[1:41:49] because my heart condemns me
[1:41:52] there's hope for that sinner
[1:41:55] there's someone greater
[1:41:57] than your heart they're condemned
[1:42:39] i like how it begins
[1:43:06] because you're about to get that blown
[1:43:22] forgive
[1:43:36] toward
[1:43:50] and if i did something wrong
[1:43:52] did i stand
[1:43:54] i had the courage
[1:43:57] to say forgive me
[1:43:59] forgive me i did this in the other one
[1:44:03] if your heart doesn't count
[1:44:31] is
[1:45:28] but we want god
[1:45:43] from him
[1:45:45] because we keep his commandments
[1:45:48] and then verse 23 what is the
[1:45:50] commandment
[1:45:52] and this is his commandments
[1:45:55] this is his commandment that we should
[1:45:58] believe
[1:46:01] on the name of his son jesus christ
[1:46:05] you've got to believe in him
[1:46:08] love one another
[1:46:10] one another
[1:47:08] is it the prayer that heals me or the
[1:47:09] faith that heals me
[1:47:11] the prophet says
[1:47:13] it's the faith
[1:47:14] that heals
[1:47:16] you can pray
[1:47:18] faith but there's no faith
[1:47:20] but it's faith
[1:48:37] what does it profit my brethren that a
[1:48:38] man say if he have faith and not works
[1:48:42] can faith save him
[1:49:04] you give them that things that are
[1:49:05] profitable needful to the body
[1:49:08] what does it profit
[1:49:11] let's say that a couple gets uh draws
[1:49:12] close to hermano luis uh brother luis
[1:49:16] uh listen they they
[1:49:17] fired me from work
[1:49:20] i don't have any clothes
[1:49:22] the bills are accumulating
[1:49:25] we don't have food
[1:49:40] listen to the tapes
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:50:08] action
[1:50:10] brother don't worry about it guys
[1:50:12] just keep going forward
[1:50:14] now
[1:50:16] i've got a grit of that food
[1:50:19] that prayer into action your thing of
[1:50:22] faith and if i've got
[1:51:03] same with faith
[1:51:17] it is buried
[1:52:14] son
[1:52:16] he literally took up
[1:52:19] offered his son
[1:52:27] how faith worketh how faith wrought his
[1:52:30] with his work
[1:52:32] perfection
[1:52:34] and by works was his faith made perfect
[1:52:37] and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:52:40] abraham believed
[1:52:52] you see then how that works that by
[1:52:54] works a man is justified
[1:53:10] and
[1:53:37] just like john west
[1:54:19] a young man
[1:54:34] used to it or he's so used to praying
[1:54:38] he said brothers let's go pray
[1:54:41] so that this machine can turn on
[1:54:44] they start to pray lord jesus christ
[1:54:46] turn on this machine lord
[1:54:48] and then you open his eyes they touched
[1:54:50] his grass and he said wait did you put
[1:54:52] gas in it
[1:54:54] you see brothers
[1:54:56] there's prayer
[1:54:59] got to get into action
[1:55:02] he wants god to heal us
[1:55:14] you can't be the same
[1:56:40] do you have fear
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:57:36] and now it's time for action
[1:57:39] now it's time for you people
[1:57:42] with cancer
[1:57:44] that the doctors rejected
[1:57:47] now it's the time for you people
[1:57:50] with heart problems
[1:58:17] what kind of actions
[1:59:13] and there was that old man the great
[1:59:14] goliath
[1:59:26] [Applause]
[1:59:28] they were israelites
[1:59:31] circumcised and they were circumcised
[1:59:33] and so forth
[1:59:37] were afraid because
[1:59:39] these were israelites
[1:59:42] and they were circumcised
[2:00:09] afraid to make
[2:00:38] will
[2:00:52] he was
[2:01:48] something's
[2:02:09] could see the glamour prosperity down in
[2:02:10] egypt or down in sodom
[2:02:14] could see the possibilities
[2:02:16] of a lot
[2:02:23] lot could see the possibilities of when
[2:02:24] he looked over to sodom and could maybe
[2:02:26] become
[2:02:28] being that he was a hebrew yeah
[2:04:15] the preachers today seem to want to make
[2:04:16] their churches like some modernistic
[2:04:18] lodge of some sort members
[2:04:20] membership and so on
[2:04:26] they see the possibilities of maybe
[2:04:28] becoming
[2:04:29] of the scriptures
[2:04:32] forsaking the scriptures when it's
[2:04:34] laying right before them
