[30:56] [Music]
[31:07] amen god is so good amen
[31:10] amen so good to be here in the house of
[31:12] the lord once more
[31:16] it's such a special day today
[31:20] and it's just a day of remembrance
[31:24] every day should be special for a
[31:25] christian
[31:27] christian
[31:28] when we began to think of that day on
[31:30] calvary
[31:45] i am saved today
[31:50] because somebody paid the price for us
[31:55] oh i'm so glad for that
[31:59] so good to be in the house of the lord
[32:00] like i said
[32:04] if you would like
[32:06] we could turn to revelations 1 18.
[32:11] apocalypse
[32:16] whenever you have it just go ahead and
[32:17] say amen
[32:23] i had
[32:25] a plan
[32:26] yo
[32:29] continue on um
[32:32] the importance of reading our bible
[32:36] importance
[32:38] but i forgot it was going to be a good
[32:41] friday
[32:44] and i believe it's um
[32:47] duty-bound to come and speak about the
[32:50] greatest time on earth
[32:56] when our greatest enemy was conquered on
[32:59] that day
[33:04] it says i am he that liveth and was dead
[33:08] and behold i am alive forever ever more
[33:11] amen and have the keys of hell and death
[33:21] amen
[33:25] when moses asked god who do i tell the
[33:28] people that sent me who do i tell them
[33:31] who sent me
[33:36] a
[33:50] when abraham was i am
[33:53] abraham
[33:55] and here on this scripture
[33:57] jesus says
[34:00] i am he that liveth
[34:04] that's present tense
[34:07] that's today
[34:11] he lives today
[34:14] but i like what he says after that
[34:17] he said i am he that lives
[34:21] but i was dead yes
[34:26] and then he goes back to the present
[34:27] tense and says behold i am alive
[34:29] forevermore
[34:36] and i have not i did have but i have the
[34:39] keys of hell and death
[34:45] so let's go back past tense when he died
[34:48] amen
[34:51] but remember he is here right now
[34:56] amen let us bow our heads
[34:59] heavenly father father celestial lord
[35:01] we're so thankful for your holy spirit
[35:06] we're thankful for you working in each
[35:08] and every person that allows you to
[35:10] father
[35:14] god we come here unworthy father father
[35:19] but lord we come here knowing you paid
[35:21] the price
[35:25] lord and we come here with the sacrifice
[35:27] of our lord jesus christ
[35:32] under the blood asking for your perfect
[35:34] will this evening
[35:38] we ask that you take the full control
[35:40] lord
[35:43] we put ourselves into your hands in the
[35:44] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[35:50] amen you may be seated
[35:54] i would like to read
[35:55] john 3 16.
[36:00] i believe uh there's brothers here led
[36:02] by the lord
[36:06] there's some brothers that uh send me
[36:08] texts
[36:11] and this is one of the texts that they
[36:12] sent me today
[36:16] for god so loved the world that he gave
[36:18] his only begotten son that whosoever
[36:21] believes in him should not perish but
[36:24] have everlasting
[36:35] amen amen what a beautiful message god
[36:38] has given us
[36:42] for god so loved the world
[36:46] that's why he died for us
[36:50] he was willing to die no jew no gentile
[36:52] nobody killed him he loved us so much
[36:55] that he came down himself
[37:05] so my title
[37:07] this evening is establishing the kingdom
[37:14] and i begin to think on how
[37:17] god began to create things on the earth
[37:25] because in his great mind he wanted to
[37:27] establish a kingdom for his children
[37:33] he wanted to have a paradise for us so
[37:36] that we can live and we could reign with
[37:38] him
[37:44] so he began to create all these things
[37:46] in the earth so that he could place his
[37:49] children on there
[37:55] brother branham says in the message
[37:57] satan's eden
[38:01] finally when he got it all made finally
[38:06] and finally we finally arrived with its
[38:09] headquarters of the earth
[38:15] in a beautiful spot laying east of the
[38:17] eden called the garden of eden
[38:25] god made the headquarters in the garden
[38:28] of eden
[38:30] is
[38:44] and over the whole situation he put his
[38:46] son and his son's wife over all of it
[38:54] that's right that's what god did he put
[38:56] him in full control
[39:02] they could speak to the winds and the
[39:04] wounds would cease to blow us
[39:10] they would speak to the tree and it
[39:11] would move from here to
[39:26] there
[39:40] they didn't
[39:43] but god gave them a warning
[39:48] in genesis 2 16 and 17 he told them and
[39:52] he says those
[39:54] this is
[39:56] he said and the lord god commanded the
[39:58] man saying every tree of the garden thou
[40:00] may mayest freely eat it
[40:08] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[40:10] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for
[40:13] the day that thou eatest therefore
[40:15] thereof thou shalt surely die
[40:18] de la s
[40:36] that means he's going to make sure it
[40:38] happens
[40:43] it's we hear it and it sounds very harsh
[40:46] and very strong words surely die is
[40:54] but remember um though all of life has
[40:57] rules and laws of life right
[41:03] god gave them everything they wanted
[41:08] they had all the power that they had
[41:13] and they had unlimited fellowship with
[41:15] the lord companies
[41:18] in your
[41:20] but this one thing do not do or thou
[41:23] shalt surely die
[41:29] now
[41:30] death
[41:31] we've heard this before but there's two
[41:33] kinds of deaths
[41:37] in those classes
[41:38] the first one the spirit leaves the body
[41:43] and we lay the body to rest
[41:48] but then the second one is when the
[41:50] spirit of god separates from a person
[41:58] and we know the story i don't have to
[42:00] continue on with the story
[42:04] we know the punchline we know what adam
[42:06] and eve did
[42:12] eve she listened to a lie and everything
[42:14] fell apart
[42:19] and those two things begin to happen
[42:21] within them the death
[42:23] yes
[42:28] and gods put them together and he called
[42:31] for a conference of adam eve and the
[42:33] serpent
[42:39] and he told the serpent because you did
[42:41] this you'll be cursed over
[42:50] and he said i will put enmity um verse
[42:53] 15
[42:54] i will put enmity between thee and thy
[42:56] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[43:05] and it shall bruise thy head and doubt
[43:08] shall bruise his heel esta erida
[43:24] but he said because you have done this
[43:30] verse 17 it says cursed be the ground
[43:39] it be the ground because you did this
[43:44] and sorrow shall be
[43:46] thou eat of all the days of thy life
[43:52] cursed be the ground maldito
[43:54] god cursed the serpent god cursed the
[43:57] woman but god cursed the ground when he
[43:59] talked to adam
[44:05] if i would if i was at him i'd be like i
[44:06] i got off on that one
[44:08] [Music]
[44:12] but that was the greatest curse
[44:16] what what were they created out of
[44:19] porque que fueron creados
[44:31] everything that you see the wood the
[44:34] trees the plants us
[44:41] have the 16 elements in them
[44:46] and that is made from the ground yes
[44:50] so when he said cursive in the ground
[44:55] the mountains changed
[44:58] the weather began to turn bad el tiempo
[45:02] oil climates
[45:12] begin to groan because it became
[45:15] separated from god
[45:46] man was separated from god which is the
[45:49] worst kind of death any man should have
[45:51] refused
[45:57] brother branham said man begin to be a
[45:59] wanderer around the earth
[46:05] because death began to set in porque
[46:09] introduced
[46:10] now the bible says in in genesis chapter
[46:12] 2
[46:15] it says the day you eat thereof is the
[46:17] day you die
[46:24] so this is the first time we hear about
[46:27] death ever in in
[46:29] in the bible
[46:36] and what god basically was saying it
[46:38] says if you eat of this tree you will
[46:40] activate
[47:14] something is is dispatched or called out
[47:20] it was the first time death was
[47:22] mentioned
[47:34] where was it because there was no need
[47:36] of death
[48:12] amen amen
[48:14] where did it come from it's just a
[48:15] question maybe you guys can go and look
[48:18] at it and see
[48:31] where there was life death was there
[48:34] inside
[48:39] everything that has life in it now
[48:44] there is already a appointed time
[49:00] it's there along
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:14] um
[49:17] the the devil was in the garden
[49:19] diablo
[49:21] now he was stripped of everything that
[49:23] he had
[49:27] and he was hiding in the serpent
[49:33] he had no power in him
[49:36] he was stripped of all dignity he he did
[49:39] not have anything to fight with
[50:02] what is the devil what what's his power
[50:04] what is he good at
[50:05] diablo
[50:08] the bible says he's a deceiver
[50:16] the bible says that he's an accuser
[50:21] he's a good lawyer that's what it sounds
[50:23] like hey
[50:26] so he said if i could persuade them
[50:32] then i can put them under this.
[50:37] and i could put them under all of that
[50:40] and cause them to relinquish their power
[50:47] and that's exactly what happened yes
[50:52] he took away everything from adam and
[50:54] eve
[50:57] and he caused adam to forfeit the title
[51:01] deed
[51:05] he caused him to forfeit
[51:07] uh
[51:08] the inheritance that god had given him
[51:15] and and that's what exactly what
[51:17] happened yes exactly
[51:19] on that day on calvary in the mental
[51:22] says i disagree with the universities
[51:25] saying that satan will be saved
[51:32] he sinned and he is the originator of
[51:34] sin el peco el fue el que originol
[51:37] pecado so where does sin come from
[51:41] it comes from him
[51:43] how does how was death introduced
[51:52] that's why death has a grip on each and
[51:54] every person each and everything across
[51:56] the world
[52:02] because sin was introduced
[52:06] and sin activated death
[52:11] wherever it was whatever it was doing if
[52:13] it existed it was there when they sinned
[52:31] is
[52:33] that spirit shall be totally annihilated
[52:36] nothing to be left of it
[52:43] when sin struck the earth back in the
[52:45] beginning like a black sheep falling
[52:47] from the heavens
[52:56] it literally paralyzed the earth
[53:01] creature on earth and all of god's
[53:03] creation in bondage
[53:10] man was under bondage of death sickness
[53:12] troubles and sorrows
[53:19] and all nature fell with it
[53:22] was an anesthetic and actually paralyzed
[53:25] the earth
[53:38] creature on earth was subject to it and
[53:40] everyone born on earth was subject to it
[53:49] romans 5 14 it says
[53:53] nevertheless death reigned from adam to
[53:56] moses even over
[53:58] them that had not sinned after the
[54:00] multitude of adam's transgression who is
[54:04] a figure of him that was to come
[54:07] santa reynolds
[54:21] the devil established his kingdom el
[54:24] diablo establishing
[54:26] and death begin to reign over the people
[54:31] and we're subject under this
[54:36] there's nothing a person can do no
[54:38] persona
[54:40] brother burnham said that the uh abraham
[54:43] isaac jacob they were wanderers
[54:49] seeking a city to come
[55:06] but within all of this bondage that was
[55:08] going on
[55:13] there was whispers and there was
[55:15] prophecies going on throughout the
[55:17] scripture
[55:18] prophecy
[55:22] even within the judgment when he had the
[55:24] serpent eve and adam they're with him
[55:31] they were sitting there at the judgment
[55:33] seat
[55:37] and within that curse of the serpent
[55:42] god begin to prophesy of something good
[55:57] and his heel would bruise the head of
[56:00] that serpent
[56:20] and that was the first prophecy of what
[56:22] was to come yes
[56:26] even though
[56:27] the all of the old testament was
[56:29] shadowed with death
[56:35] there was light pointing to someone
[56:37] something was going to happen
[56:56] the second death and the first death was
[56:59] upon each and every person
[57:04] which was the separation from the spirit
[57:09] and they were gonna die eventually
[57:13] they could not enter into his presence
[57:17] they could not go and talk to him face
[57:19] to face
[57:23] and the effect of separation from a
[57:25] spirit
[57:26] effect
[57:29] causes
[57:30] rebellion causes hatred causes all those
[57:33] things
[57:37] because god implemented a sacrifice
[57:42] he said they said would sacrifice goats
[57:44] rams lambs and and uh
[57:47] and pigeons and doves
[57:50] sacrifice
[57:54] and it would cover their sin yes
[57:57] but they were still separated from that
[58:00] holy spirit
[58:04] so their nature was the things of the
[58:06] world the things of sin
[58:12] because of that separation of the spirit
[58:17] they they could not fellowship or they
[58:20] could not truly serve the lord
[58:27] so
[58:28] you see the whole world falling into
[58:30] pieces
[58:34] but god chose a certain people
[58:38] pueblo that was the jews
[58:41] he chose them so that he could redeem
[58:44] the world through them
[58:50] and god would
[58:52] go and lead them and do what he had to
[58:54] do through them
[58:58] but just like the world just like
[59:00] everybody else asico mundo yes
[59:11] [Music]
[59:22] and there finally god raised up david
[59:25] finally
[59:27] david and solomon the greatest the
[59:29] golden ages of
[59:43] until
[59:44] the last king
[59:46] wouldn't hear the prophets
[59:49] of attention
[59:50] full of sin
[59:52] full of death
[59:55] full of hatred of the audio full of lust
[59:57] of money lust of things
[1:00:02] that's what happened when death entered
[1:00:04] in
[1:00:07] it's a horrible thing
[1:00:10] and because of that
[1:00:13] babylon came and they they
[1:00:16] captured them and destroyed the kingdom
[1:00:23] and then we we see a picture of
[1:00:26] nebuchadnezzar
[1:00:30] who who remembers the dream
[1:00:32] nebuchadnezzar had cuantos
[1:00:37] he couldn't he couldn't
[1:00:39] understand what that dream dream meant
[1:00:44] so finally
[1:00:46] daniel comes in finally
[1:00:49] and he interprets that dream
[1:00:53] and it was a dream of a great image
[1:00:57] he had a head of gold
[1:01:00] he had a chest and arms of silver denial
[1:01:04] he had legs of iron or he had a waste of
[1:01:07] brass
[1:01:18] and dave or daniel begin to interpret
[1:01:21] this dream daniel
[1:01:25] and he said this is the gentile kingdom
[1:01:30] after
[1:01:32] the last kingdom failed god um the last
[1:01:36] kingdom of the jews
[1:01:40] it was the kingdom of the gentiles that
[1:01:42] took over era el reyno de los gentiles
[1:01:45] dominar and the gold was nebuchadnezzar
[1:01:50] i believe the silver was persia
[1:01:53] a la plata representable brass was
[1:01:55] greece
[1:01:58] iron was rome
[1:02:01] roma and the mix was rome and and
[1:02:04] produces prodigies
[1:02:10] it was a mix
[1:02:12] and that was from that time all the way
[1:02:14] to now yes
[1:02:18] that image is still being built or is
[1:02:20] showing itself
[1:02:25] indeed the way these people they built
[1:02:27] their kingdoms
[1:02:30] who knows of alexander the great
[1:02:50] they would go and they would conquer
[1:02:52] cities
[1:02:54] they would they were with blood on in on
[1:02:57] their shields
[1:03:04] the way they became kings was was uh by
[1:03:08] force
[1:03:12] it was by power it was by fear
[1:03:39] alexander the great would come in
[1:03:41] everybody was afraid
[1:03:46] that's how they built their kingdoms
[1:03:50] they were separated from god
[1:03:54] they didn't know anything else all they
[1:03:55] knew was death and
[1:04:02] and that's how the gentile kingdoms were
[1:04:04] were established and made all the way to
[1:04:07] today
[1:04:09] foreign
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:23] hearing all the stories of what they did
[1:04:29] but i want you to notice that all these
[1:04:31] kingdoms made one image
[1:04:37] showing that there was one true ruler of
[1:04:40] them
[1:04:44] there was one image of all these
[1:04:46] kingdoms
[1:04:48] even though the kingdoms would would
[1:04:50] defeat one another
[1:05:06] he was ruling over everybody
[1:05:10] and the world is his now
[1:05:13] el mundo esta
[1:05:15] it's his kingdom now
[1:05:18] the devil is the ruler el diablo
[1:05:38] he said
[1:05:40] as you look
[1:05:41] a stone was caught by no man
[1:05:44] by no human hand commodity como puede
[1:05:51] and it struck the image on its feet of
[1:05:53] iron and clay and broke them into pieces
[1:06:02] then the iron the clay the bronze the
[1:06:05] silver the gold all together were broken
[1:06:07] pieces and became the chaff of summer
[1:06:10] threshing floors
[1:06:14] foreign
[1:06:21] and the wind carried them away and there
[1:06:23] was not a trace of them could be found
[1:06:25] but the stone that struck the image
[1:06:27] became a great mountain and filled the
[1:06:30] whole earth
[1:06:40] and verse 44 he interprets what that
[1:06:43] stone was
[1:06:48] and in the days of those kings
[1:06:50] the god of heaven will set up a kingdom
[1:06:53] that shall never be destroyed
[1:07:03] nor shall the kingdom be left to another
[1:07:06] it shall break into pieces all of these
[1:07:09] kingdoms and bring them to an end and it
[1:07:11] shall stand forever
[1:07:25] that said that one would come down to
[1:07:27] destroy
[1:07:28] sin okay
[1:07:32] destroy the one that caused it
[1:07:37] and destroyed everything that sin caused
[1:07:54] the jews have been waiting for that loss
[1:07:57] they were waiting for that messiah to
[1:08:00] come
[1:08:02] they're waiting for for a savior to come
[1:08:08] they were already in bondage for so many
[1:08:10] years
[1:08:13] and maybe they were waiting for a king
[1:08:16] as bloody as david
[1:08:21] they maybe they were waiting for a king
[1:08:23] that was greater than alexander
[1:08:28] alejandro maybe they're
[1:08:29] waiting for a king that was more
[1:08:31] terrible than nebuchadnezzar
[1:08:36] brother branham says in the signs of his
[1:08:38] coming uh
[1:08:41] now this is john
[1:08:43] telling the pharisees
[1:08:45] juan hablando
[1:08:47] finally you have the foreigner of that
[1:08:50] coming of the lord
[1:09:05] standing out here he said he will
[1:09:07] thoroughly purge the his floor
[1:09:15] he will gather up the wheat into his
[1:09:17] garner and he will sweep her clean
[1:09:24] he will burn the chaff and with
[1:09:27] unquenchable fire
[1:09:29] olympia
[1:09:31] lapaja
[1:10:13] the bible says there was no beauty that
[1:10:15] we should desire of him
[1:10:20] he was a man of sorrow acquainted with
[1:10:22] grief
[1:10:26] that's who came is
[1:10:34] people were waiting for a great
[1:10:35] alexander lagentes
[1:10:37] alejandro look at how all these men they
[1:10:40] established their kingdom
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:06] and i could see
[1:11:07] that image
[1:11:11] who is that image it's it's nothing but
[1:11:13] the devil nothing but satan
[1:11:19] within all these
[1:11:20] these kingdoms
[1:11:23] saying this is the one you send
[1:11:36] he said the kingdom of god is at hand
[1:11:47] but he didn't come with all these great
[1:11:49] things he was clothed in humility
[1:12:04] that doesn't come with all of that but
[1:12:06] he comes all by himself
[1:12:11] at that time he didn't even have any
[1:12:13] followers
[1:12:16] he didn't even have generals
[1:12:19] he didn't have anybody to back him up
[1:12:23] but yet he was the king
[1:12:28] the king of all kings
[1:12:30] and he wasn't going to come by force he
[1:12:32] was going to come with atomic bombs
[1:12:41] what kind of kingdom is this
[1:12:44] what kind of upside down kingdom is this
[1:12:49] that is going to come with weakness
[1:12:53] that if somebody
[1:12:54] slapped you in the face you turned the
[1:12:56] other cheeks
[1:13:00] where you forgive your enemies
[1:13:14] how is he going to tear down this great
[1:13:16] image
[1:13:42] he didn't have no beauty that we should
[1:13:44] desire
[1:14:13] just like goliath when he saw david walk
[1:14:15] up to him
[1:14:20] you're sending this little boy did you
[1:14:21] say is you're sending this little thing
[1:14:24] to conquer me i stopped
[1:14:35] probably said he's no one better than
[1:14:38] than adam and and abraham
[1:14:54] because i'm the one that reigns
[1:14:57] death is the one that reigned over
[1:14:59] everybody
[1:15:02] he didn't even use any any power all he
[1:15:05] used was his words
[1:15:11] and finally the devil
[1:15:15] got him through the jews
[1:15:20] and he says we are going to kill him
[1:15:25] we are going to do the same exact thing
[1:15:27] we did to isia
[1:15:30] the same we did to jeremiah
[1:15:33] the same we did to john the baptist
[1:16:03] the son of man going up there
[1:16:08] they roved him with
[1:16:10] with kingly clothes
[1:16:14] they bowed their knee and mocked him
[1:16:16] apostles
[1:16:33] he was about to establish the greatest
[1:16:35] kingdom that has ever lived
[1:16:41] whenever he came he came on a white
[1:16:43] donkey albino el bino
[1:16:46] blanco and they said hosanna hosanna the
[1:16:48] king the son of david
[1:16:54] and there him walking to calvary
[1:16:58] people laughing at him some crying la
[1:17:00] gente
[1:17:09] he said you shouldn't be weeping for me
[1:17:11] you should weep for yourselves
[1:17:16] that you have your children you should
[1:17:18] weep for yourselves
[1:17:22] because this whole kingdom is going to
[1:17:23] be turned upside down
[1:17:28] he says no man taketh my life
[1:17:32] he says i have power to lay it down
[1:17:36] no wonder the bible says for god so
[1:17:39] loved the world
[1:17:57] time that's when he said it's time for
[1:17:59] me to give my life
[1:18:03] he had control of the situation
[1:18:07] and at jesus's worst hour
[1:18:11] jesus yellow was the most glorious hour
[1:18:13] fuel or gloriosa because when the sting
[1:18:16] of death began to go upon the son of man
[1:18:22] every blow that the devil gave him
[1:18:26] diablo
[1:18:28] jesus would take his power jesus
[1:18:31] jesus would take the power back from him
[1:18:35] every strike that he gave his back
[1:18:41] everything he did to him jesus begin to
[1:18:43] take the power back from the devil
[1:18:48] jesus
[1:18:50] his most shameful day from
[1:19:06] because jesus
[1:19:20] he didn't do it like like george
[1:19:22] washington
[1:19:24] or george washington didn't do it like
[1:19:25] alexander all these other kings
[1:19:31] he clothed himself with humility
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:47] god says you shall surely die
[1:19:52] you shall surely i'll make sure you die
[1:19:57] i'll i'll be there when you die
[1:20:02] because he said surely
[1:20:04] he said it's gonna happen
[1:20:08] and that was the word of the lord yes
[1:20:14] and every price of death is on our head
[1:20:17] now
[1:20:21] he went to establish his kingdom
[1:20:25] and he said you know what this is how
[1:20:27] i'm going to establish it
[1:20:31] this is how i'm going to free my people
[1:20:35] this is how i'm going to
[1:20:38] defeat the enemy
[1:20:41] the only way you can get rid of death
[1:20:58] is
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:53] i'm going to take their sins upon me
[1:21:59] and he put it upon us
[1:22:02] he put his love upon us
[1:22:06] and he covered us
[1:22:08] and when the devil thought he had him
[1:22:12] he said i can't believe he
[1:22:14] he fell for this
[1:22:18] i can't believe we have this man that
[1:22:20] calls himself the son of god in our
[1:22:22] hands
[1:22:46] oh remember whenever you killed abraham
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:14] and this man is
[1:23:16] nothing
[1:23:17] less than any of those
[1:23:33] and people yelling and screaming
[1:23:36] saying if you're the son of god get
[1:23:38] yourself out of there
[1:23:41] today other ladies crying saying oh god
[1:23:44] why
[1:23:46] is
[1:23:57] was in control the whole time jesus is
[1:24:11] but he wasn't full of blood like david
[1:24:13] was or alexander all these other kings
[1:24:19] it was his own blood
[1:24:22] it was his own blood shedding on calvary
[1:24:27] for the human race
[1:24:37] he just didn't say god loved him
[1:24:41] god loves you
[1:24:57] he said i cannot stand to see my
[1:25:00] children the way they are
[1:25:04] i so love them what can i do
[1:25:09] i'll go down there myself
[1:25:13] finally whenever the devil had him the
[1:25:15] sting the stinger of death went in him
[1:25:21] the bee says i got him death said i got
[1:25:24] him
[1:25:36] people say that a bee can only stink
[1:25:38] once
[1:25:43] in reality it
[1:25:44] that's not true
[1:25:47] these are meant to sting other insects
[1:25:51] foreign
[1:26:00] but whenever they go to a great mammal
[1:26:02] or a human being
[1:26:20] when he pulls
[1:26:39] but whenever he went and he tried to
[1:26:42] kill the son of man
[1:26:44] the savior of the world
[1:27:07] and then whenever he got out that
[1:27:08] stinger stayed in that son of man
[1:27:16] and jesus took away the power of death
[1:27:18] from him
[1:27:22] on that day on calvary
[1:27:25] and maybe he was telling the devil
[1:27:27] something's wrong
[1:27:30] something's not right something didn't
[1:27:33] work the way it used to
[1:27:35] be
[1:27:38] and the devil says okay hold on hold on
[1:27:42] i'm hearing footsteps coming down from
[1:27:44] my
[1:27:45] door
[1:27:49] and whenever he opens the door it was
[1:27:51] jesus christ
[1:27:54] it was here full of power full of glory
[1:27:58] you know the gloria what was he doing he
[1:28:00] was taking the keys of death and howl
[1:28:02] back
[1:28:06] i'm establishing my kingdom
[1:28:10] i'm taking back the kingdom
[1:28:39] the power of death is sin
[1:29:22] jesus is there in that board meeting
[1:29:26] he says you know what i have the keys
[1:29:28] i'm i'm the one that calls the shots now
[1:29:34] i'm the one that decides yo el que voya
[1:29:49] let me see nope he's covered by the
[1:29:51] blood
[1:29:54] no my record show is clean
[1:29:58] your record show she's she's forgiven me
[1:30:02] he has the power now
[1:30:18] will be sitting there with
[1:30:20] the king.
[1:30:24] and he'll go with death and hell and
[1:30:27] they'll have to stand before him the
[1:30:29] bible says
[1:30:39] and the bible says that he takes them
[1:30:41] and throws him into the lake of fire
[1:30:46] he throws
[1:30:52] don't be afraid of the lake of fire
[1:30:56] that's god's own fire this is
[1:31:00] is the only one that can create an
[1:31:02] annihilation
[1:31:06] the same one that died on calvary
[1:31:10] brother branham or the bible says that
[1:31:12] was the second death
[1:31:56] he freed us from depression
[1:31:59] he freed us from sickness
[1:32:02] that's what the kinsmen redeemer does
[1:32:06] he redeems the land
[1:32:09] he redeems the people
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:39] no somos dinos but lord because you died
[1:32:41] on that cross
[1:32:45] each and every person sitting here
