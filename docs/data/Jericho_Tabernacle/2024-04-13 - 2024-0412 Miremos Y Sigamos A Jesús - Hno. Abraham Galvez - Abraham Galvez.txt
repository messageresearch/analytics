all that power that was from the time of job is still [Music] here they tell me the history books but it's a history that's in us who prepared to listen to the word and became an [Music] expectation and in this for we be giving um place to the [Music] minister it's a pleasure to give the place to our brother ABR Gales SOS as interpreter brother Emmanuel Santos am who's expecting something from Jehovah if you please stand with me and with that same Spirit we'll be singing to the Lord amen for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] gloren [Music] [Music] I oh re for [Music] [Music] Le [Music] [Music] me [Music] the Lord bless you Brothers God bless you tonight it is a pleasure I believe is also a very great way to be able to bring God's word to his people uh because they deserve the best amen expecting to receive something from the Lord just as we're standing not to keep you standing for so long I would like to read in Isaiah [Music] 4522 once you find it you can say Amen Isaiah 45:22 if you have it the word of the Lord says lto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else let's bow our heads our loving Heavenly Father Lord we thank you tonight for this brand new opportunity that you have given us to come to your house we're asking that you be the one that comes down on the scene and don't just allow it to be a simple young man that is speaking to the people but Let It Be You Lord we put this service in your hands hoping that you can be pleased with us and speak to us as well we ask for all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Brothers we thank the musicians uh tonight I would like to speak on a subject uh the title I would like to call it uh let us look and follow Jesus and the decision uh for this subject [Music] is a specifically thinking on the time that we're currently living in uh I believe there's nothing better that we can do than to look onto and follow the lord Jesus Christ because just as he said here in his word in Isaiah 45 look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else because he's the only on that can give us our Salvation the only one that we can look onto and follow which is a a secure place where you can have your salvation because he says for I am God and there is none else if we look on the outside to other religions they have what they call uh several Saints to whom they pray a lot too they have St Jude and so on which is the saint for protection for your wellbeing uh but they forget that there's only one that all of them rest that they call supposedly Saints they can't answer back to them because there's only one which lives and he holds all the answers that you will ever need which is able to answer you for any specific thing and I would like to read in the message uh look unto Jesus in the second page paragraph number 10 he says and I ask myself in the time now that we're now living in it says what could we look to that would be more solid than God and God is his word so look to the word of God today for your answer the Bible has the answer for this day it's had it for other days it's got it forever because it is Christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother Bram he asked the question is there something or something that we can look onto that is more solid than God Something That We're secure in that has the real promise that can answer any question that you may have because he's the only one that holds the answer and he has left it here in his word and maybe it would just seem like it's an ancient book and you might say well that was just in the times of of past when he would just answer those things but it wasn't only for past times but there's also an answer currently today for the things that you're going to and you can find it in the Bible because reading here in the Bible I I was remembering that in the last pages in the back when the end comes to the entire Book of Revelation there's a there's a guy a guiding Angel there and he was looking unto that guide that there were some rows and in a line that said that for salvation uh home or family problems things like that and he would give them scriptures for that and those are still answers currently for today so then uh brother vam says and I wonder in a time that we are living in now what could we look to would be more solid than God because we could follow uh thousands of gods that are on the outside but none is more solid than God himself and why because they're lifeless not a single one of them will be able to answer back to you God is the only one that's why he said say for I am God and there is none else if we can place it in in a human life outside of the spiritual realm there's sometimes there's people that follow other people they look up to these people and they want to be like them they want their life to mirror the the person that they're following but if you start thinking man can't just simply follow a man a man just can't simply set his eyes on another man because man can fail but God will never fail you now if you begin to think all these people that follow other people they say oh I want my life to be just like that person's life I want to be just like them because they have a lot of money uh they're known by a lot of people but there comes a moment that that person that they're following their eyes are so set on that person in their life they're mimicking every step that that other person is making in that moment that that other person uh commits a failure or makes a mistake now they're just left thinking what do I do now that person they failed here they lost everything now no one knows them and and at that moment they have two choices they just remain lost without knowing what to do or they just keep following him and continue in the same steps that they were in that's why it says there is no one that is more solid or firm than God because when your eyes are set on Jesus Christ when you in your spiritual life your spiritual eyesight is placed on Jesus Christ you say I want to have the life of Jesus Christ I want my life to be just like the life of Jesus Christ then you can rest assured that there won't be any failures then in your life and if you start taking the steps and you set your eyes on Jesus Christ what you will find is salvation and why did I touch this subject on how people look up to other people and they follow these other people uh remembering when I was in school in high school I I remember I was taking an English class and the teacher she gave us this uh project that we had to do I really don't recall the story that it was [Music] but more or less I think it was about a girl that was from palast or Pakistan or more or less around there that in her country where she was at they wouldn't allow girls to go to school so this girl began to break the rules trying to get the girls to go back to school she was even going to go to court to be able to fight this case so that the the girls can go back to school so at the end of the project the teacher asked us to do a certain job and during that time there was a lot of people that would love look up to this specific girl and they would say wow it's an awesome thing that this girl has accomplished I want to do that so then she gave us the task of finding our own role model that we would like to follow who we would look up to and why is it that person was so inspiring for us to follow them I believe that's the only homework at school that I really didn't do because I never really regarded someone else as someone that I look up to at church I can uh admire the work of a Preacher of a song leader but outside in the world I really don't regard anyone else as someone to look up to because like I said a man can't follow another man just like it says that a it's the blind leading the blind both will end up being lost falling into a hole it's the same thing that happens that when when someone is following the life of someone else that is in the world it's just simply a blind person leading another blind person and both will fall into the same pit but we do have a person that we can follow that gave his life for you and that's the most admirable thing that you can see that a person ever did in this world if the world does not regard that as something admirable because they consider these little minor things that are senseless to be admirable things but just the thing that a person came down and then he gave him gave his life for you how can we not admire that how can we not say well I that's what I want to follow follow that person that gave his life for me he didn't he didn't care about my mistakes anything that I ever did he uh he erased it and he forgave it and better yet he only loved me even though it was our very human race that killed him nevertheless he still loved us I would like to keep reading in that message and looking unto Jesus paragraph told he says and you say I've done that it depends on what you looked at determines what you look at is where and what you look for him for what are you looking at what purpose do you have in looking at him it only depends on what you look for that's what you find well I can't say well I come to church I have my my life centered in Christ but the the real question that you should ask yourself is my life truly centered in Christ because it's one thing to attend church and it's something entirely different to Center your life in God it might seem that for someone else those two might be the same thing but they're actually different because you say well I do live the Christian Life I go to church I sing I participate I do all these things but why is it that you do it what's your reason for doing it do you just simply do it because everyone else does it or because you're told to do it or something that comes from your heart you've seen God in your life and you've said I do it because he did something for me he changed the path of my life and at the time that he did that for me why not then serve him why not then worship him if he changed what my past life was and then brother bam keeps saying it says it only depends on what you look for that's what you find and sometimes it seems and it's better yet it's not that we find him but he finds us because it was in the very moment that we had a need we didn't know where to find the answer we didn't know where else to look and depending what you're looking for that's what you will find if we can set an example just like when you're in a moment where you have a need in your life let's say you need money and you're you're lacking many things and you begin to look for jobs you go somewhere you go to a certain place you can't find it there you go somewhere else you can't find it there until you finally get somewhere you can find what you were needing you come to appreciate that certain thing because that's exactly what you needed it's the same thing in the spiritual we could have been lost in the world just uh wasting away in the privilege and all the pleasures that the world will offer you but then a time comes in the life of that people that that the things of the world can no longer fit them they feel such a void in their very being that they it's something that can't they can't explain he says well it's just maybe a strange feeling maybe just with a few drinks that I'll take I'll I'll get over this and I'll forget it I'll go out to a party with my friends and then I'll forget about the fact that I feel alone they do all that and then when they come back home they still feel alone maybe it's not because just because the house is is by itself but rather there's this little space within the human heart that is empty that feeling that the things of the world can't fulfill you and then truly they don't provide anything anything good for your life but then suddenly he found us for some reason or another someone approached you and and uh made the offer for you to come to church and and you'll see well I I'll see what it's about I'll see what happens and at that moment you don't come really expecting anything maybe you just came because a great friend inviting you you say well that's fine and sitting right there in that moment because God gives you what you need not what you want but rather what you need sitting right there in that moment maybe you were listening to every problem that you had in your life for every need that you were having throughout your life and then all of a sudden that void begins to be filled it becomes an unexplainable feeling because it became a feeling that it's a new found feeling that you never felt before that maybe it's something that you needed that's where you found your answer so that's where just like he said it all depends what you're looking for that's what you will find if you're looking for salvation God will give you an answer for that if you're looking for more faith God will answer that but it's also it's something that has to come from your heart to approach even more so that your heart your very eyes and everything can be set on God like uh personally I came in a moment in my life it's a really just like a small testimony in the year [Music] 2022 I went through a lot of different things in my life so I got to the point if God actually uh did exist and all of that began to grow even more because during that time I had to work so I really couldn't come to church that often so uh maybe throughout the whole week I would work from 3:00 to 10: at night and so Sundays too I would have to work from 3:00 to 10: so my mindset while I was in church is that I have to get out early because I have to go straight to work and truly during that time in my life go the things of God were just set to one side and during that time I was thinking well things are going fine for me because you know they tell you that when you leave God you leave church and things go bad for you but as time went on that that void began to come up but sometimes you really doubt if God is really with you and you might say well I come to church I serve him I've had my heart set on him but I've never really believed in like I've said before God is there but sometimes we can't see him but he's always with us so in that very same year of [Music] 2022 in the month of July when we went to the country of Salvador brother Marco Santana brother Lis agil it's that's when I began to go through all of that and when we got to El salvad uh my I was with my other brother my my middle brother uh not the one that's here he's the actually the eldest and I was with him it was H during the night before the the meetings the services that were going to be held over there and my brother said to me he says are you fine and I said yeah why do you ask he says I just wanted to know he asked how's your spiritual life doing and I think all I said well fine and he said he said are you sure he says well if I'm really being honest with you I'm having a lot of doubts if God really exists I said why do we even go to church sometimes I even come to think that I actually don't believe I've seen so many things that I really I haven't seen him and my brother began to talk with me because I even told him that I was thinking of I was getting to that point of thinking leaving church he began to talk to me and and he also prayed for me and he said he said God is with you but even though you can't see him he's he's there with you and then the next day that's when we went to the services there in in Salvador that were being held maros where brother Lu and brother Marcos preached first brother Lu preached and then brother Marcos preached and when brother Marcos went up to to preach he began to speak about his own wife's testimony and his testimony as well and the time came when he was done preaching that he said he says for all those young people that are having those doubts if God really exists he said if God is with you so what really surprised me and what impacted me is he said every single word that my brother and I were talking about before it was not just by chance and I was shocked and I I turned to look at my brother and my my brother was just sobbing in tears because he stated every single word that me and my brother talked about and that struck me so hard I I couldn't really have a reaction for that once we left the service my brother and I we were heading home and then he asked me he said did you listen to today's service see I said yes he said did you hear what the brother said yes he says that's the same thing we talked about yesterday he says there's your answer sometimes as I've said before he found us not we found him he sought for us and what other motive do you need just to worship him I'll keep reading here and the same message looking onto Jesus there's two two different kinds of eyesight that people can have and one is the real one in paragraph 14 he says many people go to the services and just to be seen and sometimes people go to services this is too bad to say this and we could Linger on it a long time but they go to church with their mind already made up before they go if certain things is said or something just against their idea against their their idea they'll get up right up and walk out they just simply will not stand because they've got their own idea what it must be like I said there's two kinds of eyesight for example like I mentioned before we could say well I come to church but you have your own idea of what you want to hear and as I said before God gives us what we need sometimes you get up Sunday morning you come and you say well today I want to hear about salvation today I want to hear about God's love or rather better yet I want this particular brother to preach because that brother has such a fire that he even makes me jump service comes they begin to say that we're Sinners because how we dress our mistakes and in your in your attitude is well I wanted to hear nice beautiful words not to be scolded and then the brother that's up there I really don't like how he preaches he's really boring the way he just does it but sometimes those uh reprimands or scoldings that we're listening maybe uh the reprimands are things that are happening in a life maybe it's not for you or for your brother that's to your side but there is a person in the audience that really needs to hear that to hear that that they would said that we were once Sinners that we were once lost but we were saved when we come to hear about God we can't come with a certain mindset on what to hear or try to reason God's word because God's word cannot be reasoned God's word is believe D well this what they're telling me it's really hurting me but it's the truth maybe physically I'm unable to see God maybe I'm just reading about God but even though I have not seen him I believe it and you don't start reasoning no you might say well what he said what he just said that's wrong that that's not right the Bible means this and that the messenger meant this and that people have their own idea they have their own reasoning but they want to hear what they want to hear but God is giving you what you need to hear but you need to see that we want to see with our own Earthly eyes and we're not saying that we have to see look and follow God with our own Earthly eyes but with your spiritual eyes sometimes you might say well I don't I don't get what he's saying I don't think he actually means that at the moment that you start seeing with your spiritual eyes you'll see and understand other things that you've never seen before and understood before but always remembering that God is not looked for with reasoning you can't search him with your just your reasoning you search him with with your heart and you believe him with all your heart that's the way to believe and see God with all your heart I would like to read this scripture Deuteronomy 429 Deuteronomy 4 9 when you have it you can say Amen do you have it God's word says it says but if from then Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God Thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy Soul now notice what it says it says if thou seek him with your thoughts and your reasoning does it say that it doesn't right but it says rather if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy Soul that's the way that you seek God up above in the scripture it's speaks about the different gods of uh of uh wood and gold and that's what we said at the very beginning that there's thousands of gods but there's only one that we should look for and when you start looking for that God the way you should do is with all your heart and with all your soul let's keep reading in this message in paragraph 30 says Sometimes they come in a man will judge you by what kind of clothes if you don't wear ministerial clothes and so forth then that's out they won't have nothing to do with you sometimes they want to look to see what kind of education you have if you speak your words proper if you stand correctly how you use your nouns and pronouns frankly I don't know which is noun or pronoun I couldn't tell you so that's out for me and I just don't know I couldn't make the difference between a noun and a pronoun I did when I was in school but I have forgotten that a long time ago so it says so also people have their eyes set on different people they have their eyes set on every one of us how do I dress if they're dressing with the suit on well that brother he used that same shirt last Sunday people have their eyes set on the things of other people they have their eyes or their sight set on the lives of other people than in their own life when it shouldn't be like that we should be more concerned about our own life then how the brother is dressed if the brother believes the word if the brother lives the word be concerned about your own self if you live the word if you believe the word if you're truly dressing properly just worry about yourself if actually if we see a brother is failing somewhere if we have our life and our eyes set on God we know that the least that we could do is criticize the life of the brother because no one here is perfect or if you never made a mistake please raise your hand all that we have left to do is just to pray for the brother motivate the brother remind remind them that we have to set our eyes on someone and that can happen just as well with the Christian and as well the people in the world they have their eyes set on us they have a certain eyesight or expectation on what a Christian should be and the people in the world will notice carefully in every single detail of your life and if you make a mistake doing this they say well they supposedly they're Christian look at him he's listening to that kind of music saying cursed words and profanity dressing like that and he's supposedly a Christian and I say it because one time it happened to me not because I did something and but rather we were at school during lunchtime and it was about to be the graduation was approaching uh prom was going to was about to happen so my parents they raised me that a Christian doesn't mix himself with the people of the world one Spirit doesn't mingle itself with another spirit because what is a spirit going to do that knows what's right and wrong mixing in mixing itself in the things are that are just simply wrong things they have different thinking than we do well then so then they were uh we were talking and they asked you know are you going to prom and one was saying well I don't know I don't know what to wear I don't know who's going to pick me up give me a ride and then they asked me Abraham are you going no I said no and they said why it says I'm actually a Christian and I don't go to those things and that person got upset they began to say a bunch of things to me it says you Christians are hypocrites I've seen people that call themselves Christians they drink and they do all these things they go to dances and whatever more you think you're better than us you're the most hypocritical people that there are he says well I don't know what kind of Christian you've seen I don't know what person you saw but we are sure of one thing we're not perfect we have our own mistakes and I'm saying because all of us just like they told me you think you all of you are better than us it's not that we feel that we're better or we're believing that we're better we're just the same we're just different and they don't understand us they don't understand why we do such things or why we do such things but we're the same we're just simply Sinners trying to get out of sin struggling and fighting to improve fighting to get to a place because we don't want to just stay here on this Earth that's why we have to set our eyes on Jesus Christ he's our only way out of this Earth they have they're they're looking at different things than we are they're looking forward to uh reaching 200 or 300 years of life but we that have read the Bible in the message we know that we're very close to the very end when this Earth will come to its end if brother brandom about 50 years ago was saying that the world is falling apart that hardly anything was left for the Lord to come then how close are we today that's why we should be concerned on what we're looking at if our eyes are truly set on Christ and if better yet if our eyes are out of focus because sometimes doubts come yeah and sometimes you say well I well I'm still a Christian and then you go outside and then you say well the Lord will forgive me anyway I can make as many as a thousand mistakes in my life and the Lord will forgive me for every one of them by the way they always tell me that the lord gave his life for us that's another eyesight and that's even worse because you know the difference between right and wrong and then you still go for what's wrong and then you want to come back to what's right but when you come to God it has to be with a sincere repentance you truly repent of what you did not because the Lord will forgive me out of the way because I do come to church I serve here at the church it has to be heartfelt repentance because just like he said depends what you look at that's what you will find if you're looking for salvation you will find it but you have to be sincere sincerely seek it out from your very heart get to that very feeling where you feel that you can't live any more without having that salvation like David once said to God restore unto me the joy of my salvation he never lost it what he lost was the joy of knowing that he was saved the same thing goes with us we have not lost salvation it's just you have to seek it out you need it let it be something that comes from your heart for you to seek for it if you can please stand and the musicians can come up truly that's what we need our eyes to be set on God not carnally but spiritually to be concerned that your life is centered in God and to the young people I could say maybe there will be thousands of doubts that come in our life and thousands of remarks that come from other people that they we might come to say well that's true it's better for me just to leave church don't set your eyes on what your friends and everyone else thinks they will not save you the time will come that we will come to judgment and by then we would already know what was good and we de excited to get away from that so be concerned that your eyes are set on God don't follow other people or other things because a time of Darkness will come over your life that you will not know what to do and I don't I believe that no one wants to be in that state of desperation to look for God and you can't find anything look for God while he can still be found because a time will come over this Earth where everything will be closed you will no longer be able to go to church you can't look for God anymore but if you have already set your eyes on him you still have time because there's very very little time left so it I think it benefits us that we know where we're looking at let's Close Our Eyes our loving Heavenly Father Lord we thank you at this time for all that you've done for us but we also ask for your help we're asking that you show yourself in our lives and that you help us to [Music] change because salvation is already [Music] set all we have to do is accept it we're asking you Lord that you please help us to set our eyes on you and take our eyes off from the world but rather be more
