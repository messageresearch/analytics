[52:13] bride but i started
[52:15] you have to be remarried
[52:19] to the word of god which is christ
[52:24] now we understand in order to use that
[52:26] phrase or that word
[52:30] remarried
[52:44] and i don't want you to misunderstand me
[52:47] i'm speaking in the spiritual hablo in
[52:49] the spiritual but i know the natural
[52:51] typifies the spiritual
[52:52] natural spiritual to use the word
[52:55] remarried uh
[53:27] and i hope that uh he's still not your
[53:29] husband yes
[53:32] but the ramp says it's your flesh
[53:36] it's your nature is your first husband
[53:38] is a supreme response yeah nothing to do
[53:40] with it

[53:58] speeding a hundred miles an hour in a
[53:59] fifty five
[54:00] fifteen fifty five fifty five mile lane
[54:37] really obedient when it comes to that
[54:38] right real beating for that

[56:15] there's i always struggle with my flesh
[56:19] i'm not in my theory my uh my body of
[56:22] theophany yes
[56:25] correct that's what the apostle paul
[56:28] says
[56:41] amen amen now in our scripture
[56:45] we find here jesus giving a parable
[56:49] a woman who is married
[56:52] brother ram says she's a good honest
[56:54] clean woman this is but she lost
[56:58] one of her coins what does that mean
[57:01] question if you guys let's let's see
[57:03] what brother bram says i want him to
[57:05] explain it
[57:08] says jesus christ this is
[57:24] her husband was gone and she lost one of
[57:28] her coins out of her tablet
[57:33] now i will try to explain that
[57:37] today if a woman is married
[57:41] she would wear a wedding ring as a sign
[57:43] that she is married
[57:47] that's to keep other man from having
[57:49] anything to do with her es
[57:51] para impedience
[58:17] and that was a sign that they were a
[58:20] married woman
[58:24] no man was to fool with him
[58:28] no boys was to flirt with them
[58:33] they were married
[58:40] uh but i haven't i'm trying i'm going to
[58:42] try to keep my word as close as possible
[58:47] i could tell you what each one of those
[58:49] coins meant
[58:53] it was placed there and each coin meant
[58:55] a certain virtue of that woman
[59:01] a certain virtue sierta virtude uh the
[59:04] first
[59:05] el primero meaning her love to her
[59:07] husband represents
[59:10] second second her pledge to avert you to
[59:14] live
[59:14] live clean for him promesa
[59:28] if you want to look it up look in
[59:29] galatians five
[59:33] you find it out that a woman has
[59:34] represented the church
[59:38] and the church is a spouse wife to
[59:41] christ
[1:00:24] she is supposed to have these these ten
[1:00:26] coins
[1:00:39] and the church is supposed to be wearing
[1:00:40] it right now
[1:00:44] because she doesn't have one of them
[1:00:49] she's not she's she's supposing that
[1:00:52] she's not married to her husband
[1:00:54] is
[1:01:34] the church should be wearing that coin
[1:01:50] david said restore to me the joy of my
[1:01:52] salvation
[1:01:56] god doesn't give happiness he gives joy
[1:02:01] but it doesn't matter what goes on in
[1:02:03] our lives
[1:02:15] there's a great pleasure inside of me
[1:02:31] we don't have uh you know
[1:02:34] so many things going on here and there
[1:02:36] but
[1:02:38] yeah we should have peace of mind
[1:02:43] suffering
[1:02:46] how many have long sufferings
[1:02:51] means patiently enduring lasting offense
[1:02:54] or hardships
[1:02:58] offenses or difficulties will you suffer
[1:03:01] for a long
[1:03:02] time you carry the sufferment of the
[1:03:06] people
[1:03:09] we are patiently doing these these
[1:03:11] offenses and these hardships
[1:03:23] you're gonna see if you're missing one
[1:03:24] of these coins
