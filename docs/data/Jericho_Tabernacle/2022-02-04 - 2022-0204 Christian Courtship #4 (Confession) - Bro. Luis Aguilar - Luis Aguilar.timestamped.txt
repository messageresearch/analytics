[45:20] amen amen last time we were here we left
[45:24] off on
[45:25] on character and on courtship
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] and i want to read a little quote here
[45:35] what brother branham says
[45:39] and then he wants fellowship
[45:43] and when we want courtship equando
[45:45] el cortejo
[45:47] and things like that
[45:50] it has to come on a basis of agreement
[45:55] man i believe that that's something that
[45:57] we've been speaking on as uh what we've
[46:00] been talking about
[46:03] that whenever a young person and a young
[46:05] couple they want to start courting
[46:10] there has to be in the basis of
[46:12] agreement
[46:23] and i like to just kind of finish what
[46:25] we uh what we were we left off last week
[46:31] so we can enter on the message of today
[46:35] and
[46:36] what we left off on how should i start
[46:39] courtship eternal
[46:42] now let's just say that the young person
[46:44] and the young lady are already in the
[46:46] form of friendship
[46:52] they've been doing things right
[46:54] they've
[46:56] they've been maintaining themselves as
[46:58] friends
[47:00] so uh what should you start what should
[47:02] you do
[47:05] both should pray and they should
[47:06] meditate
[47:19] young man he has a he has a
[47:21] responsibility
[47:24] the young man should talk to his his
[47:26] parents
[47:28] and talk to his pastor
[47:30] the young man then the goes to the
[47:32] pastor el joben yava con el pastor and
[47:35] the pastor will arrange a meeting to
[47:37] have a meeting with the girl's parents
[47:43] there at that moment the parents are
[47:45] going to see if it's okay for them to be
[47:47] courting
[47:48] momento los padres
[47:53] i want the young people to just
[47:54] understand something here
[47:57] i know they feel a little bit nervous
[48:00] and especially when they talk subjects
[48:02] like these
[48:03] elements
[48:05] when they say well you have to go talk
[48:07] to the pastor
[48:10] i want to say something
[48:12] i want to say that your pastor is here
[48:15] he's your best friend es
[48:17] i'm going to say that again your pasture
[48:20] pastor is your best friend esto mejor
[48:23] amigo he's going to play a big part
[48:27] and he's going to help you out
[48:29] i'm going to say that again
[48:31] he plays a big part elton
[48:33] and he's going to help you out
[48:35] what do you mean brother louise
[48:38] look brother i'm married
[48:41] when
[48:42] well i want to break this down but
[48:44] why is he going to be your best friend
[49:06] you know what the pastor is going to do
[49:09] is going to help you out
[49:11] he's going to intercede for you
[49:14] talk
[49:28] he's a good young man
[49:30] so i'm just giving you a little bit of
[49:31] an example
[49:34] that your pastor pastor is going to help
[49:36] you out
[49:38] a man amen
[49:39] so you shouldn't be afraid to go and
[49:41] talk to him
[50:08] now i got these
[50:09] three different different scenarios or
[50:11] different things here
[50:13] different scenarios
[50:15] i put someone who wants to car court
[50:18] local
[50:21] local
[50:22] or away or yeah
[50:34] there's young men that are young ladies
[50:35] that start dating in the same church
[50:52] when you're here local in the locals
[50:54] it's the same church
[50:57] you have the same pasture
[51:02] the young man knows the parents
[51:05] the young lady knows the other parents
[51:09] the pastor knows both the parents
[51:13] so they're what the young man should do
[51:16] it's very easy
[51:18] to go talk to the pastor
[51:21] it's very easy because they both share
[51:22] the same password
[51:26] now but when you're dating away
[51:30] if there's a young man here that wants
[51:31] to talk to a young lady from a different
[51:32] state
[51:37] here it's it's a little bit more work
[51:42] now when i when i was dating my wife
[51:44] when you established
[51:46] i was in texas
[51:48] she was here yesterday and
[51:50] what i did okay
[51:52] i what i i in this with a young man
[51:54] should be very careful
[51:58] because you can get it to a lot of
[51:59] trouble
[52:01] a man
[52:02] amen now you're dating in a different
[52:05] state
[52:07] you're dealing with two different
[52:08] pastors
[52:11] don't come to her hometown
[52:15] regardless of where she lives she lives
[52:18] in texas
[52:19] if she lives in colorado colorado don't
[52:22] you go to her hometown
[52:25] without talking to your pastor
[52:28] and then talk to the pastor where she
[52:30] lives
[52:30] at el pastores
[52:32] yeah i'm going to say that again
[52:34] don't you go to her hometown
[52:37] doesn't matter how much you love her
[52:39] and how much you prayed
[52:41] and a sign an angel came from heaven
[52:53] and tell her what you tell them what you
[52:55] want to do
[52:58] i'm sorry i'm sorry the pastor would
[52:59] tell you what to do
[53:03] hey man
[53:04] amen so you want to get permission
[53:07] before you go to her hometown
[53:11] before you can start the courtship antes
[53:12] aunt
[53:14] imagine you go fly into your hometown
[53:17] [Music]
[53:18] yeah you didn't even tell the pastor
[53:20] nila visas del pastor you didn't even
[53:21] tell her dad

[54:19] and when i that we we were doing having
[54:21] a formal friendship for about a year it

[55:25] road for me
[55:28] doesn't matter how good of a young man i
[55:30] was important
[55:32] or how i looked
[55:47] camino correcto and talk to her parents
[55:51] now if they're dating if they're from a
[55:53] different church
[55:56] iglesia the same thing
[55:59] that young man
[56:00] has to come and talk to the pastor
[56:05] because that's the sheep
[56:07] if she if he belongs to a different
[56:08] church
[56:10] and she belongs to a different church
[56:12] that young man
[56:14] has to have the enough
[56:23] i know i might seem like it's brother i
[56:24] think that's a little bit too much
[56:26] because
[56:30] i think they should just talk and just
[56:31] go with it
[56:34] well i think that's what's based off on
[56:36] the message on the scripture
[56:40] we should go and we should look for
[56:41] advice
[56:51] amen so i i hope that that is it is
[56:53] helping you there especially
[56:56] so here in this this evening
[56:58] with god's help we're going to speak on
[57:00] confession
[57:03] we're going to open our scriptures to
[57:04] first corinthians chapter 6
[57:10] verse 15
[57:12] this is the scripture that we left off
[57:14] on sunday
[57:17] first corinthians 6 chapter 6 chapter
[57:20] verse 15.
[57:23] here the apostle paul is asking some
[57:26] tremendous questions
[57:30] it says know ye not that your bodies are
[57:33] members of christ
[57:37] shall i then take the members of christ
[57:39] and make them members of a harlot
[57:43] members
[57:45] apostles god forbid
[57:49] so so what what are what is the apostle
[57:51] paul here saying
[58:08] have you seen my eyes that's me so close
[58:09] you see my nose there's me nadis you see
[58:11] my fingers there's miss devils it's all
[58:13] members son todos membros
[58:16] and let's just say that
[58:18] i'm another another example
[58:43] so i want you to just notice here what
[58:45] the pasta paul is saying
[59:17] [Music]
[59:44] he
[59:56] says they shall be one flesh
[1:00:28] he says but he that is joined unto the
[1:00:30] lord is one spirit
[1:00:36] because it's not something physically
[1:00:39] it's something spiritually that we're
[1:00:40] connected with
[1:00:55] 18.
[1:00:56] it says flee fornication
[1:01:00] every sin that a man doeth is without
[1:01:02] the body
[1:01:05] foreign
[1:01:11] he says he gives an example he says how
[1:01:13] will you flee
[1:01:16] you're just going to go
[1:01:18] bye
[1:01:20] see you later fornication
[1:01:35] he's not going to flee from fornication
[1:01:38] he's going to run towards foreign
[1:01:42] to be slick
[1:01:44] he wants to touch the young lady hold
[1:01:46] her hand
[1:01:48] they want to take pictures he wants to
[1:01:49] be a little bit closer
[1:02:06] but he that committed fornication
[1:02:08] sinneth against his own body
[1:02:11] foreign that's why last week i said
[1:02:14] do you believe in predestination
[1:02:18] when the lord
[1:02:24] amen amen when the lord jesus christ
[1:02:26] when he was crucified
[1:02:29] crucified we were crucified
[1:02:31] when he was buried
[1:02:43] and now you take that from the spiritual
[1:02:44] and you flip it to the natural
[1:02:58] you might not say brother i don't think
[1:02:59] it works that way
[1:03:02] i don't think the scripture makes a
[1:03:04] mistake
[1:03:06] every sin that a man do it is without
[1:03:08] the body
[1:03:10] if i smoke and i lie and i cheat
[1:03:56] many amens
[1:03:59] but i thank god for those amen
[1:04:02] because we're one body
[1:04:04] and someone here is sick
[1:04:07] they were all sick
[1:04:08] if someone lies
[1:04:10] then we all
[1:04:51] he says that question i don't know how
[1:04:52] you read it
[1:04:56] but i i i i my the way my mind think is
[1:04:58] kind of tremendous
[1:05:02] he says what you say you imagine
[1:05:05] somebody's talking to you know
[1:05:21] holy ghost
[1:05:23] which you you have of god
[1:05:27] and it is not of your own
[1:05:30] for you were bought with a price
[1:05:34] now let's just say you're renting an
[1:05:35] apartment
[1:05:38] you're renting a building to live in
[1:05:39] a division
[1:05:41] let's say i take the wall down
[1:05:45] another room
[1:05:47] i want to change the restroom
[1:05:50] can i do that
[1:05:52] no it's not mine no no that's what
[1:05:55] that's where the apostle paul says you
[1:05:56] were bought with a prize
[1:06:01] you were bad with the prize
[1:06:16] apostle paul
[1:06:29] the body of the wife
[1:06:48] let's go to uh
[1:06:52] proverbs 28.
[1:06:56] we're going to speak on confession
[1:06:58] hablar
[1:07:12] i don't matter how holy you are
[1:07:15] there has to be a confession
[1:07:19] no one should should get married without
[1:07:20] confession
[1:07:23] and that's a stage where there you're
[1:07:25] going to hear some hard things
[1:07:28] you're going to find out that that
[1:07:29] preacher is not so much of a holy man
[1:07:33] you're going to find out that that young
[1:07:34] lady who comes to church every sunday is
[1:07:36] not so holy santa cruz
[1:07:40] everyone
[1:07:44] we want to avoid is to not to make a big
[1:07:47] mistake
[1:07:49] you don't want to confess something
[1:07:51] that's that that's embarrassing that you
[1:07:53] don't want to tell your spouse
[1:08:22] we both have to be in mutual agreement
[1:08:26] and there we're going to see if you want
[1:08:27] to continue on
[1:08:31] amen confession i'm going to read the
[1:08:32] definition of confession
[1:08:36] a formal statement admitting that one is
[1:08:39] guilty of a crime
[1:08:46] again it's a formal statement admitting
[1:08:48] that one is guilty of a crime
[1:08:51] declaration
[1:08:55] amen don't you thank god for sending a
[1:08:58] prophet
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] to to make us better people
[1:09:04] uh
[1:09:12] that's what we should be aiming for
[1:09:15] if the denomination is if they have good
[1:09:17] marriages
[1:09:32] according with the young ladies
[1:09:34] that young man should already have the
[1:09:36] holy ghost
[1:09:40] and he should already be working
[1:09:44] i believe that that young man
[1:09:52] go home with your dad and start working
[1:09:53] at around the house
[1:09:57] if he's he'd be still in school go work
[1:09:59] on saturdays clean up a barber shop
[1:10:06] because now that young man he's already
[1:10:08] looking towards marriage
[1:10:12] starts having a savings account
[1:10:28] that's me that's
[1:11:10] i work as a truck driver from monday
[1:11:11] through friday
[1:11:17] monday through friday
[1:11:19] and a barber on saturday
[1:11:21] i started saving putting a savings
[1:11:23] account
[1:11:26] and i started seeing the money go up
[1:11:29] so when i got to the to the point where
[1:11:31] i wanted to propose to my wife
[1:11:35] i got an engagement ring
[1:11:37] i was see i was i was pretty wise
[1:11:40] i thank god for giving me that wisdom
[1:11:44] so i can start paying it off
[1:11:48] so one day i got married
[1:11:50] i want i wanted to show my wife
[1:13:07] we have the greatest message that was
[1:13:09] ever sent
[1:13:12] getting ready
[1:13:14] you should pay for that wedding
[1:13:16] pay for her venue and you should pay for
[1:13:18] her dress
[1:13:20] of course we live in a mexican culture
[1:13:25] where a lot of people like to like to
[1:13:26] share and like the pain
[1:13:29] but i believe a young man should work
[1:13:35] amen amen
[1:13:37] you should be responsible
[1:13:40] amen and god is my witness and i'm
[1:13:42] telling you the truth
[1:13:45] when i came out here
[1:13:47] i already had six months saved up for
[1:13:49] rent yet
[1:13:51] before i moved out here to texas
[1:13:55] so when the pandemic hit
[1:13:57] the yucatan peninsula you see how
[1:14:08] the monthly rent paid
[1:14:29] i can tell you that it is impossible
[1:14:30] that it is possible
[1:14:33] when you put god first
[1:14:35] and when you seek god first
[1:14:38] amen god god will give you the sermon of
[1:14:40] what to do
[1:14:43] how to manage your economy
[1:14:46] how to manage this and how to save it
[1:14:51] i i i i didn't even know how it felt to
[1:14:54] eat in a restaurant
[1:15:08] you have the opportunity
[1:15:11] to start working
[1:15:14] amen amen
[1:15:16] amen i hope you still love me and i hope
[1:15:18] you love the lord
[1:15:21] proverbs 28 verse 13.
[1:15:27] he says he that covereth his sins
[1:15:29] shall not prosper
[1:15:33] but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them
[1:15:35] shall have mercy
[1:15:36] loss
[1:15:39] so what what does it say there it's very
[1:15:41] clear as day
[1:15:43] here the cover of the stream shall not
[1:15:45] prosper
[1:15:48] you can you have sins that are hidden
[1:15:57] but who confesseth and forsaketh them
[1:16:01] in it but he also says and forsakes them
[1:16:46] in my heart
[1:16:48] the lord will not hear me el senor
[1:16:52] so i hope there's no iniquity amongst us
[1:16:56] james 5 16 santiago cinco de sis confess
[1:17:00] your fault to one to another confidence
[1:17:04] and pray for one another
[1:17:07] that he may be healed
[1:17:11] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:17:13] righteous man availeth much
[1:17:56] there's people that are hurt
[1:17:59] there's people that are not they know
[1:18:00] that they're not perfect christians
[1:18:03] no they're not perfect
[1:18:05] but when they confess
[1:18:08] and they can come unto god
[1:18:10] it produces healing produces
[1:18:13] amen
[1:18:14] how many are ready to hear what the
[1:18:16] prophet has to say
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] now this she has given to to bring forth
[1:18:23] life
[1:18:38] that's right it has to come all the life
[1:18:40] has to come from god
[1:18:44] any life has to come from god
[1:18:48] it's perverted and that makes the sinful
[1:18:51] makes it sinful but life has to come
[1:18:52] from god
[1:18:57] he's the author of life
[1:19:00] i want to name three things here that
[1:19:02] she must not get away from her number
[1:19:04] three
[1:19:07] now i'm speaking keep the church in mind
[1:19:10] while i speak while i'm speaking of this
[1:19:12] natural woman
[1:19:20] the woman in the natural
[1:19:35] everyone is gossiping
[1:19:38] and everyone is dressed immorally
[1:19:41] everyone is wearing makeup
[1:19:43] there we know where the status is
[1:19:49] as paul is here in the seventh chapter
[1:19:50] of romans
[1:19:53] capitalism she has a sacred trust of
[1:19:56] virtue committed by to her by the lord a
[1:19:58] certain virtue
[1:20:03] nothing else holds it but a woman
[1:20:05] solo latina
[1:20:07] right that's committed to her bygone
[1:20:09] correct
[1:20:12] she must not defile that virtue
[1:20:15] and if she even does something wrong
[1:20:19] she must confess that to her husband
[1:20:23] before he takes her and make it right
[1:20:28] what are the three things that brother
[1:20:29] branham says
[1:20:59] nothing and she had the same as a church
[1:21:01] that she that was married to the law has
[1:21:03] to come also before christ before the
[1:21:04] second marriage
[1:21:12] she has to confess that if she doesn't
[1:21:13] and she lives with her husband for 10
[1:21:15] years and then confesses it
[1:21:23] she has a right to put her away and
[1:21:24] marry another woman
[1:21:29] that's the scripture fornication is
[1:21:31] unclean living
[1:21:33] fornication
[1:21:36] brother graham says that for the young
[1:21:37] ladies
[1:21:39] i believe same thing applies for the
[1:21:41] young man
[1:21:43] he shouldn't be going off doing things
[1:21:45] like that
[1:21:47] your brother branham says
[1:21:49] on um the message questions and answers
[1:21:54] jesus said in matthew 19 9 whosoever
[1:21:56] putteth away his wife and marries
[1:21:57] another jesus
[1:22:06] except it be for the cause of
[1:22:07] fornication commits adultery
[1:22:12] the difference between fornication
[1:22:13] adultery the word could be applied
[1:22:14] either way the difference
[1:22:19] but to make it clear what he's talking
[1:22:21] about
[1:22:24] a woman that's unmarried cannot commit
[1:22:26] adultery yes
[1:22:30] because she has no husband to commit
[1:22:32] adultery again
[1:22:36] it's
[1:22:40] she has to confess that to her husband
[1:22:42] before they're married if she did that
[1:22:48] and then her husband finds out later he
[1:22:50] has a writer put her away because she
[1:22:52] took a false vow
[1:23:00] for the bible said be it well or rich or
[1:23:03] ritual says be well known unto you if i
[1:23:06] have it in mind if any couples are
[1:23:07] joined to otherwise then god's word does
[1:23:10] allow their marriage is not lawful
[1:23:18] yolo tengo skrito
[1:23:24] i will require and i'll charge you both
[1:23:26] as you will surely answer the day of
[1:23:28] judgment when the secrets of hearts
[1:23:30] shall be disclosed
[1:23:37] if either of you know any impediment why
[1:23:39] you should not be lawful lawfully joined
[1:23:41] together do you now confess it
[1:23:43] is
[1:23:50] so fornication is what a girl when she
[1:23:52] lives unclean that's fornication because
[1:23:54] she has no husband
[1:23:56] foreign
[1:24:00] but when
[1:24:05] and then when she lives like that she
[1:24:06] commits adultery against her husband
[1:24:13] a woman come out long ago and she said
[1:24:15] i've confessed all of that
[1:24:20] she was nervous and had a breakdown and
[1:24:21] said i've confessed all of that to god
[1:24:26] i said you have to confess it to your
[1:24:28] husband it wasn't god that you committed
[1:24:29] adultery against it was your husband
[1:24:40] and if a man marries a woman and she has
[1:24:42] live unclean before she marries him
[1:24:48] and then she comes to him
[1:24:51] and if they've been married ever so long
[1:24:53] and then she comes to him and says
[1:25:00] i did run out with another man i never
[1:25:02] told you
[1:25:05] jesus said he has a right to put her
[1:25:06] away and marry another because they're
[1:25:08] not married in the beginning
[1:25:20] confessions can be a bit difficult
[1:25:24] because something that you don't want to
[1:25:25] say you don't want to admit
[1:25:29] but love covers multitude of sins
[1:25:35] and she loves you
[1:25:37] you accept her just the way she is
[1:25:40] and you accept him
[1:25:42] that's completely forgiving
[1:25:45] like they've never done it
[1:25:47] it's something it's something so amazing
[1:25:51] when the confession comes
[1:26:35] i'm gonna i'm i have a pretty lengthy
[1:26:37] quote just keep patience with me
[1:26:41] a little brother rams talking about a
[1:26:43] young sister here elemanta branos
[1:26:46] a little later later later from that
[1:26:48] there was a young girl
[1:26:51] i just want you to please pay close
[1:26:53] attention
[1:26:55] she she is perhaps perhaps sitting here
[1:26:57] this morning i don't see her but she's
[1:26:59] she comes in sparingly
[1:27:05] she is a member of the church of a
[1:27:06] church in new albany a very prominent
[1:27:08] church an outstanding church in new
[1:27:10] albany yes
[1:27:16] in new albany
[1:27:31] psychonaurosis
[1:27:35] and she can't and she won't even live
[1:27:37] leave the city or anywhere
[1:27:43] she starts screaming and crying and
[1:27:44] going on yeah
[1:27:47] notice we're here what brother ram says
[1:27:49] nothing a kilo kilometer i pray for her
[1:27:51] two or three times
[1:27:55] but something wouldn't let me challenge
[1:27:58] that demon
[1:28:24] she's a good friend of a
[1:28:25] good friend to a nurse that lives in the
[1:28:27] neighborhood there yes
[1:28:31] they come up there and she was getting
[1:28:33] worse
[1:28:35] and she'd been that way for about eight
[1:28:37] years
[1:28:40] and so she came up the other way and she
[1:28:41] said i told her i said sis the only
[1:28:43] thing i know that there is a cause there
[1:28:46] somewhere
[1:28:48] entonces
[1:29:06] and i said my pastor sent me up here and
[1:29:09] said
[1:29:11] go see brother billy and see what he
[1:29:13] says
[1:29:15] well i said well i don't know i don't
[1:29:16] know says i said i'm i'm i'm just like
[1:29:18] your pastor
[1:29:22] estoy
[1:29:26] have you confessed all of your sins
[1:29:31] she says everything
[1:29:34] sunday school teacher has a great class
[1:29:36] in doing good work but she but just that
[1:29:39] but just that hung over her el maestras
[1:29:46] she was a sunday school teacher
[1:30:11] when people come we just stopped
[1:30:13] everything
[1:30:15] i got her in the room i sat down and i
[1:30:17] started talking about giant genealogies
[1:30:20] and everything and everything about the
[1:30:22] beginning
[1:30:28] the origin of time and everything and
[1:30:30] watching her
[1:30:33] and it was the same morning god is
[1:30:35] always there at the crucial moment
[1:30:40] after a while i looked out and there
[1:30:42] come a vision moving up
[1:30:52] i said your conditions has something to
[1:30:54] do with an automobile because
[1:30:58] he says no i never i never was in a
[1:31:00] wreck yes
[1:31:28] went ahead and began to bring it down
[1:31:33] i said these the things that you've done
[1:31:35] the immoral things
[1:31:40] you told them about some of it
[1:32:23] you're going to have an operation not
[1:32:24] too long ago
[1:32:28] for your tonsils
[1:32:32] and you was afraid to take the
[1:32:34] anesthetic
[1:32:36] anaesthesia afraid you could tell that
[1:32:38] underneath
[1:32:40] what does brother ram say there can you
[1:32:41] sell them this young lady had a surgery
[1:32:44] with her tonsils
[1:32:47] and she was scared to take that
[1:32:49] anesthetic to anesthetic
[1:32:52] anesthesia because she she feels like
[1:32:53] she'll start just confessing everything
[1:32:58] they should start telling the truth
[1:33:01] should she rather she rather postpone
[1:33:03] the surgery
[1:33:05] so she doesn't tell the secret out but
[1:33:08] but god's prophet told her her cause of
[1:33:11] her problem
[1:33:15] did you have a mental condition
[1:33:17] start screaming and start crying
