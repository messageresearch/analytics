sign that this was the right time and when the sisters saying there's power in prayer i know this was my sign because my testimony is about power and prayer [Music] and everyone was so happy for us because we told them on mother's day and at 12 weeks i went to get my first ultrasound yeah and they told me i was healthy the baby was looking good everything was perfect but at 14 weeks i ended up getting a sharp pain on my back so i went to the emergency room just to make sure everything was okay with me or the baby and they told me i was fine nothing was wrong i just had an infection so they gave me pills and that was it the following week at 15 weeks i had another sharp pain and i went again to the hospital and they told me again nothing was wrong and that the baby was fine healthy as well and the following week i'm not even kidding it happen every week they're at 16 weeks i went again but this time it was because i couldn't even stand up i was in so much pain and when the doctor checked did an ultrasound he told me my baby he couldn't find my baby at all and that was my worst fear but they told me he was in position to come out already in the position and he was only 16 weeks yeah so i don't know what they did but it was really painful and they sent me on my way [Music] i the following week i had another sharp pain but it was on my back and i was on my way to my mother-in-law's house and i remember texting sister brenda to pray for me and she did and on my way home from sister from my mother-in-law i'm sorry i had another pain yeah but it was 10 times worse and i remember the song this blood came out on the spit on the radio and i remember i just started crying because i remember something brother branham said that you have to claim your healing in order to be healed and i remember telling my husband let's pray because i know this is he wanted to take me to the hospital but i said no hospital i knew this was satan's work he was getting to me through my baby and i remember we started praying and i remember saying in the name of the lord jesus christ i claim my healing and say that you can't do anything about it and when i got out of the car the pain went away two weeks passed and i had no pain i knew this wasn't science this was satan and then sister brenda called me and told me she i believe she had to go to the hospital because of the same pain a brianna and i remember telling her this was satan was really mad for helping me and praying for me but my testimony is there is power and prayer if you're going through anything testimonials

can these bones live and i answered lord god made the lord blessed you may take your seats once again it's really nice to be here in the house of the lord knowing that in one of these days saviono it's all going to be worth it one of these days if you have someone against your brother let's go ahead and fix it take i i told my interpreter maybe a month ago he asked me if i was going to speak several messages about this i told him i'm really going to try not to i hope that you forgive me we're going to speak on the third message the invisible union of the bride of christ and as a subtitle dry bones discovery matrimonial we find the courtship encounters and the agreement and then the marriage that shall settle it for all the time now that's the same thing it is with christ and the church the same thing with christ in the church it's a courtship esco god calling our hearts the marriage ceremony ceremony and the bride the bride takes the bridegroom's name says there it is that excuse me what makes the bride loki hasselanovia it's three things it is our surrender the marriage ceremony the ceremony and then the bride takes the bridegroom's name that's the marriage union this is we surrender we have to surrender we can't be here trying to fight the lord and make him surrender to us and then there's a marriage ceremony then the bride takes the bridegroom's name illogolanovia el nombre del novios one quick story here to insert uh history billy paul said i've never seen my dad made a mistake they say billy paul visa and i thought that one day i thought i saw him make a mistake and my dad said billy if you ever see your dad make a mistake discard everything i said descartes and through the gifts of the sermon brother branham says you're so and so so-and-so let's just say her name was uh betsy uh betsy ruth digamos queso nombre es betsy roos or betsy jones rather or betsy jones and brother answers you're betty jones betsy jones the lady said no sir no senor i'm betsy johnson you're sorry betsy johnson my sister brother and says excuse me this is a monogram disco you're not betsy uh uh jones this annoyer is betsy jones no he said no i'm betsy johnson so you saw betsy johnson and bob ram billy paul said i thought my dad made a mistake and then brother bram says okay well let's pray then one of these once the prayer was over yeah the lady said they said that was my name before i got divorced now my maiden name johnson is betsy johnson when i was married condominium it was betsy jones and i'm betsy jones i don't have that name anymore brother brown says dear sister they said bermana god doesn't know you as betsy johnson you might be divorced by the maricopa county maricopa betsy johnson doesn't exist betsy johnson betsy jones exists it's betsy jones can i exist do you see what makes the bride it's our surrender is from the east and the west and the north and the south occidental del norte also there is a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for but the rapture amen amen that's why she's uniting herself because there's a rapture we understand according to first thessalonians uh it takes three things to take brother what do you mean it already happened i i believe we don't have a lot of uh new uh novites here the rapture is already going on and there's a lot of people that don't know that it's already going on because in the scripture of revelation 16 apocalypses verse 15 it says behold and that's the same thing with the lord jesus christ he comes as a thief the shout is the message the rapture is already happening there's a lot of people here that are uh on the earth that they don't even know about the message they don't know about malachi 4. they don't know that the rapture is is happening as we speak because he's coming as a thief and i like what the what the brother was singing here here in revelations the 15th verse akin apocalypse is as blessed as he says that watcheth and keepeth his garments and that's what the brother was singing yes watch your garments you say uh keep your garments that's what we should be doing taking care of them make sure we don't have a stain on them make sure we don't have a wrinkle on them because a lot of times when we're out there eating we once we leave the church and we have a white shirt we're eating garments the rapture is already happening some people don't know it and it's the same thing when the voice of the archangel happens but that's why we should be watching taking care of our garments we should be watching the signs of the time i'm going to say that again what are we waiting for esperamos the the seventh excuse me the sixth vision already happened what happens after that there is not another thing that's going to happen destruction of united to use the phrase uniting to bring back the faith that was one the once delivered to the saints there's the uniting of the word and to the faith that was once delivered to the saints santos but iran says bringing back disillusion now so there has there had to be a disunity at some point brother brahms says he was talking about when the first church was set in order it was inaugurated of the day of pentecost dead and was living among them just the same as he was before he ever died see they wasn't contending for some historical affair historical they were contending for a living christ a resurrected one who was in their midst el cual esta see that's what brother branham is talking about branham bringing us back to the first church regresandonos that was inaugurated the day of pentecost says this uniting again bringing us back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints that it started in the day of pentecost now how do we get back to the original pentecostal faith says malachi 4. restore back the original pentecost of faith back to the people with the same pentecostal message the same pentecostal signs the same everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck saw bring back the faith of the children back to the fathers and say luke 1 17 and san lucas he said he should go before him in the spirit of the power of elias and to turn the hearts of the father to the children is to return the faith of the fathers the children back to the fathers see this this this elijah this prophet is the prophet this prophet is no joke he's he's somebody else he's or he's a real man of god he's very calm but he's very strong if you notice in second kings i like i like reading the scriptures we find that the successor of elijah el succesor de elias was elisha for eliseo and he kept following elijah he said and he said what do you want she's like me he says i'm just trying to follow you no mosquito i'm going to keep following you and there you came elijah to the jordan river he knew that elijah was going to leave the scene el salvia and then he said what do you want i want a double portion of your spirit you asked for really great things very great things where is the god of elijah where the water was poisoned or it was there was something wrong with the water they put salt and finally we find him in a we find him in a predicament in a dilemma but rather he's not in a predicament we find those who are man you're challenging god inside the mask i'm going to teach that preacher a piece of my mind that's not the right attitude to correct better be careful god's word shall never we find that syria is a war against israel and controversy syria and this king was warring against israel israel and then we find that them it says the man of god hilo and controversy because these syrians are going to come and attack you and he did what exactly what elijah said and they were safe we find out that now that the heart of the king of syria say it again the heart of the king of syria syria was troubled and he said show me who is the king of israel israel and one one servant told this king of syria you king of israel the word that he speaks in his bed chambers so you can't hide anything from the prophet anything from him nope and the king of syria says well go get him go get him then i want him they finally go and we find elisha in the in the town of dothan if you horses and chariots and a great army against elijah [Music] saw all this great army that was coming to attack him carlos and he said master maestro what shall we do i can imagine elijah just probably just taking scratching his eye imagine the question begin and the lord open his eyes he's protecting the word of god he's not obligated to any man he's only obligated to his word you do his words obligated to fulfill the promises do that but give me a testimony a testimonial where you can go to a sister that you stopped talking to putin that hit a little bit didn't it but we can't even say hello to those who don't even talk to us the word is bringing us together [Music] that god did sent forth his holy spirit to heal us nothing but the truth but what is it what is it good to have all this healing bro we can't be united as a bride is no it's 50. think about that one bride unannovia going to the center yen centro give me a testimony testimonial will you say brother no need i restored my relationship with my brother i restored the relationship with my sister that's what the prophet elijah came in hallelujah i'm like elijah this morning i'm like elisha this morning lord may you open their eyes malachi 4 will restore all things and bring us back to that same fate to bring us back not to the pentecostal church but back to the original pentecost of faith pentecost and the day of pentecost not to bring us back to the pentecostal church back to the original pentecost of faith the seed is not air with the shock noise is it looks like the seed but if you go to google google look at google shock shock is like a you ever seen um la cascara where you just kind of hold the seat inside it's like a pecan pecan you ever seen those pecans los picanos yo you got the you don't eat the you don't eat the shell us you crack it represents they just kept the shells thinking that was the seed the seed was rejected says the shot represents pentecost this is she was overshadowed by the holy ghost she was chosen after many women and then she had jesus inside of her elo she had the literal jesus inside of her al jesus she protected him he embraced she embraced him and then jesus came out of her yeah jesus now jesus was no longer in here but now jesus was with her and there we find where now mary and joseph lost jesus see where you left them and she claimed that she was the mother of jesus jesus said she she she said you and your father they said to padre your father and i have been looking for you but says wait a minute it is claiming that the birth wasn't supernatural joseph was her father father jesus she denied the supernatural birth they were all scattered in luther's group not luther himself not luther not wesley niluteroni wesley not these great founders so we're going to go back to the original faith of the father now you see but in the last days we see things happening now that has never happened before now remember that's that's right at the seven trumpets in the days of the message of the seventh angel to bring us back to the word it takes the prophet around them um that was the ark of the lord so what ezekiel saw on earth the apostle john saw already stationed in heaven john saw it in heaven ezekiel saw another vision where he was taken by the spirit and now we see him in a valley was full of dry bones but the scripture said it was they were very very dry usually bones um usually when we eat we usually throw the bone away can these the scripture said it was a big rattling a loud rattling of bones that is connecting the bones together bringing the body together so when i started hearing brother tiny speaking about arthritis is he said they coming together this is the tending's connecting the bones they were not just a skeleton put together but now they had flesh they had skin then that makes them a living god told where now adam and eve says or adam all his bones not one of them is broken john 19 36 were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken the bone in hebrew means body significa life vida substance substantial self-same el mismo so when adam saw eve he said on my bone let me whistle he says i am you say yo and you are me shall be broken it takes a prophet to prophesy to bring us back to the original faith the prophet prophesied prophet he brought life back to the bone el de volvo you become these great hidden mysteries of god being revealed in controversy to and to speak am i actually uniting myself with the words if the musicians can come forth see we see the bride is uniting with the word right now estonian [Music] when the when you get married you get married to christ right now concussions
