[1:01:48] you know so thank God that we can have a
[1:01:51] place to come to those Graces and get
[1:01:54] out of the heat for a few days
[1:01:57] but that's not number one
[1:01:59] number one is to come in Fellowship
[1:02:04] not to hear me this evening
[1:02:06] pray we hear from the Throne of God
[1:02:10] Amen I'm gonna ask you to stand for the
[1:02:12] reading of the words
[1:02:15] and we want to get into this awesome
[1:02:18] awesome subject
[1:02:21] you know when we when we hear about
[1:02:23] prayer
[1:02:27] that it changes things
[1:02:29] I said Amen to that
[1:02:32] brother when brother Octavio called me
[1:02:35] and said this is the theme of our
[1:02:36] meetings
[1:02:40] I'm the first to be a witness that is
[1:02:44] changes things
[1:02:47] amen Amanda go into our scriptures
[1:02:50] we're going to read James 5 16. Santiago
[1:02:54] Cinco this is the scripture of our of
[1:02:58] our uh of our meetings this this weekend
[1:03:03] and it says confess your faults one to
[1:03:06] another
[1:03:07] and pray one for another that ye may be
[1:03:11] healed
[1:03:19] you know this this scripture is
[1:03:22] probably one of the most misquoted
[1:03:26] scriptures and that we have in the Bible
[1:03:30] because many times when you hear the
[1:03:32] scripture
[1:03:34] and some somebody's saying that really
[1:03:36] fast
[1:03:37] it says the pray and they would say the
[1:03:40] prayer of a righteous man Avail as much
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] amen amen but that's not what the
[1:03:49] scripture says
[1:03:51] we say that the prayer of a righteous
[1:03:53] man availeth
[1:03:56] mucho that's not what the scripture says
[1:03:58] it says the
[1:04:01] effectual
[1:04:07] ferventification
[1:04:09] of a righteous man
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:15] may the Lord has blessings to the
[1:04:17] reading of the word
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:19] amen amen
[1:04:21] as I was um
[1:04:24] as I was uh meditating on this
[1:04:28] I started reading the the Book of James
[1:04:34] um it's kind of it's it's kind of one of
[1:04:36] those books
[1:04:39] um
[1:04:40] sometimes I
[1:04:42] I'm Gonna Keep It Personal that that I
[1:04:45] personally maybe Overlook sometimes
[1:04:49] but as as I was reading the the Book of
[1:04:53] James
[1:04:55] there was there was one word that really
[1:04:57] that really caught my attention
[1:05:02] and it um
[1:05:06] and if we go back into James
[1:05:12] um we're going to start with uh five
[1:05:14] seven
[1:05:17] and it reads like this
[1:05:21] be patient
[1:05:23] therefore brethren
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:44] take my brethren the prophets who have
[1:05:46] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[1:05:49] example of suffering Affliction and of
[1:06:05] we count them happy which endure ye have
[1:06:10] heard of the patience of Job and have
[1:06:13] seen the end of the Lord that the Lord
[1:06:15] is very pitiful and of tender Mercy is
[1:06:37] so as as I was thinking of prayer
[1:06:41] and I was meditating on the word prayer
[1:06:46] I I
[1:06:48] uh my mind would take me back doesn't
[1:06:51] mean
[1:06:53] too many times
[1:06:55] as I was a child
[1:06:58] I would I would get up in the middle of
[1:07:00] the night
[1:07:02] and I would see my My Mother by her
[1:07:06] bedside
[1:07:08] and maybe two three o'clock in the
[1:07:11] morning
[1:07:12] and I would see her praying Orlando
[1:07:17] so many nights were like that
[1:07:21] countless countless nights
[1:07:25] I saw the prayer
[1:07:29] of a righteous
[1:07:34] but not only did I see or hear the
[1:07:38] prayers of this lady
[1:07:42] but I saw the results
[1:07:48] so many times when we when we when we
[1:07:51] pray much we
[1:07:55] we pray to God in a way
[1:07:59] that if God answers our prayers
[1:08:04] God is on a level that is so high
[1:08:09] when God doesn't seem to answer our
[1:08:12] prayers
[1:08:14] it seems that God has dropped
[1:08:18] a few levels
[1:08:22] anybody experience that is
[1:08:26] we we take a look at prayer
[1:08:30] and we see the effects of it
[1:08:35] but when we don't see those effects of
[1:08:39] the prayer
[1:08:41] we wonder why we question God questions
[1:08:46] why God
[1:08:47] why did you take my family member
[1:08:51] for years as I was as I was a teenager
[1:08:57] growing up
[1:08:59] I asked God a question every single day
[1:09:03] I was 14 years old when the Lord took my
[1:09:06] mother and
[1:09:09] I said Lord
[1:09:12] why porque I have prayed you know I saw
[1:09:17] many Great Men of God
[1:09:20] that would come to our home there in
[1:09:22] Silver City even he understood that in
[1:09:24] Silver City and I would see them pray
[1:09:26] for my so
[1:10:49] and I said I know Lord
[1:10:51] this is foreign
[1:11:56] las cosas
[1:12:00] the way that we look at prayer
[1:12:04] is not the way that it should be
[1:12:08] when we ask God
[1:12:10] for something in our lives
[1:12:14] there is a chance
[1:12:18] there is a good chance
[1:12:22] that it's not gonna happen in your life
[1:12:25] but that doesn't mean
[1:12:28] that God can still do it
[1:12:34] he is the same
[1:12:37] no matter
[1:12:38] if he answers your prayers
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ
[1:12:54] but why is he so much greater to us
[1:12:58] when our prayers are answered
[1:13:03] when I found out
[1:13:07] um
[1:13:11] it's a little secret
[1:13:14] that I discovered
[1:13:17] I was maybe my early twenties
[1:13:21] for about 10 years of asking why Lord
[1:13:27] I felt like I was the only person in the
[1:13:30] world that ever lost a mother
[1:13:34] you know so many times we go through
[1:13:37] life
[1:13:38] we just complain yes
[1:13:43] I also say we because there's there's a
[1:13:46] lot of people here that don't complain
[1:13:48] for that
[1:13:51] I went through so so many years of my
[1:13:54] life complaining
[1:13:56] why aren't you doing this Lord
[1:13:59] look at my father how many Radiance
[1:14:02] so many times we have a mindset
[1:14:07] that we are entitled for the Lord to
[1:14:11] answer okay
[1:14:15] we are entitled
[1:14:18] that is supposed to do it because of
[1:14:20] what of who we are
[1:14:24] what we've done
[1:14:28] oh Lord I went to the I went to the
[1:14:31] meeting
[1:14:32] you know I sacrificed
[1:14:35] I went over there you know I I helped an
[1:14:39] old lady across the street
[1:14:42] I fed those
[1:14:56] because of the works that we see
[1:15:00] ourselves doing
[1:15:03] um
[1:15:06] man I'm preaching to myself this evening
[1:15:10] a lot of good people here
[1:15:13] which there is every one of you everyone
[1:15:16] is of you is good people but
[1:15:23] when I when I discovered something
[1:15:27] the Lord the Lord really really dealt
[1:15:31] with me in this is
[1:15:33] going to the Book of Daniel
[1:15:39] sometimes when you have so many notes
[1:15:41] written and you think everything's all
[1:15:43] good you always
[1:15:47] takes you in the opposite directions
[1:15:53] okay
[1:15:54] now everyone knows this this uh this
[1:15:58] scripture here
[1:15:59] in this story here
[1:16:02] now if you be ready that at what time
[1:16:06] you hear that's 3 15 I'm sorry
[1:16:08] now if you be ready that at what time
[1:16:11] you hear the sound of the Cornet flute
[1:16:14] harp Sacrament Sultry and dulcimer and
[1:16:17] all kinds of music ye Fall Down and
[1:16:19] Worship the image which I have made well
[1:16:22] but if you worship not ye shall be cast
[1:16:25] the same hour into the midst of a
[1:16:27] burning fiery furnace and who is that
[1:16:30] God that shall deliver you out of my
[1:16:32] hands amen is
[1:16:59] they won
[1:17:01] foreign
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:34] from the burning fiery furnace and he
[1:17:37] will deliver us out of thine handle King
[1:17:39] yes
[1:17:49] this scripture here
[1:17:51] blew my mind
[1:17:55] the scripture changed the way I saw
[1:17:59] and viewed prayer
[1:18:06] but if not see no
[1:18:13] these Hebrew children had Faith
[1:18:17] they prayed Adam they knew what they
[1:18:21] were doing
[1:18:22] was going against the grain
[1:18:26] they were going against an entire Empire
[1:18:31] but as they approached the king
[1:18:36] they said oh King
[1:18:38] we understand
[1:18:40] we know the consequences
[1:18:43] we're prayed up
[1:18:45] and we know
[1:18:47] that when we pray
[1:18:49] for God to deliver us
[1:18:52] that we know that he will
[1:18:56] but even if he doesn't how old
[1:19:00] they looked at prayer
[1:19:03] but they looked at prayer in an angle
[1:19:06] that we fail to look at
[1:19:10] so with God doesn't come on the scene
[1:19:15] well God doesn't love me
[1:19:18] I guess there's something wrong
[1:19:21] but if we have
[1:19:23] the change of a mentality
[1:19:27] that we can say Lord
[1:19:29] I know you're a Healer
[1:19:32] I know you're a savior
[1:19:35] I know you're a provider
[1:19:38] I know that you are everything
[1:19:41] but even if you don't see no I will
[1:19:46] serve you
[1:19:47] when I'm healthy I will serve you when
[1:19:52] I'm sick okay I will serve you when I'm
[1:19:55] rich
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:00] because my situation
[1:20:03] is it gonna change
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:23] that God can do things
[1:20:26] he can do things in a way
[1:20:28] where he's
[1:20:31] speaking
[1:20:33] but he can also do things in a way
[1:20:36] where he's silence you
[1:20:41] it's up to us
[1:20:46] our situation
[1:20:48] in a different way
[1:20:51] how many wanna view our situation
[1:20:55] in a different way
[1:21:01] you know patience is something
[1:21:07] patience is is an amazing thing
[1:21:11] patience is something
[1:21:14] that is built
[1:21:18] that is
[1:21:19] that we're it's not given to us yes
[1:21:23] but it's something I believe that we
[1:21:25] that we earn
[1:21:28] through life it's
[1:21:32] molds our character is
[1:21:36] it helps us to to see things
[1:21:40] you know when I was young when I was a
[1:21:44] kid

[1:28:36] kind of working on me
[1:28:38] and I could see the spiritual aspect of
[1:28:41] it

[1:29:59] but the Lord says
[1:30:05] it's not your time yet
[1:30:10] that teaches us
[1:30:13] patience
[1:30:15] that teaches us
[1:30:17] how to look at things differently
[1:30:23] first Peter 3 12.
[1:30:27] says this
[1:30:29] this Esto
[1:30:37] for the eyes
[1:30:38] of the Lord
[1:30:40] are over the righteous amen
[1:30:47] and his ears are open unto their prayers

[1:31:05] you can get some righteous people man
[1:31:12] and his ears are open unto their prayers
[1:31:17] but the face of the Lord is against them
[1:31:20] that do evil
[1:31:21] is
[1:31:24] and who is he that will harm you
[1:31:30] if he be followers of that which is good
[1:31:35] but and if

[1:35:26] there's no such thing as a bad time in
[1:35:29] God
[1:35:32] I don't know if anybody's ever thought
[1:35:34] about that
[1:35:36] since I've been since I've been going to
[1:35:38] church I've been good times and there's
[1:35:39] been bad times
[1:35:44] there's been tough times
[1:35:46] but there's not been any bad times
[1:35:49] I don't care what what you've been going
[1:35:51] on
[1:35:53] when you're in the hands of God it's
[1:35:56] going to be difficult
[1:36:11] we think so crazy
[1:36:14] I got a word from the Lord the other day
[1:36:19] you know what it said location said
[1:36:21] William William
[1:36:36] and I'm like wow he up and said wow
[1:36:41] that's something that's got to change
[1:36:44] yeah my mentality the way that I look at
[1:36:49] this
[1:36:50] has to change
[1:36:59] it's a cheerful
[1:37:02] endurance
[1:37:04] ISO
[1:37:11] the King James version
[1:37:15] Santiago as we read on
[1:37:18] in uh in James 5 16.
[1:37:23] this is as it talks about the word
[1:37:27] available
[1:37:34] it says it produces
[1:37:38] an advantage
[1:37:44] wow man okay
[1:37:46] how many likes you have an advantage
[1:37:48] so if I if I played brother uh brother
[1:37:52] Abe does he okay in basketball
[1:37:58] raise your hands
[1:38:00] okay if I played brother Abe in
[1:38:02] basketball
[1:38:05] the advantage that he has
[1:38:10] Tom is the only Advantage she has
[1:38:17] now according to brother a being equal I
[1:38:19] got into Camp either because he was
[1:38:22] smoking everybody okay
[1:38:25] but when he's playing his Advantage is
[1:38:31] that he has height is there's a common
[1:38:34] saying that says in sports
[1:38:37] you can teach a lot of things
[1:38:40] you can't teach height
[1:38:44] why there's not much Mexicans in the NBA
[1:38:49] they can't teach us
[1:38:58] available
[1:39:01] produces an advantage
[1:39:05] now brother Jim taught me this a few
[1:39:07] years ago yesterday
[1:39:10] when you add an eth to the word
[1:39:16] in the Old English
[1:39:19] it means
[1:39:21] that it's a
[1:39:23] continuation significance
[1:39:26] all right amen so whenever you see eth
[1:39:30] at the end of the word
[1:39:34] that's why we love the King James
[1:39:36] version
[1:39:38] there's no other version that we that
[1:39:41] you can you can read it but that's not
[1:39:44] what we go by the is
[1:39:47] if you didn't if you didn't know that
[1:39:49] that's what the prophet told us
[1:39:56] it is a
[1:39:59] continuation
[1:40:01] so when we see the word available
[1:40:06] that means
[1:40:14] this is
[1:40:18] the effectual fervent prayer of a right
[1:40:21] of a righteous man a veileth mucho
[1:40:31] um
[1:40:32] what that means is that
[1:40:36] it it continually
[1:40:41] produces an advantage
[1:40:45] it's not a one-time thing
[1:40:51] that as we continue to pray foreign
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:41:13] there's so many things in our lives
[1:41:17] that we just
[1:41:34] you know
[1:41:37] men I gotta get some water real quick
[1:41:40] getting a little dry it's cool air we're
[1:41:43] not used to it
[1:41:52] continues
[1:41:57] so many times muchas versus now brother
[1:42:00] brothers said I got an hour and a half
[1:42:05] I have never ever preached for more than
[1:42:10] an hour
[1:42:13] so don't worry we're gonna we're gonna
[1:42:15] stay good
[1:42:21] and the reason I tell you that is
[1:42:24] that story is just coming to my mind all
[1:42:27] the time
[1:42:29] and the reason I tell you that is
[1:42:31] like the second time that I had preached
[1:42:34] is
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:59] here I am
[1:43:18] good service huh
[1:43:24] so how much time did I give you
[1:43:41] the first 30 minutes
[1:43:45] that was God
[1:43:49] thank you
[1:43:53] the next 10 minutes
[1:43:55] that was you yes too
[1:43:58] he said don't ever be you
[1:44:03] my dad man me papa
[1:44:06] I don't care who you were
[1:44:08] when you were out of line
[1:44:11] you're going to get it
[1:44:14] next time next time you're getting money
[1:44:18] they're not going to be next
[1:44:21] ever since then it is
[1:44:23] man the pastor says I got 40 minutes
[1:44:27] but here we go
[1:44:31] oh my goodness
[1:44:33] when we approach God
[1:44:36] you know
[1:44:38] brother Branham says remember him these
[1:44:40] things I'm gonna read it I'm going to
[1:44:41] read a quote from him
[1:44:44] and when we and when we can display the
[1:44:47] token of the Holy Spirit
[1:44:52] shows that we have been accepted in
[1:44:55] Christ
[1:44:57] that is our token yes
[1:45:00] that all that we have need of
[1:45:04] is already purchased by him
[1:45:08] are identified with our Tokens
[1:45:12] The Token must be ready
[1:45:16] the blood Covenant
[1:45:20] Covenant blood is not recognized without
[1:45:23] the token
[1:45:26] the word assures us of the promise
[1:45:30] the token is the sign the purchase has
[1:45:34] been made for us
[1:45:40] but you know why our prayer doesn't work
[1:45:44] CNN because it takes full obedience
[1:45:51] man
[1:45:52] takes patience yeah
[1:45:55] takes full obedience
[1:46:01] so many times we worry about what the
[1:46:03] other person is is doing
[1:46:07] and we we measure ourselves
[1:46:11] against everybody else
[1:46:15] look at me look at me
[1:46:18] I'm behind the pulpit yes
[1:46:20] man I see a lot of Sinners
[1:46:25] the ministers sometimes
[1:46:28] hold on hold on hold on
[1:46:32] this Minister sometimes is out of line
[1:46:34] is
[1:46:39] when we have Disobedience
[1:46:44] that's when
[1:46:47] our prayers
[1:46:49] do not avail
[1:46:52] at all they said
[1:46:56] they have
[1:46:57] no power
[1:46:59] what an amazing thing it is to be
[1:47:02] obedient
[1:47:06] well how many how how many are fully
[1:47:08] obedient
[1:47:10] how many how many how many young people
[1:47:13] are just
[1:47:14] just say yes yes sir yes Mom yes yes
[1:47:20] and you do that all the time not just
[1:47:24] when say okay okay son if you do this
[1:47:25] we're gonna go to Disneyland
[1:47:31] Lassen
[1:47:34] sometimes we we look at obedience
[1:47:37] and think that on the other side there's
[1:47:39] a there's a rewards
[1:47:43] that's why we're obedient
[1:47:46] but the moment that we get
[1:47:48] the moment that we get uh
[1:47:51] that there that there's nothing behind
[1:47:53] that okay
[1:47:55] I don't want to do it
[1:47:59] but full obedience
[1:48:03] now we talked about being entitled right
[1:48:13] this is my last name is Perez
[1:48:17] so I'm entitled so it says
[1:48:20] obedience to
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:25] this this is awesome
[1:48:27] it's not to the word of God
[1:48:33] everybody
[1:48:33] that's what that was looking down no
[1:48:37] full obedience to the word of God that's
[1:48:39] not what it is
[1:48:42] it's full obedience
[1:48:45] to the full
[1:48:49] word of God
[1:48:51] there's there's times that even if you
[1:48:55] take out one word
[1:48:57] it just sets everything off yeah
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:37] but what God said about it
[1:49:46] all right everybody understood that
[1:49:48] right
[1:49:49] full obedience
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:53] it's a lot more than prayer than you
[1:49:56] know that that that's involved in prayer
[1:49:58] right it's mask you know that prayer
[1:50:00] changes things
[1:50:03] but first
[1:50:05] you better go to God
[1:50:07] in patience yeah
[1:50:13] yeah
[1:50:15] because without that so
[1:50:19] you're just going to be mumbling words
[1:50:25] Prayer Changes Things
[1:50:27] but
[1:50:31] the way that we look at it prayer
[1:50:36] that has to change
[1:50:38] the way that we look at our brother and
[1:50:41] sisters
[1:50:43] you know what I learned a valuable
[1:50:46] lesson
[1:50:48] how many how many are uh cuantos son how
[1:50:52] many are high and mighty fuertes
[1:50:57] okay well you know that's exactly what I
[1:51:00] thought hey it's excited to look up and
[1:51:01] say everyone is has humility in here
[1:51:06] I'm gonna give you an experience of
[1:51:08] myself
[1:51:09] because brother William welcome to
[1:51:12] William felt high and mighty says
[1:51:16] I'm going to ask you another question
[1:51:18] okay
[1:51:22] if you see usted divided the church
[1:51:26] and you would put in different sections
[1:51:30] you would say okay all those that were
[1:51:32] alcoholics
[1:51:34] go to this section
[1:51:38] that's
[1:51:40] do you have a group of people going
[1:51:42] all those that did drugs go to another
[1:51:45] section
[1:51:46] no one has any problems since I did
[1:51:49] drugs
[1:51:51] there's those people go to the sections
[1:51:55] okay all those that that smoked they
[1:51:59] will go to another section
[1:52:01] all right we got a section now all those

[1:55:38] I'm not worried about my brother or
[1:55:40] sister
[1:55:44] is messed up
[1:55:48] and then he says you know why your
[1:55:51] prayers aren't answered
[1:55:56] because you're disobediente
[1:56:04] you know why things in your life are the
[1:56:06] way they are
[1:56:10] because of disobedience
[1:56:15] but brother and sister I can tell you
[1:56:17] this this evening
[1:56:20] it's a prayer
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:24] the effectual
[1:56:28] fervent prayer
[1:56:32] of a righteous
[1:56:36] Mane mucho
[1:56:42] it worksione
[1:56:48] but the way that you see it
[1:56:51] the way that God does it is
[1:56:55] you're the way that you see it has to
[1:56:57] change
[1:56:59] we can't go on
[1:57:01] viewing our lives
[1:57:07] that is just I'm gonna just live my my
[1:57:10] life the way that it is
[1:57:12] and anyways the grace of God just covers
[1:57:15] me
[1:57:16] the grace of God does not work like that
[1:57:19] no like when I say is yes see it it
[1:57:23] brings you out through through a lot of
[1:57:25] things
[1:57:26] what's amazing about the grace of God
[1:57:30] it makes you examine
[1:57:32] your life
[1:57:36] I don't ever want to be out of your
[1:57:39] grace
[1:57:40] I don't ever want to be out of your will
[1:57:45] I'm gonna ask you to stand this evening
[1:57:49] we can say much more much
[1:58:03] when James 5 16 is talking about confess
[1:58:06] your faults one to another uh
[1:58:14] and pray for one another he said
[1:58:21] brother Branham gives us
[1:58:23] gives us this quote
[1:58:27] and I want to ask you as I'm reading it
[1:58:31] for you to follow what brother Branham
[1:58:34] is is saying
[1:58:37] this is not what I'm saying no look at
[1:58:39] your ego but this is what
[1:58:43] with the prophet of of God and of this
[1:58:46] age has showed us to do
[1:58:51] so many times when we when we need
[1:58:53] prayer
[1:58:55] we're asking Lord
[1:58:57] help me help me help me I use
[1:59:03] but many times in our dire situation in
[1:59:08] need
[1:59:12] very rarelys
[1:59:15] in our time of
[1:59:18] despairie
[1:59:20] very rarely do what you're saying
[1:59:26] give brother without his strength
[1:59:32] give sister Elsa strength
[1:59:39] give my brother Jim's strength
[1:59:42] fuers be with my sister Virginia
[1:59:47] so many times we go to God with an
[1:59:49] attitude this is
[2:00:01] now while you're praying this is
[2:00:07] if you're sick
[2:00:09] why don't you put your hand over on
[2:00:12] somebody
[2:00:17] and pray for them
[2:00:20] can you do that this evening
[2:00:24] can you get your neighbor
[2:00:27] why don't you put your hand over on
[2:00:29] somebody foreign
[2:00:44] put your hand over on one another now
[2:00:47] now you've confessed that he was now
[2:00:52] you've confessed that you was wanting
[2:00:54] the holy the holy ghost
[2:00:57] that you wanted salvation
[2:01:00] now if you want healing
[2:01:03] put your hands on one another
[2:01:06] Jesus said these signs shall shall
[2:01:09] follow them that belief Jesus
[2:01:11] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[2:01:14] shall recover
[2:01:17] won't you put your hands on one another
[2:01:20] if you're a Believer
[2:01:25] heal this woman
[2:01:29] heal this man
[2:01:31] they are praying for me
[2:01:34] Lord I want them to pray for me
[2:01:38] so I put my hands up
[2:01:52] confessing your faults one to the other
[2:01:56] and pray one for the uh
[2:02:00] that ye might be healed
[2:02:03] in Jesus name Jesus
[2:02:07] amen amen
[2:02:10] isn't that awesome this is awesome
[2:02:13] and we look at prayer
[2:02:16] it changes things
[2:02:23] I believe that
[2:02:25] I believe that it changes
[2:02:29] but let it started
[2:02:32] senon
[2:02:34] please bless my brother Judah benice
[2:02:36] William take care of his family is
[2:02:39] finances

[2:03:01] when you feel that prayer
[2:03:04] for my brother
[2:03:06] William there's somebody there could be
[2:03:09] there could be brother Amy
[2:03:12] he might be saying Lord help brother
[2:03:15] will Jesus
[2:03:18] Oh what a great thing that is
[2:03:21] when the body of Christ
[2:03:24] acts like the body of Christ
[2:03:33] not for themselves because that'll
[2:03:36] that'll take care of itself
[2:03:38] but you pray for your neighbors
[2:03:42] pray for your sister and then you'll
[2:03:46] understand
[2:03:47] the effectual
[2:03:49] fervent prayer
[2:03:53] of a righteous man
