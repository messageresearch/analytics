doormat we have a very special service for you guys it's a little different but we will read some scriptures to honor god's word brother eli and myself went to nebraska and nebraska and i'll be giving a missionary report yesterday um i want to thank the lord for for everything that he's doing in our lives thankful to see you guys one more time for all our brothers that have been sick this past month you know the we're just thankful that you that you're finally healed you know our brother but we know that there's nothing impossible before our and you know it's it's i'm truly thankful for that i've learned that he's not just my pastor but he's also my brother and my friend amigo also i want to thank all the brothers and sisters that dropped off food and all their gifts when our baby was born for all the help with our children i want to thank the santana family for dealing with my two boys so we're going to go i have a little slide we'll go through some pictures vamos a veronas and then also uh after the pictures um i would like to say what we did throughout throughout the trip and just say a few quotes [Music] how many here has a true christian fellowship you know we can't have fellowship without the lord jesus christ you know god created adam to have fellowship and then he created eve because he saw that adam was you know lonely so we were made to have fellowship with the lord jesus christ so um if i want to read the definition of fellowship and it's um a friendly association especially with people who share one's interest um forgive me if i read some of these words incorrect but a cinnamon uh one of the one of them is communion uh synonymous approachment so that that all falls under fellowship today and apply that to our walk with the lord jesus christ to be in good harmony with him to be in good companionship and to become one with him that is the true fellowship um if we could please turn to first john uh chapter one uh while you turn your scriptures i would like to uh greet our brothers from well i want to thank them for their love and the support that we had while we were visiting foreign and for that true christian fellowship also i was told that her brother john anders was watching us may the lord bless you bless your brother and uh we send our love and our support to you guys so first john one and it reads that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show on to you that eternal life which was with the father and was what was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full yes this then is the message where which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleaneth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us and um in this report my focus is but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from sin reported so we could only have a a true christian fellowship if we walk in the light entonces so i i want you guys to just keep that in mind um you know our fellowship with one another should reflect our our fellowship with the lord jesus christ it should be nothing but love and we should lay our own lives for our brothers and sisters so um like i said i uh i'll be going over some uh some pictures come on mentioned um and this is the first slide we'll go to the next one this is just a picture to show you where nebraska is nebraska and if you can see we're about uh two states uh up and one to the right um it is a very beautiful state and and didn't realize that it's in the middle of the country that just that makes me think and it's red and on the middle the heart is usually in the middle and that's where we landed and north focus right above it and it's about a two hour drive yes it's a beautiful drive we'll go to the next slide please uh this is just showing you a distance if if we ever drive out there is um i guess the fastest route will go through new mexico cut through colorado kansas and making our way up to norfolk and as you can see it's about 20 hours forgive me for the mileage but i think it's more like 1200 miles and i think it's it's wonderful to to travel by car okay um brother victor no yes you know to travel by car it's it's to have fellowship with your wife your fellowship with your brothers and it's a very beautiful thing yes could go to the next slide please uh here we have some beautiful sisters uh we have brother eli in the middle of an el centro and this is brother eli's uh auntie yes and uh let me tell you she's a wonderful sister her her character is the lord jesus christ so uh and she is 21 years old and she loves the lord jesus christ and and she she really uh from from what i've seen she she respects her parents a lot that that's a big sentence what i said right there you know to honor your father and your mother it's not that easy uh her husband is brother julio i didn't get a chance to take a picture photography but such a loving brother perez he's building his own little restaurant and he makes very delicious dishes slide uh here we have our uh this is uh part of the family part of the family and our the brother here to the left is the pastor and uh he's a passage to norfolk tabernacles his brother is miguel faustino miguel faustino his his name sorry his name is brother miguel faustino oh and and when when they say i take off my hat for somebody that's that's who we take up our hat for hey you know such a respect respectable pastor very loving and very attentive you know he was putting attention to every word i said and and such such a loving loving brother next to him is his uh his wonderful wife sister sarah such a precious sister you know um waking up and making us breakfast you know before i finished my coffee she was bringing me another one already and it's just it's just those details that that makes a difference and i think that's the same thing with our christian walk we fix those little details in our lives and that's one of their grand granddaughters and i had an opportunity to talk to her and to tell her that my baby's name is ruth as well and she's very loving and um and she's just an awesome uh she's 12 years old he is and like i said sister connie next to brother eli brother eli's auntie uh sister elia del mano and the young boy on with the orange or i mean sorry the maroon sweater uh that's brother william yes this is william and he's about nine years old and he's about my son's age he's there's something very special about little that's sister berlin and uh also a great a great sister you know um i wish one day somebody would express themselves like that about me aliens it was very i had an amazing time talking talking to sister belen and and i i could i want to say i could share like a testimony with her and then you know just the trials of life you know it makes it that much sweeter when the lord jesus christ comes into our into our lives and if we could uh go to the next slide um well you know who the guy is on the on the left that's the brother eli's assistant and our brothers are watching us right now uh from norfolk the north folk they know exactly what i'm talking about uh there's brother eli are you salman a wonderful brother like we all know and i i'm so glad i had the opportunity to to fellowship with him on this trip all four of us will turn around or if they yell that little michael for some reason i turn back and go like this but uh so brother michael here he's such a wonderful young man you know he's he's fighting uh to to have fellowship with the lord jesus christ he wants to have fellowship with us how many has a perfect life here you know we all have our struggles so i ask you to please keep them in your prayers and i got to learn that he's he's uh he's very talented in the music he plays a piano on the saxophone and i got to hear him sing i i wish he would just sing so if you go to uh the next picture please or slide here we have uh sister sage and their little one and and uh they're expecting a baby and his name might be michael too for me again and uh it was very wonderful to have fellowship with her album and to see you know the the the pull of questions you know there was a lot of questions and praise god that brother eli went gloria because i'm just the assistant there so if you go to the next picture uh so this is a uh brother uh miguelito este elemento miguelito um and you know it's is there there was an attraction from day one just his personality is is he's he's strong strong strong character is a character which reminds me a lot of my dad and and he he likes to uh he works in construction and and he he has a business of laying the foundation and i think it's wonderful because you know being a pastor you have to lay the foundation in your own church i put the foundation in somebody's life and i think it's just wonderful that he does that for a living as well um he gave me uh he gave me one of those hats and i have it here just to show you aquila you know i never did show and tell in school today um as you can see the the business name is cornerstone concrete uh the moment i seen it it it was an attraction to me there's a moment you know and i think it's it's you know it's beautiful and hopefully i could take this idea from him i have another hat this is his brother uh megan little's son brother michael gave this to me elijah and it says nebraska sister lisa maybe you could help me still i believe uh so it's s-t-e-e-l-e steel um so he he also gave us a hat in nebraska and and um he brother eli was blessed also with two hats and i you know these are just hats yes but when somebody gives you something with love and with what the true heart it means it means a lot significant and and this means a lot to me so uh you go to the next picture uh here we are sister sarah brother miguelito and myself this picture was taken uh uh on the way back already at the airport esta photo if you tomato to the next slide this is brother eli his uncle and his and his auntie style man and just just a wonderful couple yeah you know when somebody can live your life by their testimony they don't have to explain to you what it is to walk in the light you uh this is uh i took this picture uh on the way back i thought it was a beautiful picture and i just wanted to share with you um you know um sometimes when we when we leave the lord jesus christ he looks far further and further every time and and we think he's very far established and with this picture it means you think that sometimes it's it's it's hard to come back but the lord jesus brother branham says that the lord jesus christ is closer than your right arm but um yeah so i just wanted to share that picture because i i thought it was a beautiful pic site um so we left last friday i just wanted to explain where everybody was curious and um we left last friday my brother peter dropped us off around three in the morning our flight was at 6am we landed in dallas texas about two hours later about nine before we got to omaha's sister uh our sister sarah anthony omaha was was so in contact with it and and she was calling us because it's it's already november and it's cold out there but then she also said that there was very strong winds about like 30 or 40 miles uh gushes of wind and you know what uh i i got happy yo that sounds crazy right but i got happy because brother branham says that when the storm comes the ego gets happy the ego lifts up his wings and it goes right through the storm and he says that his left wing is the old testament and his right wing is the new testament so i got happy to hear there was wind greg and i didn't even know why so i i think that's that's a god with us you know brother brown talks so wonderful about the the eagles we really got to know each other with uh with fellowship from there we took off and we drove two hours to to uh to norfolk north folk where we continue to have fellowship at their house and and i think that's that's when god comes in the scene yo crocodile and i see that i i say this because you know it's it's the simple things you know when we open the door for somebody it feels the person feels very good so i think those little details is what we should be working on friday night uh their their son came over with his kids and he invited us to his house and he wanted us to stay there so we went over had fellowship had late dinner and it was such a wonderful time they're they're little ones that got a little sick and the only thing i could think of is and brother eli and i were in our children foreign and it was wonderful to see uh say sister sage you know jump into action as a mom i think we should honor our moms more often saturday we we woke up a little late we were up for almost 24 hours and so we we head over there to uh to our the pastor's house and we're we got lost in fellowship and uh next thing it was like four o'clock because those sisters that are here that know what it takes to prepare food to take your time out of the day to work hard to put money out of your pockets i greatly appreciate all his efforts that evening we we went he's building a business a restaurant and and he wanted brother eli and his uncle to pray over the building and i think it's a wonderful thing if we put god first above all things you know god is going to be with us and no matter what it is at work our business our co-workers of all things you put god first and and we should see all the blessings we we went back at this this his restaurant is about 60 miles out out of the town [Music] so sunday morning brother elina we get up a little early um our beautiful brother asked brother like to preach and he told us that the doors open at 9 30. i thought it was nice to say 9 30 not 10. you know and we were all there on time um and you know i'm sharing the report with you guys but it was nice to to to show up at church and and to see the sisters in meditation truly expecting of the lord jesus christ we had their church is one of one of their houses and it was a very wonderful time um the worship was beautiful it was it was wonderful worship you know um we sang acapella and there's just something about seeing in a cappella you know it truly brings down uh the the holy spirit um so our brother eli uh preached about uh on exodus 20 1920. and his his title was fear and and he talked about that there's two fears classes and and he brought it so wonderful where she was the pastor asked me to say a few words and if you know me i was down by a couple minutes um there was um brother eli's message was was very very powerful and and you know they needed to hear it and i needed to hear it because there we know that there's fear but there's no fear in god so but there but we can have fear but fear of god so if that sounds a little confusing talk to brother and we got to see how he's building everything the basement and everything and it was it was very wonderful you know as a man you know you like to see construction and shovels and and you know bulldozers or the tractors that he had come um and i really enjoyed it and i thank them for for taking melter we continue our fellowship at their house uh we we ate and then uh we had you know when you're having fellowship at home companies and you start testifying of the lord and next do you know somebody's being blessed uh and then the pastor would always come in and quote scriptures that late evening uh we went back to brother michael's house and we had a wonderful time and sage sister sage had a lot of questions she belongs to the lutheran church and and it was wonderful to to hear her um i'll i'll be honest with you and i told her yeah you know she knows more scriptures by heart that i could ever learn so we had a very good time uh monday morning we had breakfast over at the pastor's house sister made fresh flower tortillas frescas and and that just you know made me thought of my wife of my mom my grandma me my mom you know just it's just such a bless blessing time you know time to reflect on your parents and all those hard efforts after after having breakfast they they drove us back to to uh to omaha omaha and it was a two-hour drive and they took us out to eat to crack a barrel come out a cracker barrel and uh they dropped those off um i'm very thankful for for all their other efforts to drive two hours to pick us up and drive and drive us back today that is true true christian fellowship when you're willing to put your your life aside to bless somebody else so um that's that's what we did and i have a few quotes and uh this quote you can find it in a way to have fellowship yes um i'm not going to read the whole thing because i think some of your fans sleep my brother peter's over there falling asleep i just i just want to make you laugh a little bit um so is paragraph 18 i'd rather have a church i would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that than every spirit gift operating in the church now that might sound hard in a pentecostal group but i would rather have it where there is gifts there they fail where there is gifts they will bring confusion where there is gifts they can be and if you had a perfect love you'll have perfect gifts and fellowship brings gifts it says i would rather have a church that knows nothing about spiritual gifts and just be so in love with each other and with christ i asked myself do we love each other tonight do we really really love each other if i was to offend you this evening will you be willing to love me anyways if you see if you see the deacon that kind of scolds you because you were wrong are you willing to accept it and are you willing to love him you know if you don't have that fellowship with christ there's no way that you're going to have fellowship with your brother and true love comes from the lord jesus christ is because he was made that way he was made to have fellowship what what fellowship is i got four days driving to do starting tomorrow and i had to drive it by myself in a little old truck and someone a friend of mine is coming down i just left word this afternoon to ride all the way out there with me and ride back by myself on a greyhound bus his little swiss heart and then have to ride all the way back up to uh wisconsin on a bus or some or somehow just to get back or to have fellowship with his children you know it's it's beautiful when somebody wants to go with you to have fellowship yes you know even even as an assistant to brothers it was wonderful to be with him to be able to experience that fellowship with him here we have this brother that went two thousand five hundred miles with brother branham that fellowship brings healing maybe we're too busy with our phones or our tv shows more important than to go whether pastor to to some town or television is i think it's amazing that this brother wanted to cr to go cross-country just to have fellowship if you could turn your scriptures to john three first first john three siebre primera de juan capitolo uh verse eleven el brasicolons for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and whosoever slew him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous we know that we have passed from death onto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abides in death his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murder has eternal life abiding in him todd hereby perceive with the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we outed to lay down our lives for the brethren good and see it his brother have need and shutted up his balls of compassion from him how dweller the love of god in him is my little children let us not love and word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth so i think we we should don't tell somebody that you love him but show him that you love him we need to put ourselves in action and start loving our brothers and sisters because you know it says on the verse 14 we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abides in him in death and it says that we should lay down our own lives for our brothers how many times are we willing to put our lives down for somebody else is how many times are we willing to share a testimony to bring life to somebody else you know sometimes there could be problems instead of stepping all over him you know how many times do we just step all over our brothers and not have that christian fellowship cristiano how many times we can't forgive our brothers we can't forgive of that true christian fellowship every action that we take it has to reflect the lord jesus christ i would like to share a little testimony testimony of my niece and i say this so we can learn not to do the same mistake you know uh my niece came down to visit us she's about 18 years old and the day that she was going to fly back she was folding her clothes and so you know i got down and sat down on the floor with her what is your favorite piece you know we got to get to that level of of the youth and the children and i was helping her fold her clothes and she pulled out a mini skirt and and i said oh you have a skirt but i'm never going to wear it again you know on on the way down to phoenix you say in camino we stopped at one of those churches that you guys go to um and i was judged they looked at me up and down they made me feel like the worst person you know that hurts yes especially coming from a message church especially but my niece told me that from from that day forward she will never wear a skirt again and she says that there were a bunch of hypocrites and just because they had long skirts and long hair you know a lot of the times we could be that stumbling rock so let's let's get into that fellowship with the lord jesus christ let's not judge our fallen brothers and somebody wants to walk through that door right now uh are we going to judge [Music] why should we feel better or greater than somebody else i i think we should we should have a true fellowship with the lord jesus christ i have a few i have a few quotes but um i want to share a testimony that you know a lot of you we i've shared it so many times and that was the fellowship before my conversion yes and and that was with my wife you know i wasn't in that fellowship with the lord jesus christ and our relationship our fellowship would never work because i wasn't right with the lord jesus christ and and when we're not right we're we're not in fellowship with the lord or with in communion with the lord and not having a right the right attitude towards anything but when that fellowship came to companies when i accepted the lord jesus christ as my savior and he started cleansing me through the word i was sorry for everything that i did and i want to live my own life for her because i knew i didn't deserve it so that's the difference i have in a fellowship with the lord jesus christ i'm going to read the last quote and it's the longest one so i hope you enjoy it it's from the queen of sheba del mensage and after this i'll i'll be finishing and if the musicians will come up in a couple minutes greatly appreciate it uh got two little girls setting uh sitting back there rebecca and sarah there are both daddy's little girls when i go out why i'm or they're always waiting for me to come back they love daddy and you know how daddy loves them there's a little parable one more one morning that i'd come in early and the kitties had waited long and i was late so they had to and i and i was so worn out yesterday i just couldn't sleep and i got up early sitting in the chair after a while i heard a scramble in the children's bedroom becky had woke up and she wondered where daddy is if he got in here she comes through the house just as hard as she can behind her come her little sister about so tall now becky was was big and she was about 13. and skinny sir was a little chunky fella her pajamas feet her pajamas feet about twice the size they ought to be she was a falling she was a falling over most everything in the house and becky come and jumped right at a straddle of my leg becky is uh and her big long legs hung down to the floor she could balance yourself pretty well i think about like the churches sometimes that's all right we appreciate that and she put her arms around me to hug me real tight and she said my daddy papa and when she heard sarah quesada her little sister coming she turned and looked at sora and she said sarah sarah reminded me of this little church that just started you know it's it isn't very old antigua sometimes it gets up in the air and there is nothing left for you little sarah dropped her little lips down is you know they get a little upside topsy turvy sometimes they just but as long as they're there so i just took both arms and i hugged her up close to me and she rolled that little head around them little black guys stuck out and looked at becky i want to tell you something said it it may be true that you got i don't know all the ins and outs maybe of the bible no no that's all i care for is if i'm so completely surrendered to him and to his will that he can work his his works let the world say what they want you know sometimes we feel that we're holding on to the lord jesus christ um you know a lot of times we're barely holding on maybe we're not ready to forgive our brothers he says sometimes we can't even forgive our children but i think it's time for god to hold on to us i think it's time for him to have a full fellowship with us just as adam had with him at the garden i want to have that fellowship i have those same struggles that you do i'm fighting the same fight that you are este and our brothers in nebraska are fighting the same fight same struggles why not go to the lord jesus christ why not let everything out surrender our arms even if we're not balanced right and let him take control of her lives i don't know about you but that's what i want in my life i'm far from perfect so praise god for that gloria you know i i there's fear sometimes this is item and it's hard to overcome yes difficult and i want to thank my tokyo brother miguelito because he says something over there there's a brother named john out there [Music] he's from um he's saying a special el canton special and it was a cappella and
