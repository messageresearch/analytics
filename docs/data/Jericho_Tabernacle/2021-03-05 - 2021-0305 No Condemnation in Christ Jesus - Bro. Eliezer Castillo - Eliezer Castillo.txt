like to turn with me to romans and i'd like to greet each and every one of you in the precious name of our lord jesus christ the bible says therefore there there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and also if you'd like to turn with me to revelations 12 10. the bible says and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night entonces heavenly father father celestial lord we just we want to say we love you father we thank you that you've been with us throughout the days we thank you lord for the expectation you you fulfilling the expectation of your people completed and you're within our worship lord we come here with an expectation father father knowing that whenever you're on the scene lord things have to happen father so we invite you in our presence we invite you to take control and we give you the glory glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated uh there's a scripture in job existence job 13 23. [Music] amen it's just that dirty devil he doesn't want us to worship him amen amen um job 13 23 hope 37 um it's job asking the lord a question a question he said how many are mine iniquities and sins cuantasinikidades make me to know my transgression and my sin tender transgression now now that's that's a hard prayer to pray to ask god to show us our sins and our transgressions and transgressions this prayer is is not a prayer for everybody for for god to shed light upon what we are doing wrong you know whenever david he sinned when he was drawn away from god he went to the lord and he cried out to the lord and he said that his hand was heavy upon him it was a heavy hand of conviction in his life for for a person that is is uh giving their hearts to the lord a person that is stable inside the lord jesus christ their prayer is to ask the lord lord what are my iniquities what are my sins because the closer you get to the lord the more in detail you want those sins to be cast out when god causes your life to be completely filled with the holy spirit then it's easy to find what kind of sin you have in your life it's easy to find your faults it's fascinating and and the closer you get to the lord the more you want him to find your faults so you can become perfect so that whenever you pray to the lord there is nothing holding you back from blessings uh brother branham says in the message without money or without price this is impressive brother branham says god have mercy on us brother i would like to live in this life and my desire um and my desire to even the least bit of his grieving i'll know it in my heart i should do something that would grieve him i'd be able to fill it just in a moment the closer you get to the lord enter my circle the more you want god to reveal your sins entrepreneurs god will go there and he will convict you here is job the bible says he was a perfect man the bible says that he was perfect so he would go and he asked the lord lord if i have any iniquities if i have any faults a sinner will never pray this prayer if they don't want to come to the lord why wouldn't a sinner pray this prayer because they don't want their sins to be found out in john 3 16. juan trasi says does anybody know that scripture for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life now this is a present tense scripture people are being saved now by this scripture if you believe now in this scripture now you can be saved for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world he did not come to this world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen that's our jesus christ today if you're being condemned through the gospel or through jesus christ you're listening to the wrong gospel jesus christ did not come to this world jesus christ he came to save the world through him he didn't come to condemn us there'll be one gay in the white throne judgment well he will be the supreme judge but now present tense he came to the world to save us to save each and every person that wants salvation each and every person that wants deliverance jesus christ came to save them now jesus christ and if there's any condemnation in christ jesus for you existed jesus go back to the bible go back to the message you missed something jose novio algo because jesus christ does not condemn jesus christ jesus christ he came to save the world now let's go to uh john 3 18. the next verse he that believeth on him is not condemned the word believeth means believes but he that believes not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son jesus does not condemn jesus now let's go to verse 19. he says and this is the condemnation so the bible says that jesus did not come to the world to condemn anyone who takes a leap of faith if you want to take that that acceptance of jesus christ you are not condemned you are saved by the blood of jesus christ because he you accepted him you accepted his blood but he that believeth because their deeds were evil you know i always heard brother branham talk about sin is unbelief and me being and here in this scripture plainly tells us that sin is unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already and this is the condemnation yes that man loved darkness rather than life amen amen sin is unbelief the reason why we love the darkness rather than light is because we believe not especially so that's the condemnation is is that their sins did not want to be discovered a christian asks the lord on cristiano lepidal lord what are my sins lord senordime i don't want to live apart from you lord you know though it hurts me but it's a necessary thing to continue forward with the lord necessarily but someone that is in darkness and he loves his deeds he knows that if he accepts jesus christ is to shed light on someone's sin when the lord convicts your heart it's because he's shedding light in your sins that's why this a sinner does not want to get close to the lord amen amen the bible says and this is the condemnation this this word is crisis and it's uh a separating significa or a on a selection or a judgment or an opinion or decision given concerning anything opinion or decision concerning it's a judgment this that's what condemnation means it means that you have gone through trial significa and you have been judged already those that believe not have been judged already not by jesus christ he did not come to this world to judge we judged ourselves by our unbelief this is true of all wicked men they choose to practice their d's in darkness they're afraid of the lights because they could be easily detected in evidence [Music] and his conscience would trouble him if it were enlightened in any way many sinners are in a tremendous battle here muchos pecadores now i read this quote the last time last friday but i would like to read it one more time it's in um uh what shall i do with jesus uh jesus called christ jesus christ it is not easy for a person to go to hell a man fights his way to hell the first lie you ever told the primer you know it was wrong [Music] the first cigarette you ever smoked you know it it was wrong no it was wrong but in your conscience told you it was wrong but you continually run through the red light but run over the barricades you're reckless it is uh you want to do it anyhow you're before you have a wreck you have to run the red light before you have the wreck you have to down in the road you have to the warning signs that's been put and he knows more than anybody else he won't listen to the the signs that warnings of oncoming judgment and and uh and those who reject christ another quote in baum and gilead uh god blocks the way in is he sends it out over the ether waves of the radio ela he sends it over the television he sends it by published words he [Music] [Music] that's the sinner out in the world that's somebody that doesn't want to serve the lord they don't want anything to do with it because once you give your heart to the lord and before you can get into christ jesus jesus you have to make it right with the lord before you can do anything you have to make it right with the lord and the lord the way he uses that is through conviction it brings light to your sins it makes you ashamed but conviction will always point you to christ jesus conviction is from god conviction is needed for conversion conversion from a conversion from a sinner to a saint de la conversion and for the perfection of a christian a para la perfection judgment starts in the house of the lord and that's the best judgment that i ever won in my life that i can sit in the pews and the holy ghost can [Music] there will be no nothing to to hide your sins the best that conviction will point you to jesus christ and then jesus christ the one that was came to the world every habit that is amazing that's why i'm a christian cristiano i'm not a christian for these nice clothes no cristiano pro i'm not a christian to act all right religious no cristiano things that i feel like no one would ever forgive me for it the things that i i've thought in my life in my mind no one could ever forgive me for those things the one to take out my anger i want to take out all my pasts oh my president all my future follow me it was jesus christ and before but i have all righteousness in me if there's any righteousness in me if there's any good in you it's because it's jesus christ he is our righteousness he will forgive you he will change the way you think that is a promise but you got to believe it that's it brother branham says that a pardon is not a pardon unless it be received as a party come on that's as simple as it is i'll see this in the u.s well uh do i have to comb my hair the way you do wanna do do i have to dress the way you do it do i have to do this and do i have to do that you're all you have to do is accept jesus christ he did not come here to condemn you he came what a beautiful thing oh that makes me want to serve him even more eso there is no works of myself but it's him it's all on him and lays i can't hold myself the way other people do you know there's people that haven't even given their hearts to the lord they've never become a christian in christian and they act better than i do oh man they you cannot point one finger in their life good standing citizens there's no way i can live a christian life there's no way i can be an honest person there's no way i could be not a hateful person without jesus christ he is the one that that lifts us up he is the one that allows us to walk in the righteous steps of a man throw it away because jesus christ died for you so that you don't have to act so that you don't have to work but you can accept him and then he'll work for you he'll do all the miracles for you amen amen that this conviction is the conviction now before i go forward you could see it on the screen there is no condemnation in christ jesus christ but i want to see the differences of conviction and condemnation so this conviction is a conviction it it it's needed necesita to come to christ when um peter was was preaching on uh on the day of pentecost the bible says that these people that were listening they said what shall we do then what do i do how do i receive jesus christ and that's when we hear this famous um verse from peter escondo famoso de pedro acts 2 38. then peter said unto them it means that you've missed the mark blanco and you've got to try it again peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ receive how many are my iniquities lord [Music] why because you begin to want every sin every dark thing done away with your in your life you want everything done amen amen this is a hard prayer this is not a prayer for the week this is not a prayer for those that still have a little habit in the side and they don't want to leave it this is a prayer for those that want christ to take control over their lives and if our hearts condemn us in first john 3 20 it says so the other word in uh john 3 19. and it means judgment significa but this word condemn it's a different word now i'm going to attempt to say it i i'm not going to say it real well it's category and it's to find fault with is the other one was judgment it means that you already had your trial and you have been judged but if our hearts condemn us which means if there's any if you your hearts have been found with any fault in them if you have any convictions in your heart if you're pricked in your heart if you try to live a christian life but but there's still something holding you back there's a conviction there the bible says our god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things if your conscience is is knocking on the door god knows all things lost and he's greater than your heart he's greater than your conscience he's a more perfect judge than your heart can be elle your conscience and the one that knows it all so the conscience is a verdict that's in fellow or that can neither be infallible nor final conscience because he's the maker of your conscience of all the things that you know he's a greater witness than our conscience and he's a superior judge unto it superior jesus christ is the judge the superior the supreme judge jesus christ but he is our lawyer too but your conscience is is killing you today go to the one that knows it all this is in the exposition of the seven church ages the book and the liberal exposition uh in patmos he said no and he here he's explaining and he's talking about john when he sees jesus christ in the vision no human could stand the full effect of that vision his strength was utterly gone completely john fell at his feet though uh juan carlos but the hand of the lord in love touched him fear not don't be afraid i am the first and the last no tengas i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore. what is there to fear the judgment fell on upon him in the cross or at the cross at the grave and when he descended and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus jesus see for a surety our eternity i mean our attorney is our judge as the judge as judge the case is settled it is finished there is now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promises have ever what promises has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it um fear punishment or death it all it has all been overcome today he is the mighty conqueror now in fir first john 3 21 it says beloved if our heart condemns us not we have confidence towards god in brim when he could take all of our condemnations he can do it to you now if if you feel condemned in your heart jesus christ can take all of your sins and took the condemnation upon himself there has been condemnation has been paid for jesus christ you know what i deserve is the ultimate death what anybody in this world deserves is the ultimate death he took all the brunt of sin all the judgment upon himself so that you do not feel condemned but that dirty devil perez diablo he will come and he will put condemning thoughts in the people you know what salvation does then you lay there powerless conviction brings you to christ it'll cause you or it'll shed light on your sin by illuminati and cause you to say well i need to come to the lord and ask for forgiveness but condemnation is that you have been tried and you have been judged how can i be a good christian christian how could i be a christian full of power when i feel condemned when i feel like jesus blood could not save me cuando yo siento de que la sangre de jesus no whenever you think your sins are too great for the blood of jesus christ and i was working at a bank and i i started just feeling the anxiety i didn't know what was going clean and i told my my co-worker something's wrong i think i'm sick i don't i didn't know what was going on with me company it was something that i could not control that's where anxiety attacks start when it feels like you can't control the situation and i felt condemned i felt like jesus christ did not love me anymore such a lie from the devil it takes away the blood of jesus christ for you it takes away all power how how can i ask the lord lord heal me if i feel condemned if i feel like the blood of jesus christ did not save me then how could it heal me how am i worthy man we got to take those thoughts out the devil is in attack today el diablo like oh you're not being good enough of a christian christian so what do you do oh you're not praying enough what do you do you you you should be good to pray gas is in business you'll never you'll never measure up to a good christian christian and you try and you try and you try it but you don't know that you're listening to a condemnation thought a condemning thought a thought of condemnation will not point you to jesus christ it will cause you to think that your sin is too far great it will make you feel like oh no one could save me but that's the biggest dishonor we can ever do to the lord to tell the lord this one this job is way too big for you man i'm i'm a crazy person oh this is a very hard case to break you you don't know what you're getting yourself into lord senor i've got many problems no no there's nothing no existence not that there is nothing too great for no existence oh no not this one no no esther no no this was the unpardonable sin [Music] why is the lord still calling you there would not be you know how mad he is can i give you an illustration real quick the devil el diablo lucifer lucifer he was the most beautiful angel we know this is he was the closest thing to god he was a cherubim brother says that he was god's right hand man this is what a beautiful position oh man to be at the feet of god to always be there in his praises but he was the almost co-equal but he wasn't satisfied with that i want to be god i want to be the one worshipped well we know the story that kicked him out say none of this funny business he had pride in himself and finally there was a war and michael kicked him out finally and i don't want to get too deep into this but the bible jesus says that he saw satan fall from heaven as a lightning jesus and and he fell unto the earth unto the earth so that makes my brain to turn me well brother burnham says this branham that when sane was cast out this was on the day of calvary if you want to look at it he was cast out and it was like a black sheep fell upon the face of the earth when he was cast out okay we're not going to go too much but so i begin to to understand and present that when god finally so so he was cast out onto the earth there was a great big war a great big battle and and whenever we find the earth in the beginning it was void it was dark oscura and it was without form almost sound sounds like a battlefield i don't know it just sounds like it right but he was cast into the earth wandering to and fro from the earth and finally finally throughout the days or throughout the year he began to create let there be light separate waterer from the land separate light from darkness and here is this condemned creature hiding in the shadows what is what is my god doing what is he doing and every day god would create something greater and greater and greater and greater he said let there be the the creep in crawling things he said let there be the fish in the sea and then throughout the days the creation began to get greater and greater amen amen and then throughout the days he said let there be beasts in the field he's studying all these things that are happening he said let let us create man in our own image again god said let us make man in my image but he's going to be me on the earth the fury he had within himself who is this man that is like god that's you today that's you this evening but he picked the people that would be children sons and daughters of god there will not only be almost but that would be equal with god whatever that brother said don't listen to him oh just continue with your sin it you're not saved anyways oh that's a good one that would guard me a lot it's like why does it matter you're not saved anyways jesus doesn't love you you've done the unpardonable sin as cometh he's trying to tell you you're not a child of god he was led and what did that dirty devil do he said if thou be the son of god in the name of the lord jesus christ jesus did not come to condemn oh maybe if you can lord heal me he's willing to heal you el este he's willing to save you believe and you and your family you and your house will be saved oh the devil will say oh your family oh they're way too gone apply that token no applique believe on the lord jesus christ and he will give you your heart's desire according to his word he will deceive you you know what it was the most sad the saddest thing i saw in the scripture was when judas betrayed jesus that when he betrayed him he saw he saw that he had been condemned he felt remorse and return the 30 pieces of silver priests and elders that was the devil condemned him lo condeno and he said you have been tried and you have been already judged and we know the the end of his life don't allow that no permit condemnation to go over you don't allow that without coming to christ first no permit if you want something from the lord he's here right now he's here to give you anything you desire your healing if you're not feeling good take it up to the lord i promise you that you will be healed take away that doubt take away that doubt whatever doubt that you have in your mind that you will not be healed that you will not be saved that oh i don't feel any different it doesn't matter how you feel no importa they didn't say did you feel it he said do you believe i don't care how you feel no importa i don't care what everything that's gone into through your life believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be delivered you say you will be healed you will be filled with the holy ghost you will have what you desire in the name of the lord jesus christ he took all condemnation for me amen amen if the musicians would come up stop telling the lord stop bringing up sins that have already been forgiven stop bringing up the past with the lord he's not a human like us with all respect he doesn't have bird brain like us where we have to keep reminding people you're trying to make god remember something he could never remember oh i still feel ashamed because i did this lord remember what are you talking about my childhood he wants to take control of your life there's a reason why he knows who you are he wants to attack your identity and if you can be in this condemned state of mind then there is no scripture it not exist in gunas no promise in the bible that can help you okay because you're basically saying the blood of jesus christ isn't good enough for me you know you know who is [Music] your mind out of that social media take your mind out of those things that cause you to feel guilty cause you to feel unworthy [Music] [Music] amen i mean so
