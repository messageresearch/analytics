[1:12:52] this spring
[1:12:54] i had uh i had
[1:12:56] asked the lord that i'd like to take my
[1:12:58] daughter asia to a church camp
[1:13:16] and no no we didn't hear nothing
[1:13:21] but then uh i kind of just left it alone
[1:13:25] and then uh a couple months ago
[1:13:28] we went to tucson
[1:13:40] and i got to sit down and have breakfast
[1:13:42] by brother
[1:13:52] i was wondering how i would be able to
[1:13:53] get a hold of you to see if you come to
[1:13:55] to our church camp
[1:13:57] hermano esta tando de coming
[1:14:11] he never does not listen to our prayers
[1:14:13] tonight church
[1:14:16] like brother
[1:14:17] said he already had answered his prayer
[1:14:19] before the walk was even over
[1:14:25] so again we thank the lord for being
[1:14:27] here
[1:14:29] for hearing our prayer
[1:14:32] for inspiring our brother
[1:14:35] so we think we thank the lord jesus so
[1:14:37] much for that
[1:14:39] so many stories i've heard of people
[1:14:41] coming to camp
[1:14:42] historians
[1:14:45] i heard that the brothers from nakadosis
[1:14:47] they drove 19 hours to be here
[1:14:53] would you mind standing for the brothers
[1:14:54] from nagadosha
[1:15:08] and i've heard that i heard that they've
[1:15:10] been fasting the whole time excited to
[1:15:12] come here
[1:15:16] and hear something like that
[1:15:19] you have to feel nothing but inadequate
[1:15:22] um
[1:15:24] and shame on us if we were to speak
[1:15:26] anything but the word of god tonight
[1:15:30] may the lord bless their their blessed
[1:15:32] hearts tonight
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] and all of our
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] heavenly father
[1:15:58] as we approach thy throne of grace and
[1:16:00] mercy
[1:16:03] lord we are not adequate lord but father
[1:16:06] by your blood that you have shed for us
[1:16:10] there is no reason tonight father
[1:16:13] that there should be anyone that would
[1:16:15] leave here tonight
[1:16:17] that would be sick
[1:16:45] of those that have sacrificed so much
[1:16:48] sacrifice bless them exceedingly
[1:16:50] abundantly
[1:16:52] bless each heart tonight here
[1:16:55] we ask these things in the name of the
[1:16:56] lord jesus christ
[1:16:58] holy spirit come into the word tonight
[1:17:05] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[1:17:08] amen and amen before you're seated
[1:17:12] into your bibles
[1:17:14] to galatians chapter 5
[1:17:18] we are going to read
[1:17:20] our theme
[1:17:21] the theme of these
[1:17:22] services
[1:17:26] but i've always been taught that if you
[1:17:28] want to understand the verse
[1:17:33] read the one before it okay
[1:17:37] brother jose thank you so much gracias
[1:17:39] for your service tonight brother god
[1:17:40] bless you amen galatians 5
[1:17:43] 24.
[1:17:46] when you have it would you say amen
[1:17:49] i see although it is so beautiful to see
[1:17:52] the pages of the sacred bible being
[1:17:54] turned
[1:18:10] you all have been
[1:18:24] is something you can take with you
[1:18:27] anywhere
[1:18:30] i've been to places where they don't
[1:18:31] have that visit
[1:18:34] and the demons will tremble just by the
[1:18:36] look of that book
[1:18:38] diablo
[1:18:49] how sweet it is to hear the pages turn
[1:18:54] amen amen
[1:18:56] chapter 5 verse 24 it says
[1:19:00] and they that are christ
[1:19:03] have crucified the flesh
[1:19:05] with the afflictions
[1:19:11] amen may the lord add his blessing to
[1:19:13] his reading of his word
[1:19:19] amen amen
[1:19:21] in this scripture that we just read
[1:19:24] we find that
[1:19:26] when we take the name of jesus christ in
[1:19:29] our lives
[1:19:32] it's a bed of roses right
[1:19:47] that's not what god's word says
[1:19:50] when we take the name of christ in our
[1:19:52] lives
[1:19:55] there is a crucifixion
[1:19:59] of the flesh
[1:20:02] now that doesn't mean
[1:20:05] that you go and you have someone nailed
[1:20:06] you want to cross
[1:20:11] i know many people will try that
[1:20:14] that's not what it means
[1:20:16] but there is a crucifixion of the flesh
[1:20:21] that has to happen
[1:20:23] and it means that you die to your own
[1:20:25] self-will
[1:20:29] your own self-will has to die
[1:20:33] if you're christ
[1:20:35] now if you're not christ
[1:20:38] you'll live whatever old little old life
[1:20:40] you want to live
[1:20:42] but if you belong to christ
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:58] and so if you're not willing to do that
[1:21:02] you'll never make it to the next verse
[1:21:04] in this chapter
[1:21:07] you'll never make it to
[1:21:09] the theme of these meetings
[1:21:39] that's why it's called a crucifixion a
[1:21:42] crucifixion but if you're not willing to
[1:21:44] do that
[1:21:46] you're not christ
[1:21:48] and you're never going to make it to
[1:21:49] verse 25.
[1:21:52] now verse 25
[1:21:54] if
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:34] you know as as i was a as i was getting
[1:22:36] ready to come

[1:23:06] have you ever let the lord change your
[1:23:07] mind you don't got nothing else to worry
[1:23:09] about
[1:23:12] but as i was considering this team
[1:23:16] uh i realized something
[1:23:18] that the way that the theme is written
[1:23:23] walk with god
[1:23:25] it's written as a command
[1:23:28] our subtitle is a command

[1:45:05] commands to your children
[1:45:11] you have to be in a position
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:28] we love our mothers
[1:45:31] mothers mothers you have a very
[1:45:33] important role to play us
[1:45:38] you need to be in a position in your
[1:45:40] home

[1:45:50] and now how many children do we have
[1:45:53] pretty much everybody everybody is
[1:45:55] somebody's child

[1:46:24] amen you got to be in that position
[1:46:26] that is a huge responsibility
[1:46:30] don't ever forsake those no
[1:46:34] you are charged young people
[1:46:37] by god's word
[1:46:53] that you stay close to your mother and
[1:46:55] father's laws and commands
[1:47:01] everybody's still here
[1:47:03] why is it important to tie them and bind
[1:47:06] them upon
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:48:30] run
[1:48:37] at some point everybody's gonna try to
[1:48:39] run
[1:48:42] but tonight the commandment is to walk
[1:49:40] to stand on god's
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:50:07] we as parents
[1:50:22] our children
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:51:04] no matter how old
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:46] it's
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:18] [Music]
[1:52:32] [Music]
[1:52:50] she won't let you go
[1:52:58] young people
[1:53:01] the enemy
[1:53:03] he's going to come in like a flood in
[1:53:04] your life
[1:53:07] but when he does
[1:53:09] god raises up a standard
[1:53:24] the lamp
[1:53:36] would you walk in this light were they
[1:53:38] coming out in saluz
[1:53:41] thy word
[1:53:42] is a lamp unto my feet
[1:53:46] and a light unto my path
[1:53:51] we got about
[1:53:52] it looks like about eight to ten more
[1:53:54] minutes
[1:53:56] you want to stand for just a minute
[1:54:00] just down and stretch out your legs for
[1:54:01] a minute
[1:54:04] can you just sing the song i
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:19] love me
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:32] oh
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:49] sometimes we just need a little option
[1:54:51] can you sing the song
[1:54:53] just smile and say
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:30] amen amen he can be seated
[1:55:34] so the first thing we need to know
[1:55:38] first thing you need in order to walk
[1:55:41] is what escape what do you need to walk
[1:55:43] with okay
[1:55:58] if you don't have feet it's a little
[1:55:59] hard to walk
[1:56:02] now your feet are what god gave you to
[1:56:04] walk with los piezkos
[1:56:08] i know probably some of you guys some of
[1:56:10] you girls can probably walk on your
[1:56:11] hands
[1:57:01] the next thing you need in this
[1:57:02] scripture
[1:57:05] is a lamp into my feet and a light into
[1:57:07] my path to palabrasi
[1:57:50] looking down
[1:58:31] that you
[1:58:32] choose so immediately this removes all
[1:58:36] the blame that you can place on somebody
[1:58:38] else
[1:58:41] so many of us say oh nobody understands
[1:58:43] me ok
[1:58:46] my parents they don't understand me
[1:58:47] please father
[1:58:49] if somebody would just understand me i'd
[1:58:51] feel better
[1:58:54] we've all felt that way haven't we todd
[1:58:58] there's a news flash
[1:59:00] when you
[1:59:29] we are pulling ourselves into our own
[1:59:31] little selfish shells
[1:59:36] and in that we go into a delusion
[1:59:40] illusion that someone else has caused
[1:59:42] our problems
[1:59:45] we become a shellfish
[1:59:49] we ought to know that as soon as we are
[1:59:51] feeling that way
[1:59:54] run walk away from that
[2:00:37] where you and i wind up don't us
[2:00:41] nobody else's fault
[2:00:43] it's an individual decision
[2:00:46] individual which path of life you're
[2:00:48] going to take
[2:00:52] you can choose
[2:01:28] your choice tonight is a matter of life
[2:01:30] and death
[2:01:34] and i'll
[2:02:02] i'm a good little boy
[2:02:04] i'm a good little girl okay
[2:02:06] i go to church
[2:02:08] i sing in the choirs
[2:02:10] i sing specials even
[2:02:13] i play an instrument
[2:02:16] i'm a song leader
[2:02:30] but are you
[2:02:40] in order to have light loose
[2:02:42] you have to have a lamp see us
[2:02:58] cellular
[2:03:07] we'll be walking around camp like this
[2:03:11] i see
[2:03:14] you know what the problem with this is
[2:03:17] because this cell phone
[2:03:19] cellular is not just a lamp onto your
[2:03:21] feet
[2:03:24] and it's not just a light to your path
[2:03:35] [Music]
