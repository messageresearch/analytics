[31:24] delta
[31:26] and um
[31:27] from 2019 and we remember brother john
[31:43] and i know that um it hasn't been easy
[31:48] and since december last year

[31:53] this church
[31:56] and election of the new pastor
[32:10] i don't know you you don't know me and
[32:12] donald

[32:42] muy contento de ver mucho de los
[32:43] ministers

[32:51] you know i'm not here to speak about
[32:53] myself
[33:06] a spoken word and voice of god
[33:08] recordings
[33:22] listen to
[33:23] [Music]
[33:32] so all the english messages
[33:34] our family has worked with them
[33:52] i think my parents might be streaming

[34:00] the scriptures
[34:03] this is our first time to be with you
[34:05] yes
[34:07] you know maybe another minister would
[34:09] speak differently
[34:13] they might try to
[34:14] speak uh great revelations or deep
[34:17] mysteries or something jesus
[34:26] but i believe we need to hear what the
[34:28] lord would say to us
[34:31] uh what the lord wants to say to the
[34:33] church
[34:36] way before tonight
[34:39] this service was pre-planned
[34:43] and so i want to speak from my heart if
[34:44] that's okay
[34:56] so i want to speak on captured by
[34:59] recovery it is
[35:07] so let's stand and turn to
[35:09] psalms chapter 39
[35:14] we have prayed for the word and for us
[35:16] all together
[35:23] this is the psalm of david
[35:26] and he was speaking this to a chief
[35:29] musician
[35:32] it was a a levite and a chief singer
[35:38] and david was speaking to him
[35:42] as we read these verses just put
[35:44] yourself in the scriptures
[35:48] and especially the last verse of the
[35:50] chapter especially
[35:53] i said i will take heed
[35:56] to my ways that i sin not with my tongue
[36:00] i will keep my mouth with a bridle
[36:03] while the wicked is before me
[36:09] guarded
[36:13] i was dumb with silence
[36:16] i held my peace
[36:18] even from good
[36:20] and my sorrow was stirred
[36:30] my heart was hot within me
[36:32] while i was musing
[36:35] the fire burned
[36:37] then spake eye with my
[36:47] oh lord
[36:49] make me to know mine end
[36:52] and the measure of my days
[36:54] what it is that i may know
[36:57] how frail i am.
[37:06] behold thou has made my days as in hand
[37:10] breath
[37:11] this is what a hand breath is
[37:18] not very long yes
[37:24] the lord has made our days like a hand
[37:26] breath and
[37:27] my age is as nothing before thee
[37:34] immediately
[37:37] verily every man
[37:39] i think we can say women also
[37:41] at his best state is altogether vanity
[37:46] is
[37:53] surely every man walketh in a vain show
[37:56] surely they are disquieted in vain
[38:00] he heapeth up riches
[38:03] and knoweth not who shall gather them.
[38:14] and now lord what wait i for my hope
[38:19] is in thee
[38:26] deliver me from all my transgressions
[38:30] make me not the reproach of the foolish
[38:34] libra
[38:39] david said
[38:40] i was dumb
[38:42] i opened not my mouth
[38:44] because
[38:51] remove
[38:53] thy stroke
[38:54] away from me
[38:56] i am consumed by the blow
[38:59] of thine hand
[39:05] when thou with rebukes does correct men
[39:09] for iniquity
[39:11] they'll make us his beauty to consume
[39:13] away like a moth
[39:16] surely every man is vanity con castillos
[39:26] just two more verses
[39:29] hear my prayer o lord
[39:31] and give ear unto my cry
[39:34] hold not thy peace at my tears
[39:38] for i am a stranger with thee
[39:41] and a sojourner
[39:43] as all my fathers were oh
[39:46] no yes
[39:54] now this is david in verse 13.
[39:58] oh spare me
[40:00] that i may recover
[40:01] strength

[41:22] fisherman or fisher women

[41:32] and they're so happy
[41:34] but i want to say tonight to you
[41:38] you have been netted by god
[41:44] you are his trophy ustedes
[42:00] you are god's trophy
[42:04] i told you i was going to preach for my
[42:06] heart
[42:08] we believe jesus christ is in this room
[42:11] right now
[42:14] the same angel that was with william
[42:16] branham
[42:18] tabernacle tonight
[42:22] it's the holy ghost
[42:24] it's the answer to your prayers
[42:28] it's the groaning of your heart
[42:32] it's what david said
[42:35] oh spare me
[42:37] that i may recover strength
[42:40] how many has ever been weary before
[42:56] that is god capturing you
[43:01] see you're made you want to run free and
[43:03] you want to do your own thing
[43:09] but god has caught you
[43:23] but you are a prisoner of love
[43:28] [Music]
[43:39] we just love to be in his presence
[43:42] we just love his word
[43:45] so captured by recovery
[43:49] recovery is when
[43:53] you retrieve something
[43:57] you bring it back to your possession
[44:02] you regain it
[44:05] you rescue it lord
[44:15] it means that you have improved you
[44:18] you are mended as significant

[45:12] hallelujah
[45:15] brother branham in 1965 in california
[45:20] in california preaching modern events
[45:23] made clear by prophecy
[45:28] he said you can ever be so sincere is
[45:43] he said come back into the word of god
[45:46] elise
[45:48] and get lined up
[45:50] and then go illogovaya like a soldier
[45:54] doesn't know what to do
[45:57] until he gets orders to do it
[46:02] we must be christian soldiers
[46:05] christians and get orders from the bible
[46:10] for this hour now
[46:14] [Music]
[46:25] but the
[46:26] charge of today
[46:29] which way we go
[46:32] and find out the hour that we're living
[46:35] in
[46:37] now this isn't always easy
[46:41] i think this church has found that out
[46:43] in the last two years
[46:47] it's easy to just keep going down the
[46:50] road
[46:52] but when men and women desire a chain
[46:56] lost
[46:58] and when there's a thirst inside of them
[47:02] and when there's burdens
[47:04] and then when there's a groaning economy
[47:06] you have to respond to that deep
[47:36] but god can give us the saith the lord
[47:40] i see jesus
[47:46] he said but we have patience
[47:49] the prophecies that's been promised
[47:53] [Music]
[47:59] [Music]
[48:07] you have calendars
[48:09] you look at a calendar to find what day
[48:11] of the year you're living in just
[48:18] and you look at god's bible you say mira
[48:20] la bibla to see what age that we're
[48:22] living in
[48:24] are we living in the last stage
[48:28] are we living in the last days
[48:31] we've received the last prophet
[48:35] we don't need an eighth messenger no
[48:38] vamos ajero octavo christ has already
[48:40] delivered the word chris
[48:43] hallelujah
[48:44] we just need to believe that words
[48:59] stop letting men's uh opinions and
[49:03] just because they're older don't make
[49:05] them wiser
[49:10] the mind of the lord for now
[49:14] lamented
[49:28] bringing god bringing back to god
[49:36] that he promised to bring it back in
[49:40] he promised to do it
[49:45] now did you all enjoy your camp meetings
[49:46] that you just had this
[49:51] fruit
[49:52] you know god gives us times of
[49:54] refreshing
[50:00] [Music]
[50:06] he gives you courage
[50:09] to go on
[50:38] i believe it with all of my heart
[50:41] now tonight esta

[55:27] you've been captured by healing
[55:33] god heals the osana
[55:36] you've been captured by healing we say
[55:41] that means you have been caught by that
[55:43] significa

[55:58] so you've been arrested by the helper
[56:00] aura
[56:08] he was captured by a prepared fish
[56:15] jonah 117.
[56:18] i think our brothers can put that on the
[56:20] screen
[56:22] jonah 1 17.
[56:25] now the lord had prepared a great fish
[56:35] and jonah was in the belly of the fish
[56:40] three days tres diaz and three nights
[56:45] would you agree tonight
[56:48] jonah
[56:49] was captured
[56:52] he couldn't go nowhere
[56:56] have you ever been in the belly of a
[56:58] whale honest
[57:02] how did he breathe down there
[57:05] was there light switches down there
[57:10] was there food down there
[57:13] there was vomit down there
[57:18] could he read the bible or anything
[57:19] brother oh i don't know you don't know
[57:24] it wasn't a it wasn't a fun three days

[57:38] in the belly of a great whale
[57:42] probably gasping
[57:46] he was captured
[57:48] captured by a prepared fish
[57:53] and that might sound like it's on the
[57:55] negative
[57:58] negative
[57:59] but as jonah was in the belly of the
[58:01] whales
[58:04] so jesus was going to be in the tomb
[58:33] his mercy just surrounds me
[58:38] god's grace is sufficient for me

[1:06:35] heaven without coffee
[1:06:43] it might surprise some of you you might
[1:06:44] have chocolate in heaven
[1:06:49] but you know what it really doesn't
[1:06:50] matter
[1:06:52] if we're there
[1:06:54] whatever it's going to be like it's
[1:06:55] going to be wonderful
[1:06:59] so ask your pastor if there's going to
[1:07:01] be chocolate in heaven
[1:07:05] maybe the lord will give him a vision or
[1:07:06] a dreamer
[1:07:10] isn't that wonderful
[1:07:12] you're
[1:07:17] a brother john alfredo is in a new body

[1:07:39] stop praying for me to be 200 years

[1:08:03] they captured
[1:08:06] they captured a flower a trap
[1:08:18] captured by a new body captured

[1:08:25] open sour of what it takes
[1:08:28] how long it takes for a believer to
[1:08:30] recover quanto tiempos
[1:08:33] from things that happen in their lives
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:52] you know we want it to happen
[1:08:53] immediately
[1:08:56] we want it to happen quickly
[1:09:00] and i believe we serve a god of miracles
[1:09:04] but you know there's other times
[1:09:09] there's something called a healing
[1:09:13] and healing takes time
[1:09:17] and that takes a season yes
[1:09:32] are you willing to take a healing estas
[1:09:38] i told you i was going to preach from my
[1:09:40] heart
[1:09:43] you know we want it over now
[1:09:46] we want a miracle
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:45] i mean most churches are canceling
[1:10:47] sunday night services
[1:10:52] it's a miracle that you even want to be
[1:10:54] here
[1:10:55] quiet
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:09] if god allows a healing to take place
[1:11:15] it's called a season of recovery
[1:11:20] if your attitude would be the same
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:27] can you put psalms 39 verse 13
[1:11:30] up on the screen again
[1:11:35] psalms 39
[1:11:37] verse 13 salmon
[1:11:41] david said oh spare me
[1:11:45] that i may recover
[1:11:47] strength

[1:13:38] all the time
[1:13:41] are we supposed to shake our face like
[1:13:43] this to the sun is
[1:13:58] captured by the words

[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:01] god is interested in
[1:16:10] it's not good enough just to hear it
[1:16:13] it's not good enough just to say amen to
[1:16:15] it

[1:16:33] god cares for me
[1:16:35] to me god has given me mercy
[1:16:39] god has forgiven my sins
[1:16:43] i'm not troubled

[1:17:39] but being raised in the message
[1:17:44] a teenager
[1:17:46] she reached a time of great depression
[1:17:48] in her life
[1:17:52] she even told us a few weeks ago
[1:17:56] she
[1:18:09] and in that awkward time of teenage life

[1:18:24] trying to take your life
[1:18:26] trying to bring attention
[1:18:30] i sat with her a few weeks ago with my

[1:19:21] heart to the lord
[1:19:25] she wanted to praise the lord
[1:19:28] she wanted to thank the lord
[1:19:30] but she was so embarrassed
[1:19:34] because of these scars
[1:19:39] from when satan was trying to capture
[1:19:42] her cuandos
[1:19:44] and how she had cut herself
[1:19:47] there were scars all up her arms

[1:20:10] the years of embarrassment not in savvy
