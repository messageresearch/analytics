[18:55] i'll greet you in the name of the lord
[18:57] jesus christ this evening
[19:02] it is an honor and privilege to be here
[19:04] once again
[19:10] more with the little bit of nerves as
[19:11] always
[19:16] i think brother manuel's probably
[19:17] getting tired of me saying that all the
[19:18] time
[19:40] you know i don't know how you guys have
[19:43] felt
[19:43] over these last two friday services
[19:50] but i've been rejoicing plenty these
[19:52] last two fridays
[19:57] to be able to hear our brother uh gomez
[20:03] a testimony that i could not have ever
[20:06] guessed he went through in his life
[20:12] but you can tell through the words that
[20:14] he was expressing
[20:19] that something has really happened in
[20:20] his life
[20:24] another example like what we try to tell
[20:27] you young people all the time
[20:32] of how it is that you don't need to go
[20:34] out into the world
[20:38] because you come back with those scars
[20:40] and those wounds
[20:45] and those memories that torment you and
[20:47] haunts you yes
[20:51] when the majority of you are like me
[20:56] that were born in a church in this
[20:57] message
[21:00] where we are already in god's family
[21:06] we've been dedicated to the lord
[21:09] that we are awaiting that promise that
[21:11] our parents have been praying upon our
[21:12] lives
[21:20] and then we heard an amazing preaching
[21:22] from my brother
[21:27] what better than to go back to the
[21:29] basics for the young people
[21:34] something i didn't know them the brother
[21:36] grew up as a catholic
[21:40] and even as a catholic raised
[21:55] he was able to open it up and take it
[21:57] step by step for every one of you young
[21:59] people
[22:02] that we might know how to truly pray to
[22:05] god
[22:07] how to truly ask something of god
[22:12] so that in that manner we can actually
[22:14] receive from god
[22:18] and i hope the young people took those
[22:20] notes and they've been applying that
[22:22] prayer in their lives
[22:30] i want to enter into the book of first
[22:32] john chapter 2.
[22:37] and we're going to be reading from verse
[22:39] 1 to verse 5.
[22:45] when you have it in your bibles if you
[22:47] say amen
[22:51] amen first john chapter 2 verse 1 reads
[22:59] my little children these things write i
[23:02] unto you that ye sin not
[23:04] and if any man sinned we have an
[23:06] advocate with the father
[23:07] jesus christ the righteousness
[23:20] and he is the propitiation for our sins
[23:23] and not
[23:23] for ours only but also for the sins of
[23:26] the whole world
[23:36] and hereby we do know that we know him
[23:39] if we keep his commandments
[23:46] he that saith i know him and keepeth not
[23:48] his commandments is a liar
[23:51] and the truth is not in him
[23:59] but whoso keepeth his word in him verily
[24:02] is the love of god perfected
[24:04] whereby know we that we are in him
[24:16] we bow our heads for word of prayer
[24:19] lord heavenly father we thank you lord
[24:21] jesus for another opportunity to be here
[24:23] once again
[24:29] where you give us that desire to want to
[24:31] come to service to hear of your word
[24:33] once more
[24:38] and the you still provide a place of
[24:40] worship and a place to hear of your word
[24:44] lord
[24:46] this evening these short words that are
[24:48] going to be spoken tonight
[24:53] i asked lord that you would quicken the
[24:55] content for the young people of this
[24:58] tabernacle
[25:02] and for any young person that might be
[25:04] watching via the internet as well
[25:09] all we want father is for the young
[25:11] people to know you more
[25:22] and that they could reach that new birth
[25:24] and get that seal in their lives father
[25:30] whatever stage these young people find
[25:32] themselves in tonight
[25:38] that you might speak to them according
[25:39] to their maturity
[25:45] [Music]
[25:55] we give you all the honor and glory
[25:58] glory
[25:58] we thank you for the reading of the word
[26:02] we ask it all in the name of the lord
[26:04] jesus christ
[26:07] amen you may be seated
[26:14] uh to give this message a title i just
[26:16] wanted to title it
[26:17] a simple one word title the word sealed
[26:22] uh
[26:26] and and as we go on into the message
[26:28] it'll start to make more sense for you
[26:35] as i was reading these five scriptures
[26:36] to myself
[26:41] i see words that i kind of don't
[26:43] understand
[26:46] and i've heard the word propitiation so
[26:48] many times
[26:52] and i have somewhat of a definition or
[26:54] christian understanding of it
[26:59] but i wanted to know the exact
[27:00] definition of this word propitiation
[27:03] definition of so if a young person
[27:06] tonight doesn't know here's the
[27:08] definition
[27:12] propitiation is the act of gaining or
[27:15] regaining
[27:16] the favor or good will of someone or
[27:19] something
[27:26] it is appeasement
[27:29] it's something that propitiates or
[27:32] appeases
[27:35] and the final definition for it ultimate
[27:37] definition
[27:38] the dictionary says it's an atoning
[27:40] sacrifice
[27:44] so when we read when we read the
[27:46] scripture that says and he is the
[27:47] propitiation for our sins
[27:53] for me i take it that is him regaining
[27:56] that favor with god for us
[28:17] it says that those that know him keep
[28:19] his commandments
[28:24] we have the old testament commandments
[28:33] and then we have the new testament
[28:37] where it's not that the law is erased
[28:38] and we can now be murderers and liars
[28:41] and thieves
[29:01] we were able to provide a sacrifice when
[29:03] we couldn't fulfill the law
[29:08] but now we have the perfect sacrifice
[29:13] that bloodshed on calvary
[29:17] where we can now through that grace
[29:18] through that new birth through that holy
[29:20] spirit
[29:48] and young people we know plain and
[29:49] simple that jesus christ is the way the
[29:51] truth and the life is
[30:04] because you cannot keep his commandments
[30:09] but then going into verse 5.
[30:16] the love of god is now perfected in him
[30:22] and we know then therefore we know that
[30:24] we are in him
[30:27] now the bible says that god is love
[30:30] and when we look at the stature of a
[30:32] perfect man
[30:45] so in us keeping his word young people
[30:48] nosotros
[31:08] but it's not something instant then now
[31:10] you're just giving that love
[31:14] but if that perfection of that love is
[31:16] taking place in you
[31:18] perfection
[31:21] then it's got to graduate from step to
[31:24] step to step
[31:25] it is going from faith graduating into
[31:29] virtue
[31:30] the
[31:44] one step at a time
[31:48] until you reach that seal of that
[31:50] perfect love of god
[31:54] one being perfected into the other one
[31:57] faith being perfected all the way into
[31:59] love
[32:03] and so i i went into that same scripture
[32:05] and i wanted to look up another
[32:06] definition
[32:09] and i looked up the word perfected
[32:13] and i know the definition in our modern
[32:16] dictionary
[32:16] yo definition but i got curious it went
[32:20] into the concordance
[32:24] and i pulled up the greek definition of
[32:26] that word perfected
[32:31] and it says to complete
[32:34] in a literal form
[32:38] to accomplish in a figurative form
[32:44] to consummate in a characteristical form
[32:50] to consecrate and to finish and to
[32:53] fulfill
[32:54] the consequ complete make
[32:57] perfect i said perfecto i i don't know
[33:00] for me i
[33:01] barely graduated high school
[33:06] honestly i cheated my way through 11th
[33:08] and 12th grade of high school
[33:30] so when i look at definitions and things
[33:32] like this
[33:36] they help me really understand what it
[33:37] is that i'm reading
[33:42] i i sometimes feel like my brother
[33:44] emmanuel
[33:46] manuel that can take things and
[33:47] understand them so easily
[33:49] las puede
[33:52] how they process in his brain so
[33:54] smoothly
[33:58] but i'm starting to learn to love this
[33:59] word more and more and more
[34:03] and i hope the young people you are
[34:04] starting to love this word more
[34:06] and more and more especially
[34:11] so then therefore then it is that you
[34:13] know him
[34:16] when the word has made an impact in your
[34:18] life young people
[34:22] and then your heart is opened up to him
[34:26] it's very simple you realize and
[34:27] something clicked that jesus christ is
[34:29] the savior
[34:39] and then once that love has now been
[34:41] perfected in you
[34:44] once time has taken its course
[35:00] you've now been now converted unto this
[35:02] gospel
[35:05] and you can truly say that now you know
[35:07] that you are in him
[35:11] like it says in the scriptures in john
[35:13] 14 20
[35:27] the revelation day el dia
[35:42] that
[36:00] once again kind of repeating and nailing
[36:02] down the opening scriptures we took
[36:04] uh
[36:07] he that hath my commandments and that
[36:10] keepeth
[36:26] and i will manifest myself to him
[36:30] once again i had to jump into another
[36:32] definition
[36:35] and i took the word manifest
[36:38] and i went once again to that
[36:39] concordance
[36:42] and the greek definition of that word
[36:43] manifest
[36:47] it says to exhibit in person
[36:52] persona so to disclose by words
[36:58] to appear or declare plainly
[37:01] and informed
[37:06] so the lord here wanting to manifest
[37:08] himself to you young people
[37:14] so he wants to exhibit himself to you
[37:18] show himself to you in person
[37:27] he wants to disclose himself and
[37:29] everything about him to you
[37:45] and it says in the greek definition it
[37:47] is a different definition
[37:49] that plainly clara he just wants to
[37:52] appear
[37:52] declare and inform himself to you
[37:58] so let us keep those commandments
[38:02] you need love in your life just
[38:05] keep those commandments the lord will
[38:08] give you of that love
[38:10] he wants to give you of that love
[38:13] so now to enter into the message
[38:21] you know our duty is to immediately go
[38:23] and confess that wrong that we've done
[38:25] immediately
[38:29] if we sinned against god
[38:58] let him know what i did what happened
[39:02] and confess and get that off of our
[39:04] chest
[39:07] and then it's god's duty that by the
[39:08] blood of jesus he erases those sins
[39:19] but i know it's a little more difficult
[39:21] to actually follow through and do it
[39:26] now everyone here that has been called
[39:28] of god
[39:31] the moment that you were called of him
[39:36] he had that appointment in your life
[39:40] we had to
[39:49] you know what i don't want nothing to do
[39:51] with this
[39:53] but those of us that answered and said
[39:54] yes that's
[40:22] and that need that we needed in our
[40:23] lives
[40:26] is that we need a savior
[40:29] salvador because we are sinners
[40:34] liars we're worthy of hell somos dinos
[40:38] worthy of death that's why we needed a
[40:41] savior
[40:43] salvador but then you continue to walk
[40:45] in your walk
[40:48] and these things keep getting in your
[40:49] way yes
[41:04] you already answered to him you already
[41:06] accepted the lamb you applied the blood
[41:08] yeah
[41:10] but yet we stumble and we fall
[41:15] but god sees that effort that you're
[41:17] making
[41:18] is god sees you waking up each and every
[41:21] day young person
[41:24] he sees the motive and the objective in
[41:26] your heart
[41:29] and what your true desires are in your
[41:32] heart
[41:46] and through those tests and through that
[41:47] trine
[41:50] there he's going to find the place in
[41:52] the time where he's going to approve
[41:53] your faith
[41:59] and now we all seek approval today
[42:07] in some way shape or form we're looking
[42:09] for approval from somebody
[42:12] else whether it's from mama or papa
[42:18] papa the pastor the minister
[42:21] your boss at work or your husband or
[42:23] your wife
[42:26] we try to find that approval from
[42:28] somebody about the things we're
[42:30] doing the way we're living
[42:34] but now someone's got to be that great
[42:36] inspector
[42:38] is a grand inspector someone's got to
[42:40] give that final approval in your life
[42:56] the one that's
[43:11] applied and he he uses that type to talk
[43:13] about us
[43:16] how does it this boxcar it gets filled
[43:18] up with things
[43:21] and then it needs to be secured and tied
[43:24] down
[43:38] and then it needs to be sealed
[43:41] and then it's sent off to its final
[43:43] destination
[43:45] and when brother branham is explaining
[43:46] this
[43:49] he uses the scripture in ephesians 4 30.
[43:53] where the word says grieve not the holy
[43:55] spirit
[43:58] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[44:00] your redemption
[44:04] so we have our ups and we have our
[44:06] downstream
[44:22] i don't know what state you're in no
[44:24] saying i don't know your personal life
[44:27] but if you identify and just
[44:31] apply the word to your life
[44:34] we
[44:38] and i don't know where you're standing
[44:41] and where you're personally standing at
[44:43] in your life
[44:47] and whether young or old
[44:58] if you're not sealed yet then it's time
[45:01] for you to get that ceiling
[45:15] think it's nice and secure and ready to
[45:16] go on his journey
[45:19] but the great inspector's coming yeah
[45:22] i'll get an inspector he's probably
[45:23] already came
[45:24] into your life and he sees that these
[45:27] things are just tossed everywhere
[45:32] put in its place and nice and neat and
[45:34] formal
[45:37] it's all loose it's shaking up today
[45:41] brother branham says that he makes you
[45:43] tear it all up
[45:51] and you've got to refill it back up
[45:55] brother branham says that we go from
[45:57] revival to revival this is
[46:27] and as i'm i'm reading this right here
[46:30] it just made me think he said brother
[46:32] you know what i got a revelation
[46:36] it's so funny i'm seeing how so many of
[46:38] my plants and my my
[46:39] vegetables have died on me
[46:47] but i noticed one thing i water my
[46:49] plants all the time
[46:54] but instead of providing just a small
[46:56] drip of water
[47:00] and keeping it constantly fed constantly
[47:05] constantly constantly rich with the
[47:09] nutrients that it needs
[47:10] constantly
[47:14] instead i just drown it with the revival
[47:16] of water
[47:20] and then i let it die out for a week and
[47:22] i drown it against
[47:24] again with the revival of water
[47:30] that's what brother branham's talking
[47:31] about here is we fix it up and we get
[47:34] ready and we're in that revival
[47:36] system
[48:05] but when you once you really got packed
[48:07] in peru
[48:10] and god's spirit has the right of way
[48:15] and you've become a child of god
[48:26] and the door cannot be opened up until
[48:29] its destination
[48:44] we are sealed by the holy ghost someone
[48:46] say hello
[48:59] without a honest sincerity
[49:04] where your heart is so i'm humbled
[49:10] you're so open where you yourself are
[49:14] being so sincere to him
[49:18] we're there then he can provide that
[49:20] seal in your life
[49:23] and you young people you can deceive
[49:25] anybody that you want to use
[49:41] you're the first person that knows
[49:42] you're a
[49:53] and and i was just a walking liar
[49:55] day-to-day vivi la vida
[49:58] but we need to be honest with ourselves
[50:00] and honest with god
[50:05] so that that way we can be filled with
[50:07] him
[50:10] and you know it's a funny thing that
[50:12] once we've had that experience
[50:16] we're so filled with him in our hearts
[50:20] is that rejoicing that first love that
[50:22] you're in is
[50:30] you know some of us maybe have a larger
[50:31] family you want to go convert somebody
[50:34] familiar want to go preach to some
[50:37] friends to family members some cousins
[50:44] but the same thing applies to them like
[50:46] it applied to you
[50:50] god can't do absolutely nothing until
[51:16] where that's that moment where there
[51:18] needs to be a total surrenderance to god
[52:01] you want me to have this job lord let
[52:03] thy will be done
[52:06] you want me to this this and this let
[52:08] thy will be done
[52:12] very simple young people holiness is
[52:14] muslim to you but you need to be honest
[52:16] with yourselves first
[52:20] so now going back you may deceive the
[52:24] pastor
[52:27] you may deceive the ministers your
[52:28] parents like we said
[52:30] uh
[53:08] when god plays back your thoughts
[53:25] and ever since the little kid i always
[53:26] had this image it is
[53:30] we we have a movie theater in san diego
[53:32] that's a dome
[53:36] in san diego and it almost seems every
[53:39] direction you
[53:40] turn you're watching the movie
[53:47] and it's a museum and that's how they
[53:48] have their theater set up
[53:52] and it looks like the heaven is the
[53:54] movie being
[54:09] i feel like there's going to be no
[54:10] escape wherever you turn yo
[54:13] no importa you won't be able to escape
[54:17] but see
[54:17] that evilness that was in your heart
[54:44] that lust for those sinful things
[54:49] that's going to show on that day
[54:53] brother emmanuel doesn't see what i lost
[54:54] after hey novello
[54:57] i don't see what brother emmanuel loves
[54:58] afternoon
[55:02] but there's a hard drive up there that's
[55:03] recording every single
[55:18] but to me that perfect example
[55:21] that if we so much as just look upon a
[55:23] woman
[55:25] and just lust after her and we've
[55:28] already in that manner committed
[55:30] adultery with her
[55:31] manera yeah so young people i don't know
[55:35] the things that you lust after
[55:37] you know but anything
[55:41] whatever it is whatever sinful thing
[55:44] that's
[55:44] tormenting you in your heart
[56:00] and the lord knows
[56:03] so it's better to get right here
[56:08] than to have to confront it up there
[56:10] embezzy
[56:14] you know it's amazing science nowadays
[56:19] you know science says we have over 6 000
[56:22] thoughts
[56:22] in a day
[56:30] and the bible says that we are born in
[56:31] sin
[56:34] we speak lies we we're we're born in
[56:38] this
[56:38] hybrid nature
[56:41] we're evil natured
[56:46] so you young person knowing these things
[56:51] taking what science has said
[56:55] taking what the word of god has said
[56:59] and if we can put them together
[57:02] just think for yourself for you
[57:05] and your daily life
[57:08] out of those six thousand thoughts this
[57:24] you
[57:38] i think a lot more than half of those
[57:40] thoughts are evil then they are good
[57:46] because of the nature that were born in
[57:47] young people
[57:50] just think about it you go to sleep
[57:57] where you have no control over what
[57:59] you're going to dream about
[58:02] but yet i didn't make you dream that you
[58:05] know
[58:09] and sometimes there are these evil
[58:11] perverted dreams that you have
[58:17] those are your thoughts not my thoughts
[58:22] and without that change of nature
[58:26] without that holy spirit that can
[58:28] transform us
[58:31] the blood cannot be applied for not only
[58:33] our physical sins la
[58:35] sangre no solomente puedes replicato
[58:37] para nos respicados physics but it'll be
[58:39] applied for the thoughts of our mind and
[58:41] the thoughts of our heart
[58:46] i thank god for that
[59:16] and then god can look into you yeah
[59:20] god can check that box
[59:25] he can shake it up he can test it
[59:29] and then he'll approve that faith that
[59:31] you have
[59:34] and as you're crying and crying out to
[59:36] him
[59:39] asking him to give you that seal
[59:42] he can come down
[1:00:32] we mentioned about the steps of the new
[1:00:34] birth
[1:00:37] and we didn't get into it too deep
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:01:08] he mentions the new birth mensiona
[1:01:11] and then the fourth illogo el cuarto he
[1:01:14] says
[1:01:15] sealed so let's jump to sanctification
[1:01:21] sanctification is
[1:01:51] and in the process you might go through
[1:01:54] many experiences
[1:01:57] beautiful supernatural experiences maybe
[1:01:59] in a service just like tonight
[1:02:04] you might find
[1:02:20] and we're not taking that from you i'm
[1:02:23] doubting that that's happening
[1:02:26] but you're still not born again
[1:02:30] you're the same person it is
[1:03:00] first the father needs to look inside of
[1:03:02] you
[1:03:05] he's got to test what's there
[1:03:09] what you've got so far probably that way
[1:03:12] once he's done so
[1:03:14] now
[1:03:28] they'll be able to
[1:03:53] so now you all are walking in that same
[1:03:55] line alright
[1:04:10] la vida
[1:04:41] and you're now a new creature in christ
[1:04:45] now everything that the father asks of
[1:04:47] you
[1:04:50] now you do it and you do it willingly
[1:04:55] because you love him because you're
[1:04:58] keeping his commandments
[1:05:00] he lives in you and you and him are not
[1:05:03] one
[1:05:05] now if we look at the life of samson
[1:05:09] i i really love samson as a child common
[1:05:12] men
[1:05:13] because the way hollywood paints samson
[1:05:16] hollywood he's always been this big
[1:05:20] strong man
[1:05:24] you know as i see my brother peter here
[1:05:26] come on
[1:05:28] peter i think of samson as his big guy
[1:05:31] like
[1:05:31] brother robert rodriguez samson come on
[1:05:48] brother branham tells us it wasn't like
[1:05:50] that this is
[1:05:52] it might have been on the contrary the
[1:05:54] short scrawny insignificant guy
[1:06:01] devi but now it makes sense for me
[1:06:04] insignificant
[1:06:07] that's the only way god could show his
[1:06:08] power in his mind
[1:06:13] if the man was seven foot tall and full
[1:06:15] of muscles
[1:06:56] but there's something different about
[1:06:58] this one
[1:07:00] so here we have samson who had
[1:07:02] experience after experience after
[1:07:04] experience
[1:07:08] experience and the bible says and i'm
[1:07:09] gonna i'm gonna say it like the bible
[1:07:12] says
[1:07:14] that the spirit of the lord came down
[1:07:16] mightily upon him
[1:07:22] can you think about that young people
[1:07:25] the spirit of the lord didn't just come
[1:07:27] down upon him
[1:07:30] it didn't just fill him but it came down
[1:07:34] mightily upon him
[1:07:37] all of the holy spirit came within him
[1:07:50] that that spirit of the lord has come
[1:07:52] down mightily in this same sanctuary
[1:08:35] after victory after victory victoria
[1:08:40] all those things meant absolutely
[1:08:42] nothing
[1:08:44] significant because he sold his birth
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:49] he sold out that strength bendios
[1:08:52] he sold his christian inheritance for
[1:08:54] some fleshly pleasure
[1:08:56] cristiano uh
[1:09:00] but we know the story that samson was
[1:09:04] restored
[1:09:06] and he did die to himself
[1:09:10] but he died at the end of the road
[1:09:14] where one last time he said just once
[1:09:17] more lord
[1:09:20] can you fill me mightily with your holy
[1:09:22] spirit
[1:09:26] the power of god came down upon him
[1:09:31] and he paid the redemption price
[1:09:35] but he paid it with his own life and
[1:09:38] blood
[1:09:40] is angry and we don't have to be like
[1:09:42] that
[1:09:44] we don't need to wait till the end of
[1:09:46] the road row
[1:09:49] del camino you heard the testimony of
[1:09:51] our brother gomez
[1:09:54] you've heard plenty of testimonies of
[1:09:56] people here in church
[1:10:00] of the hard things that they had to go
[1:10:02] through
[1:10:05] you don't need to be redeemed back like
[1:10:07] that
[1:10:11] you can be redeemed tonight
[1:10:14] as good
[1:10:26] now if we jump over to the fourth step i
[1:10:28] want
[1:10:31] and we're going to start closing in a
[1:10:34] little bit
[1:10:37] brother bernie calls it sealed
[1:10:41] he also has the word tested
[1:10:44] and if we take the example of abraham
[1:10:48] that right before god could seal him
[1:10:53] he needed to be tested that's why he was
[1:10:56] told he was given that order
[1:11:00] go and sacrifice your son
[1:11:03] uh i don't know if that would fly with
[1:11:05] any one of us
[1:11:08] but god knew what he had in abraham
[1:11:10] produced
[1:11:13] i thank god that's not the test he's
[1:11:15] going to put upon me
[1:11:19] but at least i can see in the scriptures
[1:11:21] that if he were to
[1:11:24] jose i have one that's done it already
[1:11:29] and i want to be like my brother abraham
[1:11:33] and there he was he passed that test
[1:11:37] he took the knife he took his son he
[1:11:39] laid the sacrifice
[1:11:42] and he passed that test he got that seal
[1:11:46] that seal that cannot be broken
[1:11:50] that sealed it all the way into your
[1:11:52] destination
[1:11:55] and now i'm going to be uh if you all
[1:11:58] please stand
[1:12:00] we're going to be closing
[1:12:03] sometimes uh these things can be so
[1:12:06] simple
[1:12:20] you've been sanctified sanctification
[1:12:22] that's good kbn
[1:12:23] but the question i would ask
[1:12:27] is have you been tested
[1:12:30] and if the answer is yes
[1:12:33] well then have you passed the test
[1:12:37] and if the answer is no if no
[1:12:40] then you need to be tested again
[1:12:44] and test it again
[1:12:48] until you
[1:12:55] the question will be have you been
[1:12:56] sealed
[1:12:59] and if the answer is no then
[1:13:02] what is it that you're waiting for this
[1:13:04] evening
[1:13:06] if you know that god is here this
[1:13:07] evening
[1:13:10] and the holy spirit wants to come upon
[1:13:12] you mightily
[1:13:16] then
[1:13:28] he had to pay with his own life
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:12] if you've been living your life up to
[1:14:14] now and you haven't used that altar in
[1:14:15] the privacy of your home
[1:14:22] well we have an altar here for you
[1:14:23] tonight
[1:14:26] i'm not the one that didn't make you use
[1:14:28] that private altar
[1:14:33] but i have one here that you can use
[1:14:35] today
[1:14:38] where no one else has to see you
[1:14:53] and the perseverance that you've had
[1:14:58] and he can give you that seal
[1:15:02] no i could tell you about the kingdom
[1:15:05] i can testify about the kingdom
[1:15:08] i can point you to the kingdom
[1:15:12] and the pastor he guides the flock to
[1:15:14] the feet of jesus
[1:15:17] jesus he's the one that tries to point
[1:15:19] us to christ
[1:15:35] these youth services is
[1:15:47] where you'll never thirst again
[1:16:00] you might be thinking why do i keep
[1:16:01] doing these desires of the flesh
[1:16:07] why do i keep having these evil thoughts
[1:16:11] well you've only reached the border line
[1:16:15] from teresa you haven't crossed into the
[1:16:18] land
[1:16:26] and that's the worst place that you can
[1:16:28] be in yes
[1:16:32] the bible says that i'd rather you be a
[1:16:35] total sinner
[1:16:39] or a total saint santo complete
[1:16:42] instead of being half stepping in
[1:16:44] business
[1:16:45] having one foot in and one foot out
[1:16:49] being that make-believer manufacturer
[1:16:52] playing church pleasing mama or papa
[1:16:58] you know if we can only take the example
[1:17:01] of the israelites
[1:17:05] and do what they did right and not what
[1:17:06] they did wrong
[1:17:12] take that lamb apply that
[1:17:27] and they were dancing and rejoicing
[1:17:31] they were praising and they were singing
[1:17:34] and all of that for nothing
[1:17:38] because they weren't there yet
[1:17:42] they still had three more days to go
[1:17:46] but instead they followed their hearts
[1:17:49] they followed their thoughts they fell
[1:17:52] into unbelief
[1:17:55] they fell into their own doctrines
[1:18:24] it's god's obligation to give you the
[1:18:26] new birth
[1:18:27] obligation but it's your obligation to
[1:18:31] be honest and open your heart to him
[1:18:37] brother branham was asked
[1:18:40] brother branham and mano branham how
[1:18:42] long does it take to be born again
[1:18:48] what a question and what an answer
[1:18:52] is
[1:19:20] and father with all these youth present
[1:19:23] and those on line

[1:19:35] sanctification
[1:19:36] justification some have received their
[1:19:40] new birth and some are about to receive
[1:19:41] their new birth lord
[1:19:47] father i ask that you would look into
[1:19:49] them lord father
[1:19:53] and if you see a sincere heart father
[1:19:57] whether at this altar tonight
[1:20:02] or whether in the privacy of their altar
[1:20:04] at home in their bedroom father
[1:20:09] that your holy spirit would come down
[1:20:11] mightily upon them
[1:20:15] and that you can approve their faith
[1:20:17] lord
[1:20:20] that you can give them that seal
[1:20:23] and that they'll be really ready to make
[1:20:25] it to that final destination
