[51:40] amen and it says
[51:43] you shall not bow down yourself bow down
[51:46] yourself to them nor serve them for i
[51:49] the lord your god and i'm a jealous god
[51:52] visiting the iniquity of
[51:54] of the fathers upon the children to the
[51:56] third and fourth generation of them that
[51:59] hate me
[52:00] not inclined
[52:13] wow what a powerful thing god says
[52:18] i'll visit them and all the way to the
[52:20] third and fourth generations
[52:25] but then verse 6 says
[52:28] this is where our promise lies
[52:35] and showing mercy to thousands of them
[52:39] that love me and keep my commandments
[52:42] iago misericordia amigares alos
[52:51] to those that love me and keep my
[52:53] commandments
[52:56] amen let us bow our heads
[53:09] it's only by your grace we are here this
[53:11] morning father
[53:25] you pour your holy spirit down and you
[53:28] preach your word father that we may
[53:30] receive something from you
[53:37] lord we submit ourselves unto your holy
[53:39] spirit
[53:51] obedient to you this morning
[53:55] we want to give you the glory and the
[53:57] honor
[53:58] of the gloria la hondra the name of
[54:00] jesus christ we pray in the number of
[54:02] christian
[54:03] amen and amen amen
[54:05] amen you may be seated
[54:08] if you would like to turn with me to
[54:10] first peter 2 9.
[54:17] the bible says
[54:19] [Music]
[54:20] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[54:24] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[54:27] people that ye should show forth the
[54:30] praises of him who hath called you out
[54:33] of the darkness into his marvelous light
[54:49] exodus 20 is showing us something
[54:54] that god deals with his people through
[54:57] generations
[55:01] he dealt through adam's generations
[55:06] he dealt with abraham and his seed that
[55:09] would follow after him
[55:14] he even dealt with the serpent's
[55:16] generation or the serpent seeds
[55:28] but today he gives us a great promise
[55:43] there's a chosen generation that god has
[55:46] seen throughout
[55:59] no matter what last name we have no
[56:01] importa
[56:04] every single person can go into this
[56:06] chosen generation
[56:11] so when i talk about generations
[56:43] the bible says you are a peculiar people
[56:49] when god spoke to abraham
[56:53] he said you and your lineage i'm going
[56:55] to bless
[57:05] and god blessed them throughout
[57:08] the ages and throughout the
[57:09] dispensations
[57:24] inherited or inherit character
[57:27] significa
[57:31] or equality or just
[57:34] disposition through the inheritance
[57:40] amen amen a strain that's passed down
[57:46] now i'm going to try to take my time
[57:50] and just trust that the lord can bless
[57:51] us and give us what we need
[58:05] now we know what genes are we pass them
[58:07] throughout our family
[58:13] the father the mother get together and
[58:15] they have a child and the child has both
[58:17] mother and father's genes
[58:25] the word genes
[58:27] comes from the greek word genos
[58:32] and that's the same greek word
[58:47] so what is what is god saying whenever
[58:49] he calls his people a chosen generation
[58:56] he said you are a chosen race of people
[59:02] you are a chosen people with a certain
[59:05] gene in them
[59:10] you are a chosen generation
[59:14] and so we see throughout the whole
[59:16] entire bible
[59:19] that the the devil has tried to attack
[59:23] the seed or the gene of god
[59:28] we see the battle of the seeds
[59:39] saw that the daughters of men the
[59:42] daughters of cain the daughters of the
[59:43] serpent were fair
[59:56] and they begin to mix the genes or mix
[59:59] the seeds
[1:00:03] see
[1:00:04] god deals with generations god deals
[1:00:07] with people through their jeans
[1:00:26] genes
[1:00:28] the bible says he was of that wicked one
[1:00:33] and because of that he could never
[1:00:36] please the lord and he would continue to
[1:00:38] do evil in god's sight
[1:00:52] he was of the wicked one
[1:00:54] so god he blesses and he curses through
[1:00:58] generations
[1:01:02] that's that's what he said he said i
[1:01:04] will visit all the way to the third and
[1:01:06] fourth generation of those that hate me
[1:01:08] it is
[1:01:12] but those that love me and my
[1:01:13] commandments i will bless all down to
[1:01:16] the thousand generations
[1:01:25] so he goes and he blesses through
[1:01:27] generations
[1:01:31] and just as god blesses and curses
[1:01:34] through generations
[1:01:45] now if we go back to this present time
[1:01:48] go forward to this present time
[1:01:52] this generation is the worst generation
[1:01:55] we've seen
[1:01:59] because over generations and generations
[1:02:02] and generations
[1:02:15] all the way down coming down to this
[1:02:18] generation behind
[1:02:33] they don't even know where they come
[1:02:34] from anymore
[1:02:37] in the in the 1900s
[1:02:41] or the beginning of those 1900s 19 or
[1:02:44] when brother branham was here
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:00] they have completely rejected christ
[1:03:05] not just the message but they don't want
[1:03:07] nothing to do with christ or or anything
[1:03:10] to do with christianity
[1:03:14] or el christianismo they don't know who
[1:03:16] they are
[1:03:19] they don't know if they're male or
[1:03:20] female
[1:03:23] they are going back straight to the mud
[1:03:26] regression
[1:03:27] to where there is there is nothing that
[1:03:30] it's a gray generation
[1:03:35] many times brother pranam called uh the
[1:03:38] age that he was in a neurotic age muchas
[1:03:41] versus
[1:03:57] is neurotic
[1:04:00] why would he call people neurotic
[1:04:04] neurotic is is emotionally unstable
[1:04:07] neurotic
[1:04:09] emotional
[1:04:10] establishment
[1:04:24] juvenile delinquency
[1:04:27] he said it's parent delinquency
[1:04:32] some mothers have got away from their
[1:04:34] duties
[1:04:37] they want to run into the bar rooms and
[1:04:40] carry on
[1:04:44] and run all night and leave their
[1:04:46] children grow up
[1:04:52] no wonder they grow up in that neurotic
[1:04:55] age
[1:04:58] why because from generation to
[1:05:00] generation to generations
[1:05:05] we pass down those genes we passed down
[1:05:08] those characteristics
[1:05:14] and that generation will not stay the
[1:05:16] same as the one before yes
[1:05:34] this is what brother branham says
[1:05:37] i'm gonna quote a lot of um
[1:05:40] of my quotes from the message why are we
[1:05:42] not a denomination
[1:05:47] he says listen you young people today i
[1:05:50] don't know whether you come to this
[1:05:51] church or where you come from
[1:05:58] you young boys and girls
[1:06:01] did you realize the things that you are
[1:06:03] doing if there's another generation your
[1:06:06] children will be judged for what you do
[1:06:15] he says haven't you have no respect of
[1:06:17] decency
[1:06:21] you girls out there wearing those little
[1:06:23] old shorts and things around you know
[1:06:26] that's reflected on your daughter us
[1:06:41] did you know your grand mommy was a
[1:06:43] flapper
[1:06:55] and that's the reason you're a strip
[1:06:57] tease today yes
[1:07:08] yes sir god said he would visit the
[1:07:10] iniquity of the parents upon the
[1:07:12] children and their children to the three
[1:07:14] third and fourth generations
[1:07:23] so how i started to think when i read
[1:07:25] this
[1:07:26] condolences
[1:07:39] if the word says
[1:07:42] that i inherited
[1:07:44] a or adam's sin
[1:07:49] i inherited the sin of my father adam
[1:07:54] then i've inherited every single other
[1:07:57] person that's in my lineage
[1:08:02] i've inherited their sin also
[1:08:07] we are born
[1:08:10] there's a reason why jesus says you must
[1:08:13] you must be born again
[1:08:20] because we've inherited the dna of our
[1:08:24] fathers and our great great grandfathers
[1:08:26] and our great great grandfathers
[1:08:33] you know when i was younger
[1:08:36] i was
[1:08:51] whoever
[1:08:52] did way back hundreds of years
[1:08:58] it's coded into my dna
[1:09:02] it's coded into my genes
[1:09:15] oh well my my great great great great
[1:09:18] grandfather is pancho villa
[1:09:22] oh man you better be careful brother
[1:09:26] it's something to brag about but when
[1:09:27] you're a christian
[1:09:31] we have to be careful we need to
[1:09:47] brother branham said
[1:09:49] you know that he was a neurotic person
[1:09:55] he was a neurotic person
[1:09:57] he he said he had he had a temper
[1:10:03] once somebody called him a preacher and
[1:10:04] he was ready to to um
[1:10:07] knock him out
[1:10:12] now he says this
[1:10:14] is
[1:10:27] my father is strictly irishman
[1:10:33] my mother is harvey um only her her
[1:10:35] father married a cherokee indian my
[1:10:37] mother is harvey solomon
[1:10:42] and that broke the little line of the
[1:10:44] blood of irish yes
[1:10:49] and father and mother did not go to
[1:10:51] church
[1:10:53] this is the family he our prophet is
[1:11:01] now he said they didn't go to church
[1:11:03] they married out of a church and um they
[1:11:05] had no religion at all
[1:11:09] foreign
[1:11:12] back there in the mountains there was
[1:11:14] not even a catholic church
[1:11:19] so they come over in the early settlers
[1:11:22] two branhams come over entonces
[1:11:29] and sprung up the whole generation of
[1:11:32] branhams
[1:11:35] this the genealogy of the family is
[1:11:39] then he says in the message he careth
[1:11:41] for you
[1:11:45] i'm nervous
[1:11:49] i'm a nervous and upset person
[1:11:51] personally
[1:12:05] which would actually by birth make me
[1:12:26] he's he's
[1:12:27] not
[1:12:29] what god had him to do because of his
[1:12:31] bloodline
[1:13:00] but something had to happen to
[1:13:02] to
[1:13:04] awaken the siege gene of god
[1:13:10] because there was a gene of god before
[1:13:12] the foundation of the world
[1:13:16] that was
[1:13:28] but with the genealogy of the brahms he
[1:13:31] could not do that
[1:13:36] so sin and complexes are carried out
[1:13:39] through the generations
[1:13:57] depending on the life we live depending
[1:13:59] on
[1:14:01] that depending on what we do is passed
[1:14:04] down through generations
[1:14:10] that's why we see in the last day people
[1:14:11] with diabetes and with heart prone to
[1:14:14] heart attacks and strokes
[1:14:22] because all the good food we eat
[1:14:26] it's because all the the living we do
[1:14:29] all the whatever they lived back then
[1:14:34] well let's see what brother branham says
[1:14:37] branham i'm going to read a lot of
[1:14:38] quotes
[1:14:40] just so we can see what brother branham
[1:14:42] says
[1:14:44] he said and sickness is caused by sin
[1:14:52] it makes it very simple for us
[1:14:54] simplification that's right before we
[1:14:57] had before we had sin we had no sickness
[1:15:05] but sin or sickness is an attribute of
[1:15:08] sin pero el
[1:15:12] sickness came because sin maybe not what
[1:15:14] you've done but inherited it
[1:15:34] then he says in the message by in the
[1:15:36] message he swore by himself
[1:15:40] so what is the head and a cause of all
[1:15:43] that
[1:15:44] that were here this morning
[1:15:50] what's the head of all of it
[1:15:53] what made all the sickness and and sin
[1:15:55] and disgrace
[1:16:01] see before you had any sense sickness is
[1:16:03] an attribute
[1:16:13] you don't have no in other words in
[1:16:15] something
[1:16:16] it's something that come out of sin
[1:16:28] he begins to explain certain things here
[1:16:32] is
[1:16:45] where do we get our worries from
[1:16:54] amen amen
[1:16:55] he said no worries no nothing no
[1:16:58] no old age this
[1:17:15] it was perfect
[1:17:17] well what caused it was sin s-i-n
[1:17:23] then sickness followed sin
[1:17:28] broken homes attributes and moral
[1:17:29] livings and all those things followed
[1:17:31] sin
[1:17:37] if you kill sin
[1:17:40] now you've got to kill the attributes
[1:17:48] so sin sin sickness and sorrows broken
[1:17:52] homes all those things follow sin those
[1:17:54] are attributes of sin
[1:18:10] so you have to cut it at it's the source
[1:18:16] you can't fool with sin unless you're
[1:18:18] fooling with this
[1:18:22] and you fall in this the result
[1:18:38] already
[1:18:43] it's not just something that whenever we
[1:18:45] sin
[1:18:48] it just doesn't mean oh you sin now
[1:18:51] you're on the way to judgment or hell no
[1:18:54] significa
[1:18:58] that is the case
[1:19:00] because we break the law we have to face
[1:19:02] judgment
[1:19:06] but it's
[1:19:14] that it's just not a future tense of
[1:19:17] hell and judgment noise
[1:19:49] sickness sorrows broken homes
[1:19:58] the generations
[1:20:01] brother branham says this is you think
[1:20:04] cancer is something
[1:20:07] the bible said
[1:20:09] there is something
[1:20:10] there is a coming time when men will rot
[1:20:13] right in their flesh
[1:20:19] and buzzards will eat off of their
[1:20:21] carcasses before they even die
[1:20:27] cancer is a toothache to what is coming
[1:20:43] it's not the almighty hand of god
[1:20:45] causing these plagues of people
[1:20:51] but it's the sin
[1:20:54] and when the sin
[1:20:55] is here just like it is in this
[1:20:57] generation
[1:21:05] and it's going to be a greater sickness
[1:21:07] than we've ever seen
[1:21:11] that's why brother branham said
[1:21:41] itself within the dna of the people
[1:21:46] so when we're born
[1:21:48] were born in sickness and sorrows and
[1:21:51] sins
[1:21:57] that's what happens amen
[1:22:00] so it's
[1:22:04] now uh we we hear many times
[1:22:09] now there's a generation called baby
[1:22:11] boomers
[1:22:15] there's uh there's ones before that was
[1:22:18] called the greatest generation
[1:22:22] that was
[1:22:34] then you heard the baby boom generation
[1:22:37] or the baby boomers
[1:22:43] then generation x
[1:22:47] then millennials
[1:22:49] and then we all know gen z or generation
[1:22:52] z
[1:22:56] and you know when i'm working especially
[1:22:58] i used to work at a um
[1:23:00] at the mines
[1:23:18] but their work
[1:23:31] so the baby boomers they would say
[1:23:34] lost
[1:23:37] oh your generation is nothing but
[1:23:39] weaklings
[1:23:42] so the baby boomers would blame
[1:23:45] the genera generation
[1:24:00] blames the millennials for the the
[1:24:02] decline of their generation
[1:24:08] and now millennials are blaming gen z
[1:24:11] for the
[1:24:12] the decline of this generation now hour
[1:24:14] loss millennials
[1:24:26] uh women that don't do this or don't do
[1:24:28] that
[1:24:32] but brother where does the
[1:24:33] responsibility lie but
[1:24:36] responsibility the responsibility lies
[1:24:42] always
[1:24:47] to make sure the group of people or the
[1:24:49] group the next group of people are
[1:24:51] better off than they are
[1:24:55] uh
[1:25:21] so that generation can be passed on and
[1:25:24] passed on and passed on
[1:25:29] but there's a letting go somewhere in
[1:25:32] every single generation
[1:25:36] to where every generation will let go of
[1:25:39] something let go of christianity let go
[1:25:42] of god one way or another
[1:25:50] they wonder why
[1:25:52] why
[1:26:06] he was going to visit the iniquity of
[1:26:08] the fathers
[1:26:11] none of the next generation
[1:26:14] the sin we see now
[1:26:18] of the fathers
[1:26:21] he said i'm going to visit the iniquity
[1:26:23] of the fathers
[1:26:26] upon the children unto the third and
[1:26:29] fourth generation that hate me
[1:26:38] but just as the generations they degrade
[1:26:41] or they decline in this world we see
[1:26:43] entonces
[1:26:48] a
[1:27:16] no letting down know nothing serve the
[1:27:19] lord
[1:27:23] now in second timothy 1 5.
[1:27:30] you have paul talking to timothy
[1:27:35] second timothy 1 5 whenever you have it
[1:27:37] just go ahead and say amen
[1:27:43] he says elisa
[1:27:45] when i recall when i called to
[1:27:47] remembrance
[1:27:48] the unfade faith that is in thee
[1:27:51] so that faith where is it it's in
[1:27:53] timothy
[1:28:01] which dwelt first in thy grandmother
[1:28:04] lois
[1:28:08] and thy mother eunice
[1:28:12] and i
[1:28:25] generations and generations
[1:28:41] of the fathers and the mothers down to
[1:28:43] the children
[1:28:46] by default
[1:28:50] it has nothing to do with them being
[1:28:52] born again
[1:29:04] it was passed down to her daughter
[1:29:22] timothy still needed his own experience
[1:29:27] but how beautiful whatever
[1:29:30] he's
[1:29:31] raised in a righteous home
[1:29:36] also how brother branham said that or
[1:29:39] how the the word says that levi paid
[1:29:42] tithes through abraham
[1:29:47] that's beautiful
[1:29:49] he didn't
[1:29:51] only pay ties
[1:29:54] but his descendants also
[1:29:58] brother branham says this
[1:30:00] eston he says do you realize my brother
[1:30:05] that every time you do that which is
[1:30:07] right it'll be visited on your children
[1:30:17] let's take hebrews the seventh chapter
[1:30:22] the bible said when melchizedek met
[1:30:23] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:30:25] the kings
[1:30:30] and blessed him and it said now levi
[1:30:33] he's talking about paying tithes
[1:30:41] he said levi had an order from the lord
[1:30:44] to receive tithes from his brethren
[1:30:46] because
[1:30:50] and levi who received tithes paid ties
[1:30:53] for he was yet in the loins of abraham
[1:30:56] when he met melchizedek
[1:30:59] received
[1:31:05] and abraham was his great grandfather
[1:31:11] abraham begot isaac isaac begat jacob
[1:31:14] and jacob begot levi abrams
[1:31:21] levi father grandfather great
[1:31:23] grandfather levi
[1:31:25] abuelo
[1:31:27] well and while levi was in the loins of
[1:31:30] abraham the bible said he paid tithes
[1:31:33] hallelujah
[1:31:39] now he we skipped to the next paragraph
[1:31:41] and he says now the bible didn't say he
[1:31:45] potentially paid he potentially he paid
[1:31:49] it
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:57] the bible said he paid tithes when he
[1:31:59] was in a great his great grandfather's
[1:32:01] loin glory
[1:32:06] gloria now that's my lord oh he knowed
[1:32:09] even he noted even before the world was
[1:32:12] even formed
[1:32:17] he knowed everything and in abraham he
[1:32:20] paid ties
[1:32:24] that's beautiful so so now the actions
[1:32:28] of the fathers and the mothers
[1:32:33] affect
[1:32:34] the actions of the children
[1:32:38] affect the position of the children
[1:32:43] now now does this
[1:32:46] now
[1:32:46] we got to remember
[1:32:49] that brother branham didn't have a great
[1:32:51] lineage
[1:33:18] but whenever
[1:33:20] god can bless allenians
[1:33:24] it makes it easier for the children to
[1:33:28] turn to the lord
[1:33:33] why because the actions of the fathers
[1:33:35] and the mothers
[1:33:39] now there's a study that these uh the
[1:33:41] scientists have been
[1:33:43] discovered
[1:33:48] it's called epigenetics
[1:33:51] and epi means above genetics
[1:33:58] so we have our dna
[1:34:02] and we have our dna from our mother and
[1:34:04] our father
[1:34:07] and they they realize
[1:34:10] that
[1:34:11] your dna cannot be changed
[1:34:15] once your dna is it that's what it is
[1:34:21] so you have the dna of your father and
[1:34:23] you have the dna of your mother and then
[1:34:25] then you're born
[1:34:30] but they realize uh
[1:34:32] they discovered something tremendous
[1:34:37] it's called epigenetics
[1:34:40] to where your dna will not change
[1:34:44] but by the life that you live
[1:34:49] what you eat
[1:34:51] what you do
[1:34:53] the environment around you
[1:34:57] and your habits is
[1:35:10] but it changes the expression of the dna
[1:35:16] so you have strands in that dna
[1:35:22] and by the way you live yeah
[1:35:25] you can turn on and turn off different
[1:35:28] types of strands in your dna
[1:35:34] now that is tremendous
[1:35:38] because by the way we live
[1:35:58] brother branham his generations and his
[1:36:00] genes were were uh full of terrible
[1:36:03] people he said
[1:36:25] so that whenever he
[1:36:27] he had billy and he had joseph and he
[1:36:29] had rebecca and sarah
[1:36:31] abelia
[1:36:34] they were young well children
[1:36:43] the dna of being uh drunkards and and
[1:36:46] bunch of neurotics
[1:36:55] and sometimes we attach ourselves with
[1:36:57] our last name like oh man it's a cape of
[1:37:01] a superman cape
[1:37:19] all i'm doing is carrying that bloodline
[1:37:22] that would trace his back all the way to
[1:37:23] adam
[1:37:29] but it's it's the way i live
[1:37:43] if there was a family that abandoned you
[1:37:46] unfamiliar
[1:38:03] my dad and my grandpa and so and so all
[1:38:06] they were all like that and that's why
[1:38:08] i'm like this
[1:38:12] oh no we're we're stubborn by nature
[1:38:17] oh and we carry it
[1:38:21] we carry the stubbornness
[1:38:24] oh it runs in my family
[1:38:27] familia i'm this i'm
[1:38:38] so it doesn't have to be passed down to
[1:38:41] your children
[1:38:54] by receiving the holy ghost
[1:39:07] oh they were a bunch of adulterers all
[1:39:09] the way to me well you can
[1:39:51] they won't carry that that genetic gene
[1:39:54] or they will carry it but it'll be
[1:39:55] turned off
[1:40:00] because of the life you live
[1:40:04] it's a
[1:40:05] i i thank god for this grace
[1:40:09] because
[1:40:10] scientists are barely
[1:40:12] figuring out what god what god already
[1:40:14] knew from the beginning
[1:40:20] remember when whenever uh
[1:40:22] uh jacob's father-in-law
[1:40:27] whenever they made the deal and he said
[1:40:28] you know what i'll take the speckled and
[1:40:30] you take the solid colored ones uh
[1:40:49] goat would go and drink the water
[1:40:50] academy
[1:40:55] they changed their environment
[1:40:58] and whenever the goats begin to have
[1:41:00] more baby goats baby kids
[1:41:06] those goats begin to be spotted just
[1:41:09] like the other ones
[1:41:14] what was it changing the
[1:41:16] expression of the dna
[1:41:19] expression
[1:41:21] god has been doing this from the
[1:41:22] beginning
[1:41:26] creating and breaking cycles of
[1:41:28] generations
[1:41:32] you know one of the greatest ages that i
[1:41:35] see in the bible
[1:41:38] was the age when
[1:41:40] joshua took the children of israel on
[1:41:42] the other side to the canaan land
[1:41:48] for me that was one of the greatest
[1:41:50] generations
[1:41:54] you don't hear much of that generation
[1:42:10] finally they they've heard of the milk
[1:42:13] and honey they've heard of the goodness
[1:42:15] and now they are partaking in it
[1:42:23] this was the generation
[1:42:26] that walked out of the 40 years
[1:42:30] they saw the red sea open
[1:42:34] they saw they saw the the jordan river
[1:42:37] open
[1:42:40] they saw the giants fall to their feet
[1:42:45] they saw the great meteorites fall down
[1:42:48] and and kill every enemy that they have
[1:43:07] but
[1:43:08] if you'd like to turn with me to judges
[1:43:16] for me this is one of the greatest
[1:43:18] generations one of the greatest years
[1:43:20] that we see in the bible
[1:43:33] now this is
[1:43:35] joshua just passed away
[1:43:40] it says the joshua
[1:43:42] joshua the son of nun the servant of the
[1:43:44] lord died being a hundred and ten years
[1:43:46] old
[1:43:50] sir
[1:43:54] it says they buried him in the border
[1:43:56] border of his inheritance in the tim
[1:44:00] mathuras
[1:44:01] in the mount of uh ephraim on the
[1:44:04] on the north side of the hill of gash
[1:44:15] now
[1:44:16] listen to this part
[1:44:19] and also all that generation were
[1:44:22] gathered to their fathers
[1:44:24] and they
[1:44:26] there arose another generation after him
[1:44:29] which knew not the lord
[1:44:31] nor yet the works which he had done for
[1:44:35] israel
[1:44:46] via
[1:44:58] something happened after those that
[1:45:00] generation passed away
[1:45:05] one of the greatest generations in the
[1:45:07] bible
[1:45:10] they saw god fulfill his promise
[1:45:14] completely
[1:45:41] the baby boomers will blame millennials
[1:45:49] for how bad the generation
[1:45:56] is what happened to where they stopped
[1:45:59] listening
[1:46:03] to the word of the lord
[1:46:05] to where they kept saying come here son
[1:46:08] come here daughter
[1:46:11] let me tell you how it was when the
[1:46:14] jordan river opened up
[1:46:18] let me tell you how god saved me
[1:46:22] let me tell you how god gave me the holy
[1:46:25] ghost
[1:46:27] let me tell you how i saw joshua say sun
[1:46:30] stance
[1:46:35] and the sun stood still
[1:46:38] something foul something the the bars
[1:46:41] were dropped down somewhere algo de cayo
[1:46:44] in algon lugar to where the next
[1:46:46] generation they didn't know anything
[1:46:48] about the lord
[1:46:52] they didn't know
[1:47:00] something that really
[1:47:03] i wonder about
[1:47:06] what happened to the next generation to
[1:47:08] where they began they stopped preaching
[1:47:11] the words
[1:47:16] they stopped telling them of the works
[1:47:18] of god
[1:47:21] it was easy for the other generation to
[1:47:23] serve them
[1:47:26] because they saw brother bran or they
[1:47:28] saw joshua
[1:47:31] josue they saw the pillar of fire
[1:47:49] see the discernment of brother branagh
[1:47:53] they didn't see all those wonderful
[1:47:55] works
[1:47:58] and every generation someone drops the
[1:48:01] ball somebody lets the bars
[1:48:58] just the word
[1:49:11] but what
[1:49:12] happened there was a break in the cycle
[1:49:15] of generations
[1:49:20] through them to a 400-year
[1:49:23] loss
[1:49:37] the bible says
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:50:07] and we see that cycle all through the
[1:50:09] book of judges
[1:50:14] that's that's what happens when what we
[1:50:17] do with our generation
[1:50:22] now
[1:50:24] what i want to really go into before we
[1:50:27] close
[1:50:28] the terminal
[1:50:30] is the bible always
[1:50:33] says that the woman represents a church
[1:50:36] uh
[1:50:51] second adam and his bride the same
[1:50:53] commission
[1:50:58] he told the bride to multiply
[1:51:01] multiplication he told her to multiply
[1:51:04] and replenish the
[1:51:20] now this is what brother branham says
[1:51:22] and why we are not a denomination
[1:51:27] now what is she
[1:51:28] say
[1:51:29] w h o r e
[1:51:32] a
[1:51:46] something
[1:51:48] now who's who's brother man i'm talking
[1:51:50] to you i'm talking about the quinable
[1:51:52] branhams talking about the catholic
[1:51:54] church
[1:51:57] he says she begotten something
[1:52:00] a
[1:52:08] same thing as a w-h-o-r-e
[1:52:12] a moral woman asi como la misma costa
[1:52:26] that the bible talks about in revelation
[1:52:31] it says what made her immoral
[1:52:36] he says her doctrine
[1:52:39] what made her immoral
[1:52:42] her doctrine she was predented
[1:52:45] pretending to be a christian church but
[1:52:47] she was giving out man-made dogma
[1:52:51] pretending
[1:53:10] that's what made her commit adultery
[1:53:18] what's the act
[1:53:20] the doctrine
[1:53:21] by that
[1:53:22] false doctrine she bore children
[1:53:30] that's what made her immoral and that's
[1:53:31] what makes her a mother by her false
[1:53:33] doctrine and she bears children through
[1:53:35] it
[1:53:41] amen brother branham says on why we are
[1:53:44] not a denomination
[1:53:49] now there isn't a woman
[1:53:51] an honorary woman that is in this town
[1:53:53] but what could bring forth
[1:53:55] a virgin daughter
[1:53:57] existed
[1:54:03] she is when she is born now she can
[1:54:06] go
[1:54:15] her mother has been of that nature that
[1:54:18] girl nine times out of ten will act just
[1:54:21] exactly like her mother does this
[1:54:31] now you know that's right brother
[1:54:33] brethren says
[1:54:36] an old woman that runs out
[1:54:38] runs a house of ill fame
[1:54:43] could bring forth a
[1:54:46] bring forth a little girl
[1:54:50] she could be 16 years old just as clean
[1:54:53] and as moral as a lily
[1:54:56] says
[1:54:59] but if she remains that way
[1:55:03] but the thing is she does she goes right
[1:55:06] back and acts like her mother
[1:55:12] so it's how
[1:55:14] a church or
[1:55:16] raises the children
[1:55:21] and how do the children or how is the
[1:55:24] consummation of the the marriage how
[1:55:26] does it work
[1:55:42] it's because she picked up a false
[1:55:44] doctrine
[1:55:47] and what happens she begins to bear
[1:55:49] children through that false doctrine
[1:55:57] no matter how good that child is
[1:56:02] brother branham says nine
[1:56:04] times out of ten will go back to what
[1:56:06] the mother is
[1:56:09] versus
[1:56:12] that's why it's so important to stay
[1:56:14] with the word of the lord
[1:56:18] stay with the original doctrine of the
[1:56:21] lord
[1:56:24] it shouldn't be
[1:56:26] it shouldn't be
[1:56:28] well my church has this doctrine
[1:56:32] and this church has this doctrine
[1:56:35] no this church has the word of the lord
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:57:10] [Applause]
[1:57:20] it will not bring forth more harlots
[1:57:25] it will not bring forth more people that
[1:57:27] are passed down with with the nature of
[1:57:30] that woman
[1:57:34] it will be children of god
[1:57:39] amen now in closing
[1:57:42] brother branham
[1:57:43] this is in the ephesian church age um
[1:57:46] the church age book is
[1:57:52] now this is a long quote i pray that you
[1:57:54] bear with me
[1:57:58] he says nevertheless i have somewhat
[1:58:00] against thee
[1:58:03] revelations 2 4
[1:58:05] the spirit or jesus christ is talking to
[1:58:08] the ephesian church
[1:58:14] he says because thou has left the first
[1:58:17] love
[1:58:20] to understand this you must realize that
[1:58:22] the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:58:24] original saints of ephesus alone
[1:58:32] this message is to the entire age
[1:58:36] which lasted about 120 years
[1:58:44] it's message then
[1:58:45] oh man that just hit me hard
[1:58:51] so the ladies
[1:58:53] the lady will see a church age
[1:58:56] god wasn't just talking in brother
[1:58:58] branham's time
[1:59:28] where he says
[1:59:32] why because she has uh dropped uh he
[1:59:36] she's got herself naked
[1:59:40] she's left the word
[1:59:42] amen amen it's a message then and is all
[1:59:46] to generations in that span
[1:59:52] now history keeps repeating itself
[1:59:56] in the generations of israel we see a
[1:59:58] revival in one generation
[2:00:03] only to see the fires fading in the next
[2:00:07] quest
[2:00:10] in the third generations embers may be
[2:00:13] glowing slightly
[2:00:19] but in the fourth there may be no
[2:00:21] vestige whatsoever in the of that
[2:00:23] original flame
[2:00:39] it is simply the manifestation of the
[2:00:41] truth that god has no grandchildren
[2:00:48] salvation is not passed on by natural
[2:00:51] birth
[2:01:05] you start out truly with born-again
[2:01:07] believers
[2:01:11] and then the next generation comes along
[2:01:14] and they are no longer just plain
[2:01:16] christians
[2:01:20] but they have taken a denominational
[2:01:23] name now they are baptist methodists etc
[2:01:30] etc that is what exactly what they are
[2:01:33] to do
[2:01:34] what
[2:01:41] you have to be born of the will of god
[2:01:43] and not the will of man to be
[2:01:48] saved but these folks are all coming
[2:01:51] together now with the will of man
[2:01:57] i don't say that some of them aren't
[2:01:58] right with god
[2:02:02] not for a minute but i do say but the
[2:02:04] original fire has died down they are not
[2:02:07] the same anymore
[2:02:15] now we know churches bear children
[2:02:20] now i would love to
[2:02:22] allow us to wander and think
[2:02:26] what children are we bearing
[2:02:30] what children
[2:02:42] you know
[2:02:43] when there's a child of god
[2:02:47] that gives their heart to the lord
[2:02:50] they're justified
[2:02:55] the process of justification
[2:02:56] sanctification and baptism of the holy
[2:02:58] ghost
[2:03:03] is that the child is still in the womb
[2:03:08] water blood spirit
[2:03:12] and that child is in the process of
[2:03:14] being born
[2:03:17] so there's children
[2:03:20] they they did the study of
[2:03:23] epigenetics
[2:03:27] the ladies that
[2:03:28] went through the traumatic experience of
[2:03:31] 9 11.
[2:03:37] they
[2:03:38] got these women that went through this
[2:03:39] traumatic experience
[2:03:44] and they saw how they had ptsd they had
[2:03:47] stress they had a lot of traumas in
[2:03:50] their life because of that
[2:04:08] de trauma the same exact problems
[2:04:13] the same exact stresses as the mother
[2:04:15] that went through that traumatic
[2:04:16] experience
[2:04:21] experienced the traumatic why through
[2:04:23] epigenetics she expressed her dna a
[2:04:26] certain way
[2:04:31] and it was passed down to her children
[2:04:36] and the way that the church is the bride
[2:04:39] of jesus christ
[2:04:43] it is the way whenever children are
[2:04:45] being born of god through them
[2:05:15] those children are going to be born with
[2:05:17] those same things
[2:05:40] why those spiritual genetics pass down
[2:05:43] through that church
[2:05:46] is things where they let the bars down
[2:05:50] all those
[2:05:51] poor children that are being borne of
[2:05:52] god
[2:05:57] are receiving that thinking it's okay
[2:06:13] as the bride of jesus christ
[2:06:17] the children of a god will be born
[2:06:21] you know the devil in closing if you'd
[2:06:24] like to stand with me
[2:06:27] you know the devil tried to hit
[2:06:40] the seed in abraham's time and gave its
[2:06:42] time
[2:06:55] why because he remembered the promise
[2:06:57] god gave him
[2:07:01] he said there was going to be a siege
[2:07:06] that was going to stomp on his head
[2:07:11] he was going to destroy the devil's
[2:07:12] works
[2:07:15] so he tried to break down those
[2:07:17] generations
[2:07:21] but when jesus was born
[2:07:24] he wasn't born of the flesh of abraham
[2:07:27] or the blood of mary el nacio de la
[2:07:30] carne de abram or de la sangre de maria
[2:07:32] he broke that bloodline
[2:07:36] it was the blood of god
[2:07:49] he died for my father's sins
[2:07:53] he died for all my sins all the way down
[2:07:55] to adam
[2:07:59] he broke the head of the saiyans
[2:08:03] he crushed him
[2:08:05] and then
[2:08:06] whenever he re we receive the holy ghost
[2:08:11] we don't receive somebody else's blood
[2:08:15] we receive god's spirit
[2:08:19] we become children of
[2:08:31] every single person that is born again
[2:08:34] of his spirit
[2:08:47] my uncle well he was a pastor also
[2:08:51] no once i'm born again
[2:08:54] then i go into the eternal generation
[2:08:58] where god had his thoughts on me before
[2:09:01] the foundation of the world
[2:09:17] it doesn't matter because now i'm in the
[2:09:19] bloodline of jesus christ
[2:09:24] and now whenever we raise our children
[2:09:29] we're raising them with the holy
[2:09:41] that they won't take my bloodline
[2:09:43] anymore
[2:09:55] lord we accept you this morning
[2:10:13] parents complexes
[2:10:18] so i don't have to stay a victim of
[2:10:20] the abuse of my life
[2:10:25] lord that i don't have to say well
[2:10:27] because they were this i am this
[2:10:32] foreign i can accept your blood lord
[2:10:38] i can accept your righteousness
[2:10:50] that those habits that were passed down
[2:10:53] from generations
[2:11:07] that are holding them down
[2:11:19] that you break it down and take it down
[2:11:21] and give them your spirit lord jesus
