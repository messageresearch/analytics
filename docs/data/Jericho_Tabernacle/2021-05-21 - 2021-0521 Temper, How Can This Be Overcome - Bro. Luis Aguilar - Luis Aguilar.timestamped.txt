[23:31] amen amen amen god bless you this
[23:34] evening
[23:36] it's nice to see you all here in the
[23:38] house of the lord
[23:42] if you be so kind if you can uh open up
[23:45] your bibles with me to the book of
[23:48] philippians
[23:51] the fourth chapter and the third verse
[23:54] el capitan
[23:59] thirteen el beres
[24:04] says i can do all things through christ
[24:08] which strengthens me
[24:12] you may take your seats amen
[24:15] a very simple scripture
[24:20] that i can do all things through christ
[24:24] which strength strengthens me
[24:28] if i could place a little sub title for
[24:30] our
[24:31] message this evening
[24:36] i like to entitle it
[24:41] how can this be overcome
[24:48] i was studying a little bit i had the
[24:52] books of
[24:52] conduct order and doctrine from the
[24:54] prophet established
[24:58] liberals
[25:00] and in the books you go to the very back
[25:02] there has there's a bunch of uh
[25:05] things where the the context or the
[25:08] things where he's mentioning
[25:21] and there was one that said temper how
[25:23] can this be overcome
[25:26] yes
[25:28] and i felt like the lord was speaking to
[25:31] me right there
[25:34] in this moment so i begin to just
[25:37] look up the word temper
[25:40] temperament
[25:46] [Music]
[26:03] and so i begin to notice that well i
[26:05] guess we're not alone
[26:21] i don't feel like okay i'm the only one
[26:23] who has this problem
[26:24] [Music]
[26:27] and the first thing that i thought in my
[26:29] head
[26:31] is that i can do all things
[26:35] through christ increase i i feel like i
[26:38] feel like with this verse
[26:40] i feel like we just read part of the
[26:42] verse
[26:44] i think we just read i can do all things
[26:50] maybe that's how i've been reading it he
[26:52] says
[26:54] i can do all things and i stop right
[26:57] there
[26:58] can i think that's where uh i begin to
[27:01] think
[27:03] i can do all things i can do all things
[27:05] whatever i want i can do all things
[27:10] i can't no puedo because i didn't finish
[27:12] the whole verse
[27:15] it says i can do all things they say
[27:19] christ in christ not by myself no your
[27:23] solo but
[27:23] through christ who strengthens me
[27:27] and i think that if we can just take
[27:29] that right there
[27:32] i believe that that would be more than
[27:33] enough
[27:36] because it does take us
[27:39] whatever we have
[27:42] says that i can't do it for them lord
[27:44] this is
[28:01] but through christ and i think that's
[28:04] very awesome
[28:06] i said well no wonder i can't overcome
[28:09] this
[28:11] no wonder i can't overcome the other
[28:12] thing
[28:29] one of my favorite stories is moses
[28:35] bellerin says that's one of his favorite
[28:36] stories too
[28:40] that's an awesome story imagine
[28:45] finally israel is in egypt's bondage
[28:52] it all happened abraham
[28:55] isaac jacob avraham isaac jacob then
[28:58] joseph
[28:59] hello jose sold his brother
[29:02] joseph goes to egypt then finally the
[29:06] israelites just stay in egypt
[29:10] a pharaoh rises up that didn't know
[29:11] joseph
[29:15] they're a people captive
[29:18] and finally god raises up a little boy
[29:20] by moses by the name of moses
[30:19] and oh how he his work
[30:23] how he was a lawgiver
[30:27] went up up in the mountains it stayed
[30:29] for 40 days
[30:32] came back out with the law sally
[30:49] that that the priesthood must die pass
[30:51] away
[30:55] so we see here he goes under he goes to
[30:57] egypt
[31:00] he finally he he kills an egyptian after
[31:03] he grows up
[31:06] brother said he could have done it so
[31:08] easy god could have done it so easy
[31:13] but god is so very particular in the way
[31:16] he does things
[31:20] that he could have just easily made
[31:21] moses pharaoh
[31:28] and let the people of israel go
[31:30] deliberate
[31:44] but the thing is
[32:09] you just get mad as a little boy you
[32:11] imagine little baby moses getting thrown
[32:13] a fit with his mom
[32:14] says
[32:18] but that was his problem he was growing
[32:21] up
[32:22] he never smoked he never the bible never
[32:25] said he smoked
[33:08] in you than the sickness that you that's
[33:10] in your that you have in your body
[33:14] greater is the power of christ
[33:18] and that little besetting sin that you
[33:20] can overcome
[34:13] after moses uh god took him to the
[34:16] desert
[34:17] it a is
[34:20] story he led him to the desert
[34:24] there for 40 years ran into a small
[34:27] church of jethro's little flock
[34:32] iglesias
[34:47] what brother ram says you know us
[34:50] did you ever study that right close
[34:56] moses had a temper
[35:00] that finally kept them out of the
[35:02] promised land
[35:08] that kept them away from the promised
[35:10] land
[35:13] we see him as a wonderful experience
[35:16] that he had
[35:19] comes down from the mount comes down
[35:20] from the mountain
[35:22] space change ah god spoke to him
[35:27] said go out there to my people i
[35:29] remember i made a promise to them
[35:34] and then he started saying well if they
[35:36] don't believe you then
[35:38] i will back you up
[35:42] imagine how
[35:54] i want you to notice by this time he was
[35:56] already married
[36:09] i'm going to go out there to egypt
[36:12] and i'm going to go and deliver god's
[36:14] people
[36:18] he appeared to me in a burning bush
[36:21] indicated the commission i'm going to go
[36:32] you know the promise that god gave
[36:33] abraham
[36:36] uh that the circumcision circumcision
[36:39] that everyone has to be circumcised
[36:43] while your son needs to be circumcised
[36:49] do you think sephiroth said it like that
[36:50] piensa de que se foreign
[37:06] he was talking to god's prophet like
[37:09] that hey
[37:11] imagine moses came down from the from
[37:13] the mountain
[37:17] make something new food and pack it up
[37:19] with lunch because i'm going to go to
[37:20] egypt
[37:32] now my mind works very tremendously
[37:38] that the first bibles were written by
[37:41] moses
[37:44] now moses i i god i know god
[37:47] know what to write in the bible
[37:52] but maybe moses kind of left out some
[37:54] things
[37:57] how he didn't how he didn't talk to her
[38:02] he only
[38:44] moses
[38:49] so he finally goes out finally and as
[38:52] the journey went on
[38:55] says that finally kept him out of the
[38:57] promised land from
[39:03] and god had him sent back out there and
[39:05] gave him a little high-tempered wife too
[39:12] tremendous
[39:39] i bet they had some trouble on the back
[39:41] side of that desert
[39:48] in front of everybody what are you
[39:51] talking about
[39:53] we gotta go do this first
[39:57] oh man
[40:00] god knows how to tame you down
[40:06] hey man god knows how to tame you down
[40:11] so he fixed him back out there with the
[40:14] little woman
[40:18] he was instructed in egypt
[40:22] you know all this engineering work and
[40:25] what
[40:25] was everything else
[40:33] and that still wasn't enough to calm
[40:35] moses down
[40:47] he knew how to calm his prophet down el
[40:49] salvia como tranquiliza
[41:06] take that temper out of him
[41:09] he knew how to take moses temper out
[41:14] by his wife
[41:18] that's why you young man you young
[41:20] sisters
[41:22] you're really praying and praying
[41:26] and praying and praying when you get
[41:29] sick of praying
[41:31] he praying
[41:35] moses was a clean young man
[41:40] says the mother of moses
[41:44] molded his character
[42:28] and moses had a lot of temper
[42:32] that was his trouble i can just imagine
[42:35] things wasn't so peaceful back there in
[42:37] the backside of the desert
[42:53] [Music]
[42:56] maybe god's trying to tame you down a
[42:58] little okay
[43:02] you see so vice versa
[43:05] maybe it's the vice versa the young lady
[43:07] you're trying to get tamed down
[43:09] he says
[43:52] doing he's trying to school
[43:56] the man's mind
[44:00] what what god pro what what the program
[44:02] of god is
[44:05] trying to train moses
[44:12] he had to take things at his own home
[44:15] first
[44:19] he can't go out there and speak locus
[44:20] into existence
[44:25] showing what what the program of god was
[44:29] program says the only time in the bible
[44:46] so here is god is trying to show moses
[44:48] the program
[45:03] moses and his temper gets to him
[45:11] strikes the rock and he broke the
[45:15] program
[45:17] but god still had to back up moses
[45:21] because that was his prophet he couldn't
[45:24] just leave him alone like that
[45:27] but that was the only time in the bible
[45:58] where he married this
[46:09] so i guess there was some little trouble
[46:10] on the backside of theirs or once in a
[46:12] while
[46:12] does
[46:25] maybe that's your cross
[46:29] god might have given to kind of keep you
[46:31] lined up
[46:35] same thing with you women to your
[46:37] husbands
[46:40] stick together
[47:23] question it was uh and uh
[47:26] questions and answers you can find this
[47:29] i'm gonna have it right up here
[47:32] here's the here's here's the question
[47:35] brother branham
[47:36] and mano branham when someone gets on me
[47:40] steps on my toes but the ramp says this
[47:44] might be a good one
[47:47] steps on my toes as the old saying is
[47:51] come on my temper rises
[47:54] how can i overcome this thing i know the
[47:57] lord will have to do it
[48:01] what can i do in my heart
[48:16] listen to the answer the prophet of god
[48:18] gives no much
[48:32] mind i don't guess there's
[48:35] there's too many people in this building
[48:40] i ever had any more temper that i didn't
[48:42] begin with
[48:45] brother branham had a temper element and
[48:48] if you have something that you can't
[48:49] overcome
[48:52] if you're if you're something that
[48:54] little besetting sin that you have
[48:55] es
[48:59] temper is get
[49:15] get a pack of sugar
[49:21] same thing with you sweeten yourself up
[49:25] endure not everybody is trying to fight
[49:27] you brother no
[49:28] so
[49:41] he cut off one of the lights of a lady
[49:46] this lady came out and says you blabbery
[49:50] blappery blap
[49:53] and he says brother braham said if you
[49:55] would have told me that before i was
[50:11] that before i was a christian
[50:14] christian i would have said some things
[50:18] and hear what abram says i thought i can
[50:22] never be a christian
[50:35] he said i thought i could never become a
[50:37] christian the el dijon
[50:43] [Music]
[51:16] you know the evils the evils that i have
[51:18] done when i was a kid
[51:32] i almost killed five men at one time una
[51:37] took a rifle loaded with 16 shots
[51:42] and when they when them boys beat me
[51:44] because i was a kentuckian
[51:48] porque
[52:38] that mom took one of one of his dad's
[52:40] the the the coat that he got married
[52:46] and he took that jacket made a pair of
[52:50] pants for brother brandon
[52:53] so you can go to school for the first
[52:54] time
[52:56] and they will make fun of him sometimes
[52:59] you go to school without a shirt
[53:03] some overalls their days made fun of him
[53:07] and his temper would just
[53:08] build up
[53:13] and a couple of boys because i walked
[53:15] down the road
[53:16] muchachos was some little girl and
[53:20] packed her books
[53:23] libros so he better carry the books of
[53:25] this little girl
[54:08] i had a little 22 winchester rifle
[54:11] rifle winchester laying up over the door
[54:17] reached up and got that rifle full of
[54:19] bullets
[54:22] went right down
[55:01] that kentuckian will realize where he's
[55:04] at from this one
[55:06] kentucky
[55:09] going on like that i step
[55:12] up with the hammer pulled back the rifle
[55:18] i said now which one of you want to die
[55:21] first
[55:24] which one are you going to die first
[55:27] wow that's the prophet he didn't say
[55:30] who's the first one who wants to get
[55:32] baptized
[55:32] no who's the first one who wants to
[55:36] accept jesus christ
[55:39] who wants to die first
[55:43] so you won't watch the others
[56:15] talk about a man of his word
[56:18] and i meant it he said he tween said
[56:22] he was gonna kill these boys
[56:31] and i meant it and then just then they
[56:35] started squealing
[56:38] and i pull and snap
[56:42] the gun snapped
[56:57] shells on the ground
[57:01] every one of them snapped and the boys
[57:04] went
[57:04] running and screaming
[57:08] and diving over the hill and everything
[57:51] now that's a temper
[58:06] put it back in the rifle
[58:19] talk about grace
[58:23] talk about grace
[58:26] he's going to protect you
[58:29] he has such a temper you get so angry
[58:34] that
[58:46] [Music]

[1:00:44] the time
[1:00:47] god don't want you to be sad
[1:00:51] you know what ill temper does
[1:01:06] uh the 60 of the causes of all
[1:01:08] sicknesses
[1:01:16] about sixty percent of the sickness is
[1:01:18] caused by temperature
[1:02:32] and there you are getting sick and
[1:02:33] getting sick and getting sick
[1:02:37] and you have high blood pressure now you
[1:02:40] got
[1:02:40] diabetes you got something else diabetes
[1:02:43] yo
[1:02:44] because because of temper a causa del
[1:02:46] mar
[1:03:28] you might say brother i'm okay
[1:03:32] okay well put your little besetting
[1:03:34] scene
[1:03:36] and say settings
[1:03:40] how can this be overcome
[1:03:53] you have to recognize the devil in every
[1:03:55] one of his tricks
[1:04:10] i don't know what you understand what
[1:04:12] the prophet says
[1:04:16] i can place a quote right here we have
[1:04:19] five people
[1:04:21] every single one of us will understand
[1:04:22] in a different way
[1:04:40] that has already been conquered but
[1:04:42] brother branham tells me
[1:04:44] that the one that hasn't been conquered
[1:04:49] myself so that the greatest enemy i have
[1:05:06] the enemy the devil has been defeated
[1:05:10] by the bran says that's right this is
[1:05:12] like like all the old saints dead
[1:05:16] like jesus did midst of all of his
[1:05:20] enemies
[1:05:46] he's defeated it by surrendering himself
[1:05:51] he defeated it by surrendering himself
[1:05:57] why by the word you destroyed this
[1:06:01] temple and i raise it up in three days
[1:08:05] what the spirit says to the churches
[1:08:08] he that
[1:08:20] what the spirit says to the churches
[1:08:35] whatever you struggle with it doesn't
[1:08:38] matter what it is no important locations
[1:08:40] just lay it at the altar of god
[1:08:45] you struggle with your tongue
[1:08:49] you struggle with your eyes
[1:09:02] because you can't do all things
[1:09:06] but you can do all things just
[1:09:09] as long as it's through christ
[1:09:13] what a revelation that you can't do all
[1:09:16] things
[1:09:18] as long as it's with christ the holy
[1:09:21] spirit is right there
[1:09:22] yes the word is right there
[1:09:26] but you got to grab the holy spirit
[1:09:30] and let the holy spirit be the
[1:09:46] he can't
[1:10:02] but as long as you want it to be
[1:10:04] conquered
[1:10:06] the only one that gives the devil life
[1:10:10] the only one that gives temper lives
[1:10:14] and all these
[1:10:21] i gave them little little treats little
[1:10:22] snacks
[1:10:25] imagine you're there at the dinner table
[1:10:28] you got the white dog and you got the
[1:10:29] black dog

[1:10:35] dog

[1:10:41] the tapes
[1:10:56] let someone
