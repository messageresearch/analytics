[21:31] enough to be able to confess it is
[21:36] and to be able to correct the things
[21:39] that we need to to be ready for you
[21:43] help us in this evening
[21:46] we surrender ourselves unto you
[21:50] for we ask this part of the service
[21:54] and likewise the remaining of the
[21:56] service
[21:59] we ask it in the Blessed name of our
[22:02] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[22:10] just as you're standing I'm going to be
[22:12] reading two different parts of the
[22:13] scriptures
[22:16] the first one will be in Luke 23
[22:19] um
[22:21] and we'll start on verse 33.
[22:30] and in this part it speaks about the
[22:32] crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:36] and it says on verse 33 is
[22:48] and when they were come to the place
[22:51] which is called Calvary
[22:53] There They Crucified him and the male
[22:56] factors one on the right hand and on the
[22:59] other left is
[23:09] then said Jesus father forgive them for
[23:12] they know not what they do and they
[23:14] parted his Remnant and cast slots
[23:27] and the people stood beholding and the
[23:29] rulers also with them divided him
[23:32] saying he saved others let him save
[23:35] himself if he be Christ The Chosen of
[23:38] God
[23:44] and the soldiers also mocked him coming
[23:46] to him and offering him vinegar
[23:52] and saying if thou be the king of the
[23:54] Jews save thyself
[24:02] in a superscription also was written
[24:05] over him in letters of Greek in Latin
[24:07] and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews
[24:17] and one of the male factors which were
[24:20] hanged railed on him saying if thou be
[24:23] Christ save thyself in US
[24:33] but the other answering rebuked him
[24:35] saying does not thou fear God see in
[24:37] Thou Art in the same condemnation
[24:46] and we indeed just leave for we receive
[24:49] the due reward of our Deeds but this man
[24:51] had done nothing amiss
[24:58] Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh
[25:01] into thy kingdom Jesus
[25:05] and Jesus said unto him verily I say
[25:08] unto thee today shall thou be with me in
[25:11] paradise
[25:16] and it was about the sixth hour and
[25:18] there was a Darkness all over all the
[25:20] Earth until the ninth hour yes
[25:26] and the sun was darkened and the veil of
[25:28] the temple was ran in the myths
[25:31] in another scripture in the book of
[25:34] Hebrews
[25:39] from verse 19 to 22.
[25:42] this is Christo
[25:49] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[25:51] enter into the holiest of the blood of
[25:53] Jesus
[26:00] and Living Way which he has consecrated
[26:03] for us through the veil that is to say
[26:06] his flesh is
[26:10] and having a high priest over the house
[26:12] of God I said
[26:21] let us run here with the true heart and
[26:24] full Assurance of Faith having our
[26:26] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[26:28] and our bodies washed with pure water
[26:33] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[26:35] word you may be seated
[26:41] before we get started
[26:45] I wanted to give a missionary report
[26:51] in regards to the missionary trip that I
[26:53] had with our pastor brother ordonius
[26:58] and this past weekend me and him we went
[27:01] to the Mexico City
[27:06] and it was By Invitation of our brother
[27:08] Francisco olgin as soon as
[27:11] a couple of months ago he gave me a call
[27:18] and he asked me if I could go and speak
[27:20] to his youth or and the meetings
[27:26] and so then our brother ordonius and I
[27:29] made plans to go down there
[27:32] and once we arrived
[27:35] Hermanos all of the
[27:42] it was very good that we arrived in the
[27:44] Mexico City
[27:46] and we arrived with Christians
[27:51] because the city of Mexico is well known
[27:53] for something else
[27:55] but when we arrived there we arrived
[27:58] with the Christians
[28:01] everybody treated us very well this is
[28:06] from our brother olgin and from the
[28:09] people from the church
[28:12] I wanted to give a special thanks to our
[28:14] brother Eric Cruz
[28:18] he was the brother that received Us in
[28:20] his home
[28:23] and in the same way it was the same
[28:25] brother
[28:29] that received brother Johnny back on in
[28:32] 2015.
[28:35] brother Johnny also visited Mexico City
[28:39] and from what he told me
[28:42] he helped brother Johnny
[28:46] to go by that cross that we have here in
[28:49] front of the Pope he is
[28:54] and I was also mentioning to him about
[28:56] this
[28:59] how it is
[29:06] and it turns out that the first day that
[29:09] we used it was for his funeral
[29:12] the Lord knows all things
[29:18] when we were over there in the meetings
[29:32] [Music]
[29:42] and then from the airport I believe he
[29:44] drove about an hour all the way to his
[29:46] house
[29:47] [Music]
[29:50] and when we arrived to this house his
[29:53] wife gave us me and brother something is
[30:00] and as soon as we finished eating we
[30:02] quickly changed because the service was
[30:04] going to start at five
[30:07] now what I want to speak about this
[30:09] evening is
[30:13] I have entitled it the the veil of our
[30:17] own will
[30:18] uh
[30:23] for those that know me
[30:27] interpreter not only do I preach but I
[30:31] also interpret hey yes
[30:34] and that was something that I had
[30:36] struggled for men for some time
[30:42] because I personally don't like to be in
[30:45] front of everybody
[30:47] but it wasn't my will
[30:50] it was the will of God
[30:53] so when somebody serves God
[30:58] you yourself have to surrender your own
[31:00] will unto him
[31:02] and if you surrendered
[31:05] you also Surrender Your Body along with
[31:08] it
[31:10] so since the first day that we arrived
[31:13] over there
[31:14] I had to surrender my own will
[31:17] and surrender my body
[31:20] and interpret
[31:28] and another one from Ghana
[31:32] and they didn't really know any Spanish
[31:39] so I had to sit behind them and
[31:41] interpret to them uh during the service
[31:47] and just as our brother Juanito tells us
[31:53] when you go to the missionary field you
[31:55] go to work
[31:57] and you rest very scarcely
[32:01] immediately
[32:04] so as soon as I got there that's how
[32:07] quickly I started working
[32:09] but both of those Brothers
[32:16] before they were able to understand what
[32:18] that brother was preaching about that
[32:20] Thursday night
[32:22] and if you remember that Thursday
[32:25] was the 6th of
[32:28] aprila is
[32:31] random and it's brother branham's
[32:32] birthday
[32:38] and that brother had touched on certain
[32:40] points of the birthday of brother
[32:43] Branham
[32:45] and one of those things was
[32:48] Julius
[32:50] celebration that the Jews have a
[32:52] celebration
[32:54] I forget the name
[32:57] is
[32:59] but in that celebration they're all
[33:01] gathered on in in a table
[33:06] and when they're gathered around a table
[33:09] you're obviously sitting down on a chair
[33:11] celebration but in that celebration
[33:14] centados everybody seated down
[33:18] but there is an empty chair and this is
[33:24] the Jews as the reason why they would do
[33:28] that
[33:31] because the Jews are waiting for the
[33:33] promise
[33:36] for the Elysian that was promised to
[33:38] come on Earth
[33:40] and they would do that on the 6th of
[33:42] April
[33:44] well
[33:45] it turns out that the 6th of April is
[33:52] the Lord said Elijah but not to the Jews
[33:57] to us the Gentiles
[34:02] and another part that I really enjoyed
[34:04] about what the brother preached
[34:06] um
[34:10] for those that for those of you that
[34:13] know that brother Branham passed away on
[34:15] the 24th of December
[34:20] Hanukkah and there is another Feast
[34:23] that's called the Hanukkah Fiesta Los
[34:25] Padres
[34:27] and in that Feast the parents would make
[34:30] a couple of games with the kids
[34:32] the Jews would tell their kids
[34:36] all right children go find Elijah he
[34:39] want to go hide yes
[34:41] and that is done on the 24th of December
[34:46] and then on the 24th of December foreign
[35:01] so the Lord has a Time designated for
[35:04] everything
[35:07] so we really rejoiced ourselves over
[35:09] there in the services
[35:11] we were able to meet many new brothers
[35:14] uh Hermanos de Mexico brothers from
[35:18] different parts of Mexico
[35:20] and likewise from uh Peru the Espana
[35:24] from Spain the Puerto Rico from Puerto
[35:28] Rico De Colombia from Colombia is
[35:32] and every single one of them were very
[35:34] kind under us
[35:37] [Music]
[35:39] and it turns out that the majority of
[35:42] the people that I talked to Medicine
[35:45] oh yeah I already know
[35:48] you're the that interpreter I see you in
[35:51] the videos
[35:53] we've been following you for many years
[35:58] so they really they really see us
[36:03] so if you're asleep
[36:06] I think it'd be better if you woke up
[36:12] but everybody was very kind he is
[36:18] and then it fell on my lot on Saturday
[36:20] morning to speak unto the young people
[36:24] a couple of days before yolk
[36:29] every time I would change my topic
[36:34] I had a certain subject that I wanted to
[36:37] talk about
[36:39] but I had no idea or a way to get to
[36:42] that point
[36:45] so it was finally at that morning that
[36:47] the Lord helped me
[36:50] and I spoke about what we're about to
[36:53] speak on tonight
[36:56] so it turned out that being that it was
[36:58] Easter weekend Jesus that when Jesus was
[37:02] on the cross
[37:05] the scripture says that he cried out on
[37:07] a great voice
[37:12] and it said that the veil was written
[37:15] Twain in the middle
[37:25] and he says in the message Revelation
[37:28] chapter four number two this is
[37:33] then how do how do we get into this
[37:39] now remember there was a veil um
[37:44] a veil that hangs between the holy and
[37:47] the holiest of holy
[37:49] Christ
[37:53] and the holiest of all these is where
[37:55] Christ comes to sit down on your heart's
[37:57] Throne Cristo Centron Christ is
[38:00] enthroned
[38:02] he who comes through costales
[38:08] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[38:10] Pentecostals
[38:12] whosoever
[38:18] you know what that Veil is that veils
[38:21] your heart from it
[38:26] are you ready the veil is called
[38:28] self-will captain
[38:32] do you get the picture now you said
[38:35] the census out there Los Angeles
[38:38] the senses on the body and the senses of
[38:41] the Soul
[38:45] and the veil between that and the holy
[38:47] place the holiest of Holy
[38:50] Spirit
[38:53] and the only way that you can get in
[38:56] there is to have self-will
[38:59] is
[39:02] now when I heard brother Adams say this
[39:06] obviously one would automatically
[39:08] believe them
[39:08] [Music]
[39:12] but there's certain occasions where you
[39:16] don't really fully understand
[39:26] the reason as to why brother Branham
[39:28] says the way that he does
[39:30] now in the Tabernacle uh
[39:34] there were veils that separated
[39:37] different sections of of the Tabernacle
[39:40] okay
[39:43] so there was a veil that would divide
[39:46] the outer courts
[39:48] and the holy place
[39:50] and then there was another Veil
[39:53] between the holy place
[39:56] and the holiest of holy
[40:06] I realized that these two
[40:09] veilsidos they are very similar
[40:14] the veil that's out there is
[40:18] very similar to The Veil that's over
[40:21] here
[40:22] and then we'll attempt to try to show
[40:26] you this is
[40:32] between the holy place and the holiest
[40:36] of holy is
[40:38] the veil of self-will
[40:43] so then you can notice how the Lord
[40:45] Jesus Christ surrendered his will
[40:49] do you remember when he was out and uh
[40:51] Gethsemane yeah
[40:54] and he was having a great battle in
[40:56] within himself
[40:58] he didn't have it with anybody else
[41:01] he was have he was dealing with his own
[41:03] self
[41:05] he did not want to die Jesus
[41:08] Jesus was not at fault
[41:12] he never
[41:28] he also surrendered his body
[41:31] there's two veils
[41:34] as we read in Hebrews
[41:38] and where it says that we now have
[41:41] access
[41:43] onto the holiest place Jesus
[41:47] it was because for because of Jesus
[41:51] surrendering his own will
[41:53] he surrendered his body Jesus and if you
[41:57] remember Jesus himself said
[41:59] when he was face to face with a pilot is
[42:05] he said my kingdom is not of this Earth
[42:12] for if it was I would call in Legions of
[42:15] angels to come forth
[42:18] but Jesus never did that
[42:22] because he's when he surrendered his own
[42:24] will
[42:25] he also surrendered his body with it
[42:29] there's two very
[42:36] and the other one is of the body
[42:40] but both of them are very similar is
[42:45] because we know that this flesh has its
[42:48] own desires
[42:50] but also the heart has its own desires
[42:54] there's two veils but they're very
[42:58] similar Jesus
[43:00] so in Jesus when he ripped his own uh
[43:04] Veil
[43:06] he surrendered himself
[43:09] surrendered his own human will
[43:14] God's Will
[43:15] and God will is
[43:19] for him to surrender his body
[43:22] as a sacrifice
[43:25] opening the veil of his body is
[43:30] taking out all of his own attributes
[43:32] that were with them
[43:34] but he first
[43:37] he surrendered his own human will
[43:41] and then he surrendered his human body
[43:44] that's why there's two veils
[43:48] and both of them are very similar
[43:53] no I'm gonna bypass a lot of scriptures
[43:57] we're going to go to Exodus 26.
[44:04] we're going to show you that these two
[44:07] veilsidas are very similar
[44:15] are you understanding up to this point
[44:18] are those velos there's two veils
[44:21] the interior Veil exterior and the
[44:24] exterior
[44:28] if you surrender yourself within
[44:31] if you surrender your own heart
[44:34] you will surrender your body to God
[44:38] like myself
[44:42] I Surrender my own will okay
[44:44] I did not want to be an entrepreneur I
[44:48] did not want to be a preacheria
[44:50] but that's not what God wanted
[44:54] God wanted me to be a preacher and an
[44:57] interpreter
[44:58] and as I kept surrendering myself unto
[45:01] him
[45:03] I Surrender my body as well
[45:06] I'm surrendering my voice
[45:10] I'm surrendering my hearing under him
[45:14] that is just the same as when I have to
[45:16] interpret
[45:18] I have to hear the minister
[45:21] as I Surrender myself within history
[45:26] I'm also surrendering my body to be able
[45:29] to put forth the work
[45:32] that's why the two veils they're very
[45:36] similar but
[45:37] one of them is the intervales
[45:40] and the other one is the outer Veil
[45:42] persisted
[45:45] but if you surrender your inner Veil
[45:48] your own self human will
[45:53] then you will also Surrender Your Own
[45:56] carnal desires of your body
[45:59] so on those velos there's two veils
[46:02] and they're very similar
[46:04] and we're going to show you that says
[46:07] Uno and going into Exodus 26 1.
[46:21] moreover thou shall make the Tabernacle
[46:24] with 10 curtains of fine-twined linen
[46:26] and blue and purple and Scarlet with
[46:30] turbines of cunning work shall thou make
[46:33] them
[46:35] so as you can notice all the materials
[46:38] that go within the veils
[46:40] now the Tabernacle foreign
[46:48] [Music]
[46:58] so it went this way
[47:01] and when it got to the entrance it would
[47:04] fall down this way this is so it was 10
[47:07] in total Traverse
[47:17] now we're going to read it again
[47:20] Tabernacle with 10 curtains a
[47:22] fine-twined linen and blue and purple
[47:24] and Scarlet with turbines of cunning
[47:27] work shall thou make them
[47:37] and also the veil that it will allow you
[47:40] to come from the outer courts into the
[47:43] holy Place
[47:47] between the holy and the holiest place
[47:51] material is also made of the same
[47:55] materials now if you go to Exodus 26 31
[48:00] Venus
[48:09] and thou shall make a veil of blue and
[48:11] purple and Scarlet and fine twine linen
[48:14] of cunning work with cherubins shall it
[48:17] be made
[48:19] so as you can see that the Tabernacle
[48:22] primer Velo with the first Veil e El
[48:25] Segundo Velo and the second Veil foreign
[48:28] were made out of the same material
[48:31] can you see that
[48:36] because
[48:42] you as well have two veils
[48:45] because you also are a Tabernacles
[48:49] you have your outer courts
[48:52] you have your holy place
[48:59] and that's the reason why you have your
[49:01] two veils
[49:03] and if both of those veils of the
[49:06] Tabernacles
[49:07] were very similar
[49:10] and then likewise the veils that you
[49:13] have
[49:14] are very similar
[49:17] you have the veil of the flesh
[49:23] then you have the veil of your own
[49:25] self-will
[49:27] because when we are born
[49:30] we are born with sin in the body
[49:34] and also with within the heart
[49:37] so when Jesus saves us
[49:40] and he gives us of his holy spirit
[49:44] he takes away the sin of the heart but
[49:49] he does not take away the sin of this
[49:51] flesh
[49:53] this uh body is is death
[50:00] so The Marvelous thing about all this is
[50:05] that in verse 32 this is
[50:17] this and thou shall hang it upon four
[50:20] pillars
[50:22] would overlaid with gold their hooks
[50:25] shall be of gold upon the four sockets
[50:27] of silver
[50:31] what
[50:34] movie and cuando
[50:36] El Velo de foreign
[51:16] notice the natural man even counts
[51:18] backwards this is
[51:21] I said he did things backwards
[51:24] he counts backwards
[51:27] watch his count dies
[51:30] unocero
[51:35] ten nine eight seven six five four three
[51:38] two one zero
[51:41] see he goes back
[51:44] and starts counting
[51:50] he's all 10 is a bad number that's right
[51:55] to start with 10 is a bad number
[52:03] they had 10 tribes of Israel and then
[52:06] was just all
[52:08] carnals there was 12 tribes
[52:13] but only ten of them were very
[52:18] Carnales so ten speaks about the carnal
[52:22] nature is
[52:24] this party is is flesh is
[52:32] so that so then the other way foreign
[53:22] and they're very similar
[54:12] for the mistake that you did uh through
[54:15] your outer Veil I dos velos there's two
[54:18] veils
[54:30] is
[54:31] your own self-will
[54:35] what you decide to do
[54:39] and sometimes you do things for that
[54:43] carnal push
[54:49] but then there's also times that you do
[54:51] things for your uh heart's desire yeah
[54:56] and then there's times in that it's
[54:59] going to be difficult to be able to
[55:00] distinguish one from the other natural
[55:03] because within the naturals that both of
[55:06] those veils foreign
[55:18] they appear to be very similar
[55:30] is going to get upset
[55:33] good thing that they're recording this
[55:38] is
[55:41] so then you can see that the outer Veil
[55:45] eradvies was 10.
[55:47] when it was closed usted you when you
[55:51] were closed off from God
[55:53] you are very carnal minded
[55:56] you are 10.
[55:59] but if you surrender your body
[56:03] you first Surrender Your Own inner Veil
[56:07] and then you surrender your outer Veil
[56:11] that number 10 is
[56:13] the carnal mindedness
[56:17] becomes two number fives what's number
[56:21] five
[56:22] it's Grace
[56:24] ay dos gracias there's two Grace La
[56:26] primer Gracia the first Grace is
[56:29] the grace of Salvation
[56:32] then the second grace is
[56:34] the rapturing grace
[56:38] and in First Peter 1 10
[56:46] watch how Peter begins to talk about two
[56:49] different Graces
[56:51] the first one is talks about uh which is
[56:54] salvation
[56:56] and then he talks about a future Grace
[57:00] and then in verse 10 this is
[57:11] of which salvation the prophets have
[57:13] inquired and searched diligently who
[57:15] prophesied of the grace that should come
[57:18] unto you
[57:20] gracias La salvation so now we can
[57:23] notice that the first Grace is salvation
[57:25] Jesus
[57:29] so when Jesus arrives for the first time
[57:34] he comes with an initial Grace that he
[57:36] wishes to give you
[57:38] every Christian that's here
[57:41] has received the first grace of God
[57:45] you were saved by grace
[57:49] and then when Jesus comes for the second
[57:51] time
[57:52] La Segunda Gracia the second grace
[57:56] will activate within you Jesus because
[58:00] when Jesus comes
[58:04] he won't physically come on the earth
[58:08] brother
[58:12] so he doesn't come down completely
[58:19] the Bible says that we will meet up with
[58:21] him with in the in the near Commerce
[58:25] how is it that you're going to meet the
[58:28] Lord Jesus Christ in the air is
[58:31] this party is subject to the gravity
[58:35] so then you now you find yourself that
[58:37] you need a second grace
[58:40] when you are born again
[58:43] when you have accepted the salvation of
[58:46] the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:48] you receive eternal life and Su Alma
[58:52] Within
[58:54] but not within your flesh
[58:57] that's why we still keep getting
[59:01] sickness that's why we continue to
[59:04] suffer within this body
[59:06] we already have eternal life
[59:09] but only within the soul
[59:13] but when Jesus comes for the second time
[59:17] he will come to give us eternal life
[59:20] not within our soul but now in our flesh
[59:35] will give you a new Young body that's
[59:38] eternal
[59:42] so he comes to give you life
[59:46] but you only have eternal life within
[59:49] your soul
[59:50] but then when he arrives
[59:56] will give you a body that will have the
[59:58] capacity
[1:00:00] to be able to defy gravity and to be
[1:00:03] able to go up into the air
[1:00:07] only that Eternal Body will be able to
[1:00:10] do that
[1:00:11] Jesus
[1:00:13] because right after when Jesus had died
[1:00:16] and resurrected
[1:00:18] he was in an eternal body
[1:00:23] that he was able to travel so fast
[1:00:29] and then after being with the disciples
[1:00:32] and on Earth for about 40 days
[1:00:35] he had the ability to be able to rise up
[1:00:38] into the the the air into the La Primera
[1:00:41] Gracia so the first Grace
[1:00:44] gives you
[1:00:45] eternal life and to Alma within your
[1:00:48] soul
[1:00:49] the second grace
[1:00:51] will give you eternal life
[1:00:54] in a body
[1:00:57] Pedro
[1:01:02] we're going to continue reading in First
[1:01:04] Peter 1 11. this is
[1:01:18] searching what or what manner of time
[1:01:21] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[1:01:23] did signify when it testified beforehand
[1:01:26] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[1:01:29] that should follow
[1:01:31] is
[1:01:46] Los Angeles
[1:01:48] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[1:01:52] themselves but unto us they that they
[1:01:55] did Minister the things which are now
[1:01:57] reported Under You by them that have
[1:01:59] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:02:01] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[1:02:04] things the Angels desired to look into
[1:02:08] now and then in verse 13 minutes
[1:02:13] notice how Peter begins to talk about a
[1:02:15] future Grace this is
[1:02:29] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[1:02:32] be sober and hope till the end for the
[1:02:35] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[1:02:37] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:42] so then in the first coming of Christ
[1:02:45] he came to give the first Grace and then
[1:02:49] in the second coming
[1:02:52] he comes to give us the second grace
[1:02:57] so the first Grace that he comes when he
[1:03:00] arrives
[1:03:03] he gives us the grace of his salvation
[1:03:21] to be able to inherit eternal life
[1:03:26] and Jesus said in the scriptures
[1:03:31] he said that he looked upon him and he
[1:03:33] loved them
[1:03:34] poor
[1:03:39] and then if you remember it said that he
[1:03:42] did not
[1:03:45] acceptable because he revealed what his
[1:03:49] own self will was
[1:03:51] what was the what kind of veil was it
[1:03:53] that he had okay
[1:03:56] what kind of carnal desires did he have
[1:03:58] within him
[1:04:01] he did not want to surrender his
[1:04:04] Willow he did not want to rip his veil
[1:04:08] of his riches
[1:04:12] he told them sell sell all of your
[1:04:15] riches and give unto the poor
[1:04:20] I think there's many people that
[1:04:22] misunderstand that scripture Jesus
[1:04:25] Jesus told that to him
[1:04:32] because he knows that if he was
[1:04:34] genuinely going to be able to surrender
[1:05:15] to allow the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:05:19] Holy Spirit form in enter into his heart
[1:05:24] and because of the light of the Holy
[1:05:28] Spirit
[1:05:30] would be able to come down and give him
[1:05:32] eternal life
[1:05:33] but because he did not do that
[1:05:58] and his body was in torture
[1:06:03] so if you surrender your intervales
[1:06:07] you will also surrender your outer veils
[1:06:12] so if you surrender your inner Veil that
[1:06:15] you have within you usted
[1:06:17] you will then surrender your outer Veil
[1:06:19] that you have within outside of you
[1:06:22] but since he did not surrender his inner
[1:06:25] will that means
[1:06:27] his outer will suffered along with it
[1:06:29] but
[1:06:31] if you surrender your Veil that's within
[1:06:33] you
[1:06:35] El Senor you will rejoice yourself with
[1:06:38] the Lord
[1:06:39] with the brand new Veil
[1:06:42] a brand new body
[1:06:46] there's two veils
[1:06:49] they're very similar
[1:07:02] then you surrender the next fail
[1:07:06] you surrender your own self human will
[1:07:09] then you surrender your body
[1:07:14] it's just like when that person that's
[1:07:17] just been saved
[1:07:20] they surrendered their heart unto the
[1:07:22] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:26] and then they surrender their bodies to
[1:07:28] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:07:29] Jesus Christ
[1:07:30] because there's two veils
[1:07:34] and just as our brother Marco Santana uh
[1:07:37] spoken to us
[1:07:39] he spoke about the process of the new
[1:07:43] birth
[1:07:45] he said how someone should repent
[1:07:48] and baptized
[1:07:57] but there's people that only get
[1:07:59] baptized and never got repented
[1:08:03] they surrendered
[1:08:06] but they never surrender their inner
[1:08:08] Veil
[1:08:54] let thy will be done
[1:09:05] which was different from the will of God
[1:09:09] because Jesus was innocent
[1:09:12] he never did anything wrong pero
[1:09:15] but
[1:09:17] he died as if he was a sinner
[1:09:27] was for him to die for the sins of
[1:09:30] everybody else
[1:09:32] so then there's two veils
[1:09:37] and Jesus Christ also had them
[1:09:41] because Jesus surrendered his inner veil
[1:09:44] of he also surrendered his outer veilpo
[1:09:49] he surrendered his bodies
[1:09:51] you as well have the two veils
[1:09:56] you first of all in your heart surrender
[1:09:58] is
[1:10:07] likewise surrender unto God
[1:10:36] and then if you remember that the veil
[1:10:38] within the holy and the holiest holiest
[1:10:40] is
[1:10:46] between the outer courts and the holy
[1:10:49] Place
[1:10:51] says that it was open
[1:10:55] because you surrender your inner uh well
[1:11:00] that will automatically cause
[1:11:04] that you open up the outer Veil
[1:11:31] that Jesus Christ himself did
[1:11:36] surrendering his own human will
[1:11:40] and because you surrender your own human
[1:11:42] will
[1:11:44] you surrender your human body
[1:11:52] so then there's two Grace
[1:11:56] the inner Grace and the outer Grace
[1:12:00] the grace of Salvation
[1:12:04] giving you eternal life within your
[1:12:06] heart or your soul
[1:12:08] and the other Grace is
[1:12:11] the rapture in Grace when he comes
[1:12:15] he will give you eternal life into
[1:12:17] cuerpo within your body yes and in that
[1:12:21] body
[1:12:21] has the capacity
[1:12:24] to be able to rise in the air the
[1:12:26] literally
[1:12:29] to literally go into the presence of the
[1:12:33] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:40] and if I had more time I would be able
[1:12:42] to explain it more foreign
[1:13:13] linen clean and white for the fine linen
[1:13:16] is the righteousness of saints
[1:13:21] now it's fine linen and it's white
[1:13:27] do you remember when brother Brandon
[1:13:30] passed over uh beyond the the current
[1:13:32] time
[1:13:33] he passed that
[1:13:35] veilos because
[1:13:38] are within the dimensions
[1:13:42] do you remember when he said that he can
[1:13:44] see his body
[1:13:47] he was so close that he can still see
[1:13:49] his body
[1:13:51] but it's a veil of Dimensions
[1:13:54] that permits you to open the veil and
[1:13:58] that you can see
[1:14:05] was made of fine linen is
[1:14:10] that was the garments in which they were
[1:14:12] dressed
[1:14:14] and then when brother Brandon went
[1:14:16] beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:20] when he saw all the saints that were
[1:14:22] over there
[1:14:23] they were all dressed in white
[1:14:27] that is the fine linen
[1:14:31] you go outside of that
[1:14:35] once you pass that Veil below the Avail
[1:14:38] of that body
[1:14:40] you enter into a brand new body
[1:14:44] with a brand new garment elino Fino the
[1:14:48] fine linen El Blanco why
[1:14:54] and then they also had the color of blue
[1:14:57] this is
[1:15:00] and brother Brandon says that in Hebrews
[1:15:02] chapter 6 part 3 this is
[1:15:10] great Forerunner has gone before us
[1:15:12] making a way to
[1:15:16] he become from a spirit
[1:15:18] Las Grandes Fuentes
[1:15:22] the great Fountains of the rainbow of
[1:15:24] God who had no beginning nor
[1:15:27] endos he was forever God is
[1:15:36] this ray of light went forth it was Ray
[1:15:39] of love that's the main one red the next
[1:15:42] color follows which was blue El color
[1:15:48] the next color follows which was blue
[1:15:51] blue the truth the trueness
[1:15:54] so then true or Bloom represents the
[1:15:58] trueness
[1:16:01] and then in another uh quote uh in the
[1:16:05] message the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:16:06] this is amor
[1:16:12] and then the first great spirit of God
[1:16:15] which is love
[1:16:18] God like the great rainbow nope
[1:16:22] we couldn't imagine what he looks like
[1:16:27] but just say he looks like the rainbow
[1:16:29] them Spirits
[1:16:33] the perfect Spirit of Love
[1:16:35] is
[1:16:38] Blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship
[1:16:47] he saw that the people were dressed and
[1:16:50] finally
[1:16:52] and everybody came to have fellowship
[1:16:54] with him
[1:16:55] that's what blue represents
[1:17:01] and the perfect Fellowship
[1:17:04] all the people that he saw
[1:17:07] were the people that accepted his
[1:17:09] message
[1:17:11] and we know that this message is the
[1:17:14] truth
[1:17:22] to be able to
[1:17:28] have fellowship with the rest of the
[1:17:30] brothers that had already passed on
[1:17:33] that's why that Veil
[1:17:38] and had the color blue
[1:18:12] is represented in the color of white
[1:18:18] so each one of these colors has its own
[1:18:21] significant meaning and this is
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:39] you will also surrender or open the
[1:18:42] outer Veil okay
[1:18:44] which becomes then the two races and the
[1:18:48] first Grace
[1:18:49] foreign
[1:19:06] was placed within the dimensions
[1:19:08] but then also within you but
[1:19:13] everything begins
[1:19:15] that you surrender your own will
[1:19:20] if you're able to surrender your own
[1:19:22] self-will that you have within you
[1:19:25] then the Lord will come and help you
[1:19:28] with this outer Veil
[1:19:42] don't surrender your body first
[1:19:45] Surrender Your Heart
[1:19:48] and then that's what's going to cause
[1:19:53] that you naturally surrender your body
[1:19:55] to God foreign
[1:20:07] it's kind of hard to be able to
[1:20:09] distinguish between one and the other
[1:20:24] he wants you from your own will Tomaso
[1:20:28] decision take your decision
[1:20:31] if you wish to rip it or not
[1:20:34] or if you wish to keep it close
[1:20:38] this is now remember that in the Bible
[1:20:41] says in John 3 16.
[1:20:46] for God so loved the world
[1:20:49] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:20:54] any one that believes in them
[1:21:00] but have eternal life
[1:21:03] everything is based off of your own
[1:21:06] decision
[1:21:08] Jesus said that he loved or the Bible
[1:21:12] says that Jesus loved Enrico the Rich
[1:21:15] Young Ruler Jesus
[1:21:18] but just because Jesus loved them they
[1:21:21] didn't mean that he received eternal
[1:21:23] life
[1:21:25] the Bible says that Jesus loves the
[1:21:27] world
[1:21:29] but not because Jesus loves the world
[1:21:39] but everything is based off of if you
[1:21:42] love him if you love him
[1:21:44] you surrender your will is
[1:21:49] you you surrender that inner Veil
[1:21:53] you are of your own self will rip it in
[1:21:56] half yes
[1:21:57] and then he is going to help you with
[1:21:59] your outer veils
[1:22:02] sometimes gets sick
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:06] if you're out of vale it doesn't want to
[1:22:09] come to church
[1:22:12] sometimes commits incorrect things
[1:22:17] being that the holy spirit is already
[1:22:19] within you decision
[1:22:21] and you already made your decision to
[1:22:24] surrender your own will
[1:22:25] so then within yourself
[1:22:30] will cause that you're out reveal
[1:22:32] surrender once again to God
[1:22:35] that's a very important key is
[1:22:40] that you surrender the inner Veil first
[1:22:44] and then the outer Veil will open up
[1:22:55] that's why when some when some of the
[1:22:57] people that get baptized
[1:23:00] or those that accept the Lord Jesus
[1:23:02] Christ as their savior
[1:23:04] they don't do it correctly
[1:23:06] because they first surrender the outer
[1:23:09] Veil
[1:23:12] the first one that must be surrendered
[1:23:14] is the interior
[1:23:17] if you sincerely surrender that inner
[1:23:20] Veil this is
[1:23:22] naturally the outer Veil is going to
[1:23:24] open up
[1:23:26] that's the key
[1:23:30] everything is based off of free moral
[1:23:32] agency
[1:23:33] what is your decision
[1:23:35] do you want to surrender under God
[1:23:39] and convert that number 10
[1:23:42] which is that carnal mindedness in those
[1:23:45] gracias into two Graces
[1:23:48] but everything is based off of you
[1:23:51] you have to make your own decisions
[1:23:54] because the Lord is a gentleman
[1:23:59] he's not going to rip the Veil Just
[1:24:02] because he feels like
[1:24:04] he's not going to force the entry
[1:24:08] it all comes down to you
[1:24:11] if you could please stand
[1:24:26] if you sometimes
[1:24:29] with the outer Veil
[1:24:32] that happens to everybody
[1:24:37] just make sure that the interview is
[1:24:40] the one that's surrendered unto God
[1:24:45] so if you if you struggling with the
[1:24:48] outer Veil
[1:24:51] the interval is going to help you to
[1:24:53] open up the outer veils
[1:24:56] if you within yourself have the Holy
[1:24:58] Spirit
[1:25:00] you already have a surrendered heart
[1:25:05] and if there's something that you're
[1:25:07] struggling with this evening
[1:25:11] remember what the Bible says about David
[1:25:13] okay
[1:25:16] that he was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:25:21] so that Veil is within that heart
[1:25:26] so even though he committed many great
[1:25:29] mistakes
[1:25:32] that interior veil of David yeah
[1:25:35] was already written two
[1:25:38] important
[1:25:39] so it didn't matter what kind of
[1:25:42] mistakes David did
[1:25:44] what God really cared about is
[1:25:49] that that inner Veil within David was
[1:25:52] already ripped
[1:25:54] every single one of us makes mistakes
[1:26:00] so if we commit a mistake in the outer
[1:26:03] Veil osiacas
[1:26:05] or maybe you still have sin within your
[1:26:08] heart La clave is the very key is
[1:26:17] confess your sins
[1:26:19] and surrender unto God
[1:26:23] and then the Lord will help you with the
[1:26:25] rest let us pray
[1:26:38] Lord help us to be able to follow that
[1:26:40] example that the Lord Jesus Christ gave
[1:26:42] us
[1:26:48] he surrendered
[1:26:51] and when he was up at Calvary
[1:26:54] he surrendered his body
[1:26:58] help us Lord be able to do the same
[1:27:03] to be able to surrender our own human
[1:27:05] will
[1:27:08] and also likewise surrender our flesh
[1:27:13] help us this evening
[1:27:16] and forgive us of our sins
[1:27:32] there's times where that outer Veil
[1:27:34] wants to maintain itself close but are
[1:27:36] you are you the nursing
[1:27:39] Lord help us to be able to surrender
[1:27:41] within ourselves
[1:27:44] and then the outer Veil will open up to
[1:27:47] the rest
[1:27:50] so that the rest of the world can see
[1:27:52] the light that's already within us
[1:27:55] help us in this evening Lord my name is
[1:27:59] Christopher we ask it in the name of the
[1:28:01] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
