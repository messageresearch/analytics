oh [Music] spee [Music] fore [Music] foree resit for [Music] [Applause] pre God bless you um before I sing this song I wanted to give a short testimony so uh few weeks ago um my dad had the desire to go visit brother Po and uh I asked my dad the night before to sing a song to sing a special at his church and I had the desire to sing a special and um Sunday morning when I was getting ready I had already had my song and I was like okay I'm going to sing this song and this is the song I'm going to sing and then my mom told me she's like go get a jacket because it's going to be cold and so I grabbed my jacket and when I was leaving the house I put my hand in the jacket and there was a crumpled piece of paper of some chords to a song and I was like well I might as well just sing this song I already have it and so we went to Tucson and the I got to sing my special and the sister after me the song that I was going to sing she ended up singing that song so I thank God that he even though that I didn't get to sing the song that he allowed the song to still be sung and um we decided to save for the afternoon service and that night uh the brother who preached um his name was brother George Moore he came up to my dad and my dad told him what had happened in the morning and he said that he had heard that preaching or that song he had heard that song in Canada a choir sing it and it was exactly what he had preached about the song was called never a time and it was this exact same thing they had preached about and he told us that the night before on Saturday that he was praying because nobody in his church knew that song and that he was praying that someone would come and sing it and so Sunday morning I sang that song and God fulfilled his um wish and I thought that was beautiful amen thank you there's no one great Among Us where nothing on our own we make mistakes and often slip just come in flesh and born but someday I'll prove just what I [Music] say I'm a a SP

God can heal him we're in the right path Mal I myself for years had the same problem with my knee and I was just struggling with that pain but I believe that we believe in a living God I pray once twice until finally that pain left that pain in my knee will go from one knee to the other but the great physician that has all potential I was delivered it's been a couple of years now that that pain has left me and if this morning you believe it everybody that's listening to me especially brother Mali I'm going to be pray for him this morning let's pray for our brother Heaven good father this

history the wonderful thing is we don't serve a god of History we serve a God in present day because his word says He is the same yesterday today and forever and his word does not change if his word changes that means he's not God but praise the Lord that his word does not change the same word that was written back [Music] then the same word that was written back then the same is the same word

also the brothers from St Louis are going to go where he's at so they can hear him preach over there too um and then we have our our pastor brother oio and brother Marco Santana in [Music] Peru you know that's very awesome right that that who would have thought that they'll be inviting us to go to Peru again so God is good amen let's keep them in prayer so they can come back home safely amen before we read our Bibles let's let's pray and let's go to the author of the word Heavenly Father we we come onto you today Lord father with expectation Lord of what you're going to bring us today Father help us to open up our ears open up our hearts father and to receive your word today we come here to worship you we want to make you feel welcome today Father may you remove any evil thought anything that's incorrect father out of this place so we can worship you freely Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen and if you wouldn't mind opening up your scriptures to the Book of John this will be our sixth message he that have an ear let him hear and as a subtitle uh what is the truth and in this morning I'm going to read a couple of scriptures so I'm asking that you have a little bit of patience with me you maintain your Bibles open because we're going to be going through uh quite a few scriptures so in the Book of John uh chapter 18 uh verse [Music] 37 pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I unto this world uh that I should bear witness unto the Earth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate say unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and said unto them I find him in him no fault at all amen you may take your seats if you wouldn't mind keeping your scriptures open I don't know how you feel about when a preacher reads a lot of scriptures many times people have their own thoughts of what should a preacher be doing but this morning I believe everything should be founded upon the word of God not just this morning but every day and I believe that everything that we do should be according to the word of God and a certain time ago I heard a certain story that if the Bible of a certain person is falling into pieces what would be the reason or the cause for the pages to fall out of the Bible can anybody think of why if you see a Bible That's all torn up and falling into pieces what would be the reason to cause all of that damage because the Bible is very well-kept no because that person is constantly reading and reading and reading the Bible Turning Page from page to page I have a Bible when I first started I still have it that the pages were falling apart so then I had to stap back together and that's the reason why I have now a new Bible but then when I see a Bible of a person that's not uh written on highlights and doesn't have their highlights onto it and doesn't have any notes I could notice that that person doesn't really read their Bible but I think that if a person has a Bible that's just falling all all into pieces and they have notes everywhere all written across I could see that that person is not falling into pieces when I see a Bible that's falling into pieces that person that's reading that Bible is not falling into pieces but if the Bible is almost brand new then perhaps hear me close perhaps maybe that person is the one that's falling into pieces so in this morning I would like to encourage you ex you exort for you to read your Bible and in this morning we're going to be speaking about what is the truth so we see in the scriptures that Jesus came to speak forth of the truth and he was going to give testimony of it and so then if he's going to give a testimony then he's a witness so then in uh Revelations 15 it says Jesus the uh true witness to give testimony unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice he that have an ear to hear Let Him hear and so then my question is today what is the truth or what is and we're having our Sunday school this morning what is the truth the truth are of certain fact events that have made uh in fulfill the things that are true and then me knowing this message and the prophet declares unto me many things if there is a truth there is also a lie if there's a hypocrite there is a genuine Christian if there's a false dollar then there's a genuine dollar and there's a lot of people that are more attracted to those things that are false and why is that why is it that they're more attracted to the LIE than the truth and forgive me for the saying but why is it that people are more attracted to Hypocrites than the genuine Christian why is that if Jesus came to speak forth truth and everything that is the truth here's the voice of the truth and so then what is a lie a lie according to the dictionary is to make a false testimony with the intention of uh lying to deceive or to deceive sorry a lie it's a false declaration that's not true but then that lie has an intention and what is that intention is to deceive now we're speaking about the message of the hour what did the devil come he brought forth A Lie from the very beginning and that same lie has gone throughout all the ages and now the prophet says what is a lie it is 99% truth and 1% a lie and so then a lie is not a 50% lie it has 99% of the truth but just a a certain small percentage that's been Twisted into a lie with the intention to deceive and the devil came forth to with the intention to deceive the woman may God help us this morning so the prophet tells us I didn't give you this call in the message adoption number he says that sin was not a creation no sir sin is a perversion there's only one Creator and who is that it's God okay okay all right so we're having our Sunday school here uh sin is righteousness perverted what is an adultery it's a righteous act perverted and what is a lie it is the truth misrepresented wow and so then we see that you're presenting to me a certain amount of truth but I want to present it to you the way that I want to may God help us so then what is a lie it is a truth that I want to represent what is a bad word it is the blessings of God converted into a curse instead of a blessing sin is not a creation sin is just a perversion uh Satan can't create sin he only perverted that which God had created I have a friend that told me a story once I might not say it the same way that he told me says that the truth was here and then the lie was over here and the lie was uh bathing in the pool and the light tells the truth truth come into the pool and the water is very warm he said liar you're very good liar I'm not going to get in there and he says come in I'm telling you the truth what what's the lie it's a truth misrepresented and he said come in so then the truth got a little bit closer and the truth had his clothes on had his suit with a tie his dress shoes he might perhaps had boots on I don't if he was from Mexico he might have had some crocodile boots I don't know but then the truth comes near and he begins to touch the water to kind of test it out lie you told me the truth it is warm and he said come in and and then in order for you to get into the pool you have to first take off the clothes so he took off his crocodile boots and he took off what he had and he began to get into the water and he began to get into the water with the with the LIE and when the truth hadn't realized the LIE gets out of the water and the LIE puts on the clothes of the truth puts on the suit of the truth and puts on the crocodile boots of the truth and begins to run and the truth begins to realize that the LIE had lied to him and he said liar you lied to me and you stole my clothing and he took off and now the truth was left naked and when he got out nobody wanted to come near the truth because nobody wants that naked truth nobody wants the truth the way it is RA Raw they wanted a little bit pampered but then when the truth is they don't want it but then they accept the lie that is covered in truth but it isn't truth it's only being misrepresented and so then Jesus came to give testimony to the truth and everybody that is of the truth heareth my voice we're going to go to the Book of Mark chapter 4 go to verse 21 and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a brush brushel or under a bed and not to be set on a Candlestick loose for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was there any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad If any man have ears to hear Let Him hear and it's speaking about the the light if we have the light are we going to hide it what is that light and what is that light that we must manifest now we're going to go to the book of First John uh uh John 8 sorry going to go to John 8:31 and it says like this and here we see Jesus uh talking to the Jews then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you then are ye my disciples indeed and so then we see that there's a very special key here if we continue in his word it's not that one day we're here and then the next day we're over there we must maintain ourselves within his word what does his word say you should not forsake the assembly as many have and there's many things that we must uh continue to do and verse 32 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's something tremendous right there I come to give testimony of the truth and what is the truth is the Lord Jesus Christ and if and I am going to tell you the truth and you shall know the truth and the first thing that someone has to recognize is that a person is in the wrong and when a person thinks that they're always right then we can't help them and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free and so then the Jews heard this phrase that Jesus said and they said we be Abraham seed and we are a blessed people and how dare you tell us that we're slaves and so in order for a person to be free they first have to be in bondage and I don't see any uh chains on my hands or feet and we've never been slaves and how do you say that we should be free and so then Jesus answers to them verely verely I say unto you if you notice that phrase verly fairly I say unto you every Prophet even brother Bram says this thus sayith the lord it's thus sayith the Lord is thus sayith the Lord but then when the Lord Jesus came he didn't say thus sayth the Lord he says I tell you unto you because he is the Lord he wasn't just a simple prophet he was the god of the prophets verily verily I say unto you whosoever committs sin is the vant of sin okay and so what is sin to smoke and drink no those are just attributes of sin and so then what is sin sin is unbelief of the word of God and so then if I believe just the certain part of the whole Bible or if I just believe 99% of the Bible but then when I come across a certain percentage of the word that begins to hurt me and if I don't believe it or accept it then that becomes unbelief that's to not believe in his word but brother I believe the whole Bible but just this certain part I don't believe I don't understand and I can't accept it so it's not that we can't understand it not if you can accept it or not accept it that's what it's about do you believe or not believe to understand it is a completely different thing I don't ask the Lord to be able to understand every single thing I ask the Lord to help me to believe that's why the prophet brother Bram in the scripture say help my unbelief because when we begin to read something and it begins to hit directly in our own lives then it be becomes to be a little bit difficult to accept it but if we reject that word then we're now in sin and we have now become bondage so then Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth sh shall set you free now I'm going to give a curve here now the truth is going to set you free what is the truth it's the word it's the message it's to make you free but then when somebody rejects it what does that do we're GNA continue reading we're going to go to the first John first John chapter 1 verse 8 first John 18 if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and I think I've said it enough behind this Pulpit it's very sad when somebody deceives you but the even worst part is when you look at yourself in the mirror and you tell yourself you're okay you're okay just stand as you are you're perfectly fine and we must make sure that we're right on the word we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us may God help us now we're going to go back to John John uh chapter 1 verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory and the glory as of the one only begotten of the father Full of Grace and Truth full of grace and truth now verse 15 John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake and he that came after me is preferred before me for he was before me and so then we find something here that's a bit peculiar uh something a bit outstanding he says that it comes after me but he's before me he's coming after me but he is before me and of his fullness have we all received and Grace for grace for the law was given by Moses for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus [Applause] Christ the law came through Moses the law uh had to come and a man by the name of Moses came but the grace and the truth came by Jesus Christ and now John 14 it's very nice to hear those pages turning John 146 and you know when you read it helps your mind did you know that that's why the prophet said that this generation is much wiser but more weaker have you noticed that almost all the young people are dying but all the elders are very strong why because they ate Genuine Food natural organic meat but nowadays everything is all contaminated I'm going to prephase it a little bit chopped up but you can go and search it out prophesy that the angel told Brother brandham don't uh don't eat the the white yolk from the eggs because it's going to damage your teeth and now you go out and search that all the natural food is now contaminated that's why it's so hard for women to get pregnant now now and now when they reach the age of 30 they're hitting menopause but the elderly from those days they were firm and strong but now the young people they're so weak they can't they can't take speaking about the natural but the natural also typifies the spiritual this generation is much wiser they know everything but they're way weaker may God help us that's why it's very important for us to read I'm not against this but it's also good for you to read so that you have your mind alert to be alive amen and what better book to read than the Bible what other better thing to do John 146 Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me I am the way the truth and the life if there is any truth there is a lie if there is a correct way then there's an incorrect way if there's an eternal way eternal life if there's a heaven there's a hell and may God help us but Jesus said I am the way and that way is going to take you to the truth is going to take you to eternal life and now we're going to jump over to Matthew 7 Matthew 713 go ahead uh Matthew 7:13 m 7133 enter ye into the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go in uh there at and so then Jesus is the way the truth and the life and we see that there's two two ways and and doors the two doors better said are going to be uh represent themselves unto you one is the good one and the other one is the incorrect but then who makes that decision you yourself but before you make that decision you are going to hear the gospel you're going to hear the message of the hour for your day you have your day and this is your this is the message for your day and so then now you're going to make your own decision and there's going to be two doors in front of you you're going to go through the narrow uh uh the W the broad uh door it's wide it's very wide and very pretty because uh broad is the gate that leadth to destruction it's spacious spacious there's so much road on that you can see how many are are always walking through that but that road will take you to and it's many it's not few it's many that go therein it's not a few it's many and then verse 14 says because straight is the gate now we're talking about the other one and narrow is the way and we see that that path is very narrow and not wide as the other one now the other one takes you to Perdition and this one will take you onto life and very few there be that find it many will go in through that door that will take you to Perdition but very few will go to those that will go to life he is the way and that way he's going to take you to the truth and that truth will take you onto eternal life there's two doors there's a truth and there's a lie there's a right way and there's an incorrect way there's a good door and there's an incorrect door we're GNA go to First John once again back to First John first John uh chapter 4 verse 5 they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world Heth them and when you're in the world that's all you can hear is the things of the world incorrect things but when someone is of God when somebody is an eagle and when you're there the in the Eagle's Nest and when you hear that mother Eagle Cry The Gospel the message of the hour you begin to react and you begin to say what is this because the only one that can hear another Eagle is an eagle and now verse six we are of God he that knoweth God he with us that's the reason why you're listening to me because you are of God and since you are of God you're thinking about every word that I'm telling you and you can say that is the truth because just like an eagle you understand or know the language of an eagle but if you're a chicken you're only going to hear the hen uh he that is not of God Heth not us hereby know we the and the spirit he that have let him he and this we shall know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error may God help us hereby we know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error and so we see that the spirit or the truth is a spirit and the error is also a spirit and that error will make you think that you are in the truth that error will tell you here's the word here's the message but there is a spirit may God help us he that have an ear let him hear okay we're in good time here we're going to go to John 12 John 12:44 here we're going to make some emphasis on what we read in The Book of Mark is it that you bring forth the light to hide it or is it just to keep it there nice and clean but everything shall be made manifest nothing that's been hidden shall stay hidden everything shall be made manifest that's the reason why the Bible tells us he that is uh unclean that he may continue to be un but he that is clean continue to be clean in verse 44 says Jesus cried and said uh I like this part he's cried he didn't just talk he cried out and said he that believeth on me believe not on me but on him that sent me amen what is that what is that telling us we're going to say this by an example brother Manuel Santos is in Mexico right now he's over there is he only representing uel Santos no he's representing all of us brother Marcos and brother Octavius is representing all of us over there in Peru believe not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me uh him that sent me see him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that set me now verse 46 I am come a light into the world and the Book of Markus says is it that we're going to hide our light under a pillow or something hidden what is that light and we're going to read it here on verse 46 I am I am came a light what is the light the Lord Jesus Christ he is the light he is the truth and that truth should not be hidden but it should be brought forth and showed onto the world that Jesus Christ is the light of the world that he is the truth I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me shall not abide in darkness he that hear my words and here it's going to get a little bit rough and if any man hear my words and believe not what does that mean that believeth not it's when you're here listening to the message of the hour you begin to listen to the message in the morning on Sunday you come Monday or Tuesday and you don't keep it you don't live it you don't accept it brother we're living in the end times and what are you doing with this word why isn't there any more new births there's many people that haven't been born again but they've been here in church for years for years and even then they can't see the word because it's not by flesh or blood not because my son is my son he himself when he's born or comes to the age of accountability he has to accept this or he has to reject it I can't save him I can guide him to the word just the same as each and every one of you we're guiding you to the word and what do you do tomorrow what do you do on Tuesday what do you do on Wednesday with the word that you've heard it's something tremendous the word he that Hearth my words and believe it not I judge him not he says it right there I judge him not glory to [Applause] God and forgive me if there's somebody that does this here uh woe unto me if I hear these words and I don't keep them but blessed be the name of the Lord because he says that he will not judge me glory to God uh and believe it not I judge him not I will not judge him for I came not to judge the world but to save the world oh how we Rejoice with that when it says that Jesus did not come to judge us or condemn us but to save the world he that Hearth my words and believeth not I judge him not I don't judge him because he has not come to judge the world but to save the world okay you got your suit belts on you got it on okay hopefully nobody falls off the roller coaster roller coaster he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him oh brother we just read it he's not going to judge me but he came to save the world but brother what is the word telling me but he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one that judgeth him who is that person the word that I have spoken the same Jud the the same word that came to save the world will be the same word that will condemn the world the same Waters that destroyed the world will be the same work Waters that saved [Applause] Noah Jesus said in this moment this day I didn't come to condemn I came in an office to save but there will come a day there will be a judgment and who's going to judge the same word the same gospel that all the apostles have preached it's the same gospel that was preached in this Tabernacle and it's the same gospel will either save you or it's going to judge you the word that I have spoken will judge it shall the same judge him on the last day right now he came to save the world but there will be a day there is a date where there will be judgment and the same word that we have rejected will be the same word that will judge you now we're going to go to the book of Acts acts 17 verse 31 one because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness and so then we see that he has appointed a day which the world will be judged now we're going to go to the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 10 Matthew 10:14 and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you depart out of their house or city shake off the dust off your feet verely I say unto you that on the day of judgment shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day than for that City saying that later day of judgment that judgment that fell down on Sodom and Gomorrah is uncomparable you can't compare it there are some people that think that what happened in Sodom and gomorah was very terrible and it was but what will happen on that other day will won't even compare that's why on this day the only one that's judging herself is the bride with the same word the word is judging the bride a brother or sister take the word and judge yourself because that lat later day will come that appointed day that God has appointed that won't even compare to what happened on Soro don't compare to what will happen on that Judgment Day and that same word that came to save you will be the one to judge you the same Waters that destroy the world were the same Waters that saved Noah the same gospel that all the Pharisees rejected were the same was the same gospel that the 120 accepted he that have an ear let him hear what is the truth the truth is this message is this word and that who he who is of the truth Hearth the truth uh and then we're going to go to the last scripture here Revelations uh chapter 20 chapter 10 verse 10 I recommend that you read the whole chapter but we're going to start off on verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever and then verse 11 and I saw great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and we see here that even the earth and the heavens couldn't stand before that white Throne judgment and they tried to hide but there was no place for them to hide and may God help us brother verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which was The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire and we see that there's a white throne and even the heavens and the Earth were trying to hide hide themselves because they could not stand being before that white throne and the dead were risen small and great and everyone has a book everybody has a book and everything that's written in that book are the works that that individual committed here on Earth I have a book I have a book each and every one of us has a book brother all of this has to be preached because it's Our obligation to prepare God's people everybody has their own book but there was another book called The Book of Life and the Sea and the Sea also has his dead and death and Hell delivered up their dead and each and every one of them was judged and then at the end death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire the Lake of Fire wasn't made for the children of God it's not for us it's for the devil and his angels so then what hope do we have is that you're still alive my brother and sister you're still alive blessed be the name of the Lord those that are dead they have no more opportunity but you are do have an opport and why do you worry about the things that you shouldn't have you should be more worried about your own salvation and not lose your salvation because you can cross that line of Mercy brother you can the prophet tells us that you can lose your salvation even with your suit on even with your Bible Crossing that line of Mercy you lose your your salvation but when I I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ I said Lord I've done so many incorrect things and I'm not worthy to accept you and when I accepted him he took my book he took it that was full of so many incorrect things from the day I was born I was already condemned to death and the prophet tells us that the moment that you were born you already destined to go to hell but when you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Takes that book he takes it and he fills it with blood and he throws it away and your name isn't now in the Lamb's Book of Life because you accepted the Judgment of your day accept your judgment brother but those that don't want to judge themselves on this day Jesus says I won't judge you but the same word will judge you on that day and that word will tell you didn't Luis agil preach to you didn't Bernie Garcia preach to you bober didn't Bob Willer preach you I sent you the prophets I sent you the pastors and what have you done with them it's because I don't accept them but they're my servants to bring forth this word but Lord I don't accept that human flesh it's not that you w't accept it it's not because of the person it's the word that comes for of that human being amen and we're in a throne of Mercy but one day that Throne will turn into and will be a throne of judgment that the Earth the trees and the Rocks they will try to hide because they don't want to be before that white Throne what about us wow may God help us can you go uh can you go to the first slide I've done preaching we have something very special that will happen tomorrow solar eclipse Sol we have a solar eclipse for tomorrow and you can see that that eclipse has roughly around seven stages seven stages and those stages are almost like the seven Church ages the first Bible that God had was the stars and then on August 21st of 2017 we had an eclipse that passed throughout the whole United States Oregon started in Oregon and I believe it ended in South Carolina and you can see it on the map and I believe that almost everybody here has studied this already but those that don't know this in this eclipse it went through every town it went through every town called Salem every town Salem Oregon it went through Salem Oregon um Salem Idaho Salem Idaho Salem Wyoming and Wyoming Salem Nebraska Salem Nebraska Salem Missouri and Missouri Salem Kentucky and Salem Kentucky Salem South Carolina and it ended up coming out through Salem South Carolina and the sun now in English you can say it a little bit s o n because in English s s n and s o n and then in Spanish it's the Sun and and when this eclipse happened the sun the sun Leo was in the constellation of Leo Leo and Leo the Lion Sal passing through Salem oron and then uh at the hour of the Salem Eclipse when the eclipse hit Salem Oregon was the precise hour of the position of the sun of the sunset the sunset in in Jerusalem both cities both were darkened at the same time on August 21st of 2017 and and then on that same day there is a special day of the Jews that it's uh read like this Rose Jes and that day begins on the 21st of August the day of the eclipse and El begins on the uh day 12 of the Jewish calendar and that means uh the Harvest Time has begun the Harvest Time has begun Brothers we're at the end time now the stars are one Bible the pyramids are another and we have the third one right here and then this Eclipse that we will have tomorrow and if you can put the next slide it will begin through Mexico going through Texas and then come out through Canada um and then in Matthew 16 uh verse 4 a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto them but the sign of the prophet of Jonas and what I like at the end of this verse and it says that and he left them and departed he left they want a sign but the Lord left and there's a rumor that the eclipse was supposed to pass through a certain cities called nineve and some of us here know that the prophet Jonas was sent uh to the city of nineve and and to be exact it's not really going to pass through seven nineve but there are seven nineve cities in States and they're going to be very close and seeing that eclipse and the zodiac sign for tomorrow April 8th is going to be Aries but tomorrow on the 8th of April uh it said that the sun will not be in the in the constellation of Aries but it will be still in Pisces Pisces is is the fish Jonah was in the fish and the sun Pisces the s n will be in Pisces eclipse or the Su will be in Pisces going through the eclipse this Eclipse will pass through the cities called nineve but not all of them will be touched by this uh Eclipse but they will be very close but there will be one in special that will hit that Eclipse that will be in Neve indana Indiana it's really tremendous so I started looking at the map of Indiana and Indiana has a lot of towns that are named biblically and I'll leave that for homework so then when the eclipse passes by it's going to pass through n Indiana Indiana can you go to the next one brother and the states that are marked in blue that's where the eclipse will be passing through okay one more brother okay you can see what happened on the 1st of August 21st 2017 and the one that's on the bottom is the one that's going to happen tomorrow and you can see the United States right before us and you can see it as an X and others might say well it looks like a cross and it's just really up to your own perception I believe that it's going to be both things because salvation came to the United States but the United States rejected the prophet of this age and that's why the prophet says that that I indict this nation for rejecting the message of the day and so then the United States is now condemned there's an X that's why the prophet says don't even vote don't even vote everything is now condemned everything is condemned but where that uh very Target of the AES is the Southern Indiana why in Southern Indiana because the prophet was there of Malachi 45 where he brought forth the message of the hour for our day that's where he brought the Seven Seals he brought the messages from that very point from their salvation came and from their condemnation will come amen and I was speaking to someone this week and this man is from Indiana indana in sou South Indiana and he told me look at there at Southern Indiana there's fault there's some faults there and in those Faults Are the reason why we have earthquakes there in Indiana and I asked him in Indiana in indana and Southern Indiana and he said yes and the scientist in Indiana have told all the people of Indiana that sooner or later there will be an earthquake in that in that southern fault of Indiana and literally will break the United States in half and that will cause the United California to sink what and I told him what and this is a man that doesn't even know the message and he's telling me that there ises there that are crossing through southern Indiana and brother [Applause] repents now I don't know how much of the truth that is but you can take it or reject it you can make your own decision here you go to the next one and right here we see where the x is where both of them cross I know you can't really see it very well but there's a lot of small towns there where it's going to cross uh where the eclipse will be Crossing through okay you go to the next one brother okay indana and in this spot where it's going to pass through Indiana Louisville you can see Louisville Louisville you can see the the town of Louisville you can't see it Louisville is right there it's going to be over here on the right side okay okay um lverson it's very close to Jeffersonville at Jeffersonville and so then we see that the eclipse won't really pass through uh Jeffersonville but you can see where it's going to pass through and where you see that green line that's the very center of the eclipse Mon carel and you can see here that it says mount carel can you see it can you can see it okay can you see it okay right there in midd C right there in the very middle Monte carelo it says here Mount Carmel in Indiana Indiana and what happened in Mount car Elijah made that fire come down and he destroyed those false prophets and in this day we have our prophet in mon in Indiana in Indiana car there's a Mount Carmel okay let's go to the next one and here we have another map where the eclipse is going to pass through Indiana okay the last one brother okay there is a town in that section where both of those Eclipse pass through very small town it's not a huge Town very few very small Rapture indana named Rapture Indiana because the Rapture is not something big it's only for the small elect and when I went to the map and I saw the the city it was so small probably less than couple hundred people maybe about 300 people but there where there ex is Rapture Indiana is Rapture Indiana you can take it however you want but the the gospel has been uh preached to us in our day is the rapture going to happen tomorrow I'm not saying that but it will happen are we going to die tomorrow I don't know but we are going to die if the Lord terries but on this day we have received the gospel for our day why won't you stand with me and if the musicians can come up I don't know what kind of Lifestyle you've been living brother or what it is that you're passing through or going through but what is the truth the truth is this message the the truth is this Bible that we've been reading have you accepted it or have you rejected it judgment is passing through the United States and this country is now condemned have you accepted him but brother I come to church every Sunday I have such and such office I do this thing at church we must find our position in Christ my position in church well if I'm fighting for that position in church well I'm going to stay here in church what are you fighting for you have to reflect on your own life this morning don't let it just be another regular service another common Sunday let this Sunday be something different for you don't be accepting or waiting for the man Even though Jesus said he who accepts you accepts me accepts the father but accept the word accept the word brother then what are you going to say on that day it's cuz they didn't tell me the truth they didn't uh tell me about the uh judgment I only knew about that the Lord came to love me and save me but they never told me that the same word was going to judge me that same word brother that you're accepting or rejecting on this hour in this morning we're going to find ourselves before it one day and what is it that you're asking for this morning your salvation I don't want anybody to be lost I don't want my family to be lost I don't want anybody to be lost do you want somebody to be lost brother is that your petition is that your heart's desire if that's your desire say Lord help me and take away that desire from my heart and to be right with you and to be right with your word close your eyes young man or young woman what are you going to decide this morning who is deciding for you why don't you lift your hands up and say Lord in this day I want to accept you I've heard your word and I've been in this message for years and years I've seen many great men preach I've seen so many apostles preach but lord I can't change my life I still have my bad habits my bad Customs oh Lord I want to be a genuine Christian I want to be born again I don't want to be just a professional church member I want to be your son Lord break me this morning in pieces
