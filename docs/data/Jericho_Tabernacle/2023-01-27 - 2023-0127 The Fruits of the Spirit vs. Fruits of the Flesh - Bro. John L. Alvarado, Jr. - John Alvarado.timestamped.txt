[24:44] foreign
[24:52] said
[24:56] [Music]

[27:19] what you put in my heart
[27:23] and not just to just to say but to live

[27:33] put ourselves into service
[27:36] we thank you for everything
[27:40] Muslim our Lord Jesus Christ
[27:44] amen
[27:48] [Music]
[27:58] a little nervous tonight
[28:03] [Music]
[28:06] we can fight in the Lord right
[28:11] first of all I want to open up a
[28:13] scripture for scripture yeah
[28:26] and the the the scripture is a little
[28:29] extensive it's a little long but we're
[28:31] going to read it
[28:35] it's the word of God right
[29:00] okay
[29:01] Envy means murders drunkenness revelings
[29:05] and such like
[29:09] of which I tell you
[29:11] before as I have told
[29:14] I have also told you in time past
[29:18] that they which do such things shall not
[29:20] inherit the kingdom of God
[29:23] indeed us
[29:40] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[29:43] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[29:46] faith
[29:48] is temperance
[29:59] against such there is
[30:05] and they that our crisis have crucified
[30:08] the flesh with the affections with the
[30:12] affections and lusts
[30:20] if we live in the spirit let us also
[30:23] walk in the spirit
[30:27] let us not be Theory the serious of vain
[30:32] Glory provoking one another envying one
[30:35] another
[30:39] Gloria
[30:44] I also want to open another scripture
[30:49] um Corinthians First Corinthians 13 4.
[31:05] and it reads
[31:08] charity suffered suffereth long and is
[31:11] kind
[31:13] charity envieth not
[31:16] charity vaneth not itself is not puffed
[31:20] up La Caridad is
[31:25] [Music]
[31:31] doth not behave itself when seemingly
[31:34] seeketh not her own is not easily
[31:37] provoked thinketh no evil noise
[31:45] Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in
[31:48] the truth
[31:55] bear thought things believe in all
[31:57] things hope with all things endureth all
[32:00] things
[32:00] [Music]
[32:05] charity never faileth but whether there
[32:08] be prophecies they shall fail where
[32:11] there be tongues they shall cease where
[32:14] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[32:27] so those are the first two scriptures
[32:28] that I want to read I'll be reading a
[32:30] little bit a few more scriptures a
[32:32] little later
[32:37] and I'd like to title my my small
[32:39] thought that I that I had
[32:44] it's called the fruits of the spirit
[32:49] versus the fruits of the flesh now
[32:57] um
[32:58] I looked a little bit in a dictionary
[33:02] and I wanted to see what what uh
[33:06] what they said in the dictionary first
[33:08] of all
[33:10] obviously you know we believe the word
[33:13] of God and that was that that's more
[33:15] important to me
[33:19] but what a few of the things that
[33:21] explained to me and you know what I want
[33:23] to speak to the youth and and whoever's
[33:25] here tonight
[33:28] because I do I feel it it's something
[33:31] that we all go through
[33:35] as human beings
[33:37] we all have to go through this we're
[33:40] born speaking lives
[33:44] so I'm going to read a little bit of
[33:46] what I what I read in the dictionary
[33:52] and this is a
[33:55] this is some of the stuff that I that I
[33:57] heard that I read
[34:00] this is the The Works of the flesh are
[34:03] evident
[34:05] is and I'm speaking about the flesh
[34:09] right now I'm not speaking about the
[34:10] spirit
[34:13] um and it reads uh sexual immorality
[34:21] impurity
[34:23] idolatry sorcery
[34:28] enmity Nvidia Strife Plato and and the
[34:33] the one that I want to kind of uh point
[34:35] tonight is jealous
[34:41] um there's also fits of anger yes uh
[34:46] uh rivalries
[34:48] contras the sentience
[34:51] separation divisions divisiones envies
[34:55] El celos drunkenness
[34:58] and all these other things
[35:02] and it also it also said that I just
[35:06] want to say there are some signs of of
[35:08] when somebody's Envy
[35:11] envious
[35:13] and I want to kind of sit on that a
[35:17] little bit
[35:20] um
[35:22] some one of the signs of of somebody
[35:25] that's envious of a
[35:29] Persona you're not happy for others when
[35:32] they achieve success contentos
[35:37] I'm going to say it again you're not
[35:40] happy for others when they achieve
[35:41] acceptance
[35:46] you know we should we should uh
[35:49] here as a family
[35:51] of God
[35:53] anytime that God blesses any of us
[35:57] and I believe He blesses us all the time
[36:00] we should be happy for them
[36:05] you know uh
[36:07] another person's success another another
[36:10] sign that a person is envious and
[36:13] jealous
[36:18] their success makes you feel unhappy
[36:20] Alexa
[36:25] you feel the need to diminish someone
[36:28] else's success
[36:34] you judge others negatively
[36:39] negativa you're happy when others face
[36:42] setbacks
[36:46] I can ask uh I might not even have to
[36:49] ask
[36:53] I know we've all experienced
[36:58] I could say my in my part and
[37:02] um you know my desire is is to serve God
[37:09] I believe everybody here is here for
[37:11] that purpose
[37:14] to serve and love the Lord so
[37:20] I I know I I'm gonna harp a little bit
[37:22] over or over jealousy
[37:26] before before I go into that I I do I've
[37:29] read in the Bible where it says God is
[37:31] is a jealous God
[37:35] he's the reason that he's jealous is
[37:38] because he loves us
[37:42] the only one that can really
[37:45] be jealous is God
[37:49] it's the correct way
[37:52] the other way as our Earthly us being
[37:56] here on the earth
[37:59] that jealousy is is not good
[38:02] that's human jealousy and that's
[38:06] something that we battle every single
[38:07] day yes
[38:11] and it reads uh I noticed something also
[38:14] here says the root cause of jealousy and
[38:17] envy are a connected to a person's
[38:21] inability to see what God has provided
[38:24] in their life is
[38:27] [Music]
[38:34] so I want to repeat that again it says
[38:37] the root cause of jealousy and envy
[38:41] are connected to a person's inability to
[38:44] see what God has provided in their life
[38:46] is
[38:58] I I believe
[39:01] that sometimes that's why we have
[39:03] problems
[39:05] on a personal level
[39:08] personal you know we
[39:11] will hold something a grudge
[39:14] or
[39:16] you know you feel
[39:19] some things you feel negative towards
[39:22] something
[39:24] and that's that's not the correct way
[39:27] you know yes
[39:29] we read we read um
[39:32] actually I have a few definitions of
[39:34] jealousy from the dictionary also
[39:38] definition
[39:40] and I want you to listen to the words
[39:42] that I'm pronouncing
[39:45] attention
[39:47] and tell me if it's not uh describing a
[39:52] human being envious
[39:58] in media covetous
[40:03] resentful grudging
[40:08] the grudginess
[40:14] suspicious
[40:17] distrustful
[40:19] doubts
[40:21] insecure
[40:24] protective
[40:26] defensive mindful
[40:31] ultamente
[40:35] you know I I and um
[40:37] I always would hear my dad
[40:40] would tell us
[40:43] we're we're a mess okay
[40:45] you know we're messed without God
[40:49] you know sometimes you know I if we were
[40:53] to take inventory on our lives
[40:57] and and see if we have any of this that
[41:00] I described
[41:06] those those are those are horrible words
[41:10] you know nothing but negativity
[41:14] negative and negativities just brings
[41:17] more negativity
[41:21] all this describes our fallen nature
[41:25] that we're born with man
[41:31] I believe that everybody on this Earth
[41:33] comes and and has these battles
[41:38] and you know we as Christians should be
[41:41] like teenagers that are in love
[41:48] or a young athlete committed to their
[41:50] game
[41:54] A True Believer who was on fire for the
[41:56] Lord is hungry for his presence
[42:05] and eager to learn and grow
[42:09] and I don't believe that's just for the
[42:11] young people
[42:14] it's for us older I feel like I'm older
[42:21] so you know I always uh I always pray
[42:26] that God doesn't allow me to have any of
[42:28] these
[42:30] um
[42:32] anything to do with this jealousy is
[42:38] without the Holy Spirit
[42:41] and envy are abnormal are not abnormal
[42:47] [Music]
[42:49] see as a human being
[42:52] you know you can experience I had an
[42:56] example to an example
[42:58] um
[43:00] say a brother buys a new car at church
[43:05] you're still driving your clunker yes
[43:11] [Music]
[43:13] and um
[43:16] if you don't have the love of God in
[43:18] your heart
[43:21] you won't be able to see the blessings
[43:22] that God gave that brother
[43:26] are you going to see us through your
[43:28] carnal eyes
[43:32] and that's why I I titled this this
[43:35] small talk
[43:38] you know we will bear fruits
[43:41] they're either going to be carnal fruits
[43:46] or there of the spirit of God
[43:49] and I and I read a few of them of the
[43:52] spirit of God
[43:57] so
[43:58] I wanna
[44:04] I noted also a little bit of something
[44:06] else I wrote I says I'm still on
[44:09] jealousy human jealousy
[44:15] uh people will false Praise You
[44:20] insincere compliments
[44:28] that's I've experienced that your
[44:32] experimentality I'm pretty sure
[44:33] everybody else has it here
[44:38] so
[44:43] another thing is jealous people want to
[44:45] let others know that they are in fact
[44:47] not jealous of you la Gente is
[44:52] I'm not jealous of you
[44:57] it's there yeah they wouldn't say it if
[45:00] they're not so
[45:04] when the good news comes in your favor
[45:10] they do the same thing and acting
[45:13] supported and giving you fake lip
[45:15] service
[45:19] they act supportive
[45:24] and giving you fake lip service
[45:29] then they roll their eyes in the stain
[45:31] once they're all clear oh that's a
[45:34] jealous person
[45:36] is
[45:39] so I think you guys kind of understand a
[45:42] little bit of why what I'm describing
[45:44] right
[45:46] the human jealousy the the the human
[45:50] element the Fallen nature
[45:53] just just a mess
[45:56] without God Amen so now we want we want
[46:00] the answer right
[46:02] I'm pretty sure that everybody knows the
[46:05] answer is
[46:09] and but I I want to read it
[46:12] I read it one of the one of the quotes
[46:15] here that I have a small quote
[46:18] it says
[46:20] uh raising jarius's daughter
[46:25] 69.
[46:27] it says what is the Holy Ghost
[46:29] what is the Holy Ghost yes
[46:42] [Music]
[46:48] is that right
[46:49] that's the Holy Ghost
[46:52] what's a little apple tree
[46:56] how do you know it's an apple tree
[47:00] because it's got apples on it
[47:03] how do you know you got the Holy Ghost
[47:06] because you bear the fruits of the
[47:09] spiritos
[47:12] is that right
[47:13] that's the Holy Ghost
[47:17] amen so
[47:19] this is what we want in our lives this
[47:22] is looking love okay
[47:28] you know it's it's very it's very um
[47:32] when you look at both things
[47:38] what do you want
[47:39] do you want the neck the negative
[47:43] or do you want God do you want it's
[47:46] either the devil or God right
[47:50] so you know my my uh my message is not
[47:54] very complicated I'm just reading what
[47:55] brother Branham has brought in some
[47:57] scriptures
[48:05] that I want I don't want an ounce
[48:08] of jealousy or Envy in my life
[48:12] and I believe I'm not I'm not I'm not
[48:16] I'm not telling anybody here
[48:20] but but if it helps you to to understand
[48:23] that
[48:24] when when you're so negative in life
[48:30] you're going to end up with a lot of
[48:32] problems
[48:35] so I want to read another another little
[48:38] quote
[48:40] and it says uh this one is question and
[48:43] answers on Hebrews one is
[48:50] I said watch
[48:52] bless our thou Simon barjones the son of
[48:56] Jonas
[49:00] Flesh and Blood never revealed this to
[49:02] you
[49:05] amen amen see it has to come spiritual
[49:09] Revelation
[49:12] spiritual Flesh and Blood never told
[49:15] Abel that he was wrong
[49:19] and then in parenthesis it came that he
[49:22] was wrong he made a correction
[49:25] never told Abel that Cain was wrong
[49:36] it was blood
[49:38] we're coming into that question in a few
[49:40] minutes
[49:43] it was blood
[49:45] not fruits that took us from the Garden
[49:49] of Eden
[49:52] it was blood
[49:54] and Able by spiritual Revelation was
[49:57] revealed of God that it was blood
[50:02] and he by faith
[50:05] Hebrews 11 1 says
[50:08] he offered God a more excellent
[50:11] sacrifice than Cain
[50:14] God accepted the sacrifice
[50:20] see he offered it by Faith
[50:24] by Revelation revelation
[50:27] so it's by faith
[50:31] that we're able to to stay away from
[50:35] the
[50:37] the negative jealousy and envy it's by
[50:40] faith
[50:43] reveal that to us
[50:46] as human beings we're we're never gonna
[50:49] attain that
[50:52] without God so
[50:57] never there's another quote that brother
[50:59] Branham also reads
[51:04] it says fruits of the spirit her he said
[51:09] what what she got
[51:12] what is the fruit of the spirit
[51:15] joy joy of her heart
[51:19] know that he's coming soon
[51:22] a man and a man and amen amen amen Peace
[51:26] of Mind tranquilidas why would you not
[51:29] want peace in your in your heart
[51:33] why are the problems
[51:36] because of our carnal
[51:39] eyes foreign
[51:47] [Music]
[52:06] don't make a bit of a difference
[52:10] atomic bombs can fall Las Vegas
[52:13] you can build Rock shelters
[52:18] bomb shelters will
[52:26] [Music]
[52:29] so we want the spirit of God right
[52:36] as well
[52:38] I'm going to read some more quotes
[52:40] that's all I can do
[52:47] I want to thank you Brothers for giving
[52:49] me the opportunity I forgot to get it
[52:54] I was a little nervous but all I'm doing
[52:56] is is reading the word of God
[53:01] this is do you see the carnal comparison
[53:06] can you see the Cardinal church today
[53:09] it's done the very same thing
[53:13] notice now they're they're both going to
[53:16] have profits
[53:19] the only difference
[53:22] was Moses was the prophet of God
[53:27] and his his King was God
[53:31] that's where we got his orders
[53:34] the word of the Lord
[53:37] he also he had a king
[53:43] and that King was balak yes
[53:48] and that's where he got his orders
[53:51] and His blessings
[54:00] come down
[54:02] or Balaam said come down and curse me
[54:05] these people for they cover
[54:07] the whole face of the Earth
[54:10] they just come and lick up everything
[54:12] like ox licks up the grass said come
[54:15] down now and I understand that you can
[54:17] curse you can bless whatever you do is
[54:20] recognized is
[54:39] now we want you to know that this man
[54:41] was a prophet ordained of God
[54:45] but he sold his Birthright for political
[54:48] reasons
[54:51] just as the church did today
[54:54] like Luther Wesley Pentecost Wesley
[54:58] Pentecost and a whole group of them
[55:00] sold it out for polls in their
[55:02] organization
[55:05] organization under God
[55:09] [Music]
[55:15] yeah both prophets were called the man
[55:17] of God
[55:20] and both spirituals
[55:23] notice the difference Moses
[55:38] notice how the spirituals applied
[55:42] and this is where I want to read to
[55:45] prove that the natural is wrong
[55:51] this brother Brian I'm saying this is
[55:56] hear how the spirituals applied
[56:02] to prove that the natural is wrong
[56:07] or natural
[56:10] human beings
[56:13] we're not good without God
[56:17] man amen so we we need the Lord Jesus in
[56:21] our lives every single
[56:23] momento amen
[56:27] you know sometimes I I get up in the
[56:29] morning
[56:32] and I forget to pray and
[56:37] man my days messed up when I don't pray
[56:43] um
[56:44] either I'm late to work
[56:46] [Music]
[56:46] um
[56:49] and it all starts with a prayer in the
[56:52] morning
[56:54] you know it's uh it's important it's
[56:57] important that we do that
[57:02] and um
[57:03] I have another little part that I wanted
[57:05] to read I won't be too much longer
[57:11] [Music]
[57:15] well I just read it I guess I have a
[57:17] little bit of time
[57:21] I'm gonna go to
[57:31] it's in uh does God ever change his mind
[57:33] about his word
[57:35] cambia
[57:38] I can be a cambia cemente a circle
[57:44] and here it is I'm going to read from
[57:47] 122.
[57:51] and it's speaking about Balaam you know
[57:54] the story of Balaam and
[57:56] um
[57:59] now that after he got God's clean-cut
[58:02] decision
[58:05] don't you go no Vayas
[58:09] instead of doing it
[58:12] was the same thing like Cain follow me
[58:16] like Korra
[58:19] he was jealous
[58:21] and he wanted
[58:24] a reason to go
[58:27] anyhow they told us how many times have
[58:31] uh in our lives we know
[58:35] you know when we we sin
[58:37] apecamos we know we sin but if we
[58:41] continue sinning and we know
[58:45] that's iniquity
[58:46] how many times in our lives God is
[58:50] clearly telling us don't do that don't
[58:52] you know don't go that way
[58:55] and you and you want an answer that you
[58:58] want
[59:01] and that's where we fall yeah if we
[59:04] don't trust in God
[59:06] that he's he is a almighty God Kelly
[59:10] says he's the one that answers all our
[59:13] prayers
[59:15] the only one that answers our prayers
[59:19] you know and uh
[59:22] we love the Lord
[59:26] um with all our hearts
[59:28] we're here battling every day every
[59:31] single day we are battling
[59:35] and we've we've got to fight through
[59:37] every inchada
[59:41] and envy Nvidia jealousy celos Strife
[59:47] All Leads
[59:55] so we pray to God we want to uh to live
[1:00:00] in in God's way and
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:05] um
[1:00:06] we want to thank the Lord for that
[1:00:12] I'm going to read
[1:00:15] I think I haven't read this so I'll read
[1:00:17] it it says uh
[1:00:19] Cain's sacrifice to God was not
[1:00:21] acceptable
[1:00:26] where his brother Abel's was
[1:00:29] God clarifies the king that he did not
[1:00:32] give his first and his best to God
[1:00:42] he did not give his best to God and
[1:00:48] um
[1:00:49] I think I'm I'm I'm guilty
[1:00:53] as as a lot of us are I don't know
[1:00:57] not giving God our best
[1:01:02] I've
[1:01:03] I'm determined
[1:01:06] to give God my best
[1:01:11] it doesn't matter if it's um
[1:01:15] well wherever you're at at work
[1:01:20] give God your best
[1:01:22] put God first
[1:01:24] and everything else will be settled
[1:01:28] man amen
[1:01:31] I
[1:01:35] what does it mean to abide in him
[1:01:39] bearing a fruit
[1:01:42] the fruit of the spirits can only come
[1:01:45] forth by abiding in Jesus and walking in
[1:01:48] the spirit
[1:01:54] to abide in Jesus is a very active
[1:01:58] lifestyle
[1:02:02] it means to live in such a way that I'm
[1:02:04] always found to be in Him
[1:02:11] Live according to his words
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:18] I think I've read every all the small
[1:02:21] notes that I had
[1:02:25] what's in my heart is and I think I said
[1:02:28] it already
[1:02:30] do not have one ounce of
[1:02:34] Envy jealousy
[1:02:41] yes
[1:02:45] um
[1:02:48] it's it's something that we all
[1:02:50] battles it's something that we have to
[1:02:53] go through
[1:02:56] and Only God will Deliver Us
[1:03:00] from from the hands of the devil
[1:03:03] the devil has no power
[1:03:08] I don't want to say that he has power
[1:03:12] but we've given him
[1:03:15] the the right
[1:03:18] in our behaviors
