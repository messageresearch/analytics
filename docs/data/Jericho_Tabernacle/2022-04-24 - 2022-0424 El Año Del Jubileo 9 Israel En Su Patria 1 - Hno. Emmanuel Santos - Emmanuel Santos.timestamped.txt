[56:44] heavenly father first of all we give you
[56:46] thanks this morning
[56:48] for the breath of life
[56:51] you're the one who decided
[56:54] that today we're gonna have life
[57:10] i know that there's a god who saves
[57:14] not only saves from the sin here on
[57:16] earth
[57:17] it saves your soul
[57:19] and gives them eternal life
[57:22] help these people or
[57:23] ministers
[57:33] [Music]
[57:51] the third chapter
[57:56] [Music]
[58:06] the word says
[58:18] and to the angel of the church in
[58:19] philadelphia right these things sayeth
[58:21] he that is holy he that is true he that
[58:23] have the key of david he that openeth
[58:25] and no man shut it and shut it and no
[58:27] man openeth
[58:38] i know thy works behold i set before
[58:41] thee an open door and no man can shut it
[58:43] for thou has little strength and has
[58:45] kept my word and has not denied my name
[59:06] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[59:08] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[59:10] no more out and i will write upon him
[59:12] the name of my god and the name of the
[59:13] city of my god which is the new
[59:15] jerusalem which cometh down out of
[59:17] heaven from my god and i will write upon
[59:19] him my new name
[59:22] amen you may take your seats
[59:26] blessed reading of his word um
[59:45] it says i will write upon him the name
[59:46] of my god
[59:50] in the name of my of the city of my god
[59:52] which is the new jerusalem
[59:54] final
[59:56] and at the very end it says i will write
[59:58] upon him my new name
[1:00:03] so the first name that he mentions is
[1:00:06] the name of my god
[1:00:08] and it's only one name that we have now
[1:00:11] the name of jesus christ
[1:00:15] that's the name of god today
[1:00:19] but we know that even brother brahms
[1:00:20] says
[1:00:23] it's god who's going to decide
[1:00:33] so this morning i'd like to enter into a
[1:00:35] new phase
[1:00:37] of
[1:00:38] the year of jubilee is israel it's
[1:00:42] israel in their homeland
[1:00:47] we have a homeland
[1:00:50] which is this earth
[1:00:53] this is where we're going to live for
[1:00:55] all eternity
[1:00:58] now obviously because of the falling of
[1:01:00] adam and eve
[1:01:03] the world fell down to a perversion
[1:01:07] even nature itself fell down to a
[1:01:09] perversion
[1:01:12] and our bodies enter a perversion
[1:01:18] because our bodies were made out of the
[1:01:20] dust of this earth
[1:02:18] that's something that you
[1:02:36] like christ himself came to fulfill
[1:02:39] vamos a leviticus
[1:02:42] let's go to leviticus uh the 25th
[1:02:44] chapter
[1:02:46] verse 9.
[1:03:12] the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on
[1:03:14] the tenth day of the seventh month and
[1:03:16] the day of the atonement shall ye make
[1:03:17] the trumpet sound throughout all your
[1:03:19] lands
[1:03:26] is
[1:03:34] and you shall hallow the 50th year and
[1:03:36] proclaim liberty throughout all the land
[1:03:39] of all the inhabitants thereof it shall
[1:03:41] be a jubilee unto you and you shall
[1:03:42] return every man onto his possession and
[1:03:45] you shall return every man on to his
[1:03:46] family
[1:03:56] a jubilee shall there that 50th year be
[1:03:58] unto you you shall not sow neither reap
[1:04:01] with that which groweth of itself in it
[1:04:03] nor gather the grapes in it of the vine
[1:04:05] un undressed
[1:04:13] for as a jubilee it shall be holy unto
[1:04:15] you you shall eat the increased thereof
[1:04:17] out of the field
[1:04:23] says the breach between the seven church
[1:04:24] ages and the seven seals
[1:04:29] but the law required a kinsmen redeemer
[1:04:34] the law of god required a kinsmen
[1:04:36] redeemer
[1:04:38] you
[1:04:51] it's also connected with our redemption
[1:04:53] christo in la cruz christ in the cross
[1:04:58] share his blood cincuenta vias despues
[1:05:01] 50 days before he resurrected
[1:05:05] after he resurrected
[1:05:19] it's your jubilee
[1:05:48] even though we might not
[1:06:02] you remember
[1:06:30] that he wanted to give all the kingdoms
[1:06:31] to jesus
[1:06:37] without paying the price legally to
[1:06:39] obtain those kingdoms
[1:06:44] now christ could have received those
[1:06:46] kingdoms
[1:06:48] if he would accept what satan was
[1:06:50] offering him
[1:06:53] without pain
[1:06:55] but he paid
[1:06:58] because he does things the right way
[1:07:03] sustains genesis now if you go to
[1:07:06] genesis
[1:07:09] if you read the saints of the old
[1:07:10] testament
[1:07:12] like adam abraham abram uh sarah sarah
[1:07:16] etc
[1:07:17] etc
[1:07:22] because they're preparing for their
[1:07:24] death
[1:07:26] they want to go to
[1:07:40] abram paid
[1:07:42] aquidis
[1:07:46] in the future
[1:07:50] do you see how say they hear the
[1:07:51] scriptures
[1:07:55] para recibirlo tried to try to make him
[1:07:57] break god's plan to receive it
[1:08:03] gave it to him he took him up on the
[1:08:04] mountain
[1:08:09] and try to give it to him without the
[1:08:10] purchase of the blood como connecto esto
[1:08:12] le mano but notice how brother ram
[1:08:14] connects it
[1:08:16] you notice abraham
[1:08:20] when you try to give him the land hello
[1:08:24] with so many shackles of silver antel
[1:08:26] pueblo before the people
[1:08:29] as an ensign common testimonial as a
[1:08:31] witness
[1:08:36] let it be known that this day i bought
[1:08:37] this bearing place
[1:08:40] see he purchased it
[1:08:43] and said to try to give him the kingdom
[1:08:47] which belongs to him
[1:09:48] diablo he didn't receive the free offer
[1:09:50] of the devil
[1:09:53] he knew that he had to pay for
[1:09:56] legal
[1:09:58] to have the legal right upon that land
[1:10:28] even
[1:10:56] the bible is a prophetic book
[1:11:01] and it requires a prophet to get the
[1:11:03] pieces together
[1:11:07] matthew 16 27 says
[1:11:17] the son of man shall come in the glory
[1:11:19] of his father with eight with his angels
[1:11:21] and then he shall reward every man
[1:11:22] according to his works
[1:11:32] i say unto you there be some standing
[1:11:34] here which are not taste of death till
[1:11:36] they see the son of man coming in his
[1:11:38] kingdom oh
[1:11:41] now that's the last verse
[1:11:44] in the next chapter
[1:11:46] uno verse 1.
[1:11:50] jesus pedro a jacob juan sermano
[1:11:56] after six days jesus taketh peter james
[1:11:58] and john his brother and bringeth them
[1:12:00] up onto a high mountain part is
[1:12:08] it was transfigured before him and his
[1:12:10] face did shine as the sun and his
[1:12:12] raymond was white as the light
[1:12:16] i want you to remember that portion
[1:12:18] that his face
[1:12:33] and behold there appeared unto moses and
[1:12:35] elias talking with him
[1:12:46] then answered peter said unto jesus lord
[1:12:48] it is good for us to be here if thou
[1:12:49] wilt let us make here three tabernacles
[1:12:52] one for thee one for moses and one for
[1:12:54] elias
[1:12:57] de luz
[1:13:07] behold a bright cloud overshadowed him
[1:13:08] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:13:10] which said this is my beloved son son
[1:13:13] who i will please hear ye him
[1:13:16] says
[1:13:30] it they fell on their face and they were
[1:13:32] sore afraid
[1:13:36] of teaches us
[1:13:39] that this was the adoption of jesus
[1:13:44] the laws of the old testament
[1:13:47] when a jew a
[1:13:49] jewish father
[1:13:51] was going to adopt his son
[1:13:54] he would do a ceremony for him
[1:13:57] he said put him in a high place
[1:14:00] we'll give them a new garments
[1:14:04] this was the adoption of jesus
[1:14:07] because the sun was like the sun
[1:14:11] and his garment was bright as the light
[1:14:14] este is me just says this is my beloved
[1:14:17] son hear ye him
[1:14:21] in other words what he says
[1:14:24] that has to be done
[1:14:55] then he saw the coming or the rehearsal
[1:14:58] in mattel this is
[1:15:00] how in matthew 16 jesus
[1:15:03] jesus tells his disciples
[1:15:06] there's going to be people that are not
[1:15:07] going to die
[1:15:23] peter james and john vieron une
[1:15:25] they saw a rehearsal
[1:15:29] that's the key
[1:15:32] let us continue
[1:15:36] the first thing he saw
[1:15:38] lo primero que vio en la vinida fue amo
[1:15:41] the first thing he saw in the coming was
[1:15:43] moses
[1:15:48] represent the dead saints that would be
[1:15:49] resurrected
[1:16:05] that's all the six ages that they slept
[1:16:09] six church ages
[1:16:13] but elijah was there el mensahiro de
[1:16:15] lutimo the messenger of the last day
[1:16:18] with his
[1:16:32] all that gathered with him
[1:16:35] pedro jacobo juan fue completa what was
[1:16:38] it his promise to peter james john was
[1:16:40] fulfilled correct that's right
[1:16:50] because he said some standing here will
[1:16:51] not taste of death until they see the
[1:16:53] son of man coming in his kingdom
[1:16:57] and they seen the rehearsal of it
[1:17:43] the divine revelation of the word
[1:17:48] adoption number two
[1:17:52] now he did the same thing to his son
[1:17:55] jesus
[1:17:58] when he took jesus up on mount
[1:18:00] transfiguration
[1:18:04] he took peter james and john up there
[1:18:07] that's three witnesses of the earth
[1:18:12] in la montagna there was jesus moses and
[1:18:14] elijah and god up on the mountain
[1:18:18] remember when a son is adopted
[1:18:20] a ceremony a ceremony a ceremony is
[1:18:22] being done
[1:18:35] and when they look they see jesus being
[1:18:37] glorified before them
[1:18:40] is that right
[1:18:48] what did he do he dressed him on the
[1:18:49] robe of immortality
[1:18:54] he said he and he said he is raymond
[1:18:56] shine like the sun porque jesus
[1:18:59] because jesus was adopted
[1:19:01] there was a ceremony
[1:19:03] there was witnesses
[1:19:07] and he was dressed with a new body the
[1:19:09] echo dc branham in fact brother bram
[1:19:11] says
[1:19:14] that was the body he had after the
[1:19:16] resurrection
[1:19:19] then jesus also there the
[1:19:21] transfiguration in the transfiguration
[1:19:24] he was on the on the top part
[1:19:28] said his face shine like the sun
[1:19:33] now notice all this revelation that god
[1:19:34] gives us there are rehearsals
[1:19:39] that allows us to see
[1:19:41] literally
[1:19:43] things that are literally going to
[1:19:44] happen in the future
[1:19:47] now the age of the open door una
[1:19:50] one of those manifestations
[1:19:53] are the revelations of jesus christ
[1:19:58] and the same revelation that you
[1:19:59] received today islamism
[1:20:16] having the same revelations
[1:20:18] and the same rehearsals
[1:20:23] and why is that because you're going to
[1:20:24] marry jesus christ
[1:20:26] there's going to be a wedding
[1:20:28] and for a wedding
[1:20:58] he was the capstone
[1:21:05] here speaking about the new city where
[1:21:07] we're going to la noire the new
[1:21:09] jerusalem
[1:21:11] necessity
[1:21:21] and the city had no need of the sun
[1:21:23] neither of the moon to shine in it for
[1:21:25] the glory of god delight lighten it and
[1:21:27] the lamb is the light thereof
[1:21:30] so for a light illuminati
[1:21:35] can illuminate a great space come on
[1:21:38] like these lights that we have
[1:22:25] but this one doesn't have anything
[1:22:30] the bible said and there was no temple
[1:22:31] there
[1:22:35] but the lord god and the lamb is the
[1:22:37] temple of it el cordero es la lumbrera
[1:22:40] the lamb is the lion el cordero es el
[1:22:42] temple the lamb is the temple el cordero
[1:22:44] es el no the lamb is the throne el
[1:22:47] cordero es la vida the lamb is the life
[1:22:49] el es ese
[1:23:03] to worship the lord jesus christ
[1:23:13] because the one who we're worshiping is
[1:23:15] already there
[1:23:16] jesus christ will be there
[1:23:48] like peter and john up on top of the
[1:23:50] mountains
[1:23:57] the light covered the top of the
[1:23:58] mountain said and a voice spoken said
[1:24:00] this is
[1:24:42] but with god we're doing a rehearsal
[1:24:45] of what we're going to do there in the
[1:24:46] future
[1:24:48] that's why we have the message
[1:24:52] the message helps us to do our rehearsal
[1:24:56] of
[1:25:05] a wedding rehearsal
[1:25:10] now let's
[1:25:24] after
[1:25:52] and jesus
[1:25:57] what is it to you if he remains to my
[1:25:59] coming
[1:26:02] and the bible says
[1:26:04] that a new doctrine began the
[1:26:35] pultado being buried in san juan bentuno
[1:26:38] bente and saint john 21 20.
[1:26:42] some critics started this in the early
[1:26:44] days
[1:26:46] right while we're hearing this lesson
[1:26:48] let's clean it up in san juan bente
[1:26:50] ventino in st john 2021 jesus
[1:26:54] jesus had met with his disciples
[1:26:58] fed him fish and bread upon fire
[1:27:50] they said that jesus said that he was
[1:27:52] going to live until the coming
[1:27:57] but jesus did not make no mistake
[1:28:01] notice what brother bram says
[1:28:05] right here in revelations the fourth
[1:28:07] chapter
[1:28:09] christ kept his word el trajo juan
[1:28:12] alcielo he brought john up onto heaven
[1:28:17] and rehearsed the whole thing gloria el
[1:28:19] bio la vista anticipated glory he saw
[1:28:22] the preview
[1:28:26] he saw it
[1:28:32] just as though he lived on the earth as
[1:28:34] he saw the whole the whole thing
[1:28:38] the whole church ages
[1:28:40] and the
[1:28:43] and the whole book of revelation
[1:28:46] where john saw and he wrote in
[1:28:48] apocalypses and revelations
[1:28:51] it was the fulfillment of his promises
[1:28:54] of what he said in st john 21.
[1:28:58] to you if he waits until i come pablos
[1:29:06] but he first saw the rehearsal video
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:23] just just like john pedro jacob juan and
[1:29:26] peter james and john just
[1:29:28] you have the rehearsals
[1:29:31] what you're going to do in the future
[1:29:34] why because there's a wedding
[1:29:36] will
[1:29:55] and took him and showed him the whole
[1:29:56] thing before he even died
[1:30:01] just like he lived the whole thing
[1:30:02] through le monstrolo
[1:30:16] right here on the fourth chapter the
[1:30:17] second verse proves it
[1:30:45] just as though as he lived right down
[1:30:46] through the whole thing
[1:30:48] and he saw it all happened
[1:30:53] he just took him up there and showed him
[1:30:54] la pelicula
[1:30:56] the film that he was turning
[1:31:43] el cuerpo de crisis the entire body of
[1:31:46] christ this is called juan for raptago
[1:31:48] so when john was raptured
[1:31:50] and he saw the rehearsal represent
[1:31:53] it represented you represent
[1:31:56] represents what you do
[1:32:08] through the revelations of jesus christ
[1:32:21] when he spoke to him an apocalypse
[1:32:23] cuatro on revelations chapter four oh
[1:32:25] you know i heard a voice
[1:32:28] as of a trumpet
[1:32:33] that's the voice of the rapture us
[1:32:36] you can rehearse that
[1:33:06] and he
[1:35:26] transfiguration
[1:35:30] one has already experimented the voice
[1:35:32] of an archangel
[1:35:34] which was moses
[1:35:36] which is the voice of the resurrection
[1:35:38] experiment
[1:35:40] there was another one who uh experienced
[1:35:42] the trumpet
[1:35:44] which was elijah
[1:35:46] that he was raptured
[1:35:48] that voice
[1:35:52] it's a voice that's also going to call
[1:35:54] us is
[1:36:04] it's not that he decided that he was
[1:36:06] going to condemn los angeles
[1:36:17] that he didn't even know when the great
[1:36:19] earthquake was going to happen
[1:36:21] but at towards the end of the tape
[1:36:24] he was uh inspired to say what he said
[1:36:28] and it was the voice of archangel
[1:36:31] because it's the voice of judgment
[1:36:34] that produces fear
[1:36:36] the fear of god
[1:36:56] that's how the ladies are crying in that
[1:36:58] tape porque los angeles why did it
[1:37:00] happen in los angeles
[1:37:02] because in los angeles
[1:37:32] oneself
[1:37:34] and his judgments for others
[1:37:36] for those who reject
[1:37:39] me
[1:37:43] now i just want to read the quote first
[1:37:44] for brother branham
[1:37:59] speak about jesus rebuking the priest
[1:38:04] and they put him out of their camp jesus
[1:38:08] jesus suffered without the camp
[1:38:14] in other words he was taken outside of
[1:38:16] jerusalem
[1:38:21] and they put them out outside the camp
[1:38:23] way beyond their camp
[1:38:27] that was a crucifixion there more than 2
[1:38:29] 000 years ago
[1:38:32] and observe how the prophet
[1:38:34] gathers it together
[1:38:36] on the next paragraph
[1:38:41] we find out the bible said in the last
[1:38:42] day under the loudest in age
[1:38:48] excuse me in the last day under the
[1:38:49] latter c and age they would do the same
[1:38:50] thing
[1:38:53] they would be put out of the camp our
[1:38:55] observation
[1:39:11] jesus more than 2000 years ago
[1:39:15] he was taken out of the city of
[1:39:16] jerusalem
[1:39:22] with the other ages
[1:39:24] or also
[1:39:39] esta afuera de la di
[1:39:41] it's out of laura
[1:39:42] jesus
[1:39:45] crucification like jesus outside of
[1:39:46] jerusalem when they crucified it
[1:39:50] was once again crucified
[1:40:32] where for jesus also that he might
[1:40:33] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:40:36] suffer without the gate
[1:40:40] now notice what paul tells us what to do
[1:40:43] let us go forth therefore onto him
[1:40:46] and where is jesus
[1:40:49] he's without he's outside
[1:40:51] fuera del campamento without the camp
[1:40:55] bearing his reproach
[1:41:01] for we have no continuing city no
[1:41:03] buscamos la por venir but we seek one to
[1:41:06] come
[1:41:09] that's why there is an age that exists
[1:41:11] as the closed door
[1:41:14] because it's laura
[1:41:16] they cast them out hilo crucification
[1:41:18] and they crucified him again
[1:41:21] the prophet even says it
[1:41:23] is
[1:41:24] that he accused this generation
[1:41:26] crucifixion
[1:41:28] for the second crucifix crucifix
[1:41:30] crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:41:33] because they were crucifying the words
[1:41:36] they were rejecting the word
[1:41:39] and they cast them out of the city
[1:41:42] they cast them out of la racea
[1:42:27] him in the air
[1:42:28] rehearsals
[1:42:30] because there's a wedding
[1:42:33] we require a wedding rehearsal
[1:42:35] jesus is perfect because god is perfect
[1:42:39] everything he does in absolutely
[1:43:09] particular it's a very particular voice
[1:43:13] the voice of archangel trumpetta voice
[1:43:15] of trumpet
[1:43:17] voice of thunder
[1:43:19] it
[1:43:19] is also a voice of a lion
[1:43:51] when jesus used that voice
[1:43:54] de leon the voice of a lion
[1:43:57] why is it a voice of a lion
[1:43:59] in the natural leon a lion
[1:44:02] when he roars
[1:45:28] heaven
[1:45:32] saying i have been both glorified and i
[1:45:34] will glorify it again
[1:45:38] and the people that were there
[1:45:39] avid
[1:45:47] that stood by and heard it and said that
[1:45:48] thundered others said an angel spake to
[1:45:50] him
[1:45:52] it was a voice
[1:45:56] some thought it was a
[1:46:24] is for the person that's on their side
[1:46:28] doesn't feel nothing
[1:46:32] even though we're all here
[1:46:36] god can speak only to one person
[1:46:52] is
[1:46:54] it's the voice of thunder it was
[1:46:56] the voice of archangel
[1:47:00] it's a very strong voice
[1:47:03] but it has to cross the mention it's
[1:47:06] a voice
[1:47:21] it says that jesus christ and a loud
[1:47:23] voice
[1:47:24] in that voice
[1:47:27] have the capacity
[1:47:30] to take him out of that dimension
[1:47:33] and to bring him back to this
[1:47:36] [Applause]
[1:47:48] dimension
[1:47:50] now this voice also
[1:47:52] has the capacity
[1:47:55] that's in the here in this dimension
[1:47:58] and take you to that dimension
[1:48:01] just like the prophet being
[1:48:02] raptured he said he roared
[1:48:06] and he was raptured
[1:48:12] has the capacity to break seals
[1:48:44] and many of the
[1:48:58] out of the tomb
[1:49:06] now i want to read this quote here on
[1:49:08] the the true easter seal
[1:49:39] because he broke the seal off of it
[1:49:43] he broke the seal of death
[1:49:46] he broke the seal of the tomb el rompio
[1:49:48] del infield he broke the seal of hell el
[1:49:50] rompio el del cepulco he brought the
[1:49:52] seal of the graveyard
[1:50:33] as we know the message is is this the
[1:50:35] sign of the
[1:50:36] answer is
[1:50:39] this was the year 62.
[1:50:42] in the year 63.
[1:50:44] that's when the cloud appeared
[1:50:47] but first he had a rehearsal
[1:50:50] he had
[1:51:19] make you get this right
[1:51:21] and then he says
[1:51:24] first there was a blast
[1:51:28] and i thought it sounded like a sound
[1:51:30] barrier
[1:51:33] or we call it when the planes cross that
[1:51:35] sound
[1:51:37] and the sound comes back to the earth
[1:51:40] it shook everything
[1:51:42] it roared todo everything
[1:51:46] um
[1:52:02] i just heard that that great blast when
[1:52:04] it came forth
[1:52:06] and it sound like it came from the south
[1:52:08] for me towards mexico
[1:52:11] but it shook the earth
[1:52:14] and when it did
[1:52:29] it looked like it might have been little
[1:52:30] dots
[1:52:33] there could have been no less than five
[1:52:34] and not more than seven perov
[1:52:38] they were coming in the shape of a
[1:52:39] pyramid
[1:52:41] like these messengers
[1:53:52] the voices
[1:54:06] is
[1:54:20] islamism the same voice

[1:55:58] revelation
[1:56:10] and that's how the lamb opened one of
[1:56:12] the seals
[1:57:09] one of his guards
[1:57:14] and it says one of the one of the four
[1:57:16] beasts saying

[1:57:52] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:57:54] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:57:56] was at word of the sun and his feet as

[1:58:41] roareth
[1:58:42] islamism

[1:59:21] and that's going to determine if that
[1:59:22] voice
[1:59:24] is going to give us rapturing faith
[1:59:28] what's going to cause us to be in the
[1:59:29] great tribulation
