we have nowhere else to go at this moment father as I stand at my post to duty I ask that you put the man aside that you anoint thy tongue father as well as my interpreter here father that you may help him Lord that your people may receive today that you may break break the bread of life for them for you knew before the foundation of the world that we'd be a needy people that we would need you to send us end time Prophet that would bring the message and power and demonstration at this moment Lord [Music] Jesus I ask that every partaker of this service each one that has an ear to hear father that you may give them their heart's desires I ask all this in the name above all names in the name of our precious Lord Jesus Christ we pray I'd like to um title this sermon uh Malachi 456 as um a subtitle would be I will send you Elijah the prophet let's go into the scriptures so we can sit you guys down as it reads in uh verse five behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse amen you may be seated am may God bless the reading of his word now um at this moment I would like to give The Talented musicians and the song leaders um some credit as I feel that they they don't receive enough credit for their efforts and their sacrifices as well as our deacons and our ushers I uh like uh to kindly ask if we can give them a round of applause [Applause] please thank you so much may God bless each and every one of you for each one of you at your post of Duty I want to thank our precious Pastor for the confidence that he has in me I want to thank this amazing Ministry team that I'm privileged to dwell amongst in which uh I know I'm certain I'm nowhere near the Revelation that God has given [Music] them we know that the god of Heaven and Earth who created you and I from the Dust We tread upon works in mysterious ways so incredibly that man can't even begin to imagine how he conducts and operates he's the god of the impossible the same yesterday today and forever I'd like to do something out of the ordinary at this this evening many if not all our church members know at uh 3:30 uh 3:33 a.m. yesterday morning our precious brother Billy Paul brandom departed to a better life Billy BR he wasn't only a brother brandham son but I believe brother bram's best friend being God took his mama off the scene at a very young age brother brandham had to be his mother for some time but brother Billy Paul was a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ since a very young age he'd help his dad pass out prayer cards for the sick and Afflicted and I'm sure much more God bless his soul and comfort the precious Brandon family as a um a way to show condolences we'll give a minute of silence please thank you very muchas I think that uh any servant of the Lord will inherit great things or don't we know that he who he who he seeks the Lord shall have Treasures up in heaven and if we diligently seek him he's a rewarder thank you Father okay all right as we know uh we believe that uh brother brandham was that that Spirit of Elijah what was promised uh from the Lord in the word for his very Ministry is what brought me to this message to the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ which is why I stand where I stand now at my post of Duty and I'm sure that many precious brothers and sisters here and all across the world have received our Lord Jesus Christ through this message it's a tremendous message and such a blessing to each and every one of us that can accept this end time Prophet I believe uh we need to put on the whole armor of God to stand not only through this evil age we are Marching through but in order to fight against spiritual wickedness in high places for we fight not against flesh and blood so why would we need guns and knives for for defense against mortal flesh we need the love of God Almighty in our hearts called the go love for that is what we need in order to cast out demons the the evildoers in this world aren't the people but the the evil spirits that they're possessed by so that Revelation that God is love leaves from here intellectually and drops down into your heart then you really have the Revelation that is what each and every one of of us need and as we know in our hearts is an empty uh compartment that science and Experts of the human an anatomy can't even begin to explain or understand why we have that small Hollow Place in our hearts I'll tell you why that that that uh that the small departments in our heart let's go to a scripture in Revelations 3:20 for our answer and it reads as as it follows he behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and Will O and will Su with him and he with me amen amen your very heart is the door Jesus knocks at usually a door mounted up to a wall usually has some kind of space inside of it and which is where your very in which is the very sole purpose of the door to begin with to store something in and to have access in or out that door so that small compartment that God placed in our hearts is where the very Soul lives there the love for God is found because in the beginning we know the devil chose the mind and and God chose the heart yet we must reach that stature of a perfect man letting the mind of Christ be in you and as Jesus said all that the father has given me I will lose none and though some may astray and backslide it only means you've lost fellowship with your Creator and he will gain you back as he's our designer knowing our minds would be held captive at one point or another by the dirty lying devil for those who he fornew before the foundation of the world World he's designed each and every one of us to seek after him in a specific predestinated time in place he set a certain humble process for each one of us which is justification then sanctification then once he's recognized your faith and we've been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for for the remission of sins then he sends the gift of the Holy Ghost and testified very special occasions I'll send the Treo all all at once sending that precious Soul a heart pounding Supernatural spontaneous blast that'll leave such a blessed child of God not only running to the Waters of baptism with such an incredible testimony setting that precious sister and brother aside to encourage and point every soul they can to Calvary as we all have been commissioned by Jesus whether we be whether we be or not ordained ministers of the Full Gospel of Jesus Christ every true Born Again Christians main objective is to win as many souls to God as possible that we may be found blameless on that great Dreadful day of the Lord now if God promised to send the spirit of Elijah back to the Earth before the return of Jesus and clearly we know he's not only faithful to his word but he's obligated to it if he's uh if he hasn't failed yet he won't fail now he's perfect and his word needs no interpretation he does it himself time after time until all Prophecy of the Bible is fulfilled I believe with all my heart our precious brother William Mar brandham Willam BR was Malachi 456 once again the spirit of Elijah we know that God takes his man but not his spirit and that's the same with Satan now I want to read a sermon of brother Branham where brother Billy Paul and his uncle Donnie Billy Don saw the angel of the Lord or the pillar of fire now the sermon is found in uh 5082 titled the angel and and the commission the 20th paragraph and it reads then watch and see a patient standing here and right in there looks like a above them and I can see the things you hear him tell you've heard it been told of everything they done in their life is that right heard him even repeat the prayer over and and they said to to God isn't that right and all kinds of sins and things that they've done revealed it's perfect every time is that right never fails what does that I just talking just exactly what I'm seeking taking place just what I see that's what I say sometimes I look out over the audience I I can feel something pulling I watch real close then it cuts off it's somebody else on the other side is healed maybe this way and that way maybe I can be real quick real quiet and single out a certain person where it is first thing if I can get that Channel look like I get the rest of them somewhere else not to look you know looking on then it it'll start you can't see a vision rise up then and start like that then now when I looked and seen that I got down on the floor and started praying and as it got closer I knew it was it was the angel of God and I could feel what it was and I said what does the Lord want me to do never said a thing just just long time was standing right near the foot of the bed and and I was kneeling like this and I said oh Heavenly Father what have you sent your angel to your servant for and I said your servant is listening and I waited I knew it was still there but I didn't know why waited I guess five minutes passed I felt it moving closer to me and then it did I just heard that voice sound like way back I could not impersonate the voice if I had to but I heard it just as plain and Audible and audiable as my voice is to you said you're you're confining too much of that gift of healing to perform Miracles it will come to pass that people will not believe you unless there's a miracle performed I said I shall never do that again so help me God went out of the room I raised up I laid down on the bed and there was just above the bed M Milling around like a whole lot of colors in a rainbow Milling around and I looked at it and I laid there a little while I felt relief felt that my sin was forgiven me and I said does my Lord care if my little boy sees you nothing made any noise we had just twin bed we had to every place was taken up for miles around and my o on and we had twin beds in the room and my brother and my little boy was sleeping on the bed next to me the the twin bed and I said Billy Billy Billy Billy he didn't answer I said Donnie Don he didn't answer and I took a i took my pillow watching that and I Knew by not answering I knew it was all right never said yes and I threw my pillow like that and it hit my brother Donnie and I said Donnie he said yes and I said call Billy Billy Billy said oh or or Donnie said Billy your dad wants you just then I said Billy look he looked said what do you want [Music] Daddy about that time Donnie jumped out of bed out of the bed screaming Billy said Oh Daddy Daddy he jumped out of the bed and jumped over said don't let don't let that get me don't let that get me bil and I said honey that won't hurt you said many times I was single five years I've been father and mother mother both to him and just pack his little bottles of milk in my pocket and at night time lay it under my my head to keep it warm so I could give it to him at night his mother died when he was uh only 18 months old and I just had to raise him been both father and mother I said many times when I'm going to be uh specially flying he said Daddy I'm so afraid you're going to go away and never come back to me again I said no honey I I'll be back and I said now honey that's the reason Daddy's going daddy goes that the angel of the Lord that leads Daddy he was just in the room talking to me and I asked him if you could see so you won't worry about daddy and know that that's the angel that leads Daddy that's where that pillar was about like that mingling with colors and went on Donnie he didn't know hardly what to think my my other brother and then it milled around like that went then he told and I want you to get to you people something here that I believe that you people in Cleveland know this you know many of you gets the wrong conception of Divine Healing now this is not a gift to perform Miracles Miracles is a separate different gift from healing did you know that the Bible said do do all have the gift of healing do all have the gift of Miracles see but Miracles are performed that's right it's a miracle every time somebody a vision that happens and tells people what's wrong with them that's a miracle a supernatural that's a miracle but healing now look when when Isaiah went up to heal Hezekiah do you believe God sent him up there do you believe where after he told him he's going to die set his house in order well then when Isaiah went up and pronounced him to be healed it was even three days before Hezekiah regained enough strength to come down off his bed to go in the house of God to go worship okay just one minute minute so brother brandham goes on uh speaking about that this gift that it's not um operated at at his will like that he can't do what he pleases with it in other words that it's all it's all by um by by God's decision that he has no way of of um of controlling it in the way of wanting a um a vision for certain brother or sister or he's not at will to heal anybody he wants but it's what the Lord wants and as you guys know many people would come up to brother brandom practically demanding our precious brother to have a vision for their their very special precious uh family member was probably ill or dying and they would insist that he he'd have a vision for them and as we know he had no control over that it was a gift from God and a blessing to us all right as I find where I'm at and uh you can also find um when Billy Paul um seen the angel of the Lord uh and uh in expectations uh preached in 5174 in paragraph n if you'd like to go and uh read that for yourselves now uh we know that brother brandham and then uh his his brother Donnie um I meant to say uh brother brother Donnie and uh Billy Paul I'm sorry Billy Paul weren't the only ones to witness uh the pillar of Fire or the angel of the Lord but allowed it to be captured by photo after developed uh after the photo was developed as you know it wasn't a visual with the naked eye for all now that's one merciful god for this end time so if God Vindicated this prophet and he had thus sayth the Lord and God back them 110% then what shall be of those who refuse to accept this prophet in this end time I'd like to share one Prophecy from the um from one prophecy the Holy Spirit revealed to brother brandham which in which I believe is for this exact age in time uh dated in 6186 titled the 70 70th week of Daniel paragraph 207 and it reads as so now I predicted and have said I saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in real highly Royal like purple and I got little parentheses down here she was a great ruler in the United States perhaps the cathol Church a woman some woman I don't know it'll be the Catholic church I don't know I can't say only thing I seen I seen the woman that was I seen the woman that was all but this is the woman's Nation this nation is number 13 in Prophecy she's got 13 stripes 13 stars she started 13 colonies 13313 everything is 13 appears in the 13th chapter of Revelations even she is 13 and she is a woman nation and her name is uh Kamala D Harris isala de Harris during her inauguration as a vice president of the United States she was dressed in that exact description so we know that uh even after brother brandham has passed in 1965 that that prophecy he prophesied so long back I believe it might have been in 1933 don't quote me on that but um it has come to pass and that's for this exact time who who can deny this Prophet it's the truth and nothing but the truth sent from God and I heard another um sermon of brother branham's which I didn't find where he uh speaks about this uh woman vice president that he predicted or prophesized of he says right after um this uh Revelation comes comes to be or this prophecy that the destruction of the United States would come now we see the time we're living in I'd like to read more scriptures if I may uh Mark 13 verse 7 and 8 and as it reads you and when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in diverse places and there shall be famines and troubles there these are the beginnings of Sorrows amen amen does not that sound like the times we're living in let's go to St Luke chapter 17 and verse 26 through 30 so that we can get a uh an eye view of where we stand uh in life right now am and uh as it reads and as it was in the days of Noah uh so shall it be also in the days of uh the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven and the destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen let's go to uh St Luke chapter 21 verse 20-2 28 and it reads us see and when and when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter therein for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck if in in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be be trotted down of the Gentiles until the times of Gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves were roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory reading the last verse and when these things begin to come to pass and look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh amen amen now I believe with the the the wars and that going on on the other side of the world that much of this prophecy and and then these scriptures in the Bible here have come to pass and will come to pass no man knows the exact time when the father that are in heaven shall send forth his only begotten son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ if Jesus the son of God that shed his blood as our lamb on Calvary for our very sins and the worlds that only means that his blood is in our is on our very [Music] hands we've all committed murder but you can be forgiven my precious brothers and sisters for that debt he paid that he did not owe because he loved you with no measure when you were in the worst condition of your life did you know right before he gave up the ghost on the cross and said it is finished it was so that you would know that every trial and heartache you would suffer every battle and addiction every sickness and affliction is a finished work because Jesus took your place you shall have what you need if I abide in you and you abide in me and my word ask what you may and it shall be given unto you Hallelujah if you can only believe all things are possible his grace is sufficient and his love is endless if he's identified as the sun in the solar system and the Lamb's wife or the bride of Christ is identified as the moon in the solar system and reflect in in which reflects the sun's reflection therefore shall we be Christlike and be the light of the world as he was when he walked the Earth in such a time as so I'd like to share with you a short Vision that the lord gave me during a a sleepless night of uh weeping and and uh speaking to my Lord the vision was a short Vision but it was uh as um as I explained to you I was standing against this wall here uh again I remember I was not sleeping and uh I was waiting for the song leader to direct me to come up and uh this was before I began to to help behind this Pulpit my uh precious brother Eli would practically beg me to go and help to take part uh in in the service and not just be an usher helping there behind the door and uh I believe it was uh my Lord asking me to partake more that he had a service for me for me to do more work for him for me to speak to his people and that's exactly what I'm doing as we see the the way the the time is around the world World excuse me I had to set a a Time watch time clock that's last time I was uh extended like uh 20 minutes and I tried to put it on vibrate yeah but um as uh we move [Music] on I ask uh each and every one of you do you believe you're at your post of Duty or have you left your post of Duty but don't you know that by serving man you serve God I believe uh there's many things that not not only this church can work on but many around the across the world for every church can use more love as we know love conquers all and if God is love then you know that love conquers all fear and it'll be the exact thing that takes us home for uh his word says that we should love one another for this is how the world will know you're my disciples and anybody with a little spiritual discernment knows when you're a put on as brother brother Brandon would say that the reason why we have weak pulpits is because we uh have um we have a uh uh ministers that don't speak the truth for many times they they're worried about their reputation worried about hurting our precious brothers and sisters but how could you expect the Potter to remold you without being broken down first for it's better to handle this now than when we're before the father because as we know it'll be too late then brother brandham also says that what the world calls great God calls foolish and what God calls great the world calls foolish now I believe that uh each and every one of us love the Lord that's why we come to church and I believe this church should be packed seeing the signs of the time we should be dying to our sins applying the shed blood of of our lamb that God sent for the sins of the world now if we can do that the bride of Christ I believe we'll be closer to going home for many of us uh um profess to be a bride but we continue to do the things that we shouldn't do and uh I always go back when I get a little weary as I spoke to you guys the last time on March 31st the still a still Small Voice came to me and it said through you I bring them in and even more that doesn't sound like something a man tells himself but brother brandham says that God will come to the man like that in his still Small Voice to give him ambition and purpose so that's my exact ammo when I come up here and that was not for you that still Small Voice was for me so that when I stand behind these pulpits I can I can trust in him that I can rely on his promises for if he said that he'd be with me and even in me until the end of the world then you know I'm not alone if he promised to never leave us nor forsake us then you know you're never alone you can be sitting here at these pubes on your own and know that you're not alone God has your position in in the body of Christ many times we'll feel as a penny as they describe lot or some may may uh uh feel as as a as a silver dollar like Abraham but let me remind you that even that penny has its position in the body of Christ CHR and for a brother or sister that are precious to me that doesn't take part in the service that that uh comes and and honors and Praises our lord I can't call them a bench warmer because if the stars were made to worship God so is that precious brother and sister who are we to call them Benchwarmers we need to hold our tongues many times we speak out of hand or in better terms we get out of order but by your very actions that you live by it shows your belief for if you say Amen to a scripture but yet for example you still keep cutting your hair obviously my precious sisters and that speaks louder than words is that a hypocritical condition with all the respect it is and as I take my stand I won't be a weak Pulpit I'll stand for the word of God if garments pertain to a man and a woman wears them you are an abomination in the sight of the Lord and as I follow the lord I ask that you follow me because I'm serving him I'm at my post of Duty and he's working with me as he's working with you we're all God's work in progress no man is perfect whether they've seen the world or been in the world have done drugs have been alcoholic or they've never been it only means as one of my my favorite parables in the Bible where where Jesus uh speaks about the Creditor if if if a um a creditor forgives one that owes 500 and forgives another for 50 which one loves him more the one that was forgiven for more so after all my filth and and perversion that I was in the world in the pathetic condition I was in it only tells me I love the Lord more more than the man that's never seen the world that's never picked up a can of beer because he's forgiven me for more and just as that 99 that he left he came for the lost sheep for each one of us because not only have many of us Sinn but we were born in by sexual desire automatically throwing us under that so I I I feel that no man sh shall shall um shall be a uh as as in a a state of glorifying themselves or feeling that they're more worthy than another I believe that the bride of Christ is not going to going to um uh have a uh different uh see different qualities in in brothers or sisters that that they'll be able to sit with a a a poor man that comes off the street that you won't look at him up and down like he's filth cuz at one point your heart and your condition was in the same way in a pathetic condition but God has touched you and I I tell you right now if uh you're seeking more of the Lord you must cry out to him you see the signs of the end and yes we know that man don't know the time nor does Jesus Christ but we know that today we're one day closer and if we're still living in that pathetic condition doing those things that we shouldn't be watching those things that we shouldn't be watching and we profess to be the bride of Christ I believe you're holding back the bus it's time to wake up discern the signs of the end for we can discern the face of the sky but not the end Jesus calls him Hypocrites the bride of Christ is not a hypocritical person um people let's um stand so we can get to closing the musicians May U come forth bow your heads and uh close your eyes please oh gracious Heavenly Father the author of everlasting life Giver of every good gift oh Father I I took my stand here Lord Jesus at this moment Lord I pray father that at least one precious brother or sister may have received for he that has an here let him hear what the spirits have to say to the churches oh Father God help us get ready Lord help us father put that whole armor of God on that we may March through these trenches knowing that you are with us father knowing that we need to die to this world pick up our cross and continue to fight for you know father each and every heart in here father each and everyone crying out for a loved one that aren't even close to your feet my Lord Jesus I ask father that each and every heart's desire here that they may bring it before you my Lord that you may give them their heart's desire and each and every one of us a closer walk with you I thank you for all my Lord
