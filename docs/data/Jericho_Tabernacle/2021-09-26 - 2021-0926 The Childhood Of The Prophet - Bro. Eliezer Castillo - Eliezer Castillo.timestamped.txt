[38:23] the reigns and control of this church
[38:31] hermano johnny alvarado ever since we
[38:33] started with this project even in the
[38:35] mind of our brother johnny alvarado
[38:38] [Music]
[38:39] challenge pero emos
[38:44] it's been a challenge but we've been
[38:46] learning and also making mistakes
[38:50] and we'll continue making mistakes
[39:08] the only reason and why we're here is to
[39:10] be able to glorify god and to exalt his
[39:25] we also appreciate the vote of
[39:26] confidence of our pastor the parents and
[39:28] the children to be able to start on this
[39:30] project
[39:42] it wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for
[39:44] the the great amount of help that we
[39:45] received from several brothers and
[39:47] sisters and young people that have been
[39:49] helping us
[39:52] and of course we're all learning
[40:01] [Music]
[40:08] of our christian nation
[40:14] and practically in the future they will
[40:15] become the pillars of this church
[40:21] i'm very pleased with that because we're
[40:23] starting with them at such a young age
[40:32] as you can see here in the back we have
[40:33] a setup a decoration that we have put up
[40:36] practically
[40:45] basically we'll be talking about the
[40:46] type or the format that we want to uh
[40:49] implement
[40:56] and it's a format that we can change but
[40:58] we'll need your help for that

[48:43] but let me introduce you to a brother oh
[48:46] yeah because i got a lot of questions
[48:49] he can answer all the questions for you
[48:52] introduce him
[48:54] i'm getting to that now
[48:56] his name is brother eli costillo brother
[48:58] eli god bless you brother yes god bless
[49:00] you brother god bless you god bless you
[49:03] god bless you
[49:05] so you had uh questions about brother
[49:06] branham yes yes yes i have questions
[49:09] about brother branham i asked that i
[49:11] asked brother tim the questions and i
[49:13] believe you heard some of the questions
[49:15] right yeah yeah i heard them i could
[49:17] answer a few questions
[49:19] um but i want to ask you a question
[49:22] what made brother branham so special
[49:25] i want to really know
[49:27] well it's the same way he we are all
[49:30] special
[49:31] it's because jesus christ loved us and
[49:35] he knew us amen
[49:37] amen and
[49:39] and brother branham he had a great big
[49:41] responsibility
[49:43] he had a big responsibility to bring us
[49:46] the word of god
[49:47] and to show us
[49:49] what the word of god truly was
[49:51] so that was his great responsibility
[49:54] but
[49:55] you're just as special as brother
[49:57] branham
[49:58] and it's not because of your great big
[50:00] responsibility but it's because jesus
[50:03] knew you and he loved you okay
[50:06] amen
[50:07] maybe
[50:08] maybe you have a little responsibility
[50:11] amen maybe your responsibility is to
[50:13] clean your room
[50:15] maybe every day you got to make your bed
[50:18] that's your responsibility
[50:20] maybe you have a
[50:22] gift that the lord has for you maybe a
[50:26] gift to i heard a brother play the drums
[50:28] really really well
[50:30] god bless you brother
[50:33] um i heard you i heard little brothers
[50:36] singing really well and the sisters sing
[50:38] their specials
[50:39] that's that's a gift
[50:42] and god has given a gift to each and
[50:44] every one of you
[50:46] but what really makes you special is
[50:48] because jesus loves you yes
[50:51] do you do you know
[50:53] when brother banham call or when god
[50:55] called brother branham
[50:57] when he was little was it when he was a
[51:00] good boy
[51:02] maybe when he started to think about
[51:05] serving the lord
[51:08] the bible says in jeremiah 1 5 it says i
[51:13] knew you before i formed you in your
[51:16] mama's tummy amen amen so he already
[51:19] knew
[51:20] us before we were in our mama's tummy
[51:24] he knew us before
[51:27] we were even born
[51:29] that's when he knew us
[51:31] and that's when he already loved us amen
[51:34] so now we know that brother branham
[51:37] wasn't called when he was a good boy
[51:40] because i know sometimes
[51:42] we're not all good boys or good girls
[51:46] but god calls us either way
[51:49] no matter what if we're good or bad god
[51:52] calls us and he's the one that begins to
[51:55] deal with us in our lives
[51:57] do you know when brother
[51:59] god showed up to brother branham
[52:02] the first time does anybody know
[52:06] what when
[52:10] that's a good answer that's a good
[52:11] answer but it was actually before he
[52:14] preached
[52:15] there was
[52:17] when brother branham was born
[52:19] that was the first time god
[52:22] showed up to brother branham
[52:24] it was when he was born in a little log
[52:26] cabin
[52:28] in a little log cabin
[52:30] he was born
[52:32] and brother branham says that outside
[52:34] the window in a little bush there a
[52:37] robin started to sing
[52:40] and
[52:40] it was early early in the morning and
[52:42] the robin started to sing
[52:44] and his father charles branham he wanted
[52:48] to open the shutters to the windows
[52:50] so when he opened the window
[52:53] there was a light
[52:54] that came into the room
[52:56] do you guys know that
[52:58] yes there was a light do you know what
[52:59] that light was
[53:02] what was the light man i like you
[53:04] brother
[53:06] it was jesus
[53:07] we have two pictures up here do you know
[53:10] where jesus is at can you guys point
[53:12] where jesus is at oh i like that some
[53:15] people point right here and some people
[53:17] point there you guys are correct
[53:19] jesus is right here
[53:21] and jesus is right there on top of
[53:23] brother branham
[53:25] that light that's the very light that
[53:28] came into the cabin
[53:30] and he went over brother branham
[53:33] so even when he was born god already
[53:36] knew who brother branham was
[53:40] and it's not because of his great big
[53:42] gift what makes him special but because
[53:44] jesus knew him
[53:47] um so
[53:48] god
[53:49] will show up and will be with us when we
[53:52] are good and when we are bad
[53:55] i know for a fact for me
[53:57] sometimes i'm not always good
[53:59] sometimes i'm
[54:01] i'm bad when i was a kid i sometimes i
[54:04] was a bad boy
[54:05] but was where was god when i was a bad
[54:08] boy
[54:09] he was still there
[54:11] there was one time when brother branham
[54:13] he i believe he was two or three years
[54:15] old he had a great big rock
[54:18] and he was throwing this great big rock
[54:21] in a puddle trying to show his brothers
[54:23] how strong he was he was trying to show
[54:26] his little brother
[54:27] and when he was throwing that rock he
[54:30] heard that same bird that you saw up
[54:32] here on a tree
[54:34] he's heard that bird sing sing sing just
[54:37] as loud as you can hear it seeing and
[54:40] when brother branham looked at that bird
[54:42] he saw the bird and the bird flew away
[54:45] and when the bird flew away brother
[54:47] branham that was the first time brother
[54:49] branham heard god's voice and the voice
[54:53] told him that he was going to live in a
[54:55] city close to new albany
[54:59] so that was the first time brother
[55:01] branham heard
[55:02] god heard jesus christ it wasn't when he
[55:05] was praying
[55:07] it wasn't when he was singing in church
[55:09] but he was just plain as a little boy
[55:12] god was there with them
[55:15] and when he was seven years old brother
[55:18] branham was playing marbles who still
[55:20] plays marbles here
[55:21] do you guys know how to play marvels
[55:23] what is it today you guys love to
[55:25] play with legos huh
[55:28] yeah who can raise your hand who loves
[55:30] to play with legos maybe he was playing
[55:32] with legos
[55:34] but back then they were marbles he loved
[55:36] to play with marbles
[55:38] and he was seven years old and when he
[55:40] was playing with marbles with his
[55:41] friends
[55:42] something began to happen he began to
[55:45] have a vision
[55:47] and the vision
[55:48] was a vision of a great big bridge it
[55:51] was called the municipal bridge it's
[55:53] that bridge right there
[55:55] and they were building that great big
[55:58] bridge and he saw 16 men lose their
[56:00] lives
[56:02] in that vision and that was the first
[56:04] time brother branham ever had a vision
[56:07] he was seven years old
[56:09] can somebody raise their hand who's
[56:11] seven years old
[56:13] seven years old seven years old who's 10
[56:16] years old
[56:18] who's under 10 years old
[56:21] all right so we have a lot of young ones
[56:23] here today
[56:24] that's when brother branham called him
[56:26] when he was just a little boy
[56:28] so you don't have to be a older preacher
[56:31] like me
[56:32] or just like your mom or just like your
[56:34] father but god has already called you
[56:36] now
[56:38] he'll call you whenever you're playing
[56:39] with your legos god is there watching
[56:42] you and he's with you whether
[56:44] you're a good boy or a bad boy god is
[56:46] always watching
[56:48] and that's a good thing to understand
[56:51] so whenever we're about to do something
[56:54] wrong or when we're about to steal or
[56:56] lie we got to remember you know what
[56:59] god is there with me
[57:02] even if i'm crying
[57:04] or if i'm happy
[57:06] i got to remember god is always there
[57:09] with me
[57:10] amen can i hear amen from the young ones
[57:13] amen i like that i like that one more
[57:17] time amen amen
[57:20] he was seven years old and you know
[57:23] he was seven years old
[57:25] whenever his dad told him to help him
[57:28] pack some water
[57:30] for for his still
[57:32] but brother branham he wanted to go
[57:33] fishing
[57:34] he wanted to go fishing he was seven
[57:36] years old and he wanted to go fishing
[57:38] with his friends at the ice pond
[57:40] so he went and he ran to his dad and he
[57:42] said daddy daddy can i go can i go
[57:45] fishing
[57:46] and his dad said nope we have to work
[57:48] today
[57:50] and what did he do was he happy and he
[57:52] said okay
[57:53] no he started crying and started kicking
[57:57] the dirt
[57:58] and sometimes we act that way right
[58:00] sometimes when we don't have our way it
[58:03] makes us feel sad and makes us cry
[58:07] but that's normal but while he was
[58:09] crying and he was there stomping his
[58:12] feet
[58:14] i want you to hear brother branham what
[58:16] happened
[58:17] let's see
[58:21] and i've turned to look and about
[58:23] halfway up that tree was another
[58:25] whirlwind caught in that tree just going
[58:28] around and around moving those leaves
[58:30] well i thought nothing strange about
[58:33] that because it just
[58:34] in that time of year and the autumn why
[58:37] those whirlwinds come little we call
[58:39] them whirlwinds
[58:41] and they uh
[58:42] and they pick up dust you see them on
[58:44] the desert like that same thing so i
[58:47] watched but it didn't leave off usually
[58:49] just to puff for a moment and it goes
[58:50] but it had already been in there two
[58:52] minutes or more
[58:54] well i started up the lane again and i
[58:56] turned to look at this again
[58:58] and when it did
[58:59] a human voice
[59:01] just as audible as mine is said don't
[59:04] you never
[59:05] drink
[59:07] smoke
[59:08] or defile your body in any way there
[59:11] will be a work for you to do when you
[59:12] get older what like to scared me to
[59:16] death would have scared you if you would
[59:19] have heard a man in a tree
[59:22] yeah
[59:23] that was scary but it was god watching
[59:26] over brother branham
[59:28] just like he watches over us
[59:31] even when we're crying
[59:33] even when we don't want to listen to our
[59:34] parents god is there
[59:37] and maybe he's in the tree
[59:39] or maybe he's there around the corner
[59:41] and he's watching and he wants wants to
[59:44] see what we're doing but
[59:46] god told him
[59:48] never to drink
[59:49] never to smoke or defile his body in any
[59:53] way
[59:54] why why did he tell him to to do that
[59:58] why brother
[1:00:00] the one playing the drums
[1:00:08] i like that you shouldn't do those
[1:00:10] things when you're a christian
[1:00:12] yeah
[1:00:13] because he had a work for him when he
[1:00:16] was older
[1:00:18] so god
[1:00:20] he has a purpose and a work for each and
[1:00:22] every one of you
[1:00:24] so god wants us to live the best kind of
[1:00:27] life for him
[1:00:29] he wants us to live 100 percent for him
[1:00:32] because he has a work and he has a
[1:00:34] purpose for us
[1:00:36] do you believe that
[1:00:38] he wants you to be the best boy and the
[1:00:40] best girl in school he wants you to do
[1:00:42] the best for your parents because he has
[1:00:45] something
[1:00:46] awesome for you guys and
[1:00:49] and and so he tells them not to drink
[1:00:52] smoke or defile his
[1:00:54] body so brother branham
[1:00:57] no matter what god was always with him
[1:01:00] you know there was one time brother
[1:01:02] branham
[1:01:04] he tried to smoke
[1:01:06] he finally picked up a cigarette and he
[1:01:08] tried to smoke
[1:01:10] guess what he heard whenever he began to
[1:01:13] smoke
[1:01:16] go ahead brother
[1:01:21] and he
[1:01:22] remembered when that whirlwind came
[1:01:27] he heard the voice never to smoke
[1:01:30] so that whirlwind caused him to remember
[1:01:33] never to smoke
[1:01:36] and whenever he tried to pick up a
[1:01:39] a bottle to drink
[1:01:40] guess what he heard
[1:01:43] he began to hear a whirlwind
[1:01:46] and he remembered
[1:01:48] never to drink never to defile his body
[1:01:51] because god was there and he was
[1:01:53] protecting him
[1:01:55] that because jesus loves us
[1:01:58] that's why you're special because jesus
[1:02:00] loves you and jesus wants you to live
[1:02:03] the best kind of life for him and be the
[1:02:06] best son or daughter for your your
[1:02:08] parents
[1:02:09] so that you can have an awesome work to
[1:02:12] do
[1:02:13] whether it's a great big work like
[1:02:14] brother branham or it's a little tiny
[1:02:17] work
[1:02:18] god is going to protect his gift amen
[1:02:21] amen amen can you guys say amen
[1:02:24] amen amen finally
[1:02:27] brother branham he wanted to give his
[1:02:29] heart to the lord
[1:02:31] but he didn't know where to go
[1:02:33] he said i don't know where to find god
[1:02:35] well god was in the tree
[1:02:38] god was in the cabin
[1:02:40] god was there when he was about to smoke
[1:02:43] but he couldn't find him
[1:02:45] so the best thing he could do was write
[1:02:48] god a letter
[1:02:50] and he wrote him a letter and he put it
[1:02:52] on a tree
[1:02:54] and the next day he said well maybe
[1:02:58] god isn't over there i've never seen god
[1:03:00] walk over there in the woods so he
[1:03:02] looked back and he said you know what
[1:03:04] i'm going to try to do i'm going to try
[1:03:07] to pray
[1:03:09] prayer is a
[1:03:11] very great thing and it's very powerful
[1:03:14] that's where you can talk to with god
[1:03:16] you can talk with him when you're going
[1:03:18] to school when you're having a hard time
[1:03:21] you could talk to him and you know if
[1:03:24] you have faith god will answer your
[1:03:26] prayers
[1:03:27] so brother branham he got on his knees
[1:03:30] and he
[1:03:32] folded his hands like that and he said
[1:03:33] maybe this is how i'm supposed to do it
[1:03:37] and he began to pray to god as best as
[1:03:40] he could he didn't know how it was his
[1:03:42] first time
[1:03:43] and no answer
[1:03:45] he said
[1:03:47] well maybe i'm doing it wrong maybe i'm
[1:03:48] supposed to go like this and pray
[1:03:51] he began to pray to god and
[1:03:54] no answer
[1:03:56] and he began to get very very
[1:03:58] desperate and he began to cry and he
[1:04:00] said lord i need you
[1:04:02] i need you in my life
[1:04:04] and guess what he saw whenever he opened
[1:04:07] his eyes
[1:04:09] he saw that same light jesus christ that
[1:04:13] was with them all the way when he was
[1:04:16] born
[1:04:17] jesus christ was there
[1:04:20] that same light was there with him and
[1:04:22] he answered his prayers
[1:04:25] and when he began to cry out and pray
[1:04:28] more and then he began to feel different
[1:04:31] you know why
[1:04:33] because
[1:04:34] that whirlwind or that light wasn't in
[1:04:36] the tree no more
[1:04:38] it wasn't in the cabin anymore
[1:04:41] it wasn't on the bush
[1:04:43] at the cabin anymore
[1:04:45] but that light was in him now
[1:04:48] jesus christ
[1:04:50] can be in you and he can guide you
[1:04:52] wherever you go
[1:04:54] whatever you do god can be with you not
[1:04:57] just in a tree
[1:04:59] not just around the corner but god can
[1:05:01] be in you
[1:05:03] and wherever you are you pack jesus
[1:05:06] christ with you and you're never alone
[1:05:08] even though you're sad you got to
[1:05:10] remember jesus christ is with me
[1:05:13] and you know what he began to jump and
[1:05:15] he began to shout that same
[1:05:18] fire
[1:05:20] that same thing that guided him all the
[1:05:22] way to the beginning is with him now and
[1:05:24] can be with you
[1:05:26] all you have to do is accept jesus
[1:05:28] christ and allow him to be in your life
[1:05:31] every day
[1:05:33] every day talk to him every day if you
[1:05:35] can read your bible every day just have
[1:05:38] a good communion with christ
[1:05:41] and whenever jesus christ was in him
[1:05:44] he began to jump he began to shout he
[1:05:47] went and he told his mama and his mama
[1:05:49] said oh you you're crazy because he was
[1:05:52] so excited he was so happy because he
[1:05:55] had jesus christ in his life he went to
[1:05:57] the railroad and he would jump up in the
[1:06:00] railroad feeling like he was going to
[1:06:02] fly because jesus christ was not only in
[1:06:06] a tree but he was in him
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] amen let us stand to our feet
[1:06:16] we're going to pray
