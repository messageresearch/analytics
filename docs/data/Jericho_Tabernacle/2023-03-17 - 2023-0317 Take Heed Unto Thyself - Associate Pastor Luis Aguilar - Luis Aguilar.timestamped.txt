[32:07] [Music]
[32:14] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[32:17] which was given thee by prophecy which
[32:19] the laying on of the hands of the
[32:22] Presbytery now this is
[32:31] meditate upon these things give thyself
[32:34] holy to them that thy profiting may
[32:37] appear to all
[32:38] says
[32:43] take heed unto thyself and onto the
[32:47] doctrine continuing them for in doing
[32:49] this Thou shalt both save thyself and
[32:53] them that hear Thee thank you is
[33:05] may the Lord bless the wording of his
[33:07] word
[33:11] once again it's really nice to see all
[33:13] of your faces
[33:18] amen tonight if we could place a little
[33:21] title to our message this evening
[33:27] we would like to put it as take heed
[33:30] unto thyself
[33:34] amen we hope that uh the young people
[33:38] brought their notes and ready to to to
[33:41] to read or listen to God's word
[33:47] you know I I tell this as a joke
[33:50] sometimes and I know this is not the
[33:51] place to joke
[33:56] but I tell the young people I said you
[33:58] know one of the good help I think to
[34:02] help you when you know you're in service
[34:08] you don't fall asleep
[34:14] and you can at least write something
[34:16] down and you can not fall asleep
[34:20] [Music]
[34:22] especially when you're you're hearing a
[34:24] boring preacher like me
[34:29] but this this evening we like to put it
[34:33] as take heed unto thyself
[34:39] you know that's a very interesting
[34:42] subject
[34:44] that the Apostle Paul is telling Timothy
[34:49] so if we break this down verse by verse
[34:54] we're going to be we're going to read a
[34:56] good handful of scriptures
[34:59] in his verse it says let no man the
[35:02] spies thy youth this is
[35:05] and I know I I'm when I was in school I
[35:10] like a lot what is English class but it
[35:12] was literature and writing and so forth
[35:18] so I really learn that every comma and
[35:23] so those little things like that means
[35:25] something
[35:30] you read it in a certain way
[35:35] you don't just read it just read it and
[35:37] read it and read it
[35:39] but you give it when you see a comma you
[35:42] give it a pause
[35:46] and it adds to what it's saying
[35:51] so may the Lord help us how to read
[35:55] God's word
[35:58] so here it says let no man the spies
[36:05] so in other words they're saying let no
[36:07] man look down on you because you're
[36:09] young
[36:14] you know there's something special about
[36:16] you even if you're young
[36:20] but there's there's there's also a
[36:23] scripture
[36:24] that the Apostle Paul says
[36:27] don't reject the old man
[36:32] don't reject the Elder no rechases we
[36:36] need the elders
[36:38] we need those with the I could say with
[36:42] the white hairs on their heads
[36:46] so here it says let no man look down on
[36:49] you because you're young
[36:54] but pero there's a scripture that says
[36:59] don't reject the elders
[37:05] to the Believers
[37:15] in conversation
[37:17] in charity in Amor and
[38:16] you can take it and those both ways and
[38:19] conduct
[38:30] when you finally let your guard down how
[38:32] do you Converse
[38:39] we have to be an example
[38:43] Even in our conversation
[38:47] that we need God in us
[38:52] that when we're having a conversation
[38:56] and we stay away from the dirty jokes
[39:03] from a dirty group chats
[39:08] because if you're in the group chat okay
[39:14] and someone uploads an appropriate photo
[39:18] or says an appropriate
[39:28] because you're in the group chat foreign
[39:37] [Music]
[40:20] what God has called us to do
[40:22] but I said Paul is telling Timothy
[40:27] neglect not the gift that is in you know
[40:32] it's already in you God give it to you
[40:35] God gave it to you
[40:37] you know maybe there's some somebody in
[40:40] here
[40:41] what says brother I don't have a gift
[40:45] I don't have a calling
[40:48] yeah yes yes you do
[40:51] now all these little gifts
[40:54] if I can say like this
[40:59] playing an instrument
[41:02] of interpreting and so forth
[41:06] these are all attributes
[41:09] of the gifts
[41:12] amen amen so there is a gift
[41:15] what is that that gift
[41:18] it's the gift of of the Holy Ghost
[41:23] if you obtain the gift of the Holy
[41:26] ghosts
[41:29] you have a gift
[41:32] amen amen so you can't say I don't have
[41:35] a gift
[41:37] you can't say I don't have a calling
[41:40] because God called you
[41:43] well brother the guy hasn't called me to
[41:45] anything else
[41:48] but he called you to his presence
[41:52] he called you to his kingdom
[41:55] that's the best calling you can ever get
[41:58] in my opinion in my opinion
[42:01] that's the best gift you can ever get is
[42:05] the Holy Ghost
[42:07] and so when you have the Holy Ghost
[42:12] can maneuver those vocal cords to make
[42:15] you sing
[42:19] amen God can make those fingers so
[42:22] flexible so you can play the piano
[42:25] flexibles
[42:27] well brother that's impossible
[42:30] for the Holy Ghost say nothing
[42:32] impossible
[42:34] but you have to get that gift of the
[42:37] Holy Ghost
[42:41] in verse 15
[42:43] it says meditate upon these things
[42:48] now one word in Spanish it says get busy
[42:51] or occupy yourself
[42:55] in English it says to meditate to study
[42:58] it
[43:00] that's the same thing God told Joshua
[43:03] yes
[43:05] meditate upon these things
[43:08] stay on them
[43:18] you just follow me we're going to get to
[43:20] something in a little bit
[43:22] there's a reason why we need to get busy
[43:25] in God's word
[43:29] we need to meditate on God's word
[43:33] and notice what it says and it says and
[43:36] give thyself holy to them
[43:41] completely
[43:43] to God's word
[43:45] not just a portion of yourself
[43:48] not just a certain fraction of yourself
[43:53] give thyself holy to it
[43:57] how many can do that
[44:00] but it's so hard
[44:03] but if you notice something if you
[44:05] surrender yourself holy to God's word
[44:10] amen
[44:35] he says now on 16.
[44:39] here's the subject
[44:41] take heed on to thyself
[44:45] amen take care of yourself
[44:48] now we have to take things also like in
[44:51] the spiritual uh
[44:54] we have to take him in the natural
[44:57] take care of yourself
[45:00] take care of your testimony
[45:02] take care of who you are
[45:05] you got to take care of yourself
[45:09] now you know when I was a little boy
[45:12] does every single one of you you're all
[45:14] infants at one time
[45:19] there was a time in our lives where mama
[45:22] had to give us a bath
[45:27] there was a time where Mom had to give
[45:29] us a spoonful to our mountains
[45:33] but then we have to grow amen
[45:59] now and it says and it is unto the
[46:03] doctrine the teachings to the word of
[46:07] God take care of the teachings
[46:11] and continue in them
[46:15] for in doing this
[46:17] thou shall save both thyself and them
[46:20] that hear this
[46:23] now let's go to Deuteronomy
[46:29] um
[46:30] Deuteronomy the fourth chapter cuatro
[46:36] fifth verse
[46:39] here's Moses is one of the one of the
[46:42] one of the books that Moses wrote
[46:46] Deuteronomy the fourth chapter and the
[46:49] fifth verse
[46:51] this is like this
[46:53] behold I have taught you statues and
[46:56] judgments
[47:00] even as the Lord my God commanded me
[47:03] that ye shall do do so in the land
[47:06] whether you go to possess it
[47:09] is
[47:14] now if you notice what Moses is saying
[47:17] he said I have taught you statues
[47:23] as the Lord God commanding me to teach
[47:25] you
[47:26] so you can go and possess the land
[47:30] guys
[47:34] now keep therefore do that
[47:51] brought us these statues and the
[47:53] judgments and stuff that we need to know
[47:59] that God spoke through him
[48:03] and it says keep them and do them he
[48:06] said
[48:09] for this is your wisdom and your
[48:12] understanding in the sight of the
[48:14] Nations
[48:20] which which shall hear all these statues
[48:24] and say surely this is a great nation in
[48:27] a wise and understanding people
[48:36] so hear the scriptures say these other
[48:38] nations these other people
[48:42] are going to hear what a peculiar people
[48:45] you are interested
[48:48] that they have the word
[48:51] and the the people are going to say
[48:56] surely
[48:58] this is a great nation
[49:00] and wise why because we have received
[49:05] God's word
[49:08] for what nation
[49:18] it says for what nation is there so
[49:20] great who have God so nigh unto them as
[49:23] the Lord our God is in all things that
[49:26] we call upon him for they said
[49:35] if you notice what the scripture says
[49:38] it says what other nations what other
[49:40] people is
[49:44] has God so close
[49:49] as our Lord Our God
[49:52] and all of our things
[49:56] when we call him
[49:59] we are so blessed
[50:02] that we have God so close
[50:06] that when we call him
[50:40] then we go we approach him by his blood
[50:43] that was set on coverage
[50:49] siento
[51:15] why don't you feel him
[51:19] you got to stay in his presence
[51:23] not just when you're in church
[51:26] once we leave church
[51:29] we get into bad conversations
[51:39] apart from the presence of God
[51:43] and we don't feel him anymore
[51:46] it's not that God left us
[51:50] we left him
[51:53] but if you stay in his presence
[51:57] you can feel them everywhere you go man
[52:05] verse 8.
[52:07] and what nation as they're so great and
[52:10] hath statues and judgments so righteous
[52:13] as the law which I set before you this
[52:17] day is
[52:25] notice verse 9.
[52:27] in the first verse it says the first
[52:30] phrase it says it different in Spanish
[52:35] verse 9 it says only take heed to
[52:38] thyself
[52:42] care of yourself
[52:45] take care of yourself
[52:49] m e keep thy Soul diligently is

[53:05] diligently carefully this is
[53:11] less thou forget the things which thine
[53:15] eyes have seen

[53:47] you don't forget
[53:50] the things that you have seen God do
[53:52] before you
[53:55] will notice sometimes
[53:59] we stay away from God's presence
[54:03] and that atmosphere of the world
[54:08] that we were so quick to forget how God
[54:11] how God is
[54:14] we forget about his grace
[54:17] we forget about his mercies
[54:20] if we forget about all the things we
[54:23] have seen all the Miracles we have seen
[54:27] because that is what that atmosphere
[54:30] does
[54:32] it grabs you completely
[54:36] it's emergency submerges you in that
[54:39] presence of the world
[54:42] the world or that or that that adversary
[54:45] makes you forget
[54:49] makes you forget how God provided you or
[54:52] God has given you so many gifts

[55:00] it is foreign
[55:38] foreign
[55:43] wow
[55:46] so what do we want the holy ghosts
[55:56] amen amen we gotta take care of it
[56:01] that's what that's what the Apostle Paul
[56:03] is telling Timothy
[56:05] that's what Moses is telling to the
[56:07] people of Israel
[56:10] take care of yourself
[56:13] because you have seen the Red Sea open
[56:17] you've seen the plagues
[56:21] and they're so quick to forget about
[56:24] what God has done for them in the desert
[56:25] yeah

[56:33] and it says but teach them to thy Sons

[57:35] I never thought in a million years that
[57:37] I would have a son
[57:40] I thought the Rapture would have
[57:42] happened a long time ago
[57:47] now I have a little hijo and that the
[57:51] Lord tarries
[57:52] I gotta teach that little boy
[57:55] so he can be the next one man
[58:00] amen you might say Nah The Rapture is
[58:03] going to happen by the time but you know

[58:24] daughter whatever
[58:32] amen how many you love how many you love
[58:34] God's word
[58:37] now let's go to Proverbs the fourth
[58:39] chapter
[58:42] the 23rd verse
[58:45] know that our pastor was preaching us a
[58:48] message on the Proverbs
[58:51] now it says keep thy heart with all
[58:55] diligence
[58:58] for out of it are the issues of life
[59:03] now in in a different version of the
[59:06] Scripture
[59:10] it says above L Above All Else guard
[59:13] your heart
[59:16] oh God what does it mean
[59:20] you protect it you put a fence
[59:24] put some cameras all around make sure no
[59:26] one comes in and steals something
[59:30] is
[59:35] amen now forever everything you do this
[59:39] is
[59:40] flow from there
[59:43] from everything in there comes out
[59:48] oh I wish we had a lot of time from
[59:51] there in the heart
[59:55] Todo Sally
[59:57] where does it come out is it here it's
[1:00:01] okay
[1:00:02] where's the outlet Salida
[1:00:07] right here okay
[1:00:09] you want to know what's in the mentor
[1:00:17] that's why it says take care of your
[1:00:20] heart foreign
[1:00:25] let's go to Matthew
[1:00:27] Matthew the 15th chapter
[1:00:31] 18th verse
[1:00:33] amen are you awake tonight
[1:00:36] amen not a lot of amens but as long as
[1:00:39] you don't snore it's okay
[1:00:44] man if this is the only place you can
[1:00:46] rest is
[1:00:55] but those things which proceed out of
[1:00:58] the mouth
[1:00:59] come from the heart
[1:01:03] and defile the man
[1:01:07] is
[1:01:09] for out of the heart proceed evil
[1:01:12] thoughts
[1:01:19] adulteries fornications thefts false
[1:01:22] Witnesses blasphemies
[1:01:31] now you can study those little items
[1:01:33] that I just said
[1:01:37] verse 20. these are the things which
[1:01:41] defile a man
[1:01:45] it says on 18 verse
[1:01:48] those things was proceed out of the
[1:01:51] mouth come from the heart this is
[1:01:57] man let's go to Genesis
[1:01:59] Genesis 5 genesis Excuse Me Genesis 6. 6
[1:02:05] must be in six five
[1:02:09] and God saw the wickedness of man was
[1:02:12] great on the Earth
[1:02:13] and that every imagination of the
[1:02:16] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:02:18] continually
[1:02:21] much
[1:02:28] now this is this isn't a time of Noah
[1:02:32] when God looked down upon the Earth
[1:02:36] he says and he saw the wickedness of man
[1:02:39] was great in the earth
[1:02:44] and that every imagination
[1:02:48] of the
[1:02:50] thoughtsamientos of what the mind or the
[1:02:53] heart
[1:02:58] I didn't say the mind no this is
[1:03:03] right here
[1:03:04] so he saw that in the heart it is
[1:03:08] there was this wicked and evil things in
[1:03:12] the human heart is
[1:03:17] Jeremiah
[1:03:26] Jeremiah 7.
[1:03:28] excuse me
[1:03:30] seventeen
[1:03:33] seven
[1:03:35] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:03:38] Lord and whose hope the Lord is
[1:03:44] you're a blessed people
[1:03:48] if you trust in the Lord
[1:03:50] and if your hope is in the Lord
[1:03:55] do we trust in the Lord
[1:03:58] do we trust in the Lord
[1:04:00] oh brother I I trust in the government
[1:04:05] I trust in Joe Biden and Joe Biden I
[1:04:10] don't trust them no other man
[1:04:13] no Nation
[1:04:15] only in God's word
[1:04:18] amen amen
[1:04:20] so you're a blessed people if you trust
[1:04:23] the Lord
[1:04:26] notice how he types you if you trust in
[1:04:29] him
[1:04:33] for he shall be as a tree planted By the
[1:04:37] Waters and that spreadeth out her Roots
[1:04:40] by the river and shall not see when he
[1:04:43] cometh but her Leaf shall be green and
[1:04:46] shall not be careful in the year of the
[1:04:48] drought neither shall cease from
[1:04:49] yielding fruit this is
[1:05:07] just by trusting in the Lord
[1:05:11] that's what you got to do is
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:30] if you trust in the Lord
[1:05:33] you're going to be like a tree
[1:05:36] not like these little trees from Arizona
[1:05:43] trees in Arizona rains a little bit and
[1:05:46] they tip over
[1:05:50] but you're going to be like a sequoia
[1:05:54] big old tree planted right there by the
[1:05:56] water
[1:06:00] it doesn't care if it's hot
[1:06:05] your leaves are still going to be green
[1:06:09] there's a food shortage
[1:06:13] no matter the banks are closing down
[1:06:17] your leaves are going to be greens
[1:06:26] grocery stores
[1:06:28] you trust them a lot
[1:07:14] it's hard to trust when things are going
[1:07:17] wrong
[1:07:20] because people tend to panic is
[1:07:30] foreign foreign
[1:08:12] but if God is not in your heart
[1:08:19] but if God if God is Not There is
[1:08:23] a deceitful thing is
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:32] amen and it says desperately wicked if
[1:08:34] you say in English
[1:08:41] that's why young men and young ladies
[1:08:45] when that young lady should be so hid
[1:08:49] away in God's heart
[1:08:55] away in God's heart
[1:09:02] has to enter God's heart
[1:09:05] to find that young lady
[1:09:09] she has to be so hid away in God's heart
[1:09:14] that young man has to get in God's heart
[1:09:25] now I hope that God can give us a
[1:09:27] revelation of these scriptures
[1:09:41] in Spanish it says a little bit
[1:09:43] different in Spanish
[1:09:45] I the Lord search the heart in English
[1:09:51] now those who are bilingual watch this
[1:09:55] I searched the heart
[1:09:58] and I try the range
[1:10:04] it's the Lord trying the rain
[1:10:08] the Lord searches the heart is
[1:10:15] what the horse has a rain that's this
[1:10:17] little rope that has it
[1:10:22] the writers on top
[1:10:25] and the writer holds the rain
[1:10:29] so stop it slow it down foreign
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:11:00] even to every man according to his ways
[1:11:03] and according to the fruit of its doings
[1:11:08] now let's go real quickly we're running
[1:11:11] out of time I hope I get right time to
[1:11:13] read the quotes in x acts 7
[1:11:17] representative
[1:11:21] acts 7 51.
[1:11:24] now this is a nice little scripture if
[1:11:27] you go home and you can read this
[1:11:31] you can read the whole chapter 7 foreign
[1:12:17] memorizing his message
[1:12:19] he says use stiff-neck and uncircumcised
[1:12:23] in the heart and ears the service
[1:12:30] he do always resist the Holy Ghost as
[1:12:34] your fathers did so deep so do he
[1:12:38] Siempre a spirit
[1:12:42] which of the prophets have not which of
[1:12:45] the prophets have you not your fathers
[1:12:47] persecuted and they have slain them
[1:12:49] which they sowed before the coming of
[1:12:51] the just one of whom ye have seen now
[1:12:53] and betrayed betrayers and murderers
[1:13:07] who have received the law by the
[1:13:09] dispensation of angels and have not kept
[1:13:12] it is
[1:13:16] so he's speaking a little bit harsh
[1:13:20] now notice on the 51st 54th verse what
[1:13:24] the people are doing what the audience
[1:13:26] is doing okay
[1:13:30] he says when they heard these things
[1:13:34] they were cut at the heart in in English
[1:13:40] and in Spanish
[1:13:42] they were angry they were Furious in
[1:13:45] their hearts
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:16] so they're not just angry at their heart
[1:14:18] because
[1:14:20] what's in their heart is being produced
[1:14:23] on the outside
[1:14:27] when Stephen is preaching
[1:14:30] and they're just doing this to their
[1:14:32] teeth
[1:14:34] just gnashing their teeth
[1:14:38] just rubbing their teeth together
[1:14:41] that's kind of tough this is but what's
[1:14:45] in the heart
[1:14:47] comes out Sally now let's go back to
[1:14:51] Proverbs
[1:14:53] how many of you love God's word
[1:14:57] man
[1:14:58] good to hear that
[1:15:02] Proverbs the 22nd chapter is
[1:15:06] the third verse
[1:15:17] Proverbs 22 3.
[1:15:19] a prudent man forsieth the evil and
[1:15:23] hideth himself
[1:15:29] but the simple pass on and are punished
[1:15:32] Maslow simplest
[1:15:34] there was a scripture that I wanted to
[1:15:36] read before
[1:15:38] the scripture says clean my heart
[1:15:43] give me a new heart
[1:15:47] because we started to notice what's
[1:15:50] inside the heart
[1:15:54] nothing but wrong doings in there
[1:15:59] and it says
[1:16:12] I'll give you my spirit
[1:16:15] so we have to come to God to get a new
[1:16:19] heart and
[1:16:23] now here on the 22nd uh 22nd chapter
[1:16:27] verse three again
[1:16:30] this is a plural man for sea of evil we
[1:16:33] say in English
[1:16:37] what is a prudent man
[1:16:42] someone who's wise who knows how to
[1:16:44] think
[1:16:46] when they see evil
[1:16:49] when they see Temptation
[1:16:52] they get away from Temptations
[1:16:54] that's why it says a prudent person this
[1:16:58] is
[1:16:59] when they see Temptation
[1:17:02] they run away from temptation
[1:17:05] but a simple pass on this is foreign
[1:17:40] that's why in Proverbs says a wise
[1:17:43] person foreign
[1:18:19] well Pastor I got so close to it I
[1:18:22] didn't even get bit Hallelujah
[1:18:25] you know you know what it says well how
[1:18:28] far can you get away from it then
[1:18:32] you got close to it how far can you get
[1:18:35] away
[1:19:12] I believe that every fiber of a
[1:19:15] Christian body is controlled by the holy
[1:19:17] spirit this is
[1:19:23] I believe that your your eyes are
[1:19:26] controlled by the Holy Spirit
[1:19:31] you can't help when you look to see an
[1:19:34] evil
[1:19:37] but if you lust after it
[1:19:42] you already committed adultery
[1:19:47] that's what the prophet says
[1:19:49] you turn your head
[1:19:52] hurts I always had a cross in my car
[1:19:56] foreign
[1:20:35] pecado
[1:20:51] that's where I sometimes before I'm
[1:20:53] being tempted Lord forgive me Lord
[1:20:55] forgive me foreign
[1:21:49] Ramen
[1:21:53] you can't be tempted
[1:21:55] Christ was tempted like we are
[1:21:58] Christopher
[1:22:00] never sinned
[1:22:02] he was tempted but he never fell to that
[1:22:05] Temptation
[1:22:08] what was Jesus response
[1:22:12] Jesus depart from me
[1:22:15] satanas that's what we have to do is
[1:22:23] Temptation is not sin
[1:22:27] but hearing to your temptation is
[1:22:39] sometimes we think that we're sinning
[1:22:41] because we're being tempted
[1:22:45] we say God forgive me for them tempting
[1:22:51] no what we should
[1:23:02] so the holy spirit is God that helps us
[1:23:05] bear out the truth of God and we are
[1:23:08] written pictures
[1:23:15] notice
[1:23:20] a question
[1:23:22] how many in here are born again
[1:23:29] how many are born again raise your hand
[1:23:33] it's good that's a real good number
[1:23:37] says praise the Lord for that is
[1:23:41] how many was tempted cuantos and went
[1:23:45] through Temptation immediately after you
[1:23:47] were born again
[1:23:55] every one of you
[1:23:57] those who Rose their hands and those who
[1:24:00] did it
[1:24:03] every single one of us
[1:24:06] are tempted
[1:24:09] even after you're immediately being born
[1:24:12] again
[1:24:19] oh
[1:24:24] so all right may God help us
[1:24:28] now see if you've got every son that
[1:24:31] cometh to God first got to be chastile
[1:24:33] chastise child trained no exception to
[1:24:38] every son
[1:24:45] every single one of us
[1:24:51] through his word through or through our
[1:24:55] pastors condescending
[1:25:00] amen amen
[1:25:02] God can send an angel
[1:25:04] but it has to be through a man
[1:25:09] when like brother Marcos read that
[1:25:11] scriptures
[1:25:19] but the angel didn't have the germs
[1:25:26] that's why the angel commissioned Philip
[1:25:29] to go to the unit
[1:25:33] that's what we have
[1:25:38] now I hope God can help us I really hope
[1:25:40] I really believe God I hope God can help
[1:25:42] us
[1:25:44] it says what do you believe old he says
[1:25:47] do you believe old men then when we were
[1:25:49] boys our boys have gotten 10 times the
[1:25:52] Temptation that we had they said
[1:26:01] that again
[1:26:03] there was Temptation when when our
[1:26:06] fathers had
[1:26:09] but now it's ten times more worse all
[1:26:13] right
[1:26:13] and it gets worse and it gets worse
[1:26:18] every single generation it gets worse
[1:26:23] if they struggled if you struggle what
[1:26:28] do you think about your boy and your
[1:26:30] daughter
[1:26:33] is peor
[1:26:35] sister do you realize that your daughter
[1:26:38] has the 10 times the Temptation you had
[1:26:39] when you were a girl
[1:26:42] this is
[1:26:45] what will your daughter have
[1:26:48] look at the things
[1:26:51] the pictures the devil is painting
[1:26:56] so is there a solution brother Louise
[1:27:00] Your solution to this temptation is
[1:27:04] getting worse and it's getting worse oh
[1:27:12] they say we need to pray this is
[1:27:18] we need to pray
[1:27:21] now we'll go back to you again
[1:27:25] brother do you realize we don't pray as
[1:27:29] half as much as our fathers did this
[1:27:37] if they didn't pray as much of the time
[1:27:39] as brother Branham which was a moral
[1:27:42] decent time
[1:27:50] do we still pray
[1:27:53] take care of yourself
[1:27:57] take heal of yourself
[1:27:59] there's Temptation
[1:28:02] take care of your heart
[1:28:07] you got to keep God's word
[1:28:10] you need to pray
[1:28:39] that's why we feel weak at times foreign
[1:29:11] how's your prayer life
[1:29:21] and many of you young people have
[1:29:23] already gotten to that point
[1:29:26] I already reached my limit my time
[1:29:28] limited I'm conscious of it let's come
[1:29:32] to a time where now your mom and dad
[1:29:34] can't watch you every day and every hour
[1:29:41] now it falls in your hands
[1:29:44] what are you going to do
[1:29:48] take care of your heart
[1:29:51] take care of your soul take care of your
[1:29:55] testimony
[1:29:56] take care of yourself
[1:29:59] because you are gonna have to teach your
[1:30:02] son
[1:30:03] and they're going to teach their sons
[1:30:12] oh what prayer life do we have okay
[1:30:16] classes
[1:30:17] I'm almost done
[1:30:20] sometimes we golf on a tantrum somewhere
[1:30:23] and not think about God this is
[1:30:28] sometimes we get mad and we don't even
[1:30:30] think about God that's the last person
[1:30:32] or last thing we think about foreign
[1:31:33] well that's well that's the more excuse
[1:31:37] me that's that more that's the more of a
[1:31:39] sign that you should pray this is
[1:31:43] more than ever read the Bible every day
[1:31:48] every day don't make any decisions too
[1:31:52] harshly or too quickly
[1:31:55] decision
[1:31:58] I'm going to say that again don't make
[1:32:02] any decisions
[1:32:26] is it your will for me to do this is
[1:32:31] it your will to do this is
[1:32:35] foreign
[1:33:35] if see if you're sincere
[1:33:39] sincero ask him
[1:33:42] oh God I love that quote
[1:33:45] when the inspector goes through
[1:33:49] respect your life
[1:33:52] to see if you're not just a little loose
