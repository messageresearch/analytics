give us a revelation of your word to be more wise and to know what to do in our lives I ask personally of your help and for my interpreter help us Speak Lord for what you want your people to hear we place this service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen and just as you are let's go to the Book of Daniel the fifth chapter and verse [Music] 24 you can say Amen once you have [Music] it then was a part of the hand sent from him and this writing was [Music] written and this and this is the writing that was written [Music] menen this is the interpretation of the thing men God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it Thou Art weighed in the balances and and are found wanting perz thy kingdom is divided and given unto the mees and Persians then commanded basar and they clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the Kingdom and that night was basar the king of the Chan slain median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old God bless the reading of his word if you may you could take your seats like to thank the [Music] musicians now the scripture that we just finished reading it was in that period of time in that uh Babylonian Empire and knew this prophecy came against that uh Babylonian Empire and it says that Kingdom has gone has come to an end and a new kingdom was the Usher in and which was the med Persians we know that if something is written in the Bible and it's for a reason it's not just the history book it's a a book of Prophecy now brother Bram says in the the message the handwriting on the wall it says now and any Bible reader here knows that all scripture has a com compound meaning every prophecy some most all of it has a dual a dual time there or two times or more that it will be answered as a revolving of History so we know if it's in the Bible and US reading the Bible it seems like if it happened in the past and it will no longer happen again but God's word is eternal so as time continues like if like just as Spirits don't die and the time continues the same spirits of the past are working in today but with a new name the the the men of the Bible they saw things ahead or in the future they had visions of the future and the past but when he speaks about these kingdoms of the future they have to use names that they know in their time to describe the kingdoms of the future when he speaks about Babylon and the medal Persians it can be talking about what happened in the past but also speak of what's going to happen in the future so brother Bram and another message the handwriting of the wall paragraph 50 and they sent and got Daniel the Prophet and he came in and he said he would read it for he had the gift of interpretation so he began to interpret the unknown tongue and told the king what was going to happen the king thought he was safely secured but he didn't know all that all the time he says a Godless Nation like Russia now remember the prophet was not in the med of Persia he was in Babylon the big rock and roll was going on in Babylon where the Revival was going on too where the Prophet was and the message was but all the time now notice the comparison that brother random makes says the mes and Persians are just as Godless and heartless as Russia is had found a way because Spirits don't die and story and the history repeats itself in the message the serpent seed that's the reason God has raised up Russia Yonder with an atomic bomb to wipe her off like the anti luian flood was when he raised the clouds sure he has and the Bible says so says Russia the athetic country as they are atheist has absolutely playing just exactly in the hands of of almighty God just as King Nebuchadnezzar was to destroy Israel because they have failed to walk with God say Russia is rising right up to avenge the Saints of the Catholic Church of the blood that she sh shed of the Saints the Bible said so it's going to take the whole thing just like Spirits don't die those same spirits that was used in the past in the kingdoms of old are being used in this time but now they have a new name but when the Bible speaks of it but those new names didn't exist in that time they have to know the names of their present time so Russia are the M of Persia it's the same Spirit but with a new name now the Roman Catholic Church is it's Babylon but now with a new name but with the same Spirit the spirits don't die and prophecy is being fulfilled multiple times now in Jeremiah 51:11 make bright the arrows GA gather the shields the Lord hath raised up thy Spirit of the kings of the mes for his device is against Babylon to destroy because it is Vengeance of the Lord the Vengeance of his temple one would think that that Jeremiah speak about the literal Babylon what they did against Israel God is he will raise up the spirits of the of the mids of Persia to destroy Babylon when Babylon literally went to Israel they destroyed the temple he said he will get his Vengeance for what they did to his Temple but the scripture gets fulfilled multiple times now we all know we can see throughout the Bible where God is the devil wants to get in where God blesses a person or a people or a nation the devil wants to get in and he establish his own kingdom and something that did before the foundation of the world in Isaiah 14:12 how art thou falling from Heaven Lu first son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did is weaken the Nations you see how he weakens the Nations now verse 13 for for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will I will sit also upon the mountain of the congregation in the sides of the north where God is the devil wants to get in so the devil in that time he caused a revolution in the Kingdom that was found in the north because brother says the message the faith of Abraham so all this here pretty and beauty stuff that comes from the devil that's exactly right Satan won a more glamorous Kingdom than Michael and that's the reason he set up his kingdom in the north so the kingdom that was in the north it was about it was Michaels one would think why Michael now look Michael in the book of Jude he speaks that he's an archangel but in the Book of Daniel it speaks about Michael as a prince now we know that Michael is an angel just like the devil and all the rest of these spirits that control the Nations but there's different ranks in the spirits one of them is of a prince and a prince has a certain Kingdom assigned to him and should control that Kingdom if you go to the Book of Daniel where where brother Daniel was once praying and he had to pray for 21 days and he want to know things that were going to happen in the future and things that were going to happen to his own people after the 21 days gabri the Gabriel the angel Gabriel he appears him he said look I have rested for 21 days or I waited 21 days because I was fighting the Prince of Persia and one of those main uh uhp uh Kings orp prince prince Miguel he says Michael he came to help me and after I fought the king of the the Prince of Persia I have to fight against the prince of Greece now these are spirits now Michael is a prince that's why he has a Terrain he has a kingdom that was assigned appointed to him and God gave him that Kingdom Satan wants to get in where God people is at where God blesses something Satan went to the the kings of of the north and brother Braham says he established his kingdom there in the north also he brought forth a revolution a rebellion against the kingdom of Michael and infiltrating himself and preaching to the Stars that represents the Seed of Abraham and it caused one of those stars or some of those stars to come with him now that's what the devil did he got into the kingdom he began to speak a contrary message and he took some of them he caused he caused a Civil War in heaven now in Revelations 12 1-5 and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars and she being with child cry travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born remember his story history repeats itself that the Bible is not a book of History it's a book of Prophecy what happened in the past and it continues again it happens again so what the devil did in heaven here is talking about what he did in heaven but it also speaks what he's doing here on Earth verse five and she brought forth a Manchild who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up onto God and to his throne what would think since it speaks about the dragon and the stars of Heaven it speaks about what he did there in heaven but it also speaks what he did here on Earth notice what brother Ram says here questions and answers law having a shadow now you say the dragon had has something to do with the Jews certainly they said this Jesus says he's the king we have no King but Caesar so when the devil went to heaven to the sides of the north he caused a rebellion leader against their leader in in Earth in is there in Israel Satan got there among some of the Jews so they can stir up a rebellion against their Messiah what he did up there he does it again here on Earth he says can you see the devil denying Hearts today excuse me that's right you see the devil preparing them Jewish Hearts back there to deny Jesus Christ when he come can you see the devil denying the hearts today to deny the power of the Holy Ghost when he comes just exactly the same yet honest and sincere but if you're deeply and seek after God like some of them Jews did they walked right out and received him anyhow that's right they didn't care what the church said but it cast twoth thirds of them on onto the ground and the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born he says now he said what government what power stood before the woman the Jewish Orthodox Church to devour Jesus Christ when he was born Rome so the red dragon was Rome the devil he caused a revolution in the system of the the government system to go against their leader the history repeats itself lucif Lucifer went to heaven and caused a revolution amongst the angels to stand against Michael their leader and did the same thing here on Earth when Jesus Christ came now remember what we read on Jeremiah 511 he was going to rise up the spirit of the medal Persians against Babylon and get Vengeance of his temple one would think it would be the literal Temple but John in 2:19 Jesus answered said unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up then said the Jews 40 in six years was a temple in the building and will thou read it up in the three days but he spake of the Temple of his body now it's the spirit of the medal Persians that will get back the Vengeance that God will use to get this Vengeance against Babylon now Babylon today has a new name now that is a Roman Catholic church so the med Persians today they also have a new name that is Russia but it's the same Spirit let's see what brother Ram says about Ria we have seen his star in the message we have seen his star and we have come to worship him why is why is communism coming why is the world being swallowed up why could 1% of Russia that all is communism 99% is still Christian 1% of Russia controlling the rest of the world almost the Eastern world so Russia has two parts it has 1% that is communist and another part another person of the mess says they're atheists they have no God remember the medal Persians they they are that bear a bear it's a it's a it's a anim beast but the bear it's that 1% it's communist it's atheist what animal represents the 99% that is Christian brother Bram said in the message go awake Jesus that's what caused communism to raise up in Russia well the Communist is not a great party there's only 1% of Russia is communism now 1% 99% is still free but they're they're ruling they're the ones ruling why did raised up in the first place because the corruption of the church that's what done it it's talking about the Catholic Church they took all the money from the people to the church and they live the same kinds of lives they they wasn't no more but just like any other Lodge and the people got sick and tired of it and that's how communism was born we see that the prophet tells us that 1% is communist and the rest of the 99 is is uh Christian how is it that 1% can rule or govern the 99 because it's communist in other words it's a dictatorship that's what's in the government controlling the citizens that's why that 1% can control that 99 that's that uh SP Spirit of communist but the Christian Spirit the spirit of Christ he leaves the 99 sheep and he goes for that one sheep that got lost so that 1% it's that bear that's that that Beast that atheist has wants nothing to do with religion but the 99 it's Christian so what animal represents the Christian side of the medal Persians the Bible tells us in Daniel 8 verse one in the third year the region of the king belar a vision appeared onto me even unto me Daniel after that which appeared unto me at first now remember this is under the reign of king belthasar a king of Babylon so this was before the medial Persians verse two and I saw in a vision and it came to pass when I saw that I was in shushan in the palace which in the province of Elam and I saw in a vision and I was by the river of uali then I lifted up my eyes and I saw behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns now brother say there's two parts in Russia it say 1% and there's the 99% the bear we we just finished reading that there is a ram that has two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last so it has two horns but one is higher than the other there's two parts in the metop Persians but One controls the other can you see that verse four and I saw the ram pushing Westward and northward and Southward so that no Beast might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he hid he he did according to his will and became great so he's expanding his kingdom here verse 20 the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of media and Persia so we can see what brother Bram tells us that the country of today that is called Russia that has two parts that is founded in the Bible because Russia has a spirit of the medal Persians and the medal Persian has two portions that one part is higher than the other in the message I restore sayith the Lord and then he said put me seven rounds on here what do the ram speak of any religious teacher know that the ram spoke of the coming of the Lord Jesus we can see that the bear it's the atheist the Communist and the ram is the Christian there's two parts and he says that he will get the Vengeance of his Temple we saw that the Vengeance of the temple the temple it was his body now brother Ram was to say that the med Persians or Russia is divided in two parts one is communist the other is is Beast is other one is Christian we have to see that in the Bible and the Bible does show us in Daniel 6 how many remember when Daniel was cost was cast to the lines Den What Spirit What Spirit was it used to cast Daniel to the Lion's Den was it the bear or was it the ram the Christian side or the atheist side the Communist that abuses the power of the government let's go to Daniel 61 it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom and 120 princes which should be over the whole Kingdom and over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first that the princes might give account count onto them and the King should have no damage now Daniel besides being Christian he was in the government he was a man of government verse then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm now what Spirit was in this King the bear the atheist communist or the ram the Christian but in verse four we can see the other side of that Kingdom then the president and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could not they could find none occas nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said unto unto him King Darius live forever all the president of the Kingdom the governors and the princes the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish Royal statue and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for 30 days save of thee O King he shall be cast into the den of the Lions so what Spirit was in the king the bear or the RAM and what Spirit control these other men they wanted to accuse Daniel because that medal Persians is divided in two portions that's the bear and the ram the Communist The Atheist and the Christian amen so it was a communist spirit that entered in these men to use and abuse the power of the government to go against Daniel to kill him but the Christian spirit and this King he loved Daniel in Daniel 6:16 then the king commanded and they brought down Daniel and cast him into the into the den of the Lions now the king spake and said unto Daniel Thy Thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee so these men spoke so good that the king legally could do nothing for Daniel and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signate and with the sign of the Lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel so these were men of the government communist that spoke against Daniel and they abused their government power to deceive the king So Daniel can be killed and be cast into the line den and the Bible says when he was cast there and there was a stone there on top of the den to seal it same thing with Jesus when they spoke against him and they took him to the tomb and they sealed that tomb with a stone and in fact I have a testimony about this me and this message I preached it months ago where brother Jesus Garcia magdala they in in Magdalena in Mex in Mexico in that occasion brother Jesse Alan went with me and brother Jesus asked for me to speak and I had this topic in my heart but I wasn't so sure if I was to speak it or not I was doubting itess and I I I shared it with Jesse and Jesse said well yeah you should you should speak it I said okay that's good but I wasn't completely convinced that that should be the the the topic but I decided to do so when I got there to Magdalena brother Jes he took me and Jesse to a cemetery when he took us there to that Cemetery he took us to this place called like a mum how many know what a mum is it's it's a a grave side where they bury the rich people and what got my attention of this mum this this this man was a a politician in fact he was elected to be president and he was waiting for that president in that current time for his his his uh uh time to his term to end and he was going to be the next president for all I know he was elected to be president and this man was a lot like Daniel in the Bible what I searched and what brother Jesus told me is that this man was a clean man he wanted to clean the government but but the one who was president at that time went against this man and they achieved to kill him and the name of this man that died Dono is Luis Donaldo colosio and what what surprised me when we got to the mum that he was it was a form of a pyramid we entered and we saw they had his his famous sayings that he said and even brother Jesus told me and some thought that he was Christian and because the way he spoke when he gave his speeches very similar to Daniel when we enter and we see there's there was a sayings there and there's coats there on the wall and brother Jus takes me there to the beneath what's under there there's more things about him and I enter to the bottom side and I'm looking at the wall and there's a there's a a picture that I see in that picture there's three menio in the middle is Luis Donaldo colossio and on the other side on both sides these were the these men lived during the time of Brother brandham John F Kennedy the first one was John F Kennedy a Catholic President and then the other side Martin Luther King Jr was Martha Luther King Jr two men that they say that they went against them to kill them and we're speaking about this topic of Russia communist Catholicism Babylon and then the Christian side died John F Kennedy and John F Kennedy he was a Catholic President he was elected as a president here in the United States and during that time when he was elected his opponent Richard Richard Nixon I believe it was Richard Nixon Richard Nixon and Richard Nixon brother Bram says he said there was fraud committed in the voting for The President Martin Luther King Jr now Martin Luther King Jr and he was defending the civil rights of the African-American people brother Ram says this and this impacted me a lot what he did that he was guiding his people to a killing and he says what he did was inspired by communist and that impacted me a lot I would say why would brother Bram say this now I believe brother brand but I couldn't understand how he was inspired by Communists when somebody is under a communist government system or a dictatorship one of the things that it produces re it's revolutions Civil Wars rebellion in that time the African-Americans arising against the government and against the polies that's why he said he was inspired by Communists but history repeats itself what happened during a time of brother brandham it happens again Biden a couple years ago when Joe Biden a Catholic President was elected Donal and his opponent Donald Trump he says fraud was uh being caused in the voting but in that time there was another movement for the African-Americans black lives matter which is black lives matter now we all know this now we see it when a a police a white man policeman when he shoots at a young boy that's African-American the whole country explodes where that Spirit comes from from back then Spirits don't die and history repeats itself so what happened in the past it happens again today it's it's not nothing new there's new names but same Spirits amen to what happened with Daniel it happened with Jesus men of the government abusing their government power to kill a just man in this case a Christian man so then Daniel was cast to the Lions then his only hope was God yes amen if the this the Communist system fails you and if this government fails you if this religion fails you your only hope is [Music] Christ Christ comes he will come in Armageddon to bring forth a rebellion against Babylon Med Persians and none of us shall die in that battle there's no way that you can kill an eternal body the Vengeance of his Temple and in the Millennium he will establish his own kingdom there will be Pagan Nations there there in the Millennium brother BR says it and the Bible also says it and the devil can do nothing in that Millennium the Bible said he will be tied down for thousands of years the only one can bring a successful Kingdom to Pagan Nations is Christ amen now Daniel being cast to The Lions Den it's a type of the death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ because Christ when he died he was cast into a tomb and he was there in the Lion's Den he went to hell and he got his Vengeance with the Devil remember the devil went to the side of the north he preached to the Stars to the Seed of Abraham and some of those angels went with him now Christ goes to hell he preaches to the souls in prison and he takes the Saints of the Old Testament that were they found in Paradise there were two lions confronting them because the Bible says that Bible says the devil is like a roaring lion sinking who he may devour but the Bible also says that Christ is the lion of the tribe of Judah there were two lions they were fighting one will conquer the other and take the the other's Mana The Pride that the pride so what happened with Daniel it was a communist spirit that was used to kill him and the same happen with Jesus and the same is happening today let's go to Daniel let's see what side this king is on uh Daniel 6:17 and the stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signate and with the signate of his Lord that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel now on the next day that followed the day of preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together I'm sorry he said he laid down and he fasted What Spirit does the King show here the bear the atheist or the ram the Christian instruments of Music brought before him and his sleep went from him you can see how worried this king is for Daniel then the king arose very early in the morning and went into haste onto the den of the Lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King spake and said unto Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions then said Daniel unto the king oh King live forever my God has sent his Angel and has shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocent instancy was found in me and also before the king oh King have I done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up of a den and no man of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his God and the King commanded and they brought those men which accused Daniel and they cast him into the dens of lions them their children their wives and the Lions had their master of them and they break all their bones in pieces orever they came at the bottom of the den then then King darus wrote on to all the people and Nations and languages that dwell on all the Earth peace be multiplied onto you so we're going to show what kind of spirit this King has verse 26 I make a decree that every Dominion of my kingdom men Trouble In Fear before the god of Daniel for he is a living God and steadfast [Music] forever and his kingdom sh that which shall not be destroyed and his Dominion shall be even unto the end he deliver and rescue and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and the Earth who has delivered Daniel from the power of the Lions now showing the power of the Resurrection Daniel being tip being killed buried resurrected it caused that this King to that pertains to this Pagan Kingdom to become a Christian to show that resurrection power to one who is Pagan will cause that person that wants to be Christian you don't want to be a sinner but there's a percentage in you that's atheist that's unbelief that wants to rebel against Christ wants to go to the world but you inside of you there's a desire to be a Christian if God God if God to you shows you that resurrection power you accept that God so it's not just for the government but it's for the individual that wants to be atheist wants to be communist wants to rebel against their leader against God but there's another portion of you if you see that resurrection power in your life you accept that God Paul says in Philippians 3:10 that I may know him and the power of resur Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferings being made comfortable onto his death so the the the key of this Kingdom which is Pagan which is atheist and Christian and if you give it the opportunity to be a Christian to show that Resurrection power they will accept it what happened with Daniel in the Kingdom of of the reign of the medal Persians it's not just a story or history history repeats itself with the medal Persians of today Russia what happened with Daniel it happened again how many you remember when brother Ram had a vision when there was a little boy that was killed in the street he was ran over by a Russian it was obviously an accident but someone in the government killed someone so then so if you show that resurrection power to that Nation what will be their reaction brother message the voice of God in the last days and in Russia the birthplace of Communism which many years ago when I was just a boy preacher I say 33 years ago when na Nazism fascism and communism was Rising I said I speak in the name of the Lord they all wind up in communism but did you ever think God has left God has left us an Avenue out if we just take it there's only 1% of Russia that's communism 1% but but they're the the the percent that's controlling 1% of Communism 1% of Russia is communism rather but they control hwood but the same thing with Hollywood Holly ones one place but they're in control about onethird or two-thirds of the population of the United States goes to church and his church members but they control in those denominations what what communism needs over there is a voice of God rise up amongst them and it will put him to shame in Finland when the little boy was raised from the dead that day and they was bringing me three squares away communist soldiers Russians were standing there with a Russian salute and tears running down their cheeks and they said they said we will receive a God that can raise the dead it is the negligence of the Catholic church and the Lutheran Church and all those denominations and they're taking all of the money and building organizations and giving the people nothing they live like the rest of the people notice it was God that shut the lion's mouth there with Daniel what Russia needs is a prophet to rise on the scene with the word of the Lord that can shut their mouths then that 90% will take over the sto history begins to repeat itself what happened then what happened today it's not just for Russia but it's also for you God has resurrected us that we're dead and in our sins and trespasses we're no longer pagans we're no longer atheists we're no longer Communists if we don't like what Christ has for us then we rebel against him we're no longer that part we're part of that Ram that has seven horns that represents seven Church ages and we're part of those horns what side do you want to be on uh the the Beast the side of the Beast the atheist or the ram the Christian Christ has already showed you with that little boy that was raised up but mainly in your heart and you saw a lot many testimonies how people will live in sin and God would take them out of that condition God would take them out of the lion Den amen God can do the same thing to you he can take out your sinful life it can take you out of the Lion's Den be part of that Ram let us stand let us pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks for your word Lord we can see that there's spirits that govern this world but there's only one spirit that can successfully govern all these nations and that is the holy spirit but Lord begin etern allow us not to be like that bear that rebel against Christ when we hear something we don't like when we want to be atheist help us to be like the ram which is a domestic animal a household L animal and we are from the house of God help everyone Lord to make their decision they want to be atheists or they want to be Christians they already know what's the end of The Atheist and
