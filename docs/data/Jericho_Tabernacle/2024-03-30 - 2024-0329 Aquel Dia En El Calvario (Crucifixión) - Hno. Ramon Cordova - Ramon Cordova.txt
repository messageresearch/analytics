we're going to place ourselves into the hands of the Lord and go into prayer beloved Lord Jesus Christ in this hour We're very grateful for your presence in this [Music] place being that this is such a great day for us oh in a day like this you were walking on your way to Calvary and Lord we have no way of being able to repay you but we ask in this hour that you prepare our hearts and that you help [Music] us Lord thank you for all the things that you've given and Lord on that day when you were taken up by hands of iniquity and you were cut to pieces and spat on and Lord you were hanging there on that cross bleeding and dying and it seemed like there was no hope coming from anywhere until you cried out Lord Lord why hast Thou forsaken me oh thank you for that sacrifice that you made on Calvary thank you Lord we place this into your hands in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] amen we're going to go straight into the scriptures onto Matthew [Music] 27 on verse [Music] [Music] 27 going to be reading up to verse 31 but I did comment that I was going to read up to verse 54 and perhaps maybe later on I might take a couple more scriptures and if you have the scriptures if you wouldn't mind saying amen then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the the common Hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers thear and they stripped him and put on him a Scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a and a read in his his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews and they spit upon him and took the Reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own reignment on him and led him away to crucify him amen if you wouldn't mind taking your seats my desire is that the Lord bless you and like I said it it's a great pleasure to be amongst you once again and we try to serve the Lord as best as we can I would like to talk about a little bit of what the crucifixion is and I'm going to be reading off of the message that day on Calvary and the definition of crucifixion uh put someone to death by nailing or binding them to a cross and now how is it that a crucifixion comes to happen uh crucifixion is one of the worst torments that a human mind can ever endure it was invented during in the Persian era uh back in the day uh before Christ and from there it was spread out to the medit Mediterranean area the old Greece and the Roman Empire and in reality I don't know when was the last time a crucifixion was but it was a very shameful act and it was something very shameful and and in reality and none of the other crucifixions that were ever done was it ever more shameful to the crucifixion that Jesus Christ endured and it's been known until us if we have a River to Cross uh in part from the Lord if we ever have any mountains that it seems like we can't get over we know that there's somebody who specializes in that that he was able to do it for a certain purpose that crucifixion had a certain purpose it was something very unusual because of the same God that you believe and I believe in he went searching throughout the heavens and the Earth and there was nobody found worthy of nobody in nowhere was ever worthy of it and he did it in such a way that only he could do it Hallelujah that day on Calvary our minds as a believer in this message and hearing that Praise of that day on Calvary that help helps us to be able to time trouble onto that day that happened I'm going to be reading off of uh the paragraph number 41 from this message uh brother B didn't preach this on the Good Friday it seems like it would be a little out of season this should be on a good Friday Calvary should be remembered every day just as we're Christians every single day just like the Christian brother should act like a Christian every single day when we've heard so much of that and we've heard so many preachers and the majority of the preachers that we have today their main theme should be pointing the souls onto the day on Calvary that should be the main thing not some kind of organization not some kind of denomination a group of men or a church but over there where he was crucified blessed be the name of the Lord and we've heard so much about it read so and many preachers have preached uh since the beginning of time some have written wrong but my beloved brother that person who is actually Guided by God he has to write it down just exactly as he said just exactly as what it happened that day on Calvary was such a glorious day for us a glorious thing and he already perceived them before the foundation world he came onto his own and his own received them not but there is a group of people that a group that has been called out to be called in his name blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah the singers have sung of it how many songs aren't there how much inspiration has there's a song called at the cross I'm going to try to sing it to you for a little bit at the cross at the cross I don't have a himn book here but we've sung that song for many times amen and it comes back to my memory about 20 years ago when I began working for a company they sent us to a certain place called uh and there was a certain movie play that was called the passion Christ it's been roughly about 20 years now now notice when that movie first came out and everybody see it I didn't see it right then and there but later on it was something very tremendous there were some people who died from the impression of seeing that movie but I want to tell you that it wasn't at full capacity but it was just that part of what really happened how was it then if you weren't there but beloved brother he did it for you and me what a tremendous thing now notice the singers have Su throughout the ages and the prophets prophesied it and the prophet says 4,000 years before it ever happened and the prophets of this day point back to when it did happen it's such an important day it's one of the most important days of all the days that God ever let down on Earth that day my brother the son came out the son of Justice why because there was a certain somebody there at that time that had overcome death the [Applause] burial and this day many people go out to the oceans country many people go out to vacation or they go out somewhere and we're talking about Christians and people out in the world well they think that they're doing it all right over there in that town There's a bit of Prophecy there they try to simulate the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus and then there's some people that they put him on a cross there but in reality just ignoring what really happened they will never understand the capacity or the magnitude of what really happened oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and it's such an important thing that day on Calvary for Humanity and let's see three important things that are significant to us for that day let's begin with the first one because in reality this was something that was really outstanding I'm going to be reading from paragraph 44 uh the one great important thing at that Calvary means to us on and the world is that it settled the sin question one once for all once for all see we were in sin and we were born in sin and we were already lost and the man was found guilty of sin and that was one of the reasons why he had to go to to be able to redeem a fallen uh uh Society or or human race and sin was a penalty that no man could pay the penalty was so great until there was there wasn't anyone that could pay that penalty I truly believe that God ordained it in that way that the penalty would be so great that no man could pay it so he could do it himself so that only he himself like I said previously that he couldn't find anybody worthy enough to and there was nobody worthy I couldn't die for you my father couldn't die for us and those great preachers couldn't die for us only he himself had to die for us there was only one worthy hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord now the penalty of sin was death and we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies therefore there wasn't none of us that was Worthy or they could find no one that on Earth that was worthy and we know that sin did not begin here on Earth it began in heaven and we understand that uh Satan uh deceived two-thirds of heaven and sin began in Earth blessed be the name of the Lord now notice Hallelujah and we said that there was three outstanding points that we should uh be aware of and I have it written down here give me I'm not a very good teacher and I'm aware that there are some brothers that are great teachers that don't need so much education well there was a brother over there in Mexico didn't he didn't even finish elementary school and he would quote the messages and scriptures and and you would see how he would make everything fall into place and we understand that that's a gift from God and we said that there was three things amen the first we should find the significance of that day the second point we should see what that day did for did for us what he did for us the Third now we should look at what we should do because of that what should we do because of that day now we understand that he was supposed to die for our sins and what was the reason for dying was because he had to save the race that was fallen and said his children were fallen in sin and the only way to bring us back home was to be able to die on that day on Calvary I'm going to be reading another part and I do ask that you excuse me for reading so much I'm going to be reading from paragraph 53 and paragraph 54 finally one day that's the day of Calvary there was one that came down from Glory one by the name of Jesus Christ the son of God who came from glory and Calvary was formed and that was the day that the the price was paid and the sin question was settled forever and it opened up the way unto this thing that we're hungering and thirsting for and that's the reason why the Lord put the fivefold ministry into the church and every gift that the lord gave us in the ministry we're just Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ and we shouldn't be pointing to ourselves but we should be pointing towards Calvary unto what he's already done and we have nothing else more to do but to just live what he has already given us to live it and to preach it in such a manner that he would if he was to come tomorrow or if he was to come tonight why because each and every one of us should be ready and prepared for that time oh Hallelujah why is that because we're pointing to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and and that moment was such a great thing that everything pointed out to the point that we have to go back to him and like I told you moments before [Music] that ministry will not point to a denomination or a Creed or a special man you all should be pointing towards the Lord Jesus Christ and he's the only one there's nobody else worthy of and we're just instruments that is being used amen amen I'm going to be reading a little bit further and that brought U uh satisfaction and there's no man that that's ever visited Calvary and seen the way it was that can be ever the same did you understand and a certain occasion the prophet said I'm no longer the same after he has already had an experience with the angel I'm no longer the same the bride is the bride and we're part of that bride we're not we're no longer the same as we were before we should be be someone different and this should be Transforming Our Hearts and our lives and our bodies Hallelujah certainly we get sick and we get up to a certain age and where we start forgetting things but there are moments in life that you will never be able to forget and that should be the moment that he rescue you that moment that he came to your life Hallelujah everything that he ever desired or longed for is met when he reaches that place it was such an important day and such an important thing it shook the world it shook the world like it was never shook before when Jesus died at Calvary and paid that sin [Music] question this sinful world had a a [Music] blackout this sinful world had a blackout the sun went down in the middle of the day and it had a nervous uh prostration and today the world the nature is crying out that it's in birth pains why for the manifestation of the sons of God and in that [Music] moment nature was trembling and crying out for its creator that was in that place now notice there's an eclipse that's approaching and they say it's something extraordinary that the moon is going to get in front of I don't really fully understand the whole thing about it but in certain parts of the world and the land and in Mexico and the United States is going to get a blackout but Brothers it closely resembles that day on Calvary in a certain occasion and then I don't know how many years ago there was an eclipse that in California was blacked out and the piece of the world right now is just like out the window and there's no country in the world that going to be secure there's no nation and there's no location that's secure and in that time when laas got out the Pope John Paul came to uh the city called was imagine the pope came and settled down on a city called I was you know what Waters mean amen that means people look and the people were in their minds going czy in certain areas of the world is going completely crazy with man's inventions and then on the other side there's a group of people that are getting ready to leave and they keep telling us that we're crazy something missing in their brains I think what was missing in US was already been found it's him blessed be the name of the Lord notice the sun went down in the middle of the day and maybe the scientists might have said that there was an eclipse at that time over there but that didn't happen and there was a nervous postra and the Rocks shook the mountains rent and the dead bodies bursted and if you would like to see it I'm going to be reading off from verse 51 and 52 and verse 53 be reading off of Matthew 27 51 and behold the veil of the temple was rent and Twain From the top to the bottom and and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and 52 and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and a certain message brother BR I believe he said that Abraham and Sarah will walk him in the midst of them and they said they they saw and they went to go hide Hallelujah and verse 53 and came out of the graves after this resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many I don't think there was many people who noticed what happened that time imagine because they didn't know what their the faces look like of the people of old time and we have technology today that'll kind of let us know how they people look in a certain way and uh the brothers are very astonished what did that do uh the Lord uh placed his Target on that day of Calvary Hallelujah excuse me Hallelujah God zeroed in C on Calvary and he wounded that animal called Satan forever and brother bam said that Satan was knocked out on that day of Calvary and he gave him a a right hook and his liver now notice in the message the souls in prison now we notice that the Lord Jesus Christ when he died on the day of Calvary and he spoke in in tongues and he said uh uh why hast Thou forsaken me and uh one of the thieves that was being there crucified he told one of them this day you shall surely be with me over there in heaven so he didn't waste time he went directly he went to that uh appointed place and then he went unto the Souls that were in prison who did not repent on the days of Noah and he said that he arrived there into that place of hell and he saw that the devil was having a party there and he did not expect what was coming that's why brother bam said that he gave a and he took the keys of hell and the grave and he kicked them on the behind and he threw him out Hallelujah and now notice and it was something very tremendous and there's really no explanation for this and someone might ask why is it the reason that he went down to those Souls that were in prison already uh and brother B says that I perceive that in this moment we have the same thing and we know and we understand that that moment still hasn't come but we see that in in reality that there are some people that right now are living in hell with their homes already destroyed the lives destroyed and it's something very displeasing to Liv and a Christian in no way or shape or form should be living in that condition because we have him and if we have him then we have everything because he did everything on that day of Calvary and he said it is consumed or is finished and he knew that he was going to overcome death and he knew that he was going to raise up on a Sunday morning why because he had already done it before why is that you were already written there on that land's Book of Life he did it for you and me blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to be reading another verse uh verse 61 uh the price that was paid 6 and the price that was paid and the bondage of Satan was broke God put back into the hands of man now notice God put back into the hands of man what did he put a way back to what he was looking for a way back home hlu Hallelujah maybe the devil can hit us brother bam says that the devil can tear me up in a thousand pieces whatever he wants to do but even if he sends me down into hell even there I will worship him but it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do Brothers God already put a seal in us and the devil was sealed out completely out and so then now you are SE and the devil can no longer do anything to you becom old I have gray [Music] hairs and I may have uh skin and I see that death is coming to my life the more time that passes and the more that I see myself in the mirror I see mirror you're such a liar I'm much closer to him I'm way much closer to him it doesn't matter what your neighbor says it doesn't matter what they tell you at the job it doesn't matter what the devil tells you there is a place that's already provided and a place that's there and a way back home now notice and there are people that are just like pharaoh and Egypt in that time that Moses one day came in and to tell Pharaoh about the frogs do you want us to take him away and he said no tomorrow and there's also a certain title called Another Day with the frogs what a tremendous message amen I don't want another day I don't want another day with this bad temper that I [Music] got and I don't want another day a single day with the uh rage I want to see him blessed be the name I'm going to be continue reading on here he had to weep no more he accepted when he broke the backbone of Satan there at Calvary listen have you heard some of those people that keep saying or that are always there with some kind of sickness and they keep blaming Satan and they keep saying this devil has me in this condition this that another and may God have mercy on us and there are some people that go to the hospitals and then they come out with two or three more and it seems like they rescue other people from their sicknesses and then they carry it on their [Music] backs but thanks God there somebody who took all the sins and all the and we have no more reason to be saying my sickness my pain my this that or the other if he has already done it for you when he had already said it is finished oh Hallelujah I'm going to finish with this when he broke the backbone of Satan there at Calvary that's the reason brother this moment at Calvary that I received on behalf of the Lord that certain moment can't be removed from my heart uh he broke the backbone of Si Satan Calvary the of sin and sickness and it brings every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God not with the presence of the greatest doctor here on Earth no but unto the presence of God with the sins forgiven hallelujah hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more can Satan black us out from God and on that day when he was going on GE uh to the place that they call Calvary can you imagine how he was going the poor young man of 33 years old a young man even though he looked like he was already 50 he was carrying that cross and he couldn't carry that cross and they G and they told a man by the name of Simon to help carry the Bible or the the cross Hallelujah yes his name was S I believe I don't believe that the script says that he was a colored man but I read it and heard it somewhere and brother I don't know how that trajectory came into Cal I don't know what the scenario looked like or what the landscape looked like if it was nice and paved or or rugged but on route to that place his body was already shattered into pieces and he couldn't go more with his body he couldn't there get there and he was just dragging himself and he came to that place brother and everybody was against him oh Hallelujah and it was such a cruel moment can you imagine when they laid him on the cross and just to think that when you kind of uh throw a nail on your foot and like even your soul hurts when you get to that pain you just scream out with a loud holler and on himself he had Nails going through his hands and his feet and he had a crown of thorns placed upon him can you imagine oh God Mary and his brothers were there they were all watching there as disciples and they had left him and notice I'm almost done here Hallelujah now notice what it says here and paragraph number 62 on that day on Calvary but on that day on Calvary it was not a lamb on this Earth but it was a lamb of God that was dying just uh bathed in his blood smitten and uh spat on see he was smacked and everything in uh the tears coming down Hallelujah he was hacked chopped and beat and spit on and [Music] slammed 73 M when Abel's lamb [Music] died it died speaking in a language that Abel could not understand it was bleeding and when God's lamb died on that day of calvary he spoke in a language that no one could understand him my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me it was God's lamb hack to Pieces notice and many times we speak about job which he really suffered much but it wasn't compared unto what he suffered it doesn't compare by anything not only did it pay our the price of our sins but he also paid the price and opened up a way for us to be able to follow him amen follow him that's what Calvary means to us to follow him to follow him there's no reason for minister to be behind a Poe if he doesn't follow him and the prophet of this day told us who who's greater a minister or an angel up in heaven or a minister down here behind a Pulpit an angel behind a Pulpit don't go to an extreme brother but God speaks behind a minister behind his ministry so we should be praying for the ministry and there's something very tremendous here the perfect sacrifice made us perfect and you may say that I got so many mistakes and problems that can but Jesus said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect and so then there's nothing less than we could be perfect with the presence of God he himself within his church makes it perfect but it has to be him it always has to be him if your sins were like what your sins shall be white as snow uh Scarlet Red blessed be the name of the Lord do you love him do you believe that there are still ministers that can stand and preach this and I believe brothers that if the ministry would be allow themselves to be led by God that would change the situation that changes everything that gives us security that gives the people security because the minister is not compromised with a certain denomination or compromised with a certain way but is only with his word and that's what God's pointing to us on this day so that we follow him that we serve him blessed be the that day on Calvary that day of crucifix that precious day let us pray loveed God oh lamb what else could I say Lord because you have said everything and you have everything ready for us Lord help us to be ready for whatever is to come help us Lord and have mercy on each and every one of us help us Lord thank you for everything that you give us thank you Lord in the precious
