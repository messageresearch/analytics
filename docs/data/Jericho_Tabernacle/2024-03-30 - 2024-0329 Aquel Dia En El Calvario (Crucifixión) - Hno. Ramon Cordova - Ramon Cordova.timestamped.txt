[25:47] presence in this
[25:48] [Music]
[25:52] place being that this is such a great
[25:54] day for us
[25:57] oh
[26:01] in a day like this you were walking on
[26:03] your way to
[26:08] Calvary and Lord we have no way of being
[26:10] able to repay
[26:15] you but we ask in this hour that you
[26:18] prepare our
[26:19] hearts and that you help
[26:22] [Music]
[26:25] us Lord thank you for all the things
[26:27] that you've given
[26:37] and Lord on that day when you were taken
[26:38] up by hands of
[26:45] iniquity and you were cut to pieces and
[26:48] spat
[26:52] on and Lord you were hanging there on
[26:54] that
[26:57] cross
[26:59] bleeding and
[27:03] dying and it seemed like there was no
[27:05] hope coming from
[27:13] anywhere until you cried out Lord Lord
[27:16] why hast Thou forsaken me
[27:24] oh thank you for that sacrifice that you
[27:26] made on Calvary
[27:29] thank you
[27:32] Lord we place this into your
[27:36] hands in the precious name of the Lord
[27:38] Jesus Christ amen amen
[27:41] [Music]
[27:48] amen we're going to go straight into the
[27:50] scriptures onto Matthew
[27:53] [Music]
[27:57] 27 on verse
[28:00] [Music]
[28:09] [Music]
[28:17] 27 going to be reading up to verse 31
[28:20] but I did comment that I was going to
[28:21] read up to verse
[28:26] 54 and perhaps maybe later on I might
[28:29] take a couple more
[28:32] scriptures and if you have the
[28:33] scriptures if you wouldn't mind saying
[28:45] amen then the soldiers of the governor
[28:48] took Jesus into the the common Hall and
[28:50] gathered unto him the whole band of
[28:57] soldiers
[28:59] thear and they stripped him and put on
[29:02] him a Scarlet
[29:20] robe and when they had planted a crown
[29:22] of thorns they put it upon his head and
[29:26] a and a read in his his right hand and
[29:29] they bowed the knee before him and
[29:31] mocked him saying hail King of the
[29:39] Jews and they spit upon him and took the
[29:43] Reed and smote him on the
[29:55] head and after that they had mocked him
[29:58] they took the robe off from him and put
[30:00] his own reignment on him and led him
[30:03] away to crucify him
[30:06] amen if you wouldn't mind taking your
[30:13] seats my desire is that the Lord bless
[30:18] you and like I said it it's a great
[30:21] pleasure to be amongst you once
[30:26] again and we try to serve the Lord as
[30:28] best as we
[30:32] can I would like to talk about a little
[30:34] bit of what the crucifixion
[30:38] is and I'm going to be reading off of
[30:40] the message that day on
[30:47] Calvary and the definition of
[30:56] crucifixion uh put someone to death by
[30:58] nailing or binding them to a
[31:04] cross and now how is it that a
[31:06] crucifixion comes to
[31:15] happen uh crucifixion is one of the
[31:18] worst torments that a human mind can
[31:20] ever
[31:25] endure it was invented during in the
[31:28] Persian era uh back in the
[31:31] day uh before
[31:37] Christ and from there it was spread out
[31:39] to the medit Mediterranean
[31:44] area the old Greece and the Roman
[31:52] Empire and in reality I don't know when
[31:55] was the last time a crucifixion was
[32:00] but it was a very shameful
[32:10] act and it was something very shameful
[32:13] and and in reality and none of the other
[32:14] crucifixions that were ever
[32:18] done was it ever more shameful to the
[32:21] crucifixion that Jesus Christ
[32:25] endured and it's been known until
[32:34] us if we have a River to
[32:37] Cross uh in part from the
[32:41] Lord if we ever have any
[32:44] mountains that it seems like we can't
[32:45] get
[32:48] over we know that there's somebody who
[32:50] specializes in
[32:55] that that he was able to do it
[32:59] for a certain
[33:02] purpose that crucifixion had a certain
[33:07] purpose it was something very
[33:13] unusual because of the same God that you
[33:15] believe and I believe
[33:20] in he went searching throughout the
[33:22] heavens and the
[33:23] Earth and there was nobody found worthy
[33:26] of nobody in nowhere was ever worthy of
[33:33] it and he did it in such a way that only
[33:35] he could do
[33:39] it
[33:42] Hallelujah that day on
[33:49] Calvary our minds as a believer in this
[33:56] message and hearing that Praise of that
[33:58] day on
[34:02] Calvary that help helps us to be able to
[34:05] time trouble onto that day that
[34:14] happened I'm going to be reading off of
[34:16] uh the paragraph number 41 from this
[34:24] message uh brother B didn't preach this
[34:26] on the Good Friday
[34:39] it seems like it would be a little out
[34:40] of season this should be on a good
[34:46] Friday Calvary should be remembered
[34:48] every
[34:51] day just as we're Christians every
[34:53] single
[34:56] day
[34:58] just like the Christian brother should
[35:00] act like a Christian every single
[35:03] day when we've heard so much of
[35:07] that and we've heard so many
[35:11] preachers and the majority of the
[35:13] preachers that we have
[35:18] today their main theme should be
[35:20] pointing the souls onto the day on
[35:23] Calvary that should be the main
[35:26] thing not some kind of
[35:29] organization not some kind of
[35:32] denomination a group of men or a church
[35:36] but over there where he was
[35:39] crucified blessed be the name of the
[35:45] Lord and we've heard so much about it
[35:48] read
[35:51] so and many preachers have preached uh
[35:54] since the beginning of
[35:56] time some have written
[36:03] wrong but my beloved brother that person
[36:05] who is actually Guided by
[36:08] God he has to write it down just exactly
[36:11] as he said just exactly as what it
[36:17] happened that day on Calvary was such a
[36:20] glorious day for us a glorious
[36:26] thing and he already perceived them
[36:28] before the foundation
[36:30] world he came onto his own and his own
[36:32] received them
[36:36] not but there is a group of people
[36:40] that a group that has been called out to
[36:42] be called in his
[36:44] name blessed be the name of the
[36:48] Lord
[36:53] hallelujah the singers have sung of
[36:56] it
[36:58] how many songs aren't
[36:59] there how much inspiration
[37:03] has there's a song called at the
[37:06] cross I'm going to try to sing it to you
[37:07] for a little
[37:18] bit at the cross at the
[37:26] cross
[37:31] I don't have a himn book
[37:33] here but we've sung that song for many
[37:36] times
[37:38] amen and it comes back to my memory
[37:40] about 20 years
[37:44] ago when I began working for a
[37:48] company they sent us to a certain place
[37:51] called
[37:55] uh and there was a certain movie play
[37:57] that was called the passion Christ it's
[38:00] been roughly about 20 years now now
[38:04] notice when that movie first came out
[38:06] and everybody see it I didn't see it
[38:09] right then and there but later on it was
[38:12] something very tremendous there were
[38:14] some people who
[38:17] died from the impression of seeing that
[38:26] movie
[38:28] but I want to tell you that it wasn't at
[38:29] full capacity but it was just that part
[38:31] of what really
[38:35] happened how was it
[38:37] then if you weren't
[38:41] there but beloved brother he did it for
[38:44] you and
[38:44] me what a tremendous
[38:49] thing now notice the singers have
[38:52] Su throughout the
[38:56] ages and the prophets prophesied
[39:02] it and the prophet says 4,000 years
[39:04] before it ever
[39:09] happened and the prophets of this day
[39:12] point back to when it did
[39:16] happen it's such an important
[39:23] day it's one of the most important days
[39:26] of all the days that God ever let down
[39:29] on
[39:34] Earth that day my brother the son came
[39:37] out the son of
[39:41] Justice
[39:44] why because there was a certain somebody
[39:47] there at that
[39:48] time that had overcome death the
[39:53] [Applause]
[39:55] burial and this day
[40:00] many people go out to the
[40:03] oceans
[40:04] country many people go out to
[40:08] vacation or they go out
[40:11] somewhere and we're talking about
[40:15] Christians and people out in the world
[40:17] well they think that they're doing it
[40:18] all
[40:19] right over there in that
[40:23] town There's a bit of Prophecy
[40:26] there
[40:29] they try to simulate the crucifixion of
[40:31] the Lord
[40:33] Jesus and then there's some people that
[40:35] they put him on a cross
[40:46] there but in reality just ignoring what
[40:49] really happened they will never
[40:50] understand the capacity or the magnitude
[40:53] of what really happened oh
[40:55] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[40:59] Lord and it's such an important thing
[41:01] that day on Calvary for
[41:14] Humanity and let's see three important
[41:16] things that are significant to us for
[41:19] that
[41:20] day let's begin with the first
[41:26] one
[41:29] because in reality this was something
[41:30] that was really
[41:34] outstanding I'm going to be reading from
[41:36] paragraph
[41:44] 44 uh the one great important thing at
[41:47] that Calvary means to us on and the
[41:54] world is that it settled the sin
[41:56] question one once for
[41:58] all once for
[42:03] all see we were in sin and we were born
[42:06] in sin and we were already
[42:11] lost and the man was found guilty of
[42:17] sin and that was one of the reasons why
[42:19] he had to go
[42:21] to to be able to redeem a fallen uh uh
[42:25] Society or or human race
[42:30] and sin was a penalty that no man could
[42:34] pay the penalty was so
[42:39] great until there was there wasn't
[42:41] anyone that could pay that
[42:45] penalty I truly believe that God
[42:47] ordained it in that
[42:51] way that the penalty would be so great
[42:53] that no man could pay
[42:56] it
[42:57] so he could do it
[43:01] himself so that only he
[43:09] himself like I said previously that he
[43:11] couldn't find anybody worthy enough to
[43:13] and there was nobody
[43:15] worthy I couldn't die for
[43:18] you my father couldn't die for
[43:23] us and those great preachers couldn't
[43:25] die for
[43:26] us
[43:28] only he himself had to die for us there
[43:31] was only one worthy
[43:33] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[43:38] Lord now the penalty of sin was
[43:42] death and we were all born in sin shaped
[43:46] in
[43:48] iniquity come into this world speaking
[43:51] lies
[43:54] therefore there wasn't none of us that
[43:56] was Worthy
[44:00] or they could find no one that on Earth
[44:02] that was
[44:06] worthy and we know that sin did not
[44:08] begin here on Earth it began in
[44:14] heaven and we understand that uh Satan
[44:18] uh deceived two-thirds of
[44:21] heaven and sin began in
[44:24] Earth blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:27] now notice
[44:35] Hallelujah and we said that there was
[44:37] three outstanding points that we should
[44:39] uh be aware
[44:45] of and I have it written down here give
[44:54] me I'm not a very good teacher
[45:00] and I'm aware that there are some
[45:01] brothers that are great teachers that
[45:02] don't need so much
[45:06] education well there was a brother over
[45:08] there in
[45:10] Mexico didn't he didn't even finish
[45:12] elementary
[45:19] school and he would quote the messages
[45:21] and scriptures and and you would see
[45:24] how he would make everything fall into
[45:26] place
[45:27] and we understand that that's a gift
[45:28] from God and we said that there was
[45:29] three things
[45:32] amen the
[45:35] first we should find the significance of
[45:37] that
[45:39] day the second
[45:43] point we should see what that day did
[45:45] for did for
[45:48] us what he did for
[45:51] us the
[45:55] Third now we should look at what we
[45:58] should do because of
[46:00] that what should we do because of that
[46:09] day now we understand that he was
[46:11] supposed to die for our
[46:19] sins and what was the reason for dying
[46:21] was because he had to save the race that
[46:23] was fallen and
[46:25] said
[46:27] his children were fallen in
[46:35] sin and the only way to bring us back
[46:37] home was to be able to die on that day
[46:39] on
[46:42] Calvary I'm going to be reading another
[46:44] part and I do ask that you excuse me for
[46:46] reading so
[46:47] much I'm going to be reading from
[46:49] paragraph
[46:51] 53 and paragraph
[46:55] 54
[46:59] finally one day that's the day of
[47:04] Calvary there was one that came down
[47:06] from
[47:09] Glory one by the name of Jesus
[47:12] Christ the son of God who came from
[47:19] glory and Calvary was formed and that
[47:21] was the day that the the price was
[47:25] paid
[47:29] and the sin question was settled
[47:37] forever and it opened up the way unto
[47:40] this thing that we're hungering and
[47:41] thirsting
[47:46] for and that's the reason why the Lord
[47:48] put the fivefold ministry into the
[47:55] church and every gift that the lord gave
[47:57] us in the
[48:05] ministry we're just Servants of the Lord
[48:07] Jesus
[48:16] Christ and we shouldn't be pointing to
[48:18] ourselves but we should be pointing
[48:20] towards
[48:21] Calvary unto what he's already
[48:25] done
[48:30] and we have nothing else more to do but
[48:32] to just live what he has already given
[48:34] us to live it and to preach
[48:40] it in such a manner that he would if he
[48:43] was to come tomorrow or if he was to
[48:45] come
[48:52] tonight why because each and every one
[48:54] of us should be ready and prepared for
[48:55] that time oh Hallelujah
[49:01] why is that because we're pointing to
[49:03] the coming of the Lord Jesus
[49:15] Christ and and that moment was such a
[49:17] great thing that everything pointed out
[49:19] to the point that we have to go back to
[49:22] him and like I told you moments
[49:25] before
[49:26] [Music]
[49:31] that ministry will not point to a
[49:32] denomination or a
[49:34] Creed or a special
[49:38] man you all should be pointing towards
[49:40] the Lord Jesus Christ and he's the only
[49:44] one there's nobody else worthy
[49:47] of and we're just instruments that is
[49:50] being used amen
[49:53] amen I'm going to be reading a little
[49:55] bit further
[50:01] and that brought U uh
[50:10] satisfaction and there's no man that
[50:13] that's ever visited
[50:18] Calvary and seen the way it
[50:23] was that can be ever the same
[50:28] did you
[50:30] understand and a certain occasion the
[50:31] prophet
[50:33] said I'm no longer the
[50:36] same after he has already had an
[50:38] experience with the
[50:40] angel I'm no longer the
[50:45] same the bride is the
[50:49] bride and we're part of that
[50:52] bride we're not we're no longer the same
[50:55] as we were before we should be be
[50:56] someone
[50:59] different and this should be
[51:01] Transforming Our Hearts and our lives
[51:02] and our bodies
[51:05] Hallelujah certainly we get
[51:10] sick and we get up to a certain age and
[51:13] where we start forgetting
[51:14] things but there are
[51:17] moments in
[51:20] life that you will never be able to
[51:25] forget
[51:28] and that should be the moment that he
[51:29] rescue
[51:30] you that moment that he came to your
[51:33] life
[51:44] Hallelujah everything that he ever
[51:46] desired or longed
[51:48] for is
[51:50] met when he reaches that
[51:54] place it was such an important day
[51:58] and such an important
[52:05] thing it shook the
[52:17] world it shook the world like it was
[52:19] never shook
[52:25] before when Jesus died at Calvary and
[52:28] paid that sin
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] question this sinful world had a a
[52:36] [Music]
[52:38] blackout this sinful world had a
[52:43] blackout the sun went down in the middle
[52:45] of the
[52:48] day and it had a nervous uh
[52:55] prostration
[52:58] and today the world the nature is crying
[53:01] out that it's in birth pains
[53:06] why for the manifestation of the sons of
[53:09] God and in that
[53:13] [Music]
[53:16] moment nature was trembling and crying
[53:20] out for its creator that was in that
[53:25] place
[53:28] now notice there's an eclipse that's
[53:38] approaching and they say it's something
[53:40] extraordinary that the moon is going to
[53:41] get in front
[53:45] of I don't really fully understand the
[53:47] whole thing about it but in certain
[53:48] parts of the world and the land and in
[53:50] Mexico and the United States is going to
[53:51] get a
[53:55] blackout
[53:56] but Brothers it closely resembles that
[53:58] day on
[54:00] Calvary in a certain
[54:05] occasion and then I don't know how many
[54:07] years ago there was an
[54:10] eclipse that in
[54:13] California was blacked
[54:21] out and the piece of the world right now
[54:23] is just like out the
[54:25] window and there's no country in the
[54:27] world that going to be
[54:29] secure there's no nation and there's no
[54:31] location that's
[54:33] secure and in that time when laas got
[54:39] out the Pope John Paul came to uh the
[54:42] city called
[54:44] was
[54:53] imagine the pope came and settled down
[54:56] on a city called I
[54:58] was you know what Waters mean amen that
[55:01] means
[55:03] people
[55:10] look and the people were in their minds
[55:13] going
[55:20] czy in certain areas of the world is
[55:22] going completely crazy with man's
[55:25] inventions
[55:29] and then on the other side there's a
[55:30] group of
[55:31] people that are getting ready to
[55:34] leave and they keep telling us that
[55:36] we're crazy something missing in their
[55:40] brains I think what was missing in US
[55:43] was already been found it's
[55:45] him blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:52] notice the sun went down in the middle
[55:54] of the day
[56:02] and maybe the scientists might have said
[56:03] that there was an eclipse at that time
[56:05] over
[56:06] there but that didn't happen and there
[56:09] was a nervous
[56:11] postra and the Rocks
[56:14] shook the mountains
[56:20] rent and the dead bodies
[56:24] bursted and if you would like to see
[56:32] it I'm going to be reading off from
[56:34] verse 51 and
[56:36] 52 and verse
[56:46] 53 be reading off of Matthew 27 51 and
[56:50] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[56:52] and Twain From the top to the
[56:55] bottom and and the Earth did quake and
[56:57] the Rocks
[56:59] rent and
[57:07] 52 and the graves were open and many
[57:09] bodies of the Saints which slept
[57:18] arose and a certain message brother BR I
[57:21] believe he said that Abraham and Sarah
[57:22] will walk him in the midst of
[57:24] them and they said they they saw and
[57:27] they went to go hide
[57:31] Hallelujah and verse
[57:40] 53 and came out of the graves after this
[57:42] resurrection and went into the holy city
[57:44] and appeared unto
[57:48] many I don't think there was many people
[57:50] who noticed what happened that
[57:55] time
[58:00] imagine because they didn't know what
[58:02] their the faces look like of the people
[58:04] of old
[58:14] time and we have technology today
[58:16] that'll kind of let us know how they
[58:18] people look in a certain way and uh the
[58:20] brothers are very
[58:23] astonished what did that do
[58:29] uh the Lord uh placed his Target on that
[58:32] day of
[58:39] Calvary
[58:52] Hallelujah excuse
[58:55] me
[58:58] Hallelujah God zeroed in C on Calvary
[59:01] and he wounded that animal called Satan
[59:07] forever and brother bam said that Satan
[59:09] was knocked out on that day of
[59:12] Calvary and he gave him a a right hook
[59:14] and his liver now
[59:18] notice in the message the souls in
[59:20] prison
[59:25] now
[59:26] we notice that the Lord Jesus
[59:29] Christ when he died on the day of
[59:36] Calvary and he spoke in in
[59:43] tongues and he said uh uh why hast Thou
[59:47] forsaken
[59:55] me
[59:56] and uh one of the thieves that was being
[59:58] there
[1:00:01] crucified he told one of them this day
[1:00:04] you shall surely be with me over there
[1:00:05] in
[1:00:08] heaven so he didn't waste time he went
[1:00:14] directly he went to that uh appointed
[1:00:18] place and then he
[1:00:24] went unto the Souls that were in prison
[1:00:26] who did not repent on the days of
[1:00:30] Noah and he said that he arrived there
[1:00:32] into that place of
[1:00:40] hell and he saw that the devil was
[1:00:42] having a party
[1:00:46] there and he did not expect what was
[1:00:53] coming that's why brother bam said that
[1:00:55] he gave a
[1:00:57] and he took the
[1:00:59] keys of hell and the
[1:01:04] grave and he kicked them on the behind
[1:01:07] and he threw him out
[1:01:10] Hallelujah and now
[1:01:15] notice and it was something very
[1:01:17] tremendous and there's really no
[1:01:18] explanation for
[1:01:24] this
[1:01:27] and someone might ask why is it the
[1:01:28] reason that he went down to those Souls
[1:01:29] that were in prison
[1:01:36] already uh and brother B says that I
[1:01:38] perceive that in this moment we have the
[1:01:40] same
[1:01:47] thing and we know and we understand that
[1:01:49] that moment still hasn't
[1:01:54] come
[1:01:56] but we see that in in reality that there
[1:01:58] are some people that right now are
[1:01:59] living in
[1:02:01] hell with their homes already destroyed
[1:02:04] the lives
[1:02:08] destroyed and it's something very
[1:02:09] displeasing to
[1:02:15] Liv and a Christian in no way or shape
[1:02:18] or form should be living in that
[1:02:22] condition because we have him
[1:02:27] and if we have him then we have
[1:02:31] everything because he did everything on
[1:02:33] that day of
[1:02:34] Calvary and he said it is consumed or is
[1:02:38] finished and he knew that he was going
[1:02:40] to overcome
[1:02:43] death and he knew that he was going to
[1:02:44] raise up on a Sunday
[1:02:47] morning why because he had already done
[1:02:49] it
[1:02:54] before why is that you were already
[1:02:56] written there on that land's Book of
[1:02:58] Life he did it for you and
[1:03:01] me blessed be the name of the
[1:03:06] Lord I'm going to be reading another
[1:03:09] verse uh verse
[1:03:18] 61 uh the price that was
[1:03:24] paid
[1:03:32] 6 and the price that was paid and the
[1:03:35] bondage of Satan was
[1:03:39] broke God put back into the hands of
[1:03:44] man now notice God put back into the
[1:03:47] hands of
[1:03:48] man what did he
[1:03:53] put a way back to what he was looking
[1:03:55] for
[1:03:58] a way back home hlu
[1:04:04] Hallelujah maybe the devil can hit
[1:04:10] us brother bam
[1:04:13] says that the devil can tear me up in a
[1:04:16] thousand pieces whatever he wants to
[1:04:24] do but even if he sends me down into
[1:04:27] hell even there I will worship
[1:04:32] him but it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:04:33] tries to do
[1:04:37] Brothers God already put a seal in
[1:04:41] us and the devil was sealed out
[1:04:44] completely
[1:04:47] out and so then now you are
[1:04:51] SE and the devil can no longer do
[1:04:53] anything to
[1:04:54] you becom old I have gray
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:00] hairs and I may have uh
[1:05:04] skin and I see that death is coming to
[1:05:06] my
[1:05:10] life the more time that passes and the
[1:05:12] more that I see myself in the mirror I
[1:05:14] see mirror you're such a liar I'm much
[1:05:17] closer to him I'm way much closer to
[1:05:20] him it doesn't matter what your neighbor
[1:05:23] says it doesn't matter what they tell
[1:05:25] you at the
[1:05:26] job it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:05:28] tells you there is a
[1:05:31] place that's already provided and a
[1:05:34] place that's
[1:05:37] there and a way back
[1:05:40] home now
[1:05:44] notice and there are
[1:05:50] people that are just like pharaoh and
[1:05:52] Egypt in that
[1:05:54] time that Moses one day came
[1:05:59] in and to tell Pharaoh about the
[1:06:03] frogs do you want us to take him
[1:06:07] away and he said no
[1:06:12] tomorrow and there's also a certain
[1:06:15] title called Another Day with the
[1:06:17] frogs what a tremendous message
[1:06:20] amen I don't want another
[1:06:24] day I don't want another day with this
[1:06:26] bad temper that I
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:28] got and I don't want another day a
[1:06:30] single day with the uh rage I want to
[1:06:34] see
[1:06:36] him blessed be the name I'm going to be
[1:06:39] continue reading on
[1:06:45] here he had to weep no
[1:06:48] more he
[1:06:53] accepted when he broke the backbone of
[1:06:57] Satan there at
[1:07:03] Calvary listen have you heard some of
[1:07:05] those people that keep
[1:07:09] saying or that are always there with
[1:07:11] some kind of
[1:07:13] sickness and they keep blaming
[1:07:16] Satan and they keep saying this devil
[1:07:18] has me in this condition this that
[1:07:23] another and may God have mercy on
[1:07:29] us and there are some people that go to
[1:07:31] the
[1:07:35] hospitals and then they come out with
[1:07:37] two or three
[1:07:42] more and it seems like they rescue other
[1:07:44] people from their sicknesses and then
[1:07:45] they carry it on their
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:51] backs but thanks God there somebody who
[1:07:54] took all the sins and all the
[1:07:57] and we have no more reason to be saying
[1:07:59] my sickness my
[1:08:02] pain my this that or the
[1:08:06] other if he has already done it for
[1:08:10] you when he had already said it is
[1:08:12] finished oh
[1:08:17] Hallelujah I'm going to finish with
[1:08:24] this
[1:08:30] when he broke the backbone of Satan
[1:08:31] there at
[1:08:32] Calvary that's the reason
[1:08:40] brother this moment at Calvary that I
[1:08:44] received on behalf of the
[1:08:48] Lord that certain moment can't be
[1:08:50] removed from my
[1:08:53] heart uh he broke the backbone of Si
[1:08:55] Satan Calvary the of sin and
[1:09:00] sickness and it brings every Mortal
[1:09:05] being on the earth back into the
[1:09:08] presence of
[1:09:10] God not with the presence of the
[1:09:12] greatest doctor here on
[1:09:14] Earth no but unto the presence of
[1:09:17] God with the sins forgiven hallelujah
[1:09:22] hallelujah our sins are forgiven
[1:09:27] no more can Satan black us out from
[1:09:31] God and on that day when he was going on
[1:09:36] GE uh to the place that they call
[1:09:40] Calvary can you imagine how he was
[1:09:44] going the poor young man of 33 years old
[1:09:47] a young
[1:09:48] man even though he looked like he was
[1:09:50] already
[1:09:52] 50 he was carrying that cross
[1:09:59] and he couldn't carry that
[1:10:04] cross and they G and they told a man by
[1:10:07] the name of Simon to help carry the
[1:10:09] Bible or the the cross
[1:10:15] Hallelujah yes his name was
[1:10:18] S I
[1:10:23] believe I don't believe that the script
[1:10:25] says that he was a colored man but I
[1:10:26] read it and heard it
[1:10:31] somewhere and brother I don't know how
[1:10:33] that trajectory came into
[1:10:39] Cal I don't know what the scenario
[1:10:41] looked like or what the landscape looked
[1:10:42] like if it was nice and paved or or
[1:10:50] rugged but on route to that place his
[1:10:52] body was already shattered into pieces
[1:10:57] and he couldn't go more with his body he
[1:11:00] couldn't there get
[1:11:03] there and he was just dragging
[1:11:06] himself and he came to that place
[1:11:10] brother and everybody was against him oh
[1:11:15] Hallelujah and it was such a cruel
[1:11:19] moment can you
[1:11:23] imagine when they laid him on the
[1:11:30] cross and just to think that when you
[1:11:32] kind of uh throw a nail on your
[1:11:36] foot and like even your soul hurts when
[1:11:38] you get to that
[1:11:40] pain you just scream out with a loud
[1:11:51] holler and on himself he had Nails going
[1:11:53] through his hands and his feet
[1:11:57] and he had a crown of thorns placed upon
[1:11:59] him can you
[1:12:03] imagine oh
[1:12:06] God Mary and his brothers were
[1:12:14] there they were all watching there as
[1:12:16] disciples and they had left
[1:12:20] him and notice I'm almost done
[1:12:24] here
[1:12:43] Hallelujah now notice what it says
[1:12:47] here and paragraph number 62 on that day
[1:12:50] on
[1:12:54] Calvary
[1:12:55] but on that day on
[1:12:59] Calvary it was not a lamb on this
[1:13:04] Earth but it was a lamb of God that was
[1:13:11] dying just uh bathed in his
[1:13:17] blood smitten and uh spat
[1:13:21] on
[1:13:24] see
[1:13:28] he was smacked and everything
[1:13:39] in uh the tears coming
[1:13:50] down
[1:13:54] Hallelujah
[1:13:55] he was hacked chopped and beat and spit
[1:13:57] on and
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:03] slammed 73
[1:14:07] M when Abel's lamb
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:13] died it died speaking in a language that
[1:14:16] Abel could not
[1:14:17] understand it was
[1:14:21] bleeding and when God's lamb died on
[1:14:24] that day of calvary
[1:14:28] he spoke in a language that no one could
[1:14:30] understand
[1:14:33] him my God my God why hast Thou forsaken
[1:14:37] me it was God's
[1:14:40] lamb hack to
[1:14:43] Pieces
[1:14:49] notice and many times we speak about
[1:14:54] job
[1:14:57] which he really suffered
[1:15:01] much but it wasn't compared unto what he
[1:15:05] suffered it doesn't compare by
[1:15:09] anything not only did it pay our the
[1:15:11] price of our
[1:15:14] sins but he also paid the price and
[1:15:16] opened up a
[1:15:19] way for us to be able to follow
[1:15:21] him amen follow him
[1:15:26] that's what Calvary means to
[1:15:28] us to follow
[1:15:31] him to follow
[1:15:39] him there's no reason for minister to be
[1:15:42] behind a Poe if he doesn't follow
[1:15:45] him and the prophet of this day told
[1:15:53] us
[1:15:58] who who's greater a minister or an angel
[1:16:01] up in heaven or a minister down here
[1:16:03] behind a
[1:16:05] Pulpit an angel behind a
[1:16:13] Pulpit don't go to an extreme brother
[1:16:15] but God speaks behind a minister behind
[1:16:18] his
[1:16:21] ministry so we should be praying for the
[1:16:24] ministry
[1:16:27] and there's something very tremendous
[1:16:31] here the perfect sacrifice made us
[1:16:38] perfect and you may say that I got so
[1:16:40] many mistakes and problems that can but
[1:16:43] Jesus
[1:16:48] said be therefore perfect as your father
[1:16:50] in Heaven is perfect and
[1:16:53] so
[1:16:58] then there's nothing less than we could
[1:16:59] be perfect with the presence of
[1:17:06] God he himself within his church makes
[1:17:09] it perfect but it has to be him it
[1:17:12] always has to be
[1:17:15] him if your sins were like
[1:17:23] what your sins shall be white as
[1:17:27] snow uh Scarlet
[1:17:32] Red blessed be the name of the Lord do
[1:17:35] you love
[1:17:40] him do you believe that there are still
[1:17:42] ministers that can stand and preach
[1:17:50] this and I believe brothers that if the
[1:17:52] ministry would be allow themselves to be
[1:17:54] led by
[1:17:56] God that would change the
[1:17:59] situation that changes
[1:18:01] everything that gives us
[1:18:03] security that gives the people
[1:18:07] security because the minister is not
[1:18:10] compromised with a certain
[1:18:12] denomination or compromised with a
[1:18:14] certain way but is only with his
[1:18:22] word and that's what God's pointing to
[1:18:24] us on this
[1:18:25] day so that we follow
[1:18:28] him that we serve
[1:18:31] him blessed be
[1:18:35] the that day on Calvary that day of
[1:18:37] crucifix that precious
[1:18:52] day let us pray
[1:18:55] loveed
[1:18:56] God oh
[1:19:00] lamb what else could I say
[1:19:03] Lord because you have said
[1:19:07] everything and you have everything ready
[1:19:09] for
[1:19:14] us Lord help us to be ready for whatever
[1:19:17] is to
[1:19:18] come help us
[1:19:22] Lord and have mercy on each and every
[1:19:24] one of us
