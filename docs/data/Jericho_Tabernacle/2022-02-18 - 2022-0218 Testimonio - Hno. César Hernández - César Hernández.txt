you are saved [Music] jesus and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus or by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god i'm my whole body is trembling brothers uh i was telling our pastor well how difficult can this be esme testimonial it's my own testimony but by god's grace here we are brothers on one occasion a sunday morning where i went up to pray for the petitions i came back and they're in the back in the office there was brother eli and our pastor and i told our pastor brother i still get really nervous and he said just wait till i put you to preach and he had a smile on his face and he joked up and said yeah right and then i was thinking ah yeah domingo that was a sunday and then by tuesday our brother eli sent to send me a message on whatsapp he sent me the the calendar for the month of january and on that calendar was my name oh my gosh he wasn't kidding and then he wasn't playing about it uh he went with ebola i said well how to do it and also on that calendar yes there was our brother and he was scheduled to speak on a friday right before i was uh and that's when he got coveted and immediately i thought oh my they're going to push me up on the sooner date when i was thinking of that our pastor brother adonis he called me on the phone and i said oh just like i thought it would happen said brother uh i've got some news and i said oh my and he said i'm going to have to push you back because brother luis is going to preach a series it's going to be five messages things happen that way with her pregnancy and and i told the brother well then is this going to be my friday he says well i don't know it all depends on your daughter and my grandson was born my daughter's son hermano lester domingo and so brother louise had to skip that friday and sunday so leo and i still said would you like to just extend it yet another won't be preaching i'll be sharing the testimony and to start off i was born in massachusetts and from massachusetts we moved to the state of nayarit a small little ranch called penitas we were there till i was about 12 to 13 years old i believe and then we moved now to the united states when you arrive to a country like this brothers to a country that's so beautiful when compared to mexico and i say very beautiful because i'm referring to the small ranch that i'm from benitez and every time we go visit my parents there in mexico i always tell my wife oh what a beautiful ranch yeah and when you get to this country when you're a young person it's so easy to grab a hold of the customs of this country when you're young and brothers when i got here my waistline was of size 28. and always uh well strapped and i started going to school miravalo de mars uh [Music] [Music] and they'd approach me and they tell me aren't you embarrassed to dress the way you dress up and i remember that very vividly because back then i had on some blue jeans and a t-shirt with the looney tunes uh and i say this because here in this country that the kids that are around 13 or 14 they they already compose themselves like they're 20 years old they're very advanced and i didn't think nothing about that i kept going to school an uncle of mine that he has a son yes he probably had wore the same size clothing as me peros but if our waistline was about 28.29 the clothing that i then started to use was about size 48 descentura a waistline uh it was some pants that basically i'd get lost in how big they were my dad would give me a heart you'll tease me you tease me you say those pants are so big they'll even fall off from me yes and that's how i started to grow up if we could say i grew up in a strange world and i started to do things that i'm not too proud of saying that i did but like i said not too long ago this is a country that wraps you up there's a saying that says he that wanders with wolves sooner or later is going to learn from them and that's what happened with me my wife told me you better not and i've been here in this country for about four or five months and she told me as we were there in the hallway and for me she's always been someone very beautiful with really beautiful eyes and right away she caught my attention i kept staring at her and her brother told me hey well if you want to i could hook you up i know her yo and then i kept saying no the days went on and i kept looking at her uh and she was at a neighbor's house who was a friend of hers from school and we passed by me and i told my uncle wait wait stop stop i know her yeah and we started to talk for a while and time just started passing by uh they said necessarily during that time her brother passed by and his name is manuel and he told her what are you doing here get in the house and i told her well you know he told me this and that but i didn't know what was going on and i started to visit her at her house i was friends with her brother i'd go and visit her brother pregnant asking for her brother but honestly who i wanted to go and see was her que uh and also my son-in-law started looking for my son to invite him to the movies but you know but it wasn't for my son yo uh and my mother-in-law i'm going to be honest i was scared of her yes she looked very bad it's an expression and i was outside in the yard at her house and talking with my wife and then she arrived with her husband and we'd be seated if we could say like like here yeah she'd open the door to enter into the the house through the yard and she'd enter in like this and just nearly she never told me anything but her expression said enough i don't blame her and my appearance just wasn't uh good enough for a daughter persona and any person that would want they would see the way i dressed in the clothing that i used would see me as a threat [Music] i understand and she had her structure because she was raised in the message and as a young person you know when you like somebody well one way or another you still try and find a way to get with the person we started to talk for some months now yeah uh yes and she bought herself a car brothers uh without even knowing how to drive in hopes that one day her brother would teach her how to drive and that never happened because the reason was he's the one that would take the car and be up and down the streets yes she said you know my brother's always got the car and he never teaches me how to drive can you teach me how to drive and i said sure so you can see your 10 senior sure i'll teach you and she told her mother you know i'm going to teach her how to drive and and her mother told her brother and her brother didn't really like that idea and told her no don't don't let him teach you how to drive because they're going to go out driving alone you know uh and like i said i have them i'm from mexico and i had a certain mentality where uh i wasn't going to go beyond a certain point and for him he would just say don't let them go by themselves yeah uh yeah and my brother told her not to let me go with you alone so i can't go with you that's okay and my mother-in-law at that point in time might see her like such a bad person and then after that i saw her even worse [Music] and and now at that point she'd walk by and she'd even lift her eyebrows and i'd just be like whoa and not too long after that my wife told me you know you know what my mom doesn't want you coming around here no more hey no she don't want you to come visit me and i said okay that's fine then i went out of her yard if we and in my mind i said well she doesn't want me in her house and this is a public place she can't kick me out of here that was around the christmas time um and my wife my brother-in-law my sister-in-law uh that are older yeah hermanos and brothers here that are older uh forgive me that knew my mother-in-law from many years ago my wife my brother-in-law my sister-in-law they struggled a lot as young people because of circumstances where that's just how it needed to be so then when my wife told me that her mother didn't want me in the house no more at that point i was just right over 15 years old and she said and i called my dad and i said you know what i'm going back to mexico and i'm going to take fabi and then the father's sermon the woman she eats the woman needs to be dressed you and i don't know how to do it but i'll i'll figure it out but if you won't take me i'm still going to and i was asking him to take us to where the taxis take us into nogales and yes he came he took us and the same thing he told me he told my wife he told my wife look look dear uh he's never worked he doesn't know how to work are you sure you want to go with him i'm not going to stop you but you better think about it yeah yeah and i tell my dad come on now don't tell her anything but while i was hugging my wife like telling him it's going to be okay and so we went to mexico we went to mexico and my wife said i'm going to call my mother and see what she says and she called him there from a pay phone and my mother-in-law answered his and she said don't be calling here because you don't got a mother no more esposa and i saw my wife that she started to cry and she got so sad and i also felt bad so we went all the way to my ranch like i said we were there for a week and a half [Music] we came back right away because we just didn't make it over there in the front we got there and at the border a man said there you speak english we said yes an american citizen said well just cross over you guys are young just say you're american citizens and we didn't have much we just had one briefcase with her clothes and my clothes and there nogales lives the family of my brother-in-law david barcenas and my wife said let's take our clothing with them we went dropped it off with them we came back to the line to the border and and we got a taxi there in nogales that brought us to tucson because it wouldn't take us all the way to phoenix when we got to tucson the the cab driver told me there's the immigration get your papers ready [Music] and my wife was seated right there in the front next to the cab driver and i was in the back when it was and and she turned around and said well it looks like we're going to have to get off and i didn't have any documents but she had her permits and i said well if they take you out i'll get out too yeah the just say that you're americans and and that that'll be fine because the immigration officer opened the door they got the flashlight to look at me too and american citizen american citizen semicolon and the immigration officer just looked at me for a little bit and he said who's the point guard for the phoenix sun charles barkley i answered charles barkley and i didn't know that's who it was but just because i had heard his name a lot okay he said okay so charles barkley charles barkley allowed me to get back all the way over here we got to tucson from tucson got into another cab yeah we didn't have no more money and the cab driver told the the taxi driver uh take them all the way over there because they don't have no more money he said that's fine i'll take them me and my wife got in and that same taxi there was another couple yeah and that that couple they were coyotes and in the taxi that we were in right in front of us there was a car full of people and the taxi driver was taking care of them by orders of the coyote as we got to a gas station with no money and they bought us food and drinks phoenix and then we arrived all the way to phoenix central and when my mother my mother-in-law found out we were here she didn't want to pick us up there at the station my brother-in-law said i'll go pick them up he went picked us up and took us to my father's apartment my father was very irritated and he scolded us and he told me they're going to put you in jail yeah because my mother-in-law already called me and she threatened me that if i don't i don't report you she's going to put me in jail i said don't worry i'm a miner and she's a miner so they can't touch us and well brothers that's how life went on and then my daughter anna arrived you owe me jose my son cesar you know influence influence and then i started to influence her foreign to not go to church brothers and sisters uh our young brother young sister if you're thinking about starting a friendship with someone make sure that they're a christian because i tried to make life miserable for my my wife in that aspect amigos i had friends that used drugs and they'd be out getting high classes i'm using cocaine and crystal and just all types of drugs whatever you think of you name it i was around it and by god's grace i never had that desire to use the drugs i believe i might have used marijuana and cocaine about three times each in my life and once again because you see and then you start to want it as well but i never became an addict to it we started like that i like to go dancing and i started taking her dancing i buy beer i wasn't really much of a drunk or an alcoholic i'd buy a six-pack and it lasts me a month i'd buy a pack of cigarettes and i never even smoked but my brother-in-law would smoke them and i would see him so then i'd imitate him uh one occasion we went to the doctor's office and my son says that he was little and the doctor told us he had the symptoms of asthma and now asking if anyone smoked around him and i i had a cigarette boxing uh on me and i'm saying no no no i don't question he said if anyone's smoking well he's going to catch asthma we got out of the doctor's office i grabbed a cigarette box i threw in the trash and never again bought one uh and i said i met the message through my wife and my mother-in-law i'd hear them but i never took them seriously i just hear them you're out doing bad things and you don't even remember that god exists you just remember about god when something bad is happening to you or in your life and for me it was difficult to leave behind the life that i knew because i didn't have the structure of a christian life when my wife started to go back to church again she take the children it used to bother me for her to go uh and she just come back from church and she wanted to talk about church and the brothers this is about the church and the church that and and she'd act in a way that i just didn't like she started to dress differently she no longer would wear pants uh and god knows that's what i told her and she'd tell me establish and she said well that's okay if that's what you want to do but i'm not going to stop going to church and taking the kids with me and i tried to make life difficult for her brothers but she never changed her way of thinking uh yes she stayed firm upon what she believed [Music] and i didn't want that change that was happening in her because it was difficult for me to adjust to that change when she'd get home from services i just look at her and the devil would put evil thoughts in me one occasion they got back from a children's church and i see my son daniel and he'd show up singing these songs brothers yeah this little light on mine i'm gonna let it shine he'd be singing this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine and and he'd even uh do these movements and it brought me pleasure to see how he'd come home so happy you know i wouldn't say anything to anybody but i started to see and i started to think that they like that then i started to go to church with them and i felt like i knew that i was going against my own will but they liked it so i kept going not because i wanted to but because they liked it and then i stopped going again um look there's a group of brothers that they gather in different homes every thursday one takes there's a brother that plays the accordion very nice she'd tell me and she knew how to talk to me because she knew that i enjoyed music so the accordion and music well i said okay and then those fellowships i'll mention the names of the brothers that would be there was our brother daniel gutierrez and all these brothers for me was was the structure that i never had they start to talk to me about the message they tell me this and the other uh and i started to enjoy those fellowships i started to go to the services at the church and brother leyva would take me to go to these groups because month after month they would change and he'd take me as an usher and i started to feel as though i pertained to the church i felt like somebody peroves but sometimes when you start to grow spiritually brothers the devil attacks you even more look you do this and you do that um messages many times the things that happen to us in life and we ask ourselves why do you allow this to happen why do you like and brother i couldn't i just see it but i see it now like he's the one doing it brother he doesn't leave a work halfway finished he's going to finish it i thank god for his grace brothers his grace that reached me and here brothers i keep fighting the good fight and i i searched for the meaning of the word grace definition says it's a sign to the concept of favor or goodness mainly when it hasn't been merited or earned especially especially for the sinners if the musicians can come forward i'll be closing soon escomo it's like the anecdote that brother branham says about the woman that was out with the men brothers where they made an old-fashioned uh revival there in in that reunion [Music] it wasn't because that woman did something or because i did something it was because of my god's grace [Music] brother branham says that woman was in those meetings [Music] and now she lives a christian life [Music] perfection it doesn't matter how much you've sinned [Music] how little or how much siges but through jesus [Music] de christ the sacrifices of god is enough [Music] and you're perfected in him forever and just think about it brother no no it's not something you do these are new pages that you turn no no it's not a new life that you begin it's a confession it's a confession of your evil of your wrath and god's grace for you if you could please stand with me [Music] let us pray brothers fathers father of the glory lord jesus [Music] oh how thankful i am father [Music] for those men that you placed in my way [Music] and i know that i'm not perfect lord pero luna costa estoy seguro padre and one thing i'm a sure of father senor that i'm not what i used to be senor migo santos
