[50:20] if you would like to turn with me to
[50:23] romans 10.
[50:32] yes
[50:36] [Music]
[50:45] whenever you have it just go ahead and
[50:46] say amen
[50:50] the bible says
[50:53] if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[50:56] lord jesus and shall believe in thine
[50:59] heart that that god hath raised him from
[51:01] the dead and shall thou shalt be saved
[51:17] for with the heart man believeth unto
[51:20] righteousness
[51:21] and with the mouth
[51:23] confession is made unto salvation
[51:32] in hebrews 10 23.
[51:36] says let us hold fast
[51:38] the profession of our faith without
[51:40] wavering
[51:45] for he is faithful that promised
[51:55] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[51:57] heavenly calling
[51:59] consider apost the apostle and high
[52:02] priest of our profession christ jesus
[52:14] christ
[52:15] let us bow our heads
[52:21] lord we're here humbly lord but boldly
[52:24] in your throne of grace
[52:29] con
[52:30] confiance
[52:32] knowing lord you've paid a price so that
[52:35] we can come and lord and ask anything
[52:37] that we need father
[52:44] lord and that you can give to us eternal
[52:46] life you can give us the words of life
[52:54] i asked lord that you may just take
[52:56] control as you have been of this service
[53:05] lord that you may bless the one that is
[53:08] listening
[53:11] and you can bless us father that you may
[53:13] take full control lord jesus
[53:18] control we thank you in the name of the
[53:20] lord jesus christ
[53:23] amen and amen amen amen amen god bless
[53:26] you you may be seated amen
[53:30] my title this morning
[53:33] is the authority of confession
[53:38] in romans 9 10 it says in
[53:55] and we believe unto righteousness
[53:59] but then our salvation comes
[54:03] from the confession we make the
[54:06] confession
[54:07] from us declaring out of our own mouth
[54:13] our salvation is made because of that
[54:19] now when we hear the word confession
[54:34] that's how our english translation
[54:37] translates
[54:41] we uh confess
[54:43] our wrongs and our faults
[54:48] to admit something that we've done wrong
[54:54] but that english translation quite
[54:57] doesn't
[54:58] uh translate the way it should but
[55:04] the word
[55:18] that's the greek word for it
[55:22] the word homo means the same la palabra
[55:25] significa
[55:26] and logio means to say
[55:31] now the word logio is a is
[55:44] we know that in the beginning was the
[55:46] logos
[55:49] in the beginning was the word and the
[55:51] word was with god and the word was god
[55:53] in the principle
[55:57] so confess doesn't just mean i admit to
[55:59] my wrong entonces confess
[56:10] when he
[56:11] professes something to you
[56:13] professor
[56:14] whenever you read your bible
[56:18] and it says by his stripes you have been
[56:20] healed
[56:24] you take those same words
[56:27] you believe it unto righteousness
[56:31] but then you confess those same words
[56:36] yes lord i am healed
[56:39] and you are saved because of the
[56:42] confession you
[56:52] so confession means to say what god says
[57:07] and i understand i'm a no good sinner
[57:09] that's saved by grace
[57:23] but
[57:24] then there's a time when you're saved
[57:28] then there's a time when you're
[57:29] sanctified
[57:32] you're born again you say the noah and
[57:35] you go on and on and on you go you say
[57:38] it
[57:56] but jesus thoughts aren't our thoughts
[57:59] anymore
[58:02] he thinks of us
[58:07] and whenever we're born again or we're
[58:10] trying to receive more of god
[58:15] yet we're trying to hold on to our old
[58:18] confession of our faults and our
[58:19] failures
[58:26] to being humble doesn't mean to beat
[58:28] yourself up
[58:33] well i'm just humble brother
[58:45] and he's
[58:46] professed that he was god gael professor
[58:50] he said i am the son of god
[58:55] didn't he say that
[58:59] and and today the bride is is being
[59:02] accused
[59:15] jesus he thought it not robbery to call
[59:17] himself equal to god jesus
[59:22] we do not say anything outside of the
[59:24] word
[59:27] i do not say anything other than what
[59:30] has already been established by the word
[59:36] confession means say what he says
[59:41] and they went to jesus and say you man
[59:44] calling yourself
[59:59] and he said and he said that he was
[1:00:01] saying what the bible says
[1:00:06] he says didn't the scriptures say that
[1:00:07] you are gods
[1:00:11] and you get angry at me because i say
[1:00:13] i'm the son of god
[1:00:17] confession means to say what he says not
[1:00:19] what you feel confession
[1:00:24] many times
[1:00:26] we are not even in the place where our
[1:00:28] confession is
[1:00:32] a confession brother branham says in uh
[1:00:35] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:37] and forever
[1:00:41] now you don't now you don't see it ain't
[1:00:44] wait you've uh confessed it
[1:00:46] first and act upon it then the feeling
[1:00:50] comes afterwards
[1:01:09] my
[1:01:10] hair didn't obey my confession
[1:01:16] i i was still bald
[1:01:19] you know my paycheck didn't obey my
[1:01:21] confession right away me
[1:01:36] i look like i was yes from the streets
[1:01:40] and people might have said oh eli is
[1:01:43] just the same if he said
[1:01:47] but something happened within me but
[1:01:50] you and me and i began to confess and my
[1:01:53] body needed to catch up to my confession
[1:02:01] i'll tell you right now
[1:02:03] i still struggled with things
[1:02:06] i still struggled with with certain
[1:02:09] things while i was giving out my
[1:02:10] confession
[1:02:15] but i knew something supernatural
[1:02:17] happened in my life
[1:02:21] something supernatural can happen in
[1:02:23] your life
[1:02:25] and nobody could take that away from you
[1:02:29] well brother you still have the sickness
[1:02:44] but they just haven't caught up to your
[1:02:46] confession
[1:03:10] when god tells you you're healed try to
[1:03:13] take it away from you you cannot take it
[1:03:15] away
[1:03:20] it doesn't matter no important what your
[1:03:22] body tells you
[1:03:25] it doesn't matter what the outside
[1:03:27] sources tell you no important
[1:03:31] you are saying what the lord jesus
[1:03:33] christ says
[1:03:38] the bible says that he is a high priest
[1:03:40] of our confession this is
[1:04:00] wherever you was you accepted it and
[1:04:01] began to confess and people and tell
[1:04:04] people you were saved
[1:04:24] you kept with your confession and after
[1:04:26] a while it worked righteousness
[1:04:31] confession
[1:04:34] all your neighbors and everybody knows
[1:04:36] you're saved because you believed it and
[1:04:38] confessed it
[1:04:48] he's the high priest of our confessions
[1:04:54] at the right hand of the father making
[1:04:56] good what
[1:04:57] what your confession what you're
[1:04:59] confessing
[1:05:04] that's the same thing with healing
[1:05:05] that's the same thing with everything
[1:05:07] you renounce your feelings
[1:05:14] david says
[1:05:15] in psalms 1 16 10.
[1:05:21] i believe therefore i have spoken
[1:05:27] confessing isn't just telling people how
[1:05:29] you feel el confess
[1:05:32] or telling what what you believe
[1:05:37] but it's something that you send forth
[1:05:41] you release something
[1:05:44] we we believe
[1:05:46] in our heart
[1:05:48] we confess
[1:06:00] that's uh truly amazing for me is
[1:06:04] you know when david was there in front
[1:06:06] of goliath
[1:06:09] when he saw him blaspheming all those uh
[1:06:12] israelites
[1:06:16] and everybody was scared
[1:06:18] everybody didn't know what to do
[1:06:22] david says how do you let this
[1:06:24] uncircumcised philistine blaspheme the
[1:06:27] lord
[1:06:46] but
[1:06:47] david began to say what the lord said
[1:06:49] and did in his life
[1:06:55] he said i don't need any of what you
[1:06:57] have for me el dij
[1:07:00] he said there was one time a lion came
[1:07:02] and took away my sheep
[1:07:08] and i grabbed it and i took it out of
[1:07:10] his mouth and i slayed it
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:23] when he faced that giant in his life
[1:07:30] that he began to declare his victory
[1:07:32] before the battle even started
[1:07:37] that sounds backwards to me
[1:07:41] i usually tell people my victory after
[1:07:43] the battle is done
[1:07:48] how was it when you went through this
[1:07:52] oh by god's grace
[1:07:55] but maybe we should do what david does
[1:08:00] david look straight at that philistine
[1:08:02] david miro directamenta que el filistero
[1:08:05] and he said you come with me with the
[1:08:06] sword
[1:08:17] but i come to you in the name of the
[1:08:19] lord of the host of the armies of god of
[1:08:21] israel
[1:08:35] and i will kill you and cut your head
[1:08:37] off
[1:08:40] and i will give the dead bodies of the
[1:08:42] philistines to the birds and the wild
[1:08:44] animals
[1:08:49] and the whole world will know that there
[1:08:51] is a god in israel
[1:08:56] and everyone assembled here will know
[1:08:58] that the lord rescues his people
[1:09:08] this is the lord's battle and he will
[1:09:11] give you to us
[1:09:15] can you say that to your sickness today
[1:09:18] declaration
[1:09:32] i'm going to stand on your dead body
[1:09:36] i'm going to be victorious over this yo
[1:09:38] victoria
[1:09:39] i don't care how much this sickness
[1:09:42] rides over me
[1:09:46] i'm going
[1:10:14] confess
[1:10:56] for what you're going to speak por lo
[1:10:58] custeva
[1:11:00] did you know that
[1:11:02] they're waiting for your confession
[1:11:08] do what david did again okay is
[1:11:23] you're gonna you're gonna die in your
[1:11:25] sins
[1:11:27] that's what the devil wants to say
[1:11:30] oh you're not gonna overcome the
[1:11:32] sickness
[1:11:34] oh your children aren't gonna come back
[1:11:36] to the lord
[1:11:39] that's the
[1:11:40] giant the uncircumcised philistines
[1:11:46] you know what david did
[1:11:49] he went back to his testimony
[1:11:53] he went back to what god did for him
[1:11:55] before
[1:11:59] sometimes you got to go back
[1:12:02] and say if god could heal me then it is
[1:12:20] you take them with those testimonies
[1:12:24] you take them with the word us
[1:12:28] and say what god says
[1:12:31] now now this is a simple message all
[1:12:33] right
[1:12:42] brother daniel said something tremendous
[1:12:44] at the end of his testimony
[1:12:48] tremendous
[1:12:59] we are coming to a climax of times
[1:13:28] the bride is getting herself ready
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:47] the third poll has been from genesis to
[1:13:50] revelations
[1:13:53] it's not something new that the prophet
[1:13:56] showed us
[1:13:59] he just revealed what has been hidden in
[1:14:01] the scriptures the whole time
[1:14:06] when you confess
[1:14:08] you confess your salvation
[1:14:12] your body has to
[1:14:37] the bible says we were made in the
[1:14:39] likeness and in the image of
[1:14:49] what did he do
[1:14:51] the bible says in psalms 33 la bibla in
[1:14:54] salmon
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:07] he gathered the waters and the sea
[1:15:09] together as a heap el junto como monton
[1:15:12] las aguas del mar and he lay at the
[1:15:14] depth in storehouses
[1:15:18] let all the earth fear the lord
[1:15:22] let all the inhabitants of the world
[1:15:24] stand in all of him
[1:15:29] for he spake
[1:15:31] and it was done
[1:15:35] he commanded
[1:15:49] we were made in the image of
[1:16:04] that began
[1:16:19] us to understand
[1:16:21] what we talk about
[1:16:24] what do we say in our everyday lives
[1:16:28] what do we talk about when we talk about
[1:16:30] ourselves
[1:16:45] and the spirit went above the waters and
[1:16:48] begin to create beautiful things
[1:16:55] that's what happened when he spoke
[1:16:59] john 6
[1:17:00] 63 it says and juan says
[1:17:04] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:17:06] flesh profiteth nothing
[1:17:08] the words that i speak unto you
[1:17:10] they are spirit and they are life
[1:17:28] that's why we we hold on to his word
[1:17:33] there's a book that has stood on the
[1:17:36] test of time
[1:17:40] no other book has stood like this book
[1:17:42] has no iotro libro que se libro no other
[1:17:46] words have been heard from all across
[1:17:49] the world like this book has ningunas
[1:17:55] you cannot update it you cannot change
[1:17:57] it you cannot do anything but keep it
[1:17:59] the way it is
[1:18:04] because when god speaks
[1:18:09] when god speaks it's intentionally
[1:18:13] intention now forgive me but this is a
[1:18:16] saying that we say
[1:18:19] when somebody talks too much and talks
[1:18:21] reckless
[1:18:38] i hurt people's feelings and i don't
[1:18:39] mean to la
[1:18:40] sentiment
[1:18:43] i i say things that i'm not supposed to
[1:18:45] digo
[1:18:47] and we don't even know we do it
[1:18:51] but god what's amazing about god
[1:18:54] the bible says that he thought for
[1:18:56] eternity
[1:18:59] and when beginning started
[1:19:03] was when he spoke
[1:19:06] but he thought before he spoke
[1:19:10] and he didn't only think for a little
[1:19:11] bit of time but he thought for eternity
[1:19:17] because he knew how powerful his words
[1:19:19] were
[1:19:35] what does the bible say
[1:19:37] it says
[1:19:39] quick to hear
[1:19:42] slow to speak
[1:19:45] and slow anger
[1:19:47] sometimes we just gotta think before we
[1:19:49] say something
[1:19:52] we just gotta do what god did
[1:19:57] he thought before he spoke
[1:20:00] because he doesn't say anything he wants
[1:20:02] to say or he doesn't say anything he
[1:20:04] doesn't want to say por que el di
[1:20:08] everything's intentional
[1:20:11] isaiah 55 10 it says
[1:20:15] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:20:18] from heaven and returneth not thither
[1:20:20] but watereth the earth and maketh forth
[1:20:24] a bud and it may give seed to the sower
[1:20:27] and bread to the eater porque como de
[1:20:30] siendo de los
[1:20:42] be that go without forth out of my mouth
[1:20:46] and it shall not return unto me void but
[1:20:49] it shall accomplish that which i please
[1:20:52] and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:20:54] whereto i sent it
[1:21:12] void
[1:21:14] it doesn't come back empty no
[1:21:17] but it will accomplish
[1:21:19] that which he sent it for bro
[1:21:25] not only that
[1:21:31] and he expects something in return
[1:21:36] he
[1:21:37] expects progress or or
[1:21:40] or something to happen
[1:21:46] when he speaks
[1:21:48] it's a creative messenger what the word
[1:21:51] is
[1:21:54] it's a creative messenger
[1:21:57] the bible says that the word is a sword
[1:22:03] what we use a sword for parallel
[1:22:07] we try to accomplish a goal with the
[1:22:09] sword
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] the word is bread
[1:22:19] the bread is to accomplish something
[1:22:22] especially
[1:23:04] so that we can eat it
[1:23:08] the sword is a tool so that we can use
[1:23:10] it
[1:23:13] the seed is made to be planted and so
[1:23:15] that it can produce
[1:23:23] when he speaks it has to accomplish
[1:23:26] something
[1:23:29] now if i could just
[1:23:31] sit here for a few few minutes before we
[1:23:34] stop
[1:23:38] when god thought in his mind
[1:23:42] did he think words
[1:23:44] that's a funny question right
[1:24:13] i was there in the behind his mind
[1:24:17] but i wasn't there in words
[1:24:21] i was there the bible says where were
[1:24:23] you jobs
[1:24:27] when the sons of god were shouting for
[1:24:29] joy
[1:24:32] letters and words cannot shout for joy
[1:24:37] they were images
[1:24:41] in the backside of his mind
[1:24:45] so when god thought of us
[1:24:48] he thought of images he started people
[1:24:51] he thought of what he wanted
[1:24:55] but when he expressed it
[1:24:59] it was words
[1:25:02] and the words are not to be void
[1:25:06] because they're not the end products
[1:25:10] the words
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:24] but when he thought of adam and eve
[1:25:28] and how they were going to be
[1:25:31] and how they were going to be uh
[1:25:34] kings and queens over the earth
[1:25:47] sand and he took dirt and he took the
[1:25:49] elements of the earth
[1:25:57] and his word did not come to him void
[1:25:59] but it accomplished what he wanted it to
[1:26:02] accomplish
[1:26:06] it manifested what is what
[1:26:09] what was in his mind manifesto
[1:26:12] amen amen
[1:26:14] they are spirit and in life
[1:26:19] so what are we thinking in our minds
[1:26:20] mind
[1:26:24] what are we thinking in our mind
[1:26:27] is there evil or is there good malicious
[1:26:30] because when we speak
[1:26:33] it's what comes out of the mind it comes
[1:26:35] out of the heart
[1:26:39] and it's going to produce it cannot
[1:26:41] return to it
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:44] brother branham says
[1:26:47] that our words are go out into the
[1:26:49] airwaves
[1:26:55] and he said that it's like a leaf
[1:26:57] falling on the on the water
[1:27:02] that leaf will make a ripple
[1:27:08] and
[1:27:10] even though you don't see that ripple or
[1:27:13] that wave anymore
[1:27:16] it continues and continues and continues
[1:27:21] until it hits the shores
[1:27:24] brother branham says that our voice will
[1:27:27] be played back in the day of judgment
[1:27:29] this is
[1:27:43] and one day it's going to hit that shore
[1:27:45] of the judgment bar um
[1:27:49] and then it's going to
[1:27:51] show what we have been saying
[1:27:55] what our confession is
[1:27:57] whether it's good or it's bad
[1:28:00] what have we been saying about ourselves
[1:28:04] what have we been saying about others
[1:28:07] what have we been saying to our families
[1:28:11] what have we been confessing about
[1:28:13] christ
[1:28:15] what have we been confessing about our
[1:28:18] salvation and our beliefs
[1:28:22] it's going to come back
[1:28:25] the bible says in proverbs 18 21.
[1:28:31] death
[1:28:32] and life are at the power or in the
[1:28:35] power of the tongue la muerte la vida
[1:28:37] estan en poder de la lengua wow that's
[1:28:40] heavy
[1:28:43] death and life are in the power of the
[1:28:45] tongue
[1:28:48] brother branham says
[1:28:50] in
[1:28:51] the except um in the message accept
[1:28:53] god's gift from
[1:29:10] you go right back straight into the same
[1:29:13] rut that you was in the beginning
[1:29:18] there's not a man or a woman in here
[1:29:21] that is baptized with the holy spirit
[1:29:23] but
[1:29:24] what would start your confession
[1:29:32] i believe i've lost the holy spirit
[1:30:03] amen amen
[1:30:04] jesus is the high priest of our
[1:30:06] confession is that right jesus christ
[1:30:11] now in hebrews 3 1 now any scholar knows
[1:30:14] that the same word profession is
[1:30:15] confession to the same translation
[1:30:17] translated
[1:30:26] now sitting at the right hand of the
[1:30:28] father to make intercessions upon what
[1:30:30] our confession he can't do nothing until
[1:30:33] first you confess it it's done
[1:30:36] alright
[1:30:59] his name is jesus christ
[1:31:02] the bible says that my words are spirit
[1:31:05] and life
[1:31:08] and jesus is waiting for you to speak
[1:31:11] jesus
[1:31:13] his spirit is waiting for you to speak
[1:31:16] el spirit
[1:31:18] because when you speak and you confess
[1:31:20] god's word
[1:31:24] there is an agent or a high priest there
[1:31:27] to make intercessions for your
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:41] so life is there waiting jesus christ
[1:31:43] waiting for you to make a good
[1:31:45] confession
[1:31:48] he's waiting for you to confess his word
[1:31:53] not confess on how you feel but confess
[1:31:56] what he already
[1:32:23] your body will begin to change your life
[1:32:26] will begin to change
[1:32:30] your situation will begin to change
[1:32:34] but the bible says to lay a hold of your
[1:32:37] confession
[1:32:50] but continue to confess what you need to
[1:32:52] confess on the lord
[1:32:56] and leo hold on to that confession
[1:33:01] to that word that you believe
[1:33:04] and say lord i believe
[1:33:19] god has to fulfill
[1:33:48] but just as much as
[1:33:50] the holy spirit is waiting
[1:33:55] death is waiting also
[1:33:58] death and life are at the power of the
[1:34:00] tongue
[1:34:04] and there's devils waiting for you to
[1:34:06] speak bad about another person
[1:34:10] there's devils waiting to say i'm not
[1:34:13] i'm not saved anymore yo i i diagnosed
[1:34:30] i don't think i'm saved anymore because
[1:34:32] i did this
[1:34:35] be careful what you say
[1:34:38] because there's a spirit in life behind
[1:34:40] your words
[1:34:44] the bible says that your tongue or your
[1:34:46] mouth is a door
[1:34:50] and they're waiting there at the door
[1:34:52] waiting to be dispatched
[1:34:56] because we know that the devil cannot
[1:34:58] enter into
[1:35:25] so he uses
[1:35:27] god's children's words to create
[1:35:33] because he knows that a child of god can
[1:35:36] create and can produce
[1:35:54] it'll create a life of depression
[1:35:58] it'll create a life that does not know
[1:36:01] if they're saved or not anymore
[1:36:07] you remember the time when brother
[1:36:09] branham had this uh a prayer line
[1:36:15] and they had a videos
[1:36:17] videos and there was this woman that
[1:36:19] came up to her or her those one that
[1:36:22] came up to brother branham while in case
[1:36:24] i said
[1:36:25] branham
[1:36:26] and he began to discern her
[1:36:30] and when she was about to leave
[1:36:34] he said hold on wait el dij
[1:36:38] he said i see a dark shadow over you
[1:36:43] a black hood
[1:36:46] negra he said
[1:36:48] oh it was a lie somebody told on you
[1:36:50] yelling
[1:37:04] he said it was your pastor he's he's
[1:37:07] saying that you're a witch
[1:37:11] right
[1:37:13] it was the words that they spoke to her
[1:37:16] foreign
[1:37:18] and because of that she was hooded with
[1:37:20] something attached to her life
[1:37:27] that was tormenting her okay
[1:37:30] because somebody spoke evil on her album
[1:37:35] what are we speaking about each other
[1:37:39] the bible says god's a tongue of gossip
[1:37:41] it's like wildfire they say la villa que
[1:37:43] la lengua
[1:37:47] all is
[1:37:48] i'm just saying what i feel led to say
[1:37:50] you know
[1:37:52] the scene but when we talk about what
[1:37:54] are we saying to our families
[1:37:58] what are we saying about our own life
[1:38:08] what are we saying about our brother our
[1:38:09] sister our neighbors
[1:38:13] what are we saying about our situation
[1:39:09] it was going to produce whatever that
[1:39:11] seed was produced
[1:39:14] and in the end
[1:39:16] is the third pool
[1:39:19] which is the same thing as the beginning
[1:39:23] the spoken word is
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:34] we're waiting for those things to happen
[1:39:35] but yet we curse our brother and our
[1:39:37] sisters
[1:40:06] is it's the law of confession
[1:40:12] we cannot say
[1:40:13] speak and be amazed because it happened
[1:40:20] because that's the way the bible made it
[1:40:22] that's the way god made it
[1:40:26] amen amen
[1:40:29] now i just want to talk about job just a
[1:40:31] little bit before we close
[1:40:36] he was afraid that his children were
[1:40:38] going to sin
[1:40:42] and he told the lord
[1:40:44] he said i want to sacrifice just in case
[1:40:48] they sin elijah
[1:40:52] and the bible says
[1:40:54] that what he feared
[1:40:58] what he feared the most came upon him
[1:41:17] fear doesn't mean you don't have faith
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:22] it means that you believe the lie more
[1:41:24] than you believe the truth
[1:41:28] and you believe in that that's going to
[1:41:30] happen more than what the word says
[1:41:35] and when you begin to speak your fears
[1:41:40] then that's your greatest fears are
[1:41:42] what's going to come upon you
[1:41:53] do you believe that adam do you think he
[1:41:55] spoke anything he wanted to speak before
[1:41:57] the fall uh
[1:42:12] was intentional with the speaking
[1:42:14] advance
[1:42:17] because he knew if he told the wind to
[1:42:19] stop it
[1:42:24] when he would say something it would
[1:42:26] have to happen
[1:42:29] and that's the same thing with us
[1:42:33] begin to speak life into your lives us
[1:42:38] big blessings in your life
[1:43:06] maybe everybody told abraham abraham
[1:43:09] you're too old man
[1:43:12] hey you're too old to do this
[1:43:16] sarah she's her woman is dead already
[1:43:19] too old
[1:43:21] yesterday
[1:43:35] but god told me i was going to have a
[1:43:38] promised child
[1:43:41] god told me i was going to be this
[1:43:45] god told me i was saved
[1:43:48] the bible says let the weak say i'm
[1:43:50] strong
[1:44:31] speak into this uh speak to the and it
[1:44:34] will happen
[1:44:38] he spoke and it happened
[1:44:41] that's the same thing we're going
[1:44:42] through today
[1:44:45] you speak your own salvation into
[1:44:47] existence
[1:44:49] in existence you believe in your heart
[1:44:51] unto righteousness
[1:44:55] and you confess unto salvation you say
[1:44:58] allah salvation we gotta get ready
[1:45:02] the times are almost there
[1:45:06] it's already here
[1:45:08] and what we gotta do is begin to speak
[1:45:11] he look positive
[1:45:14] have
[1:45:57] or the bible says that he'll have a
[1:45:59] sword in his mouth
[1:46:03] that was the same sword brother branham
[1:46:05] was holding
[1:46:06] us
[1:46:08] he grabbed that sword and he said this
[1:46:10] is the third pool
[1:46:14] and when jesus came down
[1:46:17] he had that same
[1:46:19] sword in his mouth
[1:46:22] what was it the spoken word
[1:46:26] everything is the spoken word the whole
[1:46:28] bible is the word
[1:46:32] jesus said you say in my name it's and
[1:46:35] it shall happen
[1:46:38] he said speak
[1:46:52] how
[1:47:20] let's be careful what we say about our
[1:47:22] brothers and our sisters
[1:47:26] brother branham says that we can kill
[1:47:28] somebody's influence by what we say
[1:47:30] about them
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:35] but what if we start
[1:47:36] speaking good things about them
[1:47:41] what how what would happen if we begin
[1:47:43] to pray for them
[1:47:47] those people that are only hanging by
[1:48:15] because that is the word of the lord
[1:48:19] once you begin to speak in the authority
[1:48:21] of jesus name
