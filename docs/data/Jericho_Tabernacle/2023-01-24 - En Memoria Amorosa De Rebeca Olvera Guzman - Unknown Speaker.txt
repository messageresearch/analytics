[Applause] Christo is Hermanos is better Los Angeles foreign Magica Commission ER Nueva because Hermanos a mother scientifically Alma images Remos hermana foreign first of all would like to Center condolences to the the Guzman family [Music] for myself my family and on behalf of here the members of here of Jericho Tabernacles I believe for the flesh it's a it's a very um sad and nervous time but I I believe for the for the believer it's a very joyful time especially for those who knew sister Rebecca is and I believe anybody knew sister Rebecca was her very own family if anybody knew her was her children who was her was her daughters-in-law their her grandchildren they were the ones who really knew who sister Rebecca Guzman was hey yes we were so privileged to be able to know her to get to meet her and to know how God works with anybody he wants to work with and I was looking at her had her name is Rebecca Olvera Guzman is and I like to really look at their names and their definitions and what their what what they meant his brother Brandon says those those names give a certain influence to the person is so the definition of the name Rebecca definition or the meaning it's to tie or to bind is uh the meaning Olvera is Olive or Olive Tree and the meaning of Guzman El certificate is a descendant of a good man is so sister Rebecca she was tied yeah foreign brother Branham says that is a type of the Holy ghosts you grab an olive and you just squeeze the ingredients out of it that's olive oil and that was Sister Rebecca Guzman yes she was an olive tree to her family she was a pillar to her family she was olive oil and she was Guzman a descendant of a good man the sentence of her a good father or a good grandfather this is but we know as we were born again says we have a new father and that is Jesus Christ so she is a descendant of a good man don't say yes noble man so you notice every name has a meaning significado she binded her family to the Olive Tree Jesus Christ and the descendant of a good man Jesus Christ I'd like to thank brother art for giving me the time to speak in her family so familiar in these difficult times I was talking to Brother Art I said Brother Art how did your mom knew the message how did she come across this beautiful message you know brother art he's a descendant like me from Texas and they were farmers who go into different places to pick out the farm the the the the fruit or the Farmland yeah in this moment in their life they were located in Michigan and sister Rebecca she was a Pentecostal woman amen now brother we know what brother Ram says about Pentecostals and she knew how to read her Bible every time she'll get home she'll read her Bible and then she ran into a scripture of Malachi 4 5. and she says behold I send you Elijah the prophet he said and she says there's a prophet that's coming now I want you to notice on a side note nobody told her of William Miriam Branham Michigan at this time and she's reading her Bible like a good Christian woman and she says there's a prophet that's coming it is we gotta start getting ready because the Prophet Elijah is coming and what she did nobody told her what she had to do she began to pray and she began to fast for weeks began to pray and begin to fast ready to receive this Prophet that was coming that was foretold by the scriptures and then she comes to her across the family and I believe brother family and they told her so she said to them we're waiting for a prophet is because the scripture says there's a prophet that's coming and we're waiting for him to come back she didn't receive it from second hand she didn't receive it from anybody else she received it straight from God himself she was tied to the word of God she was a tree to treat her family from the message nobody told her well if there's a prophet neither convince her that there's a prophet no God revealed himself to her and then we see the fruits of it we see that he she gave birth to a very good young man tremendous man I wish we could have ten of him hundreds of him he's everywhere who instructed her children in the right way taught him how to dress right how to shake their hand the brother's hands right the reason I say that I'm gonna say this it might sound a bit funny but I'm not trying to be funny I was uh I have this little little relationship a little man-to-man relationship with robertito uh and we have this thing where we just shake each other's hands and sometimes would be funny we just kind of shake a little hard and we we move our arms like this yeah this is I encouraged it foreign yeah she still came to church she never got a ride from no one right she always drove herself here three times when she'll be parking all the way in the back there was no room there here in the front yeah so she'll Park all the way in the back and our little golf cart wasn't working she'll walk all the way over there and she never complained she never fought for a parking spot she just wanted to get here to church her eyes were on the Lord Jesus Christ and we're so thankful that we got to know and and have amongst us a sister that's so tremendous little things like that they make they give us an example that it's not about parking spots it's not about dressing well fancy serving Jesus Christ so we thank God for her and for her giving through her tremendous children and grandchildren we thank the family once again we thank Brother Art and sister Sharon guzmann this is her daughters condolences it could be kind of hard at times like this is but as she was departing she didn't want to turn back this is what she fought foreign foreign God bless you um on wanting to say just get them down get them down otherwise he's not going to let me say anything the only thing that I can tell you is that first of all before I forget is I want to give condolences unto the family I want to thank them for allowing me to share some words and I want to thank the brothers that have helped us out foreign we were called from eternity God didn't call us to come in any other age he called us to come in this age to be manifested and to fulfill our purpose after we finish our purpose return back home I know it's not easy to lose a loved one my father passed it wasn't easy there's the Assurance within me I don't serve a dead God I just I serve a living God I came from eternity you came from eternity and that eternity is eternal life and once again though I leave this earth because I know I'll return okay I know I've got life one day we'll find ourselves with all our loved ones what you've got to be sure that when God finds himself with you in your journey you can accept him because he died to save us to redeem us to give us eternal life and it was free it's free I didn't do anything I didn't deserve anything English no English no Spanish the only perfect one is God yes and he's the one that lives in US and I married her and so I'm a winner but sister Rebecca did the best that she could she lived the life and it was time for her to go home that time will come unto every one of us but you've got to be sure that's why I don't cry when my father I didn't cry for King why what can you say because that my redeemer liveth and I won't go back because in my dead father's end he was the worst he drank he smoked and he was just the worst when I started to go to church he told me don't talk to me because I'm going to keep being a drunk God gave him the opportunity to serve the Lord he gave him the best he could he fulfilled with what he did and he left and I'm not sad okay because I know I'll see him again I know I see your sister Rebecca once again why okay because we were purchased by the same the same Redeemer and we have the same life of that Giver of the life forgive me I I didn't have too many words I just said what I said I'm going to say everything that was said it's true [Music] since they already saw the plate for me all that I can tell you is when you pass be sure that you've got okay and that you know that God remember one thing though you leave you will come back for we come from eternity we go back into eternity and we will live forever God bless you please stand uh to rest a little bit [Music] long kind of room for a country God made words [Music] sad goodbye we'll let me forget foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh please find me [Applause] [Music] this is [Music] foreign [Music] take us down [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] our Glory [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] one moment brother okay Familia [Music] Arizona when our family we left here from Arizona and we moved on to the City of Arlington Texas naturally which is in Texas she was one of those that opened her home but uh to allow us to be in her house she opened up her home to have Services there she was just an extraordinary woman brother a it was a pleasure to be able to know her when her husband we knew him as Don Benito is she called me in the evening and I went to the hospital and when she was waiting to hear about her husband when the doctor came out and he gave us the news had passed away she took maybe a minute or two without saying anything she was in silence then she stood up she said so what is it that I must do now what papers do I have to sign what's the process to continue on naturally the news impacted her but it took two dos minutos two minutes and then she reacted what do I need to do to continue forward those are things you just can't Forget Brothers I'm going to ask if you please stand for a moment and I want to read a portion of the Bible we find it in Job chapter 2 Job chapter 2 verse Ecclesiastes forgive me it's Ecclesiastes chapter three we're going to read verse one and two they say s yellow to everything there is a season and every purpose under him and the time to every purpose under Heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plantado and a time to pluck up that which is planted let us pray we thank you for the life you permitted our sister and for every person today that has shared their presence to honor this woman Lord we ask that you help us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen brothers please take your seats we know that in the Bible Brothers he went through a very difficult situation but he had two friends they came to see their friend Joe yeah and they saw that he was in a difficult situation Dos Amigos these two friends they sat next to Joe for seven days without speaking with the sole presence of these friends I hope they were telling Joe estamos Contigo we're with you this morning everyone that's present here he says we might not be able to say much but just with the presence of you being here is that we're with them amen amen the Bible speaks to us in the scripture that we just read there's the time for all things there's a time to be born she had her time October 20th Centos 1945. IE there's also a Time To Die the 9th of January of 2023. God was good with her he extended unto her all these years of life but the scripture certainly fulfills itself there's a time where we also must die in this trajectory of life is it's God's hand Works through all things Brothers God does things in silence but in that is God's hand for example for example God can bring the two of the morning that can bring much more water then those great rainfalls it is silent that's the way that God operates we want to determine our time here on Earth we find ourselves sane on occasions I want to die nonetheless God is the one that has the last word about that is God the one that determines when we're going to go for that I want to read the book of Job chapter 14. and I want to read to you the first six verses it says Corto de dias in sabores man that is born of a woman is few of days and full of trouble yes cortado he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he flareth also as a shadow and continueth not is Contigo and thus thou open Thine Eyes Upon such as one and bring us me into judgmento love you who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one I want to focus on number five seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot passer turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as in hiring his day it's a very tremendous scripture to the Guzman family I want to comment to you that this same scripture God gave it to me when we made the when we had the funeral for Don Benito that was her husband but the Bible speaks to us and Compares us as a flower that it comes out one day and we see the beauty of the flower is that is our youth and the youth is certainly beautiful but we don't stay young forever nor does the floor stay radiant forever it also grows old every time I look in the mirror I see myself just a little older but this is but it's like the shadow that it flees on occasions were seated they're in the shade but as the day passes that shadow starts to go away from us and there's no way that you can keep that shadow the rotation of the earth needs to pass you can't withhold the shadow in the same manner we cannot withhold life forever the shadow leaves but there is a new day brothers that the sun comes up again and the day starts over again that's the hope of all Christians The Book of Job it's one of the oldest books of the Bible but since back then a hope job he would ask himself the questions will he live again sure he will Campo it's like the flowers of the field Primavera they come out in the spring they get a little older Proxima Primavera but then next spring they come out again we just wait that next spring because we'll be young again Brethren amen amen that's how I'm going to look we see that she was a beautiful woman and that's how we will see her again because brother Brandon in his simple way of just bringing the message it tells us like the tree approxima when he knows that the winter is approaching the life of that tree okay which is that that's that's Salvia the sap it goes down onto the roots because there's a wisdom that says that the winter is drying clothes naturally it had a spring like all of us and then the summer approaches when things get a little hot pero but during that time the tree gives forth fruit is Rebecca and in the case of our sister Rebecca she also brought forth fruit then the Autumn comes when the trees let down all of their leaves when the hair starts to fall off until the winter comes and you might say well shall we cut the tree down because it's dead surely we should not it's just sleeping we just need to wait the next spring yes and that tree will be dressed once again and we'll bring forth new leaves heels in sufurmas and sigreser God in his simple way of being a resurrection he speaks to us of a death and of a resurrection because he died for us foreign usually we just ask ourselves the question what happens with us during this time period of death elements naturally the body being made of the elements of this Earth it also goes back onto the Earth that's why it says that dust shall turn back into dust our 16 elements that compose this body Etc they're calcium and sulfur and all those things all those things go back into the dust of the Earth when Jesus was about to be crucified he said father enters in thy hands I commend my spirit I place my spirit it's the spirit okay so then this Spirit that's within us it goes someplace unto God because that's what Jesus did I place my spirit in thy hands but our soul goes to a specific place a place separate from God there's no old men there's a body no somos un Espirito we're not a spirit we're not floating out in the in the clouds there's a body separate from God for if this body will be destroyed we've got another prepared from God that one is in this body that no longer has any pain how tremendous it no longer feels any shyness there's just Joy there's this joy and happiness there was someone behind this curtain a prophet that said I saw young people in the prime of their youths with all their teeth there they won't take out all of our molars getting them in there how tremendous it's a place there with God it's not our home we've got a home yes that home is here on the earth it's a place that we're waiting case Perfection that is perfection everything is it's it's happiness because that's the hope of every Christian she is in that place I can Only Imagine the encounter with all those that have already passed just think for a moments we've got loved ones on the other side she's got a son and what she's already reunited wow wow that she can hug him contemplarla it's in contemplating and to know that he's there siertamente surely Ernesto Ernesto has a question how are my brothers we want to know about our family how are my brothers and sisters how'd you leave them everyone will respond for that see but when the Resurrection comes primeros this is the first sedan es the last shall be first the god in his great wisdom the last that have gone they'll rise up first and then we'll see them and no longer have the question did they make it in the rapture is that question will be answered we'll see them we know that we'll be together God's family once again reunited to be taken up all together no longer with the questions is my mother there is my brother there yeah we'll have the answer that great Gathering that she's having partido all of our Brethren that have gone uh passed away they are there I want to read first Thessalonians verse 13 and 14. Hermanos foreign but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that is sorrow not even as others which have no hope Jesus Ito for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in Jesus will God bring with him there are people that die without Christ without any hope for we is naturally we do get sad but not as those that they don't have any hope because if we believe that Jesus Christ he died and resurrected then we also believe he'll bring with him all those that sleep is that's what we believe in our sister Rebecca one day not too far they will see her again Bueno Perla photos it'll be very wonderful to see the picture to be able to recognize her yeah she'll be young once again she is young when people say well we'll be younger will we be old no if God already made us Young when he brings us he won't bring us back elderly still bring us back young it does then let's look at her pictures when we see her we can recognize it's a pleasure again to have you in our midst and that together we'll go together in a Rapture because that's what awaits us these are just my brief words it's the time that was given unto me I believe we've got a great hope on God's behalf that all those that are dead they'll hear the voice of God and they'll rise up once again we'll let forth its leaves once again when the tree loses its leaves and it rises in the spring it's not searching for the old leaves but simply it'll give forth newly yes that's what we're waiting will be dressed newly with eternal youth and who lived in her it's yes and if that spirit is in her it'll raise her up again amen amen let us pray brother we thank you this morning for the life you gave our sister Rebecca for the fruits of her womb Lord as we take her unto her rest Lord fulfilling the word that the dust shall return unto dust but surely she's no longer there but she's got a place set apart from God where those that sleep in him are at Senora Lord give us this Revelation yes and that full Revelation that full hope that we wait upon the Lord that when you return that place will be soon may God bless you may God be with you brother bless you richly and abundantly amen amen [Music] on the wings of a snow why don't the Gods in his views [Music] on the wings oh on the wings [Music] all the things go on the wings of a soul why why
