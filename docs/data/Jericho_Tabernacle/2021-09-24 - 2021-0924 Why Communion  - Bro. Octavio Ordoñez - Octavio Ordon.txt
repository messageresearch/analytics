going to be reading from john vamos de juan john chapter 6 verse 47 juan says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me has everlasting life your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the prayer which cometh from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat entonces then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you jesus who so eateth my flesh and drink of my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up in the last days for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinking my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father and he that eateth me even he shall live by me. this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things he said he in the synagogue as he taught them in capernaum we're going to speak a little bit on on the subject that brother brahan says is one of the most misunderstood uh topics there is in the in the bible and and i'd like to go over the plan for you [Music] since it will be our first time to have communion october 24th today is september 24th and the apostle paul is the one that set things in order in the new testament and he said in galatians 1 8. but the we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse hello so the apostle paul knew what he was talking about he said things in order in the new testament as moses said things in order in the old testament now this message that i'm going to be speaking i took it from the message communion [Music] you can go back to it it's a very short message it's actually the last message brother brian preached the choice he says now i do believe that communion what is called communion now is the lord's supper all right now we have we now we only have three physical divine orders left to us one of them is communion washing three things that the lord told us to do it's perfection is perfection there's only three orders we have [Music] no one should take communion if they're not prepared to take it that's why we want to do it 30 days from now foreign now the first thing is baptism brother braham said in another message that if you're not prepared he would stop you from taking communion he actually said he would stop him from taking communion or keep him from it's extremely important it's uh extremely important so first let's talk about baptism baptism you have to accept the lord jesus christ as your personal savior personally you have to accept that you were born in sin come in this world speaking lies us and there was a savior to keep you from going to hell you accept the lord jesus christ as your personal savior personally and because of that works that's gone in has happened within you [Music] you're dying to yourself and you want the lord jesus christ to be your new guy you're promising the lord that you'll serve him [Music] that's to serve the lord he wants people to serve them and the way he finds out if you love him if you want to serve him [Music] you'll constantly be on your knees asking the lord to help you you say constantly when someone comes before you and gives you a hard time [Music] front and told someone because pressure got really high and i gave him a hard time but i realized i was out of order apologize for them that doesn't make you fall okay now let's let's go into the more of the symbols and we have communion let's go into the actual uh process [Music] then once we have that process in mind we'll go into the what brother branham says about how important it is to be ready for it now communion you can trace it all the way back to melchizedek okay but we won't go there but what communion is the actual processor there's a there's a bread that is made there's a certain way that the bread is made i have a sister and i already talked to her you have le conair and i asked her to prepare the bread for us i asked her to take two or three sisters that are filled with the holy scholar and we want her to train our young ladies our young sisters when the bread is made and is kept out in the back yes either in the office or the fellowship hall oh company we also buy uh wine compramos vino and i asked the brother to take care of that yeah he's going to be buying the wine there's actually wine that is made for that [Music] and we also need to buy other products that we need to serve the wine with tamien now the people that actually uh hold the bread the ones that will be breaking the breath are our church elders church elders that are filled with the and then they come forward exactly how we're going to do it we have to go over with the elders well probably have a table here lomas probably we'll have the bread and we'll have two to four elders to be serving it and the men go to the fellowship halls to do the feet everyone brings their towel and the first person they see the person they wash their feet they pray over [Music] the persona as they're washing their feet allah and everyone gets to go home it will be on a sunday evening there'll be no fellowship then everybody goes home amen now who can take this uh communion all right who can who can do this anybody that comes and this is how important this is important okay let's get into the brother [Music] now when we talk now when we take this communion it isn't just the thing saying i'm coming up here and going to eat some bread i believe i'm a christian but if you notice the bible said he that eateth and drink it unworthily shall be guilty of the blood and the body of the lord see you've got to live a life that before the people that and before god and you've got to live a life that the people than before god and the people that shows that you are that you are sincere de pretension or engano a genuine feeling heartfelt del corazon now just a moment longer now i'm in the old testament when the sacrifice was made a statute or an ordinance and so is water baptism and ordinance so is feet washing an ordinance so is the lord's supper and ordinance blessed is he that does all of his ordinance keeps all of his statues and all of his commandments that he might have a right to enter into the tree of life amen now notice in this now that in that the first when it was first an ordinance of god to bring a sacrifice to the church and the temple and the altar and offer your gift and for your sins the sacrifice of a lamb when i can just imagine seeing some jewish brother coming down the road knowing that he was guilty and he goes to the altar or brings a his fat ox or a bullock or whatever he had or a ram a lamb something he had brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come he walked up there keeping god's ordinance just as sincere as he then he laid his hands upon it confessing his sins and the priests placing this his sins upon the lamb and the lamb's throat was cut and then he died for or whatever he had or a ram a lamb something he had brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come he walked up there keeping god's ordinance just as sincerely as he could hold finally over and over and when again and over and over kept going until finally it became a tradition finalemente [Music] this has to be done with sincerity the commandment of god became a tradition to the people and then here he come down well let's see this is so and so today maybe i better go yeah down the tradition is yeah i better offer a bullock he went down well lord here's my biloxi there's no sincerity in it there's no understanding has to be a revelation has to be an understanding you're saying for service you're safe to provide a service us service to help someone else to help but we always need help in the church siempre ocopamos now we find out today that this great thing that we're fixing to do tonight in the commemoration of his death and his body that we believe that we eat daily or just go through eating as our brother preached to us taking the word of god we believe it with all our hearts we see it manifested manifesto we see it giving to us we see it vindicated and we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we're doing not because it's an order either you don't take the lord's supper by tradition you take it because it's the love of god in your heart in keeping the commandments of god see that's what you take it foreign so if you don't take it sincerity just as a tradition well our church observes communion once every sunday or every month or twice a year or go up and say well it's my time and then take the communion why it's a stink to god see that's [Music] something that is not done just as another day come on let's skip to 54. then when we come to the lord's table we must come in reverence love and respect [Music] look where we would have been if it hadn't been for him the we come here thinking well if i hadn't known the lord where would i be you know i'm having communion and if you know brother let me go back here 55 there's paul i think in saying this wherefore when ye come together to eat tarry one for the other cinco por lo tanto pablo yo por other words just wait a few minutes if you know a brother is in there just about to do something wrong or something and you pray for him one the other wait just a minute pray if there's any feelings between you or something don't do it don't do it go make that right first see go straighten that up first because we want to come here just as pure as we can be in our thoughts of one another and to god and to each other and then we come in fellowship around the table of the lord condos except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you except you eat the flesh of the blood except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you el que no coma la carne how important is that see you see what's that's what the bible said except you do it there's no life in you you see this you are then showing you are then more or less showing you are ashamed to identify yourself as a christian because of the life that you live us [Music] then if you don't do it you have no life if you do it unworthily you are guilty of the body of the lord indignant then if you don't do it you have no life if you do it if you do do it unworthily you are guilty of the body of the lord that's the trouble of us today what i think i'm saying us me and the church that the lord god has sent me speak to in these last hours that we believe were in the closing time problem we must come to him with reverence and with love and with purity of heart mind and soul that's a that's pretty tough huh can you we have to do things right communion and feet washes isn't something lightly you really have to consider the life you live it can affect the rest of your life first corinthians 11 24. see what paul the apostle paul tells the corinthians about this question and we had given thanks he broke it and he said take heed this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took up he took the cup when he had soup saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this do ye ass up as you drink it in remembrance of me [Music] drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes is wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord your let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat it and drink it unworthily eat it and drinking damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleeps for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are shasta of the lord we that we should not be condemned with the world just castigator wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for the other que hermanos cuando ronis ami if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will be will will i set an order when i come success this is the last paragraph of brother branham communion uh 1965 1212. in mensah communion remember when israel taken the type of this they journeyed 40 years in the wilderness and their clothes never even wore out and they come out without one feeble one one among them with two million people as a type of this academy podesta well what will the anti-type do if the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them what would the body of jesus christ emanuel do for us [Music] let us just be reverent when we come let us be just as reverent as we know how to come us there's a little bit more here and i haven't seen it where brother brahim refers to this but i know we we used to read it and uh when we would take communion i'll read it to you and i'll explain it to you first samuel 21-1 remember i don't know everything then came david unto noah the himalay the priests and himalay was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why are thou alone and no man with thee. the priests the king hath commanded me a business and had said unto me let no man know anything of the business we're about i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such in such a place now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in my hand of what there is present amano and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under my hand but there is hollowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women alone and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth woman have been kept from us these three days since i came out and the vessels of the man young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yay though it were sanctified this day in the vessel [Music] so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away quantum [Music] how many remember the scripture recorded it's kind of hard to explain but in reality it's really simple is difficult you keep separate from your husband or your wife for three days before you have communion it makes sense okay just have a few more and and we'll be done i don't think this is on the slide this is just to to emphasize how important it is to be to be right with god yes i had several other scriptures or texts [Music] we realized that the scripture that we have read that if we eat and drink unworthily we're eating and drinking damnation to ourselves not discerning the lord's body that is if you're living in sin living where you're not when you should not live then you are a reproach to the cause of but you're living if but if you're living i know every one of us makes mistakes but we have a blood sacrifice laying there atoning for us constantly the blood of god's own son constantly but if you're living in open sin and not worthy to be called a christian don't take it but if you are a christian then you're duty-bound to take it for he that eats my flesh and drinks my [Music] amen now what's a type the the wine is a type and the bread is the type okay i hold in my hand a grape juice the blood of the grape that jesus said i will drink a new with you in my father's kingdom this represents the blood of jesus christ that our sins are forgiven gracious god as i hold in this my hand tonight the grapes the blood of the grapes that's to represent the blood of the son of god representatives as i ask you to bless it to every partaker may our sins be under the blood participate may our sickness vanish from us for we are your servants desiring strong healthy bodies and clean pure heart and conscience that we can be your representatives in this earth representative we pray thee our god to sanctify these grapes tonight the blood of these graves to its intended purpose in the name of jesus christ the scripture says that he took the cup and gave thanks then he took the bread and he broke it and said this is my body which is broken for you gracias it is as i hold in my hand tonight these little parcels of bread that that's all wrinkled up broke up it reminds me of the message tonight how they beat one tree to get the pope out to save the other sustain vienna and how he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and chastisement of our peace was upon him but with his stripes we were healed of may the grace of god sanctify this kosher bread to its intended purpose to every person that partakes of it no more sin in your life no more sickness in your body till we meet the lord so once again we're we're going to try the lord willing to have communion on the 24th of next month so we're going to try and have elections before then this italian superintendent as far as i understand all these departments need to be elected there's three things we have to have in order our personal lives that's what we talked about our church in our home life [Music] i usually don't tell anyone when i'm going to speak but bring your seat belts okay it's going to be kind of tough i'm really having a hard time with it but we need to get our lives in order okay would you
