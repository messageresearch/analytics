[31:57] puente mars
[32:00] my title this uh
[32:01] this evening is the importance of your
[32:04] bible
[32:06] importance
[32:07] it's a very uh simple title
[32:11] a very simple message
[32:14] the importance of your bible importance
[32:18] i believe that each and every person has
[32:20] one of these
[32:24] i believe each and every young person
[32:26] should have one of these
[32:30] this is something that is so important
[32:32] to a christian
[32:35] cristiano something that sometimes we
[32:38] don't know how important this thing is
[32:43] this is life to us
[32:47] this is the greatest thing that god has
[32:50] ever given us is his word
[32:55] the bible says that you
[32:58] shall not turn to the right hand or to
[33:00] the left
[33:04] but it will if you go and you follow it
[33:07] it will prosper wherever you go
[33:13] so we know the story of joshua
[33:17] josue joshua was in the border of the
[33:20] promised land josue estaba from
[33:24] and god
[33:25] began to commission joshua
[33:29] josue and when he began to commission
[33:31] him he said this is the most important
[33:33] thing
[33:37] he said if you want to prosper in
[33:39] everything that you do because
[33:42] if you want to defeat every enemy
[33:46] if you want to be successful in your
[33:49] life
[34:04] now we have the whole bible and a
[34:07] messenger that revealed it to us
[34:12] and if we want to prosper in our life
[34:16] young people if you want to prosper in
[34:18] school jobenes
[34:20] lascuela if you guys want to prosper in
[34:22] your job
[34:24] if you want to be prosperous as a
[34:26] christian
[34:27] cristianos don't turn from your left or
[34:30] to your right no stay with the world
[34:47] [Music]
[34:50] so wherever you go that word will
[34:52] illuminate your pathway
[34:58] there's a
[34:59] question that once a person asked
[35:01] brother branham
[35:05] in question and answers preached in
[35:06] 1964.
[35:12] he asked the question he said how can a
[35:15] christian get deeper in love with god
[35:22] i think each and every christian
[35:24] has that question and has that desire
[35:26] christian
[35:29] how do i get deeper in love with god
[35:33] brother branham said such a simple quote
[35:38] he said read the word and pray because
[35:51] read that word
[35:54] and you get closer and closer to the
[35:56] lord
[35:59] and reading the word and praying
[36:03] are both types of communication
[36:07] we speak to him when we pray hablamos
[36:10] and he speaks to us when we read
[36:14] we're having a communication with the
[36:16] lord
[36:17] communication
[36:18] we're getting a deeper relationship with
[36:21] the lord
[36:24] you you progress your relationship with
[36:27] him by doing these two
[36:30] relations
[36:32] you enter into another level
[36:36] you get
[36:37] deeper and deeper in love with the lord
[36:42] it's it's a uh act of progression in our
[36:45] lives as we read the word
[36:49] in second timothy 3 13 and second
[36:52] timothy
[36:56] ii timothy 3 13 uh all the way to 17.
[37:03] now
[37:04] so these two reading your bible and
[37:06] praying it's a progression to get deeper
[37:09] in love with the lord right
[37:16] in timothy 13 or 3 13 it says
[37:21] but the evil but evil men and seducers
[37:24] shall
[37:25] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[37:28] deceived
[37:35] so in the world people get worse and
[37:38] worse and worse
[37:42] we go out in the world we're we're not
[37:44] going to stay the same we're not going
[37:45] to be what we are right now nosotros
[37:48] almond no no no
[38:02] but continue in the things which thou
[38:04] has learned and has been assured of
[38:07] knowing of whom thou has learned them
[38:18] continue in those things that you have
[38:20] already learned
[38:24] verse 15 and from a child thou has known
[38:27] the holy scriptures we we've almost
[38:29] everybody here has been raised in the
[38:31] message
[38:39] we know the holy scriptures
[38:42] so
[38:43] from that of a child on thou has known
[38:46] the holy scriptures which are able to
[38:49] make thee wise unto
[38:51] salvation through faith which is in
[38:54] christ jesus
[38:57] christ
[39:02] jesus this this might not be a great
[39:04] amen
[39:05] sermon today
[39:09] but for the young people i want you guys
[39:11] to understand
[39:16] why the bible is so important for us
[39:23] why is it so important
[39:26] i never
[39:39] why do we have to go to church
[39:43] why do we have to do certain things
[39:46] there is reasons
[39:49] there is benefits
[39:52] why we do certain things
[40:05] but there's reasons why we
[40:08] do the things we do
[40:13] you don't
[40:14] so
[40:15] in verse 15 it's amazing what it says
[40:18] here
[40:21] it says
[40:22] and that from a ch from a child thou has
[40:25] known the holy scriptures
[40:29] which are able to make the wise unto
[40:33] salvation
[40:37] so they asked brother branham a question
[40:41] how do does a christian get deeper in
[40:44] love with christ
[40:47] what is it a progression
[40:50] and the scriptures the bible says
[40:54] that it is um is able to make us
[41:02] the progression
[41:03] unto salvation the
[41:13] you're not saved because you read the
[41:15] bible
[41:17] let me read the bible and get some
[41:18] information and i know i'm saved because
[41:20] i read the bible
[41:25] no but as we read the bible
[41:28] it causes a change
[41:32] it begins to change us in our lives
[41:36] we don't have to read it
[41:39] it's not something that we tell you to
[41:40] do
[41:42] that's not something for a religious
[41:44] duty
[41:47] but it will cause you to change into a
[41:50] christian
[41:53] cristiano it will save you
[41:57] as you begin to read it and read it and
[41:59] consume it
[42:06] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[42:09] god
[42:10] and is profitable for doctrine what's
[42:13] doctrine teaching
[42:15] for reproof
[42:16] for correction
[42:18] for instruction in righteousness
[42:29] so it's profitable for doctrine
[42:32] or doctrine doctrine is what teaching
[42:35] doctrina is
[42:36] you need to learn something from the
[42:38] lord necesita since
[42:41] you'll find it in here love
[42:58] as evidence como evidencia just like
[43:01] it's the same exact word in uh in
[43:03] hebrews
[43:06] where it says faith is the substance of
[43:08] things hoped for commodity questions
[43:22] so it's for evidence
[43:32] and it's for instruction in
[43:34] righteousness
[43:37] this is a guide for us
[43:41] so that we can learn and we can grow
[43:44] and we can go all the way unto salvation
[43:52] 17 that
[43:54] that the man of god may be perfect
[43:57] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[44:07] to be mature to be grown to be
[44:09] accomplished
[44:14] is through the word of god
[44:17] now the word that really struck my heart
[44:22] it says all scripture is scripture is
[44:25] given by inspiration of god
[44:29] that word
[44:31] inspiration
[44:33] means god breathed
[44:42] in psalms 33 6 and um
[44:46] psalms 33 6-9 and straight
[44:55] by the word of the lord so by the word
[44:58] of the lord
[45:00] where the heavens made and all the hosts
[45:03] of them by the breath of his mouth
[45:11] so the scripture isn't just penned by
[45:14] man and and their ideas this is not
[45:17] ideas of who god is
[45:23] this is not a book of philosophy no
[45:25] libero the philosophy this is not like
[45:28] any history book where they have to
[45:29] continue to revise it
[45:36] this is god breathe
[45:39] this has been inspired by god
[45:44] through the very breath of his mouth
[45:49] it said that the worlds were made by the
[45:52] word of god
[45:56] and all the host of them by the breath
[45:58] of his mouth
[46:01] so you cannot have
[46:04] if i'm talking
[46:06] you cannot have my breath without my
[46:08] words
[46:11] they go to and they go together
[46:15] you have my words you have my breath
[46:19] the hebrew word for breath in psalms
[46:25] it means spirit
[46:26] significa
[46:39] so these are divinely breathed from god
[46:41] the scriptures that you read
[46:46] and it tell this tells us that the
[46:48] worlds were created by these same words
[46:55] this little
[46:57] messed up bible my little purple bible
[46:59] my only purple book
[47:06] this is god breathed is
[47:09] the same words and the same spirit that
[47:11] created everything
[47:16] are the same words contained in this
[47:19] book
[47:22] this is an important book este libro
[47:25] importante every book has been changed
[47:29] every book has been updated
[47:33] this book has stayed the same throughout
[47:35] the ages throughout the years
[47:42] were created by the word of the lord and
[47:45] the spirit of his mouth
[47:49] so when you're reading your bible
[47:52] with an open heart
[47:55] all the power of god is working in you
[48:00] it's the same word and in the same
[48:02] spirit that is available to us when we
[48:05] read our bible es el mismo libro el
[48:07] mismo spiritu cuando lemos
[48:10] young people i encourage you to go
[48:11] outside
[48:15] if you can with all the lights here in
[48:18] phoenix
[48:20] in phoenix look at all the stars
[48:23] look at the expansion of the sky miral
[48:25] expansion del cielo look at how great
[48:28] the mountains are miraculous
[48:32] and the valleys
[48:34] in the the the ocean and how great it is
[48:40] that was caused by the word of the lord
[48:46] and and to think of all that
[48:50] that
[48:51] what would happen to us
[48:55] if we take in that same word and that
[48:57] same spirit
[49:04] god created these beautiful
[49:06] things in the earth
[49:10] every every mountain you see every
[49:13] valley was created by the word of the
[49:15] lord
[49:19] and that same word what what would
[49:22] happen if you read it
[49:26] with an open heart
[49:29] what would happen in you
[49:31] if you take in that same word that same
[49:33] spirit
[49:37] the spirit and the word will always come
[49:39] together it does not have one without
[49:41] the other el espirito la palabras
[49:45] when the word was spoken the spirit uh
[49:47] is dispatched and it and it moves and it
[49:50] creates
[49:54] so that same holy spirit that was in the
[49:56] beginning
[49:58] of the principle it's the same holy
[50:00] spirit you have
[50:02] it
[50:05] that's the same holy spirit
[50:08] that created all these things
[50:11] the bible says in the beginning was the
[50:13] word and the word was with god
[50:17] and the word was god
[50:20] and the word was made flesh
[50:23] so what was that word
[50:30] that same word that same spirit was
[50:32] christ jesus
[50:36] jesus and that same
[50:38] christ jesus
[50:40] christ jesus he lived
[50:43] he died for ourselves
[50:45] he rose the third day
[50:48] and he
[50:49] poured down that same spirit to us now
[50:52] de ramos mismo spiritu para nosotros
[50:55] that same word that same spirit now is
[50:58] living inside of each and every person
[51:00] that accepts it
[51:06] so out of nothing the word created
[51:08] everything
[51:11] out of nothing out of
[51:13] nothing
[51:15] not another the word created in all
[51:18] everything we see now la
[51:20] palabras so there might be people here
[51:23] with with great faith
[51:27] there are people
[51:28] that that are there might be people in
[51:31] here that are
[51:32] that have faith uh
[51:36] some that have little faith unos
[51:38] and some that don't have any unos
[51:41] i don't know maybe
[51:44] but
[51:46] the word will create out of nothing
[51:50] you don't have faith nothing is fair the
[51:53] bible says faith comes from hearing
[51:58] hearing the word of god
[52:01] i can say i didn't have faith at one
[52:03] point
[52:06] if i would have had faith i'd have been
[52:08] serving the lord a whole long time a
[52:10] long time ago
[52:14] but i did not have the faith
[52:16] but what changed my heart but
[52:19] what can change your heart what can
[52:21] make your faith grow
[52:25] by hearing the word of god
[52:34] so then we're beginning to understand
[52:36] that the bible isn't just something that
[52:38] we have to read and it's a book of rules
[52:58] you don't have the faith to move on to
[52:59] the next step with the lord
[53:03] faith
[53:04] comes by hearing the word of the lord
[53:09] very simple
[53:11] you will grow in faith you will grow
[53:14] unto salvation
[53:19] it has
[53:21] just as much
[53:22] creative power as it was in the
[53:24] beginning
[53:45] he will ignite that faith that seed that
[53:47] was always in there before the
[53:49] foundation
[53:53] when you open this book that maybe has
[53:55] been sitting in your dresser
[54:00] for a while
[54:01] collecting dust
[54:04] just just open it and read it
[54:08] just see the importance that god wants
[54:11] to talk to
[54:12] importance
[54:14] god wants to reveal his thoughts to you
[54:20] so faith comes by the hearing of the
[54:22] word
[54:25] it doesn't come anywhere else
[54:28] i see people that have faith out in the
[54:30] world
[54:33] that's not true faith
[54:36] the true faith comes by the hearing of
[54:38] the word
[54:42] that is faith in our lord jesus christ
[54:44] faith in his word
[54:49] if there is no word in your life
[54:52] there is no faith ton says
[54:55] it's very simple
[54:57] it's like well why why do i why can't i
[54:59] move on with the lord
[55:02] why can't i get healed
[55:18] faith comes by hearing the word
[55:21] you don't hear the words you know you're
[55:23] not faith that is growing
[55:26] you don't hear or listen to the word
[55:28] there is no salvation that can come to
[55:30] you yes
[55:47] for the word of god is quick
[55:51] and powerful and sharper than any
[55:53] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[55:56] dividing asunder of the soul and spirit
[55:58] and the joints of the marrow and a
[56:00] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[56:02] the heart
[56:21] man that gives you a whole lot of
[56:23] information there
[56:26] first of all the word of the lord is
[56:28] quick
[56:35] so this book it doesn't mean it can grow
[56:38] legs but you read it and it's something
[56:41] will work in your life no significant
[56:54] and it's sharper than any two-edged
[56:56] sword
[57:10] it's
[57:10] a fine
[57:12] uh edged
[57:14] knife or scalpel
[57:20] that it can separate between the spirit
[57:23] and the soul
[57:27] that it's so great that it is a
[57:29] discerner of the thoughts and the
[57:31] intents of the heart question
[57:36] so it discerns you while you're reading
[57:38] your bible
[57:41] it's discerning your thoughts and your
[57:43] intentions
[57:47] i once heard brother billy graham say
[57:50] billy graham
[57:51] every time you read your bible
[57:54] it's an interview with the almighty god
[57:59] when we think we're reading the bible
[58:02] the word is reading us
[58:06] and what's amazing it begins to expose
[58:09] things in our lives
[58:13] we don't need anybody to go tell us what
[58:15] what's going on read your bible and it
[58:17] will begin to reveal things
[58:23] it will reveal things in your life that
[58:25] maybe you've you didn't know what was
[58:27] going wrong
[58:32] it will expose things in your life that
[58:34] you didn't know you're doing wrong
[58:39] that's what the word does
[58:42] and you know what every christian should
[58:43] run to it
[58:46] and put themselves in the balance
[58:59] i just feel like something's wrong
[59:02] you
[59:16] even a discerner of the thoughts and the
[59:18] intents of your heart
[59:24] that's what the word of god does
[59:28] it's a powerful tool it is
[59:32] is jesus christ this is god in written
[59:34] form estos jesus christ
[59:37] amen amen
[59:40] in 1st peter 2
[59:43] and primera de pedro capitulo
[59:48] it says as newborn babes desiring the
[59:51] sincere milk of the word that she may
[59:54] grow thereby and if and if if
[59:58] so be ye tasted that the lord is
[1:00:01] gracious
[1:00:13] so
[1:00:14] the young people today
[1:00:19] those that have just given their hearts
[1:00:20] to the lord
[1:00:23] the bible is milk labilla
[1:00:27] and and the only way we can grow it
[1:00:31] is by
[1:00:33] eating the word espor comer la palabra
[1:00:35] it says the only way we can grow is by
[1:00:38] the sincere
[1:00:39] milk of the word the universe
[1:00:44] you know i um
[1:00:46] last week was a very strange um week for
[1:00:49] me
[1:00:53] i was at work doing what i was supposed
[1:00:55] to do
[1:00:57] and there was this man that stopped me
[1:01:00] stop
[1:01:01] my boss and i uh
[1:01:04] and he began to say that he was praying
[1:01:09] praying for um somebody who he could
[1:01:12] give
[1:01:13] some books to orlando
[1:01:17] and there are just books of how you can
[1:01:20] grow and how you can just mature as a
[1:01:22] person here
[1:01:26] and i began to look at how much those
[1:01:28] books were they they're expensive
[1:01:33] he said here these are your books i want
[1:01:35] you to have them
[1:01:38] i want you to grow as a person i see how
[1:01:41] you're working and i want you to um just
[1:01:43] continue to grow
[1:01:48] he said that he felt led by the lord to
[1:01:50] do that
[1:01:53] he prayed
[1:01:54] so that he knew who to give it to el
[1:01:56] estudo
[1:01:59] it wasn't the bible or anything
[1:02:02] it was just so that it was a books to
[1:02:04] help you grow as a person
[1:02:08] persona and that's what books do yes
[1:02:11] you can get books to to um allow you to
[1:02:14] learn certain things
[1:02:19] books will
[1:02:20] allow you to achieve certain things in
[1:02:22] your job or your school or your life
[1:02:24] libros
[1:02:28] brother branham says in this message on
[1:02:30] a mother's day el mano brandon
[1:02:36] i might um pass this on to the young
[1:02:38] people
[1:02:41] do you know that abraham lincoln never
[1:02:44] owned a book in his life until he was
[1:02:47] after 20 years 21 years old
[1:02:55] but the bible and the fox's book of
[1:02:57] martyrs
[1:03:00] martinez
[1:03:02] so he didn't have any other book
[1:03:05] only the bible and fox's book of martyrs
[1:03:13] see what you read molds the character
[1:03:16] that you are miran
[1:03:20] what you read what you consume
[1:03:23] molds the characters
[1:03:27] what are we doing here questions
[1:03:30] it's just a good question to think about
[1:03:32] what am i on social media
[1:03:34] am i doing other things that's molding
[1:03:36] my character questions
[1:03:48] so
[1:03:49] brother brandon says no wonder we've got
[1:03:50] a bunch of neurotics today
[1:03:55] little old fiction magazines estos
[1:03:58] revistas deficion and vulgar and
[1:04:00] nonsense
[1:04:03] placed on our newsstands
[1:04:06] he owned the bible and fox's book of
[1:04:08] martyrs look what it made him
[1:04:19] when paul began to talk about or begin
[1:04:22] to judge how
[1:04:24] a a christian becomes mature
[1:04:29] christian
[1:04:30] he judged him by the food they consumed
[1:04:36] our growth depends on what we eat
[1:04:49] is not based on how old we are
[1:04:54] or how many years we've been a christian
[1:04:57] cuantos anos emocido cristianos
[1:05:00] that's not how paul measured the people
[1:05:04] when he was talking to young converts
[1:05:09] he gave them the sincerity of the milk
[1:05:12] of the world
[1:05:16] and that's how he measured the people
[1:05:18] yes
[1:05:20] it doesn't matter if you've been in the
[1:05:22] message for 20 years
[1:05:26] if you've been a christian for 20 years
[1:05:29] i can tell you
[1:05:33] the word can tell
[1:05:48] that's how i can show my maturity
[1:05:53] that's something very important that
[1:05:55] that i want us to understand
[1:05:59] people are trying to stay away from the
[1:06:01] deep things like
[1:06:09] right if you've been in the message for
[1:06:11] 20 years and you still can't get over
[1:06:14] something
[1:06:15] yeah
[1:06:19] i'm not going to base it on how long
[1:06:21] you've been in the message but i'm going
[1:06:23] to base it on what is in the word
[1:06:26] what you're consuming
[1:06:35] paul based it on what they consumed in
[1:06:38] hebrews 5 12 it says
[1:06:42] for
[1:06:43] though
[1:06:43] um
[1:06:45] for though by this time you ought to be
[1:06:47] teachers you need someone to teach you
[1:06:49] again the basic principles of the
[1:06:52] oracles of god
[1:07:11] for everyone who lives on milk is
[1:07:13] unskilled in the word of righteousness
[1:07:15] since he is a child
[1:07:24] but solid food is for the mature for
[1:07:26] those who have their powers of
[1:07:28] discernment trained by constant practice
[1:07:31] to distinguish good from evil pero
[1:07:34] alimento solido espara los quiana
[1:07:36] alcanzado madures para los que por eluso
[1:07:39] tienen los entidos
[1:07:44] so we are judged by what we eat
[1:07:49] and as we continue to consume in this
[1:07:51] continuum
[1:07:53] we grow
[1:07:57] the bible is not treated it should not
[1:07:59] be treated as information but it should
[1:08:01] be treated as spiritual foods
[1:08:07] so and the bible will meet you wherever
[1:08:10] you're at
[1:08:13] if you need milk
[1:08:15] read the bible
[1:08:16] if you need meat read the bible
[1:08:19] it will meet you at where your spiritual
[1:08:22] condition is
[1:08:26] but it's not okay to just eat once every
[1:08:30] two weeks
[1:08:34] twice every week
[1:08:36] when brother the brother so-and-so comes
[1:08:38] and preaches that's when oh i got a good
[1:08:40] meal today
[1:08:45] we're going to stun our growth
[1:08:48] it's a spiritual growth this is not
[1:08:50] something that is a rules that you have
[1:08:52] to do
[1:08:56] but if you feel like you're not growing
[1:08:59] as a christian
[1:09:01] christian because we're not consuming
[1:09:03] the word
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:18] well the lord has never talked to me
[1:09:19] audibly
[1:09:22] oh he talks to me every day
[1:09:26] when i open my bible
[1:09:29] every day the lord can talk to you
[1:09:33] every day the lord can reveal something
[1:09:36] to you
[1:09:38] and as as he continues to reveal himself
[1:09:41] to you
[1:09:43] what happens you begin to have a deeper
[1:09:46] relationship for the lord
[1:09:52] and it'll save you
[1:09:54] it'll
[1:09:56] put you all unto salvation
[1:09:59] and it will allow you to grow
[1:10:03] all the way to a deeper relationship
[1:10:05] with the lord
[1:10:06] relation
[1:10:08] by just reading this simple book
[1:10:13] this book that maybe you don't
[1:10:14] understand
[1:10:17] oh this book that it's just so many
[1:10:19] things i don't understand
[1:10:23] but we have to go in just like how we
[1:10:26] open up the word here in church
[1:10:35] and we pray before we open the
[1:10:37] scriptures
[1:10:40] and we ask god lord take control of this
[1:11:08] that's what's happening when the word is
[1:11:10] opened
[1:11:29] lord i just i don't know what to to read
[1:11:31] lord
[1:11:33] but i commit myself unto you now
[1:11:37] let this word anoint me
[1:11:40] let this word uh become a revelation in
[1:11:43] my life
[1:11:45] lord maybe i haven't been living the
[1:11:47] right life senior quesadillas
[1:11:50] reveal it to my to me lord
[1:12:20] it's a beautiful thing
[1:12:23] it's a beautiful thing what the word
[1:12:24] does
[1:12:29] the bible uh
[1:12:31] will meet you wherever you're at
[1:12:34] on
[1:12:36] so where did we learn from
[1:12:38] where did we
[1:12:40] where do we learn about jesus where did
[1:12:42] we learn him from don says
[1:12:45] jesus how do you know about jesus
[1:12:48] jesus the bible la biblia
[1:12:50] from where is our christian
[1:12:52] faith based on establish
[1:12:55] christianity the bible
[1:12:57] everything we practice as christians
[1:13:01] christianity is a result of the bible
[1:13:05] our whole faith and religion exist
[1:13:08] because of the bible
[1:13:13] there wouldn't be a seventh angel
[1:13:15] without the bible nobody around
[1:13:16] septimous
[1:13:18] we would not be here right now in this
[1:13:20] service without the bible
[1:13:24] we would have no hope without the bible
[1:13:28] every foundation that we have
[1:13:40] this is very important to read es
[1:13:43] because if i say i'm a christian
[1:13:46] christian and i don't even know why
[1:13:48] innis
[1:13:50] or i don't even know what's in this that
[1:13:53] causes me to be a christian
[1:13:57] christian
[1:13:57] something's not right says
[1:14:00] right we could say well no as long as i
[1:14:03] know jesus
[1:14:06] jesus this is how you build the
[1:14:08] relationship
[1:14:11] how do you know how he's going to think
[1:14:13] of you como sabes
[1:14:15] how does he how do you know how what he
[1:14:17] wants you to do without reading the
[1:14:19] bible
[1:14:22] it's all based on the bible
[1:14:25] if you're a christian cristiano
[1:14:29] this
[1:14:30] goes with you everywhere
[1:14:33] now it's on your phone you can just take
[1:14:35] it wherever you want to teleport
[1:14:39] that's just an automatic thing
[1:15:25] if i'm a christian i'm reading this she
[1:15:27] said cristiano
[1:15:29] esto it's very simple as muysen see you
[1:15:31] if i'm not a christian i'm there's no
[1:15:33] reason to read it
[1:15:36] this this word shows the plans of god
[1:15:39] for us and his thoughts
[1:15:44] isaiah 55 8-11 it says
[1:15:50] says for my thoughts are not your
[1:15:52] thoughts
[1:15:54] neither my way neither are your ways my
[1:15:56] ways declares the lord.
[1:16:05] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:16:07] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:16:10] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:16:17] altos caminos
[1:16:22] a lot of times we stop right there
[1:16:25] god's thoughts are higher than our
[1:16:27] thoughts
[1:16:30] we can never know what the lord is
[1:16:32] his thoughts are they're just too high
[1:16:37] standing in an open field once
[1:16:41] try to touch the sky
[1:16:44] you can never never touch it
[1:16:47] that's as high as god's thoughts are
[1:16:49] from ours
[1:16:54] but
[1:16:55] in verse 10 it says
[1:16:58] for as the rain and the snow comes down
[1:17:00] from where heaven
[1:17:02] and do not return
[1:17:04] but
[1:17:05] but water the earth making it uh bring
[1:17:08] forth sprout giving seed to the sower
[1:17:11] and bread to the eater
[1:17:13] por que como de siende de los
[1:17:25] shall my word be goes out from my mouth
[1:17:28] and it shall not return to it empty but
[1:17:32] it shall accomplish that which i purpose
[1:17:34] and shall succeed in the thing which
[1:17:37] which i sent it a sia
[1:17:56] but just as the rain comes down to the
[1:17:58] earth
[1:18:02] and waters the ground
[1:18:05] causes the seeds to turn into plants
[1:18:10] and allow the earth to prosper
[1:18:13] que la tierra prospera is the same way
[1:18:16] god wants his thoughts
[1:18:20] to come down from his mouth
[1:18:23] and that it may lay in our hearts
[1:18:27] god doesn't want his thoughts up there
[1:18:31] god wants his thoughts in our hearts
[1:18:35] he wants us to be watered by the word
[1:18:50] so that's what god's intention is yes
[1:18:54] now in closing i just want to say
[1:18:58] how did adam and eve lose everything
[1:19:02] they reasoned with the word
[1:19:06] what what does
[1:19:07] in joshua it says do not turn from your
[1:19:09] right or to your left
[1:19:14] stay with the word
[1:19:18] there's a reason why how can i stay with
[1:19:20] the word if i don't even know it
[1:19:24] how can i fight the devil with the word
[1:19:26] if i don't even know it
[1:19:30] the devil how he took over the whole
[1:19:32] entire world
[1:19:46] they got away from the protection of the
[1:19:48] world
[1:19:51] so the reason why it's so important
[1:19:55] because even when jesus was on earth
[1:19:59] the devil tried to do the same exact
[1:20:01] thing
[1:20:04] why is it so important to stay with the
[1:20:06] word
[1:20:08] because when he was faced with the devil
[1:20:13] when he was faced faced with the
[1:20:15] temptations
[1:20:29] so he could have said something that was
[1:20:30] never said in the old testament
[1:20:35] because he was the word
[1:20:37] but he didn't do that
[1:20:39] he got words that isaiah spoke
[1:20:43] he got words that was already quoted
[1:20:46] from the old testament
[1:20:50] and that's how he faced satan
[1:20:54] brother branham says an identified
[1:20:56] masterpiece of god el monobram this is
[1:21:01] he showed how the weakest of christians
[1:21:03] can defeat satan with just the word el
[1:21:06] mostro como los cristianos
[1:21:10] con solo la palabra i love that come on
[1:21:14] we have no excuse no tenemos excusa to
[1:21:17] be beat down
[1:21:20] to be kicked by the devil
[1:21:24] no just use the word on it
[1:21:33] he could have um he had powers he could
[1:21:35] have smote um satan any way he wanted to
[1:21:38] but he didn't use it
[1:21:55] everywhere it's written so he
[1:21:58] defeated saying by the word of god
[1:22:06] so it doesn't
[1:22:07] only cause you to grow
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:32] just don't say it all you know what i
[1:22:34] just uh
[1:22:35] just don't say anything to the devil and
[1:22:37] he'll go away
[1:22:41] you shouldn't be talking to the devil
[1:22:45] use the word no us
[1:22:47] use the word and he has to go uh
[1:22:51] if you knew how great the word is
[1:22:55] how powerful it is
[1:22:58] that it is alive against people oh man
[1:23:02] oh yeah just like i spoke the last time
[1:23:05] i spoke on confession
[1:23:08] confession means say what he says
[1:23:13] grab that word
[1:23:16] in in joshua 1 it says do not let the
[1:23:19] word depart from your mouth
[1:23:25] you use it and you speak the word
[1:23:29] you begin to confess
[1:23:31] confess your salvation
[1:23:44] you're not using your own thinking
[1:23:54] what an amazing thing god told joshua to
[1:23:56] do okay
[1:23:59] do not let the word depart from your
[1:24:01] mouth
[1:24:03] that was the same joshua
[1:24:06] josue that told the sun to stand still
[1:24:10] that was the same joshua
[1:24:12] josue that began to speak to the
[1:24:28] this
[1:24:39] so whenever he confronted with with
[1:24:42] things
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:57] in ephesians 12 6 12 it says
[1:25:00] yo
[1:25:02] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:25:04] blood but against principalities against
[1:25:06] powers against rulers of darkness of
[1:25:09] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:25:12] in high places
[1:25:25] i remember when i was in el paso once
[1:25:28] in el paso and i heard brother judah
[1:25:30] mata preach yes
[1:25:33] he uh
[1:25:34] read this scripture
[1:25:36] and he gave an example of if we played
[1:25:39] against an nba player
[1:25:47] he said imagine if you go and maybe
[1:25:50] you're pretty good in basketball
[1:25:51] imaginative
[1:25:55] and you go and you try to play against
[1:25:58] lebron james
[1:26:01] you play against michael jordan
[1:26:04] michael jordan you play against all
[1:26:05] these good
[1:26:21] those great soccer players
[1:26:25] we'll get slaughtered
[1:26:29] we have no chance
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:32] why because we're amateurs
[1:26:48] there is no match there's no way we can
[1:26:50] defeat them
[1:26:53] that's how it is when we're being
[1:26:54] tempted by the devil
[1:26:57] don't you reason with them
[1:27:00] don't try any slick move on
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:16] rulers in high places
[1:27:21] rulers of darkness
[1:27:24] against powers and principalities
[1:27:28] these are seasoned players we're dealing
[1:27:30] with
[1:27:43] every time the devil began to say well
[1:27:45] why don't you
[1:27:46] take this rock and make it into bread so
[1:27:48] you can eat
[1:27:49] it
[1:27:53] jesus begin to quote the word jesus
[1:27:57] what did the devil do queso diablo he's
[1:27:59] smart
[1:28:02] he didn't try to reason with him anymore
[1:28:05] he changed the subject yeah
[1:28:08] he said okay okay i can't get him with
[1:28:09] that one
[1:28:11] all right come over here
[1:28:22] and god
[1:28:23] jesus began to just what combat him with
[1:28:26] the word every
[1:28:39] when you meditate on it day and night
[1:28:44] you keep it in your mouth
[1:28:46] you will prosper
[1:28:50] that is a promise
[1:28:52] that's not a promise for me
[1:28:54] that's not a promise from anybody else
[1:28:56] but the word of the lord
[1:29:01] it said keep my word in your mouth
[1:29:05] meditate on it day and night
[1:29:08] and your ways shall be prosperous
[1:29:13] that is that thus saith the lord
[1:29:17] in joshua 1 7 and josue
[1:29:20] read it that is god telling us
[1:29:25] that you will prosper in everything you
[1:29:26] do prosperity
[1:29:28] whether you you struggle in life
[1:29:30] whatever goes on in your life
[1:29:34] you will overcome everything because you
[1:29:36] have the word on your side
[1:29:39] heavens and earth shall pass away
[1:29:43] but my word shall never pass
[1:29:47] never
[1:29:50] so it uh if you'd like to stand with me
[1:29:55] and uh
[1:29:56] musicians would like to come up
[1:29:59] the word is an offensive or uh
[1:30:02] is a weapon of offense uh
[1:30:21] the helmet of salvation defensive el
[1:30:23] casco
[1:30:25] shield of faith
[1:30:28] breastplate of righteousness
[1:30:31] but ephesians 6 17 it shows
[1:30:36] that the sword of the spirit which is
[1:30:38] the word of god
[1:30:42] that is a weapon of attack that's a tool
[1:30:44] of attack yes
[1:30:48] that's that's what we use when we go out
[1:30:50] in the world
[1:30:53] how can i defeat the enemy if i don't
[1:30:55] even know the word
[1:30:59] so i got this question
[1:31:01] how much do you know your weapon cuanto
[1:31:03] con no arma how much do you know this
[1:31:08] how much do you know
[1:31:10] if you're concerned about your growth
[1:31:15] if you want
[1:31:16] the holy spirit see they say
[1:31:19] if you want healing see necesita
[1:31:21] if you want
[1:31:23] faith seekers
[1:31:25] just read the word
[1:31:28] read the word and open your heart
[1:31:32] and every time you read that word
[1:31:36] god will perform a miracle in you
[1:31:40] i promise that with all my heart
[1:31:44] because that is a promise that god has
[1:31:46] given us
[1:31:48] amen let us bow our heads amen
