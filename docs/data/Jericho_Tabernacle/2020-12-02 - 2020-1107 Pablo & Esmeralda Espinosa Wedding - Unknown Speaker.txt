in the house of god therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh as the husband subjects himself to god then everything runs in harmony and we have a lot less friction now mark 10 6. but from the beginning of the creation god made made them male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so that they are no more twain but one flesh wherefore what god has joined together let no man put us under but the whoremongers and adulterers god will judge ephesians 5 22 and 27. wives submit yourself unto your husbands your own husband yes unto the lord for the husband is ahead of the wife even as christ is the head of the church therefore as the church is subject unto the church so let the wise speak to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives i would like to ask you a question pablo do you love her llamas yes that he might
