grace for allowing us to be here today lord i ask you lord to remove us from the scene may you speak to us may you calm our spirit down you may relax us we surrender ourselves to your holy ghost to your word may we subject ourselves to your word that your youth [Music] amen amen amen if you be uh so kind to quickly go to saint matthew the sixth chapter el capitolo says uh the 30th verse the 34th verse like to thank brother john alvarado for the opportunity once again for speaking to the to [Music] says wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith is therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where thou shall we be clothed and here it says parentheses for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that he have need of all these things but but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added on to you el take therefore no thought for tomorrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient on to the day is the evil thereof now let us go to the same same book just to this 22nd chapter enemies [Music] to the 40th verse it says for master what is the great commandment in the law pregnant jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind jesus this is the first and great commandment is amen you may take your seats may god bless the reading of his word it's like once again it's really nice to be here uh very pleasant atmosphere i'd like to give a title to the message they today if you'd be appropriate i'd like to entitle it as first first something very simple doesn't matter what you do important if you're about to put some furniture [Music] there's always that first thing that you need to and so i always go to the scripture and i look up certain words but to me it is but i even had to look up the definition of the word first definition and it is it's coming first is coming before all others a lot of us sometimes we say well i don't have time the first thing we do is the what should be first it should be the first thing in our time and the first thing in our order like i said it doesn't matter what we do no important doesn't matter we're setting up some furniture no importance usually they come with instructions and they come in a numerical order and it says first so sometimes it's happened to me where i have to take it all apart and start in the first thing and the first thing usually is set everything in order the ponetto into order set everything in order ponton all of its bolts all the sizes all of the sizes of the the foots and whatever you want to do amen amen it doesn't matter what you're going to do an important if you're going to start courting a young lady and this isn't just isn't for the young men there's something you must do first it's everything has a first a lot of the times of the youth today or the couples today you know i had a co-worker there a lady that i work with and she started asking me what brought you down here so forth and so forth so i'm married and this and that is she said well you never live together no no i'm from texas i'll come out here i'll leave you and once i leave yeah i had to find another you don't have to live with her you got to know her character so forth and so forth what i'm trying to explain to you uh we want to go to the last step is to try if we are compatible and you can apply that to any situation amen do you love the lord now yeah now here in matthew the sixth chapter again here jesus is talking to us to his people he says he says don't worry about tomorrow don't worry about it of little faith don't worry about it it says i know that you gentiles seek after these things and he says for all these things you gentiles look after it but your heavenly father know it that you need these things and his righteousness not the because a lot of times we we like to get a job we want to get a house we like to get this and we like to get that and we want to start looking for a spouse and we just want to look for this but everything has its order everything has its time before we look for those things christ is saying i know you need them necesita i know you need a spouse second is it doesn't cause you i know you need your husband i know you need your wife second is it uh [Music] now if christ is telling us to look for something and obtain something we must do our research and see what he's telling us to look for amen amen oh yeah your mom's going to say you will go go to the store or give me this and give me that oh yes i don't know i don't know what you're i don't know what you're looking for ask her what is it that you want me to look for a lot of times where we're like i make a mistake and i bring her the wrong thing but we want to be right with the lord his righteousness what is his righteousness to be morally right the synonyms is to be in other words it's goodness uh [Music] because he's that do will that when jesus was on earth he taught his disciples everything how to pray to even how to act when he enters someone's house don't come in like this and like no come in respectfully jesus eve taught him every little detail of what they must do jesus listens he says that he taught the disciples how to pray okay associated but oh my god he's handsome guapo and you pray to the lord you say lord but let your will be done seek first the kingdom of god who is god and to enter in this kingdom you must do his will that is complete and when you pray for his will it hurts willy well lord is she so pretty that car oh with the oatmeal oh my gosh but let your will be done let your will be done hey man do you still love the lord i mean i'm an el senor you still amen now my base scripture is in first kings and the 17th verse you don't have to open it if you don't want to no i'm not going to read it i'm just going to make emphasis and here in the scripture it's talking about elijah already the tisch bites he was the prophet in the time when jezebel and the king ahab and on the 17th verse elijah stood before ahab and he said as the god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall be no dew nor rain these years but these years but according to my words now the elijah standing before the king and he was bringing forth judgment and he said there will be no rain until i say that's the prophet speaking all right until god says he says according to my word that's good that's good stuff isn't it this is rico now elijah he fled he went to a cave uh elias he went to the brook el fuego and and elijah was there yes and he started to notice that the brook began to dry up because he commanded the heavens not to reign and the lord spoke to elijah el senor and he says get up you say levanta arise and go to zerabeth if we are sick of it go up there because i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee hot son he didn't know what what a woman was which woman was it the lord didn't tell him it's going to be this one by the name of this uh you know fetching some fetching some some firewood and here eliza elijah here i'm going to read the scripture on the tenth verse so he arose and went to zera but then when he came to the gate to the city behold the widow woman was there gathering the sticks and he called for her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water and vessel that i may drink and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel a little oil and a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that he may eat and die yeah and her young one is stomach cake because she hasn't eaten and he will say mom i'm hungry we haven't eaten and brother graham said the little boy would go up to the pantry and you open it there was nothing to eat and as a mother or as a parent it would just break anyone's heart to notice that your kid will grab his stomach my stomach hurts said that she was a widow this is and her husband was a soldier and her soldier brother says and the message why we're not a denomination yes she was no longer bound to the law of her husband [Music] she was no longer bound to the denomination so she was open is but what an honor to receive elijah oh it's amazing to receive the pastor at your house your house is you have elijah coming into your house she god didn't send him to the palace god send it to a widow woman yo slow man though i'm not view that god didn't send it to a buffet the old roman buffet god sent them to get a little bit of cake hallelujah and elijah went ifuelias he was obedient for over the infant and this wouldn't this would a woman didn't know what was going to go on but she was free from the law of her husband let's see if she accepts elijah's message wait a minute a lot of people today will be like just you're crazy you're crazy you go did it yourself you old man amen oh i feel the holy spirit oh lord and imagine that woman imagine hearing the cry of our little boy escuchando el yanto del nina hey mom we haven't eaten this and here comes this man yeah he was elijah what is she saying you're crazy my son has been crying and crying and crying bring it on to me and make it then make it to you and your son do it to me first then you eat it then you give it to your son obedience do it first seek first the kingdom of god hey man you love the lord i'm senor hey man i'm going to read you a little quote here from brother branham brother ram says do you sell money brandon but then she hurt she started to turn again then she heard a voice say but bring it bring me one first quest what do we learn here first the kingdom of god how will i need she had to go down and get her last piece of bread she had it she didn't have to go do this no but she had a goal to do the only thing that stood between her and death mixed together self-sacrifice sacrificing obedience when god's prophet when the prophet says a certain thing this is then she heard the sweetest thing and tons of escucholo yes she's ever heard yeah that all sufficient word that all of us listen for [Music] there come across that gate a blast from the prophet's voice he says for us saith the lord i'll go brother branham says decent amount of brother do it where does he say it in his word do it let your [Music] elijah elias william miriam branham william murray god's mouthpiece is the book of the viewers i do not believe that william bradley get william brown god's mouthpiece he's a liar no no no that the lord was talking to el senor i'm going to find the scripture and look nine lucas nueve and he was talking to them and he said follow me and notice what the rea what their response was he says he says and he said on to another follow me but he said lord suffer me first but let me do this first what elijah says what give me to me first give it to me first and notice the blessing that came after them put god first hey man i just can you
