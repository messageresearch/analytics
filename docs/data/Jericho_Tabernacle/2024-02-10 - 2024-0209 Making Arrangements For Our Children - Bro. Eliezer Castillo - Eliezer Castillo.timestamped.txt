[26:02] filled with all precious and pleasant
[26:11] riches the Bible says that a house is
[26:18] built a family is
[26:21] built is by the knowledge of the
[26:26] Lord

[26:36] father I'll know how to be a better
[26:40] husband I'll know how to to um govern my

[26:59] 6 train up a child in the way he should
[27:03] go and when he is old he will not depart
[27:07] from
[27:12] it let us bow our
[27:16] heads Heavenly
[27:19] Father Lord we we come into your holy
[27:22] presence this this
[27:26] evening
[27:29] father we're not claiming anything this
[27:33] evening we don't have anything good to
[27:36] bring to you
[27:39] Lord but father we come here with an
[27:41] open heart this
[27:45] evening knowing Lord that you are rich
[27:48] in
[27:50] Mercy knowing Lord that all good
[27:54] knowledge comes through you
[27:56] father
[28:00] father and we just ask Lord as we review
[28:03] this little
[28:06] study we just ask that you open our eyes
[28:12] father that you can help each and every
[28:15] person those that are standing those
[28:16] that are in the back and the front
[28:22] father so that we may know how to live
[28:27] good Christian lives
[28:30] father and we can dedicate not only
[28:33] ourselves to
[28:36] you but our family
[28:39] Lord Lord we just ask that you take
[28:42] control of this
[28:45] service speak to the open ears and the
[28:48] Open Hearts this
[28:52] evening in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:54] Christ we
[28:56] pray amen and amen amen amen amen you
[29:00] may be
[29:04] seated for for a few months it's already
[29:07] almost been a
[29:12] year uh we've been studying on um these
[29:15] Green
[29:19] books which is um marriage courtship and
[29:24] dating and uh it's it's been such a a
[29:27] blessing to
[29:30] us I know it's been a blessing to
[29:34] me just just because it's this
[29:39] brother I believe his name is brother
[29:41] Paul
[29:43] durksen Paul he he um put all these
[29:47] quotes
[29:49] together so that he can create a
[29:53] picture H how we should not only
[29:56] approach um the young people should
[29:58] approach dating and
[30:05] courtship but it all goes all the way to
[30:08] marriage and
[30:13] families and it's just all quotes of
[30:15] brother brandham and all uh
[30:20] scripture so this evening we want to
[30:23] review chapter
[30:26] nine
[30:29] um we just finished uh chapter
[30:32] eight which talked about the role of the
[30:37] woman chapter 10 and
[30:42] on we're going to be speaking on how to
[30:45] to look you plan and you pray for the
[30:48] perfect
[30:54] person but before that chapter nine
[30:59] it talks about making arrangements for
[31:02] our
[31:06] children and it it really talks to the
[31:09] parents
[31:11] here how how we need to make
[31:14] arrangements for our
[31:20] children what are the greatest
[31:21] Revelations for
[31:24] me that I saw in the Bible
[31:28] is that my children are not
[31:32] mine they they have been borrowed and I
[31:35] I'm borrowing them they have been given
[31:37] to me for a
[31:42] purpose so so every person that has a
[31:48] child whe whether they're babies or
[31:51] they're already grown
[31:55] up that child was given given to you for
[31:57] a
[32:00] purpose and it reminds me of the story
[32:03] of
[32:06] Hannah how she wanted a child so
[32:11] bad she she almost felt like it was a
[32:14] curse upon
[32:18] her that she didn't have a
[32:21] child and she cried out unto the
[32:24] Lord and she said Lord
[32:28] if you give me this
[32:30] child Lord if you bless me with a a
[32:33] little
[32:35] baby I
[32:37] promise that I will give that child back
[32:40] to
[32:42] you and that's our prayer
[32:46] tonight Lord my children are
[32:50] mine I I have a job to
[32:53] do I have to prepare them
[32:57] because one of these
[32:59] days they're going to go out on their
[33:02] own they're going to do whatever they
[33:05] want to
[33:06] do and it's my
[33:09] job it's the father and the mother's
[33:12] job to prepare the way for
[33:16] them to train them up in in everything
[33:19] that they should
[33:23] go so that if they Veer off one day
[33:30] if they fall one
[33:31] day if if they're older and and they
[33:34] they forget the things of of of their
[33:41] parents it has to come back to
[33:45] them the word of their parents has to
[33:48] come
[33:50] back because the Bible says that
[33:53] everything that they you train up your
[33:55] child to go
[33:59] it will not depart from
[34:02] them brother brandham says in the
[34:04] message taking sides with
[34:10] Jesus now we've got to think of young
[34:17] people we got children most of us people
[34:23] here married man has children
[34:27] well what about them that's coming
[34:34] on so so he's he's saying okay what
[34:38] about those that are going to be taking
[34:40] our
[34:44] place and he gives an example
[34:47] here he said like I used to kick up uh
[34:51] down there about them throwing the C uh
[34:53] those cast
[34:55] Nets
[34:59] on the river and pulling them out the
[35:02] perch and drinks and drunkards and
[35:09] things I've seen them pile up high as
[35:12] the ceiling
[35:16] here big fine perch laying
[35:21] there the stink would be all around the
[35:25] river I went down there as the game
[35:28] watered would make them stop
[35:36] it I got a letter leave them
[35:41] alone what are you what are you going to
[35:45] do it belongs to
[35:48] Kentucky and now Kentucky warning can't
[35:51] uh come over
[35:55] here because he's out of his
[35:59] territory Indiana Warden has nothing to
[36:02] say into
[36:06] it because the water belongs to
[36:11] Kentucky there you are there's nothing
[36:13] that can be
[36:15] done I said I've got a boy coming that
[36:18] would like to
[36:23] fish why they would put his picture in
[36:25] the paper if he caught a a
[36:31] chub 20 years from
[36:34] now let that go on like that those Nets
[36:37] those traps and everything
[36:41] else and it's practically getting like
[36:44] that right
[36:47] now see what's the
[36:50] matter you've got to think of these
[36:53] that's coming
[36:55] on
[36:57] so when brother Bram was a game
[37:01] warden he saw these people um throwing
[37:04] cast Nets and catching all the
[37:10] fish and they wouldn't keep the fish but
[37:13] the they would just he would allow the
[37:14] fish to just lay
[37:19] there and brother Bram knowing that he
[37:22] loved to
[37:25] fish he said I have to stop
[37:29] that because one of these days my child
[37:31] is going to go up there he's going to
[37:33] want to go fish this
[37:38] place so I have to do something to
[37:41] correct that so that my child will be
[37:43] able to go and fish one of these
[37:49] days so he gave that little
[37:53] example and he goes on to say
[37:57] so we've got to think of the others that
[37:59] are coming behind
[38:02] us these young people and so
[38:07] forth and and a place for our
[38:11] children our daughters we don't want
[38:13] them in the world in these things like
[38:19] that we want them girls to be raised
[38:22] like their
[38:25] mothers
[38:27] now he he says something uh tremendous
[38:31] here he says we've got to make
[38:34] arrangements for
[38:39] that so we've got something to do with
[38:43] it if if we want the CH the daughters to
[38:47] be raised like the
[38:51] mothers the sons to be children of
[38:55] God then us as
[38:59] parents we've got to make arrangements
[39:01] for
[39:03] that and if there is no
[39:07] tomorrow we don't know that but if there
[39:10] is no
[39:13] tomorrow we we haven't nothing um but
[39:17] been at the post the Master's
[39:23] business and been found at our post of
[39:25] Duty when uh when he does
[39:30] come see I would I would suggest
[39:35] this I did Brother Neville let's carry
[39:37] on this just as we
[39:42] have let's let it just stay the way it
[39:47] is I'm grateful for these young
[39:51] ministers see actually at the day of
[39:55] judgment for this entire valleys through
[39:58] through here there'll be no
[40:04] excuse because we've got little churches
[40:07] sitting out everywhere Outpost listing
[40:10] post
[40:17] waiting last night I was at in a
[40:19] Brother's
[40:22] church and asked if all if all in the
[40:26] was fortified behind the
[40:31] word and every hand went
[40:34] up now that made me feel
[40:38] good so so we need to
[40:41] arrange something for our
[40:48] children years ago I heard a
[40:51] brother preach preach a message about
[40:54] time of decision
[40:58] and and he began to talk about how when
[41:01] a child is
[41:05] born we make all the decisions for that
[41:11] baby we we make sure when they want to
[41:14] eat we make sure when they need to be
[41:19] changed and as they grow
[41:22] up we have 100% control
[41:29] of their
[41:30] decisions if they want to go right run
[41:32] in the
[41:34] street well it's your decision go
[41:37] ahead no no we we say no that's
[41:41] dangerous we'll make the decision you're
[41:43] not going over
[41:48] there and and as they grow older maybe
[41:51] they turn
[41:54] seven they begin to make little tiny
[42:00] decisions they want to take a little bit
[42:02] of control of their
[42:05] life so as you're dressing them up to go
[42:08] to
[42:11] school and maybe your little daughter
[42:15] says I don't want to wear those blue
[42:19] shoes I want to wear the pink
[42:21] ones you know what I'm going to allow
[42:23] you to take that
[42:25] decision
[42:28] and you give them a little bit of Reign
[42:30] on their and control on their
[42:36] decisions as they grow up and they grow
[42:39] up and as they get
[42:43] older they begin to make bigger
[42:48] decisions what school are they going to
[42:51] take what job are they going to
[42:55] do what friend group are they going to
[42:58] have they they're going to be begin to
[43:01] make bigger
[43:04] decisions but as the parents we have to
[43:07] make that decision an ultimate
[43:14] decision and then at 18 years
[43:18] old when the let's say the man he's
[43:22] ready to
[43:25] go he's ready to take all of his
[43:31] decisions make all of his
[43:34] decisions and it depends on on how we
[43:37] raise our
[43:40] child on how he's going to make those
[43:46] decisions 18 is a very special
[43:51] age brother bam says when he was beyond
[43:53] the current of
[43:55] time
[43:57] and he saw all the young men and all the
[44:00] young women running towards
[44:04] him he said they were about 18 to 20
[44:08] years
[44:11] old that is an eternal
[44:15] age because whenever we go to
[44:19] heaven when we go into
[44:22] eternity we go back into that age of 18
[44:28] so that's an eternal
[44:31] age from 18 to
[44:34] 20 and and brothers that's when the
[44:38] devil will try to attack the young
[44:45] ones they're going to want to make them
[44:48] make wrong
[44:51] decisions it's such an important time in
[44:54] their life
[44:57] brother Bram says Once you turn
[45:01] 21 and you get older and older after
[45:08] 21 that it's harder to come back to the
[45:13] Lord because that young little
[45:18] branch that was Green at one
[45:21] time that was be able to be maneuvered
[45:25] and and and
[45:29] changed now it's it's getting Brown and
[45:32] it's getting steady and its
[45:38] ways to where it's it's harder to turn
[45:42] to the
[45:45] Lord and the older we
[45:48] get the harder we
[45:51] get the harder to go back to the Lord it
[45:54] is
[45:58] the best
[45:59] time to give your heart to the
[46:03] Lord is as a young man and a young
[46:08] woman to give God your
[46:11] youth to receive an experience as a
[46:17] teenager or as a
[46:19] child then God can use
[46:22] you God can grab that little green
[46:25] branch
[46:30] and begin to mold it the way he wants to
[46:32] mold
[46:34] it there there's there's a a way that
[46:38] that people used to mold their
[46:46] trees it was called esing or
[46:52] Esure that that you can get a a uh uh
[46:57] apple tree or orange
[47:01] tree and you can cut it a certain
[47:04] way you can turn the branches a certain
[47:10] way and you can make it a
[47:13] fence you can make shapes with those
[47:19] trees that's what God wants to do with
[47:22] the young
[47:24] people if God can get his hand on a
[47:27] young
[47:30] man on a young
[47:33] woman he will will will shape her in in
[47:36] a such a
[47:40] way that that it'll change
[47:43] families it'll change things around
[47:48] them now we go on and
[47:51] um Satan has a Target on our children
[47:55] all right
[47:59] Satan has always targeted the
[48:05] children we should be very aware of this
[48:08] as parents and look to the shepherd for
[48:11] his
[48:17] help now this next quote on how these
[48:20] last days Satan is using the improper
[48:22] marriages as Major Tool to get the Young
[48:38] people is not this also as it was in the
[48:41] days of
[48:43] Noah it behooves us to open our
[48:47] eyes to see if we are really fortified
[48:51] behind his
[48:54] word are our children fortified behind
[48:57] his
[49:00] word do they know what the word says
[49:02] about these
[49:06] things that is my whole motive and
[49:08] purpose of this
[49:13] book to bring us to the word for the
[49:15] protection of our
[49:21] families brother Bram says in the Third
[49:24] Exodus
[49:26] he says
[49:27] notice the king that new king that
[49:30] raised up that didn't know
[49:35] Joseph that was um that was his first
[49:39] king to destroy the power of Israel what
[49:41] was his first scheme to destroy the
[49:44] power of
[49:50] Israel was with their
[49:53] children is that right he tried to
[49:56] destroy their
[50:00] children now listen
[50:03] close the same
[50:05] Devil in a different form of kingship
[50:08] tried to destroy God's only
[50:15] son see getting rid of the children
[50:20] first before they get a
[50:23] start the devil is um de the Devil is a
[50:27] real smart shrewd
[50:31] bird he knows how to hit the thing
[50:33] before it gets
[50:36] started he knows it
[50:38] see and the only thing you can ever do
[50:41] to beat
[50:44] him is to rely on
[50:47] Christ and humble yourself to let him
[50:50] lead
[50:52] you you'll never do do it any other way
[50:58] your intellectual Powers will never do
[51:02] it you got to believe
[51:06] it and just rely on
[51:09] him he is the
[51:12] shepherd it ain't the Sheep's business
[51:14] to keep the wolf
[51:18] away it's the shepherd's
[51:22] business but the Sheep must stay with
[51:25] the Shepherd in order to stay
[51:30] safe that's my safety
[51:34] zone is in Christ and Christ is the
[51:38] word and that's the safety
[51:42] zone now Brothers I I truly
[51:46] believe that a
[51:48] Christian will make their home a safety
[51:51] zone for their
[51:54] children
[51:56] that's what this place
[51:58] is this place should be a safety
[52:04] zone notice the devil in the form of
[52:06] ramse the
[52:11] king the first thing he done was try try
[52:13] to get rid of the children with the
[52:15] natural
[52:19] death and as soon as the the Son of God
[52:22] was
[52:24] born he moved from
[52:27] Egypt because God destroyed
[52:31] Egypt cursed and it's never come back
[52:36] since then he was in
[52:40] Rome um San moved in his seat to Rome
[52:43] and seat to
[52:46] Rome and at first uh the thing Rome uh
[52:51] did to destroy it
[52:54] all to um the that uh to get to be
[53:01] sure the devil in that Roman system
[53:04] tried to destroy
[53:07] what the Son of God to begin with
[53:12] right the same
[53:14] devil and today he's done the same thing
[53:17] under the sign of the spirit
[53:23] now religious uh professing
[53:28] Christianity and taking our girls and
[53:30] marrying them to Catholic boys and
[53:32] making them bring their children to
[53:35] Catholic to break the power of the other
[53:47] side there's your
[53:49] demon there's your devil Seated on Seven
[53:54] Hills wearing Triple
[53:57] Crowns just as slick and cunning smart
[54:00] intellectual like the
[54:04] serpent the seed of the serpent his
[54:07] children using the same intellectual
[54:13] techniques look what they killed the
[54:16] children in the other two
[54:21] times they they killed the children with
[54:24] what
[54:26] two times now remember watch the two
[54:29] then the
[54:33] three see he killed the children the
[54:36] first two times with natural
[54:41] death and this last
[54:44] time he's getting the children and
[54:46] killing them with a spiritual death
[54:48] marrying and
[54:54] intermarrying
[54:57] the brother says we need to do our best
[54:59] to teach our
[55:03] children and live an example before
[55:07] them so that they will find their place
[55:10] fortified behind the
[55:14] word destruction is all around
[55:19] them let's not be like
[55:22] lot who failed to see the destruction of
[55:25] his children in
[55:29] Sodom I know of too many young people
[55:31] raised in the message
[55:36] homes that are not fortified behind that
[55:39] word and are facing
[55:46] destruction can we not see
[55:48] that standards keep getting lower and
[55:52] God's word is not being taught in our
[55:54] homes
[56:00] the sins and pleasures of this age will
[56:02] destroy our children unless we are like
[56:09] Abraham lift up our eyes and see
[56:14] tomorrow make arrangements for our
[56:16] children as God has warned
[56:22] us brother bam says and by faith
[56:27] Moses he says and if he lets you get to
[56:31] heaven on your Injustice
[56:38] Works he will have to raise up ananas
[56:40] and safaris and give them another
[56:47] opportunity he certainly
[56:49] would but he just ananas saw his money
[56:52] Peter saw Christ
[56:59] lot didn't see the destruction of his
[57:01] children in that
[57:05] place and many of you hold around these
[57:08] old formal Creeds and
[57:13] things you don't see his uh the juvenile
[57:17] delinquency and the destruction of your
[57:22] children you don't see your daughter in
[57:25] a prostitute
[57:28] house you don't see your son a drunkard
[57:31] or in a car table
[57:36] somewhere because she's well watered in
[57:38] sin and is not
[57:43] touched and he didn't see his
[57:47] wife the head of all of the
[57:50] societies turned into a pillar of salt
[57:53] when he was looking
[57:57] he didn't see him escaping only by the
[58:00] edge of his
[58:04] teeth to a city somewhere for his
[58:09] life he didn't see
[58:13] that because he only looked at what what
[58:17] he saw in front of
[58:20] him but Abraham he didn't notice the
[58:24] wellwater
[58:28] land um for he lifted up his eyes and
[58:32] saw the
[58:36] tomorrow he inherit all
[58:42] things amen
[58:45] amen you know another
[58:49] reason that the devil attacks our
[58:53] children is because brother brandham
[58:56] says I'm not going to go to the
[59:00] quote but brother brandham says that
[59:04] that a
[59:06] child that our
[59:08] children they bind our home
[59:12] together that's what a child does for
[59:15] our
[59:17] homes it binds the
[59:21] home and I believe a child or children
[59:27] they're not only the strength of the
[59:30] home but they're the strength of the
[59:34] church that they are the
[59:38] tomorrow Abraham wasn't looking at the
[59:40] well-watered
[59:44] Wells he knew he had to look for
[59:50] tomorrow knowing he had a promised son
[59:53] coming his way
[59:58] and through that promised
[1:00:00] son all of Israel was going to come out
[1:00:03] of that
[1:00:06] child see see we we are holding the the
[1:00:10] children that we
[1:00:13] have we're holding
[1:00:16] people that can possibly change the
[1:00:21] world just just like uh John Wesley
[1:00:25] mother Wesley that that woman she had 17
[1:00:31] kids and brother BR said she still had
[1:00:34] two hours of the
[1:00:37] day to get on her knees and
[1:00:41] pray to make time for the
[1:00:44] Lord knowing that that she was going to
[1:00:48] commit all of those
[1:00:53] children to the Lord
[1:00:56] and in that 17
[1:00:59] children there was a young little
[1:01:03] boy named John Wesley Juan Wesley the
[1:01:07] one of the messengers of the seven
[1:01:09] Church
[1:01:11] ages somebody that was going to change
[1:01:14] and and Change the
[1:01:16] World by the revelation of the
[1:01:20] word same thing with Abraham Lincoln ABR
[1:01:24] Lincoln because of his
[1:01:27] mother standing on the
[1:01:29] word creating an atmosphere in her
[1:01:33] home he was able to be trained up by his
[1:01:39] mother and changed the world and changed
[1:01:42] the
[1:01:44] history of the United
[1:01:46] States but it started in the
[1:01:50] home it started with an
[1:01:53] atmosphere atmosph see see we cannot I
[1:01:57] cannot feed myself on
[1:01:59] just Mondays I mean Sundays Wednesdays
[1:02:02] and
[1:02:06] Fridays and I know the children they
[1:02:09] cannot survive off of
[1:02:12] that they can't just survive off of that
[1:02:17] word they need that word daily in their
[1:02:22] home but Brothers It's it's not a chore
[1:02:25] it's not a
[1:02:27] duty a Christian is to be
[1:02:32] Christlike a Christian is to walk in the
[1:02:35] ways of the
[1:02:38] Lord
[1:02:40] gladly he wants to do
[1:02:43] that it it's it's not something that
[1:02:46] okay this is what we have to do
[1:02:51] now I'm an American I act like an
[1:02:53] American
[1:02:56] Italians they act like
[1:02:59] Italians because that's who they are
[1:03:01] that's where they're
[1:03:04] from but when you receive the Holy
[1:03:07] Ghost you act you are you breathe you
[1:03:11] are
[1:03:14] Christian so everything
[1:03:18] Christian I I I am not only
[1:03:22] responsible but I have have a
[1:03:25] desire to bring up my children the way I
[1:03:31] am and to create a safe
[1:03:35] Zone to create a a holy
[1:03:39] place a Garden of
[1:03:41] Eden brother Bram says whether a child
[1:03:44] or a person uh goes in the wrong way or
[1:03:48] the right
[1:03:53] way
[1:03:54] it all starts in the
[1:03:57] home I realized that the home is the
[1:04:00] Garden of
[1:04:03] Eden because God told Adam and
[1:04:06] Eve said multiply and replenish the
[1:04:11] Earth have
[1:04:13] dominion and they didn't have to go from
[1:04:16] that place to that
[1:04:19] place no they stayed there in the
[1:04:23] throne
[1:04:25] and governed the whole world in that
[1:04:29] place and everything that was came from
[1:04:32] that
[1:04:35] place and and whatever we
[1:04:38] are we are the
[1:04:41] sum of what we were in that
[1:04:46] home as
[1:04:49] children that's where it
[1:04:52] starts I remember when I was around 18
[1:04:55] years
[1:04:58] old I was in a bad
[1:05:01] shape not because of my
[1:05:04] parents because of my
[1:05:07] decisions and I would go out and I would
[1:05:10] just do horrible
[1:05:13] things I'd be hanging out with the wrong
[1:05:16] crowd and whenever I would come
[1:05:19] back now these people that I hung out
[1:05:23] with
[1:05:25] they the way they were
[1:05:28] raised they were raised to hate
[1:05:33] cops they were raised to to kill
[1:05:39] people they were raised to have pride in
[1:05:41] a certain
[1:05:45] color they were raised that
[1:05:48] way they were raised in homes that
[1:05:51] people would do drugs and and blow smoke
[1:05:53] in their face and they were only four
[1:05:55] years
[1:06:03] old that's their
[1:06:07] atmosphere that was their safe
[1:06:10] Zone but me I had a Christian father and
[1:06:15] a Christian
[1:06:18] Mother after doing all those bad things
[1:06:20] with those
[1:06:23] people
[1:06:24] that didn't know any
[1:06:26] better I would go run back to my safe
[1:06:31] Zone I would go and eat a nice warm
[1:06:36] dinner I would go and get ready for
[1:06:41] church what a
[1:06:43] hypocrite what a hypocrite I
[1:06:45] was I would go over there and I would I
[1:06:48] would clean myself up so I didn't smell
[1:06:50] like the drugs I was
[1:06:53] taking
[1:06:56] and my dad told
[1:06:58] me he said you are worse than your
[1:07:04] friends and in my mind I didn't I didn't
[1:07:06] dare to tell
[1:07:09] him but in my mind I said you don't know
[1:07:12] the people I'm
[1:07:15] around these people are
[1:07:18] ruthless these these people don't
[1:07:22] care but I when I gave my heart to the
[1:07:27] Lord when I received the Holy
[1:07:30] Spirit something came over
[1:07:33] me and a revelation hit
[1:07:36] me why my dad told me what he told
[1:07:40] me why am I worse than those
[1:07:44] people because they didn't have a
[1:07:48] choice all they knew was going out and
[1:07:51] being in
[1:07:52] gangs
[1:07:55] all they knew was was to do those bad
[1:08:00] things a lot of them they didn't have
[1:08:04] fathers their mothers were out there in
[1:08:07] the
[1:08:08] world they didn't have a warm dinner in
[1:08:11] front of
[1:08:14] them they didn't have families that
[1:08:16] prayed for
[1:08:18] them and
[1:08:20] me me the
[1:08:22] prodal the one that had
[1:08:25] everything I had the Holy Spirit around
[1:08:27] me every
[1:08:30] Sunday every
[1:08:32] service I was in a safe
[1:08:36] Zone under the token under the Holy
[1:08:40] Spirit but I
[1:08:42] chose to go out
[1:08:45] there and act just like
[1:08:48] them that's why he said you're worse
[1:08:51] than
[1:08:52] them cuz you
[1:08:55] chose you had a
[1:08:57] home full of the holy
[1:09:00] spirit that L the
[1:09:02] Lord that held to the standard of the
[1:09:08] word and I made my
[1:09:11] decision I was old
[1:09:13] enough to make my
[1:09:15] decision and I chose the wrong
[1:09:19] thing and because of that Brothers we
[1:09:23] live with scars every
[1:09:27] day God will heal
[1:09:29] us God will deliver us but brother
[1:09:33] there's
[1:09:34] scars of my own
[1:09:37] doing of things that I have
[1:09:40] done that could have pre been
[1:09:45] prevented if I would have stayed in the
[1:09:47] comfort of the Holy
[1:09:52] Spirit brothers sisters we create that
[1:10:00] atmosphere at
[1:10:02] home whenever whenever the children are
[1:10:06] there oh what a beautiful thing to to
[1:10:09] hear a tape of the
[1:10:13] message to get the children
[1:10:18] excited about a Bible
[1:10:21] character and say my favorite is is
[1:10:26] Solomon well why why is your favorite
[1:10:29] character
[1:10:31] Solomon oh because he chose
[1:10:35] wisdom oh my favorite is
[1:10:39] this why because we are establishing the
[1:10:43] word in our
[1:10:47] homes now I I don't want
[1:10:49] to well I'm going to ask the question
[1:10:52] anyways
[1:10:55] what what have the children been
[1:10:56] studying in Sunday
[1:10:59] school can somebody answer me somebody
[1:11:01] that's not a
[1:11:08] teacher they've been they've been
[1:11:09] studying The Book of
[1:11:12] Proverbs and me as a
[1:11:15] parent I should know
[1:11:18] that I'm
[1:11:20] responsible to know what they're
[1:11:22] learning in the
[1:11:25] there because because if the the the
[1:11:31] teachers they're doing an amazing
[1:11:34] job but they can't teach them the whole
[1:11:39] Bible it should be something that the
[1:11:41] children bring
[1:11:44] home and and me as a
[1:11:48] parent ask what did you
[1:11:51] learn and then continue to teach them on
[1:11:54] that
[1:11:57] subject and help them not just for
[1:12:02] knowledge I don't want them to know no
[1:12:04] know
[1:12:07] things Brothers this is a way of
[1:12:11] life the Book of Proverbs is the way to
[1:12:16] live the most wise man in the
[1:12:21] world because of the Lord Jesus or the
[1:12:26] Lord he he wrote This Book of
[1:12:29] Proverbs and showed us how to live the
[1:12:33] life of a
[1:12:35] Christian now we create that
[1:12:39] atmosphere now um I I would like to
[1:12:42] continue to
[1:12:44] read but but I I just want each and
[1:12:47] every person that has these Green
[1:12:51] books to read this
[1:12:54] to continue to read
[1:12:56] this because it it tell it tells you
[1:12:59] through the
[1:13:02] quotes that we have to keep our children
[1:13:05] around
[1:13:08] us brother Bram said there it's not
[1:13:10] there's not a juvenile delinquency it's
[1:13:12] a parent
[1:13:16] delinquency he says in the uh the
[1:13:19] message that we don't we allow our
[1:13:22] children to go anywhere they want
[1:13:27] want but Brothers we have the authority
[1:13:30] to create the
[1:13:34] boundaries because every
[1:13:38] decision that we make for our
[1:13:41] children comes with great
[1:13:46] responsibility and and as you give them
[1:13:49] that
[1:13:52] responsibility
[1:13:53] they have to be mature
[1:13:56] enough to take that responsibility of
[1:14:02] choice but but Brothers as if you have
[1:14:05] your children at
[1:14:08] home whether they're already over 18
[1:14:11] years
[1:14:13] old create an
[1:14:16] atmosphere brother this message this
[1:14:19] message is for
[1:14:21] me when I read this book I'm
[1:14:26] convicted I say Lord help me to be a
[1:14:29] better
[1:14:31] father Lord help me to be a better
[1:14:35] husband so that I can create an
[1:14:40] atmosphere around the
[1:14:42] word let us stand to our
[1:14:48] feet Heavenly
[1:14:51] Father Lord I just ask ask that you take
[1:14:54] these broken up words
