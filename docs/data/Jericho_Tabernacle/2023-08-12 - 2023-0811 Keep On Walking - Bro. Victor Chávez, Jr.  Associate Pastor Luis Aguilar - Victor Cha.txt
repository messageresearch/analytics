like to thank our pastor for the trust onto myself so I can bring the word of God to you amen first of all if you can open your Bibles Luke chapter 24 24 verse 23. once you have it if you please say Amen [Music] you guys have it yeah and when they found not his body they clean they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which has said he was alive and certain of them which were which were with us went to the support center and found even so as the woman had said but they saw not if then he said unto them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken foreign celebrate oh Grace the Heavenly fathers Lord for your people are here and Lord I believe they came with expectation Lord to hear the word the word that you've brought to us for this day and age and Lord I just ask you Lord please just put me aside Lord may not be me as the man speaking to your people but you using your chosen vessel maybe you through me speaking to your people it says and whatever they may be expecting this morning or whatever they may have made of May their questions be answered tonight according to thy faith and according to thy hearts amen um it's like to say God bless you once more my name is a little different um not song meeting you know and bringing forth the word of God is uh very different so please excuse my names may God manifest himself on this tonight and uh today I just wanted to talk about uh so the title on just keep walking and I came about to this title um it wasn't originally planned I was originally going to speak about something else but God has different plans and I hope that uh God gives me the strength to uh speak to his people tonight we can just go back to the scripture of Luke this time we're going to go to uh chapter 24 but verse 13 this time and this is um this is talking about uh the people who are walking to Emmaus um that God had a I already died for our sins and they were very very conflicted they were very um they were questioning and they were saying they were not sure of themselves but what they didn't know is that God was present there walking with them as well I believe the God is our great um when we need a when we need comfort or we need Assurance God always uses someone sends some sort of signal to uh just calms down a little bit to make sure what we're standing on uh we can just go to verse 13. and behold two of them went the same day to the Village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about three score or long and they walk together of all of these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned Jesus himself Junior and went with them so as you can see um there were they were talking about uh what happened in uh to the Son of God recently is on chapter on verse 15 they said uh they commune together but if you also look they said reason as well and they they were walking enemies and communion together as they were talking together having fellowships sometimes we have a scholarship over here and sometimes I I believe that sometimes we try to reason with God you know you know why God you know why does God do this or God why'd you permit this to happen and I believe that's what was going on here in this verse is and uh verse 13 and it came to pass that while they communed together the reason Jesus himself Junior and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and notice right here on verse 13. he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as we walk and are sad because in verse 17 they asked well what are we talking about they look around and they're saying uh well you know what what's going on here they keep walking and they notice that you know why why are you sad is just keep reading on verse 18. and one of them whose names was claro pass answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known that the things which have come to pass there in these things in these days and he said unto them and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all his people entrances and so here in verse 18 we have a we have a question and uh and chloroplasts use he was he was giving a question is he was he was saying well why are you why are you sad you know and the answer was having you seen that Jesus of Nazareth just died you know the the mighty Prophet is before God and all his people they were asking him if he was if he was new to Jerusalem because it was the big news everyone pretty much knews hey man let's just keep reading and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to The Condemned death and have crucified him investors were we trusted that it had been in which should have redeemed Israel and beside all of this to the day to the day is the third day since these things were done amen as we can see it was the third day that Jesus has been that Jesus was dead but we know what happened in the third day foreign 23 and when they found not his body they were they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which has said that he was alive concerning all the women that uh that made them astonished foreign [Music] of them which were with us went to the support tree and found it even so as the women had said but not but him they saw now foreign and that's when it's that's when uh in verse 25 they said slow and hard to believe and the prophets have spoken yes 26 it tells us what happened it says ought not Christ to have suffered for these things and enter into the glory is and and the beginning at the Moses and all of his prophets he has expounded unto them and to all of his scriptures that uh the things concerning himself is whether they went and he made as though he had but they constrained him saying abide with us for he is towards the evening and the day is far spent and he went to Terry with them and it came to pass that he sat at meet with them and took bread and blessed and bake and gave it to them foreign in so we can see uh for when we first read in verse 13 this is that they were very conflicted in their walk the chaos very uncertain is and sometimes you know sometimes when we're we're in a Christian walk there's a certain Road stops or something's off the road you know but but in verse in verse 15 it said that Jesus himself Drew near and went with him amen so that gives us a certainty of we don't walk alone that Jesus is right here by our side walking Jesus is and when they went um when they continued walking we see that they heard of uh the women that said uh uh that they saw a vision um that they said that Jesus was alive and uh us as humans I believe sometimes you know it's very um it's very surprising or to put it more in a way God tries to test where you're at where your faith is no and uh they went to the tomb foreign and that's when uh that's when in verse 25 they said all fools slow and hard to believe that all the prophets have spoken yes Christ have suffered these things and enter into his glory so he asked them have you not listened to what the prophet says he said do you not think that he had already entered into his glory amen and then continue on the verse that's when you see them uh start to tearing and they started to Fellowship and the Bible says that they broke bread this is [Music] you know sometimes we're nervous system or sometimes you know we you know sometimes we're a little you know a little sad maybe yeah this is sorry or discouraged um you know sometimes you know as uh we walk um there's like I said there's Road stops in the way but like I said there's God that's always by her side holding our hands walking that straight path um and um if I can just uh pull brother random real quick let's just give me a minute in the message um God and his people preached in February 27th but it is every Apple that's in the tree this is in is in the tree when it's spring no more than that is when it's a little bitty Branch sit in the ground every broom every Bloom that ever be in the tree is in that right there is already in the tree the apples already the trees planted in the ground and the only thing that it has to that has to do is drink and when it and when it goes to drink and it has to drink uh more than its portion is it spreads out say expand it pushes amen and sometimes we just got a drink and then you just ask God to receive more from God um and that the way that we're planted in Christ Jesus if you say yes through the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and as we start drinking and the more we drink we just push out it brings out these elements and the gifts of God that has called you out now listen to this the trouble is foreign that's right a CS you don't drink no babies don't you believe that he's an inexhaustible Fountain of Life come to me all ye ends of the world and drinks you see the devil don't care how much you come as long as you don't drink see you gotta come and drink that's what this is about for you to drink and then there's a fountain open flowing freely everywhere just drink till you can't drink no more if if it just drink to what the atonement is why why would it just always it would uh it would still be in drought that's the matter with these Christians they don't drink enough you want to drink till you spread out let somebody else step out on it claim God's promise unto the Lord he will bring it to pass wherever you want Amen brother this is the whole point of coming Services you know God I need amen man I just want to go over one more that's cool one more coin and uh I'll be done this one is uh this one's in Israel and the church uh number three in March it's reached in March 27th of 1953. paragraph 108 and uh brother Brandon's here is talking about uh the children of Israel um that they come out of Egypt when they come out of Egypt and they were in uh between the Red Sea and the mountains and Pharaoh's Army was closing in on him and the people put so much pressure on Moses they were they were asking uh the people were asking Moses to do something amen that uh Moses was uh was stricken and on this uh as a human he was scared and he was crying now oh God please please Lord I'm uh Pharaoh's Army is going to come Senor foreign man paragraph 108 and they had the armors on the girdles they marched out saleron marchando they came out right straight up in uh to the Red Sea and usually and Pharaoh was glad to let them go and when they got up to the Red Sea there they seen the Army come pursuing them and then there was a cramped right there the mountains and the deserts on this side pero's Army coming this way and and the the Red Sea set before them but God's uh path LED them through the Red Sea Dios as long as I know his path is leading that's all I care about just keep on walking Hallelujah take that stick and walk down towards that water amen the power the power of the spoken word and then what's going to happen what's going to happen Lord that's none of your business amen how many years how many tonight are uh are walking from just like to let you know that God's on your side Brothers just keep on walking oh what's going on here no you just keep on walking we'll stay there brother uh brother Branham said one time that a lot of people stay on the fence posts or uh they stay on the on the roadside you know Phoenix uh 239 miles away and the people get off the road and they're like Oh Glory to God Amen you know I'm almost there Phoenix I'm almost to the promised land says don't wait there is easier so you just keep your eyes straight on that goal man amen what have you done to fight for my cause you have those those cars from Battle and they and they're just God putting us in trial it is implemented and that's proof yes that you've been that you've been faithful to God and then you continue walking until you me until you meet them face to face amen what a day and as I close I just want to leave you with this thought all right are you walking with God in this this tonight is are you still walking on singing caminando are you still looking on the signs the pillar fire is the one that's that's leading as the quote that the brother said the quote that said that there was a it was the pillar of fire that led them to the Red Sea it wasn't Moses that led him to the red seat but it was the pillar of fire that led him to the race and they complained to Moses so why do you lead us here today Moses was only following the pillar of fire when the three Hebrew Hebrew children they were only being led by that Pillar of Fire foreign I came with the expectations maybe a lot of us with the expectations I'm ready to sit under the feet please forgive me of Johnny the pillar of fire was the one that brought me here to Phoenix Arizona Phoenix Arizona there was no other man but the pillar of fire and God brought us here and I said God did you brought us here today no it was God that brought us and it's God that's going to lead us yes we know how the people of Israel fellas we just came here to die foreign but it was a pillar of fire that is leading the people you got to keep on walking don't look at the man don't look at Moses look at the pillar of fire look at Jesus Christ it was the pillar of fire that but each and every single one of you to the desert he brought brother Eli to the desert they brought me to the desert every single one of you to the desert did it bring you here today we're going to be all on would you bring us out here I am the god almighty I brought you here and I will bring you out he won't just let us cross that Red Sea foreign but that was my way how I saw it myself because it hurts I came here what do I do now I came here to learn I am your teacher I am the purifier is God your teacher is the word your teacher you've got to keep on walking turn northward we got to have our faith oh Jesus Christ do we have that Pillar of Fire the people of Israel follow that Pillar of Fire they saw the pillar of fires that was God above them when Jesus was here on Earth but now with God in us it's not just God above us with us you see people die and there's times where it says slow down but there's times it says keep going forward you're on the freeway now you're no longer on these little roads time to pick up the velocity foreign and then they get then you go into town and you we have a destination a lot of people don't make it to the destination why because they're going too fast driving too Reckless you're not following God's signs but we have to follow God's signs who is God who is that signal but Abraham says in the message don't stop at the signs going towards that way today is until you receive is we receive that baptism and he's going to do everything he can yeah troubles here siblings because and now you have become an enemy to him but before that we were the devil's friends everything he said we did it we sold we cheated but the moment we walked the opposite direction now we became enemies everything in his race foreign to walk with Christ is an individual individual where God told Abraham he elected Abraham when did he elect Abraham he elected him before the foundation of the world was there something that Abraham did it says there was nothing that Abraham did there was nothing that he said but God just simply elected him he said separate yourself it's an individual walk when something strikes you there's really nothing that can really help anything you gotta just trust in God I believe every single one of us have gone through situations yes there's really nothing that can come to them the ones that make you want to quit you know what I'm talking about the ones that really just hurts you know what that does it brings out Faith don't you notice it only happens when the tough things happen when things just go down you know what I'm talking about when it's just so hard to understand there's not one single text that can comfort you there's not one single text from the pastor that can come from you but you know something deep inside they're very little small voice somewhere deep inside that tells you God is good God is good because thank you God gracias it might not be too strong well the ram says you stand alone salvation it's not a church affairs salvation it's not a church Affairs so be being saved as it involve the church affairs amen amen and that's Christ yes that we're going for the same team we have the same team it doesn't matter who has the ball no important we're in the same team we just want to score a touchdown I don't care who it is [Applause] and that's Christ yes El de Cristo the Bride of Jesus Christo what does your jersey saying the Bride of Jesus Christ or a denomination the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen oh amen amen or if we can only see our jerseys we'll score a lot of touchdowns if you just get that Revelations church is a gathering place where we come in common grounds where do you come to church we

straight to hell and you deserve My Worship does he deserve your worship I believe he deserves but Salvation isn't because you've joined the church it's because you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ unconscious amen when you get out of bed do you start to think they hope my legs work I hope I just get up and I guess now I know we're getting older yeah but we're trusting in the body change when

one side to the other yeah or he was standing in the face of a face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as it could be he was simply unconscious of fear is whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he know it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh I have I prayed through this wonder if I fasted long enough I wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious he believed what God Said was the truth the words must be fulfilled we know what his life was to fulfill them that's right all the trials that are going around you just walk unconscious and what happened when they were talking about those things Jesus when you speak about Jesus you're talking about his words called life you see the sun is if you keep talking about my trial means I can't make it anymore you know what you call you call you bring him with you but when you have faith you're unconscious you
