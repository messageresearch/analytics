Lucas Verso mm-hmm but I'll tell you the truth there'll be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God but Oz and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to prayers and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistening [Music] and behold their talk with him two men which were Moses and Elias yes who appeared in glory and spake of his disease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem is but Peter and I that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him Gloria De Jesus if I could pause in the reading just a moment I want you to remember that the prophet of God taught us that Peter James and John get better of one he had Kobo of course was the church the scripture teaches us that is they were the the church the disciples that followed Jesus faith hope and charity but here in this most important event the church was asleep [Music] again we remember in the Garden of Gethsemane one of the most important times the church was asleep so let's be sure that we're awake tonight verse 33 and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias not knowing what he said is Wally while he does speak there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the clouds and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son here he is and when the voice was passed Jesus was found alone and they kept it closed and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen Jesus let's pray Heavenly Father Celestia may you Open the Eyes of our understanding tonight and may we hear your voice Grant this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated the Lord now this is quite a subject and I'm not going to try to to preach exactly on this tonight but we'll just weave in a few thoughts perhaps and for some reason my glasses seem to be a little blurry tonight so I can't really visualize everybody as brother as brother uh Steve been recognized by the Robinson Steve Robinson have you been recognized already and then the speaker tomorrow night is that brother Ron with you yeah brother Ryan is supposed to minister tomorrow night and so I'll save my little preaching message till Sunday morning I think they asked me to minister Sunday morning I'll try the testimony testified it's been a while and um how many people will give me 30 minutes raise your hands 30 hour two hours three hours we had all these up we can preach all night if the Holy Spirit would move in our midst in a very special way how many would be willing to stay all night we want the will of the Lord amen and uh now the pastor didn't give me any limited and reminds me one time I was ministering actually it was my own sister's memorial service it was kind of hot and the meeting was outside in a Park [Music] so I told them if I start if I was to speak too long they could pull my coattails but I had pulled my coat off and left it in the Carmen [Laughter] so maybe these brothers back here can pull myself Hermanos if I get warmed up too much I'll just pull it off and hand it to him very good spirit here tonight I felt a very welcome Spirit the first and the only time that I visited previous to this amen so keep that good warm welcome spirit is if somebody tries to draw a circle and draw you out bigger circles you know little bitty children can only draw little bitty circles but the more mature you get it so as old as I am ought to be able to draw big circles okay so and then The Minister's meeting tomorrow so did you announce that um where's the location of that anyways okay and that's tomorrow how many ministers do we have president one two three four five six seven eight nineteen nineteen oh man we got a whole bunch of them all right so I know brother Steve has invited you to the ministry and he was telling me since uh we've been having the ministers meetings over here he's got an awesome 40 different um comments about how there's a greater Unity among the churches certainly the way it should be yes uh in the message entitled discernment of spirit the prophet of God said that any person who has the spirit of God will have the action of God and the action of God never breaks us up the action of God brings love one another amen foreign now we have some different quotations that we'll share and kind of weave it in tonight Lord willing difference but again I want to kind of go on the leading of the pasture he asked when I had come into the message and if I ask for a show of hands how many of you are in the message we'd probably get a majority of him but the real question is the message is the message and we must come to that place to where that we have an ear to hear and we must come to this milk Transfiguration experience the prophet of God said Lord bring us to this Mount Transfiguration experience and he said a mouth Transfiguration experience doesn't glorify Peter James it didn't glorify or magnify magnifico Moses and Elijah are Moises even though they were in their Glory but he said hear ye him it glorifies the Lord Jesus only glorification Jesus so we're here tonight not to glorify by any man because glorify any church but we're here to see Jesus and I um first heard of the message in 1966 when I was just 12 years old I had been baptized by a woman preacher in title's Father Son and Holy ghosts I had enough of an experience to stand up and testify and say that I was saved experience and that was quite a challenge because my girlfriend was present that night in the meeting yes I was only about 13 years old but I had a little girlfriend you know and but I I thought what's she going to think you know if I stand up and testified but I finally mustered up enough nerve to say I thank God for saving me by the time I was 15 years old I was out in the world and it was only by the grace of God that he kept me from fornication or adultery foreign Cherokee Indian in part Irish siendo party Indio if there was a sin I thought it would be a sin is to say cathrop to give up in a fight if somebody's fighting you see see that and they're really giving you a phrase but we had too much pride pero Nosotros it was a sin to say calf rope foreign so I would fight at the drop of the hat and this is just High tempered and but you know God took all that out of me when I was now this honest confession good for the soul I don't like to have to say this but um I was drinking and smoking doing just about anything that I was big enough to do and one of my older brothers had a nervous breakdown and he did that because his wife had played the Harlot is I already had three little boys at that time and his father-in-law was pretty up in the aircraft building business in Wichita Kansas [Music] even though I had already been to Washington State the far Northwest and around in different parts of the country yeah a Washington state Jesus lugares he asked me to come from Arkansas up to Wichita and represent the family there my brother and my brother was in the Saint Francis mental hospital in Wichita Kansas at that time in Wichita Kansas he's gone on to be with the Lord at this time but at that time he was so mixed up that he thought he had to sacrifice his own son as Abraham offered up Isaac is it wasn't my brother anymore he had a nervous breakdown he was really mentally upset so it throwed me into desperation to start reading the Bible for myself and out of a burden for him I began to pray I told Brother Fabio a brother uh otabio today it's not what you know it's who you know noise and so he got me on working for Learjet Corporation is even though I didn't even have a high school education the the high school and so I qualified as a sealer while I was working for that aircraft company but it was during that time that I felt the presence of the Lord first time in my life and the Lord began to deal with me yes I had bought a whole carton of Winston cigarettes on top of the refrigerator and within two weeks I was totally quit smoking no more drinking [Music] and previous to this point of time I'd been watching these old adulterous movies on the television is [Music] I remember one of the programs was called Peyton Place or something place and then I started reading my Bible now during this time I'm living with my sister-in-law and her three little boys is and she's evaluating me also yes and so she went and talked to my brother's psychiatrist and he said it's probably genetic you know establish he probably needs to be up here in the hospital also I wasn't the same person anymore amen something happened where I used to fight then I I can turn the other cheek now and then when I left Wichita Kansas to go back to Northwest Arkansas we stopped in Claremore Oklahoma paramo Sinclair Oklahoma that's near Tulsa is and a lady gave me a book entitled a man sent from God that was in 1964. the first exposure to the message but really that book doesn't really Place brother Branham in the scriptures so much and then after coming out of the well at the age of 18 I was drafted into the army and then after coming out of the army it was in 1967 it is speaking mostly in Arkansas Oklahoma and Missouri independent church in Arkansas Oklahoma Missouri and mostly trinitarian churches and then when I seen water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] and I began to say that God was one person instead of three different persons I become a false prophet to all the trinitarians but at that time also I'd heard two or three of brother branham's tapes and I believe it was 1968 that I first heard brother Junior Jackson many of you have heard brother Branham speak of brother Jackson muchos used he was preaching over in Oklahoma a message entitled royalty introduced um and he began to show in the scriptures how that Jesus Christ was indeed royalty says and how that he never changes Isaiah 3 6 I'm God and I change not he said he's not Isaiah Malachi 3 6 malakias treses I'm God and I change not no Cambio Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jehovah the Old Testament none other than Jesus Christ royalty must be introduced and he was showing how that John the Baptist fulfilled Malachi 3 even According To Jesus Christ to introduce the Messiah also Isaiah 40 the voice of one crying in the wilderness John's Ministry introducing the Messiah and how it was scriptural that's that's sure that's right in the Bible again to show how that he has to have an introduction in his second advantage and it's in the scripture yes Malachi IV malachias cuatro Luke 17 30. Lucas the associated Revelations 10 Revelation all these scriptures although I'd heard a few tapes from Brother Branham first time I really seen him as a scriptural vindicating problems I've been foretold right here in the Bible so that was 1968. I've never been the same since I thank God for brother Junior Jackson I trust we'll be able to spend eternity together but also on tape you'll find where brother Graham said brother Jackson disagrees with me Junior that's brother Jackson's problems and so where brother Jackson disagreed with brother Branham president I stayed with brother Brandon amen and where you disagree with brother Branham even those days I'm going to stay with brother Brown now we had we've had both the Old and New Testament for many years but today we have the Divine interpretations and so let's stay with the Vindicated message of the hour [Music] and we'll comment a little bit more about that later God willing back to my testimony after leaving Wichita Kansas um uh was fellowshipping and a little independent Pentecostal Church in Northwest Arkansas is and I thought I fell in love with the pastor's daughter I was really inflatuated she could sing like an angel she'd come to the Altar and speak in tongues I thought surely I I found my control I'm missing rib foreign and the war was hot in Vietnam at that time in Vietnam and the draft was mandatory he is we talked about marriage but we wasn't engaged but I knew that she was willing to marry me if we decided to get married Lord should I get married or not now remember I'm I'm due to be drafted at this time and when I saw the Lord he gave me this scripture right here it's found in Deuteronomy 24 5. when a man had taken a new wife he shall not go out to war neither shall he be charged with any business but he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken foreign and so I said well at least the Lord don't want me to get married right now but I didn't give up that didn't take away my infatuation for this young lady and so when I was drafted into the military El Nido she had gotten married yes because she had got expecting out of wedlock and it was a shot young wedding what we call a shotgun wedding [Music] and so by the time I came back she was available but her mother really wanted us to get married now here's the here's the really the truth of the thing regardless of all that I still have this feeling for her [Music] I knew it wasn't God's programs even though I at that particular point in time I had not recognized the message yet I knew enough about the word of God to know that was not the will of God and when I found out the details of how she became expecting and so foreign I made a vow to almighty god um in my heart and I testified to it I'm not getting married period when I seen how close I had come to getting the wrong girl when the job Vehicles now even at this point in time I was I would wake at two or three o'clock in the morning thinking about this same girl it took God to deliver me from that infatuation or that feeling that I had toward her adios but when I come to realize how near I had come to marrying the wrong girl this is when I made that vowel and I I knew the importance of especially when you make a vow to God it's life and death and I said Lord God I'm not getting married period unless or until osta you speak to me in an audible voice and reveal to me that that's the one I'm supposed to marry is now that's quite a challenge and there was many times after that I I wished I hadn't made that vowel much yeah yeah but I kept the vowel and the vowel kept me yeah it kept me out of a lot of trouble muchos problems because I'm a young evangelist you know foreign in Miracle Valley Arizona when I let that was in 67 68. probably 69 when I came to first time to Arizona and I remember coming here oh my oh Baja I brought my dad because he wanted brother Allen to pray for him and I was driving an old about a 1960 model Chevrolet swiftwing car Joe you said um but it had been turned into a pickup so it looked like one of these Rancheros Rancheros and it was all beat up and ugly looking you know is everybody else was driving you know cars but during that meeting I got under that anointing and I actually vowed to give several thousand dollars to that man is respects to brother Allen but when he passed on I was delivered from that foreign [Laughter] that happened just before I recognized the message okay but when I left here I went back and laid hands on a Cadillac Cadillac oh it was a beautiful car hello two-door push button windows puertas and by faith I claimed that car it belonged to my brother-in-law and he gave it to me I didn't tell him I'd laid the hands on it but he ended up giving me that card and after being out here at Miracle Valley I started wearing all these pink colored shirts you know like they were Emperors back in those days you know that was popular bright colors brilliantes and uh I thought I was really you know some of the girls thought I was too loud especially when I was driving in this Cadillac a swift Wing is white and kind of uh kind of a blue white and blue [Music] yes and here I am unmarried and I put these what they call Hollywood woodpecker pipes on it Hollywood woodpeckers so even though I'm serving the lord I'm under this wrong influence this is well when I recognize the message then and begin preaching the message in 67 1967.68 1960. well I I had to go to Jeffersonville I want to meet the family so um uh I went and stayed two or three weeks in radiant Jefferson be on the low Motel there if we if I think it was called Riverview hotel Riverview got to meet the family and visited the church and so forth and I want to try to condense now and I believe it was 1973 70 either 72 or 73. while I was visiting there at the Tabernacle visitable a young lady was introduced to me and I'll have to say it wasn't exactly love at first sight is but um her father was under brother John Martin's influence how many of you remember brother John Martin brother John and brother Earl Emmanuel and um so her dad was Charles Ray Davis Ray Davis living there in Southern Michigan and we wrote one or two letters to each other but I was afraid to get too close to her because and I even went and ministered in their home they would have meetings in their homes and so as I watched her spirit I I was really impressed because she's very quiet but this time she had had an experience with the Lord herself and so then as Brother Davis was Minister now I must weave this in all right um in those days I was one of the very youngest ministers in the message today I'm one of the oldest but brother uh I was living in Oklahoma at that time in Oklahoma uh Bartlesville Bartersville and brother um oh the brother a brother from Macon Georgia brother uh Palmer Palmer brother Jack Palmer El manude Jack Palmer asked me to come over and minister in in Macon and he took me right into his home and you know he'd he'd been to uh he knew brother Branham and been to several of the services and after ministering there for tertiary Services he took me about five hours further east over to Columbia South Carolina and they're administered at the church where brother Ned Iverson was the pastor is and not too long after that he resigned the church [Music] and they asked me to come back and Pastor the church I said I I can't do it like that exactly but I said I'll come and Minister for you for a few months and then we'll give you opportunity to vote Ministries they voted about 99 that I should stay in pasture so I pastored since 1973. but I didn't know at that time that it was a church that brother Branham had been instrumental in established [Music] a brother in our church there at that time had to ask brother Branham um should we start a church and he said get a building and follow the leadership of the lord well I had been it was 1975. I had already been pastoring two years Brother Davis had come down to minister for us and brought my potential wife so I had the opportunity to talk to her a little bit and to say and I said I've got to tell her about this about and [Music] um we got a loan where we have a little privacy I told her about the vowel is that way she could kind of understand why I was we was a little bit I was distant from her yes and I said now you wouldn't want it and I wouldn't want it either if it wasn't God's will I said but now if if God would show me that you was the one would you marry me she said probably I said probably I was hoping for a more positive responses but I'm getting her committed and I'm still not committed so I could understand why she said probably but we didn't get engaged with that for sure okay no well I began praying because I knew there was this feeling in my heart for her well there was something special between us and I said you pray I'll pray and I was living in the back of the church at that time the address of the church was on Pope Street they said well you all must be Catholic your own Pope street I said yeah we're the original Catholics but I was living in the back of the church on Pope Street and at that particular time in particular I had gotten about 300 old reel-to-reel tapes from Brother tapes which kind seed s-e-e-d that's e-s-e seed like Abraham seeds at that time we felt like that was the main seed of the message you know the most important message is 300 of them is so I had a library in the church with all of these real-to-real types and one of the old Elders there in South Carolina that I used to fish with a lot you know the Los Angeles he really believed the message but he died and his wife didn't seem to have a revelation of the message so she gave me all 90 of his tapes so now I've got almost 400 takes and so I start listening to these new tapes and the first one that I listened to is secret sudden catch away of the church I think I've got the quote here is and I want you to see the quote here in a moment but in the meanwhile pero mientratanto I had a dream and in the dream all that was in the Bible was Cheryl her first name is and I could have interpreted that and say oh we go together like the Old and New Testaments but that wasn't my vow the resignation of remiboto was I would have to hear God speak in an audible voice and I'd have to know it was God telling me that I was supposed to marry this girl is you know when a boy falls in love with a girl he's loved A Dream anything and she might do some dreaming too but you have to be careful the prophet of God taught us the very best gift that God could give a man outside of Salvation is a good wife then the very best gift that God could give a woman outside of Salvation is a good husband amen amen and so I'm praying after I told my wife about the vowel I mean my wife to be in those days and she writes me about a five-page letter yes and he said Dear John yeah it was a goodbye letter God will never show you anything about me I'm unworthy to be your wife now she knew the message and she knew that a minister brother Branham said on marriage and divorce a minister is supposed to marry a virgin yes so I got to thinking what maybe she's not a virgin and so I called her up on the phone try to be very modest but cross-examining [Music] she said oh no brother Hughes I've never known another man I'm just I'm just unworthy to be here I was hoping I'd get some kind of an answer on the phone but at the close of our say 30-minute conversations it was the same thing and God will never show you anything about me it was respects that she had for me her respects for God and so here I am now in in the back of this church in the bedroom of the church I'd gotten a new Sony reel to reel tape player um [Music] and I'm setting up in the middle of the bed with my legs crossed and I'm playing this tape yes and I won't pull that quote up if I don't know what number it is maybe it's number one no no no it's not number one it's number two it's it's a one of two one of two okay and it comes from the message the sudden secret going away of the church yes okay I want them to put that on the screen if they can because this is very important and relative to my testimony okay okay now you've probably heard brother Branham speak about this incident many times on different tapes how the young armor uh Rancher's son was going out west to look for a wife [Music] now now I got a pointer here somewhere okay good and that's your side and this is my side okay where's my what's my pointer everybody's still awake you know brother Brown said they haven't recognized The Awakening of the Bride the true bride is awake and this is and here I am playing this tape now and I've been seeking the Lord about this and I hear Brother Branham say this is he said and he told me that you've waited and he worked El dijo and you've labored patient now that's that's the that's not the one I wanted it's record 147. record 147. that's this is part of it but that that's not in the proper order one of two is marked on the on there or who's doing that okay I'll just go back to it here okay yeah I'll just read it from here this just leave that one up if you want to if you don't have the other one listen to this everybody awake now remember those of you who heard that you know he was out there and they all these girls were trying to get him you know this Rick welding is singing with their six shooters and here now brother Branham says just imagine how those girls must have felt when they looked out their window and saw holding hands with that little despised cousin the man that they had tried to vamp with all their big fine frocks and Frills and carrying onions and he said will you marry me oh she said sir I'm not worthy Senor no soy digna that's the real Church feels about it that's the way the real Church feels about it I'm not worthy no soy digna if I could just wash your dishes I turned the tape recorder back I put on rewind I played it again something there huh so I I listened to it about three times you know what he said the fourth time surely you know what he said the fourth time the tapes always say the same thing amen amen you just be sure you're saying the same thing let me be sure I'm saying the same thing Lord are you are you talking to me okay and I had just oh how important it is to feed on those tapes how important it is because just a few days before that I had heard the prophet of God say this I am God's voice to you that's number one this is let's put it on the screen okay that first quote was from you know 58 10 12. now listen to this now I'm just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you all right maybe if I offended you by saying that because forgive me but I felt that might have been resented but I am God's voice to you the Lord there's my answer perhaps so I cut off the tape player don't say went into the altar of the church in the auditorium and I asked God and in prayer I said now Lord we can make the Bible say about anything we want um I'm not just hearing what I want to hear is or is this you speaking to me say that exactly Met My Vow it's a Sacramento because I had already asked her if she would marry me she had already said twice once in the letter and once on the telephone universe but I didn't tell anybody I got in my little Jeep in the spring of 1975. yeah I drove to Hardy Arkansas Harley Arkansas where that they were at a camp meeting there at rather Earl Martin's done the Earl Martin is the carpet and I got permission to take her home that night yes and I told her exactly what had happened she talked about the background of her life I talked about the background of my life and then that same night I called her father yes he was not present at that meeting he was in Michigan and when I called him up probably 11 o'clock at night he when I finally got him awake his name his first name was Charles like brother branham's father-in-law first father-in-law come on and since he knew the message I said well brother Charles would you like to step out on the porch I'd like to ask you a question is but he didn't catch the hint so I finally I said well what I'd really I'm asking for is I'd like to could I marry your daughter he said was son he said I don't know of another man in the country that I'd rather have as a son-in-law than you yes he said in fact God already showed me that he was going to be my son okay so I didn't stay for the meeting I went right straight back to South Carolina because I had to minister that Sunday morning I was supposed to announce that their Pastor was going to get married you know but we hadn't set a date yet and so I didn't I didn't announce it and we dismissed the service and we're standing out in front of the church and my song leader said I believe our pastor has an announcement and so then I told them that their Pastor was uh engaged standing right beside me but although a lava meal was Sister Arnett and brother Branham had interpreted several dreams for her yeah she said I could have told you that yes God already showed me that in the dreams but I didn't know anything about that respect but see you can't go by these we've got the word of God we've got to go by the voice of God and that girl that woman Yes somewhere and I often say my wife and my sweetheart is the same job we have nine children together uh I don't have any well I had um six daughters and three sons says he has is and all my daughters are married but I don't have any son-in-laws no son-in-laws they're all sons in Grace so from from that beginning there's 40 42 or 43 of us are going to be gathered together next week for Thanksgiving is and I'm so thankful that all of them are serving the lord except too yes and I want you to remember my youngest daughter and her husband they're not really serving the lord like they should right now I deserve your prayers three of my son-in-laws are ministers in this message and I'm sure thankful that they're all serving the lord and they're all in message churches by the grace of God just a little background seeing I your experience I know each one of you would have a a testimony how the Lord has dealt with you and so forth all right I feel like I shouldn't carry on much longer here tonight I know that brother Ryan is going to be ministering for us tomorrow night and so forth but I'm so thankful that you know God has has revealed to me I've got an absolute that's what I'm trying to say is in all serious could I have just a little bit more time just a little more just five minutes so what time it is oh there it is it's a clock back there somewhere I don't want to take advantage okay just a little bit more Poquito Tomas oh my we've got to share a few of these quotes a few of them here gunas this is so rich is number two I'm just going to read these off because they're having a little trouble getting them on the screen uh Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1953. in the 20 years of research of the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord and many things I find here two things that is now notice this is 1953 brother random makes this statement is and already he has 20 years of research in the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord so that goes back to 33 right 33 43 53. 33 is when the angel of the Lord appeared to him okay he said I find two things love and faith and going through those courses and when love and faith gets married ask what you will and it'll be done for you I've found that to be so ES be not afraid 1960. now I regard you all as my friends Amigos and I do the same thing here tonight I regard you all as my friends and my brothers and sisters and I expect to spend eternity with Amigos and if you disagree with me on my teaching that's perfectly all right but I believe if you'll search your Bible real good you'll find out it's on the marks because first the angel of the Lord came to me and taught it to me then he showed me in the Bible where to find it do we realize what we have received in this hour oh number three Hebrews chapter 3 1957. everyday and he's actually referring back to Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 3 even though this is the Hebrews 3 tape um in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 3 Paul had said how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation Grande if that was taught by the Lord then confirmed by his disciples that we've heard Paul being the same how shall we escape now Paul was saying that to his Hebrew audience and they didn't have tape recorders today like we got here okay but they had scribes who was sitting there taking it down justice Paul was preaching it and that's what it is right here we're getting hit by tape recorders and that's what it is right here yes this look is we're getting it by tape recorders this thumb is and these tapes go around the world see yes show that it's the truth our religion is not in vain absolutely the resurrected Jesus Christ the same thing it's absolutely now we must neglect it is amen I'm just going to refer to this next quotation if there's a question about it I'll be glad to get it to you is brother Branham has been preaching about this male Transfiguration experience and when it comes down to his prayer he said now we we like Peter James and John could say Lord how good it's been to be here and we could say like they said let's build three Tabernacles and put Pastors in each one of themes but you said hear ye him then let us turn from these Moses and Elijah's so this is and pastors and the great man of the Earth because you said now here is the prophet of God saying this in an anointed prayer with the Revelation and the realization that he is the Elijah Prophet is yet he says let us turn yeah from these Great Men of the Earth because you said what are you trying to say brother Hughes I'm trying to point you to the only person that is important not you not me not even brother Branham he was only God's mouthpiece listen to this anointed now I want you to know this is sure I knew that listen to this tape you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgments I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determined to do is I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river is only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things this happens as perfectly as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it just Implement I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew is what I just surrendered myself that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no oh no it was the manifestation of the son of manifestation it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding us you're not feeding on a man his words will fails all right but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man element and we're going to wrap it up tonight by saying this if you haven't fed fully sisters on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it Ramos power hits maybe we could have some music thank you for bearing with me tonight if you haven't fed
