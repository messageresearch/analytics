your scriptures to the book of daniel capitolo cinco versus [Music] you can truly feel a precious atmosphere this morning of reverence amen amen the book of daniel 5 27 [Music] if you come to hear something excellent from brother luis hermano recommendation brother my recommendation is don't listen to what i want to say and then the word that he preaches come straight from the tapes so we just come to be an echo this morning to repeat what the i'd like to thank our pastor for the trust he always gives us to be able to stand behind the pulpit and speak unto the bride this morning we want to continue with our talk is and we'd like to say prayer and action how many of you pray important it's something very important it's like vitamins it's like a recipe of but just like we have our plate of food when we go and have lunch so this morning the scripture tells us we've been weighed in the balances and just like a boxer let me tell you [Music] so we need to watch ourselves in the mirror of the world but if we're not ready or prepared god cannot give us those good things because our hands are occupied with other things amen amen oh imagine grabbing your groceries taking them from the vehicle to the house and your hands are occupied and your wife says here look take this and see if we're wanting something and put ourselves in the balance of that word just like the the the the woman that the lord jesus christ gave a parable uh parables a certain stone uh that's a that's a bracelet a bracket a bracelet and she had 10 spaces in it just like us today but in the times of the east back then they had that bracelet and they had uh ten coins of silver and every one of those coins that means that woman is now staying stained she's an adulteress before her husband before her husband can come home she started to surf she went into her dress in the he and the message in the bible they'll tell you what you need amen let's go to the book of james my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse temptations it's a test right it's a challenge [Applause] it's very tremendous when i see an elderly man elderly sister and they're very calm they're they're so trained everything's falling apart they stay calm one that's spiritually but let patience have her perfect work so you may be perfect nothing says so then the book of daniels anything watching nothing amen amen and another version of the scriptures it says let patients have her perfect results and do a thorough work so that you can be perfect and completely the role so then there come the tests for find us wanting nothing uh detailed meticulous careful elaborado elaborated and accurate anton says so then patience are the texts amen search the scriptures for in them ye think you have eternal life and you will not come to me that you might have life so then they search the scriptures searching for life and they can't find life but it says the scripture is [Music] it's something i think we probably never do the prophet says like this sickness we're paying attention to how powerful prayer is now i want you to observe what the prophet is saying gambia los pecadores it changes sinners into saints it doesn't say their hospital a rehab center no he said and doctors can't why don't we use it three times a day and i've reached my limit the doctor says well if you've got a headache don't take more than two okay because you can have an overdose with prey i wish that man would pray everywhere where do we pray brothers do we only pray here at church do we only pray in the car in out and i'd say let's pray many times we pray without caring who was around was over here to the side or at another table they're laughing who what it doesn't matter let us pray i can't i can't remember the amount of people that would come close to us elders they would draw clothes congratulations you pray without any shame you never see young people praying for food at a restaurant a language that you give off when you raise your hand that's giving to understand you've surrendered so here the lord jesus christ in the book of matthew capitola chapter 26 it says that we have to watch and pray jesus then cometh jesus unto the place called gethsemane and said unto his disciples sit here while i go and pray yonder pedro and he took him and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy entonces then said he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt establish so then when one is praying but let it be your will and he cometh unto his disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour you cannot a purpose why the lord says we need to pray so that we don't enter into temperatures if we begin to pray pray and pray you see a test sanders okay brother branham brother i got close just to hear it i wanted to preach to them the gospels i was already dancing with him [Applause] what does brother johnny say the flesh of the flesh it's the flesh's fault very tremendous phrase for the johnny hughes do you walk watch [Music] let if there's a better healing than that then the bible would have told us that if anyone is afflicted among you afflicted it just says tylenol is no i remember there's no remedy and i feel as though i'm going to die [Music] my father's loss i just don't know what to do and they enter into that and then those spirits they get fed off of them freaking them [Applause] that means they don't want to listen to me right yes i haven't heard brother bernie say that yolo i see them like this it's that they don't want to listen but when their arms are loose they're writing their notes raising their okay your tiger is crazy unanimously lord that demon is going to run because that demon is here he is having training and they talk amongst each other you fought with your wife then don't sing today you fought with him so don't go to church but we can do you have the confidence to go and talk to god sometimes brother can you please pray for me you don't if we're not reconciliations we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more estando reconciliators being reconciled is but very tremendous question the scripture is going to ask from whence comes wars platos and fightings among you [Music] tremendous questions that war with your members he said [Music] [Music] that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whatsoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god now i like what it says in spanish it says souls adulterous yes that is let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth [Music] we amen if our heart condemns us we did something wrong god is greater than our heart no one's perfect i can't make it i can't make it because my heart condemns me there's hope for that sinner there's someone greater than your heart they're condemned i like how it begins because you're about to get that blown forgive toward and if i did something wrong did i stand i had the courage to say forgive me forgive me i did this in the other one if your heart doesn't count is but we want god from him because we keep his commandments and then verse 23 what is the commandment and this is his commandments this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ you've got to believe in him love one another one another is it the prayer that heals me or the faith that heals me the prophet says it's the faith that heals you can pray faith but there's no faith but it's faith what does it profit my brethren that a man say if he have faith and not works can faith save him you give them that things that are profitable needful to the body what does it profit let's say that a couple gets uh draws close to hermano luis uh brother luis uh listen they they fired me from work i don't have any clothes the bills are accumulating we don't have food listen to the tapes [Applause] action brother don't worry about it guys just keep going forward now i've got a grit of that food that prayer into action your thing of faith and if i've got same with faith it is buried son he literally took up offered his son how faith worketh how faith wrought his with his work perfection and by works was his faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled abraham believed you see then how that works that by works a man is justified and just like john west a young man used to it or he's so used to praying he said brothers let's go pray so that this machine can turn on they start to pray lord jesus christ turn on this machine lord and then you open his eyes they touched his grass and he said wait did you put gas in it you see brothers there's prayer got to get into action he wants god to heal us you can't be the same do you have fear [Music] and now it's time for action now it's time for you people with cancer that the doctors rejected now it's the time for you people with heart problems what kind of actions and there was that old man the great goliath [Applause] they were israelites circumcised and they were circumcised and so forth were afraid because these were israelites and they were circumcised afraid to make will he was something's could see the glamour prosperity down in egypt or down in sodom could see the possibilities of a lot lot could see the possibilities of when he looked over to sodom and could maybe become being that he was a hebrew yeah the preachers today seem to want to make their churches like some modernistic lodge of some sort members membership and so on they see the possibilities of maybe becoming of the scriptures forsaking the scriptures when it's laying right before them indicating [Music] [Music] [Applause] is because our faith is [Music] [Music] close your eyes [Music] amen [Music] but right where you are brother just cry to god god may touch your heart [Music] oh hell king jesus oh hell amen [Music] king of kings lord of lords [Music] is [Music] through our [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord of lords yes [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause]
