precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a great privilege to be here and we thank the Lord once again that these doors are open it's good to be home we were out for about two and a half weeks we went out to the West Coast a La Costa Occidental and it was a great privilege to be out there you know sometimes we get used to being in certain areas and when you you go out to see a different place it's good to see something different sometimes we get used to the same thing over and over and with that we don't appreciate what we have so let's go to go out and get some pressure Fresco and come back when you come back you think wow no place like being at home and when you're home you can't wait to get out so something that man just doesn't get uh we're always looking for something else looking for a new city who's Builder is the Lord Jesus Christ we had the great privilege of visiting the brothers in the lighthouse Tabernacle in San Jose we were there August 31st I told Brother Jose Esparza Esparza we will probably be going by there and I called them when we were there and he had the pastor call me he is [Music] asked me to preach he may be okay well I was able to speak for a little while I'm not sure if they have a picture up there when I was speaking is the one that's next next to me his brothers the next picture is the brothers from San Jose the brother in the turquoise color his name is a brother Hugo Salazar he's a pastor there he was a really nice to us and the brothers that were there some of you might recognize them they went to the meetings and they only had good things to say about the meeting and so they sent the greetings we have Fellowship afterwards and we had a pretty long conversations and from there we drove up to North Oregon Oregon and it's it's a beautiful country over there is if you've never been there it's it's really heavily wooded some giant redwoods enormous and some really nice beaches Stones big old rocks in them just beautiful they have some really big huge Rivers it was a pleasure and it was so nice to be there I want to read to you something real quick today's message is John 3 16. John 3 16. it's a very very common scripture it's so common that we hardly even speak about it is a very important scripture John 3 16. sometimes we get used to the easy verses and we don't use them the thing was too easy everyone knows that scripture those of you that go to football games I'm going to watch the football games you might see people holding up John 3 16. or just holding John 3 3. they're trying to tell you something foreign [Music] all salts coming back and the old sailor that lived in the sea born in the sea and he said my good man we're going south he said sir I'm going down to the sea to be inspired oh I want to smell the salty air you say I want to see the great ocean as it whips up it's big wide bring brainy waves and see the reflection of the sky in its Blue Water is I want to see the scream of the seagulls oh I'm sure I'll Be Inspired when I get to the Sea Village I've longed to see the sea foreign a long to see it all my life I've longed to see the sea and the old salt said to him while I was born in it I've sailed the seven seas nothing inspiring about it he was used to it we have some beautiful mountains out here we have some beautiful Cactus I remember the first time driving up to Phoenix we're looking out the front because we were driving at night I believe we're looking for the first saguaro cactus we're all excited when we saw the first Cactus it was something different for us it was something new to us we're excited by seeing that Cactus there's a lot of other Cactus here it's a beautiful desert out here but yeah we get so used to it that we don't realize that it's there okay and that's the way it is for the people that are out by the ocean yes yes they get used to it they get used to that ocean being there but for us who live in the desert seeing water it's a big thing to hear the waves it's a big thing there's something inspiring Inspira and that's the way the scripture should be for us yes it should be inspiring for us we should love that word but in order to love that word we have to read it John 3 16. a very common verse we can probably just say it out loud without even looking up here in your Bible it comes becomes so common to someone that has not read it it's eternal life is John 3 16. if you will please stand let's read John 3 16. I'm sure and most people know it is when I see the youth outside guess what I'm going to ask you what does it say in John 3 16. it is for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him but have everlasting life isn't that great amen the love of God for God so loved the world who's the world everyone for God so loved everyone he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him what must you do what does god require of you to be saved his word you need to believe his words whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life everlasting life how can you obtain everlasting life by believing his word believe in Jesus Christ die for you at Calvary and now you believe him you're baptized you repent of your sins and you start walking at the beginning of a long journey to serve the Lord at the end of the road you've done everything you could foreign [Music] for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved for God said not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be safe you might say well how can I be safe through Jesus Christ there's no other way but through Jesus Christ John 3 18. he that believeth on him is not condemned but he's a Believer not is condemned already but he has not believed because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son if you don't believe in Jesus Christ you're condemned already if you do not believe or you refused Jesus Christ as your personal savior you're condemned already now listen this is for the Youth right John 5 24 John 5 24. merrily merrily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life verily merely I say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from death and to life so we're condemned as from the day we are born we're condemned this is and we need a way out and the only way out that we have launica is Jesus Christ without which we are lost the love of God the love of God John 15 12. this is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you is you have to love your neighbor greater love has no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends [Music] Amigos we are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you miss Amigos so you have to follow God's word you are my friends if you do whatever I command you hencefor I call you not servants for the sermons no it's not what his Lord doth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you yeah you have not chosen me but I have chosen you your fruits should remain that whosoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you it was he shows us by Grace he shows us he's called and by Grace we've listened to his word we have listened to his word and now what shall we do what are we going to do and the message standing in the gap and today he is the only mediator between God and man this is we have been pardoned and forgiven now listen God don't even know we ever sinned our sins were put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered never to be remembered no more we can do not do that ourselves we are finite he is infinito and our finite we can still remember because we're not big enough but he is so great that he even forgets we ever did soon we are sons and daughters in his presence and all things that he was we are he became my sins that I might become his righteousness he become your sins that your you might become his righteousness so God cannot see no sin in you as long as your confession is in Christ foreign let's see what Acts 2 36 says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified for Lord and Christ is now when they heard this they were pricked in the heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do is this is the other scripture that we should know everyone should know this scripture then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and the promise is unto you and your children and all that is for all how far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call says so once you're baptized you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior you have a mate no no there's a man here that tells the brother Brian helmet standing in the Gap so if I'm saved then I can go do anything I want because I'm safe you want to see what brother Brian's response to that is he says that shows you haven't got it in the love of God ever struck your heart tenderness of Jesus Christ you will be so in love with him the world will be dead as your sins that's how you know you have the Holy Spirit not because you could scream speak or in tongues and linguas or whatever it is but with sin becomes dead and you're alive and Jesus Christ oh the love of God how rich and listen to the story I got a couple of stories for you now here in Louisville Kentucky not long ago a minister was talking that there was a young lady in Louisville Kentucky waited a long uh in life to be married so somewhere around her 25 30 years old and she was a fine start Christian girl yeah yeah and there was a Christian man in Louisville that wasn't yeah he hadn't lived such a good life yeah run to dances and Road houses and so forth one day he found pardon for his sins and he became a real Christian is about a year later he fell in love with this young lady and young lady madly fell in love with him and they were married and after they lived together about two years they said that this young lady said to her husband one day she said I suppose that's kind of hard for you just a Christian I've been a Christian since a little girl but for you a young Christian to have to stand all the the wilds and temptations that goes with it after you you've sinned so long and he said well it does become a battle yes I want you to remember one thing that if the enemy does upset you somewhere and you fall and you go back into sin don't stay away from home I want you to come home so you're going to be you're going to find a home the same wife that you married and said I hope or I'll help you to pray back and pray through and get back to God again said I don't want you to stay away look I married you upon the basis not of what you were but I marry you because I loved you yeah [Music] which is no matter what you do I still love you I married you because I loved you uh isn't that something I think God is like that with us is we need to come back to church if you repent of your sins God will forget about them maybe your neighbor won't forget but the one that counts God will forget those sins and you can easily go forward you fall away come back to the Lord foreign and the man that day went to work was her repeating it in a in the place where he was working he said no how could a man do anything wrong against something like that correct when a woman that loves him so much that no matter what he did was willing to come back and thank him again and try it again see it shows now you multiply that by a billion and then you have some idea of what the love of God is I'm lost come back to the Lord as long as you repentance that when a man falls in love with Jesus Christ the things of the world when you think of what he did for you in the light of the scripture not in the light of some emotion but in the light of facts what it is and then there is something happens in you when the new birth comes the sin is dead as midnight [Music] when as long as that light is in you how can Darkness Shine That's What God did to one man who thrown himself in the Gap that could take the promise and Moses being a type of this anti-type that's why Moses stood in the gap for the people immerses Moses stood in the gap for the people the love of God how immense it is how immeasurable and we don't appreciate it as much as we should we start taking it for granted we start thinking well God will forgive me we start taking that for granted there's a song called the love of God it's a tremendous song I'll read it to you since I can't sing it very good the love of God is greater foreign bow down with care God gave his son to win his daring child he reconciled reconciliation and pardon from his sins oh love of God how rich and pure Enrique how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure Los Angeles the Saints and Angels song El cantico de los Santos Angeles and Earthly Thrones and kingdoms fallos when men who here refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains call yamaranas God's love so sure shall still endure all measureless and strong is Redeeming Grace to Adam's race the Saints and Angels song now listen to this could we with ink the ocean feels and the Skies of parchment made where every stock on Earth and every man ascribed by train to write the love of God above would drain the Ocean Drive roll contained the hole the stretch from sky to the sky okay isn't that something I like that last one the last stands over there let me go over that again I think I'm getting late here now if we were all [Music] the whole sky was what to write on and the ocean was filled with ink yeah we will feel the old sky above describing the love of God describing the love of God we can all think about how God has helped us how God has protected us God has blessed us so many things God has done for us a long time just writing everything that God has done blessings of God we take for granted to wake up in the morning is a blessing to lay your head at night to sleep yes take a breath of air tomorrow to be able to see The Wanderers wonders things that God has done for us so many things that we just take for granted there's a quote here I want to talk to you about the that song where brother Brown talks about it they asked them a question and he uh talks about it and at the end he talks about this song I'll start in line 430 of questions and answers on Hebrews number 2 1957 uh October 2nd comments [Music] talking about Jesus Christ God raised him up and sent him to the highest heavens and a name above every name why he would have to look over to see Heaven foreign and the greatest name that ever named in heaven and Earth has to be is bound around him that's what God did to him put him the lowest and God made him the highest there was a there he was from the lowest to the highest he became the lowest foreign he made a way that we can come to someday because I live you live also oh no wonder when man catch that vision there's never been a man could explain it the women try to explain it losing their mind this great song Oh the love of God how rich and pure how Phantom loose and strong one incomprehensively is that last verse so I believe the first verse it is and we with ink the ocean feels and where the skies the parchments May if foreign can never explain the love of God oh it can never be told what he did for us my how could you place one Merit out there it's his grace from beginning to end I was lost and undone and helpless no good in defense nothing about it and he by his grace come and saved us that is that's my Lord that's his love that's his goodness the love of God Amen that song was actually written by a by a man named Frederick a m Lehmann is the whole song is but he only had only written two stanzas the last stanza he got it from that place we just talked about is he wrote that in the early or late 1900s [Music] but they had found that verse or that written in the walls of an insane institution just over maybe 300 years ago okay foreign [Music] [Music] snap over finger she couldn't have anything she wants but you know what amen she had to accept the Lord if she didn't accept the Lord then she's somewhere else that's up to her but I'm just saying that every one of us has a decision to make no matter how little we are how big we are okay we're the foreign and his name wasn't found and he had to go up to the great white Throne judgment but at the great right Throne judgment he found out that he had stalled he might have done a few things that weren't just quite right foreign [Music] to be born again you need to serve the Lord would you please stand up here the love of God how rich and pure unexplainable what the love of God is we are here because we love him he called us we have accepted that call we thank the lord we have something special in our hands yeah the message nowhere else to run please heavenly father almighty God how rich impure is the love of God there's nothing about that there's nothing that we can do that we can say well I got saved because I did this but we're saved because you called us we have listened to your call we have accepted you as our personal savior we were lost just like falling down a deep hole but you reached down and picked us up he saved us from our own sins Lord if there's anyone here that needs to be needs you Lord that has not accepted you as their personal savior [Music] I pray Lord that they will raise up their hands and accept you Lord that they'll go to that baptism and be baptized it is later than we think we don't know how much more time we have here the
