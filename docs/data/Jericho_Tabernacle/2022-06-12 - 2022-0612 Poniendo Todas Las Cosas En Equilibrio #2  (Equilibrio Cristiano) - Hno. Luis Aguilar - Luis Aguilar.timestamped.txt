[52:28] [Music]
[52:33] the second message of putting all things
[52:35] in balance
[52:40] and as a subtitle i want to call it
[52:42] christian balance
[52:44] danielle
[52:50] [Music]
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] in are found wanting hey man
[53:02] just as you are let's power our heads
[53:06] let's draw close to the author of the
[53:08] word
[53:09] celestial our lord heavenly father
[53:28] and father we know that you sent a
[53:30] prophet in these last days
[53:31] [Music]
[53:34] so that he can help us in our lives
[53:37] help every one of us that is here
[53:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[53:50] amen amen
[53:52] brothers you may be seated
[53:54] whenever
[54:06] i'm very grateful with the lord that i
[54:08] have a pastor that's a friend
[54:10] and i can trust him in my man amen
[54:15] we're going to continue with our with
[54:17] our talk
[54:18] that we left off last time
[54:23] which is called putting all things in
[54:25] balance
[54:28] in the book of january we find that
[54:29] there was a prophet
[54:34] that they were taken out or they were
[54:36] kidnapped from their own land
[54:39] and they were taken to babylon
[54:46] he had dreams
[54:50] and
[55:06] or rather he had dreams but he couldn't
[55:08] remember the dreams
[55:12] and he wanted someone to come to him
[55:17] and give him the interpretation of
[55:36] so they would say to him king no one can
[55:38] tell you a dream that you forgot
[55:43] but there was only one prophet there in
[55:44] the land
[55:46] and the word of the lord comes to the
[55:48] prophet amen
[55:53] we're going to go over some definitions
[55:55] that we spoke on last time
[55:58] the word balance
[56:00] is
[56:08] it's an even distribution of weight
[56:10] enabling someone or something to remain
[56:12] upright and steady in a condition like
[56:20] it's a condition in which different
[56:21] elements are equal or in the correct
[56:23] proportions
[56:27] it's the stability of one's mind or
[56:29] feelings
[56:33] now we're going to speak of the words
[56:34] that are synonymous
[56:39] so these are words that can take the
[56:41] place or substitute the word balance
[56:44] which is steadiness
[56:55] now words that are have the opposite
[56:57] meaning equilibrium of the word balance
[57:01] is uneven
[57:02] disunity violence violence
[57:06] disorder confusion confusion
[57:08] disconnection and disconnectedness
[57:14] now just by looking at the definitions
[57:19] in equilibrium so we can see how
[57:21] important it is to put all things in
[57:23] balance
[57:25] because if we ourselves are not in
[57:26] balance
[57:29] then we get very confused
[57:34] last time we saw that the scale is
[57:38] god's word
[57:51] when something
[57:52] comes close to you
[57:56] or something comes in your everyday life
[58:00] he says put it on the scale of the word
[58:04] so we can see if it's something that's
[58:06] from god or no is it or if it's not from
[58:09] god amen amen
[58:14] that's why many times we see that we're
[58:17] missing the target
[58:22] the situation is very confusing
[58:27] because we didn't put those things in
[58:29] the balance of the word
[58:32] let's read a quote from the brought up
[58:33] from the
[58:34] prophet estoya sombrado en este dia
[58:37] preta brandon says i'm astounded in this
[58:39] day
[58:43] christianas and have always been when
[58:45] people profess to be christians economic
[58:51] and then the first little trial comes on
[58:55] for el camino the
[58:57] the prophet says they fall by the
[58:59] wayside
[59:00] so that's very tremendous
[59:12] it's in other words it's not the
[59:14] greatest trial
[59:15] but it's a very little trial enos
[59:19] then we fall by the wayside
[59:23] because we lost our balance
[59:29] when for example when a person gets
[59:30] baptized in the baptismal waters
[59:34] they should then search for the holy
[59:35] ghost
[59:38] because when someone is baptized in
[59:39] waters
[59:42] that person is yet not ready
[1:00:14] he says it goes to show that it was just
[1:00:17] an intellectual conception of christ
[1:00:24] he says that's the reason so many
[1:00:26] doesn't hold out today
[1:00:40] to
[1:00:54] and
[1:01:06] we're accepting the person of christ
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:20] he says justification is what you
[1:01:22] believe
[1:02:12] and you that don't believe that the holy
[1:02:14] ghost is a person
[1:02:17] he is a personal pronoun
[1:02:46] we accept what
[1:03:00] oh i
[1:03:13] you need a personality some
[1:03:15] characteristics
[1:03:21] which are shaping the character
[1:03:26] when we accept the person of the holy
[1:03:27] ghost
[1:03:28] is a personality
[1:03:56] you have
[1:04:10] like the brother
[1:04:20] lord forgive them for they know not what
[1:04:22] they do amen amen
[1:05:06] the water just glides off its skin amen
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:13] we're in this christian walk
[1:05:17] and there's so many things in our
[1:05:18] everyday life in osaka del camino that
[1:05:20] makes us go by the wayside
[1:05:25] and we just want to walk and serve the
[1:05:27] lord
[1:05:29] but then there are things of our lives
[1:05:32] in equilibrium that we don't put them in
[1:05:34] balance
[1:05:48] the last time that i was here
[1:05:50] i told you examinance to examine
[1:05:53] yourselves
[1:05:56] to study your own selves
[1:05:58] how many of you can say amen
[1:06:01] you study me
[1:06:13] and i still don't even know myself
[1:06:33] any any kind of people from any kind of
[1:06:35] life come to this place amen amen
[1:06:39] how is it that we use our time el tiempo
[1:06:41] mesa foreign time does it get at me does
[1:06:44] it get me out of balance tiempo do i
[1:06:47] have time
[1:06:49] the prophet says
[1:06:53] he said jesus had just been turned down
[1:06:55] from a great revival el siempre estaba
[1:06:58] el
[1:07:00] he was always about the father's
[1:07:02] business amen amen
[1:07:06] what is the the father's business
[1:07:11] the prophet says i like that he said
[1:07:12] nosotros
[1:07:25] i foolishly use
[1:07:39] who people were always talking
[1:07:42] he was uh they were always staying
[1:07:44] outside of his house
[1:07:47] and the prophet says i have so much time
[1:07:50] and when i know
[1:07:52] when i say
[1:07:54] i don't
[1:08:19] and the scale was going up and down
[1:08:23] and the doctor tells them billy i don't
[1:08:24] know how you're alive right now
[1:08:30] and the prophet says i myself
[1:08:34] i have so much time
[1:09:43] every time we get a chance to put in a
[1:09:44] plug for jesus
[1:09:46] do
[1:09:59] because time is precious
[1:10:42] to see
[1:11:11] argo pala iglesia to do something for
[1:11:13] the church
[1:11:15] to help the people of the church
[1:11:17] i have so much time
[1:11:19] let me now go to the church
[1:11:22] let me sweep the churches
[1:11:36] because we don't know how to manage our
[1:11:38] time
[1:11:49] so my question is where do you put god
[1:11:57] there's some times that we lose our
[1:11:59] balance because we don't even where to
[1:12:00] place god
[1:12:04] sometimes we don't even know where we
[1:12:06] left him amen
[1:12:49] and he said
[1:12:50] david said
[1:12:55] david said i placed the lord always
[1:12:57] before me
[1:13:00] that i shall not be moved
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:30] carner reposera en esperanza my flesh
[1:13:34] shall rest in hope
[1:13:36] yes sir
[1:13:38] because i know
[1:13:42] he will not leave my soul in hell
[1:13:46] neither will he suffer his holy one to
[1:13:48] see corruption
[1:13:52] so when we ever find ourselves in an
[1:13:54] issue
[1:13:57] the lord will not leave us there in that
[1:13:58] issue
[1:14:04] but what we have to do is place god
[1:14:05] before us
[1:14:08] put him in first place
[1:14:10] because the problems will come
[1:14:23] and sometimes we feel that our problems
[1:14:25] are a living hello
[1:15:08] it feels like a living
[1:15:28] because david said for the lord is
[1:15:30] always before me
[1:15:33] so there is the key no it's not the land
[1:15:35] of me he's before
[1:16:04] if a guy calls you a holy rollerco
[1:16:07] plays god between you and him
[1:16:12] if the wife gets angry with you
[1:16:15] i'll say that part again
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:23] i'll repeat it again so it'd be the
[1:16:25] third time which is perfection
[1:16:29] if the wife gets angry with you
[1:16:32] place
[1:16:46] if the children
[1:16:48] aggravate you
[1:16:54] whatever you do
[1:17:01] if papa and mama gives you a little
[1:17:03] spanking
[1:17:05] and corrects you
[1:17:07] please
[1:17:09] remember
[1:17:12] what god said about that created
[1:17:28] put
[1:17:55] but in third place
[1:18:25] is
[1:18:27] the first stage
[1:18:29] of insanity
[1:18:33] heard that the prophet says
[1:18:37] maybe that's why people say no wonder
[1:18:39] i'm insane
[1:18:41] now there's two kinds of insanity
[1:18:44] one that is of the devil
[1:18:46] and there's another one that is from god
[1:18:49] people that are going crazy
[1:18:52] because
[1:19:06] but then there are people that can also
[1:19:07] have the mind of the devil himself
[1:19:14] temper is the first stage of insanity
[1:19:18] sometimes we're driving to our job
[1:19:34] and
[1:19:43] and the gas is almost costing six
[1:19:45] dollars
[1:19:47] and now your day is
[1:20:02] you begin
[1:20:30] that way you can lose your balance
[1:20:38] sometimes your feelings get hurt
[1:20:41] and sometimes you say
[1:20:44] well no one uh cares about me
[1:20:47] no one worries for me not even me
[1:20:50] no one talks to me
[1:20:52] diablo that's just the devil
[1:20:55] important telling that you don't matter
[1:20:57] to anyone
[1:21:10] in check with the word of god
[1:21:40] in proverbs
[1:21:54] that ruleth his spirit then he that
[1:21:56] taketh the city
[1:22:00] here in proverbs it's telling us
[1:22:04] this is the one that isn't easily
[1:22:05] angered
[1:22:07] it's better
[1:22:14] he says that a man that has muscles so
[1:22:16] big they're about to
[1:22:17] tear off his shirt
[1:22:20] a person that can contain themselves
[1:22:50] i just easily
[1:23:16] is
[1:23:44] is
[1:23:59] because we don't have the mind of
[1:24:00] christmas
[1:24:24] he's better than a person that can take
[1:24:26] over a city
[1:25:23] you have the rifle the bible
[1:25:26] but the message is the scope
[1:25:32] to hit the target
[1:25:34] so you have the bible
[1:25:37] it is
[1:26:34] they
[1:27:42] [Applause]
[1:28:11] his memory would go bad
[1:28:52] then a spirit starts to come
[1:29:21] now this is a question
[1:29:35] if you say to this mountain
[1:29:50] you can have what
[1:30:05] you're getting spiritual amnesia
[1:30:09] now the prophet says
[1:30:12] and he says and you forget
[1:30:16] christian you lose your christian
[1:30:19] balance
[1:30:22] christian we're talking about christian
[1:30:24] balance
[1:30:27] and if you forget
[1:30:31] you lose your christian balance
[1:30:35] now the problems that come in our lives
[1:30:38] in our marriage
[1:30:40] at work
[1:30:42] in our money
[1:30:43] and in our health
[1:30:46] and all the problems
[1:31:27] it will scale things out
[1:31:55] here are the problems
[1:32:08] because we're now knowing and
[1:32:10] recognizing that he will take us out of
[1:32:11] the problem
[1:32:15] god's word is the reason why we're still
[1:32:17] standing
[1:32:18] if it wasn't for god's word
[1:32:21] we would have already tipped over
[1:32:45] that's why the prophet said that so many
[1:32:46] that profess to be christians
[1:32:49] they're now by the wayside
[1:32:52] because they didn't put
[1:33:05] everything will come in its place
[1:33:33] amen
[1:33:34] hey
[1:33:47] because we have spiritual amnesia
[1:33:54] you say that the word is not for me
[1:33:57] it is for you brother
[1:33:58] sister it's for you
[1:34:01] don't deny the word
[1:34:15] the prophet says
[1:34:29] when you begin to
[1:34:31] forget the word
[1:34:33] the prophet says watch out
[1:34:36] you're losing your balance
[1:34:42] that may mean that the disease sign is
[1:34:44] showing on you que tienes algo de
[1:34:47] amnesia es spirituan that you've got
[1:34:49] some spiritual amnesia
[1:34:51] amount of random vision
[1:34:53] spiritual brother branham says in the
[1:34:55] message spiritual amnesia
[1:34:57] in paragraph 41.
[1:35:00] i don't have it on the on the slideshow
[1:35:06] the prophet is a way that we can have uh
[1:35:08] spiritual amnesia escondos
[1:35:11] opinion is when you're in between two
[1:35:14] different opinions
[1:35:19] this is when you're in between two
[1:35:20] different opinions
[1:35:26] he says you're right at the door then of
[1:35:28] receiving spiritual amnesia
[1:35:30] familia do you have the opinion that
[1:35:32] comes from the family
[1:35:34] then the opinion of my brother and then
[1:35:36] from my mother's family
[1:35:40] but now you
[1:36:19] the prophet says when you're in between
[1:36:21] two different opinions
[1:36:36] is
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:16] not long ago there was a great sum of
[1:38:18] money that was given me buchus
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:20] many of you heard about it
[1:38:24] and i refused to look at it
[1:38:28] i could have made all of you happy
[1:38:31] just pick through
[1:38:35] among us
[1:38:40] a million five hundred thousand dollars
[1:38:44] if someone could be rich here on the
[1:38:45] earth
[1:38:47] can be a millionaire
[1:38:49] in my opinion
[1:38:51] william brandon it was william branham
[1:38:55] but he never
[1:39:09] an article of it in the paper
[1:39:12] but i didn't want it
[1:39:15] it isn't money
[1:39:19] this is a man that gets his mind on
[1:39:21] money
[1:39:23] now we're talking about balance
[1:39:26] we have to keep our balance
[1:39:30] and the devil always wants to get us out
[1:39:31] of balance
[1:39:33] and he uses three things
[1:39:36] to get the ministry out of balance
[1:39:51] he's on the outside
[1:40:06] then i'm on the outside
[1:40:09] there are three things
[1:40:12] that i've noticed in reading history
[1:40:17] that wrecks the minister's life
[1:40:20] from the start
[1:40:37] and the next is women yes that's right
[1:40:41] man takes money las mujeres women
[1:40:45] popularity essence
[1:40:48] that's
[1:41:02] so there's three things
[1:41:05] but there are other things
[1:41:07] that go along with it
[1:41:11] but the major the main thing
[1:41:15] but the main thing is when god begins to
[1:41:16] bless a brother
[1:41:19] and gives them something a little more
[1:41:21] than
[1:41:24] or something another to help the people
[1:41:29] then the man begins to think
[1:41:51] how many believe the prophet has the
[1:41:53] correct prescription
[1:41:55] a good doctor
[1:41:58] he examines
[1:42:14] he says you want me to tell you how to
[1:42:16] get up
[1:42:18] he says get down
[1:42:21] get down
[1:42:23] get down el camino has
[1:42:25] he says the way up
[1:42:28] is go down
[1:42:31] he that humbles himself
[1:42:40] he that exhausts himself will be made a
[1:42:42] beast
[1:42:45] so the devil always wants us to get out
[1:42:47] of the way
[1:42:49] to get us out of balance
[1:42:53] but we always have to put god in first
[1:42:54] place
[1:42:59] we have to put god in first place
[1:43:03] if you can please stand we're now
[1:43:04] closing
[1:43:07] now going back to the book of daniel
[1:43:11] the king nebuchadnezzar
[1:43:15] he had dreams
[1:43:21] he says if someone can tell me my dreams
[1:43:22] that i can't even remember
[1:43:25] he says then i will raise him up
[1:43:33] the bible says that king nebuchadnezzar
[1:43:35] gave the name balthasar to uh
[1:43:50] so he gave daniel the name of the god of
[1:43:52] the king
[1:43:55] he made a golden image
[1:43:58] of his god
[1:44:01] who was the god of king nebuchadnezzar
[1:44:46] is
[1:45:56] it
[1:46:10] and they took them
[1:46:20] and the bible smell the bible says that
[1:46:21] they didn't even smell like they were
[1:46:22] burned
[1:46:24] so then the king said
[1:46:44] now that was the beginning of the
[1:46:46] dispensation of the gentiles
[1:46:49] the prophet said it started supernatural
[1:47:43] and he says that the dream that he saw
[1:47:45] there was a very big tree
[1:47:48] in the chapter
[1:48:05] and the animals would rest in the shade
[1:48:06] of the tree
[1:48:09] and then a voice from heaven said
[1:48:14] such in the tree
[1:49:36] [Applause]
[1:49:53] he then went to the mountains
[1:50:05] and he would eat the grass of the beasts
[1:50:06] of the ox of the field
[1:50:51] the weeds from an ocean
[1:50:54] and and he said that his hair grew
[1:50:56] throughout his body
[1:50:58] like the feathers of an ego yes
[1:51:02] and then there was a heart of a beast
[1:51:04] that
[1:51:06] that came in him that was amnesia
[1:51:10] because he forgot he was a king
[1:51:14] he forgot that he was a human being
[1:51:17] and he thought he was an animal
[1:51:32] the king came back to his senses
[1:51:38] and it says at the end of the day
[1:51:42] i never considered lifted my eyes onto
[1:51:43] heaven
[1:51:46] and my understanding
[1:52:01] is an everlasting dominion and his
[1:52:02] kingdom is from generation to generation
[1:52:07] and all the inhabitants of the earth are
[1:52:09] reputed as nothing
[1:52:14] and he doeth according to his will in in
[1:52:16] the army of heaven
[1:52:19] and among the inhabitants of the earth
[1:52:23] now notice nebuchadnezzar's revelations
[1:52:28] and none can stay his hand
[1:52:31] and say unto him
[1:52:35] no one can tell god
[1:52:37] what are you doing
[1:52:39] lord what are you doing
[1:52:41] my problem
[1:52:42] what
[1:53:10] we have
