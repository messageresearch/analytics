[59:51] capitol
[59:53] chapter five
[59:58] this morning i'll be short i'll be
[1:00:00] briefed
[1:00:06] because in my heart i i felt the leading
[1:00:08] to give someone the chance to come to
[1:00:10] the altar
[1:00:40] you have to make it on your own
[1:00:43] on your own
[1:00:46] every one of us this morning
[1:00:51] we're going to be reading second kings
[1:00:53] chapter five
[1:01:20] and it was so when elisha the man of god
[1:01:22] had heard that the king of israel had
[1:01:24] rent his clothes that he sent to the
[1:01:26] king saying
[1:01:27] wherefore has thou rent thy clothes let
[1:01:29] him come now to me and he shall know
[1:01:31] that there is a prophet in israel
[1:01:42] with his horses and with his chariot and
[1:01:43] stood at the door of the house of elijah
[1:01:46] entonces
[1:02:00] and elijah sent a messenger unto him
[1:02:02] saying now play pay close attention he
[1:02:05] says go
[1:02:06] and wash in jordan seven times and thy
[1:02:09] flesh shall come again to thee and thou
[1:02:11] shalt be cleaned
[1:02:18] up once again he said go and wash in
[1:02:22] jordan seven times and thy flesh shall
[1:02:24] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[1:02:26] clean
[1:02:28] let us pray heavenly father

[1:02:38] we are able to prepare things on our own

[1:02:44] but without your help
[1:03:26] we yield ourselves to your will this
[1:03:28] morning
[1:03:38] with that we're signaling that we're
[1:03:39] surrendering to you this morning

[1:03:49] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:03:50] amen amen
[1:03:53] god bless you and you may be seated

[1:04:06] attention
[1:04:08] he says we have
[1:04:37] this will be the second one
[1:04:43] usually i don't continue in a series of
[1:04:44] numbers
[1:04:47] because i just briefed uh quite often
[1:05:09] because the last time that i was here i
[1:05:10] spoke about david and the giant
[1:05:16] and i also spoke about god's numbers
[1:05:33] and then another parenthesis uh the
[1:05:35] spoken word
[1:05:39] that's why i i repeat it what brother
[1:05:41] says
[1:05:43] because that's something that i have in
[1:05:44] my notebook
[1:05:46] the spoken word
[1:06:02] this morning to have faith
[1:06:04] if you have faith no i'm not impossible
[1:06:07] then there's nothing impossible no i'm
[1:06:09] not impossible there's nothing
[1:06:11] impossible
[1:06:15] if you simply manage to have
[1:06:30] documentation that documentation
[1:06:33] and we always carry it with us
[1:06:37] the sisters have their purses
[1:06:40] they always have their purses with them
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:58] faith can take over you no i'm not like
[1:07:03] and there's nothing that you're unable
[1:07:05] to receive
[1:07:08] if we can just simply look to cause
[1:07:26] forever gloria and glory to his name
[1:07:32] there was a general from syria that came
[1:07:35] he was a good man
[1:07:40] and the king of syria he loved him and
[1:07:42] he treasured it
[1:07:46] but he had something in him
[1:07:49] he had leprosy
[1:07:52] but that king he loved him and cherished
[1:08:08] he can
[1:08:21] and he reached the doors where elisha
[1:08:23] lived
[1:08:26] but the king he wrote him a letter
[1:08:30] and then first he sent him to the king
[1:08:31] of israel
[1:08:35] and the king of israel is a bit upset
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:19] i close
[1:09:22] let him come now to me
[1:09:26] let him now come to me
[1:09:30] elisha knew he had authority
[1:09:46] as a u.s ambassador
[1:09:50] then all the power of the u.s backs me
[1:09:52] up
[1:09:55] the decisions that i made the us
[1:09:57] backstage
[1:10:27] we are his ambassadors this morning
[1:10:41] [Applause]

[1:11:01] a man fully surrendered to the will of
[1:11:03] god ask all that also he is powerful
[1:11:08] glory to his name yes bothered also
[1:12:04] that that's the way it is
[1:12:48] and he said to peter

[1:41:05] he said because if it's your wealth
[1:41:13] but late your will be done
[1:41:43] isaac didn't know that it was him

[1:43:25] if the musicians play something soft
[1:43:28] we're here this morning
[1:43:32] giving a chance
[1:43:37] because you gave every one of us a
[1:43:38] chance
[1:43:42] when daniel curry reached the other side
[1:43:46] he got there
[1:43:49] because his life on earth had ended
[1:43:54] and he got to that place
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:44:02] and he asked them who are you what's
[1:44:04] your name dijo soy daniel curry and he
[1:44:06] answered my name is daniel curry
[1:44:09] daniel curry i'm the evangelist daniel
[1:44:12] curry
[1:44:16] and i've led millions of souls to christ
[1:44:21] but now my life on earth has ended
[1:44:25] and now i have nowhere to go
[1:44:28] just think on that
[1:44:30] and says
[1:44:39] well let me check if your name is
[1:44:40] written here
[1:44:43] and after looking for it
[1:44:46] they told daniel curry
[1:44:49] your name is not written there
[1:44:52] no esta
[1:44:54] your name is not written
[1:44:58] ask yourself this morning
[1:45:13] because everyone one day will have their
[1:45:14] final day
[1:45:16] i don't know when
[1:45:18] but it's going to happen
[1:45:22] i don't know the day nor the hour
[1:45:25] but it will happen
[1:45:41] that our name is written
[1:45:56] your
[1:46:04] he says you can make an appeal to the
[1:46:05] great white throne judgment
[1:46:09] so he began to travel for like an hour
[1:46:16] and as he was getting closer the that
[1:46:18] light that was there was getting closer
[1:46:22] and it was shining brighter and as he
[1:46:23] got to that place
[1:46:47] [Applause]
[1:46:50] there was a voice that came from and
[1:46:51] said were you perfect on the earth
[1:46:55] for us that are here think about that
[1:46:59] were you perfect on earth
[1:47:03] and he said no
[1:47:05] second
[1:47:06] pregnant
[1:47:09] the second question were you sincere
[1:47:11] with everyone
[1:47:20] the third question was did you say
[1:47:22] everything truthfully when you were on
[1:47:24] the earth
[1:47:25] no he said no
[1:47:29] it's because he was before a very bright
[1:47:31] light number cuatro and the fourth one
[1:47:34] tomas de algona
[1:47:48] the fourth one is did you take something
[1:47:50] that was something that wasn't yours
[1:47:54] he says yeah most likely i did say uh
[1:47:57] take something away
[1:48:01] and when i was waiting for that light to
[1:48:03] come and annihilate me
[1:48:06] i heard then a sweet voice
[1:48:12] a voice that's sweeter than the voice of
[1:48:13] a mother for her children
[1:48:16] that said father
[1:48:29] that's what i loved
[1:48:44] take all of his sins
[1:48:47] and lay him on my name
[1:48:51] but i want to stand for him now in
[1:48:53] heaven
[1:48:55] that's something that we all want
[1:49:09] brothers you may be seated
