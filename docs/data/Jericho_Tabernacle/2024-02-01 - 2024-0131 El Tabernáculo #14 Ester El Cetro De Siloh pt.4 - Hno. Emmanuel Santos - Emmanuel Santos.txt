bowing your heads we're going to go into prayer heavenly father in this evening through your blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we approach your throne knowing what's inside of our own Hearts is reflecting what's in God's Throne so in that manner and this evening we ask that you help us so we may be able to reflect more of what's in that Throne we ask that as your word is spoken that a peaceful Spirit may come upon us so that your people may be able to accept your word with a warm heart and we ask all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and just as you're standing we're going to be reading two scriptures first one's going to be Genesis [Music] 49:10 and the word reads like this the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people [Music] be and now I want you to notice that it says that unto him shall the Gathering of the people be and when it speaks about Shiloh here it's talking about a person and now in Joshua [Music] 181 and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the Tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them and now in this verse it talks about Shiloh but as a [Music] place you may be seated and we also want to thank the [Music] musicians now once again in the Book of Genesis when it talks about Shiloh it's saying that it's referring the Shiloh as a person not just the person but the one that has a scepter so in all of this it's a king but then in Joshua 181 it speaks about Shiloh as a place and it talks about a place that where the the Tabernacle is assembled so the revelation of both of those scriptures first of all there are some scriptures in the Bible or things in the message that may seem like it's contradicting one another but the Bible says in the New Testament that God has given us the ministry and the spirit of reconciliation so then there is a Reconciliation happening not only in within people but then also within the scriptures so then now speaking about Shiloh Shiloh as a person is a king but when it refers it to a place it's speaking about a tabernacle and this is the Revelation Shiloh is King and priest talking about another king and a priest mc mzc mc and mzc is a spirit a person that came and dwelt in a tabernacle and that Tabernacle Tabernacle was called Jesus but that Tabernacle isn't a place it's a person so then the scriptures seem to be uh contradicting one another talking about Shiloh as a person and as a place but it's referring to as that there will be a place that it will be one person where the spirit of God will dwell in that's why we are human beings but we are also called the temple of God so then Shiloh is both a king and a priest just as mzc was was both King and priest and just as we touched on Friday we were also called to be Kings and Priests and then one of those examples that we showed in the Bible is is Esther so then we're going to go into the Book of Esther uh chapter 2: 7 and because of time I did not include all of the quotes that I really wanted to share but one time brother brandham said that his own mother had a dream about him showing how there was three steps that a person had to take to be able to reach the Gates of Heaven and brother bam says that those are justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Esther also went through those three steps and now in Esther 27 and he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom morai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass that when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the place to the custody of hegi that Esther was brought also unto the King's house to the custody of hegi Keeper of the woman so Esther being taken onto the king's Palace is her justification just as we are called called to come to the kingdom of God our first step would be justification and so then now she's inside of that and now her next step would be to go into sanctification and then we go into verse n and the Maiden pleased them and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her uh her things for purification with such things oh go ahead go ahead with such things uh as belong to her and seven maidens which were meat uh to be given her out of the King's house and he preferred her and her maidens unto the best place of the House of women and then if you notice here in Esther 29 and says that here at this unic he assigned seven women to Esther and now the the parallel to uh sanctification here to the Tabernacle is the holy place so then Esther and her agage of sanctification as the Bible says in the book in in English uh there were certain things that were given unto her and seven maidens for her purification so in other words in her sanctification and so then in the Tabernacle in the Holy place in that uh room of Holiness there is a uh furniture furniture that's called that's the uh um candle Candlestick and it has seven candles seven lights representing the seven Church agents and so then Esther going through sanctification with seven women that helped her showing that the bride goes through those seven uh Church ages for the sanctification and now verse 10 Esther had not showed her people nor her Kindred for Mori had charged her that she should not show it and walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her now when every maid's turn was come to go in to the King aurus after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days their purifications accomplished to Wi 6 months with oil of my and 6 months uh with sweet o odors and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus came ever Maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given to her to go with her out of the house of the women onto the King's house in the evening she went and on the tomorrow she returned into to the second house of the women to the custody of shagas the king uh the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name and so then onto this stage Esther just like every other women they were all virgins and Esther being just like the others they were picked up from where they were at and they were taken to the house of Hai to be purified and then now every woman had the opportunity to go and spend the night with the King and if the King was well pleased with her she he would choose her as uh his Queen so then I want you to notice something there were women that came before Esther and then there were women that stayed even after Esther that did not have the opportunity to go with the King and to spend the night with him because Esther was already chosen to be the queen so then the women that came before Esther they would spend the night with the King but he would not choose them as His Queen and so then they were taken onto a different home which was the house of shazz and the name shazz uh means the king's Chamberlain uh who kept the conab bines he that presses the fleece he that presses the fleece sorry and it also says that he is the shear of wall and what is the importance of this and just like every other priest in the Tabernacle he had to be dressed in a certain manner when he would enter into the presence of God now the name of Shas once once again means that he presses the fleece and Shearer of wall and then in Ezekiel 44:15 but the priest the priest Levites the sons of zadok that kept the charge of My Sanctuary when the the children of Israel went astray from me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood sayith the Lord God they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge and it shall come to pass that when they enter into the gates of the inner Court they shall be clothed with linen garments and no wool shall come upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court and within so then you can even see that God required of the priests themselves that they could not dress themselves with something that had wool now returning back to Esther if a woman went and spend the night with the King but was not chosen to be the queen she was then taken to the house ofgas which means uh uh he that presses the fleece and Shear of wool and brother bam says in the message the church and its condition oh God what a difference it makes I remember when you sheared me once you took my wife my baby my daddy and my brother you sheared me yet in my heart I knew I loved you how you've blessed me how good you've been all that I am all that I could be all that I will ever be it's you God it's you I confess my wrongs I confess all that I've ever done or thought just Shear me off Lord I want to be your lamb not only that Lord but take every person in here this morning every sheep and those who would want to be sheep Shear all of them off this morning Lord put their little feet around the stocks of the Gospel May the Holy Spirit lead them to repentance just now know that they've been indifferent towards God and may He Shear all the indifferences off all of the world and all of the things of the world you share it all off this morning Lord that we can stand cool and quiet before you as Born Again Christians Grant it Lord Now esther she had to reflect what was already there with the King just as I said in the beginning what's within our own heart will reflect what's in the God's throne and so then these virgins that went with the king before Esther they also even amongst them had things of the world and so then the king did not Delight himself with them and so then they were sent to the Shear's house but then when Esther came with the King Esther already came reflecting the the meek Spirit of a lamb and that's why when somebody approaches God the Bible tells us that we should approach with him with faith and faith is an omnipotent power and brother B says that when he talks about Lazarus uh brother B says that his sister had omnipotent faith in God and then there was the omnipotent God in flesh to be able to respond to her request and you as the Bride of Jesus Christ you within yourself have an an omnipotence but as you're approaching God you are reflecting the omnipotence that's already there and so then when you approach unto him he sees himself he sees his own Holiness he sees his own justification he sees his own faith he sees his own Spirit of meekness and gentleness when you approach unto him and that's the reason why Esther was chosen to be the queen because Esther was reflecting what the King was Esther was reflecting what was in that throne and brother B says that whatever person and most likely in Prophet is a reflector of God we don't have our own light we don't have our own Holiness and if if we have some sort of light or any kind of Holiness it's only the Holiness of him because we are only reflecting that which he gave us and that's the reason why those women that at one point they were virgins they had the opportunity to have that position or that special place to be a queen but since they did not reflect what the King was they were then sent to the Shear's house and then applying this to the seven Church agents Esther had seven women in her stage of sanctification and just the same as there is seven Church agents in the Holy place and so then we if you apply this to the message when brother bam speaks about the seven Church ages it's a continuing series and then in the month of n of 1960 of December and if you notice he preaches the message of Ephesus or the Church of Ephesus he begins with the first church age and then the second the third the fourth the fifth the sixth but then he doesn't preach the seventh he goes into a different message which are the 10 virgins and 144,000 now there were women that came before Esther and then Esther came and she was then chosen as the queen and then there were women that stayed after Esther that never had the opportunity that's just the same as there is the foolish virgin the uh wise uh virgin and the 144,000 and so then Esther is representing the the wise virgin The Virgins which then later became concubines is the foolish uh foolish virgins and then the 144,000 are the virgins that never had the opportunity to be the queen and then as I was studying this I first thought that the foolish would be the virgins and the 144,000 were the concubines and I thought well the name is there it's all in the name the foolish uh virgins but the Bible doesn't teach us that if we go to Revelations 14 the first verse and I looked and lo a lamb that stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as a voice of many Waters and as a voice of great Thunder and I heard the voice of Harpers harping with their [Music] Harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the earth and then if you notice here in verse four these are they which were not defiled with women they for they are virgins and so then the wise virgins is Esther and then the foolish virgins which later on became concubines because they still retained within themselves things of the world they were still within the kingdom of this King but they were not the queen just the same as the foolish virgin will have eternal life but will have to go through that Great Tribulation to be able to uh Shear off all of the world that remained with them and then those uh uh 144 that were never able to be a a queen they were a virgin those were the 144,000 and then Esther when she was chosen in Esther 2:15 now when the turn of Esther the daughter of abiel the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come uh was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but will Hagi the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the Wom wom and appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther was taken under the king hurus into the house uh into his house Royal in the 10th month which is the month of tth in the seventh year of his Reign so it was in the 10th month in the sth year 107 and what scripture does it come to mind of 107 in Revelations 107 and brother bam says in the message the Feast of the trumpets notice in Revelations 10127 all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the lady OA church so then we've come to find out that Esther was chosen on the 10th month in the seventh year and then here the Bible tells us that the messenger of the Lea churches will reveal the Mysteries onto the bride the resurrection is a mystery in the book of uh 1 Corinthians 15:49 now remember Esther was already reflecting that which was already on the throne and now notice what it says here and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the heaven cor now this I say Brethren that the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption now as I said your heart if you're a Christian you are currently reflecting what's in God's Throne that's the reason why through faith we can approach unto him but on the day of Resurrection it's not a spiritual approach it is become a physical approach and uh nonetheless you are in need of a body that reflects that which is already in the Throne of God because returning back to Esther Esther had a petition that she wanted to Grant or give unto the king but she couldn't approach the king because he was in his throne and there was a law or decree that was commanded that if anybody would approach that Throne without any invitation they would die because they were not called and they were very indignant and so us approaching the Throne of God in the physical sense we cannot do it with this body because this body is very sinful this body is Unworthy of it and so nonetheless God is going to give us a brand new body that will reflect the Holiness and the justice that it's already there and look death is one of those Powers that's in the devil's Kingdom and then in the Book of Esther we show that amen represents the devil if I had more time I would explain in detail a little bit more of everything but I want to keep myself subject to time R but in the book of uh Romans 5:17 look at how it speaks about uh death it speaks here death as if it were a kingdom for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ so in the spiritual sense you already have access to God's kingdom because you were now born in God's kingdom but then God also has a a literal Kingdom he has a future home and so then for us to physically go into that Kingdom and uh brother bam even says that uh the New Jerusalem is the new uh Kingdom or the holy place and so then for you to be able to live in that Holy place in the New Jerusalem you need a body that it has is able to be in the Holy place and for that reason this body are the outer courts the theophany is the holy place and that glorified body is the holiest of holy and so then when you approach Jesus Christ in the literal Resurrection you will then have a body that will reflect the Holiness that Jesus Christ has right now because if there was somebody that would physically approach Jesus Christ at this moment just the same as it was in the Old Testament when the priest would go into the holiest of holiest and would not confess their sins they would fall dead and so we are also in a body that's of death but being that we are in Grace and then through Grace he redeemed two things our soul and our bodies and so then on the literal Resurrection we are all going to have a body that will reflect the Holiness that will reflect the holy the holiest place which is the literal place of Jesus Christ and look in the in God's throne in the Tabernacle there are certain beings that are called sarapin or cherabin and they have wings they have six wings and brother B says that two of them are to fly and two of them are to cover their face and two of them are are for the covering of the feet and brother Bram says that these beings are holy beings beings that never committed sin but nonetheless they cannot even see God they live in his presence but they have their eyes covered they cannot see God but then when he speaks about us he says that we shall see him because we shall be like him just the same as Jesus Christ he has a theophany and he himself will be in a glorified condition you yourself have a theophany and then you will be in a glorified condition that will reflect his pure Holiness and so then approaching unto him you will no longer have to cover yourself being that you are now just like him in the uh feminine side you yourself are the female omnipotence that was within in God since before the foundation of the earth just the same as Eve was in Adam before Adam was even on Earth and in approaching God being that you are God a child of God reflecting the spirit of God you then yourself will have a body that will reflect the very body that Christ has and then if we read in Isaiah 616 but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord men shall call you the Ministers of your God ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles and in their Glory shall ye boast yourselves and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them they uh that they are the seed which the Lord God hath blessed I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deth himself with ornaments as a bride or orinth herself with her jewels and then uh very quickly in the song of salmon uh chapter 6 verse 8 there are three score queens and four score concubines and the virgins without number so then we find that there's three groups here just the same as we talked about the three groups the 144,000 the foolish version and the wise version and then in verse n my Dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bear her the daughters saw her and blessed her yeah the queens and the concubines and they praised her and then in verse 10 who is she that lookth forth as morning Fair as Moon clear as a sun and terrible as a army with banners and so then when Solomon speaks speaks about his uh wife he says that she is and terrible as an army with banners and then in Revelations 197 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready it says and to her was granted that she should be a raid and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteous of of saints so when it speaks about her it says that she she was clothed and fine linen and then in verse 14 the armies which were in heaven uh clothed and fine linen white and clean were followed him upon white horses so then we can see that in both in the Psalms Song of Solomon when he speaks about the women it speaks about armies as well and that's what Esther was as a queen uh Esther when they had already eliminated Haman she used her power and authority as a queen to be able to help her own people so that they could take a Counterattack against all those that wanted to kill the Jews and just like you you yourself have to take a Counterattack against the devil when he tries to take your loved ones not only are you clothed with fine linen but he also speaks about you as being an army to be able to take forth a counter attack against the uh Hon's Reign which is the devil and so you as a king and priest you reflect that what's already there in the throne so nonetheless then now you can approach and then now you can use your power and authority to be able to uh fight against hmon I'm going to read one more quote here and then we're going to be finishing Esther was clothed in rightousness and that righteousness was already reflecting the scepter of righteousness that which was already in God's throne and so then you're going to have a new body a body of righteousness that will reflect the righteousness that Jesus Christ has and then listen to what brother Bram says here in uh questions and answers and what difference does it make if I'm living here or am I buried out yonder for if I am already paid in the penalty of death I'll be there before any man that's living that's right I say this in second Thessalonians fifth chapter I say this to you in the Commandments of the lord we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not hinder or prevent those that are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first the privilege of those that are dead will come forth first that's how we know that it's at hand see then we uh then we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment twinkling of an eye and shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air so what difference does it make if I died in the time of Noah if I died in the time of Abraham if I died in the time of the Apostles if I died two weeks ago or right now what difference would it make I'll be there in a moment in a twinkling in a twinkling of an eye I'm only resting until that time and then now notice what brother Bram says here in the next quote now the Gathering will be unto the Lord as Jacob in the 49th chapter he said when Shiloh comes and the Gathering will be unto him there there will not be a lawgiver go unto from between them the feet until shallow come speaking of Judah and to him shall the Gathering be now so many people are looking for a church a great group of people to be caught up together a church a denomination some Creed something to be caught up that's not it that's not it at all the Gathering of people when God calls his flock together sonville he may take out two of Jeffersonville those that Indiana two of Indiana those that Kentucky two out of Kentucky those uh those that Mississippi two out of Mississippi that's exactly what he said not them words but he said there will be two in the field that's where there's day that I'll take one and leave one there will be two in bed the other side of the earth is nighttime I'll take one and leave one see the Gathering of people will not be uh not clannish or for group for a group it will be a universal Resurrection gathering together and the Rapture will come the same way let's finish right there if you wouldn't mind standing with me and so then when he's speaking about Shiloh as a place and a person as a king and priest he speaks about how he has redeemed you in both soul and and body and you yourself have the ability to be able to approach God but then in one day on the resurrection you will have a body that will reflect the very righteousness of God that's already in God's Throne that's what the scepter of Shiloh represents let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the service that you permitted us to be in we thank you for the revelation of this message that opens up the book of vure in which very few can understand and it's not that I have that ability but by the grace of God he gives the Revelation so his people be fed so permit us Lord to be just like Esther to pass through all those stages and to be a queen and a priest to be able to intercede for our loved ones and so that one day we could also reunite with you and that body which you have already paid for we thank you for your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may the Lord bless you to God be the glory glor to God be the glory to God be the [Music] glory for the things he has done oh with his blood with his blood he has saved me with his power he has ra me to God be the glory for the
