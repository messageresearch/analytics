tell by how large the crowd was that they hadn't announced me for tonight so I hope it's okay if I acknowledge the other brothers that will be ministering um and I consider it a great honor to be able to minister together with brother Daniel Evans [Music] Daniel Evans the pastor at Tucson Tabernacle and brother Steve Robson Steve Robson Pastor Flagstaff Tabernacle Del Tabernacle Flagstaff and it's special for me because brother Daniel born in Arizona brother Steve born in Arizona myself born in Arizona all pastoring churches in Arizona special services in Phoenix Arizona Phoenix Arizona I think it's a testimony to God's power question and it really makes it for special services so God bless you men of God and just to see the ministers here God bless you bro we rejoice in the testimony and we bring greetings to you from our church Arizona Believers Church just a small church it's a young Church like your church I believe this church began in 2019. just a year later God called us here to start a church and I feel comfortable tonight because a lot of people ask does Phoenix need another church and clearly the answer was yes and I just see the hand of the Lord and raising up men of God and Shepherd in his people by his word and so I wanted to share a statement of brother Branham and he was he was expressing something a conversation he was having with his wife and they were just setting up on top of South mountains overlooking the valley and I share this as my heart he said here's what brings me here even though it's in darkness and the sin that's in the city there are some testimonies of the Lord living statues of Christ down there I come to put my shoulder with them Shine the Light of the gospel evangelo and he says some of those little old Brethren down there on the street corner somewhere he said I come to throw my part with them to shine a light of the unadulterated Gospel of Jesus Christ to the great Metropolitan metropolitan area of the City Phoenix he said I come to put my shoulder with theirs and he said to put my heart with theirs my voice was there and cry out against the darkness and that's why we're here putting our shoulder together with the men of God who have sweated it out and so we're here standing on the shoulders of giants foreign to put my part with theirs and so Arizona Believers Church stand shoulder to shoulder with you not toe-to-toe and eye to eye no uh to proclaim the message [Applause] amen [Applause] if we could turn in our Bibles to Matthew 21 I'm grateful to have the opportunity to minister is my burden tonight is to encourage message Believers is I think that's why we have special services to increase our faith and so I want to preach on a subject that's at the heart of the believer's face and do it in a way that reminds us of what we've gathered around and what has gathered us together Matthew chapter 21 verses 1-11 this is when they drew Nyon to Jerusalem and were come to Bethpage under the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus two disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tide and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say art unto you you shall say the Lord hath needed them and straightway he will he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell you the daughter of Zion Behold thy King cometh unto thee Meek and sin it upon an ass and the cult the fall of an ass is the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass in the cult and put them on their clothes and they set him thereon is and a great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strobbed them in the way and the multitudes that went before that followed Christ saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest Alturas when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee is could we bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father Celestial thank you for the privilege that we have tonight thank you Lord that we can sing praises together thank you for the musicians Lord for the trustees that have done their part for the deacons doing their part for all the labor and effort that's put into moments like this we recognize your grace and being able to have services like this to see so many churches coming together this is a wonderful privilege thank you Lord that we could open this Bible and read these open these things to us now I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you you can be seated well there it is I I preached till my bottle of water runs out and I didn't didn't have a bottle of water so I was about to sing take the name of Jesus with you I was kind of getting used to preaching with the piano I guess I'll do a solo now um if we could read in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 9 quickly my title tonight is attracted to the increase attracted to the increase in Matthew 21 already makes reference to this but it says in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 9. Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion and so we see that when Jesus comes riding into Jerusalem foreign it brings all the critics up the vultures and the Eagles also they come together to find out what's going on some coming for curiosity you're coming to find faults coming to criticize there's all kinds gathered as we said this morning what's on the mountain prophecies being fulfilled so the Fulfillment of Zechariah 9 9. attracted a crowd and it was a mixed group he said they all came to see what was happening and as they're all gathered together they're shouting Hosanna osana and it says all the cities move but it's just a short time afterwards that's the very same people that removed demanded his crucifixion so they could be gathered to a spectacle spectacular they can even get caught up in the movement the very same voices that said crucify him may have been saying Hosanna and so just a few days later they're demanding his crucifixion crucifixion because they did not see the Fulfillment of prophecya they had come to an attraction attraction but they missed the true attraction and whenever God fulfills prophecy it always causes it always draws a crowd but not everyone recognizes why they're gathering in the days of John the Baptista his ministry caused an attraction and he gained the following Bible says that Jerusalem went out to him all Judea went out to him in all the region round about Jordan we're coming to see John beniana he was anointed with the spirit of Elijah he was commissioned to introduce the Messiah and some came to see a wild man others came because they were curious but it attracted multitude and as the multitudes Came John was preaching Juan predicaba John was baptized Juan Bautista but he was also prophesied and he was prophesying that the Messiah was coming and as he was preaching baptizing and he said in John 1 26 and 27. their standeth one among you this is who you don't know he says here it is he says who come in after me you've heard before me yes so he was preaching that there was one coming after him and in John chapter 1 verse 29 says the next day John see if Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god let's taketh away the sin of the world so John is preaching is doing this day after day and it's a tract in a crowd yes the Bible says the next day he sees Jesus coming he says Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world foreign and the sermon what is the attraction attraction whether banham is saying that the crowd is saying We Believe Moses they believe they're prophets he says I can hear John answer back and he quotes Isaiah 40. don't you know this fulfills prophecy this is what John is saying this fulfills prophecies prophecy was being fulfilled and about that time the prophet turned and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction it changed from the prophet Del profeta John was anointed with the spirit of Elijah the spirit of Elijah brings you face to face to the Messiah so he was preaching don't prophesy says the attraction changes it changed from the prophet to the Fulfillment of his prophecies it wasn't just him prophesying was what he was saying was coming was now the attraction attraction now whenever God fulfills his word brother Branham says it's god making history [Music] it always causes an attraction but where God is usually missed is in the change in attraction when the light moves on it's easy for people to live in the glare of another age it's the nature of mankind to always praise God for what he has done looking forward to what he will do I miss what he's doing now they praise him for what he's done and look forward to what he will do they don't recognize what he's doing now they don't really know what he's done and they'll Miss what he's going to do the book of Isaiah the book of malachias prophesied of John the Baptista said there would be a forerunner there would be a messenger before his face and so when John Cameo Juan it changed from the prophets to the fulfillmento it wasn't good enough to believe Isaiah Isaiah 's ideas but once John came one just believe the prophets to receive the Fulfillment of the words God interprets his word by bringing it to pass the manifestation is the Vindication the manifestation is the interpretation and so when God interprets his word by bringing it to pass no matter how much you honor the prophecya you dishonor God when you reject the Fulfillment in Matthew chapter 11 verses 9 to 11 and Matthew Jesus says of John the Baptist Jesus but what went you out to say is a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face we shall prepare thy way before he was more than a prophet because he was the word made flesh the word had specifically prophesied in that Ministry and as the word was being fulfilled the word fulfilled is the word made flesh when the word comes to life that's the interpretation of the words the manifestation of the word is the Vindication when the word is manifested it's fully authenticated so a prophet is Vindicated foreign he was the messenger of the Covenant he was the breach he was the Keystone between law and Grace Brother Brad I'm calling him the Keystone [Music] that stone in the middle of an ark is an arch over in an entryway he was the Keystone holding it together he says what did you go out to see and I say unto you more than a prophet he said he was a bright and Shining Light for a while he was the word made lights so John the Baptist comes as a messenger of the Covenant comes in the bridge Crystal [Music] so John was the messenger of the Covenant in this one element said he was the word manifested the Bible says in Luke 16 16. the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God has preached and every man presseth into it the law and the prophets were until John you said Juan they're in effect until that time John was between the law in the dispensation of Grace John comes in that in between times between law and Grace and so he's going to blend it into the gospel the law and the prophets the kingdom of God there's a change that comes the law was in effect until the moment that Christ is crucified Jerusalem was in effect we were doing perfect brother Emmanuel I'm not pitching a perfect game anymore yeah yeah that one's on me Jerusalem was in effect until that moment but now that Christ is on the ground the old system's done away with bringing a type of that in the day that we're living in yeah because Jesus Christ was being crucified again and so here comes John and sometimes in the transition turn in a corner that is where God is missed because Elijah was blending dispensations one is beginning and John has to stand there out John you can't make your way under the new ones he's got to tie the two together and that's where people are usually lost transition but brother Branham says in modern events May clear by prophecy events the believer can see the word made flesh the others cannot do it the believer can see the word made flesh John chapter 1 verses 4 to 11 in Juan Uno says in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not respondes they weren't able to comprehend him they weren't able to grasp him and it backs up a bit in verse six there was a man sent from God whose name was John it is the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the lights he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that life brother Branham was not that life but he was sent to Bear witness of that life that was the True Light which lighted every man that cometh into the world this is the one that John introduced yesterday John was not the light Juan but he stood in the bridge and he introduced the life that was the true life and in verse 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him came unto his own and his own received the very ones that believed in the said we have our father our fathers the ones that said we have Moses rejected the one that Abraham believed rejected the one that most of Moses prophesied his own received him not the very ones that ought to have received him I know we we like to think of those that rejected him as being the Pharisees maybe the scribes but it was even followers of John Iran Los mismos in John chapter 3 verses 22 to 30. it says after these things came Jesus and his disciples in the land of Judea this is and there he tarried with them and baptized so Jesus ministry is begun and this is Jesus he's baptizing there's followers and some of these followers of Christ had been followers of John Anthony Juan and then the Bible says something very striking and John also was baptized in aeon near the Salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized so Jesus's Ministry has begun and today Jesus and John is still continuing he's still baptized says for John was not yet cast into prison then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying questions just imagine what's taking place Jesus is preaching the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus they're following with Jesus Jesus and John's Ministries continuing you don't see it is he still has his own disciples and these his disciples come to John Jesus and they came under John and said unto him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan all men come to him notice what they're saying John you know the one that you introduced to us he's baptizing and they're taking exception to it yes I had not caught the change in attractions so John answers and says a man can receive nothing except to be given him from Heaven foreign Rejoice of greatly because of the bridegroom's voice yes my joy therefore is fulfilled John's Joy was complete his ministry had been Vindicated his ministry had been authenticated the very one that he said was coming and he said I can rejoice as a friend of the bridegrooms because I hear the bridegroom's voice and thus my joy is complete foreign long after John had introduced the Messiah there were still those who were only following John Aviana Juan and they were having problems with the Messiah and they were using John's quotes about the Messiah see what John said about the Messiah they weren't attracted to the increase something had risen it was a rising of the Messiah something was coming in the manifestation and they knew that John was a man sent from God you knew that John had the truth I knew that John spoke against the corrupt religious system he knew that John had called out the politics they've been attracted to all those parts of his ministry but they had not caught the main attraction principal brother Brandon says in the beginning first one of the New Testament was John the Baptist John stood between law and Graves he said Juan is La Gracia neither was he under the law he was the Forerunner of Jesus Christ of himself that he was born out of Seasons John doesn't come into the Christian dispensation a voice of one crime in the wilderness make a way now please catch this part the first one to introduce the faith for the Christian Church none other than Jesus himself so John introduced the church to Christ is the one that it introduce the faith to the Christian Church it wasn't the Elijah no foreign Christ was the increase I know we can get nervous seconds we start talking about Jesus Christ and the increase of the one yeah and the decrease of the other is but when Christ is the increase it's not at the expense of the Forerunner the decreased does not diminish his ministry the crease of John Juan menguando does not diminish the ministry of Elijah it Vindicated the increases the Vindication the rising is the Vindication you can say what you want about The Messengers you can say what you want about brother Branham but join the vindication there's been increases Jesus could not have been who he was Jesus if John wasn't who he was can you make sense of that if John wasn't the Forerunner then Jesus wasn't the Messiah so to recognize the increase does not do away with that which is decreasing you still have to have that which stands in the breach now Matthew chapter 9 verses 14 to 17. we've already read where the Disciples of John went to John de los disciples and had a problem with the ministry of Jesus Christ maybe felt that he shouldn't be preaching because and John says this is the Vindication of my Ministry my joy is complete he must rise he needs to grow he used to have the preeminence not me no Joe I'm not that Christ I'm not even worthy to unloose the shoes and then in Matthew chapter 9 verse 14. then came to him to Jesus disciples of John Los disciples saying why do we and the Pharisees fast after this but thy disciples notice how they had their own identity we are the followers of Elijah we believe the prophets and we do things a certain way why do we fast a lot but your disciples do not fast and so they're questioning the Vindication of John's Ministries using their own Traditions to questions the Vindication of Elijah's Ministry and Jesus answer [Music] the very one that was and you do not recognize it he says but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from thee this is now in the sermon the voice of the signal brother Branham takes the ministry of John element He says John The Prophet's appearing on Earth after 400 years without a Prophet this was the sign after 400 years of him appearing says that little LAX times he says now if you're spiritual you'll catch what I'm saying this is that he would say things in a roundabout way but that the believer would catch it says if you're spiritual and this is May God open up your understanding he says how long has it been to wake up to what God was doing do not be caught in that cuatro said how long has it been he said 400 years Israel without a prophet churches that got so twisted up and then here come John on the scene Pentecost got all twisted up in just 15 years Humanity had gotten into it and they begin to nominate and everything got all twisted up God had to send a messenger William Branham as the angel messenger of laodice to get to address the churches that are all twisted up John was the prophet Juan El profeta a sign that the Messiah was going to speak after him watch because Malachi 3 said I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way to prepare the people now if I could just make a side comments this is the first time for most of you to hear me preach so I very selfishly decided to preach something that we all believe this is and feel really good about myself and cover the basics the brother Daniel brother Steve have the Liberty to really get into the good stuff and so you just you just get into this with me if you've been waiting to the end of a man be let's just start it now because I'm preaching what's attracted to you I'm affirming your face I'm not correcting I'm not questioning I'm acknowledging tonight the reason why we're here tonight it's because we've heard the voice of the one that smokes after the Forerunner many of us were here in the days of Brothers ministers introduce Jesus Christ foreign and here we are tonight brother bam says look at John no selfishness in him he never took any Glory Gloria they tried to call him the Messiah they do the same thing with brother Branham they try to call him the Messiah but the hypocrisy is their own Messiah said they're antichrists they tried to call him the Messiah but he said I'm not worthy to lose his shoes but as soon as Jesus appeared Jesus like a dove come down a voice saying I'm well pleased and John immediately said he must increase I must decrease he presented the church to Christ El president of the church he stepped back bring together an invisible Union he presented the church to Christ El president we're told that in the last days we'll repeat again the same thing will repeat again he says there's going to be a message come foreign there is going to be a message come forward that'll introduce the Messiah to the people and E it'll be in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded like they did then he promised it so just as they missed the increase in the days of John Del Christmas they were dumbfounded they were confused they rejected the light many continued to follow John and question John question the Messiah says that will repeat again [Music] if I could say this about John's disciples they were distracted by the decrease instead of being attracted to the increase in business they're distracted by the decrease in Acts chapter 19 and it shows if I could say this is in the light of so many efforts to diminish the ministry William Branham in uh we could instinctively try to try to defend it foreign in Acts chapter 19 verses one to three now this is after the institution of the Christian church this is after Christ's return back on the day of Pentecost it says it came to pass that while paulus was at Corinth he said Paul having passed to the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples we've read of these disciples in John chapter 3. we read about him in Matthew chapter 9. different stages in Jesus we see these Disciples of John foreign Santo because you could only get that from Christ he he's the one that introduced the faith to the Christian Church he's the one that had the baptism that John talked about he's the one that held the mystery he's the one that held the king there's certain things that they could only get from Christ and if I could say this in Revelation chapter 10 is the Angel told John to go to the angel that held the book and it's and when John listened to that messenger he said go to the mighty angels and ask for the book but it's the mighty Angel this says take it and eat it it's only when Christ reveals it to hello Children of the life walk in the light and watch more on Full House they hadn't even heard of the Holy ghosts so now he starts to do the the dissecting and to say he said unto them under what then were you baptized he knew they were disciples it had some testimony they had some relationship to the to Christ they were like a cousin primo and so he's approached them as Believers have you received the promise promises to Believers so he's recognizing them as Believers which is how will you baptized then Paul said John barely baptized with the Baptist that they should believe on him which should come after him that is Kiss on Christ Jesus Christ Jesus that's the same message we've heard not that we would believe in William Branham we couldn't believe in him whom he preached that we would believe and these Disciples of John yes they had received they were Believers but they had not been attracted to the increase they didn't even know about the Vindication of John's Ministry of Juan that will repeat again said there will be a message that will introduce in my words the increase but the people will stumble at it and the sermon the world has fallen apart again and Jesus was the anointed word the word made flesh that's the reason he walked out into the water there foreign why did christ go to the Jordan River Jordan because that's where the Prophet was the word comes to the prophet is he was baptized by the propheta but remember in Matthew chapter 3 John said Behold the Lamb of God Juan Diego that takes away the sins of the world but he didn't even understand what he said because when Jesus wants to be baptized he said then the prophet raised up said I must decrease he shall increase we find that that's God's way of doing it but did they receive it they should have known it they should have watched the acts of God they saw the word fulfilled they knew the scripture said what the scripture said about it but they couldn't believe it would come like that [Music] then when he came on the scene he said I must decrease he must increase two of them couldn't stay at the same time John had to go Jesus remains Jesus it's always that way this is what brother Branham taught us that's God's way of doing it now if you look at Matthew Chapter 11 not only am I going to try to preach what you already know I'm gonna try to do it in about an hour and make it even harder on the brothers Matthew chapter 11 math verses two to six now John is in prison and while John's in prison brother I'm talking about his ego I getting filmed over he had prophesied the Messiah Prophet is he had pointed to the Messiah he had affirmed the Vindication of the Messiah he had pointed his disciples back to the Messiah but now John is in prison and he sent two of his disciples he still has his disciples and said unto him or thou he that should come or do we look for another it is these are messengers that John sent and John is wrestling with things and he's questioning things and he wanted his disciples to ask are you the one that was to come after me it is what was supposed to be after my ministers Jesus answered and said to them God show John again those things which you do here and see the blind received their sights the lepers are cleansed Olympians and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he he said who shall ever not be offended in me and me John was offended John didn't fully understand what he was introducing John didn't know what he was even saying he believed he was the Messiah but he had his ideas of what the Messiah was to be foreign John was wrestling with it he had a lot of questions about it you know brother Branham had the same questions John was in prison and he sent these questions and then brother Branham preaches souls in prison now and he has a lot of questions what's going to happen is the door closing I'm not sure what this means I'm not sure what happens next but by the end of that year he knew the Vindication of his ministry he knew what that word was to look away to Jesus there's a man here who can turn on the line Shalom there's a son setting on the church Iglesia so as John was wrestling in prison blessed is he who shall not be offended in me he said brother Brandon called it the Forgotten beatitude [Music] never mind I read the clock wrong I'm going over an hour I think say what the tape says the believer can sit hour after hours you see we're just saying what he said do we have to do what he says and the Forgotten beatitude brother bam says in Avengers Jesus came and showed the Messiah he said Jesus that he was the Messiah but then something went wrong and introduced the Messiah with the fan in his hand going to burn up the chaff think about how John viewed his prophecies how John interpreted his own prophecies but he found out the works of Jesus he was making lowly so it worried him he didn't know what to say he thought now there's something wrong here somewhere Noir these are the thoughts of the prophets these are the thoughts of John is seemed he had believed the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working right what an incredible perception of what John was wrestling now brother Bradham gets Inside the Mind of John all right he says John thought well now I introduced a messiah that had a fan in his hand and he was going to purge the floors and take his week to the corner and I told them the ax was to to be laid to the root of the tree and he's going to take all the trash and burn it up and here he is instead of a Great Mighty Man like that here it comes meek and lowly something must have went wrong somewhere there's no doubt about but something's wrong somewhere he thought it wasn't right so not only did the Disciples of John have a hard time difficult but when the word was being made flesh in Christ even John had a hard time he looked at what he said and compared to what it was he says this isn't what I thought this meant and when his ego I got filmed over he said go and ask him he's the one should we look for another and Jesus's answer is that there's not another there's not an eighth messenger you know the inoculation to another Prophet the inoculation to an eighth messenger gospel is to recognize the one the seventh introduced he became dismayed like many of us do when we see things going on that isn't what we think is just right we become dismayed I want to say to you Believers tonight we should hunger and thirst to see the word Vindicated and not in some great Cathedral somewhere but in the humility and in the Simplicity of a life lived by the word nothing is out of order nothing is wrong let the critics range God's word is coming to pass the message is Alive and Well we should not be dismayed compados but it's only when we get our eyes on the prophet is when we get distracted by the decrease the coming of the Messiah was very simple and unexpected just gauging on how comfortable I can get tonight remember when brother Brandon's preaching the seals she said and he knows he can't say too much he even has it written in his notes you can't go further than this and he finds himself well you know it seems like and he says just keep living simple lives and he says you would think something like this would be revealed out of some great Cathedral somewhere else you think something like this would come to the Vatican commercial come to some great church but the word had to come to the prophet brother random in question and answers on the seal says it this way [Music] they had it all drought up this is what the prophet said this is what it's going to look like this is what John said is to look at he said what's going to look like they had it all drought up he will have a spear that will reach a mile long this is one of those white clouds and just pick up all these Romans just keep doing like that why they had that all fixed up notice how great they thought the manifestation would be in all their traditions and interpretations because then it was a little lamb come moving out amongst them pushed around this way in that way even John said go ask him is he actually the one brother I'm tying this together they had the prophecy all figured out and when it was fulfilled they rejected it when it happened they couldn't receive it because of their traditions because of their imagination because of their mental conception he says it was so humble till that prophet because God hides himself in Simplicity and let me share with you a secret wherever God hides that's where you'll find him if he's hidden Simplicity yeah and it was so humble that even John mistake that will repeat just as John Juan foreign the pattern ever Remains the Same El patronismo but Branham when he's preaching the bridge he connects John's Ministry of Juan with that of the ministry and he's reading in Revelations chapter 5. and the voice in Revelations chapter five says who is worth it open we say the book and loose the seals John said he wasn't even worthy to unloose the shoes of the Messiah so in the first coming in the worthiness of the Lamb part of the mystery being revealed I'm not even worthy to unloose the shoes but now when the Lamb's going to come forward to take the book The question is asked who's worthy to take the book and open it makes the statement Justice John is now brother Branham is looking at the mighty Angels who's coming back down to earth with the book open seventh angel S at the time of this coming up and here in Revelations chapter five the question is who's worth it but then brother Branham takes that phrase and he turns it around says he basically says this way it's not a question but it's an invitation it was well I wonder who's worthy no let him come and brother Branham says maybe I'm the only one feeling this way why did he say this because he's the angel he's the one to whom the word must come maybe I'm the only one feeling this way let him come and take the book and brother bear said and he came from beetle then what is it we're attracted to and Matthew 24 one of the most pronounced scriptures in the ministry brother Branham is Luke 17 in the day when the son of man is revealed we've seen the conditions we see it as it was in the days of Noah foreign did my time stop when the piano stopped I'm trying to I was given a time limit and I want to keep within us that's got everybody thinking right yeah are the pizza and wings ready I'm waiting for Deacon to say yeah in Luke 17 30 it says in the day when the son of man is revealed in the days of Life the days of Noah the gift of discernment those things were signs wanting to win the son of man is revealed manifestation remember Lot's wife and remembers Lord's wife that's not a rebuke to the bride she can never be lot's wife's wife started out as an overcomer he started out of Sodom because of the message but she had to turn around and go back so remember Lot's wife was a prophecy that there will be those Grupo [Music] and the revealing of the son of man in Luke 17 30. it's the same coming of the son Amanda Matthew 24 27. where's the lightning cometh out of the East and shine it even under the West this is also the coming of the son of man because but wheresoever the carcass is what body are you feeding on what body are we feeding us any other body is not going to give you strength to Fly Above denominations markers of denominations [Music] these scriptures are fulfilled where the carcass is where will the Eagles oh we have recognized the increase foreign that's where the Eagles are gathered together brother said that's what the attraction is the predestinated seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow it I'm not following this of my own shoes I'm attracted to it I'm drawn to it as he is being lifted up Prophet identifies Christ this is the revealed word this is the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm magnetized by the glory of it is let me keep my eyes on is we can't do it nothing else but follow it it means more than life to us but don't take that what is the attraction fulfilling his words we have a more sure word of Prophecy not just the prophecies but a more short word prophecy that has been interpreted by coming to pass that's been fully authenticated prophecy that's been [Music] is being spiritually revealed to me the Bible says that as many as were ordained to eternal life that word ordained could have been translated to addicted as many as we're addicted to eternal life when they heard the word of life that's what I want right there that's what I've been looking forward can you identify with it can I just use maybe a little harsh friend he doesn't realize it but you were born a word you were born addicted to this word and the only anything that'll satisfy Jesus Christ is the only thing our anxiety is all because of our distance brother Branham in the sermon God is his own interpreter he said it's not me it's the word promised for this day it's never been since the days of the Apostles it never has been doing things he ain't done for 1900 years but where it was said and just before the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of life unbelievers don't believe it they're not expected to believe it okay but Believers believe it they can't do nothing else but Follow Me Do you believe it it's real real it's alive it's Vindicated we have been attracted to the increase you are the Vindication of the increase you're the one that sneaks after him or his body [Music] I'm so glad that the bride has been loose and we we are attracted to this is let us not be distracted by the decrease the decreases the Vindication of his ministry let's Stand Together God bless you this evening thank you for being so welcoming Elizabeth forgive me if you don't understand my sense of humor is we always say about Phoenix it's a dry heat it's a dry humor yes I trust it's been appropriate for you attracted to the
