[55:46] belthazar
[55:49] una fiesta and this king was having a
[55:51] a party
[55:56] and there was like a hand a finger
[55:58] riding on the wall
[56:13] but there was a woman that knew that
[56:14] there was a prophet on the on the earth
[56:18] and this king said if somebody can give
[56:19] me this instrument
[56:23] i'm going to give them a big gold chain
[56:26] daniela
[56:56] do you know what a
[56:58] scale is
[57:02] it's like a judge it has a it's like
[57:04] it's weighted
[57:06] that's why i placed the image there
[57:09] in
[57:11] in english i have one in english and one
[57:12] in spanish
[57:14] there's like a scale
[57:18] if you go to the left
[57:20] the right side's going to lift up
[57:23] if you go to the right side the left
[57:24] side is sides
[57:27] and we've got to keep them in balance
[57:31] you can't go to one side
[57:34] you can't go to the other side too much
[57:36] amen amen
[57:48] and as the months proceed we're going to
[57:50] enter in deeper into the mess for
[57:51] example
[58:00] the tires must have a certain amount of
[58:01] air pressure
[58:05] let's say one tire
[58:21] the car begins to force itself a little
[58:23] bit more i know
[58:24] have you heard of that
[58:27] when the tires are low in pressure
[58:31] the car
[58:32] has to work a little bit harder
[58:48] so that the car can drive down the road
[58:50] even amen
[58:52] equilibrium we're going to see what the
[58:54] word equilibrium means balance balance
[58:56] i'm sorry
[59:01] equilibrium
[59:11] an in an even distribution of weight
[59:14] enabling someone or something to remain
[59:17] upright and steady
[59:22] it's something for some someone or
[59:23] something
[59:25] to be able to stand upright
[59:28] and steady man
[59:30] but i'm afraid
[59:59] definition the second definition on a
[1:00:01] condition
[1:00:08] a condition in which different elements
[1:00:10] are equal or in the correct proportion
[1:00:14] now notice the third definition
[1:00:20] stability of one's mind or feelings
[1:00:26] this morning i'd like for you guys to
[1:00:27] study yourselves
[1:00:30] i can study you guys
[1:00:33] but how many of you have been able to
[1:00:35] study yourself
[1:00:36] establish
[1:00:38] are we stable in our minds
[1:00:40] in our feelings
[1:00:45] sometimes we're angry we're happy and
[1:00:47] then we're sad
[1:00:50] we should have stability in one's mind
[1:00:54] amen
[1:01:35] of balance
[1:01:40] so there's words that can take the place
[1:01:42] of the word balance
[1:01:51] steadiness stability harmony
[1:01:54] unity and orders
[1:01:59] those are words that can take the place
[1:02:00] of the word balance
[1:02:05] and i could say oh putting all things in
[1:02:07] steadiness
[1:02:10] but in all things instability
[1:02:14] putting all things in harmony
[1:02:17] putting all things in unity
[1:02:21] and putting all things in order
[1:02:26] man this morning we're going to place
[1:02:27] all things in its correct order
[1:03:00] there's a violence
[1:03:01] disorder disorder confusion confusion
[1:03:05] disconnection and disconnectedness
[1:03:09] can say man to that till now
[1:03:14] violence
[1:03:42] sometimes you feel disconnected
[1:03:45] you feel disconnected from your partner
[1:03:49] you feel disconnected from your children
[1:03:55] can't fit inside
[1:04:10] oh
[1:04:38] what is the fountain
[1:05:20] why doesn't
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:46] amen
[1:06:44] depending
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:07:26] all
[1:07:41] the scale
[1:07:42] what is the scale
[1:07:49] just like a judge has its scale there
[1:07:53] also god has a skill amen
[1:08:26] and it deserves a lot more attention
[1:08:27] than i will be able to give it
[1:08:33] and more than most any person on the
[1:08:35] earth would be able to give
[1:08:50] doctrine
[1:08:53] and to the brother who he may hear this
[1:08:55] tape
[1:09:00] offense i trust that it will not be an
[1:09:02] offense
[1:09:45] that's why sometimes we miss the target
[1:09:47] oh i see cccc yes yes yes yes yes
[1:09:51] study it prayerfully
[1:09:54] carefully
[1:09:57] don't proceed too quickly
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:13] when something gets close to you
[1:10:17] in your daily life
[1:10:23] carefully
[1:10:26] and put in the balance of god's word
[1:10:40] [Applause]
[1:11:10] what does the word of god say
[1:11:14] or someone else
[1:11:19] so you could see this
[1:11:22] to see if it's of god
[1:11:24] or if it's
[1:11:38] are not given from
[1:11:52] or it's not
[1:11:59] the balance is the scale of the word the
[1:12:02] scale is the word the scale is the word
[1:12:06] because i believe that's how we should
[1:12:08] always be
[1:12:10] should always be this
[1:12:13] not every other year
[1:12:16] now give us one year
[1:12:19] next year a little wishy washy
[1:12:48] jesus
[1:13:01] that's why i believe it is
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:11] i believe that's the finished work of
[1:13:13] god wrote out in the word
[1:13:15] therefore
[1:13:30] or god's plan
[1:13:35] listen to each word the prophet is
[1:13:36] saying
[1:13:38] it couldn't be of god
[1:13:41] or could it be god's plan
[1:13:44] if it's not in
[1:13:57] amen amen
[1:14:07] i hope you remember the definitions we
[1:14:09] just gave
[1:14:10] equilibrium it's being in the balance
[1:14:23] in one moment or another have you ever
[1:14:24] felt some a little violent
[1:14:39] i see you
[1:14:54] but i want you to study yourself
[1:16:03] have you fought with god in one moment
[1:16:04] of your life or another
[1:16:08] in the book of acts
[1:16:11] that was peter with apostles
[1:16:15] i'm referring to acts chapter five
[1:16:32] pharisees
[1:16:44] for preaching and teaching the word of
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:48] they placed them in prison
[1:16:52] acts 5 chapter 19.
[1:16:56] the angel of the lord
[1:16:58] came and denied
[1:17:14] and preach the words of this life
[1:17:17] they went out and they obeyed
[1:17:21] and then when the day came
[1:17:23] the guards
[1:17:25] they saw that they weren't there anymore
[1:17:43] they grabbed them
[1:17:47] the council they bought them before the
[1:17:49] council
[1:17:52] for the captains and the pharisees
[1:18:10] so the pharisee stands up unfair one
[1:18:12] pharisee
[1:18:14] and verse 34.
[1:18:17] his name is gamaliel
[1:18:20] a doctor of the law
[1:18:22] is
[1:18:32] telling this to the pharisees and to the
[1:18:34] captains
[1:18:36] and he says now i say unto you
[1:19:06] leave him
[1:19:34] [Applause]
[1:19:59] is
[1:20:17] because man wants to go against isis
[1:20:20] and if they go against
[1:20:22] contra
[1:20:23] you're not fighting against men
[1:20:26] you are found fighting
[1:20:28] against god
[1:20:48] my question for you guys is have you
[1:20:49] guys thought
[1:20:51] have you become violent with god
[1:20:56] god help us this morning
[1:21:07] we fight because when god tells us
[1:21:08] something
[1:21:10] it's the perfect will
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:23] are you awake this morning man
[1:21:26] this
[1:21:36] is right in his own eyes
[1:21:39] okay
[1:21:40] what i do
[1:21:42] it's right it's correct
[1:21:46] but the lord
[1:21:48] pondereth lost
[1:21:50] the hearts
[1:21:53] amen amen
[1:22:09] opinion all the ways that the man are
[1:22:12] clean in his own eyes
[1:22:15] in my opinion
[1:22:20] because the word says
[1:22:22] the word says
[1:23:02] i was correct in my opinion
[1:23:32] there's a spirit
[1:24:06] [Laughter]
[1:24:28] in
[1:24:42] in my
[1:24:43] is my opinion
[1:24:46] it's what the word says
[1:24:50] if you're out of the word
[1:24:52] and then you're out
[1:24:55] it doesn't matter what my opinion may be
[1:24:57] my opinion
[1:24:59] my opinion is out of the word
[1:25:01] and i am out of the word
[1:25:06] in several examples in the scripture
[1:25:10] is weighing
[1:25:34] there is a spirit
[1:25:50] and proverbs 16 2 it says the spirit
[1:26:35] especially one that is hidden or not
[1:26:37] obvious
[1:26:40] there's a reason because we know
[1:26:41] something
[1:26:43] or objective
[1:26:46] i like this definition here they say
[1:26:58] not influenced by personal feelings or
[1:27:01] opinions personally
[1:27:20] it says not influenced by personal judge
[1:27:22] feelings or opinions of other people
[1:27:25] what is our motive
[1:27:27] what is our objective when we're doing
[1:27:29] this
[1:28:10] it's the word of god
[1:28:24] and see if your motive is right
[1:28:33] and then test your motive and see if
[1:28:35] your motive is right
[1:28:40] then jesus said in mark 11 24.
[1:28:44] if you say to this mountain
[1:28:46] be moved
[1:28:49] and you don't doubt in your heart
[1:28:53] but as long as you have doubt in your
[1:28:54] heart
[1:28:57] whether it's the will of god
[1:29:02] or your motive or objective is wrong
[1:29:07] said prophet says how is it going to
[1:29:09] move
[1:29:11] i'm going to repeat it one more time
[1:29:19] but if your motive and your objective is
[1:29:21] wrong
[1:30:04] not with the
[1:30:45] he weighs the spirits
[1:31:00] proverbs
[1:31:05] a false balance and is an abomination to
[1:31:08] the lord
[1:31:11] abomination
[1:31:13] what's an abomination
[1:31:27] it's like going to a restroom
[1:31:34] sometimes the smell is a little harsh
[1:31:38] that's an abomination
[1:32:36] and the truth
[1:32:48] don't miss the definition of balance
[1:32:51] this is uh
[1:32:53] uneven
[1:32:54] disunity
[1:32:56] violence
[1:32:57] disorder
[1:32:58] confusion disconnection and
[1:33:00] disconnectedness
[1:33:02] if there's something false
[1:33:04] because there's something genuine
[1:33:10] so when we have everything in balance
[1:33:12] the lord is pleased
[1:33:14] when we have our time
[1:33:20] and the lord is pleased with us
[1:33:24] here in 1st samuel chapter 2.
[1:33:32] she didn't have a son
[1:34:14] for the lord is god of knowledge
[1:34:30] begin to worship god
[1:34:34] it says talk no more so exceedingly
[1:34:36] proudly
[1:34:40] and me and me and me
[1:34:44] let not arrogancy come out of your mouth
[1:34:48] for the lord is god of all time
[1:34:54] and by him
[1:34:58] he knows everything
[1:35:39] god will remain in silence
[1:35:53] what are my actions
[1:36:36] what an
[1:37:03] says let us lay aside every weight
[1:37:10] what weight is dragging you this morning
[1:37:13] what weight do you get
[1:37:16] that's making you lean
[1:37:33] this morning
[1:37:35] what weight is in within inside of you
[1:37:40] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:37:42] us
[1:37:46] and let us
[1:38:13] and the other thing is
[1:38:42] there's
[1:38:55] so that we may be the example for others
[1:39:09] placing your eyes on the pastor
[1:39:22] says looking unto jesus
[1:39:36] i don't want to go to church no more i
[1:40:07] that's why we see a lot of people on the
[1:40:08] wayside
[1:40:11] family because they see how they have
[1:40:12] their eyes placed on this
[1:40:14] on this family
[1:40:15] this ministry
[1:40:17] that ministers
[1:40:18] and what they do
[1:40:20] i follow
[1:40:33] amen
[1:40:49] it's not destruction to the wicked
[1:40:53] look how tremendous
[1:40:55] is it not destruction to the wicked
[1:41:00] and a strange punishment to the workers
[1:41:02] of
[1:41:10] and counts all my steps
[1:41:14] if i was walking is
[1:41:30] integrity what is job saying
[1:41:34] i was walking in the seat
[1:41:37] did i deceive the people
[1:41:41] did i do something wrong
[1:41:44] said god best of me said weigh me
[1:41:48] in the balance of justice
[1:41:51] i want to be judged
[1:41:55] it put me on the scale of the word
[1:41:58] and you shall know
[1:42:26] it says the scale of the word
[1:42:33] he sees my actions
[1:42:35] he knows if i lied quantus on me
[1:42:38] where my steps are
[1:42:40] if
[1:43:46] and god gave him a diet
[1:43:48] so he began to take some weight off
[1:43:53] so we're going to fall over to this side
[1:43:56] but when we're in the correct way
[1:44:00] we're in the correct rate with the word
[1:44:19] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:44:21] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:44:25] as i was with moses
[1:44:27] so i will be with thee
[1:44:29] [Music]
