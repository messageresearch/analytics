[1:03:16] this morning
[1:03:18] may they not leave with that problem
[1:03:21] that they have
[1:03:41] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:03:45] amen amen you may take your seats
[1:03:50] like to thank the song leader and The
[1:03:52] Magicians this morning
[1:03:57] and each and every single one of you for
[1:04:00] and for making welcome the Lord Jesus
[1:04:02] Christ
[1:04:06] and this morning we're going to speak on
[1:04:08] a very simple small subject
[1:04:13] we're going to entitle it God's gifts
[1:04:18] wanna speak on something very simple and
[1:04:21] down to earth
[1:04:24] because that we understand that that's
[1:04:27] how that's how God came down
[1:04:32] he came in Simplicity
[1:04:34] yes and he reveals himself in Simplicity
[1:04:39] amen how many you love the Lord this
[1:04:41] morning
[1:04:43] amen how many know that that God gives
[1:04:46] gifts
[1:04:49] hey man come in he's a if I can say it
[1:04:54] this way hopefully it doesn't sound like
[1:04:55] religious
[1:04:59] he gave a Christmas gift
[1:05:02] if you look in brother branham's
[1:05:04] messages
[1:05:07] brother Rams uses that phrase
[1:05:11] God's Christmas gifts
[1:05:16] now if you look that up there
[1:05:19] now I'd like to read just a couple
[1:05:22] quotes before we start our message
[1:05:26] and it's brother Ram says here yeah I
[1:05:30] have the slides in Spanish I don't have
[1:05:31] them in English
[1:05:34] so you can just please bear with me
[1:05:37] it always it's always good to come to
[1:05:41] the house of the Lord
[1:05:47] it's always good
[1:05:49] to come to the house of the Lord
[1:05:53] but much better
[1:05:55] seems like in these Christmas and New
[1:05:58] Years and holidays
[1:06:03] in this special days
[1:06:07] so it's always good to come to the house
[1:06:09] of the Lord
[1:06:12] but it seems a little bit better
[1:06:16] when we come during the Christmas time
[1:06:20] in the New York Times
[1:06:23] and these special holiday times
[1:06:28] seems like it has a special little
[1:06:30] blessing left for us
[1:06:35] it's just too bad
[1:06:37] that we can't have this Christmas
[1:06:40] feeling all the time
[1:06:44] it's too bad so so I want to say
[1:06:48] something
[1:06:50] we hope we put things in Balance this
[1:06:52] morning
[1:06:54] that the prophet of God
[1:06:57] William Mary and Branham William Aaron
[1:06:59] Brown seventh angel messenger
[1:07:01] is talking about Christmas amen
[1:07:09] and he says that it's too bad
[1:07:12] that That Christmas Feeling
[1:07:16] we don't have it all the time
[1:07:19] people are waving at you
[1:07:22] saying the Lord bless you
[1:07:26] that's good I like that one thing about
[1:07:30] Christmas
[1:07:32] that that that that that feeling is this
[1:07:35] that people are talking to one another
[1:07:39] people are letting The Grudges go
[1:07:43] they're forgiving one another
[1:07:46] they're waving at each other
[1:07:48] you're going inside the grocery store
[1:07:52] oh God bless you Merry Christmas
[1:07:56] you're at your work
[1:07:58] and like for us Barbers
[1:08:01] you finished with your clients
[1:08:04] the Lord bless you Merry Christmas
[1:08:07] it's a very
[1:08:10] and the prophet of God says I like that
[1:08:13] about Christmas
[1:08:16] it's just a shame that we can't have
[1:08:18] this all year round
[1:08:23] it seems like on the 25th of Christmas
[1:08:26] everything is for everybody's forgiving
[1:08:28] one another
[1:08:31] everyone is saying hello to one another
[1:08:35] but on the 26th of December
[1:08:40] we start again with our problems
[1:08:44] there's there's a there's a a story that
[1:08:48] I heard
[1:08:49] I heard brother Garcia said one time
[1:08:52] he says that there was this old lady
[1:08:56] and she had she had this dispute with
[1:08:59] this other old lady
[1:09:02] there was her next door neighbor yes
[1:09:05] and she this lady started she got sick
[1:09:08] and she was about to die
[1:09:12] so she started calling up all of her
[1:09:14] friends and everybody that she had
[1:09:16] problems with
[1:09:18] Amigos
[1:09:21] and starting to straighten everything
[1:09:23] out
[1:09:24] so she called The Neighbor Next Door
[1:09:28] she sent her little granddaughter and
[1:09:30] said go bring me the vecina next door
[1:09:37] and so the the little sick lady is
[1:09:40] laying in the bed
[1:09:44] let's just give him names
[1:09:47] it was Maria and Guadalupe
[1:09:50] Guadalupe Maria tells Guadalupe
[1:09:53] Guadalupe
[1:09:55] Guadalupe we've had problems for many
[1:09:57] years
[1:10:00] your dog barks all the time
[1:10:03] and this sir we just had so many
[1:10:06] problems throughout the years
[1:10:33] this problem still goes on
[1:10:40] so let's not be like that
[1:10:42] let's forgive one another
[1:10:45] this Christmas spirit
[1:10:48] let it be all year long
[1:10:53] now we understand that the prophet God
[1:10:55] says that that Jesus Christ was not born
[1:10:58] on Christmas
[1:11:01] he was born in April the custom of the
[1:11:05] world just made it happen like that
[1:11:09] that's how it is yes yes but as let's
[1:11:15] just read another quote
[1:11:17] in the same message God's rap gift
[1:11:21] paragraph six in English
[1:11:24] in English it says and then I want to
[1:11:26] take this time to express
[1:11:32] to each and every one of you
[1:11:35] how grateful I am to you
[1:11:38] for your Christmas cards and Gifts
[1:11:41] foreign
[1:11:53] amen amen and the things that we
[1:11:56] received at our house
[1:11:59] I certainly thank you with all my heart
[1:12:03] and certainly did US good this morning
[1:12:08] he says I got a little boy
[1:12:11] small enough yet to kind of want a
[1:12:14] Christmas tree
[1:12:17] and we have it in the room
[1:12:50] and my friends my friends from around
[1:12:53] different places that had come in either
[1:12:54] Mis Amigos
[1:12:57] laying under the tree so brother Branham
[1:13:00] had a Christmas tree
[1:13:03] all right so you do how you want to take
[1:13:06] it
[1:13:07] but the RAM says and the deity of Jesus
[1:13:10] Christ
[1:13:13] says now they got some trees
[1:13:18] they cut it down they make Christmas
[1:13:21] trees for the kids
[1:13:25] that's all right
[1:13:28] I'm not kicking against that
[1:13:33] but the thing of it is they put more on
[1:13:37] Christmas tree
[1:13:41] then they do for Christo
[1:13:46] the Christmas tree that's all right
[1:13:50] I'm not kicking against that
[1:13:53] but the thing of it is they put more on
[1:13:55] the Christmas tree
[1:13:59] then they do for Christ
[1:14:02] and we find that every day of the year
[1:14:06] you hardly hear anything about Christ
[1:14:12] anything about God
[1:14:15] because it's offensive
[1:14:17] it offends the people
[1:14:20] they want to speak about the the Easter
[1:14:22] Bunny they want to speak about the
[1:14:24] Christmas tree
[1:14:27] but they never want to speak about
[1:14:29] Christ
[1:14:31] as yours go on
[1:14:34] it starts to get less and less and less
[1:14:39] so it gets to a point where they don't
[1:14:41] even say in English it's Christmas
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:15] the problem that I have is that we don't
[1:15:18] put Christ back in our home foreign
[1:15:26] and the reason why we do all of these
[1:15:29] things now
[1:15:33] as we start to to see when Jesus was
[1:15:37] born
[1:15:39] I understand that he was born in
[1:15:41] Bethlehem uh
[1:15:44] and we see that the founders were was
[1:15:47] Rahab and the general from Joshua's Army
[1:15:54] and we see that Rahab married the
[1:15:57] general
[1:15:59] they had a son a son named Solomon or
[1:16:02] salmon
[1:16:05] now that's not the Solomon that that we
[1:16:08] hear about the one who built the temple
[1:16:09] our noise
[1:16:19] so boaz's grandmother was
[1:16:26] here or not here but I can probably
[1:16:29] imagine Rahab the grandmother uh
[1:16:42] and then this great Army General by the
[1:16:45] name of Joshua yes
[1:16:50] everyone will fear him when they heard
[1:16:52] his name and
[1:16:54] then he said two of his prize
[1:17:01] I had no portion or any luck on this
[1:17:07] but I received these two spies
[1:17:13] by the grace of God there was nothing
[1:17:16] that I did
[1:17:17] there was nothing that I done
[1:17:20] but I received these two spies
[1:17:25] I took them to my home they gave me a
[1:17:28] sign
[1:17:29] they told me to just put it all my
[1:17:32] family in the room and now existence
[1:17:45] there's poliboas growing up
[1:17:51] Boaz grows up and he sees this young or
[1:17:54] this lady by the name of Ruth boss
[1:18:02] and he married ruse
[1:18:05] he married a gentile
[1:18:08] they had a son named obedience
[1:18:19] in Berlin and as we see brother Rams and
[1:18:23] the message begins to narrate foreign
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:20:07] right around the same place
[1:20:12] and where do they go they go to a Manger
[1:20:18] how many of you were here last night
[1:20:22] around amen that was really good the
[1:20:25] ones who weren't here
[1:20:26] I hope you can come next year
[1:20:29] to have Fellowship
[1:20:32] amen amen we had a little petting zoo
[1:20:35] last night
[1:20:43] I think it was a llama there too
[1:20:47] and the ones who got there
[1:20:54] kind of fresh huh
[1:20:58] all right well there's where the king of
[1:21:02] the world is
[1:21:09] because he was a lamb
[1:21:12] he wasn't born in all five-star hotel
[1:21:17] he wasn't born in uh in the biggest
[1:21:21] place in Los Angeles like the biggest
[1:21:23] fancy place up there
[1:21:27] in Los Angeles everybody missed it
[1:21:30] but he came in the most simplest manner
[1:21:33] foreign
[1:23:14] he's got a right to do it
[1:23:18] one that's giving it
[1:23:21] he has to wrap it any way that he wants
[1:23:24] to rep it
[1:23:26] doesn't make any different how it is
[1:23:30] he's got a right to do it because he's
[1:23:33] the one giving the gifts
[1:23:37] another thing the reason of it was as it
[1:23:42] was then
[1:23:43] so it wasn't customary for them to
[1:23:46] receive it the way it was wrapped
[1:23:52] they was expecting something a gift
[1:23:55] coming
[1:23:58] that will come down and chariots
[1:24:01] with Angel escort driving with fiery
[1:24:04] horses
[1:24:07] but when it comes as a little baby born
[1:24:10] in the manger
[1:24:13] little did they ever know what the
[1:24:16] scripture said
[1:24:19] I'll give this world a super science
[1:24:29] they asked for a
[1:24:31] signal one day he said I'll give it to
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:35] and it will be a super science
[1:24:38] it will be a sign that will last through
[1:24:41] all the ages
[1:24:45] a virgin shall conceive
[1:24:48] and bear a child is
[1:24:59] that's the gift that I'm going to give
[1:25:01] is
[1:25:03] but they didn't come the way that it was
[1:25:05] expecting
[1:25:07] and they turn it down it was there in
[1:25:11] the scriptures
[1:25:12] that a virgin shall conceive
[1:25:16] and we find Mary in
[1:25:19] blessed amongst all the women
[1:25:24] what was the difference
[1:25:26] she was blessed amongst all the women
[1:25:31] she was ready to receive the germ of
[1:25:37] God's Gift
[1:25:39] hasn't come the way people want it to
[1:25:42] come
[1:25:44] so they turn it down they don't want it
[1:25:47] then they want it wrapped in the kind of
[1:25:51] of a Goods that they wanted to be
[1:25:53] wrapped in
[1:25:57] they want tinsel on it they want some
[1:26:01] something flowery
[1:26:03] something that's perfumed
[1:26:06] something that's glittering
[1:26:09] something that's classic
[1:26:12] but God don't shed it like that all the
[1:26:15] time
[1:26:16] he sends it
[1:26:54] but there was something in that package
[1:27:02] we need in order to survive
[1:27:05] and it was wrapped in human flesh
[1:27:09] what is it inside that human flesh
[1:27:14] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:10] you just want what's on the inside
[1:28:14] and that's the same thing with Jesus
[1:28:16] Christ
[1:28:18] he came to his own in his own received
[1:28:20] the night
[1:28:22] that's right he's here this morning
[1:28:26] we are his
[1:28:28] we are part of the pride
[1:28:30] and we reject them
[1:28:33] we come to church and we fill this
[1:28:36] presence and we reject them because we
[1:28:40] don't want it the way he comes in
[1:28:45] we wanted something classical okay
[1:28:48] something something with perfume
[1:28:52] shiny and with flowers
[1:28:55] but when the Holy Ghost touches one of
[1:28:58] these days
[1:28:59] when it really touches
[1:29:02] oh you begin to cry you begin to win you
[1:29:07] begin to raise up your hands
[1:29:09] it's not something classical
[1:29:12] it's not something pretty
[1:29:14] that's why we don't want it
[1:29:18] because we we it makes us react a
[1:29:22] certain ways
[1:29:26] so it is today
[1:29:28] when this great gift of the church
[1:29:33] the Holy Spirit
[1:29:35] what's the gift
[1:29:37] the Holy Spirit
[1:29:39] it falls upon the poor and the humble
[1:29:43] guys
[1:29:44] the rich don't want it
[1:29:47] they don't want to Humble themselves
[1:29:50] they want it with classes but they don't
[1:29:54] want it the way God sends it
[1:29:57] many people wants to receive the holy
[1:30:00] ghosts
[1:30:02] how many you want the Holy Ghost
[1:30:05] I believe we already have it
[1:30:09] maybe it might be one or two that don't
[1:30:10] have it
[1:30:11] they maybe we want many people want to
[1:30:15] receive the Holy Ghost personas
[1:30:18] but they don't want to get it the way
[1:30:21] they want to get it the way they want it
[1:30:24] I'm going to say that again many people
[1:30:28] want to receive the Holy Ghost personas
[1:30:31] but they want to get it the way they
[1:30:34] want it
[1:30:37] all I'm so glad
[1:30:40] you can't do it that way
[1:30:44] you have to do it the way God sends it
[1:30:48] to you
[1:30:50] you got to humble yourself
[1:30:53] and receive it many people want to
[1:30:56] receive the holy ghosts by just coming
[1:31:00] to church
[1:31:01] and just dressing real fine and pretty
[1:31:04] no you've got to come to church
[1:31:08] got to surrender yourself
[1:31:11] you got to humble yourself
[1:31:14] you gotta Surrender Your Ideas
[1:31:17] you gotta raise up your hands to knock
[1:31:21] off the starch out of her neck
[1:31:24] and you got to say God there's nothing
[1:31:27] that I can do to receive your holy
[1:31:30] ghosts
[1:31:37] and I yield myself to you
[1:31:40] I want to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] the way that I'm supposed
[1:31:49] I don't believe in a dried I repentance
[1:31:56] okay God I'm sorry thank you Lord
[1:31:59] oh no when you really receive it
[1:32:01] and when you truly understand
[1:32:04] that you're a sinner
[1:32:07] nothing from foreign
[1:33:04] how do they receive it in Pentecost
[1:33:07] they put their differences aside
[1:33:10] they started to forgive one another
[1:33:13] all the little disputes
[1:33:16] they started to fix everything
[1:33:22] oh what a hard thing that is
[1:33:26] for everyone to get in one Accord
[1:33:30] I wonder if that's the reason why we
[1:33:32] don't have the Holy ghosts
[1:33:39] aside foreign
[1:34:21] foreign
[1:35:19] there's no perfect Church
[1:35:21] perfecta but I would say this there is a
[1:35:26] Perfect Bride
[1:35:27] a bride who's making herself ready
[1:35:31] amen amen
[1:35:34] they don't want it
[1:35:36] it's the same thing today is
[1:35:39] they don't want it they don't want the
[1:35:42] Holy Ghost
[1:35:43] because they know what it's wrapped in
[1:35:46] it
[1:35:48] they know what's inside of it
[1:35:51] they they watch a person receive the
[1:35:54] Holy Ghost observance
[1:35:57] they stand there and they see that woman
[1:36:01] maybe as low as you could be
[1:36:05] to even the dogs will hardly ever look
[1:36:08] at her
[1:36:10] and they see that woman come up to the
[1:36:12] altar even is
[1:36:18] to see a woman clean up her life
[1:36:23] get out and act like a lady
[1:36:26] see one runs Bridge parties
[1:36:33] smoke for or five packs of cigarette
[1:36:35] today
[1:36:38] hang around the saloons and regular
[1:36:41] barfully
[1:36:44] and they know that if they and they know
[1:36:47] if they accept this gift of God yeah
[1:36:52] it's wrapped in the package called Jesus
[1:36:55] Christ
[1:36:59] every bit of the worldly funds
[1:37:03] because he won't stand for that
[1:37:07] it does something to them
[1:37:10] it changes people
[1:37:14] don't want to be changed
[1:37:19] listen leave me alone
[1:37:22] they don't want the Holy Ghost
[1:37:24] because they don't want to change
[1:37:27] they want to be the way they always the
[1:37:30] way they've always been yeah
[1:37:32] they say leave NBA
[1:38:02] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[1:38:05] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:38:08] whosoever believeth in him so not perish
[1:38:10] but have everlasting life
[1:38:20] I found this image the other day
[1:38:24] is where we see there's two booths
[1:38:29] we see John 3 16.
[1:38:33] and we see John 3 16 to 21.
[1:38:38] and we see a long line on John 3 16.
[1:38:44] but in the other booth there's nobody
[1:38:46] there
[1:38:48] because I believe that John 3 16 is the
[1:38:51] most misunderstood scripture
[1:38:54] says
[1:38:56] you go to the Super Bowls
[1:39:00] you go to the World Cup
[1:39:03] any any festival or any big event called
[1:39:07] Kill Festival or
[1:39:09] somebody preaching in the streets
[1:39:12] you see always see John 3 16.
[1:39:18] but they never read what's after John 3
[1:39:21] 16.
[1:39:25] so let's see what it says on the 17th
[1:39:28] verse
[1:39:31] for God sent not a son into the world to
[1:39:35] condemn the world
[1:39:42] but he that believeth not
[1:39:46] is condemned already
[1:39:49] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:39:52] of the only begotten Son of God
[1:39:57] and this is the condemnation
[1:40:01] that the light has come into the world
[1:40:05] and Men love Darkness rather than light
[1:40:11] because their deeds were evil
[1:40:15] for everyone that doeth evil
[1:40:21] neither one neither cometh to the light
[1:40:26] shall be reproved
[1:40:29] or exposed us but he that doeth truth
[1:40:34] cometh to the light
[1:40:37] that is these may be
[1:40:41] manifestos that they are wrought in God
[1:40:46] begin to see we begin to understand
[1:40:49] a variant in there that they're no
[1:40:51] wonder they don't want the other booth
[1:40:55] because they have the light of the world
[1:40:57] has come to the world
[1:41:01] and they they started to see that their
[1:41:04] deeds even kisses over us they're not
[1:41:07] good they're evil they're not wrong
[1:41:11] maybe some greater than others
[1:41:14] and the light exposes those wrongs
[1:41:21] but he doesn't come to condemn the world
[1:41:25] but he comes to save it everyone who
[1:41:28] wants to be saved
[1:41:30] everybody who wants to save in their own
[1:41:33] selves
[1:41:35] they're going to try to say that they
[1:41:38] say themselves by works
[1:41:42] and what that light does
[1:41:45] it condemns them when we're here at
[1:41:48] church
[1:41:49] and you're the fir you're new to coming
[1:41:52] to church
[1:41:54] you begin to hear the gospel the light
[1:41:57] of the gospel
[1:41:59] and you begin to see that it exposes you
[1:42:02] that you're wrong
[1:42:06] and as a human reaction
[1:42:09] we don't want to accept that we're wrong
[1:42:12] we always want to say that we're right
[1:42:16] but everything I do is
[1:42:19] correct and what I do I can justify it
[1:42:23] but the gospel of the light exposes it
[1:42:29] gives you these two paths
[1:42:32] and we have the right to choose one or
[1:42:35] the other direction
[1:42:37] but we go to Ephesians the second
[1:42:39] chapter
[1:42:41] on verse
[1:42:44] we're going to read here on God's gifts
[1:42:51] here it says for by grace
[1:42:53] are ye saved this is
[1:43:00] and there is not of yourself yes
[1:43:03] but it is a gift of God
[1:43:06] see it's a gift from God
[1:43:10] see by grace are you saved through faith
[1:43:17] and it is not of yourselves
[1:43:20] so we're saved because God has given us
[1:43:23] Grace
[1:43:26] all we have to do is believe in that
[1:43:29] word
[1:43:31] we have to believe in this word
[1:43:34] but Faith but
[1:43:40] there's Works being expressed through
[1:43:42] faith I always kisses
[1:43:45] in other words I just can't say I'm safe
[1:43:48] just because I believe in God
[1:43:53] if I truly believe I'm safe
[1:43:56] by faith me Faith I start showing it by
[1:44:00] work
[1:44:02] by my works
[1:44:05] I can I can fake it after a while
[1:44:09] but when God is truly inside of my heart
[1:44:13] I begin to express it
[1:44:16] I express it by coming to church
[1:44:20] I express it but when someone does wrong
[1:44:24] to me
[1:44:26] I let it go I apologize
[1:44:30] because it's by faith
[1:44:32] we start showing it by faith
[1:44:37] we started showing it how we are in the
[1:44:40] church
[1:44:43] from yourself
[1:44:46] it's a gift
[1:44:49] it's a gift here it is all you have to
[1:44:54] do is take it
[1:44:55] but it seems that no one wants to take
[1:44:58] the gift of God
[1:45:01] everybody wants to work for it
[1:45:04] everybody wants to work hard
[1:45:07] they want to show everybody that I'm the
[1:45:09] best hard worker
[1:45:13] because I'm saved by works
[1:45:17] it says that is not of works this is
[1:45:24] for we are his workmanship
[1:45:28] created in Christ
[1:45:33] which God had before ordained that we
[1:45:35] should walk in them
[1:45:39] it is not by works
[1:46:57] young and old and all foreign
[1:47:41] beyond that Dimension
[1:47:44] they still have a memory
[1:47:47] they know he's having what they were
[1:47:50] doing they know what time it is on Earth
[1:47:56] they know down there it's Christmas time
[1:48:01] they know what they've done to a
[1:48:04] Christmas time
[1:48:20] what if they're creeping bony frame
[1:48:24] could get back to this church door this
[1:48:26] morning
[1:48:31] what do you think they would do if they
[1:48:33] had an opportunity to come back this
[1:48:35] morning
[1:48:40] next Christmas you may be there
[1:48:45] you may have been you you might you may
[1:48:48] have been there there a year next
[1:48:50] Christmas
[1:48:56] you're dealing with human Souls
[1:49:00] you're dealing with spiritual things
[1:49:04] and each one of you has to got to answer
[1:49:07] at that day of judgment
[1:49:15] if you haven't received the Christ this
[1:49:18] morning
[1:49:21] he stands at the open door of your heart
[1:49:26] so there is a hell that exists
[1:49:29] brother Brahm says that they were able
[1:49:31] to get up and resurrect this is
[1:49:36] one more opportunity
[1:49:40] just go and come to the doors of the
[1:49:43] church
[1:49:46] says
[1:49:51] where they just
[1:49:53] not just raise up their hands
[1:49:56] oh I I can imagine if someone from hell
[1:49:59] will just
[1:50:02] resurrected and said if I had one more
[1:50:05] opportunity
[1:50:09] I wouldn't take Church in vain anymore
[1:50:16] whether it was the most boring preacher
[1:50:20] the most exciting preachers it doesn't
[1:50:23] matter because I'm coming to see Christ
[1:50:27] I'm coming to receive him I'm coming to
[1:50:31] get my life right
[1:50:33] if my life isn't right I want to make it
[1:50:37] right I want to humble myself
[1:50:42] I want to fix it I don't know where I'm
[1:50:46] going to be tomorrow

[1:53:43] bit he says
[1:53:48] that Young Rich ruler
[1:53:51] began to cry
[1:54:11] there's nothing else there why do you
[1:54:14] want to go there

[1:54:18] it's impossible
[1:54:20] it's not for you
[1:54:26] it's a hard thing for a man to go to
[1:54:29] hell

[1:54:33] morning
[1:54:35] to accept God's gifts
