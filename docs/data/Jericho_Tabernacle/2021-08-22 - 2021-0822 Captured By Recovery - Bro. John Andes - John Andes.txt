just here in phoenix for a few days yes you are the phoenix uh helping uh pastor aaron mcgary yodan el paso aaron mcgeary from arizona believer's church de la iglesia arizona believers church and we spoke there wednesday and sunday this morning [Music] and so we might as well just start rejoicing together [Music] i've been made aware of the history of jericho tabernacle delta and um from 2019 and we remember brother john and i know that um it hasn't been easy and since december last year i know there's been a lot of changes in this church and election of the new pastor i don't know you you don't know me and donald and in the last several years and the changes you've made so that's why we wanted to come here and support you tonight happy to be seeing so many of the young ministers uh muy contento de ver mucho de los ministers in the leadership and i think brother branham would be very very happy you could kill me felice you know i'm not here to speak about myself a spoken word and voice of god recordings listen to [Music] so all the english messages our family has worked with them i think my parents might be streaming the service tonight and i'll just say this before we read the scriptures this is our first time to be with you yes you know maybe another minister would speak differently they might try to speak uh great revelations or deep mysteries or something jesus but i believe we need to hear what the lord would say to us uh what the lord wants to say to the church way before tonight this service was pre-planned and so i want to speak from my heart if that's okay so i want to speak on captured by recovery it is so let's stand and turn to psalms chapter 39 we have prayed for the word and for us all together this is the psalm of david and he was speaking this to a chief musician it was a a levite and a chief singer and david was speaking to him as we read these verses just put yourself in the scriptures and especially the last verse of the chapter especially i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me guarded i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned then spake eye with my oh lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am. behold thou has made my days as in hand breath this is what a hand breath is not very long yes the lord has made our days like a hand breath and my age is as nothing before thee immediately verily every man i think we can say women also at his best state is altogether vanity is surely every man walketh in a vain show surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them. and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish libra david said i was dumb i opened not my mouth because remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thine hand when thou with rebukes does correct men for iniquity they'll make us his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity con castillos just two more verses hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were oh no yes now this is david in verse 13. oh spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more deja me it is amen i'm in have you ever needed strength before the fuerza then tonight's your night to receive it hallelujah god bless you you can have your seats tonight that means that captured is a significant you people today trophy fisherman or fisher women they want to net a big fish and they're so happy but i want to say tonight to you you have been netted by god you are his trophy ustedes you are god's trophy i told you i was going to preach for my heart we believe jesus christ is in this room right now the same angel that was with william branham tabernacle tonight it's the holy ghost it's the answer to your prayers it's the groaning of your heart it's what david said oh spare me that i may recover strength how many has ever been weary before that is god capturing you see you're made you want to run free and you want to do your own thing but god has caught you but you are a prisoner of love [Music] we just love to be in his presence we just love his word so captured by recovery recovery is when you retrieve something you bring it back to your possession you regain it you rescue it lord it means that you have improved you you are mended as significant means you're getting your strength back significant hallelujah brother branham in 1965 in california in california preaching modern events made clear by prophecy he said you can ever be so sincere is he said come back into the word of god elise and get lined up and then go illogovaya like a soldier doesn't know what to do until he gets orders to do it we must be christian soldiers christians and get orders from the bible for this hour now [Music] but the charge of today which way we go and find out the hour that we're living in now this isn't always easy i think this church has found that out in the last two years it's easy to just keep going down the road but when men and women desire a chain lost and when there's a thirst inside of them and when there's burdens and then when there's a groaning economy you have to respond to that deep but god can give us the saith the lord i see jesus he said but we have patience the prophecies that's been promised [Music] [Music] you have calendars you look at a calendar to find what day of the year you're living in just and you look at god's bible you say mira la bibla to see what age that we're living in are we living in the last stage are we living in the last days we've received the last prophet we don't need an eighth messenger no vamos ajero octavo christ has already delivered the word chris hallelujah we just need to believe that words stop letting men's uh opinions and just because they're older don't make them wiser the mind of the lord for now lamented bringing god bringing back to god that he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it now did you all enjoy your camp meetings that you just had this fruit you know god gives us times of refreshing [Music] he gives you courage to go on i believe it with all of my heart now tonight esta we want to rejoice in the lord because you have been captured by recovery not by death not by sickness covet is not going to kill you nothing can kill you hello death is a doorway into a new body satan can't take our lives and there isn't going to be any mask in heaven i think i got about 50 support on that one maybe the rest of you are shouting hallelujah there isn't going to be any mask in heaven there's no sickness in heaven [Music] out of that mind that can be troubled this is sunday night and a rejoicing service we have been taken by the rapture it has caught you yeah and it's taking you higher hallelujah we're doing pretty good for our first service [Music] you have been captured by refreshments is anybody thirsty tonight i have to borrow your water thank you brother yeah i need to make an illustration who's thirsty tonight i'm not going to walk way back there i'm just i'm out who's thirsty [Music] so if he's thirsty and has a need and i give him this water say drink of that water brother wow that's going to be your water the rest of the night now he's been captured brother john has been captured by refreshment refrigerator oh wow double blessing praise god but they're smaller than brother want but i hope i hope they were half price brother so brother juan was was thirsty but he's been captured by refreshment you were thirsty and god gave you water so tonight you have been captured by refreshments see [Music] you've been captured by healing god heals the osana you've been captured by healing we say that means you have been caught by that significa you've been captured by your helper if we say a captured you needed help god your helper idios so he says i will help you and this is so you've been arrested by the helper aura he was captured by a prepared fish jonah 117. i think our brothers can put that on the screen jonah 1 17. now the lord had prepared a great fish and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days tres diaz and three nights would you agree tonight jonah was captured he couldn't go nowhere have you ever been in the belly of a whale honest how did he breathe down there was there light switches down there was there food down there there was vomit down there could he read the bible or anything brother oh i don't know you don't know it wasn't a it wasn't a fun three days in three nights probably had nightmares probably trying to breathe have you ever tried to breathe in the belly of a great whale probably gasping he was captured captured by a prepared fish and that might sound like it's on the negative negative but as jonah was in the belly of the whales so jesus was going to be in the tomb his mercy just surrounds me god's grace is sufficient for me tonight you are having love [Music] i think you've been challenged over the last 12 months 17 months is are you vaccinated are you not vaccinated [Music] we're made to be with one another i hope when i come back next time there'll be no mass espero i can see your smile i can see some of you that aren't saying amen you're probably going hallelujah hallelujah so next time brother espera la probably through their mouth saying glory to god because we have nothing to be sad about tonight does anybody got a problem that jesus can't handle does anybody in jericho tabernacle have an issue gets us all in a pretzel like this i think we need to sing that song they that [Music] they shall mount up with wings as an [Music] [Music] but you can walk and then get really weary but when you wait upon the lord when you pray to the lord your life is being captured [Music] so jonah was captured by a fish we've you've been captured if we stick up today my perfect faith you would have always had a fondness in your heart for eliezers but you're married to isaac i think i need to say that again you don't go into the tent with eliezer you're married to isaac but eliezer would have always been very fond to you siempre we don't baptize in the name of william branagh william branham repent and be baptized he owes multi-sausage in the name of our lord jesus christ i'm just making sure we believe the same thing [Music] see when you didn't believe at and tonight you have perfect faith hallelujah you're going to be captured by a millennium for a millennial think about this 1 000 years [Music] this is before you go to heaven this is before you're in that other place you're going to be alive for a thousand year honeymoon luna we're not going to close till some of you smile a little bit some of you got married and you couldn't afford a honeymoon maybe brother one two weeks okay give me three you'll give me four moms [Music] that sounds pretty incredible i think i want to be married to this guy a thousand years and the devil's going to be bound [Music] i didn't get it no amens i got some laughs some chuckles no you know as ministers we get a lot of questions is there gonna be coffee in heaven here buenos air canto i don't think some of you would like heaven without coffee it might surprise some of you you might have chocolate in heaven but you know what it really doesn't matter if we're there whatever it's going to be like it's going to be wonderful so ask your pastor if there's going to be chocolate in heaven maybe the lord will give him a vision or a dreamer isn't that wonderful you're a brother john alfredo is in a new body el manoj he lived over 70 years vivionos i mean we would have wanted him to live forever but i don't want to be 200 years old stop praying for me to be 200 years is so we're sad because something's been taken from us but in heaven they captured they captured a flower a trap captured by a new body captured now i was thinking today open sour of what it takes how long it takes for a believer to recover quanto tiempos from things that happen in their lives [Music] you know we want it to happen immediately we want it to happen quickly and i believe we serve a god of miracles but you know there's other times there's something called a healing and healing takes time and that takes a season yes are you willing to take a healing estas i told you i was going to preach from my heart you know we want it over now we want a miracle [Music] [Music] i mean most churches are canceling sunday night services it's a miracle that you even want to be here quiet [Music] if god allows a healing to take place it's called a season of recovery if your attitude would be the same is can you put psalms 39 verse 13 up on the screen again psalms 39 verse 13 salmon david said oh spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence antis quebec david was saying david sia i need to recover strength i need to mend i need to get well that i may recover strength hallelujah in the message god who's rich in mercy elements talking about the murmuring times that we live in he's talking about the day of moses brother branham said god rich in mercy it is in phoenix is there no physician there are we supposed to be frustrated all the time are we supposed to get angry with god all the time are we supposed to shake our face like this to the sun is captured by the words to just confess i might not understand this he says but my god is able mediocre he's more than able god is in control let's make it personal personal my god is in control he's big it is i'm overwhelmed i feel like some other thoughts are cut taking over my thoughts how many believe god knows the future so he sees down the road and around the corner so he knows what's best for you stop wrestling they hit the luchar stop fighting stop beating the air they depend believe the word of god god is making a way of escape for you if you'll believe it god is interested in what is wrong i'm quoting brother branham [Music] god is interested in it's not good enough just to hear it it's not good enough just to say amen to it you've got to believe that god cares for me to me god has given me mercy god has forgiven my sins i'm not troubled i'm not absurd [Music] i've been captured by love we are trapped he wants to do it for you praise god do you all believe in testimony there was a young lady that was born and raised in the message her father is actually a pastor of the message but being raised in the message a teenager she reached a time of great depression in her life she even told us a few weeks ago she and in that awkward time of teenage life she started cutting her arms it's just the devil diablo trying to take your life trying to bring attention i sat with her a few weeks ago with my wife now she's growing and she has children of her own allowed her to be captured but she had it in her heart to go to these special meetings but a special youth meeting in louisiana and louisiana and hundreds of young people and hundreds of believers there is a job because she was now converted given her heart to the lord she wanted to praise the lord she wanted to thank the lord but she was so embarrassed because of these scars from when satan was trying to capture her cuandos and how she had cut herself there were scars all up her arms because it was warm march and april gabriel usually she could wear a long sleeve shirt and cover up her scarf camisole no one would know the years of embarrassment not in savvy los angeles but she reached a time at these meetings so she said lord i'm i want to worship you i want to love you but i have these awful scars and these memories of the past she just said lord i'm gonna worship you anyway so she just stood up on her feet and lifted her hands and began to praise god had taken all the scars away totally i thank god for that it's called worship scars tonight we need more believers that are like that we can't worship god anyhow not at the end of the storm no alfinale not [Music] i'm going to worship i'm recovering [Music] i want to say thank you jesus gracias jesus he's my healer when i'm he's my deliverer when i'm bound he makes a way in provence there is no way that's our that's a person that has been recovered can you put up isaiah 38 verse 16. can we go just a few more minutes isaiah 38 16. oh lord oh senor by these things men live so will thou recover god has more than enough for you look at verse 21 there isaiah 38 verse 21. isaiah said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil and he shall recover and this person shall recover it's not unto death you're going to recover i'm speaking to mothers tonight [Music] brother branham was praying in new york listen to this prayer organization our kind heavenly father this dear little mother stands here desperately in need she's made her way against the opposition and she's come tonight asking for a blessing oh jesus oh jesus son of god i pray that i know how the prayer of faith for our sister and she is on her way to recovery now that's different from a miracle speedily the lord has spoken speedily the lord has heard your prayers this was what brother branham said may i speedily hear from her today but the enemy has departed from her enemies she is on her way to recovery yes all of us should be able to say that tonight i'm on my way brother hermano sister i'm on my way hermana i'm asking you you're on your way you're on your way
