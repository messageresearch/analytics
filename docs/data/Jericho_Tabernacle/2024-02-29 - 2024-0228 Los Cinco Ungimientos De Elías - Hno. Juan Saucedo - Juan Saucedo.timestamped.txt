[25:24] the may the Lord bless us this evening
[25:29] we're going to go straight into the
[25:31] message or the
[25:33] scripture to be able to see if we can
[25:35] take advantage of the time that we
[25:44] have we're going to be going into First
[25:47] Kings
[25:50] 171 and may the Lord bless you each and
[25:52] every one of you for being
[25:56] here I understand and that on T or
[25:58] Wednesdays it's a bit
[26:01] hard the majority of us have to
[26:04] work including
[26:08] myself but Brothers remember that
[26:11] there's always a reward at the
[26:15] end so in that manner that our work in
[26:18] the Lord is not in
[26:21] [Music]
[26:26] vain
[26:37] [Music]
[26:43] and Elijah the tishbite who was in the
[26:46] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[26:49] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[26:51] whom I stand there shall not be duw nor
[26:54] rain these years but according to my
[26:57] word
[26:59] let us pray to
[27:01] God loving Heavenly
[27:04] Father we want to thank you this
[27:08] evening for bringing us here
[27:11] tonight to be able to hear from your
[27:14] word help us to put ourselves to the
[27:16] [Music]
[27:19] side and that it be you that comes down
[27:22] and helps
[27:26] us
[27:29] help that me and my interpreter here
[27:31] become nothing but just
[27:37] doormats where the Brethren come and
[27:40] before entering into the sanctuary they
[27:42] clean their
[27:45] feet and if we can only help just one
[27:47] person this
[27:50] evening for here the people that are
[27:53] [Music]
[27:56] visible
[27:58] and also all those that are watching via
[27:59] the
[28:01] Internet we thank you
[28:03] Lord we ask you all of this in the name
[28:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[28:09] amen you may be
[28:11] [Music]
[28:13] seated if you wouldn't mind opening up
[28:16] your scriptures now to Malachi
[28:21] 3 and we will be reading from the first
[28:26] verse and I'm going to be at uh the
[28:29] first
[28:31] verse I first of all want to ask for
[28:36] forgiveness because on Wednesdays I
[28:38] regularly can't
[28:43] assist I have a sort of a strange
[28:50] job and tonight I'm supposed to leave at
[28:55] 11:00 but I've told God
[28:58] God and I've asked
[29:01] him Lord give me the
[29:05] strength and give me the desire to
[29:07] assist on
[29:10] Wednesdays it doesn't matter if I go in
[29:12] at 11 or 12:00 at night you will give me
[29:15] the
[29:16] strength because you are our
[29:18] strength and if we do your
[29:22] will then you will help
[29:26] us and I believe that he's going to help
[29:28] me to stay awake all
[29:32] evening so now that I've uh asked for
[29:34] forgiveness for Notting on
[29:38] Wednesdays I want to greet all the
[29:40] brothers that are watching via the
[29:44] Internet and this week I had a sister
[29:46] from Colombia contact
[29:50] me she would visit uh Phoenix Tabernacle
[29:53] a
[29:56] lot I don't know if many of you remember
[29:59] her but her name is Maria
[30:03] Elsa and she contacted me and she
[30:05] desires with her
[30:07] daughter and she has a daughter that's
[30:09] 16 years
[30:12] old and they desire to come and visit
[30:14] the United
[30:17] States and it's been about roughly 10
[30:19] years since I've seen
[30:24] them and she tells me that sometimes she
[30:26] connects or or watches via the Internet
[30:28] and sees
[30:31] us and she gave me a very beautiful
[30:34] testimony of our Johnny or brother
[30:35] Johnny
[30:37] Al and she noticed that he was the
[30:40] founding
[30:46] pastor and she also noticed that our
[30:48] current Pastor is our brother
[30:52] Octavio so I want to greet all those
[30:54] brothers that are watching
[30:56] online
[31:01] and it seems like at times we only focus
[31:03] on the ones that are here
[31:07] present but there are many others that
[31:09] are watching us
[31:14] online and so wherever they find
[31:17] themselves we want to greet them in the
[31:18] name of the Lord Jesus
[31:21] Christ we're going to be reading the
[31:23] scripture Malachi
[31:25] 31 do you have the
[31:29] scripture uh wish that you follow me
[31:32] because I'm going to go
[31:47] bit behold I will send you my messenger
[31:49] and he shall prepare the way before me
[31:51] and the the Lord whom ye seek shall
[31:53] suddenly come to his Temple even the
[31:56] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[31:57] Delight in behold he shall come sayith
[32:00] the Lord
[32:02] host and I typically use a the Bible sco
[32:07] field since I had converted onto the
[32:12] Lord being a young man of 13 years
[32:15] [Music]
[32:18] old the denomination first reached
[32:22] me and now us with the revelation of the
[32:26] message
[32:31] we know that the churches out
[32:36] there they were like a little chicken
[32:39] coop where that little eaglet was
[32:42] found who didn't understand what was
[32:45] going
[32:47] on the the handen would uh
[32:51] PE and all the little chicklets would
[32:56] come
[33:01] and so they would eat whatever the
[33:02] mother hand would would kick off or she
[33:05] would but the eagle wouldn't do
[33:10] that the eag would stay
[33:13] behind only
[33:16] watching because it was not its
[33:21] nature it was born under the warmth of
[33:25] it and it was born in that chicken
[33:30] coop and it understood some of the
[33:32] things that were being done in that
[33:37] area but we know that it felt a little
[33:40] bit out of
[33:41] order and now we understand the reason
[33:44] why because it was an
[33:48] eagle it had that desire of an eagle
[33:53] inside instead of always looking down it
[33:55] would always look up
[33:58] just how we do
[34:02] it there's nothing to look down and we
[34:04] don't keep our head
[34:06] down we always must keep our heads
[34:10] up because we Now understand who is the
[34:13] one that's up
[34:16] there and so the Lord permitted me to
[34:19] find myself with this Scofield
[34:22] bible and it's the Bible that I've been
[34:24] using all of my
[34:25] life
[34:31] and this great man who wrote this
[34:37] Bible has a lot of things that really
[34:39] capture my
[34:44] attention an example it says here my
[34:49] messenger it says like this behold I
[34:51] will send my
[34:54] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[34:57] before
[34:59] me so that
[35:01] verse there's no
[35:03] doubt there shouldn't be any doubt on
[35:07] us that he is speaking to us about John
[35:09] the
[35:12] Baptist and this evening I just bring a
[35:14] little bit of an ABC instruction for all
[35:16] of
[35:19] us something that captured our attention
[35:22] many years
[35:25] ago
[35:27] and I don't know when exactly you were
[35:29] the one that heard the
[35:32] message I grew up in a
[35:36] denomination after the Lord had uh
[35:38] called
[35:39] me he brought me into a
[35:43] denomination and I was there for a
[35:45] couple of years not
[35:49] many but the Lord permitted
[35:52] Me by
[35:55] 1972
[35:57] for the first time to be able to hear
[35:59] the message of the
[36:02] hour and I was already pastoring a
[36:04] church being a young
[36:06] man and I believe I already gave you my
[36:09] testimony I had a
[36:13] bicycle that the organization bought for
[36:15] me so I could move around
[36:17] town and then they bought me a
[36:21] motorcycle and so then I started to feel
[36:23] like I'm I was a little a bit of
[36:25] importance
[36:27] and it was an automatic
[36:31] one and it wasn't one of those that you
[36:33] had to Kickstart to be able to get it
[36:36] going and it was one of those that I
[36:39] just had to do a push
[36:41] start so then they also gave me a
[36:47] home and all those brothers that have
[36:50] lived a couple of
[36:53] years they gave me a salary of50 P by
[36:59] week 150 week or 150 pesos every
[37:04] week but one
[37:08] day they came and they knocked on my
[37:11] door because I lived right next to the
[37:16] church and two men came and identified
[37:19] themselves to
[37:21] me one of them was called
[37:25] arindo and the other one was called
[37:28] Ram there was two of
[37:31] them they were coming from the city of
[37:35] ton and they were going to S
[37:39] Lis and I was in a small town
[37:44] called and there I was pastoring a small
[37:46] little
[37:47] church in the
[37:50] denomination and then when they
[37:52] arrive it was a day of
[37:55] service
[37:58] so I gave them the opportunity to be
[37:59] able to give a
[38:02] testimony and the first thing that I
[38:04] heard from
[38:08] them was malakiah
[38:11] [Music]
[38:14] 45 but their names uh just notice that I
[38:16] still remember their names ero and
[38:20] R those names were engraved in my
[38:24] mind they were the ones that brought me
[38:26] to the
[38:28] message they left books for
[38:32] me but the first message that I began to
[38:36] read was the anointed ones of the end
[38:40] time and then the first page when you
[38:42] open up that
[38:44] book brother Bram is on this side of the
[38:49] page but he's on the left side over
[38:55] here
[38:57] is he has his hand up and his tie is
[38:58] kind of moving on to the side and he has
[39:01] his hand pointing this
[39:03] way you the ones that are leading the
[39:07] blind one day you shall reap what you've
[39:09] been
[39:13] sewing and when he was doing that I took
[39:16] that as for
[39:17] me and that I haven't been able to
[39:19] forget it that has been many years
[39:24] ago so after being in the
[39:28] denomination the message of the hour
[39:30] arrived to me for the first
[39:33] time
[39:37] 1972 what a beautiful day that was for
[39:40] me I asked him for
[39:43] directions and then more Brethren came
[39:46] to visit me later
[39:49] on but I'll never forget the message
[39:51] that they had
[39:55] preached 45 and6 and later on we're
[39:58] going to be doing a little bit more
[39:59] emphasis on
[40:00] it but in the manner that they were
[40:02] explaining
[40:06] it and this is where we sometimes ask
[40:10] God that we study all week
[40:13] long perhaps maybe two
[40:19] weeks and then in that time I was only I
[40:22] was writing down what I was going to
[40:24] speak about
[40:25] today
[40:28] so then when we come un God we ask him
[40:30] to give us the
[40:31] words to be able to explain
[40:35] it in a manner that's going to be easy
[40:37] for everybody to be able to
[40:39] understand because it does us no good to
[40:41] be able to come to church to sit in the
[40:45] pews and not
[40:47] listen or
[40:50] understand how can we
[40:53] understand if nobody explains it to us
[40:58] that's what the that Walker was coming
[41:00] saying when he was coming from
[41:03] uh and then he asked him Philip do you
[41:05] understand what you're
[41:09] reading and he said how can I understand
[41:10] it if there's nobody here to explain it
[41:12] to
[41:16] me so then when we come here how
[41:18] important is it for us to be able to
[41:19] explain what we are
[41:21] talking and for the people to be
[41:24] hearing not only hearing
[41:27] but also
[41:29] understanding and then when we leave
[41:32] here if there is a message that we give
[41:35] them point it down or write it
[41:38] down if there's two or three
[41:41] messages and so then when you arrive
[41:44] home when you have that spare
[41:48] time open your
[41:50] books open your
[41:52] phone or your
[41:55] computer
[41:56] and begin to search out those
[41:59] messages and it'll be much more of a
[42:02] benefit for
[42:04] you and if there was something that
[42:06] maybe we couldn't
[42:08] explain but we gave you the message of
[42:10] the title and you look for
[42:12] it and you ask for
[42:16] god brother you're going to learn a lot
[42:19] more blessed be the name of our
[42:24] Lord and so then Malachi 45 and 6 is the
[42:27] ABCs for
[42:34] us but we must ask God to give us the
[42:37] understanding to understand what he's
[42:38] telling
[42:41] us look Brothers those that come from
[42:44] Mexico I don't know about the other
[42:47] nations but down in
[42:51] Mexico being a young
[42:54] man I would go go out through the
[42:57] streets and I would knock at the
[43:02] doors and the first thing that I would
[43:04] notice when I would go knock at the
[43:07] door and I would notice that that uh the
[43:11] title or that sign that they had at the
[43:14] uh a sort of a
[43:17] sign this place is
[43:23] Catholic if you don't give praise unto
[43:25] Mary
[43:28] don't
[43:30] knock that's
[43:34] simple and quanito instead of leaving
[43:36] he's right there
[43:40] knocking and the first thing that they
[43:41] would ask me because they would notice
[43:42] me with my
[43:44] Bible they would tell me didn't you read
[43:46] the sign out
[43:48] there do you know how to read and I told
[43:51] and didn't you read the
[43:54] sign yeah I read it
[43:59] so then if you don't believe in Mary
[44:00] then why did you
[44:02] knock no well I just wanted to tell you
[44:05] that I do believe in
[44:07] Mary you do believe in
[44:09] Mary how how can I
[44:13] not and so then that would open the door
[44:16] for
[44:19] me so then I would be able to go in
[44:21] there and explain to them the real plan
[44:22] of
[44:24] God and so then when it comes to to
[44:26] explaining and
[44:30] understanding that man said when he saw
[44:32] the
[44:33] water here's some
[44:38] water did do you understand what Philip
[44:40] said to
[44:41] you there's some water right
[44:44] here what's impeding for me to get
[44:47] baptized to his name be all the
[44:51] glory and so then when we accept this
[44:54] message
[44:58] we accept that because it was a
[44:59] revelation of God given unto
[45:04] us or do we believe it because our
[45:07] mother and father believe
[45:10] it because our grandparents also
[45:12] believed
[45:14] it brother in the Evangel the
[45:17] Evangelical work that I used to
[45:22] do I used to run into to people that
[45:24] would tell me I am a Catholic
[45:27] because my parents were
[45:30] catholic and my grandparents were
[45:36] catholic and so then they give you that
[45:38] family history right
[45:44] away but then when you start to ask him
[45:46] about the more profound things of
[45:49] God they don't know how to answer
[45:54] you because they're only only Catholics
[45:56] by just their family
[46:01] history and so then this message should
[46:03] be a revelation unto
[46:06] us I'm not here because my father told
[46:11] me not because of the fathers of my
[46:13] father told
[46:14] them I believe this
[46:16] message because I heard
[46:19] it yeah I understood it to his name be
[46:22] the glory and he deserves it
[46:26] because he's the one that gives us the
[46:28] understanding I understood
[46:31] it and then I had to make my own
[46:34] decision do I stay with my bicycle my
[46:37] motorcycle my house my
[46:42] salary and I was advancing and going up
[46:45] in the
[46:46] denomination
[46:49] or follow this
[46:52] message to come out of the denom the
[46:55] denomination
[46:59] and then when those Brethren that were
[47:01] from the den denomination came and spoke
[47:03] to me I told him I couldn't do it no
[47:06] more and I can't deny what I have
[47:09] received
[47:10] now this is Bible it's right
[47:13] here malakiah 45 is
[47:17] Bible God sent a
[47:21] messenger oh yeah we know that it was
[47:22] John the
[47:24] Baptist that's the that they
[47:27] have they all apply it to John the
[47:33] Baptist when you tell them that it's not
[47:35] only John the bapti but it's another man
[47:37] and that his name is William Mar Bram
[47:40] Brothers they can't see it or they don't
[47:44] believe it they never heard
[47:47] it and if they have heard
[47:51] it they don't want to leave their
[47:54] comfort
[47:56] and brothers when this was a revelation
[47:58] under my life being a young
[48:01] man blessed be the name of the
[48:03] Lord I told
[48:09] God I told them let me just give me the
[48:11] opportunity to be able to dismiss myself
[48:13] from the
[48:14] church and just as I was going
[48:18] outside and they told me they you forgot
[48:21] something the credentials of our
[48:24] denomination and I told him
[48:28] yeah and so then I took it out of my
[48:30] wallet and I handed it to them on the
[48:34] table and I and don't think that I ever
[48:37] came back this is it I'm out of
[48:41] here and then I went back with my
[48:43] parents in the city of
[48:46] Mexico because my mother had died when I
[48:49] was just a young
[48:50] child and so then in
[48:54] Mexico
[48:57] then I started to uh uh learn about the
[49:00] different brothers from the message
[49:01] Alfredo gonzale our brother Alfredo
[49:04] Gonzalez brother Jose
[49:06] Hernandez brother
[49:08] Anaya the great man of
[49:10] God brother
[49:13] fail brother Andres Perez from
[49:17] [Applause]
[49:19] veruz I began to meet new brothers from
[49:22] the
[49:24] message and began to visit and
[49:26] congregate with
[49:28] them and so then I believe with all my
[49:33] heart that the message of the hour must
[49:35] be a revelation unto
[49:37] you I believe this
[49:40] message and that's what you should
[49:43] say I believe this
[49:46] message because God has revealed it to
[49:49] me because I've searched the scriptures
[49:52] I've seen
[49:53] it and now I believe it with with all my
[49:56] heart and when God reveals it unto
[50:01] you nobody and absolutely nobody will be
[50:03] able to take it out of your heart
[50:05] blessed be the name of the
[50:07] Lord my
[50:12] messenger and this is what scoffield
[50:15] says it's John the
[50:18] Baptist the angel of the
[50:23] Covenant the angel of the Covenant is
[50:25] Christ and and both
[50:27] comings and his both
[50:36] comings now let's open up our scriptures
[50:38] and read another uh
[50:41] scripture and may the Lord help us this
[50:47] evening I have a lot of them and I have
[50:50] to
[50:54] choose
[50:57] now that we're on Malachi 3 we're just
[50:58] going to flip the page over to Malachi
[51:01] 4 verses 5 and
[51:04] six remember this is the ABCs for
[51:07] us but perhaps there might be somebody
[51:11] online there might be a young man or
[51:13] young
[51:16] lady look the sister that contacted me
[51:19] from
[51:19] [Applause]
[51:21] colia she once uh assisted to the
[51:24] Pentecostal
[51:28] Church even uh the apostolic church I'm
[51:33] sorry but then one way or another she
[51:35] found out or got in contact with
[51:36] brothers from
[51:39] Phoenix and she came and she visited the
[51:42] Tabernacle because she spoke with me and
[51:45] she gave me a little bit of her
[51:48] backstory but she says uh brother
[51:51] Kito the
[51:54] message
[51:57] I never forgot
[51:58] it I uh went to
[52:03] Colombia and I went and I visited many
[52:06] uh message
[52:08] churches and so may the Lord bless our
[52:12] sister that the Lord Finally Revealed
[52:14] the
[52:15] message and she came out of the
[52:20] denomination because you can't pertain
[52:22] or continue to be in a denomination
[52:27] that's where the hard part
[52:33] is and uh especially when you have a
[52:36] house and everything already built
[52:38] up and when the denomination is the one
[52:40] that provides it for you it's very hard
[52:43] for you to turn your back on it but then
[52:45] when it's God to his name be
[52:49] glory we're going to leave everything
[52:52] behind because Paul said that we brought
[52:55] nothing under this
[52:57] world and without a shadow of a doubt
[52:59] we're not going to take anything with
[53:01] us we've seen many
[53:04] funerals and we've come we've come close
[53:06] to the
[53:08] casket and they take absolutely
[53:12] nothing only that suit that the family
[53:15] had dressed them with that's
[53:18] it but they take no money with
[53:21] them everything stays here on
[53:24] Earth
[53:26] and so brothers and sisters may our eyes
[53:28] be on the
[53:30] heavens blessed be the name of the Lord
[53:33] amen
[53:40] Brothers let me just read a a quote
[53:45] here would write it
[53:49] down I'm going to be on page
[53:52] 314 of the fifth
[53:54] seal
[53:58] 314 and it reads like
[54:04] this and it's the fifth
[54:07] seal uh it's going to be paragraph 329
[54:10] and it reads like this
[54:14] notice these men were kept Alive by
[54:18] God from their original
[54:21] Ministry talking about Moses and
[54:23] Elijah or Elijah
[54:25] mes once again
[54:30] notice these men were kept or men are
[54:33] kept the liive by
[54:34] God from their original
[54:38] Ministry for future
[54:41] service Moses
[54:45] died but nobody knows where his grave
[54:48] is only God knows
[54:52] it because many searched for him and
[54:54] they could not find
[54:57] him but Jehovah God did tell
[55:00] Moses come up to this
[55:03] mountain and I'm going to allow you to
[55:05] see the promis
[55:06] land I'm going to allow you to see
[55:10] it what your people are and truly are
[55:12] going
[55:14] to but you shall not
[55:18] enter why is it that Moses or Moses did
[55:20] not go
[55:24] in because god Jehovah told them to
[55:26] speak to the
[55:28] Rock because the people wanted water and
[55:31] there was no
[55:33] water and when there is no
[55:36] water we all know what it's like to be
[55:40] thirsty maybe some
[55:42] don't because we have water in in
[55:47] abundance but there are people here that
[55:50] know what it's like to be thirsty to his
[55:52] name be the
[55:54] glory so the order was to speak to the
[55:57] Rock and if he would have spoken to the
[56:01] Rock brothers that water would have
[56:03] flowed out of that rock to his name be
[56:06] the
[56:10] glory when God came down talking to the
[56:16] prophet and he told him where do you
[56:18] want the
[56:19] squirrels he chose
[56:23] three with three I think you can make a
[56:25] really good
[56:30] soup and he was in a location that was
[56:32] kind of
[56:33] impossible but he asked one for in this
[56:36] location and there it
[56:42] was and so then when Jehovah told Moses
[56:45] to speak
[56:48] to the waters would have came flushing
[56:50] out of that
[56:52] rock all right well that was mooses
[56:55] once
[56:57] again and it says like this think of
[57:02] it just think that Spirit of Elijah
[57:04] ministers five
[57:06] times I really like the
[57:09] numbers I don't know who else likes to
[57:11] do
[57:13] mathematics throughout the message and
[57:15] throughout the
[57:16] Bible I like the
[57:19] numbers and I also like the
[57:23] names
[57:28] and if we are Christians we're going to
[57:29] give a Christian name to our sons and
[57:32] daughters and a couple years
[57:34] ago I went to a
[57:37] school my uh wife is the one that goes I
[57:40] hardly
[57:41] go but in that morning I was very
[57:43] interested in
[57:45] going and they were calling out the
[57:47] children by their
[57:48] names and their last name their second
[57:51] name and I was there for my
[57:53] granddaughter
[57:56] and then I hear the person that who
[57:57] announcing the
[58:00] names and I hear the name of a of a
[58:02] young lady and it reads like this
[58:04] marijuana Martinez uh marijuana Martinez
[58:08] I see just like that marijuana Martinez
[58:11] marijuana
[58:13] Martinez marijana is there somebody here
[58:16] with the name
[58:19] marijuana Brothers I was very
[58:22] shocked I looked at my wife and I and
[58:24] and I tell her what did you hear what I
[58:27] heard marijuana Martinez marijuana
[58:31] Martinez what kind of name is
[58:34] that that's why I tell you that I like
[58:37] the
[58:37] names but that name I it dis I
[58:42] dis and I will never put that name onto
[58:44] any of my
[58:47] kids the names also have a
[58:50] very strong impact on the
[58:53] person and the prophet was coming in
[58:56] from
[58:57] Canada and he was traveling through a
[59:02] road and he heard a voice say turn to
[59:05] the
[59:08] Eastward and he began to count and he
[59:11] saw Seven Hills seven
[59:16] mountains and he says how many how many
[59:18] letters are in your name seven brothers
[59:23] seven
[59:26] and so the numbers are also very
[59:28] important and also the names
[59:33] Jacob Prince of
[59:37] God well when his name was
[59:40] changed
[59:42] amen because he was a a
[59:45] Shyer he deceived his
[59:48] father and he obtained the the
[59:52] preeminence but then when he battled
[59:54] wrestle with the
[59:56] angel your name shall no longer be Jacob
[59:59] but
[1:00:01] Israel which means Prince with God am
[1:00:08] amen and
[1:00:13] so that Spirit of
[1:00:15] Elijah ministers five
[1:00:18] times Moses
[1:00:22] 2 neither of them were
[1:00:26] dead don't you believe that they were
[1:00:30] dead they were both
[1:00:35] alive talking with Jesus on Mount
[1:00:38] Transfiguration but then also
[1:00:41] remember they must also
[1:00:47] die and then when brother bam is saying
[1:00:49] that remember that they must
[1:00:52] die without a shadow of a doubt he takes
[1:00:54] us to Revelations
[1:00:58] 112 their bodies shall be lay down on
[1:01:00] the roads of
[1:01:02] Jerusalem for three and a half
[1:01:04] days
[1:01:07] tremendous the Lord bless us and help us
[1:01:09] Amen to his name be all the
[1:01:14] glory we're going to go on to the
[1:01:18] next in the same book of Revel uh the
[1:01:21] seven the seven
[1:01:23] SE and we're going to go into the
[1:01:25] message uh God hiding himself in
[1:01:28] Simplicity page
[1:01:34] 26 now let's proceed so we can finish
[1:01:36] here within the next 20
[1:01:39] minutes which is something that we
[1:01:42] also now notice the the day of
[1:01:48] Elijah God chose to hide in somebody
[1:01:51] that was
[1:01:52] simple think about it
[1:01:56] this was God's
[1:01:59] choosing remember in those days there
[1:02:01] were many rabbis many
[1:02:04] priests and great
[1:02:07] men even the great king Ahab was a
[1:02:11] Jew and there were many men of much
[1:02:15] Fame but God decided to hide himself in
[1:02:18] a simple
[1:02:19] man not in a
[1:02:22] scholar or a well-known man in the
[1:02:26] world like a general in a
[1:02:30] military he wasn't of a famous
[1:02:35] name for we didn't even know who his
[1:02:38] parents
[1:02:43] were and even uh scoffield stays a bit
[1:02:47] brief about that
[1:02:48] name there is no
[1:02:51] genealogy we don't know who his parents
[1:02:53] were
[1:02:56] who were the parents of John the
[1:02:58] Baptist zaras and
[1:03:01] Elizabeth to his name be all the glory
[1:03:04] we read it it's
[1:03:09] Bible and we read the Bible and we find
[1:03:11] out that we know that there is a
[1:03:14] genealogy we know who the parents of
[1:03:16] Moses
[1:03:17] were to his name be the
[1:03:20] glory but about Elijah we don't
[1:03:23] know
[1:03:25] and so that's the
[1:03:28] truth and it reads like this he wasn't a
[1:03:31] very famous
[1:03:33] man but we know not even know who his
[1:03:35] parents
[1:03:37] were we know nothing about his
[1:03:42] genealogy he was a simple
[1:03:45] Woodsman from those
[1:03:48] places who was uh
[1:03:53] raised with the purpose of being a
[1:03:57] prophet God prepared
[1:04:00] everything God prepared young
[1:04:03] Samuel Anna his
[1:04:06] mother couldn't have
[1:04:10] children and when she would go to the
[1:04:12] temple she would always go and pray to
[1:04:14] God if you give me a
[1:04:16] son I'll dedicate him to your
[1:04:20] service and then the Bible
[1:04:23] says better for us to not
[1:04:26] uh make a promise and not fulfill it and
[1:04:29] if we
[1:04:31] promise let us fulfill it
[1:04:35] quickly and I've told the Lord
[1:04:39] Lord put in my
[1:04:43] heart and help the company that I'm
[1:04:45] working
[1:04:47] with that instead of starting at 11:00
[1:04:51] p.m. that we may start at 1: or 2: a.m.
[1:04:56] until this day it hasn't gone this way
[1:04:59] but I keep trusting in the
[1:05:02] Lord and I ask him help me to be able to
[1:05:04] attend on
[1:05:07] Wednesdays because I want to have
[1:05:09] fellowship with my brothers and
[1:05:11] sisters blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:17] Brothers we want fellowship with one
[1:05:19] another as he yes amen amen this
[1:05:27] uh talking about Elijah with the purpose
[1:05:28] of being a
[1:05:32] prophet God had a living alone out in
[1:05:34] the
[1:05:37] desert and the only thing that we know
[1:05:39] is that he came out of the
[1:05:41] desert and he condemned the
[1:05:43] ecclesiastical system that they
[1:05:46] had let me finish here and then I'll
[1:05:48] tell you
[1:05:49] something that when he comes out of the
[1:05:53] desert
[1:05:55] knowing that he was a prophet of
[1:05:59] God to be able to go up to a King and
[1:06:01] tell him straight into his
[1:06:08] face that a judgment was coming towards
[1:06:10] him and his people and his
[1:06:12] kingdom it wasn't something very
[1:06:16] easy it's like today if I want to go to
[1:06:19] the White
[1:06:23] House
[1:06:24] and brothers I won't even be able to
[1:06:26] reach it because of so many obstacles
[1:06:27] that they have we wouldn't be able
[1:06:30] to there's people that try to go in
[1:06:33] there but they can't they crash their
[1:06:35] vehicles at the gate there's so much
[1:06:38] security
[1:06:42] around and according to the world it's
[1:06:44] the most important nation of the
[1:06:47] world so it's sort of impossible to go
[1:06:49] and see the president but over
[1:06:53] there he was the prophet of
[1:06:56] God and when he would come out of the
[1:07:01] desert he would come and arrive to be
[1:07:03] able to say what the Lord had
[1:07:07] given and that's when he presented
[1:07:09] himself in the presence of Ahab and he
[1:07:12] told
[1:07:13] him there shall be no rain for three
[1:07:17] years until I call for it what kind of
[1:07:21] authority is
[1:07:22] that until I call for
[1:07:26] it blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:07:29] that's how it was and that's what
[1:07:34] happened and then when that judgment had
[1:07:38] passed Ahab found himself with Elijah
[1:07:46] again and he told him to hurry and get
[1:07:49] back into his Carriage because there was
[1:07:50] a big rainstorm coming this way to his
[1:07:53] name be the
[1:07:57] glory and so then he was the prophet of
[1:08:00] God am
[1:08:05] amen and so we're going to read another
[1:08:08] scripture it's going to be on Second
[1:08:13] Kings we're going to pass
[1:08:17] Elijah and we're going to go
[1:08:20] uh Second Kings
[1:08:22] 2:19
[1:08:27] glor glory be to his
[1:08:30] name Second
[1:08:33] Kings
[1:08:37] 29 if you find it if you would mind
[1:08:40] saying
[1:08:42] amen glory to
[1:08:49] God Second
[1:08:52] Kings
[1:08:56] 2:19 and it reads like
[1:09:01] this forgive me I'm in
[1:09:11] Chronicles and it reads like
[1:09:17] this and the man of the city said unto
[1:09:22] Elisha
[1:09:26] uh I pray thee the situation of the city
[1:09:27] is
[1:09:29] uh Second Kings yeah uh chapter 2 see uh
[1:09:34] verse 9
[1:09:41] oh and it came to pass when they were
[1:09:44] gone over that Elisha said unto Elisha
[1:09:48] ask what I shall do for
[1:09:52] thee
[1:09:54] before I be taken away from thee and
[1:09:56] Elisha said I pray thee a let a double
[1:09:58] portion of thy Spirit be upon
[1:10:01] me and he said thou has asked a hard
[1:10:07] thing nevertheless if thou see me when I
[1:10:10] am taken from thee it shall be so unto
[1:10:12] you
[1:10:20] thee and it came to pass as they uh
[1:10:23] still went on on and talked that behold
[1:10:25] uh there appeared a chariot of fire and
[1:10:27] Horses of
[1:10:33] fire and parted uh them both saw Su and
[1:10:36] Elijah went up to the by the world went
[1:10:38] into heaven and Elijah saw it and he
[1:10:40] cried my father my father The Chariot of
[1:10:42] Israel and the horsemen of
[1:10:46] thereof and he saw him no more and he
[1:10:49] took hold of his own clothes and rent
[1:10:51] them into two
[1:10:52] pieces
[1:10:58] he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[1:11:00] that fell from him and went back and
[1:11:01] stood by the bank of the
[1:11:09] Jordan brothers that he stood and took
[1:11:12] the mantle that he took from
[1:11:15] Elijah and the River Jordan opened up in
[1:11:18] two
[1:11:22] ways and remember the prophet said we're
[1:11:24] going to use that anointing five
[1:11:27] times God will be using that anointing
[1:11:30] five times he used it in
[1:11:32] Elijah he used it in
[1:11:35] Elisha and now we're going to return
[1:11:37] back to Malachi
[1:11:39] 4 and let's read verse 5 and
[1:11:44] six behold I will send you the Prophet
[1:11:49] Elijah before the coming of the great
[1:11:51] and Dreadful day of the
[1:11:52] Lord
[1:11:54] that
[1:12:00] uh and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:12:03] fathers to the
[1:12:06] children and the Heart of the children
[1:12:08] to their
[1:12:10] fathers L I come and smite the Earth
[1:12:13] with a
[1:12:17] curse and so we know that in verse six
[1:12:19] in the message it pertains to two
[1:12:22] coming
[1:12:24] John the Baptist uh announcing the first
[1:12:29] coming and the Elijah of our day
[1:12:31] announcing the second
[1:12:35] coming and when brother bam was
[1:12:37] baptizing in the Ohio river in
[1:12:40] 1933 and when I was walking over here I
[1:12:43] was waiting for my
[1:12:46] brother and I noticed that there was a
[1:12:48] couple of pictures up on the
[1:12:51] wall and there we see brother bam in the
[1:12:54] Ohio River
[1:12:55] baptizing and I said glory to
[1:12:58] God and there was a voice that was
[1:13:02] heard and there was a voice
[1:13:05] heard and when Jesus was
[1:13:08] baptized in the Jordan
[1:13:11] River there was also a voice that was
[1:13:15] heard this is my beloved
[1:13:18] Son to his name be the
[1:13:22] glory
[1:13:24] and so then Jesus was supposed to be
[1:13:26] baptized and he was
[1:13:28] baptized and there was a voice
[1:13:33] heard and brother Bram being in the Ohio
[1:13:36] River we also heard a voice
[1:13:39] there just as uh John the
[1:13:43] Baptist was a forerunner of my first
[1:13:47] coming you are sent with a
[1:13:50] message that will forerun my second
[1:13:52] coming
[1:13:54] we believe
[1:13:56] it that's an ABC for all of
[1:14:00] us and why is it that I'm repeating it
[1:14:02] and saying
[1:14:05] it we've said it many times and our
[1:14:07] brothers have preached
[1:14:11] it our brother Octavio brought this
[1:14:13] teaching about two months
[1:14:15] ago and I have it in my
[1:14:18] notes and he spoke to us about these
[1:14:20] five
[1:14:22] Ministries and so then this is just a
[1:14:25] repetition so that we do not
[1:14:29] forget because this teaching should be
[1:14:31] already engraved in
[1:14:33] us not to believe it because my mother
[1:14:36] believes
[1:14:37] it not to believe it because my father
[1:14:39] believes
[1:14:40] it and I fear that some of us that
[1:14:44] believe this
[1:14:45] message only because they're
[1:14:48] father and it has not been a revelation
[1:14:50] to their
[1:14:52] life and that's the reason why there's
[1:14:54] still problems in our
[1:14:57] lives we can't take out those things
[1:14:59] that we need to take
[1:15:01] out because brother once we empty
[1:15:03] ourselves
[1:15:06] completely and so then we can now fill
[1:15:08] ourselves with something to his name be
[1:15:10] the
[1:15:13] glory we need to empty ourselves
[1:15:15] completely of
[1:15:17] everything so that he can come and fill
[1:15:19] us with his word with the message
[1:15:25] and then to be able to say as that uh
[1:15:27] woman
[1:15:29] said we no longer believe just by your
[1:15:32] saying said the
[1:15:37] woman uh the woman said we know that the
[1:15:39] the Messiah is
[1:15:42] coming and when he comes he's going to
[1:15:44] we know that he's going to tell us all
[1:15:45] these things and hear me
[1:15:49] brothers and when he comes he's going to
[1:15:51] tell us all these things and Jesus told
[1:15:55] her I
[1:15:57] am who speaks with
[1:16:00] you blessed be the name of the
[1:16:03] Lord I am the one who speaks with you to
[1:16:06] his name be the
[1:16:09] glory that's why she left her bucket and
[1:16:11] she ran into
[1:16:13] Samaria and gave the news to
[1:16:18] everybody and no and she said we no
[1:16:21] longer Believe by your say
[1:16:25] but now we have seen it and heard it to
[1:16:27] his name be all the
[1:16:29] glory
[1:16:31] amen may the Lord bless us and help
[1:16:34] us there's so much to be able to
[1:16:39] say and I said that I'm going to try to
[1:16:41] take advantage of the time and I think I
[1:16:44] am may the Lord help us and bless
[1:16:49] us I left many things unconcluded but I
[1:16:51] think we should leave it for the next
[1:16:52] time
[1:16:55] how many of you are
[1:16:58] happy let us stand and if the musicians
[1:17:00] can come
[1:17:02] up us remember this is just the
[1:17:08] ABCs this is the message that maintains
[1:17:11] Us Alive God
[1:17:14] first but this is the message that gives
[1:17:17] us the strength and the courage to his
[1:17:19] name be all the glory am amen
[1:17:24] has it been a revelation to your
[1:17:27] life Malachi
[1:17:30] 45 has concluded in this
[1:17:33] day let pray Heavenly
[1:17:39] Father Lord this was just a simple
[1:17:46] preaching something that all of us could
[1:17:51] understand although we left many things
[1:18:00] undone but I'm trusting that those
[1:18:02] brothers that know where it's at will
[1:18:04] run to
[1:18:06] it those Brethren that are watching
[1:18:11] online I'm sure that they already know
[1:18:14] these
[1:18:16] things but if if it was possible to help
[1:18:19] at least one of
[1:18:20] them Lord there's no price to this
[1:18:24] because one
[1:18:27] soul is many millions and millions of
[1:18:30] Worlds there is no
[1:18:33] price and so then we thank you for this
[1:18:36] message that you have given
[1:18:39] us for those five
[1:18:42] anointings and we know
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:46] Lord that the fourth
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:49] anointing was amongst us
[1:18:54] amongst
[1:18:55] us he traveled throughout the
[1:18:59] world and the people
[1:19:02] noticed and now we are
[1:19:05] here we thank you
[1:19:09] Lord because nothing what he did was in
[1:19:12] vain we thank
[1:19:17] you bless each and every one of them
[1:19:19] that could be here
[1:19:21] tonight
[1:19:23] and bless those that weren't able to
[1:19:25] make
[1:19:29] it and Lord if our pastor is still a bit
[1:19:32] weak in
[1:19:33] health or is out of
[1:19:36] town we ask that you help
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:44] him if he's a bit weak in his health we
[1:19:47] ask that you give him
[1:19:49] Health we ask that you touch him that
[1:19:51] you raise him up
[1:19:55] and every single one of them else
[1:19:59] also we place all these things into your
[1:20:03] hands in the precious name of our Lord
