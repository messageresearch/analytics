all joy and you bring them back home as well we put them into your hands and we place the service into your hands in the name that's above all names in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we're going to be reading one scripture it's found in Ephesians [Music] 1 verses 3 to 5 [Music] uh uh Ephesians chap 1 verse 3- 5 and it reads in this [Music] manner lessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings and and Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ him to himself according to the good pleasure of his will the Lord add the reading of his word and may the Lord also bless the musicians for the work we're going to be taking a subject this evening which I would like to entitle it the manifestations of sons of God for the adoption the manifestation of the sons of God for adoption our pastor has been preaching um according to the subject of adoption and I believe it's a really deep subject and very extent but also very important the adoption the word adoption means uh location or uh the uh uh placing thank you we become the sons of God adopted by Jesus Christ how many of you know that God only has one son and that son is our Lord Jesus Christ we come to be children but adopt the children through our Lord Jesus Christ and then after going through a process then that's when we become adopted I'm going to go to the beginning so I can place a foundation here it's called the plan of God God had many plans The Plan of Salvation and restoration and in him were many attributes the attribute of being a father of being a son and also being the Holy Spirit to be a Healer to be a restorer there were many attributes to him and then and the only manner that he could be able to demonstrate or or play these roles he had to manifest it so in order for him to be a Healer first of all there had to be somebody to be heal in order for him to be able to hear in order for him to be able to be a savior there first of all had to be somebody to be lost in order for him to be a savior so that he can find that person who was lost so in the in that manner God started to to display his characteristics the word god means an object of worship so in order for him to be God there had to be somebody to worship him so in that manner he started to create the Angels the cherubin and the sarapin and all of the Heavenly Creatures and in the midst of all of that he created man he created the universe and he also created the Earth and in his mind he had the thought of creating man so God created this Earth so that man could live in this and so then when we come to see that when he created his Garden of Eden where he had headquarters here on Earth it was eternity there was peace there was no sicknesses and there was absolutely nothing to hinder man and so then when we go back to see how God created uh the creation God created the man he created the first Adam and he placed him there on Earth so that he can govern it so that he placed the man there so he can pretty much govern over all living creatures over beast and fish and everything that he had created and so then once we go back to reading the story of Adam and Eve how the fall came to be and then we come to see that the great battle had started back when Lucifer was around and then we come to see how he was cast out of heaven and was here on Earth and then in that man he's got and Anointed The Serpent and the prophet teaches us that it wasn't a reptile but a man it was a man who thought and the Bible says that he was the the wisest of all creatures and we come to see that the intelligence of this how he seduced Eve and then that's where the fall came to be that's where we find that that's where we try to go back to to return where we came from when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden they were hidden behind a holy Veil and they were controlled by a divine nature and in there there was no sicknesses or anything to hinder them but but then after the fall came that's and then after that fall that's when they were uh exiled from the garden of v and so we come to see that man has tried to return back to that state of being being in that divine nature trying to avoid being in this Fallen nature that we're in and return back to that divine nature that it once had through our Lord Jesus Christ and so we see that God in his plan wanted to restore restore all things and he sent his son onto the Earth with the mission that he would be able to fulfill out that purpose and as we see that he fulfilled his part so then it falls in our lot to be able to fulfill that purpose in our Liv and it's through a a certain process for us to be able to complete it and so God began to see throughout all the Earth who would be worthy of this work and he saw that the Angels weren't able to do it since they were from a different [Music] race and the Animals weren't able to accomplish it and so it turns out that he was the one that had to come down and do the job and create himself a costume or a man for him to dwell in in order for him to be able to have compassion and feel what we feel and so he came through our Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus didn't come as a grown man as the first Adam was he started all the way from the beginning as a little baby and so then God commanded this work to create Jesus being a baby unto Joseph and Mary and I believe Mary and Joseph were very exemplary uh parents because through them Jesus Christ was born and they educated Jesus and so we come to see that in order for us to be adopted we have to be under tutors and we see that the tutors of Jesus were was Mary and Joseph and they only had the responsibility to make sure that Jesus had to learn what he had to learn and I believe that they did a really good job Jesus was born [Music] and when the king wanted to kill him and get rid of him then they left onto Egypt and they returned back and then we don't hear anything about Jesus until after the age of about around 12 years old and we come to see that Jesus was already in his father's business and my question is at the age of 12 years old what were we doing and so since he is our example at the age of 12 he was already preaching and we see that he's in the temple and all the priests and uh that were there they were all amazed at the wisdom that this young child had and so when Joseph and Mary went to go seek for Jesus and Jesus replied unto them is do you see not that it's uh that I'm about my father's business so we come to see that God was Jesus's father and we come to see that Mary and Joseph were only his teachers and so his life went out all the way through in this until he came unto a complete maturing and so we see that he had to go through different stages in his life we see that Jesus had to be baptized by his cousin John he was wasn't a child anymore Joseph and Mary went to go look for him at the temple but when Jesus went to go get baptized uh Mary and Joseph were no longer there because he was already at a much mature age and so when he was baptized then there he received the Holy Ghost and we see that the Bible says that the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove and we hear a voice uh calling out saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in and so then we see that right then and there he received the Holy Ghost and ever since then he started his ministry and so we find out that Jesus also had to be adopted and if we go back into uh the mount Transfiguration we see then there that's when he was adopted and we're going to read it in Luke chapter 9 uh chapter 9 verse 28 and it reads like this and it came to pass at about an eight days after these sayings he took Peter and John and James and went up to the mountain to pray and as you can see here he took three Witnesses and as he prayed uh the fashion of his count uh countenance was altered and his reignment was as white and glistering and behold there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elias and we see here that he had two more witnesses here that were Celestial and are Earthly who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jer but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him yeah and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias not knowing what he said while he said while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they were feared as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear ye hear ye him Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River by John and there we see that he received the Holy Ghost and yet he was not adopted and then we come to find out over here in this part the same voice when he said that this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in and then we see in this other verse that it says this is my beloved Son hear him and it was at this point that he was adopted and all authority was handed onto him he was already placed in position and as brother Brandon says as the father adopts the son then now the the voice of the son is just as good as the fathers and all the decisions that the son makes the father is pleased in agreement with him uh for he has been already adopted in place and so for him to be adopted he first had to go through a [Music] process and in the same manner just as us if we want to be adopted then we must this process and so in order to be adopted we first have to have the new birth might be able to say that we're the sons of God but just by saying it does not guarantee that we are because it could just be a mental conception that just because I come to church that does not want to mean or say anything because I believe the Catholics and all different denominations they all go to church but that does not guarantee that we are the children of God we must first be recognized and adopted by the Lord Jesus Christ and so we must go through this process and it's very necessary for us to be born again it is very essential important that we must be born again and if there is no birth then there is no child uh so I'm going to explain the process of how a human being comes under Earth it is the mixing of both masculine and feminine uh genes that unite and and then there is a conception that takes place and we see that that takes into place and it takes form of an embryo thank and we see in the process of after N9 months then we see that it begins to uh make its uh process or progress so potentially that will be a child that comes on Earth but you can't call it a a child because it's not born yet and it is a very dangerous process because there could be an abortion and so when you are kind um begotten sorry uh end the gospel then we see that that's sort of the process of the fetus being born inside the the womb and just as as I said there could be an abortion and so then when a mother is pregnated that is a life that is given by God and what must that uh woman do that woman shouldn't do anything but take care of herself and feed herself well so in the same manner when we become begotten into the gospel that we' have accepted this message uh we shouldn't be doing much because uh that's part of the birth we just need to take care of ourselves take care ourselves of the things of the world not participating in the things of the world and feeding yourself off of it or feed yourself with the word and so that we could be fed by the word and it comes point to where that mother has to be born or that mother has to give birth and then in that point then we can say that there has been a birth we can then say that there has been a son now and just because the son was born doesn't mean that the job is completely done now that child has to be has to grow up has to mature and as it grows it begins to experiment a lot of pain a lot of growing pains and as we see that a child has one or two years we call them at those terrible twos because they don't really understand much so then they only go according to what their nature is and that's the reason why the as us as parents must be there to be able to take take care of them because they can't take care of of themselves they're growing up and they have the tendency of making a lot of mistakes and then they they grow up to a part of being a teenager and then those are the most crucial moments that you have to go through because now you've gone into to the transition of being a young man or a young woman so we see that the natural is a type of the spiritual and in the spiritual we see that we see the same process that we must be inher uh inherited with until the adoption if there is a no if there is no New Birth then there is no child and when the child is born the child of God the the process isn't done yet the thing is that they must mature and go through all the processes until the adoption and then in order to be born again and here's the key to it uh we must first die die to ourselves and that's the one thing that humans don't like to do or we don't like to do or the time hasn't arrived for us to die and that's what Jesus told Nicodemus in order to have life you must first be bornn again but in order to be born again you first have to die and that's the problem with us is that we don't want to die we want eternal life but we don't want to pay the price and that is the price that we must pay in order for us to be able to inherit that adoption uh and I see just as David encountered himself with that great Philistine with Goliath and we see that David was a man after man after God's Own Heart and he already defeated a bear and a lion and so his faith was so great that he had already a record or a history of destroying those beasts and so in his mind he thought since I already defeated the The Lion and the bear then surely I could defeat this Goliath who was in front of him and so we see that we don't just have one Goliath but we have many goliaths one of those goliaths is the uh anger or resentment the hate the anger the jealousy the uh bitterness and all those things that are hindering us in our lives and just as the Bible says that uh let us lay aside all uh weight and sin that easily besets us that we may run with patience this race that's set before us the race that's set before us which is the life of a Christian and so then that manner we can serve God even better and so we must come to that adoption in order for us to be manifested sons of God and unfortunately there will be millions of people that will be cast out to the lake of fire but there will also be a lot of people that are saved people that are predestinated to be part of the bride and then there's people that will be predestinated to be a part of the foolish bride and the 144,000 and just as the the thief that was at the cross in his last moments there in his last moments he had his opportunity and he was saved and those that give a go cold glass of water to the bride those people without even knowing they will have eternal life but our goal is to be part of the bride and I believe that that's our goal and everybody or everyone here to not be part of the foolish bride and even brother bam says that being part of a foolish Bride is a great thing because the word virgin is to be chased and clean that doesn't contaminate with the things of this world but from the forn knowledge of God and the election of God the bride is special and brother brandham tells us that the remnant it has that the same material is the same and that same material is has the same color and texture and the same quality is the same material uh but by the election of God he takes that pattern he takes it he draws it out on on that material and he cuts it out for the bride and so the remnant of that piece is now laid aside but God still wants to keep that piece of Remnant that that was taken out of the bride and so being part of the foolish bride is also a big deal and I've heard commentary from other people that end up stating that if they don't make it to be part of the Bride then at least they would like to be part of the foolish uh being part of the foolish B just as I said previously it is almost uh there is still a virgin and so then that's our goal to be uh to be able to accomplish the being part of the Bride although it is part of being the election of God and God wants us to be part of the Bride and in order for that to happen we first have to be born again and so when Jesus Christ came on the earth and ascended up when he came down to earth and ascended up and he sent the Holy Ghost to uh lead us onto all righteousness and Truth uh and the Holy Spirit being a gentleman the Bible states that he who started the work is going to finish it but that all depends on each and every one of us because God being a gentleman he will never Force us to do something that we don't want because they come and it falls in our lot for us to do that now he did his part in Redeeming the humanity and he paid the price for Humanity and now we must pay the price in the same manner if it is truly that we want to be adopted and it's something that we most of us don't want to pay we want to be part of the Bride we want the benefits but we don't want to pay the price and so so we must first surrender ourselves to the word to The Obedience of the Holy Spirit and to live such a life that the people out in the world can see the person of Jesus Christ in our own lives it's very easy to be able to say it but it takes something really special in order to accomplish it and especially in these times where it's really easy to get distracted and now we know that we're leaving where we are currently living in the end time and the devil as rowing lion he's seeking who he may devour and if we're not ready that storm is going to take us the uh the storm of the world now this is an individual walk it is not a group effort like the uh the people of Israel but then once you fulfill your part then you must give account unto God and then it it's no longer under the responsibilities of the parents now it's no longer under the mercy of the blood now it's under your own conscience and so then when a young man or young woman comes up to that age then they must take their own decision of giving their lives unto God and then we must have in in our minds that this is an individual walk and in that day the husband won't be there the wife or the pastor won't be there the deacons or the elders it would only be you and God on that day and so it falls on all of our lots that one day we're going to come down to earth and we have a certain amount of time before we have to leave this earth it's only a breath a breath away and then we're going to find ourselves with the reality of things this is only but just a foreshadow in reality of what is to come and it would be a sad thing that after knowing this message that we have failed the target so as long as there's life there's still hope and we have to battle if we wish to reign with him let us stand so we can go into prayer if the musicians can come up let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we ask for Mercy the judgments are quickly arriving and we ask you once again just as Samson did that you help us that we may make an inventory of our lives and that we may correct our lives and that we may surrender to your word and leave the things of this world and that we may stop flirting with the world and die to ourselves we thank you for your word thank you for this precious message that you sent us and father we couldn't find ourselves with anything better than this permit us father to embrace it and every day we live it and put it into our lives and that we may not just be hearers of this word may we be doers of this word because uh Works without faith is a dead faith and a dead faith is worth for nothing if I say that I believe and I put uh and I don't put to work your word then I come to be a liar permit Lord that every it might being be surrendered unto you help us as a church as a [Music] group as brothers and sisters to take care of each other to love one another and respect one another to respect the elders the pastor the deacons the ushers and most of all to respect one another this walk isn't easy [Music] Lord but greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world permit us father to cry [Music] out and give us the strength to continue on and we ask you all these things in that name that's above all names in the name of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen of hand so kind and tender they're leading me in P that I must R oh I have no fear cu Jesus walks beside me oh for I'm
