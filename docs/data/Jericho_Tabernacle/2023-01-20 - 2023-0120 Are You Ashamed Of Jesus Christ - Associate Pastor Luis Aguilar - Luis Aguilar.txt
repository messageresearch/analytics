up our scriptures in the book of Saint Marks the eighth chapter the 34th verse um I'd like to thank our pastor Brothers for the trust he allows us to speak to the to the youth tonight and it's so nice to see each and every single one of you amen if you have it if you can please say Amen it's nice that there's still people that have Bibles [Music] you know sometimes in the audience you see people with their phones but it's nice to have the old-fashioned Bible and it says like this and when he had called the people onto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me [Music] for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall a prophet a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul soul foreign [Music] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words and this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with his Holy Angels amen you may take your seats like to thank our musicians and our Our Song leaders in every single one of you for for welcoming the Lord Jesus Christ are you really happy to be be here in the house of the Lord tonight amen that's a really good thing to be in the house of the Lord and find ourselves here on Friday night it's nice that the young people are here it's nice that the parents are accompanying their young people it's very beautiful to see that yes our title our subject for tonight very simple down to earth message I would like to entitle it as Are you ashamed of Jesus Christ it's a question that's being asked and if there's a question there has to be an answer and the question is or are you ashamed of Jesus Christ a lot of people today aren't ashamed of Jesus Christ may the Lord help us tonight um here I got some some definitions definitions and I as you've noticed my pattern on how I am you see yeah I like to get the definition I like to look for synonyms to to grab or understand the scriptures or brother Branham a lot more better foreign [Music] in other words you're embarrassed because you're you're you're you're you're you're associated with this group you feel shame a disgrace and the synonyms you're regretful is you're uncomfortable you're humiliated I hope we don't feel like that when it comes down to the Lord Jesus Christ but I believe that each and every single one of us here has felt a certain shame or certain embarrassment as we're growing up and as a young young folks the young people in Los hovenes as they're going to school and you know as you know when they're here as little kids at church it's normal it's normal it's common for the young ladies to wear skirts not wear any makeup and for the young man not to speak on a foul language but the moment when they get into that middle school age of six to eight seven eighth grade elementary but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens today but they start to ask why do you wear skirts and that question brings us a form of embarrassment yes you feel uncomfortable because you don't want to if you feel odd and out of place man why don't you why don't you come with us to the movie theaters on Friday nights why don't you talk like this and it brings us a certain form of being uncomfortable because you're associating with the Christians today and there you begin to have this complex that are you ashamed of Jesus Christ we hear stories and testimonies sisters today when they were younger we hear stories that when they would uh have their have their skirts on uh underneath they'll have pants and once they got to school foreign and I believe that each and every single one of us has felt a certain shame but I we shouldn't be ashamed of Jesus Christ and hopefully by the end of tonight each and every single one of us and the young people especially to carry the cross and not be ashamed of Jesus Christ now we're going to read a quote here he says now the word of Shame could be translated as embarrassed you know something that something your face was something that you're embarrassed about being ashamed then another thing being ashamed does it shows that you're not sure what you're talking about if you know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about you can tell anybody that you're not ashamed but you feel you feel put out out of place it shows that you're not sure so the prophet is telling us the one of the reasons why we feel ashamed because we're not sure and what we believe in is we're not sure of what we what we are here at church your parents know why they're here your parents know who they're believing in is but the question is do you know what you're believing in do you know uh why we're here because that's why we fall ashamed when the question is asked to us at schools why don't you do this why don't you do this because you're not sure when you have an insurance you know what you're talking about you're not embarrassed to tell them what you believe in notes but until that moment you're only barring your parents convictions Padre amen is notice today if someone says are you I don't know it's a very much a popular thing oh I'm a Christianity for the very very popular today this is 19 65 we're talking about bring it here in a 2023. say something very raw and directly but you have these people who are uh homosexuals today existence who are transgenders today Cristiano barriers are ashamed to say that they're Christians Christianity someone who says they're a Christian is a lot of fake bills muchos if there's a Fool's Gold it's a you know because there's a real goal is everybody to make that real Christian stand out even more is but do you believe the word of God the question is how do you believe the word of God I said these signs are foreign [Music] Are you ashamed of your Pentecost Pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of his words his word is we're ashamed I don't have this quote up there all right Jesus said Jesus now if you're ashamed of me then I'll be ashamed of you why would he be ashamed of you is because you're claiming to be his porque this is when you won't follow him that's why the scripture tells us foreign [Music] I don't want the Lord to be ashamed of me I wanted to say that's my servant that's it my buddy right right that's my friend I don't want to say what I don't know about you brother forget this and the Lord is my Witnesses bring my Bible to how many times I bring my eyes I wasn't trying to be a religious fanatic related [Music] I have nothing to do okay foreign Eva what's that here that's that that's that 1870 old preacher kid he said I said but that was my revelation is I already had an experience with them [Music] we had a real tremendous service on a Wednesday night um foreign [Music] senor I don't know and swallowed up so much Are you ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ foreign failures it was as Crimson brother Branham here talking about the prodigal son and you can go back to the message I'm gonna omit a lot of things and the message here the young man is is told his dad brother Ram brings a real tremendous scene is he breaks it down almost in details how he tells us that how he approached his dad how he wanted his inheritance and he went to his mom now there's a couple of things here omitted but you can go back to the message and now I can hear him saying amen amen I can't see her I can see her put her arms around him she would hug him I used to do that you want this she'll grab me she'll grabs the mom grabbed the Prodigal Son hugged him he don't want a kiss in public I remember when my mom had dropped me off at school she said all my friends were there brother Ram says no affections the Bible said they would be this way Paul speaks it without natural affection that's the way it is today yes the child rules the home now instead of the father and the mother they're the one who does the talking it's a shame without natural affections I can see her I could see the mother Pat his cheeks and the kids you know I I I I I don't think there was a time that my mom asked me a question do you want to go to church today my mom would say we're going to church let's go you don't have an option alternative she would say as long as you live in this house the day you get your house but you live here you're coming boy Muchachos you think I was there oh yes Mom yeah I'm going God I gotta go to church again how many you can say Amen I never was asked the question if I wanted to go to church now the parents say do you want to go to God is look young folks that old dad that you were ashamed of him just because he goes to church and maybe gets happy and shouts in a while he says and that boyfriend or girlfriend of yours in church will say yes [Music] adios and you're just a little bit ashamed of him saying that your mom because she worshiped in church there will be a time when you won't be ashamed of him you're going to be thankful with God if you had a mother that took you to church even though you didn't want to go to church he took you to church even though he knew that you are probably going to go to the world but he did his job as a father she did his job as a mother bring you as much as she could to the house of God I believe I'm thankful for that is a mother that took us to church even though now brother Ram says talking about being assure what you're talking about I have an experience with the Lord we're ashamed of him foreign that not even do will fall from Heaven until you call foreign say what God said no he wasn't like an 80 year old man he was walking like a 16 year old boy walked right up in the presence of the king and said not even do come from Heaven until I call foreign [Music] look like when you pray for the people El Pueblo apologize Mr devil would you please come out and move over and let me por favor faith has muscles it has more muscles than me faith has muscles and hair on its chest when it speaks everything else shuts up don't go in Mr devil will you move out Senor Diablo performance get out of here I'm a Son of God Commission of God you have no apology to the devil nothing to do with him I'm not ashamed of the word of God not ashamed of your commissions the only shame that I am what pero as his servant I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of his words just be ready to give an answer God calls foreign prophetas they said Do you believe the prophet I know that you believe the proper radio says the king says persuade me to be a Christianity not ashamed to stand for the gospel of Christ he said he did everything what they said this I'll dress like this talk like this I'll talk like this every single stage so when it got to the moment foreign let's have some exercises in the Bible let's see how quickly we can turn to them I was thinking the other day of talking to brother Octavio and and see if you approve this I was thinking just to tell him something funny I guess I can say something like that we don't put the scriptures up here no more so now we can bring our Bibles to church now with a pen on the screen now all right First Peter chapter four verse 12. beloved I think think not strange concerning the far a trial which is to try you he said as though some strange thing happened to you now notice notice how the Bible is written notice every comma every period because thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is betrayal so don't don't find it strange or odd while you're going through some trials and there's something strange is happening to you like you're not like an oddball don't don't don't find it strange you accept the Lord Jesus Christ foreign [Applause] [Applause] when his when his glory shall be revealed Gloria ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy says if he be reproached for the name of Christ now if you are a reproached in other words like being ashamed or you're found guilty this is for the name of Christ foreign foreign [Music] that's what the scripture is telling me 16. yet if any man suffer as a Christiano let him not be ashamed what's what the scripture is telling us if you're suffering as a Christian praying for the criticism because because you wear skirts because instead of going on Fridays you go to church on Friday yeah let him not be ashamed but let him be glorified in God you know glorifices now let's go to First Timothy motel that's first Timothy and second Timothy or one of my favorite Bibles scriptures in the Bible here Timothy Motel brother Branham would say many occasions he was the the beloved Son of Paul he was the like the the person that was always with Paul he carried his coat make sure that he didn't need anything Timothy was ready there to help Paulo there's a message where brother Graham says Paul would be preaching in the cold this is Timothy will be ready to have his coat ready to put it on him Paul was his teacher Maestro so here I like how the letters are to Timothy is now notice first Timothy 4 12. he says he said let no man despise thy use but beat down example of the Believers and were in conversation and charity and spirit and faith and impurities because you're young man amen brother Rams on a Wednesday Tate brother Brown was preaching preaching spiritual food in the due season in Miracles he says God can ripen a seed however he wants and he said whoever he wants to raise up I've been here for 40 years foreign [Music] it's not time to give me fruits but I want you to give me fruit right now that's how it is but I'm not ready yet oh I'm telling Jesus Christ is telling you I want fruit right now right now and the tree rejected it and when they left and came back foreign it says don't let anyone look down on you because you're young they said let no man despise thy youth okay he says but be an example to the Believers how do you talk how do you talk in church is it different how you talk at home be an example to the Believers he says and how you talk in palabra and be an example how you talk in conduct you know him love and faith and Purity now verse 13. shall I come and give attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine entertain neglect not the gift that is in me he said each and every single one you have a gift each and every single one of you and Pastor Paul is telling Timothy don't reject the gift that is in you okay something from God don't neglected don't let it goes which was given to you by prophecy came foreign take care of yourself maybe next time we can speak on that okay self and it says on to the doctrine what is Doctrine Doctrine is the Gospel of Jesus Christ he's saying take heed of yourself take care of yourself you're not doing anything you should have been doing at school now continuing in them for in doing this for doing in this thou shall save thyself you will save yourself what is it referring to take you're taking care of the gospel and you're saving Yourself by taking care of the Gospel if the queen of the team is Romanos Romans uh first chapter Uno on the 16th verse says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ now you've noticed those points right there that means it's an answer is amen amen now he says from not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I'm not a smart person myself I don't know what was though things are called but I know that means there's an answer that's coming amen amen uh young people you know what that means I mean there's an answer significance for it is power of God unto salvation everyone that believeth now it is and it's salvation to everyone that believes that's why we shouldn't be ashamed of the Gospel foreign foreign faith that is in thee Memorial first and thy grandmother Lois and my mother Eunice and I am I'm persuaded that is indeed also he's making reference to his mom and to his grandmother yes talk about these godly woman that took care of their household and raised up a Timothy Mateo man amen now verse 6 wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God because in the first chapter excuse me the first Timothy he says neglect not the gifts and on this book he says I put you in remembrance stir up the gift of God don't start stirring it up so you have the gift of sing and stir up the gifts to interpreting stir up together don't neglect the gift that is in you know this now and first first Timothy and second Timothy he says and putting in the head and putting on of hands if you saying position now you're saying brother Louise that you can just pray over me lay hands and I'll have a certain gifts and colleagues are without repentance you already had that gift but when he's talking about putting in the hands you're approving it is now when you see the ministers come up you were about anointed Minister we're not making him a minister before the foundation of the world for God hath not given us the spirit of fear is those three things he says what powers are you talking about the power of the Holy Ghost the power is referring to yeah what is what love isn't referring and a sound mind it is now I wish I could get into that but yeah Lord help us because in Spanish in English it's two different things and in Spanish we're just running out of time but be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the Lord this important remember Paul uh Paul is like the spiritual father to Timothy all right you'll hear about the ram make references you're a mice children in the gospel references now when Paul was writing these letters he was writing these letters in Rome I wish we could get into this and he said remember we said in the testimony of the Lord foreign [Music] take that to modern day today don't be ashamed of the testimonials carry the reproach that Paul's in prison he said I'm not a prisoner of Romeo Paul will never say Paul prisoner of Rome you must say Paul prisoner of Christ even though he was locked up in Rome not a prisoner of Rome he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ where he was at didn't mean he was a prisoner of Rome significance don't be ashamed of me either carry the [Music] Republican to say who's your pastor is that you belong to Jericho Tabernacles don't be ashamed of Jesus Christ foreign [Music] de Cristo but be thou partakers of the afflictions holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose which was given given to us in Christ Jesus before until the world began this is not because of my work this is because of his own purpose his grace before the foundation of the world brother Graham says Lee Cinema Branham I want from this night on God I know you're here I know you meet but I've just put you off now if my if my boss would come home with me I want all my neighbors to know that my boss came home with me but Jesus I invite you to come and if somebody comes in I'll put you off in a corner until after they leave I won't go ahead with prayer continuation you can play something sister because I was in prayer
