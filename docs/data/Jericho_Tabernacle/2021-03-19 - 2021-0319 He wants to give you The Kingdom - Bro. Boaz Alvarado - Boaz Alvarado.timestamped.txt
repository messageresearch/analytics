[23:27] how every day is going to be a battle
[23:28] for you
[23:31] but that's what we're here for for we're
[23:32] we're in a battle
[23:49] i'm going to read a quote before as
[23:50] you're standing here and then we'll read
[23:52] a couple scriptures and i'll you guys
[23:54] can take your seat we'll pray and get
[23:56] started
[24:02] this is out of the the unity of one god
[24:04] and one church
[24:09] it says god's kingdom is not of this
[24:11] earth
[24:14] god's kingdom is in our hearts is
[24:32] and the kingdom of god is within you
[24:36] did you see what it said it said but not
[24:38] without violence
[24:41] have we had a little violence in our
[24:44] lives
[25:13] that's the kingdom i want to read out of
[25:17] luke
[25:19] it's 12 32 if you want to turn with it
[25:26] it's a very simple scripture
[25:35] and the other one we'll be reading is
[25:37] john 3 3 but we're going to read luke
[25:38] first luke says
[25:39] fear not little flock
[25:43] it is your father's good pleasure to
[25:45] give you the kingdom
[26:01] says jesus answered and said unto him
[26:04] verily verily i say unto thee except the
[26:07] man be born again
[26:09] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[26:18] nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[26:21] born when he is old
[26:23] can he enter the second time into his
[26:26] mother's womb
[26:27] and be bored
[26:35] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[26:38] thee
[26:38] except the man be born of the water and
[26:41] of the spirit
[26:42] he cannot enter the kingdom of god
[27:01] he's telling them well you got to go and
[27:03] you ought to be born again
[27:33] heavenly father father celestial i want
[27:35] to thank you for allowing me to be here
[27:37] this evening
[27:41] for always being with me lord
[27:44] no matter what situation i'm in
[27:46] independence
[28:03] but i didn't understand your plan that
[28:05] you had for me
[28:08] i asked you heavenly father that you
[28:10] would allow us to see your plan this
[28:14] evening
[28:16] your plan is a simple plan
[28:19] it's a life-changing plan
[28:23] it'll allow you to see the world
[28:24] differently
[28:26] [Music]
[28:27] it'll help you to withstand the anxiety
[28:30] of life
[28:33] the oppression of this world
[28:36] and we ask that you would be with me
[28:37] this evening lord
[28:41] move me aside allow me to say the things
[28:44] that you've done for me lord
[28:45] permit we ask all these things in the
[28:49] name of the lord jesus christ
[28:52] amen you may be seated amen
[29:00] if i could title this little little
[29:03] message here
[29:06] i'm going to title it he wants to give
[29:10] you
[29:10] the kingdom
[29:14] what is the kingdom what do you feel is
[29:18] the kingdom
[29:20] is it a lot of money
[29:23] farmer prosperity
[29:26] that's what man sees
[29:29] and as we start reading the quotes that
[29:31] brother branham is speaking about
[29:37] in the message the unity of one god in
[29:39] one church
[29:42] you'll see that god always has a plan
[29:46] in which he created the ultimate plan
[29:48] for us
[29:50] but then the devil also has a plan to
[29:52] pervert god's plan
[29:57] and you've got to be careful what plan
[29:58] you're following us
[30:03] because it's so deceiving the brother
[30:06] said it would deceive the very elect if
[30:08] it were possible
[30:13] so we're going to start reading we're
[30:14] going to read the quotes
[30:17] and we're going to try to get you guys
[30:20] out of here
[30:21] sooner rather than later amen
[30:27] and all the and all the time these
[30:29] things are going on
[30:33] the spirit of the living god is striving
[30:35] with flesh
[30:40] trying to get man away from his own
[30:42] achievements
[30:46] trying to get man away from his own
[30:47] selfish motives and objectives
[30:56] to a plan which god has laid down
[31:03] and as long as man works on his own plan
[31:08] he will be a failure and man can only
[31:11] achieve
[31:12] right
[31:15] when he comes back with the right
[31:16] objective
[31:19] and the right motive and that's the
[31:22] according to god's plan
[31:24] for him yes conformed
[31:27] any other foundation fundamentals
[31:42] kind of forgot what my motive here on
[31:43] this earth was
[32:04] i'm going to go out i'm going to get
[32:05] this great job
[32:08] i'm going to do this and i'm going to do
[32:09] that and i'm going to do this
[32:12] and before you
[32:38] that's why i didn't before understand
[32:40] the need of fellowship
[32:45] the fellowship of what
[32:49] the right kind of people correct
[32:52] people of like faith that's why we come
[32:55] together
[32:56] and we enjoy time with each other
[33:01] because just like that message our
[33:02] brother spoke i see
[33:04] hermano the sheep come together to keep
[33:06] warm decay las vegas
[33:10] and now i understand what brother
[33:11] branham said education is you got to
[33:12] stay away from it a little bit
[33:18] it's not that it's bad if you're not
[33:20] careful you'll get winded up in it
[33:22] without says god
[33:26] does not force man to do anything he
[33:28] says
[33:32] you want to go do something gotta let
[33:35] you do it
[33:38] brother branham says in this message uh
[33:40] this is
[33:41] that people can be uh working on the
[33:43] wrong plan
[33:47] but if they come together in unity
[34:08] he can warn you you can throw a bear
[34:11] crate across your path
[34:14] but you walk your own self with your own
[34:16] decisions
[34:20] in his presence to make him your savior
[34:25] this is what he says brother please says
[34:27] but satan has perverted
[34:29] god's plan to his own presence
[34:37] i'm going to read these quotes and i
[34:40] wish i could just play it for you but
[34:41] since i can't play it and i'm not
[34:44] savvy enough where i could do it i'm
[34:46] going to read it uh
[34:59] those so-called meetings today and they
[35:01] are great meetings
[35:06] but it only works on the intellectual
[35:08] part of man
[35:12] man gets under a spell of a revival and
[35:14] he says yes i accept christ
[35:21] and he does it intellectually
[35:25] because he's in a crowd
[35:28] he does it because there's a great
[35:30] minister before him
[35:34] but it's only an intellectual conception
[35:36] but
[35:37] a conception intellectual that man can
[35:39] never go on
[35:42] he's got to come from his mind to his
[35:44] heart
[35:46] and be born again he'll never be able to
[35:50] stand
[35:51] the test
[35:55] keep that in mind
[36:03] is telling us here how to be successful
[36:05] in our lives
[36:10] videos
[36:15] just like the intellectual man asked as
[36:17] peter what what should i do
[36:19] intellectually peter said repent
[36:22] he baptized
[36:38] all unrighteousness is only
[36:39] righteousness perverted
[36:43] a lie is only the truth turned around
[36:50] good thing that god does
[36:53] wrong things is good things perverted
[36:59] so therefore that unrighteousness is
[37:02] righteousness
[37:03] perverted
[37:07] satan justice create anything himself
[37:11] he only has to take what god has created
[37:14] to pervert it
[37:18] a man living with his wife absolutely
[37:21] right
[37:25] but take another woman that that's the
[37:28] same act
[37:32] is perverted and it's
[37:42] that's the way that all the things that
[37:45] satan has got
[37:46] in his reach is
[38:02] did you ever think of the u.n
[38:07] and brother branham's mentioning here
[38:09] how this is satan's
[38:10] eden
[38:14] and when i began speaking i said the
[38:16] devil's going to constantly
[38:18] be fighting you el diablo
[38:23] and it says now trying to make all the
[38:25] nations
[38:28] one great brotherhood under
[38:44] satan controls all the nations
[38:48] the scripture says that satan is the
[38:50] ruler of the earth
[38:54] listen to this this is so tremendous
[38:56] what it says here next president
[39:00] he says when he's he taken jesus up into
[39:02] high
[39:03] exceeding mountains and showed him all
[39:05] the kingdoms of the world
[39:13] and he said these are mine
[39:17] jesus did not say they wasn't jesus
[39:21] and brother branham says says for they
[39:23] are.
[39:26] that's the reason we have wars and
[39:28] killing is because
[39:29] that these kingdoms of the world are
[39:32] controlled
[39:32] by the devil
[39:41] can you foreign now why this
[39:44] a son of god struggle so much
[39:51] do you understand now why
[39:54] when you decide to give your heart to
[39:56] the lord jesus christ
[40:01] why the devil is going to come after you
[40:02] with full attack
[40:07] this is not our world
[40:30] that's the reason brother brandon
[40:32] preached message like the oddball pores
[40:37] that's why brother branham tells us and
[40:39] he's telling us that
[40:40] don't live in this world foreign
[40:45] he's telling us to find a secret hiding
[40:46] place
[40:51] there's always two powers working in
[40:52] this world
[40:55] and lately i've been obsessed
[41:00] with the triune beings
[41:04] understanding ourselves
[41:07] how we're still living in this flesh
[41:10] but god built a compartment way deep
[41:12] down in our heart
[41:16] for himself let's continue god's working
[41:20] here
[41:23] satan is working here so what does god
[41:27] what good does this does this big
[41:30] schools and seminars do anyhow
[41:32] and does
[42:02] and listen what he says here you know
[42:05] the scripture says
[42:08] as a man thinketh in his heart so he is
[42:14] brother branham goes on to explain this
[42:18] for about a year for about four years
[42:19] ago
[42:22] science found out that the human heart
[42:24] there was a thinking
[42:25] faculty uh la cincia de escubrio de que
[42:28] en el corazon del
[42:40] we're talking about science here science
[42:41] proof is proving that i
[42:45] a little compartment in the human heart
[42:50] it isn't in the animal no i stand in the
[42:52] animal
[42:53] or no other life but in the human heart
[42:56] there is a little place
[43:01] and they can they never could come to
[43:03] conclusion
[43:04] what it was
[43:09] but finally they said this
[43:24] in his heart so he is
[43:28] not in his head if god would have meant
[43:31] head
[43:32] say it again if god would have meant
[43:33] head
[43:37] he would have said he would
[44:07] tells him moses take off your shoes
[44:11] imagine if moses would have said shoes
[44:16] and the sign of the sign of respect is
[44:25] many times brother brandon if you don't
[44:26] have the holy spirit
[44:30] you're going to do things that you
[44:31] shouldn't arrest
[44:33] because the devil's always going to
[44:34] point you to this
[44:36] point so there's two powers always
[44:40] fighting
[44:43] the devil points you to this el diablo
[44:45] you have the elders come and pray for
[44:47] you tina
[45:02] the devil's always pointing us to what
[45:04] man can see el diablo
[45:08] and always god is always pointing us to
[45:11] what man believes in his heart
[45:16] satan's intellectual con conception is
[45:18] all right
[45:21] but remember when the eye looks upon it
[45:27] the devil uses your eye el diablo
[45:30] in the garden of eden it proved that the
[45:31] devil chose the head of man to work in
[45:34] uh diablo
[45:40] but god chooses his heart
[45:43] the devil shows him with his eyes
[45:47] something that he can see
[45:51] is believing that's what satan tells us
[45:55] and on the other end let's see what god
[45:58] tells us
[46:00] but when god comes to man
[46:03] he comes to his heart and he lets him
[46:07] believe
[46:07] things by his heart
[46:12] through faith
[46:26] the evidence of things not seen
[46:31] the devil's always trying to use our own
[46:33] head against us
[46:38] remember what you did last week
[46:47] he's always trying to get us to think
[46:49] opposite of what god is trying to show
[46:51] us in our hearts
[46:54] a lot
[47:22] use
[47:32] [Music]
[47:36] those dirty thoughts that come to your
[47:38] mind
[47:41] you shouldn't be thinking that you
[47:42] wouldn't be thinking that
[47:47] if you had the holy ghost
[47:52] be careful what we're uh what were
[47:55] voices we're listening to
[48:00] we'll see things with our eyes
[48:04] but our
[48:32] take what he can see with his eyes
[48:42] see i believe in every every person's
[48:43] life
[48:47] god is going to ask us
[48:51] what decision are you making
[48:54] you came you gave your you you said you
[48:57] surrendered your heart to the lord jesus
[49:00] christ
[49:27] amen at the beginning
[49:31] i mentioned he wants to give you the
[49:32] kingdom
[49:35] and in the message in
[49:38] the unity of one god in one church
[49:56] as sincere as i can
[50:00] i believe the lord jesus christ
[50:03] has the ability to change your whole
[50:05] entire world
[50:09] if you're in a situation
[50:28] brother branham said he told us he said
[50:29] he'll put barricades in the way this is
[50:33] we'll give you warnings we're going to
[50:36] try to tell you don't go that way go
[50:38] this way
[51:29] he says then why did god make that
[51:31] little place
[51:47] you can't be a human being
[51:50] without being filled the time has come
[51:53] where you
[51:54] are forced to make a decision
[52:01] and this is in 58. yes
[52:16] old people los angeles middle-aged
[52:19] people uh
[52:22] i believe god's asking us to make a
[52:23] decision
[52:28] because if you're not watching to what
[52:29] plan you're following
[52:42] to be important
[52:47] important wanting to be somebody
[52:53] brother branham is telling us here
[52:55] aquinos is that you're going to be
[52:57] filled
[52:57] with something um
[53:22] when the unclean spirit has gone out of
[53:24] a man
[53:32] and when he comes back with seven other
[53:34] devils
[53:36] diablos more worse than he was
[53:39] and the last state of the man
[53:43] is eight times worse than what it was at
[53:46] the beginning
[53:51] for people that grew up in the message
[54:08] we
[54:36] brother branham says and this is really
[54:38] hard this is
[54:40] and i'm sorry but i just i'm all i can
[54:43] do is repeat what brother branham said
[54:48] i've heard a minister get up with charts
[55:04] the scripture says all that didn't
[55:07] receive the seal of god
[55:09] had the mark of the beast
[55:15] there's only two classes on the earth
[55:18] exist in those
[55:37] that's what the scripture said so you're
[55:40] forced
[55:41] to make a decision
[55:44] a decision
[55:51] i hear brother brandon's message message
[55:55] and i hear him one time say
[55:59] he says i know you're tired of hearing
[56:00] it this
[56:03] talking about being born again
[56:07] and how you cannot see the kingdom
[56:10] unless you're born again and he's
[56:12] telling the people and he's saying i
[56:14] know you're tired of
[56:54] live your life like if the lord would be
[56:55] coming today
[57:08] for him we had a funeral here for him
[57:10] akita
[57:16] [Music]
[57:39] i got baptized this year maybe i'll give
[57:42] my heart a surrender everything to the
[57:43] lord next year
[57:47] be careful because you may not get there
[57:53] jesus said upon this rock i'll build my
[57:55] church
[57:58] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[57:59] against it
[58:02] spiritual revelation revelation
[58:04] spiritual spiritual conception
[58:06] conception
[58:18] your poor hearts may be running over
[58:20] with doubt he
[58:30] i hope your your hearts may be full of
[58:32] fred
[58:49] mickey mouse first preacher
[58:52] um well if my dad was a mickey mouse
[58:56] wanna see me papyrus what am i
[59:01] but i am coming to you
[59:04] antos who's been in battles
[59:09] and has stood in the trenches i'm
[59:12] telling you that the lord jesus christ
[59:15] can transform your life
[59:30] is
[59:45] i'm david you simply say yo i told my
[59:48] daughter the other day
[59:50] everybody talks about david with the
[59:52] sling
[59:54] and killing goliath and putting on the
[59:58] armor of saul and going out and facing
[1:00:00] the philistines
[1:00:05] but nobody talks about david the
[1:00:06] adulterer
[1:00:09] nobody talks about david the murderer
[1:00:19] just like david had to pay the price for
[1:00:21] what he did
[1:00:26] i believe that every son of god will
[1:00:27] have to pay the price for what
[1:00:29] they have done
[1:00:34] but david story did it in there
[1:00:39] the lord bless
[1:00:54] so every son of god that's here this
[1:00:55] evening
[1:00:58] god will let you do what you want to do
[1:01:03] be careful because you might hurt
[1:01:05] yourself
[1:01:07] because there's going to come a day or
[1:01:08] question
[1:01:23] it took me a lot of years
[1:01:26] to find a resting place
[1:01:31] i don't know how much time i have left
[1:01:35] it took me a lot of time
[1:01:39] to understand what god was doing in my
[1:01:42] life
[1:01:44] i made a mistake after mistake
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:56] that i was going to give my heart to the
[1:01:57] lord jesus christ
[1:02:00] not only was i going to give my heart to
[1:02:01] the lord jesus christ
[1:03:00] if you want god to change your life
[1:03:03] you can change your life he can make you
[1:03:05] a new person
[1:03:08] talk about changing your character
[1:03:11] hablando de cambianos
[1:03:12] character yeah even your character
[1:03:24] if you're a person that's lazy sierra's
[1:03:26] flojo and you don't
[1:03:27] just don't have the energy to get up
[1:03:31] god will change that in you they'll
[1:03:33] start making you want to work for the
[1:03:34] lord
[1:03:37] brother branham says oh brother it pays
[1:03:39] to know
[1:03:40] where you got an escape this is
[1:03:52] the shelter is under the wings of the
[1:03:54] lord's everlasting protection
[1:04:10] or with hydrogen
[1:04:24] el mismo and he gives it to you
[1:04:28] hey man i'm in
[1:04:41] brother branham says do you see the man
[1:04:43] of branham
[1:04:44] you take somebody
[1:04:48] that can't control his temper
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:05:06] and give it over to god and let the
[1:05:09] spirit of the living god
[1:05:13] and down into his heart
[1:05:16] and he'll call every word of god the
[1:05:18] truth
[1:05:47] you won't have to worry about what's
[1:05:50] happening on the outside
[1:06:00] he works with he works with you when the
[1:06:03] nature of the spirit of the devil is in
[1:06:04] there
[1:06:08] and every man born on the earth
[1:06:16] to the world speaking lies
[1:06:19] that's right so in that carnal a
[1:06:22] atomic nature
[1:06:27] how can man achieve anything
[1:06:44] christ takes his throne in the human
[1:06:46] heart
[1:06:49] then life looks different different
[1:06:52] perspective
[1:06:53] then he starts on a new road
[1:06:57] from his own selfish motives
[1:07:00] so the big idea of make himself
[1:07:03] something big
[1:07:07] he starts right towards calvary
[1:07:11] to recognize god
[1:07:54] why don't we just stay home have some
[1:07:57] family time
[1:08:01] staying home and having family time bad
[1:08:03] casuals
[1:08:08] but it wasn't her life anymore
[1:08:11] when someone conduct accepts the lord
[1:08:14] jesus christ
[1:08:16] in their hearts in that little
[1:08:18] compartment
[1:08:20] jesus christ begins to sit in the
[1:08:22] control room
[1:08:35] your character to character you become a
[1:08:38] whole different person
[1:08:42] then after that what what are you
[1:08:43] supposed to do
[1:08:46] why do we come why
[1:08:50] why do we dress the way we dress up
[1:08:54] why when a sister porque condo
[1:08:58] when she's been born again of the spirit
[1:09:00] of the lord jesus christ
[1:09:04] why does she not want to show herself
[1:09:06] anymore
[1:09:09] why does she cover herself up
[1:09:13] as a christian como cristiano why can't
[1:09:16] i go do the same things that i used to
[1:09:18] do
[1:09:18] porque
[1:09:59] he was always the son of god but he was
[1:10:02] the last son of god
[1:10:05] until he made a decision what did he
[1:10:08] have to do
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:12] that he wanted to serve the lord jesus
[1:10:14] christ
[1:10:26] so if you feel something in your heart
[1:10:42] you're a son of god
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:22] these signs shall follow some of them
[1:11:27] the scripture says it says no shall
[1:11:30] follow
[1:11:31] them all of them
[1:11:35] what do you think we come up here we
[1:11:36] have the elders pray for somebody
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:12:03] amen i'm in
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:14] i'm so tired of hearing people
[1:12:19] people say the holy spirit is
[1:12:22] and in that message brother branham says
[1:12:25] in his preaching in 1958
[1:12:29] the holy spirit is not real
[1:12:33] not unreal in the sense where you're
[1:12:34] going to come to church and lift your
[1:12:35] hands
[1:12:38] clap your hands but they say it's not
[1:12:42] real because it can't change your life
[1:12:45] i'm a witness it'll change your life
[1:12:49] it'll make you do different things
[1:12:53] and it's a continual change yes
[1:12:56] god will correct you you do something
[1:12:59] wrong
[1:13:00] i'm gonna correct you he's gonna make
[1:13:02] you make it right
[1:13:06] hey man i'm going to read one more quote
[1:13:10] since there's so many people today
[1:13:14] who say the holy spirit is not real
[1:13:17] today
[1:13:20] but the working of the holy spirit
[1:13:23] the kingdom of god in you
[1:13:27] god sits on the throne of your heart
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:14:08] when he comes and tells you you're not a
[1:14:10] son of god
[1:14:12] i am a son of
[1:14:25] and he changes your carnal nature into
[1:14:27] his nature
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:31] then in this you become a new creation
[1:14:33] in christ
[1:14:40] you just wake up
