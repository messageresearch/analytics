longing the desire that is in every heart and this morning and give to them your people whatever they ask them [Music] i ask it in the sweet name of the lord jesus christ [Music] [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] i'll mention it i know there's about 50 or 70 people uh around that number here in the church right now is [Music] the reality is that we didn't want everyone to come back and i know i knew not everyone was going to come and as i said there's no problem the reason why we don't want everyone to come back that will cause too much of an issue will be too tightly closed and just as we are now nicely distanced apart we're fine like that that she come here to the front and give her testimony let's pray for her because the sister is quite nervous we hope that the lord can ease her nerves and she can express what she has in her heart i do wish to say what the sister will say in this morning it's something that i asked her to give her own testimony and she asked me what do i speak about you already familiar and i said sister talk about your family i didn't tell her what to say exactly you can see that it's a bit tied together with what i want to speak on this morning may god bless her sister francis alanis my name is the johnny asked me to give this short testimony for allowing me to express a little of what i have in my heart and give a short testimony for the honor and the glory of our lord jesus christ is [Music] foreign a cortando foreign cameras french a [Music] a foreign foreign [Music] no [Music] gloria ah [Applause] the fight has not been easy because the devil walks like a roaring lion for those he can devour now the lord has blessed me with four children two boys and two girls some of whom have gone astray and drugs have been the most powerful weapon that the enemy has used and continues to use to destroy the young and even adults and as a mother it has been very difficult for me the saddest and most painful thing that has been to look is that my children how drugs have affected not only their lives but also their loved ones yet i know that my redeemer liveth and i have not lost faith yet to see them one day surrender to christ because the seed has already been planted in them and maybe i would not be here to see it but i believe with all my heart that god will answer the requests and prayers in our hearts praying for each other claiming our loved ones the lord will answer in due time and about four or five years ago one of my daughters was going through a difficult time in her life and she isolated herself at home she did not call me nor did she visit me and i knew something was wrong so one day my son-in-law called me and asked me if i could go and stay at his house because he had to go out of town to work and didn't want to leave my daughter home alone and i asked him why what was happening he replied that she had been cutting herself for a long time but she didn't want to tell me or didn't want me to worry i said that was okay and i decided to go and see what was happening and when i got to their house i was surprised at the condition they were in the house was a mess trash everywhere dirty dishes dirty clothes etc so i decided to start cleaning and it was so much that i spent two entire days cleaning day and night and when i finished cleaning i decided to pray to for the house and anointed with oil i had brought an anointed oil which had been prayed for at a convention and i began to annoy my grandchildren and i anointed them with oil i also anointed each door and the bedrooms and when i got to my daughter's room i asked her if she wanted me to pray for her she answered yes i put oil on her forehead her pillow and on the backboard of her bed and then i asked her if she believed god could heal her she answered yes and i told her very well close your eyes i started praying for her and rebuked all the evil spirits that came to my mind then i said everything is fine don't worry anymore and and started to leave her bedroom when she was about to take the step to leave the door of her room a loud noise was heard and everything went dark the alarm began to ring and ring and the cats that she had ran from one side to another and they jumped on the chairs from here to hit there my daughter got scared and was telling me what's going on mom i replied nothing my daughter don't be afraid everything is fine now someone is angry but everything is fine god healed you we try to turn the lights back on and turn off the alarm everything and and everything was going back to normal god healed her since that day and she has not cut herself again the lord healed her and i am more than grateful for that to him be all the honor and the glory although the devil continues to bother my children tormenting them i know that they are children of god and that god is going to bring them forward they are going to surrender to god what i want to say to the mothers and the parents who are having difficult times with their children who are tormented by drugs or any other spirit not to give up to keep praying for them to keep going and to trust god that we have a powerful god who can do everything no matter what the devil brings us god is more powerful than him god is going to bring us out of this he will prevail god bless the sister for giving us a testimony now if you see what i can see what the sister just expressed she says she's making intercession for her children not just the parents but the entire church the other day i asked the brothers to start praying for each other especially the youth they have a great necessity if you listen to what the sister said she rebuked those evil spirits and when she rebuked them they left and she says it's expressed in words even the brother read it is whatever came to my mind i believe that's exactly the time that we're living in it this is the time of the mind we're not living in the time of the feet or the legs and when we have the mind of christ and it's the holy spirit that's coming to you habla whatever you speak whatever you long for whatever you say that will come to pass for someone to have a word or an expression and then that thought comes down and then it's a thought express i wanted the sisters to say that it was and i'll show you through the slides if they could put on the title of the lesson put it on the screen do you know what that is it's the cloud we all know what that is that is the head that is christ our head amen i know some people say brother johnny you speak so elevated so harsh but if you can understand my purpose it might go behind it to where i'm taking it when you connect with god then you come to be god himself you become an entity you don't need someone else because you've entered god's kingdom and then in english [Music] i hope you can bear with me because we did begin a little late and my main focal point is this i'll explain it if you can turn to second corinthians chapter 12 9 through 12. now remember what i'll speak this morning is tied together with what the sister said what a way of learning english now i'll speak in english and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me el poder de for my strength is made perfect in weakness the you're we want the mind of christ to take over our mind and that's the way we are that's where we find ourselves in this world in this life all it is is just full of problems it's a very distressful time and i know i know you can hear what i'm saying now watch what verse 10 says therefore i take pleasure in my infirmities i don't know what to do i don't even know what to think my mind doesn't help me but the bible here tells me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities when i am weak you got to get yourself out of the way brother get yourself out of the way me me it's what i think no it's not what you think it's what god thinks i'm talking about not people from the outside but people of the message well you see my my kids are they're not following along they're they've worked they've gone wayward somebody might tell well if you if it was really right and there were good parents his kids wouldn't be lost and then the reproach comes in and necessities well there's a lot of things there we can we could put in there in persecutions are we persecuted persecuted so we are persecuted in distress for christ's sake in distress for christ's sake my because that's exactly what's happening right now and the bride illinovia are becoming one converting and we're being placed in the head la haven't gone into the message yet i need to say this before i get into the message how many read back in deuteronomy 1 there where the spice went right in there and tasted of the things from canaan which canaan is not a type of the millennium millennium how many know that you mean just one hand that's right canaan is not the type of the millennium canaan millennium because they had wars porque hosting guerrero and everything else in canaan etc yeah i don't remember if you ever i remember what i said the other day we've gone we've come into the promised land which is canaanite jericho was the first city inside the promised land canaan it's not the millennium it's because they had bad fighting killings and everything else in canaan type the holy canaanite is a type of the holy ghost is where they settle down with the holy ghost now we've come into the land of the holy ghost now we have a certain right but in in the holy ghost let's hear what brother brown says here yeah i'm looking this is the man of branham be quiet johnny just read the quote okay canaan is where they settle down with the holy spirit because they still had wars and if you don't believe you have wars if you stay creek just get the holy spirit once one time you get the holy ghost it's not going to be everything nice and tranquil and peaceful and everything it's going to be it's a war war brother gerard okay when you enter into the promised land the holy ghost time to relax and sit down and drink your tea and relax it's time to get up it's time to fight it's important it's time for war yes what are you doing what do you do in canaan they were possessing their rights they could not possess their rights till they got into canaan they didn't own nothing in the wilderness amen and we got rights when you received the holy ghost i understand how brother bram types these types of typos you have to fight for every how many of you parents are longing for or praying for your sons and daughters almost all the brothers the devil he's tremendous bring my son and daughter to your feet but if this misbehaved they're not a christian they don't want anything with god that doesn't matter if you join to become one with god oh brother he's not only is he my pastor he's an apostle he says that the bride enters the head she comes into the head the mind of god but the prophet and that son and daughter of god that does not want to come to god but because of your prayers i believe all my children have eternal life my children will surrender to you lord that's right that's right off of my crown territory your ground satan says yeah but wait a minute i've got the mind of christ tengo la you can have the same thought that god has someday the the third pool will kick in you don't i'll serve notice on you by the holy spirit guidance is because in canaan they killed and burned and took cities there will be no death in the millennium in the millennium but another thing it does and the anointing of the sacrificial lamb in the wilderness and then entering into the land that they had been promised now what is the land promised to the new testament believers promise is the holy spirit now you have the holy spirit apply the hallelujah amen amen thank you lord jesus gracias jesus now the cloud if you can put the cloud up there now let me explain something to you is he says i do nothing until the father shows me jesus the eternal spirit father eternal el padre was before the son jesus jesus christ amen amen and we were saved by the blood of jesus christ but even the son had to be subject to the father so jesus has a head jesus and who is the head of the church jesus jesus the holy spirit amen amen a pastor of the church neglected the head of the church is and i'm going to say something here in a minute um i get myself in trouble by saying these comments now it's a real fine line here now if the pastor is the head of the church does that mean that you're married to the pastor significant question right what i understand what brother brown says we have to be married to the word jesus christ jesus christ and when you say the pastor of the head of the church that's a now i've looked and looked for quotes where brother branham says that all right where the pastor pastor is the spiritual husband of the church is the mystical body of your first pastor supreme pastor is not me no soy no sir no senor according to the bible conformed just read the bible your pastor superstore talking to the wives now pastor okay now now the wife alright when she's at home casa and the husband is there he is to be in subjection to her husband is then who's the pastor or the head of the house the wife is la the wife is because he's gone because the wife is the head of the home right now the messenger is physically he's not here with us so right now the bride she too becomes the head of this but inside i don't know if you're understanding me okay let's read a scripture colossians 1 18. he is the head of the body the church is okay it's very clear there right now he is the head of the body the church now ephesians 5 121-24 cinco de la yourself one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourself unto your own husbands as unto the lord las casas maridos how many here are subject to your own husbands no brother when i speak my husband he shivers he trembles because i'm the man i wore the even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body el salvador therefore the church is subject into christ and i understand that she is the boss sir new things and my wife but ultimately in the end the man is the head of the household i'll read you a quote right now it's nearly time for me to get down i do apologize i know how to say what i want to say but i know if i say it then i'll get into like a dangerous territory i'll say something you don't have to say amen just listen to me i'm the pastor of this place amen is and i just said physically your husband is your head he's your pastor now for us to be in god's kingdom you have to be married with christ jesus he's the word put up the next slide the church is married to christ amen amen i am the pastor in the portion that it's needed [Music] you have to be joined together with the word jesus join together with christ jesus you must have a new birth be sealed with the holy spirit the church is married to christ we are the wife of christ bringing forth children what is an angel case the messenger a true messenger to the church el mensah christ is the headship of the church we're not our own unless god reveals reading the message the holy spirit has to reveal it to you whatever you say that's what it will be so be careful with what you say be careful what you say notice now god is the husband of the church is who is the husband of the church christ in the church is just a being made known christos well i thought we were married to christ same person persona and the church is his bride amen amen what is it not ten people the head chip in the body has become one unit united but he also has a head correcto is that right yes and that pillar of fire is that one that's there the same one the pillar of fire and jesus are the same one but even he has a head amen amen it's got manifested in his people his deal's money for someone support there's only one name given under heaven that is the name of the lord jesus christ we only worship one person one man and that's jesus great revelation glory to god body of christ proving manifested like god did that body did compromise his bride it's the spirit working in the flesh of the church like it worked in the in the flesh of jesus christ head but it's like the woman when he's not there she's the head but she has a headache and the bride always yields to her head which is the seven things which are the tastes which is the message did you understand ask and then it came to remind me my children and says so right then enamour she was the head of that the mind of christ my god they don't know it no los sabin they have to do it anyhow did you notice a woman when she get married she put the bell over her face why she's coming to her head or she's coming to her husband just like just like rebecca didn't ask she put a veil over her face to meet isaac she has no more heads but are you reading between the lines if we do that we're submitting ourselves to the words you've got to submit yourself to the word not to each other we submit ourselves to the words that we're married to the word word to his doctrine takes no thought up for herself it's a perfect place calling even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people because you have to stand and be married to the perfect son of god marry johnny alvarado marry a man oh mary the son of god their place oh my god i don't know whether it could be right or not no that's where people misunderstand what brother branham says he's referencing lot's wife and here lot's wife she's the one that's speaking how can i overcome go to the message and keep in mind that it's lot's wife speaking i don't know whether i it could be right or not no esme even though he's my husband but yet your pastor superstore is your husband it's very you've got to know not just say well i see the other things doing it i see a sign don't misunderstand well i looked and looked and looked where brother branham has a quote that says it exactly like that i challenge you come and bring me look here's what brother branham says right here because this quote [Music] everything has its i'm the dumbest person here and i'm understanding what brother branham is saying here your pastor is your husband sister did you understand he's your pastor and then i looked for brother brenham says the pastor this is the church where brother branham says that the local pastor he's the head of the church i do believe it but please come and show me didn't you say that when william branham is gone brother neville is there and brother cox who was a deacon brother cox says he gave a testimony because he was deacon of the church i don't know what's going on with this generation of people don't put your own interpretation today it's 12 o'clock where it says that the pastor is the spiritual husband of the church i understand he's the ha he's the head of that but to the point that you're married to him we're supposed to be married to the world it doesn't matter if you're married to the pastor if you're not married to the word amen amen because in the beginning the word made itself flesh and a man and then that word made itself yeah now she is also ahead no just because she's ahead does not mean that she has the third pool sword no sir she's subject right sister hatty right what do you want i don't know i want the are we subject to who to william branham to jesus we're then we'll come down and then you can go and have some lunch and enjoy each other's company honey talk to your wife and then lay the cards on the table and say honey who's the boss here is is both he and she surrendered to christ which is the word there's no longer going to be an issue because many women want to boss their husbands around us and i've seen you sisters not only in this church but in other churches i've seen it just look they snapped their fingers and then they the way they speak to the man like very mean old man i told you to do this what's the matter with you and the poor man he's like oh my god the power of christ can plow you look if you love god i love god we must have peace you don't boss neither do i boss around he is the one that bosses around he is the holy spirit okay let's just read one more and i'll get down and forgive me for taking so long it's past 12 o'clock already forgive me hopefully once you get home and eat you eat a nice big chop or some pork chop or some big steak and you say man i have to forget what brother johnny said and eat your little tacos or whatever but never forget what the seventh angel told us i like that because i believe it's apostolic me because the head the highest order in the church is the shepherd porque vela cabeza and how is god going to ever work in this church you see it just cannot get it see us so if i believe that i'm being made of god and i believe it's on the verge right [Applause] thank you lord jesus jesus i am praying oh god that everyone here would understand what i'm trying to say i'm not trying to be anti-christian not trying to be against the words i wanna i wanna just say the word that's it the way the word says i'm not against anyone i'm foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen [Music] would you please stand with me [Music] let go down again [Music] and no one else will [Music] to fill [Music] help me
