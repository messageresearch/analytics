blessed name of our lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] we thank the musicians uh just as we're standing i'd like to open up to the book of isaiah 66 56 verse neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree. for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keepeth my s that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant for unto them will i give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than the sons and daughters i will give them an everlasting name that that that shall not be cut off also the sons of the strangers that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants everyone that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even then will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted unto mine altar for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people there's another scripture i'd like to read in mark 11. verse 15. and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called a nation of all nations of the house of prayer but ye have made it its den of thieves may the lord bless you reading of his word you may be seated the one that we taught represents the cross at calvary jesus where jesus died for us then there's another altar that's a golden altar that has incense uh it was in the holy place now tonight we'll continue with the altar like we taught last week in the outer courts there's two furnitures which is the brass altar that speaks about the cross at calvary esta la fuente de bronsen and then there's the brass fountain that speaks about being baptized in the name of his sacrifice of the lord jesus christ and then from the outer courts one can go into the next place which is called the holy place and then there specifically there's three furnitures but the one that we the prophet teaches us that prayer can even change the way god thinks a sincere prayer can reach god it can touch his heart represent justification the holy place represents sanctification represents sanctification and then the holiest of holy represents it represents the baptism of the holy ghost and something that i heard some time ago that i really liked a brother was explaining the different languages of the message you'll find that another theme of the message speaks of the same thing of the holy ghost but we can also say water sangre blood and fire we can translate it to the church to luther wesley wesley and pentecost and all these teams speak of the same thing but through different ways there's a certain way of speaking in english many people make the mistakes of taking the way that you speak in spanish it's the same way you speak in english honestly spanish has its own way of speaking english and english has its own way of speaking in english but if you know how to speak english and you know how to speak of that same theme in espanol in spanish you won't say it the same pero esta hablando de la misma but you're talking about the same thing so then i say that the outer court the holy place and then the holiest of holy ebola is justification and i can say it's justification it's sanctification baptism of the holy ghost it speaks of the same thing because peter said repent and one has to repent in the brass altar that he said you be baptized and that's found in the holiest of holy [Music] that's why the bible says my house is a house of prayers you've got to pray sincerely brother branham says in the message uh god's instructions to gabriel says we type it with ruth ruth de siviendo ruth deciding ruth resting deciding deciding was justification serving and her preparing herself sanctification that's when she had the holy ghost hasta when ruth made her decision you can go back to the bible you can find what she said when she left from moab she said to noah me her mother her mother-in-law me and accepted the new life of nomi of naomi la vida in israel the life in israel ruth went through the tabernacle through the day will come where you reach the brass altar you repent of your sins the day will come when you come to the brass fountain when you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you'll wait to receive the gift of the holy ghost which is in the holy place but in between that time you also go through those three stages through your actions now what we read in isaiah it speaks about strangers in unix personas they did that with furniture i'd like to read acts 21 26 verse then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him crying out men of israel help this is the man that teaches all all men everywhere against the people and the law and of the people in the law yes and the law and this place and further brought greeks also unto the temple and have polluted this holy place only jews were allowed here no gentiles not that he would take the gentiles and would take him to his house his house of prayer and originally no one was allowed in there solamente but through our actions now in psalms 5517 evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry loud and he shall hear my voice now at three different times of the day they pray our element altar where the beast's bodies were burnt after the blood was taken every nine o'clock at the morning the 12 o'clock and 3 [Music] every jew in palestine fell to his feet and his hands toward heaven and as that smoke ascended up sus horaciones ivan in the morning in because the jewish congregation they were only allowed to enter into the outer court only the priests entered into the holy place and then the high priest entered into the holiest of holi now at these three hours the smoke would arrive we talked about the brass altar representing the crops now in mark 1525 it was the third hour and they crucified him and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour now that third these are the same hours we've read in the quote of 9 a.m midday and three in the afternoon so then nine o'clock was the third hour laura the sixth hour remember people were only allowed on the outer courts but here in the scripture in luke 1 5. it talks about a priest that was in the holy place there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course conformed according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying at the time of the incidents because the people were only permitted to be in the outer courts but the priest was allowed to enter into the holy place but both do the same thing as the incense arises they're praying laura for you sanctification los atros so the outer courts is justification it's justification the gold altar the sanctification it's sanctification and then the holy spirit is the baptism of the holy ghost let's go to second chronicles chapter 6. verse 12. here's king solomon and he's about to dedicate the temple that he built now just notice the words the bible says this is and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands now like i've already told you the congregation the congregation was only allowed in the outer courts now solomon is in front of the altar el esta ante el altar de bronson for solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long the cinco codos altura de tres codos five cubits broad and three cubits high ilo via puesto en medio del atrio and he had said it in the midst of the court and stood it and and stood upon it upon it he stood up and he kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands towards heaven and even the bible says that that altar was placed in the outer court and it gives us the measurements of 3 and 5. and he gives them the it is cinco codos de antura five cubits abroad and it shall be four square and the height thereof three cubits so that altar where solomon was it was the brass altar it was before the entire people and he started to pray our apart now part of his prayer and secunda there's no god likely in heaven nor in the earth which keep us covenant and show us mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts allah have respect therefore unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication all right now just remember that that he said prayer and supplication oh lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee jose upon this house day and night upon the place where thou has said that thou would has put thy name thereof to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place hearken therefore unto the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel so it wasn't just for solomon it was also for israel it's not just for the minister but also for you in the testament in the old testament god gave an altar for the people where the people could see that altar and the smoke would arise that you would hearken uh the prayer of the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel which they shall make toward this place that you would hear even from heaven where thou where thou hearst the prayer he made sanctification sanctification now in second chronicles 7 1. now when solomon had made an end of praying fuego fire came down from heaven consume the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house los atreus the outer courts with the brass altar the prayer is sanctification it's sanctification and then now the third part of the spirit the fire of the holy ghost is praying he used the word prayer and supplication now another scripture in second chronicles 5 12. now here solomon is with many people and he says in verse 12. and also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of hemen of judathon and their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and salteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests in the past we've shown you okay in grace is when the temple is about to be inaugurated 120 people that have been born again now in acts 113 pedro and when they were coming they went up to the upper room where abode both peter james and john andres felipe tomas bartolome mateo jacobo icho de alfeo simon el celote ejudas hermano and andrew phillip thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelottis and judas the brother of james todd these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication the same two words that solomon used when he was praying at the stage of sanctification before the fire of the holy ghost come down because these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication con las mujeres jesus hermanos with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren de los hermanos and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of the names together were about 120. so then what solomon did in the natural but to you spiritually he's taking you to the different furniture through his actions through the decisions that you make ponies they put his hands upon it the priest cut the throat and he felt the bleeding and heard the bleeding of it and it died and he felt its little body stiffened out yesterday and it was dead he know that ought to be him has altar and the smoke went up [Music] and it was a prayer of forgiveness so in the sacrifice that arises in la cruz at you've got to perform a prayer of forgiveness it's a prayer of repentance [Music] where you can perform your prayer now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized jesus jesus was baptized justification and praying sanctification sanctification el and the holy ghost ascended in bodily shape like a dove upon him the baptism of the holy ghost he showed us those three stages showing that what happened to her in the naturals is what's going to happen to you in the spiritual history so those stories in the bible they've got a purpose they're not just stories god is speaking something there the three stages of grace you can change it and translate it to another theme wesley you can say luther wesley pentecost decided everything speaking of the same thing now there was a certain man in kaiseria called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band piado a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god always if you can see he already passed justification and it says that he prayed to god in verse three is he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming into him and saying unto him cornelius and when he looked on him was afraid and said what is it lord answer and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms or come up for a memorial before god cornelius cornelius was at the brass altar al aora novena at the ninth hour that was a custom where at that time the smoke would arise and it says that his prayers were received to see importa so it matters and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter este he lodges with one simon a tanner though whose house is by the seaside and he shall tell thee what thou art to do and saw heaven open and a certain vessel descending upon him four-footed beasts of the earth uh and of wild beasts creeping things and the fowls of the air vino navos levante pedro mata and there came a voice to him said rise peter kill and eat entonces but peter said not so lord for i've never eaten anything that is common or unclean pedro pensoque cornelio now peter thought that cornelius era he was unclean peraki in the verse and the voice spake up unto him again a second time lo que dios limpio what god hath cleansed that can call not thou coming and even if for the jews these people are unclean for god you are clean verse 34. then peter open his mouth instead of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons criminal god doesn't discriminate what he did in the natural with the jews he does it now with you in the spiritual but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him just like it says in isaiah if the stranger comes and accepts me i accept him and i'll bring him to my house of prayer the holy ghost fell upon all them which heard the word and they with and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished now the faithful of the circumcision this is for unto the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god entonce respondo pedro then answered peter puede a caso alguno in pedire agua can any man forbid water parque no san bautista that these should not be baptized which were received with the holy ghost as we imagine jesus and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord our alimony peter went up onto the house top a few days later in donde estaba where he was tenia ambre iviona vicion while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost peter said they haven't even been baptized yet but they had already received the holy ghost but they were not baptized in water because your sincerity abre el camino opens the way on to the next stage just like marcos's wife she received the baptism of the holy ghost without being baptized in water especially it is possible but we also tell you that it's a need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we don't take away the baptism of water but someone can receive it without the water peros but repentance is required cornelius of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or some other man the eunuch was fulfilling the prophecy of isaiah that if the eunuch would come to my home is caminos and follows my footsteps the bible says you cannot say i am a dry tree an arbor represents a tree represents a human being just like jesus is the tree of life he started to preach but there's different things that a preacher needs to preach la cruz the cross the baptism that there's also a god that can sanctify you he he took him to the second part a la fuente de bronser de brass alter the brass fountain verse 36 says and as they went on their way to agua they came onto a certain water and the eunuch said akihayagua here's water what does hinder me to be baptized if you truly repent and philip said and if thou if thou believe us with all thine heart thou mayest christ and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god he accepted christ at the brass altar emmando para el carro and he commanded the chariot to stand still agua felipe and they went both down and they went down both into the water and was bad and he baptized him and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip and the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing because philip already fulfilled what he needed to do god took care of what pertained to him so give him the joy of the holy ghost so you can see that that tabernacle it's you go through those different furnitures now with the brass altar they would pray three times a day in the morning midday and in the afternoon it says in second chronicles 6 22. now here's solomon he's dedicating the temple in sanctification and now here he's praying and sanctification he says to make him swear an oath and come before an altar in this house by recompensing his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his and if the righteousness of israel be put to be put to the worst before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house from the heavens and forgive the sins of thy people and bring them again unto the land which thou gives them and to their fathers and if the heavens is shut up there's no rain because they have sinned against thee now pay attention to this part here if yet if they pray toward this place and confess thy name god would his childhood he was taken unto babylon even in babylon he served god in daniel says they're in daniel 6 10. now remember the three hours that we mentioned and his windows being opened in the chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave and thanked god and gave thanks before his god as he did of four times now didn't matter where they were if they prayed towards jerusalem but you need a prophet to reveal to you what is that symbol now and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should have fought he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne alright now the the gold altar of incense is also called a sensor of gold it's in the form of a symbol now something that i found that was just so interesting to me paul begins to speak about the tabernacle in hebrews 9. now you remember that i mentioned that in the outer courts there's two furnitures the brass altar and then the brass fountain and then in the holy place there are three furnitures one is a table pan it has bread another one is is a candle uh candles candlestick candlestick and then the gold altar yes and that gold altar it's in the holy place now just see what paul says here then verily the first covenant all had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first place it was called the holy place that was the candlestick and the table and the show bread which is also called the sanctuary aura now it says there that is the holy place now it only mentions two furnitures it doesn't mention the gold altar no mention it doesn't mention the golden censor but now in verse 3 and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all our now look what the first furniture is which had the golden censor a caso pablo cometh did paul make a mistake now it's in the holiest of holy porque cambio why did it change remember that in the brass altar in the outer courts out there the people would pray in the and for the priesthood [Music] where is the sacrifice for sin laying then el cordero there has to be a place where the slain lamb bloody don de la sangre where the blood now the instance was the odors the odorous stuff that they burned which the bible said was the prayers of the saints sacrificious it's in the form of a symbol and we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ when you think about the lamb in a persona you think of a person no you don't think of an animal you think of jesus christ you think of your savior your redeemer when jesus ascended to heaven that is the holiest of holy jesus and jesus is the high priest and the high priest is the one that entered into the holiest of holy jesus jesus is there high priest in a symbolic form as it doesn't matter where you are is part right now of a high priest interceding on behalf of your prayers behalf of your confessions because the stand to jesus christ the high priest the one that intercedes on behalf of your prayers but you've got to fulfill the part is and has been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but yet does not have the holy ghost we can pray and through prayer [Music] we thank you for all of this in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] [Music] foreign is [Music] is [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music]
