people that are watching right now I mean you also supplied their needs and for every word that comes out you placed it in their hearts let it be a revelation or foreign [Music] once again we'll be reading The Book of Joel 2 28. praise God God bless him I'm a bit nervous this morning I think it's something natural a natural reaction for someone to get nervous but we're still trying if you have it foreign Upon Our flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handsmaids in those days will apart my spirit amen God bless you may be seated uh nowhere I won't take too long today I just would like to make a summary of what I spoke about two weeks ago and as I mentioned I think God is laid out the road for me already before I forget before I get ahead of myself I would like to thank my pastor for giving me the chance to be able to express something to the bride it ministerio and also to the ministry that are in their posts may God bless them right Bueno and I said that he speaks to him that's what at least what I know if someone knows one of the ways that I can uh one of the ways for me one of them is dreams or visions God has spoken to me by dreams and by vision I want to summarize its dreams and visions and as I said the reason why the lord gave me that Vision how many here have ever had a vision that Vision caused me to go to a service uh [Music] God works in a way that we don't understand according to my understanding because we're just human but with that Vision that the Lord and I can say that God did give it to me because is dead because if you're if you ever get a vision you have to examine it uh through the scriptures because even the enemy can give you a vision and you can say well God gave me a vision you got to make sure that it was God you have to pass it and examine it through the Bible Bueno wealthy um I'm reading the message is this a sign of the answer just pay attention to what brother Branham says he says but now let me from now on for the next about 15 to 20 minutes let me take the scriptures if you notice in Revelations the 10th chapter now let me say this is if the vision is scriptural and tons is it can only be interpreted by the scripture and then I want you to put this together I could say the same you can put everything in in its place about the vision that I have you know you know I'm not hoping for you to give me your seal of approval yes I'm hoping that the Lord gives me about that vision and through the scriptures and during that time when I was searching for someone the dream and the vision I wasn't able to find any answers and the brothers that were over there the reply was only the prophet can interpret it for you I'll keep reading in Pages if I believe that the interpretation didn't come immediately that was God's sovereignty foreign it was God's sovereignty foreign we're fixing to something is fixing to happen amen something is fixing to happen Hermanos is we're living in tough times the physical Cristiano very tough for the Christian s and as the days go by or get even tougher if you may the Lord speak to us now I'm going to read Lucas Luke 4 17. uh despacio I want to take it slowly because I'm very nervous it's a really big responsibility just to be behind us it's really nice just to be sitting down when you're just eating all the preachers they go fasting if you want to take it or not uh we'll be reading Luke 4 17. amen we're going to talk a little here Lucas cuatro this is we'll start with uh Luke 4 16 and then going on and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read speaking about the king of kings foreign and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written is the Corazon foreign of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sights of the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and all the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him foreign fulfilled in your ears one chairman can you say Amen it's not a mini me but you're Amen in the word here it's saying it's speaking about a prophet that's in the book of Isaiah and here in the New Testament it's being fulfilled the same Arkansas I can say with all the breath in my lungs Cinco says the Malachi 456. this day is this scripture fulfilled that's why because he brought God's word to reveal the word to us because now notice so is the temple right now we're living in a Time Moody fishing that's very difficult but I don't know wherever you look to your right to your left behind or in front of you El Mundo estas the world is suffering the time is very near at hand notice the time that we're now living in is a complete Insanity it's insano it's something that is not healthy but we as Christians I asked myself what are we doing how are we with God what conditions because I believe our spirituals by reading his Bible and we're going to see what conditions and in his message there's so many messages foreign that truly this world is falling apart and many of us I don't want to get into this but we'll get into it right now may God help me and may the Lord help you as well brother Branham he brought us this message and this message is to leave of this sinful world now many of us we spend our time and a technology at least I'm very ignorant in question when it comes to technology I was asking my wife uh sometimes she has to fix things on my phone I'll go will be Cardinals because sometimes you have to locate yourself it just seems that I'm going around and around spinning yeah right foreign when the economy was on the ground was so low I was working I wasn't able to work for about two to three weeks there was a lot of people that lost their jobs and there was a service on a Sunday and I said to the Lord I said Lord you know that I don't have a job I need you to give me a job before the service began and the Lord said to me now brother I can say that the Lord said to me because God is in his word so when I finish my prayer without looking for a specific quote I just opened my Bible yes and as soon as I opened it here it said there Genesis Genesis 30 28. it just it wasn't beating around the bush there the scripture says this is appoint me thy wages and I will give it that's the god that we serve and he said appoint me thy wages and as a human many times or is it true or is it not true so pondering on that um I would repeat it so often I would say I will give it and I said Lord I asked you for a job if it's you speaking to me I'm going to see God at his word hermano and brother here in this book God is here God speaks when the service was done we went to our house I got a call Steve Sanders and brother Steve Sanders a brother that goes to a church over here in the north he said brother and he says because that's how they know me foreign God answering a prayer so if you have something amen Brothers that's why we come just know that God gives to us and you ask if it's God's will God will give it to you amen amen Brothers foreign I'm gonna read like I said I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna go at a slow pace I just wanted to finish LA profesia on concerning what prophecies are is the prophecy of Joel Miracles I'm going to read in the message this day is the scripture fulfilled foreign it's just this is just to confirmment uh truly what is it that we're following I believe in the messenger Williams and I believe has gone around the world from the corners a lot of people can't even reach okay this is here that same day when the pillar of fire descended on Mount Sania testimonials your testimony as you know Moses was the man caught of God um and when God called him he had to have an experience amen speak with him and anyways everything that he said had to come to pass just as if he were to say it or else no one would believe him so therefore no man has to call and has the right to call himself that until he has spoken with God face to face there in the back side of the desert when he found God himself now all the atheists in the world could not explain cannot explain it away from him he was there he knew what happened should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience you have an experience with God you have an experience with god um and when we come here to the fellowship that's what we should be talking about the experiences for me that's real Fellowship it's fellowshipping around others grieved and then it says I want to hear something that will benefit my life in my spiritual life not to speak about it but only God's word [Music] um are you that's different from one person to the other yo medicine I like to keep my distance because I believe in this message A co-worker of my wife she attended I don't know what church but her husband they gave him a message one of these old books and they were speaking about the message and he read it but the point is this that's where the problem is or wherever wasn't living right he was drinking and it's still others that he was a Christian it really hard it really harms the message that we believe because the example was given brother Branham to follow him that's why the Lord took care of him he was born and don't dishonor your body because it's a word for you so these things that were happening to this man my brother that's just me if he was a brother well I'll drop it he spoke to his wife and my wife spoke to her and she said get away from that yeah this man he did this this and this is and tarnishing our clean message our perfect message and let me tell you something Casa at my house at the very entrance I have the picture Emmanuel [Music] the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why photographia Contigo he said I'm going to take a picture with you because I'm satisfied and there's the pillar the same polarifier that showed up to Paul says and to Moses and so on and so forth you can see it there Anton says so why do they take it out of the churches and their excuses it offends you're offending people then are you relying on the people or God hermano brother what can we do then you're free to think whatever you want but as for me in my house that Jesus Christ is the same yeah yesterday oh today and forever brothers and sisters so it doesn't matter can tell you you messed up here and you messed up there at least I every day every while we're always fighting him and sometimes he is right well then I say devil since he know that he himself he wants you to be miserable since he knows that he has little time left he wants to take he he knows the scriptures Genesis he knows our mistakes you can answer okay okay all right now I'm gonna say your future his future doesn't look too good embargo nevertheless our future because we're under the blood of God it doesn't make it doesn't matter that they knocked down but within him he has the spirit of a champion and he says when you fall [Applause] [Music] waiting for everyone and may he not forget you so what are we in many of us that are Christians the struggle is really heavy it's hot and heavy this world I'll bomb you pero uses but God is the creator of everything they're scared what Lord what can I do trust in the Lord It's Time to trust in the hardest times you must trust in God the Lord help me but if we look like we have a tire that is so smooth the Lord will take care of it don't tempt the Lord that's tempting the Lord without an issue we visited we did what we did and on our way back in Vallarta we were there for about four hours two to three hours before the truck didn't want to go and it was already seven o'clock in the evening and I said what's going on here Lord you can't do this to me I said you know what to my wife we're just going to stay here in this little village this little town the next day we woke up Italian and I was very worried and I said Lord is there something wrong yeah and I spoke the next day I turn on the car issue and I went up the car didn't want to keep going we got to come I spoke to Brothers he says I'll be waiting for you here my name Isuzu truck it is he says I'm going to Phoenix he says well this is your last stop okay and I asked him why because instead of oil air only has water the heads are all broken there's no pressure there's nothing he says I'll give you half an hour 20 minutes and then it's over gracias I said well thank you what do you think brother well it's up to you I said brother okay just one thing and I played some songs it was around 20 hours to praise God because it wasn't my own neglect and Tom says I turned on the car we left yeah that car was still going and going yeah thank God we crossed the borders we got home thank you for bringing me don't rely on your own experience and knowledge I said to the Lord thank you so much Emmanuel just like Peter when Peter was in the water he wanted to walk and he did walk and then suddenly he said like the Americans here can you believe it I can't believe it I'm walking I can't believe it I'm walking and what does it says he says save me Lord I'm perishing in the toughest time you must believe it seems God is in hearing it but he is he knows what you need already but he's waiting for you to speak the words doesn't matter the petition you have it doesn't matter what you have he will give it to you okay because we believe in a real God a living God he's not dead He's Alive I'll get back to what I was reading it's that's part of my house those are personal experiences and as you're walking you're uh you're moving you must have the confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ and everything will be fine foreign [Music] let's keep reading um and the message this day is this scripture fulfilled ours is now I want you to consider the time and age that we now live in with the promised word for today is other ages men could say this day this scripture this day this scripture is fulfilled then what about the scripture for today what's promised for this day where are we standing what hour are we living amen I'm a pause here because I'm laughing at something that I'm about to say mano and where is it what speak a bit about Israel now notice without reaching he said he says where are we standing what hour are we living when the clock is beating the scientific clock three minutes before midnight the world has got the Jitters the Church of corruption that's right there's nobody knows where they're standing what time of day is it our world system is just as rotten I remember the young men that were preaching of the men's that were rotten of the minds we need our minds to be cleansed from everything okay if you give them a good food it's all up to who or which one are you feeding the most these are things that are just falling you're just falling the same okay he says what of the scripture for this day the conditions in the world politics our world system is but I ain't got no business talking about politics partidos I just want to say they're rotten on both sides they're rotten on both sides amen amen I noticed is we're in a really tough time brother stop saying that so much but it's necessary speaks in page 19. he said nothing he says the Jews are now in their homelandacion and they have made up their own Nation their own money this is a member of the United Nations they got their own Army they're all in their Homeland Jesus what Jesus learn a parable of the Fig Tree there they are right back in the nation Armando is living in a dangerous Town there's a lot of people don't know where they're going or coming I passed this there's a pestilences it's a perverted time Hombres and women living with the donors what is that saying look as it was in the days of Lord we're living in the same condition that's why I say we can't live this way anymore there has to be an Awakening an Awakening that we must uh We've for many years have lost I've been nearly 30 40 years in this message I still believe in the return of Brothers I still believe in the tent I can stand I have my white flag Hermanos Brothers our Prophet brought us everything we have the literature our message see entrances my relatives show me the name of William Branham in the Bible and I say I'll make it easy for you I won't tell you to show me the Lord Jesus Christ in the Old Testament show me one of the Apostles but I can say there's the furnaces from Genesis to revelation it's all in there if God used Moses god uses Prophet if God will use the spirit of Elijah five times or four times and then the fifth one is yeah just be patient Hermano my time has gone by oh little Hermano police well we must pray one for each other if you have a feeling as the Lord for if you're feeling for the pain of your brother and your sister your name or your brother your sister and if you have love for them don't have love for him or her then ask yourself is God's love is you must ask yourself if God's love is if you have certain feelings against so and so then ask yourself is the Lord enthroned in your heart I'll close with this once again I'm in debt but it's that I just wanted to point how is it that God can speak to a man he's showing his Visions by his word and what's the other one summarizing todos suenos every dream no Sunday dios are not from God you have to go through the scriptures to see it all the Visions are not from God seven years old you know that is to see if it's from God or from the enemies then throw it away and if the musicians can come there's some you live in here God bless you this morning so we're now good um I was thinking what I said last time if they can play something soft of us being on the
