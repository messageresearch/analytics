[57:36] he's promised to be here and that spirit
[57:40] that you feel is him
[57:43] that's the reason why we've gathered
[57:45] here
[57:47] tonight
[57:49] First Corinthians 13.
[57:53] let's just read verse 10.
[57:58] but when that which is perfect is come
[58:02] then that which is in part shall be done
[58:05] away
[58:09] let's let's just approach him now
[58:13] Heavenly Father
[58:16] Lord we do not deserve to fill your
[58:19] presence as we do
[58:23] we don't deserve this word that you've
[58:26] given us
[58:28] but by the blood of your son you've made
[58:31] us worthy
[58:33] Lord you took a people that were worth
[58:36] nothing
[58:39] and you paid every price that could be
[58:41] paid for them
[58:44] Lord we want to give back to you our
[58:46] life surrender to you Lord

[58:53] eyes and our tongues

[59:10] promised in your word to do Lord
[59:14] and speak to our hearts
[59:21] amen you may be seated
[59:24] I want to thank brother Octavio for the
[59:27] invitation
[59:30] for the trust to let us stand behind

[59:58] there working and working so we could
[1:00:00] have a nice meal so we could have uh
[1:00:03] Fellowship afterwards
[1:00:08] I just want the Lord to give them just a
[1:00:10] double portion if he would amen

[1:01:23] the Lord just seems to make everything
[1:01:26] line up with what you have on your heart
[1:01:31] and so everything for the last few weeks
[1:01:33] I've been hearing is just confirming
[1:01:35] what I had on my heart
[1:01:40] and I pray the Lord gives me the ability
[1:01:43] or he takes over with his ability
[1:01:49] and we'll speak to you this evening
[1:01:52] the scripture says when that which is
[1:01:54] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:01:57] part shall be done away
[1:02:02] and I could I could say let's break this
[1:02:04] scripture down into three parts
[1:02:09] that which is perfect perfecto
[1:02:13] number two is is come
[1:02:17] then that which in part shall be done
[1:02:20] away
[1:02:22] and you say okay well I I can understand
[1:02:25] that you broke the scripture down
[1:02:26] brother
[1:02:29] let's just examine this for a little bit
[1:02:32] that which is perfect
[1:02:35] now this is not a trick question
[1:02:39] let me ask you what is that which is
[1:02:42] perfect
[1:02:44] because if you're expecting something to
[1:02:46] come
[1:02:48] you have to know what it is that you're
[1:02:50] expecting
[1:02:52] otherwise when it gets there you may not
[1:02:54] recognize it when it arrives
[1:02:59] brother Gerald spoke last night and said
[1:03:01] this statement
[1:03:04] and brother Branham says
[1:03:07] the evidence of the holy spirit
[1:03:11] is to be able to recognize receive the
[1:03:14] message for your day
[1:03:18] so in order to recognize and received
[1:03:23] we have to know what it is that we're
[1:03:25] looking for
[1:03:27] and there's only one thing that's
[1:03:30] perfect
[1:03:32] and that is God yes
[1:03:35] that was pretty easy to say Amen to that
[1:03:37] is
[1:03:38] all right and God is in his word
[1:03:44] amen so that makes his word a perfect
[1:03:48] word
[1:03:51] the bride of Christ has the perfect word
[1:03:56] in this day
[1:03:59] no I don't think that that is shocking
[1:04:03] it's not a surprise
[1:04:06] but do you recognize that word while
[1:04:10] it's here
[1:04:13] well you in order to do that
[1:04:16] you have to know what it is that word is
[1:04:18] saying
[1:04:20] amen amen now we were we were sent a
[1:04:24] Vindicated Prophet
[1:04:26] who taught us exactly what that word was
[1:04:29] saying to us
[1:04:32] and because he was saying what the word
[1:04:34] says
[1:04:39] which was God's message
[1:04:42] became a perfect message
[1:04:45] amen now listen if you take what the
[1:04:49] message is saying
[1:04:52] and it starts to replay in your life
[1:04:57] then you become perfecto
[1:05:02] now
[1:05:03] okay now listen
[1:05:05] brother hermano I was good when you said
[1:05:08] that God was perfect
[1:05:11] I was good when you said the Bible was
[1:05:13] perfect
[1:05:15] when you said the message was perfect
[1:05:19] when you said I was perfect
[1:05:23] I don't know I don't know about that
[1:05:27] and the reason why we think that is
[1:05:31] because they have mirrors
[1:05:36] and we can look in the mirror you know
[1:05:38] we can look at our own thoughts
[1:05:41] in our own hearts
[1:05:44] and we think well I'm not perfect
[1:05:49] when is it brother that I'm going to get
[1:05:52] to this Perfection here
[1:05:56] okay
[1:05:57] Matthew 5 48.
[1:06:00] which I think we know this scripture but
[1:06:03] let's just read it
[1:06:06] Matthew 5 48 says this is
[1:06:12] therefore
[1:06:15] perfectos even as your father which is
[1:06:18] in heaven is perfect
[1:06:21] he is not asking you to be perfect
[1:06:27] what what color are those are those this
[1:06:30] sentence in your Bible is it red what is
[1:06:32] this is Jesus he's not suggesting to you
[1:06:38] I think it'd be a really good idea if
[1:06:40] you were perfect
[1:06:43] would you work on that foreign
[1:06:53] Watson I don't know about you
[1:06:57] but that's a tall order
[1:07:02] the Lord God who created everything
[1:07:06] is
[1:07:09] okay he's not telling the group of
[1:07:12] people here
[1:07:13] we know that right we've gathered
[1:07:16] together as a church
[1:07:18] but this message is
[1:07:21] to the individual soul
[1:07:24] so when God says be perfect
[1:07:30] he's talking to you the individual
[1:07:33] individual which means it doesn't matter
[1:07:35] what the person next to you is
[1:07:39] you are called to Perfection
[1:07:43] amen amen that's good
[1:07:51] he doesn't say here's how you do it
[1:07:54] he says in the same way that my father
[1:07:57] is perfect
[1:08:00] not a different way
[1:08:02] in the same way he is perfect
[1:08:06] be perfect perfecto
[1:08:11] and then the chapter just ends
[1:08:15] and we're left with an order a
[1:08:19] Commandments
[1:08:20] from God himself
[1:08:23] that's a tall order
[1:08:27] and it goes back to this statement
[1:08:30] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:08:34] well that was a really good scripture
[1:08:36] when I was thinking about the word
[1:08:37] brother Gerald
[1:08:40] oh when I was thinking about Jesus
[1:08:42] coming to Earth
[1:08:45] but now that scripture it's talking
[1:08:49] about me habla de me
[1:08:52] now now if you're the bride of Christ
[1:08:56] you will take every word and find your
[1:08:59] name
[1:09:03] amen
[1:09:07] you know the bride of Christ is
[1:09:10] perfect it's perfect could we say Amen
[1:09:14] to that
[1:09:14] I don't think that's controversial right
[1:09:19] a statement like that
[1:09:22] can have two effects
[1:09:25] it can be encouraging foreign
[1:10:01] and the reason why it can discourage is
[1:10:05] because you see your mistakes
[1:10:09] or or do you not or am I the only one
[1:10:11] that sees the mistakes
[1:10:13] even if we've tried to say we didn't see
[1:10:16] him
[1:10:17] we see them
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:22] do something wrong and then try to go to
[1:10:24] bed with a clear conscience
[1:10:26] your
[1:10:30] mouth can say you're fine
[1:10:33] but your spirit won't let you rest amen
[1:10:38] amen
[1:10:39] so sometimes when you hear and preachers
[1:10:43] will preach the bride is perfect it's
[1:10:44] perfect
[1:10:48] is it a little easy to feel left out
[1:10:52] honestly it's a little easy to feel like
[1:10:56] well I'm not there yet
[1:10:59] right and then what the devil does
[1:11:03] he says yeah you're because you're not
[1:11:05] the bride is
[1:11:09] you're not the bride you're not perfect
[1:11:12] look what you just did this morning
[1:11:16] look what you just did the afternoon
[1:11:19] look what's going on through your mind
[1:11:22] look at this mistake you made
[1:11:26] and he has a right to tell you that is
[1:11:33] but too many times
[1:11:35] we care more about what the devil thinks
[1:11:38] of us and what God thinks of us
[1:11:42] and God will say something about us
[1:11:47] and then the devil will say something
[1:11:51] and sometimes we listen to the devil
[1:11:53] more yeah
[1:11:54] Diablo right
[1:11:57] we're looking at our flesh
[1:12:00] this flesh
[1:12:03] this isn't perfect
[1:12:05] that's the problem
[1:12:07] if this is perfect
[1:12:09] then we wouldn't need another body
[1:12:11] waiting for it
[1:12:14] and the problem is if you have a perfect
[1:12:17] bride okay
[1:12:20] trapped inside an imperfect body
[1:12:24] and if you judge your soul
[1:12:28] based upon your flesh
[1:12:30] you're going to put yourself out of the
[1:12:32] Bride what's this
[1:12:34] right here akimismo
[1:12:36] and then when a message comes across
[1:12:40] that says the bride is
[1:12:44] perfecta you live more discouraged
[1:12:47] animal then you came
[1:12:49] now I'm not saying you do this I'm
[1:12:52] saying this is what can happen
[1:12:57] we need to go we're judging our soul
[1:13:00] based on our flesh
[1:13:03] and what we need to happen is
[1:13:06] we need to go deeper than that
[1:13:09] and we need a word of God
[1:13:14] we need a spoken word of God to come on
[1:13:17] the scene
[1:13:20] at that moment we need something that is
[1:13:23] perfect
[1:13:25] to come
[1:13:28] because in my understanding
[1:13:32] which is in part
[1:13:35] it's just in part I see my goodness
[1:13:40] but I need to see that I am a perfected
[1:13:44] Son of God
[1:13:48] amen amen
[1:13:50] we must realize
[1:13:54] what lays inside the heart of the True
[1:13:56] Believer
[1:14:01] everything now now maybe this is going
[1:14:04] to sound confusing
[1:14:07] everything that has ever happened
[1:14:11] and never will happen
[1:14:14] and that ever existed
[1:14:15] lives in the heart of the believer
[1:14:18] well now you're like brother what do I
[1:14:21] do with that you said
[1:14:25] what lays inside of you is eternity
[1:14:31] so that's everything that ever was and
[1:14:33] ever will be and
[1:14:36] everything that never had a beginning
[1:14:44] in what form in que forma
[1:14:48] while God is a spirit
[1:14:50] God is eternal
[1:14:54] but there came a time
[1:14:56] when God spoke
[1:15:00] he spoke before the foundation of the
[1:15:02] world
[1:15:03] before there was time
[1:15:06] in his mind he saw somebody
[1:15:14] there's not a preacher in the world
[1:15:21] that could tell you truly who he saw
[1:15:27] you have to meet the Lord
[1:15:32] and when you truly meet him
[1:15:34] and you truly know him
[1:15:38] you will come to the realization
[1:15:41] that he saw you okay if you're the
[1:15:45] foundation of the world
[1:15:48] he didn't see a group of people
[1:15:59] now that sounds good
[1:16:04] but that has to be a reveal to you by
[1:16:08] the Holy Spirit
[1:16:09] and when that is revealed to you by the
[1:16:12] Holy Spirit
[1:16:14] you can never be defeated it
[1:16:19] has never be defeated again
[1:16:22] you might lose a battle
[1:16:25] you might lose a day
[1:16:28] but you have a victory that's already
[1:16:31] been won yeah
[1:16:34] because because what we're living right
[1:16:37] now
[1:16:39] is the manifestation of what has already
[1:16:43] taken place in God
[1:16:45] so if you know God
[1:16:48] you know what's taken place
[1:16:51] and you know what's about to become
[1:16:53] manifested
[1:16:57] let's read the scripture first John we
[1:17:01] doing okay sir
[1:17:03] all right I gotta I'm not worried about
[1:17:05] the time brother but I do have a timer
[1:17:07] running just just in case
[1:17:15] I believe it's chapter three
[1:17:22] our thoughts and that which is perfect
[1:17:25] is
[1:17:30] first John 3. everybody have it
[1:17:33] verse 9.
[1:17:35] whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[1:17:40] sin he said
[1:17:45] for his seed remaineth in him
[1:17:50] and he cannot sin
[1:17:53] because he is born of God
[1:17:59] thank the Lord for that
[1:18:04] it doesn't say that you can't sin
[1:18:06] because you have willpower
[1:18:12] you didn't sin because you're good
[1:18:15] you didn't sin because you deserve it
[1:18:19] no you didn't you don't sin um because
[1:18:23] of him
[1:18:32] this is for if our heart condemn us
[1:18:38] let's just stop right there
[1:18:41] how many cuantos
[1:18:43] could say your heart condemns you
[1:18:46] sometimes
[1:18:51] try to say that it doesn't condemn you
[1:18:53] since
[1:18:54] and I wonder if you have a conscience at
[1:18:56] all
[1:18:58] but there's another man living inside of
[1:19:01] there
[1:19:03] he's not going to let you forget
[1:19:10] that if your heart condemned you
[1:19:14] he is greater than your heart
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] and why is he greater
[1:19:22] because he knows all things
[1:19:25] see the beautiful part about God
[1:19:29] and this is the absolute Sovereign Grace
[1:19:32] of God yes
[1:19:34] absolutely
[1:19:35] he does not look at you like you look at
[1:19:39] you
[1:19:42] I don't know if I don't know if you if
[1:19:44] you could understand that
[1:19:47] does not look at you the way you see
[1:19:50] yourself
[1:19:52] you know what he sees
[1:19:55] a Perfect Bride
[1:19:58] oh yeah see no matter what any man says
[1:20:04] he doesn't listen to them
[1:20:06] you don't think the devil goes to God
[1:20:10] he went to God and talked about job and
[1:20:12] foreign
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:52] go try them and find out
[1:20:55] you'll find out he's my Perfect Bride
[1:21:02] why porque how can God do that
[1:21:05] because we're sinless
[1:21:08] anybody wake up and not make a mistake
[1:21:11] yet
[1:21:13] all right good no hands okay when
[1:21:17] so
[1:21:22] you say God doesn't see my sins
[1:21:26] God doesn't even know that sin exists
[1:21:29] because
[1:21:32] he sees the beginning
[1:21:36] and past the end into
[1:21:40] eternity
[1:21:42] if he saw your sins
[1:21:45] he would have to destroy you
[1:21:52] so if you're standing here you're
[1:21:54] sitting here tonight
[1:21:56] that's evidence he has not seen yourself
[1:22:01] what does he see
[1:22:03] we know what he says
[1:22:06] he sees his son slain
[1:22:10] he sees the blood you know there's a
[1:22:14] there's a there's a quote I don't have
[1:22:16] this quote
[1:22:18] it's in the message of Grace
[1:22:23] I'll never I probably quote this every
[1:22:25] time I speak
[1:22:28] I don't know that I've heard more
[1:22:31] tremendous words ever in one sentence
[1:22:41] you and I this is
[1:22:44] killed his son
[1:22:49] he says we nailed him to the cross with
[1:22:52] our sins
[1:22:58] and he said and then he takes the blood
[1:23:02] from the Sun that we killed
[1:23:05] and washes us clean of the crimes
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:14] if you don't know that God is
[1:23:17] I could see why you don't know that
[1:23:19] you're perfect
[1:23:22] that's the God you have to come to know
[1:23:26] he took the blood of the son that we
[1:23:28] killed that I killed
[1:23:31] again it's not a group
[1:23:34] I the individual
[1:23:37] I killed his son
[1:23:39] and he took that blood yes
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:48] clean limpio
[1:23:50] and to God
[1:23:52] it never happened
[1:23:56] I I don't know if we could just lay a
[1:23:58] hold of that
[1:24:00] it never happened
[1:24:06] my heart can condemn me still
[1:24:09] but he's greater than my heart
[1:24:13] he knows all things
[1:24:26] can I redo you a quote
[1:24:31] and
[1:24:33] this is from the unconditional Covenant
[1:24:35] that God made with his people
[1:24:38] we were discussing this the other night
[1:24:40] yeah
[1:24:43] you say brother Branham
[1:24:46] I've done something the other day
[1:24:49] and I'm afraid that the Lord won't heal
[1:24:51] me tonight
[1:24:56] does that sound familiar
[1:24:59] brother Brown says oh yes he will if
[1:25:01] this is
[1:25:10] just sit still
[1:25:13] he gives you two things you got to do
[1:25:17] are you ready
[1:25:23] foreign
[1:25:57] now that's hard to do
[1:25:59] I don't know about you you said brother
[1:26:02] repenting
[1:26:04] all I got to do is repent
[1:26:07] you know you know what I think keeps us
[1:26:09] from repenting uh
[1:26:13] our imagination
[1:26:15] imagination you know if I wronged my
[1:26:17] brother Emmanuel
[1:26:19] and I wronged him really badly yeah
[1:26:23] and I know I have to repent is
[1:26:27] my imagination will make that situation
[1:26:30] me imagination
[1:26:32] way worse than it needs to be okay
[1:26:39] I don't know if that's happened to you
[1:26:40] or not
[1:26:41] let's just let's just get right down to
[1:26:43] where we're at
[1:26:46] husbands esposos if you've done
[1:26:48] something against your wife
[1:26:50] and you know you have to repent
[1:26:54] does your imagination try to work out
[1:26:56] how that's going to go
[1:26:59] and you end up talking yourself out of
[1:27:01] it
[1:27:08] you've done if you've done something
[1:27:10] wrong
[1:27:12] your imagination
[1:27:15] makes repentance almost impossible
[1:27:19] with the relief
[1:27:21] the relief is on the other side of that
[1:27:25] repentance
[1:27:27] and I don't care what it cost you
[1:27:31] you got to get to that repentance
[1:27:36] not once a year
[1:27:39] not once a month not
[1:27:42] even once a day brother
[1:27:47] every minute of the day
[1:27:51] I don't want to be like that
[1:27:53] I don't want to think those Stars
[1:27:56] I don't want to be that man or that
[1:27:59] woman
[1:28:00] Lord I Repent I want to move on
[1:28:05] you might fall right on your face
[1:28:09] you get back up again
[1:28:15] always say brother I've tried that you
[1:28:17] said he said then maybe you need to
[1:28:19] repent he says and start moving on
[1:28:22] if there's something in your life that's
[1:28:24] causing you to fall
[1:28:29] oh that's hard yes especially if it's
[1:28:33] this is
[1:28:36] something that's causing you to fall
[1:28:40] you need to move on from it so
[1:28:45] all right
[1:28:48] he says you're a Christian repent for
[1:28:50] what you've done and go on
[1:28:54] he says
[1:28:57] don't make any difference
[1:29:00] this is the prophet of God now
[1:29:03] don't make any difference
[1:29:06] repent and go on
[1:29:09] he says you're scared
[1:29:12] the first little thing that comes along
[1:29:16] you turn your head away
[1:29:19] you think God's Gonna condemn you
[1:29:22] he says repentance
[1:29:26] he says in another later on in this
[1:29:30] message
[1:29:33] you if you've got the Holy Ghost this is
[1:29:40] if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:45] now how many aura cuantos
[1:29:49] how many have the Holy ghosts
[1:29:53] okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I want to tell
[1:29:55] you something that somebody told me
[1:29:59] forever changed how I answered that
[1:30:02] question
[1:30:05] he said your hands should go up he said
[1:30:10] and the reason why is
[1:30:13] because you can't get it
[1:30:16] until you believe you got it
[1:30:22] so even if you look at yourself in the
[1:30:24] mirror
[1:30:26] and you think Ah Holy Ghost a holy ghost
[1:30:29] filled Christian wouldn't do the things
[1:30:31] I'm doing
[1:30:35] raise their hand up
[1:30:40] and move on
[1:30:42] and watch God honor his word
[1:30:47] by giving you the Holy Ghost
[1:30:50] not when you believe
[1:30:53] after you believe
[1:30:55] there's there's a quote
[1:30:57] that God can only do for you
[1:31:01] what you believe he's already done for
[1:31:04] you okay
[1:31:06] he can only give you the Holy Ghost
[1:31:10] if you believe he's given you the Holy
[1:31:12] Ghost
[1:31:13] so I don't care what you feel like
[1:31:17] I don't care if you were committed the
[1:31:19] worst sin
[1:31:22] right now in your heart
[1:31:24] from that sin repentance and say Lord I
[1:31:29] want the Holy Ghost
[1:31:32] and when somebody says do you have the
[1:31:34] Holy Ghost
[1:31:36] you could start looking back at all the
[1:31:38] things you've done
[1:31:41] oh you can come to this Bible right here
[1:31:44] that says whosoever is born of God
[1:31:48] it's impossible for them to sin is
[1:31:51] impossible
[1:31:52] it's impossible for you to sin it's
[1:31:55] impossible
[1:31:57] because I have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:02] but if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:06] your God's child he says
[1:32:12] you have an unconditional Covenant
[1:32:15] Covenant
[1:32:17] Written In Your Heart by God Almighty
[1:32:21] who can't take it back
[1:32:26] he can't take it back
[1:32:29] do something wrong
[1:32:33] oh here's here's the Holy Ghost brother
[1:32:35] this is
[1:32:39] how God works
[1:32:42] he's not gonna take it back from you
[1:32:45] there's a quote here brother I didn't I
[1:32:48] didn't print this out but he says this
[1:32:51] is
[1:32:53] the Covenant people
[1:32:59] unconditionally
[1:33:01] God called you out of the world
[1:33:05] gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:33:08] the Seed of Abraham
[1:33:10] you are tonight
[1:33:13] with a blessed promise
[1:33:21] if your Abraham seeds
[1:33:24] you have this promise in you
[1:33:28] you believe God
[1:33:31] regardless of what takes place
[1:33:34] now listen to this
[1:33:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:39] makes you believe it anyhow
[1:33:44] you say brother
[1:33:45] I'm trying so hard to believe
[1:33:49] no you need to let the Holy Ghost
[1:33:51] believe it is
[1:33:54] I don't know I don't know did you catch
[1:33:56] that brother I'm trying so hard to
[1:33:59] resist
[1:34:01] but the Bible says resist the devil and
[1:34:03] he'll flee produce
[1:34:05] without the resistor inside
[1:34:10] brother the Bible says I need to be an
[1:34:13] overcomer
[1:34:14] get the Overcomer inside of you
[1:34:18] and watch him go to work
[1:34:21] everything that the Bible says for you
[1:34:24] to do
[1:34:26] you'll find out that it's really him
[1:34:28] that's going to do it
[1:34:31] the Bible tells you brother Marcos
[1:34:37] he's going to be the one that does it
[1:34:41] because you can't do it
[1:34:46] God's children
[1:34:50] unconditionally
[1:34:52] you don't deserve your healing
[1:34:56] that's the word of the Prophet is you
[1:35:00] don't deserve your healing
[1:35:02] not a one of us in here
[1:35:06] that deserves to even hear the gospel
[1:35:12] there's not one of you deserves the
[1:35:15] grace of Jesus Christ
[1:35:23] but God by Grace
[1:35:28] he did it anyhow
[1:35:31] that's right there's none of you deserve
[1:35:34] your healing
[1:35:36] he says every one of you ought to die
[1:35:41] me too brother Branham says
[1:35:44] we don't deserve to live on the earth
[1:35:48] that's right we don't deserve to look at
[1:35:52] God's creation
[1:35:55] but God promised us
[1:35:58] and he cannot lie
[1:36:02] he swore that he would do it
[1:36:05] healing belongs to us
[1:36:12] right here Hakeem
[1:36:16] right here akimismo oh it's it's lovely
[1:36:19] when I see my brother and sister get
[1:36:21] healed
[1:36:24] but I need it
[1:36:27] and this is a one-on-one relationship
[1:36:30] with the giver yes
[1:36:33] the Holy Ghost belongs to us
[1:36:40] you have ownership
[1:36:44] you have ownership
[1:36:46] of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:49] you want to talk about living below our
[1:36:51] privileges
[1:37:03] it's yours
[1:37:06] it was bought and given to you free of
[1:37:09] charge foreign
[1:37:56] you don't have to go obtain it is
[1:38:12] healing belongs to us
[1:38:14] salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost
[1:38:18] belongs to us
[1:38:20] Heaven belongs to us
[1:38:22] now we're the sons of God
[1:38:26] and now we're sitting in Heavenly places
[1:38:28] in Christ Jesus Jesus
[1:38:33] hmm
[1:38:34] if we could just get this
[1:38:39] let me check my time okay we're doing
[1:38:42] okay soon
[1:38:48] all right
[1:38:49] that which is perfect is come
[1:38:58] then that which is in part will be done
[1:39:00] away
[1:39:02] what does that mean que significa it's
[1:39:06] the Fulfillment
[1:39:08] of the word of God
[1:39:12] a word of God
[1:39:14] was spoken
[1:39:17] and when he spoke it
[1:39:19] went out salio
[1:39:23] where did it go
[1:39:25] it went to the place where it would
[1:39:29] become Manifesto manifestation
[1:39:32] All Through the Bible
[1:39:35] the Bible says this
[1:39:37] all through the Bible the word of the
[1:39:41] Lord
[1:39:46] the word of the Lord
[1:39:48] came unto Isaiah we know Isaiah the word
[1:39:52] of the Lord
[1:39:54] came unto Nathan
[1:39:57] the word of the Lord came unto Samuel
[1:40:00] the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah
[1:40:07] those were who those were prophets
[1:40:09] foreign
[1:40:49] and all of a sudden you have Samuel yeah
[1:40:52] or Nathan or Elijah or Elisha or Eliseo
[1:40:57] speaking the word of God
[1:40:59] where does that word come from
[1:41:03] if God was there
[1:41:05] and he just wanted to speak
[1:41:08] why would he need a prophet
[1:41:11] he could just show up and
[1:41:14] speak yeah
[1:41:17] but this word
[1:41:20] when when Abraham is told
[1:41:23] get up out of your tent
[1:41:26] leave your father's house
[1:41:29] and go into a land which I have prepared
[1:41:32] for you
[1:41:33] that word was spoken before there was
[1:41:36] even time is
[1:41:39] there anything was created
[1:41:42] God spoke those words
[1:41:45] and they went forth into time
[1:41:48] and they were picked up by Abraham
[1:41:51] a prophet of the old
[1:41:54] testamental amen amen it was a perfect
[1:41:57] word
[1:41:58] when God spoke
[1:42:00] amen amen When God Says something
[1:42:04] it's just as good as it happening right
[1:42:07] then
[1:42:09] if God speaks I'm going to heal you
[1:42:12] tonight
[1:42:14] it's just as good as if it happened
[1:42:16] right there
[1:42:19] if he says I'm gonna manifestado
[1:42:40] and that which is in part
[1:42:42] it's done away
[1:42:49] yeah
[1:42:50] God before the foundation of the world
[1:42:54] he spoke a word
[1:42:58] now I I picked on brother Marcus
[1:43:04] how many who would be brave enough to
[1:43:06] raise their hands
[1:43:08] brother what's your name
[1:43:10] brother Isaac before the foundation of
[1:43:13] the world
[1:43:16] God said these words
[1:43:23] I
[1:43:25] love you I'm gonna die for you
[1:43:30] when
[1:43:33] you came to the altar yeah
[1:43:37] when Jesus hung on the cross
[1:43:40] before the foundation of the world the
[1:43:43] lamb was already slain
[1:43:48] and I love you and I'll do anything to
[1:43:52] have you with me
[1:43:54] look at my eyes
[1:43:56] you are perfect it is perfecto
[1:44:04] God is not stuck in time like we are
[1:44:10] you know where he is
[1:44:12] just past your repentance
[1:44:18] he's not waiting for you to repentance
[1:44:22] he's waiting over there where you've
[1:44:24] already repented
[1:44:31] come on to me
[1:44:33] I already see you yeah has repented
[1:44:40] before you even do it
[1:44:44] when did he save you when you raised
[1:44:48] your hand
[1:44:48] listen now when did he give you the Holy
[1:44:51] Ghost
[1:44:52] when you raised your hand a moment ago
[1:44:55] the foundation of the world
[1:45:01] it had to come to a place
[1:45:03] where it became
[1:45:06] a perfect words
[1:45:14] we have to accept
[1:45:17] what he's already done for us
[1:45:26] how did that word
[1:45:30] know where to go
[1:45:32] look Isaac how did that no word know
[1:45:36] where to find you is
[1:45:39] we say brother it's God
[1:45:43] he knows
[1:45:45] but he spoke this word
[1:45:48] Before Time exists
[1:45:50] how did it know where to come and find
[1:45:53] you
[1:45:54] because he placed in you
[1:45:58] back then
[1:46:04] and that word that seed yes
[1:46:07] contains everything that ever was all
[1:46:12] eternity everything that God is
[1:46:15] he put in and divided out to his
[1:46:20] his bride
[1:46:24] a part of me right here part of me right
[1:46:28] here
[1:46:28] no now listen
[1:46:31] you got to claim that is
[1:46:35] right who who did he send it out to I
[1:46:37] can't tell ambio
[1:46:39] right here a key I don't care what's
[1:46:42] going on around
[1:46:45] I don't care what I think
[1:46:48] he placed it right here hello
[1:46:57] can take it out of his hands
[1:47:01] isn't it great
[1:47:05] guarded his seed
[1:47:08] that he placed in your heart
[1:47:11] against even you mismo
[1:47:15] perfecto
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:47:52] it it's a paradox
[1:47:55] how could God see me perfect perfecto
[1:47:59] because he spoke
[1:48:01] a perfect word perfecta
[1:48:05] or or is any of us
[1:48:08] gonna tell God
[1:48:10] I think you got it wrong
[1:48:14] okay now listen if you say oh I'm not
[1:48:19] perfect Perfecto you know what you're
[1:48:22] telling god
[1:48:23] you messed up
[1:48:27] you got it wrong
[1:48:29] no we wouldn't do that
[1:48:31] but if you have the attitude
[1:48:37] that you're not worthy
[1:48:39] that you're nothing because nada
[1:48:43] we know we're nothing
[1:48:44] we know that yeah
[1:48:48] but yet
[1:48:49] the most priceless thing that ever was
[1:48:56] traded for your life
[1:49:00] so when I say oh I'm nothing
[1:49:04] I'm saying that the blood of Jesus
[1:49:06] Christ is nothing
[1:49:09] because that's what purchased me
[1:49:14] and if he took the Precious Blood of his
[1:49:16] son to buy you
[1:49:18] precious
[1:49:20] to be worth at least as much
[1:49:26] Brandon would say I see something
[1:49:29] greater here tonight
[1:49:36] he says I see the purchases
[1:49:41] it's time to start knowing what we're
[1:49:45] worth
[1:49:51] no no it makes you small
[1:49:55] does it make you uh
[1:49:57] does it make you look down on the world
[1:50:01] no no it makes you
[1:50:05] want them to have what you have
[1:50:10] as much as you want it yourself
[1:50:18] where you came from
[1:50:21] if you know that he saw you before the
[1:50:25] foundation of the world
[1:50:28] you want that for every persona
[1:50:34] now it's not up to you
[1:50:37] but the bride of Christ
[1:50:39] will not be crying for judgment
[1:50:43] he's crying for grace
[1:50:50] and trying to win souls
[1:50:57] the only people that are calling for
[1:51:00] judgment is
[1:51:02] someone who believes that they're
[1:51:04] righteous of their own self is
[1:51:08] now that's a rebuke to me
[1:51:11] because I've been guilty of calling for
[1:51:13] judgments
[1:51:16] that sin if God saw that
[1:51:23] but what about mine
[1:51:25] oh he forgave me brother
[1:51:29] hmm
[1:51:30] it's funny how that works
[1:51:35] I don't know
[1:51:36] I've been about 15 minutes can you go
[1:51:38] for just a few more minutes
[1:51:45] personal
[1:51:47] brother Brown says this and things that
[1:51:49] are to be in 65.
[1:51:57] our goal they say Joyride and prepare a
[1:52:00] place for you
[1:52:03] take you out of this pest house
[1:52:08] and deliver you into my father's house
[1:52:12] there you are take you out of this old
[1:52:16] Earthly past house
[1:52:19] he's gone to prepare a place
[1:52:22] a perfect place
[1:52:26] where no evil exists
[1:52:29] no sickness exists
[1:52:33] no old age exists
[1:52:40] I mean I'm not even older than that one
[1:52:42] made me happy
[1:52:43] yes
[1:52:45] no old age exists
[1:52:48] and no death exists
[1:52:51] he says it's a perfect place
[1:52:55] that's calling you
[1:52:58] to that Perfection
[1:53:02] and you have to now listen
[1:53:04] it does not say and you'll be perfect
[1:53:08] when you get there
[1:53:10] it says and you have to be perfect
[1:53:15] to get there
[1:53:24] in order to belong in heaven
[1:53:29] it's like saying I need to be perfect
[1:53:33] so that could be perfect
[1:53:35] it doesn't work that way
[1:53:38] the Bible said so
[1:53:41] Jesus said be ye therefore perfect Jesus
[1:53:44] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:53:48] it's a perfect Kingdom
[1:53:51] so it must be a perfect people come
[1:53:57] when that which is perfect
[1:54:03] because you have to stand
[1:54:07] and be married to a perfect Son of God
[1:54:12] perfect I don't know I don't know what
[1:54:14] that does to you
[1:54:16] you have to stand
[1:54:18] and be married to a perfect Son of God
[1:54:23] so you must be a perfect bride
[1:54:28] so how can you do it
[1:54:31] through anything else
[1:54:37] which is
[1:54:39] the Waters of Separation
[1:54:42] that washes us from our sins
[1:54:47] the word of God bleeding blood
[1:54:54] yes sir she stands perfect yeah is
[1:54:59] perfect unadulterated
[1:55:03] she never sinned in the first place
[1:55:09] [Applause]
[1:55:11] I know what the devil's doing
[1:55:13] it through your mind
[1:55:15] things you've done wrong
[1:55:17] you might take his word
[1:55:20] I'm going to take a perfect word
[1:55:23] now listen his word that makes sense but
[1:55:29] it's not perfect
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:31] it makes sense to this right here
[1:55:38] but there's a seed inside
[1:55:42] that
[1:55:44] he died to pay for my sins so
[1:55:53] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:55:56] beyond logic is
[1:55:59] beyond reasoning
[1:56:01] and what would seem to the world to be
[1:56:04] insane
[1:56:06] the seed inside can say amen
[1:56:11] I jaw these words
[1:56:19] Como
[1:56:24] how Como
[1:56:27] he said she never sinned in the first
[1:56:30] place
[1:56:32] she was trapped into it
[1:56:37] I'm telling you that I'm telling you the
[1:56:39] devil's going to God
[1:56:42] and he'll take the he'll take the Bible
[1:56:44] to God
[1:56:46] he'll say right here
[1:56:51] if they did this that was a sin against
[1:56:55] you
[1:56:56] look at what my brother did
[1:56:59] I got the videos
[1:57:04] is
[1:57:15] uh
[1:57:16] I don't know if that fires you up
[1:57:20] the Lord God
[1:57:22] can we say it this way foreign
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:57] that's how now this is our this is our
[1:58:00] little brains trying to figure this out
[1:58:05] on an eternal scale what the Lord thinks
[1:58:07] of you
[1:58:10] now listen how do you commas become
[1:58:15] perfect yeah I said Perfecto we'll close
[1:58:18] at this
[1:58:21] the word of God
[1:58:31] and he said no put yourself there
[1:58:36] he said
[1:58:38] you
[1:58:40] right here okay perfect it's perfect and
[1:58:44] I love you and I watch you eat and
[1:58:49] you're mine it is Mia
[1:58:51] and everything you have need of it
[1:58:55] belongs to you because I I own the
[1:58:59] cattle in a thousand hills
[1:59:02] I own everything
[1:59:04] and what's Mineo it's yours
[1:59:08] okay those words
[1:59:11] they went out saliero you know when they
[1:59:14] went out
[1:59:16] when he was writing your name in this
[1:59:18] book
[1:59:21] I could just see him writing my name is
[1:59:25] oh I just can't wait till you're here
[1:59:27] with me
[1:59:29] I can't wait until you know what it is
[1:59:32] I've done for you
[1:59:37] and a perfect word salio
[1:59:46] if God does thing one way
[1:59:51] he'll do it that way every time is that
[1:59:55] the word
[1:59:56] when God needed to speak to Abraham
[2:00:01] he needed a prophet Abraham
[2:00:04] when he needed to speak to the children
[2:00:06] of Israel
[2:00:09] he always had a prophet
[2:00:12] amen amen and the word of the Lord
[2:00:16] came unto Isaiah he came unto Jeremiah
[2:00:21] it came unto Elijah it came into Elijah
[2:00:33] amen amen but now listen
[2:00:39] if he does things one way
[2:00:43] he's going to do him that way every time
[2:00:48] brother Branham Branham was the prophet
[2:00:52] to this age
[2:00:55] he said
[2:00:58] if there's only one member of the Bride
[2:01:03] you better believe it's you say
[2:01:09] now now listen I don't think that he
[2:01:12] believed there was only one
[2:01:14] that's not what he was trying to say is
[2:01:18] because if that's the case foreign
[2:01:25] because I believe I'm not one
[2:01:27] what he was trying to get across to us
[2:01:30] is
[2:01:32] that the word of God
[2:01:34] that came from a prophet
[2:01:40] is now a perfect word of God
[2:01:44] through a prophet uh
[2:01:48] the individual soul
[2:01:52] hey man I'm in now listen
[2:01:59] the word went out
[2:02:01] and you say brother you said this
[2:02:03] hermano I've searched in the message
[2:02:07] and I can I can see where I belong in
[2:02:09] there
[2:02:11] but like you said last night brother
[2:02:14] I need a word to me
[2:02:18] I need this word I need it to be sure
[2:02:24] now listen
[2:02:29] brother Brown says this he says
[2:02:32] let me give you
[2:02:34] let me give you about a two-minute
[2:02:36] background
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:42] I was in the middle of a of uh I was
[2:02:44] listening to two sides of a dispute
[2:02:50] and this dispute was big enough to split
[2:02:53] two men who believed the same apart
[2:02:59] and one man made the statement
[2:03:02] only que solo the prophet of God has
[2:03:06] thus saith the Lord
[2:03:09] and it's in the word yes and the other
[2:03:12] brother said
[2:03:18] the Lord and it was in the word and I
[2:03:22] was listening and now you forgive me you
[2:03:26] might know the answer already
[2:03:28] but at the time I didn't know the
[2:03:30] answers
[2:03:33] but there was an answer and I knew where
[2:03:37] to go for that is
[2:03:43] just just I'm simple just break this
[2:03:45] down
[2:03:49] and I and I I prayed about it for about
[2:03:50] three months
[2:03:53] and one day I walk into church
[2:03:56] and I go to the library
[2:03:59] and I grab a random email
[2:04:03] it's not random but I never read it
[2:04:07] before
[2:04:13] and then I get to a paragraph
[2:04:17] it didn't have anything to do with the
[2:04:19] rest of what he preached
[2:04:24] and he said that's the way
[2:04:28] the church is a prophet today this is
[2:04:37] ought to be fully identified by the word
[2:04:40] of God
[2:04:42] is
[2:04:44] the prophet is
[2:04:49] and I got an answer is
[2:04:54] that both men were right
[2:04:57] and like brother Branham said
[2:05:00] you both believe the same thing
[2:05:03] but you don't know it
[2:05:05] and he says the devil's he says it's in
[2:05:08] the meeting God had explained
[2:05:11] he says the devil's got you pointing
[2:05:14] your guns at each other
[2:05:21] the men were saying the truth
[2:05:25] but it was were they willing to see the
[2:05:28] other side of what somebody else was
[2:05:29] saying
[2:05:32] and I never forgot that is but listen
[2:05:36] now
[2:05:40] if you individually now
[2:05:44] believe that he saw you
[2:05:47] and that he spoke your name
[2:05:51] and that those words went out
[2:05:54] they have to come to a place where they
[2:05:57] come to pass
[2:05:59] they're a perfect word
[2:06:02] but they're meant for a predestinated
[2:06:05] point in time pero foreign
[2:06:40] foreign
[2:07:12] Novia
[2:07:22] Eliezer told he said Lord I want this
[2:07:25] you can always have to do this and by
[2:07:29] that I'll know she's the one yeah
[2:07:32] and she listened to that prophet
[2:07:35] and then when her parents said you
[2:07:37] should stay here
[2:07:46] the parents said well what do you want
[2:07:47] to do
[2:07:49] Rebecca says I'm going with the service
[2:07:53] I'm going with
[2:07:58] they take a journey
[2:08:03] this is
[2:08:04] we we put brother Branham
[2:08:08] in the place where God wants them when
[2:08:10] we do this
[2:08:13] was to introduce
[2:08:23] because there reached a point
[2:08:26] the Bible says in the evening times
[2:08:30] where that Camel train reached its
[2:08:33] destination
[2:08:36] and Rebecca asked the servants
[2:08:41] is that
[2:08:43] is that Isaac
[2:09:08] is that I'm A Perfect Bride
[2:09:11] to a perfect room
[2:09:14] and when she saw Isaac
[2:09:17] nothing else matters
[2:09:32] who made it to the place where it was
[2:09:34] become manifested manifestation
[2:09:38] you are listen now
[2:09:41] you will stand are not going to be
[2:09:46] Perfecto you are perfecto
[2:09:52] you are not going to be sinless
[2:09:56] you are sinless
[2:10:03] because it's a perfect word of God
[2:10:08] and God idios
[2:10:11] he dwells both where he spoke it is
[2:10:21] it's the same question as how many in
[2:10:24] here islamism questions
[2:10:36] how many in here
[2:10:38] I do not care no importa what you do
[2:10:42] or your faults or your struggles I have
[2:10:47] them too how many in here
[2:10:52] present tense
[2:10:53] perfect perfect
[2:10:57] yeah
[2:10:59] now listen
[2:11:02] when you know that so
[2:11:07] it's because you know that he saw you
[2:11:12] before time
[2:11:14] before creation
[2:11:20] when he was thinking about what he was
[2:11:22] going to make
[2:11:24] I was in him
[2:11:27] right and I can know I I can't help it
[2:11:32] I can't help it I'm perfect so perfecto
[2:11:37] believe me I've tried to do something
[2:11:39] else
[2:11:46] he's not allowing it

[2:11:52] you have to tonight
[2:11:56] that has to become
[2:12:00] a revelation to you
[2:12:05] and if that becomes a revelation yes

[2:12:13] okay
