Jesus Christ it's so good to be here and just to fellowship with each and every one of you I would like to go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to Second Corinthians 6 14. whenever you have it just go ahead and say Amen second Corinthians 6 14. and it says be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with Darkness let's go to 15 it says and what Concord has Christ with Belial or what part has he that believes with an infidelberg okay heavenly father father Celestial Lord we have just read your holy word father father Lord it is blessed father we are the ones that need your blessings this evening Lord yes I asked Lord that your Holy Spirit come down father and speak to us whatever we need Lord Lord take our own thoughts out of the way father and open each and every heart this evening forgive us of our sins Lord and allow us to be expecting your word father God lord we give it all to you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen man amen you may be seated so my title this evening is unequally yoked and if I had a subtitle it would be just called friends I I really have a strong conviction about these Services here on Fridays and I'm sure all of the our brothers do all of us do that it should be guided and directed to the youth is because they are um the future they're the the Christians of tomorrow once once all of the Old Timers and the Old Faithful people pass away who's here to pick up the word it's going to be the young people they're going to need their own experience and I believe that the young people God has put something uh or or has prepared something for you greater than in any age [Music] because you guys are living in the hardest stage this day is even harder than it was 10 years ago when you guys go to school when you guys go to work wherever you guys are at school the influences of the world are stronger than it they've ever happened but the word never changes the word never fails and no matter how great say in uh fortifies his army no matter how great the sin is in the world the word stays the same and you have to remember that God loves each and every one of you and he has your best interests he wants the best for each and every young person this evening so I just want to speak about unequally yoked now I don't know if anybody knows but the Yoke what he's talking about but he's making an example of oxen plowing a field Elizabeth what they would do is they would have two pairs of oxen yeah and what they would do is they would put this thing that would connect both of them together and it would allow them to plow the field together and the reason they needed two is so that they can have more power so that they can guide one another is and that little piece was called the Yoke yes in Deuteronomy 22 10 it says it says you shall not plow with an ox and a donkey yoke together they said no Aras that sounds that sounds pretty funny he said you know what if you want a plowfield don't get a dunking an ox to plow it is you have a donkey that has shorter legs it's more temperamental is and it eats differently than the ox the the the donkey he what he does is he eats um really coarse weeds that are poisonous to the ox is so that yoke was unequal it didn't work for the ox and the uh the donkey and also they realized that the donkey was an unclean animal in the laws of of uh of Israel [Music] so the the donkey was unclean and the ox was a clean animals and he said he did not want them to be yoked together uh one now Paul is using that same reference and says do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers if you have a desire to serve the Lord this evening if that is your sole purpose to serve the Lord how can you be equally yoked with somebody that wants to serve the world they don't have the same goal as you know they don't have the same desires as you classes so as the young man and the young ladies they begin to find people that they they like the best thing to do is see what your goals are foreign maybe I want to be a doctor maybe I want to do this and I want to have my own house maybe I want to serve the Lord with all of my heart maybe for the young man I want to be a a preacher I want to be a deacon I want to help out in church I want to be a godly man that that serves the Lord with all of his heart will that young lady have the same goals as you classes will that young man have the same goals as you young ladies because because whenever you pick not only friends but whatever you pick a partner is now I'm gonna get back on my message but I do want to say this that brother Brandon says that outside of Salvation a Godly woman is the greatest thing that can ever happen to a man outside of Salvation that is pretty amazing that that the greatest thing in the whole entire world is to pick a Godly woman now that's always in the perspective of brother Branham because he's a man but look at in your your the young lady's perspective if you're a young lady that is serving the Lord with all of your hearts you are the great so so whenever a young man and a young lady they pick or they choose um whoever is going to be their partner is going to be their husband or their wife that is an eternal decision see we make decisions in our whole life Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts do I want to go to this mall or do I want to go to that one do I want this job or do I want this career do I want to do this do I want to do that but there is an eternal decision and the first and most great or the greatest decision is is do I want to serve the Lord with all of my heart that is an eternal decision and when you make that decision it doesn't matter what condition you're in the classes it doesn't matter where you find yourself it doesn't matter where you're at mentally or spiritually make that decision once and that decision becomes an eternal decision that changes the course of your life maybe you'll go through your ups and downs but it'll change your Eternal course and your Eternal goal eterno is and your second greatest decision is picking the person who you're going to spend the rest of your life with Jesus because if you're a Christian a Christian is attracted to eternal life a Christian's not going to be attracted to the things of the world a young man or a young lady is not going to be attracted to the Fashions or how the world raises the young people now but if you've made your decision to serve the Lord with all of your heart then eternity is going to be attracted to Eternity and what you're looking for inside of a person with Christians that serve the Lord and they find somebody that is serving the lord and is filled with the Holy ghosts you have been bound eternally and you'll be bound even up be uh outside of death amen well that's the same thing with picking friends brother Brandon would always say this the quote of show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are [Music] we have to watch out what kind of friends we hang around because because no matter how good a person is there's things that are trying to pull you to the things of the world if you'd like to turn with me to Revelations 2 18. and if my time is up I would uh love if one of the brothers would just let me know this is [Music] Revelations 2 18 now who loves the Lord who wants to serve him every single day who wants to get better and closer to the Lord amen I do too I don't want to be worse than I was yesterday I want to be better and better and better so Revelations 2 18. now this is the Bible says and unto the angel of the church the criteria right these things say the Son of God whose eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass yes wow his eyes are like a flame of fire so right when he says the Son of God with eyes of a flame of fire then he says I know your works oh man that will run chills behind your back if God ever told you that is a fire and he knows your works but look at what he tells them I know your works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and and thy works and the last to be better than the first is man I would love for the Lord to tell me that I know I know what you've been doing I know your works I know you're trying I know your faith I see your love I see your service and I know that your works are better than they were when you first started so this is a people that are progressing with the Lord this is the people that the Lord the lord loves he's telling them him that that they they are progressing to be more abundant than they were yesterday now now we know that he's talking to Christians here these people love the Lord see he's not talking to them like he talked to the lady of sins remember when he talked to the lady of CN age they were neither hot nor cold they were lukewarm and he would spew them out of his mouth they were full of sin and they didn't even know it these people he said no you guys have full of love you guys have full of faith and service face then you know the service but listen what he says I love how how beautiful his words are to his people even before he's about to utter words of blame words of judgment warning first he wants to let them know don't worry I see what you guys are doing I see your love I see your patience now Revelations 2 20 it says notwithstanding I have a few things against you because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel that calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols not that you did something horrendous not that not that uh we're doing where we backslid from God you know we we uh fall short every single day but if you have your goal in the Lord the Lord Jesus Christ will protect you and his blood will be there with you he said no I see your Works they're good but the one thing I have against you he said that you sufferest you tolerate you tolerate tolerate means to allow to be or to be done without prohibition hindrance or contradiction [Music] to put up with not that you're indulging in sin complaces not that you're out there with in the world with your friends he says I have this against you that you tolerate you put up with this person Jezebel uh this this of course he wasn't talking of the literal person of Jezebel but there was the spirit of Jezebel in the church but we all know who Jezebel was and we know who she was married with a man that was supposed to be a child of God a man that was supposed to be serving the lord but every time brother Brandon would describe him he was wishy washy backslider borderline hypocrite worldly mundano yet he said he was a Christian this is not what what uh in Revelations they're talking they're not talking to Ahab because Ahab completely indulged himself in her Idols he was part of the world yet he would come to the church and say amen he would do whatever he wanted to do but then yet he had the the cloak of righteousness or the cloak of the word no these people God is talking about all right it's Christians serving the lord serving the lord but they put up with Jezebel senior Psalms 1 1 it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of scorn of the scornful is God hates sin and if you're not in the seat of the scornful walk with the Council of the ungodly blessed are you you are blessed because you separate yourself from those people well brother I don't do those things they do you said he said I'm not like them praise God of course you're not mono glorious of course you're not claro quinoa but just like you know in um whenever every time I'd get in trouble when somebody would do something and I was there um they said Eli you're guilty by association you're guilty because you were there well I don't do that I don't do what they do you know but I have one thing against you the Lord said because you put up with sin because you tolerated you let it in your bedroom to let it enter into your phones you let it enter into your household well I'm not part of that you tolerate it you suffer with it and that's the one thing God had against him you know I had a dream once when I first gave my heart to the Lord I I gave my heart to the Lord and I moved back to where I used to live where all my friends used to be Amigos all my buddies that I used to drink with all the people I knew they were they were there in my backyard basically I'm saying they were there just a block away of my neighbors they were all around and I felt myself being in a dilemma because my buddies would come back and and they would want to talk to me and they would want to hang out with me so I had a dream and the dream was I was in this room and in this room or in this house they was full of drugs and alcohol and people and women and just all kinds of things of sin is that was my version of sin is so it was presenting all of that partying and drinking and all of it and I didn't do any of it I'm not going to do any of this then one of my friends called from the other side of the room that Eli we're going to need some more beer okay let me go grab some more okay I went grabbed some more and I gave it to them and I said praise God I'm not sinning or I'm not doing anything then a voice came down and said Eli you're guilty you're guilty because you're accepting the sin around you is many times in my life that I had to realize that I could not go into the devil's territory it didn't matter if I didn't cuss if I didn't drink if I didn't even want it a Christian should never be in that the devil's territory Diablo because the devil does not like you know Diablo because the devil is your enemy and and just think of somebody that is going there with all their friends that smoke drink or whatever they do all right and here here you come with your Bible in your phone here you come just love in the Lord Devil's not going to like that you have to be killed amen amen we have to be careful what we do yeah what kind of friends we surround ourselves with now there's a story who who knows the king Jehoshaphat if you want to raise your hands whoever knows the king Jehovah awesome he was an amazing king of Judah there was a time where where Israel they split into two kingdoms because one king wanted to be to to be the king of Israel and the other one wanted to be uh and finally the kingdom split into it and there was the northern kingdom was the Kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of the South was the kingdom of Judah and they begin to to have wars against each other they had their own Kings they had their own prophets they had everything and they they grew strong into strong countries they didn't want anything to do with one another but then Here Comes This King named Jehoshaphat he was a good King he loved the Lord the Bible says if you'd like to turn in II Chronicles 17 uh it says now now the king of Jehoshaphat that um he strengthened himself from the Kingdom of Israel what verse um second chronicles 17 1. uh so that's the first thing he did he secured the borders he made sure everything they were going to be safe he was a good King but as we continue with the story of Jehoshaphat we're going to notice a very plain facts that he hated the fact that the two kingdoms were divided he hated the fact that God's nation was divided he hated it so much that he was willing to compromise everything that he built in order to build back that Unity he had good intentions to mend back whatever was lost but it was God's will for them to be separated see not all Unity is okay well I'm gonna go over there so I can talk to them about the Lord Jesus Christ you have to be careful not all Unity not all Fellowship is the will of God is but that's what he wanted that you could see in the story that he desired for that Unity to be back in second chronicles uh two it says that he now this is what he did for Judah is he stationed troops and fortify the towns of Judah he assigned additional garrisons to the land of Judah and to the towns of Ephraim that his father ASA had captured because he followed the example of his father David's early years and did not worship the images of bills Amen to make that decision that you don't want to be part of the world anymore watch God begin to bless your life watch God begin to put everything in order for you so the Lord established jehoshaphat's control over the kingdom of Judah all the people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat so he became very wealthy and high esteemed and it says that he was deeply committed to the ways of the Lord he removed the Pagan shrines of asherah polls of from Judah what verse is that six it is and as you continue on you see that he brought back the word so he he didn't just throw the world out throw the idols out of his life or out of Judah foreign but the Bible says that he began to get people to go around the cities of Judah and teach the law the law the word foreign says about you you said once you are connected with Christ This is a love letter this is a book of promise to you now maybe it was scary maybe it was hard maybe it was difficult to read it but now when you're serving the lord this is a book of promise this will give you all your spiritual vitamins it said whenever he started to teach the people about the the word that the other countries around him begin to fears people begin to bring tributes to him like the Philistines and and the syrians Syria they they knew that God was with them he built castles and he had a great Army that was King Jehoshaphat that is you when you're serving the lord you're established with the Lord and he was blessed because his soul desire foreign to serve him with all of his heart amen amen but something in him he couldn't help it bugged him that the houses of Jacob were splits he he was looking for the opportunities to mend the two houses together who is the King of the North who is the king of Israel Israel it was Ahab for a cup just like I said he was wishy-washy she was a hypocrite he was the one that says Ah it's okay I believe the message too come on take it take a hit take another smoke of this yeah oh yeah I believe I believe the prophet but then they do the things of the world see when I was in the world over there where I lived there was not many message Believers it was just our little group so when I was out in the world I was out with Catholics and we're in atheists and whatever they they didn't care at all what I noticed here is there's many that are close to the message that you can go to the world and it's not very far it's not very far you don't have to go all the way with the Catholics that don't know anything about the message no they know the message you don't you don't have to go very far to go into the world here and Ahab he he would claim that he was still a follower of the Lord but he wasn't says this in painted face Jezebel all right this is Ahab was a borderline lukewarm believer just indemned it to uh in indentment to Society of Christianity would be today he was wishy-washy and not stable at all now that was the king so what was the condition of Israel now in that day when just at midnight of Israel's history so in that day with Ahab that was the darkest time of Israel it was the midnight Solomon and David those were the brightest those were the Golden Ages but what did Ahab do he introduced he introduced the nation to a woman that was a heathen that was an idol worshiper and that was the first time a king of Israel married an idol worshiper a heathens and she's the very representation of hatred of maliciousness that's what who she was she wanted to when something didn't go her way she would go and start slaying people uh the uh the Jews if they didn't bow down to her Gods if Ahab needed them she would just slay them that's who she was they have wherever she wanted to move so if we could say the Israel was a type of the world and everything bad in it is one of those friends you have to watch out for Amigos oh I believe the message oh I believe this this and that but you got to be careful yes second chronicles 18 1. it says Lisa now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance I love that Gloria oh he was blessed by God but then it says and join Affinity with Ahab there was nothing wrong with Jehoshaphat he wasn't an adulterer like David or Solomon he was in a murderer like David if I could say he was one of the greatest Kings of Judah but God had one thing against him that he tolerated that woman Jezebel and Ahab her husband that he wanted to be friends with him he wanted an alliance with them so the the Bible says that he joined Affinity with Ahab what's that how do you say it in Spanish uh kinship but in Disco he joined a kinship with them so that word Affinity means Chatham or chaitan and this is which is a Hebrew word and what that is is to give away in marriage matrimonial and normally it would be a daughter but in this case he gave away his son in marriage so it means to form a contract of Alliance by marriage so what he did was form a contract usually if you want to form a contract or if you you have a promise or a covenant to do with somebody which means whom God afflicts that seems like an unequal is exalted by Jehovah and whom God afflicts and now they come together and they built that Alliance and I'll tell you this that was the greatest mistake Jehoshaphat made foreign that's an old proverb but it's the truth is associate with people who believe God don't let your children if you run across the street to little old Oswald over here he's a little nice boy but be careful who little Oswald is find out what his daddy is what his mama is they might be a hater of the Gospel they might have everything projected into little Oswald and you let your little boy or your little girl associate like that you said first thing you know he will become up and be like little Oswald now you know that's right watch your Associates keep your company limpia amen keep your company clean Olympia well does it really hurt it does um I know I'm about to close but let me tell you a little story I I gave my heart to the Lord I made many mistakes in the beginning not knowing by ignorance I had a really good buddy of mine in in the world [Music] and I gave my heart to the Lord and and then I got a call that his father died so in my heart I was like I have to go over there and pay my respects and I finally made that decision because I was kind of battling Within Myself I got to go over there and pay my respects to them then I had a brother my oldest brother he wasn't serving the lord and out of everybody he had to be the one correcting me is you can't go over there anymore you can't be around those kind of people well I still went I want to see you free and I and I went over there and I found out where he they lived and sure enough there was a group of people is they had the music up loud and it was in the middle of the day outside and I go over there straight to to that guy a boy and I start paying my respects then he starts accusing me of when I start if I stole his phone years ago they were all intoxicated I I didn't I didn't have a shaved head no more my my hair was slicked to the side I look different they said what are you a cop now I had my shirt tucked in then I just love the Lord I changed I don't know what happened I didn't nobody made me change I just didn't want to be like that anymore except the Lord wants nobody has to tell you anything it'll just fall off of you said and they said something's wrong with you Eli are you a cop are you this are you that is I had a knife right there on the side and one of them pulled it out on me and he was over there threatening me with the knife and I'm thinking to myself what did I get myself what kind of mess did I put myself in over here with sincere heart wanting to pay my respects but I wasn't the same anymore I wasn't them anymore I wasn't a wolf Lobo I was a I was a lamb I was a sheep and all the Wolves they were just getting blood hungry oh look at Eli he thinks he's better I don't remember I don't know how but I finally got my knife back and then the guy that pulled out the knife he started to punch me and almost the old Eli came out but by God's grace I didn't do anything and if it was the old Eli I would have been ashamed to not do anything because in the world oh you gotta hold your prize even if you go down fighting you gotta hold your pride you gotta hold yourself he punched me a couple of times and I I told them I said you know what you need to take care of him [Music] and then I walked away I didn't go in I didn't go in my car full of Shame and thinking oh I should have I should have gave him a good clean one I was ashamed to the Lord I said I should have never been there Lord and now I realize that I cannot associate myself with them anymore I can't go to the devil's territory anymore because no matter how nice they might be brother Brandon says they always gotta ask to grinding they have an ulterior motive there's something behind and one day Ahab called to Jehoshaphat he said come with me to Ramos Gilliam and fight with me God gave us this land oh he began to preach him a nice message he began to tell him how how they belong there and how they're both message Believers he said your people are my people I'm like you and you're like me and Jehoshaphat was in a bad condition he loved the Lord he was just with the wrong people he was with the wrong Associates but him being a person led by the Lord foreign let me bring them out to you so Ahab brought all 400 prophets and every single one of them in unity said go out and you will drive them out go out and you guys will be successful but brother Brandon would always say about the story foreign [Music] it's going to bite you one of these days you know living on the edge is a scary thing but one of these days one of these days it'll bite sin is no joke and so so they they were all saying everything was fine and said well uh do you have one more do you have one more that can tell us something oh yeah I have one more yeah but I hate him I hate him because he's always prophecy prophesying wrong and evil of me so don't let the king say so just just go and get him so they go and get this Prophet Mike um and they knock on his door and say Makaya they need you the king Ahab he needs you necessita you you little old Holy Roller you the old-fashioned word come here a wishy-washy Christian doesn't like the true words they don't like the real world they could talk to you about the message and they know a lot and they'll know how it's they'll tell you how it's okay to cut your hair they'll tell you how it's okay to do this and to do that and to lie and to steal is they'll tell you in the Bible how to do this this and that that's the 400 prophets that's scary that's something we should never tamper with they'll say all these beautiful things but if you're led by the spirit of the Lord you you'll say well is there one more they finally got Makaya he said oh you little Holy Roller he said we need you to prophesy and then they began to say they're saying that they're gonna win and they're gonna drive them out and you say the same thing okay he said I can't say anything but the what the Lord tells me to say and they said okay well King jehoshaphat's with them brother Branham says that Makaya stopped he said not him no not her they love the Lord and brother Branham says he says Ah that's what the Lord was telling me about it is imagine having the prophet here the Bible says there was eyes like fire and he says I know your Works they've been good you've been faithful but one thing I have against you he said Ah that's what the Lord was telling me about and he shook his head and he said I can't believe he's with that old wishy-washy hypocritical hypocritical person is [Music] he goes up there and from the survey and he he lies just like all of them so here he comes and he says yeah go up there you'll be all right but Ahab said no that doesn't sound right he says say the truth he says go up there and Israel will be like sheep scattered without a Shepherd Israel is he couldn't deny the word the word already cursed the sin the word is against it the word is against those things how can God bless something he's already cursed how could we be okay walking around with those things when he's already cursed it was cursedo and God told him he was going to die in battle his head was going to be chopped up and his wife was going to be fed to the dogs they have said see look at he's always prophesying against me The Sinner the the backslider the wishy-washy doesn't like the word oh look at that old little old Holy Roller always preaching negative things he's always preaching against me he's always doing this and he's always doing that well we better check our life if we're getting uncomfortable with the word we better check something if we're not exactly happy with what's being said either the Makaya that is preaching is not preaching right or some things wrong with our life ended up going anywhere in closing Ahab told him he said you know what you keep your nice clean kingly robes on he said I'm going to dress like a regular soldier that shows that Ahab believed the word he was trying to to out outlive the world because he knew the word prophesied against him so he said let me hide let me do this but you Jehovah you you put on your kingly robe believe me every time that ungodly associates they have ulterior motives what was he doing to Jehoshaphat he was making Jehoshaphat look like the king he didn't care of Jehoshaphat passed away be careful who you're with because there's people that hate the gospel people that hate the word people that hate the message that grew up in this church that grew up in the message and they they try to say good things they try to be intelligent they try to give you good advice but how could anything good come out of something that hates the world we have to be careful who we take our advice who our friends are who we're we're sitting and eating around they were they went out to the war egos all of the the people and before they went to the world war they said you know what don't even worry about all the Warriors just focus on Ahab we need to kill himself who's the one that looked like the king it was Ahab I mean it was Jehoshaphat and they went and they almost killed him and he cried out to the Lord and the Lord saved him and by chance somebody drew their arrow and shot Ahab and killed him because God you know once he curses something then you cannot change the word if the musicians would come up there was a a man named jehu he he condemned and he uh told Jehoshaphat he said why do you why are you around the people that hate me so much nevertheless the Lord has blessed you know how many more times he did that with ahab's son um when they called Elijah when they called the prophet and Elisha said I don't even want to talk to the king of Israel is he said I don't wouldn't even look at him I wouldn't even speak his way but just because the righteous man Jehoshaphat is here that's why I'm here Jehoshaphat he he just kept having worldly friends he ended up passing away there was there was another time that he he uh did trading deals with another on world a worldly person a result and finally he passed away but remember his biggest mistake foreign [Music] and she gets the throne from her son as a as a higher yeah she becomes the queen she she doesn't have somebody else to be the king she becomes the king because the queen and what she does is she begins to kill all of as a higher's children that's her grandchildren Jesus but they were the heir to the throne of Judah foreign just because Ahab wanted to align himself with a person's whole family to be wiped out just because he wanted to be Allied to Ahab Namaz see it's got Ripple effects the things we do even after they were gone she wiped out the whole seed of Judah and this person and there was one little boy that that was able to escape from her wrath and he was part of that seed of Judah yeah if it wasn't for God's will foreign the devil was working the whole way trying to wipe away the seed of God and no matter how good your friendships look no matter how good the sin looks watch out because there's a ulterior motive but remember the saying can't wipe you out you are the Royal seed of God he's trying to wipe you out because he knows Jesus lives in your heart he knows Jesus was born in you one day and no matter how much the devil tries God is with you the Bible says abstain from the very appearance of sin there was one time there was a man that needed to cross the canyon Davis so there was three writers the first writer said you know what I could take you El Primerica I can I can write 10 inches close to the edge riding 45 miles per hour the other one laughed he said Ah that's funny he said you know what you know how good of a writer I am yeah he said I could I could take you and I can ride four inches close to the air yeah and he said okay and he saw a little old man there sitting there he said what about you sir he said well maybe I could do that maybe I can write you right on the edge like that he said but what I do foreign [Music] see Christianity is not how close you can get to sin Christian get so close to sin without sinning try to get as far as away from it as you can get away from oh everything that is has the appearance of evil oh it'll save you so much grief it'll save you so much when we are unequally yoked with unbelievers the Bible says it's like holding fire to our bosom this is a hard thing it's a hard life to live because it's not only going to affect you now but it has a ripple effect and it'll it'll affect you from the from now all the way down especially if you choose somebody an unbeliever to be with to to marry is it's already an adventure if you're married with a Christian you still got your ups and downs you still got your good days and your bad days I would be lying to you if there's no arguments if there's no disagreements
