[33:32] i ask you to help me personally
[33:37] we ask you for all these favors in the
[33:39] name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
[33:48] as we're standing i'd like to go to the
[33:50] book of exodus chapter 40.
[33:54] and verse 7.
[34:02] [Music]
[34:04] the bible
[34:12] and thou shalt set the lava between the
[34:14] tent of the congregation and the altar
[34:16] and shall put water therein
[34:26] and thou shalt anoint the laver and his
[34:28] foot and sanctify it
[34:32] puerto
[34:37] and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons
[34:39] unto the door of the tabernacle of the
[34:40] congregation and and wash them with
[34:42] water
[34:44] around
[34:52] and thou shalt put upon aaron the holy
[34:54] garments and anoint him and sanctify him
[34:57] that he may minister unto me in the
[34:59] priest's office the special
[35:04] and thou shalt bring his sons and clothe
[35:07] them with coats
[35:09] come on
[35:17] and thou shalt anoint them as thou didst
[35:20] their fathers and they may minister unto
[35:21] me in the priest's office for the
[35:23] anointing shall surely be everlasting
[35:25] priesthood throughout their generations
[35:42] of the tabernacle
[35:57] talk calls it the laver
[35:59] the fuentes
[36:01] the laver is a furniture uh
[36:04] ponian agua where they would place water
[36:11] and uh a priest would do a job for the
[36:13] first time
[36:15] within that tabernacle
[36:20] they first needed to be washed by water
[36:22] fuente that was in the fountain despos
[36:36] you can notice that that represents the
[36:37] process of the new birth
[37:20] the bible says
[37:41] that's because aaron was called to be
[37:43] the high priest
[37:45] and the children
[37:47] they're strictly priests
[38:02] now notice it was for everyone that was
[38:04] a priest in the old testament
[38:11] everyone that's in the new testament
[38:12] that becomes a christian born-again
[38:30] it's the same
[38:44] had to go through that process
[38:51] have to go through that process but
[38:53] spiritually
[38:55] you have to be washed
[38:58] to be covered by
[39:15] [Music]
[39:26] and we give to god the sacrifice of our
[39:28] lips
[39:31] giving praise to his name
[39:34] say i don't feel like it
[39:36] do it
[39:39] that's a sacrifice
[39:54] is
[39:56] you're to make spiritual sacrifices
[40:01] the fruits of our lips giving praise to
[40:03] his name
[40:06] priests and kings unto god
[40:22] and
[40:50] [Music]
[41:02] and we've gone through the same process
[41:32] he was anointed the anointed high priest
[41:36] david said
[41:42] how sweet it is for our brethren to
[41:43] dwell together in unity
[41:46] [Music]
[41:49] it's like unto the precious anointing
[41:51] oil that they poured on aaron's head
[41:56] that ran all the way down to the hems of
[41:58] his skirts
[42:09] aaron was the high priest a type of
[42:11] christ if
[42:17] and notice that anointing oil had in the
[42:19] perfume of the had in it the perfume of
[42:22] the rose of sharon elirio de los valles
[42:24] and the lily of the valley la rosa
[42:27] the rose of sharon is
[42:33] [Music]
[42:43] is a plastada perfume can never be
[42:46] brought from this flower until that
[42:47] flower is crushed
[42:54] and squeezed out of it the perfume to be
[42:56] a sweet smelling savor unto the lord
[43:00] the rose of sharon
[43:03] was beautiful
[43:06] there was something inside
[43:10] it needed
[43:50] aaron also had a garment that was out of
[43:52] the ordinary
[43:57] aaron had something that was called the
[43:59] urim thummin
[44:02] have you ever heard about when brother
[44:03] brandon speaks about that
[44:34] and if those
[45:05] and there was 12 stones jasper sardius
[45:08] carbuncle and so forth on down
[45:10] tenia
[45:15] they got 12 of the big stones that was
[45:17] in the breastplate
[45:23] showing that he was the high priest of
[45:24] every tribe
[45:27] the 12 tribes of israel
[46:03] and after this i beheld and lo a great
[46:05] multitude which no man could number the
[46:08] toddlers
[46:11] of all nations and kindreds and people
[46:13] and tongues
[46:17] that stood before the throne and before
[46:19] the lamb
[46:22] clothed with right robes
[46:25] and palms in their hands
[46:42] but then it mentions yet another group
[46:45] which is the gentiles
[46:48] which are us christo christ
[46:52] is not only the high priest
[46:54] of the
[47:14] [Music]
[47:24] now remember aaron had the entire
[47:25] breastplate eso represented
[47:28] that represented the entire world
[47:31] but aaron's sons
[47:33] they just had coats
[47:35] eso represented
[47:52] william branham brother branham says in
[47:54] the in the message new ministry william
[47:56] branham
[48:00] christian that's the way a christian is
[48:04] we're nothing compared to him
[48:05] [Music]
[48:08] but we have a portion of his spirit in
[48:10] us
[48:12] and then it acts like him
[48:16] that's what makes us love the people
[48:44] and we have a portion of his spirit
[48:51] like i spoke i want to talk about that
[48:52] furniture called uh the the laverne
[49:00] if you go back to exodus 40.
[49:04] you can read there that it was moses
[49:09] who had an encounter with the pillar
[49:14] and then after having the encounter with
[49:15] the pillar of fire
[49:19] when he made the tabernacle
[49:21] and he started the priesthood
[49:24] it was the prophet
[49:28] who cleansed
[49:31] who watched aaron and his sons i i exist
[49:34] in people and natural there's a type
[49:36] here in the natural but
[49:39] to show how it's going to take place in
[49:41] the spiritual
[49:56] even the furniture that was inside
[49:58] inside its walls todo habla de cristo
[50:01] everything spoke of christ
[50:06] all the furniture in the building typed
[50:07] christ
[50:08] fuente such as the laver indonesia
[50:23] now pay attention to what brother
[50:24] branham says incluso bronte and the
[50:27] brass
[50:28] havela de juicio cuisio divino even at
[50:31] the altar speaks of judgment divine
[50:34] judgment
[50:38] this furniture wasn't just there in the
[50:39] tabernacle
[50:40] just to be there
[50:42] it had a meaning
[50:46] and it was a ladder made of brass you
[50:47] said
[50:49] if you hear the message
[50:52] brother branham
[51:33] for the nature of the serpent
[51:37] which christ took upon himself in la
[51:38] crosse el calvaro at the cross at
[51:40] calvary
[51:42] now this furniture
[51:44] fuente this lava era
[51:48] was made of brass bronze represents
[51:50] brass represents judgment
[51:56] brother branham also says that in the
[51:58] outer courts
[52:02] there was what was called the brass
[52:03] altar
[52:06] and then within those same courts
[52:09] there was that fount that laverne
[52:13] fuentes and both the altar and the
[52:15] lavrov
[52:16] they were
[52:22] now if we go to first peter 4 17.
[52:26] peter says
[52:33] for the time has come the judgment must
[52:35] begin at the house of god
[52:38] literally
[52:40] because that's how it was literally in
[52:41] the tabernacle
[52:46] the first thing that you could see as
[52:47] you enter the tabernacle
[52:50] was the brass altar fuente de bronze and
[52:52] then the lava of brass forest
[52:56] that's why it says that in first peter
[52:57] four que el juice
[53:10] and the first pieces of furniture you'd
[53:11] see as you enter the table
[53:26] the judgment
[54:12] now i want to read this quote a life
[54:15] hidden in christ
[54:20] brother says the outer courts
[54:21] represented justification
[54:25] what was there bautism
[54:27] baptism in water fuente
[54:36] the fountain was placed out there before
[54:38] they were ministering
[54:41] that water represents baptism in water
[54:47] just like when a person is baptized here
[54:48] in the church
[54:50] or in any
[55:04] so they have to go to the altar in the
[55:05] tabernacle
[55:08] after accepting the sacrifice
[55:10] they've got to go to the to the
[55:12] labyrinth
[55:14] then they've got to be baptized
[55:32] who washed the high priest
[55:36] and also washed his sons
[55:39] and clothed them and anointed them
[55:43] now we're going to take all of that from
[55:44] the naturals
[55:46] we're going to apply it now to the
[55:48] spiritual a jesus to jesus
[55:51] and his sons
[55:53] in matthew 3.
[55:56] and verse 13.
[55:59] the bible says entonces jesus
[56:05] then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan
[56:07] unto john to be baptized of him
[56:11] now remember the old testament
[56:14] it was the prophet
[56:28] sacrifice
[56:42] it was moses
[57:02] forbade him saying i have need to be
[57:04] baptized of thee and commits that one to
[57:06] me
[57:14] and jesus answered and said unto him
[57:16] suffer to be now for thus it becometh us
[57:18] to fulfill all righteousness then he
[57:21] suffered him
[57:33] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[57:35] straightway out of the water and lo
[57:37] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[57:39] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[57:41] and lighting upon him
[57:48] and lower voice from heaven saying this
[57:50] is my beloved son in whom i am well
[57:52] pleased
[58:05] and that was all done through the
[58:06] prophet moses now in grace
[58:10] it's elijah
[58:12] jesus who baptizes jesus jesus
[58:16] and jesus is the entire world
[58:20] foreign
[58:32] and it says it right here in the bible
[58:33] in acts 10 38. he says
[58:52] who went about doing good and healing
[58:54] all that were oppressed of the devil for
[58:56] god was with him
[59:00] christ did the same thing that
[59:02] uh
[59:16] it was made of brass
[59:18] and there was water within it
[59:22] now what is our water today
[59:25] we also want to be washed
[59:27] it was aaron
[59:29] that was washed
[1:00:08] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:00:10] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:00:18] foreign that he might sanctify and
[1:00:20] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[1:00:23] the word agua natural water in the
[1:00:26] natural
[1:01:12] that he might present it to himself a
[1:01:14] glorious church not having spot or
[1:01:16] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:01:18] should be holy and without blemish
[1:01:21] brother branham even says
[1:01:37] and then sacrificed
[1:01:43] it says here to be without spot or
[1:01:45] without wrinkles
[1:01:49] if you study the message in the bible
[1:01:54] you can see that spot represents
[1:01:59] when moses had the encounter with the
[1:02:00] pillar of fire
[1:02:03] and the pillar of fire was speaking to
[1:02:04] him
[1:02:33] his hand onto his breasts
[1:02:34] would he bring it out yes
[1:02:37] the hand was now healed
[1:02:40] so it says right here in ephesians 5.
[1:02:45] that after being washed off the water by
[1:02:47] the word paraquee
[1:02:50] to have not spot or wrinkle mancha
[1:02:53] represents pecan spot represents sin our
[1:02:55] pecans
[1:02:58] sin is manifested in us
[1:03:00] different
[1:03:15] the nature of sin inside of us is taken
[1:03:17] away
[1:03:20] but there's another nature of this body
[1:03:25] and we've always got to subject this
[1:03:27] body in obedience
[1:03:30] to the word this is
[1:03:33] without spot or wrinkle
[1:03:37] spot speaks of the internal sin
[1:03:39] and wrinkle
[1:03:41] speaks about this flesh what is
[1:04:16] in other words it changes you and gives
[1:04:17] you the holy ghost in your soul
[1:04:20] and one day in the resurrection
[1:04:22] at the resurrection that is nine
[1:04:52] but it still hasn't washed this body
[1:04:56] and converting it into a new body
[1:04:58] without sin
[1:05:00] a body without spots
[1:05:02] or wrinkles
[1:05:06] it's talking about a new body
[1:05:09] in marcos ds now in mark 10.
[1:05:18] jesus
[1:05:28] but jesus said unto them you know not
[1:05:30] what she asked can you drink of the cup
[1:05:32] that i drink of and be baptized with the
[1:05:34] baptism that i am baptized with
[1:05:39] this is a question he asked his
[1:05:40] disciples
[1:05:43] now the answer of theirs is
[1:05:46] in verse 39
[1:05:49] they said unto him we can jesus
[1:05:52] jesus said unto them
[1:05:56] ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i
[1:05:58] drink of
[1:05:59] baptism
[1:06:03] and with the baptism that i am baptized
[1:06:04] with all shall ye be baptized
[1:06:08] now the vessel uh representa
[1:06:11] or the cup it represents the suffering
[1:06:15] now remember jesus in gethsemane
[1:06:20] when he didn't want it in his humanity
[1:06:26] in his humanity he didn't want to go to
[1:06:27] the cross at calvary to go through that
[1:06:29] type of pain perez
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:50] but you'll also have the same baptism
[1:06:52] that i was baptized
[1:06:55] and if you notice jesus
[1:06:58] jesus had two baptisms
[1:07:01] baptism in water
[1:07:03] by the prophets
[1:07:10] and also the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:07:14] record
[1:07:17] remember the prophet moses
[1:07:23] he baptized the high priest
[1:07:26] and his sons
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:08] when he was in the ohio river una
[1:08:10] bospino del cielo a voice came from
[1:08:12] heaven said
[1:08:15] just as john the baptist was sent
[1:08:18] me primer
[1:08:19] on my first coming tour
[1:08:21] you are simply not
[1:08:36] is
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:10:28] you also have the glorious part
[1:10:32] is the baptism that he has
[1:10:34] the baptism of elijah
[1:10:37] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:42] but it was
[1:10:54] why do i go through so much suffering in
[1:10:56] my life
[1:10:58] and sometimes it seems like god allows
[1:11:00] it
[1:11:04] our heart is like some wet rag
[1:11:08] that god has to uh uh
[1:11:20] god allows you to go through that
[1:11:21] process
[1:11:35] and put that rose in your heart
[1:11:52] so everyone can
[1:12:20] like a hole there in the earth
[1:12:24] and he said that there was a bad stench
[1:12:26] that came from that hole
[1:12:29] and a voice that spoke to him
[1:12:33] says that represents our sins
[1:12:38] that represents our sexual nature
[1:12:41] sin it stinks
[1:12:45] but but the holy spirit is something
[1:12:47] aromatic
[1:13:02] but then sometimes god allows your heart
[1:13:04] to be squeezed and smashed just like it
[1:13:06] was with jesus
[1:13:09] to extract all the oil you've got on the
[1:13:11] inside
[1:13:16] there's something god wants to use with
[1:13:18] that oil
[1:13:21] now christ
[1:13:23] brother branham says
[1:13:25] jesus
[1:13:27] then in gethsemane jesus died of a
[1:13:28] broken heart
[1:13:29] jesus tomorrow prophecy but when jesus
[1:13:32] took the prophecies
[1:13:34] of the jubilee year
[1:13:36] the bible says
[1:13:39] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:13:42] because you've anointed me
[1:14:13] because he has the ability to heal my
[1:14:14] heart
[1:14:17] instead of something in the world that
[1:14:18] breaks my heart
[1:14:24] brother brown says in the message life
[1:14:25] story yeah
[1:14:39] oh christian people one of these days
[1:14:44] i know beyond the reach of mortal kin
[1:14:46] algundia someday
[1:14:50] god only knows just where and when
[1:14:55] the wheels of mortal life will all stand
[1:14:57] still
[1:15:00] then i'm going to take a trip to zion's
[1:15:02] hill
[1:15:04] i'll see her there again
[1:15:07] and i'll see jesus
[1:15:20] where the gates of pearl swing wide open
[1:15:36] i
[1:15:46] i just think back across the streets of
[1:15:48] tears and heartaches and troubles
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:16:04] dear jesus to live for you
[1:16:07] to do the thing no important
[1:16:10] no matter what the cross is
[1:16:13] or how scornful it seems to be
[1:16:16] i love you dear jesus
[1:17:04] and he starts just draining and
[1:17:05] straining and squeeze it
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:09] to extract all the oil that's in you
[1:17:14] because god's going to use
[1:17:30] why because god was with him
[1:17:36] the prophet says you've broken my heart
[1:17:38] over and over
[1:17:40] but i love you for it
[1:18:02] and the threads that i'm walking on now
[1:18:04] which are brittle
[1:18:06] estamas
[1:18:07] and my life is more than half gone
[1:19:04] and he set the lava between the tent of
[1:19:05] the congregation and the altar and put
[1:19:07] water there to wash with all emo
[1:19:14] and moses and aaron and his sons wash
[1:19:16] their hands and their feet their acts
[1:19:27] when they went into the tent of the
[1:19:29] congregation and when they came near
[1:19:30] unto the altar they washed as the lord
[1:19:33] commanded moses
[1:19:46] but every time they went to minister in
[1:19:48] the tabernacle after that
[1:19:51] they had to wash their hands
[1:19:53] and their feet
[1:19:57] that also has an application for us
[1:20:01] first of all why your hands and feet
[1:20:05] because hands and feet
[1:20:06] extremities those are our extremities
[1:20:11] that's what first touches the external
[1:20:13] world
[1:20:15] when someone goes to e especially
[1:20:29] and their feet
[1:21:04] sometimes you get filthy with the things
[1:21:06] of the world
[1:21:10] and it doesn't mean you haven't been
[1:21:11] born again
[1:21:28] that's something different they have not
[1:21:30] been born again
[1:21:32] but you know when you make a mistake
[1:21:34] immediately
[1:21:36] and immediately your heart it just feels
[1:21:38] so bad
[1:21:39] you've got to repent
[1:21:55] now remember jesus was baptized by
[1:21:56] elijah
[1:21:57] completely
[1:21:59] completely in the water
[1:22:02] then was anointed
[1:22:05] but then after some time
[1:22:07] he was invited to a home
[1:22:11] and he had to go through that process
[1:22:14] to clean himself off a little ante
[1:22:17] completely
[1:22:19] before entering completely into the home
[1:22:22] in
[1:22:50] and that and then it would it would take
[1:22:52] all the stink from them in his feet
[1:22:56] and a dusting along the road
[1:22:59] and would take off all of that
[1:23:05] then he would slip him on a pair of
[1:23:06] these little slippers that would fit his
[1:23:08] feet just right entonces
[1:23:11] then they'd pull him on his feet
[1:23:14] then he'd go over a via outro
[1:23:16] there'd be another flunky
[1:23:50] i believe it was a hype or a priest
[1:23:52] whose name was simeon
[1:23:56] he invited him to his house for a feast
[1:24:27] you've already been born again
[1:24:36] as soon as you exit the church
[1:24:38] and then you go out in the street enter
[1:24:40] la tienda you enter into the store
[1:25:28] they get that perfume from a little
[1:25:29] apple that's from a rosebud
[1:25:33] that makes the perfumes
[1:25:38] useless and they would make this perfume
[1:25:41] and pour it upon their hands and they
[1:25:42] would wipe their hands
[1:25:46] in them days
[1:25:50] that direct ray of that palestinian sun
[1:25:52] was so hot
[1:25:55] it would burn their neck in their faces
[1:26:00] and they take that perfume and oil
[1:26:04] they wipe their face and over their ears
[1:26:29] and then they had some kind of like that
[1:26:31] perfume that would act in place of like
[1:26:33] menthol
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:01] i hope you're catching the similarity of
[1:27:02] that
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] and it was groomed and ready prepared
[1:27:29] we've got to first come and be watched
[1:27:30] by the water of the word correcto right
[1:27:37] perfumed by the anointing oil they went
[1:27:39] on aaron's beard
[1:27:43] that run all the way to the hems of his
[1:27:44] skirts
[1:27:46] brotherly love
[1:27:51] jesus
[1:27:52] so all that happened to jesus in the
[1:27:53] naturals
[1:27:55] it happens to you in the spiritual
[1:27:58] jesus just like jesus got a little dirty
[1:28:03] and he had to groom himself
[1:28:06] before entering the home
[1:28:10] that's the same thing you have to do us
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:29:06] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[1:29:08] strangers and pilgrims
[1:29:10] abstinent
[1:29:15] abstain from fleshly lust which war
[1:29:17] against the soul says
[1:29:20] do you remember the black dog the white
[1:29:21] dog in the black dog
[1:29:24] the white dog is inside
[1:29:26] the black dog is outside
[1:29:28] negro and the black dog
[1:29:32] it says these are he says that it is a
[1:29:35] fleshly desire
[1:29:49] you went through that process
[1:30:32] around the
[1:30:46] you get a little dirty
[1:31:15] of it bra and the foot of it of brass of
[1:31:18] the looking glasses of the woman
[1:31:20] assembling which assembled at the door
[1:31:22] of the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:31:26] looking glass i know that in english
[1:31:28] uses the word looking glass
[1:31:31] mirror that which means a mirror
[1:31:34] or a mirror
[1:31:36] all right
[1:31:39] now this lava
[1:31:55] when it was very well shined
[1:32:01] it shined and was used as a mirror
[1:32:05] and so now bronze was a mirror
[1:32:08] la palabra but the word is bronzing the
[1:32:11] word is brass
[1:32:13] that's judgment
[1:32:16] but it's also a mirror
[1:32:19] where you see where your error lies he
[1:32:21] said
[1:32:22] and you judge yourself
[1:32:39] of the looking glass which was of brass
[1:32:42] photos
[1:32:45] i put some pictures there on the
[1:32:47] presentation if you'd like to put it up
[1:32:50] that that brass
[1:32:53] that's brass but it also serves as a
[1:32:55] mirror
[1:32:56] fuente now the lava
[1:32:59] de bronze was made of brass
[1:33:02] but it also served as a mirror
[1:33:06] that's why the word of god is
[1:33:08] it's judgment
[1:33:11] but you can see yourself in the words
[1:33:14] and you apply judgment to yourself
[1:33:19] but also in the laver was water
[1:33:22] in santiago uno bentidos in james 1 222
[1:33:28] but be your doers of the word
[1:33:32] and not hears only engagements
[1:33:50] he is like unto a man but holding his
[1:33:52] natural face in a glass
[1:33:56] in other words if you hear the word
[1:33:58] and you don't obey the word
[1:34:02] basically you go to this furniture this
[1:34:04] this laver you send them asbestos
[1:34:06] and you just see a reflection there
[1:34:09] agua but you don't use the water
[1:34:11] that's there to wash yourself
[1:34:15] in other words you hear the message of
[1:34:16] the hours
[1:34:18] and you don't obey what it says
[1:34:24] this scripture is being fulfilled here
[1:34:27] you're just looking at yourself
[1:34:30] but you're not applying
[1:34:49] but let it be hidden and let it let it
[1:34:51] be the hidden man of the heart an
[1:34:53] incorruptible ornato de spiritual
[1:34:57] pacifico lo qual es de grande
[1:35:00] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:35:02] the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:35:05] which is in the sight of god a great
[1:35:07] price
[1:35:10] those personas now there's two people
[1:35:12] constable
[1:35:35] as in the water face and as in water
[1:35:38] face answereth to face
[1:35:53] clean water
[1:36:07] you can see a reflection there in the
[1:36:08] message
[1:36:12] it's just one single person
[1:36:15] but it shows
[1:36:18] because there's someone outside
[1:36:20] and there's someone down there inside
[1:37:04] is
[1:37:29] for you to be adequately cleansed
[1:38:41] a person looking at the water
[1:39:11] you could see yourself identified with
[1:39:13] different people in the bible
[1:39:16] it's happened to me four times
[1:39:19] the third time was me
[1:39:21] one day i took the bible
[1:39:23] i was just studying
[1:39:25] fuente i took the flavor
[1:39:28] but i took the water of the word
[1:39:31] i could see the nathaniel
[1:39:34] did the same thing
[1:39:38] he was discerned by the messianic signs
[1:39:42] his heart was discerned
[1:39:46] with that sign
[1:39:49] he believed it like this
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:06] when the
[1:40:19] find yourself
[1:40:20] reflected
[1:40:22] there's something inside
[1:40:25] it's calling you
[1:40:28] it's a deep calling to a deep
[1:40:31] jesus just like jesus
[1:40:33] when he resurrected
[1:40:43] the bible says he was taking the entire
[1:40:44] prophet
[1:40:46] in the old testament
[1:40:48] that talked
[1:41:03] dude
[1:41:04] because christ is in the message
[1:41:07] in christ in you
[1:41:09] and is your theophany
[1:41:11] is
[1:41:12] it's calling you
[1:41:15] that's why when you hear the
[1:41:16] message there's something that starts to
[1:41:19] burn right here
[1:41:22] you're seeing your reflection in the
[1:41:23] lavender
[1:41:25] personas and you could see two people
[1:41:28] but truly it's just one person
[1:41:44] i want to end
[1:42:07] uh i want you to i want to look at me
[1:42:09] and i want you to look at yourself
[1:42:15] and as we look into god's great mirror
[1:42:16] of his word
[1:42:21] we'll be able to identify ourselves with
[1:42:22] some some with some that we're going to
[1:42:25] speak about
[1:42:33] and i want to see myself in god's
[1:42:35] looking glass
[1:42:39] the only way you could see yourself in
[1:42:40] the words
[1:42:43] is that first you have christ in you
[1:42:46] so that the christ that's in you
[1:42:50] can correspond to the christ in the
[1:42:51] words
[1:42:54] a deep calling to a deep us
[1:42:56] you see yourself in the water
[1:42:59] you're seeing the brass
[1:43:02] fuente and taking the water in the
[1:43:03] ladder
[1:43:05] and washing yourself
[1:43:08] all of that is in that single furniture
[1:43:10] mucho mas there's so much more
[1:43:14] but we don't have time
[1:43:19] heavenly father tonight
[1:43:22] is
[1:43:51] the oil of the rose of sharon
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:55] and after they go throughout this world
[1:44:01] which the bible says there is no city
[1:44:03] that will be permanent in this world but
[1:44:32] until
