[1:29] Messenger to that church Age We Believe
[1:32] solemnly with all of our heart to beat
[1:34] John Wesley yes
[1:49] Juan Wesley the church age began at 1750
[1:54] when the Lutheran Church age went out
[1:57] and lasted up to somewhere in 1900
[2:00] around 1906 18. the Wesleyan Church age
[2:06] and then issued in from that deladio
[2:14] is
[2:27] now the age is the age of church age of
[2:32] Brotherly Love
[2:34] the great missionary age
[2:37] and the open door age
[2:41] and the reward was a pillar
[2:44] made a pillar
[2:46] and the revelation of three names
[2:50] the name of God the name of city of God
[2:54] God's new name
[2:56] is a revelation that was given to this
[2:58] church this age is
[3:09] column
[3:13] is yours
[3:21] is
[3:24] and now
[3:25] the church this age begins in Revelation
[3:29] 3 7
[3:31] uh down to the 13th verse and 13 first
[3:36] inclusive Revelations
[3:39] 3
[3:41] 7-13 yeah
[3:56] now we've been uh reviewing these a
[3:59] little bit at night time going back and
[4:01] the church Age first was the Ephesian
[4:05] Church age can anybody
[4:07] say right off who the angel or the light
[4:10] was minister of that church hey Paul the
[4:13] Ephesus Church age 80 55 to 170. hold um
[4:33] de la Iglesia Pablo Iglesias
[4:42] the reason I picked up 55 that's when he
[4:45] started his missionary journey and it
[4:47] was then when he established the
[4:48] Ephesian church and the different
[4:50] churches along there
[4:52] is
[5:04] the second Church age was the samuria
[5:06] can anyone remember what the angel of
[5:09] that church age was in the class
[5:11] Pyrenees is right all right it was 170
[5:15] to 312.
[5:31] the Third Church age was the pergamist
[5:34] church age can anybody remember in the
[5:38] class who was the saint of that church
[5:40] age
[5:41] Saint Martin is right from 312 to 606.
[5:54] San Martin correct
[5:59] and then the next Church age was tatara
[6:02] uh can anybody remember the saint in the
[6:05] messenger angel that age
[6:07] Colombia is right and that's 606-15 is
[6:23] the next was Sardis Church age which was
[6:27] last night and anybody of course you
[6:30] know what the angel that church age was
[6:32] remember Martin Luther and then his was
[6:37] 15 20 on to 1750.
[6:57] and tonight we're on the Philadelphia
[7:00] Church age which is John Wesley the
[7:03] messenger of that day from 1750 to
[7:07] 1906 18. it's the age of Brotherly Love
[7:12] Yes Philadelphia
[7:17] dese
[7:25] yes
[7:28] now we find out that each one of these
[7:32] churches Church ages
[7:34] expressed the characteristic of that
[7:38] church uh it told what the church was
[7:42] and the characters of the church the
[7:45] characteristic rather of the church
[7:46] Iglesias
[7:50] is now
[8:03] last night was Martin Luther I in these
[8:06] I am the reason I'm getting this and the
[8:08] boys are putting it on tape
[8:10] I'm studying all day long and you say
[8:12] all day long on just what little history
[8:15] you give here
[8:20] is
[8:31] no the historical points that go in the
[8:34] book see this year I'm reason to get
[8:37] here is to get these things pulled out
[8:40] by the inspiration from the for you
[8:42] people where we gather together to get
[8:44] the inspirational part of it
[8:50] is
[9:01] the history I can read that out of the
[9:03] book but this is where I'm looking for
[9:05] the inspiration that we pick it up from
[9:07] the tapes
[9:16] then we got that that we got in the book
[9:19] then we'll have both the historical data
[9:23] of it and also the inspiration of the
[9:25] holy spirit is give us while we're
[9:26] together here this heavenly places in
[9:29] Christ Jesus and I believe it or to make
[9:32] a striking little commentary
[9:35] um on these Church ages and the Lord
[9:38] grant His blessings to it is
[10:06] being the Sardis Church age was really
[10:10] in the Greek was called the escape-on
[10:14] but I believe in the English translation
[10:17] uh is dead
[10:32] now it was both a dead church and an
[10:36] escape one because it was a church that
[10:39] had died under the purple rain in the
[10:43] 1500 there 1520 of the of the great
[10:48] Purple Rain which we call the Dark Ages
[10:51] where uh Christianity was at the lowest
[10:54] ever ever has been or ever will be
[10:59] even in the lady ocean Church age
[11:24] now this one of the Striking things I'll
[11:26] keep wearing on your mind that these
[11:29] Church ages start and whatever is in
[11:32] that one Church it goes all the way down
[11:35] through every Church age and each one of
[11:37] the church ages lap over one another if
[11:40] you study the history post with the book
[11:43] you'll find out
[11:48] is
[12:03] like laughs like this laying over each
[12:06] other and one Church age is going out
[12:08] and the angel that comes in between
[12:10] there is to call back that church to the
[12:13] faith that it once lost
[12:15] perdio
[12:33] he hit the Revelation there Jude said uh
[12:38] I wrote on to wrote unto you that you
[12:40] might earnestly contend for the faith
[12:43] that was once delivered to the Saints
[12:49] is
[12:59] laughing over between the apostles and
[13:02] the coming of the Revelation because
[13:03] most apostles were dead then thing was
[13:06] going on
[13:15] partido one living at that time that was
[13:18] Saint John the Divine which is the
[13:20] Revelator the writer it got the
[13:22] Revelation from the angel of the Lord to
[13:25] write the Book of Revelations
[13:30] now
[13:40] see the lap over one another so now you
[13:43] I guess you've noticed that and picked
[13:45] it up coming down as I've been
[13:46] mentioning how that even here in the the
[13:50] uh Sardis age that was the marriage age
[13:54] actually the church never really come
[13:57] into full existence until satara but it
[14:01] got married in Sardis and Sardis means
[14:04] um uh being a marriage what up Ben is
[14:24] now
[14:37] Mary Jordan had leftover into that age
[14:40] there and noticed Luther last night come
[14:42] out with a dead name a name of dead and
[14:46] then escape on the it had the dead
[14:49] Church from back here and the escaping
[14:52] all the little Remnant that was brought
[14:54] out in this age here
[14:58] is
[15:18] and tonight as we're ending up the
[15:21] Philadelphia agents bringing in the
[15:24] beginning of the lady ocean age yes
[15:34] then tomorrow night when it goes out of
[15:37] the just at the end in order the angel
[15:40] appears right at the end time and just
[15:43] at the end time to rebuke the church for
[15:45] losing its first love and how it's got
[15:48] away from God like they did down through
[15:49] there
[16:09] and at that time the Rapture comes to
[16:12] take the church home the church goes up
[16:15] man just at the time of the message
[16:17] and so we are we are nearing that age
[16:20] now did you get that all right
[16:37] all right see this but the time the the
[16:41] angel of the church the messenger of the
[16:44] age comes in to rebuke them for losing
[16:48] their first love frank Khan to bring him
[16:50] back we've been Ben we've been just
[17:05] same thing the messenger does tonight
[17:09] the angel messenger comes back to rebuke
[17:12] them each age like that for what they
[17:14] had done so that makes a lap over in
[17:16] each one of the church ages is lap right
[17:18] over one another like that like climbing
[17:21] up a step and playing in laps like that
[17:23] going up is
[17:43] biendo
[17:48] now
[17:50] I got just a sharp piece of History here
[17:53] on the messenger for tonight that the uh
[17:56] John Wesley
[17:58] John Wesley was the star of the age and

[21:32] Amen you just you're just fight in the
[21:35] air God's going to take him right on
[21:37] through anyhow yeah
[22:02] El manitas he was called a Methodist
[22:06] because of his methods of doing things

[22:16] think of that 40 000 sermons
[22:25] o
[22:35] is going away in 17 and 91
[22:40] the Methodist denomination took its
[22:42] roots in the world
[22:44] and started the Methodist Church
[22:47] then of course as Barry and many more
[22:49] were
[22:50] in at the time is
[23:07] now
[23:09] if we notice the salute to this church
[23:11] as we're going to start now on the 7th
[23:13] verse
[23:15] the messenger Philadelphia the true
[23:18] church and the true church in the
[23:21] professing church it was a true church
[23:24] in the professing Philadelphia
[23:42] do the angel of the Church of
[23:44] Philadelphia right
[23:47] I've called your attention to the
[23:50] laughing over each one now and you'll
[23:52] get here the angel if you watch the way
[23:55] he brought in the age of the Methodist
[23:58] age lapping on him run over into a
[24:01] little bit of the Philadelphian or to
[24:02] the lady of sin Pentecostal age is
[24:06] Pentecostal
[24:30] messenger comes back to rebuke these for
[24:33] fallen just as this age rebuked them
[24:37] from falling back here in Sardis and the
[24:39] Lutheran age The Leftovers
[24:57] it was a great age of missionaries and
[25:00] missions the world has never seen the
[25:02] time
[25:03] it even goes over into our time now that
[25:07] when the world ever seen such a time of
[25:11] missionaries everywhere in the last well
[25:15] I'd say the last 150 years it's been one
[25:18] of the most outstanding times of world
[25:20] history for missionaries getting into
[25:23] all parts of the world with the Gospel
[25:28] Mission is
[25:51] it has been as far as literally
[25:54] as literally just going sending a
[25:58] message of the Gospel on paper and
[26:00] tracks and books and so forth the gospel
[26:03] has long ago went to Every Nation Under
[26:06] the heavens
[26:24] long ago so you see that ghost to prove
[26:27] that that wasn't what Jesus is talking
[26:30] about he never said go into all the
[26:32] world and make Bible schools he didn't
[26:34] say go into all the world and uh pass
[26:37] out literature
[26:42] Jesus
[26:49] [Music]
[26:51] those things are fine but his commission
[26:54] to the church was going to all the
[26:56] warland preach the gospel and the gospel
[27:01] is not altogether the word but it's
[27:05] making the word come to life is
[27:25] [Music]
[27:28] 16 is last
[27:30] against last mission to the church was
[27:33] these signs shall follow them Ben
[27:37] foreign
[27:50] this first uh commission to the church
[27:54] and Matthew the 10th chapter was heal
[27:57] the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils
[27:59] as freely as you have received freely
[28:00] give us
[28:13] and his last message to the church was
[28:16] go into all the world and preach the
[28:18] gospel to Every Creature he that
[28:20] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[28:23] he that believeth not shall be damned
[28:25] and these signs shall follow them that
[28:29] believe is foreign
[28:49] this is strange that many cut off that
[28:51] part there
[28:52] and is a conjunction it ties your
[28:55] sentence together see now he said
[28:58] you have many uh ministers will say go
[29:01] preach the gospel he that believeth is
[29:03] baptized shall be saved and he that
[29:06] believeth not shall be damned and
[29:09] these signs shall follow them shall
[29:13] follow them them that believe
[29:20] here
[29:27] foreign
[29:42] they shall cast out devils
[29:47] they shall speak with new tongues
[29:49] if they take up serpents or drink a
[29:52] daily thing it'll not harm them if they
[29:54] lay their hands on the sick they shall
[29:56] recover in my name is
[30:12] signs of the Living God moving among the
[30:15] people all how far out to all the world
[30:20] you get it amen amen all over the world
[30:26] [Music]
[30:32] so therefore when I say that the pentic
[30:36] Hostile message
[30:39] not the Pentecostal organization now the
[30:42] Pentecostal message is the only true
[30:45] message from God organizations
[31:03] there right there Jesus commission
[31:05] Church go into all the world preach the
[31:07] gospel these signs speaking in tongues
[31:10] healing sick performing Miracles man
[31:12] well last so how far all the world
[31:17] how many to Every Creature amen
[31:20] amen it's all the way down to the end
[31:22] here amen to the consummation all right
[31:51] these signs shall follow just this
[31:54] church
[31:55] damn that believe in all the world amen
[31:59] amen amen all the world to ever
[32:02] creatures these signs shall follow them
[32:04] not this damn that Phillies amen so it's
[32:09] a Pentecostal Church
[32:32] in this age right here where we're at
[32:35] tonight on the Philadelphian
[32:39] p-h-i-l a Philadelphian Church age
[32:42] and that age there evangelized and has
[32:46] missionaries all the complete world with
[32:50] literature Philadelphia
[33:00] [Music]
[33:10] full
[33:11] is preached to all the world for our
[33:14] witness unto me than the end shall thee
[33:18] Jesus
[33:31] amen well then if that was what he's
[33:33] talked about spreading out literature
[33:36] sending out missionaries with Reading
[33:37] Writing arithmetic and passing out
[33:39] tracks and making people shake hands and
[33:42] believe that there is a God if that's
[33:44] all it was and he's far past is coming
[33:57] forward
[34:09] so it shows that the gospel Paul said
[34:12] the gospel
[34:14] gospel only but through Power amen and
[34:17] manifestations
[34:25] Santo
[34:31] everybody
[34:34] gospel he said go in the
[34:37] going oh I like that
[34:40] demonstrate the power
[34:43] of the Gospel Jesus
[34:59] taking the word that what it says and
[35:02] show the people what it says then make
[35:04] it manifest to them oh that's the way
[35:07] that proves it is
[35:23] standing
[35:26] standing there in missions biggest in
[35:27] the world when he said brother Brown you
[35:30] being a Baptist you all know what's
[35:32] truth I said the Bible's the truth
[35:52] I said the Holy Ghost see and so he said
[35:56] oh I see a hair up the French and kick
[35:58] over the stuff I said yep
[36:12] the only thing it is is you guys hold
[36:15] yourself back and isolate yourself away
[36:17] from them they got plenty of steam they
[36:20] make the wheel roll and do something but
[36:22] they blow it all out the whistle you see
[36:23] this is
[36:41] but they don't know what to do with this
[36:43] got to go somewhere so they just just
[36:46] scream it out
[37:06] not have any steam to go out
[37:08] [Music]
[37:11] that's all I used to say I'd rather be
[37:13] free for a little while I'd rather have
[37:15] a little Wildfire than have no fire at
[37:16] all
[37:19] planted absolutely
[37:36] the trouble of today we try to paint a
[37:38] fire
[37:39] say you know way back in the days of
[37:41] Pentecost it did this now what good does
[37:44] it do to show a freezing man is freezing
[37:46] the death of painted fire and then
[37:48] you're going to help him a bit the
[37:50] problem is
[38:11] and if there's a power God that made the
[38:14] Pentecostals uh work for the Lord and do
[38:16] the works and signs that they did no not
[38:19] yet
[38:28] if you're not just paint the picture but
[38:31] bring the picture in reality to them
[38:33] they'll get the same experience the same
[38:35] salvation seal their own testimony the
[38:38] way they did but you got to get it to
[38:40] them you got to place it back in some
[38:43] other generation but bring it up here
[39:08] now we find out that this age of
[39:11] Brotherly Love was a great missionary
[39:14] age Jesus said into all the world into
[39:17] every creature and these signs shall
[39:20] follow
[39:26] Jesus
[39:32] now as we've come down to the history
[39:34] and Through the Bible I want to ask you
[39:38] hasn't each night we read in the Bible
[39:40] hear what Jesus told John would happen
[39:43] and right here we talk history to proved
[39:45] that it did happen just exactly yeah
[40:06] amen
[40:07] that's the reason I had such a Time
[40:09] searching out these these men to see
[40:12] where that God's servant was and carried
[40:14] this message right onto but he was there
[40:16] he was there just as the Bible said kept
[40:19] the message just like from the beginning
[40:21] never fool with it
[40:26] is
[40:40] now we see it was almost stand out and
[40:43] he called that same age a dead age dark
[40:46] so forth and then come out just a little
[40:48] light and a little more strength and
[40:50] then went into the Pentecostal real
[40:52] experience again right to enzyme and
[40:54] then the bride called away and away it
[40:57] went the tribulation set back in again
[40:58] all right a Great Tribulation which is
[41:01] coming up before all the world is
[41:33] the great missionary aged brotherly love
[41:36] the age of missions
[41:38] let me explain to you some of the great
[41:40] men and then I guess wrote their names
[41:41] on here
