[28:41] uh
[28:46] i was telling our pastor well how
[28:48] difficult can this be esme testimonial
[28:51] it's my own testimony
[28:57] but by god's grace here we are brothers
[29:05] on one occasion a sunday morning where i
[29:07] went up to pray for the petitions
[29:14] i came back and they're in the back in
[29:16] the office there was brother eli and our
[29:18] pastor
[29:25] and i told our pastor brother i still
[29:27] get really nervous
[29:33] and he said just wait till i put you to
[29:34] preach
[29:37] and he had a smile on his face
[29:39] and he joked up and said yeah right and
[29:42] then i was thinking ah
[29:45] yeah
[29:46] domingo
[29:47] that was a sunday
[29:51] and then by tuesday our brother eli sent
[29:53] to send me a message on whatsapp
[29:58] he sent me the the calendar for the
[30:00] month of january
[30:03] and on that calendar was my name oh my
[30:06] gosh he wasn't kidding
[30:12] and then he wasn't playing about it
[30:15] uh
[30:16] he went with
[30:18] ebola i said well
[30:21] how to do it
[30:27] and also on that calendar yes
[30:30] there was our brother
[30:35] and he was scheduled to speak on a
[30:36] friday right before i was
[30:40] uh
[30:41] and that's when he got coveted
[30:48] and immediately i thought oh my they're
[30:50] going to push me up on the sooner date
[30:56] when i was thinking of that
[31:01] our pastor brother adonis he called me
[31:03] on the phone
[31:05] and i said oh just like i thought it
[31:07] would happen
[31:11] said brother uh i've got some news
[31:15] and i said oh my
[31:24] and he said i'm going to have to push
[31:25] you back because brother luis is going
[31:27] to preach a series
[31:29] it's going to be five messages
[31:45] things happen that way
[31:49] with her pregnancy
[31:57] and and i told the brother well then is
[31:58] this going to be my friday
[32:04] he says well i don't know it all depends
[32:05] on your daughter
[32:12] and my grandson was born my daughter's
[32:14] son
[32:15] hermano lester
[32:21] domingo and so brother louise had to
[32:23] skip that friday and sunday so leo
[32:38] and i still said would you like to just
[32:40] extend it yet another
[32:52] won't be preaching i'll be sharing the
[32:53] testimony
[33:08] and to start off i was born in
[33:09] massachusetts
[33:14] and from massachusetts we moved to the
[33:16] state of nayarit
[33:19] a small little ranch called penitas
[33:30] we were there till i was about 12 to 13
[33:32] years old i believe
[33:36] and then we moved now to the united
[33:37] states
[33:45] when you arrive to a country like this
[33:46] brothers
[33:54] to a country that's so beautiful when
[33:56] compared to mexico
[34:03] and i say very beautiful because i'm
[34:04] referring to the small ranch that i'm
[34:06] from benitez
[34:13] and every time we go visit my parents
[34:15] there in mexico i always tell my wife oh
[34:17] what a beautiful ranch yeah
[34:44] and when you get to this country when
[34:45] you're a young person it's so easy to
[34:47] grab a hold of the customs of this
[34:49] country when you're young
[34:58] and brothers when i got here my
[35:00] waistline was of size 28.
[35:06] and always uh well strapped
[35:11] and i started going to school
[35:13] miravalo de mars uh
[35:20] [Music]
[35:26] [Music]
[35:31] and they'd approach me and they tell me
[35:33] aren't you embarrassed to dress the way
[35:34] you dress
[35:39] up
[35:45] and i remember that very vividly because
[35:47] back then i had on some blue jeans and a
[35:49] t-shirt with the looney tunes
[35:56] uh
[36:10] and i say this because here in this
[36:11] country that the kids that are around 13
[36:13] or 14 they they already compose
[36:15] themselves like they're 20 years old
[36:20] they're very advanced
[36:24] and i didn't think nothing about that
[36:29] i kept going to school
[36:35] an uncle of mine that he has a son yes
[36:47] he probably had wore the same size
[36:49] clothing as me peros
[36:53] but if our waistline was about 28.29
[36:58] the clothing that i then started to use
[37:03] was about size 48 descentura a waistline
[37:06] uh
[37:10] it was some pants that basically i'd get
[37:12] lost in how big they were
[37:23] my dad would give me a heart you'll
[37:24] tease me you tease me
[37:28] you say
[37:31] those pants are so big they'll even fall
[37:32] off from me
[37:33] yes
[37:44] and that's how i started to grow up if
[37:45] we could say i grew up in a strange
[37:47] world
[38:16] and i started to do things that i'm not
[38:18] too proud of saying that i did
[38:22] but like i said not too long ago
[38:26] this is a country that wraps you up
[38:42] there's a saying that says he that
[38:44] wanders with wolves sooner or later is
[38:45] going to learn from them
[38:50] and that's what happened with me
[38:55] my wife told me
[38:58] you better not
[39:32] and i've been here in this country for
[39:33] about four or five months
[39:37] and she told me as we were there in the
[39:38] hallway
[39:52] and for me she's always been someone
[39:54] very beautiful with really beautiful
[39:56] eyes
[39:59] and right away she caught my attention
[40:02] i kept staring at her
[40:06] and her brother told me
[40:08] hey
[40:37] well if you want to i could hook you up
[40:39] i know her
[40:41] yo
[40:43] and then i kept saying no
[40:48] the days went on and i kept looking at
[40:50] her uh
[41:04] and she was at a neighbor's house who
[41:06] was a friend of hers from school
[41:09] and we passed by
[41:11] me
[41:14] and i told my uncle wait wait stop stop
[41:15] i know her
[41:16] yeah
[41:27] and we started to talk for a while and
[41:28] time just started passing by uh
[41:31] they said necessarily
[41:35] during that time her brother passed by
[41:37] and his name is manuel
[41:41] and he told her what are you doing here
[41:44] get in the house
[42:09] and i told her well you know he told me
[42:11] this and that but i didn't know what was
[42:12] going on
[42:23] and i started to visit her at her house
[42:25] i was friends with her brother
[42:42] i'd go and visit her brother
[42:44] pregnant
[42:46] asking for her brother
[42:50] but honestly who i wanted to go and see
[42:51] was her
[42:52] que
[42:54] uh
[43:00] and also my son-in-law started looking
[43:02] for my son to invite him to the movies
[43:04] but you know
[43:07] but it wasn't for my son
[43:10] yo
[43:23] uh
[43:38] and my mother-in-law i'm going to be
[43:40] honest i was scared of her
[43:43] yes
[43:45] she looked very bad
[43:50] it's an expression
[44:06] and i was outside in the yard at her
[44:08] house
[44:10] and talking with my wife
[44:15] and then she arrived with her husband
[44:20] and we'd be seated if we could say like
[44:22] like here yeah
[44:26] she'd open the door to enter into the
[44:27] the house through the yard
[44:30] and she'd enter in like this
[44:32] and just nearly
[44:49] she never told me anything but her
[44:50] expression said enough
[44:54] i don't blame her
[45:04] and my appearance just wasn't uh good
[45:07] enough for a daughter
[45:09] persona
[45:14] and any person that would want they
[45:15] would see the way i dressed in the
[45:16] clothing that i used
[45:24] would see me as a threat
[45:28] [Music]
[45:30] i understand
[45:40] and she had her structure because she
[45:42] was raised in the message
[45:56] and as a young person you know when you
[45:58] like somebody well one way or another
[45:59] you still try and find a way to get with
[46:01] the person
[46:07] we started to talk for some months now
[46:11] yeah uh
[46:26] yes and she bought herself a car
[46:29] brothers
[46:30] uh
[46:31] without even knowing how to drive
[46:36] in hopes that one day her brother would
[46:38] teach her how to drive
[46:40] and that never happened
[46:47] because the reason was he's the one that
[46:49] would take the car and be up and down
[46:50] the streets
[46:53] yes
[46:58] she said you know my brother's always
[46:59] got the car and he never teaches me how
[47:01] to drive
[47:04] can you teach me how to drive and i said
[47:06] sure so you can see your 10 senior sure
[47:08] i'll teach you
[47:12] and she told her mother you know i'm
[47:14] going to teach her how to drive
[47:17] and and her mother told her brother
[47:22] and her brother didn't really like that
[47:23] idea
[47:29] and told her no don't don't let him
[47:31] teach you how to drive
[47:33] because they're going to go out driving
[47:35] alone
[47:35] you know uh
[47:51] and like i said i have them i'm from
[47:53] mexico and i had a certain mentality
[47:54] where uh i wasn't going to go beyond a
[47:56] certain point
[48:00] and for him he would just say don't let
[48:02] them go by themselves
[48:03] yeah uh yeah
[48:17] and my brother told her not to let me go
[48:19] with you alone so i can't go with you
[48:22] that's okay
[48:32] and my mother-in-law at that point in
[48:33] time might see her like such a bad
[48:34] person
[48:37] and then after that i saw her even worse
[48:41] [Music]
[48:44] and and now at that point she'd walk by
[48:46] and she'd even lift her eyebrows and i'd
[48:48] just be like whoa
[48:56] and not too long after that my wife told
[48:58] me you know you know what my mom doesn't
[49:00] want you coming around here no more hey
[49:01] no
[49:03] she don't want you to come visit me
[49:07] and i said okay that's fine
[49:12] then i went out of her yard
[49:14] if we
[49:21] and in my mind i said well she doesn't
[49:22] want me in her house
[49:24] and this is a public place
[49:27] she can't kick me out of here
[49:43] that was around the

[56:18] phoenix sun
[56:21] charles barkley
[56:27] i answered charles barkley and i didn't

[57:04] there was another couple yeah
[57:09] and that that couple they were coyotes
[57:15] and in the taxi that we were in right in
[57:17] front of us there was a car full of
[57:18] people
[57:21] and the taxi driver was taking care of
[57:23] them by orders of the coyote
[57:38] as we got to a gas station with no money
[57:40] and they bought us food and drinks
[57:44] phoenix and then we arrived all the way
[57:45] to phoenix
[57:53] central and when my mother my
[57:54] mother-in-law found out we were here she
[57:55] didn't want to pick us up there at the
[57:56] station
[57:59] my brother-in-law said i'll go pick them
[58:01] up
[58:05] he went picked us up and took us to my
[58:07] father's apartment
[58:10] my father was very irritated and he
[58:12] scolded us
[58:15] and he told me they're going to put you
[58:16] in jail
[58:18] yeah
[58:22] because my mother-in-law already called
[58:23] me and she threatened me that if i don't
[58:24] i don't report you she's going to put me
[58:26] in jail
[58:30] i said don't worry i'm a miner and she's
[58:32] a miner so they can't touch us
[58:38] and well brothers that's how life went
[58:40] on and then my daughter anna arrived you
[58:42] owe me jose my son cesar
[58:46] you know
[58:49] influence influence
[58:50] and then i started to influence her
[58:53] foreign to not go to church
[58:58] brothers and sisters uh
[59:06] our young brother young sister if you're
[59:08] thinking about starting a friendship
[59:09] with someone make sure that they're a
[59:10] christian
[59:16] because i tried to make life miserable
[59:18] for my my wife in that aspect
[59:22] amigos
[59:28] i had friends that used drugs and they'd
[59:31] be out getting high
[59:35] classes
[59:40] i'm using cocaine and crystal and just
[59:42] all types of drugs whatever you think of
[59:44] you name it i was around it
[59:54] and by god's grace i never had that
[59:56] desire to use the drugs
[1:00:02] i believe i might have used marijuana
[1:00:04] and cocaine about three times each in my
[1:00:06] life
[1:00:09] and once again because you see
[1:00:12] and then you start to want it as well
[1:00:18] but i never became an addict to it
[1:00:26] we started like that i like to go
[1:00:28] dancing and i started taking her dancing
[1:00:33] i buy beer
[1:00:38] i wasn't really much of a drunk or an
[1:00:40] alcoholic i'd buy a six-pack and it
[1:00:41] lasts me a month
[1:00:46] i'd buy a pack of cigarettes and i never
[1:00:48] even smoked but my brother-in-law would
[1:00:49] smoke them
[1:00:52] and i would see him so then i'd imitate
[1:00:53] him uh
[1:01:01] one occasion we went to the doctor's
[1:01:02] office and my son says that he was
[1:01:04] little
[1:01:08] and the doctor told us he had the
[1:01:09] symptoms of asthma
[1:01:14] and now asking if anyone smoked around
[1:01:16] him and i i had a cigarette boxing uh on
[1:01:18] me and i'm saying no no no i don't
[1:01:22] question he said if anyone's smoking
[1:01:25] well he's going to catch asthma
[1:01:31] we got out of the doctor's office i
[1:01:32] grabbed a cigarette box i threw in the
[1:01:34] trash and never again bought one
[1:01:36] uh
[1:01:49] and i said i met the message through my
[1:01:51] wife
[1:01:53] and my mother-in-law
[1:02:00] i'd hear them but i never took them
[1:02:02] seriously i just hear them
[1:02:20] you're out doing bad things and you
[1:02:22] don't even remember that god exists
[1:02:31] you just remember about god when
[1:02:32] something bad is happening to you or in
[1:02:34] your life
[1:02:40] and for me it was difficult to leave
[1:02:41] behind the life that i knew
[1:02:44] because i didn't have the structure of a
[1:02:46] christian life
[1:02:52] when my wife started to go back to
[1:02:54] church again
[1:02:56] she take the children
[1:03:00] it used to bother me for her to go uh
[1:03:07] and she just come back from church and
[1:03:08] she wanted to talk about church and the
[1:03:10] brothers
[1:03:13] this is about the church and the church
[1:03:14] that and
[1:03:19] and she'd act in a way that i just
[1:03:20] didn't like
[1:03:23] she started to dress differently
[1:03:26] she no longer would wear pants
[1:03:28] uh
[1:03:51] and god knows that's what i told her
[1:03:54] and she'd tell me establish
[1:04:01] and she said well that's okay if that's
[1:04:02] what you want to do but i'm not going to
[1:04:03] stop going to church and taking the kids
[1:04:05] with me
[1:04:08] and i tried to make life difficult for
[1:04:09] her brothers
[1:04:12] but she never changed her way of
[1:04:13] thinking uh yes
[1:04:16] she stayed firm upon what she believed
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:26] and i didn't want that change that was
[1:04:27] happening in her because it was
[1:04:28] difficult for me to adjust to that
[1:04:30] change
[1:04:36] when she'd get home from services i just
[1:04:37] look at her
[1:04:41] and the devil would put evil thoughts in
[1:04:42] me
[1:04:46] one occasion they got back from a
[1:04:47] children's church
[1:04:50] and i see my son daniel
[1:04:58] and he'd show up singing these songs
[1:04:59] brothers
[1:05:00] yeah this little light on mine i'm gonna
[1:05:03] let it shine he'd be singing this little
[1:05:06] light of mine i'm gonna let it shine
[1:05:09] and and he'd even uh do these movements
[1:05:18] and it brought me pleasure to see how
[1:05:20] he'd come home so happy you know
[1:05:23] i wouldn't say anything to anybody
[1:05:28] but i started to see and i started to
[1:05:29] think
[1:05:31] that they like that
[1:05:36] then i started to go to church with them
[1:05:43] and i felt like i knew that i was going
[1:05:45] against my own will
[1:05:49] but they liked it so i kept going
[1:05:57] not because i wanted to but because they
[1:05:58] liked it
[1:06:11] and then i stopped going again
[1:06:14] um
[1:06:25] look there's a group of brothers that
[1:06:26] they gather in different homes every
[1:06:28] thursday
[1:06:30] one takes
[1:06:43] there's a brother that plays the
[1:06:44] accordion very nice she'd tell me
[1:06:53] and she knew how to talk to me because
[1:06:55] she knew that i enjoyed music
[1:06:59] so the accordion and music well i said
[1:07:01] okay
[1:07:09] and then those fellowships i'll mention
[1:07:10] the names of the brothers that would be
[1:07:12] there was our brother daniel gutierrez
[1:07:38] and all these brothers for me was was
[1:07:40] the structure that i never had
[1:07:44] they start to talk to me about the
[1:07:45] message
[1:07:47] they tell me this and the other
[1:07:49] uh
[1:07:51] and i started to enjoy those fellowships
[1:07:55] i started to go to the services at the
[1:07:56] church
[1:08:07] and brother leyva would take me to go to
[1:08:09] these groups because month after month
[1:08:10] they would change and he'd take me as an
[1:08:12] usher
[1:08:17] and i started to feel as though i
[1:08:18] pertained to the church i felt like
[1:08:20] somebody
[1:08:22] peroves
[1:08:25] but sometimes when you start to grow
[1:08:27] spiritually brothers
[1:08:29] the devil attacks you even more
[1:08:34] look you do this and you do that
[1:08:36] um
[1:08:50] messages
[1:08:54] many times the things that happen to us
[1:08:56] in life
[1:08:58] and we ask ourselves
[1:09:01] why do you allow this to happen
[1:09:04] why do you like
[1:09:13] and brother i couldn't i just see it but
[1:09:16] i see it now like he's the one doing it
[1:09:32] brother he doesn't leave a work halfway
[1:09:34] finished
[1:09:35] he's going to finish it
[1:09:41] i thank god for his grace brothers
[1:09:45] his grace that reached me
[1:09:53] and here brothers i keep fighting the
[1:09:55] good fight
[1:10:04] and i i searched for the meaning of the
[1:10:06] word grace
[1:10:08] definition says
[1:10:15] it's a sign to the concept of favor or
[1:10:17] goodness
[1:10:21] mainly when it hasn't been
[1:10:23] merited or earned
[1:10:25] especially
[1:10:28] especially for the sinners
[1:10:36] if the musicians can come forward i'll
[1:10:37] be closing soon
[1:10:41] escomo
[1:10:53] it's like the anecdote that brother
[1:10:54] branham says about the woman that was
[1:10:56] out with the men
[1:10:59] brothers
[1:11:05] where they made an old-fashioned uh
[1:11:07] revival there in in that
[1:11:10] reunion
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:33] it wasn't because that woman did
[1:11:34] something or because i did something
[1:11:38] it was because of my god's grace
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:44] brother branham says that woman was in
[1:11:46] those meetings
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:51] and now she lives a christian life
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:06] perfection

[1:12:45] and just think about it brother no
[1:12:47] no it's not something you do
[1:12:51] these are new pages that you turn no
[1:12:53] no
[1:12:54] it's not a new life that you begin it's
[1:12:56] a confession
[1:12:58] it's a confession of your evil of your
[1:12:59] wrath
[1:13:01] and god's grace for you
[1:13:05] if you could please stand with me
[1:13:06] [Music]
