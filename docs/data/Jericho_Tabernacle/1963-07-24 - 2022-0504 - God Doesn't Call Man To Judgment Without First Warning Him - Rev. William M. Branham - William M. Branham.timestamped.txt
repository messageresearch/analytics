[0:00] foreign
[1:39] you
[2:35] call 10 000 angels when one could have
[2:37] destroyed the world
[2:39] but he died just for you and me
[2:42] that's something like the basis that i
[2:45] want to have my message for sunday
[2:47] morning if the lord willing
[2:49] on what was christ
[3:08] and now
[3:09] we're expecting maybe these little girls
[3:11] could sing that song again for a sunday
[3:13] morning brother wheeler i
[3:15] certainly want to say that you sure got
[3:17] two fine little ladies there and
[3:20] they're dressing and all makeup and
[3:22] everything they look like christians to
[3:24] me and sing like and then act like that
[3:26] it's very fun
[3:28] crazy
[3:53] i
[3:54] believe i said to my wife of the day we
[3:56] have
[3:57] certainly a clean looking bunch of women
[3:59] around here i appreciate that they're
[4:01] long hair and
[4:03] clean faces and dressed decently i
[4:07] admire you
[4:08] every time that i
[4:10] i come in creon
[4:31] i said to media i'd like to get them all
[4:33] in a row sometimes take their pictures
[4:34] showing sure other churches where our
[4:36] church is here
[4:38] where we speak these things they they
[4:40] obey
[4:55] and we're glad
[4:56] it does something for us
[4:59] where i know that when we we have our
[5:01] petition if our heart condemns us not we
[5:04] know that god hears us
[5:08] beneficial
[5:18] this morning a friend of mine way away
[5:20] from here was
[5:22] laid out
[5:23] hauled him away and just barely living
[5:26] thought he'd be dead in a few minutes
[5:28] the call is about daylight
[5:44] i got out of bed on the floor and
[5:46] started praying for the old fellow and
[5:48] was able by the grace of god to contact
[5:50] that spirit you'd come back
[5:53] got all right come back again you see
[5:55] living with us tonight yet glory god
[5:58] passed
[6:17] 21 years past the time of his
[6:20] life's journey but the lord is good and
[6:22] full of mercy
[6:24] so we're grateful for it
[6:32] in la
[6:42] brother neville we look around at one
[6:44] another and i know i just got a little
[6:46] about one more service to be here and
[6:48] happy sunday
[6:49] and i i don't want to take my pastor i
[6:52] just love you hearing preach
[7:06] sunday night when he preached i tell you
[7:08] i went up here as a friend to this
[7:10] little drive in to have a sandwich
[7:12] afterwards brother evans and sister
[7:13] evans running brother and sister
[7:15] southman up there
[7:16] brother sophman all of them was
[7:18] remarking about that wonderful message
[7:20] and i'll tell you i've lived on it all
[7:21] week almost
[7:46] and some of them remarks and how that
[7:49] the ostrich thinks he had hit himself
[7:51] now that's true when he sticks his head
[7:53] in the ground but the most i mean still
[7:55] looking out so that's about the
[8:12] we try to hide our head behind something
[8:14] there's always they we're still showing
[8:16] you know he sees every bit of it she
[8:17] said
[8:18] so i really appreciate that
[8:22] is
[8:34] and i thought well
[8:35] i like to talk to the church
[8:38] well i uh brother neville gets to talk
[8:41] to you all times
[8:43] while i'm down here maybe drop down i
[8:44] don't want to be hypocrite enough and
[8:46] not out on a caller nothing's set up
[8:47] there at the house and church open down
[8:49] here i got want to be down here because
[8:51] i love you and
[9:21] the weather here doesn't agree with me
[9:23] and the country doesn't agree with me
[9:25] and i'm allergic to the air of the chair
[9:34] you know
[9:37] just as soon as that air strikes me i
[9:39] just breaking highs right over see and
[9:41] there's nothing you can do about it
[9:49] and we don't feel good none of us when
[9:51] we're here we hardly one of us has been
[9:53] really feeling good since we've been
[9:54] here because we kind of got used to the
[9:56] high climate
[10:01] nosotros
[10:10] but now
[10:12] one thing that draws me here is you all
[10:15] hey man you all
[10:17] know you find lots of friends i i'm so
[10:19] grateful i guess i i just kind of
[10:21] personally people i know be maybe
[10:24] millions around the world
[10:47] this one's estimated by someone
[10:50] probably in personal knowing of about 10
[10:52] million people but there's something
[10:54] about
[10:56] about home
[10:57] about a certain people there's just
[11:00] everybody's got these special people in
[11:02] your life
[11:12] especially
[11:21] you know i believe that if there isn't
[11:24] then why is our wife special to us you
[11:26] know why is our see where our wives our
[11:29] husbands and so forth
[11:30] it's special
[11:35] especially
[11:45] and you have that with friends it's
[11:46] something other
[11:47] that you just love to meet with them
[11:49] just talk with them these little spots
[12:02] i think of this old swamp here where
[12:04] this little church stood
[12:06] and where before it stood here there's
[12:08] nothing but a pond that's reason that
[12:10] road set way out there to get around
[12:12] that pond
[12:17] is
[12:25] this is actually the property the street
[12:27] comes right by the door there
[12:29] and uh but
[12:31] it was a pond and i remember getting out
[12:32] here and
[12:34] trying to find a place to build
[12:36] a church to the lord
[12:38] and just a young boy and i listened
[12:40] these this young fellow southern over
[12:41] here praying a while ago with all that
[12:43] enthusiasm
[13:07] i thought you know i used to be able to
[13:09] pray like that without catching my
[13:10] breath hardly and then you get older you
[13:13] kind of slow down a little you know
[13:16] you're still moving but you're in second
[13:17] gear as i told brother
[13:38] you get down into low gear when you get
[13:40] about 70 or 80 i guess but you know then
[13:44] you're still moving as long as you can
[13:46] move what difference does it make just a
[13:47] little more time to get there
[13:51] especially
[14:08] i remember
[14:09] how
[14:10] was praying and right here in this weed
[14:13] right where this pulpit stands now just
[14:15] about where it's at that's what drove a
[14:17] little stake where no to put the pope
[14:31] lord god give me this place
[14:35] now right there in a cornerstone lays my
[14:37] testimony of a vision the morning i laid
[14:39] it
[14:40] when i hardly could think man said this
[14:42] is not your tabernacle
[14:44] but do the work of an evangelist he said
[14:56] when
[15:05] i looked out and seen all the world
[15:07] during the bright blue skies and people
[15:09] coming from everywhere
[15:11] it's laying in the cornerstone there how
[15:13] little did i think that would happen
[15:14] even though the vision said so but it
[15:17] doesn't fail
[15:18] it's going to be there anyhow
[15:42] i've been a lot of interviews this week
[15:44] because sunday
[15:46] the gracious presence of the lord came
[15:48] down and i supposed to have left monday
[15:51] estadon muchas entrepreneurs
[16:00] we haven't took a vacation yet the kids
[16:02] my vacation comes later a little later
[16:04] on but i
[16:07] want to take the children on a little
[16:08] time they got to go back go to school
[16:10] now
[16:11] so
[16:12] i thought this week would be a good time
[16:13] facing chicago next week in that meeting
[16:15] there
[16:19] is
[16:34] a but then
[16:37] the anointing of the spirit i thought
[16:39] now is the time to have interviews now
[16:41] is the time of
[16:42] these i can get caught up on a few of
[16:44] them
[16:46] i see some of the people sitting present
[16:47] that was in the room they know where the
[16:49] lord met with us or not um
[17:13] everyone besides some woman that billy
[17:15] put in just a space just before some
[17:17] lady from louisville she had a little
[17:18] girl and
[17:19] we shared i think they really belonged
[17:21] to church of god in louisville or
[17:22] something
[17:25] todd
[17:37] but every case every one of me come in
[17:39] before i left home the holy spirit told
[17:42] me who would be here what they'd asked
[17:44] and i wrote down on a piece of paper and
[17:46] said just what they'd ask their
[17:47] questions the way they'd asked them and
[17:48] how they'd be answered
[18:08] and i tell them i said yours just watch
[18:10] you look now a few minutes ago i hear
[18:11] what the holy spirit reach over on the
[18:13] death say he he told me this before he
[18:15] ever come see but what is up in the
[18:16] house who would be there and what would
[18:18] be what their attitude would be and all
[18:20] about poor even left home
[18:24] this year
[18:49] i've seen the time many times when it
[18:50] could be coming down the road praying
[18:52] i'd see that prayer line pass before me
[18:54] and no every name that would be in the
[18:55] prayer line before i ever got here
[18:59] know where they were sitting in the
[19:00] church and what the how they'd be
[19:02] dressed and what they look like
[19:04] [Music]
[19:06] orlando
[19:22] you don't tell people everything like at
[19:24] you these things happen you just don't
[19:26] tell them it's not necessary to tell
[19:28] them i just tell people things that i
[19:30] think is going to help them when the
[19:31] lord presses me to tell them say say
[19:33] this
[19:50] you want to tell everything you seen
[19:52] because that wouldn't be right you see
[19:54] you just
[19:55] get in trouble and everything else like
[19:57] that you have to know how to handle
[19:59] those things by the spirit of the lord
[20:16] i've had people stand before me and ask
[20:18] me questions i know exactly i wouldn't
[20:20] tell him because i just felt constrained
[20:22] not to do it
[20:32] remember i believe was last wednesday
[20:34] night i preached on a prisoner see see
[20:36] you want to tell that person but
[20:38] something says don't do it the spirit
[20:39] says don't do it don't do it yet a gift
[20:41] is looking right at it see don't do it
[20:43] don't do it
[20:44] so you better not do it then you're in
[20:45] trouble with god
[20:50] [Music]
[21:11] now
[21:13] we don't come down here tonight just to
[21:16] stand here we want to hear the word of
[21:17] the lord you've been praying we've had a
[21:19] wonderful time
[21:31] and i
[21:32] always want to come down i know bring
[21:34] this little book of text because he's
[21:36] uh sometimes brother neville is so
[21:38] gracious he just keeps asking me will
[21:40] you do this or do that or speak and i
[21:43] looked through here to find me a text of
[21:44] some sort and then we started from there
[22:05] and i'm sure now be sure
[22:08] sunday
[22:09] now i don't we never know we cannot tell
[22:12] you see i've come here at times with
[22:14] with the text in my mind that i was
[22:16] going to speak on again here and change
[22:17] it completely around yesterday
[22:34] and i've had scriptures roll down i say
[22:36] i'm going to use this text or use these
[22:38] scriptures as they come down and we'll
[22:39] say this that or the other yet
[22:48] i'll write down this like uh
[22:50] first corinthians 5 15 and second
[22:53] corinthians 7 1 and matthew 28 16 so
[22:56] forth just put it in like that down like
[22:58] this and write them scriptures down and
[22:59] look down there i know what the
[23:00] scripture says there
[23:01] sometimes i never even touch that goes
[23:03] all the way around a different way
[23:05] altogether and we just
[23:31] so now um if the lord is willing
[23:35] i want to speak
[23:37] and closing these little series of
[23:39] services since being here
[23:41] sunday morning on a very important thing
[23:45] so now
[23:46] come early
[23:48] prepare to stay at least a little bit
[23:50] late maybe
[23:51] about two o'clock something like that
[24:13] i got around about
[24:15] 30 or 40 scriptures already wrote down
[24:17] on the subject but i think what it what
[24:19] i'm going to try to do if the holy
[24:20] spirit will help me
[24:22] to catch the message and the place where
[24:24] it's at now and build it right up where
[24:27] it started and build it right up into
[24:28] the present time ways is
[24:48] so that when i i'll leave for chicago
[24:50] then i got to go straight to arizona and
[24:51] then on on and on and it may be as far
[24:54] as i know it may be next year again
[24:55] maybe next summer before i get back
[24:57] again the tabernacle is passing across
[24:59] this way again because it got meetings

[26:39] thousand invitations around the world

[27:02] on which one of those to go to and what
[27:04] to do we just depend on him
[27:16] you couldn't take them all
[27:18] you couldn't take over

[30:04] sang them with joy in our hearts and
[30:07] i heard him as they come in clapping
[30:09] hands
[30:24] and we went out on our knees and all
[30:26] poured out our hearts
[30:27] to you and thanks you for what you've
[30:29] done for us and
[30:31] i asked you to continue to walk with us
[30:44] now the hour has come
[30:46] for the reading of the word
[30:49] and for something to speak on to the
[30:51] people direct us in our thoughts father
[30:54] and get glory
[31:00] personas

[31:13] to live better and closer to you than we
[31:16] ever have that's what we're here for
[31:18] lord we are here to know more about you
[31:37] and we pray that you will unfold your
[31:39] great being to us tonight in the
[31:41] revelation of thy word that we might
[31:44] know how to be a a better christian
[31:47] and how to act in this last days we
[31:50] asked it in jesus name
[31:52] amen
[31:58] in the revelation
[32:13] come my
[32:14] uh sight falls upon a picture of isaiah
[32:18] isaiah 38.
[32:23] let's read over to isaiah
[32:26] isaiah 38.
[32:40] in those days was
[32:42] hezekiah sick unto death
[32:45] and isaiah the prophet the son of
[32:48] amos
[32:50] came unto him and said unto him thus
[32:53] saith the lord set thine house in order
[32:57] for thou shall die and not live
[33:04] in vermont
[33:08] and
[33:17] then hezekiah turned his face towards
[33:20] the wall and prayed unto the lord
[33:22] and said remember me o lord i beseech
[33:26] thee i have walked before thee in truth
[33:29] and with a perfect heart
[33:31] and have done that which is good in thy
[33:34] sight
[33:35] and
[33:36] hezekiah
[34:03] then came the word of the lord to isaiah
[34:05] saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith
[34:08] the lord the god of david thy father
[34:12] i've heard thy prayer i have seen thy
[34:15] tears behold i will add unto thy days 15
[34:19] years
[34:39] may the lord add his blessings to this
[34:42] reading
[34:43] it's a very
[34:48] outstanding
[34:49] uh subject for a short message here i
[34:52] believe
[34:53] i want to call it
[34:55] god doesn't call man to judgment without
[34:58] first warning
[35:15] and we are we're we're we catch the the
[35:18] background or the platform of it here
[35:20] and this text tonight god warning man
[35:24] before bringing him to
[35:26] uh is death inosotros
[35:42] now
[35:44] every one has this we might say well
[35:48] this fella died without a warning no no
[35:50] no
[35:51] god never you don't know what was that
[35:53] man's heart you don't know what's been
[35:54] going on in his life see god never
[35:57] brings any man to his death without
[35:59] first warning about it tell him it's
[36:01] something of preparation
[36:10] no
[36:27] god is
[36:29] is sovereign and he he knocks at the
[36:31] heart of every man giving him the
[36:33] opportunity
[36:34] to come
[36:44] now he might ward away and turn it down
[36:46] and shake his head to it and walk away
[36:48] so it's just a funny feeling i'll get
[36:50] over it but anyhow it was god
[36:54] god speaking to him
[37:14] and
[37:15] god never even brings judgment upon the
[37:18] earth without first giving the people a
[37:20] warning
[37:21] god never does nothing without declaring
[37:24] it first
[37:25] what he's going to do
[37:28] is
[37:37] and he gives people a choice and you can
[37:39] you can do right or wrong that says see
[37:42] god can never change
[37:45] his nature his program can never change
[37:48] from what he started with because he's
[37:50] infinite in his program and his ideas
[37:53] are all perfect
[38:02] hamas
[38:15] so if he would change it that would show
[38:17] that he'd learn more so being infinite
[38:19] he cannot learn more his his first his
[38:22] first decision is always perfect and
[38:25] there's nothing can ever change
[38:42] god before man
[38:44] ever was put uh had a chance to do wrong
[38:48] god put him on the basis to where he
[38:50] could accept our
[38:52] deny
[38:53] he could receive our or not
[38:58] opportunity
[39:08] by the way if that minister in here
[39:10] brother baker
[39:12] uh i believe was on the
[39:14] the interviews the other day i've got
[39:16] these questions that he had rolled out
[39:18] for me on the serpent seed i got him
[39:21] laying back here now
[39:25] hermano baker
[39:35] if he's sure why well i don't see him
[39:37] anywhere right at the present time but
[39:39] it's sure he and his wife
[39:40] a very fine man and a woman
[39:44] but they they couldn't understand a few
[39:46] things about the teaching of the
[39:48] serpent's seed
[39:53] moment
[40:09] said in and sermons beyond that and and
[40:12] talking about the
[40:13] the impregnation and so forth but uh
[40:17] then it's just like a
[40:19] brother a fine man just a christian for
[40:21] a couple years or two but just didn't
[40:23] understand you see
[40:27] us
[40:34] yes
[40:44] it's hard if you don't you have to
[40:47] depend on the holy spirit because this
[40:49] bible is rotten riddles
[40:51] you just can't sit down and read like a
[40:52] newspaper
[40:54] it's head yes sir
[41:09] how would you ever justify god when he
[41:12] told
[41:13] moses
[41:14] up there said
[41:16] now don't you make any engraving images
[41:18] in his commandments don't you make
[41:20] anything like heaven any any angel or
[41:22] anything else don't make any engraving
[41:23] images and yet on the same day told him
[41:26] to mold two angels out of brass and put
[41:29] him right at the mercy seat where
[41:31] mercy's at
[42:04] you have to know god in his nature
[42:07] before you can understand his word he he
[42:10] he has the key to that word himself
[42:13] and he he's the only one can handle and
[42:15] open it
[42:16] and so
[42:17] he's the one has to reveal it
[42:22] is
[42:36] and now we find out
[42:39] that is nature wash here there are
[42:41] always to warn a man
[42:44] before judgment to warn a nation before
[42:47] judgment and so forth
[42:55] is
[43:00] he always gives his warning a reminder
[43:03] to we
[43:05] of a responsibility
[43:08] we are responsible
[43:11] and god is punisher on the earth for a
[43:13] reason
[43:15] and that reason that he is punisher for
[43:17] we are responsible to him for that
[43:20] reason
[43:21] you should go to him and find out what
[43:23] he wants you to do
[43:24] el
[43:48] if you don't if you went to work for a
[43:51] man he'd give you a job on a ranch or
[43:53] something other than you just went out
[43:54] to the barn
[43:55] and just sit down out there and say well
[43:57] see you must go ask him
[44:00] what he wants you to do and then do it
[44:02] if you're working for a man find out
[44:04] what your duties is
[44:28] and then if our life is on the
[44:31] earth here then we should go to the one
[44:32] who punisher
[44:34] lord what would you have me do what what
[44:36] what must i do why am i here
[44:54] it is to be a housewife dishwasher if
[44:57] it's to be whatever god wants you to do
[44:59] then you do that the very best that you
[45:01] know how to do it no matter how little
[45:04] no matter how little it is you must do
[45:07] it
[45:16] no important significante
[45:22] you say well the trouble of it is
[45:25] each one of us wants to do the next
[45:26] man's job we all want to pack the ball
[45:29] as we say you see
[45:42] like this watcher
[45:43] now every little movement in there has
[45:46] its place
[45:48] now
[45:49] every part of it can't be the hands now
[45:51] i only look at the hand to see what time
[45:53] it is
[45:54] but if one of them little wheels in
[45:56] there gets out of order that won't keep
[45:58] the right time
[46:20] that's the way it is with people we've
[46:22] all the body of christ has got to be in
[46:25] their position and harmony see and then
[46:29] we can look around and see what time of
[46:31] day it is
[46:46] then the worlds are looking to see what
[46:48] it is
[46:49] see but they're watching you
[46:51] and if you're just a little hairspring
[46:53] mainspring or whatever you are you do
[46:56] the very best job you can at that end
[47:14] now because we have a responsibility
[47:17] that we've got to answer to god someday
[47:20] for every man that come on to face the
[47:22] earth has to answer to god for our
[47:25] responsibility
[47:26] and to many of us a stewardship we have
[47:29] to answer for
[47:32] response
[47:47] this responsibility is a stewardship
[47:49] that's been committed to us by god i
[47:51] don't care what it is as i said a few
[47:54] moments ago a housewife then be a
[47:56] genuine housewife
[47:58] that's right if it's to be a farmer be a
[48:00] genuine farmer
[48:02] nosotros
[48:21] whatever it is that goddess but you do
[48:23] you've got a stewardship to that you've
[48:25] got to answer to god for because it
[48:27] takes all these things to do it
[48:30] is
[48:43] was
[48:44] told to make ready to get ready because
[48:47] that he had to meet his maker
[48:50] hezekiah was a king and a great man
[49:04] you notice this plea here lord i beseech
[49:07] you to consider me i i've walked before
[49:10] you with a perfect heart what a
[49:12] testimony that is to
[49:14] to us today this should be
[49:16] a man that walks before god
[49:28] testimony
[49:36] even death was pronounced upon the man
[49:38] and yet god changed his mind about him
[49:42] because hezekiah
[49:44] wanted to do something and god said he
[49:46] would give us the desires of our heart
[50:03] you got a cancer on him or something
[50:05] other
[50:06] and they call it a ball in that day but
[50:07] we know barrels don't regularly kill you
[50:10] they just get well but it's perhaps the
[50:12] cancer and it opened up like a boil
[50:24] normally
[50:32] and god told isaiah said go up there and
[50:35] tell him that he's going to die and
[50:37] hezekiah had something he wanted to do
[50:39] yet
[50:48] yet when you plead anything to god you
[50:50] got to be a reason for it
[50:52] it's just like this scripture that is so
[50:53] often referred to if you say to this
[50:56] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[50:58] believe that what you've said will come
[50:59] to pass you can have what you said now
[51:02] that's all together controlled on motive
[51:04] and objective thing
[51:35] see you just can't go out here that's
[51:36] where many of us makes uh many mistakes
[51:39] is going on saying i'll show you i got
[51:41] faith to do this now you're wrong to
[51:43] begin with
[51:44] god don't give you gifts just to play
[51:46] with it ben
[51:48] solo
[52:07] just to play with that's nothing to play
[52:09] with that's sacred
[52:10] just use it in as the lord will let you
[52:13] be a prisoner to him comedy
[52:29] no matter how much you want to tell that
[52:30] guy is wrong and what this the other you
[52:33] hold still to god says so
[52:35] then when god says so then you can come
[52:37] with thus saith the lord and tell that
[52:39] just forget about it
[52:58] the world today just like hezekiah was
[53:01] then it's been warned
[53:04] it's constantly being warned the church
[53:06] is being warned
[53:08] and now these things just don't happen
[53:10] by
[53:11] by chance
[53:12] they've all got something behind them
[53:32] now
[53:33] hezekiah being sick having this bar that
[53:36] wasn't by chance god sent isaiah up
[53:39] there and told him to set his house in
[53:41] order now because he's going to die
[53:54] hezekiah wept
[53:56] and told god i walked before the perfect
[53:59] heart and i i pray you spare my life for
[54:02] a cause a good cause the cause of god
[54:05] god told the prophet said go back and
[54:07] tell him yes
[54:24] isn't that strange hezekiah was the
[54:26] greatest man in the land
[54:28] hezekiah was a king and a godly man
[54:32] he was a real man
[54:34] if he could plead that before god and
[54:36] god didn't rebuke him far i've walked
[54:38] before you with a perfect heart
[54:41] now that's a saying a whole lot
[54:48] important
[55:05] and god never said no hezekiah you
[55:07] didn't do it but he admitted he did do
[55:08] it and he said i'm going to i'm going to
[55:11] spare your life a little longer see i'm
[55:13] going to give you a request
[55:14] see because he had been a just man he
[55:17] had been a a real servant to christ
[55:38] and then we feel that we have a right to
[55:40] ask something if our objective is right
[55:43] and then our motive to it
[55:45] important
[55:53] now we see today
[55:56] that for the past
[55:58] many years i'd say for the past 15 to
[56:02] more years that constantly there's been
[56:05] a warning out across the nation
[56:08] repent our perish
[56:23] you notice i was talking today to the
[56:25] wife just early this morning
[56:28] and i early breakfast we were setting a
[56:30] table talking before i left
[56:42] i said wife uh she's talking about billy
[56:46] graham
[56:47] and about his wife is how common and
[56:49] everything they tried to live i said
[56:51] that is a real servant when he tries
[57:04] when a man maybe makes 2-3 million a
[57:07] year
[57:08] out in his campaigns but he doesn't
[57:10] receive it his foundation takes it
[57:12] placing it back into the work in the
[57:14] broadcast and so forth and billy gets
[57:16] about 25 000 here
[57:23] received
[57:31] she said how would he ever spend 25 000
[57:33] here i said he he takes just what he has
[57:36] to have that's all he's got a home to
[57:38] pay for
[57:39] everything that went on i said i've got
[57:41] lots of respects for billy graham i said
[57:43] because he has a message and that
[57:46] message is repentance
[58:07] and i i'll tell you there's nobody and i
[58:10] know of
[58:11] in the lands today that god has used
[58:13] with that message like billy graham oh
[58:15] he's got a down pat he just stands there
[58:18] and i mean he calls them politicians and
[58:21] church members to repentance but that's
[58:23] as far as it goes
[58:43] and here comes brother oral roberts
[58:45] another great servant of the lord and
[58:49] there's nobody that comes out there and
[58:50] compare with oral robbers
[58:59] oral roberts that bulldog grip of if uh
[59:03] you're just casting out evil spirits and
[59:06] calling the name of the lord and and
[59:08] little sensations and so forth
[59:10] about divine healing that's exactly
[59:13] right
[59:27] there is a messenger to the pentecost
[59:29] there is a messenger to the church
[59:31] denominational world see and the coal
[59:33] world and then look around at our own
[59:35] little humble ministry standing jesus
[59:38] christ the same yesterday today and
[59:40] forever you see hey
[59:44] hey
[1:00:01] what's that doing calling that bride
[1:00:03] group you see
[1:00:04] hallelujah it calls from both those
[1:00:08] groups it's taking a wheel out of the
[1:00:10] wheel see what i mean
[1:00:25] and then god confirms that message that
[1:00:27] billy graham preaches god heals the sick
[1:00:30] by oral robert's prayers and god
[1:00:33] produces the things that jesus proved
[1:00:35] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:00:37] and forever and it's calling those
[1:00:38] things it's messages of the
[1:01:01] and each one of those messages is
[1:01:03] calling repent or perish
[1:01:07] that's right
[1:01:09] or perish there's
[1:01:10] no hopes it's all gone
[1:01:13] world's warned of his coming each one of
[1:01:16] the messages speaks and warns of the
[1:01:18] coming of the lord jesus
[1:01:21] both through the
[1:01:22] church denial
[1:01:45] remember god's always in threes
[1:01:47] like father son and holy ghost and
[1:01:49] justification bap and sanctification
[1:01:51] baptism holy ghost so far these and
[1:01:53] threes
[1:02:04] and of them
[1:02:07] one of them
[1:02:08] i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of
[1:02:11] them hallelujah one of them
[1:02:15] i'm one of them
[1:02:17] i'm so glad that i can say i am one of
[1:02:21] them
[1:02:22] they were gathered in the upper room all
[1:02:25] praying in his name they were baptized
[1:02:27] with the holy ghost and power for
[1:02:29] service came now what he did for them
[1:02:32] that day he'll do for you the same i'm
[1:02:35] so glad that i can say i'm one of them
[1:02:39] one of them
