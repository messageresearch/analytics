[41:53] title tonight

[42:00] and my subtitle is a potential
[42:03] subtitle um where i
[42:06] got my title from
[42:08] [Music]
[42:10] my title sounds a little um confusing
[42:14] i could have said what i'm going to be
[42:18] boy but i got this title
[42:23] from um brother branham's message things
[42:25] that are to be
[42:26] hey
[42:30] that's a tremendous message
[42:34] a message um that i i believe every
[42:38] person should listen to um
[42:42] because he speaks of the beginning of
[42:44] the principle he speaks
[42:46] of eternity he speaks of
[42:49] who we are now and he speaks of where
[42:52] we're going
[42:54] all the way back to eternity
[43:05] [Music]
[43:07] these things that are now our only
[43:10] potential estas
[43:13] on potential calling for the things that
[43:16] is
[43:17] to be amando
[43:20] so the things that are now
[43:24] our only potential potential
[43:27] are only potentially the things that are
[43:29] to be es potential
[43:32] so my title is what i am to be
[43:35] itos what every
[43:39] person every child of god
[43:43] is supposed to be and is going to be
[43:48] your potential is in you now
[43:52] you are the potential of what you're
[43:54] gonna be us
[43:58] potential is a dormant power potential
[44:04] it means the capable of development
[44:11] potential means hidden strength
[44:16] it's a power it has
[44:19] all the the abilities inside of it
[44:24] yeah but it's inactive it's
[44:27] dormant it needs to be activated
[44:32] and each and every person here tonight
[44:35] has potential
[44:38] potential today today
[44:41] uh is uh um youth service oh yes
[44:46] so i i want to direct this message to
[44:48] the youth says
[44:51] that every one of you have potential
[44:56] it doesn't matter what anybody tells you
[44:59] it doesn't matter how you look like
[45:02] it doesn't matter what they say in
[45:04] school about it
[45:06] it doesn't matter what they say at work
[45:10] it doesn't even matter what you think of
[45:12] yourself
[45:15] you have potential in you
[45:19] as a child of god you are
[45:22] born with eternal potential
[45:25] eternal it's a power that is hidden
[45:28] within you
[45:34] amen amen uh there's a quote that i i
[45:38] really enjoyed um brother branham would
[45:40] quote this colored sister
[45:42] unassita que verdado branham
[45:46] he says it in the message convince and
[45:49] then concerned
[45:56] like the old colored lady said
[46:02] brother i i want to give my testimony
[46:05] testimonial i said go ahead sister
[46:09] she said you know what she said i
[46:13] hate what i ought to be he said
[46:16] i ain't what i want to be no soy lo que
[46:19] quiro
[46:20] but one thing sure i know peru
[46:24] i ain't what i used to be
[46:27] and brother branham says so that's about
[46:29] good jose mourinho
[46:31] i'm not what i want to be no soil and
[46:34] i'm not what i
[46:36] i ought to be but i'm so glad that i'm
[46:40] not who i used to be
[46:43] and for every christian that has heard
[46:45] that quote
[46:48] we've received comfort by these these
[46:50] this quote
[46:53] and the words that actually give us the
[46:56] comfort las palabras
[46:57] consuelo is that i'm not who i used to
[47:01] be
[47:03] i'm not what i'm supposed to be but i
[47:06] know that i'm not what i used
[47:13] and everyone by by god's grace can
[47:15] honestly say this
[47:19] that i'm not what i used to be no soil
[47:23] can look back and say there is progress
[47:28] you can look back and say there was
[47:30] development
[47:33] you can look back and you say i have
[47:35] grown
[47:38] amen amen but but these words
[47:42] the the first words of this quote
[47:46] that say i'm not what i ought to be okay
[47:50] i'm
[48:03] you are not put in the finish in the
[48:06] finish line
[48:08] but you are placed on the starting point
[48:13] you're not who you used to be no it is
[48:16] amen
[48:16] amen praise god
[48:27] and it causes us to understand that
[48:29] we're barely in the beginning of our
[48:32] christian journey
[48:36] and i want to ask this question
[48:40] how did you become from what you used to
[48:43] be to who you are now
[48:49] by the grace of god
[48:53] by jesus christ
[48:56] not by our works if it was by my works
[49:00] i'd be farther from the lord than i'd
[49:02] ever be
[49:04] just but by my
[49:07] but by god's grace i'm not
[49:11] who i used to be
[49:14] so now we understand how we got to this
[49:17] point
[49:19] it's by god's grace by god's grace you
[49:23] are saved
[49:25] by god's grace you are here tonight
[49:41] i become more joyful listen to listening
[49:43] to these words
[49:46] i'm not what i'm supposed to be no solo
[49:50] and i'm not what i want to be
[49:54] but if it was by god's grace i am where
[49:56] i am now
[50:10] that's potential es potential every
[50:14] single person has potential in their
[50:16] lives today
[50:19] potential is something that you're not
[50:21] yet
[50:22] potential but it's
[50:34] that means there's more of god to be
[50:36] done in my life
[50:49] to need more of christ is a good thing
[50:54] amen amen i'm not what i ought to be
[50:57] no soil potential is uh
[51:01] is not what's already have been has
[51:03] already been done
[51:21] [Music]
[51:22] uh the easter seal preached in 1965.
[51:28] he said notice it's the earnest or
[51:31] potential
[51:33] potential quicken the quickening power
[51:36] of your resurrection
[51:40] when you receive the holy spirit
[51:44] that is then dwelling in you the
[51:46] potential of it and
[52:00] the potential of your rapture rapturing
[52:03] body is in you now
[52:08] when you receive the holy ghost
[52:12] so when somebody receives the holy ghost
[52:14] the potential of your resurrection is in
[52:15] you now don't
[52:32] amen amen this is what brother branham
[52:36] says
[52:36] estella christian and uh this is the
[52:39] exposition of the seventh church age
[52:41] book uh
[52:44] and the of the sardinian
[52:47] sardisian age
[52:52] and the way that it is done was by
[52:56] god's perfect will and programming
[53:05] the lutherans had the holy ghost
[53:08] potentially under justification los
[53:11] luteranos
[53:31] which means that you accepted jesus
[53:33] christ as your personal savior
[53:40] you're still struggling with things of
[53:42] the world
[53:44] maybe you're sanctified and the things
[53:46] of the world are out of you
[53:51] yeah you don't have the holy spirit
[53:55] but brother branham says potentially you
[53:57] already have the holy ghost
[54:02] see you're not a seed when you receive
[54:04] the holy ghost
[54:07] we didn't become seed
[54:11] we didn't become predestinated seed when
[54:13] we received the holy ghost
[54:18] we always were see
[54:22] you were
[54:38] without even having the holy ghost
[54:41] brother branham said continues in the
[54:43] exposition of the seven church ages
[54:47] he said we did not become seed by the
[54:50] rebirth he
[54:54] we were seed and therefore we were
[54:56] reborn
[55:00] for only the elect can be reborn
[55:19] hold this carefully in mind
[55:23] now take the next step redeems to
[55:27] redeem means to buy you back
[55:32] it restores to the original owner
[55:36] by his death shed shed blood
[55:40] brought back his own poros
[55:46] he bought back the spoken word seed
[55:49] bride el compro de regreso
[55:51] la simiente la novia de la palabra
[55:54] romans 8 30
[55:55] romano trent for moreover whom he
[55:59] predestinated porque los
[56:28] glorificator you know what predestined
[56:31] means
[56:34] before
[56:38] pre means in front very significant
[56:41] pre means in the beginning
[56:57] so when he created each and every child
[56:59] of god
[57:02] he pre-made you el te prejiso he made
[57:06] you
[57:06] with your beginning and your end already
[57:08] el te is going to proceed
[57:10] to finn he made you with everything that
[57:12] you need
[57:13] for the journey he made it inside you
[57:15] now
[57:20] when he created you he already
[57:23] put your future inside
[57:27] amen amen let's turn to genesis 1 11.
[57:35] the bible says and let us
[57:39] and god said let us bring forth grass
[57:41] and herb
[57:44] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[57:47] fruit
[57:48] tree yielding fruit after its kind whose
[57:50] seed is in itself
[57:52] upon the earth and it was so despues
[57:56] produced
[58:07] and the earth brought forth grass and
[58:10] herb yielding seed
[58:11] after his kind and the tree yielding
[58:14] fruit
[58:14] whose seed was in itself
[58:17] whose seed was in itself after his kind
[58:21] and
[58:22] god saw that it was good produced
[58:49] everything that that seal needed he
[58:51] already put inside of it
[58:55] if i give you a seed if i give you an
[58:58] acorn
[59:01] what do you see quebec do you see just
[59:04] an
[59:05] ugly brown seed cafe
[59:08] or do you see the potential of it
[59:11] oh wow i can plant it in the back of my
[59:13] yard
[59:16] and it could be a big beautiful tree
[59:19] and it could give me shade and i could
[59:22] put a swing on it
[59:25] but yet you're still looking at a seed
[59:30] when god
[59:41] oh that person is never going to get
[59:42] right
[59:58] when people see your your faults and
[1:00:01] your your
[1:00:01] your wrong doings
[1:00:06] they don't see the potential they don't
[1:00:09] see the power behind you
[1:00:12] they don't
[1:00:26] when the pharisees walked up to jesus
[1:00:30] they saw him they said he's a drunkard
[1:00:34] he he's he's a uh uh uh
[1:00:38] what was it that he called him they
[1:00:39] called him a devil
[1:00:54] that's
[1:01:22] oh this girl she'll never get right oh
[1:01:24] my god
[1:01:27] oh no they they'll won't pass school no
[1:01:30] no no
[1:01:32] oh they don't have any future yet inside
[1:01:35] of them
[1:01:36] is all the potential
[1:01:39] inside of them is eternal life
[1:01:43] and all they're looking at is the seed
[1:01:47] but you allow that seed to be planted
[1:01:56] but it will grow a tree with more seeds
[1:02:01] and those seeds have more trees yes
[1:02:13] and when god created those trees from
[1:02:17] the beginning
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:59] and sometimes it feels like you were
[1:03:01] buried to die
[1:03:05] but don't worry there's life inside you
[1:03:10] and you'll go through all those trials
[1:03:12] and tribulations
[1:03:24] and they saw all ugly things under
[1:03:28] heaven
[1:03:32] that he was the alpha alpha he was the
[1:03:35] omega omega he was the beginning
[1:03:39] and he is the ending and he says that he
[1:03:43] was
[1:03:44] he he says he was um which was
[1:03:49] which is and which is to come
[1:03:53] you know what that means that he had
[1:03:56] predestination inside of it
[1:03:59] from beginning to end was inside of one
[1:04:02] man
[1:04:05] and inside of you is alpha and omegas
[1:04:09] it's the predestined
[1:04:36] it's up to us to bring it out
[1:04:46] he said if jesus christ was here tonight
[1:04:51] he couldn't do any more for you
[1:04:54] he couldn't heal you why because he
[1:04:57] already did it
[1:05:00] it's up to you now it's up to your faith
[1:05:05] so that you can pull that potential down
[1:05:10] you pull that power of healing
[1:05:15] amen amen brother branham says
[1:05:19] in the message god's power to transform
[1:05:22] this element now god put the seed in
[1:05:26] there
[1:05:29] with the potentials that it would be
[1:05:31] what he said it would be para potencial
[1:05:33] que
[1:05:35] and puedes long as it stays in the right
[1:05:37] category
[1:05:40] it would be just exactly what god said
[1:05:42] it would be based
[1:05:46] it had to be that way denia caceres
[1:05:49] because
[1:05:50] he made it that way
[1:05:54] and he made a channel that anything that
[1:05:58] stays in the channel in the line of his
[1:06:00] word
[1:06:03] it will bring forth exactly like his
[1:06:06] word said it would do
[1:06:07] this
[1:06:11] it cannot move from there it's channeled
[1:06:14] just exactly right
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:34] and each one of those seeds has power in
[1:06:37] itself
[1:06:40] to transform itself into the species
[1:06:43] that i desire it to be but
[1:06:59] salir de si mismo in its potentials now
[1:07:02] to make it
[1:07:03] out of itself exactly what i want it to
[1:07:06] be
[1:07:10] where where is the transforming power
[1:07:12] the
[1:07:17] to transform you from a justified state
[1:07:19] to the holy ghost
[1:07:24] where is it what church is it is
[1:07:34] brother branham says he put that
[1:07:36] transforming power in every scene
[1:07:44] and you have the power to transform
[1:07:47] within yourself
[1:07:50] he's given that to you
[1:07:54] when god told adam he told him to
[1:07:57] multiply
[1:07:59] that was his commission he had all the
[1:08:04] potential in him he had everything
[1:08:08] inside of him
[1:08:10] to achieve god's purpose
[1:08:13] but because of sin death more than
[1:08:17] multiplication
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:27] the bible says in john 12 24
[1:08:31] and juan dos very early i say unto you
[1:08:34] except a corn of wheat fall into a
[1:08:36] ground to the ground
[1:08:38] and die it abideth alone but if it die
[1:08:42] it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:08:55] he multiplied billions multiplico biones
[1:08:58] he multiplied eternal life multiplicola
[1:09:01] because that is the commission
[1:09:04] and god rested after the fulfillness of
[1:09:07] that seed
[1:09:08] came to pass
[1:09:13] that seed god has eternity within that
[1:09:16] seed within you
[1:09:21] and it's up to you what you're going to
[1:09:23] do with that potential
[1:09:26] potential i don't know if you remember
[1:09:27] that story
[1:09:30] the story of the king that gave his
[1:09:33] servants the talents
[1:09:38] he gave one five talents
[1:09:41] he gave one two talents and he gave
[1:09:44] the other one talent and the bible says
[1:09:48] he gave it to them
[1:09:49] according to their abilities
[1:09:54] god will give you a purpose but he'll
[1:09:57] give you the potential to fulfill that
[1:10:00] purpose
[1:10:05] whatever if it might be bringing two
[1:10:08] souls to christ
[1:10:11] whether it might be raising a little
[1:10:14] pastor
[1:10:30] so he gave them every talent according
[1:10:33] to their abilities
[1:10:36] one five one two and the other one
[1:10:41] and when he came back the one with five
[1:10:44] he
[1:10:44] doubled his talents
[1:10:49] instead of giving him the five that he
[1:10:51] gave him he gave him 10.
[1:10:55] he said praise god he said into the joys
[1:10:59] of the lord
[1:11:02] then that the one with the two came and
[1:11:04] he doubled his prophet
[1:11:09] but then the one that had
[1:11:24] a it's something that we rejoice with
[1:11:31] oh the holy ghost oh man it gives me
[1:11:34] strength every day
[1:11:38] but it's something that you need to work
[1:11:41] with
[1:11:44] god didn't give you the holy ghost just
[1:11:46] so you can sit at home
[1:11:50] god didn't give you the holy ghost just
[1:11:52] so that you can come to church and go
[1:11:54] home and come to church and go to work
[1:12:01] god gave you that gift
[1:12:06] god
[1:12:22] and it was just one solamentera uno and
[1:12:24] he said well
[1:12:25] what happened what why did you just come
[1:12:28] back with
[1:12:29] just the one
[1:12:33] and the man says i
[1:12:49] why aren't you fulfilling the potential
[1:12:51] god has already given you
[1:12:53] potential there has been people that
[1:12:56] that have been prayed over and
[1:12:58] prophesied
[1:13:02] and they're living below their potential
[1:13:06] and one of these days we're gonna have
[1:13:08] to answer for them
[1:13:12] why did you come back just with this
[1:13:15] when i gave you so much when i gave you
[1:13:19] all of this
[1:13:20] according to your abilities
[1:13:24] and you would come back with nothing
[1:13:28] this potential is so that we can work
[1:13:30] with
[1:13:39] so that we can multiply the eternity
[1:13:41] amongst our brothers and our sisters
[1:14:05] that's the worst feeling
[1:14:08] the feeling of not doing what you're
[1:14:10] supposed to do
[1:14:26] he actually said we're living million
[1:14:28] miles
[1:14:30] below our god-given privilege
[1:14:36] that's the worst feeling
[1:14:39] is that i could have done something but
[1:14:41] i didn't
[1:14:44] because i was afraid because i didn't
[1:14:47] know how
[1:14:48] no because i didn't know what step to
[1:14:51] take
[1:14:53] just step and god will fulfill your
[1:14:55] purpose
[1:14:58] just be led by the holy spirit
[1:15:02] just step into your promises
[1:15:06] step into your your purpose to
[1:15:11] you know there's a story of a young rich
[1:15:12] ruler
[1:15:16] now this man is called the young
[1:15:20] rich ruler so he's gotta
[1:15:24] be ambitious he's fulfilled a lot of
[1:15:28] things
[1:15:30] he's got riches but he was
[1:15:34] lacking one thing pero le faltava na
[1:15:37] that's how he felt he felt like he was
[1:15:41] still lacking
[1:15:43] yet he had everything so he went to the
[1:15:47] source of eternal life
[1:15:51] he said lord jesus dico senor jesus
[1:15:54] he said what can i do to inherit eternal
[1:15:56] life
[1:15:59] that's the best question we could ask it
[1:16:04] lord what can i do senor i read my bible
[1:16:08] i'm i'm a good student so you went to
[1:16:10] yante i'm a good worker so you went
[1:16:12] through
[1:16:13] i'm good to my parents this man he
[1:16:16] he didn't he wasn't a bad person
[1:16:21] he didn't live in a crazy family
[1:16:25] he he lived in a good home
[1:16:28] he had everything he wanted yet he was
[1:16:32] lacking
[1:16:36] what can i do to inherit eternal life
[1:16:41] and jesus looked at him jesus and maybe
[1:16:44] he saw him
[1:16:45] with all the potential he could be
[1:16:48] potential he saw his gift
[1:16:54] he saw his calling
[1:16:58] and he spoke to him and he said drop
[1:17:00] everything and come follow me
[1:17:05] and follow me
[1:17:08] but what did he do he was sorrowful
[1:17:12] he was sorrowful turned away from
[1:17:15] eternal life
[1:17:18] and lived his own life and continued to
[1:17:21] get rich
[1:17:24] brother i love the way brother branham
[1:17:26] says the story hermano encanta con el
[1:17:27] amano branam espica esta story because
[1:17:29] he pieces three
[1:17:30] scriptures together
[1:17:34] with the young rich ruler cornell rico
[1:17:36] the one that had the storehouses
[1:17:40] and the one that was in hell
[1:17:48] so then we see the progress of his life
[1:17:54] he see we see that that he
[1:17:58] looks at all of his storehouses
[1:18:03] and he had so much goods and so much
[1:18:05] things
[1:18:08] that all his storehouses were full que
[1:18:10] cadalfolista
[1:18:12] and the bible says in luke 12 19 it says
[1:18:18] he says and i will say to my soul
[1:18:22] so alma thou has much goods laid up for
[1:18:27] many years
[1:18:30] take dines
[1:18:34] drink and be married he was satisfied
[1:18:40] he fulfilled his earthly potential
[1:18:44] potential earthly ambition is good
[1:18:50] but it's so far beneath the god-given
[1:18:53] privileges
[1:18:57] you cannot compare it with eternal life
[1:19:01] it's good to go get money es
[1:19:04] it's good to live a good life it's when
[1:19:06] you don't
[1:19:20] rejected eternal life for it
[1:19:24] and he said that he was satisfied
[1:19:28] he was satisfied with the soul
[1:19:30] satisfaction
[1:19:32] and and when you know what potential is
[1:19:35] is
[1:19:36] potential that means there's more to
[1:19:37] come significa
[1:19:39] but he fulfilled his potential his
[1:19:42] earthly potential
[1:19:44] he said i have everything
[1:19:48] there is no more potential here no i
[1:19:50] must potentially
[1:19:51] there's no more reserved power
[1:19:55] there's no more opportunity
[1:19:58] i'm happy where i'm at on the story
[1:20:04] that's that was his life and we see that
[1:20:08] he was a
[1:20:09] rich man and there was a
[1:20:12] a poor man named lazarus
[1:20:16] that would eat breadcrumbs from his
[1:20:19] table
[1:20:21] and one day god called both of them to
[1:20:24] their
[1:20:25] destination
[1:20:29] and this young rich ruler yes
[1:20:32] job enrico already old gianciano
[1:20:37] looking at himself mirandos and finding
[1:20:41] himself in hell in contra
[1:20:44] what did he do he started to cry out to
[1:20:48] abraham
[1:20:50] abraham abraham his potential begin to
[1:20:54] rise up
[1:20:56] the gift that god called him to
[1:21:22] the call that jesus had given him
[1:22:05] but today tonight the opportunity stands
[1:22:35] there's more holy spirit to come
[1:22:39] there's more whole healing to come
[1:22:42] there's more power to come don't stop at
[1:22:46] where you're at
[1:22:48] don't stop at sanctification
[1:23:04] that desire to want more is there yes
[1:23:09] because that means if there's more
[1:23:18] more foreign
[1:23:22] he want he he wants to be
[1:23:25] evangelist then evangelista
[1:23:28] in hell the call that jesus had given
[1:23:32] him
[1:23:46] and he remembered it then he had five
[1:23:49] brothers
[1:23:51] and back at earth he didn't want them to
[1:23:54] be in that place
[1:23:57] he said lazarus say or he said send
[1:24:01] lazarus
[1:24:03] then back to tell my brothers not to
[1:24:05] come this way
[1:24:09] in other words accept the call and
[1:24:11] follow me
[1:24:14] the
[1:24:28] abraham said nope there's a chasm
[1:24:30] between us
[1:24:34] and there is no way for you to come back
[1:24:40] the calling is now el yamada
[1:24:56] what kind of life can you live for
[1:25:01] are we just happy just living a
[1:25:04] a formal christian life
[1:25:09] so much more power
[1:26:02] maybe because it's not planted in the
[1:26:03] right soil
[1:26:07] maybe it's not in in the specific
[1:26:09] conditions or temperature it should be
[1:26:11] in
[1:26:12] a condition maybe it's the humidity or
[1:26:17] the light
[1:26:17] because a seed can stay
[1:26:21] dormant for thousands of years
[1:26:27] potential can be the same thing
[1:26:30] it can stay dormant for years
[1:26:36] because you're not in the right
[1:26:37] condition
[1:26:40] maybe because the the climate isn't
[1:26:42] right
[1:26:44] maybe something is wrong and it could
[1:26:48] stay
[1:26:48] dormant and maybe we could say well i'm
[1:26:51] a christian
[1:26:53] christian i go to church i pay my tithes
[1:26:56] you're pagoda
[1:26:57] i'm good to my parents i'm good to my
[1:26:59] husband i'm good to my wife
[1:27:23] in the message god who is rich in mercy
[1:27:28] that's the same thing the believer is
[1:27:33] there's something in him when god when
[1:27:35] he meets god
[1:27:37] face to face
[1:27:41] he comes to himself the seed in him
[1:27:46] the seed is in him and it's quickened
[1:27:51] when is the seed in you
[1:27:55] you always were the seed siempre fuiste
[1:27:58] la cemente
[1:28:27] loose it's his watering of the word
[1:28:31] that activates your potential
[1:28:34] potential you know we know that god is
[1:28:38] omnipotent
[1:28:40] omnipotent
[1:29:22] when it was just him all alone all by
[1:29:25] himself
[1:29:28] nobody else no other
[1:29:31] thing that would help him out
[1:29:35] there was no situation that would help
[1:29:50] the sun was created billions of stars
[1:29:54] were
[1:29:55] were spread across the galaxy
[1:29:59] they're moons above planets above moons
[1:30:02] above planets lunas
[1:30:04] planets
[1:30:19] there was nothing to help him but what
[1:30:22] was
[1:30:22] in him was power
[1:30:26] it was out of him came all those things
[1:30:31] and after he created all those things
[1:30:33] all those galaxies
[1:30:37] do you think he was exhausted of power
[1:30:44] do you think he's so okay that's it
[1:30:46] that's
[1:30:51] that star is way too big that that could
[1:30:54] cost
[1:30:54] all my powers
[1:30:59] he's all potential
[1:31:03] that means he said there's more to come
[1:31:05] don't worry
[1:31:08] he created the land he created the
[1:31:10] animals he created
[1:31:12] the the the darkness and the light
[1:31:28] maybe you feel like there's nothing left
[1:31:32] god is all powerful he said hold on
[1:31:35] there's more to come
[1:31:38] there's more in our lives
[1:31:43] don't worry there's more to come no god
[1:31:46] is all potential
[1:31:48] every time god does a work
[1:31:51] there is still more in in the chamber
[1:31:56] there's still more untapped resources
[1:32:01] because he's all powerful he's all
[1:32:05] mighty ellis
[1:32:08] there's a in closing there's a message
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:33:20] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:33:22] que pasa
[1:33:25] when god and man comes together
[1:33:29] two omnipotents something's got to
[1:33:31] change
[1:33:34] something's got to happen whatsoever
[1:33:38] you you'd say with that creative
[1:33:40] creative power of
[1:33:42] omnipotence of god
[1:33:47] whatever you say
[1:34:00] it doesn't matter if you're living in a
[1:34:03] harsh environment
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:06] it doesn't matter if you're sick
[1:34:09] it doesn't matter if you're struggling
[1:34:13] it doesn't matter if you have a habit
[1:34:30] so what happens with two omnipotent
[1:34:32] speeches
[1:34:35] he says he said you say with that
[1:34:38] creative power of omnipotence of god
[1:34:43] knowing that he promised
[1:35:02] it makes them as though they are
[1:35:05] because two omnipotents have met
[1:35:10] he stands oh isn't that wonderful
[1:35:26] uh
[1:35:39] he'll see a glorified body
[1:35:42] glorificator you'll see a child of god
[1:35:46] you show them your mess
[1:35:51] the series isn't nice to look at
[1:36:02] it has all the power to give out fruit
[1:36:06] it has the power to give off eternal
[1:36:08] life
[1:36:36] don't listen to those that say you're
