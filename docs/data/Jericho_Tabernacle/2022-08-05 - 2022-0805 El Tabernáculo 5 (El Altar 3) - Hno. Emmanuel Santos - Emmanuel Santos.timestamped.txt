[32:39] we thank the musicians uh
[32:46] just as we're standing i'd like to open
[32:48] up to the book of isaiah 66
[32:52] 56
[32:54] verse
[33:22] neither let the son of the stranger that
[33:23] hath joined himself to the lord saying
[33:25] the lord hath utterly separated me from
[33:28] his people neither let the eunuch say
[33:30] behold i am a dry tree.
[33:41] for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs
[33:43] that keepeth my s that keep my sabbaths
[33:46] and choose the things that please me and
[33:48] take hold of my covenant
[33:59] for unto them will i give in my house
[34:02] and within my walls a place and a name
[34:04] better than the sons and daughters i
[34:07] will give them an everlasting name that
[34:09] that that shall not be cut off
[34:23] also the sons of the strangers that join
[34:25] themselves to the lord to serve him and
[34:28] to love the name of the lord to be his
[34:30] servants everyone that keepeth the
[34:32] sabbath from polluting it and taketh
[34:34] hold of my covenant
[34:49] even then will i bring to my holy
[34:51] mountain and make them joyful in my
[34:53] house of prayer their burnt offerings
[34:55] and their sacrifices shall be accepted
[34:57] unto mine altar for mine house shall be
[35:00] called a house of prayer for all people
[35:05] there's another scripture i'd like to
[35:07] read in mark 11.
[35:10] verse 15.
[35:38] and they come to jerusalem and jesus
[35:40] went into the temple and began to cast
[35:42] out them that sold and bought in the
[35:44] temple and overthrew the tables of the
[35:46] money changers and the seats of them
[35:48] that sold doves
[35:55] and would not suffer that any man should
[35:57] carry any vessel through the temple
[36:10] and he taught saying unto them is it not
[36:12] written my house shall be called a
[36:14] nation of all nations of the house of
[36:16] prayer but ye have made it its den of
[36:18] thieves
[36:20] may the lord bless you reading of his
[36:21] word
[36:23] you may be seated
[36:52] the one that we taught represents the
[36:53] cross at calvary jesus
[36:56] where jesus died for us
[36:59] then there's another altar
[37:02] that's a golden altar
[37:04] that has incense uh
[37:20] it was in the holy place
[37:24] now tonight we'll continue with the
[37:26] altar
[37:30] like we taught last week
[37:34] in the outer courts
[37:36] there's two furnitures
[37:39] which is the brass altar
[37:42] that speaks about the cross at calvary
[37:44] esta la fuente de bronsen and then
[37:46] there's the brass fountain
[37:52] that speaks about being baptized in the
[37:54] name of his sacrifice
[37:57] of the lord jesus christ
[38:01] and then from the outer courts
[38:05] one can go into the next place which is
[38:07] called the holy place
[38:12] and then there specifically there's
[38:13] three furnitures
[38:16] but the one that we
[38:45] the prophet teaches us that prayer can
[38:47] even change the way god thinks
[38:50] a sincere prayer
[38:53] can reach god
[38:56] it can touch his heart
[39:13] represent justification
[39:15] the holy place represents sanctification
[39:17] represents sanctification
[39:21] and then the holiest of holy represents
[39:25] it represents the baptism of the holy
[39:26] ghost
[39:30] and something that i heard some time ago
[39:32] that i really liked
[39:37] a brother was explaining the different
[39:39] languages of the message
[40:05] you'll find that another theme of the
[40:06] message speaks of the same thing
[40:22] of the holy ghost
[40:26] but we can also say water sangre blood
[40:29] and fire
[40:31] we can translate it
[40:34] to the church
[40:35] to luther wesley wesley
[40:38] and pentecost
[40:42] and all these teams speak of the same
[40:44] thing
[40:48] but through different ways
[41:17] there's a certain way of speaking in
[41:19] english
[41:21] many people make the mistakes
[41:25] of taking the way that you speak in
[41:27] spanish
[41:30] it's the same way you speak in english
[41:34] honestly spanish has its own way of
[41:35] speaking english
[41:38] and english has its own way of speaking
[41:41] in english but if you know how to speak
[41:42] english
[41:46] and you know how to speak of that same
[41:47] theme
[41:48] in espanol in spanish
[41:52] you won't say it the same pero esta
[41:54] hablando de la misma
[41:56] but you're talking about the same thing
[42:00] so then i say that the outer court
[42:02] the holy place
[42:04] and then the holiest of holy ebola is
[42:07] justification and i can say it's
[42:08] justification
[42:10] it's sanctification
[42:12] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:27] it speaks of the same thing
[42:31] because peter said repent
[42:35] and one has to repent in the brass altar
[42:39] that he said you be baptized
[42:55] and that's found in the holiest of holy
[43:14] [Music]
[43:24] that's why the bible says my house is a
[43:25] house of prayers
[43:28] you've got to pray sincerely
[43:36] brother branham says in the message uh
[43:38] god's instructions to gabriel
[43:42] says we type it with ruth ruth de
[43:44] siviendo ruth deciding
[43:49] ruth resting deciding
[43:53] deciding was justification
[43:56] serving and her preparing herself
[43:59] sanctification
[44:04] that's when she had the holy ghost
[44:06] hasta
[44:47] when ruth made her decision
[44:50] you can go back to the bible
[44:55] you can find what she said when she left
[44:56] from moab
[44:59] she said to noah me her mother her
[45:00] mother-in-law
[45:16] me and accepted the new life of nomi of
[45:19] naomi la vida
[45:21] in israel the life in israel
[45:26] ruth went through the tabernacle
[45:30] through
[45:43] the day will come where you reach the
[45:44] brass altar
[45:47] you repent of your sins
[45:51] the day will come when you come to the
[45:52] brass fountain
[45:56] when you're baptized in the name of the
[45:57] lord jesus christ
[46:02] and you'll wait to receive the gift of
[46:04] the holy ghost
[46:06] which is in the holy place
[46:09] but in between that time
[46:25] you also go through those three stages
[46:29] through your actions
[46:33] now what we read in isaiah
[46:36] it speaks about strangers
[46:39] in unix personas
[47:36] they did that with furniture
[47:47] i'd like to read acts 21
[47:50] 26 verse
[48:07] then paul took the men and the next day
[48:09] purifying himself with them entered into
[48:11] the temple to signify the accomplishment
[48:14] of the days of purification until that
[48:16] an offering should be offered for every
[48:18] one of them
[48:29] and when the seven days were almost
[48:31] ended the jews which were of asia when
[48:33] they saw him in the temple stirred up
[48:35] all the people and laid hands on him
[48:45] crying out men of israel help this is
[48:48] the man that teaches all all men
[48:50] everywhere against the people and the
[48:52] law and of the people in the law
[48:55] yes
[49:03] and the law and this place and further
[49:05] brought greeks also unto the temple and
[49:07] have polluted this holy place
[49:12] only jews were allowed here no gentiles
[49:14] not
[49:28] that he would take the gentiles
[49:31] and would take him to his house
[49:34] his house of prayer
[49:40] and originally no one was allowed in
[49:42] there solamente
[49:56] but through our actions
[50:01] now in psalms 5517
[50:10] evening and morning and at noon will i
[50:12] pray and cry loud and he shall hear my
[50:15] voice
[50:19] now at three different times of the day
[50:23] they pray our element
[50:38] altar where the beast's bodies were
[50:39] burnt
[50:42] after the blood was taken
[50:46] every nine o'clock at the morning
[50:49] the 12 o'clock
[50:52] and 3
[50:54] [Music]
[51:10] every jew in palestine fell to his feet
[51:14] and his hands toward heaven
[51:17] and as that smoke ascended up sus
[51:19] horaciones ivan
[51:33] in the morning
[51:34] in
[51:51] because the jewish congregation
[51:56] they were only allowed to enter into the
[51:58] outer court
[52:01] only the priests entered into the holy
[52:03] place
[52:06] and then the high priest entered into
[52:08] the holiest of holi
[52:12] now at these three hours
[52:14] the smoke would arrive
[52:31] we talked about the brass altar
[52:32] representing the crops
[52:35] now in mark 1525
[52:41] it was the third hour and they crucified
[52:43] him
[52:52] and when the sixth hour was come there
[52:54] was darkness over the whole land until
[52:55] the ninth hour
[52:58] now that third
[53:05] these are the same hours we've read in
[53:06] the quote
[53:08] of 9 a.m
[53:10] midday
[53:12] and three in the afternoon
[53:33] so then nine o'clock was the third hour
[53:37] laura
[53:39] the sixth hour
[53:51] remember people were only allowed on the
[53:53] outer courts
[54:09] but here in the scripture in luke 1 5.
[54:13] it talks about a priest that was in the
[54:15] holy place
[54:22] there was in the days of herod the king
[54:24] of judea a certain priest named
[54:26] zacharias
[54:32] of the course of abia and his wife was
[54:34] of the daughters of aaron and her name
[54:36] was elizabeth
[54:43] and it came to pass that while he
[54:45] executed the priest's office before god
[54:47] in the order of his course conformed
[54:57] according to the custom of the priest's
[54:59] office his lot was to was to burn
[55:01] incense when he went into the temple of
[55:03] the lord
[55:21] and the whole multitude of the people
[55:22] were praying
[55:24] at the time of the incidents
[55:29] because the people were only permitted
[55:30] to be in the outer courts
[55:34] but the priest was allowed to enter into
[55:36] the holy place
[55:39] but both do the same thing
[55:42] as the incense arises
[55:44] they're praying
[55:46] laura
[56:00] for you
[56:15] sanctification los atros so the outer
[56:17] courts is justification it's
[56:19] justification
[56:22] the gold altar the sanctification it's
[56:24] sanctification
[56:27] and then the holy spirit is the baptism
[56:29] of the holy ghost
[56:33] let's go to second chronicles chapter 6.
[56:37] verse 12.
[56:40] here's king solomon
[56:44] and he's about to dedicate the temple
[56:46] that he built
[56:49] now just notice the words the bible says
[56:51] this is
[57:00] and he stood before the altar of the
[57:02] lord in the presence of all the
[57:04] congregation of israel and spread forth
[57:06] his hands
[57:10] now like i've already told you the
[57:12] congregation
[57:15] the congregation was only allowed in the
[57:17] outer courts
[57:20] now solomon is in front of the altar el
[57:22] esta ante el altar de bronson
[57:39] for solomon had made a brazen scaffold
[57:41] of five cubits long the cinco codos
[57:44] altura de tres codos five cubits broad
[57:47] and three cubits high ilo via puesto en
[57:49] medio del atrio
[57:52] and he had said it in the midst of the
[57:53] court and stood it and and stood upon it
[57:56] upon it he stood
[57:57] up
[58:02] and he kneeled down upon his knees
[58:04] before all the congregation of israel
[58:05] and spread forth his hands towards
[58:07] heaven
[58:11] and even the bible says that that altar
[58:13] was placed in the outer court
[58:16] and it gives us the measurements of 3
[58:18] and 5.
[58:34] and he gives them the
[58:49] it is cinco codos de antura five cubits
[58:51] abroad
[58:55] and it shall be four square and the
[58:56] height thereof three cubits
[59:01] so that altar where solomon was
[59:04] it was the brass altar
[59:07] it was before the entire people
[59:11] and he started to pray our apart
[59:14] now part of his prayer and secunda
[59:28] there's no god likely in heaven nor in
[59:29] the earth
[59:36] which keep us covenant and show us mercy
[59:38] unto thy servants that walk before thee
[59:40] with all their hearts
[59:43] allah
[59:46] have respect therefore unto the prayer
[59:47] of thy servant and to his supplication
[59:49] all right
[59:52] now just remember that
[59:54] that he said prayer
[59:57] and supplication
[1:00:07] oh lord my god to hearken unto the cry
[1:00:09] and to the prayer which thy servant
[1:00:11] prayeth before thee
[1:00:12] jose
[1:00:22] upon this house day and night upon the
[1:00:24] place where thou has said that thou
[1:00:26] would has put thy name thereof
[1:00:32] to hearken unto the prayer which thy
[1:00:34] servant prayeth toward this place
[1:00:39] hearken therefore unto the supplication
[1:00:41] of thy servant
[1:00:43] and of thy people israel
[1:00:46] so it wasn't just for solomon
[1:00:49] it was also for israel
[1:00:51] it's not just for the minister
[1:00:54] but also for you in the
[1:00:56] testament in the old testament
[1:01:00] god gave an altar for the people
[1:01:03] where the people could see that altar
[1:01:06] and the smoke would arise
[1:01:31] that you would hearken uh the prayer of
[1:01:33] the supplication of thy servant
[1:01:36] and of thy people israel
[1:01:40] which they shall make toward this place
[1:01:44] that you would hear even from heaven
[1:01:47] where thou where thou hearst
[1:02:03] the prayer he made sanctification
[1:02:05] sanctification
[1:02:08] now in second chronicles 7 1.
[1:02:13] now when solomon had made an end of
[1:02:15] praying
[1:02:16] fuego
[1:02:17] fire came down from heaven
[1:02:22] consume the burnt offering and the
[1:02:24] sacrifices
[1:02:28] and the glory of the lord filled the
[1:02:29] house
[1:02:31] los atreus the outer courts
[1:02:35] with the brass altar
[1:02:37] the prayer is sanctification it's
[1:02:39] sanctification
[1:02:41] and then now the third part of the
[1:02:43] spirit the fire of the holy ghost
[1:02:46] is
[1:03:00] praying
[1:03:04] he used the word prayer
[1:03:06] and supplication
[1:03:12] now another scripture in second
[1:03:13] chronicles 5 12.
[1:03:18] now here solomon is with many people
[1:03:22] and he says in verse 12.
[1:03:38] and also the levites which were the
[1:03:40] singers all of them of asaph of hemen of
[1:03:44] judathon and their sons and their
[1:03:46] brethren being arrayed in white linen
[1:03:48] having symbols and salteries and harps
[1:03:51] stood at the east end of the altar
[1:03:57] and with them a hundred and twenty
[1:03:59] priests
[1:04:02] in the past we've shown you okay
[1:04:07] in grace
[1:04:10] is
[1:04:23] when the temple is about to be
[1:04:24] inaugurated
[1:04:28] 120 people that have been born again
[1:04:33] now in acts 113
[1:04:38] pedro
[1:04:40] and when they were coming they went up
[1:04:41] to the upper room where abode both peter
[1:04:44] james and john andres felipe tomas
[1:04:46] bartolome mateo jacobo icho de alfeo
[1:04:50] simon el celote ejudas hermano
[1:04:53] and andrew phillip thomas bartholomew
[1:04:56] and matthew james the son of alphaeus
[1:04:58] and simon zelottis and judas the brother
[1:05:01] of james
[1:05:03] todd
[1:05:11] these all continued with one accord in
[1:05:13] prayer and supplication
[1:05:18] the same two words
[1:05:21] that solomon used
[1:05:23] when he was praying
[1:05:26] at the stage of sanctification
[1:05:31] before the fire of the holy ghost come
[1:05:32] down
[1:05:48] because
[1:06:16] these all continued with one accord in
[1:06:18] prayer and supplication con las mujeres
[1:06:22] jesus
[1:06:23] hermanos with the women and mary the
[1:06:25] mother of jesus and with his brethren
[1:06:30] de los hermanos
[1:06:34] and in those days peter stood up in the
[1:06:35] midst of the disciples and said the
[1:06:38] number of the names together were about
[1:06:39] 120.
[1:06:43] so then what solomon did in the natural
[1:07:14] but to you spiritually
[1:07:17] he's taking you to the different
[1:07:18] furniture
[1:07:20] through his actions
[1:07:23] through the decisions that you make
[1:07:41] ponies
[1:07:42] they put his hands upon it
[1:07:49] the priest cut the throat and he felt
[1:07:51] the bleeding
[1:07:54] and heard the bleeding of it
[1:07:56] and it died
[1:07:59] and he felt its little body stiffened
[1:08:01] out yesterday
[1:08:03] and it was dead
[1:08:06] he know that ought to be him has
[1:08:22] altar
[1:08:24] and the smoke went up
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:28] and it was a prayer of forgiveness
[1:08:33] so in the sacrifice that arises in la
[1:08:35] cruz
[1:08:36] at
[1:08:43] you've got to perform a prayer of
[1:08:45] forgiveness
[1:08:47] it's a prayer of repentance
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:09:29] where you can perform your prayer
[1:09:47] now when all the people were baptized it
[1:09:49] came to pass that jesus also being
[1:09:50] baptized jesus
[1:09:52] jesus was baptized
[1:09:55] justification
[1:09:57] and praying sanctification
[1:09:59] sanctification el
[1:10:07] and the holy ghost ascended in bodily
[1:10:09] shape like a dove upon him
[1:10:12] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:42] he showed us those three stages
[1:10:51] showing that what happened to her in the
[1:10:53] naturals
[1:10:55] is what's going to happen to you in the
[1:10:57] spiritual
[1:10:58] history
[1:11:00] so those stories in the bible
[1:11:02] they've got a purpose
[1:11:05] they're not just stories
[1:11:10] god is speaking something there
[1:11:15] the three stages of grace
[1:11:18] you can change it
[1:11:22] and translate it to another theme
[1:11:24] wesley you can say luther wesley
[1:11:26] pentecost
[1:11:30] decided
[1:11:37] everything speaking of the same thing
[1:12:27] now there was a certain man in kaiseria
[1:12:29] called cornelius a centurion of the band
[1:12:31] called the italian band
[1:12:34] piado
[1:12:42] a devout man and one that feared god
[1:12:44] with all his house which gave much alms
[1:12:46] to the people and prayed to god
[1:12:48] always if you can see
[1:12:53] he already passed justification
[1:12:57] and it says that he prayed to god
[1:13:01] in verse three is
[1:13:07] he saw in a vision evidently about the
[1:13:08] ninth hour of the day
[1:13:14] an angel of god coming into him and
[1:13:16] saying unto him cornelius
[1:13:22] and when he looked on him was afraid and
[1:13:24] said what is it lord
[1:13:28] answer
[1:13:32] and he said unto him thy prayers and
[1:13:33] thine alms or come up for a memorial
[1:13:36] before god cornelius
[1:13:39] cornelius was at the brass altar al aora
[1:13:42] novena at the ninth hour
[1:13:50] that was a custom where at that time the
[1:13:51] smoke would arise
[1:13:54] and it says that his prayers were
[1:13:56] received
[1:13:57] to see importa so it matters
[1:14:10] and now send men to joppa and call for
[1:14:12] one simon whose surname is peter este
[1:14:21] he lodges with one simon a tanner though
[1:14:24] whose house is by the seaside and he
[1:14:26] shall tell thee what thou art to do
[1:14:37] and saw heaven open and a certain vessel
[1:14:39] descending upon him
[1:14:50] four-footed beasts of the earth uh and
[1:14:53] of wild beasts creeping things and the
[1:14:54] fowls of the air
[1:14:56] vino navos levante pedro mata
[1:14:59] and there came a voice to him said rise
[1:15:01] peter kill and eat entonces
[1:15:09] but peter said not so lord for i've
[1:15:11] never eaten anything that is common or
[1:15:13] unclean
[1:15:14] pedro pensoque cornelio now peter
[1:15:17] thought that cornelius era
[1:15:20] he was unclean peraki in the verse
[1:15:28] and the voice spake up unto him again a
[1:15:30] second time lo que dios limpio what god
[1:15:32] hath cleansed
[1:15:35] that can call not thou coming
[1:15:51] and even if for the jews these people
[1:15:52] are unclean
[1:15:54] for god you are clean
[1:16:01] verse 34.
[1:16:05] then peter open his mouth
[1:16:10] instead of a truth i perceive that god
[1:16:12] is no respecter of persons
[1:16:14] criminal god doesn't discriminate
[1:16:17] what he did in the natural with the jews
[1:16:20] he does it now with you in the spiritual
[1:16:25] but in every nation
[1:16:30] he that feareth him and worketh
[1:16:31] righteousness is accepted of him
[1:16:34] just like it says in isaiah
[1:16:38] if the stranger comes and accepts me
[1:16:41] i accept him
[1:16:44] and i'll bring him to my house of prayer
[1:16:58] the holy ghost fell upon all them which
[1:17:00] heard the word
[1:17:06] and they with and they of the
[1:17:08] circumcision which believed were
[1:17:10] astonished
[1:17:12] now the faithful of the circumcision
[1:17:35] this is for unto the gentiles also was
[1:17:37] poured out the gift of the holy ghost
[1:17:43] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:17:44] and magnify god
[1:17:46] entonce respondo pedro then answered
[1:17:49] peter puede a caso alguno in pedire agua
[1:17:53] can any man forbid water parque no san
[1:17:55] bautista
[1:18:00] that these should not be baptized which
[1:18:01] were received with the holy ghost as we
[1:18:03] imagine
[1:18:06] jesus and he commanded them to be
[1:18:08] baptized in the name of the lord our
[1:18:10] alimony
[1:18:18] peter went up onto the house top a few
[1:18:20] days later in donde estaba where he was
[1:18:23] tenia ambre iviona vicion
[1:18:34] while peter yet spake these words
[1:18:38] the holy ghost
[1:18:52] peter said they haven't even been
[1:18:54] baptized yet
[1:18:58] but they had already received the holy
[1:18:59] ghost
[1:19:01] but they were not baptized in water
[1:19:06] because your sincerity abre el camino
[1:19:09] opens the way
[1:19:11] on to the next stage
[1:19:14] just like marcos's wife
[1:19:18] she received the baptism of the holy
[1:19:20] ghost
[1:19:48] without being baptized in water
[1:19:50] especially it is possible
[1:19:54] but we also tell you
[1:19:57] that it's a need
[1:20:00] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:20:02] jesus christ
[1:20:04] we don't take away the baptism of water
[1:20:08] but someone can receive it
[1:20:10] without the water peros
[1:20:13] but repentance is required cornelius
[1:21:09] of whom speaketh the prophet this of
[1:21:11] himself or some other man
[1:21:15] the eunuch
[1:21:18] was fulfilling the prophecy of isaiah
[1:21:22] that if the eunuch would come to my home
[1:21:24] is caminos and follows my footsteps
[1:21:27] the bible says
[1:21:31] you cannot say i am a dry tree an arbor
[1:21:34] represents
[1:21:35] a tree represents a human being
[1:21:38] just like jesus is the tree of life
[1:22:09] he started to preach but there's
[1:22:10] different things
[1:22:13] that a preacher needs to preach la cruz
[1:22:16] the cross
[1:22:17] the baptism
[1:22:20] that there's also a god that can
[1:22:21] sanctify you
[1:22:36] he
[1:22:51] he took him to the second part a la
[1:22:53] fuente de bronser de brass alter the
[1:22:55] brass fountain
[1:22:58] verse 36 says
[1:23:01] and as they went on their way
[1:23:03] to agua they came onto a certain water
[1:23:07] and the eunuch said akihayagua here's
[1:23:09] water
[1:23:13] what does hinder me to be baptized
[1:23:17] if you truly repent
[1:23:33] and philip said
[1:23:36] and if thou if thou believe us with all
[1:23:37] thine heart thou mayest
[1:23:40] christ
[1:23:43] and he answered and said i believe that
[1:23:44] jesus christ is the son of god
[1:23:48] he accepted christ at the brass altar
[1:23:52] emmando para el carro and he commanded
[1:23:54] the chariot to stand still
[1:23:57] agua felipe
[1:23:59] and they went both down and they went
[1:24:01] down both into the water
[1:24:04] and was bad and he baptized him
[1:24:09] and when they were come up out of the
[1:24:10] water the spirit of the lord caught away
[1:24:12] philip
[1:24:17] and the eunuch saw him no more and he
[1:24:18] went on his way rejoicing
[1:24:22] because philip already fulfilled what he
[1:24:24] needed to do
[1:24:27] god took care of what pertained to him
[1:24:30] so give him the joy
[1:24:33] of the holy ghost
[1:24:39] so you can see that that tabernacle
[1:24:42] it's
[1:25:23] you go through those different
[1:25:24] furnitures
[1:25:28] now with the brass altar
[1:25:31] they would pray three times a day
[1:25:33] in the morning
[1:25:34] midday
[1:25:36] and in the afternoon
[1:25:51] it says in second chronicles 6 22.
[1:25:57] now here's solomon he's dedicating the
[1:25:59] temple
[1:26:01] in sanctification and now here he's
[1:26:03] praying and sanctification
[1:26:05] he says
[1:26:17] to make him swear an oath and come
[1:26:19] before an altar in this house
[1:26:34] by recompensing his way upon his own
[1:26:36] head
[1:26:38] and by justifying the righteous
[1:26:42] by giving him according to his
[1:26:49] and if the righteousness of israel be
[1:26:50] put to be put to the worst before the
[1:26:52] enemy because they have sinned against
[1:26:54] thee
[1:26:57] and shall return
[1:26:59] and confess thy
[1:27:02] name and pray and make supplication
[1:27:05] before thee in this house
[1:27:08] from the heavens
[1:27:11] and forgive the sins of thy people
[1:27:17] and bring them again unto the land which
[1:27:18] thou gives them and to their fathers
[1:27:22] and if the heavens is shut up
[1:27:25] there's no rain
[1:27:27] because they have sinned against thee
[1:27:30] now pay attention to this part here
[1:27:36] if yet if they pray toward this place
[1:27:41] and confess thy name
[1:27:58] god would
[1:28:12] his childhood he was taken unto babylon
[1:28:17] even in babylon he served god in daniel
[1:28:19] says they're in daniel 6 10.
[1:28:24] now remember the three hours that we
[1:28:25] mentioned
[1:28:42] and his windows being opened in the
[1:28:43] chamber toward jerusalem
[1:28:48] he kneeled upon his knees three times a
[1:28:50] day
[1:28:55] and prayed and gave and thanked god
[1:28:58] and gave thanks before his god as he did
[1:29:00] of four times
[1:29:02] now didn't matter where they were
[1:29:07] if they prayed towards jerusalem
[1:29:46] but you need a prophet to reveal to you
[1:29:47] what is that symbol
[1:29:50] now
[1:30:09] and another angel came and stood at the
[1:30:11] altar having a golden censer and there
[1:30:13] was given unto him much incense that he
[1:30:15] should have fought he should offer it
[1:30:17] with the prayers of all the saints upon
[1:30:19] the golden altar which was before the
[1:30:21] throne alright
[1:30:25] now the the gold altar of incense
[1:30:30] is also called a sensor of gold
[1:30:47] it's in the form of a symbol
[1:30:54] now something that i found that was just
[1:30:55] so interesting to me
[1:30:59] paul begins to speak about the
[1:31:00] tabernacle
[1:31:03] in hebrews 9.
[1:31:08] now you remember that i mentioned
[1:31:11] that in the outer courts
[1:31:14] there's two furnitures
[1:31:16] the brass altar
[1:31:19] and then the brass fountain
[1:31:22] and then in the holy place
[1:31:25] there are three furnitures
[1:31:28] one is a table pan it has bread
[1:31:32] another one is is a candle uh candles
[1:31:35] candlestick candlestick
[1:31:39] and then the gold altar yes
[1:31:42] and that gold altar
[1:31:44] it's in the holy place
[1:31:48] now just see what paul says here
[1:31:56] then verily the first covenant all had
[1:31:58] also ordinances of divine service and a
[1:32:00] worldly sanctuary
[1:32:05] for there was a tabernacle made
[1:32:10] the first place it was called the holy
[1:32:12] place
[1:32:14] that was the candlestick
[1:32:18] and the table and the show bread
[1:32:20] which is also called the sanctuary aura
[1:32:25] now it says there that is the holy place
[1:32:29] now it only mentions two furnitures
[1:32:33] it doesn't mention the gold altar no
[1:32:35] mention
[1:32:37] it doesn't mention the golden censor
[1:32:41] but now in verse 3
[1:32:48] and after the second veil the tabernacle
[1:32:50] which is called the holiest of all our
[1:32:55] now look what the first furniture is
[1:33:01] which had the golden censor a caso pablo
[1:33:04] cometh
[1:33:05] did paul make a mistake
[1:33:21] now it's in the holiest of holy porque
[1:33:22] cambio why did it change
[1:33:27] remember that in the brass altar
[1:33:30] in the outer courts
[1:33:33] out there the people would pray in the
[1:33:48] and for the priesthood
[1:34:17] [Music]
[1:34:27] where is the sacrifice for sin laying
[1:34:29] then el cordero
[1:34:38] there has to be a place where the slain
[1:34:40] lamb bloody don de la sangre where the
[1:34:42] blood
[1:34:47] now the instance was the odors the
[1:34:48] odorous stuff that they burned
[1:34:54] which the bible said was the prayers of
[1:34:56] the saints
[1:34:57] sacrificious
[1:35:38] it's in the form of a symbol
[1:35:51] and we pray in the name of the lord
[1:35:53] jesus christ
[1:36:08] when you think about the lamb
[1:36:11] in a persona you think of a person no
[1:36:14] you don't think of an animal
[1:36:16] you think of jesus christ
[1:36:19] you think of your savior
[1:36:20] your redeemer
[1:36:38] when jesus ascended to heaven
[1:36:42] that is the holiest of holy jesus
[1:36:46] and jesus is the high priest
[1:36:49] and the high priest
[1:36:53] is the one that entered into the holiest
[1:36:54] of holy jesus
[1:36:56] jesus is there
[1:36:59] high priest
[1:37:01] in a symbolic form
[1:37:04] as
[1:37:15] it doesn't matter where you are
[1:37:46] is part right now
[1:37:48] of a high priest
[1:37:52] interceding on behalf of your prayers
[1:37:56] behalf of your confessions
[1:38:00] because the
[1:38:42] stand
[1:39:11] to jesus christ
[1:39:14] the high priest
[1:39:18] the one that intercedes on behalf of
[1:39:19] your prayers
[1:39:22] but you've got to fulfill the part
[1:39:52] is
[1:39:55] and has been baptized in the name of the
[1:39:56] lord jesus christ
[1:39:59] but yet does not have the holy ghost
[1:40:02] we can pray
[1:40:04] and through prayer
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:39] we thank you for all of this in the name
[1:40:40] of the lord jesus christ
