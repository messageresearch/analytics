let's do uh chapter 4 and verse [Music] 17 let's just remember to keep our our pastor in prayer and sister Elsa in [Music] prayer as they go over there for some family matters in in El Paso and I believe he'll be ministering um this Sunday also so let's just keep him in prayer as he he's out there the Bible says for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of [Music] [Music] God let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord first of all we just want to thank you Lord for allowing us to be

that you may help us Lord for we are a needy people Lord we we give it all unto you we ask that you take control of this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen amen you may be seated I want to thank the musicians it's um just a beautiful atmosphere that that can be created just by our worship amen you know sometimes I just like listening to brother brandham tapes of just him singing and just that simple music can bring down the presence of God wherever I'm at because it's not how how how great we sing but it's the heart behind that singing um so I I want to um just speak a few few minutes and my title this this evening is uh the house of judgment that sounds like a very um maybe a harsh title but this scripture it it it says a lot here in verse 17 Peter he he's talking about suffering in in the previous verses and he's telling the church let nobody suffer as a murmurer as an evildoer as a thief as a busy body don't be suffering for those kind of causes because if I would like to say this that kind of suffering it's warranted but but then he says but if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed let him glorify on go in God's behalf because you're suffering as a Christian and then in in verse 17 he says for before the time is come that the Judgment must begin at the house of God and he says and if it first begins at us what shall the end be so I realize that judgment it has a a process that there is a beginning and an end to to judgment it first it starts at the house of God then he asks this question where will the end be and in Revelations we see the end of judgment Revelations 20 and verse 11 where John he said says I saw a great white throne and him that sat on him from whose face the Earth and Heaven fled away and there was no uh there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open another book was open which was the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead in the dead which were in it and the uh and death and hell were delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works that is the end of judgment he said judgment begins at the house of God but the end what shall it be it is the white throne judgment where people are going to be judged by their Works Paul says you are not saved by works but by Grace you are saved through faith not of yourselves lest you should boast but it is a gift of God I don't want to be there in that great day of judgment I don't want to be standing there being judged by what I did because all of these scary things that the world tries to offer the the the way the world says how scary the devil is there there is no fear so great as the fear of the Lord that the the um the Bible says it says Don't Fear the ones that kill the body but fear the one that can kill body and soul and is able to destroy the the soul and the body in hell that is the white Throne judgment that is somewhere that no man no woman would would want to stand there I remember in my early years I would hear people say oh well if I'm not the bride at least I I'll be the fullish virgin what what an ignorant statement to say that we nobody want should ever want to stand the Judgment of God to stand there before Jesus Christ where brother brandham says that his his his uh uh hair was like like uh snow and his eyes were like flames of fire that was the great judge he said that same those same eyes that were once dimmed with tears that once cried for his friend that died knowing that he had all the power of Eternity in him yet he still cried for those that he loved and after a few minutes he said Lazarus come out of there brother Bram says if he wouldn't have said his name and he would have just said come out all of the graves would have came came out now you have this same person this same Jesus Christ that we know in love with eyes as fire that is looking the Bible says throughout the the Sea and the Earth and all of the earth is trying to flee away from this vision and then he speaks he says come out of there and the the earth and the Sea give up the grave and give up the dead that same Jesus Christ in the white Throne judgment judging us by our work there there there will not be any attorney there to to plead our case there won't be anybody there to say to to die for our sins that's that is a reality that's not something well well brother you shouldn't say those things that's what's going to happen and by grace we are here today but there is going to be a day that that is going to happen that is the end of judgment that is the finality of everything but where did this judgment this great terrible judgment begin it says it begins at the house of God there was one time where David he sinned it's a very strange sin that he did he took a senses of the people and for some reason that that caused Israel to sin and go and God he came down and he says I'll give you three choices you are going to have to pay for your sin he says you either have three years of famine in Israel in is in Judah in or you have three months uh of of uh turmoil or tribulation with the sword or you'll have three days of plagues that the angel of the Lord will pour out now these are judgments that the Lord is giving to his child now now judgment starts at the house of God let me say it this way judgment starts at God's house go judgment starts at God's family the ones he loves and he says David you have to pick out of these three judgments David began to think he said if we have famine somebody caused by man if we go by the sword it's going to be under the man but plagues that poured out by the angel of the Lord that is your judgment Lord he said Lord give me the plagues because under your hand of judgment you have far more mercy on me by your judgment I don't want to fall under the Judgment of man I don't want to fall under the Judgment of anything else but your judgment Lord and that's what that is when we come to the house of the Lord we don't come to to preach good message or a message about myself to promote anything but when when somebody comes they have to preach the word of God for our benefit for our edification so that we can be better so that I can be better and it starts here in this place brother Bram says in the message how can I overcome but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose I just highlighted that in my tablet real quick we are here for a specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment goes out Goes Forth from the house of God now it sounds pretty harsh but listen to what brother says here and here is where we come together Where We Gather in Envy no no Where We Gather in hate Where We Gather in judgment Where We Gather in love with one another as only Christians can love this is a love not anybody can love only Christians can love this way but in here we are under a leadership of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is Among Us that's what I want that's what I believe we have the Holy Ghost is among us there is no big eyes and little yous there is no greater than another the great one is the holy spirit here that's why we're here gathered in one Accord in love why the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is Among Us and here to be to take a reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcoming and how we can catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for their people when when they see the people the lack then they begin on that now this is here listen to the brother brandham says here now soon I think that the church maybe is taking just a little step higher at this time there there's a steps and steps that we go higher and higher with the Lord he says this is the time where we're taking another step now we brother Bram says there is a specific purpose why we're here in this church we come to worship we come to give him the honor and the glory we we we come here assembled together for the purpose of coming to the throne the Judgment throne but Brothers I love this judgment this judgment is full of grace this judgment is full of of Glory knowing that every time I'm judged by his word I I change through the Holy Spirit I become better and better because of the word word that is being preached out I have a greater Revelation when I get to worship my lord it's uh such a beautiful thing brother brandham he says in the mark of the beast he says as down through the age here at the Tabernacle regardless of of what people thought I've tried to stay straight on the scripture I love people but sometimes you have to hurt them because the church is the house of correction the Judgment seat of God is at the church now now was tapes that brother brandham didn't want published because it was only to the Tabernacle that that he he went and he preached it whether how hard it was or how much Revelation he had he said I didn't want that to go out to the General Public and sometimes the things that he would even say he said that even the people at the Tabernacle wouldn't understand he said he would say things under the anointing under the unction of the holy spirit that he wouldn't even dare telling them off of the pulpit and we know that that was the power of the Holy Spirit now now maybe many might disagree with me but when I read the book of Acts I saw how a church should be that a church isn't covered by four walls in fact they probably didn't have a church for years that yeah they didn't have a building they would go from home to home to home and as they would go there they would preach and the Holy Spirit would come down wherever they were because they were the church and then nicoladis begin to put people above others creating these great big Cathedrals making priests and and other offices to be over people so that they can conquer the people but but in reality the book of Acts is the rawest form in the perfect Church brother Bram says but the prophet he came through this way to stand behind the pulpit to go throughout the Nations stand behind brothers pulpits be under their their order so that he could preach the unadulterated truth and through that through that way he was able to save millions and bring people to Christ and we hear it on the tapes we could see it in the video as the sisters would come by right next to the pulpit and he began to discern their thoughts through the Holy Spirit God began to use this form and he blessed the prophet through that and today that's where we're at today where we assemble together the Bible says forsake not to assemble ourselves together this this is somewhere where we can come and this should be a a warm place from the coldness of the world you know when I was a child I would uh have have dreams and and and I wasn't living a right life so I would always have a dream of me being outside of a building and you could see people smiling and and happy and there's a warmth inside that building and I couldn't get in I couldn't get in and would try and I would try but I couldn't get in and I realized that that is the warmth of Fellowship amongst Believers that out in the world people are going insane brother brandham says the world has become insane but the reason why the young people are good upstanding young people may maybe they make mistakes here and there but the reason why that they're living a better life than those that are out there they're under the protection of their their family and the community and the church under under the protection of the holy spirit this this is where the protection is the world is going to flood their mind with a bunch of ideas with a bunch of trash but here is where we can listen to the unadulterated word that is going to save their souls and take them out take them out from a pitiful condition take them out of of a lying condition take them out of a a druggy condition and place them into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in a warm place like this with brothers and sisters with love loving one another that is the place this is this is not a routine it it can become routine we can make it routine and we can make it of none effect just like as as the the priest would come and and and uh sacrifice the lamb all the first time they're shaking I I don't know if anybody's ever killed an animal if you've ever hunted or something like that or or you grew up in a farm but the first time you're shaking like this uhuh when I when I when I killed my first animal I I felt bad cuz that poor thing was trying to survive but you're there trying to thank you Lord for the food I had to justify myself IM imagine the priest this little lamb that they've raised for years it was the perfect lamb all the other ones had a bigger ear here a bigger eye there a black spot there but this perfect lamb here this perfect one they brought it up here to The Altar and they began to know that all of their sins all of their transgressions we're going to go upon this little lamb here and they pulled his neck and started to chop and they say thank you Lord thank you forgiving me for my for for forgiving me of my sins thank you Lord and then them them full of blood knowing that the price has been paid oh they were shaking they felt the feeling of death there but year after year after year begin to pass where it began to become a routine to where they didn't care anymore that they knew they could sin all year knowing that they can go there slaughter a lamb and go on to their lives brother brandham said the Bible declares that this is the house of judgment and there is an altar where a lamb has been slain and the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit where we couldn't touch that Holy Spirit we couldn't even stand by it without dying but now we can come here boldly now we can come here and praise inside this shakina glory and get our sacrifice of praise and say Lord thank you Lord I was full of sin Lord father today I messed up Lord today I fell But Here I Come Again Lord knowing that he will cover your sins that's what this place is this is a sanctuary this is a refuge for those that are in need for those that that need something from the Lord that no man can satisfy it could be satisfied with the spirit of the Lord here brothers sisters I'll take that judgment any day if God's got something against me Lord tell me Lord Lord if there's a judgment I have to pick Lord I'll pick your judgment any day Lord knowing it's full of grace and full of Glory Full of Mercy he says he says says the Judgment seat is at the church and then in the token he says this he says let me say this to you my Christian friend our attorney is also our judge see we're under judgment today the bride is under judgment today but I have good news that that same judge that is going to judge you tonight he's also your attorney he's also the one that's going to pull you out he says our judge became our eternity attorney the case is settled when you receive his pardon the judge himself came down and became our the attorney and the attorney and the judge is the same person God became man that he may justify Man by his own death that he placed upon him and in Hebrews 4:12 4:12 to16 I want to read all these Scriptures it says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and a discerner of the thoughts and the intent of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him who of of him who we do to or we have to do to this Every Creature they're all manifest in his sight it reminds me of of Revelations where is it says his eyes were as flame as fire and that he looked throughout the sea in the earth and the sea in the Earth would flee from him there's nothing that can flee his sight he's here looking today but in verse 14 see what he says we're not dealing with the judge with eyes of flame of fire he says seeing that we have a great high priest that's who we're dealing with today that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the filling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin so how should we come to this house of judgment how should we come to to this this Throne he said let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need that's that's where we come that that's why we have reverence in this place not because U somebody's name is on it not not because it's it's so so and so Church no because this is where we meet God I I can say that many many of you are with God daily every day but then there's some people that sometimes don't have time for God sometimes a sinner will come in sometimes a backslider comes in and he's he or she has been outside of the presence of God they need that correct atmosphere and that atmosphere is the Holy Spirit and and that judge will judge their lives he it will be the only one that judges it's the word the Bible says the word that is sharper than any two-edged sword it'll discern our thoughts it'll discern our hearts our motives if they're right or the wrong see see man is not the discern Brothers I can't judge anybody I I can't I you know what I've realized that the human being they're so quick to condemn it's easier to condemn somebody we don't like and and have Grace for the ones that we do like even though they do the same transgression and so so we can't handle the Judgment we leave that judgment to God you know what I've realized about this thing here this is the word of God this is the sword this is the greatest weapon ever the a great what do they call it uh weapon of mass D destruction this weapon and people might say well it's just a book it's just a Bible this is greater than a a nuclear bomb you know if it this is put in the wrong hands look at what what happened with the Catholic church in in the Dark Ages they grabbed this book they they took it from all of the people all of the the uh common people and and only the priest could keep it and they used this word to put people into purgatory or take them out many many people had Crusaders killed many people because of this word Nations have been conquered because of this Bible there has been Wars started because of this word because they misused the word but when the word is is unadulterated when the word is is comes out perfect and correctly when you live the word righteously it brings forth life it br brings forth eternal life it'll save that backslider child you have it'll heal that person that is bedridden it'll give you the Holy Ghost if you use this word correctly life will come forth out of it this word and God uses this word to judge his people so I I I think God for that I thank God for those things and if if there's a a straggler that comes in somebody that that's maybe not living the life here somebody that that's that keeps falling behind well it it's it's not my job to judge that person I don't know who that person is I don't know what God's going to do with them I know they're not living the word I know they can't overcome maybe their habits or the sins but but I do know this that that Jesus he says that there was one time there was a s that sowed good seed and at night there became a bad s an enemy and he sowed Bad Seed in that same place and whenever his servants saw that he saw the the wheat and the weeds begin to grow together he they said look it look it Master look at I have the weeds and the wheat growing together allow us to pull it out and and the good s said he said don't pull the weed the weeds out because if you tried to pull pull the weeds out you you have harm of pulling the wheat out also and what I realize there is we don't have the authority so who to say who's a wheat and who's a weed well well hey I I know that person that that's a weed for sure I'm just a servant I'm Just a Nobody and the Lord says don't do it because that might be a potential wheat that is my child there they might look like a weed they they might look like a sinner they might look like a backslider but watch what I do watch my power I'm going to change that person just like Paul they might have to suffer they might have to go through a few things but I'm going to give them my Holy Spirit I'm going to give them overcoming power don't pull it don't condemn him don't condemn her because we don't know what the Lord is going to do with them and if we could stand and the musicians can come our job is only to create an atmosphere that's it if we can only create an atmosphere brother Bram says that's where birth is he he said the chicken is not the one that that Hatches the Egg out he says you can take that same egg and put it under a light and that hatch will crack no matter what or I mean that that egg will crack no matter what why it's the atmosphere we give and and as we come here into the house of God because was a commandment to not forsake to assemble together Lord I I take all my thoughts away all of my judgments all of my burdens that were from work all of the things that I'm struggling with Lord I put it aside and I fulfill your word it says I give you the sacrifice of my praise and whenever I do that I begin to create an atmosphere not knowing that there's somebody next to me that that is on the edge of committing suicide on the edge of turning back to the World on the edge of doing drugs again on the edge of not believing this word Lord let me create this atmosphere so that he will know that she will know that God is real that it's not a bunch of emotions but he's everywhere he's there he's there he's everywhere but but we create that atmosphere we create it and whether there's a disbelieving spirit it will go away because God is here he's here let us bow our heads oh Heavenly Father Lord I ask that you just touch each and every person father Lord if there's any contrary Spirit father lord lord it's it's it's not on the person father Lord they were born that way Lord they came out of the world that way father but I ask that you deliver that father deliver them from those things deliver them from unbelief and show them how real you are father that your word your word can be manifested in their lives that it's just not something that we hear Lord but father something we can act out father I commit each and every person into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen amen [Applause] amen the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love great is the measure of Our Father's Love think about about his love
