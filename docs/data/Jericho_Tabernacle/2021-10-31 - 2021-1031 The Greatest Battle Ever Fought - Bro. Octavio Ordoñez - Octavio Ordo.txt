your word is the truth nowhere else for us to [Music] and we have [Music] they must retreat [Music] amen [Music] try and settle down a little bit thank the musicians uh last week we had a tremendous

bring uh bring uh the spirit of the lord with their help we were able to bring an atmosphere of worship and of love they're here on thursday or thursday for practice we're here for every service yes as you can see they're working on trying to get better sound come on their instruments instruments so we appreciate the musicians they've done a good job and we really do appreciate that there's quite a few of them that do the job from the song leaders the song special specialist [Music] amen we also had a really good uh communion night [Music] it was such a nice atmosphere so we thank everyone for for their participation in communion night participation amen if we're going to speak a little bit i would like to speak a little bit about about what's going on in the world today si caso podemos [Music] well just a footnote here our president he went to see the pope this this halloween weekend remember who was the first one it was president kennedy president kennedy now this is a short note here he's the 12th president to meet with the pope since america accepted the catholic church just another note if something happens to him and we end up with a woman president president and she goes to visit the pope i i thought that was really interesting the 13th she would be the 13th president to visit the pope and we know that 13 is the number where in the bible revelations chapter 13. we're a woman's national i have some notes here but i'll just skip through them i have something that's really interesting also the fifth church the sardis sarditian or fifth church has lasted from 15 20 to 1750. uh what were the dates again 15 20 to 1750. they draw i got this from the the blue book of the church ages position i actually got it from the internet but it's you can find it in the blue book and this is how it's how it started thus when leo the tenth became pope and john tetzel came to sell indulgences for sin luther had no choice but to rise up against this anti-scriptural teaching entonces second first he thundered from the pulpit against it and then he wrote his famous 95 theses which on october 31st 7 1517 he knelt to the door of castle church now martin luther himself was a sensitive spirit-filled christian he was definitely a man of the word for he not only had a profound passion to study it but to make it available to all in order that all might live by it our martin luther old he translated the new testament and gave it to the people his laborers work he did himself correcting a passages a passage as much as 20 times he gathered around him a group of hebrew scholars amongst whom were jews and translated the old testament group this monumental work of luther is still the work upon which all successive works of the scripture in germany have rested he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith amen surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from faith to faith his marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination another truth show him to be a great man in the word yet i say again as do historians god used him to bring to the people god's standard against works [Music] the just shall live by faith it's it's a reformation age it's let's start it on this day in amen uh if if it would be okay with you could you please stand so we can read another scripture to honor the lord by reading his word [Music] the book of daniel chapter 12 verse one and just think about it and then we'll go into the message we know that the word of god sometimes has double meaning it'll fulfill itself time and time again let's listen to this message and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered and every one shall be found written in the book tiempos grand principe libra and many of them that sleep in the dust of the air shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise and shall shine and they that be wise shall shine as a brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever lost but thou o day o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shalt be increased the night daniel looked and behold there's still other two one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on the side of the bank of the river is and one said to the man clothed in linen which is upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders is and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swore by him that liveth forever that it shall be for a time times and a half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished [Music] we'll be uh paraphrasing some comments of brother branham vamos a para franciara algunos de los comentarios the greatest battle ever fought tremendous message is a two and a half hour message so i would recommend that you go back home and hear it a few times we just can't do any justice to the message by just speaking about it for a few minutes there's nothing out of place in heaven the earth is in its place if the moon won't move away from the earth if the moon will get out of its position the moon will get out of his post of duty the world will be ruined how important is your post of duty juan importante how important is everybody's post of duty we stand in our place [Music] the devil has to flee el diablo wearing the same same thoughts to go forward to stick with the word then anything can happen entrance is [Music] you'll find where you should in your post of duty in support the devil comes around we come against them [Music] let's start reading from line forty nine boy and i thought then if that great heavenly host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the earthly host says how when one gets out of order how it throws a whole thing out of caterpillar the whole program of god is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to we shall we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit guard i would to god this morning that we would bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this part group that we have gathered under the roof this morning in such a harmony that the holy spirit will place every member of the body that's here this morning in such a harmony so there will be no that there will be such a spontaneous healing of the soul and body if we would just hold our positions um and that is the power of life and the power of death now that's only two powers yes there's only two powers solo of harm and satan can only his power he's got is the perverted power of god it isn't no real it's a perversion of god's power everything that satan has death is the is only a perverted life a lie is only the truth mistold see adultery is a act misused a righteous act misused see everything that satan has got this something that was perverted but it's a power una mentira is is and we are today sitting here and one or the other power is going to control us our nosotros aqui centas so one or the other as the bible speaks wandering stars over in the book of jude foaming out their own shame and we don't want to be wandering stars wonder if this is right wonder if that's right wonder if it will happen wonder if how it could be don't wonder stay like those stars and of heaven as a real soldier at his post of duty standing there believing life and death is when i see the deacons at the door or the ushers puerto i know everything's going to be all right they're protecting our door they're at their post of duty that's how important it is to be at your post of duty is decisions are made in the mind the head there is where satan meets you and the decisions are being are because that god made amen that way once again decisions are made in the mind the head there is where satan meets you and the decisions are because that god made man that way amen you know i've had some uh personal testimony here uh i i've had a privilege to work in some uh places where people have tried i think i mentioned this before i i've tried to commit suicide or or drugs and things like that is when i tell this to the people that are trying to do you know kill themselves or or whatever they're trying to do even take drugs when i tell them that the fight is in the mind and everyone has that fight you have a good thought and you have a bathtub it's all in your head and when i've told that to people that have never heard it and they think they're the only ones that have that problem hearing different thoughts in their head everyone has but we've been taught to know the difference those thoughts are allowed to come into our minds but it's up to you and just that's what i like people when they tell me yes i'm going to do this i take them afterwards lost is [Music] amen if this church right now could put together and knit it together with such that every person will be in one accord with not one shadow of doubt anywhere esta glacial nobody here desiring the holy ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will eyes on the comments amen but your mind accepts it it grabs it what's what is your mind controlled by your spirit is and your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it it is oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that shadow into you the word of god is manifested if you abide in me and my words are abiding you then ask what you will and it will be done for you that's john 15 7. this is juan quince then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from there goes forth feeding every shadow center the trouble is the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of doubts trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that channel with the true word of god and then it goes out itself automatically automatically it's what the what on the inside that's the thing that counts is in the inside get bad thoughts what's in your heart and there's only one avenue that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency what direction you're going to take direction tomorrow free moral agency a liberal video what role are you going to take as a man think is in his heart let me backtrack a little bit free moral agency come into the soul by your thoughts as a man think it in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said yes [Music] there you are see there's a battlegrounds if you'd only get that started first yes it's not affection it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of god becomes a reality then every senses of the soul and body is just scored out with the holy spirit then your senses of god your conscience of god everything that's gotten me flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can raise up oh man entonces amen there's nothing that can come out against of holy ghost-filled christians but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory no matter about miss jones and what she did is it's you [Music] how long you can make the war linger it stop it right now gonna be hey brother don't you know this and this and stop it in this track hermano it at its tracks amen you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say god your word is eternal and true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet i can't fail because i'm taking you at your words no matter if 10 000 died on the side today trusting ten thousand died on that side tomorrow trusting that has nothing to do with me i'm the individual i'm the one that's believing in this word not about anyone else i'm the one that's trusting i'm the one that believes it and we see back yonder if we wanted to open up the our channels then if we can and see we find this one and that one and this one and that one thousands of them testifying i wonder if we could go behind the curtain of time and talk to our past friends our loved ones who have gone through i have friends that have gone how is it out there just a thought but the devil will try to come right back see if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed absolutely that's why it's important for everyone to be in their post of duty foreign [Music] there's your battleground the battle your battleground is back here in the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that's opens is the mind is a gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit you can have you can have little consciences and little feelings and little sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends la puerta is see it's in your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes us up to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out effect every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against them yes no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true see you don't reason with the word you know who reasoned with the word she reasoned with the word she the word says i like this quote we just accept the word upon the basis we just accept the word upon the basis it sets a stream between you and god exists just about done here yeah like i said this is just a little bit of what brother abraham preaches on this message if you would go back and listen to it i'm sure you'll be blessed from hearing it help your faith i won't get into it but i i think i believe things are going to get harder [Music] amen just have a few closing comments here i'll just skip a lot of the message here i like this last part brother brown talks about megusa is see if i can find it see one day we're going to get to the other side i'll read it to you it sounds it'll sound much better we are predestinated we are predestined a royal seed of abraham when abraham denied everything that was against god's word he chopped his way through right through every obstacle that could come in front of him when shot the thing out of the way the devil said you can't do this you can't do that abraham shopped it out of the way move your tent up here he went up and built him an altar up there he got up there and satan come say no i'll tell you this is not the right place he said he said i'll stay right here get off you better come down here we're having a good time down here we all got our organization down here why my wife is head of the literacy society and everything else in the city i tell you you ought to come down here this is where god placed me right here is where i stand hey man even death itself everything else is sinking sand on christ the solid rock i stand is the royal seat of abraham the royal seat why english most selected army is the royalty of england royal blood everything and the royal seed of christ is the holy ghost built church our las cemente real de abram las cementes and the royal seed of christ is the holy ghost filled church filled with the holy ghost what the royals see by the promise not by sensations but by the promise of god they stand by the word of god and chop their way through screaming even death comes and says i'm coming up your sleeve say give away jordan i'm crossing over you said what happens when the battle is all over sure enough when the battle is all over and the saints come marching home i want to ask you something

we start walking down through those paradise of god and the angels spilling the air with anthems above like talk about a celebration entonces and when the battle is over we shall wear a crown soldiers of the cross this morning pull that arm of faith out there and get a hold of this weapon [Music] james 5 15. santiago and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if
