[58:21] to go to a
[58:24] scripture in
[58:26] it's in Obadiah
[58:29] 1 uh verse
[58:46] one and it
[58:55] reads
[59:02] the vision of Obadiah thus saith the
[59:04] Lord God concerning Edom we have heard a
[59:07] rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is
[59:09] sent among the Heathen arise ye and let
[59:11] us rise up against her in
[59:18] battle behold I have made thee small
[59:21] among the Heathen Thou Art greatly
[59:25] despised
[59:35] the pride of thine heart hath deceived
[59:37] thee thou that dwellest in the clefts of
[59:39] the Rocks whose habitation is high that
[59:41] saith in his heart who shall bring me
[59:43] down to the
[59:47] [Music]
[59:50] ground though thou exalt thyself as the
[59:53] eagle and thou that set the nest among
[59:55] the stars then will I bring thee down
[59:58] sayeth the
[1:00:10] Lord if thieves came to thee if robbers
[1:00:13] by Night how art thou cut off would they
[1:00:16] would they not have stolen till they had
[1:00:18] enough if the grape gatherers come to
[1:00:21] thee they would they not leave some
[1:00:24] grapes
[1:00:30] how are the things of Esau searched out
[1:00:33] how are how are his hidden things sought
[1:00:48] up all the men of thy Confederacy have
[1:00:51] brought thee even to the border the men
[1:00:54] that were at peace with thee haveed deed
[1:00:56] thee and prevailed against thee they
[1:00:58] that eat the bread have laid laid a
[1:01:00] wound under the tree under thee there is
[1:01:03] none un there is none understanding in
[1:01:11] him shall I not in that day sayith the
[1:01:13] Lord even destroy the wise men out of
[1:01:15] Edom and understanding out of the Mount
[1:01:18] of
[1:01:18] Esau
[1:01:20] okay may the Lord bless the reading of
[1:01:22] his word you may be
[1:01:24] seated we also thank the
[1:01:32] musicians
[1:01:34] um this
[1:01:39] morning I'd like to take the theme that
[1:01:41] I mentioned last
[1:01:43] week of the flying
[1:01:50] saucers I'd also like to mention that
[1:01:52] this week is a very special
[1:01:54] week
[1:01:56] for those that know this was the
[1:01:59] week when brother Brandon preached the
[1:02:01] Seven
[1:02:03] Seals he preached it from Sunday to
[1:02:09] Sunday from March 17th up to today the
[1:02:12] 24th of
[1:02:15] March so the 24th which is
[1:02:19] today he preached questions and answers
[1:02:22] on the
[1:02:23] seals and then he preached the seventh
[1:02:25] SE
[1:02:28] so what I'd like to do this
[1:02:31] morning to show how the flying
[1:02:35] saucers they're connected to the seventh
[1:02:39] seal now in Revelation
[1:02:46] 81 and when he opened the seventh seal
[1:02:48] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:02:50] space of half an
[1:02:54] hour brother Bram says in the seventh
[1:02:57] seal paragraph
[1:03:04] 77 now the eighth chapter only reveals
[1:03:07] the scene the scene of the seventh
[1:03:11] seal where nothing else is revealed now
[1:03:19] nothing it's not revealed in the seventh
[1:03:21] seal now has nothing to do with the
[1:03:23] seventh chapter of
[1:03:24] Revelation
[1:03:29] the revelation of the the revealing of
[1:03:31] the seventh seal is perfectly
[1:03:36] mute and if I only had time I'll try a
[1:03:39] few places to show
[1:03:43] you now as we just heard that brother
[1:03:45] brandham
[1:03:48] says the seven seal is
[1:03:52] silence but there's examples that are in
[1:03:55] the Bible
[1:03:57] so it was
[1:03:58] revealed and it was not
[1:04:01] revealed it it seems like it's
[1:04:05] both now paragraph 78 it
[1:04:08] says all the way back from
[1:04:13] Genesis this seventh chapter or seventh
[1:04:16] seal is spoke
[1:04:19] ofis from the beginning in
[1:04:22] Genesis how many believe brother
[1:04:24] brandham okay
[1:04:30] now in the sardian church age he
[1:04:36] says and Jesus comes from heaven with
[1:04:38] tens with 10,000 times 10,000 of his
[1:04:47] Saints and the Bible says that the
[1:04:49] heavens was empty for a space of half an
[1:04:54] hour so where's this big fellow
[1:04:58] God uhhuh you see he's in
[1:05:03] Christ so the reason that there's
[1:05:06] silence first of
[1:05:10] all God doesn't want anyone to know when
[1:05:12] he
[1:05:15] comes but there's also silence in
[1:05:18] heaven because God comes out of heaven
[1:05:21] and he comes down to the
[1:05:24] Earth
[1:05:26] and the message souls in
[1:05:33] prisons but remember all this time Noah
[1:05:35] was in the
[1:05:37] ark the bride is sealed in with
[1:05:42] Christ the last member has been
[1:05:46] redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced
[1:05:52] itself the seventh seal brings him back
[1:05:55] to the Earth
[1:06:00] Earth the lamb come and took the book
[1:06:03] out of his right hand and sat down and
[1:06:04] claimed what he
[1:06:06] owed what he had
[1:06:08] redeemed that's
[1:06:10] right it's always been that third
[1:06:16] pole so we can see why there was silence
[1:06:18] in
[1:06:20] heaven God came out of Heaven came down
[1:06:23] to the Earth
[1:06:26] when he comes
[1:06:28] down he comes in a flying
[1:06:34] saucer I want to emphasize the next
[1:06:39] quote because as we just
[1:06:42] read there's an aspect of the seventh
[1:06:45] seal that is
[1:06:48] silence but it can also be
[1:06:54] revealed
[1:06:57] now brother Brandon says God's only Pro
[1:06:58] in the message God's only provided place
[1:07:00] of
[1:07:03] worship now watch this is a month before
[1:07:06] he passed
[1:07:08] away just look at what he says a month
[1:07:10] prior to passing
[1:07:13] away now all these things are in
[1:07:18] there and we find sometime I'd like to
[1:07:20] come to
[1:07:22] shreport where we can have two or three
[1:07:24] weeks
[1:07:27] just to take 30 minutes a
[1:07:31] night and just on a teaching
[1:07:35] see just stay right in the
[1:07:39] word in these secret
[1:07:44] passages where we could find out just
[1:07:47] how to get
[1:07:49] in so you can see how there's secret
[1:07:52] passages in the Bible
[1:07:56] and the seventh seal it
[1:08:00] reveals how to enter the secret passages
[1:08:02] of the
[1:08:04] Bible when God
[1:08:07] descends he descends with the
[1:08:10] purpose he comes with the book at his
[1:08:13] hand to read the names that are
[1:08:17] there and when God reads the names and
[1:08:19] descends on the
[1:08:21] earth he's calling you he's calling you
[1:08:27] maybe you in your
[1:08:29] life you're in a denominational system
[1:08:32] you're in the
[1:08:34] world so God has a secret
[1:08:37] passage to call you from there and bring
[1:08:41] you unto
[1:08:43] him it's not a public show it's not for
[1:08:47] the whole
[1:08:48] world it's a secret
[1:08:51] passage that God reveals to his
[1:08:54] seed
[1:08:56] so as he can find himself with
[1:08:59] him that's how the Rapture
[1:09:02] is in a literal
[1:09:04] aspect but now
[1:09:07] spiritually the seventh
[1:09:09] seal it's God coming
[1:09:11] down to call
[1:09:15] you for you to go into a secret
[1:09:18] passage to find yourself with
[1:09:24] him
[1:09:29] now say he says in the m in the message
[1:09:31] Christ is the mystery of God
[1:09:34] revealed God's great mystery of how it
[1:09:37] is a
[1:09:39] secret of how it is it's a secret he
[1:09:42] kept it a
[1:09:44] secret nobody know nothing about
[1:09:47] it even the angels didn't understand
[1:09:51] it see he didn't reveal
[1:09:54] it
[1:09:56] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:09:59] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[1:10:02] there was
[1:10:06] silence Jesus when he was on the earth
[1:10:08] they wanted to know when he would
[1:10:13] come he said it's not even the son
[1:10:15] himself don't know when it's going to
[1:10:20] happen see God has this all to himself
[1:10:24] it's a secret
[1:10:28] and we'll go through the secret
[1:10:32] passage because the seven seal is not
[1:10:34] for
[1:10:35] everyone it's for his
[1:10:39] elect God revealing himself
[1:10:42] personally
[1:10:45] individually so that the individual
[1:10:48] person can find the secret
[1:10:52] passage some something that someone else
[1:10:54] cannot see
[1:11:00] that's why that's the reason there was
[1:11:01] silence in heaven for a space of half an
[1:11:04] hour and seven Thunders utter their
[1:11:08] voices and John was even forbidden to
[1:11:11] write
[1:11:12] it you see the coming of the
[1:11:19] Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:11:21] yet of how he will
[1:11:23] come and when he will come
[1:11:27] and it's a good thing that he
[1:11:29] doesn't no he hasn't revealed it then he
[1:11:33] says he has
[1:11:35] showed or
[1:11:37] revealed in every
[1:11:39] type in the
[1:11:44] Bible that's why the seventh
[1:11:46] seal has not been
[1:11:49] revealed because Christ has not come in
[1:11:51] a physical
[1:11:53] form but it has been revealed
[1:11:56] in a spiritual
[1:11:58] form because Christ already come
[1:12:03] here Christ has already
[1:12:06] come not in a physical
[1:12:08] form he used another body to
[1:12:14] come every one of
[1:12:16] us we have different
[1:12:18] bodies we have an Earthly body a
[1:12:21] Heavenly
[1:12:22] Body the Lord also has an Earthly body
[1:12:26] and a Heavenly
[1:12:31] Body so the people always wait for the
[1:12:33] Rapture where God comes down
[1:12:36] physically but before he comes
[1:12:39] physically he came down using another
[1:12:46] body that's why the seven SE was already
[1:12:49] opened and then it was not
[1:12:51] opened in one aspect yes but in another
[1:12:54] no
[1:12:58] continue
[1:13:02] saying therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:13:04] revelation of revelation of God's
[1:13:06] mystery in
[1:13:10] Christ the entire Bible is an expression
[1:13:13] is an expression of one goal that God
[1:13:17] had one purpose he wanted to achieve in
[1:13:20] the entire
[1:13:24] Bible notice how we when we read
[1:13:28] previously that even the seventh seal is
[1:13:30] found in
[1:13:33] Genesis and then here it says it's found
[1:13:35] in the entire
[1:13:38] Bible but it's a secret
[1:13:40] passage not everyone's going to
[1:13:44] find but some will be able to
[1:13:47] find the secret
[1:13:49] passage of the seventh seal in the
[1:13:52] entire
[1:13:54] Bible
[1:14:01] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:14:03] goal that God
[1:14:05] had one purpose he wanted to achieve in
[1:14:08] the entire
[1:14:10] Bible and all the acts of the Believers
[1:14:13] in the
[1:14:18] Bible has been in the Bible has been an
[1:14:21] expression of what God's goal
[1:14:24] is
[1:14:26] now in this last day he has revealed it
[1:14:29] and shows
[1:14:35] it and God's help will'll see it right
[1:14:37] here in the morning of what he's had
[1:14:38] this whole
[1:14:40] time and has expressed
[1:14:46] it therefore you can see the great
[1:14:49] meaning of what it's been to know
[1:14:52] this and then try to bring it to to the
[1:15:00] people and then you don't I haven't went
[1:15:03] into details to try and explain it as
[1:15:05] God has revealed it to
[1:15:06] me so there's types there's
[1:15:10] shadows in the entire Bible of the
[1:15:13] seventh seal the seventh seal it's the
[1:15:17] coming of the
[1:15:18] Lord but what way does he
[1:15:23] come
[1:15:26] okayy let's go to Revelation
[1:15:42] 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:15:45] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:15:47] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:15:49] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[1:15:51] as pillars of
[1:15:53] fire how many
[1:15:55] understand that's Jesus Christ not in a
[1:15:58] physical
[1:15:59] form but using another
[1:16:02] body that's the seventh seal but in
[1:16:06] another form using another
[1:16:15] body and he had in his hand a little
[1:16:17] book open and he set his right foot upon
[1:16:19] the sea and his left foot on the
[1:16:22] earth so in verse 1 and2 he
[1:16:27] speaks about different parts of the body
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:32] head the feet the
[1:16:36] hands those are parts of a
[1:16:40] body but it's not a physical
[1:16:43] body it's another type of
[1:16:50] body so Revelation
[1:16:53] 81 says there was silence in
[1:16:56] heaven but the seventh
[1:16:59] seal is the Lord descending from Heaven
[1:17:02] unto the
[1:17:04] Earth so Revelation
[1:17:07] 81 it shows the seventh
[1:17:11] seal from the point of view of
[1:17:13] heaven but then Revelation
[1:17:16] 10 it shows the seventh
[1:17:20] seal from the point of view from the
[1:17:23] Earth
[1:17:27] so if you want to know about the seventh
[1:17:29] seal go to Revelation
[1:17:31] 10 that's the
[1:17:33] Revelation or it's the
[1:17:36] flesh the secret
[1:17:38] passage that the
[1:17:41] Eagles that have the
[1:17:43] ability to go up
[1:17:46] High they'll find secret
[1:17:48] passages throughout the entire
[1:17:53] Bible
[1:17:58] now let's go back to Obadiah
[1:18:01] 1 remember we're comparing the seven
[1:18:04] seal to the flying
[1:18:10] saucers verse one says the vision of
[1:18:16] Obadiah the Lord thus sayith the Lord
[1:18:18] concerning
[1:18:20] Edom Edom is another name for
[1:18:23] Esau if you go to Genesis
[1:18:27] 25 when Esau sold his
[1:18:30] Birthright said his name was
[1:18:34] Edom we've heard the rumor from the
[1:18:40] Lord and an ambassador sent among the
[1:18:42] nation among the
[1:18:45] heathens uh something that I
[1:18:50] noticed how says in English we've heard
[1:18:52] the rumor of the Lord
[1:18:56] but in Spanish it uses a different
[1:19:00] word it uses the word uh pron or
[1:19:03] proclamation of the
[1:19:06] Lord and that word means an official
[1:19:10] announcement so it seems like the the
[1:19:13] languages they contradict one
[1:19:16] another one is an official
[1:19:18] announcement and another's a
[1:19:20] rumor did the Bible make a
[1:19:23] mistake did the translators make a
[1:19:27] mistake but a flying
[1:19:30] saucer it's a
[1:19:33] rumor it's something that someone else
[1:19:36] saw and told us about
[1:19:39] it and I don't know if I should believe
[1:19:41] him or
[1:19:43] not but if you search the
[1:19:46] internet even the government
[1:19:50] today is officially public uh
[1:19:53] publicizing videos
[1:19:55] of flying
[1:19:57] saucers it's a
[1:19:59] rumor I don't
[1:20:02] know but even the government has to
[1:20:04] accept
[1:20:07] it they've made public the flying
[1:20:13] saucers now it says see the Flying
[1:20:19] Saucer and an ambassador sent among the
[1:20:22] Heathen the messenger or the
[1:20:26] Ambassador is the Flying
[1:20:30] Saucer says God sends flying
[1:20:34] saucers to different
[1:20:36] nations to investigate what's happening
[1:20:45] there so God sends his Ambassador his
[1:20:49] angel from
[1:20:52] heaven down to the Earth
[1:20:56] they're investigating
[1:20:58] Edom which is today the
[1:21:02] devil brother BR says that Esau was the
[1:21:05] seed of the
[1:21:08] devil so God sends his embassador his
[1:21:11] Angel his Flying
[1:21:13] Saucer to
[1:21:16] investigate What's Happening Here on the
[1:21:19] earth verse
[1:21:23] three
[1:21:30] the pride of thine heart hath deceived
[1:21:32] thee thou that dwellest in the Cliffs of
[1:21:34] the Rocks whose habitation is high that
[1:21:36] saith in his heart who shall bring me
[1:21:38] down to the
[1:21:40] ground who does that Spirit remind you
[1:21:42] of of
[1:21:44] Lucifer when in
[1:21:49] heaven he went to the mounts of the
[1:21:52] congregation to the to theend of the
[1:21:55] north there I'll make my
[1:21:58] Throne you that said in your
[1:22:02] heart it's
[1:22:05] Edom it's speaking of
[1:22:08] Edom but truly of the spirit that's
[1:22:10] within
[1:22:12] him the spirit of the
[1:22:14] devil The Serpent of the deil the seed
[1:22:16] of the
[1:22:18] devil through his children here on the
[1:22:22] earth says in verse four
[1:22:26] though thou exalt thyself as the
[1:22:29] eagle and thou set th thy Nest amongst
[1:22:32] the
[1:22:33] stars then I will bring thee down sayith
[1:22:36] the
[1:22:39] Lord now if you see through the entire
[1:22:44] Bible the devil's always trying to come
[1:22:46] where God
[1:22:47] is if God's in
[1:22:49] heaven the devil wants to get
[1:22:52] there he did it there in the war with
[1:22:54] with
[1:22:57] Michael so when the devil's
[1:23:00] seed is here on the
[1:23:02] earth they also want to get to
[1:23:08] heaven when Kan and abble were here on
[1:23:11] the
[1:23:12] earth the fall had already
[1:23:15] happened the Bible says that
[1:23:18] men both
[1:23:20] men they went to the
[1:23:23] gate
[1:23:25] that was on the eastern part of
[1:23:27] Eden there was an angel there a
[1:23:32] cherubin with a flaming
[1:23:36] sword and both had to make a
[1:23:40] sacrifice to enter that
[1:23:43] Dimension where the Garden of Eden
[1:23:46] lied but
[1:23:49] Abel received the seventh
[1:23:53] seal which is the Lord Lord coming down
[1:23:55] personally to his
[1:23:58] seed revealed the secret to
[1:24:01] Abel of the secret
[1:24:05] passage of how to enter the Garden of
[1:24:11] Eden but
[1:24:14] Cain he was not God's
[1:24:17] seed but he came so
[1:24:19] close to enter that
[1:24:22] Dimension to enter that door
[1:24:27] God told
[1:24:28] Cain why are you
[1:24:31] angry do what your brother did and
[1:24:34] you'll
[1:24:36] Enter he didn't want
[1:24:38] to because the devil and his
[1:24:42] seed they want to get to
[1:24:45] heaven in their own
[1:24:47] way they don't want to
[1:24:50] accept God's provided
[1:24:53] way
[1:24:55] God's provided
[1:24:57] way the secret
[1:24:59] passage was revealed to
[1:25:02] Abel the way that he can have the
[1:25:05] key to enter into the
[1:25:09] door was to slay an innocent
[1:25:13] sacrifice the way they will enter
[1:25:16] Heaven is through the
[1:25:19] blood of our sa of our innocent
[1:25:22] sacrifice which is Jesus Jesus
[1:25:25] Christ but
[1:25:29] Cain he rejected what Abel was
[1:25:32] revealed and he killed his
[1:25:35] brother he killed the Christ of his
[1:25:39] day therefore the seventh
[1:25:41] seal comes brings God down to the Earth
[1:25:45] we
[1:25:47] today we're in the seventh Church
[1:25:50] age and it was in this age that brother
[1:25:52] brandham says
[1:25:55] I indict this
[1:25:57] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:26:00] Jesus
[1:26:01] Christ the seventh
[1:26:03] seal it's revealed in
[1:26:06] history of Cain and
[1:26:09] Abel both brothers as they
[1:26:12] grew they lived through seven Church
[1:26:15] ages but in the seventh
[1:26:18] Abel received a
[1:26:21] visitation let us say a a flying s
[1:26:25] a
[1:26:26] cloud on behalf of the
[1:26:29] Lord and revealed to him the
[1:26:32] key to enter the secret
[1:26:36] passage but since Cain is not God's
[1:26:39] seed he did not reveal it to
[1:26:42] Cain but even gave him the
[1:26:46] opportunity without having Revelation to
[1:26:50] enter all he had to do was do the same
[1:26:53] as his brother
[1:26:56] but being that he was the devil's
[1:26:58] seed and the devil's
[1:27:01] arrogance he wants to get to heaven his
[1:27:03] own
[1:27:04] way he wants to exalt
[1:27:08] himself Cain in his
[1:27:10] arrogance rejected
[1:27:12] God and crucified
[1:27:18] Abel brother bam says that after the
[1:27:20] laan church
[1:27:22] age when the Great you enter the Great
[1:27:25] tribulation the mark of the best beast
[1:27:28] begins and then
[1:27:31] Cain while in the loud Sayan Church age
[1:27:35] he crucified
[1:27:37] Abel a
[1:27:39] judge and then a judge came down from
[1:27:44] heaven and judged the denominational
[1:27:46] system of
[1:27:50] Cain and since Cain rejected
[1:27:53] Abel who was the Christ the seventh
[1:27:57] seal revealed on the
[1:27:59] earth since he rejected and killed
[1:28:03] him the Bible says that God expelled
[1:28:07] him and cast him out of
[1:28:09] Eden and placed a mark on his
[1:28:12] forehead which represents the mark of
[1:28:14] the
[1:28:15] beast because the seventh seal it's in
[1:28:19] Genesis it's throughout the whole
[1:28:22] Bible but You' got to find the secret
[1:28:26] passage how to find the seventh seal
[1:28:29] inis in
[1:28:34] Genesis the seventh
[1:28:36] seal when it's God coming down to the
[1:28:39] Earth it
[1:28:43] judges the denominational
[1:28:46] system that the devil has
[1:28:49] established through his
[1:28:53] seed
[1:28:55] so now we're in the
[1:28:57] world God already came down in our day
[1:29:00] the
[1:29:02] cloud and when the cloud came
[1:29:05] down brother bradam calls it the
[1:29:12] judge so there's de the devil's seed in
[1:29:15] this
[1:29:16] age and that seed without
[1:29:21] knowing it's edifying the devil
[1:29:25] Kingdom edifying the denominational
[1:29:28] system so
[1:29:32] therefore they get so
[1:29:34] close so close to enter
[1:29:39] Heaven God's giving
[1:29:43] Mercy tells them you're getting so close
[1:29:47] but humble
[1:29:50] yourself and accept my secret passage
[1:29:55] it's to accept Jesus
[1:29:57] Christ if you don't accept Jesus Christ
[1:30:00] you can't enter
[1:30:02] in and since they don't want to get to
[1:30:05] heaven God's provided way in their
[1:30:09] arrogance they reject
[1:30:13] God and they crucify the seventh seal
[1:30:16] incarnated here on the earth of their
[1:30:22] day
[1:30:26] verse four in
[1:30:35] Obadiah though thou exalt thyself as e
[1:30:37] as the eagle and thou set thy Nest Among
[1:30:40] the Stars Then will I bring thee down
[1:30:42] sayeth the
[1:30:43] Lord I heard a minister once he
[1:30:49] said God doesn't like man to go to the
[1:30:52] Moon he took the scripture
[1:30:58] here he spoke about the first
[1:31:02] spaceship that was able to land on the
[1:31:08] moono it was called Apollo 11
[1:31:14] eagle and it says here if thou would
[1:31:16] exalt thyself as the
[1:31:21] eagle and though th set amongst the
[1:31:25] stars then will I bring thee down sayith
[1:31:28] the
[1:31:30] Lord Brother brand says in the message
[1:31:32] the
[1:31:34] countdown about the literal
[1:31:38] astronauts says God's allowing them to
[1:31:41] do
[1:31:43] this to show what God will do to his
[1:31:49] people if there's astronauts that
[1:31:51] pertain to the
[1:31:52] devil there's astronauts that pertain to
[1:31:56] God they'll go in the
[1:31:58] Rapture with rapturing
[1:32:00] faith with the anointing of an
[1:32:05] eagle the devil's
[1:32:07] imitating the
[1:32:12] eagle so then when that spaceship went
[1:32:14] up to the
[1:32:16] moono it was called Apollo 11 Eagle
[1:32:19] Apollo and
[1:32:21] Apollo was a man a name
[1:32:26] of a Greek
[1:32:28] god that was worshiped in the
[1:32:32] past brother brandom says that today's
[1:32:35] Pope is a modern
[1:32:41] Apollo so the the president that
[1:32:43] proposed the
[1:32:44] idea to send a man to the Moon he was
[1:32:48] Catholic John F Kennedy John F
[1:32:52] Kennedy you can find the brother
[1:32:54] brandham
[1:32:55] says the Catholic Church entered the
[1:32:57] United
[1:32:59] States when they voted for
[1:33:05] Kennedy now Apollo was a Sun
[1:33:12] God now it says the spaceship's name was
[1:33:14] Apollo 11
[1:33:18] Eagle so something that really caught my
[1:33:22] attention the devil's trying to imitate
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:28] eagle the name of this
[1:33:31] spaceship is named is called
[1:33:34] Apollo the Sun
[1:33:37] God and we have an
[1:33:39] eagle we have a
[1:33:42] ship which which is our son God it's
[1:33:46] Jesus Christ Phoenix the
[1:33:51] Phoenix so yesterday
[1:33:55] I encountered sister
[1:33:58] Rosman at sister Alma
[1:34:03] School I started to tell all this to
[1:34:05] Sister
[1:34:06] Rosa and she spoke to me of a
[1:34:09] mural that there that that's at her
[1:34:12] job if they can show me the
[1:34:16] pictures these are three drawings or
[1:34:19] pictures and within these
[1:34:22] pictures there's a
[1:34:25] phoenix and there's a
[1:34:27] spaceship the next image there's the
[1:34:31] Phoenix the
[1:34:35] next the spaceship here on the left
[1:34:44] side the devil wants to imitate the
[1:34:47] Phoenix he wants to imitate Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ but to do it his own way
[1:35:11] let's go to uh Proverbs
[1:35:18] 16:15 remember man has his own
[1:35:22] spaceships his own means of
[1:35:25] transportation which we use while we're
[1:35:28] here in the Rapture time we won't need
[1:35:33] that we'll have another means of
[1:35:38] transportation we want to see if the
[1:35:40] spaceship is truly in the
[1:35:46] Bible and Proverbs 16:15 it
[1:35:51] says in the light of the king's
[1:35:53] countenance his
[1:35:58] life and in what magazine was was the
[1:36:01] cloud
[1:36:05] published in the light of the king's
[1:36:08] countenance is is
[1:36:11] what
[1:36:18] life and his favor is as a cloud of
[1:36:21] Latter
[1:36:22] rainard what is latter rain rapturing
[1:36:27] Faith
[1:36:30] okay we're going to show that The Flying
[1:36:32] Saucer in the
[1:36:36] Bible in the message events made clear
[1:36:38] by
[1:36:39] prophecy brother Bram
[1:36:43] says friends this is the Fulfillment of
[1:36:46] Malachi
[1:36:47] 4 St Luke
[1:36:49] 17 St John
[1:36:52] 15 oh so many Revelation
[1:36:58] 10 so many prophecies that can be pinned
[1:37:01] exactly to this
[1:37:04] day and also in the Book of Mark and
[1:37:10] Matthew where he said these great signs
[1:37:12] and wonders would appear in the
[1:37:15] sky and people call them saucers flying
[1:37:22] saucers they can vanish with the power
[1:37:24] and quickness of a
[1:37:27] thought intelligence that can move
[1:37:29] in he can write can
[1:37:33] speak can do whatever he wants
[1:37:36] to the great Pillar of
[1:37:40] Fire brother br's comparing the great
[1:37:42] Pillar of
[1:37:43] Fire to a flying
[1:37:48] saucer the same yesterday today and
[1:37:52] forever and coming upon the
[1:37:56] Earth pyramids of smoke Rising into the
[1:38:03] air way above where there cannot be no
[1:38:06] humidity nor nothing 30 miles
[1:38:09] high what is brother Bram talking
[1:38:12] about that 30 mil
[1:38:18] High there's no possibility of any
[1:38:22] humidity because when this Cloud
[1:38:26] appeared the dimensions of the
[1:38:29] cloud was 30 by
[1:38:32] 26 uh in the air and a
[1:38:36] cloud consists of
[1:38:38] water you need
[1:38:41] humidity to form a
[1:38:43] cloud now when
[1:38:46] scientists the devil
[1:38:48] seed they saw the
[1:38:52] cloud they couldn't explain how that
[1:38:55] cloud was
[1:38:56] there first of all this is Arizona it's
[1:39:00] dry
[1:39:01] here it's not a humid
[1:39:04] climate it's a it's a dry
[1:39:07] heat it's rare for us to see the
[1:39:10] clouds not as frequent as in other
[1:39:13] places it doesn't rain as much
[1:39:17] here so then a
[1:39:21] cloud a cloud appearing in a dry
[1:39:24] place at a certain height it's
[1:39:28] impossible you need
[1:39:31] humidity to have a
[1:39:42] cloud when that cloud is so full of
[1:39:45] water it starts to
[1:39:49] rain but a cloud requires
[1:39:52] water so then when
[1:39:55] scientists they saw that
[1:39:59] cloud they couldn't explain how it was
[1:40:01] there at that
[1:40:02] height there's no humidity up
[1:40:05] there it's impossible for the cloud to
[1:40:07] be
[1:40:08] there a cloud needs
[1:40:10] water let me tell you
[1:40:13] this this Cloud did have a different
[1:40:15] type of water lad
[1:40:19] rain that raptured brother
[1:40:22] brandham why because the
[1:40:24] cloud it's a flying
[1:40:28] saucer you've seen in the
[1:40:30] movies how Flying Saucer
[1:40:33] comes and it goes up over a
[1:40:37] person it emits a form of a
[1:40:40] light a type of a
[1:40:43] ray that goes to the person and lifts
[1:40:46] the
[1:40:47] person when this Cloud came a flying
[1:40:52] saucer
[1:40:53] it admitted latter
[1:40:55] rain that raptured brother
[1:40:58] brandham because latter rain is
[1:41:00] rapturing
[1:41:13] Faith there where there can't be no
[1:41:15] humidity or
[1:41:16] anything 30 miles
[1:41:21] high uh uh a year and half before it
[1:41:25] happened that it would be that
[1:41:28] way then turn the
[1:41:31] picture turn the
[1:41:39] picture and if you turn the
[1:41:43] picture you see
[1:41:52] Christ
[1:41:54] then turn the picture and see who it is
[1:41:56] looking
[1:42:02] down let's go to Obadiah
[1:42:12] 16 remember the seventh
[1:42:15] seal is manifested during a specific
[1:42:19] time the Lord
[1:42:22] descends to
[1:42:24] judge and to to
[1:42:28] Rapture he descends to
[1:42:31] judge the denominational
[1:42:34] system the kings of the Earth the
[1:42:37] kingdom of the
[1:42:40] devil gradually the devil's building
[1:42:43] throughout
[1:42:45] time and if the god
[1:42:49] seed finds himself trapped in that
[1:42:52] Kingdom
[1:42:53] with that denominational
[1:42:57] system when the seventh seal opens the
[1:42:59] seventh
[1:43:00] Dimension where God
[1:43:02] is God comes down to the
[1:43:05] Earth and time shall be no
[1:43:08] more for the denominational
[1:43:11] system but time shall be no
[1:43:14] more for God's
[1:43:18] seed it's because God se's entering into
[1:43:20] the Eighth Day into eternity
[1:43:24] a new light
[1:43:27] greater that makes you see the
[1:43:29] denominational
[1:43:31] system it's
[1:43:38] Darkness one let's start with verse
[1:43:43] six how are the things of Esau searched
[1:43:46] out how are the hidden things sought
[1:43:48] up for the devil to build a
[1:43:51] kingdom he needs money
[1:43:54] finances riches as it
[1:43:58] says now in verse
[1:44:02] seven the way the devil achieves having
[1:44:05] those
[1:44:07] finances you know what the devil's
[1:44:09] tithes
[1:44:10] are
[1:44:16] taxes you say well then I'm not going to
[1:44:18] pay my taxes
[1:44:20] anymore Jesus said give to Caesar what
[1:44:22] is Caesar
[1:44:24] and to God what is
[1:44:27] God's so as the devil's charging his
[1:44:31] tithes charging
[1:44:34] taxes to edify his
[1:44:39] kingdom he does it through this various
[1:44:43] denominations various kingdoms he has
[1:44:46] here on the
[1:44:48] earth those
[1:44:50] denominations those Nations those
[1:44:52] government governments
[1:44:56] kingdoms they're they're Confederacy or
[1:44:58] Allies of the
[1:45:00] devil verse
[1:45:03] seven all the men of thy
[1:45:08] Confederacy have deceived
[1:45:17] thee that have even brought Thee the men
[1:45:19] that were at peace that have deceived
[1:45:21] thee that prevailed against thee they
[1:45:23] eat thy bread and have laid a wound
[1:45:24] under thee there is none understanding
[1:45:26] in
[1:45:30] him so for the devil to achieve his uh
[1:45:33] his
[1:45:36] goal and it says all of thy
[1:45:41] Confederacy and I enjoy how it says it
[1:45:43] in English the those of your
[1:45:46] Confederacy but I also like it in
[1:45:48] Spanish You're
[1:45:50] allies because A Confederacy
[1:45:53] it's a
[1:45:55] union of various
[1:45:57] Nations various
[1:45:59] systems
[1:46:04] uniting but they will deceive
[1:46:09] thee let's go to Psalm
[1:46:15] 831 so before the seven seal takes
[1:46:19] place the devil's edifying his kingdom
[1:46:24] having different
[1:46:25] denominations kingdoms
[1:46:29] governments that turn into allies of the
[1:46:34] devil just like the Catholic Church
[1:46:37] controls everything under
[1:46:40] heaven so there's a certain
[1:46:45] pressure that the devil he's
[1:46:48] applying against God's
[1:46:51] seed
[1:46:56] before the seventh seal is
[1:46:58] manifested that pressure or that
[1:47:04] persecution the devil's using it to
[1:47:07] attack God's
[1:47:10] people but then God descends in the
[1:47:12] seventh
[1:47:13] seal to judge the devil in his
[1:47:16] kingdom and to Rapture his
[1:47:20] people Psalm
[1:47:21] 831
[1:47:24] we can see the persecution before the
[1:47:26] seventh
[1:47:30] seal keep thou keep not thou silence oh
[1:47:33] God hold not thy peace oh be and be not
[1:47:36] still oh
[1:47:41] God for Lo thine enemies make a tumult
[1:47:44] and they that hate thee have lifted up
[1:47:46] th the
[1:47:51] head
[1:47:53] they have taken crafty counsel against
[1:47:55] thy people and consulted against thy
[1:47:57] hidden
[1:47:59] ones so you can see the persecution
[1:48:01] before the seventh
[1:48:10] seal they have said come and let us cut
[1:48:13] them off from being a nation that the
[1:48:15] name Israel may be no more in
[1:48:21] remembrance for consulted together with
[1:48:24] one consent they are a they are
[1:48:26] Confederate against
[1:48:32] thee do you see how this says that they
[1:48:34] have become a Confederate against
[1:48:38] thee and an English in Spanish an
[1:48:41] alliance and an English a
[1:48:44] Confederate verse
[1:48:47] six see the different
[1:48:49] denominations the different kingdoms of
[1:48:52] the devil
[1:48:58] the Tabernacles of Edom and the
[1:48:59] ishmaelites of Moab and the
[1:49:06] hagaren gabal and Amon and amalec and
[1:49:09] the Philistines and the inhabitants of
[1:49:14] Tyreek so then before the seventh
[1:49:18] seal the devil's building his
[1:49:21] kingdom
[1:49:23] through different systems and
[1:49:27] Nations applying a pressure against
[1:49:30] God's
[1:49:32] seed so that they can also Unite with
[1:49:36] him in that
[1:49:39] time God comes down in the seventh
[1:49:42] seal to judge God's
[1:49:46] kingdom and to rescue the
[1:49:51] seed
[1:49:57] and the message the handwriting on the
[1:50:01] wall everything that Satan has on the
[1:50:04] earth is something that he's perverted
[1:50:05] from
[1:50:08] God God creates and Satan makes an
[1:50:10] imitation to
[1:50:13] it there's churches today on
[1:50:16] Earth great
[1:50:18] churches that's controlled by the
[1:50:21] devil
[1:50:23] it's a perversion from the True Church
[1:50:24] of
[1:50:29] God every great denomination is trying
[1:50:31] to sweep everything into its
[1:50:37] realm And when they see they failed on
[1:50:39] that Roman Catholicism had their
[1:50:45] part but now they're trying to have a
[1:50:47] confederation of
[1:50:51] churches
[1:50:53] and not knowing the Bible said they
[1:50:54] would have
[1:50:57] that there would be a
[1:51:01] beast and an image unto the
[1:51:04] Beast Confederation of
[1:51:09] churches and you Full Gospel people
[1:51:13] know the Assemblies of God
[1:51:17] Brethren now now look at Esau
[1:51:20] here how it speaks about Esau
[1:51:24] Esau was the one that sold his
[1:51:26] Birthright so God tells in
[1:51:28] Obadiah he tells
[1:51:32] Esau the men of their Confederacy are
[1:51:34] going to deceive
[1:51:39] thee when you Den when you forfeit your
[1:51:42] birth
[1:51:45] rights you when you went into
[1:51:50] it and that's right you have to deny
[1:51:53] your Evangelical
[1:51:55] teachings so the devil's
[1:51:59] Confederacy to unite to that
[1:52:03] Alliance you've got to leave
[1:52:08] Christ just like Cain had the
[1:52:11] opportunity to accept
[1:52:15] Christ to accept God's provided way to
[1:52:19] enter but he rejected the Christ of his
[1:52:21] day
[1:52:27] able Cain
[1:52:30] rejected the EV Evangelical
[1:52:32] teaching of
[1:52:35] Abel when Abel killed an innocent lamb
[1:52:40] Cain he he became a
[1:52:44] Confederate he became a Confederacy or
[1:52:46] an
[1:52:47] alliance with the
[1:52:50] devil to kill the Christ of his day
[1:52:53] while
[1:52:55] Christ was becoming a
[1:52:58] Confederacy or in an
[1:53:00] ally entering into a union with
[1:53:07] Abel when God comes
[1:53:10] down he unites with his
[1:53:14] bride but in that time the devil had his
[1:53:17] own
[1:53:18] unions to kill the bride the Christ of
[1:53:22] it's
[1:53:31] day let's go to Genesis
[1:53:46] 11 remember the seventh
[1:53:48] seal is throughout the whole
[1:53:51] Bible but it's a secret
[1:53:55] passage revealed to those that have
[1:53:57] their name in the
[1:53:58] book if your name's in the
[1:54:02] book you'll have your own visitation of
[1:54:05] the seventh
[1:54:06] seal God will come for
[1:54:09] you the devil's
[1:54:11] persecuting through the church let's say
[1:54:14] your job
[1:54:17] wherever if you feel the persecution of
[1:54:19] the
[1:54:21] devil through the different
[1:54:24] systems and kingdoms he has established
[1:54:26] in the
[1:54:27] world when you're under the
[1:54:30] persecution God
[1:54:32] descends in a type and Shadow of the
[1:54:34] seventh
[1:54:35] seal to rescue
[1:54:39] you and gives you a secret
[1:54:45] passage to escape the pressures of the
[1:54:50] devilis Genesis 11 uh
[1:54:53] 111 uh the Tower of
[1:55:00] Babel and the whole earth was of one
[1:55:02] language and of one
[1:55:03] speech look at the
[1:55:06] unity the
[1:55:08] Confederacy the
[1:55:10] alliance of the devil's
[1:55:12] Kingdom at the Tower of
[1:55:20] Babel and it came came to pass as they
[1:55:23] journeyed from the East they found a
[1:55:24] plane in the land of shinar and they
[1:55:26] dwelt
[1:55:35] there and they said one to another go go
[1:55:39] too let us make brick and burn them
[1:55:40] thoroughly and they had brick for stone
[1:55:42] and slime had they for
[1:55:45] Mortar the the scientists of their
[1:55:51] day
[1:55:58] and they said go go too let us build a
[1:56:00] city and a tower whose top May reach
[1:56:02] unto heaven and let us make a name lest
[1:56:04] we be scattered abroad upon the face of
[1:56:06] the whole
[1:56:08] earth remember the devil and his
[1:56:11] seed they want to get to
[1:56:15] heaven but their own
[1:56:17] way
[1:56:20] Nimrod was making his own
[1:56:23] way he was
[1:56:26] imitating
[1:56:28] Enoch that built a
[1:56:32] building and saw how Enoch one day
[1:56:38] disappeared he saw how Enoch probably
[1:56:40] went through a
[1:56:41] dimension a secret
[1:56:43] passage and
[1:56:47] disappeared Enoch escaped God's
[1:56:50] judgment that was through through the
[1:56:53] flood now
[1:56:55] Nimrod is trying to imitate
[1:56:58] Enoch a spiritual
[1:57:02] astronauts and him being a natural
[1:57:06] astronaut having an alliance in a
[1:57:09] Unity with different people of the
[1:57:12] world charging
[1:57:14] tithes his
[1:57:17] taxes to have enough
[1:57:21] money to build a tower that reaches
[1:57:27] heaven now let's see the seventh seal in
[1:57:29] verse
[1:57:32] 5 and the Lord came down to see the
[1:57:35] city where did the Lord descend
[1:57:38] from from up
[1:57:42] there the seventh seal is the Lord
[1:57:44] coming from Heaven to the
[1:57:47] Earth so maybe when he
[1:57:50] descended he descended in an Flying
[1:57:54] Saucer and Nimrod saw this strange
[1:57:57] thing and he didn't understand what this
[1:58:00] light
[1:58:01] was what that round thing was then he
[1:58:06] noticed that all that were around
[1:58:08] him they started to speak Spanish they
[1:58:11] started to speak Chinese fren
[1:58:19] German the seventh seal for nimrod
[1:58:23] was judgment for his
[1:58:25] kingdom but for
[1:58:27] Abraham he also lived
[1:58:30] there and when the seventh seal was
[1:58:34] manifested it took out
[1:58:37] Abraham from the devil's
[1:58:40] Kingdom from the denominational
[1:58:43] system took him to another
[1:58:47] place Abraham had the seventh
[1:58:50] seal the secret
[1:58:54] passage of how to truly get up
[1:58:57] there so when the seventh seal was
[1:59:00] manifested God the
[1:59:03] judge let's say a cloud came
[1:59:07] down and a revelation was given to
[1:59:12] Abraham that this system of nimrod
[1:59:14] wasn't going to
[1:59:15] function they wouldn't get to
[1:59:18] heaven because now there's a confusion
[1:59:20] of languages
[1:59:24] therefore he came out of the
[1:59:25] denominational
[1:59:27] system went to another place and
[1:59:29] encountered the
[1:59:31] architect of the Heavenly
[1:59:34] Kingdom he found
[1:59:37] MDC and our eighth messenger is is
[1:59:46] MDC the seventh messenger the seventh
[1:59:48] seal was
[1:59:50] revealed judgement for for
[1:59:53] Nimrod but it was an exodus and a
[1:59:56] Rapture
[1:59:58] Resurrection a
[2:00:00] rejuvenating for
[2:00:10] Abraham what really caught my attention
[2:00:11] when I went to
[2:00:15] Salvador was when they took me to that
[2:00:17] place called the Gate of of the door of
[2:00:19] the
[2:00:20] devil
[2:00:23] because here
[2:00:25] Babel Babel means uh the gates To
[2:00:29] Paradise or the gates to to
[2:00:31] God B
[2:00:33] A is is door is and a l is
[2:00:40] God or e l is God and in different parts
[2:00:43] of the
[2:00:46] Bible you can see that God is in
[2:00:48] different names Bethlehem like Bethlehem
[2:00:52] Bethesda
[2:00:54] Bethesda now Babel was the door to God
[2:00:57] or the gate to
[2:00:58] God but
[2:01:02] Nimrod did not accept the provided
[2:01:05] way that was already constituted by
[2:01:10] Enoch by faith you get to
[2:01:14] heaven he wanted to do it this through
[2:01:20] science
[2:01:23] this age of
[2:01:25] laa received its seventh
[2:01:29] seal but since La crucified the
[2:01:34] message they crucified the Christ of
[2:01:36] their
[2:01:37] day all that's left is
[2:01:41] Judgment but while we're
[2:01:46] here we're not under that Lan
[2:01:49] anointing which is rich
[2:01:54] but does not know that they're blind and
[2:01:56] naked and
[2:01:59] miserable just like Nimrod was
[2:02:03] rich God showed him he was nothing your
[2:02:07] money your
[2:02:09] science won't take you to
[2:02:12] Heaven accept God's provided Way by
[2:02:15] faith you'll get to
[2:02:17] heaven faith in the secret
[2:02:20] passage which is Jesus Christ
[2:02:23] our
[2:02:24] blood that will take us up
[2:02:32] there in the message
[2:02:36] Investments remember Babel was called
[2:02:38] the door to
[2:02:40] God but then God shut the
[2:02:47] door but L we find all the church AG all
[2:02:50] the other Church ages
[2:02:53] Jesus was still in the
[2:02:55] church but on the Lan age he was outside
[2:03:00] knocking trying to get
[2:03:08] in and this is the age when the
[2:03:10] manifestation of Christ comes so perfect
[2:03:12] in the image of Christ in his
[2:03:16] church until the
[2:03:18] churches as the brother said a while ago
[2:03:22] is closing the
[2:03:26] door and yet he stands with love
[2:03:30] knocking If any man hunger or
[2:03:33] thirst brother Bram knocked on the
[2:03:38] pulpit do you understand the
[2:03:40] congregation says
[2:03:43] amen you wait a closed
[2:03:45] door it's the L
[2:03:50] age but we're not a part of
[2:03:54] La we've come out of her perverse
[2:03:58] teachings denominational
[2:04:00] systems our Kingdom's not
[2:04:03] here but as while we're
[2:04:07] here the spiritual kingdom is
[2:04:10] manifested the true sons of
[2:04:13] God and they're finding the secret
[2:04:19] passages psalms 27
[2:04:23] verse
[2:04:24] one for those that
[2:04:27] know brother uses Psalms
[2:04:30] 27 to preach the
[2:04:41] Rapture the Lord is my light and my
[2:04:43] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[2:04:45] my the Lord is the strength of my life
[2:04:47] of whom shall I be
[2:04:50] afraid
[2:04:57] verse two says when the wicked even my
[2:04:58] enemies and foes Came Upon
[2:05:01] me you see the different groups that
[2:05:05] come the alliance and Confederation of
[2:05:07] the
[2:05:09] devil persecuting the true seed of
[2:05:14] God to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[2:05:20] fell though a host should though a host
[2:05:23] should encamp against
[2:05:26] me my heart shall not
[2:05:31] fear the war should rise against me I
[2:05:33] will be
[2:05:35] confident so a army shall
[2:05:38] come a war shall come against you but
[2:05:42] your
[2:05:43] Escape your seventh seal your secret
[2:05:48] passage he'll reveal it
[2:05:50] here
[2:05:52] one thing I've desired of the
[2:06:00] Lord that I will seek after that I may
[2:06:02] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[2:06:04] days of my
[2:06:06] life to behold the beauty of the
[2:06:09] Lord and it says to
[2:06:12] inquire
[2:06:14] inquire to find the secret passage
[2:06:19] investigate just like when you're in a
[2:06:21] house
[2:06:24] and there's a a a cabinet where there's
[2:06:29] books and you take uh one of the
[2:06:32] books and then it opens up that entire
[2:06:36] furniture and that cabinet moves and you
[2:06:39] find a secret
[2:06:42] passage and you see secret
[2:06:45] Pathways that are within the same
[2:06:48] house that take you to this place to
[2:06:51] this place
[2:06:52] quickly that like we go from gen
[2:06:56] revelation we go toah to
[2:07:01] Genesis to a territory that has not been
[2:07:03] truly
[2:07:04] explored a secret
[2:07:07] passage that the seven seal will
[2:07:16] reveal for he shall hide me in his
[2:07:19] Pavilion in the time of trouble
[2:07:24] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[2:07:26] hide
[2:07:28] me in the
[2:07:30] secret of his
[2:07:35] Tabernacle there'll be a time where the
[2:07:37] Lord himself will come in a physical
[2:07:40] form I'm going to say
[2:07:42] this and the ministry of the son of
[2:07:45] man makes the theophanies come
[2:07:49] down and the theophanies will come to
[2:07:51] search for
[2:07:52] you those Mystic
[2:07:54] lights those flying
[2:07:58] saucers start to investigate where the
[2:08:00] sons of
[2:08:01] God under a persecution of the
[2:08:06] devil then you'll find yourself with a
[2:08:08] secret
[2:08:09] passage in the
[2:08:12] Tabernacle entering into a
[2:08:15] theophany and enter a secret
[2:08:19] passage of a hidden dimension
[2:08:23] that the devil's
[2:08:24] seed is this close to
[2:08:29] getting but since they don't accept
[2:08:31] Jesus
[2:08:33] Christ they don't accept God's provided
[2:08:35] way God closes the
[2:08:38] door but for us he opens
[2:08:43] it let us all
[2:08:50] stand
[2:08:53] and the message Christ is revealed in
[2:08:54] his own
[2:09:00] word no we could have got any continuity
[2:09:04] amongst Medics amongst scientists
[2:09:05] different
[2:09:08] ones you see the devil's
[2:09:13] Kingdom if Einstein only had the
[2:09:15] spiritual
[2:09:18] application as he had the physical
[2:09:20] application
[2:09:23] just see how close Einstein
[2:09:25] got how close this the devil seed
[2:09:29] gets just as close as Cain got and
[2:09:35] Nimrod but did not take the spiritual
[2:09:39] part which is the
[2:09:45] Revelation if Einstein only had the
[2:09:47] spiritual application as he had the
[2:09:49] physical
[2:09:50] application
[2:09:53] as he studied the laws of the light and
[2:09:55] so
[2:09:56] forth he could have told us
[2:10:02] something when I heard his message on
[2:10:04] the great Center somewhere into the
[2:10:14] skies that ever contacted with that
[2:10:17] Center would create Earths do anything
[2:10:19] and the power would be Unlimited
[2:10:23] see he had seen
[2:10:26] that you see these little pockets going
[2:10:29] through the
[2:10:30] air they call saucers and so
[2:10:36] forth people that well we better leave
[2:10:38] that
[2:10:41] alone hear all the people come up
[2:10:45] missing you say don't hear from
[2:10:48] them they're standing there and they're
[2:10:51] not
[2:10:53] there that's the way the Rapture is
[2:10:55] going to
[2:10:58] be one of them will drop right
[2:11:01] down this terrestrial
[2:11:04] body will take on the celestial
[2:11:07] body and there'll be bones
[2:11:11] left there'll be their High hair and
[2:11:13] Bones
[2:11:18] left it'll be transformed in a moment
[2:11:21] time dropping right out of space and
[2:11:23] taking home
[2:11:25] that we see all that going on
[2:11:30] now and the Pentagon wondering about
[2:11:33] these lights and these Mystic
[2:11:36] lights and everything they're seeing in
[2:11:38] the
[2:11:42] sky you seen they had one here at the
[2:11:44] paper at Jeffersonville this
[2:11:46] week and so forth a Mystic
[2:11:49] light so they don't I don't know what
[2:11:51] that
[2:11:52] is but listen little
[2:11:56] children it's going to pick you up one
[2:11:58] of these
[2:11:59] days you see don't worry let us
[2:12:05] pray Heavenly
[2:12:08] Father we know that there's something
[2:12:10] false and something
[2:12:12] real in
[2:12:16] things and the world has painted us a
[2:12:19] picture of flying saucers as something
[2:12:20] false
[2:12:23] but because of
[2:12:24] Revelation that you've
[2:12:27] given through the seventh
[2:12:30] seal the secret passage was
[2:12:33] open of what a flying saucer
[2:12:37] is now allow your flying
[2:12:41] saucer your Mystic light of the Holy
[2:12:45] Ghost that just one could enter in
[2:12:47] contact with the light through faith
[2:12:51] nor conscience nor
[2:12:53] money nothing
[2:12:57] carnal just Faith contacts that flying
[2:13:00] SAU help us Lord prepare
[2:13:04] us there have been many
[2:13:06] signs that you'll
[2:13:09] manifest in the seventh seal
