[32:32] we want to understand you more to please
[32:33] you more so
[32:36] help us tonight lord are you
[32:38] marcos help me and marcos
[32:49] the name of our lord jesus christ amen
[32:51] amen
[32:57] we can turn to exodus chapter 27 verse
[33:00] 1.
[33:22] um wood five cubits long five cubits
[33:25] abroad and the altar shall be four
[33:27] square and the height thereof shall be
[33:29] three cubits
[33:38] and thou shalt make the horns of it upon
[33:40] the four corners thereof his horn shall
[33:42] be of the same and thou shalt overlay it
[33:45] with brass
[33:48] may the lord have the blessings to the
[33:50] reading of his word
[33:55] this evening we're going to continue
[33:56] with the series of the tabernacle
[34:00] this is the altar
[34:05] we're going to speak a little bit about
[34:06] the brass altar
[34:10] like i've mentioned in the past
[34:13] like brother branham says bronze
[34:15] represents
[34:16] brass represents judgment
[34:31] for our sins
[34:44] in other words it has the number five
[34:48] and then the height of three cubits
[34:53] now five and three are numbers that we
[34:54] already know
[34:56] right
[34:59] we know that five is grace great
[35:02] and three is perfection
[35:08] now what represents the measurements of
[35:09] this uh furniture is
[35:14] that it's a furniture of grace
[35:17] the perfection and it's a furniture of
[35:20] perfection
[35:22] though it has judgment in it
[35:26] that's because jesus in the cross at
[35:27] calvary
[35:28] is
[36:13] for by one offering he hath perfected
[36:15] forever them that are sanctified
[36:20] because in the brass although the
[36:21] offering was given
[36:24] for
[36:29] and with that offered at the cross at
[36:30] calvary jesus
[36:32] perfect
[36:34] jesus has made us perfect through his
[36:36] blood
[36:53] not by works of righteousness which we
[36:55] have done but according to the mercy he
[36:57] saved us by washing
[36:59] of regeneration and renewing of the holy
[37:01] ghost
[37:05] jesus salvador which he shed abundantly
[37:09] through jesus christ our savior
[37:17] that being justified by his grace we
[37:19] should be made heirs according to the
[37:21] hope of eternal life
[37:24] so now the cross at calvary
[37:28] through the revelation of the new
[37:29] testament
[37:33] shows us that through the salvation that
[37:35] he made at the cross
[37:39] through the offering he made through his
[37:40] own body
[37:42] takes us to his grace
[37:45] and takes us on to perfection
[37:49] like it says in both scriptures that we
[37:50] just read
[37:54] now another part of that brass altar
[37:57] is that it has horns
[38:00] it has four horns
[38:24] and how many knows before we have to go
[38:25] into it
[38:28] four is an earthly number
[38:43] speaks about the earth
[38:46] and it speaks about deliverance yes
[38:49] and that altar can represent
[38:52] that represents the cross at calvary
[38:55] it has horns
[38:57] it has that cross all those benefits
[39:01] or the benefits that come through the
[39:02] crosstalk
[39:06] if you accept what christ did for you
[39:10] it has the ability to give you
[39:11] deliverance
[39:16] significance now what do horns mean
[39:20] we've got to take the message
[39:26] says in the message the breach between
[39:27] the seven church ages and the seven
[39:29] seals
[39:32] seven horns was the seven churches
[39:36] the seven church ages
[39:40] because that was the lamb's protection
[39:44] the horns of the altar
[39:46] gracia they give you grace perfection
[39:49] perfection liberation deliverance
[39:51] protection and protection
[40:09] he furnished it in a certain way
[40:12] because every furniture
[40:14] un significado in particular it has a
[40:17] particular meaning
[40:21] just like the wife of the house
[40:36] temple in his temple
[40:39] in his tabernacle
[40:42] he has things in a certain manner
[40:45] they have a message within it
[40:48] it's not just there to be there
[40:50] is
[41:05] about perfection
[41:07] about deliverance
[41:10] and about protection of the lamb jesus
[41:13] jesus was the lamb
[41:16] that was laying at the cross
[41:35] and david spake unto the lord the words
[41:37] of this song in the day that the lord
[41:39] had delivered him out of the hand of his
[41:41] enemies and out of the hand of saul
[41:46] so you see what it says here in verse
[41:47] one david
[41:49] liberacion david received deliverance
[41:52] in verse two it says
[41:57] [Music]
[41:58] and he said the lord is my rock and my
[42:00] fortress and my deliverer
[42:08] refuge
[42:12] the the god of my rock in him will i
[42:14] trust he is my shield and the horn of my
[42:17] salvation my tower and my refuge my
[42:19] savior thou saves me from violence
[42:25] now in in spanish it says you it is the
[42:27] strength of my salvation
[42:42] it gives
[43:03] the lord is my rock in my fortress and
[43:05] my deliverer my god my strength in whom
[43:07] i will trust my buckler and the horn of
[43:10] my salvation and my high tower
[43:12] in espanol
[43:15] and once again in spanish it says the
[43:16] strength of my salvation
[43:20] and then in english the horn of my
[43:21] salvation
[43:23] foreign that's why
[43:34] [Music]
[43:59] blessed be the lord god of israel for he
[44:01] hath visited and redeemed his people and
[44:03] hath raised up a horn of salvation for
[44:05] us in the house of his servant david
[44:09] now in verse 69
[44:12] it speaks of a person
[44:15] it says the powerful savior
[44:20] but in english it says it's the horn of
[44:21] salvation
[44:23] because christ
[44:27] has horns
[44:30] and those horns give us salvation
[44:34] if
[44:38] [Music]
[45:02] thieves at the crosstalk
[45:04] jesus both at the altar were both at the
[45:06] cross with with jesus
[45:09] they're at the altar with him
[45:11] one accepted
[45:13] the other rejected
[45:16] both to
[45:44] he was justified
[46:15] so the horns offer protection to the
[46:16] person that desires it
[46:20] it offers deliverance to those who can
[46:22] accept it
[46:25] it offers grace and perfection if you
[46:27] desire it
[46:35] and now once again in the breach between
[46:36] the seven church ages and the seven
[46:38] seals
[46:40] paragraph 224
[46:43] significa
[46:45] horn means power to the animal
[46:49] experience
[46:52] and the message experiences preached in
[46:53] 1947
[46:55] branham
[47:08] a horn of healing to the people
[47:13] now because of the offering christ did
[47:15] at the cross
[47:17] brother branham also teaches us jesus
[47:20] jesus to die at the cross
[47:35] it also gives you
[47:37] if you accept it
[47:44] and the brother ramses in the message
[47:45] who do you say this is
[47:50] he had to be born in march or april
[47:54] for he was the lamb
[48:01] and he was uh the male sheep and born
[48:03] under the ram aries yes
[48:10] jesus had to be born in the month of
[48:11] april
[48:14] now the zodiac sign
[48:16] for that month is aries it's aries el
[48:19] carnero the ram
[48:21] carnero now the realm
[48:24] it has horns
[48:27] now christ is our realm
[48:31] if you remember abraham and isaac
[48:37] but god told abraham to offer isaac
[48:40] as a sacrifice
[48:42] they went up the mountain
[48:45] and he already took the wood
[48:49] isaac already had the wood
[48:50] eva
[48:53] and he was ascending the mountain to be
[48:55] killed himself
[49:00] just like christ had to ascend with his
[49:02] own cross to calvary
[49:06] he went there
[49:08] abraham was going to slay him
[49:12] remember that altar is an altar of
[49:14] decisions
[49:41] it's such a determining
[49:42] decision that you're going to continue
[49:45] forward
[49:47] and abraham had determined
[49:50] he was going to kill isis
[49:53] though it hurt his soul
[49:56] that's a decision
[50:10] god sees that it hurts you so much
[50:13] it's killing you so much
[50:16] to leave behind the things you enjoy of
[50:18] the world
[50:21] but because of that sincere decision
[50:23] you're making
[50:38] that you determined to
[50:50] i am crucified along with christ is
[51:06] just like jesus made the decision in
[51:07] gethsemane
[51:10] that he would go
[51:12] so it hurt him so much
[51:14] to make that decision
[51:17] he decided to go
[51:20] that's
[51:35] so abraham decided he'd kill his own son
[51:40] the one that he waited for for 25 years
[51:44] and then he was going to kill him
[51:47] that's a decision you have to make
[51:51] and it's going to hurt
[51:54] the more you're in the world
[51:57] and when god finally calls you
[51:59] it's going to hurt you
[52:02] to leave all that
[52:19] [Music]
[52:30] it has protection and deliverance gracia
[52:32] grace perfection perfection
[52:35] and healing
[52:39] it's a place of refuge
[53:18] you remember the woman that was caught
[53:20] in the act of adultery
[53:23] jesus the bible says that the men they
[53:25] dragged her to jesus
[53:29] and those men wanted jesus to apply the
[53:31] law
[53:33] meaning that she committed adultery
[53:37] the law said she needed to be stoned
[53:43] but also within the law there was a
[53:44] little bit of grace
[53:47] so in the old testament
[53:51] if someone killed someone else
[53:53] is
[53:56] and in some way it wasn't intentional
[53:59] it was not the intention to kill that
[54:01] person but i want to see my persona but
[54:03] nonetheless they killed the person
[54:06] god could also see that in
[54:48] and if that man decides that your case
[54:50] is
[54:51] [Music]
[55:42] [Music]
[55:59] from the people that are in search of
[56:00] killing
[56:16] now if a person couldn't reach the city
[56:17] of refuge because it was too far
[56:19] um
[56:22] because there were six cities
[56:26] if you couldn't reach any one of those
[56:27] cities
[56:36] and you can grab hold of the horns at
[56:38] the altar
[56:40] if the city was too far
[56:55] and you'll receive the same benefits of
[56:56] protection
[57:01] like as if you were in the city of
[57:02] refuge
[57:06] brother branham says horn represents a
[57:07] kingdom entonces protection
[57:25] now brother branham says in the message
[57:27] letting off the pressure
[57:32] now the people could come to this city
[57:33] of refuge
[57:37] if accidentally he done something wrong
[57:40] he didn't mean to do
[57:43] it
[57:44] he would go to the city of refuge and go
[57:46] to the gates
[57:50] the gatekeeper would ask him why he's
[57:52] coming qualia
[57:54] what was his idea of coming
[57:58] then his case was pleated
[58:01] and when his case was pleated in la
[58:03] puerta at the gates
[58:06] and
[58:20] as a place of refuge
[58:24] then the enemy could not get him
[58:27] and if he lied
[58:29] and done wrong
[58:32] come into the city of refuge
[58:44] [Music]
[58:47] to drag him from the altar and kill him
[58:51] because you've got to be sincere
[58:55] when you come to the altar
[58:57] when you come to christ
[59:00] you come to the city of refuge
[59:16] to drag him from the altar and kill him
[59:19] yes sir because he was guilty
[59:23] premeditated
[59:26] and he had to be punished
[59:30] now if he meant to do it
[59:33] well he had to stand to the
[59:34] circumstances
[59:40] but there's no chance for him if he did
[59:41] it willfully
[59:45] remember you've also got to come to the
[59:46] altar and die it's an altar
[59:48] it's an altar of decisions
[59:53] that sees your decision
[59:57] and he's the one that determines if you
[59:59] were sincere
[1:00:03] that determines if he accepts your your
[1:00:06] repentance or not
[1:00:11] saying
[1:00:12] brother and there's two classes of
[1:00:14] people today
[1:00:16] may i say this
[1:00:20] there's men and women in the world
[1:00:22] today
[1:00:25] is
[1:00:32] there's men and women in this world
[1:00:34] today that don't want to sin
[1:00:37] i feel sorry for them
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:01:30] an example of that is in first kings
[1:01:32] chapter one
[1:01:34] verse one
[1:01:36] the bible says
[1:01:42] now when king david was stricken in
[1:01:44] years they covered him with clothes but
[1:01:46] he got no heat
[1:01:49] verse 5 says
[1:02:04] exalted himself saying i will be king
[1:02:07] and he prepared him chariots and
[1:02:08] horsemen and fifty men to run before him
[1:02:22] and his father had not displeased him at
[1:02:24] any time and saying why hast thou done
[1:02:26] so and he also was a very godly man and
[1:02:28] his mother bear him after absalom
[1:02:39] and here conferred with joab the son of
[1:02:41] zariah and with abbathar the priest and
[1:02:45] they following adenija help
[1:03:00] the son of jehoda jehoiada jehoiada and
[1:03:03] nathan the prophet and shemi and rai and
[1:03:06] the mighty men which belonged to david
[1:03:08] were not without nigeria
[1:03:12] animals
[1:03:26] and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
[1:03:28] zahaleth which by anne rigel and called
[1:03:31] his brethren the king's sons and all the
[1:03:34] men of judah the king's servants
[1:03:42] but nathan the prophet and banaya and
[1:03:44] the mighty men and solomon his brother
[1:03:46] he called not
[1:03:49] so now here's a man
[1:03:55] he self-proclaimed himself as king
[1:04:04] he started to do things that were
[1:04:05] allowed because he was a king
[1:04:08] he started to have feasts
[1:04:10] he started
[1:05:29] feared because of solomon and arose and
[1:05:31] went and cut hold of the horns of the
[1:05:33] altar
[1:05:34] is
[1:05:49] and it was told solomon saying behold
[1:05:51] adenija feared king solomon for lo he
[1:05:54] hath caught hold of the horns of the
[1:05:55] altar saying let king solomon swear unto
[1:05:58] me today that he will not slay his
[1:05:59] servant with the sword
[1:06:02] beneficious
[1:06:16] solomon sent
[1:06:26] was holding on to the horns of the altar
[1:06:29] he could not touch him our
[1:06:45] if he will show himself a worthy man
[1:06:46] there shall not a hair of him fall to
[1:06:48] the earth but if wickedness shall be
[1:06:50] found in him he shall die
[1:06:54] remember it's a sincere decision
[1:06:57] you'd make alveneer al-altar
[1:07:12] so king solomon sent and they brought
[1:07:14] him down from the altar and he came and
[1:07:16] bowed himself to king solomon and
[1:07:18] solomon said unto him go to thine house
[1:07:23] before he let go of the horns
[1:07:26] he
[1:08:22] he says
[1:08:54] that this will be the night that you'll
[1:08:55] reward and pour down your holy spirit
[1:08:59] upon this convention
[1:09:01] and there may not be and it may not be
[1:09:03] uh this is frolic obrin or jumping
[1:09:06] around
[1:09:11] but a weeping and the crying and
[1:09:13] repenting
[1:09:18] holding onto the horns of the altar
[1:09:23] while we see judgments rolling beneath
[1:09:25] us tonight
[1:09:31] i pray sincerely as i know how in the
[1:09:32] name of jesus christ
[1:09:34] all pentecostal pentecost
[1:09:37] run for your life
[1:09:41] flee to the horns of the altar
[1:09:47] and cry out before it's too late
[1:09:53] for an hour will come where you can cry
[1:09:55] and it'll do you no good
[1:09:58] that altar experience
[1:10:13] where people are jumping and they're
[1:10:15] happy
[1:10:16] that comes afterwards
[1:10:19] but first comes the bra
[1:10:24] where you have to sincerely repent yes i
[1:10:26] will fail it's something ugly muy fail
[1:10:28] very
[1:10:41] now in the
[1:10:42] tabernacle
[1:10:44] estan los atrios
[1:10:46] there are the outer courts
[1:10:49] and then the holy place
[1:10:51] and the holiest of holy amen amen
[1:11:03] and we could say that the holiest of
[1:11:05] holi estade cortina is behind this
[1:11:07] curtain here
[1:11:09] our lemano brand is
[1:11:37] it's not the outer courts
[1:11:40] but it's in the holy place
[1:11:44] and it's a gold altar noise
[1:11:46] it's not a brass is the oro it's of gold
[1:11:49] yes
[1:11:50] and this altar
[1:12:44] and another angel came and stood at the
[1:12:46] altar having a golden sensor and there
[1:12:49] was given unto him much incense that he
[1:12:51] should offer it with prayers of all the
[1:12:53] saints upon the golden altar which was
[1:12:55] before the throne
[1:12:57] of delance
[1:13:00] um
[1:13:04] and the smoke of the incense which came
[1:13:06] with the prayers of the saints ascended
[1:13:08] up before god out of the angel's hand
[1:13:12] represents
[1:13:13] now incense represents prayer
[1:13:45] it's justification
[1:13:47] sanctification
[1:13:49] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:51] we already know this
[1:13:54] is god also shows these three stages
[1:14:01] through the three different places of
[1:14:02] the temple los atrios the outer courts
[1:14:06] the holy place
[1:14:07] and then the holiest of holi
[1:14:09] yes
[1:14:11] and that uh
[1:14:42] of protection
[1:14:46] you can find them
[1:14:48] through prayers
[1:14:52] if you can only be sincere
[1:15:22] you've
[1:15:35] when you're before the altar
[1:15:38] aura
[1:15:40] now zechariah el padre de juana batista
[1:15:43] the father of john the baptist
[1:15:46] he was there at the temple
[1:15:48] gabriel
[1:15:49] when the archangel gabriel appeared to
[1:15:51] him
[1:15:53] and the bible says in luke 1.
[1:15:56] the angel appeared
[1:15:59] on the right side
[1:16:02] of the altar of incense
[1:16:34] of the altar of incense
[1:16:37] i don't have the quote
[1:16:40] but brother branham says that angel
[1:16:42] queben
[1:16:43] esconel that would come to the meetings
[1:16:44] with him
[1:17:00] what happened to brother branham
[1:17:02] it happened in zechariah just
[1:17:06] right at the altar of incense
[1:17:09] in offering prayer
[1:17:11] the angel was right there
[1:17:14] now that gold altar represents
[1:17:16] sanctification it represents
[1:17:18] sanctification
[1:17:23] now the message god has a provided way
[1:17:28] in 1954.
[1:17:33] brother brown says the brass speaks of
[1:17:34] divine judgment
[1:17:37] on the brazen altar
[1:17:40] where the beast's bodies were burned
[1:17:54] three o'clock in the afternoon
[1:18:09] every jew in palestine
[1:18:13] fell to his feet
[1:18:15] and his hands towards heaven
[1:18:20] and as the smoke ascended
[1:18:24] his prayers went with it
[1:18:27] now this was with the brass altar
[1:18:31] where all the people could see the smoke
[1:18:34] and when they saw smoke
[1:18:37] they'd offer their prayers
[1:18:44] where there was a incense altar
[1:18:49] where they would offer that that smoke
[1:18:51] yes eso represented
[1:19:06] verse 36.
[1:19:20] and thou shalt offer every day of
[1:19:21] bullock for a sin offering and thou
[1:19:23] shalt cleanse the altar when thou has
[1:19:25] made an atonement for it and thou shalt
[1:19:27] anoint it to sanctify it
[1:19:31] foreign
[1:19:39] seven days shall thou make an atonement
[1:19:41] for the altar and sanctify it and it
[1:19:43] shall be an altar most holy whatsoever
[1:19:46] touches the altar shall be holy
[1:19:48] is
[1:19:55] now this is that which thou shalt offer
[1:19:56] upon the altar two lambs of the first
[1:19:59] year day by day continually
[1:20:20] and the other lamb thou shalt offer at
[1:20:22] the evening
[1:20:23] juan bautista presented
[1:20:26] john the baptist presented the sacrifice
[1:20:28] in the morning
[1:21:01] and there's the evening sacrifice
[1:21:04] john the baptist william branham and
[1:21:05] william branham
[1:21:09] i'm going to show it to you
[1:21:22] here's elijah i believe before the 400
[1:21:24] prophets false prophets the false
[1:21:26] prophets
[1:21:38] so ahab sent unto all the children of
[1:21:40] israel and gather the prophets together
[1:21:42] unto mount carmel
[1:21:46] remember what i told you about the
[1:21:47] alternate
[1:21:48] the altar
[1:21:50] disalter is also an altar of decision
[1:22:09] ye between two opinions
[1:22:12] if the lord be god follow him
[1:22:17] if baal then follow him
[1:22:20] and the people answered him not a word
[1:23:02] to the people i even only remain a
[1:23:05] prophet of the lord but baal's prophet
[1:23:07] are 450 men
[1:23:11] yes
[1:23:24] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[1:23:26] and let them choose one bullock for
[1:23:28] themselves and cut it in pieces and lay
[1:23:30] it on the wood and put no fire under and
[1:23:32] i will dress the other bullock and lay
[1:23:34] it on the wood and put no fire under it
[1:23:41] and call you the name of your gods
[1:23:45] and i will call in the name of the lord
[1:23:51] and the god that answered by fire let
[1:23:53] him be god
[1:23:57] and all the people answered and said it
[1:23:58] is well spoken entonces
[1:24:27] they'd burn it
[1:24:42] and
[1:25:09] who is the real god and he's with this
[1:25:11] prophet
[1:25:14] he says verse 26
[1:25:19] and they took the bullock that was given
[1:25:20] them and they dressed
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:26:21] is
[1:26:27] and cut themselves after the manor with
[1:26:29] knives and lancets till the blood gushed
[1:26:31] out upon them
[1:26:36] and the midday passed and they still
[1:26:38] kept crying out hasta laura
[1:26:41] in sacrificial until the time of
[1:26:43] offering the evening sacrifice
[1:26:46] in english and i really love how it says
[1:26:48] in english
[1:26:53] until offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:26:58] this specifically happened
[1:27:03] when elijah was going to offer his
[1:27:05] sacrifice
[1:27:08] it was in the evening time
[1:27:11] not in the morning juan bautista
[1:27:14] john and john the baptist had his day
[1:27:16] pero
[1:27:26] in the evening time
[1:27:44] there was neither voice nor any to
[1:27:46] answer no any that regarded entonces
[1:27:50] and elijah said unto all the people
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:54] come near unto me
[1:27:57] and all the people came near to him
[1:28:03] and he repaired the altar of the lord
[1:28:04] that was broken down elias estaba
[1:28:07] restaurant elijah was restoring
[1:28:10] branham what did brother branham come
[1:28:12] forth
[1:28:26] is and elijah took 12 stones according
[1:28:30] to the number of the tribes of the sons
[1:28:31] of jacob upon whom the lord
[1:28:33] upon whom the word of the lord came
[1:28:35] saying israel shall be thy name
[1:28:40] in the number
[1:28:42] and with the stones he built an altar in
[1:28:44] the name of the lord
[1:28:49] and he made a trench about the altar
[1:28:53] as great as would contain two measures
[1:28:55] of seed
[1:28:57] and he put the wood in order
[1:29:00] and cut the bullock in pieces
[1:29:03] and laid them upon the wood
[1:29:06] cuatro canton
[1:29:10] and he said fill four barrels of water
[1:29:11] and pour it upon the bird's sacrifice
[1:29:14] and upon the woods
[1:29:17] and he said do it a second time
[1:29:19] and they did it the second time
[1:29:33] and the water ran about the altar and
[1:29:35] filled the trench also with water
[1:29:50] is
[1:30:04] of the temple
[1:30:17] because the fountain and the brass altar
[1:30:19] esta los atrios
[1:30:21] they're in the outer courts
[1:30:25] and those outer courts represent
[1:30:26] justification
[1:30:29] that's why we should repent
[1:30:33] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:30:34] jesus christ elias elijah
[1:30:38] justification shows us justification
[1:30:42] through repentance
[1:30:45] and the baptismal water
[1:31:01] sacrifice and elijah the prophet came
[1:31:03] near and said

[1:39:46] pearly-like white line
[1:39:52] that would run right into the doors of
