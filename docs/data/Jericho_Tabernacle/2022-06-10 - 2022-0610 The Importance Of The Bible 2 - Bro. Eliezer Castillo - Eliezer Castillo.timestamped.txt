[29:31] there's many people out in the world you

[30:20] and say amen
[30:22] for this amen
[30:26] joshua 1 7-8
[30:31] he says only be thou strong and very
[30:34] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[30:38] do according to do all to all the law
[30:41] which moses my servant commanded thee
[30:44] turn not from it to the right hand nor

[31:08] i like how he says
[31:10] that you observe to do all according to
[31:13] the law this is
[31:19] then verse 8 it says this book of the
[31:22] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[31:25] but shall thou sh thou but shalt thou
[31:28] meditate
[31:30] therein and night

[32:07] heavenly father we have read your holy

[32:37] person and may speak to each and every
[32:39] person as the song says lord speak my
[32:42] lord.

[33:02] pray
[33:05] amen and amen amen
[33:07] amen you may be seated
[33:10] i would like to
[33:11] continue
[33:12] my little thought that i had for the
[33:14] young people
[33:19] of the importance of your bible the
[33:22] importance
[33:23] i'm not going to ask who has their bible
[33:25] but every single person should be
[33:28] with their sword today
[33:34] because this this is where eternal life
[33:37] is at america
[33:40] this should be
[33:41] a book that is the most worn down in our
[33:43] homes
[33:48] don't worry when you buy a bible
[34:06] if there's something that that raises in
[34:08] your heart write it down circle it
[34:10] highlight it in your bibles
[34:17] and this contains all the promises of
[34:19] god
[34:22] all the promises that you ask the lord
[34:24] every single day
[34:29] the things that you ask of lord give me
[34:31] strength for today lord uh
[34:36] lord please help my um my family today
[34:39] lord senor
[34:41] my family
[34:42] lord i have an exam today please lord be
[34:45] with me
[34:57] you'll all find all the answers here in
[35:00] this bible
[35:14] we encourage everyone to read their
[35:16] bible every day
[35:20] whether it's a few verses or a few
[35:21] chapters a day
[35:27] if you go to work you could play an
[35:28] audio version of the bible
[35:35] but that you may read the bible and see
[35:38] what's in there
[35:42] you let a person feed on the word for a
[35:44] month
[35:48] you'll see how they change the way of
[35:50] talking
[35:54] i'm not going to say his name but i
[35:56] spoke to a brother
[36:00] and uh he had a very unfortunate event
[36:03] [Music]
[36:05] and i called him
[36:07] and um like if it was anybody else in
[36:10] the world
[36:22] how
[36:24] it's going to affect their way of living
[36:28] that's a regular person and that's
[36:30] normal
[36:33] but when i started talking to him
[36:37] he said you just
[36:38] wouldn't believe it brother you lie
[36:41] no no
[36:43] the testimony in this testimony
[36:46] he said how god he helped me out so much
[36:50] and when when it looked like uh the
[36:53] worst was going to happen
[36:57] god he was the one that healed him
[37:01] and though though he was still in a not
[37:05] a good condition
[37:09] he was praising the lord for the miracle
[37:11] that he saw
[37:16] he saw the miracle in his situation
[37:35] the way of talking will be different
[37:39] you won't be talking about your property
[37:43] you won't talk about how downcast you
[37:45] are
[38:00] because when you read the bible
[38:11] he that heareth the word that's where
[38:13] faith comes faith cometh by the hearing
[38:15] of the word of the lord
[38:27] and allow the lord to give you the tape
[38:29] or give you the faith
[38:34] just read the word every day
[38:37] talk to the lord every day
[38:41] today i want to talk about um about
[38:43] searching the scriptures
[38:56] if you have a desire or you need
[38:58] something read your bibles
[39:03] now i i'm especially um
[39:06] targeting this to the young people all
[39:08] right
[39:11] so you can understand the grace and the
[39:14] goodness of god
[39:18] now reading your bible every day is
[39:21] different than searching the scriptures
[39:31] and that's a good thing yes
[39:33] but you could just read about the bible
[39:35] and forget about what you read the next
[39:37] day
[39:39] bible
[40:23] it's on purpose
[40:25] every comma you see in the bible
[40:30] it wasn't put there by accident
[40:34] there was there was a great divine
[40:36] design
[40:45] how do you say uh
[40:47] all the names of the books of the bible
[40:50] or all the chronology of the bible
[40:56] i'll you know
[40:58] i could testify when i was young
[41:02] i just wanted to skip that part
[41:17] yeah and and and so and so we got
[41:22] and all these big words and it's just it
[41:25] was something that it's like well
[41:27] is there any purpose in this
[41:36] there's there's uh treasures in the
[41:39] genealogies in the chronologies
[41:45] there's mysteries in there
[41:49] now i want to um
[41:50] go to a scripture in matthew 5 18.
[41:57] if you'd like to turn with me
[42:00] matthew 5 18.
[42:05] i just want to take my time today
[42:10] and just uh talk to you for a little bit
[42:12] uh
[42:24] this is jesus talking to the the to the
[42:27] people this
[42:28] is verily i say unto you till heaven and
[42:33] earth
[42:34] pass away
[42:35] one jot or one tittle shall not
[42:38] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[42:41] all be fulfilled
[42:59] all heavens and earth shall pass away
[43:01] but this word
[43:05] shall not pass away
[43:08] now what is what are these words jot and
[43:10] tittle
[43:25] and tittles have to do with the letters
[43:27] and pen strokes in the hebrew writing
[43:38] brothers if you want to um put up the
[43:40] slide
[43:41] transparency
[43:42] i want to show you how they look
[43:48] so uh the jot la
[43:50] it's the tenth letter in the hebrew
[43:52] alphabet
[43:56] and it's the smallest letter
[44:00] that's the smallest letter in the hebrew
[44:02] alphabet
[44:05] the jot is is related to our modern um
[44:08] english word iota
[44:16] it means a very small
[44:18] amount
[44:23] so it's the
[44:24] smallest letter in the hebrew
[44:27] alphabet
[44:32] now to the next slide
[44:45] i don't know but maybe you're asking
[44:47] well why is he showing me all of this
[45:04] is a letter extension
[45:06] a pen stroke that can differentiate a
[45:08] hebrew word from another
[45:10] until
[45:11] extension
[45:13] is
[45:19] so i don't know if they can bring it up
[45:21] but
[45:22] one one of the word
[45:23] or one of the letters
[45:27] it's called resh
[45:31] and it it's like this
[45:33] yes this is the form and the corner it's
[45:36] a very smooth corner you just do one pin
[45:39] stroke on it
[45:44] then there's another letter
[45:47] that's called delete
[45:50] and that one is made with two pen
[45:51] strokes
[45:55] it looks very similar
[45:58] but if that corner you go like that and
[46:01] you stop and then you go down
[46:07] it looks like a backwards seven but
[46:08] you're using two pen strokes to do it
[46:12] is
[46:40] and this little part right here yes
[46:43] that's called a tittle
[46:45] and that
[46:46] differentiates the two different letters
[46:54] jesus says
[47:00] not one jot nor one tittle in no wise
[47:03] pass from the law till it all be
[47:05] fulfilled
[47:21] [Applause]
[47:36] the fulfillment is inevitable
[47:39] inevitable even the smallest letter of
[47:42] the law will be fulfilled
[47:46] even the smallest pin stroke of the
[47:49] prophets will be accomplished
[48:01] not even one smallest detail of god's
[48:04] law will disappear until its purpose is
[48:07] achieved
[48:15] in english a giant tittle is um just
[48:17] best
[48:18] described as a t
[48:20] the crossing of a t or a dotting of an
[48:22] eye
[48:25] tilde
[48:31] so why am i saying all this
[48:35] because god's word is on purpose
[48:40] it's intentional it's intentional every
[48:43] letter
[48:44] every number
[48:46] every
[49:00] it's a deliberate design
[49:03] intentional to wear
[49:06] thousands and thousands of years before
[49:08] christ
[49:13] god was already speaking about him
[49:15] through the prophets
[49:19] god already spoke about the bride
[49:22] through
[49:22] the old testament
[49:27] god went beyond space and time
[49:33] he went outside and went into eternity
[49:39] and created this book
[49:42] that that every single prophecy
[49:45] has been or will be fulfilled
[49:51] it's the beginning and the end
[49:55] so then how should we approach the
[49:57] scripture
[49:59] reading the bible is good
[50:03] but but i think for every single person
[50:09] we need to search the scriptures
[50:26] there was a great preacher named dwight
[50:28] moody
[50:30] dwight moody he said if a friend were to
[50:32] see me searching around the building
[50:55] i'm sure he'd walk away and think i was
[50:56] very foolish that's what he said
[51:02] but if he said but if i said
[51:04] i lost a dollar yo foreign
[51:12] see whenever you read the scriptures
[51:15] with intention
[51:19] read the scriptures like you're looking
[51:21] for something
[51:25] every single promise is there in the
[51:27] scriptures for you
[51:31] every single thing
[51:33] in acts 17 11 it says
[51:37] these were more noble than those in
[51:39] thessalonica
[51:42] in that they received the word with all
[51:44] readiness of mind and searched the
[51:47] scriptures daily whether those things
[51:49] were
[51:50] so yes
[52:02] don't allow church to be your only
[52:06] substance of eating no permit
[52:12] don't allow the
[52:14] the preacher to be your only source of
[52:16] food
[52:21] see back in the day only
[52:24] only the high priest could
[52:27] read these only the priests
[52:34] they were the only ones with access to
[52:36] the word of god
[52:41] and the people were in the mercy of them
[52:48] and sometimes they didn't have really
[52:50] good agendas
[52:54] a lot of times they wanted to twist the
[52:56] words so that it can be for their
[52:58] benefit
[53:11] i'm sure if you don't have your bible
[53:12] here today
[53:16] you have it on your phone
[53:18] you could take it wherever you want to
[53:20] go
[53:22] and you have the eternal words of god
[53:28] and if there's something that maybe you
[53:30] have a question about that maybe a
[53:32] preacher preached
[53:37] look for it
[53:39] that's your freedom
[53:53] you know i have a really precious
[53:54] brother
[54:07] because i want somebody to go and look
[54:10] for it in the bible
[54:11] themselves
[54:16] that's your right
[54:18] god gave revelation to everybody not
[54:21] just to ministers
[54:25] amen amen this is this is for everybody
[54:29] this is so that you can see what
[54:30] promises you have in the bible
[54:32] especially
[54:36] in proverbs 2 1 to 6 it says and
[54:39] proverbial
[54:41] says this he says my son if thou receive
[54:45] word um receive my words and hide my
[54:48] commandments with thee
[54:50] recive
[54:55] so thou inclined thy near unto wisdom
[54:58] and apply thine heart to understanding
[55:06] if you thou christ after knowledge and
[55:09] lift up thy voice for understanding
[55:15] if thou seekest her as silver and
[55:18] searches her for the hidden treasures
[55:25] then thou shalt understand the fear of
[55:28] the lord and find knowledge of god
[55:30] entonces
[55:35] for the lord giveth wisdom out of his
[55:38] mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
[55:45] when you search the scriptures
[55:49] you're searching hidden treasures
[55:56] brother there's great places to go into
[55:58] adventures
[56:15] you can go to many adventures in the
[56:16] world
[56:20] but the greatest adventure
[56:23] is hidden in the bible
[56:26] there's love stories in the bible
[56:39] there's stories of anything you like in
[56:42] the bible
[56:46] my favorite story was um the story of
[56:48] david
[56:52] when i first gave my heart to the lord
[56:56] oh i read
[57:02] to see how great the story of david was
[57:08] he was just a little shepherd boy hello
[57:12] and i think we could all relate to this
[57:16] but he was the one that nobody wanted
[57:18] right
[57:20] now
[57:21] so so we sometimes we can relate to
[57:23] these characters
[57:39] and you could see the elevation of his
[57:42] life as you continue to read his life
[57:50] that's all in the scriptures
[58:04] some people would would teach
[58:06] their children
[58:10] that the west side of the mississippi
[58:12] river
[58:14] del rio mississippi was the great
[58:15] american desert
[58:18] american it was a barren land
[58:23] but when they first
[58:27] struck
[58:28] that hard ground with a pickaxe
[58:35] they took out hundreds of millions of
[58:38] dollars worth of silver ellios
[58:46] they realized that the west wasn't just
[58:48] the barren land
[58:54] a lot of the western states are the
[58:56] richest mineral states in the united
[58:59] states
[59:05] but they didn't know they just saw it
[59:07] and they're like oh no and it was
[59:09] and they said no it's a barren land
[59:39] you know that's a large portion of the
[59:41] bible yes
[59:44] many of us are living on just a few
[59:47] scriptures of the bible
[59:52] scriptures that maybe the prophet said
[59:57] and we sit there and we live on those
[59:58] scriptures
[1:00:04] you know there's scriptures that a
[1:00:06] preacher might preach and they said oh
[1:00:08] man this is my scripture
[1:00:11] uh
[1:00:15] but there is a large portion of the
[1:00:17] bible
[1:00:20] that maybe maybe doesn't seem like it's
[1:00:23] understandable
[1:00:26] yet there's life and there's hidden
[1:00:28] treasures in there
[1:00:33] brother branham says this yeah
[1:00:36] in the message god keeps his word
[1:00:40] well what's the matter with many
[1:00:42] believers
[1:00:45] they just take somebody's word for it
[1:00:50] and they don't search around to see what
[1:00:52] their book happens
[1:00:54] is
[1:01:01] they don't see where their book what
[1:01:03] their book
[1:01:06] is
[1:01:08] every promise in this book is yours
[1:01:14] no promise um outside of the book but in
[1:01:17] the book them promises is yours
[1:01:20] foreign
[1:01:27] well now if i had a big arcade and was
[1:01:30] given to me
[1:01:35] i wouldn't say i own this arcade
[1:01:40] but i'm just foolish enough to get
[1:01:42] around and see what i own
[1:01:49] i like to pull out this drawer and look
[1:01:52] in it
[1:01:55] and look up on this shelf and look and
[1:01:58] and looks a little too high and get me a
[1:02:01] step ladder
[1:02:32] when you became a christian
[1:02:34] christian all these promises became
[1:02:36] yours
[1:02:39] from cover to cover this
[1:02:42] from the words that say holy bible
[1:02:57] once you begin to realize what the word
[1:02:59] is
[1:03:14] and those were the same words that
[1:03:16] created heavens and earth
[1:03:22] when he said let there be
[1:03:25] a there was a foe and everything that
[1:03:28] you see that is created
[1:03:32] was created by the word of the lord
[1:03:36] and now all of those words
[1:03:39] they have become your promises
[1:04:11] he said i realized that every promise of
[1:04:13] the word was mine
[1:04:19] if i seen a promise i couldn't get to
[1:04:21] casa yo
[1:04:23] de cayona promesa la cuando
[1:04:53] [Applause]
[1:05:06] the devil will try to rob it from you
[1:05:10] fellowship is yours everything is yours
[1:05:12] the world is yours
[1:05:19] you own it all it belongs to you it's
[1:05:21] god's promise
[1:05:25] if your house goes in flames
[1:05:30] it's gonna hurt
[1:05:32] but remember you possess all things
[1:05:48] if
[1:06:01] remember you are a possessor of all
[1:06:03] things
[1:06:08] i remember they asked brother branham
[1:06:09] the question um
[1:06:13] how can a christian get deeper in love
[1:06:15] with god
[1:06:54] and when you read it that's when you
[1:06:56] begin to get closer and closer to him
[1:07:02] if you search from genesis to
[1:07:04] revelations
[1:07:08] you'll begin to see all of your promises
[1:07:10] of god
[1:07:25] remember when philip found nathanael
[1:07:28] philippe
[1:07:30] praying under the tree
[1:07:34] he said we found him
[1:07:37] we found the one we were looking for
[1:07:41] the one the scripture has been talking
[1:07:43] about the whole time we found him
[1:07:45] finally
[1:07:51] he said jesus of nazareth the son of
[1:07:54] joseph jesus
[1:07:57] jose phillip said felipe
[1:08:00] can anything good come from nazareth
[1:08:04] he was endowed
[1:08:06] that was a question
[1:08:08] sometimes we have questions
[1:08:11] does anything good come from nazareth
[1:08:16] philip said the best thing he could say
[1:08:21] he said well let me see i don't know uh
[1:08:24] let me try to explain it to you
[1:08:29] he said come and see
[1:08:31] he said go and look for it yourself
[1:08:35] and prove him yourself
[1:08:38] and see if that's the person that you
[1:08:41] were looking for
[1:08:45] finally he found him finally
[1:08:48] he found the verse he found the
[1:08:50] scripture he found this the
[1:08:53] the chapter
[1:08:55] in control
[1:08:58] and he said behold a man that there is
[1:09:01] no guile in him
[1:09:06] he said wow how do you know
[1:09:10] he said in israel he said how do you
[1:09:12] know who i am
[1:09:16] he said i saw you when you were praying
[1:09:17] under the tree
[1:09:31] this is the one i've been studying this
[1:09:32] is the one i've been searching
[1:09:39] verse 51
[1:09:42] john 1 51
[1:09:45] jesus tells them
[1:09:46] jesus
[1:09:51] he says jesus said unto him because i
[1:09:53] said unto you i saw you under the fig
[1:09:55] tree believeth thou
[1:09:57] shalt
[1:09:58] thou shalt see greater things than these
[1:10:02] responders
[1:10:08] he said
[1:10:10] he sayeth unto him verily verily i say
[1:10:12] unto you hereafter you shall see heaven
[1:10:14] open and the angels of god descending
[1:10:17] ascending and descending upon the son of
[1:10:19] man
[1:10:27] because he went and he proved
[1:10:50] i remember when he was there being
[1:10:52] judged by pilate
[1:11:08] even to the point where god was was
[1:11:10] dealing with him in his household
[1:11:17] and his wife was having terrible dreams
[1:11:22] and whenever he went and stood in front
[1:11:25] of all the people
[1:11:29] he said i've searched them
[1:11:33] and i have found no fault in this man
[1:11:52] you'll find the thing that you're
[1:11:54] wondering about
[1:11:57] you'll find your questions
[1:12:01] because it's all in the word
[1:12:04] there should be an urgency in reading
[1:12:05] our bibles
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:11] now i just want to give you a little bit
[1:12:13] of examples here uh
[1:12:16] now
[1:12:17] in
[1:12:18] a christian our specialty should be the
[1:12:21] word aura cristiano estrada especially
[1:12:26] right as a christian you should know the
[1:12:28] word verdacomo cricianos
[1:12:31] now the first thing is are we saved our
[1:12:34] la primero says
[1:12:36] and also
[1:12:38] being born again is better than the
[1:12:40] knowledge of greek in hebrew
[1:12:47] so we can look and we can get things and
[1:12:49] knowledge and all of this from the bible
[1:12:51] entonces
[1:12:57] but the first thing you want to make
[1:12:59] sure
[1:13:03] that you are saved and you are born
[1:13:05] again
[1:13:07] that's that's the first thing
[1:13:11] what does the bible say what did jesus
[1:13:13] say
[1:13:15] he said uh
[1:13:17] if you're not born of the spirit
[1:13:20] you can't even see the kingdom of god
[1:13:27] so being born you god is able to show
[1:13:30] you and reveal things to you
[1:13:36] when you go in your room
[1:13:39] pray
[1:13:40] pray before you study
[1:13:44] we pray whenever we we're about to open
[1:13:46] up the word here in church
[1:13:52] do the same thing in your home
[1:13:55] if you're at your your home and
[1:13:57] everybody else is doing shut yourself in
[1:13:59] your in your room
[1:14:04] put your phone on airplane mode
[1:14:09] and pray
[1:14:12] god wrote this word intentionally
[1:14:18] let's read with intentions
[1:14:22] let's read with revelation
[1:14:24] with
[1:14:25] walking into his presence
[1:14:39] allow the spirit to
[1:14:52] the bible says don't only be hears of
[1:14:54] the word but all but doers also
[1:15:01] whenever we read and we read and we read
[1:15:06] then go and and obey and act on the
[1:15:09] words
[1:15:15] the greatest adventure is the bible
[1:15:22] i'm going to give you some examples did
[1:15:23] you ever notice that there's no chapter
[1:15:25] in baptism
[1:15:33] you can't find a specific chapter just
[1:15:39] that specializes and speaks nothing or
[1:15:41] only
[1:15:43] baptism
[1:15:45] or specifically
[1:15:48] or receiving the holy ghost there's no
[1:15:50] chapter of just specifically the holy
[1:15:52] ghost
[1:15:57] no these are key
[1:15:59] thoughts and key ideas
[1:16:04] that are spread throughout the whole
[1:16:06] entire book of the bible
[1:16:11] and then you have to go and you have to
[1:16:13] search for them
[1:16:17] you have to go and you have to begin to
[1:16:19] see the big picture
[1:16:24] of of
[1:16:25] baptism or the holy ghost
[1:16:29] it's you can go and you can find them
[1:16:33] there's ways to study your bible now i'm
[1:16:35] just giving you ideas it's how you're
[1:16:37] led to do it
[1:16:42] there's a topical way of of reading or
[1:16:45] topical studies uh
[1:16:55] if there's a city that you see in the
[1:16:57] bible you can go and you begin to see
[1:17:00] the history and read it all in the bible
[1:17:08] there's themes that show the bigger
[1:17:10] picture
[1:17:13] an overall meaning to that reveal why a
[1:17:16] story matters in the bible
[1:17:22] there's word studies
[1:17:26] there's a study of of um the word love
[1:17:32] well we know because the prophet
[1:17:33] revealed to us that and and he showed us
[1:17:37] with the greek words
[1:17:42] that there's two words for love okay
[1:17:47] there's a gapo and there's ophelia
[1:17:51] so if you could get a word study and
[1:17:53] just study that word
[1:17:57] and find what that word means
[1:18:02] there is also a way of studying
[1:18:04] dispensations
[1:18:08] you could study from from adam's time
[1:18:11] all the way down to abraham and study
[1:18:13] how it works different times and
[1:18:15] timelines
[1:18:51] you know there's there's a topic that
[1:18:54] has really interested me
[1:18:57] that i i study without um intending to
[1:19:01] preach on it
[1:19:04] but there's the five women in the
[1:19:07] genealogy
[1:19:10] that's very interesting
[1:19:13] because you begin to think if you start
[1:19:15] to look at how genealogies work it was
[1:19:18] only the men that were mentioned
[1:19:27] but then in
[1:19:28] i believe it was matthew they mentioned
[1:19:31] five women in that genealogy
[1:19:46] and maybe how it types the bribe
[1:19:51] and you could start seeing the way they
[1:19:53] lived their lives
[1:19:57] what i've noticed is
[1:19:58] all of every single one of them had
[1:20:00] something to do with protecting the seed
[1:20:16] but you can find it all there
[1:20:20] now um
[1:20:22] the best book to read from is the king
[1:20:24] james version
[1:20:29] of version king james for for me
[1:20:31] personally
[1:20:35] for me personally it's okay to go to a
[1:20:38] different version if you don't
[1:20:39] understand
[1:20:44] but you have to be careful
[1:20:47] because king james version is the
[1:20:49] closest one to the original words
[1:20:56] i heard brother luis once um say behind
[1:20:58] the
[1:21:02] that in the new international version i
[1:21:04] believe there's a few
[1:21:05] verses that are taken out of the of
[1:21:08] genesis 1. uh
[1:21:15] so you just have to be careful with that
[1:21:19] if you go and you read from another
[1:21:21] version
[1:21:23] always go back to the king james version
[1:21:29] you can read that but go back and see
[1:21:31] what king james version says
[1:21:36] or king james
[1:21:37] because i know some other versions are
[1:21:39] just a little easier
[1:21:43] but but whenever you need to uh
[1:21:47] start remembering a verse remember the
[1:21:49] king james version
[1:21:54] regret
[1:22:05] that's how we're able to see um the
[1:22:07] difference of love
[1:22:08] this
[1:22:16] he used the word cosmos it was a greek
[1:22:20] word for world solar cosmos
[1:22:24] when he spoken about revelation about
[1:22:27] the beasts
[1:22:31] there was two different kinds of beasts
[1:22:33] we had those different this class is the
[1:22:34] best there was one zun and one therion
[1:22:36] oh no
[1:22:44] so if just go with revelation pray about
[1:22:48] it and look into the scriptures
[1:23:00] there's there's uh people that have
[1:23:02] gifts of studying
[1:23:10] but that doesn't
[1:23:12] mean that you don't have to
[1:23:14] no
[1:23:15] there's people with gifts of prayer
[1:23:18] personas
[1:23:20] there's gifts of faith i don't
[1:23:22] necessarily faith doesn't mean i'm gonna
[1:23:25] stop praying and stop
[1:23:27] having faith because that person has it
[1:23:29] no significa
[1:23:31] where the heart is
[1:23:39] there's gifts of teaching but still go
[1:23:41] and you go and look at the scriptures
[1:23:46] yesterday
[1:23:48] now in closing this is what i want to
[1:23:51] get to
[1:23:53] the conclusion of the whole bible
[1:23:58] is the identity of the lord jesus christ
[1:24:06] brother branham says this in christ is
[1:24:07] the mystery of god revealed
[1:24:12] he said the principle theme of the
[1:24:14] entire bible or he is the principle
[1:24:17] theme of the entire bible
[1:24:23] if you read the bible
[1:24:25] and you don't see christ in every verse
[1:24:36] see if you can't see christ in every
[1:24:38] verse of the bible
[1:24:42] then you read
[1:24:52] he is that um to the amen in revelations
[1:24:56] is
[1:24:59] is every word testifying of jesus christ
[1:25:06] in genesis where it says in the
[1:25:08] beginning
[1:25:14] in the end where the bible says in
[1:25:16] revelations amen
[1:25:22] there is jesus christ
[1:25:26] that's where the true revelation is
[1:25:30] so like i said
[1:25:31] my first true study was the study of
[1:25:34] david a convention
[1:26:19] oh one of my favorite parts was seeing
[1:26:21] the right hand men of saul and david uh
[1:26:29] david amner and joab amnari
[1:26:32] oh man those were faithful men yes
[1:26:36] and then looking at the warriors that
[1:26:37] would would would destroy thousands
[1:26:40] because they knew the king was anointed
[1:26:48] oh
[1:26:53] but then he asked me this question that
[1:26:55] just tore my whole world apart
[1:27:00] he said where do you see jesus
[1:27:08] i don't know i just see the story and
[1:27:10] it's so amazing
[1:27:14] but christ is in every scripture
[1:27:20] he's the theme of the entire bible
[1:27:26] that's when you can see christ in the
[1:27:28] scripture
[1:27:30] when you could see christ as that
[1:27:33] anointed rejected
[1:27:38] as david was asleep
[1:27:41] and seeing their man going and fighting
[1:27:43] for him
[1:27:46] and you see how the the other people
[1:27:48] rejected him
[1:27:52] and david cried out
[1:27:55] he said my god my god
[1:27:59] why have thou forsaken me
[1:28:02] that's the same very words that jesus
[1:28:05] said on the cross
[1:28:08] you begin to see christ as david walked
[1:28:10] up to goliath
[1:28:14] you could see christ whenever david was
[1:28:17] was the greatest king of all of israel
[1:28:24] he was there
[1:28:26] he was there with moses
[1:28:29] he was the rock that was smitten
[1:28:32] he was the lamb that was slain whenever
[1:28:35] adam and eve sinned
[1:28:40] adam shadow jesus christ whenever he
[1:28:43] chose his wife over eternal life
[1:28:52] it was all jesus christ
[1:28:54] it was all christ in the scriptures
[1:28:58] god he methodically placed every word
[1:29:01] every iota in the scriptures
[1:29:08] and put
[1:29:14] when you see christ
[1:29:17] now in closing
[1:29:22] now a man is if you'd like to stand with
[1:29:25] me because i
[1:29:27] i will go over time
[1:29:32] but a true man
[1:29:35] his
[1:29:36] words is a revelation of himself
[1:29:42] we've heard many people say a man is as
[1:29:44] good as his word
[1:29:48] there was one time this great handsome
[1:29:50] prince was out
[1:29:55] and and everybody loved him because of
[1:29:57] of his uh of how he looked he told us
[1:30:02] but when he stood before the elders
[1:30:29] and that's who god is yes
[1:30:32] christ christo is the word of god
[1:30:37] jesus jesus he is the embodiment of
[1:30:40] god's word
[1:30:44] that's why we should see christ in every
[1:30:46] verse
[1:31:00] then we can see our fall and our rise to
[1:31:02] god
[1:31:07] see it's a dangerous thing to see
[1:31:09] ourselves without seeing first christ
[1:31:15] because without christ there is no
[1:31:17] remission
[1:31:19] no remission without christ there is no
[1:31:21] goodness
[1:31:24] by the brother branham says that christ
[1:31:26] is the very heart of god uh
[1:31:42] yourself
[1:31:45] the only way you can see yourself is
[1:31:47] through christ
[1:31:51] then he becomes the center of revelation
[1:31:53] in your life
[1:32:03] lord we just want to thank you for your
[1:32:04] goodness and your grace lord
[1:32:09] we ask lord that you just bless each and
[1:32:12] every young person here lord
