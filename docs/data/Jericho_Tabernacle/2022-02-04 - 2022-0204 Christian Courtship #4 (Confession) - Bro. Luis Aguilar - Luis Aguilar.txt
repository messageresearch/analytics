to my interpreter and the brothers in the back established i said hopefully we can finish this series espero [Music] [Music] [Music] i believe by this time we should have that scripture memorized i'm glad to see some of you here you bring your your children you bring your young people that means you're interested in your and your family it shows that you're interested in your son they're interested in your daughter a man amen when you're don't care about your son you leave him at home you let him be with his friends amigos i don't want to go to church today if you're not interested in your son you leave them there but when you're you're interested in your son and your daughter doesn't matter how much they kick and screams because they know you know and you amen amen you love the lord i'm an el senor man that means that you love your family marriage is honorable and awe and the bad on the foul but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge onrosso is and keep the marriage bed pure the montenegro may the lord bless the ring of his word amen amen last time we were here we left off on on character and on courtship [Music] and i want to read a little quote here what brother branham says and then he wants fellowship and when we want courtship equando el cortejo and things like that it has to come on a basis of agreement man i believe that that's something that we've been speaking on as uh what we've been talking about that whenever a young person and a young couple they want to start courting there has to be in the basis of agreement and i like to just kind of finish what we uh what we were we left off last week so we can enter on the message of today and what we left off on how should i start courtship eternal now let's just say that the young person and the young lady are already in the form of friendship they've been doing things right they've they've been maintaining themselves as friends so uh what should you start what should you do both should pray and they should meditate young man he has a he has a responsibility the young man should talk to his his parents and talk to his pastor the young man then the goes to the pastor el joben yava con el pastor and the pastor will arrange a meeting to have a meeting with the girl's parents there at that moment the parents are going to see if it's okay for them to be courting momento los padres i want the young people to just understand something here i know they feel a little bit nervous and especially when they talk subjects like these elements when they say well you have to go talk to the pastor i want to say something i want to say that your pastor is here he's your best friend es i'm going to say that again your pasture pastor is your best friend esto mejor amigo he's going to play a big part and he's going to help you out i'm going to say that again he plays a big part elton and he's going to help you out what do you mean brother louise look brother i'm married when well i want to break this down but why is he going to be your best friend you know what the pastor is going to do is going to help you out he's going to intercede for you talk he's a good young man so i'm just giving you a little bit of an example that your pastor pastor is going to help you out a man amen so you shouldn't be afraid to go and talk to him now i got these three different different scenarios or different things here different scenarios i put someone who wants to car court local local or away or yeah there's young men that are young ladies that start dating in the same church when you're here local in the locals it's the same church you have the same pasture the young man knows the parents the young lady knows the other parents the pastor knows both the parents so they're what the young man should do it's very easy to go talk to the pastor it's very easy because they both share the same password now but when you're dating away if there's a young man here that wants to talk to a young lady from a different state here it's it's a little bit more work now when i when i was dating my wife when you established i was in texas she was here yesterday and what i did okay i what i i in this with a young man should be very careful because you can get it to a lot of trouble a man amen now you're dating in a different state you're dealing with two different pastors don't come to her hometown regardless of where she lives she lives in texas if she lives in colorado colorado don't you go to her hometown without talking to your pastor and then talk to the pastor where she lives at el pastores yeah i'm going to say that again don't you go to her hometown doesn't matter how much you love her and how much you prayed and a sign an angel came from heaven and tell her what you tell them what you want to do i'm sorry i'm sorry the pastor would tell you what to do hey man amen so you want to get permission before you go to her hometown before you can start the courtship antes aunt imagine you go fly into your hometown [Music] yeah you didn't even tell the pastor nila visas del pastor you didn't even tell her dad you just walk in the door yeah when i when i did that with my wife and the same applies when you're starting a form of friendship i talked to my pastor you have lecomi pastor look brother i i feel this and i prayed i feel this i got here to phoenix phoenix and i had a meeting with brother johnny i talked to him and when i that we we were doing having a formal friendship for about a year it and then when a time came when i wanted to start a courtship i did the same thing brother johnny look this i want to start a courtship i want to go over there and i want to talk to you formally so we go talk to her parents it's the same thing she he brought johnny wen and talked to her parents hermano jennifer your son wants to date your daughter so brother johnny was with me the whole way even when i went to go ask for her hands and we're going to get down the road when we speak about engagement but there brother johnny he kind of laid down the road for me doesn't matter how good of a young man i was important or how i looked camino correcto and talk to her parents now if they're dating if they're from a different church iglesia the same thing that young man has to come and talk to the pastor because that's the sheep if she if he belongs to a different church and she belongs to a different church that young man has to have the enough i know i might seem like it's brother i think that's a little bit too much because i think they should just talk and just go with it well i think that's what's based off on the message on the scripture we should go and we should look for advice amen so i i hope that that is it is helping you there especially so here in this this evening with god's help we're going to speak on confession we're going to open our scriptures to first corinthians chapter 6 verse 15 this is the scripture that we left off on sunday first corinthians 6 chapter 6 chapter verse 15. here the apostle paul is asking some tremendous questions it says know ye not that your bodies are members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them members of a harlot members apostles god forbid so so what what are what is the apostle paul here saying have you seen my eyes that's me so close you see my nose there's me nadis you see my fingers there's miss devils it's all members son todos membros and let's just say that i'm another another example so i want you to just notice here what the pasta paul is saying [Music] he says they shall be one flesh he says but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit because it's not something physically it's something spiritually that we're connected with 18. it says flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body foreign he says he gives an example he says how will you flee you're just going to go bye see you later fornication he's not going to flee from fornication he's going to run towards foreign to be slick he wants to touch the young lady hold her hand they want to take pictures he wants to be a little bit closer but he that committed fornication sinneth against his own body foreign that's why last week i said do you believe in predestination when the lord amen amen when the lord jesus christ when he was crucified crucified we were crucified when he was buried and now you take that from the spiritual and you flip it to the natural you might not say brother i don't think it works that way i don't think the scripture makes a mistake every sin that a man do it is without the body if i smoke and i lie and i cheat many amens but i thank god for those amen because we're one body and someone here is sick they were all sick if someone lies then we all he says that question i don't know how you read it but i i i i my the way my mind think is kind of tremendous he says what you say you imagine somebody's talking to you know holy ghost which you you have of god and it is not of your own for you were bought with a price now let's just say you're renting an apartment you're renting a building to live in a division let's say i take the wall down another room i want to change the restroom can i do that no it's not mine no no that's what that's where the apostle paul says you were bought with a prize you were bad with the prize apostle paul the body of the wife let's go to uh proverbs 28. we're going to speak on confession hablar i don't matter how holy you are there has to be a confession no one should should get married without confession and that's a stage where there you're going to hear some hard things you're going to find out that that preacher is not so much of a holy man you're going to find out that that young lady who comes to church every sunday is not so holy santa cruz everyone we want to avoid is to not to make a big mistake you don't want to confess something that's that that's embarrassing that you don't want to tell your spouse we both have to be in mutual agreement and there we're going to see if you want to continue on amen confession i'm going to read the definition of confession a formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime again it's a formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime declaration amen don't you thank god for sending a prophet amen to to make us better people uh that's what we should be aiming for if the denomination is if they have good marriages according with the young ladies that young man should already have the holy ghost and he should already be working i believe that that young man go home with your dad and start working at around the house if he's he'd be still in school go work on saturdays clean up a barber shop because now that young man he's already looking towards marriage starts having a savings account that's me that's i work as a truck driver from monday through friday monday through friday and a barber on saturday i started saving putting a savings account and i started seeing the money go up so when i got to the to the point where i wanted to propose to my wife i got an engagement ring i was see i was i was pretty wise i thank god for giving me that wisdom so i can start paying it off so one day i got married i want i wanted to show my wife we have the greatest message that was ever sent getting ready you should pay for that wedding pay for her venue and you should pay for her dress of course we live in a mexican culture where a lot of people like to like to share and like the pain but i believe a young man should work amen amen you should be responsible amen and god is my witness and i'm telling you the truth when i came out here i already had six months saved up for rent yet before i moved out here to texas so when the pandemic hit the yucatan peninsula you see how the monthly rent paid i can tell you that it is impossible that it is possible when you put god first and when you seek god first amen god god will give you the sermon of what to do how to manage your economy how to manage this and how to save it i i i i didn't even know how it felt to eat in a restaurant you have the opportunity to start working amen amen amen i hope you still love me and i hope you love the lord proverbs 28 verse 13. he says he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy loss so what what does it say there it's very clear as day here the cover of the stream shall not prosper you can you have sins that are hidden but who confesseth and forsaketh them in it but he also says and forsakes them in my heart the lord will not hear me el senor so i hope there's no iniquity amongst us james 5 16 santiago cinco de sis confess your fault to one to another confidence and pray for one another that he may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much there's people that are hurt there's people that are not they know that they're not perfect christians no they're not perfect but when they confess and they can come unto god it produces healing produces amen how many are ready to hear what the prophet has to say amen now this she has given to to bring forth life that's right it has to come all the life has to come from god any life has to come from god it's perverted and that makes the sinful makes it sinful but life has to come from god he's the author of life i want to name three things here that she must not get away from her number three now i'm speaking keep the church in mind while i speak while i'm speaking of this natural woman the woman in the natural everyone is gossiping and everyone is dressed immorally everyone is wearing makeup there we know where the status is as paul is here in the seventh chapter of romans capitalism she has a sacred trust of virtue committed by to her by the lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman solo latina right that's committed to her bygone correct she must not defile that virtue and if she even does something wrong she must confess that to her husband before he takes her and make it right what are the three things that brother branham says nothing and she had the same as a church that she that was married to the law has to come also before christ before the second marriage she has to confess that if she doesn't and she lives with her husband for 10 years and then confesses it she has a right to put her away and marry another woman that's the scripture fornication is unclean living fornication brother graham says that for the young ladies i believe same thing applies for the young man he shouldn't be going off doing things like that your brother branham says on um the message questions and answers jesus said in matthew 19 9 whosoever putteth away his wife and marries another jesus except it be for the cause of fornication commits adultery the difference between fornication adultery the word could be applied either way the difference but to make it clear what he's talking about a woman that's unmarried cannot commit adultery yes because she has no husband to commit adultery again it's she has to confess that to her husband before they're married if she did that and then her husband finds out later he has a writer put her away because she took a false vow for the bible said be it well or rich or ritual says be well known unto you if i have it in mind if any couples are joined to otherwise then god's word does allow their marriage is not lawful yolo tengo skrito i will require and i'll charge you both as you will surely answer the day of judgment when the secrets of hearts shall be disclosed if either of you know any impediment why you should not be lawful lawfully joined together do you now confess it is so fornication is what a girl when she lives unclean that's fornication because she has no husband foreign but when and then when she lives like that she commits adultery against her husband a woman come out long ago and she said i've confessed all of that she was nervous and had a breakdown and said i've confessed all of that to god i said you have to confess it to your husband it wasn't god that you committed adultery against it was your husband and if a man marries a woman and she has live unclean before she marries him and then she comes to him and if they've been married ever so long and then she comes to him and says i did run out with another man i never told you jesus said he has a right to put her away and marry another because they're not married in the beginning confessions can be a bit difficult because something that you don't want to say you don't want to admit but love covers multitude of sins and she loves you you accept her just the way she is and you accept him that's completely forgiving like they've never done it it's something it's something so amazing when the confession comes i'm gonna i'm i have a pretty lengthy quote just keep patience with me a little brother rams talking about a young sister here elemanta branos a little later later later from that there was a young girl i just want you to please pay close attention she she is perhaps perhaps sitting here this morning i don't see her but she's she comes in sparingly she is a member of the church of a church in new albany a very prominent church an outstanding church in new albany yes in new albany psychonaurosis and she can't and she won't even live leave the city or anywhere she starts screaming and crying and going on yeah notice we're here what brother ram says nothing a kilo kilometer i pray for her two or three times but something wouldn't let me challenge that demon she's a good friend of a good friend to a nurse that lives in the neighborhood there yes they come up there and she was getting worse and she'd been that way for about eight years and so she came up the other way and she said i told her i said sis the only thing i know that there is a cause there somewhere entonces and i said my pastor sent me up here and said go see brother billy and see what he says well i said well i don't know i don't know says i said i'm i'm i'm just like your pastor estoy have you confessed all of your sins she says everything sunday school teacher has a great class in doing good work but she but just that but just that hung over her el maestras she was a sunday school teacher when people come we just stopped everything i got her in the room i sat down and i started talking about giant genealogies and everything and everything about the beginning the origin of time and everything and watching her and it was the same morning god is always there at the crucial moment after a while i looked out and there come a vision moving up i said your conditions has something to do with an automobile because he says no i never i never was in a wreck yes went ahead and began to bring it down i said these the things that you've done the immoral things you told them about some of it you're going to have an operation not too long ago for your tonsils and you was afraid to take the anesthetic anaesthesia afraid you could tell that underneath what does brother ram say there can you sell them this young lady had a surgery with her tonsils and she was scared to take that anesthetic to anesthetic anesthesia because she she feels like she'll start just confessing everything they should start telling the truth should she rather she rather postpone the surgery so she doesn't tell the secret out but but god's prophet told her her cause of her problem did you have a mental condition start screaming and start crying she can't even say you were afraid to take that because you were scared you're going to confess it she screamed and fell on the floor yeah i said how can you ever get anywhere with that hanging on i'm talking to every single one of you here today how can you continue hanging that i said how can you ever get that how can you ever get anywhere with that hanging on you como puedes opening s i said you go back and make it right so notice i want you to start thinking why am i sick why can't i get here what can i hear this message is coming straight from the lord straight from god's throne directly talking to every single one of them i said now if you don't believe it sometimes we're so unbeliever sometimes my god speaks to us right on our faces and we still say i don't believe it we want to see an angel will you take somebody here from the dead and resurrect yeah if you don't believe it call him tell him to meet you she went in and called him on the phone they met on the road and here they come back tears running down their cheeks forgave one another the demon left her el demono la dejo when did the demon leave her cuando la dejo el mono esta que el paso once the pastor prayed for her william brennan once the prophet william branham prayed for her accused this is the key brothers that's why there's a lot of people that are sick in the mind and in the spirit and in the spirit and in the soul and in their bodies and they go to the real life after after [Music] [Applause] but when and they had never left and they had never left till they was corrected you see you got to find the cause before you find the cure i know i'm closing i already reached my hour yesterday the doctor has to do a diagnosis diagnostic the case down so he finds the cause and he says then you and says it's tremendous is it the doctor this is the new this is usted you get rid of the cause uh this is great what's the cause get rid of it leave it alone if you're doing something stop it in the name of jesus christ get rid of it you stop it i'm not mad just like a hole in the bucket that's if you're pouring water in the water just keeps leaking out better stop the hole now there's there's where i lay what must i asked prayer for all of them well if you would just touch me you do this brother they say those things take place if their life isn't combed through by the life isn't called through the holy spirit you don't i believe it's is [Music] because no one has revealed this to you no one had to tell you no one told you to fix it but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock i shall build my our confession of our sins the confession believing that all of our sins are in the sea of forgetfulness doesn't matter how big of a crime [Applause] anymore now let's just take a big dip of wash tub of clorox that one bleach it's the ink itself is latin becomes clorox the blood of jesus christ what is it it's forgotten it's done yes [Music] [Applause] if you have something to confess to god raise up your hands raise up your both of your hands raise up your heart i i have to confess my sins to you guys [Applause] there's a sinner here in church i don't like that deserves to go [Applause] i'm so ashamed of diabetes i don't want my life i [Music] [Music] oh [Music] here we
