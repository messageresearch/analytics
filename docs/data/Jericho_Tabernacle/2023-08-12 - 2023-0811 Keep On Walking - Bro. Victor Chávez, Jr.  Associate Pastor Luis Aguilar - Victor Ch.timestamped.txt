[32:32] very different
[32:34] so please excuse my names
[32:42] may God manifest himself on this tonight
[32:48] and uh
[32:50] today I just wanted to talk about
[32:55] uh so the title on just keep walking
[33:00] and I came about to this title
[33:05] um it wasn't originally planned
[33:10] I was originally going to speak about
[33:12] something else
[33:14] but God has different plans
[33:19] and I hope that uh God gives me the
[33:22] strength to uh speak to his people
[33:24] tonight
[33:29] we can just go back to the scripture of
[33:32] Luke
[33:34] this time we're going to go to uh
[33:36] chapter 24 but verse 13 this time
[33:42] and this is um
[33:46] this is talking about uh the people who
[33:47] are walking to Emmaus
[33:52] um that God had a I already died for our
[33:56] sins
[33:59] and they were very very conflicted
[34:08] they were very um they were questioning
[34:12] and they were saying they were not sure
[34:15] of themselves
[34:17] but what they didn't know is that God
[34:20] was present there walking with them as
[34:22] well
[34:26] I believe the God is our great um when
[34:30] we need a
[34:31] when we need comfort
[34:35] or we need Assurance
[34:38] God always uses someone
[34:42] sends some sort of
[34:45] signal to uh just calms down a little
[34:48] bit
[34:50] to make sure what we're standing on
[34:55] uh we can just go to verse 13.
[34:59] and behold two of them went the same day
[35:02] to the Village called Emmaus which was
[35:05] from Jerusalem about three score or long
[35:15] and they walk together
[35:18] of all of these things which had
[35:20] happened
[35:26] and it came to pass that while they
[35:29] commune together and reasoned Jesus
[35:31] himself Junior and went with them
[35:39] so as you can see um there were they
[35:43] were talking about uh what happened in
[35:46] uh
[35:47] to the Son of God recently is
[35:55] on chapter on verse 15 they said uh they
[35:58] commune together
[36:02] but if you also look they said reason as
[36:05] well
[36:09] and
[36:11] they they were walking enemies
[36:16] and communion together as they were
[36:19] talking together having fellowships
[36:25] sometimes we have a scholarship over
[36:27] here
[36:35] and sometimes I I believe that sometimes
[36:38] we try to reason with God
[36:42] you know you know why God you know why
[36:45] does God do this
[36:49] or God why'd you permit this to happen
[36:55] and I believe that's what was going on
[36:56] here in this verse is
[37:01] and uh
[37:03] verse 13 and it came to pass that while
[37:06] they communed together the reason Jesus
[37:08] himself Junior and went with them
[37:15] but their eyes were holding that they
[37:17] should not know him
[37:21] and notice right here on verse 13.
[37:25] he said unto them what manner of
[37:28] communications are these that ye have
[37:30] one to another as we walk and are sad
[37:34] because
[37:46] in verse 17 they asked well what are we
[37:50] talking about
[37:53] they look around and they're saying uh
[37:57] well you know what what's going on here
[38:02] they keep walking and they notice that
[38:05] you know why why are you sad is
[38:11] just keep reading on verse 18.
[38:14] and one of them whose names was claro
[38:16] pass answering said unto him
[38:19] art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem
[38:21] and has not known that the things which
[38:23] have come to pass there in these things
[38:26] in these days
[38:37] and he said unto them
[38:40] and he said unto them what things and
[38:42] they said unto him concerning Jesus of
[38:44] Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[38:47] indeed and word before God and all his
[38:49] people entrances
[39:00] and so here in verse 18 we have a we
[39:03] have a question
[39:06] and uh
[39:09] and chloroplasts use
[39:12] he was
[39:14] he was giving a question
[39:16] is
[39:18] he was he was saying well why are you
[39:22] why are you sad you know
[39:25] and the answer was having you seen that
[39:28] Jesus of Nazareth just died
[39:34] you know the the mighty Prophet is
[39:39] before God and all his people
[39:43] they were asking him if he was if he was
[39:45] new to Jerusalem
[39:50] because it was the big news everyone
[39:53] pretty much knews
[39:58] hey man let's just keep reading
[40:02] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[40:05] delivered him to The Condemned death and
[40:09] have crucified him
[40:13] investors
[40:17] were we trusted that it had been in
[40:20] which
[40:21] should have redeemed Israel and beside
[40:23] all of this to the day
[40:25] to the day is the third day since these
[40:28] things were done
[40:38] amen as we can see it was the third day
[40:42] that Jesus has been that Jesus was dead
[40:50] but we know what happened in the third
[40:52] day
[40:56] foreign
[41:15] 23 and when they found not his body they
[41:18] were they came saying that they had also
[41:21] seen a vision of angels which has said
[41:23] that he was alive
[41:33] concerning all the women that uh that
[41:35] made them astonished foreign
[41:40] [Music]
[41:41] of them which were with us went to the
[41:45] support tree and found it even so as the
[41:48] women had said but not
[41:50] but him they saw now
[41:52] foreign
[42:28] and that's when it's that's when uh in
[42:31] verse 25 they said
[42:33] slow and hard to believe and the
[42:35] prophets have spoken yes
[42:43] 26 it tells us what happened
[42:47] it says ought not Christ to have
[42:50] suffered for these things and enter into
[42:52] the glory is
[43:00] and and the beginning at the Moses and
[43:03] all of his prophets he has expounded
[43:04] unto them and to all of his scriptures
[43:07] that uh the things concerning himself is
[43:19] whether they went and he made as though
[43:23] he had
[43:32] but they constrained him saying abide
[43:34] with us for he is towards the evening
[43:37] and the day is far spent and he went to
[43:40] Terry with them
[43:50] and it came to pass that he sat at meet
[43:53] with them and took bread and blessed and
[43:55] bake and gave it to them
[43:57] foreign
[44:03] in so we can see uh for when we first
[44:06] read in verse 13 this is
[44:10] that they were very conflicted in their
[44:12] walk the chaos
[44:15] very uncertain is
[44:18] and sometimes you know sometimes when
[44:21] we're we're in a Christian walk
[44:25] there's a certain Road stops
[44:29] or something's off the road
[44:34] you know but
[44:37] but in verse
[44:39] in verse 15 it said that Jesus himself
[44:42] Drew near and went with him
[44:48] amen so that gives us a certainty of we
[44:51] don't walk alone
[44:54] that Jesus is right here by our side
[44:56] walking Jesus is
[45:05] and when they went
[45:08] um when they continued walking
[45:11] we see that they heard of uh the women
[45:14] that said uh
[45:17] uh that they saw a vision
[45:20] um
[45:24] that they said that Jesus was alive
[45:28] and uh us as humans I believe
[45:34] sometimes you know it's very um
[45:39] it's very surprising
[45:42] or to put it more in a way God tries to
[45:45] test where you're at
[45:48] where your faith is
[45:51] no and uh
[45:54] they went to the tomb foreign
[46:00] and that's when uh that's when in verse
[46:03] 25 they said all fools slow and hard to
[46:05] believe that all the prophets have
[46:07] spoken yes
[46:14] Christ have suffered these things and
[46:16] enter into his glory
[46:21] so he asked them have you not listened
[46:24] to what the prophet says
[46:29] he said do you not think that he had
[46:31] already entered into his glory
[46:35] amen and then continue on the verse
[46:37] that's when you see them uh start to
[46:39] tearing
[46:44] and they started to Fellowship
[46:48] and the Bible says that they broke bread
[46:51] this is
[46:58] [Music]
[47:04] you know sometimes we're nervous system
[47:08] or sometimes you know we
[47:11] you know sometimes we're a little
[47:14] you know a little sad maybe yeah this is
[47:19] sorry or discouraged
[47:23] um you know sometimes
[47:25] you know as uh we walk
[47:30] um
[47:31] there's like I said there's Road stops
[47:34] in the way
[47:37] but like I said
[47:39] there's God that's always by her side
[47:42] holding our hands
[47:45] walking that straight path
[47:55] um
[47:59] and um
[48:00] if I can just uh
[48:03] pull brother random real quick let's
[48:04] just give me a minute
[48:13] in the message
[48:15] um God and his people
[48:18] preached in February 27th but it is
[48:29] every Apple that's in the tree this is
[48:33] in is in the tree when it's spring no
[48:37] more than that is
[48:40] when it's a little bitty Branch sit in
[48:43] the ground
[48:46] every broom every Bloom that ever be in
[48:49] the tree is in that right there

[49:09] already in the tree
[49:12] the apples already
[49:15] the trees planted in the ground
[49:18] and the only thing that it has to that
[49:21] has to do is drink
[49:24] and when it and when it goes to drink
[49:29] and it has to drink
[49:31] uh more than its portion is
[49:34] it spreads out say expand it pushes amen
[49:39] and sometimes we just got a drink
[49:42] and then you just ask God to receive
[49:45] more from God
[49:51] um
[49:53] and that the way that we're planted in
[49:55] Christ Jesus if you say yes
[49:58] through the inexhaustible Fountain of
[50:01] Life
[50:03] and as we start drinking
[50:06] and the more we drink we just push out
[50:11] it brings out these elements
[50:14] and the gifts of God that has called you
[50:17] out
[50:20] now listen to this
[50:22] the trouble is
[50:24] foreign
[50:30] that's right a CS you don't drink no
[50:33] babies don't you believe that he's an
[50:35] inexhaustible Fountain of Life

[50:48] you come

[50:54] see you gotta come and drink
[50:58] that's what this is about
[51:01] for you to drink
[51:04] and then there's a fountain open flowing
[51:07] freely everywhere
[51:12] just drink till you can't drink no more
[51:19] if if it just drink to what the
[51:24] atonement is
[51:30] why why would it just always
[51:35] it would uh it would still be in drought
[51:38] that's the matter with these Christians

[51:45] you want to drink till you spread out
[51:49] let somebody else
[52:00] step out on it

[59:33] leading
[59:35] as the quote that the brother said
[59:40] the quote that said that there was a it
[59:42] was the pillar of fire
[59:44] that led them to the Red Sea
[59:47] it wasn't Moses that led him to the red
[59:50] seat
[59:51] but it was the pillar of fire that led
[59:53] him to the race
[59:55] and they complained to Moses
[59:58] so why do you lead us here today
[1:00:02] Moses was only following the pillar of
[1:00:05] fire
[1:00:06] when the three Hebrew Hebrew children
[1:00:10] they were only being led
[1:00:13] by that Pillar of Fire foreign
[1:00:40] I came with the expectations
[1:00:43] maybe a lot of us with the expectations
[1:00:46] I'm ready to sit under the feet
[1:00:51] please forgive me
[1:00:53] of Johnny
[1:00:57] the pillar of fire was the one that
[1:01:00] brought me here to Phoenix Arizona
[1:01:02] Phoenix Arizona there was no other man
[1:01:05] but the pillar of fire
[1:01:07] and God brought us here
[1:01:10] and I said God did you brought us here
[1:01:14] today
[1:01:15] no it was God that brought us
[1:01:18] and it's God that's going to lead us yes
[1:01:23] we know how the people of Israel
[1:01:26] fellas
[1:01:28] we just came here to die
[1:01:31] foreign but it was a pillar of fire
[1:01:35] that is leading the people
[1:01:38] you got to keep on walking
[1:01:42] don't look at the man don't look at
[1:01:46] Moses look at the pillar of fire
[1:01:50] look at Jesus Christ it was the pillar
[1:01:54] of fire that but each and every single
[1:01:56] one of you
[1:01:57] to the desert he brought brother Eli to
[1:02:01] the desert they brought me to the desert
[1:02:10] every single one of you to the desert
[1:02:13] did it bring you here today
[1:02:16] we're going to be all on would you bring
[1:02:18] us out here
[1:02:21] I am the god almighty
[1:02:25] I brought you here and I will bring you
[1:02:28] out he won't just let us cross that Red
[1:02:31] Sea
[1:02:32] foreign
[1:03:14] but that was my way how I saw it myself
[1:03:20] because it hurts
[1:03:24] I came here what do I do now I came here
[1:03:30] to learn I
[1:03:32] am your teacher
[1:03:34] I am the purifier
[1:03:37] is God your teacher is the word your
[1:03:41] teacher you've got to keep on walking
[1:03:46] turn northward
[1:03:49] we got to have our faith
[1:03:53] oh Jesus Christ
[1:03:55] do we have that Pillar of Fire
[1:03:58] the people of Israel follow that Pillar
[1:04:01] of Fire
[1:04:02] they saw the pillar of fires
[1:04:06] that was God above them
[1:04:09] when Jesus was here on Earth
[1:04:21] but now with God in us
[1:04:25] it's not just God above us
[1:04:29] with us
[1:05:23] you see
[1:05:31] people die
[1:06:13] and there's times where it says slow
[1:06:16] down
[1:06:17] but there's times it says keep going
[1:06:20] forward
[1:06:23] you're on the freeway now you're no
[1:06:26] longer on these little roads
[1:06:29] time to pick up the velocity
[1:06:33] foreign and then they get then you go
[1:06:36] into town
[1:06:39] and you we have a destination
[1:06:42] a lot of people don't make it to the
[1:06:44] destination
[1:06:45] why because they're going too fast
[1:06:48] driving too Reckless
[1:06:51] you're not following God's signs
[1:06:56] but we have to follow God's signs
[1:07:02] who is God who is that
[1:07:06] signal but Abraham says in the message
[1:07:25] don't stop at the signs
[1:07:29] going towards that way
[1:07:34] today
[1:08:19] is until you
[1:08:21] receive is
[1:08:24] we receive that baptism
[1:08:34] and he's going to do everything he can
[1:08:36] yeah
[1:08:41] troubles here
[1:08:47] siblings
[1:08:55] because
[1:09:01] and now you have become an enemy to him
[1:09:05] but before that
[1:09:11] we were the devil's friends
[1:09:14] everything he said we did it
[1:09:19] we sold we cheated but the moment we
[1:09:24] walked the opposite direction
[1:09:28] now we became enemies
[1:09:32] everything in his race
[1:09:34] foreign
[1:10:22] to walk with Christ
[1:10:25] is an individual
[1:10:29] individual where God told Abraham
[1:10:33] he elected Abraham
[1:10:36] when did he elect Abraham
[1:10:39] he elected him before the foundation of
[1:10:42] the world
[1:10:44] was there something that Abraham did
[1:10:49] it says there was nothing that Abraham
[1:10:52] did
[1:10:54] there was nothing that he said
[1:10:57] but God just simply elected him
[1:11:02] he said separate yourself
[1:11:07] it's an individual walk
[1:11:49] when something strikes you
[1:11:52] there's really nothing that can really
[1:11:54] help anything
[1:11:57] you gotta just trust in God
[1:12:00] I believe every single one of us
[1:12:03] have gone through situations
[1:12:06] yes there's really nothing that can come
[1:12:09] to them
[1:13:07] the ones that make you want to quit
[1:13:11] you know what I'm talking about
[1:13:13] the ones that really just hurts
[1:13:19] you know what that does it brings out
[1:13:22] Faith
[1:13:24] don't you notice
[1:13:27] it only happens
[1:13:29] when the tough things happen
[1:13:32] when things just go down
[1:13:36] you know what I'm talking about
[1:13:41] when it's just so hard to understand
[1:13:43] there's not one single text that can
[1:13:46] comfort you
[1:13:49] there's not one single text from the
[1:13:52] pastor that can come from you
[1:13:55] but you know something deep inside
[1:13:59] they're very little small voice
[1:14:01] somewhere deep inside
[1:14:05] that tells you
[1:14:07] God is good
[1:14:10] God is good because
[1:14:12] thank you God gracias it might not be
[1:14:15] too strong

[1:31:28] and we're waiting on that Rapture yes
[1:31:31] we're waiting on that body
[1:31:36] we got to keep on walking
[1:31:38] maybe maybe there's some here or two or
[1:31:41] three here
[1:31:43] they're going up a mountain
[1:31:46] going climbing over rocks
[1:31:50] and there's something going down the
[1:31:53] valley
[1:31:56] it keeps going down
[1:31:59] baby keep on walking
[1:32:01] one of these days we're going to get
[1:32:03] down to Jordan
[1:32:06] you're gonna come across that Jordan
[1:32:09] River
[1:32:11] and you won't have to cross that Jordan
[1:32:13] River alone
[1:32:16] and we'll come to the end of the journey
[1:32:22] you said I can't believe I made it this
[1:32:24] far
[1:32:26] a lot of Trials
[1:32:32] but I finally made it today
[1:32:35] don't you want to be there
[1:32:38] make it to the end
[1:32:42] he said Faithful Servants
[1:32:45] you have made it to the end of the
[1:32:47] journey
[1:32:50] dear Lord Heavenly Father
[1:32:52] oh Lord we raised up our hands
[1:32:55] we come into this church of the Common
[1:32:58] Ground
[1:33:01] Lord to Worship You Lord
[1:33:04] we thank you for your word
[1:33:07] Thank You Lord For What Your Grace has
[1:33:09] done for us
[1:33:13] there's nothing that we can do Lord
[1:33:17] to pay you back of what you've done for
[1:33:20] us
[1:33:22] may you give us a baptism of love
[1:33:26] will you give us Revelation
[1:33:29] Lord may you give us more encouragement
[1:33:31] to keep going forward
[1:33:34] heavenly father I need you Lord to hold
[1:33:37] my hands
[1:33:40] to help me carry my cross
[1:33:44] or like that old story
[1:33:47] when that man went to God
[1:34:02] you don't want that cross anymore
[1:34:06] so go and put it down and there's a
[1:34:08] bunch of crosses over there in that
[1:34:09] corner
[1:34:13] go and find yourself a cross you want to
[1:34:15] carry
[1:34:17] the cross that fits you good
[1:34:21] this man began to look through all the
[1:34:24] crosses yes
[1:34:26] one was way too big
[1:34:30] he tried the other one and it will it
[1:34:33] will hurt aside
[1:34:41] he went through so many crosses
[1:34:44] and then finally he said I like this
[1:34:47] cross
[1:34:51] and God said you want that one
[1:34:54] sure that's that I'll take this one
[1:34:57] and the angel was about to say something
[1:35:01] God said don't say nothing
[1:35:04] and the man left yeah
[1:35:16] he says because that cross
[1:35:21] was designed for him
[1:35:24] for him to carry that cross
[1:35:28] Lord help us to carry that cross
[1:35:32] in order to one day we get to the end of
[1:35:34] the journey
[1:35:36] and we're going to stick that cross down
[1:35:39] to the ground
[1:35:41] we're not going to have that cross
[1:35:43] forever
[1:35:45] you're going to change that cross for a
[1:35:48] crown
[1:35:50] we're trusting in your word
[1:35:52] when you help your people
[1:35:55] as your songs are going to be saying
[1:35:59] let us let us worship you father
