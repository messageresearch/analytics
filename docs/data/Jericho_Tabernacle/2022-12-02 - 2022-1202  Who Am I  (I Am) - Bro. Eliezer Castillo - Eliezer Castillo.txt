God whenever I lift up my hands I heard our brother Pedro mancilla he was praying and he was quoting brother Branham how when we lift up our hands we defy gravity or Define everything that tells us to leave our hands down and whenever we do it we surrender to the almighty God when we do it God sees whether we're here in church or whether we're at our house alone whenever I raise my hands God knows and when he knows he takes away my car my charges he takes everything away I'm so thankful for that song Amen so good to be here in the house of the Lord once more to give God all the honor and the glory I pray that each and every one of you came with a liquifier and with expectations we believe that God is here this evening or amen hey man I want to go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to Matthew 3 16. now we're going to read 16 and 17. this is whenever you have it just go ahead and say Amen and the Bible says and Jesus when he was baptized went straight away out of the water Lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon Him foreign this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased brother Berlin says in other words in whom I am well pleased to dwell in Andres amen it was such a blessing to see our sister Lydia get baptized because that's what happens when we're baptized when we give our hearts to the Lord God identifies you dioses as a child of God well let's let's turn to chapter four chapter four one two three now this is right when Jesus tells him or this is when God identifies Jesus this is my beloved Son now in chapter 4 it says then Jesus was led of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil Jesus and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread let us heavenly father father Celestial Lord we're so thankful you've allowed us to be here this evening Lord father I ask that you just take preeminence of each and every one of us here Lord that if there's anything you would like to say that you may have free Reigns to speak to us this evening fathers Lord we submit ourselves unto thee and we we come with Open Hearts and open ears we thank you we give you the glory name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated so as you could see up there in the the screens my title is who am I that's a very good question to ask ourselves I believe it's one of the greatest issues that people are wrestling with who am I the greatest Quest that people can Embark in is the discovery of oneself young people that's what they try to do discover who they are yes and if everything goes right they they figure out who they are is but even over time it seems like people try to find out who they are what's their meaning in life identity is is the fact of being who a person is to understand identity identity is often thought as your overarching sense of your view of yourself so [Music] you know the the young people today and not only the young people but I believe the old some of the old also some of the adults they're figuring out trying to figure out who they are and the way they try to figure out is they try to fit in with certain things they're trying to figure out what what career they're going to make what school to go to Escuela who to marry what what what profession should I embark in uh who am I what defines that's a very good question a stable uh sense of identity it means that you know who you are that you're the same person from the past as you are from the prayer to the present all the way to the future a stable sense of identity is that you can identify who you are even though sometimes your actions are contrary to that sometimes we do something out of character out of our own identity but when you know who you are it doesn't matter rain or shine good or bad days you know who you are and that's the search that the whole world has today yes what I realized as in studying this that your identity is made up of layers that are added up throughout your life is your perception of your abilities they're formed by your achievements by the way of your your behaving even as that changes your personality or your temperamento your opinions or your the social roles that you play such as work school even Church those are all layers of our what makes up our personality or our identity so why why is knowing or why is our identity so important why is it important to know who we are important because your identity it governs the kind of life that you're going to live it propels you to a certain destination by your own identity who you identify with now I mentioned some layers of how how your achievements or how your work can can be a layer of your identity but we we need to find out all of us we need to find out the the core or the your strong or your core identity so nuclear nucleos your core identity that that will stay the same and will adapt to all the changes that no matter what happens you are this because we can't we can't make a thing our identity we can't make our job our core identity hey who are you oh I'm a barber oh I'm an insurance agent and we make that our identity well that's a layer of our identity but we can make our jobs we can't make our relationships we can't even make the way we look our identity because those things those things become very unstable established if if a young woman makes her looks her identities look at the social media look at how how they identify themselves by the way they look everything they do is surrounded by that okay but what happens when she turns 80 years old what happens when when her her looks fade away her identity crashes down what if your job what if you get laid off your identity is broken in pieces if you identify yourself through relationships what if those broke break or what if those are broken so we have to identify ourselves with something that is going to hold us forever something that is not going to change with the times [Music] he even achieved people receive their identity by achieving things well I'm the best at my work well I'm this and I've been top of my class well I am the most good-looking oh well I'm the smartest one and we become we attach our identity by our achievements but what what if some we find somebody that's better than us somebody that does it better somebody that is smarter somebody that is more better looking than our identity becomes unstable identity well the whole world is constantly changing if you have a strong sense of who you are you have an anchor you have an anchor so that you can stand the time the test of times because without in that anchor changes will become chaotic in your life changes will become terrifying in your life because you don't have who am I that's what I want the young people to think who are who am I okay when I'm in school who am I when I'm with all my co-workers who am I we're not away from church when I'm away from my parents who am I when I'm by myself who am I it's a good question to ask a lot of us when we were younger a lot of us have a lot of hat to wear we have a lot of personas that's natural yes we try we try to fit in we we try to change the way we look in order to fit in with other people we try to act a certain way so that we can fit in with a certain group of people and we have a lot of faces that's normal yes that's normal as a young person to try to fit in with the group my brother Branham says what makes them do that it's it's for a cause now now um I pray praise God for uh the way God does things because I've been it's been in my heart for for a while and then this Sunday our precious brother Juanito is preach the message message identified with Christ and and uh he used this this message identified with Christ and this is the um part of part of the message he says it's foreign God gave gave them that nature they've got a nature that makes them want to have something to identify themselves with so it's a god-given nature to identify ourselves with something someone foreign they want to be a superstar they they see these the the new people that that these new influencers they see these great people behind the screen and what happens is it puts a pressure on our young people to become who they are to become like the world because once they step out of their homes they're homes that have been prayed over the homes that play the tapes once they go out and they go into the real world when they go into their schools see is the influence of of what you see behind the screens all you see is the influence of Tick Tock and Instagram Instagram YouTube the YouTube uh I don't know the rest TV television Netflix either Netflix it's all there it's something that we all know young or old we know the influences out there and and what happens is young people are trying to fit in they're trying to find who they are so they have to identify themselves with something identification so they they move here and they change here and they wear many hats I remember when I was a young man I was under 18. Church Iglesia I was the same and like let's say I was the Saint at church I had to fit in I had to then but put me with my friends Amigos put me with my buddies Amigos and I I become somebody completely different I become different it's natural that's the cause of sin Isa is born in sins shaped in iniquity come to this world-speaking life without an experience I would act just like them maybe worse the bad thing about where I live it was a small town people knew who my pastor was and they knew he was my uncle and so when I would be in middle school and I'd be saying those words the other students not the teachers not not the counselors the other students Los otros estudiantes would say why are you acting that way that's not who you are that's not how you were raised no voice why I was trying to fit in there was a man that was married to his wife and he said this statement that really caught my attention he says my wife has been married to five different men over all the years that we've been married and he said all those men were mean his character and his identity would change I I can ask each and every person that that is um you know adults think of yourself when you were 15 years old oh man he didn't know nothing even when he was 20 years old 20 year old Eli was ignorant he didn't know anything he was a different persona but as As I Grew I changed my identity As I Grew I became more mature into the identity of Christ as I change in my life that old person he's different he's another person is he smoked cigarettes oh it didn't matter if there was one on the floor he would get the little bud and he would smoke that's who he was until something happened in him and whenever he gave his heart to the Lord his identity changed that wasn't him anymore so when people say oh well Juanito he was he's him he's that person you can't put him to that person anymore his identity changed Who Am I who are you today looking inside of our emotions and our feelings and our desires to find our identity it will not work because like I said we change every year we change every week young people we change with the culture if we're not serving the lord we're changing last year they used to wear those pants not this year last year's how they used to cut their hair that's how they used to cut their hair last year oh you're still growing your beard that was that was 2015. oh you're still you still have this style like that oh that was 10 years ago it changes every day now these days we are people demanding demanding for everyone else to identify themselves or identify them by their gender identity or their pronounselves this is this is made up of a sense of themselves or this made up sense of themselves it's based on the time that they live in is by by the place that they're at and by the way they feel is so so one day what is it a she her or her she uh and the next day they're he him or they them it changes by their feelings the thing is now this is what's going on in in schools today this is what's going on in that the young people have to deal with today what is brother he like talking about the young people know that that that these people they demand you to call them by their identity but their identity is so fickle or so unstable that they could be a she one day okay and non-binary the next day or or he him or they them and they change it yet they demand you to call them by their identity there was only one one person that could say I am okay that was gone Moses said who are you he said I am the I am if I want to be the door I'm the door I am the shepherd I am the Water of Life Today people want to be I am I am this now tomorrow I'll be this that's the world we're living in today that's the world that our young people have to indulge themselves in this is the world thinks today that they're able to create their own identity but they don't realize that the culture has influenced the way they are influence now I'm bringing it as plain as possible we know who who's in control of the culture we know that the devil has his hands on it so when these people they try to identify themselves and say it's coming from me I am controllers it's the culture that they're being influenced by is now now imagine I want you guys to imagine something and time is going so fast imagine all right imagine 1200 years an Aztec warrior is walking around the Amazon jungle is and he has two very strong feelings now remember he's an Aztec warrior first he sees aggression inside of him he loves War he loves killing and he loves to hunt he sees that in him and he says that's me he says that's me I'm an Aztec warrior Jose I'm gonna Express that so then he sees another feeling now forgive me for for getting a little um too much but I just want you guys to understand what's going on here he sees another feeling he sees the same sex attraction he said that's not me now let's take somebody today a young hispanic man um let's say his ancestor was that Aztec warriors now you have this Hispanic man walking down downtown Phoenix the Phoenix he has two strong feelings he sees aggression he sees that he he likes to hurt people and he says I need therapy neces something's wrong with me I need to go to a therapist then he sees the other feelings now now why did I say those two things because it depends on the culture of what you're going to express 1200 years ago the culture was demanding it was demanding for a warrior Guerrero so so the other feeling he said that's not me and maybe he thought this expression or this self uh identity was coming from himself but this culture will bring out a blueprint or a grid of how we should be so now in this day they say oh you know what being masculine no no no that's that's not part of the culture anymore to be aggressive that's not me anymore that's not socially acceptable what's acceptable is is the same sex attraction and then they attach the they think they know what they're doing or they think it's coming from themselves but it's it's a tool of the enemy and yes it's culture telling you you have to be a certain way you have to act a certain way that's what culture is doing today to our young people but culture is unstable and it changes every day so young men young women by the way you are dressed by the way you believe foreign by the way you live the culture will identify you a certain way they will categorize you maybe crazy um it's easy to be a professing Christian it's uh and and let the culture tell you who you are or who you should be the culture will try to push you to what it really is they'll try to push you to be like everybody else in the world they'll try to identify you as old-fashioned they'll identify you as a certain class of people and try to make you be like them I understand this now all right that we need somebody to name us somebody identified me for for myself somebody identified me and said this is who you are so so we have to identify ourselves with something today identify is to recognize recognize something or somebody to prove that that person is who he is you know in the in the courts whenever you you have a victim uh and they need to find out who the suspect is they line up a group of people uh foreign now I wanted to get a subject but I won't do it I won't put anybody um make anybody embarrassed um so I'm going to ask everybody can you guys just do this one thing for me I want you guys to look at your face nobody no you need this right you can't look at your own face you need something to identify yourself you need to identify yourself with something identification there's many things we don't know about ourselves until we identify ourselves through something else and then we can see who we truly are yes almost amen amen did you know that Jesus went through the same thing you are going through today did you know he grew up the same way that the culture or the people identified him a certain way oh you're an illegitimate child right oh he's the son of the crazy woman oh she says that she would she had a virgin birth oh that's the crazy family oh that's that's him that's how the world identified Jesus Christ I see for 30 years for 30 years they identified him that way oh he's Joseph's son oh the the poor family that makes makes uh tables oh it's it's them oh it's her oh it's him oh that person oh it's a person and they put him in a little category category let's look at uh Matthew 3 16. what happened now this is the first time that God spoke to Jesus that we can see in the Bible okay Jesus he goes up to John the Baptist Jesus Bautista Jesus or John the Baptist just finished preaching saying that there was going to be one whose sandals he wasn't even worthy to unlock he was going to baptize them not with water only but by the spirit or by the the fire of the Holy ghosts now here comes this little stoop shouldered man the illegitimate child the the son of the crazy woman what is the world identifying you today you know you we have to be careful to not to accept what the world thinks of us he he was baptized right when he comes up right when he comes up the spirit of God comes down it says it comes down like a dove and foreign the Lord identified him how by his voice or we should say by his word how do we identify ourselves that's a good question how do we identify ourselves who loves the Lord oh if you truly believe it I want to see hands if you truly believe that you're a child of God I want to see Hands then you're a child of God praise God Gloria praise God that you can be identified with him so I know who what your core identity is now I know what's your strong identity it's not the church member it's not it's not the the worker out there it's not whatever the world tells you your core identity is Jesus Christ your core identity is what the word says that's your identity the word says you are my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and his identity was revealed through his word so through his word we are identified how am I identified I need something to look at myself through his word brother brother salcello says we we've got to read the message over and over and over again until it becomes a revelation and when the word is revealed to us then your identity is revealed in the word now I want you to understand that our people how is my identity revealed in the word because in the world and the voice of God was said you are my beloved child so in that voice he was truly revealed who his true identity was so you look in the word and you read it you said and read it and read it and read it until it becomes a revelation to you you will see yourself and you when you believe it you'll see you'll identify yourself there identification why porque because if anybody believes that they that Jesus died on the cross for them [Music] then you're identified in the Bible when he died you know it was for me that is the identification so the first time we see God speak to Jesus he was identified brother Branham says and that's what we want to look at tonight I want to look at me now this is in the message identification in 1963. he says I want to look at me who wants to look at themselves who wants to know who they are see he says I want to look at me and I want to want you to look at yourself as we look into God's Great mirror of his word let's be able to identify ourselves with some with some that we're going to speak about some characters of the other times I want to see myself in God's looking glass because if anything your show where you're standing in this book there's no book like it because it's all the truth is you want to see where you're standing you want to balance yourself you want to see where you're at with the world and with the word read your Bible and the the mirror will show your condition he'll show you who you are he'll show you how to fix he'll show you how to be identified with Christ when you become identified with the scriptures everything from Genesis to Revelation is you the Genesis apocalypse is then you become I am not I will be tomorrow I will be and you fluctuate with the cultures fluctuate with your feelings you're five people within a year no identify with your with the scripture and you will find I am what does I am it means he never changes significant it means you've got an anchor significant it means your identity will always be stable you'll know who you are every day the good days and the bad days I am I am Jose I am a child of God I am redeemed when you can't say that well when you can you never say I was redeemed or I will be saved I am you'll be solid but brother Branham oh I love when he he began to say how he was as an American yeah he says I am an American and you have to identify yourself with America he says I was there with George Washington George Washington he said I was there in Plymouth Rock in Plymouth Rock he said I was there he said with Stonewall Jackson Stonewall Jackson he said I was there I'm identified with that then he says just as much as that is a Christian should be identified with the word When God Says in When God says let there be there I was there Joseph when God said to Job where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy I was there I can identify myself there I was there and I will be there in the Rapture yesterday I am identified with the bride of Jesus Christ oh to be identified with him the brother Brandon says the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold La Novia is now her righteousness now why does he say that pure gold because brother Bradham says the more you beat the gold the more the reflection the more the reflection of the beater you become a reflection of God so her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him like that where is my identity it's not over there with the world it's not found somewhere in Netflix with some movie out there it's not found with all the the influencers out there everybody that raised their hand that says they are a children of God your identity is found in him what is he or what is he she is to reflect okay your identity is him what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her life whatever the world is identifying you as whatever the devil is saying about you the Bible says there is no fault in you when you are found in him she is all glorious within and without Aya is from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her sums up and manifested the Eternal wisdom of the purpose of God is amen praise God glorious so so when all this culture is pushed on you with all this world is that that the devil is attacking your identity he has you in a slave mindset he has you not allowing yourself to push out the true power of God the Bible says that that or brother Branham says he says that he was almost co-equal with God [Music] he was almost co-equal with God he was God's right hand man but because he wanted to be God that was his desire to be an image of God but that wasn't his lot to have foreign but then there was a certain creature that God says let us make man in our own image that's who you are you are in the image of God nothing less you are children of God and because of that the devil hates it that's what the devil wanted it's okay then Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the Devils foreign now this is the first time in chapter four that the devil speaks to Jesus and and when he fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God in chapter 3 God says this is my beloved Son this is my beloved Son he identified who he was by his word he'll identify you for many why did you get a little temper here if you're a child of God if you're a child of God why do you do this what is the devil doing he's attacking your true identity he's attacking who you truly are but you know what when you get that Revelation nothing can stop you when you get a revelation of what the word is if there was a man that knew who he was Jesus that was Jesus for Jesus he was the person that I've heard say I am the most he wasn't afraid of who he was the Bible says or in 10 times the Bible declares that he says I am he says before Abraham was I am he says I am the door and because he says I am the truth the life and the way he says I am the Good Shepherd he knew who he was if you truly not want to know who you are you don't have to grow up and mature and do all those things one day you'll find out what your career is one day you'll get married one day you'll have um steady job um those are all layers of your identity yes but we should be on top we should be the core identity is that I am a child of God I was until the devil said this is I will be but let me let me just get some things done first I am a child of God I am loved I am redeemed I don't care what the devil says I don't care what the what anybody says about me what the kind of identity they want to push on the importance classified God I am a child of God Amen Let Us stand to our feet amen oh Lord we just want to give you the honor and the glory god Lord because only you only you can show us who we truly are father and brother Lord you said through the words of your Prophet if the church finds out what her true position is the rapture will take place the Bible says that all of creation is in Earnest expectation for the manifestation of the sons of God lord when your children can understand and be revealed who they are Lord a Rapture will take place that's why the devil has such to grip on the young people's identity Lord foreign [Music] Lord when we know we are just like you said we know that we were bought with the price when we know that we will redeemed Lord we were in the back side of God's thinking Lord oh nothing can hold us back nothing can can bring us down Lord why because we have gone to our place we have come to our original sonship the sonship that Adam
