========================================

them directly and they would speak to the people it was God in the form of the pillar of fire in an exterior form that would guide the prophet and then the prophet would guide the people and then the time came when God came down and incardinated himself and we had the Lord Jesus Christ walking in between our midst they no longer had to follow these men which they followed a pillar of fire but God himself incarnated himself and then they followed the God man the Lord Jesus Christ but then the Lord Jesus Christ left the scene and it seems like we have now returned back to the old uh uh Old Testament times where these prophets would follow this exterior representation of God which was the pillar of fire but Jesus himself said that that they shouldn't be so sorrowful that I'm not going to leave you but I'm going to give you a uh a counselor I'm going to send you my representation and I'm going to send you the Holy Ghost now it will no longer be his exterior form but now he will be now within them as he was with the pillar of fire but now inside of them so that he could walk in them so then can follow that representation of the Lord Jesus Christ and then brother brandham says man is only a man until he completely surrenders unto God then at that point the deity of God dwells in that man the Holy Ghost it is no longer the man but it's God in the man which is doing all the work so then now it's no longer man that's leading us the the man that's preaching to us the man that's teaching us but it's God within that man the Holy Ghost which is guiding us but it seems a bit deceiving and today we also have that today a man came he came to us and he brought forth a testimony and he showed us great Miracles and wonders and he brought us a a message where only the few only the few we're going to worship the God that was in the man because there is a very fine line where they accuse us where they say you you worship a man no we worship the god that is in the man you glorify the man no we glorify the god that is in the man just as Paul said GL and they glorified God in green brother Perry green once said that he was accused of speaking so much about brother Bram that he would always speak about him and him and him and so then he responded and the truth is I feel that I don't speak enough about him I should and I should speak more about him because in speaking about brother brandham and speaking about the message that he brought the life that he lived the Miracles that happened throughout his ministry the more that he would speak about him the more of the glory he would give unto God because brother brandom never appointed it to himself his message always pointed to the Lord Jesus Christ and brother per said uh that there is no word in the alphabet to be able to describe or give enough Glory unto God can you imagine that we tell him that God Almighty the great miracle worker the the great king and word after word after word but yet there is still not enough words to be able to give him enough Glory because he is infinite and there is nothing that can actually describe the glory of God and if they could put the the slideshow of Hebrews 11:7 and it says like uh it says here by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen yet moved with fear prepared an arc saving of his house by which the he condemned the world and became he of the righteousness which is by faith uh by faith or by faith Noah was uh warned of God of things that he has never heard of that he never seen he was hearing things that were contrary to the scientific researches how could it rain in that day how was it that the world was going to get flooded and by faith he heard and he obeyed by faith and fear and reverence he built an ark and by faith he was an heor to righteousness so then the key we see here is Faith and the faith in what in the voice of God how is it that Noah heard God he heard it through a voice a an audible voice and what is it that we hear today Donald Trump not the voices of Donald Trump not the voices of the government and the politics but we hear the voice of God a messenger sent from God from to us that comes directly from the Throne of God with a message as it was with no that he told Noah Build me an ark going to destroy the world go and preach to them to repent even though it was something strange that he couldn't understand because first of all Noah and in hearing this voice which was speaking contrary to the popular belief he first had to believe that that voice was coming from God and so then you have to go back to the scene of that day and it was never heard of such thing that it was going to Reign upon the Earth so then he believed that it was God and then after believing he had to accept that he was going to receive criticism from the whole world that he was going to be isolated and talked about by the whole world and just start to think about what was it that they were thinking about Noah when he brought forth these so strange and crazy ideas because he was just a single man he wasn't a whole church he wasn't a denomination he didn't have an organization backing him up it was just a single man with a single message even though it heard like a new message but it was not a new message it was a message of Salvation they heard of the message of Salvation in the times of Adam and Eve how there was going to be a day to be able to escape and how God was going to save them but they didn't know that recognize that this was the messenger for their day that there was going to be a an age of rescue for salvation and just in the act of being a new message or that it was something new and strange for their day that still didn't change the fact that it was a message from God something that God sent to his prophet to bring forth to his people just like just as it is today in our day in this age there was a prophet that came to preach the serpent seed and then the religious people were saying what are you talking about a prophet that came to talk to us about a chosen bride and then they say what are you talking about what is this about a bride we their church one Prophet that explained to us the seven Church ages and the religious World maintained themselves confused a prophet that opened us opened up the Seven [Music] Seals and the religious World stayed in in confusion those are the words of God towards a prophet to give unto a people but not only just a people but only a few just a small little sheep that was going to hear that voice and recognize what that voice is and recognize where that voice is coming from and accept that that's the voice of God only a few and then if you go into the book of uh Amos 37 and everybody should know the scriptures by now if they're message Believers surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his secret unto his servants to who losetas the prophet losetas the prophets and if Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever it has to be the same today in our day and God has sent us a prophet so that this scripture can once again be fulfilled and so then if I ask the question once again what kind of proof do you have that you've heard the voice of God can we say what kind of evidence that Noah or Moses heard uh have to be able to say that they heard the voice of God we could say that we didn't have a tangible uh evidence to be able to say that they heard the voice of God and I myself don't have something tangible that I can prove it but the one evidence that we should have it's that untangle evidence of the faith of faith that is hidden deep within the most uh deepest part in your heart where nobody can come and take it away and brother Bram said that there's no bomb on the earth and there's no Intelligence on Earth that can never destroy the faith of God in a child of God because faith will remain forever and there is no weapon on Earth and there's no science on earth that could ever destroy Faith that's why I rejoice when brother Jesse was preaching unto us what did he tell us uh the other Sunday that Faith knows no bounds why doesn't it know any defeats because that's what God Said and the word says the heavens and earth shall pass away but shall never pass away this body shall pass the planets of the universe shall cease but the word of God will never be defeated will never be destroyed and if my faith is anchored on that word and the essence of my Foundation is tied down to that word then my faith will never be destroyed because that faith and that word are one and they are Eternal this body shall pass away but my representation in Christ sh shall never pass away the word came to Noah the spoken word came Noah and it caused him to be known as the crazy man to the world a uh an ignorant man and the uh spoken word also came to Abraham and caused in him that he leave his family that he left his uh land and that he would also leave his religion and then the Curiosity kicked in I understand that uh the Bible says that Abraham used to worship idols and then I began to study and what kind of religion was Abraham coming from and then according to the Bible and then the history facts and then in the region in the time that he was living in they would worship the god of the Moon and then when this voice of God came to Abraham just as it came to Noah to give him a message that contrary to what they knew about and he believed it and here we have Abraham who also was worshiping the the god of the Moon idols and everything else he heard a voice a very strange voice something different contrary to what he already knew but even then with that voice that was speaking against contrary to everything that he knew about he recognized and obeyed that voice and that's why the scripture says my sheep hear my voice so then there had to be a representation before the foundation of the world so that just anybody here could that is entangled in another religion entangled in in sin or entangled in anything about the world that they when they hear that voice of God that we can turn around and then follow that voice not caring what kind of uh or how contrary it would go against our beliefs there was a voice that spoke onto a young man and and told him in an audible voice don't ever defile your body don't smoke don't drink because I have a purpose for you and this same voice told this young man now a man just as John was the first Forerunner of the you and your message shall be the second forerunning of the coming of Christ and in the same voice this matured being an evangelist being a pastor being a prophet if you can get the people to believe not that you deceive them into believing you but that you be sincere and that they genu even cancer can stand before you what a tremendous thing is to be able to go into that scene to see when a man can completely surrender themselves to God and accept the whole word of God and hear and obey the whole word of God the things that God can do with that man how God can give life in that gift of the man how would bring forth to life that ministry that's within that man but it is very necessary to hear that voice and if we're not hearing that voice of God today then we're hearing another voice world and it is very easy to hear the voice of men just as a man that's behind this Pulpit just as he is outside in the streets and just as brother bradam said that it is very necessary for that man to be filled to be filled with the deity of God so then then we can know that it is not the man but it is God in that man and then there's a saying uh saying that says that history repeats itself and Christians also have a saying and it is more than a say if I could say in that manner that this is an eternal declaration that history repeats itself but with the Christian we say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever just as he was before and he repeats himself and does itday and he repeats it and does it again tomorrow and brother B says that all scriptures have a a double fulfilling a double fulfilling in that fing it was hidden and it was hidden for The Prudent and the wise do you know who it was revealed to to the little ones to the ignorants to the nobodies to just the few were that revealed and so the Bible repeats itself Adam redeemed Eve josea redeemed go and Jesus Christ redeemed us and today the people they all believe or claim that they believe God and the things that they haven't even seen but just with the things that they see right now in their day and their generation that are going on in the world the wars and the things of the world they see it now but they can't and they don't want to accept or believe what God is doing in their day God already sent a we have them on video we have them on audio have it for written and there's so many testimonies of what God is doing today and what God has done today God sent a man with the spirit of Elijah that foran the first coming of Christ and so then he sent another man that will also have the spirit of Elijah to forun the second coming of Christ and the people cannot see it but only the few are the ones that are going to to be able to see be able to understand are going to be able to believe with that faith of God and the people themselves how they admire of the people in the past of how they would take a stand and how they would stand against those religious traditions in the past uh people like Martin Luther and all these Martyrs from the past but what about the today yesterday I ordered that book of um uh Fox of the martyrs I myself want to study I want to hear how these Martyrs were how was it that they stood up for Christ what is it that they suffered what is it that they had to go through in case is or is it that what I'm going through right now is it that my battles that I'm going through right now are they even worthy of Christ can they even compare themselves to what the martyrs went through and if I want to be a Christian I am also going to have to suffer it says in the scriptures that many are called but only a few are chosen only a few are chosen and how is it that I can identify myself with those few if he suffered then I'm going to suffer if he was rejected then I'm going to be rejected if he was crucified then I shall be crucified as well but if he resurrected then I'm going to resurrect as well and the scripture says in 1 Peter 2:21 for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us he suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps if uh Christ suffered it was for a purpose for an example unto us and then just the act of being Christ then we're going to suffer like Christ that's why he left us his footprints in the S and then in John 16:33 these things have I spoken unto you that in me me ye might have peace how many of you are in Christ Jesus this morning then you have peace this morning in the world ye shall have tribulation all of you said that you were in Christ Jesus this morning but this carnal man where does he find himself he finds himself here on this Earth with afflictions and tortures and so on but the scriptures say in the world you shall have tribulation good cheer put your confidence that I have overcome the world so even though that I'm going to suffer even though I'm going through these tribulations and if if I am like Christ and if he overcame then I am going to overcome if he's my example then I am going to be an overcomer then we'll be more than an overcomer let us remember the age in which we live in the the seventh age is our age [Music] and if we try to align this religious world of today the Church of today to any other age in the world and the only one that it will dovetail with is the age of Leia because today is the perfect thing that what what the Bible is speaking of of the age of leoda and brother Bram says that means a woman the people's rights rich in need of nothing and the statue that represents the United States is the Lady Liberty Lady Liberty in and in the scripture that or the description of that statue it says that it's a woman that fights for her rights exactly what brother brandham describes about Le and if you research the the inspiration as to why this uh statue came to be it was designed and brought forth by to be as a resemblance to a Greek goddess uh which is the name Elia Liber uh that's her name in English it's a a a Greek goddess the goddess of Liberty and that is the statue that we have placed before our country and then when this uh statue was inaugurated and presented it was exactly 20 years after uh the Revival inza Street or 20 years before uh in 1886 and then the Revival on isza street was a 1906 which was also the beginning of the leodan age you see now how doveet tals with one another ending that age of Philadelphia and then beginning the age of leoda and Satan giving the footsteps for the leodan spirit and God himself giving the footsteps for the uh day of Pentecost giving those footsteps for those gifts of uh the holy ghost that followed and opening up the path for that uh the seventh messenger and in those years that dovetailed with one another Satan preparing himself but then also God preparing himself Satan preparing a woman that Lady Liberty that Goddess that Spirit of leoda movement of my rights and my rights and my but God was also preparing a woman a bride in this end time with power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost bringing her through the whole full word of God and it says in Revelations chapter 3 and verse 13 he that ha an ear let him hear saith unto the churches and unto the angel of the church age of leans write these things and the saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable and poor and naked behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice if there's anyone that can hear that voice in this day of leoda if they open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me and brother bam says the condition of the church I see that the church is going to the lean in this little isms and these all these Trends and these Sensations that are upon the church and they're separating one another marrying with the worst things that could ever happen and I know that it is time and I can't hold back anymore there's something within me that makes me shout return to the word return to the word can't you hear Brother Bram when he preached in Los choosing of a bride the kind of conviction that he had that it was no longer brother but it was God in the man that he would tell him repent repent that great and terrible day is coming then I can hear Brother brandom's voice here shouting return to the word and I believe that is for us to return back to the word but in this age Jesus finds himself outside outside of the church door out outside of the door of our heart and we're surrounded with so many Churches of Christ Billy Graham even Billy Graham he said if the Holy Ghost was taken of the churches 90% of the activities in the church would continue on only 10% would have the Holy Ghost would it be managed by the Holy Ghost but the other 90% it would be a program made by man because they no longer need Christ bil seeing that Billy Graham wasn't even a prophet he himself also had a level of revelation to be able to see this in the Book of Revelation chapter 3 to see the condition of the church in this day how is it that they have the Lord Jesus Christ outside and it is so sad to go into that scene to see how Jesus is outside of the church respectfully that hot summer Hut that it is here in Phoenix and he's knocking for people to let them in to be stand a rainstorm knocking and trying to his own church but that Spirit of has Satan dwell Church dwelling in that church and being worshiped like God causing them to close the door on Christ and he's dwelling within the hearts he's sitting down laying down in our own living rooms making people close the door on what a sad story but there is hope there is one great hope and zecharias 147 says that great hope for our day just as brother brandham said a double fulfilling a prophecy for the future a prophecy for our day there shall be a day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to [Music] pass that the evening time it shall be light that in the evening time there shall be a great light a great messenger a great messenger that will open up our eyes and will take us by the hand and will lead us unto the feet of Jesus Christ in midst of all this religious confusion in the midst of all this darkness of deceitfulness there's still light in the evening time so then in returning into Revelations chapter 3 we can then fulfill not as those but we are the few not the many outside but those that or those that have all those riches those miserable and wretched but we're the few that says in verse 21 to them you that overcometh will I gr sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne more than Overcomers we're Christians we are like Christ he suffered and overcame and he's sitting in the throne and we ourselves will also be sitting in that we're in that evening time in those last days and there's not much time left we see by Ministries that keep bringing forth more and more Revelation and here we find ourselves in this day and in every day an overcomer but we are a special kind of Overcomers we're an Overcomers that overcame in the darkest age we overcame in the most deceitful age and the hardest age and so then Brothers have that assurance and confidence that you will not be deceived and if it were possible they would deceive the EV but the good news this morning that we will not Beed and we have to tell Satan this morning can't deceive me because I am the elect I'm a part of those few and I identify myself as the bride of Christ Noah preached to the whole world but only a few believed that word Moses delivered many of people but only a few entered into the promis Jesus preached unto multitudes and multitudes but there was only a few that went into the upper room and this message has also went throughout the world time after time but there's only a few that will believe it and there's only a few that will identify with it that it was not God in the man through the man but the Holy Ghost in that man in the days of Noah there was two types of Believers and Enoch he was raptured in the days of Noah and Noah stayed behind so then he had to go through the tribulation but Enoch represented the Bride of Jesus Christ in which I believe that we identify ourselves and Noah represented the church that was going to go through the tribulation but he was also going to make it to the other side he was going to make it to the promised land but I don't want to be like Noah I want to be like Enoch and I'm tired already of the tribulations that I'm going through right now and and I'm already tired of the suffering that I'm going through right now tribulation that I will not be partaking and that's going to be the Great Tribulation because I will be raptured with my Lord Jesus Christ and then in the days of L there was three types of Believers those evil people of Sodom and gomorah which were destroyed left and right the Believers as lot those borderline believers those that put one foot in one that today they believe but then tomorrow they'll backslide I don't want to be like one of those Believers but then then there was also the elect like Abraham those that recognize that God that was incarnated that mzc that brought him forth the message to the Earth that heard that voice that recognized that it was God himself I want to be like one of those elected if you wouldn't mind standing with me we're going to be closing now the scriptures say the musicians can come up now the works that I do you shall do also and greater than these shall you do and if we see the story of the uh of the church after Paul who came to fulfill those scriptures who was doing these great works who was doing the same works that Jesus did no one until a man came will Mariam brandham by the name of William Mariam brandham a man that was so separated from sin a man that was so filled of God he was ordained of God that this very man was doing the exact works of mzc to see and know the intentions of the heart that they had that discern of heart this very [Music] man was doing the works of Jesus Christ The Miracles raising the dead bringing things into existence nothing like this was ever known until this man came to Earth William BR by the name of William Mar and Brenham and he was more than a prophet he was the messenger and in rejecting him is rejecting God and I want us to remember very well that in rejecting a prophet of God is rejecting God himself in the old days and the Old Testament when they would disobey the prophet they were disob oey God when they would go against the prophet they would be going against God and if God is the same yesterday today and forever and God has sent us a prophet with one message and we reject him it's as if we were rejecting God if you wouldn't mind closing your eyes brother Bram says in the message s is this the end time oh God send us a prophet with courage with a thus sayith the Lord that has that Vindicated word that is going to move with it and he's going to be proving that he came from God and when he comes he will out all the ages sure he will he will be against this leodan age surely he will just as he was in every age he won't change in this age he has to do the same brothers and sisters if you [Music] recognized that this messenger is the voice of God it is time that we should consecrate more it's time that we align ourselves once again and we're by coincidence we're here because we've heard the voice Jess just as our brother Jesse said the voice of God said take that television out of our homes and he received the confirmation in the evening which it was spoken of the same he heard of so then he listened to that voice and he took out that television maybe some have that television but we have obeyed the other part of the voice but it is time that we listen to word of God we're all in different stages different levels but the main goal is to reach the statue of a perfect man and that is the reason why he sent us this Angel messenger if you wish you may lift your hands and ask God God help me from this day forward that every word of conviction that comes into my heart that I can apply that to my life and I understand that I'm lacking a [Music] lot but I will take it just one day at a time step by step because I have believed in this uh voice in this last AG will BR of a messenger called William Mariam brandham father help us to be better Christians to be able to get to that great and I ask for my brothers and sisters that you help them and you give them comfort that you strengthen them and strengthen [Music] me so that we may be able to make it to see that day in which we will be transformed in the blinking of an eye in the name of the Lord
