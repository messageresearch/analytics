and amen amen amen amen god bless you yo las vegas uh you may be seated puente mars my title this uh this evening is the importance of your bible importance it's a very uh simple title a very simple message the importance of your bible importance i believe that each and every person has one of these i believe each and every young person should have one of these this is something that is so important to a christian cristiano something that sometimes we don't know how important this thing is this is life to us this is the greatest thing that god has ever given us is his word the bible says that you shall not turn to the right hand or to the left but it will if you go and you follow it it will prosper wherever you go so we know the story of joshua josue joshua was in the border of the promised land josue estaba from and god began to commission joshua josue and when he began to commission him he said this is the most important thing he said if you want to prosper in everything that you do because if you want to defeat every enemy if you want to be successful in your life now we have the whole bible and a messenger that revealed it to us and if we want to prosper in our life young people if you want to prosper in school jobenes lascuela if you guys want to prosper in your job if you want to be prosperous as a christian cristianos don't turn from your left or to your right no stay with the world [Music] so wherever you go that word will illuminate your pathway there's a question that once a person asked brother branham in question and answers preached in 1964. he asked the question he said how can a christian get deeper in love with god i think each and every christian has that question and has that desire christian how do i get deeper in love with god brother branham said such a simple quote he said read the word and pray because read that word and you get closer and closer to the lord and reading the word and praying are both types of communication we speak to him when we pray hablamos and he speaks to us when we read we're having a communication with the lord communication we're getting a deeper relationship with the lord you you progress your relationship with him by doing these two relations you enter into another level you get deeper and deeper in love with the lord it's it's a uh act of progression in our lives as we read the word in second timothy 3 13 and second timothy ii timothy 3 13 uh all the way to 17. now so these two reading your bible and praying it's a progression to get deeper in love with the lord right in timothy 13 or 3 13 it says but the evil but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived so in the world people get worse and worse and worse we go out in the world we're we're not going to stay the same we're not going to be what we are right now nosotros almond no no no but continue in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them continue in those things that you have already learned verse 15 and from a child thou has known the holy scriptures we we've almost everybody here has been raised in the message we know the holy scriptures so from that of a child on thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus christ jesus this this might not be a great amen sermon today but for the young people i want you guys to understand why the bible is so important for us why is it so important i never why do we have to go to church why do we have to do certain things there is reasons there is benefits why we do certain things but there's reasons why we do the things we do you don't so in verse 15 it's amazing what it says here it says and that from a ch from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise unto salvation so they asked brother branham a question how do does a christian get deeper in love with christ what is it a progression and the scriptures the bible says that it is um is able to make us the progression unto salvation the you're not saved because you read the bible let me read the bible and get some information and i know i'm saved because i read the bible no but as we read the bible it causes a change it begins to change us in our lives we don't have to read it it's not something that we tell you to do that's not something for a religious duty but it will cause you to change into a christian cristiano it will save you as you begin to read it and read it and consume it all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine what's doctrine teaching for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so it's profitable for doctrine or doctrine doctrine is what teaching doctrina is you need to learn something from the lord necesita since you'll find it in here love as evidence como evidencia just like it's the same exact word in uh in hebrews where it says faith is the substance of things hoped for commodity questions so it's for evidence and it's for instruction in righteousness this is a guide for us so that we can learn and we can grow and we can go all the way unto salvation 17 that that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works to be mature to be grown to be accomplished is through the word of god now the word that really struck my heart it says all scripture is scripture is given by inspiration of god that word inspiration means god breathed in psalms 33 6 and um psalms 33 6-9 and straight by the word of the lord so by the word of the lord where the heavens made and all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth so the scripture isn't just penned by man and and their ideas this is not ideas of who god is this is not a book of philosophy no libero the philosophy this is not like any history book where they have to continue to revise it this is god breathe this has been inspired by god through the very breath of his mouth it said that the worlds were made by the word of god and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth so you cannot have if i'm talking you cannot have my breath without my words they go to and they go together you have my words you have my breath the hebrew word for breath in psalms it means spirit significa so these are divinely breathed from god the scriptures that you read and it tell this tells us that the worlds were created by these same words this little messed up bible my little purple bible my only purple book this is god breathed is the same words and the same spirit that created everything are the same words contained in this book this is an important book este libro importante every book has been changed every book has been updated this book has stayed the same throughout the ages throughout the years were created by the word of the lord and the spirit of his mouth so when you're reading your bible with an open heart all the power of god is working in you it's the same word and in the same spirit that is available to us when we read our bible es el mismo libro el mismo spiritu cuando lemos young people i encourage you to go outside if you can with all the lights here in phoenix in phoenix look at all the stars look at the expansion of the sky miral expansion del cielo look at how great the mountains are miraculous and the valleys in the the the ocean and how great it is that was caused by the word of the lord and and to think of all that that what would happen to us if we take in that same word and that same spirit god created these beautiful things in the earth every every mountain you see every valley was created by the word of the lord and that same word what what would happen if you read it with an open heart what would happen in you if you take in that same word that same spirit the spirit and the word will always come together it does not have one without the other el espirito la palabras when the word was spoken the spirit uh is dispatched and it and it moves and it creates so that same holy spirit that was in the beginning of the principle it's the same holy spirit you have it that's the same holy spirit that created all these things the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh so what was that word that same word that same spirit was christ jesus jesus and that same christ jesus christ jesus he lived he died for ourselves he rose the third day and he poured down that same spirit to us now de ramos mismo spiritu para nosotros that same word that same spirit now is living inside of each and every person that accepts it so out of nothing the word created everything out of nothing out of nothing not another the word created in all everything we see now la palabras so there might be people here with with great faith there are people that that are there might be people in here that are that have faith uh some that have little faith unos and some that don't have any unos i don't know maybe but the word will create out of nothing you don't have faith nothing is fair the bible says faith comes from hearing hearing the word of god i can say i didn't have faith at one point if i would have had faith i'd have been serving the lord a whole long time a long time ago but i did not have the faith but what changed my heart but what can change your heart what can make your faith grow by hearing the word of god so then we're beginning to understand that the bible isn't just something that we have to read and it's a book of rules you don't have the faith to move on to the next step with the lord faith comes by hearing the word of the lord very simple you will grow in faith you will grow unto salvation it has just as much creative power as it was in the beginning he will ignite that faith that seed that was always in there before the foundation when you open this book that maybe has been sitting in your dresser for a while collecting dust just just open it and read it just see the importance that god wants to talk to importance god wants to reveal his thoughts to you so faith comes by the hearing of the word it doesn't come anywhere else i see people that have faith out in the world that's not true faith the true faith comes by the hearing of the word that is faith in our lord jesus christ faith in his word if there is no word in your life there is no faith ton says it's very simple it's like well why why do i why can't i move on with the lord why can't i get healed faith comes by hearing the word you don't hear the words you know you're not faith that is growing you don't hear or listen to the word there is no salvation that can come to you yes for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and the joints of the marrow and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart man that gives you a whole lot of information there first of all the word of the lord is quick so this book it doesn't mean it can grow legs but you read it and it's something will work in your life no significant and it's sharper than any two-edged sword it's a fine uh edged knife or scalpel that it can separate between the spirit and the soul that it's so great that it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart question so it discerns you while you're reading your bible it's discerning your thoughts and your intentions i once heard brother billy graham say billy graham every time you read your bible it's an interview with the almighty god when we think we're reading the bible the word is reading us and what's amazing it begins to expose things in our lives we don't need anybody to go tell us what what's going on read your bible and it will begin to reveal things it will reveal things in your life that maybe you've you didn't know what was going wrong it will expose things in your life that you didn't know you're doing wrong that's what the word does and you know what every christian should run to it and put themselves in the balance i just feel like something's wrong you even a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of your heart that's what the word of god does it's a powerful tool it is is jesus christ this is god in written form estos jesus christ amen amen in 1st peter 2 and primera de pedro capitulo it says as newborn babes desiring the sincere milk of the word that she may grow thereby and if and if if so be ye tasted that the lord is gracious so the young people today those that have just given their hearts to the lord the bible is milk labilla and and the only way we can grow it is by eating the word espor comer la palabra it says the only way we can grow is by the sincere milk of the word the universe you know i um last week was a very strange um week for me i was at work doing what i was supposed to do and there was this man that stopped me stop my boss and i uh and he began to say that he was praying praying for um somebody who he could give some books to orlando and there are just books of how you can grow and how you can just mature as a person here and i began to look at how much those books were they they're expensive he said here these are your books i want you to have them i want you to grow as a person i see how you're working and i want you to um just continue to grow he said that he felt led by the lord to do that he prayed so that he knew who to give it to el estudo it wasn't the bible or anything it was just so that it was a books to help you grow as a person persona and that's what books do yes you can get books to to um allow you to learn certain things books will allow you to achieve certain things in your job or your school or your life libros brother branham says in this message on a mother's day el mano brandon i might um pass this on to the young people do you know that abraham lincoln never owned a book in his life until he was after 20 years 21 years old but the bible and the fox's book of martyrs martinez so he didn't have any other book only the bible and fox's book of martyrs see what you read molds the character that you are miran what you read what you consume molds the characters what are we doing here questions it's just a good question to think about what am i on social media am i doing other things that's molding my character questions so brother brandon says no wonder we've got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines estos revistas deficion and vulgar and nonsense placed on our newsstands he owned the bible and fox's book of martyrs look what it made him when paul began to talk about or begin to judge how a a christian becomes mature christian he judged him by the food they consumed our growth depends on what we eat is not based on how old we are or how many years we've been a christian cuantos anos emocido cristianos that's not how paul measured the people when he was talking to young converts he gave them the sincerity of the milk of the world and that's how he measured the people yes it doesn't matter if you've been in the message for 20 years if you've been a christian for 20 years i can tell you the word can tell that's how i can show my maturity that's something very important that that i want us to understand people are trying to stay away from the deep things like right if you've been in the message for 20 years and you still can't get over something yeah i'm not going to base it on how long you've been in the message but i'm going to base it on what is in the word what you're consuming paul based it on what they consumed in hebrews 5 12 it says for though um for though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of god for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness since he is a child but solid food is for the mature for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil pero alimento solido espara los quiana alcanzado madures para los que por eluso tienen los entidos so we are judged by what we eat and as we continue to consume in this continuum we grow the bible is not treated it should not be treated as information but it should be treated as spiritual foods so and the bible will meet you wherever you're at if you need milk read the bible if you need meat read the bible it will meet you at where your spiritual condition is but it's not okay to just eat once every two weeks twice every week when brother the brother so-and-so comes and preaches that's when oh i got a good meal today we're going to stun our growth it's a spiritual growth this is not something that is a rules that you have to do but if you feel like you're not growing as a christian christian because we're not consuming the word [Applause] well the lord has never talked to me audibly oh he talks to me every day when i open my bible every day the lord can talk to you every day the lord can reveal something to you and as as he continues to reveal himself to you what happens you begin to have a deeper relationship for the lord and it'll save you it'll put you all unto salvation and it will allow you to grow all the way to a deeper relationship with the lord relation by just reading this simple book this book that maybe you don't understand oh this book that it's just so many things i don't understand but we have to go in just like how we open up the word here in church and we pray before we open the scriptures and we ask god lord take control of this that's what's happening when the word is opened lord i just i don't know what to to read lord but i commit myself unto you now let this word anoint me let this word uh become a revelation in my life lord maybe i haven't been living the right life senior quesadillas reveal it to my to me lord it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing what the word does the bible uh will meet you wherever you're at on so where did we learn from where did we where do we learn about jesus where did we learn him from don says jesus how do you know about jesus jesus the bible la biblia from where is our christian faith based on establish christianity the bible everything we practice as christians christianity is a result of the bible our whole faith and religion exist because of the bible there wouldn't be a seventh angel without the bible nobody around septimous we would not be here right now in this service without the bible we would have no hope without the bible every foundation that we have this is very important to read es because if i say i'm a christian christian and i don't even know why innis or i don't even know what's in this that causes me to be a christian christian something's not right says right we could say well no as long as i know jesus jesus this is how you build the relationship how do you know how he's going to think of you como sabes how does he how do you know how what he wants you to do without reading the bible it's all based on the bible if you're a christian cristiano this goes with you everywhere now it's on your phone you can just take it wherever you want to teleport that's just an automatic thing if i'm a christian i'm reading this she said cristiano esto it's very simple as muysen see you if i'm not a christian i'm there's no reason to read it this this word shows the plans of god for us and his thoughts isaiah 55 8-11 it says says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither my way neither are your ways my ways declares the lord. for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts altos caminos a lot of times we stop right there god's thoughts are higher than our thoughts we can never know what the lord is his thoughts are they're just too high standing in an open field once try to touch the sky you can never never touch it that's as high as god's thoughts are from ours but in verse 10 it says for as the rain and the snow comes down from where heaven and do not return but but water the earth making it uh bring forth sprout giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater por que como de siende de los shall my word be goes out from my mouth and it shall not return to it empty but it shall accomplish that which i purpose and shall succeed in the thing which which i sent it a sia but just as the rain comes down to the earth and waters the ground causes the seeds to turn into plants and allow the earth to prosper que la tierra prospera is the same way god wants his thoughts to come down from his mouth and that it may lay in our hearts god doesn't want his thoughts up there god wants his thoughts in our hearts he wants us to be watered by the word so that's what god's intention is yes now in closing i just want to say how did adam and eve lose everything they reasoned with the word what what does in joshua it says do not turn from your right or to your left stay with the word there's a reason why how can i stay with the word if i don't even know it how can i fight the devil with the word if i don't even know it the devil how he took over the whole entire world they got away from the protection of the world so the reason why it's so important because even when jesus was on earth the devil tried to do the same exact thing why is it so important to stay with the word because when he was faced with the devil when he was faced faced with the temptations so he could have said something that was never said in the old testament because he was the word but he didn't do that he got words that isaiah spoke he got words that was already quoted from the old testament and that's how he faced satan brother branham says an identified masterpiece of god el monobram this is he showed how the weakest of christians can defeat satan with just the word el mostro como los cristianos con solo la palabra i love that come on we have no excuse no tenemos excusa to be beat down to be kicked by the devil no just use the word on it he could have um he had powers he could have smote um satan any way he wanted to but he didn't use it everywhere it's written so he defeated saying by the word of god so it doesn't only cause you to grow [Music] just don't say it all you know what i just uh just don't say anything to the devil and he'll go away you shouldn't be talking to the devil use the word no us use the word and he has to go uh if you knew how great the word is how powerful it is that it is alive against people oh man oh yeah just like i spoke the last time i spoke on confession confession means say what he says grab that word in in joshua 1 it says do not let the word depart from your mouth you use it and you speak the word you begin to confess confess your salvation you're not using your own thinking what an amazing thing god told joshua to do okay do not let the word depart from your mouth that was the same joshua josue that told the sun to stand still that was the same joshua josue that began to speak to the this so whenever he confronted with with things [Music] in ephesians 12 6 12 it says yo for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places i remember when i was in el paso once in el paso and i heard brother judah mata preach yes he uh read this scripture and he gave an example of if we played against an nba player he said imagine if you go and maybe you're pretty good in basketball imaginative and you go and you try to play against lebron james you play against michael jordan michael jordan you play against all these good those great soccer players we'll get slaughtered we have no chance [Music] why because we're amateurs there is no match there's no way we can defeat them that's how it is when we're being tempted by the devil don't you reason with them don't try any slick move on [Music] rulers in high places rulers of darkness against powers and principalities these are seasoned players we're dealing with every time the devil began to say well why don't you take this rock and make it into bread so you can eat it jesus begin to quote the word jesus what did the devil do queso diablo he's smart he didn't try to reason with him anymore he changed the subject yeah he said okay okay i can't get him with that one all right come over here and god jesus began to just what combat him with the word every when you meditate on it day and night you keep it in your mouth you will prosper that is a promise that's not a promise for me that's not a promise from anybody else but the word of the lord it said keep my word in your mouth meditate on it day and night and your ways shall be prosperous that is that thus saith the lord in joshua 1 7 and josue read it that is god telling us that you will prosper in everything you do prosperity whether you you struggle in life whatever goes on in your life you will overcome everything because you have the word on your side heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass never so it uh if you'd like to stand with me and uh musicians would like to come up the word is an offensive or uh is a weapon of offense uh the helmet of salvation defensive el casco shield of faith breastplate of righteousness but ephesians 6 17 it shows that the sword of the spirit which is the word of god that is a weapon of attack that's a tool of attack yes that's that's what we use when we go out in the world how can i defeat the enemy if i don't even know the word so i got this question how much do you know your weapon cuanto con no arma how much do you know this how much do you know if you're concerned about your growth if you want the holy spirit see they say if you want healing see necesita if you want faith seekers just read the word read the word and open your heart and every time you read that word god will perform a miracle in you i promise that with all my heart because that is a promise that god has given us amen let us bow our heads amen heavenly father father celestial lord we're just so thankful for your word lord lord we ask that that we just take this so seriously that when the whole world is going into shambles when heavens and earth pass away [Applause] whether we're lord whether we need the holy ghost it'll give us that holy ghost lord you said your word is a seed father [Applause] but they have a desire to open up those sacred scriptures and lord that you may reveal yourself unto them lord we commit them each and every person into your hands the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] again [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] me [Music] me back [Music] [Music] you're wrong [Music] [Music] [Music] see you one money

your eyes to hear your eternal scriptures lord to hear the breath of life that you've breathed into us lord jesus lord jesus that may we hold on to that what we've heard today lord jesus christ may we be well equipped or maybe be well equipped with with the right defense [Music] amen lord may we may you try us lord jesus with your word yes lord because heavens and earth shall pass away but your
