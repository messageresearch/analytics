Christians Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written curse is everyone that hangeth on a tree is that The Blessing of Abraham might come on to the Gentiles to Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith holy Brethren I speak after the manner of men but man's Covenant yet Fab confirmed no man this a noeth or added there too is now to Abraham and his Seed where the promises made he saith not and the Sea and to to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ let us pray or God you know Senor or father help us Lord considering this occasion in this moment that is that the ages and time has gone out Lord we come on today foreign by Jesus Christ Our Savior we pray Lord amen amen you may be seated are you happy to be in the house of the Lord today is Friday it's a good day to come to the house of the Lord um our bodies may be a bit tired working the whole week pero guardamos but we keep fuers we keep the strength and energy to come and present him a worship to our Lord with our presence here let's go to the word of God I begin with a quote of brother Branham entitled The unchanging God um uh March of 1960. Jesus Jesus said the word of God says the word of God is like an unto a man who sown a seed that's in the seed like it was in the beginning and on to the person that it was given to because that comes from eternity in the beginning a story of redemption we have come when the times have gone [Music] and the things have moved somewhere there's something that does not move that is our God he does not change and what he has established it cannot stop being he has enough power sufficient he has enough creativity to make a go local of what he has made it to be in the beginning we know that there were two trees the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life and Eden there were okay came from a seed a they'll be it's and it was ordained for us to live by this from that tree Jesus Christ stops eating from that tree he enters into time and enters into a corruptable stage and here's where we're at now may the Lord bless us so cuando El Senor when the Lord when he knew that this was going to happen he prepared everything [Music] the messenger tells us God's purpose can never be defeated and there's something for the children of God is going to keep them always going forward that we cannot even be defeated and that's called Revelation amen amen where no matter ah a Pedro to Peter the Lord told them blessed art thou is for no for no one to do this flesh or blood he's angry nor neither flesh nor better but my Father which is in heaven Thou Art Peter he and do we identify with those blessed tells us in a message in the message the great warrior David paragraph 49 in Spanish just hear very well we need tonight what night is this night [Music] thanks be to God for that is there any ones amongst us have you heard Goliath both has he puts itself before you what have we done have we stood up like David like saw no not right it fell in the ears of a good of a right young man this young man and this way it has been revealed and he was the son of God and he had an anointment since when that's the key since when that does not change I like to think the prophet circular circular dimensions Amber is the color of Life do we know that right he and it comes with a great anointment but uh estimular to simulate to stimulate what okay those hearts before the foundation of the world that were associated with Islam because they were believing genuine of the word of God that is Incorruptible in which to be given to light given the light I find through the teachings okay somos Dallas we've been we gave birth three times and how is that yeah where did you get that from from the message to get us into movement amen and through the line um of the word of God see man that Upper Room it speaks about that yes or yes okay and then cuando estos corazones when these hearts and see those stimulados were stimulated and we're going in faith righteous is the righteous and glory and Glory one day possibly will finish that Earthly journey and the messenger said in a funeral Billy here comes the life amen [Applause] a young man once again amen with that life that Circle of Life a young man of 21 years of age 21. where does that come from the prophet says every seven years something happens man amen the nature of the Sun the nature of the light I love that doesn't matter what he does the doctor says nothing can be done something has to give us Comfort here we accept Christ Jesus to receive him and for one day under the light of the logos that we shall come forth to be new creatures in Christ Jesus we need him and a message faith is Works expressed how many of the Lord [Music] this is a matter of love is it's an old love story Adam and Eve in the garden saliendo going out Adam didn't want to leave her leave his companion her companion he want to do something for her he decided to follow as soon as it's an old love story for her he said if he can love her like that I shall go for them and he descended from Glory foreign [Applause] they have to come back it's an old love story yes it's the old story of Redemption how many you love that means and the message works is Faith expressed um Jesus said can come to me padre except my father primero draws him first okay no man can understand who he is what that is to you by revelation of God and then conference you act accordingly as a Believer I added that here we see plenty that God is revealed in Jesus is be sure to read that scripture Saint John uh can come unto me except my father draws him first yes and all that the father has given me they will come to me they will come when did he give it to him before the foundation of the world how many are those are here foreign that's the only lineage in paragraph 124 in Spanish just a little bit before that sir no man can do that Persona not a person doesn't matter if it's good doesn't matter who you are it has to be revealed and know who Jesus is in Plainview just as others the word of God is a seed that's precious here it is we could do a great harvest a great harvest a hundred percent our pastor would say just to see the stock coming up leaves coming out just to see the shock coming out we want the grain now is the time amen amen lamies the the the harvest is ready to sing laborers onto the Harvest there's no labor there's no harvesting there's no Harvest then there's no bread there's no bread then there's no life we need that of the Original Seed is that's where the children may the Lord have every Church of the message to eat they don't give him the bread then they're going to find somewhere else but we are responsible to give them something to eat [Music] of the original a bread of life he said yes that has descended from Heaven may the Lord bless us the the ground prepared beforehand if you sold the seed simply and you just throw it out to the out there on the ground it will do no good the birds will pick it up if you throw it among thrifts this was the Thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon Jesus parable so then the ground has to be made ready first the natural typifies the spirit so then in his Sovereign Grace Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew you but before knowledge ordain you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason you staggered and you staggered but you you're here where you are now it was God leading you to the place where he had foreign that you have there he left a million for you you can occupy good people no malientes not not bad people people the people who are right but they didn't have something that's something that you do have predestination A Heart That was predestinated you're able to receive him to receive what to receive the message of the hour may the Lord bless you brethren it's a love story the prophet tells us what was first or faith faith in the answers because with eternal love it's great great being reborn of Incorruptible seed less the scripture says to go where we're at now that our great great grandfather which is Abraham is he also your great great grandfather he is my great great great grandpa okay because I'm the Seed of Abraham in the dictionary to find that but we are the children of abrahamas through an Incorruptible seat the seed of the word [Applause] and he wrote a registry there you can find me yeah but my second register of my new birth it's not written here it's written up there in the book of the heavens unto Abraham was the promise and onto a seed s he does not say seeds as of many he's not talking of the natural seeds he says unto thy see which is Christ that was found in Galatians 3 verse 16. when Saint Paul preaches us to the Galatians you can remember that the Galatians of their primitive way of believing isao Paulo and Saint Paul comes and he corrects them they started in the spirit and they're going into the first you're going backwards asike so then stress and verse 24 of the third chapter of Galatians decent it says where for the law was our Schoolmaster it was our school there's only a school a teacher only to take care of us to bring us to the genuine things to me to that lie eternal life that light that goes in the circle to Christ that we might be justified by Foreign anymore [Music] by faith in Christ Jesus Christ for as many of you has been baptized have put on Christ there is either Jewish there's no mail nor female Jesus in Christ Jesus Christ then ye or Abraham and heirs according to the promise brother this is something to start dancing The Heirs I would be just content that my father my parents would have just left me a building and leave me a ranch say mansion but this inheritance for the children of Abraham may the Lord bless us Abraham Busco he looked for a city and Builder is God a city with Foundation con fundamentos with a Vine Foundation where shall we be founded in a Divine Foundation and The Rock in the rock of Revelations to be called the children of God a seed an Incorruptible seed s here in in finishing he um the message communion friction 65 in Spanish in paragraph 43.45 and 46. the first book of life appearing which you have asked yourself where did this come from what are these strange things but it happens on to us he'll go and take that example they're in the field a strange egg an occasion is studying a bit in North America you have the Eagles here in North America there is an ego that represents the United States as the bald eagle Americana the American Eagle that's a species uh when it brings forth eggs it's not a chicken it doesn't put it every once in a while and when it puts when it lays it it's common but he lays only one muchos he doesn't the eagle doesn't Place many eggs I don't know if anybody has know that but I know a little bit of it but I called my attention that the real ego is because there is a real eagle and that egg in a shell s this have these little portions in the Shell okay they're like they have the red color it says they come out a bit with a bit spots when I read that oh Senor I said Lord I mean the real Seed of Abraham a man a man Jesus christovino Jesus Christ came in and it's Sanctified so for us to come forward like the seed oh that's incorruptible it's so low commentary that's only our comments let's see what the messenger says what are those strange things that was somebody different you know who the branhams were um because of the last name because he says because I was born the Charles is I was born by Charles and Ella Branham and then by their nature I am a sinner the world would say speaking lines Psalm 51. and all those worldly habits that are within me foreign um everything that a sinner is I was I was raised but here in the Bible there was there was a small sign of life since always all the time it does not abandon us it cannot leave us that is that is the predestinian plan of God aura now El sitake that in his household Christian or anything else he speaks about his contact with nature in his story but it says but one day I said Senor I said Lord there's something here manifest yourself he took a step and he was born again and he was born again song our our lives are like that Lily and the message how can I overcome and paragraph 92 in Spanish I think the same in English says like I said in the beginning you are born defeated because you're born what a surprise to Satan that he was gonna come across some people friend they was going to confront himself just like David confronted Goliath you come to me this way of the Lord of hosts the armies of the Living God [Applause] may God help us I want to finish defeated and we come to a church the messenger says defeated defeated Victoria we gotta come to some real victories because my father that's my father's throne and he says like the Lily and it types us as the Lily Flores Bonitas prettiest flowers that the prophet light flowers I I am very fan of those great comments of the lily take that and I hope it helps it's a little C down the bottom of a muddy monkey Pond and that little seed is you're there in that fragrance here comes that honey but if they're in that mud and has to come out it has to be raised up outside there he is displayed I believe that this was placed because here we come some lilies she has to fight daily there exists it's dark it's very muddy it is but he knows that there's something in here and that they're in that in that pond is [Music] expressed himself and expresses what's hidden in the inside and inside of it all the time since when shout it there is the children of God were already there foreign [Music] in the beginning Manchester at the same same Paul said eyes that have not seen because for us when the sons of God are manifest o the creation is the the nature is waiting for the manifestation of the children of God the first thing is we have to be sure who we are what are we doing why are we here tonight in the evening when the light has come forth but by the word of God that brings forth light that has pulled us out a word that lives and stays forever God's purpose [Applause] it cannot be stopped may God be with us let us
