shall we go but unto him his ways into his feet how many are happy this morning how many are designed to hear from the Lord this morning once again I apologize for my nervousness I just want to congratulate brother Jose and sister Mirna was not just released just really want to congratulate you both because I understood that uh just recently he had his birthday and then something special the baptism of his daughter yeah and then I just got some new news today praise the Lord foreign [Music] and there's so much joy in my heart [Music] so that's why I want to congratulate you [Music] I'm going to embarrass you a bit brother and if you can forgive me for that Ricardo uh first time I met brother Ricardo uh the young men we had some fellowship it is we went out to eat for some dinner [Music] Ricardo we were fellowshipping there with the young people and with brothers and throughout the time that we were having that clean healthy fellowship and Christian Fellowship the goal was to try to get to know this young man and we talked with him we started a friendship with him we tried to show him God's love the best way possible and as he poured out his heart which was a bit tough for him to I noticed that he had a very good spirit in heart there's something really special inside of him and he didn't even know the words that he said but there's always a deep calling another deep we don't know it so we need from God out here in the world Cristiano born in the world or born in a Christian home we need God in our lives you must be born again [Music] and he said those words [Music] and we said what do you wish for something do you feel something you see yeah he says I've been having it's been a good time now that I've had an emptiness inside of me it is I don't know what it is but I know that I need something else I need something and the news that I got this morning is that there's another soul that will surrender I don't believe anyone forced him or manipulated him but he out of his own choosing has come here and has listened he's seen God's power here in this place and today is such a happy day if I'm happy how much more our brothers are happy it's a great joy for me in my heart the best choice you could have made in your life you're my confirmation this morning this morning's title for the message is the the choices we make I'm not a person prone to get overly excited but I'm just full full of joy this morning I think Brothers for the opportunity I've been sick over a week the Thanksgiving the from this new cold that has been bothering me even before Thanksgiving and I said if my voice doesn't come back to me then I'll be unable to preach this morning God gave me all the symptoms and but not did not take away my uh voice so because of that we're here this morning [Music] if you have that desire that you know you need from God we're not here to put on a show this morning to display the almighty God this morning so just as you are standing if you'll be so kind to open your Bibles so the book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 32. once again the title is the choices that we make I'll switch over to English now Hebrews 11 32. it reads descent and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell you of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jephthah and of David also and Samuel and of all the prophets bow our heads in prayer Lord Heavenly Father Celestial what a beautiful and rejoicing day this is this morning Lord once again another Soul surrenders your life to you guys might be Souls they want to rededicate themselves to you this morning they want to grow in you guys as we all just want more and more of you this morning guys father help us with this small and simple talk this morning and take us in the path you want us to go today forgive me Lord for my shortcomings and let it be you that speaks to your people this morning open up every heart from the one speaking to the one listening correct who needs Corrections and may we all just grow in your word according to the measure that we need this morning Father we love you guys because you first loved us we put this service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated Brothers thank you brother I appreciate it once again the title is the choices that we make if you'd like to go into the scriptures in the Book of Judges 11 hours we're going to continue on or piggyback the the scripture in Hebrews and it'll be starting in verse 30. we're going to be talking about it says and Jeff the vowed a vow unto the Lord and said if Thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands then what then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon shall surely be the Lords and I will offer it up as a burnt offering Victorious and the children of Ammon were subdued unto the children of Israel I see foreign and and she said unto her father respond let this thing be done unto me and and let me go into the mountains and beware my virginity and he and he sent her to go away and she bewailed her virginity in the mountains and it came to pass at the end of those two months when she was mourning the fact that she never got to get married never got to have a family or children Familia she returned back to her father who did according to his vow which he had vowed I was I was a little unfamiliar with this story and as I dove into it I I didn't realize how impactful the story how many emotions are in this story how many nuggets are within this story and once again the title the choices that we make and I know we all believe in predestination and the foreign baptized if I go out into the world God will bring me back some way somehow this is because in the end everything is already predestined my choices don't need anything it means is because God's in control of every single little thing you know it's kind of funny because then you could think more than God ordained me and foreign to make mistakes to make every single choice that I make one day we're gonna find out that the choices that we make has a lot to do what happens in our personal life like the choice our brother Ricardo is like the choice last week or two weeks ago that our sister Lydia has made it they had to make that choice is the message what thinking of Christ you've got to make a choice God compels you to make a choice you can't leave that door tonight you can't leave that door this morning without some sort of choice apprentices it's impossible is impossible the word is Flowing if the word has been bred is and it's making an effect in your life there's a choice that we're going to make it's impossible that we leave without making the choice we spoke a little bit on this in Flagstaff in Flagstaff there was a choice presented to him when he was asked what part of the land do you want he was it was put in his hands to have the first choice of the lands if you like the snow if you like the desert if he liked the the green trees he could pick whatever he wanted it was his choice no one was imposing upon his choice he didn't consult Pastor Abraham and therefore he made the most devastating choice of his life to move him and his family even closer to sin family a choice that cost him the life of his daughters and the life of his wife was a Christian he had a church he had a pastor and God's grace if you read the story it was with lot throughout his life he was given Grace to choose wherever he wanted in the land God's grace went found him and took him out but even through God's tender hand in his life there were still choices that lot had to make and we have to make the right choice you have a choice God made it so that you can choose if he put Adam and Eve on free moral agencies so that they can choose and then they made the wrong choice then he can do no more than he can do no more to you than what he did to them he's got to put you on the same thing so that you can choose or rejects is plain and simple you have a choice you have a choice as a young man whether you're going to have an education or not you have a choice of your conducts you can look like a decent human being or you can be one of these weird creatures that they have out there is courses are seen and they're completely against the word of God so are we understanding we have a choice we need to make the right choice you know young people here today you can choose who it is that you want to marry it's in your hands you see guidance you see counseling you put it in God's hands you see the signs from God but ultimately you make the choice and because of the wrong choices that we make in marriages those wrong choices have brought about the choice or the option of divorce and then maybe we find ourselves well God why did you let me marry that person yeah why did I marry her why did I marry him this confusion that comes about in us if I could say I think the only person who could say to God if we could say uh uh could could kind of get a little uh uh rough with God Adam Adam didn't have five women to choose from Adam didn't have 10 20 30 churches to pick sisters God that's the woman you gave me you gave her to me I didn't choose her but young Brothers young sisters God's given you plenty of sisters here in the church plenty of little brothers here in the church that you can choose from choose from make the right choice and if they're not here there's a church down the street there's some Believers down the way there's some in the next town the next city if she's not here he's not here they might be in New Mexico in Colorado and Texas they might be in Mexico in Mexico God only knows they might be in in I think this morning we have some brothers from Pakistan is Pakistan but you've got to make the choice Young Brother young sisters because your choice will affect the rest of your life the message leadership each one of us has to make a choice and it's confronted to us you know you confront somebody it's in your face so that choice is in your face is but we're all confronted with this one thing is brother Ricardo and Manuel Ricardo brother Brian says we're all confronted with this one thing what are we going to do about eternal life are we going to live here after or not then we've got to come to Jesus to get it Jesus that's the opportunity of choosing that's the one thing God gave us he just lets us make our own choice so you have to not be forced but just make your own choice you know looking at the Rich Young Ruler Alberta I really loved our brother Louise preached on it here and he also preached it very beautifully out there as the story tells us all he wanted was eternal life and what's amazing about him he just wanted to know what do I got to do to get it and when it was put in front of him the choice was put upon him he just simply failed that test Jesus gave him the answer but he walked away Jesus says that was the most fatal mistake that he ever made the choices that we make a foolish vow all right he he made a foolish decision with that vowel the Rich Young Ruler made a foolish choice where we walked where he walked away and we know where he ended up God did not predestinate Jeff to the sacrifice his daughter God could not predestinate jephthah to sacrifice his daughter God did not predestinate the Rich Young Ruler to walk away it was the choice that they had made so going back to the story of jephthah we see as we read that he really had this desire for God to deliver this people into his hands I don't know if maybe there was some arrogance there or just this Grand confidence in God or maybe just some sheer ignorance but you said you know I'll give you a sacrifice you do this for me and it's amazing the scripture says the word whatsoever is whatsoever comes through that door not whosoever goes through that door who knows what he might have been thinking maybe that part of his house that he was vowing to God whenever he would go out through there maybe it was a lamb that would walk by maybe it was a a bull or a donkey or an animal that would pass by that was the pattern of his day Victoria but Jefferson wasn't feeling the same way he never expected his daughter to walk through those doors foreign but I forget that these quotes over here say a little different the scriptures over here tell me one thing but the scriptures over here revealing it in just a little bit different of a way his duty should have been to take bowls and bring them back to the center is put them into a balance so then can we blame our decisions on God's predestination just a question to think about can we blame our personal decisions on God's predestination decision is that against God's word that were the case they were just puppets the strings dangling from on top of us and he's making every single decision for us so then do our actions our choices do they affect God's plan affected you know I I don't know if our brother Edward is here this morning Edward but we have the the pleasure of getting to know our brother Edward a few weeks back and I think to myself you got predestinate our brother Edward to go to prison foreign that he preordained and he he predestinated that I buy him the newest cell phone so they could be on it all day I am the newest video game so they can play on it all day I let him play with his worldly friends all day listen to that music worldly music all day and be able to say God predestinated I didn't have absolutely nothing to you know sometimes we blame God for those things but then sometimes we're a little more righteous foreign the title the choices that we make you look at Abraham the same like he only had one son Jeff's only had a daughters and God told Abraham we all know go sacrifice your son but the word says you can't do those human sacrifices so was that against the word of God was what God told him against the word God never intended for Abraham to sacrifice his son through their foreign Abraham was following the literal word of God that was spoken upon him foreign that was a commandment to him though he might have scratched his head no he found it illogical okay God told him to do this he did not expect what was going to happen in his life you know sometimes when we're in church the presence of God Is So Heavy it's not done that atmosphere that anointing in the building is very important for us to be wise for us to be balanced in the vows that we make God because sometimes that tremendous Supernatural feeling when you're shouting praises to God like like I remember my brother Boaz in Camp in America when he couldn't contain himself and even with his injured legs anointing so heavy jumping up and down on the stage praising God speaking in tongues crying tears of joy sing it with all your heart dancing in the spirit you feel so good sometimes we can make a vow to God under that anointing and and I remember I have shared my testimony plenty of times you know the same thing happened to me when I had my experience 11 years ago I have morning on a Sunday I asked God give me a signal if you give me one that I can believe I vow or I promise to serve you I didn't stop there in no matter today I'll be honest I didn't know what I was saying I made it ignorantly at that momentum but I made it honestly in that moment and I also told him that morning I'll testify of it anywhere that I go okay because I know it was real to me he gave me the sign that morning I thank God I've been serving them ever since I don't plan on stop serving here I said I would testify wherever he takes me he's taking me all over the country and all over the world to testify from here to El Salvador El Salvador from El Salvador to South Africa El Salvador Africa under that anointing I didn't even know that I was making it God kept his part like you did with Jeff and all I can say is thank God they're up to right now I've been holding on to my part okay I pray as long as I'm here on this Earth I can keep to My Vow with God I don't know what vows you've made in your life I don't know what needs or what what desires you've had in your heart you made God that if he'll do this you promise to do that but if it doesn't impede your Christian walk I pray that you can keep that value made in privacy with God God answered and he made it to God no I heard a brother say it like this and I'll repeat the statement don't make a vow under the anointing that you can't keep out of the anointing so don't just make a vow just to God just to make a vows just to look good with him we're not in the business of fitting in with God we're in the business of being one with God so being serious with God love relationship with God he's more than just a friend to me he is my lover so don't make a vow with God just to Simply make a vows what happens Monday when the spirit has gone off for you when the 19 is left you forgot to have breakfast in the morning you woke up five in the morning for work now you're late and frustrated are you going to keep that vow under those terms in those moments those circumstances maybe you made a vow that was too high for you to keep so let's go back to jephthah he made it to Hebrews chapter 11. where they mentioned the heroes of the old testamentions men they mentioned Samson they mentioned David let's mentioned Samuel Samuel so jephthah wasn't a Mr Nobody was he anointed of God then when he made that vowel to make that burnt offering will he never imagined it would be a loved one then maybe it could be his wife his daughter some family members would God be the one to do that to him why did Jeff to follow through with the vowel maybe it was out of ignorance foreign enticing spirits espiritus even here in church when the spirit is moving someone genuinely can be having a Holy ghost-filled Experience here at the altarment and an enticing Spirit of nostalgia can come upon somebody of excitement of tears of somebody and it's not the Holy Spirit coming upon somebody but it's an enticing Spirit coming upon somebody sometimes it's very sad to say or and sad to believe that not everyone that comes to the altar okay come for genuine reasons I don't know yet enticing Spirits espiritus how many of us have made wrong decisions in our lives I've made plenty I'll confess I've done I've tried to do services to God without it being his will I'm sure I've been enticed by the wrong spirit before in my life so how many have made wrong decisions in their Christian Life this is that don't make no difference [Music] he still made a mistake David was elected he still made mistakes even Peter Aunt Pedro who was a hand-picked disciple is he made mistakes when he denied Jesus three times Jesus gave him a glimpse Jesus a little glimpse of predestination a glimpse of foreign God made Peter deny him I don't think God wanted Peter to deny him if anything I believe he was sad that Peter denied him looking down saying look at the Miracles you've been through is all the signs and wonders you've seen all this Faith you it's the foreknowledge of God that knowed which one would be right and which one was it right so by foreign he wanted me to go out into the world he wanted me to renounce the message he wanted me to spit in this Bible no that's silly it's illogical that's completely against the word he ordained us for Perfection he ordained us to help so good works wisdom salvation all these things so then how can he then ordain me to sinuses not even for divorce the prophet said he said prophet the greatest thing next to Salvation is your husband or your wife when I was studying they just kept blowing me away because the more I think about the choices that we make decisions it has so much to do with our Christian walk and if we take something so simple as our choice for marriage our good husband or a good wife ordain you to divorce what he called the greatest thing next to your salvation I can't explain the only answer I can give so is we make that choice but thank God foreign [Laughter] but it was never his will that we would do them the message it is I Be not Afraid this is so amazing here he cannot save you against your own will salvate you don't want to be safe you're a free moral agent it is you can turn it down oh you guys talk about that old white man Prophet guide my brother's there South Carolina brother Perry and a predominantly black church out there there's a lot of believed Christians in that area they give them so much criticism oh man y'all are crazy listening to that old white man they are free moral agents brother Brown says you can turn it down but you can accept it we're in the midst of a Hispanic congregation who chose to accept this English-speaking message or human language it's a Celestial race Celestial language and we chose to accept it says he cannot heal you against your own will contr but was that our first choice or was that our second choice because my doctor couldn't heal me and I'm a Christian is so Cristiano oh that's right I can go to the best doctor you don't work that way he won't heal you if you don't want to be here go to him first and then he'll say you know what yeah you've got the best cardiologist in Maricopa County and give you your healing through that doctor is against your will we spoke about him not too long ago he too made his choice but he knew that when the time came he would betray Jesus because he could not ordain him to do such a thing we just read in several messages we are free moral agents you want to betray Jesus you are more than welcome to portray him want to exalt him you want to accept him you want to be baptized like this morning our brother Ricardo just chose to be baptized then he foresaw that you wanted to be baptized predestinated for you to be baptized and like our brother the decision he made today yes and somehow merge it into that that perfect will through God's sovereignty yeah when I imagine I kind of see like a road and how it is that we make the wrong turn he doesn't grab a hold of our wheel and force Us in the wrong turn maybe something caught her eyes so we went the wrong way we're not his perfect will no foreign foreign Al final God only has one perfect will it's black or white is Blanco or negro either you're in that wheel oh you're out of that way Romans 8 says for whom he did foreign he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so predestinated I love him I hate him I love him I hate him he's going to Hell she's going to heaven he's going to Hell she's going to heaven God cannot do that God doesn't work that way God gives us a choice amen otherwise he can't send people to hell he couldn't do it it wouldn't be just of him to send him to help we're getting to the end of the message and why some people can't keep the victory now a man's on the basis of free moral agency this is now I'm going to make you do this there's people that will only hear this gospel once in their life and with that one single time they'll accept him but there's people in the church that will hear it their whole lives and will never truly accept it and then there are those that are here for one time and they will go to hell and others that will hear it just one time and they will go to heaven now think about that same Story of Lazarus forgive me of the Rich Young Ruler um and and and we're told he went to hell is and how he saw Lazarus in Abraham and how he started screaming for help for his family everyone yes if you can Lazarus go back on the other side if Abraham can go back to the other side that's where the prophets can go back to the other side then my family will accept him but how does it say it don't matter if they go back they still will not accept him so there's people they will hear once or a million times and they still will not accept the word of God [Music] but thank God for his grace that all of us here in this building today we have yet another opportunity to correct maybe of that we made with him to correct maybe a decision we've made in our lives pain and suffering that we've been going through maybe we can recognize this morning God doesn't send anyone to hell yes if we're going to hell it's because we chose and if we're going to heaven if we're going to meet our Lord that's because he foresaw is and then he stamped a seal of predestination Upon Our Lives that we would choose him in this day like our brother Ricardo it shows you know this morning we don't need to have a funeral service this morning when this old man dies I want to bury him kick him get rid of him light him on fire get away with him don't give this body a funeral service I want to have a celebration of life service celebrate the life of God in Me do whatever you want to do about it he can't make you love him and he don't want to force you to love him if my wife has to force me to love her foreign but blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we love him because he first loved us and that is why we serve him cannot program you to love him it doesn't work that way that one day you tap into hey one day you tap into love no it's got to come from you it's a choice that we have to make the music if the musicians like to come forward and the message proving his word and if you like to play something Softly you know it's it's it's you know why the music is played in service when the minister is getting ready to finish yeah and ask the musicians to come forward it's because there's a word that has been spoken there's a word that has been read there's an atmosphere that everyone has created and when there's that pole the atmosphere is just Amplified through that music providing that pathway for you to come to his feet we're maybe in the doubts or maybe in in embarrassments the atmosphere can be made perfect for just you know I find it amazing even when the musicians don't get asked and you see in different churches they have the Revelation they have themselves because they're connected with God to help create that atmosphere is predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ God's not saying I'll choose you and don't choose by foreign [Music] [Music] out the New Testament of the new testamento what happened to brother Branham what was the decision that he made one simple decision that he made one choice that he made it cut the life of his wife short it cut the life of his daughter stored in his life the consequences of our decisions made here on this Earth we need to be very careful because what we're going through many times it's just a product of our decision maybe somebody in here today I don't know I want to make it to Heaven God but you just keep giving me these trials you keep putting these hardships upon my life one thing it's another if this gets in my way then that gets in my way God he's like you're holding me back no it's the choices that we make noise that's holding us back God's will for you God's will for everyone here is eternal life is God's will is that nobody should perish Jesus Christ came to the worst on the Earth so that you would choose him our decisions our decisions they won't affect our predestination because God already saw that in here we all have mistakes with all that shortcomings but the choices that we make [Music] they're going to affect our lives restaurants [Music] and everything in between but Branham says and what you what went ye out to see you can't help being what you are I can't help it even if you're a sinner you're not responsible for being a sinner you hear that this morning you're not responsible for being a sinner you're responsible for remaining a sinner there's a way prepared for you but to be a sinner you was born that way God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior repent and take Christ as your savior you refuse to take the right Road you send your soul into its Eternal destination upon the free moral agency of your own convictions God doesn't send anyone to hell because and he never will men send themselves to Hell Los Hombres men send themselves to hell because they refuse to accept the way of salvation close your eyes jephthah was a man of God he was a hero he was a Christian but he made us foreign he killed his daughter he broke up his home he broke my word but he kept his vow foreign throw barricades across your path but you walk on your own decision and many times we'll say if the Lord will take this evil spirit for me of drinking and gambling and lying and stealing the tomatoes
