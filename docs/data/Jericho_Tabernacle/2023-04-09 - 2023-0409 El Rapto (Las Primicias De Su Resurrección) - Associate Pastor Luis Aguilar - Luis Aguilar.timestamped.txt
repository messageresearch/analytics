[1:12:10] something that was faked

[1:14:20] verse 15 foreign
[1:14:38] I would uh
[1:14:39] Miracle of Senses
[1:14:41] Colossians 1 15. he said El is
[1:14:50] the image of the invisible God the
[1:14:53] firstborn of every creature
[1:14:58] of the invisible God Amen Brothers
[1:15:03] we look in the scriptures
[1:15:08] there's people that say the invisible
[1:15:10] God Amen Brothers
[1:15:13] we see that with Moses
[1:15:19] and God allowed him to see the back of a
[1:15:21] man
[1:15:24] and being a man I say what a privilege
[1:15:27] it was myself
[1:15:31] the God's back
[1:15:34] I would have loved to seen God's back
[1:15:39] foreign
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:39] the firstborn
[1:16:42] of every creature
[1:17:40] he's the firstborn among the Dead
[1:17:43] the first fruits
[1:18:42] and then the others come about
[1:19:33] now
[1:19:39] in this glorious scene that we have
[1:19:41] before us tonight
[1:19:45] primavera is Jesus up from the dead in
[1:19:48] springtime caminando walking around
[1:19:52] up from Spring the Resurrection
[1:19:58] The First Flower arrives from the dead
[1:20:01] our lord Jesus
[1:20:04] he was the first fruits of them that
[1:20:06] slept
[1:20:08] the Easter flowers
[1:20:15] the first one that stuck its head out
[1:20:17] after the cold midnight of darkness and
[1:20:19] sins
[1:20:21] price
[1:20:24] and God raised him up on the third day
[1:20:28] we believe this is
[1:20:32] God raised him up on the third day
[1:20:35] according to his promise
[1:20:38] and we believe it according to the
[1:20:40] scripture
[1:20:41] that he raised up the Third
[1:20:46] he was the first one that raised up from
[1:20:48] the dead
[1:20:50] the first fruits are the ones that sleep
[1:20:53] Jesus now we see the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:57] was crucified
[1:20:59] the scripture says he went to hell
[1:21:03] he went in priests
[1:21:07] and he took captivity captive
[1:21:11] and so in the old times in the Old
[1:21:14] Testament all the saints
[1:21:17] sacrificial the animals they make animal
[1:21:20] sacrifices
[1:21:23] they were forgiven under the blood of
[1:21:25] that animals
[1:21:27] so then what would happen with those
[1:21:29] Saints
[1:21:31] where would those Saints
[1:21:33] before Jesus Christ where would they go
[1:21:37] they go to the sixth Dimensions to the
[1:21:40] presence of God
[1:21:42] where did Abraham when he died say
[1:21:51] to A Place Called Paradise amen brothers
[1:21:57] that's why when Jesus was nailed to the
[1:21:59] cross
[1:22:02] that sinner was on his side
[1:22:06] and he said Remember Me
[1:22:10] didn't have time to be baptized
[1:22:14] I didn't have time to join the church
[1:22:26] today
[1:22:29] into Paradise with me
[1:22:37] in the Old Testament
[1:22:40] that did not go to the presence
[1:22:43] they didn't go to the sixth dimensions
[1:23:06] an adulterer
[1:23:17] like me
[1:23:21] you love God Brothers
[1:23:24] these men were under the blood of those
[1:23:27] of those animals
[1:23:29] they could not enter with God
[1:23:32] those Souls were just stored
[1:23:36] like that land of sleep
[1:23:39] until the Lord Jesus came
[1:23:43] and then his perfect blood
[1:23:51] unto the presence of God
[1:23:54] they were captive and waiting
[1:23:57] that's why the prophet says
[1:24:01] if you know your Bible the prophet says
[1:24:08] the reason that the witch offender could
[1:24:10] call the spirit of Samuel
[1:24:12] you remember the prophet Samuel died
[1:24:16] and what did Saul do you want with the
[1:24:19] witch okay
[1:24:25] and don't ever go with those witches
[1:24:29] you want to know your future
[1:24:32] how many children am I going to have
[1:24:36] let's get let me get my palm read okay
[1:24:41] read that sphere that ball that they
[1:24:44] read
[1:24:45] you want to know your future
[1:24:47] if you serve God you go with God you
[1:24:51] don't serve God
[1:24:54] there's your future Brothers
[1:25:01] they didn't have to pay a witch
[1:25:57] for the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:25:59] not take away sin
[1:26:01] but since Jesus died
[1:26:39] that's why these saints were there in a
[1:26:41] place called Paradise
[1:26:43] now let's go to Saint Matthew
[1:26:48] I hope you got your Bibles this morning
[1:26:53] good soldier always carries his Bible
[1:26:56] amen Brothers
[1:26:58] and
[1:26:59] San Mateo
[1:27:02] Matthew chapter 27
[1:27:05] verse 50.
[1:27:08] Jesus
[1:27:14] Jesus when he had cried again with the
[1:27:16] loud voice
[1:27:22] the Lord Jesus
[1:27:24] he cried with a loud voice
[1:27:28] the scripture tells us in Thessalonians
[1:27:34] the voice
[1:27:36] and the Trump of God
[1:27:40] who is the one doing that
[1:27:43] the Lord Jesus
[1:27:46] he's the one that's doing it bring in
[1:27:49] the message
[1:27:54] the
[1:27:58] Lord Jesus
[1:28:01] he said he cried again with the loud
[1:28:03] voice
[1:28:04] the shout
[1:28:07] gondos
[1:28:12] and the temple was
[1:28:15] from the top to bottom of the earthquake
[1:28:19] and the Rocks rent
[1:28:22] how many believe that the Earth
[1:28:25] there was an earthquake
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:32] I can't remember which mountain it was
[1:28:40] forgive me I can't remember what
[1:28:42] mountain or Canyon it was
[1:28:44] okay okay so you know
[1:28:46] that Sabino there there were two stones
[1:28:50] that fell he said and they got stuck
[1:28:53] together
[1:28:54] when the Lord Jesus
[1:28:57] a rose
[1:28:59] who the prophet has told us
[1:29:03] so then from here in Arizona
[1:29:07] this broke the whole Earth
[1:29:10] when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:14] the prophet says there's two rocks
[1:29:18] and they both crash
[1:29:20] and there's like a a path under
[1:29:24] how many of you have been there a man
[1:29:29] now the scripture says
[1:29:31] and the graves were open
[1:29:36] and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:29:39] slept a rose
[1:30:31] the Lord Jesus first arose
[1:30:57] along with the sinner
[1:31:00] first
[1:31:12] and they started to arise in their order
[1:31:15] now my questions
[1:31:19] and you can think about it tomorrow
[1:31:22] and think this morning
[1:31:27] after the Lord Jesus
[1:31:30] in the scriptures
[1:31:32] who was the second
[1:31:38] and just meditate upon it
[1:31:41] he says he and it says
[1:31:44] after his resurrection
[1:31:48] they went into the holy city
[1:31:51] and appeared unto many
[1:31:55] how tremendous right
[1:32:00] and appeared unto many
[1:32:04] fourth
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:36] and they started to appear unto many
[1:32:40] amen Brothers
[1:32:45] that's why the Saints in those days
[1:32:53] don't bury me anywhere else
[1:33:00] the Saints wanted in the resurrection
[1:33:02] they believe
[1:33:05] Joe believed in the restaurant
[1:33:08] Abraham believed the resurrection
[1:33:11] that's why in Genesis
[1:33:19] all the services
[1:33:33] that Abraham says
[1:34:41] he said I got all these kingdoms me just
[1:34:45] worship me oh no he said no
[1:34:47] I'm going to pay for it
[1:34:54] and then Abraham was married there Sarah
[1:34:57] all his children
[1:34:59] that's why Jesus said Joshua said and
[1:35:02] Joseph and Joseph said in Egypt
[1:35:06] don't you bury me here in Egypt
[1:35:09] don't bury me here yeah take my bones
[1:35:14] near to Palestine
[1:35:18] because my grandfather Abraham
[1:35:23] they knew
[1:35:25] that the resurrection
[1:35:27] was going to be in Palestine
[1:35:30] so don't bury me here now imagine
[1:35:37] Karen Joseph's body
[1:35:39] the Red Sea open
[1:35:42] they're carrying Joseph's boat
[1:36:09] that's what the prophet says
[1:36:11] he said Bury Me
[1:36:13] Not in Palestine
[1:36:22] a cemetery or a cemetery
[1:36:26] you can be buried anywhere
[1:36:29] just bury yourself in the Lord Jesus
[1:36:35] amen
[1:36:41] no the cemetery is Anointed
[1:36:55] God will raise you up Palestine
[1:37:10] Prophet said only them Christo that are
[1:37:13] in Christ
[1:37:17] how can we enter with Jesus
[1:37:19] you've got to be born
[1:37:22] you're born in the Bible
[1:37:28] you can find it in First Corinthians
[1:37:32] a que hora
[1:37:34] Academy
[1:37:37] what was the time where the Lord went to
[1:37:39] Paradise
[1:37:40] what time what hour
[1:37:44] he was crucified
[1:37:46] he went to paradise and what time was it
[1:37:53] the prophet tells us right
[1:37:56] the prophet says like this
[1:37:59] Prophet says
[1:38:02] Abraham and them they're in Paradise
[1:38:08] maybe sing in a good song that morning
[1:38:12] in the message God perfect in his church
[1:38:15] he said
[1:38:18] like at two in the morning
[1:38:20] here on the earth
[1:38:24] he went and knocked at the doors of
[1:38:27] paradise
[1:38:28] like two in the morning
[1:38:31] he went and knocked at the door onto
[1:38:34] Paradise amen Brothers
[1:38:38] now he says now we see the prophet says
[1:38:44] Israel in in the Red Sea
[1:38:47] El mourio he died
[1:38:51] his soul went down into him
[1:38:54] he preached unto the soul and prison
[1:38:57] souls
[1:38:59] to death
[1:39:02] unto the devil is
[1:39:05] and he came back on Easter morning
[1:39:08] and he came through Paradise
[1:39:11] he knocked at the door
[1:39:15] Prophet says I can hear him say
[1:39:18] children
[1:39:20] Abraham saying who is
[1:39:31] that
[1:39:34] I am the stone that was cut out of the
[1:39:36] mountains
[1:39:40] the Old Testament Saints
[1:39:44] waiting to be clothed upon in Paradise
[1:39:51] are we going now
[1:40:23] he said it's time let's get out
[1:40:27] foreign
[1:41:27] listen then they say
[1:41:30] we're recognized
[1:41:37] like when you went through the walls
[1:41:42] and you know they didn't even know or
[1:41:45] seek when he come in
[1:41:49] glorificados they had glorified bodies
[1:41:54] they appeared back on Earth
[1:42:00] for a first roots of the proof of God's
[1:42:02] power and the resurrection
[1:42:11] principalities took death in hell and
[1:42:13] they're on Easter morning
[1:42:16] and they entered in the Kingdom with him
[1:42:20] if you notice the prophet's glorified
[1:42:23] bodies
[1:42:24] we have three bodies the Earthly foreign
[1:43:49] the scripture says in First Corinthians
[1:43:54] that he appeared to more than 500 people
[1:43:57] at the same time
[1:44:29] don't you know what's happening
[1:44:32] this man arose from the dead
[1:44:36] so these ones they went home
[1:44:39] they start to eat with him and the
[1:44:43] scripture tells us
[1:44:46] there was one sign
[1:44:49] to recognize the Lord Jesus
[1:44:52] when he was here on the earth
[1:44:55] when they gave them the bread
[1:44:58] when he took the bread and then break it
[1:45:35] he left
[1:46:09] he left
[1:46:54] their eyes could not see that it was him
[1:47:34] but at the same time he could go through
[1:47:36] walls
[1:47:37] behold
[1:47:40] so you see my flesh see my blood see my
[1:47:43] bones
[1:47:45] a spirit cannot do these things
[1:47:48] when he said that is
[1:47:51] the other question that he had
[1:47:54] do you have something to eat
[1:47:59] and this before
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] you speak to his disciples
[1:48:06] the first question
[1:48:09] you've got something to eat
[1:48:14] the scripture says that they gave him
[1:48:16] some fish
[1:48:18] grilled fish it wasn't just
[1:48:20] raw fish it was grilled
[1:48:29] and then put a little lemon on top of
[1:48:31] the fish
[1:48:32] it was cooked that's what the Bible says
[1:48:38] so that he could eat
[1:48:44] when the first fruits in the dead arose
[1:48:47] they also ate
[1:48:50] I can imagine
[1:48:54] that raises up in the resurrection he's
[1:48:57] going to say give me a taco
[1:48:59] some cactus
[1:49:04] spicy chili right
[1:49:11] and El Salvadoran will also get up too
[1:49:14] maybe they'll also raise up two years
[1:49:21] with some very bitter coffees some
[1:49:23] strong coffee
[1:49:25] because they're hungry it's a body
[1:49:42] and eat
[1:49:52] the pride is blessed
[1:49:55] everyone else
[1:50:00] is
[1:50:03] your Resurrection
[1:50:23] that's biblical
[1:50:29] you happy Brothers
[1:50:33] the prophet tells us that there's six
[1:50:35] raptures
[1:50:37] three raptures in the Old Testament
[1:50:40] three raptures in the New Testament
[1:50:42] what are those raptures
[1:50:47] then Elijah
[1:50:51] then it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:54] but those that were in Paradise
[1:50:59] the prophet says that the Lord Jesus
[1:51:01] Christ was the Keystone
[1:51:03] that's right in the middle
[1:51:06] between the old and the New Testament
[1:51:08] amen Brothers
[1:51:14] the first Rapture of the New Testament
[1:51:16] and also
[1:51:18] and then the Rapture that's going and
[1:51:22] we're waiting and what is the other
[1:51:25] Resurrection
[1:52:46] the first
[1:52:52] don't doubt it
[1:52:56] don't doubt
[1:52:58] usted young brother and sister
[1:53:03] the first resurrection
[1:53:06] that's why the largest crisis
[1:53:10] that all will raise up
[1:53:13] amen amen Brothers
[1:53:16] in the end everyone will raise up
[1:53:21] but the last shall be the resurrection
[1:53:23] of condemnation
[1:53:27] we just read in Matthew
[1:53:30] he cried with a loud voice
[1:53:33] and the resurrection
[1:53:37] and we're ready we're waiting for that
[1:53:39] shout
[1:53:41] the resurrection
[1:53:45] so if the dead in Christ can rise up
[1:53:47] first
[1:53:50] who does it who does those three things
[1:53:53] the Lord Jesus
[1:53:59] now my question to you is how will the
[1:54:01] tombs open up
[1:54:02] will there be tombs open all over
[1:54:06] dirt all scattered around
[1:54:10] have you ever thought about that
[1:54:15] imagine driving around and just see the
[1:54:18] tombs all dug up
[1:54:20] you'll say oh how tremendous
[1:54:23] the prophet says
[1:54:27] the message God hiding himself in
[1:54:29] Simplicity
[1:54:31] then revealing himself in the same
[1:54:34] and when they say the Grays will open
[1:54:37] how are the graves
[1:54:41] I don't have time
[1:54:43] to explain it
[1:54:46] I'm going to jump over to save some time
[1:54:48] the prophet says
[1:54:51] God just speaks
[1:54:54] and the Rapture will come noise
[1:55:00] it ain't going out there the Angels come
[1:55:02] down with shovels
[1:55:05] up the graves to get the old dead
[1:55:07] carcasses here
[1:55:08] what is it
[1:55:11] was born in sin to begin with
[1:55:14] that body
[1:55:16] it's a body
[1:55:19] we've got another body ready
[1:55:23] glorified body of perfect
[1:55:25] that's waiting foreign
[1:56:05] a secret
[1:56:10] it's a secret
[1:56:13] no one else will know about it
[1:56:18] I want to say something but I'm holding
[1:56:21] back no I said a new group chat it won't
[1:56:23] be in a group chat
[1:56:26] I said Secreto
[1:56:31] I see
[1:56:34] because he said he'd come as a thief in
[1:56:37] the night
[1:56:41] that's why it's good to wake up early in
[1:56:44] the morning because you never know
[1:56:47] when you'll be here
[1:56:49] how the dead will arrive it's a secret
[1:56:53] let me tell you one thing
[1:56:56] that all the secrets have been revealed
[1:57:01] by the seventh messenger
[1:57:03] they've been declared
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:32] that'll give us Rapture in faith
[1:57:35] with the change with the body change
[1:57:38] Gomorrah
[1:58:36] and three men came
[1:58:41] an Earthly body
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:15] why did your wife Sarah laugh
[2:00:16] the prophet says foreign
[2:01:00] is the discernment
[2:01:03] is
[2:01:09] to receive that promise
[2:01:12] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:17] there's a question that was asked to the
[2:01:19] prophet
[2:01:23] will the bride be gathered in one place
[2:01:25] in the Rapture
[2:01:26] will it be in the East the prophet said
[2:01:30] yeah you don't have to be there
[2:01:36] the bride will be gathered in one place
[2:01:38] that's true
[2:01:41] but not until the resurrection
[2:01:45] foreign
[2:03:11] all of them have to be in a place like
[2:03:14] this
[2:03:17] maybe we don't understand everything but
[2:03:20] I believe it with all of my heart
[2:03:27] Now quickly if we go to First
[2:03:29] Corinthians

[2:06:00] verses
[2:06:03] but as is it as it is written
[2:06:06] I have not seen
[2:06:09] nor ear hurt
[2:06:13] s things that are there that we can't
[2:06:15] even imagine
