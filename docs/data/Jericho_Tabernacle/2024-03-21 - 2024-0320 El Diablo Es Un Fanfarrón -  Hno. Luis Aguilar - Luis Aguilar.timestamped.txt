[27:24] 7 it says by the word of Truth by the
[27:27] power of God by the armor of
[27:29] righteousness on the right hand and on
[27:31] the
[27:31] [Music]
[27:41] left by Honor and dishonor by evil
[27:44] report and good report as deceivers and
[27:47] yet
[27:57] true as unknown and yet wellknown as
[28:00] dying and behold we live as chastened
[28:04] and not
[28:14] killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[28:18] as poor yet making many rich as having
[28:20] nothing and yet possessing all things
[28:25] amen may God bless the reading of his
[28:27] word you may be seated
[28:29] [Music]
[28:31] amen we thank our
[28:33] musicians and our
[28:36] pastor and to each and every one of you
[28:38] as well
[28:45] amen now tonight we have a thought that
[28:47] we would like to
[28:49] express and we want to give the
[28:54] title The Devil is a bluff amen
[28:58] how many knew
[29:01] that that the devil is a
[29:06] bluff let's all say it together so we
[29:09] can tell the
[29:10] devil that he is a
[29:13] bluff we'll say it in
[29:16] English first in Spanish then in
[29:22] English
[29:24] fonon amen the devil the devil is a is a
[29:29] bluff Bluff amen amen
[29:33] Brothers how many understand
[29:36] that that's very easy to
[29:41] understand now the prophet preaches a
[29:43] message to
[29:45] us which he calls it possessing all
[29:52] things the prophet brought us a very a
[29:55] message that's highly
[29:57] important
[30:00] and sometimes we can see that God's
[30:03] people are bound by the very
[30:08] devil and you believe that the devil
[30:11] carries the
[30:13] power and we in one point in our
[30:17] lives we believe him to be
[30:20] Almighty I'll say it
[30:23] again in a point in our
[30:26] lives we have believed him to be the
[30:30] almighty because everything goes bad for
[30:36] us we think or we feel that the devil is
[30:39] closer to us than
[30:41] God that he's the only one that hears us
[30:46] out and God barely could hear
[30:49] us but
[30:53] tonight we would like to remove the mask
[30:55] off
[30:56] the
[30:59] we want to remove all power that he
[31:02] has because the only Power that he
[31:06] has is the power that the church gives
[31:09] to the devil I'll say it
[31:12] again the prophet tells
[31:15] me and I don't know how is it that you
[31:18] read your
[31:20] message how you read or how you
[31:22] understand the
[31:24] message but the prophet tells me
[31:28] that the
[31:30] church gives its power to the
[31:34] devil so who is the church
[31:37] then it's them that are called
[31:40] out it's not actually just a
[31:43] building is not a crowd of many
[31:46] people because the called
[31:49] out is
[31:52] few how many
[31:56] understand because when the people
[31:57] people left
[32:00] Egypt the multitude left
[32:03] Egypt many people left
[32:06] Egypt but
[32:09] Egypt did not come out of their
[32:13] hearts it was very few
[32:16] people that Egypt left their
[32:21] hearts even denomination itself was in
[32:24] their
[32:26] hearts the wrong does were were inside
[32:30] them they were Bound for so
[32:34] long that they were accustomed to being
[32:38] bound they were not accustomed to being
[32:42] free so when they saw the wonders of
[32:45] God they they could not accept
[32:50] it they couldn't take it in they would
[32:52] turn it down or reject
[32:55] it and tonight
[32:58] I want to
[33:00] say that the devil is a
[33:07] bluff and I don't know what you're
[33:09] struggling with in your
[33:11] life many of you are in different
[33:16] levels many are maybe struggling with
[33:19] their own
[33:21] youth they may be struggling in their
[33:24] own
[33:25] marriage maybe you're struggling with
[33:27] your children
[33:28] with your own
[33:29] health or with your
[33:31] thoughts but the
[33:33] Devil is a
[33:37] bluff the only Power the devil
[33:41] carries is the power that we give to him
[33:45] amen
[33:48] brothers and the prophet says I don't
[33:50] have the quotes on the
[33:52] screen and the message possess
[33:54] possessing all
[33:56] things he says
[34:00] Abraham he says was aired to All by the
[34:07] promise so he could lay claim to
[34:10] everything that was in the
[34:12] land in the land
[34:15] itself
[34:17] Abraham had been given the
[34:26] promise now we understand that Abraham
[34:28] was the poorest man in all the
[34:31] country what a
[34:35] thing God gave the promise to
[34:40] Abraham that thy seed will possess the
[34:42] enemy's
[34:43] Gates but we see that
[34:47] Abraham perhaps was the poorest
[34:51] man that was in the
[34:54] desert but he lived in peace with God
[34:58] and
[34:59] lot
[35:01] Rich lived in the
[35:04] city and become the governor of the
[35:10] city he said in the gate he was a judge
[35:13] and judged the
[35:17] city he had and had all the riches and
[35:22] things but Abraham was in the
[35:26] desert and perhaps
[35:31] the poorest man in the
[35:33] land and
[35:35] yet a
[35:38] claim to possess
[35:43] all Phoenix Arizon you might not be the
[35:46] wealthiest people here in Phoenix
[35:48] Arizona but you have the
[35:50] claim to
[35:53] possess what belongs to
[35:56] you maybe we don't have that much
[36:00] riches but we have the right the claim
[36:03] to
[36:04] possess what belongs to
[36:07] you so
[36:09] tonight we might not be
[36:12] rich in the uh worldly
[36:16] Goods but yet we possess all
[36:20] things the church
[36:23] itself possesses all things yet poor
[36:28] get
[36:30] rich and possesses all
[36:35] things and tonight I want your faith to
[36:38] begin to be
[36:41] stimulated I want that faith that is in
[36:43] you to begin to
[36:46] stimulate because maybe you have a child
[36:49] a son or
[36:51] daughter that is veering off the things
[36:54] of
[36:56] God or maybe your own marriage is not in
[36:59] the things of
[37:01] God maybe your home is falling
[37:03] apart but
[37:07] tonight we want to possess what belongs
[37:09] to me the
[37:12] Devil is a
[37:17] bluff uh brother vam says that Abraham's
[37:21] cattle maybe he was
[37:24] hungry maybe it wasn't the most uh the
[37:28] biggest
[37:29] cows but yet he had cows maybe they were
[37:33] very thin but yet he had
[37:36] cows but on the other hand
[37:39] lot he had the best piece of
[37:43] land maybe Abraham was had a shortage of
[37:47] water and the days were very hot for
[37:51] him and brother Adam says that as
[37:55] well the Shepherds of Abraham
[37:58] had
[38:02] Strife it seemed that all things were
[38:04] going against
[38:06] Abraham and yet with all
[38:09] that he
[38:11] still owned all the
[38:14] land are you hearing
[38:17] me he was the poorest
[38:19] one his cows were the thinnest ones but
[38:24] he
[38:24] still
[38:26] owned all the
[38:32] land now the prophet says in the first
[38:37] seal that there was a
[38:39] rider there was a white
[38:44] horse so when uh with the prophet once
[38:47] the revelation of the seven SE
[38:51] came the people thought that that white
[38:53] horse and that
[38:54] Rider they thought it was the Holy
[38:56] Spirit
[38:59] but when the Revelation
[39:01] comes and the Holy Spirit
[39:05] reveals that it was not the Holy
[39:08] Ghost it was the
[39:11] Antichrist because the
[39:14] Antichrist is very similar or looks like
[39:18] Christ the things of the
[39:22] devil they look very alike to the things
[39:25] of God they hear good
[39:28] they sound good but they're not from
[39:35] God when we see that that uh Rider had a
[39:39] bow and when the Revelation
[39:42] came the prophet says that that
[39:46] riter he had a
[39:48] bow but he had no
[39:51] arrows and he says that
[39:54] Antichrist was a bluff
[39:58] he had a
[40:01] bow just merely to scare off the
[40:04] children of
[40:05] God the
[40:07] Devil is a
[40:09] bluff he has a
[40:12] bow like today he might have a
[40:16] shotgun but he he doesn't have any
[40:18] bullets at
[40:19] all because we possess all
[40:26] things you know that yeah we even
[40:31] us not only do we possess our
[40:34] families our
[40:37] healing but the prophet also tells
[40:42] me that we also possess
[40:45] death how many uh knew
[40:48] that I'll read it for you in the very
[40:51] same Mage the prophet
[40:54] says he says did you notice uh that Paul
[40:58] said here in the
[41:01] Corinthians he said even of
[41:05] death is subject to us now think of
[41:11] that we have power over death yes
[41:16] sir that encourages
[41:22] us he says uh I forgot about that
[41:25] explosion of the gun now
[41:29] see why didn't Satan kill me why because
[41:32] he
[41:35] couldn't that's why God wasn't
[41:40] ready he could come as much as he want
[41:45] to but he can't take
[41:47] you are you
[41:51] listening the devil cannot take
[41:53] you until God gives him
[41:58] until your purpose in this life is
[42:02] fulfilled all the
[42:04] apostles the Apostle Peter the rest of
[42:07] the
[42:09] Apostles they had a purpose that they
[42:11] had to meet on
[42:14] Earth and everyone wanted to kill the
[42:17] apostles but they couldn't kill
[42:20] them until their purpose was
[42:25] met the prophet says he cannot take
[42:29] you though he wants to but he can't take
[42:33] you says I paid my debt to
[42:38] that a long time ago when I believed on
[42:41] Jesus
[42:42] Christ who's alive forever
[42:45] more he says now
[42:50] death listens to what we say
[42:56] Amen
[42:59] death
[43:01] listens to what we say
[43:06] Amen how many times have we prayed for
[43:09] someone that is
[43:11] sick and we say Lord give them a little
[43:14] bit more of
[43:16] time maybe it's just another more
[43:19] year but
[43:21] death
[43:23] listens to what we
[43:26] say
[43:32] now the prophet says that's what Paul
[43:33] said here in
[43:37] Corinthians death even we possess
[43:45] it why when they was fixing to cut his
[43:49] head off he said oh death where is your
[43:51] sting where is
[43:56] your
[43:59] show me where you can scare
[44:05] me D said I'll squeeze you down and put
[44:08] you down in the grave and you'll rot and
[44:11] caner he said but all thanks be to
[44:17] God who gives us the victory through our
[44:19] Lord Jesus
[44:21] Christ I possess it
[44:23] all because death hell
[44:27] and
[44:30] Grave because he conquered it all for
[44:33] us we are possessors of
[44:39] everything we possess all
[44:42] things and many people are afraid of
[44:46] death I believe that's a very tremendous
[44:50] thing that people are afraid of
[44:55] death but maybe they just don't know
[44:57] know the
[44:59] message but the message clarifies so
[45:02] many things for us it reveals to
[45:07] us and it tells us what happens when a
[45:11] Christian even a person that does not
[45:13] believe in
[45:17] God what happens to them after
[45:21] death and the prophet tells
[45:24] us that death
[45:28] is like a
[45:31] buggy and
[45:34] death is tied to a
[45:38] buggy and the only thing that death can
[45:43] do is take you to the presence of your
[45:46] maker
[45:48] death is a
[45:51] bluff death no longer has a
[45:55] St
[45:57] and now death looks like a big
[46:02] ghost and many maybe many of you at one
[46:05] point in your
[46:07] life you've confronted
[46:10] death maybe you have
[46:12] cancer or or a crash or I I don't
[46:17] know but maybe uh many few of
[46:21] you have had to face what death
[46:25] is
[46:27] and uh brother Adam says that death in
[46:29] itself carries a
[46:32] fear and as as death is approaching
[46:38] you but now the prophet says death no
[46:40] longer has a
[46:42] sting because when the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:48] came the devil just thought that the
[46:50] Lord Jesus Christ was merely just
[46:52] another
[46:53] prophet he thought he was just merely
[46:55] another man
[46:58] so when death came to
[47:00] Abraham death caught
[47:02] Abraham and locked him
[47:05] up when death came to job it caught him
[47:09] and locked him
[47:11] up so death itself was an
[47:16] overcomer but once it came down to the
[47:18] Lord Jesus
[47:19] Christ even John the
[47:22] Baptist sent
[47:24] disciples when he was in jail
[47:27] and he said go ask
[47:30] him that this one that we're looking
[47:34] for and like the devil said if thou be
[47:36] the Son of
[47:38] God then turn these stones into bread he
[47:42] wanted to
[47:44] tempted he wanted to see that creative
[47:47] power from
[47:48] God he said if thou be the Son of
[47:52] God cast yourself from these
[47:55] Heights because even the devil quoted
[47:58] the
[48:00] Bible because the Bible tells
[48:04] us he says he will not let your foot
[48:07] Dash against the
[48:09] stone the devil wanted to see Firs
[48:12] hand if this was in fact the Son of
[48:18] God even the Lord Jesus Christ could not
[48:21] be
[48:22] tempted and when death
[48:24] Came Death approached him
[48:31] it's something normal for a human being
[48:33] to have to be a little
[48:35] scared because even the Lord Jesus
[48:37] Christ
[48:40] said Lord he said Lord let this cup pass
[48:43] over
[48:44] me but he said but let thy will be
[48:47] done not my
[48:50] will but thy will be
[48:54] done he began to sweat was
[48:59] nervous because he knew that he had to
[49:02] face death
[49:05] itself death carried a
[49:08] sting but when he was at calvary's
[49:11] Cross and then death
[49:13] came and stung
[49:16] him death then
[49:20] said this is not a normal human
[49:23] being this is not a normal
[49:25] prophet this is not just a
[49:29] man and when the Lord saw death he said
[49:33] death I will be your
[49:37] death what amazing words those
[49:40] were because when Abraham
[49:44] Came Death just said this is just
[49:46] another
[49:47] prophet and put him into Paradise then
[49:50] job came he killed him he put him in
[49:54] Paradise Daniel came Ezekiel
[49:58] came they were tremendous
[50:01] prophets but when the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:04] came he was the only
[50:07] one that can look death face to face and
[50:10] he said
[50:11] death I will be your death you no longer
[50:15] have power you are a
[50:18] bluff so
[50:20] death no longer has it
[50:23] power so what the Lord Jesus Christ did
[50:27] he took
[50:28] death he grabbed
[50:30] him from the
[50:33] sack and he put them in he took them and
[50:36] put in the buggy just like the
[50:40] horse just like when you uh you connect
[50:42] the horse to the to the
[50:44] buggy then you get on the
[50:47] buggy that horse will take you to your
[50:51] destination that horse is
[50:54] death death cannot do anything
[50:57] for a child of
[50:59] God that accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:02] in his
[51:04] day you just get on the
[51:07] buggy you sit down
[51:10] there and death
[51:12] only will take you to your
[51:19] maker when you're face to face with your
[51:23] maker what are you going to then say to
[51:25] God what are you going to say to God
[51:29] then each one of you ask
[51:32] yourselves Lord I stood for your
[51:34] word I stood next to your
[51:37] pastor serving your church
[51:39] Lord what are you going to
[51:43] say when death takes you to your
[51:47] maker that's an amazing
[51:49] question but
[51:51] death a Son of
[51:53] God a child of God should not fear death
[51:58] because it no longer carries a
[52:00] St that's why Paul knew he said
[52:07] death where is your
[52:09] sting
[52:11] grave where is your Victory
[52:16] amen the prophet tells
[52:21] us he said Abraham had a claim to all
[52:24] things and the promise is
[52:32] yours yet he had to fight to possess
[52:36] it he had everything
[52:39] Brothers but he had to fight his your
[52:42] daughter your son your marriage your
[52:47] life your
[52:49] home they belong to
[52:52] you God gave them to
[52:55] you you must fight for them
[53:00] amen he was heir of all
[53:04] things air of all spiritual
[53:06] blessing every physical
[53:10] blessing every blessing the bible
[53:15] promises yeah you have to fight every
[53:18] inch of
[53:21] it that's the way God's got it set
[53:24] up it's always been that
[53:28] way you have to fight to
[53:32] possess you have to fight to possess
[53:38] it now you say brother brandom I need
[53:43] healing but if you ever get to if you
[53:46] ever get
[53:49] it you ain't going to get it
[53:53] easy if you ever get your healing
[53:57] it's not easy to get your
[54:01] healing what the prophet said there is
[54:03] very
[54:06] tremendous he says I assure you of
[54:11] that you're going to have to take it
[54:14] away from
[54:16] Satan he says Satan captures your
[54:20] health he says you've got a
[54:24] right to go to Satan
[54:28] say give it back hand it
[54:32] over I come in the name of the
[54:35] Lord the possessor of heavens and
[54:39] earth and I am his
[54:41] Heir give it
[54:44] back you took my
[54:49] child you got her mixed up with the
[54:52] wrong
[54:53] boy you took my boy
[55:00] and mixed up with the wrong
[55:03] girl I claim
[55:06] them I claim my
[55:09] children I claim my
[55:11] brother I claim my
[55:14] sister yes
[55:17] Satan you took them from God's
[55:22] House Co them out of
[55:25] there
[55:27] but I'm coming after
[55:29] them I claim
[55:33] them well I'm heir of all
[55:38] things they're given unto
[55:41] me I am an an
[55:45] heir and I can claim all the things that
[55:48] God has promised me how then can I get
[55:51] it is it possibly by something that you
[55:54] can do of course not
[55:58] because it's an unmerited
[56:00] gift that God has given us and it's ours
[56:05] and they belong to us
[56:07] Satan cannot hold it
[56:14] back if you go against the authority
[56:16] that's in the
[56:18] scriptures and with faith to say it's
[56:22] mine Let It
[56:25] Go
[56:26] the prophet says I like that he said
[56:30] Satan Let Her
[56:32] Go you took her away from
[56:35] me give her back now because
[56:40] now I'm giving you a
[56:43] warning I have the
[56:46] warning that's written here in the word
[56:50] the prophet
[56:52] says that lot got himself in a problem
[56:57] and maybe he was in
[57:00] Chains and when the news came to
[57:04] Abraham the prophet
[57:06] says that even
[57:11] lot was a possession that belonged to
[57:13] Abraham
[57:16] lot belonged to
[57:19] Abraham lot found himself in a
[57:24] problem the prophet says that he might
[57:26] had H shackles around his
[57:29] neck just like as the picture shows
[57:32] slaves walking through the
[57:34] desert his own daughters were in
[57:37] Chains maybe his own wife was in
[57:40] Chains but
[57:42] Abraham had
[57:44] possession of
[57:47] lot not only of the physical
[57:50] land but also of his Kinsmen his
[57:53] relatives Abraham and Abraham
[57:57] was not a
[58:00] soldier he wasn't trained to carry a
[58:09] weapon he says look the only thing he
[58:11] had was a little bunch of
[58:14] servants probably a
[58:19] dozen and there was probably couple of
[58:21] thousand men
[58:24] armed and his man man wasn't
[58:27] soldiers they were
[58:29] servants
[58:31] Cattlemen
[58:33] sheepmen
[58:35] herders probably
[58:39] old rusty
[58:42] knives that they had picked up
[58:45] somewhere I just want you to imagine the
[58:51] scene L was taken captive by the king's
[58:54] a big army abah so
[58:59] Abraham he only had a dozen of these uh
[59:04] Shepherds and these
[59:06] Shepherds they were not
[59:09] soldiers they were not trained for
[59:12] battle and they had no
[59:14] Shields they had no swords that were
[59:20] glistening he said they had old rusty
[59:24] knives Maybe they were just there lying
[59:26] on the
[59:28] grass they were just laying out
[59:32] there it says maybe the rains were
[59:34] falling on
[59:37] them but it says Abraham wasn't looking
[59:40] at the rusty
[59:43] knife or the no Shield at
[59:47] all he was laying his
[59:50] faith upon God's
[59:52] word he didn't
[59:55] see
[59:56] if his servants were trained or
[59:58] not God told
[1:00:01] him I have given you all
[1:00:03] things so then he took his
[1:00:06] cattl with their Rusty
[1:00:10] knives and he went to go get what he
[1:00:13] owned he released
[1:00:16] lot he released his daughter his wife
[1:00:20] how did he do it I don't
[1:00:24] know but he took it old rusty
[1:00:27] knife and he killed all those
[1:00:30] kings slaughtered all the
[1:00:33] soldiers because when God promises you
[1:00:37] something you have to go take it the
[1:00:40] Devil is a
[1:00:48] bluff how are you going to fight against
[1:00:51] that that's not up to
[1:00:54] me what's up to me
[1:00:57] and what's up to
[1:00:59] you is for you to place your faith in
[1:01:02] God in what God said it's
[1:01:06] mine I'm going after what belongs to me
[1:01:12] amen he says now when people that sick
[1:01:15] can see
[1:01:19] that the sickness is right about over
[1:01:22] with right
[1:01:23] then I'm closing now
[1:01:26] but I'm going to turn the
[1:01:30] corner how many have your seat belts
[1:01:33] on the devil's a
[1:01:35] bluff he has no
[1:01:39] power we just merely have to believe
[1:01:41] what God has already
[1:01:42] said we have to motivate the faith
[1:01:45] that's inside
[1:01:48] us well what would be your
[1:01:51] reaction if I tell
[1:01:54] you that the proph Propet tells
[1:01:57] me in the message
[1:02:00] Moses preached in in uh 1950 the prophet
[1:02:09] says he says you can't Bluff
[1:02:16] Satan it's it's a sad thing I don't have
[1:02:18] the quotes on the screen but the Devil
[1:02:21] is a
[1:02:23] bluff but now the prophet tells me that
[1:02:28] I cannot Bluff
[1:02:31] Satan the prophet says he says
[1:02:36] Satan he won't be bluffed oh
[1:02:41] man he says you've got to
[1:02:46] know where you're standing oh my
[1:02:50] goodness my
[1:02:54] God Amen man I want I want to preach in
[1:02:57] English
[1:02:58] now amen the Church of the Living
[1:03:03] God cannot Bluff
[1:03:08] Satan we can't Bluff
[1:03:10] Satan even though he's a
[1:03:13] bluff but we can't Bluff
[1:03:16] him because he knows who he is he knows
[1:03:20] who you
[1:03:21] are he knows the
[1:03:23] message he knows the Bible
[1:03:30] sometimes sometimes the children of
[1:03:32] God they don't know their message but
[1:03:36] the
[1:03:37] devil does know his
[1:03:39] message he knows his message and it's
[1:03:42] very
[1:03:43] sad sometimes you talk with
[1:03:46] people and they don't know the message
[1:03:48] of the
[1:03:50] hour I'll say it
[1:03:52] again sometimes I talk with people
[1:03:56] and they don't know the
[1:03:58] message but
[1:04:00] Satan does know the
[1:04:03] message that's why the prophet tells
[1:04:06] me the devil's a
[1:04:09] bluff death is a
[1:04:11] bluff but
[1:04:14] I I can't Bluff the
[1:04:17] devil he knows who I
[1:04:20] am he knows the life that I
[1:04:23] have he knows if I'm a hypocrite
[1:04:27] he knows if I'm here or
[1:04:28] there I can pray and say
[1:04:32] Satan get away from my
[1:04:35] family but the devil knows if I'm a
[1:04:39] hypocrite he knows if I'm a Child of God
[1:04:43] or if I'm a hypocrite and the prophet
[1:04:47] says I can't Bluff
[1:04:52] Satan he says the devil will not let
[1:04:54] himself
[1:04:56] be
[1:04:57] bluffed he won't let himself he's going
[1:04:59] to fight for what's
[1:05:02] his he will
[1:05:04] fight for you not to get your healing he
[1:05:07] will
[1:05:09] fight for your daughter not to come back
[1:05:12] he will
[1:05:14] fight for your home not to be
[1:05:16] restored he won't let
[1:05:19] himself be
[1:05:21] bluffed though he is a
[1:05:23] bluff but he won't let him
[1:05:26] himself we must fight for every
[1:05:31] inch for every inch that is
[1:05:33] ours the prophet tells
[1:05:36] me I don't know what the prophet is
[1:05:38] telling you William Bram but the prophet
[1:05:40] William Bram tells
[1:05:43] me he says I must
[1:05:45] know where I'm
[1:05:48] standing I must know where I'm
[1:05:54] standing
[1:05:56] so brother sister where are you
[1:05:58] saying on Jero tacle or on God's
[1:06:02] word because when
[1:06:05] you you come close to the
[1:06:07] devil and you say devil this is
[1:06:11] my I'm an associate pastor of
[1:06:14] Jericho the devil will not take
[1:06:17] that but when I say to him I am a child
[1:06:21] of
[1:06:22] God I stand on his
[1:06:24] word don't have any
[1:06:27] power but the power of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:29] Christ he gives it to
[1:06:31] me the
[1:06:33] devil he knows his message he knows the
[1:06:38] Bible you have to know where you're
[1:06:42] standing the prophet says in the message
[1:06:45] demonology he says and
[1:06:48] therefore it must
[1:06:51] take the very deepest of sincerity
[1:06:56] we must be
[1:06:58] sincere not only with the brothers at
[1:07:02] church you have to be sincere with
[1:07:05] yourself know know who I
[1:07:08] am am I truly a
[1:07:10] Christian am I truly a child of
[1:07:13] God we must be
[1:07:16] sincere when the
[1:07:19] disciples they saw how Paul would
[1:07:22] pray they saw how the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] would pray
[1:07:27] and the the disciples wanted to
[1:07:30] mimic as Paul and Jesus
[1:07:33] prayed and Satan said the devil
[1:07:36] said he says I know
[1:07:38] Jesus I know Paul but who are
[1:07:43] you the
[1:07:44] devil will not let himself be
[1:07:49] bluffed though he has no
[1:07:52] power but he has all rights
[1:07:55] to
[1:07:57] take what we
[1:08:00] neglect when we
[1:08:02] pray we must be
[1:08:06] sincere not I'm just copying
[1:08:08] the copying the prophet
[1:08:11] prayer you can quote the prophet pray
[1:08:14] but if you're not
[1:08:16] sincere the devil's goingon to
[1:08:18] say I know who willing BR is who are but
[1:08:21] who are
[1:08:24] you
[1:08:27] he's not a he can't be
[1:08:30] bluffed that's what the prophet saying
[1:08:32] in the message
[1:08:33] demonology in the
[1:08:37] 1953 he says it isn't a
[1:08:40] bluff you can't
[1:08:43] Bluff the devil at
[1:08:45] all he won't
[1:08:47] Bluff he won't do
[1:08:54] it but whenever you really can produce
[1:08:57] the blood of Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ
[1:09:01] Satan can't stand before
[1:09:04] that of what my
[1:09:08] religion or my title my
[1:09:13] church when I apply the blood of Jesus
[1:09:17] Christ Satan can't stand before that
[1:09:20] it's either one or the other the
[1:09:22] blood or other things
[1:09:26] amen I'm closing there was once a
[1:09:31] sister that attended another
[1:09:35] church I'm I'm quoting from The
[1:09:37] Prophet's
[1:09:39] message and this sister had a very
[1:09:41] serious
[1:09:44] issue she had something that she could
