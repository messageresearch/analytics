[24:43] our good
[24:44] [Music]
[24:46] evening may the Lord bless each and
[24:48] every one of
[24:50] you if you would mind bowing your heads
[24:53] we're going to go into
[24:56] prayer heavenly father in this
[25:01] evening through your blood of the Lord
[25:03] Jesus
[25:04] Christ we approach your
[25:08] throne knowing what's inside of our own
[25:12] Hearts is reflecting what's in God's
[25:19] Throne so in that manner and this
[25:22] evening we ask that you help
[25:26] us so we may be able to reflect more of
[25:29] what's in that
[25:32] Throne we ask that as your word is
[25:37] spoken that a peaceful Spirit may come
[25:40] upon
[25:43] us so that your people may be able to
[25:45] accept your word with a warm
[25:49] heart and we ask all of
[25:52] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[25:54] Christ amen
[25:56] amen
[26:00] and just as you're standing we're going
[26:01] to be reading two
[26:04] scriptures first one's going to be
[26:06] Genesis
[26:11] [Music]
[26:17] 49:10 and the word reads like
[26:26] this
[26:31] the scepter shall not depart from Judah
[26:33] nor the lawgiver from between his feet
[26:36] until Shiloh come and unto him shall the
[26:39] Gathering of the people
[26:43] [Music]
[26:45] be and now I want you to notice that it
[26:47] says that unto him shall the Gathering
[26:49] of the people
[26:51] be and when it speaks about Shiloh here
[26:53] it's talking about a
[26:55] person and now in Joshua
[26:58] [Music]
[27:14] 181 and the whole Congregation of the
[27:16] children of Israel assembled together at
[27:19] Shiloh and set up the Tabernacle of the
[27:21] congregation there and the land was
[27:23] subdued before
[27:26] them
[27:29] and now in this verse it talks about
[27:30] Shiloh but as a
[27:32] [Music]
[27:34] place you may be seated and we also want
[27:36] to thank the
[27:39] [Music]
[27:45] musicians now once again in the Book of
[27:47] Genesis when it talks about
[27:51] Shiloh it's saying that it's referring
[27:53] the Shiloh as a
[27:56] person
[27:58] not just the person but the one that has
[27:59] a
[28:01] scepter so in all of this it's a
[28:06] king but then in Joshua
[28:09] 181 it speaks about Shiloh as a
[28:15] place and it talks about a place that
[28:17] where the the Tabernacle is
[28:22] assembled so the revelation of both of
[28:24] those
[28:25] scriptures first of all
[28:30] there are some scriptures in the
[28:32] Bible or things in the
[28:34] message that may seem like it's
[28:36] contradicting one
[28:40] another but the Bible says in the New
[28:45] Testament that God has given us the
[28:47] ministry and the
[28:48] spirit of
[28:52] reconciliation so then there is a
[28:54] Reconciliation
[28:56] happening not only in within
[28:59] people but then also within the
[29:02] scriptures so then now speaking about
[29:06] Shiloh Shiloh as a person is a
[29:10] king but when it refers it to a
[29:14] place it's speaking about a
[29:17] tabernacle and this is the
[29:21] Revelation Shiloh is King and
[29:26] priest talking about another king and a
[29:28] priest mc mzc mc and
[29:35] mzc is a spirit a
[29:39] person that came and dwelt in a
[29:43] tabernacle and that Tabernacle
[29:45] Tabernacle was called
[29:48] Jesus but that Tabernacle isn't a place
[29:51] it's a
[29:54] person so then the scriptures seem to be
[29:58] uh contradicting one
[30:00] another talking about Shiloh as a person
[30:04] and as a
[30:06] place but it's referring to as that
[30:09] there will be a
[30:10] place that it will be one
[30:13] person where the spirit of God will
[30:15] dwell
[30:16] in that's why we are human
[30:20] beings but we are also called the temple
[30:23] of
[30:24] God so then Shiloh
[30:28] is both a king and a
[30:31] priest just as mzc
[30:34] was was both King and
[30:37] priest and just as we touched on
[30:42] Friday we were also called to be Kings
[30:44] and
[30:46] Priests and then one of those examples
[30:48] that we showed in the Bible is is
[30:53] Esther so then we're going to go into
[30:55] the Book of Esther uh chapter 2:
[31:05] 7 and because of time I did not include
[31:08] all of the quotes that I really wanted
[31:09] to
[31:11] share but one time brother brandham
[31:13] said that his own
[31:16] mother had a dream about
[31:20] him showing how there was three
[31:23] steps that a person had to take
[31:27] to be able to reach the Gates of
[31:30] Heaven and brother bam says that those
[31:32] are
[31:33] justification
[31:36] sanctification and the baptism of the
[31:37] Holy
[31:40] Ghost Esther also went through those
[31:42] three
[31:44] steps and now in Esther
[31:56] 27
[32:00] and he brought up hadassa that is Esther
[32:02] his uncle's daughter for she had neither
[32:04] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[32:07] and beautiful whom morai when her father
[32:09] and mother were dead took for his own
[32:26] daughter
[32:30] so it came to pass that when the king's
[32:31] commandment and his decree Was Heard and
[32:34] when many maidens were gathered together
[32:36] unto shushan the place to the custody of
[32:39] hegi that Esther was brought also unto
[32:42] the King's house to the custody of hegi
[32:44] Keeper of the
[32:48] woman so Esther being taken onto the
[32:50] king's
[32:51] Palace is her
[32:55] justification just as we are called
[32:57] called to come to the kingdom of
[33:00] God our first step would be
[33:04] justification and so then now she's
[33:06] inside of
[33:08] that and now her next step would be to
[33:11] go into
[33:12] sanctification and then we go into verse
[33:25] n
[33:32] and the Maiden pleased them and she
[33:34] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[33:36] gave her uh her things for purification
[33:40] with such things oh go ahead go ahead
[33:42] with such things uh as belong to her and
[33:45] seven maidens which were meat uh to be
[33:48] given her out of the King's house and he
[33:51] preferred her and her maidens unto the
[33:52] best place of the House of
[33:55] women
[34:00] and then if you notice here in Esther
[34:03] 29 and says that here at this
[34:08] unic he assigned seven women to
[34:14] Esther and now the the parallel to uh
[34:18] sanctification
[34:19] here to the
[34:21] Tabernacle is the holy
[34:24] place so then Esther and her agage of
[34:28] sanctification as the Bible says in the
[34:30] book in in
[34:33] English uh there were certain things
[34:35] that were given unto her and seven
[34:38] maidens for her
[34:42] purification so in other words in her
[34:45] sanctification and so then in the
[34:48] Tabernacle in the Holy
[34:50] place in that uh room of
[34:55] Holiness there is a uh furniture
[35:00] furniture that's called that's the uh um
[35:04] candle
[35:06] Candlestick and it has seven
[35:11] candles seven lights representing the
[35:14] seven Church
[35:16] agents and so then Esther going through
[35:19] sanctification with seven women that
[35:21] helped
[35:24] her showing that the bride goes through
[35:27] those seven uh Church
[35:29] ages for the
[35:31] sanctification and now verse
[35:40] 10 Esther had not showed her people nor
[35:43] her Kindred for Mori had charged her
[35:46] that she should not show
[35:55] it and walked every day before the court
[35:58] of the women's house to know how Esther
[36:00] did and what should become of
[36:23] her now when every maid's turn was come
[36:26] to go in to the King aurus after that
[36:30] she had been 12 months according to the
[36:32] manner of the women for so were the days
[36:35] their purifications accomplished to Wi 6
[36:37] months with oil of my and 6 months uh
[36:40] with sweet o odors and with other things
[36:44] for the purifying of the
[36:55] women
[36:57] then thus came ever Maiden unto the king
[36:59] whatsoever she desired was given to her
[37:03] to go with her out of the house of the
[37:05] women onto the King's
[37:22] house in the evening she went and on the
[37:25] tomorrow she returned into to the second
[37:27] house of the women to the custody of
[37:29] shagas the king uh the king's
[37:31] Chamberlain which kept the concubines
[37:33] she came in unto the king no more except
[37:36] the king delighted in her and that she
[37:39] were called by
[37:41] name and so then onto this
[37:45] stage Esther just like every other women
[37:49] they were all
[37:53] virgins and Esther being just like the
[37:55] others
[37:58] they were picked up from where they were
[38:01] at and they were taken to the house of
[38:04] Hai to be
[38:07] purified and then now every
[38:12] woman had the opportunity to go and
[38:14] spend the night with the
[38:17] King and if the King was well pleased
[38:20] with
[38:21] her she he would choose her as uh his
[38:25] Queen
[38:27] so then I want you to notice
[38:30] something there were women that came
[38:32] before
[38:35] Esther and then there were
[38:38] women that stayed even after
[38:43] Esther that did not have the opportunity
[38:45] to go with the
[38:47] King and to spend the night with
[38:50] him because Esther was already chosen to
[38:53] be the
[38:55] queen
[38:58] so then the women that came before
[39:01] Esther they would spend the night with
[39:03] the
[39:04] King but he would not choose them as His
[39:09] Queen and so then they were taken onto a
[39:11] different
[39:13] home which was the house of
[39:17] shazz and the name
[39:21] shazz uh
[39:25] means the king's Chamberlain uh who kept
[39:28] the conab
[39:33] bines he that presses the fleece he that
[39:36] presses the fleece
[39:39] sorry and it also says that he is the
[39:41] shear of
[39:45] wall and what is the importance of
[39:49] this and just like every other priest in
[39:52] the
[39:53] Tabernacle he had to be dressed in a
[39:55] certain manner
[39:59] when he would enter into the presence of
[40:02] God now the name of Shas once once
[40:07] again means that he presses the fleece
[40:09] and Shearer of
[40:12] wall and then in Ezekiel
[40:25] 44:15
[40:31] but the priest the priest Levites the
[40:34] sons of zadok that kept the charge of My
[40:36] Sanctuary when the the children of
[40:38] Israel went astray from me they shall
[40:40] come near to me to minister unto me and
[40:42] they shall stand before me to offer unto
[40:45] me the fat and the blood sayith the Lord
[40:54] God they shall enter into my sanctuary
[40:56] and they shall come near to my table to
[40:58] minister unto me and they shall keep my
[41:12] charge and it shall come to pass that
[41:14] when they enter into the gates of the
[41:16] inner Court they shall be clothed with
[41:18] linen garments and no wool shall come
[41:21] upon them while they minister in the
[41:23] gates of the inner court and within
[41:29] so then you can even see that God
[41:31] required of the priests
[41:35] themselves that they could not dress
[41:37] themselves with something that had
[41:39] wool now returning back to
[41:43] Esther if a woman went and spend the
[41:45] night with the
[41:47] King but was not chosen to be the
[41:51] queen she was then taken to the house
[41:55] ofgas
[41:57] which means uh uh he that presses the
[42:00] fleece and Shear of
[42:03] wool and brother bam
[42:05] says in the message the church and its
[42:10] condition oh God what a difference it
[42:14] makes I remember when you sheared me
[42:17] once you took my wife my baby my daddy
[42:22] and my
[42:24] brother you sheared me
[42:28] yet in my
[42:30] heart I knew I loved
[42:32] you how you've blessed
[42:35] me how good you've
[42:37] been all that I
[42:39] am all that I could
[42:42] be all that I will ever
[42:45] be it's you God it's
[42:48] you I confess my
[42:52] wrongs I confess all that I've ever done
[42:55] or thought
[42:59] just Shear me off Lord I want to be your
[43:02] lamb not only that
[43:06] Lord but take every person in here this
[43:09] morning every
[43:12] sheep and those who would want to be
[43:15] sheep Shear all of them
[43:18] off this morning
[43:23] Lord put their little feet around the
[43:26] stocks of the
[43:30] Gospel May the Holy Spirit lead them to
[43:33] repentance just
[43:36] now know that they've been indifferent
[43:39] towards
[43:41] God and may He Shear all the
[43:44] indifferences off all of the
[43:47] world and all of the things of the
[43:51] world you share it all off this morning
[43:55] Lord
[43:57] that we can stand cool and quiet before
[44:02] you as Born Again Christians Grant it
[44:06] Lord Now
[44:08] esther she had to
[44:11] reflect what was already there with the
[44:14] King just as I said in the
[44:17] beginning what's within our own
[44:20] heart will reflect what's in the God's
[44:23] throne and so then these virgins
[44:27] that went with the king before
[44:32] Esther they also even amongst them had
[44:35] things of the
[44:37] world and so then the king did not
[44:39] Delight himself with
[44:42] them and so then they were sent to the
[44:45] Shear's
[44:47] house but then when Esther came with the
[44:52] King Esther already came reflecting the
[44:55] the meek Spirit of a
[44:58] lamb and that's why when somebody
[45:00] approaches
[45:03] God the Bible tells us that we should
[45:05] approach with him with
[45:07] faith and faith is an omnipotent
[45:12] power and brother B says that when he
[45:14] talks about
[45:17] Lazarus uh brother B says that his
[45:19] sister had omnipotent
[45:21] faith in
[45:24] God
[45:26] and then there was the omnipotent God in
[45:29] flesh to be able to respond to her
[45:32] request and you as the Bride of Jesus
[45:36] Christ you within yourself have an an
[45:40] omnipotence but as you're approaching
[45:45] God you are reflecting the omnipotence
[45:47] that's already
[45:49] there and so then when you approach unto
[45:52] him he sees
[45:54] himself he sees his own
[45:57] Holiness he sees his own
[45:59] justification he sees his own
[46:03] faith he sees his own Spirit of meekness
[46:05] and
[46:07] gentleness when you approach unto
[46:12] him and that's the reason why Esther was
[46:14] chosen to be the
[46:16] queen because Esther was reflecting what
[46:18] the King
[46:21] was Esther was reflecting what was in
[46:23] that
[46:24] throne and brother B says that whatever
[46:28] person and most likely in
[46:32] Prophet is a reflector of
[46:35] God we don't have our own
[46:38] light we don't have our own
[46:41] Holiness and if if we have some sort of
[46:45] light or any kind of
[46:47] Holiness it's only the Holiness of
[46:51] him because we are only reflecting that
[46:54] which he gave us
[46:56] and that's the reason why those
[46:59] women that at one point they were
[47:02] virgins they had the
[47:06] opportunity to have that position or
[47:09] that special
[47:10] place to be a
[47:14] queen but since they did not reflect
[47:16] what the King
[47:18] was they were then sent to the Shear's
[47:22] house and then applying this to the
[47:24] seven Church agents
[47:27] Esther had seven
[47:29] women in her stage of
[47:32] sanctification and just the same as
[47:34] there is seven Church
[47:35] agents in the Holy
[47:38] place and so then we if you apply this
[47:40] to the
[47:42] message when brother bam speaks about
[47:44] the seven Church
[47:47] ages it's a continuing
[47:51] series and then in the month of n of
[47:54] 1960 of December
[47:59] and if you notice he preaches the
[48:00] message of Ephesus or the Church of
[48:03] Ephesus he begins with the first church
[48:06] age and then the second the third the
[48:09] fourth the fifth the
[48:14] sixth but then he doesn't preach the
[48:16] seventh he goes into a different
[48:19] message which are the 10
[48:21] virgins and
[48:24] 144,000
[48:26] now there were
[48:27] women that came before
[48:30] Esther and then Esther
[48:33] came and she was then chosen as the
[48:38] queen and then there were women that
[48:40] stayed after Esther that never had the
[48:44] opportunity that's just the same as
[48:46] there is the foolish
[48:48] virgin the uh wise uh
[48:51] virgin and the
[48:54] 144,000
[48:56] and so then
[48:58] Esther is representing the the wise
[49:02] virgin The
[49:05] Virgins which then later became
[49:08] concubines is the foolish uh foolish
[49:13] virgins and then the
[49:16] 144,000 are the
[49:19] virgins that never had the opportunity
[49:22] to be the
[49:23] queen and then as I was studying
[49:26] this I first
[49:29] thought that the
[49:32] foolish would be the
[49:34] virgins and the
[49:36] 144,000 were the
[49:40] concubines and I thought well the name
[49:42] is there it's all in the name the
[49:45] foolish uh
[49:48] virgins but the Bible doesn't teach us
[49:52] that if we go to Revelations 14
[49:57] the first
[50:08] verse and I looked and lo a lamb that
[50:11] stood on the Mount Zion and with him
[50:13] 144,000 having his father's name written
[50:16] in their
[50:24] foreheads
[50:26] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as a
[50:27] voice of many Waters and as a voice of
[50:29] great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[50:32] Harpers harping with their
[50:37] [Music]
[50:50] Harps and they sung as it were a new
[50:53] song before the throne and before the
[50:55] four beasts and the elders and no man
[50:57] could learn that song but the 144,000
[51:00] which were redeemed from the
[51:03] earth and then if you notice here in
[51:05] verse
[51:10] four these are they which were not
[51:12] defiled with women they for they are
[51:18] virgins and so then the wise virgins is
[51:24] Esther
[51:26] and then the foolish virgins which later
[51:27] on became
[51:30] concubines because they still retained
[51:33] within themselves things of the
[51:37] world they were still within the kingdom
[51:39] of this
[51:40] King but they were not the
[51:43] queen just the same as the foolish
[51:46] virgin will have eternal
[51:50] life but will have to go through that
[51:52] Great
[51:54] Tribulation
[51:55] to be able to uh Shear off all of the
[51:58] world that remained with
[52:02] them and then those uh uh 144 that were
[52:06] never able to be a a
[52:09] queen they were a
[52:11] virgin those were the
[52:18] 144,000 and then Esther when she was
[52:21] chosen in Esther
[52:24] 2:15
[52:41] now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[52:43] of abiel the uncle of Mori who had taken
[52:45] her for his daughter was come uh was
[52:48] come to go in unto the king she required
[52:51] nothing but will Hagi the king's
[52:53] Chamberlain The Keeper of the Wom wom
[52:55] and appointed and Esther obtained favor
[52:57] in the sight of all them that looked
[52:59] upon
[53:08] her so Esther was taken under the king
[53:11] hurus into the house uh into his house
[53:15] Royal in the 10th month which is the
[53:17] month of tth in the seventh year of his
[53:21] Reign so it was in the 10th
[53:23] month in the sth
[53:26] year
[53:30] 107 and what scripture does it come to
[53:32] mind of
[53:34] 107 in Revelations
[53:38] 107 and brother bam says in the message
[53:40] the Feast of the
[53:43] trumpets notice in Revelations
[53:49] 10127 all the Mysteries are to be
[53:51] revealed to the
[53:54] bride
[53:56] by the messenger of the lady OA
[54:01] church so then we've come to find out
[54:03] that Esther was chosen on the 10th
[54:06] month in the seventh
[54:11] year and then here the Bible tells us
[54:13] that the messenger of the Lea
[54:16] churches will reveal the Mysteries onto
[54:19] the
[54:20] bride the
[54:21] resurrection is a
[54:24] mystery
[54:25] in the book of uh 1 Corinthians
[54:31] 15:49 now remember Esther was already
[54:33] reflecting that which was already on the
[54:35] throne and now notice what it says
[54:44] here and as we have borne the image of
[54:46] the Earthly we shall also bear the image
[54:48] of the
[54:54] heaven
[54:57] cor now this I say Brethren that the
[54:59] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[55:01] kingdom of God neither does corruption
[55:03] inherit
[55:05] incorruption now as I said your
[55:09] heart if you're a
[55:12] Christian you are currently reflecting
[55:14] what's in God's
[55:17] Throne that's the reason why through
[55:19] faith we can approach unto
[55:24] him but on the day of Resurrection it's
[55:26] not a spiritual
[55:29] approach it is become a physical
[55:32] approach and uh
[55:35] nonetheless you are in need of a
[55:40] body that reflects that which is already
[55:42] in the Throne of
[55:45] God because returning back to
[55:51] Esther Esther had a petition that she
[55:53] wanted to Grant or give unto the king
[55:59] but she couldn't approach the king
[56:00] because he was in his
[56:05] throne and there was a law or decree
[56:08] that was commanded that if anybody would
[56:10] approach that Throne without any
[56:11] invitation they would
[56:13] die because they were not
[56:15] called and they were very
[56:20] indignant and so us approaching the
[56:23] Throne of God in the physical
[56:27] sense we cannot do it with this
[56:30] body because this body is very
[56:34] sinful this body is Unworthy of
[56:39] it and so nonetheless God is going to
[56:41] give us a brand new
[56:44] body that will reflect the
[56:46] Holiness and the
[56:48] justice that it's already
[56:53] there
[56:59] and look
[57:02] death is one of those
[57:05] Powers that's in the devil's
[57:09] Kingdom and then in the Book of Esther
[57:11] we show that
[57:13] amen represents the
[57:16] devil if I had more time I would explain
[57:19] in detail a little bit more of
[57:21] everything but I want to keep myself
[57:23] subject to time
[57:26] R but in the book of uh Romans
[57:30] 5:17 look at how it speaks about uh
[57:34] death it speaks here death as if it were
[57:38] a
[57:53] kingdom
[57:56] for If by one man's offense death Reign
[57:58] by one much more they which receive
[58:01] abundance of grace and the gift of
[58:03] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[58:05] Jesus
[58:08] Christ so in the spiritual sense you
[58:11] already have access to God's
[58:13] kingdom because you were now born in
[58:16] God's
[58:17] kingdom but then God also has a a
[58:20] literal
[58:21] Kingdom he has a future home
[58:27] and so then for us to physically go into
[58:28] that
[58:30] Kingdom and uh brother bam even
[58:34] says that uh the New Jerusalem is the
[58:37] new uh
[58:39] Kingdom or the holy
[58:43] place and so then for you to be able to
[58:45] live in that Holy
[58:47] place in the New
[58:50] Jerusalem you need a
[58:53] body that it has is able to be in the
[58:55] Holy
[58:56] place and for that reason this
[59:00] body are the outer courts the
[59:04] theophany is the holy
[59:07] place and that glorified
[59:09] body is the holiest of
[59:14] holy and so then when you approach Jesus
[59:18] Christ in the literal
[59:21] Resurrection you will then have a
[59:23] body
[59:25] that will reflect the Holiness that
[59:27] Jesus Christ has right
[59:30] now because if there was somebody that
[59:33] would physically approach Jesus Christ
[59:34] at this
[59:35] moment just the same as it was in the
[59:37] Old
[59:40] Testament when the priest would go into
[59:42] the holiest of
[59:43] holiest and would not confess their sins
[59:47] they would fall
[59:49] dead and so we are also in a body that's
[59:52] of
[59:53] death but being that we are in
[59:59] Grace and then through Grace he redeemed
[1:00:01] two things our soul and our
[1:00:07] bodies and so then on the literal
[1:00:11] Resurrection we are all going to have a
[1:00:15] body that will reflect the
[1:00:18] Holiness that will reflect the holy the
[1:00:21] holiest
[1:00:23] place
[1:00:25] which is the literal place of Jesus
[1:00:29] Christ and look in the in God's throne
[1:00:32] in the
[1:00:36] Tabernacle there are certain beings that
[1:00:38] are called sarapin or
[1:00:41] cherabin and they have wings they have
[1:00:44] six
[1:00:46] wings and brother B says that two of
[1:00:48] them are to
[1:00:50] fly and two of them are to cover their
[1:00:53] face and two of them are are for the
[1:00:56] covering of the
[1:01:00] feet and brother Bram says that these
[1:01:02] beings are holy
[1:01:04] beings beings that never committed
[1:01:08] sin but nonetheless they cannot even see
[1:01:12] God they live in his
[1:01:15] presence but they have their eyes
[1:01:18] covered they cannot see
[1:01:20] God but then when he speaks about
[1:01:23] us
[1:01:25] he says that we shall see
[1:01:27] him because we shall be like
[1:01:30] him just the same as Jesus Christ he has
[1:01:34] a
[1:01:36] theophany and he himself will be in a
[1:01:38] glorified
[1:01:40] condition you yourself have a
[1:01:44] theophany and then you will be in a
[1:01:46] glorified
[1:01:48] condition that will reflect his pure
[1:01:52] Holiness and so then approaching unto
[1:01:56] him you will no longer have to cover
[1:01:59] yourself being that you are now just
[1:02:02] like
[1:02:03] him in the uh feminine
[1:02:07] side you yourself are the female
[1:02:11] omnipotence that was within in
[1:02:15] God since before the foundation of the
[1:02:18] earth just the same as Eve was in
[1:02:22] Adam before Adam was even on
[1:02:25] Earth and in approaching
[1:02:28] God being that you are God a child of
[1:02:33] God reflecting the spirit of
[1:02:36] God you then yourself will have a
[1:02:41] body that will reflect the very body
[1:02:43] that Christ
[1:02:47] has and then if we read in Isaiah
[1:02:53] 616
[1:03:03] but ye shall be named the priests of the
[1:03:05] Lord men shall call you the Ministers of
[1:03:07] your God ye shall eat the riches of the
[1:03:10] Gentiles and in their Glory shall ye
[1:03:13] boast
[1:03:23] yourselves and their seed shall be known
[1:03:26] among the Gentiles and their offspring
[1:03:27] among the people all that see them shall
[1:03:30] acknowledge them they uh that they are
[1:03:33] the seed which the Lord God hath
[1:03:50] blessed I will greatly rejoice in the
[1:03:52] Lord my soul shall be joyful in my my
[1:03:54] God for he hath clothed me with the
[1:03:56] garments of Salvation he hath covered me
[1:03:58] with the robe of righteousness as a
[1:04:00] bridegroom deth himself with ornaments
[1:04:03] as a bride or orinth herself with her
[1:04:08] jewels and then uh very quickly in the
[1:04:11] song of
[1:04:12] salmon uh chapter 6 verse
[1:04:20] 8 there are three score queens and four
[1:04:22] score concubines and the virgins without
[1:04:25] number so then we find that there's
[1:04:27] three groups
[1:04:29] here just the same as we talked about
[1:04:31] the three
[1:04:33] groups the
[1:04:35] 144,000 the foolish version and the wise
[1:04:39] version and then in verse
[1:04:53] n
[1:04:55] my Dove my undefiled is but one she is
[1:04:57] the only one of her mother she is the
[1:04:59] choice one of her that bear her the
[1:05:02] daughters saw her and blessed her yeah
[1:05:05] the queens and the concubines and they
[1:05:06] praised
[1:05:07] her and then in verse
[1:05:18] 10 who is she that lookth forth as
[1:05:20] morning Fair as Moon clear as a sun and
[1:05:23] terrible as a army with
[1:05:26] banners and so then when Solomon speaks
[1:05:28] speaks about his uh
[1:05:33] wife he says that she is and terrible as
[1:05:36] an army with
[1:05:39] banners and then in Revelations
[1:05:49] 197 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:05:51] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:05:53] Lamb is come and his wife hath made
[1:05:55] herself
[1:06:05] ready it says and to her was granted
[1:06:08] that she should be a raid and fine linen
[1:06:10] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:06:12] the righteous of of
[1:06:17] saints so when it speaks about her it
[1:06:19] says that she she was clothed and fine
[1:06:23] linen and then in verse
[1:06:27] 14 the armies which were in
[1:06:31] heaven uh clothed and fine
[1:06:34] linen white and
[1:06:36] clean were followed him upon white
[1:06:42] horses so then we can see that in both
[1:06:44] in the Psalms Song of
[1:06:46] Solomon when he speaks about the
[1:06:50] women it speaks about armies as
[1:06:53] well
[1:06:55] and that's what Esther was as a
[1:06:58] queen uh Esther when they had already
[1:07:00] eliminated
[1:07:02] Haman she used her power and authority
[1:07:06] as a
[1:07:07] queen to be able to help her own
[1:07:11] people so that they could take a
[1:07:16] Counterattack against all those that
[1:07:18] wanted to kill the
[1:07:20] Jews and just like
[1:07:22] you you yourself have to take a
[1:07:26] Counterattack against the
[1:07:30] devil when he tries to take your loved
[1:07:34] ones not only are you clothed with fine
[1:07:38] linen but he also speaks about you as
[1:07:40] being an
[1:07:42] army to be able to take forth a counter
[1:07:45] attack against the uh Hon's
[1:07:50] Reign which is the
[1:07:52] devil and
[1:07:55] so you as a king and
[1:07:59] priest you reflect that what's already
[1:08:01] there in the
[1:08:03] throne so nonetheless then now you can
[1:08:07] approach and then now you can use your
[1:08:09] power and
[1:08:11] authority to be able to uh fight against
[1:08:16] hmon I'm going to read one more quote
[1:08:18] here and then we're going to be
[1:08:21] finishing Esther was clothed in
[1:08:25] rightousness and that righteousness was
[1:08:27] already
[1:08:29] reflecting the scepter of
[1:08:32] righteousness that which was already in
[1:08:34] God's
[1:08:36] throne and so then you're going to have
[1:08:37] a new
[1:08:39] body a body of
[1:08:42] righteousness that will reflect the
[1:08:44] righteousness that Jesus Christ
[1:08:46] has and then listen to what brother Bram
[1:08:48] says
[1:08:50] here in uh questions and
[1:08:52] answers
[1:08:58] and what difference does it make if I'm
[1:08:59] living here or am I buried out
[1:09:02] yonder for if I am already paid in the
[1:09:06] penalty of
[1:09:12] death I'll be there before any man
[1:09:15] that's living that's
[1:09:18] right I say this in second Thessalonians
[1:09:22] fifth chapter
[1:09:26] I say this to you in the Commandments of
[1:09:28] the
[1:09:32] lord we which are alive and remain to
[1:09:34] the coming of the
[1:09:40] Lord shall not hinder or prevent those
[1:09:42] that are
[1:09:44] asleep for the trumpet of God shall
[1:09:48] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:09:52] first the privilege of those that are
[1:09:55] dead will come forth
[1:09:58] first that's how we know that it's at
[1:10:02] hand see then we uh then we which are
[1:10:07] alive and remain shall be changed in a
[1:10:12] moment twinkling of an
[1:10:17] eye and shall be caught up together with
[1:10:20] them to meet the Lord in the
[1:10:22] air
[1:10:25] so what difference does it make if I
[1:10:26] died in the time of
[1:10:28] Noah if I died in the time of
[1:10:31] Abraham if I died in the time of the
[1:10:34] Apostles if I died two weeks
[1:10:37] ago or right
[1:10:39] now what difference would it
[1:10:42] make I'll be there in a moment in a
[1:10:46] twinkling in a twinkling of an
[1:10:50] eye I'm only resting until that time
[1:10:54] and then now notice what brother Bram
[1:10:56] says here in the next
[1:10:59] quote now the Gathering will be unto the
[1:11:05] Lord as Jacob in the 49th
[1:11:10] chapter he said when Shiloh
[1:11:13] comes and the Gathering will be unto
[1:11:18] him there there will not be a lawgiver
[1:11:22] go unto from between them the
[1:11:26] feet until shallow
[1:11:28] come speaking of
[1:11:31] Judah and to him shall the Gathering
[1:11:35] be now so many people are looking for a
[1:11:39] church a great group of people to be
[1:11:41] caught up
[1:11:42] together a church a
[1:11:46] denomination some Creed something to be
[1:11:48] caught up that's not
[1:11:50] it that's not it at all
[1:11:54] the Gathering of
[1:11:57] people when God calls his flock
[1:12:00] together sonville he may take out two of
[1:12:03] Jeffersonville those that Indiana two of
[1:12:05] Indiana those that Kentucky two out of
[1:12:07] Kentucky those uh those that Mississippi
[1:12:09] two out of
[1:12:12] Mississippi that's exactly what he said
[1:12:15] not them words but he
[1:12:18] said there will be two in the
[1:12:21] field that's where there's day
[1:12:25] that I'll take one and leave
[1:12:27] one there will be two in
[1:12:31] bed the other side of the earth is
[1:12:34] nighttime I'll take one and leave
[1:12:40] one see the Gathering of people will not
[1:12:42] be uh not clannish or for
[1:12:45] group for a
[1:12:50] group it will be a universal
[1:12:52] Resurrection gathering
[1:12:56] together and the Rapture will come the
[1:12:58] same
[1:13:00] way let's finish right there if you
[1:13:03] wouldn't mind standing with
[1:13:08] me and so then when he's speaking about
[1:13:11] Shiloh as a place and a person as a king
[1:13:15] and
[1:13:17] priest he speaks about how he has
[1:13:19] redeemed
[1:13:21] you in both soul and and
[1:13:25] body and you yourself have the
[1:13:28] ability to be able to approach
[1:13:31] God but then in one day on the
[1:13:35] resurrection you will have a
[1:13:38] body that will reflect the very
[1:13:41] righteousness of
[1:13:43] God that's already in God's
[1:13:48] Throne that's what the scepter of Shiloh
[1:13:51] represents let us pray
[1:13:53] Heavenly
[1:13:56] Father we thank you for the service that
[1:13:58] you permitted us to be
[1:14:01] in we thank you for the revelation of
[1:14:03] this
[1:14:07] message that opens up the book of vure
[1:14:09] in which very few can
[1:14:13] understand and it's not that I have that
[1:14:19] ability but by the grace of God he gives
[1:14:21] the Revelation so his people be
[1:14:26] fed so permit us Lord to be just like
[1:14:30] Esther to pass through all those
[1:14:33] stages and to be a queen and a
[1:14:38] priest to be able to intercede for our
[1:14:41] loved
[1:14:44] ones and so that one day we could also
[1:14:46] reunite with
[1:14:50] you and that body which you have already
[1:14:52] paid for
[1:14:54] we thank you for your
