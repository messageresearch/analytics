have a story in our hearts and amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord today i greet you all in the precious name of our lord jesus christ uh yeah verse 14 all the way to verse verse 20. what a special day it is today amen amen but just like brother branham says every day for a mother is special the bible says and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou has cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly thou shalt go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel enemies he didn't only say i'll put enmity between her seed and your seeds but he said i'll put enmity between you and the woman it says unto the woman he said and i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in the sorrow that thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife he and um has eaten of the fruit of the tree of the tree which i commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it cursed it is the ground for thy sake in sorrow thou shalt eat all of the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall bring forth thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field espinosicardos de produced in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground out of what thou has taken and for dust thou art that thus shalt thou return and adam called his wife's name eve because she was mother of all living heavenly father we just give this service into your hands lord lord we fill your presence we know that you are here because there have been people with expectation lord you said where there's two or three gathered in your name i shall be there in their midst father we're here gathered under your name under your word lord we ask that you just take control of this part of the service and be with us father and speak to us what we need lord is in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen you may be seated amen amen what a special time to be here you know as i was studying this message i was seeing how special mother is special how special if i could say how special that office is uh it's one of the greatest offices that i see in the bible it's the office of a mother because everything was that you see in the world i really um really like this scripture here it's always hit my heart in a special way when i first gave my heart to the lord god gave me a revelation that i stays with me to this day that that us the spiritual family in christ is so far greater than uh flesh and blood greater than than a bloodline should have a greater bond than we have with our own families unless our family is a child of god and is serving the lord then that bond is just as great timothy 5 and verse 5 it says yeah verse 1 it says rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father and the younger man as brethren the elder women as mothers and the younger as sisters with all purity so we have mothers here today and if any any young sister needs help they have mothers everywhere that they can turn to isi and i have brothers here that can help me out with whatever i need brothers and sisters so today i just want to honor the mothers not only naturally but spiritually you're not only mothers of the ones that you you bore and you raise but you're mothers of all of us just as the fathers just says the brethren and the sisters i would like for all the the mothers to stand up and we can give them a clap offering [Applause] amen that's that's almost the majority of our church it's mother's son consists what what an office a mother holds amen um genesis 15 is a very um if i could say in lack of better words it's the darkest day of history but in the midst of that the darkest day god shed light in that place in genesis 3 15 it says says i will put enmity between the woman and are between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel it is before god cursed adam and or cursed eve and and the ground through adam antos he gave a blessing first before any of the curses came to them first he gave the prophecy of hope showing that there was going to be a seed through a woman that was going to bruise the head of the serpent before he laid down judgment he laid down redemption already and he gave and he said it was going to come through a woman through eve came the fall binola it says that eve her name was the mother of all living and what came forth out of her came evil and came good okay through deception came or through the deception came heartaches from her out of her came the deception and heartache a woman it starts everything out of a mother and i'm i'm sure um sometimes it's hard to hear over and over that a woman is a byproduct that's nothing but the truth but sometimes it's a hard pill to take sometimes she was the weaker vessel because of what eve did she was the weaker vessel but i want you to remember that in the beginning before he didn't give the man something greater and the woman less it was both the same covenant the same promise and i believe that there's going to be a day okay when redemption is at its fullness where there won't be any byproduct anymore that we will all be completely redeemed into our original state so sisters i i believe that you have maybe something more to look forward to than men god will redeem you completely so when god cursed um gave his curses in in genesis 3 15. he said cursed this curse is to the serpent this is maldita you're going to be um dragging yourself dragging your yourself with your belly all the days of your life and you're going to eat dust it's important and he said gave the curse to the woman so that you're going to have sorrow by conceiving and bearing children and your desires to your husband and you're going to be subject to him and to adam he said curse it be the ground because you listen to your wife curse it be the ground and and in sorrow you're going to eat these the fruit of the ground but when redemption fully takes place god is going to take those curses out god is going to fully redeem the land where there's no more sin on us anymore and god's going to take the curse off of the woman and and she won't have to have that curse upon her anymore and uh i was reading a scripture in isaiah 65. and uh if you look at isaiah 65 25. this is in the great millennium millennium he says the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt or destroy in my holy mountains thus saith the lord it made me realize that god takes away those curses of of the ground and the woman but he keeps that curse on the serpent he keeps that curse on the devil if the brothers can let me know when 45 minutes are up yes the woman is the weaker vessel yes that's what it says but the bible says that god said to himself it is not good that man be alone so then he went and he made a health meet for him entonces so yes you know we say the woman is the weaker vessel but it's the man that needs the help the woman was created to help the man because whatever he has to do in his ministry in his life and his work it's the wife the mother that is going to help out and strengthen him and do whatever she can to to allow him to fulfill his duties it was the woman that is made to be the glue of the family so she could explain to the kids of the father and the father he could ex she could explain the father to the kids no matter what i you know me myself and as as a father your personal mentor um when my kids see me coming from work they're so happy to see me is they're ready to play with me and and have so much fun and we will play games or whatever it is and they don't want to play with mom because mom is just strictly business but let them one of them get sick hurt or something is wrong but and they go straight to the mom director they know who exactly who to go to because she is the one that ministers whenever the father's out she's there teaching them the words whenever she's around with her kids she's the one teaching them where how to live and how to go and how to act it's everything comes out from the woman the promise came out of her la promesa but every fall everything that we see came out of her the same today amen amen so it's such a a great calling that a woman has and and you know one day god's going to take the curses that was put on jun dia dios bakitar is trying to perversely take those curses off themselves they're trying to take away the curse of childbearing by aborting children they don't want to be mothers they don't want to be subject they they want to take away the curse themselves and you see the world doing that today but the only way that the byproduct will be taken away is by the full redemption of our lord jesus christ so the first thing he says is he says i will put enmity between you and the woman that's a direct attack to the woman is he said i will put enmity between you and the woman the woman who was the the weaker vessel that saint seduced shall be his demise it was going to be through a woman that he was going to be conquered and because of that there was going to be a fight or a war break because it was going to be through a mother there was going to be a seed that comes out from her that was going to ruin the devil and the second it says and i will put enmity between your seed and her seed that hostility it typifies that the woman's seed it's an unending conflict between humanity and the forces of evil is a conflict see where that fight starts throughout your life you're gonna you're gonna fight as a christian you're gonna fight because you are predestinated seed of god you're going to go through a fight every single day but where did he say the fight was going to start the woman and i started to think to myself how how is it going to be through the woman in her seat we know that this is prophesying of jesus christ but it's prophesying of every mother also because good and evil comes out of her pocket it depends on how she raises the seed it depends and he will attack the mother and he will attack the family he'll attack the household carla familiar because we are the royal seat of abraham singular jesus was that seed jesus but then he went and he died on that cross he raised the third day and he spread the holy ghost everywhere now every person that has the holy ghost is the seed of the woman and every godly mother that raises that seed is going to be attacked because the devil knows that's where his end is he attacked um but god made another way in noah's time the bible says that the sons of god saw that the daughters of man were fair the devil said if i could mix my seed with their seeds i can ruin the seed but then the the humanity became so evil at that time to where god says i'm going to have to destroy the earth and the bible says that only eight souls were saved because of the sea trying to be tooken out and you see it throughout the ages you see that with moses you see how the devil tried to ruin the plan of god and the pharaoh said let's kill every child there was one mother that that loved her child so much that said you know what i'm going to find a way to save him and by faith she put that child in a river of crocodiles showing it was a shadow of what mary was going to do that she was going to have to put her child through danger she was going to have to put her into the river of death so that he could redeem the people of and we can go on and on and on how satan tried to kill the seed the very book of esther showing that haman tried to to annihilate all of the jews but there was a woman standing for her people and there we see jesus and herod try to do the same throughout the years they tried to protect that seed but mary was the last one to preserve that seeds that was the last stage right there there finally the seed that was promised was there jesus christ you know there's two things that um i notice about mary aidos that the catholic church praises her too much and makes her a god catholic and the christian church sometimes discards her too much to the point where we speak high more highly of of rahab than we do of her crisis she was a borrowed woman perfect it doesn't matter if that wasn't your child or not you bore him no importance and the love of a mother was there for him and the bible says that that strange things begin to happen in her life angels came down ankels singing gabriel came down and spoke to to joseph in a dream gabriel jose and the bible says all these things she kept in her heart realizing that this sun this seed was somebody special especially she was only 14 years old but her faith she accepted that seed and he said oh my eyes have seen my salvation now i can depart in peace [Applause] you know god told abraham to take his son up to the mountain this is for the fathers out there god told him to take his son to go sacrifice the turbulence in his heart imagine what he was thinking brother brown said that he believed that god would raise him up again but he knew he was going to have to sacrifice him and for three days entonces diaz imagine the pain the chosen seed that god promised me that all these years god promised him he was going to receive a seed it was 33 years 33 years she knew in her heart that her son was going to be sacrificed that her son was going to be giving up question yeah she probably was with a roman soldier soldier or something oh look at they say he's the promised son look at he they say he was virgin born mirello this is knowing she was walking up the same mountain to sacrifice her child raising him to let him go brother branham said she was a borrowed woman i can i i think we could all testify that all of our children are borrowed to us and we're taking them up so that we can let them go we're raising them so that we can let them go and see their life and do what they want because we see them we see them fall we see them sin we see them rebel porque vemos como esta or maybe 20 or 30 whenever they leave the house 40 50. who knows but that'll be the piercing of your soul that'll be your calvary saying you have to let them go and trust that everything that you did everything all the prayers that you made but now i am letting them go father i wonder if some people might say well that would be nice don't take out the trash i wish i had a jesus jesus if there was a woman that suffered more then it was mary maria she he was the perfect one yet a sword had to pierce your soul because of the reproach that they had to follow sometimes mothers have to carry the reproach of their children but as a mother they carry it gladly because that's their child and that that's the ones that they prayed for yo and no matter what anybody says that's their child and they'll hold them dearly lost a mother has such a great ministry abraham lincoln once said abraham lincoln well brother branham said this he said that abraham didn't have anything going for him this is george washington he was a smart man he said george washington he he went to school el sifue al escuela abraham lincoln abraham lincoln he was poor el era he became one of the greatest presidents in history and he said if i could say anything the reason i'm here the he was able to be one of the greatest presidents that was ever to live how at 38 years old brother branham says she already had white hair this element because of the ministry that she had to help the vidal minister okay you see the great mighty things that god did through him there was a godly wife a godly mother taking care of the children of you backing them up to the point where she was white-headed so that means that when her son passed away she was about around 48 years old and i think to myself i wonder how old she must have looked pregnant the burden that she had for her son yet he was god himself and she was that chosen but when he died and he rose again he gave each and every one of us the holy ghost [Music] but god doesn't see you like castillo anymore god sees jesus christ amen so we want to honor the mothers because your ministry is the greatest minister behind every great man is a great wife but it was a mother that raised him john wesley because of his mother juan wesley to give small little testimonies of how their mothers impacted them in their lives if brother johnny would like to come up with i want to wish every single mother a happy mother's day in the name of the lord jesus christ what other way to honor your mother today or any day the kyoto so i i also know that there's a friend here of my mother for many many years i remember her changing me like like like she was my mother i love that sister um i'm just going to read a a a scripture it's in proverbs 31 25-28 in proverbial and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and her and her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household her children arise up they asked they asked me to speak a few minutes only just a little testimony of uh who my mother is my mother and i see her in this scripture that that's the closest to god that we have here on earth and i just want to read a few quotes before i get down i'm very short spoken you know i don't like to waste people's time but this is the word of god it's it's from the prophet and this is what brother branham says he has to look at islam he says and look young children young folks i don't care what it is you always have to respect your father and your mother i think one of the awfulest things that i can hear little children say are young folks that old man and that old woman that's not an old man and an old woman that's your daddy and your mother and someday when when you see them going out of the room head first and you'll know it's not that old man or that old woman that's right you hear that preachers say ashes to ash's dust to dust you realize the best friend you ever had on the earth is going down now be a good boy be a good girl i heard brother brother branham say this morning that um he mentions that uh you can send a lot of flowers and uh you uh you know all the only thing she probably needs at times is a as a hug i know i got a lot of brothers hermanos i'm happy to see joe this morning um we love our sisters amen we appreciate we ask that god bless them today and and they continue giving them life happy mother's day [Applause] my grandmother's 101 and in september she's going to turn 102. eh and just in a tender dear way we just say mom and it's an honor to be able to have each and every one of you i would like to read a scripture deuteronomy six verse five and it says and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all your like soul and with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thy heart and it says thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou lies down and when dial rises up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontlets between that eyes posted and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates amen that scripture reminds me of my mother ever since i was very little simple i was always instructed and taught in the scriptures maybe i didn't understand them but on every birthday cantar las magnanitas the scripture of philippians 4 13. which says i can do all things in christ which strengthens me and those teachings they have followed me even on to today and i would see how the hands when they would have their little chicks it didn't matter what animal or dog would ever get close it didn't even matter the size of the animal that would attack the hen that hand would go crazy just to protect its little offspring yes and that's what my mother is for me uh there was one time that it was uh there was a house that was burning on fire and there was a little boy that was locked inside he was afraid and fearful you know and a mother went into to save him she was able to turn off the fire she did leave without any eyebrows and then the head the hair on her forehead was burnt off yes and that little boy was me like and i appreciate all of our teachings we know that the prophet of this age branham our prophet william branham el quinto evangelion he teaches us that the moms are the fifth gospels they're the ones that teach and instruct their children at home yes and they make the family altar may god bless every one of you may all the honor be for our lord jesus christ i just have a few things that the young people wrote down and it says like this thank you sister lisa for helping and being our youth mom gracious for guiding us
