[35:41] reach your policy
[35:53] there's a few rules when you get a

[36:08] it was limited live policy
[36:10] existed
[36:24] you'll
[36:28] the one that will see the money is the
[36:29] one that stays behind
[36:35] in this case
[36:38] you'll get the the policy
[36:43] when you leave this world
[36:48] but in the meantime
[36:50] you have a lot of benefits you can use
[36:53] today

[37:06] we'll go with future tense
[37:12] okay future tense what's in the policy
[37:14] for you
[37:19] we can go with the past podemos
[37:34] we'll look at different parts
[37:38] but in this case
[37:41] i really like and i'm really interested
[37:46] on the future
[37:53] i'm going to do a lot of reading
[37:57] there's a lot of information
[37:59] in here much information
[38:02] but we'll use three scriptures
[38:06] to base my thoughts
[38:10] we'll read on second peter
[38:14] pedro chapter three el capitan
[38:30] three
[38:32] 2 peter chapter 3.
[38:36] this second epistle of beloved
[38:39] i now write unto you
[38:41] in both which i
[38:44] stir up your pure minds
[38:46] by way of remembrance
[38:50] what scripture is that
[38:52] uh ii peter chapter three
[38:56] second peter
[38:57] the first verse
[39:09] peter chapter 3 first verse now it's the
[39:12] second verse that ye may be mindful
[39:16] of the words which were spoken before by
[39:19] the holy prophets
[39:21] and of the commandments
[39:23] of us the apostles of the lord and
[39:26] savior
[39:40] apostles
[39:45] knowing this first that there shall come
[39:48] in the last days
[39:49] scoffers
[39:51] walking after their own lust
[40:02] and saying where is the promise of his
[40:04] coming
[40:06] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[40:08] things continue and they were from the
[40:11] beginning of the creation
[40:19] of
[40:25] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[40:28] what
[40:29] of that they
[40:31] by the word of god the heavens were of
[40:34] all and the earth standing
[40:37] out of the water and in the water
[40:51] whereby the word that then was being
[40:54] overflown with waters perished
[41:04] but the heavens and the earth which are
[41:07] now
[41:07] by the same word
[41:09] are kept and stored
[41:12] reserved unto the fire
[41:15] against the day of judgment and
[41:17] perdition of
[41:32] of this one thing
[41:34] that one day
[41:36] is with the lord as a thousand years and
[41:39] a thousand years as one day
[41:42] ignorance
[41:44] is
[41:50] the lord is not slack concerning his
[41:52] promise
[41:54] as some man counts likeness but is
[41:56] long-suffering to us we're not willing
[41:59] that any should perish but that all
[42:02] should come to repentance
[42:13] perez
[42:21] but the day of the lord will come as a
[42:23] thief in the night in the which the
[42:26] heavens shall pass away with a great
[42:29] noise
[42:30] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[42:32] heat and the earth also and the works
[42:35] that are therein shall be burned up
[42:42] in
[42:53] seeing then that all these things shall
[42:55] be
[42:56] dissolved
[42:58] what manner of persons ought ye to be
[43:02] in all holy cumber
[43:04] conversations
[43:06] and godliness
[43:08] okay
[43:17] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[43:20] of the day of god
[43:23] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[43:26] be dissolved and the elements shall melt
[43:29] with fervent heat esperandorandos
[43:37] in san diego
[43:42] nevertheless we according to the his
[43:45] promise look for new heavens and a new
[43:49] earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[44:02] seeing that ye look for such things be
[44:05] diligent that ye may be found of him in
[44:09] peace without spot and blameless
[44:14] is
[44:23] an account that the long-suffering of
[44:26] the lord is salvation even as our
[44:29] beloved brother paul also according to
[44:32] the wisdom given unto him
[44:50] as also in all his epistles speaking to
[44:54] them the things in which are some
[44:57] things hard to understand which they
[45:00] that are unlearned and unstable rest and
[45:03] they do also
[45:05] the other scriptures unto their own
[45:08] destruction
[45:15] is
[45:26] ye therefore beloved sing ye know these
[45:28] things before beware
[45:31] lest ye also being led away with
[45:35] the error
[45:36] of the wicked fall from your own
[45:39] steadfastness
[45:52] but in grow
[45:53] but grow in grace and in the knowledge
[45:56] of our lord and savior jesus christ to
[45:59] him be glory both now and forever amen
[46:09] gloria
[46:12] amen amen
[46:14] i have a another scripture for you uh

[46:36] if you accept this policy
[46:41] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[46:44] for the first heaven and the first earth
[46:47] were passed away
[46:49] and there was no more seed beyonce
[46:59] and i john saw the holy city new
[47:02] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[47:05] heaven prepared as an as a bride adorned
[47:20] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[47:22] saying behold the tabernacle of god
[47:26] is with men and he will dwell with them
[47:29] and they shall be his people and god
[47:32] himself shall be with them
[47:34] and be their god
[47:36] yohiyunnagram
[47:48] and god shall wipe away all their tears
[47:52] from their eyes and there shall be no
[47:54] more death
[47:56] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[47:59] there be any more pain for the former
[48:02] things are passed away
[48:04] and
[48:15] and he that sat
[48:16] upon the throne said behold
[48:19] i make all things new and he said unto
[48:22] me
[48:22] right for these words are true and
[48:25] faithful
[48:27] established
[48:30] today
[48:36] and he said unto me it's it is done i am
[48:39] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[48:43] end i will give unto him that is
[48:46] a thirst the fountain the waters of life
[48:50] freely
[48:54] el principe
[48:58] de la fuente del agua de la vida
[49:01] who shall receive this
[49:04] he that overcometh
[49:06] shall inherit all things and i will be
[49:10] his god and he shall be my son
[49:23] [Music]
[49:27] that's pretty good to me
[49:35] [Music]
[49:41] isaiah
[49:43] 65
[49:45] 17.
[49:50] we'll read this last scripture and i'll
[49:52] explain to you a little bit of what all
[49:54] this means
[50:04] for behold
[50:06] i create a new heavens and a new earth
[50:09] and the former shall not be remembered
[50:11] nor come in mind
[50:22] but be
[50:24] glad and rejoice forever and that which
[50:28] i create
[50:30] for behold i create jerusalem and
[50:34] rejoicing and her people
[50:37] a joy
[50:49] and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy
[50:53] in my people and the voice of weeping
[50:57] shall be no more heard in her
[51:00] nor the voice of crying
[51:02] allegra jerusalem
[51:10] there shall be no more than
[51:12] an infant of days nor an old man that
[51:15] hath not filled his days for the child
[51:18] shall die and hundred years old but the
[51:21] sinner being an 100 year 100 years old
[51:26] shall be a curse
[51:37] and they shall build houses and inherit
[51:40] them and they shall plant vineyards and
[51:43] eat of the fruit of them
[51:50] and they shall not built in another
[51:52] inhabit
[51:54] they shall not plant and another eat for
[51:56] as the days of a tree are the days of my
[52:00] people and my neglect shall long enjoy
[52:03] the work of their hands
[52:18] they shall not labor in vain nor bring
[52:22] forth for trouble for they are the seed
[52:26] of the blessed of the lord and their
[52:28] offspring with them
[52:39] and it shall come to pass that before
[52:41] they call i will answer and while they
[52:44] are yet speaking i will answer ya
[52:54] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[52:56] together and the lion shall eat straw
[52:58] like the bullock and the dust shall be
[53:01] the serpent's meat they shall not hurt
[53:03] nor destroy and all my holy mountain
[53:06] saith the lord
[53:22] this is what's written on this blessed
[53:24] assurance is
[53:32] would you like for me to explain a
[53:34] little bit of the future
[53:39] this is according
[53:40] to my
[53:52] is
[53:56] so we all have a uh
[53:59] an idea
[54:03] this is not exactly
[54:06] uh you can't say thus says the lord
[54:11] [Music]
[54:22] okay
[54:24] okay uh
[54:27] well i have one more scripture for you
[54:30] uh would you put uh the slide up please
[54:34] transparency seven thousand years
[54:38] time
[54:40] is the timeline is a
[54:43] topic for today
[54:44] uh
[54:50] okay seven years is what god has worked
[54:54] with
[54:58] you can bring that to the garden of eden
[55:06] [Music]
[55:18] milanos
[55:20] from noah to jesus time were about
[55:24] another 2000 years
[55:31] now from jesus to us what year is it
[55:37] about 2 000 years
[55:41] so the arrow pointing up
[55:46] that's what
[56:00] if we have like we read people saying
[56:03] well we've heard that all our lives
[56:10] we still believe that
[56:14] that's what we're taught
[56:16] something else and uh brother branham uh
[56:19] explains it very well
[56:23] now the part i want to focus on
[56:28] it's from the rapture
[56:32] to the end of time
[56:35] that's pretty cool huh yeah and we
[56:37] we went over that i think it's pretty
[56:39] interesting
[56:42] but let's look at a couple things
[56:44] brother abraham says
[56:48] we would see jesus 1958.
[56:54] it says here and then the gentiles had
[56:58] two thousand years of training like the
[57:01] jews had two thousand years since the
[57:05] anti-deliverance destruction
[57:10] of those
[57:17] this happens in cycles of 2 000 years
[57:23] first 2 000 years
[57:38] this is the end of the gentiles
[57:42] another 2 000 years old
[57:45] now at the end of this age he's got to
[57:49] declare himself the same as he did then
[57:53] or he did wrong
[58:02] if he declared it the way
[58:05] and
[58:06] if he declared it that way and then let
[58:09] them get by
[58:11] just with their big fine churches and
[58:13] find scholars and everything if he
[58:16] didn't come back to the same jesus and
[58:19] do the same thing then he's not the same
[58:22] jesus
[58:32] is
[58:38] if he does he's the same jesus now is he
[58:42] or isn't he how many believes that he's
[58:45] the same silhouette
[59:02] [Music]
[59:04] then we're on the sixth day
[59:07] we're getting ready to go into the
[59:08] millennium
[59:13] soon it shall be time to run out
[59:22] millions will be that now believe that
[59:25] they are saved will be counted fodder
[59:28] for the atomic age miyones
[59:42] by the grace of almighty god by his help
[59:46] to his people
[59:52] that they might look forward to the soon
[59:54] appearing christ
[1:00:34] okay
[1:00:35] now
[1:00:36] let's see what happened with the earth
[1:00:40] the first two thousand years it was
[1:00:42] cleansed by water los primeros milanos
[1:00:46] the next two thousand years christ's
[1:00:49] blood purchased your salvation
[1:00:53] milanos la sangre
[1:00:57] and the last
[1:01:00] after now listen now after the
[1:01:02] millennium towards the end then the
[1:01:05] earth is as burned
[1:01:08] oura
[1:01:14] the fire cleanses the earth from all
[1:01:18] sins
[1:01:22] now that's the same as a person
[1:01:27] you need to repent
[1:01:30] in order to accept this
[1:01:34] assurance
[1:01:36] you need to
[1:01:50] to think right
[1:01:53] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:57] the holy spirit that gives you life el
[1:02:00] espiritu
[1:02:02] two types those
[1:02:04] typos do we understand that
[1:02:08] parallels
[1:02:10] now let's go to uh
[1:02:12] the next slide
[1:02:16] he does the earth
[1:02:18] that he's going to use
[1:02:21] in a plan of redemption
[1:02:31] it repented and was baptized with water
[1:02:34] in
[1:02:34] by noah
[1:02:38] jesus come and sanctified it
[1:02:42] by dripping his blood upon it and
[1:02:44] cleaning it
[1:03:29] up by joining church or trying to turn a
[1:03:32] new page
[1:03:37] but you are a complete brand new unit
[1:03:41] okay
[1:03:45] god takes the old man and burns him
[1:03:48] completely out with the holy ghost and
[1:03:50] fire and comes himself
[1:03:53] and sends down your representation
[1:03:56] diostoma
[1:04:25] let the mind that was in christ in you
[1:04:33] the mind that was in christ
[1:04:58] now let's see
[1:04:59] what happens in the future now
[1:05:03] the rapture is going to take place
[1:05:06] there's going to be a wedding supper for
[1:05:09] three and a half years
[1:05:16] the tribulation is going to be here
[1:05:18] for that same period of time
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:26] are you familiar with the sixth seal
[1:05:28] stan family
[1:05:30] the sixth year will open up
[1:05:34] california will go down in the waters in
[1:05:36] california
[1:05:38] destructions everywhere
[1:05:42] those
[1:05:43] those that are in christ
[1:05:47] will go in the rapture
[1:06:05] those that are left behind will have
[1:06:08] three and a half years of tribulation
[1:06:16] they'll be hunted down
[1:06:19] for their testimony
[1:06:22] they'll be hunted down like dogs
[1:06:26] sorry but that's what brother branham
[1:06:28] says
[1:06:43] that's the return of the bride to do
[1:06:45] battle with saint and his followers for
[1:06:47] three and a half years
[1:06:55] satan and his followers are placed in
[1:06:58] the bottomless pit for 1 000 years
[1:07:07] pretty interesting huh
[1:07:10] now listen to what happens next
[1:07:21] in order to complete that seventh day
[1:07:24] para poder complete in terminal
[1:07:44] we then have satan
[1:07:47] in the lake of fire forever and forever
[1:08:08] one last time
[1:08:11] but in the battle of gaga magog he's
[1:08:13] he's is beaten
[1:08:19] and then he's uh placed in the lake of
[1:08:21] fire forever and forever
[1:08:36] is
[1:08:38] so he's placed in the in the lake of
[1:08:40] fire for a time and jose is collocated
[1:08:47] we have the great white throne judgment
[1:09:02] and during that time
[1:09:17] the world will be proved purified by
[1:09:20] fire el mondo
[1:09:24] now do you want to know where you're
[1:09:25] going to live
[1:09:28] the new jerusalem will be 1500 miles
[1:09:32] high
[1:09:45] the world will see the light of the
[1:09:47] world
[1:09:51] isn't that interesting
[1:09:55] there'll be a light on top of the new
[1:09:57] jerusalem
[1:10:13] how can you assure yourself that you're
[1:10:15] going to be there
[1:10:18] it's by accepting this blessed assurance
[1:10:23] in order to accept his blessed assurance
[1:10:27] we need to
[1:10:28] repent
[1:10:30] get baptized
[1:10:33] be sanctified scientifically get filled
[1:10:35] with the holy spirit
[1:10:38] study your assurance plan
[1:10:49] and we don't want to be hunted down like
[1:10:51] dogs
[1:10:54] we're blessed to know this somos
[1:10:56] benditos
[1:10:58] there are many people that are running
[1:10:59] around and reading through the
[1:11:01] book of revelations and they don't know
[1:11:02] where they're going
[1:11:08] to know this by the message of the hours
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:38] now you need to take it
[1:11:40] do you want the message
[1:11:43] do you want the assurance
[1:11:46] remember this is for the youth
[1:11:49] take this
[1:11:51] acceptance
[1:12:06] it's up to you to open it
[1:12:10] we're in the open age
[1:12:12] open door age
[1:12:16] it's up to you to open your door
[1:12:20] one day that
[1:12:33] so if you want to make sure
[1:12:36] you're in the word
[1:12:41] there's nowhere else for us
[1:12:46] now i'm going to read to you
[1:12:48] all
[1:12:53] this message
[1:12:54] is from brother abraham
[1:12:58] it's a three and a half hour message
[1:13:02] you need you really need to take time
[1:13:05] off to study it
[1:13:10] and this this type of message you can't
[1:13:11] just hear it
[1:13:15] we have to take notes
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:31] and i really
[1:13:33] i really enjoy studying this
[1:13:38] i actually
[1:13:41] got most of my information um
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:14:00] it has a lot of information
[1:14:02] much information and i really like that
[1:14:05] i i really like to study that
[1:14:10] because it gives you an idea of where
[1:14:12] you're at
[1:14:15] when you go in a mall and you see a big
[1:14:17] old
[1:14:18] map there and it says you are here
[1:14:25] then you know okay well i need to go
[1:14:27] over here to get what i want
[1:14:32] i think that that's really important for
[1:14:33] us as a church
[1:14:38] to know where we're at
[1:14:40] know what
[1:14:56] it's important to me it's important for
[1:14:58] me so one day when i when i find it
[1:15:02] i asked my daughters if they still had
[1:15:04] it i gave it to them
[1:15:09] hopefully they'll find it or hopefully
[1:15:11] i'll find it in my books
[1:15:16] it's really interesting
[1:15:18] because you can get into the 70 weeks of
[1:15:20] daniel
[1:15:22] daniel
[1:15:27] uh the history the
[1:15:29] abraham listoria the abram
[1:15:32] all these
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:34] items you can put them all in a scale
[1:15:47] like i said we're blessed that we have
[1:15:49] the message of the house
[1:15:55] okay
[1:15:56] we're on uh slide number 16.
[1:16:00] the positivity says
[1:16:08] are you guys enjoying this
[1:16:10] just on this
[1:16:12] i i like this kind of information
[1:16:18] if you got eternal life
[1:16:22] there's only one form
[1:16:25] that's god
[1:16:28] and you are an expressed attribute
[1:16:34] if you if you're not
[1:16:37] you're not going to be there anyhow
[1:16:43] no man can come to me except my father
[1:16:46] has
[1:16:52] which passes away all things old things
[1:16:56] but these things don't so i
[1:17:00] so it speaks of eternity
[1:17:10] the holy ghost is eternal
[1:17:20] where you was at the time but you just
[1:17:23] recognized what happened
[1:17:30] see you were made from an eternal
[1:17:33] purpose
[1:17:36] because you was the
[1:17:38] manifestation of an attribute that was
[1:17:42] in god
[1:17:47] that thought of you and expressed you
[1:17:50] okay
[1:17:54] and he made an earth to take you out of
[1:17:58] and to make you a human being
[1:18:05] and sin come
[1:18:07] and along and perverted his way
[1:18:38] then his purpose rolls on
[1:18:42] hallelujah oh
[1:18:44] that does mean so much good think of
[1:18:47] just what lays ahead
[1:18:51] okay
[1:18:58] or after time has been fulfilled
[1:19:02] and
[1:19:02] all sin is gone taken away at the
[1:19:06] millennium at the great white throne
[1:19:09] judgment a time by the holy ghost
[1:19:22] after the world is on fire and baptized
[1:19:26] as baptism of the holy fire from heaven
[1:19:30] all sin is gone all germs is gone all
[1:19:34] devils is gone our temptation is gone
[1:19:36] all evil is gone
[1:19:45] today
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:54] then what does god do
[1:19:59] he can sit upon the earth see because
[1:20:02] all sin is gone
[1:20:10] that's the same thing he does when he
[1:20:12] gives you the holy ghost baptism with
[1:20:14] fire
[1:20:24] you and we can sit in heavenly places in
[1:20:28] christ jesus because we are all
[1:20:31] we are already in him
[1:20:39] not we will be we are now
[1:20:44] estamos sitting in christ jesus centados
[1:20:48] increase of jesus how do we get in it
[1:20:53] by one holy baptism
[1:20:58] we're all baptized in christ
[1:21:03] which we are now
[1:21:06] won't be in christ
[1:21:10] he's a great spiritual king over the
[1:21:12] spirit that's in us because we're were
[1:21:16] in him at the beginning
[1:21:26] then in this new earth let's look at it
[1:21:29] for a few minutes now
[1:21:35] and this new earth the skies will never
[1:21:37] be black again
[1:21:56] will never blow across her again like
[1:21:58] that
[1:22:03] no she'll never tear up trees and tear
[1:22:06] up houses and turn over things
[1:22:14] lightning in their wrath will never
[1:22:16] bulge
[1:22:17] from satan across there and kill men
[1:22:20] walking down the road or burn up a
[1:22:22] building
[1:22:32] no more no more there'll be no more
