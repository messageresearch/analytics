the children um so we're gonna give God first the honor and the Glory by uh reading a scripture and then we're going to be praying Let's uh go straight to Hebrews 11 7. how's everybody doing this evening amen we're gonna we're gonna have a good time amen just worshiping in the Lord and giving him the glory who can guess what uh what story we're going to be talking about today I can't hear anybody what story are you going to be talking about no uh yes if you didn't already know it kind of looks like it already but okay Hebrews I'm gonna be saying it a little bit different um in the King James version it says a certain way but I'm going to say it uh more simpler so that children can understand it Hebrews 11 7 it says it was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood he obeyed God who warned him about things that had never happened before by his faith Noah condemned the rest of the world and he received the righteousness that comes by faith Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just want to give you the honor and the glory Lord we dedicate this service to you father we come here with our sincere Hearts father we just want each and every person to receive something from it father from the youngest to the oldest we thank you Lord we ask that you help each and every person here we thank you we ask that you touch each and every person that's going to be in the play each and every person playing all the young people participating and all the audience father we give you the glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen you may be seated so we all know the story of Noah right he was a man that got swallowed by a big whale right no or maybe he was uh the one that uh took all the children of Israel through dry land between the Red Sea was that Noah who is Noah he was the one that built an ark right so our theme for this Children's Service is obeying God the obedience so who who knows about obedience I want to see your hands raised we all know about obeying our parents obeying the Lord right the Bible says that he obeyed God that's what the Bible says obey means to follow commands or guidance of somebody or to listen and to do it when Mom says to do something what do we have to do we have to obey right but Noah he didn't just obey because obeying is pretty easy right for us good kids obeying is really easy go take out the trash Oh that's easy I'll go do that go wash the dishes okay that's easy but Noah he obeyed God and the Bible says that he obeyed God on something that never happened before so what didn't happen what what didn't happen before no it's Noah's time it never rained so it never rained before Noah's time and so God told him he said Noah there's been a lot of sin in this world a lot of disobedient people people don't want to listen to my words anymore people don't want to follow my Commandments anymore but you're the only one that obeys me so what I'm going to do is I'm going to flood the whole earth with water now that's pretty normal maybe not in Phoenix but it's normal other places where there's a lot of rain it's like oh rain okay yeah let it rain but back then there was no rain there was and that was a hard thing to to think about that was a hard thing to believe because there had never been any rain and now there's God saying there's going to be water coming down from the sky it never rained before so why do you think Noah obeyed God what's what's a reason why God Noah obeyed God because there's no reason to obey somebody that says something that it has never happened before it's going to rain well it never happened before why should I believe him well the reason why Noah obeyed God was because he trusted in the Lord that's how we can obey God that's where obedience comes because the Bible says in Hebrews 11 it says it was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood so it was by trusting the Lord he trusted him with his whole heart with everything he had and because of that even no matter how outrageous the word was no matter what how crazy it sounded he trusted the Lord and he says you know what I don't care if I don't understand but I Trust You Lord and because he trusted him and because he have faith in him he obeyed him amen can everybody say Amen amen so he obeyed him so why do we obey our parents then because we trust them because they they take care of us they're the ones that have taken care of us our whole seven years our whole 11 years our whole life God has been taking or our parents have been taking care of us and we trust them we know that they'll never lead us astray that that they have our best interest that they want the best for us so then we could obey them because we trust them amen we obey our parents because we trust them even if some things we don't understand why do I have to clean my room it's perfect it's a perfect mess I like it where I like all my stuffed animals right here I like all my stuff right here it's perfect the way it is I love having my room as a kitchen I love having it as outside too I love doing all my things that I want to do my Explorations and my adventures in my room just leave it the way it is but here comes mom here comes dad you got to clean your room but they know best there's a reason why and we don't say well why and we stomp our feet but we know that for some reason I don't know why but Mom and Dad know best so what do we do we follow the Commandments of our parents and we say okay I'll clean because they know best who likes to uh play ball in the middle of the street when I was a kid I used to I loved it that's the best best place to kick the ball that's the best place to dribble because you know when when where I lived my yard was just full of dirt so I needed the street to play in but when it was time for my parents to say get out of the street Eli I didn't say well why I knew they knew best there was a reason they had my best interest they knew what I needed and they knew oh you know what cars are going to start driving by here they knew danger is ahead so it's like okay Mom I'm gonna well not a lot of time a lot of times I didn't listen and that's another topic of disobedience because what obedience does when you obey you know what it does what did it do for Adam or what did it do for uh Noah what did obedience do for Noah yeah all the way in the back the shark there it saved his life somebody else said it here it saved his life it saved his life yes brother it saved his family also obedience saves your life because God has the best interest in your life he knows what's best so when you obey the word whether it's your parents or it's your teachers or maybe it's a deacon maybe it's the pastor maybe it's your auntie or your uncle they know the best for you so we say okay I'll do this because maybe there's some Danger but what does Disobedience do well we see that in the story of Adam and Eve right the Disobedience came when Adam and Eve disobeyed God and what happened it messed up everything for us now we get tired now we have to go to sleep at night now we get sick and we get flus now we cry sometimes now we have to go through certain things now we have to go to school because we have to learn before then we didn't have to learn we knew everything but Disobedience it through everything sin covered the whole entire world when Disobedience happened and when we disobey our parents when we disobey what happens bad things happens there's consequences don't run the red light well there's a reason why we don't run the red light right maybe we can run it a few times because it's not going to hold us back it's just the light but you keep running it every once in a while there's going to be one time there's going to be a car coming the other way and hit the other car and that's the consequence of disobeying laws disobeying our parents disobeying the word of the Lord but Obedience of God what it does it gives you eternal life I could tell you this that it is the most important thing in a Christian's call is to obey God don't worry because a lot of times it's hard to obey God because we have this Fallen flesh but God gives us his Spirit to obey him he'll give us the the strength to obey him and that is the single most important thing to do is obey God and when you obey his word everything else will fall with it everything else will will come along everything else will fall into place when we obey his word but God gives us the help to do it he gives us his holy spirit so it might be hard to stop lying it might be hard to stop stealing but we once we receive the Holy Ghost it's going to be a joy to serve the Lord God says move over here we say yes Lord I'll move over here God says build an ark okay I don't understand but I'm going to start building an ark Lord God starts saying you know uh get away from the world it's doing this to you yes Lord I'll do it because I'm obeying the Lord knowing that wherever his words take me I'm going to the path of eternal life what a beautiful thing right his words is a lamp to my feet it's a way so every time we obey his word what are we doing we're following it as a path and what's that path going to take us to to eternal life amen and that's what Noah the story of Noah is is him obeying God throughout all of the Disobedience all the things that were going on Noah there was one man you can be that young lady today you can be that young man today out of everybody in my school everybody's disobeying but I'm gonna be Noah I'm gonna be like Moses I'm gonna be like Abraham and Trust in the word of the Lord can can everybody say Amen to that can everybody be that one person say you know what God's gonna call me because I'm the one standing on his word can you say Amen can you say it's going to be me amen it's going to be us we're going to be the Noah's and people might call you crazy people might say whoa It's what are you talking about a Rapture no God said so one day he's gonna call me home one day he's going to call us and I'll be there because I believed in the word of the Lord amen amen we pray that each and every one of you uh enjoy our little play uh we just uh you know we wanted the children and each and every one of you just to have a good time and just enjoy it with us amen so God bless you we're going to have the play it's going to be for a few minutes and then uh we'll be singing songs afterwards amen God bless you [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] in the beginning God created [Music] [Music] in the beginning God created Heavens in the Earth the Earth was formless and empty dark Ness covered through Deep's Waters and the spirit of God began to hover over the surface of the waters and created many great things you create a beautiful place called Garden Eden it was full of different kinds of plants trees or all the animals lived in harmony then God created Adam and then he created Eve in his own image and placed them in the Garden of Eden he blessed them and said be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth and government Reign Over The Fish the sea birds in the air and the animals that run along the ground they loved God and made every word that he has spoke to them the animals even obeyed them and the Earth followed their commands every day Adam and Eve worship God and God took care of them fed them man had a perfect fellowship with God there was nothing wrong God came down in the evening talked to Adam and Eve what a beautiful picture nothing could harm them no sickness could ever come to them they didn't know what old age was they didn't know about hurt they were in the presence of God which helped them control and guided them by his spirit God commanded them not to eat of the tree of knowledge one day Adam and Eve disobeyed God and that's when sin struck the Earth like a black sheep fallen from the heavens that paralyzed the Earth and throwed everything every creature on the Earth all of God's creation into bondage man was under the barnage of death sickness trouble sorrows and they were set there in helplessness because every creature on Earth was subject to it and everyone born on Earth was subject to it as men [Music] began to live outside the presence of God because of Disobedience they began to seek knowledge creating an intellectual people they didn't sleep under the stars anymore as they once did the people didn't want the presence of God but sought after worldly understanding [Music] the people didn't want the presence of God they built homes and shelters out from the dangers of the weather they became experts in forging bronze and iron they created musical instruments and they played them sin continued the man began to cry out to the Lord but sin was too great because of the Disobedience and Rebellion the Lord observed at the extent of the human wickedness on the earth and saw that everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil so the Lord said he was sorry he had ever made them and put them on the Earth it broke his heart and the Lord said I will wipe the human race I have created from the Earth yes and I will destroy every living thing all the people large animals and the small animals that were on along the ground and even the birds in the sky I'm sorry I ever made this but then there was one man that was righteous this was blameless person living on the earth at the time he loved to walk in the presence and fellowship with God and his name was Noah and he found favor with the Lord so God said to Noah I have decided to destroy the living things in this Earth for they have filled the Earth with violence look I am about to cover the Earth with a water a flood I will destroy everything and freeze but I will keep my promise to you rise up and build me an ark from go forward and waterproof the tar inside and out then construct decks and stalls throughout the inside make the ark 150 110 feet long 75 feet wide 45 feet high leave 18 inch opening below the roof and all around the boat put a door on the side and build three decks inside the boat lower middle and upper Noah obeyed every word that God had spoken to him so they labored for years building the ark and as the years began to roll by people became curious and what the commotion Noah and his family were making they began to ask him why are you building this Ark in the middle of the desert Noah told them because the disobedience and wickedness of the people God is going to descend water from the sky and flood the whole Earth those who chose to obey the Lord will find safety within the ark and know welcome them to come in [Applause] as he put up the ark laid the Timbers the board mix people laughed at him and made fun of him [Applause] now Noah finished the ark and stood at the door as he was sure that no one was going to believe him but for a hundred and twenty years he preached to the people and nobody obeyed then everything was ready the Lord said to Noah go into the boat with all your family for among all the people of the Earth I can see that you alone are righteous take a pair of every kind of animal male and female into the ark with you to keep them alive during the flood pairs every kind bird and every kind of animal and every kind of small animal that runs on the ground come to keep them alive seven days from now I will make the rains pour down on the earth and it will rain for 40 days and 40 nights until I have wiped the Earth of all living things I have created God's going with me he's right beside me I know how he loves me from my head to my toes [Music] and I'll never have to walk alone [Music] and I'll never have to walk alone cause God is with me wherever I go it doesn't matter if I'm high or low God's always got me in the palm of his hand nothing I'm scared of is [Music] with me wherever I go God goes before me he's right behind me he's right behind me [Music] from my head to my toes [Music] God is with me wherever I go it doesn't matter if I'm high or low no it doesn't matter if I'm fast or slow God's always got me in
