[27:09] Jesus spread over the day
[27:12] I keep
[27:15] [Music]
[27:48] God bless you all once again
[27:50] I thought of
[27:53] Hermanos Amigos
[27:57] operations
[27:58] all of our Brethren and all those family
[28:02] and friends that loved our sister
[28:11] like to just Express a few words about
[28:14] our sister Elsa
[28:15] he
[28:17] is
[28:18] I had the privilege
[28:22] to know this matrimony
[28:27] it was possibly around the end of
[28:29] September
[28:31] of 1999
[28:35] and at that time
[28:41] the means in which God allowed us to get
[28:44] to know each other or meet each other
[28:50] Ramirez was through their son Manuel
[28:53] Ramirez Jr
[28:56] and my son is
[29:00] they used to go to the same school
[29:04] Amigos and being that they were friends
[29:07] my son told me
[29:10] there's a little boy
[29:12] that wants us to go to his house
[29:30] and then afterwards
[29:33] well I'll see if I'll let you go
[29:37] so that happened yes
[29:46] and that's how we started to have a
[29:48] fellowship with our brother Manuel and
[29:50] our sister Elsa
[29:52] at that time my brother Manuel
[29:56] he used to work as a mechanic yes
[30:01] that made us have even more of a
[30:03] friendship
[30:06] our sister else I remember
[30:12] I remember visiting them in the first
[30:14] home that they had that they rented
[30:21] she made these really large tortillas
[30:24] and I already knew how those were made
[30:25] in Sonora tortillas
[30:33] these really large tortillas
[30:38] and that's how we started to have a
[30:40] relationship
[30:46] and honestly from that point is where I
[30:49] started to share the message
[30:52] then afterwards they accepted they got
[30:55] baptized
[30:58] then here's our brother Manuel present
[31:01] fighting the good fight
[31:08] we had many trips
[31:11] to various places California which was
[31:15] California Colorado
[31:16] Mexico New Mexico
[31:21] then right here even within the same
[31:23] state of Arizona
[31:26] California but now on a trip that we
[31:28] made to California
[31:31] I believe the area is called Watsonville
[31:33] is
[31:37] our brother Bernie had some special
[31:39] services there
[31:44] the issue is that when we were on our
[31:46] way back
[31:51] our brother Manuel's vehicle
[31:55] he was driving with his children
[32:00] I believe only manolito Jr was the only
[32:03] one that didn't go on that trip
[32:05] but coming back
[32:09] or the car
[32:14] on the passenger side
[32:18] the wheel or the part that holds on to
[32:21] the wheel is
[32:23] it was damaged a
[32:27] is
[32:28] and the trip was very difficult
[32:32] we were in the northern part of
[32:34] California
[32:39] and when my brother Manuel showed me the
[32:41] impact that the vehicle had I started to
[32:44] pray
[32:46] I told the Lord
[32:51] allow us to arrive with my nephew
[32:54] and stay there
[32:58] that right there we won't move
[33:02] until the vehicle is fixed
[33:05] our sister Elsa
[33:11] El peligro now she saw the scene or the
[33:14] the the risk
[33:16] she was so calm
[33:19] she was very peaceful
[33:25] and as we were looking for a place where
[33:27] we can fix the car
[33:30] and it happened that no matter how much
[33:33] we searched
[33:34] we couldn't find a single place
[33:38] where to fix the car
[33:41] in every way and when we're out on the
[33:44] freeway
[33:46] you're allowed to go 80 miles per hour
[34:02] and see how much it's bouncing
[34:08] and what happened is when I looked
[34:11] he'd go above 50 miles an hour
[34:15] and the tire would start to do like this
[34:17] Anton says
[34:21] and then we said
[34:26] that brother Leyva
[34:29] to make a prayer
[34:32] brother Manuel said
[34:35] he said well why don't you give us a
[34:38] powerful one
[34:43] because we just can't continue on like
[34:45] this
[34:47] [Music]
[34:52] our sister Elsa was a woman of much
[34:55] persistence
[34:58] because of our fellowship
[35:01] and I got to know them
[35:03] and how she was
[35:08] so we made a prayer
[35:11] and then we continue
[35:13] Hermanos Brothers dios God is dios is
[35:18] God
[35:20] and the same God of cancer that has
[35:23] healed cancer
[35:25] that has raised up the paralyzed it's
[35:28] the same God
[35:30] that our sister
[35:32] with all her heart yes
[35:40] it could go above 65 miles an hour in
[35:43] every way on the freeway
[35:48] and the tire was going so gently
[35:53] that we were able to arrive with our
[35:55] nephew
[35:56] without any problems
[35:59] the next day
[36:05] there was my nephew he had all the
[36:07] materials that we needed
[36:11] when my brother Manuel lifted up that
[36:13] tire
[36:14] to fix it
[36:24] there was nothing regards to something
[36:26] metal that was holding it together
[36:30] and we even went above 65 miles an hour
[37:27] our sister was very enthusiastic
[37:31] she's always so enthusiastic
[37:35] for example
[37:38] something for example like if I would
[37:41] say sister else
[37:46] would you like to take a trip to a
[37:48] certain place
[37:52] just say the word and let's go
[37:57] and that's how she was our sister Elsa
[38:00] is
[38:05] one thing that I admired of them
[38:09] every time we go out to trips
[38:15] or we perform uh trips with other
[38:17] brethrens
[38:19] but something that I admired about them
[38:25] never no matter how free the journey was
[38:30] they or the road was would they go ahead
[38:33] they'd always stay behind me
[38:37] and they were always following the car
[38:39] where I was driving
[38:41] I would admire that about them
[38:45] it's very outstanding for me
[38:48] and our sister Elsa hey yeah
[38:52] she is a
[38:55] Juarez she wanted to go to Juarez
[39:00] when I was on my way back over here
[39:04] they went over there to visit me
[39:08] and also to welcome me
[39:11] that I was on my way back now
[39:13] is
[39:17] and when they stayed at the place where
[39:19] we were at
[40:17] to greet her
[40:22] where there's no longer the need for a
[40:25] goodbye
[40:26] we're here in the time
[40:29] honestly
[40:32] we're creatures of time
[40:35] but over there that no longer exists
[40:41] but before ending I'd like to read a
[40:43] scripture
[40:45] they're in Saint John 11.
[40:50] thank you
[40:56] thank you
[40:59] so 1176
[41:01] Saint John 11 25 reads this is
[41:14] Jesus said unto her I am the
[41:16] resurrection and the life he that
[41:19] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[41:21] shall he live
[41:29] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[41:32] shall never die believeth thou this
[41:37] God bless you brother
[41:43] [Music]
[41:44] and all those that love her will see our
[41:47] sister again God bless you
[42:00] understand
[42:02] God bless every one of you this
[42:04] afternoon
[42:07] we like to give our sincere condolences
[42:10] uh La Familia Ramirez to the Ramirez
[42:13] family
[42:15] on behalf of the lighthouse Tabernacle
[42:18] is
[42:19] Montoya and my pastor our Dr Ernesto
[42:22] Montoya
[42:24] we come to express some words
[42:30] family they mean to us Los amamos we
[42:33] love you
[42:34] we appreciate you
[42:37] [Music]
[42:43] [Music]
[42:46] and the sister everyone that knows her
[42:48] everyone expresses something that they
[42:51] knew or remember about
[42:54] hermano the Sierra persistente and the
[42:58] brother was persistent
[43:02] she was very loving
[43:05] she was very uh kind
[43:08] very respectful
[43:11] Nosotros
[43:12] particular Persona and and for us and in
[43:16] particular myself
[43:18] uh Lara songs
[43:22] the reason why we had more contact with
[43:25] the family foreign
[43:47] and the sister just like our brother
[43:50] Ramirez
[43:53] they always gave us their unconditional
[43:56] support God bless you
[44:01] siempest
[44:05] they were always on top of helping us
[44:07] with anything that was needed at any
[44:09] time
[44:13] so that we can have whatever we needed
[44:16] to help that's not their son
[44:19] we had their son there with us
[44:23] and in seeing the manner in which he
[44:25] would compose himself
[44:31] and in that manner we could see the
[44:33] quality of a mother that they had it was
[44:37] the respect and dedication that he had
[44:42] we could see that that was something
[44:45] that didn't just appear out of nowhere
[44:50] but it was something that was taught of
[44:52] him by a mother that feared God
[44:57] a mother who was always expressing her
[45:00] love into her children conditional in an
[45:02] unconditional way
[45:06] and we'd always see that through one of
[45:09] their children
[45:11] she was always so loving and so helpful
[45:20] and then and then getting to know her I
[45:22] can understand why it is she was that
[45:24] way
[45:29] we've been taught
[45:31] [Music]
[45:33] the name of the person has a meaning
[45:39] and seeing the characteristics
[45:45] that seal the personality
[45:48] [Music]
[45:50] characteristics the expression of the
[45:52] characteristics of God
[45:54] through the sisters
[46:01] I can see the impact or the power of the
[46:04] meaning of the name
[46:09] the word Elsa many interpret it in one
[46:12] way or another but
[46:15] the meaning is God is abundance
[46:20] or the one protected by God
[46:23] or the one that is consecrated
[46:29] and that reflects what our sister always
[46:32] showed us while living
[46:36] that name was always used
[46:39] throughout the Middle Ages
[46:42] for princesses by Queens and by
[46:45] princesses
[46:48] it was a it was a name that was used by
[46:51] royalty chemical representation
[46:54] and what better representation that our
[46:56] sister has given it
[47:02] as a daughter of God
[47:10] always demonstrated what she had in her
[47:13] heart
[47:14] the power of the Holy Ghost
[47:18] the power of the Resurrection within
[47:21] Hermanos because like our brother read a
[47:25] scripture
[47:26] It also says
[47:30] that if we believe that Jesus died and
[47:32] resurrected
[47:36] so shall God bring with Jesus those that
[47:39] died
[47:40] and that's the comfort that we have
[47:44] that's the word that we give unto the
[47:46] friends
[47:47] our sister has not died she only sleeps
[47:52] she's just sleeping
[47:56] because the scripture that our brother
[47:58] Aurelio read tells us
[48:04] where the our Lord Jesus Christ is I am
[48:07] the resurrection and the life
[48:09] in me and he that believeth in me
[48:13] though he were dead yet shall he live
[48:17] and our sisters
[48:21] so therefore we've got hope no we don't
[48:24] have it
[48:25] we've got security
[48:29] not just the hope but
[48:31] within us
[48:34] the power of Resurrection
[48:37] that will lift her up in the ladder
[48:41] it's not something in the air it's a
[48:43] shirt a assurance
[48:47] and I give this as words to the family
[48:52] that that same Assurance she has
[48:56] that same power within her
[49:00] anyone can acquire
[49:04] that was the desire of her heart
[49:08] that the family would all
[49:17] so God bless the family God keep you
[49:23] uh may God give you the understanding
[49:26] the strength
[49:28] to be able to see
[49:32] beyond the curtain of time
[49:42] that she is in a better place
[49:47] she knows that the family is Left Behind
[49:52] but why algo but there's something
[49:56] and that's the holy ghost
[49:59] that connects us with that beautiful
[50:02] place
[50:03] and in having that Holy Spirit in our
[50:05] hearts
[50:08] it connects us with each loved one that
[50:11] has gone with the Lord
[50:13] so God bless you because
[50:16] God bless the Ramirez family to every
[50:19] one of them you have our support
[50:22] conditional unconditionally
[50:24] Familia every one of the members of the
[50:27] family
[50:30] every one of the members God keep you
[50:34] [Music]
[50:36] La Fuerza and may give you the strength
[50:40] to continue forwarding this time of
[50:43] tests
[50:45] and may you know that God's in control
[50:47] of all things
[50:48] and always remember
[50:51] the word is life in truth and Jesus says
[50:57] the resurrection and the life
[51:00] and he that has understanding our sister
[51:04] she's only sleeping she is
[51:09] she's gone with the Lord
[51:12] yeah she's in the Lord on that Latter
[51:16] day
[51:17] she shall resurrect God bless you
[51:34] I appreciate the trust of our brother
[51:36] Manuel and the Ramirez family
[51:41] brother Manuel the passing away our
[51:43] sister Elsa really caught us by surprise
[51:48] uh honestly I can understand the young
[51:50] men a little
[51:53] uh I'm about six years difference
[51:58] I lost my mind oh I lost my mom around
[52:00] six years old
[52:01] so then or six years ago forgive me so I
[52:04] can understand you
[52:06] uh
[52:08] I don't know how to lose a wife but
[52:13] I lost my I see my dad
[52:17] and I was there with him
[52:22] [Music]
[52:25] when you've got a pain a cut or a
[52:28] fracture in the body
[52:33] you go and you buy medication and
[52:35] medicine for the pain
[52:39] if you go to the pharmacy you get some
[52:41] pills for a headache and you take them
[52:45] [Music]
[52:49] and you if you have another issue you
[52:51] get some medication to counter-attack
[52:52] that uh
[52:55] but when a pain comes like this one
[53:00] there's no medicine in the world that
[53:03] can comfort that pain
[53:05] the only thing that can Comfort it is
[53:08] the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:12] what people do in the secular world uh
[53:20] they go and they they wrap themselves up
[53:23] in alcohol and drinking
[53:26] to calm down the pain and alleviate it
[53:29] or some use drugs
[53:32] to get away from reality
[53:35] but the problem only gets bigger it
[53:38] doesn't heal it
[53:41] what happens here is the only thing that
[53:44] can heal that pain
[53:45] according to the message the Lord Jesus
[53:47] Christ
[53:49] that will give you that Comfort the
[53:52] strength the faith the security
[53:55] that you can continue on
[53:58] you won't stay there
[54:02] because of Separation
[54:04] but it's a momentary separation and I
[54:07] want to tell the family the family
[54:09] members

[59:47] at that point of death
[59:54] she
[1:00:00] wanted to just reach the light

[1:00:18] forgive me

[1:07:15] inside
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:21] foreign
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:08:44] that was the sign foreign
[1:09:10] not personally for myself
[1:09:13] but to give attention to the word of God
[1:09:19] this is the word that our sister Elsa
[1:09:21] loved to hear the word of God
[1:09:27] if you're so kind to open your
[1:09:29] scriptures to the Book of Job
[1:09:34] verse 14.
[1:09:39] as you're finding it
[1:09:41] is
[1:09:44] let us bow our hearts yes
[1:09:51] Lord heavenly father is
[1:09:56] this afternoon Lord we draw close to thy
[1:09:58] Throne
[1:09:59] is
[1:10:05] Lord there are many people that know and
[1:10:08] that knew and loved our sister Elsa
[1:10:10] Ramirez
[1:10:14] and Lord we're here honoring the body of
[1:10:16] our sisters
[1:10:26] Comfort unto his children his
[1:10:29] grandchildrens
[1:10:31] through your word Lord
[1:10:35] knowing that that's the only
[1:10:49] we put all these things in your holy
[1:10:51] hands
[1:10:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:54] amen amen
[1:10:57] just a single verse
[1:11:01] Job 14 verse 14.
[1:11:05] foreign
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:13:05] you look at the trees
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:14:05] or died
[1:15:05] when there
[1:15:44] because death just takes us
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:38] if you'll just watch the way that nature
[1:16:41] works
[1:16:43] you can find God
[1:16:46] in anywhere you look oh that is
[1:16:50] you'll see God
[1:16:54] if you get God in the heart
[1:16:59] so then when you've got God in yourself
[1:17:09] you look at nature you see God
[1:17:14] doesn't matter where you work you see
[1:17:15] God
[1:17:16] because you've got God in your heart
[1:17:22] now when they talk about reincarnation
[1:17:25] and stuff
[1:17:27] that's foolish
[1:17:29] people
[1:17:36] a reincarnation exists and what is
[1:17:39] reincarnation
[1:17:41] it's reincarnation is when a person they
[1:17:44] live again
[1:18:45] the winters
[1:19:05] that's the life of a Christian yes he is
[1:19:17] nature cries and gives us a message
[1:19:29] that he is
[1:19:41] but we see that the morning
[1:19:44] and the sun will rise Corinthians
[1:21:12] that's a question that maybe we have
[1:21:15] Muertos
[1:22:10] now so is also the resurrection of the
[1:22:12] dead
[1:22:14] it's sown in corruption
[1:22:18] it'll resurrect in in corruption
[1:22:21] is planted in Dishonored and Gloria
[1:22:25] resurrected in glory
[1:22:27] is
[1:22:36] the word of God okay
[1:22:45] will be raised up with incorruptions
[1:22:52] but we're resurrected
[1:22:57] now like it says in the scription Romans
[1:23:00] chapter Romans
[1:23:03] and it says if the spirit of him
[1:23:10] Jesus from the dwell in you
[1:23:13] Jesus he that raised up Christ Jesus
[1:23:16] from the dead
[1:23:20] shall also Quicken your mortal Body
[1:23:23] Spirit
[1:23:25] that dwelleth in you
[1:23:28] so when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:31] he went to be crucified
[1:23:34] no one takes my life
[1:23:36] I surrendered
[1:23:40] resurrected on the third day
[1:23:43] and all those that believe in here
[1:23:53] or resurrect them on that day
[1:23:59] maybe many of us won't encounter that
[1:24:01] day
[1:24:03] but maybe one of us
[1:24:07] but the question for everyone is
[1:24:11] is have you accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:24:13] Christ
[1:24:14] that's the key is
[1:24:20] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:23] nothing else noise
[1:24:27] nothing else just the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:33] there's many people okay no cry they
[1:24:35] don't believe okay
[1:24:37] that Jesus Christ
[1:24:50] First Corinthians chapter 15. now let's
[1:24:54] start with verse 12.
[1:24:56] foreign
[1:26:02] is our preaching in vain
[1:26:05] your faith is also says
[1:26:08] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:13] that you're hearing this afternoon
[1:26:17] the faith you've got in the Lord Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ it's in vain
[1:26:23] let us keep reading
[1:26:28] and we are found false Witnesses of God
[1:26:33] because we have testified of God
[1:26:36] that he raised up Christ
[1:26:38] whom he raised
[1:26:42] if so be that the dead raised
[1:26:48] a person
[1:26:50] someone
[1:26:54] not someone that was told by Secondhand
[1:26:56] all right
[1:27:59] we're the most miserable people
[1:29:59] the scripture tells us foreign
[1:31:06] there's people with different religions
[1:31:34] so that their Prophet can get on that
[1:31:36] horse
[1:32:05] and they said the biggest part of the
[1:32:08] people wasn't looking for Jesus
[1:32:10] they wanted to talk to Lazarus now
[1:32:14] Lazarus
[1:32:15] he was a friend of our Lord Jesus he's
[1:32:18] the one that died
[1:32:20] he was dead for four days
[1:32:38] and the people didn't want to talk to
[1:32:40] Jesus
[1:32:41] they wanted to talk to Lazarus
[1:32:47] notice Brothers
[1:32:50] Jesus we say well if Jesus was here
[1:32:53] right now I want to talk to Jesus
[1:32:57] when people search for Lazarus
[1:33:02] now we're going to see why
[1:33:05] because
[1:33:14] race from the dead
[1:33:21] maybe they went with Lazarus that's at
[1:33:23] all
[1:33:24] lazarusa how did that work when you died
[1:33:28] you were there in the tube
[1:33:31] oh when the Lord
[1:33:33] what did you feel
[1:33:57] he speaks your name
[1:34:18] just in the word of God
[1:34:21] hey and from testigo he was a witness
[1:34:26] what happened tell me about it
[1:34:35] that you could raise from the dead
[1:34:38] that Jesus
[1:34:40] raised from the dead
[1:34:43] and I say
[1:34:45] in this building tonight
[1:34:48] this church this afternoon there's many
[1:34:52] you say
[1:34:55] personas at least a thousand people
[1:34:57] sitting here
[1:35:03] that's a witness that Jesus Christ
[1:35:05] raised from the dead
[1:35:07] in other words this witness is here
[1:35:09] there's people here seated
[1:35:12] they're Witnesses
[1:35:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Brothers
[1:35:28] they wanted to see him
[1:35:30] see him God's wit
[1:35:31] s
[1:35:33] that Jesus Christ could raise from the
[1:35:36] dead
[1:35:38] and I'm a witness tonight
[1:35:44] A Witness is someone that was their
[1:35:46] presence
[1:35:48] that saw it firsthand
[1:36:41] now you can say brother the Lord Jesus
[1:36:43] Christ he's not here that's right
[1:36:46] let's keep reading
[1:36:52] and God is showing signs and wonders
[1:36:59] that he did raise up Jesus Christ from
[1:37:02] the dead
[1:37:03] amen how do I know he lives
[1:37:09] in my heart
[1:37:11] how do I know
[1:37:15] he shows signs and wonders before the
[1:37:17] people
[1:37:18] how do I know

[1:37:26] and given me the Life of Christ
[1:37:31] and I know that he rises
[1:37:34] I am a witness
