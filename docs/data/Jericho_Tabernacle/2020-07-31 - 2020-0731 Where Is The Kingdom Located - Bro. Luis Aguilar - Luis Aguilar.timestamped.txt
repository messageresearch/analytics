[24:08] evening
[24:10] it's a it's a pleasure to be in the
[24:12] house of the lord
[24:16] like i like always como siempre always
[24:18] like to thank our
[24:19] pastor my brother johnny alvarado
[24:24] juanito alvarado for the opportunity and
[24:26] privilege that he allows us to stand
[24:28] behind his puppet
[24:30] privilege
[24:38] amen i don't want to take too much time
[24:42] but i'd like to go to the scripture
[24:44] quietly
[24:56] amen
[24:59] i know it's kind of odd to say to stand
[25:02] uh
[25:06] imagine being in your living room or in
[25:08] your room
[25:11] but we're so accustomed to
[25:15] stand for the reverence of the word
[25:21] so you may forgive me amen
[25:26] this is so new
[25:29] 1833 saint john
[25:33] san juan then pilate
[25:36] entered into the judgment hall again and
[25:39] called jesus
[25:40] and said unto him art thou the king of
[25:42] the jews
[25:50] jesus answered him say sayest thou this
[25:53] thing of thyself
[25:55] or did others tell thee of me jesus
[26:02] pilate answered am i a jew thine own
[26:06] nation
[26:06] and the chief priests have delivered
[26:08] thee unto me what
[26:10] hast thou done villa responds
[26:15] to
[26:21] jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[26:23] world
[26:24] if my kingdom were of this world then
[26:26] would my servants fight
[26:28] that i should not be delivered to the
[26:30] jews but now
[26:31] is my kingdom not from hence
[26:36] respond
[26:48] pilate therefore said unto him are thou
[26:51] a king then
[26:52] jesus answered thou sayest that i am a
[26:54] king
[26:55] to this end was i born and for this
[26:58] cause came i into the world
[27:00] that i should bear witness onto the
[27:02] truth every one that is of the truth
[27:05] heareth my voice
[27:18] is
[27:22] pilate saith unto him what is the truth
[27:25] and when
[27:26] he had said this he went out again on to
[27:29] the jews
[27:30] and said unto them i find him no fault
[27:47] one at the passover were you therefore
[27:49] that i release onto the king of the jews
[28:00] then cried they all again saying not
[28:03] this man
[28:04] but barabbas now barabbas was a robber
[28:08] entonces
[28:15] amen you may take your seats may god
[28:18] bless the reading of his word
[28:22] like uh once again we'd like to thank
[28:24] the lord for the life and the
[28:25] opportunity of being here
[28:28] uh
[28:35] we've been i've been having a thought in
[28:37] my mind
[28:41] and we've been speaking a bit on the
[28:42] kingdom
[28:45] and i haven't really left that subject
[28:51] so maybe if the lord sees it fine or
[28:54] sees it good
[29:07] but i like to entitle it where is the
[29:10] kingdom located
[29:15] and i have a subtitle that i got from
[29:18] john 18
[29:19] 34.
[29:23] that's where i got my subtitles
[29:27] and my subtitle i like to entitle it is
[29:29] do you know
[29:30] jesus christ
[29:35] i'd like to focus that on a little bit
[29:39] to ask you a question
[29:43] do you know jesus christ
[29:47] it's like if i were to say it
[29:50] do you know brother so-and-so
[30:06] i know who he is i know he looks like
[30:10] this
[30:12] but i never really had a conversation
[30:14] with him
[30:16] i don't really know him and sometimes i
[30:20] guess
[30:20] we get that confused a lot
[30:25] and we think we know jesus christ
[30:30] because we go to church
[30:33] because we've been going since we were
[30:35] we were little
[30:36] children
[30:40] because my grandma knows jesus christ
[30:45] because so and so or my family or my
[30:48] family member
[30:48] knows the lord
[30:55] we use that as i guess like a reference
[30:57] point
[31:00] we say well i don't know him but my dad
[31:02] does
[31:16] do you know jesus christ
[31:20] so i've noticed that
[31:24] uh that's why pilate pilato he said
[31:28] are you the king of the jews it is
[31:59] that's amazing what a bloody face
[32:04] naked scars all over his back
[32:10] because you got to notice the scene that
[32:12] we're talking about here
[32:24] said are you the king of the jews
[32:28] are you saying this because you know it
[32:30] or because you heard it from someone
[32:31] else
[32:35] that's the same question that he asked
[32:37] peter
[32:39] pedro what do the people say the son of
[32:41] man
[32:43] what do they say some say that you're
[32:47] one of the prophets no no but do you
[32:50] know jesus christ
[32:54] what did you say and peter said
[32:59] thou art the star of the son of the
[33:01] living god
[33:04] then jesus said jesus contest
[33:21] so my question to you is do you know
[33:24] jesus christ
[33:28] do you know him now when you know
[33:31] someone says you can approach him
[33:35] freely us
[33:51] when it's the uh young people to the
[33:53] adults or the
[33:54] excuse me let me rephrase this let me
[33:56] fix this when it's the young people
[33:57] asking the grandparents
[34:03] to say grandma or dad or mom
[34:07] abuela mama papa can you pray for me
[34:11] for me i've even had some adults
[34:14] you can't sit again i even had some
[34:16] adults
[34:18] elderly people uh personas mayors come
[34:21] to me
[34:22] which i'm a lot younger and they say can
[34:26] you pray for me
[34:28] for me and my question comes
[34:40] that's my question do you know jesus
[34:42] christ
[34:44] when you know a certain brother
[34:56] i'm not going to say brother emmanuel
[34:58] can you ask brother johnny this for me
[35:00] november
[35:10] but the question is why am i not going
[35:13] to brother johnny myself
[35:51] do you know jesus christ
[35:54] that's why in romans 5 1 romano
[36:11] can come on to jesus we can come unto
[36:12] god freely
[36:17] so that's that's why with through what
[36:19] jesus christ did
[36:24] paying for our sins dying on the cross
[36:29] now we have peace with him
[36:33] now we can approach him
[36:36] we had i guess you can say a broken
[36:39] fellowship
[36:40] with god
[36:45] whatever happened in the beginning with
[36:47] in the garden of eden
[36:51] we were cast out
[37:05] now we have peace with god
[37:09] so now we can come on to him
[37:12] and get to know him that's why we're so
[37:16] scared to come to god
[37:20] that's why some adults some elders
[37:24] say can you pray for me
[37:29] because they don't know god
[37:32] or the young people go on to the elders
[37:34] and say can you pray
[38:16] and lord i
[38:30] it strikes me when jesus asked
[38:33] pilate jesus
[38:37] you're saying this because of yourself
[38:39] though this is portimismo
[38:40] or because you heard it from someone
[38:42] else
[38:45] amen amen if we can go to matthew
[38:49] matteo matthew 4 matteo cuatro
[38:54] we find that here jesus encontra
[38:57] jesus was there in the desert in the
[39:00] wilderness
[39:03] he fasted for 40 days 40 nights
[39:08] and we noticed that the temp the the
[39:10] tempter came to him
[39:21] if thou be the son of god command these
[39:24] stones to be made bread
[39:34] is trying to figure out this being jesus
[39:56] and he was so similar to like any man
[40:03] i can see the devil starting following
[40:05] jesus since his birth
[40:20] and maybe perhaps the devil was doubting
[40:26] because that's where he sent for the
[40:28] first those kids to be born at that time
[40:34] and he wasn't so sure that a god a king
[40:43] where the cows and he didn't understand
[40:45] maybe this is myself
[40:46] speaking you could throw this away
[40:50] opinion
[41:33] alone but that every word that proceeded
[41:37] out of the mouth of god
[41:41] that's a good subject one day maybe we
[41:44] can speak about the mouth of god
[41:54] and took him to the very top of the
[41:56] temple
[41:59] and he said if if that'll be the son of
[42:02] god
[42:05] throw yourself cast thyself down
[42:09] imagine jesus being the top of the holy
[42:11] in the top of the temple
[42:14] in the party so he's noticed that jesus
[42:17] didn't
[42:18] didn't didn't uh listen to him the first
[42:21] time
[42:25] so now he's trying him a second time
[42:55] then satan says
[43:01] he shall give angels charge concerning
[43:04] thee
[43:07] and their hand shall bear thee up
[43:25] los angeles they're not they are they're
[43:28] not going to allow for anything to
[43:29] happen
[43:31] so he was waiting for jesus to do this
[43:36] so he's it is written again it is
[43:46] [Music]
[44:04] all these things will i give thee todd
[44:21] thou shall worship the lord thy god and
[44:23] him only
[44:24] shall thou serve
[44:29] now i want to i want to pause a little
[44:31] bit
[44:33] you might say well the devil doesn't
[44:35] stop us
[44:38] that even the devil said it is written
[44:43] now you got to be careful jesus they are
[44:47] being tempted in the desert jesus
[45:00] maybe it's a good thing that the devil
[45:01] is here
[45:16] which you know you grab a it's like a
[45:19] two wheels
[45:20] and uh you put something heavy in it and
[45:22] you recline it so it helps you
[45:24] move heavy things
[45:30] upon
[45:58] diablo
[46:13] whoever that mexican whoever it was they
[46:15] called that the devil
[46:21] was truly inspired real men
[46:25] because that thing
[46:40] is
[46:50] oh hallelujah don't you understand what
[46:52] i'm talking about
[46:55] you you put the dolly push it in there
[46:56] you slide it in there
[47:00] you push it back and who's doing all the
[47:04] work
[47:08] the devil
[47:23] see the devil was created for a purpose
[47:28] he said he showed all the kingdoms
[47:33] he should all the kingdoms in all of its
[47:36] glory
[47:46] that all of this belongs to him in the
[47:50] future
[48:46] 17 bcc
[48:50] now this will be i guess my base
[48:52] scripture
[48:57] jesus and then he was demanded of the
[48:59] pharisees
[49:01] when the kingdom of god shall come and
[49:03] he answered them and said
[49:05] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[49:14] observations
[49:20] 21st neither shall they say lo here
[49:23] although there for behold the kingdom
[49:26] of god is within you
[49:43] is the kingdom located in dondes
[49:44] encuentro reno when the pharisees were
[49:46] demanding him they were pressuring him
[49:52] when the kingdom was going to come
[49:53] cuando escaped
[49:55] he said he says it's not going to be
[49:57] here
[50:00] nor there oh yeah forbid the kingdom of
[50:02] god is within you
[50:06] we spoke about first seeking the kingdom
[50:17] now we're talking about where the
[50:18] kingdom of god is located
[50:22] in jesus here is telling the pharisees
[50:24] yeah
[50:37] now there is where the kingdom of god is
[50:39] at ies
[50:41] amen i'm going to read a little script a
[50:43] little quote here
[50:45] uh give me your little patience here
[50:50] brother brahm says do you said if my
[50:53] kingdom
[50:54] was of this world
[50:58] i could call any legions of angels
[51:04] but my kingdom is not of this world
[51:18] so therefore legions and powers
[51:47] that's why that's why uh jesus said
[51:50] jesus in uh saint john 18 and juan di
[51:54] this is my kingdom it's out of here you
[51:55] say no no
[51:57] if it was here i was saying for the
[52:01] angels to help me
[52:02] yo mandaria
[52:09] he said it is within you the kingdom of
[52:11] god is not in this world but it is
[52:13] within you
[52:14] el reyno de dios no estan esta mundo
[52:17] so all of those angels that were to
[52:19] protect jesus
[52:24] is now within you so all those legions
[52:30] and powers
[53:12] do
[53:39] oh you notice that brother branham is
[53:41] saying that
[53:44] how that prodigal son
[53:47] he was in the kingdom he wanted his
[53:50] inheritance
[53:52] now he left with his inheritance
[54:20] and that is how that prodigal sound son
[54:22] found himself
[55:16] he says but you don't want us to be your
[55:19] servants
[55:23] no it says but you don't want us to be
[55:25] your servants
[55:30] you want us to be your sons and
[55:31] daughters
[56:11] and we go astray and we leave the
[56:13] presence of the lord
[56:30] you want us to be you want us to be your
[56:32] sons and daughters
[56:35] and that's a very awesome thing
[56:39] that's why the question is
[56:42] do you know jesus christ
[56:46] do you know who he is
[56:49] know that he loves you
[56:52] many of us don't know that
[56:56] a lot of us
[57:10] because
[57:28] [Music]
[57:52] we know that the kingdom is within us
[57:56] but that's why he says behold i stand at
[57:59] the door and knock.
[58:03] now if you notice it's his kingdom is
[58:20] permission
[59:24] just like it is with the united states
[59:26] and russia
[59:29] it's a cold war
[59:56] do you say because your dad knows
[1:00:11] that jesus that is not just asking
[1:01:21] that's why they wanted to crucify him
[1:01:25] not because he lied no not because he
[1:01:27] robbed
[1:01:29] that because he adultered because
[1:01:32] there he was just a man
[1:01:47] he was a man that was trying to raise
[1:01:49] himself up
[1:02:05] they know and then they cried out for
[1:02:07] the blood of jesus christ
[1:02:12] because it had to be done because in
