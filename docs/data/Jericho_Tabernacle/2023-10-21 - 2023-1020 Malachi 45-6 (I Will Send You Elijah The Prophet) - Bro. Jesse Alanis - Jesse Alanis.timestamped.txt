[34:56] they they don't receive enough
[35:02] credit for their efforts and their
[35:08] sacrifices as well as our deacons and
[35:11] our
[35:14] ushers I uh like uh to kindly ask if we
[35:18] can give them a round of applause
[35:22] [Applause]
[35:25] please
[35:30] thank you so
[35:31] much may God bless each and every one of
[35:35] you for each one of you at your post of
[35:40] Duty I want to thank our precious
[35:45] Pastor for the confidence that he has in
[35:52] me I want to thank this amazing Ministry
[35:55] team
[35:59] that I'm privileged to dwell
[36:06] amongst in which uh I know I'm
[36:10] certain I'm nowhere near the Revelation
[36:12] that God has given
[36:13] [Music]
[36:16] them we know that the god of Heaven and
[36:20] Earth who created you and
[36:23] I from the Dust We tread upon
[36:28] works in mysterious
[36:32] ways so incredibly that man can't even
[36:34] begin to
[36:39] imagine how he conducts and
[36:43] operates he's the god of the
[36:48] impossible the same yesterday today and
[36:53] forever I'd like to do something out of
[36:55] the ordinary at this this
[37:00] evening many if not all our church
[37:02] members
[37:07] know at uh 3:30 uh 3:33 a.m. yesterday
[37:15] morning our precious brother Billy Paul
[37:17] brandom departed to a better
[37:20] life Billy
[37:23] BR he wasn't only a brother brandham son
[37:29] but I believe brother bram's best
[37:33] friend being God took his mama off the
[37:36] scene at a very young
[37:42] age brother brandham had to be his
[37:45] mother for some
[37:50] time but brother Billy Paul was a
[37:52] servant of the Lord Jesus
[37:55] Christ
[37:58] since a very young
[38:00] age he'd help his dad pass out prayer
[38:02] cards for the sick and
[38:08] Afflicted and I'm sure much
[38:11] more God bless his
[38:15] soul and comfort the precious Brandon
[38:21] family as a um a way to show
[38:25] condolences
[38:28] we'll give a minute of silence
[38:55] please
[39:08] thank you very
[39:12] muchas I think that uh any servant of
[39:15] the
[39:19] Lord will inherit great
[39:23] things or don't we
[39:25] know
[39:28] that he who he who he seeks the
[39:31] Lord shall have Treasures up in
[39:36] heaven and if we diligently seek
[39:40] him he's a
[39:43] rewarder thank you
[39:47] Father
[39:55] okay
[40:04] all right as we know uh we believe that
[40:06] uh brother brandham was that that Spirit
[40:08] of
[40:13] Elijah what was promised uh from the
[40:16] Lord in the
[40:20] word for his very Ministry is what
[40:22] brought me to this
[40:25] message
[40:28] to the feet of our Lord Jesus
[40:32] Christ which is why I stand where I
[40:34] stand
[40:37] now at my post of
[40:46] Duty and I'm sure that many precious
[40:48] brothers and sisters
[40:53] here and all across the
[40:55] world
[40:56] have received our Lord Jesus
[41:02] Christ through this
[41:05] message it's a tremendous
[41:08] message and such a blessing to each and
[41:10] every one of
[41:12] us that can accept this end time
[41:19] Prophet I believe uh we need to put on
[41:23] the whole armor of
[41:25] God
[41:27] to stand not only through this evil age
[41:30] we are Marching
[41:36] through but in order to fight against
[41:38] spiritual wickedness in high
[41:44] places for we fight not against flesh
[41:47] and
[41:50] blood so why would we need guns and
[41:55] knives for for defense against mortal
[41:59] flesh we need the love of God Almighty
[42:02] in our
[42:05] hearts called the go
[42:09] love for that is what we need in order
[42:11] to cast out
[42:15] demons the the evildoers in this
[42:20] world aren't the
[42:24] people but the the evil spirits that
[42:26] they're possessed
[42:32] by so that Revelation that God is
[42:38] love leaves from
[42:41] here
[42:44] intellectually and drops down into your
[42:48] heart then you really have the
[42:54] Revelation that is what each and every
[42:55] one of of us
[42:59] need and as we
[43:02] know in our hearts is an empty uh
[43:08] compartment that science and Experts of
[43:10] the human an
[43:15] anatomy can't even begin to explain or
[43:20] understand why we have that small Hollow
[43:22] Place in our
[43:25] hearts
[43:28] I'll tell you why that that that uh that
[43:32] the small departments in our
[43:36] heart let's go to a scripture in
[43:38] Revelations
[43:43] 3:20 for our
[43:55] answer
[44:00] and it reads as as it follows
[44:02] he behold I stand at the door and knock
[44:06] If any man hear my voice and open the
[44:08] door I will come in to him and Will O
[44:11] and will Su with him and he with
[44:21] me amen amen your very heart is the door
[44:25] Jesus knocks
[44:30] at usually a door mounted up to a
[44:35] wall usually has some kind of space
[44:38] inside of
[44:41] it and which is where your very in which
[44:45] is the very sole purpose of the door to
[44:47] begin
[44:52] with to store something in
[44:56] and to have access in or out that
[45:00] door so that small compartment that God
[45:03] placed in our
[45:07] hearts is where the very Soul
[45:12] lives there the love for God is
[45:18] found because in the
[45:21] beginning we know the devil chose the
[45:24] mind
[45:26] and and God chose the
[45:29] heart yet we must reach that stature of
[45:31] a perfect
[45:34] man letting the mind of Christ be in
[45:40] you and as Jesus
[45:43] said all that the father has given
[45:46] me I will lose
[45:50] none and though some may astray and
[45:54] backslide
[45:57] it only means you've lost fellowship
[45:58] with your
[46:02] Creator and he will gain you
[46:05] back as he's our
[46:09] designer knowing our minds would be held
[46:11] captive at one point or
[46:16] another by the dirty lying
[46:22] devil for those who he fornew before the
[46:25] foundation of the world
[46:29] World he's designed each and every one
[46:31] of
[46:33] us to seek after
[46:39] him in a specific predestinated time in
[46:46] place he set a certain humble process
[46:48] for each one of
[46:53] us which is justification
[46:57] then
[46:59] sanctification then once he's recognized
[47:01] your
[47:04] faith and we've been baptized in the
[47:06] name of our Lord Jesus
[47:09] Christ for for the remission of
[47:12] sins then he sends the gift of the Holy
[47:18] Ghost and testified very special
[47:23] occasions I'll send the Treo all all at
[47:25] once
[47:29] sending that precious
[47:33] Soul a heart pounding Supernatural
[47:36] spontaneous
[47:40] blast that'll leave such a blessed child
[47:42] of
[47:45] God not only running to the Waters of
[47:50] baptism with such an incredible
[47:54] testimony setting that precious sister
[47:57] and brother
[48:00] aside to encourage and point every soul
[48:02] they can to
[48:07] Calvary as we all have been commissioned
[48:09] by
[48:12] Jesus whether we be whether we be or
[48:17] not ordained ministers of the Full
[48:20] Gospel of Jesus
[48:23] Christ every true Born Again Christians
[48:25] main
[48:30] objective is to win as many souls to God
[48:33] as
[48:36] possible that we may be found
[48:40] blameless on that great Dreadful day of
[48:43] the
[48:45] Lord now if God promised to send the
[48:47] spirit of
[48:51] Elijah back to the
[48:54] Earth before the return of
[48:58] Jesus and clearly we
[49:01] know he's not only faithful to his
[49:05] word but he's obligated to
[49:10] it if he's uh if he hasn't failed
[49:14] yet he won't fail
[49:17] now he's
[49:19] perfect and his word needs no
[49:23] interpretation he does it himself
[49:26] time after
[49:28] time until all Prophecy of the Bible is
[49:33] fulfilled I believe with all my
[49:36] heart our precious brother William Mar
[49:39] brandham Willam BR was Malachi
[49:45] 456 once again the spirit of
[49:48] Elijah we know that God takes his
[49:52] man but not his
[49:54] spirit
[49:56] and that's the same with
[49:58] Satan now I want to read a sermon of
[50:00] brother
[50:02] Branham where brother Billy Paul and his
[50:05] uncle
[50:06] Donnie Billy Don saw the angel of the
[50:12] Lord or the pillar of
[50:15] fire now the sermon is found in uh
[50:23] 5082 titled the angel and and the
[50:27] commission the 20th
[50:34] paragraph and it
[50:37] reads then watch and see a patient
[50:40] standing here and right in there looks
[50:42] like a above them and I can see the
[50:45] things you hear him
[50:54] tell
[50:59] you've heard it been told of everything
[51:01] they done in their life is that
[51:07] right heard him even repeat the prayer
[51:10] over and and they said to to God isn't
[51:14] that
[51:20] right and all kinds of sins and things
[51:23] that they've done revealed it's perfect
[51:25] every time is that
[51:32] right never fails what does
[51:37] that I just talking just exactly what
[51:40] I'm seeking taking
[51:45] place just what I see that's what I
[51:49] say sometimes I look out over the
[51:54] audience I I can feel something
[51:57] pulling I watch real
[52:00] close then it cuts
[52:02] off it's somebody else on the other side
[52:05] is
[52:08] healed maybe this way and that
[52:12] way maybe I can be real quick real
[52:17] quiet and single out a certain
[52:21] person where it is first thing if I can
[52:24] get that Channel look like I get the
[52:27] rest of them somewhere
[52:37] else not to look you know looking on
[52:40] then it it'll start you can't see a
[52:43] vision rise up then and start like that
[52:52] then now when I looked and seen that
[52:55] I got down on the floor and started
[53:03] praying and as it got closer I knew it
[53:06] was it was the angel of
[53:10] God and I could feel what it
[53:13] was and I said what does the Lord want
[53:16] me to
[53:18] do never said a thing just just long
[53:21] time was standing right near the foot of
[53:24] the bed and and I was kneeling like
[53:33] this and I said oh Heavenly Father what
[53:37] have you sent your angel to your servant
[53:42] for and I said your servant is listening
[53:46] and I
[53:50] waited I knew it was still there but I
[53:52] didn't know
[53:54] why
[53:56] waited I guess five minutes
[54:00] passed I felt it moving closer to
[54:04] me and then it did I just heard that
[54:07] voice sound like way
[54:12] back I could not impersonate the voice
[54:14] if I had
[54:17] to but I heard it just as plain and
[54:20] Audible and audiable as my voice is to
[54:24] you
[54:30] said you're you're confining too much of
[54:32] that gift of healing to perform
[54:40] Miracles it will come to pass that
[54:42] people will not believe you unless
[54:44] there's a miracle
[54:50] performed I said I shall never do that
[54:52] again so help me God
[54:57] went out of the
[54:59] room I raised up I laid down on the
[55:03] bed and there was just above the bed M
[55:07] Milling
[55:11] around like a whole lot of colors in a
[55:14] rainbow Milling
[55:18] around and I looked at it and I laid
[55:22] there a little
[55:24] while
[55:26] I felt relief felt that my sin was
[55:28] forgiven
[55:31] me and I said does my Lord care if my
[55:34] little boy sees
[55:39] you nothing made any
[55:43] noise we had just twin
[55:46] bed we had to every place was taken up
[55:49] for miles around and my o on and we had
[55:53] twin beds in the room
[56:02] and my brother and my little boy was
[56:04] sleeping on the bed next to me the the
[56:07] twin
[56:13] bed and I said Billy Billy Billy Billy
[56:17] he didn't
[56:19] answer I said Donnie Don he didn't
[56:22] answer and I took a i took my
[56:26] pillow watching that and I Knew by not
[56:29] answering I knew it was all
[56:36] right never said
[56:39] yes and I threw my pillow like that and
[56:42] it hit my brother
[56:46] Donnie and I said Donnie he said
[56:52] yes and I said call Billy
[56:55] Billy Billy said oh or or Donnie said
[56:59] Billy your dad wants
[57:04] you just then I said Billy
[57:08] look he looked said what do you want
[57:11] [Music]
[57:13] Daddy about that time Donnie jumped out
[57:16] of bed out of the bed
[57:23] screaming Billy said Oh Daddy Daddy he
[57:26] jumped out of the bed and jumped over
[57:28] said don't let don't let that get me
[57:31] don't let that get me
[57:40] bil and I said honey that won't hurt
[57:45] you said many times I was single five
[57:52] years I've been father and mother mother
[57:55] both to
[57:59] him and just pack his little bottles of
[58:02] milk in my
[58:06] pocket and at night time lay it under my
[58:08] my head to keep it
[58:13] warm so I could give it to him at
[58:17] night his mother died when he was uh
[58:20] only 18 months
[58:23] old
[58:25] and I just had to raise him been both
[58:27] father and
[58:31] mother I said many times when I'm going
[58:34] to be uh specially flying he
[58:41] said Daddy I'm so afraid you're going to
[58:44] go away and never come back to me
[58:50] again I said no honey I I'll be
[58:53] back
[58:56] and I said now honey that's the reason
[58:58] Daddy's going daddy
[59:02] goes that the angel of the Lord that
[59:05] leads
[59:07] Daddy he was just in the room talking to
[59:12] me and I asked him if you could
[59:16] see so you won't worry about
[59:20] daddy and know that that's the angel
[59:23] that leads Daddy
[59:29] that's where that
[59:33] pillar was about like that mingling with
[59:39] colors and went
[59:41] on Donnie he didn't know hardly what to
[59:44] think my my other
[59:49] brother and then it milled around like
[59:52] that
[59:53] went
[1:00:01] then he
[1:00:03] told and I want you to get to you people
[1:00:06] something here that I believe that you
[1:00:08] people in Cleveland know
[1:00:18] this you know many of you gets the wrong
[1:00:20] conception of Divine
[1:00:23] Healing
[1:00:26] now this is not a gift to perform
[1:00:30] Miracles Miracles is a separate
[1:00:32] different gift from
[1:00:37] healing did you know that the Bible said
[1:00:40] do do all have the gift of
[1:00:46] healing do all have the gift of
[1:00:50] Miracles see but Miracles are
[1:00:53] performed
[1:00:55] that's right it's a miracle every time
[1:00:57] somebody a vision that happens and tells
[1:00:59] people what's wrong with
[1:01:06] them that's a miracle a
[1:01:11] supernatural that's a miracle but
[1:01:14] healing now look when when Isaiah went
[1:01:17] up to heal
[1:01:23] Hezekiah do you believe God sent him up
[1:01:26] there do you believe where after he told
[1:01:29] him he's going to
[1:01:34] die set his house in
[1:01:37] order well then when Isaiah went up and
[1:01:40] pronounced him to be healed it was even
[1:01:43] three days before Hezekiah regained
[1:01:44] enough strength to come down off his bed
[1:01:47] to go in the house of God to go
[1:01:53] worship
[1:02:12] okay just one minute
[1:02:19] minute so brother brandham goes on uh
[1:02:22] speaking about that this gift
[1:02:28] that it's not um operated at at his will
[1:02:34] like that he can't do what he pleases
[1:02:36] with
[1:02:38] it in other
[1:02:41] words that it's all it's all by um by by
[1:02:45] God's
[1:02:48] decision that he has no way of of um of
[1:02:52] controlling it
[1:02:56] in the way of wanting a um a vision for
[1:02:58] certain brother or
[1:03:02] sister or he's not at will to heal
[1:03:05] anybody he
[1:03:08] wants but it's what the Lord
[1:03:11] wants and as you guys know many people
[1:03:13] would come up to brother
[1:03:18] brandom practically demanding our
[1:03:20] precious
[1:03:23] brother
[1:03:25] to have a
[1:03:27] vision for their their very special
[1:03:30] precious uh family
[1:03:34] member was probably ill or
[1:03:38] dying and they would insist that he he'd
[1:03:41] have a vision for
[1:03:44] them and as we know he had no control
[1:03:47] over
[1:03:50] that it was a gift from
[1:03:53] God
[1:03:55] and a blessing to
[1:04:11] us all right as I find where I'm
[1:04:21] at and uh you can also find um when
[1:04:24] Billy Paul um seen the angel of the
[1:04:31] Lord uh and
[1:04:33] uh in
[1:04:38] expectations uh preached in
[1:04:44] 5174 in paragraph
[1:04:47] n if you'd like to go and uh read that
[1:04:50] for
[1:04:53] yourselves
[1:04:55] now uh we know that brother brandham and
[1:04:57] then uh his his brother
[1:05:05] Donnie um I meant to say uh brother
[1:05:09] brother Donnie and uh Billy Paul I'm
[1:05:12] sorry Billy Paul weren't the only ones
[1:05:14] to witness uh the pillar of
[1:05:19] Fire or the angel of the
[1:05:22] Lord but allowed it to be captured by
[1:05:28] photo after developed uh after the photo
[1:05:31] was developed as you
[1:05:36] know it wasn't a visual with the naked
[1:05:40] eye for
[1:05:44] all now that's one merciful
[1:05:48] god for this end
[1:05:51] time so if God Vindicated
[1:05:54] this
[1:05:56] prophet and he had thus sayth the
[1:06:00] Lord and God back them
[1:06:05] 110% then what shall be of those who
[1:06:07] refuse to accept this prophet in this
[1:06:09] end
[1:06:13] time I'd like to share one Prophecy from
[1:06:18] the um from one prophecy the Holy Spirit
[1:06:21] revealed to brother
[1:06:23] brandham
[1:06:27] which in which I believe is for this
[1:06:28] exact age in
[1:06:34] time uh dated in
[1:06:39] 6186 titled the 70 70th week of
[1:06:46] Daniel paragraph
[1:06:50] 207 and it reads as
[1:06:53] so now I predicted and have said I saw a
[1:06:56] great woman stand up beautiful looking
[1:06:59] dressed in real highly Royal like
[1:07:14] purple and I got little parentheses down
[1:07:19] here she was a great ruler in the United
[1:07:22] States perhaps the cathol
[1:07:28] Church a woman some woman I don't know
[1:07:31] it'll be the Catholic
[1:07:37] church I don't know I can't
[1:07:41] say only thing I seen I seen the woman
[1:07:44] that
[1:07:44] was I seen the woman that was
[1:07:50] all but this is the woman's Nation
[1:07:55] this nation is number 13 in
[1:08:00] Prophecy she's got 13 stripes 13
[1:08:06] stars she started 13
[1:08:10] colonies
[1:08:12] 13313 everything is
[1:08:15] 13 appears in the 13th chapter of
[1:08:18] Revelations
[1:08:22] even she is 13 and she is a woman
[1:08:30] nation and her name is uh Kamala D
[1:08:34] Harris isala de Harris during her
[1:08:42] inauguration as a vice president of the
[1:08:45] United
[1:08:47] States she was dressed in that exact
[1:08:52] description
[1:08:55] so we know that uh even after brother
[1:08:57] brandham has
[1:09:00] passed in
[1:09:04] 1965 that that prophecy he prophesied so
[1:09:07] long
[1:09:10] back I believe it might have been in
[1:09:15] 1933 don't quote me on
[1:09:19] that but um it has come to
[1:09:22] pass and that's for this exact
[1:09:28] time who who can deny this
[1:09:33] Prophet it's the truth and nothing but
[1:09:35] the
[1:09:37] truth sent from
[1:09:46] God and I heard another um sermon of
[1:09:49] brother
[1:09:52] branham's which I didn't find
[1:09:56] where he uh speaks about this uh woman
[1:09:58] vice
[1:10:02] president that he predicted or
[1:10:04] prophesized
[1:10:07] of he says right after um this uh
[1:10:12] Revelation comes comes to
[1:10:17] be or this
[1:10:19] prophecy that the destruction of the
[1:10:21] United States would come
[1:10:25] now we see the time we're living
[1:10:28] in I'd like to read more scriptures if I
[1:10:34] may uh Mark 13 verse 7 and
[1:10:52] 8 and as it reads
[1:10:57] you and when ye shall hear of wars and
[1:11:00] rumors of wars be ye not troubled for
[1:11:03] such things must needs be but the end
[1:11:07] shall not be
[1:11:16] yet for nation shall rise against nation
[1:11:19] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[1:11:21] shall be earthquakes in diverse places
[1:11:24] and there shall be famines and troubles
[1:11:27] there these are the beginnings of
[1:11:41] Sorrows amen amen does not that sound
[1:11:44] like the times we're living
[1:11:48] in let's go to St Luke chapter
[1:11:52] 17
[1:11:56] and verse 26 through
[1:12:08] 30 so that we can get a uh an eye view
[1:12:11] of where we stand uh in life right
[1:12:19] now am and uh as it reads
[1:12:26] and as it was in the days of Noah uh so
[1:12:30] shall it be also in the days of uh the
[1:12:32] son of
[1:12:36] man they did eat they drank they married
[1:12:39] wives they were given in marriage until
[1:12:42] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[1:12:45] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:12:52] all
[1:12:59] verse
[1:13:01] 28 likewise also as it was in the days
[1:13:04] of lot they did eat they drank they
[1:13:06] bought they sold they planted they
[1:13:16] build but the same day that lot went out
[1:13:19] of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone
[1:13:22] from Heaven and the destroyed them
[1:13:30] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:13:33] when the son of man is
[1:13:39] revealed amen let's go to uh St Luke
[1:13:42] chapter
[1:13:51] 21 verse 20-2
[1:13:58] 28 and it reads
[1:14:00] us
[1:14:02] see and when and when you shall see
[1:14:05] Jerusalem compassed with armies then
[1:14:09] know that the Desolation thereof is
[1:14:19] nigh then let them which are in Judea
[1:14:22] flee to the mountains and let them which
[1:14:24] are in the midst of it depart out and
[1:14:27] let not them that are in the countries
[1:14:30] enter
[1:14:40] therein for these be the days of
[1:14:43] Vengeance that all things which are
[1:14:45] written may be
[1:14:52] fulfilled but woe unto them that are
[1:14:55] with child and to them that give suck if
[1:14:58] in in those days for there shall be
[1:15:01] great distress in the land and wrath
[1:15:03] upon this upon this
[1:15:14] people and they shall fall by the edge
[1:15:17] of the sword and shall be led away
[1:15:19] captive into all nations and Jerusalem
[1:15:22] shall be be trotted down of the Gentiles
[1:15:25] until the times of Gentiles be
[1:15:36] fulfilled and there shall be signs in
[1:15:39] the Sun and in the moon and in the stars
[1:15:42] and upon the Earth the stress of nations
[1:15:44] with perplexity the Sea and the waves
[1:15:47] were
[1:15:52] roaring
[1:15:58] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[1:16:01] for looking after those things which are
[1:16:03] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:16:05] Heaven shall be
[1:16:16] shaken and then shall they see the son
[1:16:18] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[1:16:21] great
[1:16:22] Glory
[1:16:28] reading the last
[1:16:30] verse and when these things begin to
[1:16:33] come to pass and look up and lift up
[1:16:36] your heads for your Redemption draweth
[1:16:45] nigh amen
[1:16:47] amen now I believe with the the the wars
[1:16:51] and that going on on the other side of
[1:16:53] the
[1:16:57] world that much of this prophecy and and
[1:17:01] then these scriptures in the Bible
[1:17:06] here have come to
[1:17:08] pass and will come to
[1:17:13] pass no man knows the exact
[1:17:17] time when the father that are in
[1:17:21] heaven shall send forth his only
[1:17:23] begotten
[1:17:25] son our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:17:29] Christ if Jesus the son of
[1:17:32] God that shed his blood as our lamb on
[1:17:38] Calvary for our very sins and the
[1:17:43] worlds that only means that his
[1:17:47] blood is in our is on our very
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:52] hands
[1:17:54] we've all committed
[1:17:57] murder but you can be forgiven my
[1:17:59] precious brothers and
[1:18:03] sisters for that debt he
[1:18:06] paid that he did not
[1:18:09] owe because he loved you with no
[1:18:14] measure when you were in the worst
[1:18:16] condition of your
[1:18:19] life did you know right before he gave
[1:18:21] up the ghost on the cross
[1:18:27] and said it is
[1:18:28] finished it was so that you would
[1:18:31] know that every trial and heartache you
[1:18:34] would
[1:18:36] suffer every battle and
[1:18:39] addiction every sickness and
[1:18:43] affliction is a finished
[1:18:46] work because Jesus took your
[1:18:49] place you shall have what you need
[1:18:54] if I abide in
[1:18:56] you and you abide in
[1:18:59] me and my word ask what you
[1:19:03] may and it shall be given unto
[1:19:06] you
[1:19:08] Hallelujah if you can only
[1:19:12] believe all things are
[1:19:14] possible his grace is
[1:19:18] sufficient and his love is
[1:19:21] endless
[1:19:23] if he's identified as the sun in the
[1:19:25] solar
[1:19:28] system and the Lamb's wife or the bride
[1:19:31] of
[1:19:34] Christ is identified as the moon in the
[1:19:36] solar
[1:19:40] system and reflect in in which reflects
[1:19:43] the sun's
[1:19:46] reflection therefore shall we be
[1:19:51] Christlike and be the light of the
[1:19:54] world as he was when he walked the
[1:19:58] Earth in such a time as
[1:20:03] so I'd like to share with
[1:20:07] you a short Vision that the lord gave
[1:20:12] me during a a sleepless
[1:20:16] night of uh weeping and and uh speaking
[1:20:19] to my
[1:20:21] Lord
[1:20:24] the vision was a short
[1:20:28] Vision but it was uh as um as I
[1:20:31] explained to
[1:20:34] you I was standing against this wall
[1:20:40] here uh again I remember I was not
[1:20:45] sleeping and uh I was waiting for the
[1:20:48] song
[1:20:50] leader to direct me to come up
[1:20:56] and uh this was before I began to to
[1:20:58] help behind this
[1:21:02] Pulpit my uh precious brother
[1:21:05] Eli would practically beg me to go and
[1:21:11] help to take part uh in in the
[1:21:16] service and not just be an usher helping
[1:21:19] there behind the
[1:21:21] door
[1:21:23] and uh I believe it was uh my
[1:21:26] Lord asking me to partake
[1:21:30] more that he had a service for
[1:21:35] me for me to do more work for
[1:21:39] him for me to speak to his
[1:21:44] people and that's exactly what I'm
[1:21:49] doing as we see the the way the the time
[1:21:51] is around the world
[1:22:00] World excuse me I had to set a a Time
[1:22:03] watch time
[1:22:06] clock that's last time I was uh extended
[1:22:09] like uh 20
[1:22:14] minutes and I tried to put it on
[1:22:19] vibrate yeah but um as uh we move
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:25] on I ask uh each and every one of
[1:22:31] you do you believe you're at your post
[1:22:33] of
[1:22:36] Duty or have you left your post of
[1:22:40] Duty but don't you know that by serving
[1:22:43] man you serve
[1:22:49] God I believe uh there's many things
[1:22:52] that not not only this church can work
[1:22:57] on but many around the across the
[1:23:02] world for every church can use more
[1:23:07] love as we know love conquers
[1:23:11] all and if God is
[1:23:14] love then you know that love conquers
[1:23:17] all
[1:23:21] fear and it'll be the exact thing that
[1:23:24] takes us
[1:23:27] home for uh his word
[1:23:31] says that we should love one
[1:23:35] another for this is how the world will
[1:23:37] know you're my
[1:23:41] disciples and anybody with a little
[1:23:44] spiritual
[1:23:47] discernment knows when you're a put
[1:23:51] on as brother brother Brandon would
[1:23:55] say that the reason why we have weak
[1:24:01] pulpits is
[1:24:04] because we uh have um we have a uh uh
[1:24:11] ministers that don't speak the
[1:24:13] truth for many times they they're
[1:24:15] worried about their
[1:24:19] reputation worried about hurting our
[1:24:21] precious brothers and sisters
[1:24:26] but how could you expect the Potter to
[1:24:28] remold
[1:24:33] you without being broken down
[1:24:38] first for it's better to handle this
[1:24:42] now than when we're before the
[1:24:46] father because as we know it'll be too
[1:24:48] late
[1:24:51] then brother brandham also
[1:24:55] says that what the world calls
[1:25:00] great God calls
[1:25:04] foolish and what God calls
[1:25:07] great the world calls
[1:25:13] foolish now I believe that uh each and
[1:25:15] every one of
[1:25:17] us love the
[1:25:20] Lord that's why we come to church
[1:25:24] and I believe this church should be
[1:25:27] packed seeing the signs of the
[1:25:31] time we should be dying to our
[1:25:35] sins applying the shed blood of of our
[1:25:40] lamb that God sent for the sins of the
[1:25:46] world now if we can do
[1:25:49] that the bride of Christ
[1:25:54] I believe we'll be closer to going
[1:25:57] home for many of us uh um profess to be
[1:26:01] a
[1:26:04] bride but we continue to do the things
[1:26:06] that we shouldn't
[1:26:09] do and uh I always go back when I get a
[1:26:12] little
[1:26:15] weary as I spoke to you guys the last
[1:26:17] time on March
[1:26:21] 31st the still a still Small Voice came
[1:26:24] to
[1:26:25] me and it said through you I bring them
[1:26:28] in and even
[1:26:31] more that doesn't sound like something a
[1:26:34] man tells
[1:26:38] himself but brother brandham
[1:26:40] says that God will come to the man like
[1:26:44] that in his still Small
[1:26:47] Voice to give him ambition and
[1:26:51] purpose
[1:26:52] so that's my exact ammo when I come up
[1:26:58] here and that was not for
[1:27:01] you that still Small Voice was for
[1:27:04] me so that when I stand behind these
[1:27:10] pulpits I can I can trust in
[1:27:13] him that I can rely on his
[1:27:17] promises for if he said that he'd be
[1:27:19] with
[1:27:21] me and even in me until the end of the
[1:27:26] world then you know I'm not
[1:27:29] alone if he
[1:27:32] promised to never leave us nor forsake
[1:27:36] us then you know you're never
[1:27:40] alone you can be sitting here at these
[1:27:42] pubes on your
[1:27:45] own and know that you're not
[1:27:48] alone God has your position in in the
[1:27:51] body of Christ
[1:27:55] many times we'll feel as a
[1:28:01] penny as they describe
[1:28:05] lot or some may may uh uh feel as as a
[1:28:09] as a silver dollar like
[1:28:13] Abraham but let me remind
[1:28:16] you that even that
[1:28:19] penny has its position in the body of
[1:28:21] Christ
[1:28:24] CHR and for a brother or sister that are
[1:28:27] precious to
[1:28:30] me that doesn't take part in the
[1:28:35] service that that uh comes and and
[1:28:38] honors and Praises our
[1:28:41] lord I can't call them a bench
[1:28:47] warmer because if the stars were made to
[1:28:49] worship
[1:28:51] God
[1:28:53] so is that precious brother and
[1:28:56] sister who are we to call them
[1:29:02] Benchwarmers we need to hold our tongues
[1:29:04] many
[1:29:06] times we speak out of
[1:29:10] hand or in better terms we get out of
[1:29:15] order but by your very actions that you
[1:29:18] live
[1:29:20] by
[1:29:22] it shows your
[1:29:24] belief for if you say Amen to a
[1:29:29] scripture but yet for example you still
[1:29:32] keep cutting your
[1:29:35] hair obviously my precious
[1:29:39] sisters and that speaks louder than
[1:29:44] words is that a hypocritical
[1:29:48] condition with all the respect it is
[1:29:54] and as I take my
[1:29:56] stand I won't be a weak
[1:30:00] Pulpit I'll stand for the word of
[1:30:04] God if garments pertain to a
[1:30:08] man and a woman wears
[1:30:10] them you are an
[1:30:13] abomination in the sight of the
[1:30:16] Lord and as I follow the
[1:30:20] lord I ask that you follow
[1:30:22] me because I'm serving
[1:30:25] him I'm at my post of
[1:30:29] Duty and he's working with me as he's
[1:30:33] working with
[1:30:34] you we're all God's work in
[1:30:38] progress no man is
[1:30:41] perfect whether they've seen the
[1:30:44] world or been in the
[1:30:46] world have done
[1:30:49] drugs have been alcoholic
[1:30:53] or they've never
[1:30:55] been it only
[1:30:58] means as one of my my favorite parables
[1:31:00] in the
[1:31:03] Bible where where Jesus uh speaks about
[1:31:05] the
[1:31:09] Creditor if if if a um a creditor
[1:31:12] forgives one that owes
[1:31:17] 500 and forgives another for
[1:31:20] 50
[1:31:23] which one loves him
[1:31:25] more the one that was forgiven for
[1:31:30] more so after all my filth and and
[1:31:32] perversion that I was in the
[1:31:37] world in the pathetic condition I was
[1:31:41] in it only tells me I love the Lord
[1:31:46] more more than the man that's never seen
[1:31:49] the
[1:31:50] world that's never picked up a can of
[1:31:56] beer because he's forgiven me for
[1:32:00] more and just as that 99 that he
[1:32:05] left he came for the lost
[1:32:08] sheep for each one of
[1:32:11] us because not only have many of us
[1:32:16] Sinn but we were born in by sexual
[1:32:20] desire
[1:32:22] automatically throwing us under
[1:32:26] that so I I I feel that no man sh shall
[1:32:29] shall um shall be a uh as as in a a
[1:32:35] state of glorifying
[1:32:41] themselves or feeling that they're more
[1:32:43] worthy than
[1:32:47] another I believe that the bride of
[1:32:50] Christ is not going to going to um uh
[1:32:53] have a uh different uh see different
[1:32:56] qualities in in brothers or
[1:33:00] sisters that that they'll be able to sit
[1:33:03] with a a a poor man that comes off the
[1:33:10] street that you won't look at him up and
[1:33:14] down like he's
[1:33:17] filth cuz at one point your heart and
[1:33:19] your condition was in the same way
[1:33:27] in a pathetic
[1:33:29] condition but God has touched
[1:33:32] you and I I tell you right
[1:33:35] now if uh you're seeking more of the
[1:33:40] Lord you must cry out to
[1:33:43] him you see the signs of the
[1:33:46] end and yes we know that man don't know
[1:33:49] the
[1:33:50] time
[1:33:52] nor does Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ but we know that
[1:33:57] today we're one day
[1:34:00] closer and if we're still living in that
[1:34:02] pathetic
[1:34:05] condition doing those things that we
[1:34:08] shouldn't
[1:34:10] be watching those things that we
[1:34:12] shouldn't be
[1:34:14] watching and we profess to be the bride
[1:34:17] of
[1:34:18] Christ I believe you're holding back the
[1:34:20] bus
[1:34:25] it's time to wake
[1:34:28] up discern the signs of the
[1:34:33] end for we can discern the face of the
[1:34:40] sky but not the
[1:34:43] end Jesus calls him
[1:34:48] Hypocrites the bride of Christ is not a
[1:34:50] hypocritical person um
[1:34:58] people let's um stand so we can get to
[1:35:06] closing the musicians May U come
[1:35:12] forth bow your heads and uh close your
[1:35:15] eyes
