[39:27] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:29] Christ amen
[39:33] amen let's go to the Book of
[39:37] Esther uh chapter
[39:41] 2 we're going to read from verse 5 to
[39:55] 7 if you can say Amen when you have
[40:10] it now in suan the The Palace there was
[40:14] a certain Jew whose name was morai the
[40:16] son of jaier the son of shm and the son
[40:20] of k a
[40:25] benjamite
[40:33] who had been carried away from Jerusalem
[40:35] with a captivity which had been carried
[40:37] away with Janiah king of Judah whom
[40:40] Nebuchadnezzar the king of babyon had
[40:42] carried
[40:52] [Music]
[40:55] away
[40:59] and he brought up hadassa that is Esther
[41:02] his uncle's daughter for she had neither
[41:04] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[41:07] and beautiful whom morai when her father
[41:09] and mother were dead took for his own
[41:14] daughter may the Lord bless the reading
[41:16] of his word you may be
[41:18] seated we also want to give thanks to
[41:20] the
[41:25] musicians
[41:28] before
[41:30] beginning I'd like to comment that once
[41:34] again Marcos and I have the same suit
[41:44] on this evening I want to speak about
[41:49] Esther from a little bit of a different
[41:55] way
[41:57] uh here talking about Esther about how
[41:59] she was an
[42:03] orphan and ever since she was a
[42:05] child if I could say it like
[42:08] that uh she had the
[42:12] trauma or the negative
[42:16] experience of losing both her mother and
[42:18] her
[42:20] father we know that
[42:25] death
[42:26] can cause a very strong impact in a
[42:28] person's
[42:34] life and the way that I want to take
[42:41] this and Esther was raised by a man
[42:43] whose name was
[42:46] Mori but it says that it was the son of
[42:49] his uncle the the daughter of his
[42:51] uncle so in other words they were
[42:55] cousins
[42:58] but Mori believed he was older than she
[43:03] was so he was like an uncle figure for
[43:11] her so then with Mori if you read the
[43:13] book of
[43:16] Esther he did a great job raising
[43:20] Esther but nonetheless she had the
[43:24] trauma of losing both mother and
[43:28] father we know that every human
[43:31] being without an exception of
[43:35] anybody everyone in their
[43:38] lives they go through a
[43:40] trauma or some
[43:43] abuse or some negative experience in
[43:52] life and the trauma of this young lady
[43:56] is that she lost her
[44:02] parents now typically when you're a
[44:05] child that's when you're
[44:09] growing your character is starting to
[44:13] form and once you're older it's harder
[44:15] to change the way that you
[44:19] are someone can receive trauma at any
[44:21] moment in their
[44:25] life
[44:26] but the moment where it can affect
[44:29] you and impact you for your whole
[44:33] life it's when you're young or when
[44:36] you're a
[44:41] child Satan hates the sons of
[44:46] God and that's why he attacks
[44:51] them Esther was a
[44:54] woman if you read the book of
[44:59] Esther because the queen was disobedient
[45:01] To The
[45:03] King The King cast her out of the
[45:07] Kingdom therefore he was searching for a
[45:09] new
[45:12] Queen so throughout the whole Kingdom he
[45:14] searched through all
[45:16] women to bring them to the
[45:20] Palace so they can be presented to the
[45:24] king and he could choose the one that he
[45:28] wanted we know that the king chose
[45:32] Esther and the Bible says that this
[45:36] King he loved Esther above all the women
[45:39] of the
[45:45] Kingdom now if you truly pay attention
[45:47] to the Book of
[45:50] Esther Esther was a woman that was a
[45:52] part of the
[45:53] Kingdom she had a very special position
[45:57] she was the
[45:58] queen but
[46:00] nonetheless she had her
[46:03] enemy in the same
[46:07] Kingdom that that enemy his name was
[46:12] hmon being that she was a
[46:18] Jew and Jews weren't really accepted in
[46:20] the
[46:23] Kingdom she had to change her name
[46:26] to a new name which was
[46:29] Esther before it was
[46:32] hadasa and then changed unto
[46:38] Esther and in searching the the the
[46:40] meaning of the name
[46:43] Esther one of the meanings is that it's
[46:45] a
[46:47] secret it's something
[46:49] hidden and it also means a
[46:54] star
[46:56] now we know that changing a
[46:58] bit before the foundation of the
[47:01] world there was a war in
[47:05] heaven between
[47:08] Satan and his name back then was
[47:11] Lucifer and it was against
[47:15] Michael brother Brown says in the
[47:17] message questions and
[47:21] answers Satan was the original Archangel
[47:23] of
[47:24] God
[47:26] he once dwelt in
[47:31] heaven he was once the greatest person
[47:33] in the heavens outside of
[47:37] God he was God's right-and man to
[47:42] Fellowship but he got puffed up in his
[47:47] heart
[47:48] Satan he had a
[47:52] complex he was almost like God
[47:57] though he had many wonderful
[48:01] qualities but he was not
[48:06] God therefore there was a complex that
[48:08] came from
[48:11] him that he went against
[48:14] God and against
[48:16] Michael what he
[48:19] did he went to Michael's
[48:22] Kingdom and he created his own kingdom
[48:24] there
[48:27] he tried to
[48:30] persuade that the Angels instead of
[48:32] worshiping God would worship
[48:36] him all of that was because of a
[48:39] complex he was almost like God but he
[48:43] was
[48:44] not and the the only one that was
[48:47] worshiped was
[48:49] God and he wanted
[48:53] worship sometimes a complex
[48:59] can cause you to have a jealousy towards
[49:03] someone and that Envy can carry you to
[49:06] hate that
[49:08] hate can make you attack the other
[49:12] person that's what happened with
[49:15] Satan it was just a
[49:18] complex he was almost like
[49:21] God but it was not
[49:23] him and hmon
[49:27] in the Kingdom of this
[49:30] King he was the right hand man of the
[49:34] king he was almost like the
[49:37] king he wanted to be worshiped like the
[49:40] king but he was not the
[49:45] king so you can see what happens in the
[49:48] story of
[49:49] Esther it's just a
[49:52] repetition or a
[49:54] continuation of what happened there in
[49:58] heaven in a single
[50:00] Kingdom there were two
[50:03] oppositions both wanted
[50:07] worship one by by right deserved it
[50:11] because he was King he was
[50:14] God and the other one who was the right
[50:18] hand and he had jealousy of what the
[50:20] other person
[50:23] had so he conspired against that
[50:26] Kingdom to receive that which he
[50:29] wanted and that's because of a
[50:32] complex that he was almost like
[50:39] God brother brandom says in the message
[50:41] the Seal of the
[50:44] Antichrist and forgive me that I don't
[50:46] have the quotes on the
[50:49] screen I didn't have the time to to do
[50:51] the the the
[50:54] screen
[50:56] or the slides but if you want the quotes
[50:58] I can give them to you
[51:00] gladly brother B says in the message the
[51:02] Seal of the
[51:07] Antichrist did you know that in heaven
[51:09] the devil was God's rightand man in the
[51:14] beginning that Lucifer the son of the
[51:16] morning was given
[51:22] power and the reason he brought sin into
[51:25] the world he was able to take something
[51:27] that God had
[51:31] created and pervert it back into an evil
[51:33] thing which back into an evil thing
[51:36] which started trouble in the
[51:44] beginning then God before the foundation
[51:47] of the world was ever
[51:52] laid when he seen what Satan done
[51:57] in his pride he went to the
[52:00] north and set up his
[52:04] kingdom fought against Michael and his
[52:06] angels do you see
[52:10] it lufer was the right-hand man of
[52:12] almighty
[52:14] God the son of the morning the
[52:20] first God granted him almost co-workers
[52:22] with
[52:24] him
[52:26] he was a coworker partially equal with
[52:30] him only Satan could not
[52:34] create God is the only
[52:41] Creator but God but Satan took something
[52:44] that God created and perverted it back
[52:46] to something else
[52:48] evil every
[52:52] person every person is born with certain
[52:54] pecul
[52:55] arities
[52:58] qualities by Nature a
[53:02] nature and
[53:07] mainly a person isn't conformed with
[53:10] that which they
[53:14] have they see a person that has
[53:16] something that they
[53:19] desire and a complex starts to come out
[53:21] of
[53:23] them that can produce an
[53:26] [Music]
[53:30] and can cause a negative reaction in the
[53:33] person you might you'd hate that
[53:36] person you hate
[53:39] yourself because of not having that
[53:43] thing and just simply it's a
[53:48] complex it's the same thing that
[53:50] happened to
[53:51] Satan it's the same thing that can
[53:53] happen to you a
[53:58] complex can cause so much destruction to
[54:01] you in your
[54:03] life it happened with the devil and it
[54:06] happened with
[54:08] hmon hmon wanted something that he
[54:10] didn't
[54:13] have in Isaiah
[54:16] 14 when it uh speaks of the
[54:19] devil verse
[54:24] 12
[54:28] how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[54:30] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[54:32] cut down to the ground which did US
[54:34] weaken the
[54:46] Nations for thou has said in thine heart
[54:48] I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt
[54:51] my throne above the stars of God I will
[54:53] sit also upon the Mount of the
[54:55] congregation in the sides of the
[55:01] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[55:03] the clouds I will be like the most
[55:07] high it's something
[55:11] interesting Satan wanted to be as go
[55:14] like
[55:16] God and it was a complex that took him
[55:18] to his
[55:21] destruction caused him to be kicked out
[55:23] of heaven
[55:26] but when it's about
[55:28] us God wants us to be like
[55:32] him and Satan can
[55:36] see you can be like
[55:40] God that complex is born again that he
[55:43] had in the
[55:45] beginning and he's jealous of you that's
[55:49] why he hates you and he attacks you
[55:54] because you
[55:55] have
[55:57] something that he could never
[56:01] have you can be like
[56:10] God in the message the greatest battle
[56:12] ever
[56:15] fought brother BR says this great first
[56:18] battle that was ever
[56:19] fought begin in
[56:23] heaven when Michael and his angels
[56:26] fought against Lucifer and his
[56:30] angels it was first started the first
[56:32] battle was in
[56:37] heaven so sin did not originate on Earth
[56:39] it originated in
[56:41] heaven and then it was thrown down from
[56:44] heaven cast out of Heaven to the
[56:48] Earth and it fell upon human
[56:52] beings then the battle from angels
[56:56] became human
[57:00] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[57:05] creation what God had created for
[57:08] himself he
[57:11] Satan come to destroy
[57:14] this that was his
[57:17] purpose was to destroy
[57:20] it then the battle began here on Earth
[57:25] and began in
[57:27] us and has been raging ever
[57:33] since Satan is jealous of
[57:36] you there's something you've
[57:40] got that he cannot have that's why he
[57:45] hates
[57:46] you and he attacks you he wants to
[57:49] destroy
[57:50] you because he wanted to be like
[57:53] God he wanted to to be worshiped he
[57:56] wanted to be king and the Bible
[57:59] says that we were
[58:02] called to be Kings and
[58:07] Priests we share God's
[58:11] glory the glory that he could not
[58:14] have you've got it in your
[58:16] heart that's the Holy
[58:21] Spirit a
[58:23] complex if you've got a
[58:26] complex and you don't recognize you've
[58:29] got a
[58:30] complex it can destroy
[58:32] others and it can destroy
[58:36] you all of
[58:39] us everyone can have a
[58:43] complex I'm the first to admit I have
[58:45] many
[58:47] complexes but the key
[58:50] is to recognize what is the
[58:53] complex and not allow for my complex to
[58:57] control
[59:02] me there's times that my
[59:05] complexes they crash with
[59:08] God there's things that God asks of
[59:11] me he requires of
[59:13] me but because of my
[59:17] complex I have an imaginary barrier in
[59:20] front of
[59:22] me I can't get to that point
[59:26] because my complex doesn't allow it it
[59:29] is something
[59:32] imaginary it's the same thing that can
[59:34] happen to
[59:36] you you in your growth in your Christian
[59:41] Life you can be
[59:44] paralyzed because of a
[59:47] complex you can't Advance
[59:51] anymore because of something you've got
[59:54] that happened to you in the
[59:59] past and if the devil knows what your
[1:00:01] complex
[1:00:03] is if he's able to provoke
[1:00:06] it he can make you detain
[1:00:09] yourself not
[1:00:12] progress or go back to the way you used
[1:00:15] to
[1:00:16] be a complex can cause
[1:00:22] this the complex of the devil
[1:00:26] he wanted to be like
[1:00:27] God he wanted to be
[1:00:30] worshiped that same
[1:00:32] complex those same
[1:00:35] struggles they've gone on to the human
[1:00:38] race and hmon he had that
[1:00:43] complex remember Lucifer was the right
[1:00:45] hand man of God in
[1:00:48] heaven now in Esther
[1:00:53] 31
[1:01:03] after these things did K did King aerus
[1:01:07] promote hmon the son of hamadaa and
[1:01:10] agagite and advanced him and set his
[1:01:12] seat above all the princes that were
[1:01:14] with
[1:01:19] him you can see that the king gave him a
[1:01:21] certain position that was Above the Rest
[1:01:26] but inferior to that of the king and
[1:01:30] Lucifer was God's right
[1:01:33] hand Superior to everyone
[1:01:36] else but inferior to
[1:01:41] God but because of this position that
[1:01:44] hmon
[1:01:45] had in verse two it
[1:01:53] says
[1:01:59] and all the king's servants that were in
[1:02:01] the king's gate bowed and reverenced
[1:02:03] hmon for the king had so commanded
[1:02:05] concerning him but morai bowed not nor
[1:02:08] did he reverence
[1:02:11] M Mori placed
[1:02:16] resistance against Hon's
[1:02:18] desire just like Michael and his
[1:02:23] angels
[1:02:25] They didn't accept what Lucifer wanted
[1:02:26] there in
[1:02:30] heaven it's a repetition of the same
[1:02:33] story it's not just the story of a
[1:02:36] king that married a
[1:02:40] woman that has this man hmon at his
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:44] hand it's something that began back
[1:02:47] there it happened with
[1:02:50] Esther and it happens to you
[1:02:53] today you are
[1:02:56] Esther you're a part of God's
[1:03:01] kingdom and you're going to have to
[1:03:03] confront hmon the
[1:03:13] devil in Esther
[1:03:15] 6 before reading
[1:03:18] it
[1:03:21] Mori if you read the book of Esther
[1:03:28] he would always be outside the gates of
[1:03:30] the
[1:03:32] palace in one occasion he saw he heard
[1:03:35] two
[1:03:39] men they were servants to the
[1:03:42] Palace I believe they were going to kill
[1:03:44] the
[1:03:46] king they were conspiring a plan to kill
[1:03:49] the
[1:03:50] king Mori then heard
[1:03:52] this and he warned
[1:03:55] Esther and Esther saved the
[1:04:00] king and so then from this event what
[1:04:04] happened it was registered in the in the
[1:04:06] the books of the
[1:04:10] king and now in Esther
[1:04:21] 61 on the night on that night could not
[1:04:24] the king's sleep and he commanded to
[1:04:26] bring the book of records ofon of The
[1:04:28] Chronicles and they were read before the
[1:04:42] king and it was found written that morai
[1:04:46] morai had told of ban and teresh two of
[1:04:50] the king's chamberlains the keepers of
[1:04:51] the door who sought to lay hand on the
[1:04:53] king
[1:05:04] aerus the king said what honor and
[1:05:07] dignity had be done to had been done to
[1:05:09] Mori for this then said the king's
[1:05:11] servants that ministered unto him
[1:05:13] there's nothing done for
[1:05:23] him
[1:05:29] and the King said who is in the court
[1:05:31] now hmon was come into an into the
[1:05:33] outward Court of the King's house to
[1:05:35] speak unto the king to hang morai on The
[1:05:38] Gallows that he had prepared for
[1:05:41] him while the king wanted to reward
[1:05:44] morai
[1:05:46] hmon tried to kill
[1:05:50] Mori verse
[1:05:53] five
[1:05:58] and the King's servant said unto him
[1:05:59] behold hmon standeth in the court and
[1:06:01] the King said let him come
[1:06:13] in so hmon came in and the King said
[1:06:16] unto him what shall be done unto the man
[1:06:19] whom the king delighteth to honor now
[1:06:21] hmon thought in his heart to whom the
[1:06:23] king Delight to honor more than to
[1:06:29] myself so hmon can see that the king
[1:06:31] wants to honor a
[1:06:34] man he thinks that the man is
[1:06:38] himself so
[1:06:41] then he says that in his it says that in
[1:06:44] his heart he thought
[1:06:47] this just like in Isaiah says that
[1:06:49] Lucifer thought in his
[1:06:53] heart
[1:06:55] verse
[1:06:59] seven and hmon answered the king for the
[1:07:02] man whom the king delighteth to
[1:07:13] honor let the Royal apparel be brought
[1:07:16] which the king useth to wear and the
[1:07:18] horse that the king rideth upon and the
[1:07:20] Crown Royal which is set upon his
[1:07:22] head
[1:07:26] all these things were things that
[1:07:27] belonged to the
[1:07:29] king these were things that he wanted
[1:07:32] for
[1:07:36] himself then verse n
[1:07:52] says
[1:07:55] and let this appal and horse be
[1:07:57] delivered to the hand of one of the
[1:07:59] king's most noble princes that they may
[1:08:01] array the man with all whom the king
[1:08:03] delighteth to honor and bring him on a
[1:08:05] horseback through the streets of the
[1:08:07] city and Proclaim before him thus shall
[1:08:09] it be done to the man whom the king
[1:08:11] delighted to
[1:08:22] honor
[1:08:26] then the king said to hmon make haste
[1:08:28] and take the apparel and the horse as
[1:08:30] thou has said and do even so to Mori the
[1:08:33] Jew that sth at the king's gate let
[1:08:36] nothing fail of all that thou Hast
[1:08:40] spoken Hon's
[1:08:43] complex was Lucifer's
[1:08:47] complex he wanted to be like the
[1:08:49] greatest
[1:08:50] man he wanted everyone to worship Him
[1:08:55] and since he thought that honor was
[1:08:56] going to be for
[1:08:58] himself he said all the things that he
[1:09:02] wanted but it was not for
[1:09:04] hmon it was for
[1:09:10] Mori that complex once again arised in
[1:09:14] him he wanted to be like
[1:09:16] God but he couldn't receive
[1:09:19] it and he it was another
[1:09:22] person that received what he
[1:09:26] wanted if you're not
[1:09:28] careful the same thing can happen to
[1:09:31] you God to
[1:09:34] everyone has formed you in a certain
[1:09:37] way with certain
[1:09:39] things and without certain
[1:09:42] things and if you're not
[1:09:47] careful you can have jealousy towards
[1:09:49] someone
[1:09:50] else so
[1:09:52] therefore you'll hate that
[1:09:55] person or you'll hate
[1:09:57] yourself for not having
[1:10:01] that because it's a simple
[1:10:15] complex brother Brown says in the
[1:10:17] message questions and answers number
[1:10:22] four preached on the 30th of August of
[1:10:26] 1964 they ask him the
[1:10:36] question when a person realizes he has
[1:10:38] an inferior complex or some sort of
[1:10:41] complex how may he overcome
[1:10:46] this he said uh uh do the
[1:10:52] opposite if you're always waiting your
[1:10:58] way and that one little brat wants to
[1:11:01] always have everything your
[1:11:06] way turn right back around and give
[1:11:08] everything you've got in the other
[1:11:11] way if you're
[1:11:13] selfish and you want to hold
[1:11:17] everything then start giving away what
[1:11:19] you've
[1:11:22] got
[1:11:24] see do whatever just go the vice
[1:11:31] versa that's the way to overcome
[1:11:33] anything it's an
[1:11:37] antidote so then what happened to Satan
[1:11:41] it was a
[1:11:42] complex he saw something that he
[1:11:46] wanted and he wanted to get it for
[1:11:48] himself he didn't want
[1:11:50] it and someone else received it
[1:11:56] the same thing can happen to
[1:11:59] anybody and it can be a simple
[1:12:05] complex
[1:12:07] everyone I dare to say everyone if not
[1:12:10] the
[1:12:11] majority we've got
[1:12:18] complexes and the majority of
[1:12:21] complexes can originate
[1:12:24] from something of your
[1:12:28] childhood when I was
[1:12:31] born I was born a certain day a certain
[1:12:35] month and I was born a certain
[1:12:39] way by Nature I'm an
[1:12:43] introvert I don't like people to look at
[1:12:47] me I don't like to be
[1:12:50] photographed I don't like people to
[1:12:52] record me
[1:12:54] I don't know
[1:12:56] why until one day I spoke to my
[1:12:59] mother and she told me that my
[1:13:01] grandfather was just the
[1:13:04] same oh my my
[1:13:10] grandmother I don't like people to give
[1:13:12] me a lot of
[1:13:15] attention but
[1:13:17] nonetheless God called
[1:13:19] me to
[1:13:22] minister
[1:13:24] to
[1:13:26] interpret I don't like
[1:13:30] it and because of
[1:13:34] that I I put a lot of resistance toward
[1:13:39] God every person has their own
[1:13:45] complex once one day I took a course of
[1:13:48] uh medical
[1:13:51] interpreting and the teacher
[1:13:54] she said there's two types of
[1:13:56] people interpr there's
[1:13:59] interpreters that are
[1:14:02] extroverts that they like to talk to
[1:14:05] everybody they can talk all day
[1:14:08] long and then there's interpreters or
[1:14:13] translators that those they are
[1:14:16] introverts they'd rather be
[1:14:19] alone in front of a
[1:14:21] computer with the dictionary
[1:14:24] and studying
[1:14:26] words in that moment I
[1:14:28] noticed that I'm a
[1:14:32] translator but God called me to be an
[1:14:35] interpreter I've got to use my
[1:14:37] voice but my
[1:14:42] complex placed resistance on
[1:14:46] God because I don't like people to look
[1:14:48] at
[1:14:50] me I don't like for cameras to be
[1:14:52] recording me
[1:14:54] I I I think that I look bad I said
[1:14:57] something
[1:14:58] incorrect it's a
[1:15:01] complex that God had to help me to
[1:15:09] overcome your
[1:15:11] complexes they can impede
[1:15:14] you to serve
[1:15:18] God God can call you for a certain
[1:15:21] thing but because you've got a
[1:15:26] you put these B imaginary
[1:15:28] borders you say I can't do
[1:15:31] that Moses did the same
[1:15:35] thing go to Egypt and deliver my people
[1:15:39] well I can't do
[1:15:40] it I
[1:15:45] stutter
[1:15:48] complexes can impede
[1:15:50] you from serving God
[1:15:54] and grow in your Christian
[1:15:58] life I've myself I've caused my own self
[1:16:03] harm there's no
[1:16:05] person that's harmed me more than
[1:16:12] myself the person that I struggle with
[1:16:14] the
[1:16:16] most the person that displeases me the
[1:16:19] most is
[1:16:22] myself
[1:16:24] because I recognize the complexes that I
[1:16:28] carry and I don't want to overcome my
[1:16:32] complexes they're very Comfort
[1:16:35] comfortable they protect me from the
[1:16:39] humiliation that people can criticize me
[1:16:42] people can make fun of me a
[1:16:46] complex can make a
[1:16:49] person distance themselves from
[1:16:51] everyone and and hide
[1:16:54] somewhere to be
[1:16:57] free from
[1:16:59] criticism and
[1:17:01] humiliation of other
[1:17:03] people a complex can cause
[1:17:08] this and I've got that
[1:17:12] complex when I was a little
[1:17:16] boy I thought well I was just a normal
[1:17:19] child but once I got to school
[1:17:23] I noticed I wasn't a normal
[1:17:27] kid at school ever since I was a young
[1:17:30] boy and even in Sunday
[1:17:33] school people would make fun of
[1:17:37] me people would always say I'm so
[1:17:43] quiet they'd say oh Emanuel just shut up
[1:17:45] you make so much
[1:17:49] noise others would say you need to speak
[1:17:52] up once a
[1:17:56] brother he doesn't know that this
[1:17:58] affected me in a negative
[1:18:01] way but I allowed it to affect me in a
[1:18:03] negative
[1:18:05] way my my face also doesn't help
[1:18:08] me because it looks like I'm angry or so
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:15] serious once I'm walking getting close
[1:18:17] to a
[1:18:19] brother and he points to the
[1:18:21] ground
[1:18:24] and I looked to see if something was on
[1:18:25] the
[1:18:27] ground and he said oh your smile fell on
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:33] ground and to not offend the
[1:18:37] brother and I just faked my
[1:18:41] smile but honestly that offended me and
[1:18:44] it bothered me so much that he said
[1:18:46] that but it wasn't his fault but it was
[1:18:49] my
[1:18:51] fault I allowed that
[1:18:54] complex to to dominate me but I
[1:18:58] recognized
[1:18:59] it so I forgave
[1:19:02] him but if I had not forgiven
[1:19:07] him that complex would have taken me to
[1:19:11] hatred towards that
[1:19:14] person that's one of the most loving
[1:19:16] people I
[1:19:18] know but a
[1:19:20] complex can destroy you
[1:19:23] can destroy
[1:19:25] yourself if you allow
[1:19:34] it uh some months
[1:19:38] ago I went to visit another
[1:19:41] church and at that church a friend of
[1:19:43] mine
[1:19:45] preached so after service was
[1:19:48] over I went with my
[1:19:51] friend and all the everyone came to go
[1:19:53] talk to
[1:19:55] him they really enjoyed what he
[1:19:59] preached and since I'm an
[1:20:02] introvert it's my
[1:20:06] nature I was just standing there
[1:20:07] listening to everybody
[1:20:10] else they had the desire to go and talk
[1:20:12] to
[1:20:15] him and with much pleasure I was just
[1:20:17] quietly
[1:20:19] listening but since I've got such a
[1:20:21] serious face
[1:20:23] a brother
[1:20:25] came and he started talking talking
[1:20:28] talking at the
[1:20:31] end he he's saying yes brother he was
[1:20:33] telling my
[1:20:34] friend the only thing I don't
[1:20:38] understand why do they have a security
[1:20:40] guard standing here and he was talking
[1:20:43] about
[1:20:48] me and it took me a second to catch what
[1:20:50] he was talking about
[1:20:53] I've got a serious face I'm all
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] quiet I said no I'm just listening and
[1:21:01] I'm just enjoying what you guys are
[1:21:02] talking
[1:21:05] about then we went to a restaurant to go
[1:21:10] eat and it so happened that I had to sit
[1:21:12] next to that same
[1:21:14] brother and that brother I had him right
[1:21:16] here on my
[1:21:19] side and he's such a talkative person
[1:21:22] but I'm
[1:21:25] not and he's over talking and talking
[1:21:27] and
[1:21:29] talking and once again mentions how I'm
[1:21:31] so
[1:21:34] quiet he keeps talking talking
[1:21:38] talking until finally he touches my arm
[1:21:42] and he starts
[1:21:44] poking like as if they were
[1:21:49] buttons I'm just looking for the volume
[1:21:52] button on this young
[1:21:57] man and it seems so
[1:22:00] insignificant that shouldn't affect
[1:22:04] me but what he
[1:22:09] did it provoked a complex that I had in
[1:22:12] my
[1:22:13] childhood to to to arise in
[1:22:17] me I felt
[1:22:19] uncomfortable I felt
[1:22:21] bad
[1:22:24] that I made him feel
[1:22:26] bad because I'm not interesting enough
[1:22:29] for
[1:22:30] him I can't start a
[1:22:34] conversation so then what I did I went
[1:22:37] to the
[1:22:38] restroom I stayed there for about five
[1:22:42] minutes until I gained my
[1:22:45] composure and then I decided to
[1:22:48] leave I dismissed myself from the
[1:22:50] brothers and then I
[1:22:51] left
[1:22:54] and those days were just horrible days
[1:22:56] for me why because of a
[1:23:00] complex of my
[1:23:05] childhood I didn't understand what
[1:23:07] happened to
[1:23:10] me for me it was something just so
[1:23:13] insignificant the reaction that I
[1:23:16] had it was like that of a
[1:23:19] child I shouldn't have even done that
[1:23:22] but it affected
[1:23:25] me the following
[1:23:29] day honestly I didn't even want to
[1:23:31] study but I wanted to listen to
[1:23:36] something so then I pushed play on this
[1:23:38] life story of brother
[1:23:41] brandom and brother Bram was talking
[1:23:43] about his own
[1:23:44] childhood when he was a
[1:23:48] child uh his father used to uh make
[1:23:51] alcohol
[1:23:56] and on one occasion his father was with
[1:23:57] a
[1:23:58] friend and then he's there with brother
[1:24:00] brandham he's about eight or nine years
[1:24:05] old and the that friend brings out a
[1:24:07] bottle of alcohol he gives it to the
[1:24:11] father and is also and also offers it to
[1:24:13] brother
[1:24:14] brandom but years
[1:24:17] before that Whirlwind in the in the
[1:24:20] tree had told Brother brandom don't
[1:24:24] smoke Don't
[1:24:26] drink don't defile your body in any
[1:24:30] way but in offering him that
[1:24:33] drink he said no
[1:24:37] but the friend the friend and his
[1:24:41] father they made fun of brother
[1:24:44] brandham and they called him a
[1:24:49] and since he didn't want to be a
[1:24:54] he was going to take that
[1:24:58] drink at that moment he started to hear
[1:25:00] that Whirlwind again that
[1:25:03] wind so instead of taking a drink he
[1:25:06] just left
[1:25:09] crying years
[1:25:13] later uh he's at an appointment with a a
[1:25:16] friend and two young
[1:25:18] ladies they went out to
[1:25:21] eat then one of the young
[1:25:24] ladies that that he really liked she
[1:25:27] started to
[1:25:30] smoke and offered the cigarette to
[1:25:32] brother Brandon he said
[1:25:37] no she said you don't smoke you don't
[1:25:40] drink you don't dance you don't go to
[1:25:44] parties then what do you
[1:25:48] do I really like hunting and I like
[1:25:50] going
[1:25:51] fishing
[1:25:54] and once again she called him a
[1:25:58] and because he didn't want to be a
[1:26:02] he was going to smoke that
[1:26:05] cigarette
[1:26:06] but once again he heard the
[1:26:10] Whirlwind he he dropped the
[1:26:13] cigarette he left
[1:26:15] running brother Bram
[1:26:18] says those friends followed
[1:26:21] him making fun of
[1:26:23] him calling him a
[1:26:26] he went out to the field just to
[1:26:28] go
[1:26:29] cry what happened to
[1:26:31] him a complex of his
[1:26:36] past a
[1:26:39] complex can take you to commit
[1:26:45] sin can take you to go destroy
[1:26:48] yourself destroy your own
[1:26:51] life
[1:26:53] it can make you devalue your own
[1:26:56] self make you to hate somebody
[1:27:01] else can make you isolate yourself from
[1:27:03] everyone
[1:27:05] else go and hide from everyone
[1:27:09] else because you don't got something
[1:27:12] that they do
[1:27:13] have you don't do something that they
[1:27:18] do a complex can do that
[1:27:24] so then hearing
[1:27:25] this I could
[1:27:27] understand what happened to me the day
[1:27:33] before it seems like something so
[1:27:37] insignificant that I really shouldn't
[1:27:39] pay any attention to that but my
[1:27:43] complex is different than
[1:27:46] yours there's different
[1:27:49] ways that the devil can provoke me
[1:27:53] like he can provoke
[1:28:04] you so Esther had a trauma in her
[1:28:08] past she didn't allow for her
[1:28:11] trauma affect
[1:28:13] her but
[1:28:15] hmon he had a
[1:28:17] complex that
[1:28:20] complex took him to his own
[1:28:24] death it all
[1:28:27] depends if you allow your
[1:28:29] complexes to dominate
[1:28:32] you you're
[1:28:35] Esther you're born in God's
[1:28:38] kingdom you're the the the wife of the
[1:28:43] king but even so you still have to
[1:28:45] confront
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:52] brother Bram he also had his
[1:28:54] complexes at growing
[1:28:57] up in the message standing in the
[1:29:02] Gap God bless God bless each one of
[1:29:06] you we hope to see you again real
[1:29:10] soon till then will you do this one
[1:29:12] favor for me
[1:29:15] now both here and on the tapes also you
[1:29:20] Brethren pray that God Place into my
[1:29:25] heart something that I lost out there in
[1:29:28] that
[1:29:31] complex it's so easy to build a
[1:29:36] complex brother bram's
[1:29:40] complex we believe he's the messenger of
[1:29:42] this
[1:29:43] age the God's
[1:29:45] Prophet Elijah the
[1:29:48] prophet we believe that with all of our
[1:29:50] heart
[1:29:54] but back then in the times of brother
[1:29:56] brandham when he was giving his
[1:30:00] message the complex that he
[1:30:03] had is that people didn't want to listen
[1:30:06] to
[1:30:06] him people didn't want to pay
[1:30:11] attention so then if you listen to this
[1:30:13] message standing in the
[1:30:15] Gap brother bram's
[1:30:20] plan since he really enjoyed ened
[1:30:24] hunting and he enjoyed living in the
[1:30:29] mountains his plan was he's going to go
[1:30:31] and get in the
[1:30:33] mountain take his wife with
[1:30:38] him and live over there separated from
[1:30:40] everyone
[1:30:43] else why because people just didn't want
[1:30:45] to hear him if people don't want to hear
[1:30:47] me that's fine I'll go but since I'm a
[1:30:51] prophet
[1:30:53] if he gives me a message I'll come down
[1:30:54] and I'll preach to them then I'll go
[1:30:57] back up there people don't want to hear
[1:30:59] me that's
[1:31:03] fine a
[1:31:06] complex makes you build
[1:31:10] walls against other
[1:31:13] people that just want to help
[1:31:18] you makes you not be able to advance
[1:31:21] more with
[1:31:26] God if you hear that that message or or
[1:31:29] have heard the
[1:31:34] message you'll hear that brother
[1:31:35] brandham had a vision of two
[1:31:40] bums and in real life he encountered two
[1:31:47] bums and I believe his son Billy Paul
[1:31:50] said look dad that looks like you and
[1:31:51] your
[1:31:55] brother-in-law it was at that moment God
[1:31:57] then told
[1:31:59] him if you continue with your
[1:32:02] plans you'll end up like
[1:32:05] that and your wife's going to leave you
[1:32:08] why did that happen because of a
[1:32:11] complex that of being
[1:32:15] rejected an introverted
[1:32:18] person a person that's
[1:32:20] rejected
[1:32:23] since they don't get along well with
[1:32:25] people or people don't accept
[1:32:28] them they'd rather just be alone and
[1:32:31] being
[1:32:33] alone you're in your weakest
[1:32:36] point with the
[1:32:40] devil I know
[1:32:43] it because it's happened to
[1:32:46] me something happens to me I make a
[1:32:50] mistake I think God doesn't love me
[1:32:53] anymore he won't accept me
[1:32:57] again I did it I crossed the
[1:33:01] line then there's no
[1:33:04] reason for me to go to him and ask for
[1:33:07] forgiveness and because I accept
[1:33:10] that I go days weeks and
[1:33:13] months without talking to
[1:33:16] him because of a
[1:33:20] complex I feel that as though I'm just
[1:33:22] not
[1:33:24] worthy and this time I just cross the
[1:33:29] line when the Bible says God with his
[1:33:32] great love in which he loved
[1:33:34] us has forgiven
[1:33:39] us even with my
[1:33:42] complexes my
[1:33:45] mistakes the person that showed me the
[1:33:47] most love is is
[1:33:50] God
[1:33:55] but then my
[1:33:58] complexes they they build
[1:34:00] walls with
[1:34:05] him and the person that hurts me the
[1:34:08] most it's
[1:34:11] myself because of a simple
[1:34:15] complex your
[1:34:18] complexes can paralyze you can weak weak
[1:34:21] in
[1:34:25] you can make you lose all the progress
[1:34:28] that you've
[1:34:30] made can make you separate from everyone
[1:34:34] else and believe that everybody hates
[1:34:37] you nobody loves you nobody misses
[1:34:45] you a complex can do
[1:34:48] that because you don't feel Worthy
[1:34:54] you know nobody likes
[1:34:58] you that's my
[1:35:01] complex that I receiv received since a
[1:35:04] child since I was so
[1:35:07] quiet I thought I'm never going to have
[1:35:13] friends now every time that I travel I
[1:35:15] encounter a
[1:35:20] friend and say how do I get friends when
[1:35:22] I'm so
[1:35:26] quiet God helps you with your
[1:35:33] complexes if you see that someone has a
[1:35:37] complex that they're not too
[1:35:40] social or they don't feel that they're
[1:35:42] worthy whatever
[1:35:45] reason the best
[1:35:48] medicine the best an adult for that
[1:35:50] complex
[1:35:52] it's
[1:35:59] love but what you've got to
[1:36:02] do is compare your complex to the word
[1:36:06] of
[1:36:08] God that's what brother brandham says if
[1:36:11] you've got a
[1:36:12] complex compare to the word of
[1:36:15] God to see if it's true or
[1:36:20] not
[1:36:24] so then
[1:36:25] Esther she received a trauma in her
[1:36:30] childhood she lost her parents when they
[1:36:33] died
[1:36:36] heon he wanted to kill the
[1:36:39] Jews kill
[1:36:44] Mori he didn't know but he was
[1:36:46] conspiring against his own
[1:36:48] Queen and Esther found out
[1:36:54] so what she did she began to
[1:36:56] pray for three days the Bible
[1:37:01] says now the
[1:37:06] King was in uh what's called the inner
[1:37:11] courts and the Bible says there was a
[1:37:18] law if anyone entered into those inner
[1:37:21] cour
[1:37:22] without being
[1:37:24] summoned they'd be
[1:37:26] killed
[1:37:29] except that the king would extend his
[1:37:33] scepter which was a golden staff that he
[1:37:38] carried the Bible says that when it
[1:37:40] speaks of
[1:37:45] Esther the king loved her above all the
[1:37:47] women of the
[1:37:50] Kingdom so when she had that
[1:37:52] petition she started to
[1:37:57] pray if you notice she started to
[1:37:59] fulfill the office of a
[1:38:01] priest interceding for someone
[1:38:04] else having
[1:38:06] compassion for her
[1:38:09] people she started to
[1:38:12] pray and then she clothed herself a
[1:38:14] certain
[1:38:16] way the priest had to dress a certain
[1:38:20] way entered into the inner
[1:38:23] Court went into the holiest of
[1:38:26] hly where the King's throne
[1:38:30] was with the risk of being
[1:38:34] killed but since the king loved her so
[1:38:37] much he forgave he pardoned her
[1:38:41] life you're not
[1:38:43] worthy to enter into the holiest of
[1:38:47] Hol but the blood that he
[1:38:49] shed it makes makes you
[1:38:52] worthy and it forgives your life pardons
[1:38:54] your
[1:38:56] life even apart from your
[1:38:58] complexes and your sins your
[1:39:06] mistakes don't
[1:39:08] allow your
[1:39:12] complex impede you to come to
[1:39:16] God your
[1:39:20] complexes make you be
[1:39:25] selfish that you just want to search for
[1:39:27] your own
[1:39:30] benefit the one that searches for your
[1:39:32] benefit is
[1:39:35] God the Bible says don't forget about
[1:39:38] his
[1:39:39] Mercy don't forget about all of his
[1:39:44] benefits it says the love does so many
[1:39:47] things one thing it doesn't
[1:39:50] do it doesn't search for its own
[1:39:53] good and a person full of
[1:39:58] complexes just wants to protect
[1:40:02] themselves they don't want to go through
[1:40:04] more
[1:40:05] humiliations more
[1:40:09] criticism you weren't called to be
[1:40:13] selfish I wasn't called to be
[1:40:15] self and because of my
[1:40:18] complex I've been very arrogant
[1:40:24] a complex can cause
[1:40:27] that you can be
[1:40:30] selfish and not help the
[1:40:34] rest because you're thinking of how can
[1:40:36] I
[1:40:37] overcome you want to protect
[1:40:40] yourself no one harm
[1:40:46] me when Christ gave his life he shed his
[1:40:50] blood
[1:40:53] he was humbled in the worst
[1:40:55] way because he wanted to save
[1:41:00] me Christ will never
[1:41:03] care about the complexes the mistakes
[1:41:07] the sins that you've
[1:41:10] got but if
[1:41:13] you allow those complexes to over to
[1:41:16] dominate you they're going to impede
[1:41:19] you in your Christian
[1:41:24] walk the key
[1:41:26] is recognize your
[1:41:30] complex and allow God to give you his
[1:41:34] love the person that has loved me the
[1:41:37] most that's loved me the
[1:41:41] most That Forgives me over and over and
[1:41:45] over he's never against me it's
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:52] but I've got to
[1:41:54] recognize that I harm
[1:41:57] myself in recognizing my
[1:42:11] complex Hebrews
[1:42:19] 4:4
[1:42:22] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:42:23] priest that has passed into the heavens
[1:42:25] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[1:42:28] our
[1:42:40] profession for we have not a high priest
[1:42:42] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:42:44] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:42:46] tempted like as we are yet without
[1:42:49] sin
[1:42:57] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[1:42:58] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[1:43:01] and find Grace to to help in time of
[1:43:06] need there's a a a
[1:43:09] scepter that's going to find
[1:43:12] you if you draw close to
[1:43:15] God there's not a
[1:43:17] need to have fear
[1:43:22] the Bible says that perfect
[1:43:23] love casts out
[1:43:27] fear there's a king that loves
[1:43:33] you and will give you of his own divine
[1:43:37] nature his own
[1:43:39] Holiness and will give
[1:43:42] you what Satan could never have to be
[1:43:46] like
[1:43:47] God
[1:43:49] perfect
[1:43:51] let us
[1:44:00] stand brother brandom says in the
[1:44:02] message
[1:44:06] Fellowship preached on the 11th of June
[1:44:09] in
[1:44:16] 1960 and men just educate themselves
[1:44:19] till they'll educate themselves away

[1:44:31] blood of Jesus Christ re you get
[1:44:38] love that's where you get
[1:44:43] love not a complex that I'm just a
[1:44:45] little bigger than somebody
[1:44:47] else a little better than somebody else
[1:44:51] I know a little more than somebody
[1:44:55] else you've got your arms around
[1:44:59] everybody and it's a basis of Love
[1:45:01] through the

[1:45:28] condition and then you gave saw gave him
