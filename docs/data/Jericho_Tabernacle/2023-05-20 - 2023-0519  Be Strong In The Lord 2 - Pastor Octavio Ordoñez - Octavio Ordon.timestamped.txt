[28:36] and in the power of His might
[28:40] is
[28:45] put on the whole armor of God
[28:49] oh it's been a
[28:51] a really busy uh
[28:53] last two three weeks
[28:58] like to give you a short update actually
[29:04] we had those meetings and special
[29:07] meetings three nights
[29:12] and they were they were a blessing
[29:16] really enjoyed those meetings
[29:21] and uh
[29:24] after the meetings we we went uh
[29:28] camping the wife and I is
[29:34] get out of town
[29:38] you know when you're in the forest
[29:42] you try and clean your your mind a
[29:45] little bit
[29:47] walk around the forests
[29:51] watch the trees
[29:55] just get away from
[29:57] everyone
[30:01] I didn't get away from the wife too yeah
[30:05] I just leave and the wife goes where did
[30:07] he goes
[30:10] I like to go up to the mountains
[30:14] I've been doing that since I was
[30:17] a kid
[30:20] and well being up in the mountains
[30:25] you get to see a lot
[30:29] and I like to to hang out or look at the
[30:33] trees
[30:37] I had a video of a tree but I forgot to
[30:40] give it to them
[30:44] once you go up and hiking around in the
[30:47] trees
[30:50] you'll find all kinds of trees
[30:56] trees that have fallen down
[30:59] dead for years
[31:02] you see some real small trees and you
[31:06] try not to step on them
[31:09] you see some trees that are leaning over
[31:16] to fall
[31:19] some trees that have grown up real
[31:21] crooked
[31:24] but in the midst of all these trees
[31:28] the ones that stand out
[31:32] are the big healthy ones
[31:36] those are the ones that are attracted to
[31:39] you
[31:42] I like to go see these big trees
[31:47] sit around by the tree
[31:51] a little bit
[31:53] and relax a little bit
[31:56] is really good for you
[31:59] to get out and relax and and just be in
[32:02] nature
[32:06] to hear the animals animales
[32:09] it's just a blessing to be out there
[32:13] if I could I'd be out there all the time
[32:18] but even then you get tired of being in
[32:21] the woods
[32:24] and you have to come home
[32:27] well after that we went to a funeral
[32:33] a precious brother went to be with the
[32:36] lord
[32:38] well Tommy Perez
[32:43] he was a tremendous man
[32:46] the ministry about 55 years
[32:51] some of the testimonies that we heard
[32:54] tremendous
[33:06] yeah he he was able to do many things
[33:09] that we just dream about
[33:15] God was with this man
[33:18] the Miracles that were displayed
[33:23] with this man
[33:25] we're tremendous if you get a chance
[33:29] listen to the testimonies online
[33:35] he was a man of God
[33:38] and he produced
[33:41] children egos that are men of God
[33:46] is is his daughters married men of God
[33:52] so you can tell a lot by a man with his
[33:56] family
[34:02] so it was a blessing to be there
[34:06] a blessing to be with like-minded
[34:09] believers
[34:13] they must have been over 50 ministers
[34:22] and it was just such a privilege for me
[34:26] to be there
[34:29] well after that on on Wednesday night
[34:33] we went to Brother Israel Paul's church
[34:38] I needed to talk to him
[34:42] and he asked me to speak so I I spoke
[34:45] for him
[34:48] last night
[34:51] so it was a privilege to be there with
[34:53] him
[34:56] and uh brother Israel Paul is a good
[34:59] friend amigo
[35:02] but today we're gonna
[35:04] a follow-up on part two yeah
[35:09] be strong in the Lord
[35:13] this is from these messages here
[35:17] now these these messages are from
[35:20] demonology
[35:23] and what we're going to be doing is what
[35:26] we're going to be reading from the
[35:27] second book on here
[35:31] now the word is pretty strong demonology
[35:36] but the message itself was preached in
[35:39] 1952 is
[35:43] very February 24th
[35:47] it's called believing God
[35:51] well let's let's see what brother
[35:54] Branham says
[35:57] concerning how to believe in God
[36:01] our previous message uh
[36:05] we talked about how it's a struggle um
[36:11] there is a struggle between good and
[36:13] evil
[36:16] it's a tug of war is
[36:19] whoever is winning
[36:21] is a one-year feeding the most
[36:25] it's a white dog yes
[36:30] whoever's winning
[36:32] is the one you're fitting the most
[36:38] it's a tug of war is
[36:43] now in order to win this tug of war
[36:48] you need to find out who your enemy is
[36:56] your opponent your brother
[36:59] or his opponent your opponent the devil
[37:03] is
[37:05] demons you need to learn how to fight
[37:09] them
[37:11] we need to know how to fight the Devil
[37:16] he's a wise Old Devil is
[37:26] because God won the war already
[37:29] he's won the fight
[37:32] now we need to know
[37:35] how he defeated
[37:39] and we're going to read
[37:41] try and understand a little bit about
[37:44] his word
[37:49] brother Abraham said a key uh item here
[37:55] remember the story about the sister that
[37:59] couldn't be healed
[38:03] she was a nervous wreck
[38:07] what was the key there
[38:10] the key is that she didn't confess all
[38:13] her sins
[38:17] confess part of your sins
[38:27] even the prophet could not cast out that
[38:30] spirit
[38:33] because there was sins still there
[38:37] he had to sit with her
[38:41] to find out what was going on with her
[38:45] once he found out there was sin there
[38:47] yeah
[39:14] the person that's praying for her
[39:18] also has to be right with God
[39:22] both of them have to be right with God
[39:26] to be able to cast out that Spirit
[39:28] foreign
[39:49] some of you need this foreign
[40:39] on line 58
[40:42] we can go to uh
[40:45] Genesis chapter 22.
[40:51] verse
[40:53] now we're going to talk about Abraham
[40:57] sometimes we think we're tested
[41:03] we don't get what we want no uh
[41:12] we don't get what we want uh
[41:19] he had to wait 25 years
[41:24] 25 years waiting for his son
[41:28] he was called up from the city of herb
[41:31] and foreign
[41:42] [Music]
[42:13] you're this or you're that right
[42:17] but it's okay
[42:19] I followed the words
[42:31] 8 chapter 22.
[42:35] how many know what Abraham means
[42:39] he's the father of Nations
[42:44] the father of Nations
[42:48] and Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[42:51] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[42:55] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[42:58] knife and they went both of them
[43:00] together it is
[43:10] he was asked to go sacrifice his only
[43:14] son foreign
[43:44] now 63 says now Abraham didn't have any
[43:49] great clouds of witnesses like we have
[43:52] today
[43:54] is
[44:03] 63 that's Hebrews chapter 12 for Abraham
[44:07] himself was a Chaldean yet father of the
[44:11] Jews but he was a kalian from the city
[44:14] of Earth and he was called out from
[44:17] among his people to walk in a Strange
[44:20] Land is
[44:36] beautiful that types the Christian walk
[44:40] today Christianity
[44:44] we have to come out from our Associates
[44:47] of the world to walk in a Strange Land
[44:49] or strange to the first land that we
[44:53] walked in
[44:58] united
[45:03] in the land that we call today is walk
[45:06] in the Christian way
[45:13] walk with Christo
[45:18] separate ourselves from the things of
[45:21] the world
[45:25] Divine promise was made
[45:30] [Music]
[45:32] when a Divine promises made
[45:37] listen God is solely under oath and
[45:41] obligated to take care of his promises
[45:53] God is solely under all and obligated to
[45:58] take care of any of his promises
[46:07] God is worth no more than what his word
[46:12] is
[46:16] if that word is not effective then God
[46:21] is not effective
[46:26] that is God
[46:28] do you believe it
[46:31] is God the Bible said in the beginning
[46:34] was the word and the Word was God
[46:38] and where it was
[46:46] John 1 1. in Juan Uno
[46:49] and I'm worth no more than my word
[46:54] you're worth no more than your word is
[47:02] if I had a handful of weed laying here
[47:06] in my hands
[47:13] it will be nothing
[47:15] it will never be nothing but wheat
[47:18] laying there
[47:20] is
[47:44] Jesus said or Paul I believe that's
[47:47] except the corn of wheat fall into the
[47:50] ground and die a remains alone John 12
[47:54] 24. Jesus
[48:04] and now this is God
[48:07] his word and when that word anchors
[48:12] listen when that word anchors down into
[48:15] the heart
[48:17] or if I could just get you to see it
[48:19] when that word anchors there it produces
[48:24] just what it's said it'll do just it's
[48:28] God it has to yes
[48:48] well I know the word is there yeah
[48:55] they're just laying hands on you
[48:59] yeah it'll be dormant
[49:03] that's right it won't move because oh I
[49:07] read the Bible
[49:11] but until
[49:13] foreign
[49:41] when the word is
[49:50] there's a song
[49:54] called in English
[49:58] I like to read that yeah

[53:08] I'm anchor is
[53:10] on the solid ground
[53:13] in Jesus Christ
[53:15] Jesus Christ Alone
[53:20] those are lyrics by Ray Boltz esses
[53:26] 985
[53:30] you can anchor
[53:32] that and say Yes Lord that's for me then
[53:37] something is going to happen it has to
[53:39] until that is just a written word
[53:56] that's right but when it's
[54:00] once anchored
[54:05] the outside is sin think about this for
[54:09] a little bit this is
[54:13] you know your body is sin
[54:18] that's the reason you don't try to
[54:20] perfect this body is
[54:39] and that soul is the same way until the
[54:43] soul died and then was born again of God
[54:47] is
[54:57] the soul The Sinner shall die
[55:04] John 6 47.
[55:09] then there is an immortal life
[55:38] you have to throw away your senses
[55:42] I never gave you this senses to trust
[55:50] he gave you his Spirit he trust you
[55:58] your sense is only to contact see
[56:02] tasteful smell in here so since
[56:19] and when that's been regenerated and the
[56:23] Old Man Died
[56:25] foreign
[56:53] creator
[56:55] then you can believe impossible things
[57:01] because you are made up of Miracle
[57:04] working God
[57:12] we got to hear some testimony
[57:22] some Miracles
[57:24] that you'd have to be there
[57:32] but I believe they happen
[57:36] I don't know if you've heard any of his
[57:38] testimonies
[57:42] they were driving down the road
[57:48] it was a firsthand testimony from the
[57:51] brothers
[57:53] yes brother Tommy hey yeah you're out of
[57:57] gas is
[58:01] you need to stop and put
[58:05] Gasolina and he kept driving yes and he
[58:10] kept telling them you have to stop and
[58:11] put Gasolina
[58:16] a whirlwind came over
[58:22] it had hundred dollar bills inside the
[58:25] Whirlwind
[58:31] got a few hundred dollars
[58:35] told the brother okay that's enough
[58:37] that's all we need yeah
[58:46] they were low on money on one of their
[58:48] trips
[58:53] they had their wallets and wow they were
[58:55] missing quite a few dollars
[59:03] the Wallets on top of the
[59:07] counteras
[59:14] well when they woke up
[59:16] brother Tommy asked them well how much
[59:19] money do we have
[59:22] they had exactly what they needed
[59:26] is it believable
[59:29] all things are possible
[59:32] the problem is do we believe
[59:36] do we actually believe this works
[59:45] on line 100
[59:48] don't you see what I mean
[59:55] you get what I mean
[59:59] then in there there is a spirit
[1:00:04] and from there is your Immortal Life
[1:00:10] then a man that's born of the spirit of
[1:00:13] God does not commit sin
[1:00:17] you get the scripture straightened out
[1:00:20] then
[1:00:23] if he if the worshiper wants purged has
[1:00:27] no more conscience or desires of sin no
[1:00:31] more conscience of it Hebrews 10.
[1:00:40] in the Old Testament the worship were
[1:00:43] come in and offered his sacrifice went
[1:00:46] back out with the same desire to sin is
[1:00:58] but here here it is get it Hebrew said
[1:01:01] when the worshiper
[1:01:03] in his case in this case who puts his
[1:01:09] hands on the son of God's head and his
[1:01:12] sins are purged by the sanctifying power
[1:01:15] of God he said is
[1:01:34] there is no more desire in there for sin
[1:01:41] oh there is
[1:01:47] word is
[1:01:49] when you have no more desire to send
[1:01:56] when God has purged that Soul
[1:02:00] has cleaned that Spirit
[1:02:03] there is no more desire to sin yeah
[1:02:09] oh there's where life lays
[1:02:13] then that makes you an offspring of
[1:02:16] Jehovah
[1:02:23] and makes you an offspring of God
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:28] now Abraham takes Isaac and they start
[1:02:31] towards the mountain and now in verse 9.
[1:02:35] how do you say
[1:02:37] he is
[1:02:40] and they came to the place which God
[1:02:43] told him and Abraham built an altar
[1:02:46] there and laid the wooden in order and
[1:02:49] bound Isaac's son and laid him on the
[1:02:52] altar upon the wood
[1:02:54] Abraham
[1:03:12] he tested them until he held them back
[1:03:20] and he said now I know you believe me
[1:03:23] Chris
[1:03:26] line 107.
[1:03:28] so therefore that's the reason said the
[1:03:33] prayer of faith shall save the sick this
[1:03:36] is
[1:03:41] an individual's prayer
[1:03:47] and prayer of a righteous man of baileth
[1:03:51] mucho
[1:03:55] the effectual
[1:03:58] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:04:01] available
[1:04:15] listen Christ gave you the authority
[1:04:21] Christ gave us the authority
[1:04:26] by being Christians the most powerful
[1:04:30] weapon the world has ever known
[1:04:39] you can
[1:04:41] you know Prayer Changes Things
[1:04:48] you can be all upset

[1:05:04] prayer changes
[1:05:09] you refuse to pray
[1:05:11] you'll keep what you have upstairs
[1:05:14] when you fall on your knees
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:20] prayer changes things
[1:05:23] you can be all nervous and upset
[1:05:28] but when you fall on your knees
[1:05:31] the atmosphere changes
[1:05:42] it could be as soon as you fall on your
[1:05:44] knees
[1:05:48] or it could be later
[1:05:51] maybe you refuse to pray
[1:05:55] what can we not do enough oh okay it's
[1:05:58] okay
[1:06:07] Christ gave us the authority
[1:06:10] with his name by being Christians
[1:06:14] the most powerful weapon the world has
[1:06:19] ever known
[1:06:22] prayer
[1:06:24] it even changes everything
[1:06:29] the mind of God
[1:06:35] after death was pronounced on the man
[1:06:40] he prayed and God told the
[1:06:43] prophetic go back and tell him I heard
[1:06:46] him
[1:06:49] see their prayer
[1:06:52] hold on
[1:06:54] Isaiah 38 and he said yesterday
[1:06:58] amen
[1:07:02] you know who the ram was
[1:07:09] that was Christ is
[1:07:15] Abraham called the name of the place
[1:07:18] Jehovah Jireh Abram
[1:07:22] said to this day in the Mount of the
[1:07:25] Lord it shall be seen
[1:07:42] now you remember how many Redemptive
[1:07:45] names
[1:07:47] remember the picture
[1:07:51] uh brother Bosworth beat the brother
[1:07:57] the Redemptive names of Jehovah applied
[1:08:00] to Jesus Christ
[1:08:08] now he was Jehovah Jireh they say
[1:08:18] not down like that yes seven compound
[1:08:22] Redemptive names
[1:08:25] and substitutionary to a human life
[1:08:34] provided sacrifice
[1:08:36] that in Isaac All Nations will be
[1:08:39] blessed
[1:08:41] and through Isis
[1:08:44] and we've been dead in Christ
[1:08:51] foreign
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:58] there you are and that brings not our
[1:09:00] bodies we are Gentiles in our bodies
[1:09:03] we're sinners in our bodies
[1:09:14] being born again
[1:09:16] with the same Spirit was upon faithful
[1:09:21] abrahamas
[1:09:24] that string down in there makes us want
[1:09:27] to trust God is
[1:09:39] the children of Abraham let's be asked
[1:09:43] father
[1:09:44] abrahamas
[1:09:50] Line 120
[1:09:54] now you see
[1:09:56] when we as Christians don't look
[1:10:00] feel see taste smell or hear
[1:10:04] when we're speaking to God
[1:10:08] this is foreign
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:35] now listen to this real quick here if
[1:10:43] we're born of our heavenly father god
[1:10:46] who caused those things which are not as
[1:10:49] though they were
[1:11:00] has got to be something in us like that
[1:11:06] see that's the reason that a real
[1:11:09] consecrated
[1:11:12] the solemn
[1:11:16] or dedication
[1:11:19] that's all out for God
[1:11:26] is
[1:11:31] look to what God Said instead of what
[1:11:34] you see or feel that's the Earthly man
[1:11:39] yet if we walk in the flesh we can't
[1:11:42] please God we walk after the spirit see
[1:11:45] Romans 8
[1:11:50] is Ocho
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:04] I'm gonna Skip Along here
[1:12:07] hopefully I can wake you guys up in a
[1:12:10] little bit
[1:12:14] that's it
[1:12:17] I put you to sleep so I gotta wake you
[1:12:19] up
[1:12:26] look let's go to line 150.
[1:12:34] I like let's go to 149.
[1:12:39] there you are faith in the word see you
[1:12:43] couldn't save no one and preaching the
[1:12:46] gospel of Salvation doesn't make you a
[1:12:49] divine Savior no more than preaching
[1:12:52] Divine Healing makes me a Divine healer
[1:12:56] but it's the faith in God's spoken word
[1:13:04] is
[1:13:17] and I know this that some of us has more
[1:13:21] faith than others
[1:13:25] and those who have abundance of Faith
[1:13:28] are supposed to pray for those
[1:13:34] but if you don't live the right kind of
[1:13:36] life
[1:13:40] you better leave away from it
[1:13:44] the devil will laugh in your prayers
[1:13:48] but when you live right
[1:13:52] and do right
[1:13:54] and act right
[1:13:57] faith in God
[1:14:00] Satan will tremble when you speak
[1:14:06] because God swore under obligation
[1:14:10] he will take care of that prayer that's
[1:14:14] true obligations
[1:14:21] now listen on on the 19th verse put on
[1:14:25] the jacket hold up the cup watch
[1:14:37] and being now we can Faith he considered
[1:14:40] not his own body now dead
[1:14:47] Romans 4 19-25
[1:14:51] now if your father Abraham
[1:14:55] who your childhood through Christ
[1:14:58] consider not his own body when he was
[1:15:00] dead
[1:15:01] what about yours which is alive this
[1:15:04] morning
[1:15:16] and that was before Christ came that was
[1:15:19] before and any atonement was made
[1:15:27] that's before the great cloud of
[1:15:30] witnesses was gone on
[1:15:34] for the Holy Spirit
[1:15:40] Week of Faith he considered not his own
[1:15:42] body
[1:15:47] don't consider your sickness
[1:15:59] you see we have to trust in God's word
[1:16:04] it doesn't matter how you feel
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:09] we have to trust in his word
[1:16:12] that God is painful to his own words
[1:16:20] but you know how it can be faithful to
[1:16:22] my word
[1:16:28] if you speak his words
[1:16:32] if you speak God's word
[1:16:35] he will recognize his own words
[1:16:39] and you'll be faithful to his own words
[1:16:45] there was a man
[1:16:48] he was a slave brother Brian talks about
[1:16:50] this
[1:16:53] musicians can come up
[1:16:58] in this uh slave yes he was scared
[1:17:04] he was trembling
[1:17:06] he had a hard time
[1:17:14] he was trembling
[1:17:17] and the man that was going to kill him
[1:17:21] said no wait up it's a straighten up
[1:17:27] what can we do for you before we kill
[1:17:29] you
[1:17:31] give me a glass of water uh
[1:17:35] so you gave him a glass of water
[1:17:38] he was shaking yeah
[1:17:43] hold on to the glass of water
[1:17:48] I'm not going to kill you until you
[1:17:51] drink the water
[1:17:55] you spilled the water
[1:17:59] so with that man that talked to him
[1:18:04] if he was a faithful man
[1:18:08] stuck to his word
[1:18:12] then he couldn't kill that man anymore
[1:18:16] God is faithful to his own words
[1:18:21] speak his word
[1:18:24] by his promises
[1:18:35] I mess up all the time
[1:18:50] it's his work
[1:18:54] that's what I'm relying on
[1:18:58] that's what I'm staying with
[1:19:05] this is a very important prayer
[1:19:07] important
[1:19:10] but before this prayer
[1:19:16] we have to understand that we had over
[1:19:19] 600 promises
[1:19:24] God has made to us
[1:19:32] when when there are 600 and something
[1:19:35] promises directed to the church in the
[1:19:38] last days
[1:19:43] that these things will take place
[1:19:47] and his power is yet the same is
[1:19:51] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:54] and forever
[1:20:01] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:20:03] pray
[1:20:07] believe you receive them
[1:20:11] Mark 11 24. Marcos owns if you abiding
[1:20:16] me in my words in you
[1:20:20] ask what you will
[1:20:23] a little bit done unto you
[1:20:27] John 15 7.
[1:20:30] the things that I do shall you do also
[1:20:33] Las Cruces
[1:20:36] greater than this when I go to my Father
[1:20:41] John 14 12 Juan

[1:21:26] say in Italian don't believe it
[1:21:30] I don't like him don't don't believe him
[1:21:38] but with God's word
[1:21:43] we can tell Satan he's a liar foreign
[1:21:48] we have the promises
[1:21:53] we have the promises of God
[1:21:56] who need to be like Abraham
[1:22:00] is staggered not at the promises of God
[1:22:07] but was strong in the faith
[1:22:11] giving glory to God
[1:22:14] Romans 4 20.
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:20] 184
[1:22:27] I just I can just hit the devil in the
[1:22:31] face with that he said
