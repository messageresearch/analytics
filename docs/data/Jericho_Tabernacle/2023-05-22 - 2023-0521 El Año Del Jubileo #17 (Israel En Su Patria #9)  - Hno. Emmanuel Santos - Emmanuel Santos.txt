heads let us pray Heavenly Father we come to you this morning because you are the author of life you saw us and yourself even before the foundation of the world and after the foundation of the world and after everything is all finished we'll also be with you Lord that we may be able to enter that Holy Union with the Holy Spirit you see if somebody this morning hasn't taken their decision to accept it perhaps somebody this morning it's struggling to have faith may you be able to give them the oil this morning and you'll be able to anoint them in their hearts so that they can have the plenty of Faith to believe that God will do it [Music] we commend ourselves into your hands ome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen as you're standing there we're going to read one scripture it's in Jeremiah 32. verses 6 through 14. and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying he says behold and the son of Shalom thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying by thee my field that is for the right of redemption is dying to buy it foreign according to the word of the Lord and said unto me by my field I pray thee that is in anat which is the country of Benjamin for the right of the heritage is thine and the Redemption is thine by it for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord and I brought to the field of Hannah mill on my uncle's son that was in anatoth and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver is and I subscribed the evidence and I sealed it and I took Witnesses and weighed him the money and the balances so I took the evidence of purchase both which was sealed according to the law and custom and which was open and they gave the evidence and the purchase unto the Baruch the son of naraya the son of messiah in the sight of hanamel mine's uncle's son and in the presence of the witness and subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison and Charles broke before them saying yes and thus the Lord hosts God of Israel take these evidences the evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them on the unearthing vessel them they may continue many days God bless his word you may take your seat [Music] because I really feel what God has for you this morning perhaps but if somebody's needing this morning we understand that Jeremiah he bought a property uh and he placed the documents [Music] and he put it in a vase of clay and it had two parts instruction is in the Gabriel's instructions to Daniel and then we see this the Scrolls he said we see the Scrolls how the scroll was handed in his hands how in Jeremiah and Jeremiah 32 6 Supremo animel his cousin had left him an inheritance and they were entering into captivity and we were going into it and with it this morning and it was kept in an Earthly vessel de dios shows were the power of God and the Scrolls and the secrets of gods are known in the heart in El Corazon in the heart our Plan of Redemption our plan we've led to the same being kept in Earthly vessels in Jesus name and the revelations we've touched on this topic in the past when we talked about the rainbows and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon top thereof this is we we're just we what we just read is this here verse three this is two olive trees buy it upon the right side of the bowl and on the upon the left side thereof uh we see that Jeremiah had the documents can go up to heaven [Music] because they're up there is so if you were able to identify us that the open part is here on Earth because not everybody can go up to the skies that's up there in the sky the same you saw the seven Church ages because he was here on Earth but after that go see what was in disguise not everybody can go up to the sky Jesus not everybody's gonna accept Jesus as their savior see this open part effect can benefit the Believers and the unbelievers foreign and believers but these here as they are on the earth contaminados can be contaminated by unbelievers just like the first and second pool brother Brandon was rejected by the Angels because he showed all the other ministers how to use the first and second pool according to the second pool is it won't be a public Affair or a spectacular show a public show because the first and second have an annoyment they have oil pero foreign because the people who are using their their uh anointing to bring the attention of the people so they could have more money at their church more people to grab the people's attention but not for the church for himself is the close part in Zacharias in Zechariah we see that this candle stick is two trees one on each side we've just showed you is that this Candlestick is here on Earth amen amen and has it being here on the Earth the oil can be perverted foreign [Music] the power of the Holy Spirit It Is Burning Brightly because it has plenty of oil which is getting from the two olive trees so the oil that would come upon this is from the olives that were in the olive trees but I like it being here on the earth it can be touched by unbelievers people that don't believe the original continues to say this is the two trees represent the old and the New Testament and of course the oil type advised the Holy Ghost which alone can give the light to the people so the angel who spoke to Zechariah was saying as much as saying this is what you see means the church cannot accomplish anything by its own my or power but by the Holy Ghost how can we help people to be healed as you pervert the teaching of the Holy Spirit you limit the power of the Holy Spirit me as a minister if I get up here and I say God no longer heals well if you say in your heart while the minister said it well then I believe that he don't heal me I'm limiting your faith in the Holy Spirit if I tell you that the Lord still heals that God will heal you that's what happened in the seven churches because it's here on Earth not everybody here on the Earth are believers alvazo perdon is now you examine this lamp stand you will notice that this has a large bowl parallel it's a reservoir that is the central to seven arms that come out of it is this bowl is filled with olive oil which flows through the seven Wicked Wicks which are placed in the seven arms it is the same oil that burns and makes the lights at the end of the seven pipes this light never went out Los Angeles the priest just kept pouring oil into the bowl we said since the lamp was lit in a special way says first the priest would take fire from the sacred altar originally foreign and so on until the seven lamps were burning this Holy Fire from the altar Que Paso de lampara lampara being passed from Lab to land it's a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages the original outpouring on Pentecost which outpouring came directly from the Jesus from Jesus on The Mercy Seat is enduring in his church throughout the seven Church ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the never-changing god in his Essence and his ways here Brothers how the oil can be contaminated is paragraph 36. in San Juan Quince and John 15 Jesus Jesus said I am the vine and you're the branches remember there are two trees there with this Candlestick tree has branches now the vine does not bear fruit but the branches that do it this is now watch this says you can take a citrus tree in such an orange tree as a citrus tree in Orange Street and you could take a limb a lemon tree a tangelo limb and other kinds of varieties and all those limbs will grow the original tree is an orange tree but there are trees that are grafted branches that are grafted that are not oranges but they're similar there's two spirits El de Cristo Jesus Christ of the Antichrist is and there are two similar Spirits just like the original tree is an orange but you can put a branch of a of a grapefruit a grapefruit and they're very similar let's continue reading this is get those limbs that will be thriving off the life of the tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself it will be an orange branch and it will bear oranges because the life of the lamb and the of the life in the trunk are identical embargo Northwest where it was it wasn't so with the grafted limbs is those grafted branches had their Source on other kinds of life from there seeds or they will bear fruit right all right but it won't be oranges they cannot because they are not the original that's the way the church is the vine has been split and limbs have been grafted in they have grafted Baptist limbs Presbyterian respiratory and Pentecostal Limbs and limbs are bearing Baptists Pentecostals Presbyterians denominational seeds from which they have produced their fruits but if the vine ever brings forth another brand it'll be it'll be of itself it'll be the same kind that was brought forth at Pentecost we will speak in tongues and power and science of the resurrected Jesus in it because it's thriving on the natural resources of the vine itself you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in Dubai when those other branches were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fruit before they were not born of the vine is they don't know know about the original life and the original Fruit they cannot know for they were not born in it but if they had been born of it in the same life that was in the original stem Jesus Jesus would have come through them and manifested through them foreign we see that the key is this has two trees that's here on Earth yes and the oil that's of the candlesticks comes from the trees but there's other people that graft other branches into that tree and they use the life of that tree fruto to produce its own fruits that's how the denominations today do it they come with their own ideas of the Bible and they use the power of the holy spirit because the rain falls under Justin the unjust us they use the anointing of the Holy Spirit and they produce their own fruit s with their false teachings this is the limit the power of the holy spirit that is in the Bible it's a denominational anointing foreign but it's a perverted one adios um let's skip that one I'm building it okay unveiling God they say all right there's three offices that Jesus Christ had and this is paragraph 76 78 68 sorry we said notice now he came as a prophet yes he came as the son of man this place after the Holy Spirit came he said he was then the Son of God God is a spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he lived through the church ages as Son of God this is now in the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he is the son of David they took out the oil is he said he would be revealed again as son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it is it's been bailed through these ages according to what God Said and it will be open in the last days those Seven Seals will be broke and the full thing would come into the view of the people it takes place all along the seventh angel message this is all the mysteries of God should be known in the Elijah is this last hour is how the crisis put out of his church the Son of God how he is revealed as a son of man again there's two offices that I want to focus myself with one is the Son of God but the balances that goes to the seven Church ages that symbolizes a prophetic message but in the seven churches those two offices they have anointings but the anointing of the seven churches is a Priestly anointing that is superior to that anointing that is the anointing of the prophets that is a prophetic anointing this can be contaminated because they're people that are not faithful to the word yes and it's subject to the word Earth showed us last week you can go up to the skies not only is but you're also Eagles so you have access to that other oil only the Eagles can not contaminated Olympia something clean but this one is subject to the Earth you want to go on a Rapture though we need another oil this is half of a circle another oil to go up either three this is first Samuel 3-3 this is an air the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the arbor God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep you can see that the lamp was there and says before it all went out there was Samuel the prophet is we're lit by the priests this is a priest anointing prophetic but there's another prophetic anointing verse he said here's the Lord It's called Samuel and he said here I am three times God called Samuel says it's like three times God used first second and third pool is and he ran unto Ali and he said here I am for thou has called me and he said I called not lie down again and he went and lay down and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Italy and said here I am for thou this called me and he answered I called not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him and said the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he said he he said here I am for The Outfits call me and Ali perceived that the Lord had called the child therefore he said go lie down if it shall be if you call thee Thou shalt say Speak Lord is and the Lord came and stood called at the other time Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak for thy servant hear it there's a transition we had a prophet verse 12. this is in that day I will perform against all things which I have spoken concerning his house when I begin I will also make an endos [Music] for I will have him and I will judge his house for every forever for the iniquity which he had known it because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not is a Priestly oil Paul was a priest continues Anton [Music] they left what was original God was going to judge them verse 14. this important sacrifices he says therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel and Shiloh by the word of the Lord is a place and they went and crossed over into the promised land what does that signify to enter into the promises enter into the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost after that rebellious children did not subject themselves to that place was a place of blessings of different types of people would come to that place because that's where the Tabernacle was what the ark was because of the sin of the people dios Maldives God cursed that place El Pueblo I said Phil and Los felices the Philistines had come on they killed these two people okay what are these boys her wife that was pregnant in verse 19. you said Italian foreign and Phineas are dead and the Ark of God is taken yeah and it came to Pastor when he mentioned the Ark of God that he had fell off the seat backwards by the side of the gate and his neck broke and he died and he was an old man and heavy and he had judged Israel 40 years and now his Hope was not no longer in the priesthood our hope is no longer here in the denomination the hope of the people of Israel was not in the priesthood anymore he was in the prophet Samuel our hope is nominations are these denominations today it's in the message that the prophet brought us foreign to be delivered and when she heard the Titan titans of the Ark of God was taken and her father-in-law her husband were dead she bowed herself and traveled for her pains Came Upon her yeah and about the time of her death the woman that stood by her said unto fear fear not for thou has borne a son but she answered not neither did she regard it is and she named the child Ichabod saying the glory from Israel because the Ark of God was taken and because her father-in-law and her husband is and he said the glory is departed from Israel for the Ark of God is taken said the name in English as it says in English the glory of God is departed from this place The Silo from Shiloh foreign suicidad it says and to send all these dirty filthy things and fashion things to even foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away do you find churches and sepals and so forth Asics the way you do it remember one day you'll be laying at the bottom of the sea it is you're a great honeycomb under right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath how much longer he will hold this Sandbar hanging out over that cuando Luciano this is when the ocean a mile deep will slide in there Plumbing back to the Salton Sea Ultimo Dia de pompea it'll be worse in the last day of Pompeii Los Angeles Christ let the people shake themselves tonight and flee from the raft that is to come because Road over the doors and over the Nations was lit foreign the spirit of God is grieved away from it repeated itself again with drunken parties half dressed women calling themselves Christians you see what happened to Shiloh Los Angeles it's going to happen to Los Angeles there's a prophecy Babylonia against Babylon it says this an apocalypse is in Revelations 18 21. like a great milestone and casted in the sea saying thus with violence thou shall great City Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all how many know that that took place in the time of brother Branham 1964 in Tucson in Tucson he picks up a rock he tells the rest of the brothers that are with him he says because you're about to see God's glory and he throws the rock there comes a whirlwind so he could tell them what that signify foreign [Music] musicians and Pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in the no Craftsman whatsoever can be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of Milestone shall be heard no more at all indeed actors all kinds of entertainment a lot of artists muchos a lot of musicians muchos a lot of actors being in they come from there is the Hollywood because that's where Hollywood is [Music] and that's exactly California this is in the light of a candle shall no more shine at all indeed in Los Angeles because in Los Angeles is where the seventh Candlestick was lit we said the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall no longer be heard no more for the merchants for the Great Men of the earth and for thy sorceries were all nations deceived yes okay and that's the problem just said in the message choosing of a bride let's go okay let's go to Revelations 4. yeah we're gonna skip that it's right there okay we just showed that this oil is this Candlestick can be perverted because it's here on Earth and they pervert the original message to pervert the message you limit the power of the Holy Spirit but if you show it exactly the same way the way the messenger showed it because the message received it from God you have the Seven original candlesticks but you still are subject to the Earth because this Candlestick is here on Earth we want to go in a Rapture because this oil is going to help you here on Earth it's an oil limited to time of the ego is a prophet is the anointing ego anointing is for all the age for the Believers those that will not pervert the original light it's in the tapes foreign Stone and he was there rainbow round about the throne and the sight like an old Emerald you see the the aspect of the rainbow is emeralda Emerald this is the color of the Holy Spirit the rainbow was a complete rainbow it was a complete circle in other words because the Eternal is without beginning Without End the heavens and the Earth that's the same oil this is the color of the Holy Spirit which is a green yellow say that this is the color of the pillar of fire is about green a greenish yellow color which is Emerald or Amber [Music] reservoir of oil without beginning or Without End aura is given to us in this day cuando when when the seals were open as the seals were open the oil was released right now it's something that's in your heart right now in your heart you could have the two Graces where are you going to find it only in this message because only in this message shows all of the words and it's fullness but it is perverted don't let them deceive you by the appearance just because they have oil you should listen to a message of brother Brandon peaches the anointed ones in the end time see we have a clean oil pure is a complete circle to them this message has the eternal light oil that allows you to believe every word in the Bible it was in apocalypses yes in Revelations 10 is where that oil comes I'm going to show it to you okay do you say be this and there is it and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven no we're here physically in the seventh Church the seventh Church ages already condemned but we have the light of the eighth age because these seven are Earthly it has to come from the heavens because the Eternal oil is in the heavens so who is the eighth messenger it's this Cloud here nobody else nobody else will give you the oil that you need it only comes from this Cloud This Cloud is our eighth messenger not any man yeah amen verse two this is and he had in his hand a little book and he said it right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth we see in verse it's the same book that we just read in Jeremiah has a part that's open that's a part that's still and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to the heavens it says the Grace Covenant Grace Covenant says when you make a covenanto you have to do I swear oh gotta have an oath there has to be a second oh yes go ahead and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever you created the Heaven and things and the Earth [Music] that there should be time no longer after the seven lights a complete circle without beginning Without End but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished and he has declared to his servants the prophets he said that the time would be no more symbolism symbolizing that he was entering into eternity but in the 70 he says but in the days because it's an eternal message comes to a place to people that are still in time what are the teachings according to the eighth is symbolizes eternity it's in the future the future home but we're going to read it in paragraph to 20. 219 Nissan you see there's no such thing as eight days so you go back to the first day again see the first day movie see the old past and all seven days past Jesus Jesus raised on the eighth day it was a solemn day in order and it wasn't there because the day and time it had run out they passed into eternity see Nuevo they swung right back to the first day again see eternity is like a ring you can't find the corner to it you can't find no Stompy place to it see this message of this cloud is eternal is is a noise there's no such thing as eight days in a week what does eight mean it takes you back to the first day you literally go back to the first day Los primeros versus go back to the first verses of the Bible in Genesis 1 1 you say dios Los Cielos he says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth by the one that made the heavens and the Earth in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and it said the Earth was that without form and void is the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light was good God divided the light from the darkness you and there was life foreign eternal according to the spoken word says is exactly to the scriptures that was in the first day that it's possible in their lives I'm going to close with this when he speaks about sister Hattie Wright it says the message my new ministry in paragraph 179 it says and that's super anointing it swept over me tell Harry that she found Grace in the sight of God while Gracia what Grace the grace that was we can have faith by this gift into existence speak it into existence now I'm sure you all could see what it is it's a coming of a greater deepen anointing of the Holy Spirit how do you get into it I don't know the only thing that I know it takes God to put you into it so you just live sweet and humble and as close to God as you can don't doubt it just believe that everything is working just to the good I want to say this I guess I wonder why you got up and walked out of the house as quick as I did I have been with 30 000 heathens were saved at one time Africa South Africa they come to Christ I thought that was the greatest anointing that I had ever felt is compare what happened down at George Wright the other day I've never felt anything like that the whole room just seemed to be just the light of the glory of God there was only two kids that were saved but the other oil was a Priestly this is eternal oil it's the same oil it's the same oil used in the beginning through the spoken word foreign but it's only for mature people that believe if you don't believe you're limiting yourself if you believe dios they will allow you to use that power because God's uh the god already knew okay would ask for the right thing he even tempted her a little bit you want some money but she asked for the right thing because she was a mature person madures it was required for that oil would you please stand we are in the eighth age Celestial oil Eternal oil [Music] eternal you require that oil you won't find another a cleaner oil then the oil of this message escape the Great Tribulation we just finished the seven churches ages yes and this is a message involves the man that's been going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll be in that church age the church age that's Eternal at the end of the seals [Music] we want to thank you for your infinite and mercies [Music] that you have given us in this day Lord you have released an oil you ever released an anointing over these people and as you believe the anointing anoint our hearts to believe that everything is possible it doesn't matter how long it takes we have enough oil I have more than enough oil that will help us for those that do not have the oil there is the time of Mercy to be filled with that oil this message has an eternal oil and it has the two
