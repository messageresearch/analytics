[2:06] my brother William Marion Branham was
[2:09] delivered Tuesday evening December 6
[2:11] 1960 at the Branham Tabernacle in
[2:14] Jeffersonville Indiana USA
[2:17] Elementary
[2:21] in English
[2:31] Jeffersonville Indiana
[2:35] now the second Church age was called The
[2:39] Church age of somernia
[2:42] and it taken place the samuria age was
[2:47] issued in at the same time the Ephesian
[2:50] age went out
[2:52] this Ephesian age was from 80 55 to
[2:59] 8170. the Smyrna Age come in at 170 and
[3:03] goes to 312.
[3:05] is
[3:21] this
[3:27] church is the persecuted Church
[3:30] the one that wears the martyr's crown
[3:34] is a church of tribulation
[3:37] and God's promise to to the elected
[3:41] Church in it was to give it a Crown of
[3:43] Life is
[3:54] hidden Asia foreign
[4:01] God's hand which represent the messenger
[4:04] to that church age
[4:07] the best that I could think was the
[4:10] messenger at the Ephesian Church age
[4:12] because the Bible does not say who they
[4:14] are
[4:15] was Paul travisia
[4:25] connection
[4:32] because he established the Ephesian
[4:35] Church
[4:35] and was the minister of that church age
[4:38] that brought the light to the church
[4:40] with Saint John picked it up from there
[4:43] and then pull a carton on down Apollo
[4:45] cart rather on down
[4:50] [Music]
[4:55] age
[5:03] I believe with all the and I have been
[5:06] able to find was ireneous
[5:10] and now I want to give you the reason
[5:15] why that I chose arenas
[5:19] instead of polar
[5:24] cards
[5:33] now most all clergyman wants to think
[5:37] and Bible teaches that that angel was
[5:40] palakar
[5:42] a pop cart was a disciple of Saint John
[5:46] that is true
[5:47] and apologize sealed he was a martyr
[5:50] they stabbed him out of the heart and
[5:51] killed him
[5:55] is
[6:09] now but he was a great man and no
[6:13] affordable man a Godly Man sweet no
[6:16] doubt one of the great best Christians
[6:19] we've ever had
[6:20] and there was nothing you could say
[6:22] against his life
[6:37] the reason that I chose Arrhenius
[6:41] because I believe at Arenas was
[6:44] more closer to the scripture than public
[6:47] art was
[6:48] because Apollo Court leaned kindly
[6:52] towards the Roman idea of setting up an
[6:56] organization
[6:57] and and Aurelius was firmly against it
[7:02] he absolutely denounced it now
[7:08] carpo
[7:16] lescent organizations
[7:26] and then as we all know the great issue
[7:29] was coming at the niacin Council
[7:32] one of the great issues was whether God
[7:35] was three Our God was one
[7:39] and Arrhenius took the side that God was
[7:42] God
[7:44] now in just one is
[8:01] I might read from the ananiasing fathers
[8:06] volume 1 page 412 just a little
[8:09] quotation if you want to put that down
[8:11] volume one of the ice Nicene fathers
[8:15] and on page 12.
[8:19] and it's uh if you want the volume it's
[8:22] the last part of volume three
[8:41] you might read the whole thing is
[8:43] several uh chapters of it or several
[8:46] um sentences
[8:49] now begin to read write the last
[8:51] brought the last 20 30 verses of it I
[8:56] won't read it all but just part of it is
[9:11] all the other Expressions likewise being
[9:16] bring out the title of one and the same
[9:21] being see he's trying to say what they
[9:23] call him father son Holy Ghost they said
[9:26] that's titles
[9:28] not names
[9:30] titles of the one being
[9:33] that's exactly what we teach here today
[9:36] results
[10:00] as for the example and then inferences
[10:03] in English
[10:05] the Lord of power
[10:07] the Lord father of
[10:10] Almighty most high
[10:13] Creator the maker and such like these
[10:18] are not the names and titles
[10:21] of succession of different beings but of
[10:25] one and the same amen
[10:29] foreign
[10:34] the example and then in for instance in
[10:36] English
[10:38] the Lord of power
[10:40] the Lord father of all God Almighty most
[10:45] high
[10:45] Creator the maker and such like these
[10:51] are not the names and titles
[10:54] of succession of different beings but of
[10:58] one and the same amen
[11:22] El mismo
[11:24] amen by the name of which the one God
[11:28] father is he
[11:31] He Who all these things Grant to all it
[11:36] of its existence the boom of all
[11:38] existence foreign
[11:55] that all these titles are summed up into
[11:59] one name under one God
[12:03] and they are only titles of what he was
[12:07] he was
[12:10] The Rose of Sharon
[12:12] that's what he was that's the title he
[12:15] was the Morning Star
[12:17] he was Alpha he was Omega that's titles
[12:22] of what he was he was father he was son
[12:25] he was Holy Ghost it is
[12:52] but there's one God
[12:55] one God in his name is one
[12:59] and that's one reason I thought Arenas
[13:02] was correct in his in his diagnosis your
[13:06] interpretation of the scripture
[13:12] yes
[13:21] another thing that I'd like to read you
[13:24] it's found in the book
[13:27] how did it happen
[13:30] and this is by the historians and um
[13:34] how did it happen by R.C Hazelton the
[13:37] history of the early churches
[13:39] and here on page 180 the spiritual
[13:43] in Irene is this time A.D
[13:48] 177-202 a reason I'm quoting this is
[13:51] going on tape you see and and it'll be
[13:54] taken off on books
[14:32] that the most of the Apostolic Church
[15:06] it was not uncommon to see someone dead
[15:11] brought back to life
[15:15] healing was
[15:18] healing wise and every day occurrence
[15:21] and all the Evangelist Evangelical
[15:24] churches everywhere
[15:41] as parties
[15:47] Miracles were frequent in fact those
[15:51] churches
[15:52] were never without a miraculous
[15:55] manifestation of God's presence
[15:58] either by Vision Superstition are the
[16:02] elements of nature in a miracle to
[16:04] remind the Evangelical Christians of
[16:07] that day
[16:10] there was his beloved disciples
[16:16] is
[16:36] but from the histories of the past we
[16:41] cannot glean a single instance of
[16:45] raising the dead in the first Roman
[16:48] Church
[16:52] that's people that don't not interested
[16:54] in either side they're just telling the
[16:56] truth it's historians Romana
[17:08] Jesus
[17:16] that's why I think Arenas because you
[17:19] see he
[17:20] had
[17:22] faith that Paul and the disciples had
[17:26] handed down
[17:27] that's why I have believed that he was
[17:30] the angel of the Church of someranian
[17:35] because he was he had the same
[17:39] scriptural teachings and the same
[17:42] scriptural teachings upon the basis of
[17:45] God's word will produce the same thing
[17:48] every time
[17:53] transmitido
[17:59] Foreigner
[18:19] and carried out to the letter no matter
[18:21] what the church is say just follow it
[18:23] just the way it says it'll produce the
[18:25] same thing
[18:26] and that's what arenius did so you stay
[18:29] this is
[18:45] now I think that Paula carte was a fine
[18:49] man understand but I say that he leaned
[18:51] too much to organize the church and like
[18:54] the Nickelodeon's was doing
[19:05] they were organized in the church and
[19:08] and bringing a Brotherhood together
[19:10] which seems all right intellectually
[19:13] but you see the spirit is so far ahead
[19:16] of the intellectual so that you can't
[19:18] even think right to the spirit this is
[19:38] my hot thoughts are higher than your
[19:41] thoughts saith God my ways are higher
[19:43] than your ways so there's only one way
[19:46] to do that just follow him by the
[19:48] blueprint
[19:49] that's right
[20:06] she is now we might think if you was
[20:09] going from Europe I was going uh to
[20:12] Chicago tonight oh I might be out here
[20:14] get me a compass and say now let's see
[20:16] Chicago right this way all right I'll
[20:19] take right off I wouldn't get out of
[20:20] Jeffersonville
[20:39] the Jeffersonville Ben I got to get me a
[20:42] road man
[20:43] and it's a way lined out and I can go to
[20:47] Chicago
[20:49] to seven hours of travel by automobile
[20:51] but I can't just cut anyway
[21:07] the airplane just can't cut anyway he's
[21:10] got a
[21:12] certain height
[21:15] a certain degrees
[21:17] that he has to stay in there's a way
[21:19] made and God has a way foreign
[21:37] God has a way for his church for his
[21:40] people and he never did intended to be
[21:43] controlled by popes Cardinals Archbishop
[21:46] or general overseers the holy spirit is
[21:49] the tutor of the Church of the Living
[21:51] God the reasons
[22:12] and all the Holiness don't go to a car
[22:15] signal or a priest to make him a holy
[22:18] manner in the church anything the laity
[22:21] is Justice right much right to the Holy
[22:24] Spirit as any preacher pastor
[22:27] Deacon trustee whatever more
[22:30] laity today
[22:40] Direction
[22:52] they call it nickel Ladies as we had
[22:56] last night Nickel in we broke the word
[22:58] down took it from the Greek and in i c k
[23:01] o
[23:03] which means to conquer or to
[23:09] overthrows what
[23:26] nickel lady laity
[23:29] to conquer the laity and overthrow it by
[23:33] giving them a order of man clergyman
[23:36] that would teach them and would uh they
[23:40] would get their own conclusions together
[23:42] okay
[23:58] that's how the United Council was held
[24:02] they caused many
[24:03] other and fixed up uh an order in the
[24:07] Nicene Council we ain't going to talk
[24:09] too much on it because that's Thursday
[24:10] nights in the Nicene council
[24:18] is
[24:28] where the Roman Catholic Church was
[24:31] formed out of a group of people that
[24:34] were converts of Saint Paul and Arenas
[24:38] and Saint Martin and on down
[24:42] foreign
[24:51] they were converted Christians to the
[24:55] from paganism over to Christianity but
[24:59] wanted to pull the church back into an
[25:03] Old Testament form of ministry like
[25:06] having high priests and and Apostolic
[25:09] successions like one Pope John
[25:11] christianismo
[25:31] if we could go on down to this Bible
[25:34] you'd find out that that's just exactly
[25:37] the truth and how God condemned the
[25:38] thing from the very beginning in last
[25:40] night's Church they said I hated him so
[25:42] did the churches
[26:00] God never intended the church to be run
[26:03] by man amen God runs his church
[26:06] and he runs it through gifts
[26:09] of the spirit the gifts of the Spirit is
[26:12] in the church to correct the spiritombre
[26:29] minister of officers in his church first
[26:32] of them is Apostles or missionaries
[26:35] missionary is the highest calling there
[26:37] is Apostle a word missionary means one
[26:41] cent Apostle means one sin while they
[26:43] ever chose to be called a missionary I
[26:45] don't know but they are Apostles
[26:55] a
[26:59] Apostles
[27:10] all right Apostles prophets teachers
[27:14] evangelists pastors now that's the
[27:17] elected offices of God to his church
[27:24] evangelistas pastores
[27:30] then in each local church there's nine
[27:34] spiritual gifts that come among the
[27:36] people that is knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[27:40] healing working of Miracles speaking
[27:42] with tongues interpretation of tongues
[27:44] and all these things go in each
[28:08] and every person in the church has an
[28:12] individual Ministry
[28:15] and that individual Ministry
[28:18] goes together with the rest of the
[28:20] ministry to edify the body of Jesus
[28:23] Christo
[28:36] and never I remember this
[28:39] I'll draw these times tonight the first
[28:42] church Ephesus somernia pergos
[28:51] Philadelphia Philadelphia
[29:04] pergamo the atira Sardis Philadelphia
[29:10] now remember as this goes on this church
[29:14] has the fullness of the spirit
[29:17] but at the end of the church age we find
[29:20] that it was being pressed out is
[29:37] a little more
[29:39] so this one they were just a little
[29:41] teeny Speck
[29:44] you have a few things he said oh when we
[29:47] get to that tatara church age
[30:06] God raised up a German by the name of
[30:10] Martin Luther that swung the church back
[30:12] again
[30:13] it started out a little more he preached
[30:16] justification a long-com Martin Luther
[30:19] reached justification
[30:29] foreign
[30:38] sanctification
[30:40] then in this church age here they come
[30:44] right straight back again to the baptism
[30:46] of the Holy Ghost again with the same
[30:48] signs and wonders coming right down Juan
[30:51] Wesley predication
[30:54] is
[31:06] here's where it went out to 1500 years
[31:08] of Dark Ages and there's where the
[31:12] darkest and the longest church period we
[31:14] had in the church
[31:25] then here's where it starts coming out
[31:28] justification sanctification baptism the
[31:31] Holy Ghost and the Bible says that in
[31:33] the end of this age that this little
[31:37] minority here will be squeezed down
[31:39] because the same church of Pentecost
[31:41] will start doing the same thing they
[31:43] started back there Nickelodeon Greg
[31:46] wacky isanto
[31:54] is
[32:09] [Music]
[32:17] you that the messenger to this church
[32:20] Angel hate denominations amen
[32:24] amen appear to raise up in the children
[32:26] there's always been
[32:28] boom
[32:30] um
[32:50] we gotta now if you notice this how it
[32:53] was greater when I finally smothered it
[32:56] all the way out then it starts back
[32:58] Luther pulled it back justification
[33:01] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[33:03] and right at the end time he Smothers it
[33:06] right down until this is almost
[33:09] completely gone out yeah
[33:41] [Music]
[33:43] didn't say there will be no flesh saved
[33:48] see there you are right at the end time
[33:51] now bear that in mind
[33:55] yes
[34:09] now we're going to start on this uh
[34:12] samarnia Church age
[34:14] first I want to break it down here on
[34:16] some paper that I that I have
[34:19] now the second Church age being simonia
[34:23] and I believe you'll all agree with me
[34:27] or hope you do or halfway anyhow that
[34:31] iridius was the star to that church age
[34:55] he was God's messenger because he swept
[34:58] the country in the France Gall down in
[35:01] there and he established
[35:03] has shown the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[35:05] speaking in tongues raising the dead
[35:07] Healing The Sick
[35:08] stopping the rains and Performing
[35:10] Miracles daily they know that the Living
[35:12] God lived among the people
[35:16] is
[35:37] that was a man of God Amen Lord Jesus
[35:41] said no man can do the the people said
[35:43] no man can do these works except God be
[35:45] with him it was Nicodemus that told
[35:47] Jesus that is
[35:59] now
[36:03] a city of Commerce
[36:05] a Trading Outlet to Lydia and to the
[36:08] West
[36:10] the third largest city in Asia
[36:13] a great Harbor City
[36:15] in ordered for wealth temples buildings
[36:18] schools medicine and science
[36:35] edificios escuelas medicine
[36:39] Jews leave that at Samira they
[36:42] evangelize the Samaritan
[36:45] people
[36:46] power card was the first Bishop of
[36:49] Samaria
[36:50] power card and other Faithful Servants
[36:52] establish the Deep faith of God in the
[36:55] believing Samaritans
[36:57] early church fathers give exhortation of
[36:59] the truth to Samaria is
[37:21] the church age of Samaritan
[37:24] the name of the church was
[37:26] Samira Samaria rather that means uh
[37:31] bitterness
[37:35] mura It's associated with dead
[37:38] because they were dying
[37:46] significa Mira
[37:50] [Music]
[37:54] A persecuted church God called him
[37:57] persecuted
[37:58] God looked upon their persecutions
[38:01] and gave Grace to bear
[38:04] he looked upon his tribulations and gave
[38:07] them victory over death
[38:09] looked upon their poverty and give them
[38:12] riches in him
[38:16] is
[38:32] the Church of someria passed through the
[38:35] fiery furnace of tribulations but was a
[38:39] sweet smelling savior unto him
[38:50] that's that Remnant now not the old
[38:52] simonian church just a Remnant I'm
[38:55] speaking of
[38:57] the great 10 days of tribulation means
[39:00] 10 years of the bloodiest persecution
[39:09] is
[39:16] pronounce or not this was the emperor at
[39:19] that time I believe was the bloodiest
[39:21] one of all of them since Nero in 67.
[39:24] d-i-o-c-l-e-t-i-n
[39:31] during the year of 303
[39:34] to 312 A.D no says
[39:41] oh
[39:50] is
[39:55] God exhorts
[39:58] to be faithful unto them as he was
[40:02] and I will give you a Crown of Life
[40:05] as the father has given me
[40:07] God promised the overcomer
[40:10] in tribulations the victory over the
[40:12] second death
[40:14] fear not them which can kill the body
[40:16] but he that can destroy the silver kill
[40:19] the soul is
[40:47] fear not man and a crown of life will be
[40:50] given you
[40:51] the persecution of Christianity in the
[40:54] ages are typed in the church ages of
[40:57] Samira are very important we want to get
[41:00] to it just a little bit Lord willing
[41:03] Jesus
[41:12] is now
[41:22] if some of you missed some of these if I
[41:24] write them a little too fast for the
[41:26] rest of the class then we um we are you
[41:30] can certainly get them from us anytime
[41:31] you want to we'd be glad to to give them
[41:34] to you
[41:35] excuse me is
[41:52] is
[41:53] now
[41:55] on the second chapter
[41:59] and the eighth verse We Begin tonight
[42:01] now what did we leave him on last night
[42:04] he was certainly hated that Nickelodeon
[42:08] is that rhyme
[42:10] Ocho
[42:14] monsters
[42:24] now what does God do what we have to
[42:27] found out first the revelation of Jesus
[42:30] Christ who he is and what he is
[42:33] now the next great thing we find out
[42:35] that he hates anything that'll put
[42:39] anything to rule over his church besides
[42:42] himself
[42:44] he is a jealous God hold on
[42:58] importante
[43:01] is
[43:12] how I like this stuff because we just
[43:15] got four verses here just a quote a
[43:18] little something how many can remember
[43:20] when the good prophet Samuel when all of
[43:24] Israel wanted to act like the rest of
[43:27] the world you remember that
[43:29] foreign
[43:46] the prophet told them said you're wrong
[43:49] but they wanted to act like the
[43:51] Philistines and like the the rest of
[43:53] them well that's exactly what happened
[43:56] in this very first church age
[44:13] it's strange that people don't want God
[44:16] to lead them
[44:17] they want to fight they want some man
[44:21] Israel made the greatest mistake it ever
[44:23] made
[44:24] when Grace had already provided them a
[44:27] prophet a leader provide them a lamb as
[44:30] an atonement and provided them food from
[44:33] the heavens and all the good things that
[44:36] Grace had provided them is
[45:04] and still in Exodus 19 they wanted a law
[45:09] they want to make doctors of divinity
[45:11] and as men they won't have something to
[45:13] do into it too yeah
[45:19] hombres
[45:26] man's always trying to outsmart the very
[45:29] creative
[45:34] as a few Sundays ago I preached on the
[45:37] um the hybrid religion that's exactly
[45:41] when you hybrid anything it can never
[45:43] it's done it's finished
[45:45] you can't come back no more hello
[45:55] universe
[46:09] a mule can never breathe back and have
[46:12] another Mew because he is a Mew he's a
[46:16] hybrid find corn you can't raise fine
[46:19] corn off a fine hybrid corn it won't
[46:21] even it might come up as well it's no
[46:24] good at all
[46:25] you can't do it anything is hybrid's no
[46:27] good reproduces
[46:50] in a hybrid religion is no good
[46:53] as long as you're trying to add
[46:55] something to what God Said or do
[46:58] something that God don't want you to do
[46:59] it's a hybrid religion
[47:01] is
[47:11] it might look pretty or hybrid corn will
[47:15] outshine the natural corn
[47:17] an old mule outworked two horses
[47:20] well that's it ain't working brother
[47:22] it's Grace that we're thinking about
[47:24] not by works are we say it but by Grace
[47:26] natural
[47:35] s
[47:39] is
[47:45] so that might I hope you don't think
[47:48] these remarks you're you're sitting
[47:49] under strain and I feel it up here see
[47:51] because there's Presbyterian methodists
[47:54] in all kinds and here we know that and
[47:57] uh so I feel it you have to relax
[47:59] yourself a little once in a while get
[48:01] that shake-off point
[48:03] era is
[48:06] observations
[48:28] now listen
[48:31] and he thinks hybrid is no good you've
[48:33] got to take the original way God made it
[48:35] then you've got something as real amen
[48:39] foreign
[48:52] that this Church of Israel as they
[48:56] passed on God had fed them and taken
[48:59] care of them and done everything for
[49:00] them and finally they looked over to the
[49:03] Philistines and the amorites and the in
[49:06] different ones and said we want a king
[49:08] they got something we ain't got
[49:12] Israel mientes
[49:32] that's the same thing the people does
[49:34] today
[49:36] uh one of these our sisters well look
[49:39] over at the television and see Glory
[49:42] Swanson or whoever some of them women
[49:44] with a certain kind of address on and
[49:46] they just can't stand it till they get
[49:47] one
[49:48] see this is
[50:06] some woman down there oh isn't that
[50:08] darling
[50:10] what you wear
[50:14] I said it's a day of of uh impersonation
[50:20] somebody wants to impersonate the other
[50:22] Centro
[50:24] honest
[50:33] personification
[50:37] you take the there's so many Elvis
[50:40] Presleys now I'll tell you couldn't sack
[50:43] them up in boxcars because he become
[50:46] popular
[50:47] carnal comp uh impersonations we have
[50:50] the same thing in religion
[50:52] is
[51:07] that I've read the history of Martin
[51:09] Luther and any historians though they
[51:11] said it wasn't a mysterious thing that
[51:13] Luther could protest the Catholic church
[51:15] and get by with it but the greatest
[51:16] mystery to get to hold his head above
[51:18] all the fanaticism that followed his
[51:20] Revival and still stay with the word
[51:22] that's the miracle how God kept him
[51:25] clear and straight is
[51:55] so they come to this Samuel they said
[51:58] make us a problem make us a a king
[52:01] and the Lord told him that he rejected
[52:04] that idea just exactly what he rejected
[52:06] here with organization
[52:10] is
[52:23] just like he rejected that
[52:27] he rejects organizations he don't reject
[52:31] organism
[52:32] but organization
[52:35] organism we have to have that but
[52:37] organization we don't have to have
[52:39] because it draws lines
[52:58] we are so and so are you a Christian I'm
[53:01] Methodist are you Christian I'm Baptist
[53:03] that don't mean no more than a pig in a
[53:06] pen it has nothing to do with it not at
[53:09] all
[53:10] a Christian
[53:14] o
[53:15] list
[53:27] that's the girl one night on the
[53:29] platform are you a Christian she said
[53:31] I'll give you to understand our burner
[53:33] candle every night
[53:35] like that had anything to do with
[53:36] Christianity foreign
[53:52] [Music]
[53:56] not a thing you're a Christian because
[53:58] you belong to another kingdom
[54:00] that's right
[54:02] and you're you're in another kingdom
[54:05] above poses
[54:18] now
[54:23] what did Samuel do just the same thing
[54:27] Samuel
[54:30] cough he said now listen to me I want to
[54:32] ask you something has there ever been
[54:35] one time
[54:36] that I ever told you anything that
[54:38] wasn't true
[54:44] is
[54:56] God's Prophet among you tell me one time
[55:00] I ever told you anything in the name of
[55:01] the Lord that didn't come to pass
[55:04] that's what Samuel said to me
[55:06] because
[55:18] he said and hasn't got virgin taking
[55:22] care of you and all these things
[55:27] say oh
[55:29] element
[55:34] is
[55:41] something else have I ever took any
[55:43] money away from you have I ever begged
[55:45] you for an offering or have I ever told
[55:48] you anything in the name of the Lord it
[55:49] didn't come to pass
[55:51] they said no you never took our money
[55:53] that's true and you've never told us
[55:55] anything in the name of the Lord that
[55:57] didn't come to pass
[56:17] he said then hear me
[56:19] you're sitting but trying to act like
[56:22] the rest of them
[56:24] but they want the king anyhow
[56:27] regardless what is right or wrong they
[56:28] want to carry out their idea
[56:32] says
[56:46] that's the same thing the church did
[56:48] right here at Ephesus
[56:50] they've taken the Nickelodeon Doctrine
[56:53] and when they did it
[56:55] convert paganism and Christianity
[56:58] together and it's caused a 1500 years of
[57:00] Dark Ages and when Luther pulled them
[57:03] out if the second round the lutherans
[57:05] didn't do the same thing they did back
[57:07] in Ephesus anyway
[57:09] exactly it's amazing
[57:14] this is
[57:40] now if you notice the candlesticks
[57:42] didn't sit quite like that they started
[57:44] down in this way come on well the
[57:47] highest one away from where he was
[57:48] standing was this one up here is
[58:03] and Christianity gradually smothered out
[58:07] as it went from where he was standing
[58:09] across we would see him in the fourth
[58:10] chapter and the shape of the Cross like
[58:13] this and this is his right hand that was
[58:15] his left hand Christian is
[58:32] now right here he had his hand on this
[58:35] church and on that church he was both
[58:38] Alpha and Omega of course all was in
[58:41] between the two all the other letters
[58:43] but he specifically said Alpha and Omega
[58:46] he had a rainbow over his head which was
[58:48] his Covenant
[58:52] is
[59:09] now if you notice the light of Pentecost
[59:13] where it started gradually smothered out
[59:15] these men Arenas polycar all the rest of
[59:19] them seal their testimony with their
[59:21] blood until it finally squeezed
[59:24] Christianity into the dark as it is
[59:45] the first age the other side of that
[59:48] great Hub coming over was a little bit
[59:50] alike more light and more light
[59:54] you see how it begins to shine again
[59:55] coming unto that day
[59:57] and now at the end of this age it's
[59:59] predicted here that it comes to a lady
[1:00:02] oh seeing a lukewarm now what I'm eating
[1:00:11] must lose a
[1:00:19] foreign
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:38] yeah and you know the Bible said there'd
[1:00:41] be a beast and we know that's a Roman
[1:00:43] papacy
[1:00:44] that's exactly right
[1:01:06] then they
[1:01:13] would origin of churches
[1:01:15] cost us in it it'll come a time where
[1:01:18] you'll either belong to an organization
[1:01:20] you can't keep your door open right
[1:01:37] organizations
[1:01:44] verdad
[1:01:48] it's the reason we pound it to death
[1:01:50] yeah yes sir you and evil well other
[1:01:53] than that they'll try to seek you so
[1:01:54] badly to try to won't let you bite or
[1:01:56] sell this you've got that organization
[1:01:59] it brings it right
[1:02:01] questions
[1:02:18] foreign
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:03:03] the Bible
[1:03:21] thank you
[1:03:41] a little more across between every one
[1:03:44] of you
[1:03:46] right
[1:03:52] we want to welcome you to Jericho
[1:03:53] tabernac
[1:04:02] stop in San Diego dress
[1:04:04] I was thinking in the back
[1:04:08] of how little of us are here
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:16] not reflection
[1:04:18] but then I begin to reflect a bit
[1:04:21] OS that were not so little
[1:04:26] yes because each and every one of us is
[1:04:29] worth more than ten thousand worlds
[1:04:32] so then if we multiply it
[1:04:35] is
[1:04:36] the church is pretty full
[1:04:41] so I don't think we should be
[1:04:43] disappointed by that
[1:04:47] that was preached by a Galleria
[1:04:50] to a Samaritan is
[1:04:56] a woman put a revolution in that City
[1:05:02] so it may be that we might have a
[1:05:05] gallery in here we don't know
[1:05:09] it could be that there's a Samaritan
[1:05:12] here
[1:05:16] maybe uh Roy Murray
[1:05:23] so then we're going to continue on this
