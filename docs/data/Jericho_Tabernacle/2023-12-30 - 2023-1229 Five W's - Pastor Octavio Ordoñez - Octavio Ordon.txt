Christ amen amen you please open your your Bibles we're still celebrating Christmas although it's uh December 29th I thought we'd uh look into Christmas just once more you know when you're when you write an essay or or or a project uh or a report you you have to write something that's called the five W's at least that's what I remember back in when I was in high school who what where when and [Music] why who what where when [Music] why the five W's of christmasen let's look at Luke 1 verse 26 the birth of Jesus foretold Luke 1:26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast as in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold th shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his Kingdom and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not amen and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold I cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the hand made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen thank the musicians may be seated for with God nothing shall be impossible I like the response of Mary be it unto me according to Thy word the best thing we can do is believe his word and do his work be it unto me according to his word I like that that's what Mary did and she's known throughout history because she believed the angel of the Lord and she was willing to do the will of God that's who now what now we're going to go from what man was before the Jesus Christ was born to when he was born and to the condition that we're in right now now let's look forward to the condition that we are right now we're really good at trying to condemn people let's see what brother Braham says about that and let's see what Jesus did for the people now Luke 2 uh verse 1- 17 Jesus Christ was born of a virgin and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made by uh cras was governor of Syria and now went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the House of and the lineage of DAV to be taxed with Mary his spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in SW swaddling clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the end so Mary after believing she gave birth to a child in 1949 uh December 25th brother bran preached a message called the deity of Jesus Christ on line 37 it says we are today all over the world is being celebrated the birth of Jesus which is which now is just a tradition or traditional Jesus was not born on December the 5th or nothing like or December the 25th we know that's impossible the hills of Juda was full of snow at the time so how could it be that Jesus commonly by astrology so forth and by all of it was born first around first of April so when it was springtime but this is a day which is all right just set aside to Worship in Memorial of his coming of the world so we as Christians we celebrate that knowing it's not uh December 25th but we we celebrate it we have children we have grandchildren and they want to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ difference is we don't tell them of uh Santa Claus or anything like that we tell them the word and their children we must understand that one of the greatest gifts that God ever gave to the world was Jesus Christ that we know that and I want to speak this morning upon the his deity who he is so many has him as a little baby laying out out there in in the cradle and so forth but that was just one of the pictures just one of the settings sport of the drama to bring it up to what he really is he deity and he said in the scriptures of his coming he will he would been spoke of since the days of John Plum back even into Genesis it was prophesized that the woman's seed would bruise the Serpent's head Genesis 3:15 promised this child child uh Christ Jesus and he has been down all all the prophets most every Prophet that was ever wrote in the Bible spoke of his first and second Advent when he will come to the world Jesus comes three times he came the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church he comes the third time with this church everything in the Bible travels in trinities threes but all in one Christ he remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive his church the third time with his church as king and queen see man had fallen from Adam throughout history man was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking Liv Psalm 515 and Psalm 583 man was lost out of the will of God he needed help he could not live up to the laws Moses laws that were given back in Exodus man needed help man needed help from himself he was in sin and he had no way back to [Music] God God by his for knowledge provided a lamb a sacrifice and atonement for [Music] man Jesus was born as a lamb a gift offering unto man for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life I've told that to the youth I test the youth I want the youth to never forget that never forget that scripture John 3:16 for God sent not his son unto the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God Romans 56 for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man one will die yet per adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die verse eight but God condemneth or God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconcile reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we should we shall be Sav by his [Music] life and not only so but we also join God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received atonement so reconciliation of God and humankind through Jesus Christ is the atonement now where where was he to be born you know we heard a message on Wednesday called why little Bethlehem it's a really good message that brother BR speak spoke [Music] on you should go back and listen to it when you have time but Micah 52 King James version but thou Bethlehem if though thou be little among the thousand thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel whose going forth have been from of old from Everlasting 1958 1228 why little Bethlehem brother Braham says the following line 83 and it was well represented in Jesus the beloved one years later the son of David who was to come to fulfill all things that had been promised this little city Bethlehem is where this taken place and it was on the same little judian Hills where David had hearded his sheep many years later that the angels sang their First Noel on the hills of Juda overlooking Bethlehem The First Noel unto thee is born in the city of David Christ the Lord that's Luke 211 Angels first made their appearance to sing it wasn't at Jerusalem the big church neither was it at gilo or neither was it a Shiloh where they had had the religious denominational worship all the time but it was in little bethleem where the spirit of God had been moving in mysterious ways bringing forth something it was there it was there where Christ had to come it was there it was right in the same little city with the king with a King born that a mother virgin brought forth her first son it shelter and housed in this little Fortress the king of kings and Lord of Lord for not only did Samuel come to pour out the anointing oil but God poured out upon him and upon the world remember that upon the world Christ the lord upon the world the Angels heralded his coming and sang to the Shepherds on the hillside who followed David the king years before see the mystery of God how how great it is he was born in in this great wheat belt which when wheat comes for the basic principles of life and he was the bread of life I am the bread of life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and shall never die nor come into condemnation but has PR from Death To Life John 5:24 listen how brother Braham breaks up Bethlehem the name Beth e l b e t h Beth Beth in Hebrew means house is e l stands for Elohim it's abbreviation Elohim means god Elohim b e t h Beth E L eel is Elohim which is God the house of God where the bread of life is laid e l h m finish it out Bring Back Your L again with your e means a loaf of bread in the Hebrew e l him e l is God Elohim is [Music] El is B th is bread or b e t is b e t is house e l is Elohim abbreviation then e l h e m is bread what was he the house of the bread of God the house of God's Bread House Beth Elohim God e l h e m bread the house of God's bread means Bethlehem where could he be born anywhere else but that but it was hit to everybody but the prophet he said out of Bethlehem shall come him Micah [Applause] 52 they was looking in Jerusalem there was looking in shos there was looking everywhere but he come from Bethlehem because it was a house of God's bread of life he is God's Bread Basket to the world remember that it's to the world there he was born in Bethlehem he could be born nowhere else amen amen now in the Philadelphian Church age um number eight it says number eight here so let's see what it says about David the Key of David was not David the king of Israel all Israel and is not Jesus the son of David according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of David in the Millennium and Reign and rule over his Heritage know surely the Key of David signifies that it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium he who has a keys to death hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the Earth how wonderful that our Lord has all the answers truly in him are all the promises of God fulfilled truly by being in him we are HS to what he has purchased for us yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory once as a father he was surrounded by the Angels the archangels the sheram the seraps and the whole host of Heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such was his Holiness that no man could approach him but now we see him in the church sharing his own Holiness with us until in him we have become the very righteousness of God and there he stands Jesus perfect everything the lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star the feris of 10,000 Alpha and Omega rude and offspring of David Father Son and Holy Ghost all and in all For unto us his child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace in him is perfect fulfillment though once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of Glory in the midst of the church he stands and will and we will sing his praise for he the mighty conqueror is head over the church which is his bride he bought that bride he owns her she is his and his alone and he cares for her he is our King and we are his kingdom his eternal possession in questions and answers number four in question 392 the church age ends and has blacked out the brightest is called we have already entered into the tribulation question mark no no you're I I wish I could have I could just have more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease goes into chaos the bride goes into glory and the tribulation sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and half and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets upon Israel and then comes a battle of bar which destroys all things the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the Millennium Reign after that comes a white Throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and the new Earth and the new city coming down from God out of Heaven eternity and time Blends together we're at the end time we're waiting for that Resurrection now when I'm about 2024 years ago is when Christianity began Christians have been criticized killed and maybe most of it has been by the people who profess to be Christians and today we have about a thousand different religions but God before the foundation of the world predestinated us God knew we needed a savior he provided a lamb first Peter 1:19 but with the precious blood blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish or without spot contamination who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for you Revelations 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book alive of the lamb slain be from the foundation of the world then the last question is why for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him shall not perish but have everlasting life uh in Ephesians uh the Ephesians Church we're almost done let me just read a couple more things listen listen to this real closely God's intention for his creation man is to be is to express his words Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed I like that quote a life lived by the word would be word expressed think about that for a little bit that is true is it not but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there arose Moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that Prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in Anger to obey the word and there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart he fell by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God then was Satan foiled for here was one who live by it is written and that Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word then was a manifested perfect one given to the Cross as a perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of God and now these sons of God who by him overcome and give him the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ the sons of God who overcame there will never be more be any separation from him whether he goes the bride will go what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will make be made plain and we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him oh I like that one we shall be like him this is the Heritage inheritance of the Overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony of Jesus Christ we have an inheritance waiting for us we will be with him we will be like unto him but we must live his word oey every word I like that Romans 1:16 R running out of time here for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for wherein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith if you have a scoffield Bible there's a pretty good definition there on the bottom where you have the the definitions there and he tries to explain salvation Salvation sometimes we we uh think about that word the Hebrew and Greek words for salvation imply the idea of Deliverance safety preservation healing soundness salvation is a great inclusive word of the Gospel Gathering into itself s all the Redemptive acts and processes as justification Redemption Grace propitiation imputation forgiveness sanctification and glorification salvation is in three tenses the believer has been saved from the guilt and penalty of sin the believer is being saved from the habit and domain Dominion of sin the believer is to be saved in the sense of entire Conformity to Christ there's a lot involved in Salvation now in closing I didn't write this on there but I want you to hear this story and we we talked about the world sometimes we want to condemn everyone that's not like us or don't talk like this don't dress like this um I I've talked to and talked to my daughter about this a couple of times cuz we when we see sin and we see people acting the way they act sometimes we want God to really get them you think well they they they need God needs to get them and that's not right and brother Braham has a pretty good story on this I forgive you didn't I I forgive you didn't I in 1955 0222 Jehovah Gyra in closing I want you to hear this real closely I I know I've read a lot but I know if I read we can base that on God's word the message of the hour and I believe both on line 66 I went up walked down the road to a little piece and went into an ordinary little restaurant Little Road place and when I walked in behind the door the door shut behind me real hard and I looked and there stood a policeman with his arm around the woman playing a slot machine and uh gambling is illegal in Ohio and I thought the law the very law and the man was My AG age perhaps married and had a family at home I thought oh my corruption and filth I looked back at a table back there and some young boys and a lady about a little young lady about 18 20 years old they thought they ought to been in Sunday school somewhere those boys drinking back there and oh the way they was abusing that girl and her standing there and letting them do it and I happened to look over to my right and there was an elderly woman sitting there with little old clothes on she ought to have had on real old about 65 maybe better and she had a purple makeup on her mouth and on her toenails and her arms poor old thing was flabby and her hair was boyish globed in little Kinky Curls up on it she was trying to light a cigarette drunk and two drunken men with her I thought oh God how can you look at such as that I thought my little Sarah Rebecca going to have to be raised up in a world like that God why don't you just destroy the thing take it all off I don't see how you can stand it to look at such a thing as that I was standing there criticizing her the two drunks with her got up and went out to be gone for just a while and just then I felt something moving on me I went back and sat down at a little booth on the side nobody paid any attention to me yet I was kind of dark it was kind of dark in the corner and there God gave me a vision and changed my mind and things okay do I have your attention I looked there and saw the world and around the world was looked like a red streak just as just just a spray something said this is the blood of the Lord Jesus who died to save Sinners that's the reason God can destroy he can't see her he can't every moral being has a right and has a right to accept their salvation until they die and go beyond that blood they don't have to stand in judgment they're already judged the day you eat thereof the day you die but as long as you're here you got a right to the tree of life if you'll accept it everyone has a chance what condition you're in you have an opportunity as long as you have breath to breathe you have that opportunity and he said that's your sin and I seen that blood that the blood of Jesus to my own sins was acting like a bumper if it had been if it had went beyond that stream of blood there that was around the earth when he died to settle the sin question if it have went beyond that then God would have killed me you be [Music] just like the bumper to the car to keep your car from being hurt the bumper catches the lick and the blood of Jesus Christ catches your sins father forgive them they don't know what they're doing father forgive them Luke 2334 if we can have the musicians and if you can stand the blood is there protecting each and every one of us protecting us and protecting us and protecting us line 7 the and I look there there my name laying there on an old book wrote all kinds of things condemned I crawled up to his feet and said Lord Jesus will you forgive me then I didn't mean I said you mean my sins hurt you like that said yes he took his hand and dipped it in his side took his finger and wrote across the book pardon pardon put it back behind him like that put his arms together and looked at me he said I forgive you didn't I I said yes Lord I love you for it he said but why are you you condemning her then I'm you're willing to condemn someone else but look you was condemned once yourself and freely he pardoned you that changed my motive soon I got out of the vision I walked over there to her and said Madam could I talk to you a minute she said oh I have company I said I don't mean it that way lady I'm a minister of the Gospel I want to talk to you she took her cigarette down she said yes sir I said why are you living like this I said you don't really enjoy it are you
