[1:32:15] now the prophet Isaiah a prophet that
[1:32:18] lives 700 years old before
[1:32:22] Christ in isaah CH
[1:32:25] 53 he
[1:32:27] said he was pierced for our
[1:32:32] trans rules for our
[1:32:35] iniquity and the chastisement of Peace
[1:32:39] falling upon him and by his strikes we
[1:32:44] are he that
[1:32:47] has escaped all the Corruptions of this
[1:32:51] world having Liv 33 years years and a
[1:32:54] half not committed one
[1:32:57] sin that is the one that pictured that
[1:33:00] cross this morning and then you know
[1:33:02] according to the Roman
[1:33:04] Empire woman Lord that time they said
[1:33:07] you can never be a curse until you are
[1:33:10] crucified on the
[1:33:11] cross because of that he carried all my
[1:33:15] sin all your sin up to a
[1:33:18] PR that he felt alone and he said father
[1:33:23] why thou Hast forsaken me that at that
[1:33:27] point you know why he said this one
[1:33:31] because there was complete
[1:33:34] separation between him and his father
[1:33:37] right now because he was full of sin at
[1:33:39] that
[1:33:41] point but to make it complete he said
[1:33:46] forgive them because they don't know
[1:33:49] what they
[1:33:50] do and then can you imagine that cross
[1:33:53] the the Bible says he was beaten with
[1:33:55] still it
[1:33:56] peel with still with still peel it and
[1:34:00] then can you imagine the
[1:34:02] blood that was staying on that cross and
[1:34:07] he was laying
[1:34:08] down and then they had to nail him by
[1:34:13] nailing him I can me how the blood
[1:34:17] poured
[1:34:18] out and all the way to that cross
[1:34:25] in that old raged

[1:52:54] suffer
[1:52:55] persecution let's just bow one more time
[1:52:58] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:53:00] your

[1:53:06] same yesterday today and forever that

[1:53:10] these words are the only thing that will
[1:53:13] remain and father we just ask that you
[1:53:15] would anoint this word to our hearts
[1:53:18] Lord father that we would not leave this

[1:53:22] father you would change us Lord Jesus

[1:53:38] name we pray amen God bless you this
[1:53:40] morning you may be
[1:53:51] seated even though it seems I get
[1:53:54] emotional I'm certainly happy to be here
[1:53:56] in the house of the Lord with
[1:53:58] everyone and I can tell you the reason I
[1:54:01] get emotional
[1:54:03] is I just know him
[1:54:05] and he's
[1:54:08] here just a few announcements before we
[1:54:10] get into the word today we have brother
[1:54:12] Nestor ESP penia uh next weekend April
[1:54:16] the 20th at 6:00 p.m. and the 21st at
[1:54:19] 10:00 a.m. that's a Saturday evening
[1:54:21] service and a sun Monday morning service
[1:54:24] we have the Men's breakfast scheduled
[1:54:25] for May 18th it will be at our house and
[1:54:28] we're trusting it will be a time of
[1:54:30] encouragement for the
[1:54:31] Brethren Sunday June the 2nd we have
[1:54:34] brother Dela ad delodon he's the pastor
[1:54:38] from Nigeria he's coming here and we're
[1:54:40] certainly excited to hear what the Lord
[1:54:41] has placed on his
[1:54:43] heart I'm certainly thankful to have
[1:54:45] been a part of the Lethbridge Revival
[1:54:47] the brothers put together this weekend
[1:54:50] and we know uh they're in service right
[1:54:52] now brother Jerry Fury is preaching and
[1:54:55] then he'll be going back to Spruce Grove
[1:54:57] and I was there for Friday night uh
[1:55:01] Brother Don and I drove down and we did
[1:55:04] the service and then we came home and
[1:55:06] there was three services yesterday
[1:55:07] brother Jerry took the morning service
[1:55:10] brother mvin took the midday service and
[1:55:12] then brother Jerry took the evening
[1:55:13] service again as I understand and I
[1:55:17] thought it was uh just an interesting
[1:55:19] time to go and fellowship we uh weren't
[1:55:22] able to have the same facility for all
[1:55:26] of the
[1:55:28] services um the first four Services
[1:55:31] Friday and Saturday Services were in
[1:55:33] that Alliance Church was it the alliance
[1:55:37] I think it was the oh the United Okay
[1:55:40] United Church and uh certainly was an
[1:55:42] interesting building to see it's
[1:55:45] definitely a historic site I think it
[1:55:47] was uh built in about
[1:55:49] 1912 and uh they say that the left
[1:55:52] Bridge philarmonic Orchestra plays in
[1:55:54] that building because of the Acoustics
[1:55:57] and they got a big big old pipe organ in
[1:55:59] there and just a really neat building to
[1:56:01] see just a it's like a it's like a
[1:56:04] museum but uh they had the services
[1:56:07] there and Friday night we had the
[1:56:09] gymnasium Saturday they were able to
[1:56:11] have the sanctuary which was probably a
[1:56:13] really B real blessing for everyone I'm
[1:56:15] sure um I thought it was interesting
[1:56:17] though we had I think it must have been
[1:56:19] a Zumba class or something going on in
[1:56:22] the basement of the gymnasium they had
[1:56:25] Bas and music it was just obnoxious and
[1:56:30] you know we prayed while we opened the
[1:56:32] service and it was what five minutes and
[1:56:35] that music was off it was over and we
[1:56:38] were able to go forwards and just bring
[1:56:40] a word of encouragement to the people in
[1:56:42] Lethbridge and I just think it's a
[1:56:44] wonderful thing to see what the Lord is
[1:56:46] doing there in Lethbridge you know some
[1:56:48] people have come and some people have
[1:56:49] gone but there's still a group of people
[1:56:52] that want to keep their shoulder to the
[1:56:53] wheel and have church and we know that
[1:56:56] God is still calling he's bringing
[1:56:58] people in there's new people there new
[1:57:00] faces new excitement and you know I just
[1:57:03] tried to encourage them a little bit
[1:57:04] with what brother mvin had said last
[1:57:06] week about how you know sometimes the
[1:57:10] blessing that happens it's not all about
[1:57:13] a financial blessing in our lives and
[1:57:15] it's not all about maybe getting Health
[1:57:17] in our lives it's not all about having
[1:57:19] good things necessarily happen for us in
[1:57:21] our lives
[1:57:22] but what sometimes happens is the
[1:57:24] blessing comes to our children and our
[1:57:27] children's children because we're
[1:57:29] willing to continue to put our shoulder
[1:57:31] to the wheel when times get tough when
[1:57:33] things get sticky we know the God we
[1:57:35] serve and we're not interested in
[1:57:37] compromising not one iota for our
[1:57:40] feelings and what happens is the
[1:57:42] blessing comes upon our family and comes
[1:57:45] upon our family's friends and our
[1:57:47] family's children it's amazing what can
[1:57:50] happen so I just Tred to encourage the
[1:57:52] Saints there to just keep the word first
[1:57:55] and to keep pressing on not not give one
[1:57:57] bit of compromise not one iota just keep
[1:58:00] praying for a pastor keep paying a tithe
[1:58:03] keep giving God something to honor and
[1:58:05] see if God won't come and actually honor
[1:58:08] their prayers if he won't honor their
[1:58:10] faithfulness and that's what I I
[1:58:12] basically told them we need to have
[1:58:14] faithfulness in order for God to
[1:58:16] actually bless us but you know sometimes
[1:58:18] we can get used to actually coming to
[1:58:20] God and treating him like he's a vending
[1:58:22] machine and we can put our tithe in the
[1:58:24] offering and say I put my tithe there
[1:58:26] now I expect to see some results there
[1:58:28] should be something that happens you
[1:58:30] know that might not happen in your
[1:58:33] generation it might not even happen in
[1:58:35] your children's generation but it might
[1:58:37] be your grandchildren's generation that
[1:58:39] it
[1:58:39] happens it's God's
[1:58:43] timing it was wonderful to be there
[1:58:45] though and just see the Saints and just
[1:58:47] encourage them
[1:58:50] um this morning I want to take a little
[1:58:52] bit of a different turn we've talked
[1:58:54] about the Holy Ghost for a long time and
[1:58:57] I know some people are fed up with it
[1:58:59] probably and just have heard enough
[1:59:01] about it and you know I I know that it
[1:59:04] can seem to be long and and I'll tell
[1:59:07] you honestly there was a time when I was
[1:59:08] coming to church I was a a relatively
[1:59:11] new Christian we were in the upper room
[1:59:13] still and brother Ken was preaching on
[1:59:15] Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of booths
[1:59:18] and I think he did it for about a year
[1:59:19] just about a year and I remember
[1:59:21] thinking I can't believe he's still
[1:59:22] talking about this how much more is
[1:59:24] there to talk about the Feast of the
[1:59:26] Tabernacles goodness sakes but you know
[1:59:29] what the word of God it's never going to
[1:59:31] pass away amen there's coming a time
[1:59:34] where we're going to be in the Feast of
[1:59:36] Tabernacles for
[1:59:38] eternity so what else is there to talk
[1:59:40] about we have the word of God and and
[1:59:42] you know it's an open book and it's just
[1:59:43] a tremendous thing that we have that
[1:59:45] opportunity but today I'm not going to
[1:59:47] go too far into the Holy Ghost you know
[1:59:49] where I stand with it and uh you know
[1:59:51] outside of it it there's no hope we can
[1:59:53] pretend all we want to be Christians but
[1:59:55] if you don't have the Holy Ghost then
[1:59:56] you're truly not a Christian because you
[1:59:58] will not be Christlike without his
[2:00:00] Spirit living out through you that's
[2:00:02] just the way it
[2:00:03] works you know uh in our scripture today
[2:00:07] verse 11 just just persecutions
[2:00:10] afflictions which came unto me at
[2:00:13] Antioch at ionium at Lisa what
[2:00:18] persecutions I Endure this is Paul
[2:00:20] speaking here
[2:00:22] actually Timothy but he's speaking here
[2:00:25] what persecutions I endured but out of
[2:00:29] them all the Lord delivered
[2:00:33] me yay and all that will live Godly in
[2:00:38] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[2:00:42] and it goes on to say in verse 13 but
[2:00:44] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[2:00:48] and worse deceiving and being deceived
[2:00:53] and you know brothers and sisters just
[2:00:55] remember that this isn't going to be out
[2:00:57] there in the in the world in the
[2:00:58] denominations this is going to be right
[2:01:01] intertwined with the
[2:01:03] truth there's people that are ever
[2:01:05] learning ever learning smart educated
[2:01:08] people but never ever able to come to
[2:01:10] the knowledge of the truth why is that
[2:01:13] because they come right up to that point
[2:01:15] we've talked about it so many times
[2:01:16] right there and they're able to taste of
[2:01:19] that Heavenly gift they're able to be
[2:01:20] enlightened by by the word of God but
[2:01:23] they don't ever want to get the Holy
[2:01:24] Ghost don't ever let me get the Holy
[2:01:26] Ghost no I can't go that far that's
[2:01:27] getting crazy I I might get out of
[2:01:29] control I might actually get out of
[2:01:31] order but you know what the Lord wants
[2:01:33] us to do is get out of order he doesn't
[2:01:36] want us to have a form of godliness and
[2:01:38] deny his power he wants us to be free in
[2:01:42] the holy spirit because where the spirit
[2:01:43] of God is there's what Freedom brothers
[2:01:46] and sisters to Worship in spirit and in
[2:01:49] truth not be bound in Chains and say
[2:01:51] well this is my culture this is the way
[2:01:54] I was taught this is my tradition all of
[2:01:55] that stuff that's not anything to do
[2:01:58] with God the Holy Spirit has no
[2:01:59] boundaries he's got no country of origin
[2:02:02] he he's not cultural he has one one
[2:02:06] behavior and that's his word his
[2:02:08] attributes are in the word of God but
[2:02:10] you know all all who live Godly in
[2:02:13] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[2:02:17] persecution thinking about our our study
[2:02:20] on uh you know the exposition of the
[2:02:22] seven Church ages on Wednesday and it
[2:02:25] just really struck my heart as I'm sure
[2:02:28] it did
[2:02:29] everyone just thinking about the the
[2:02:32] request and I apologize because I did
[2:02:34] forget to mention the local assembly in
[2:02:38] London this morning and brother Chandler
[2:02:42] the passing of him a pastor in
[2:02:45] London it really resonated with me it
[2:02:47] struck a chord with me it made me
[2:02:49] remember what it was like to lose our
[2:02:51] pastor here
[2:02:52] and and to recognize that God he he will
[2:02:55] allow us to go through trials and
[2:02:57] tribulations to shake us up he's not
[2:03:00] going to let us actually just have a
[2:03:02] flowery bed of ease walk into heaven
[2:03:04] that's not going to happen that's not
[2:03:05] the life of a Believer the life of a
[2:03:07] Believer is strong and robust and you
[2:03:10] know one thing I I just am going to say
[2:03:12] this I probably will regret it later but
[2:03:14] sometimes you just have to say what the
[2:03:16] Lord puts on your heart and I think it's
[2:03:18] an amazing thing and I'm probably going
[2:03:20] to preach on it someday my wife wife
[2:03:22] probably knows where I'm going with this
[2:03:23] but I I since I've come to the message
[2:03:25] of the hour I have never heard of so
[2:03:27] many people who have been offended the
[2:03:29] word offended I I've met many people in
[2:03:32] the world many many people in many
[2:03:34] different situations but only around the
[2:03:36] Church of the Living God have I heard
[2:03:38] people say they're offended offended
[2:03:40] offended yeah yeah I get it but that
[2:03:43] ain't what the prophet of God taught no
[2:03:45] the prophet of God taught that we're not
[2:03:48] hot house plants right we're not raised
[2:03:51] up under protection where if we get one
[2:03:54] little Cool Breeze or one little bug
[2:03:56] comes our way it's going to put us out
[2:03:57] and kill
[2:03:59] us but yet you hear some of the most
[2:04:02] vibrant maybe some of the most elder
[2:04:05] Christian people around the message of
[2:04:06] the hour get
[2:04:08] offended help and of what because
[2:04:12] somebody didn't wear a tie because
[2:04:13] somebody didn't do something the way
[2:04:15] that they thought it should be done is
[2:04:18] it according to the spirit of God
[2:04:19] according to the word of God or is it
[2:04:21] according to our thoughts or our
[2:04:23] theories that's where it is brothers and
[2:04:25] sisters brother bradam says that
[2:04:27] Christians should be robust and strong
[2:04:30] and not easily moved we know that's the
[2:04:32] word of God we sing that song I shall
[2:04:35] not be moved amen do we mean
[2:04:39] it or is something going to come along
[2:04:41] and just step on our toes and oh man I'm
[2:04:43] offended now I've got to stay
[2:04:45] home but I could just stream because
[2:04:48] I've got a favorite Ministry anyway
[2:04:49] somewhere they can actually minister to
[2:04:52] me brothers and sisters that's outside
[2:04:54] the word of God and what's his
[2:04:57] will his will is his
[2:05:00] word and we're going to get into that
[2:05:02] today but we read this on on Wednesday
[2:05:04] and I just thought my as we heard about
[2:05:06] brother Chandler passing and you know it
[2:05:09] sounds like he he took a heart attack he
[2:05:11] had a heart attack I had mentioned that
[2:05:14] he took a fall but they they saw the
[2:05:16] video inside the church and I think he
[2:05:19] grabbed his chest and fell over and gave
[2:05:21] up the G and you know we all have a time
[2:05:25] appointed of the father where he will
[2:05:28] actually prune us he will pull our
[2:05:31] flower from his garden and say it's time
[2:05:33] for you to go into my bouquet and you
[2:05:35] know we certainly want to remember the
[2:05:37] church we want to remember the families
[2:05:39] all of the church families who will be
[2:05:41] affected now by the losing of a pastor
[2:05:44] and how much that will shake things up
[2:05:46] we know what that will do but you know
[2:05:49] in the in the in the exposition of the
[2:05:50] seven Church ages out of the saman
[2:05:52] church age we read this on Wednesday the
[2:05:54] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[2:05:56] signs of God's
[2:05:58] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[2:06:01] Still Waters signs of his love and
[2:06:04] approval we can't be looking at the
[2:06:06] natural circumstances and thinking we're
[2:06:08] in God's will or we're out of God's Will
[2:06:11] and today just in case you haven't
[2:06:13] figured it out or I didn't say it I want
[2:06:14] to talk about God's will God's will
[2:06:17] concerning you God's will concerning me
[2:06:20] the Cloudy sky and storms of life are no
[2:06:23] signs of God's disapproval neither are
[2:06:25] bright skies and Still Waters signs of
[2:06:29] his love and
[2:06:30] approval his love his approval sorry of
[2:06:34] any of us is only in the
[2:06:37] Beloved his love is
[2:06:39] elective which he had for us before the
[2:06:42] foundation of the world does he love us
[2:06:45] ah yes but how shall we
[2:06:48] know we shall know because he said so am
[2:06:52] but how many people here today in this
[2:06:54] room heard Jesus say I said so I love
[2:06:59] you I bet not very many people heard a
[2:07:02] man's voice say I love
[2:07:06] you but his word said it
[2:07:14] amen but how shall we know he said so
[2:07:17] how shall we know because he said so and
[2:07:20] manifested that that he did love us for
[2:07:23] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[2:07:26] his Spirit placing us as
[2:07:31] Sons gave us of his spirit and placing
[2:07:35] us as sons and we know that as
[2:07:39] adoption not just coming to church and
[2:07:42] actually having a good sermon and going
[2:07:44] home and having a form of godliness but
[2:07:46] denying the power thereof but actually
[2:07:48] going all the way into Christ getting
[2:07:50] right into the Promised Land looking
[2:07:52] around and seeing Giants and saying our
[2:07:53] God is more than able it doesn't matter
[2:07:56] what I see what I think or what I feel
[2:08:00] God's word Reigns
[2:08:03] Supreme how shall I prove my love to
[2:08:07] him by believing what he said and
[2:08:11] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[2:08:14] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[2:08:19] come to pass oh yes brothers and sisters
[2:08:22] we're not exempt from trials right
[2:08:24] Trials of Life are coming around and
[2:08:26] they're going to prove who we are when
[2:08:28] times get tough do we scram do we run
[2:08:32] away or do we actually lean into the
[2:08:35] problem and say we need to deal with
[2:08:38] this
[2:08:39] situation God's word is going to be done
[2:08:41] in this situation and I guarantee you
[2:08:43] brothers and sisters whatever our
[2:08:45] situation today God's will will be done
[2:08:47] in that situation there's not one of us
[2:08:50] that can operate outside of his will I
[2:08:53] think it's such a beautiful thing that
[2:08:55] excites me because that's the only place
[2:08:57] I want to be brothers and sisters and
[2:08:58] I'm sure that's the only place you want
[2:09:00] to be is in the will of God Amen because
[2:09:02] when you're in the will of God you know
[2:09:04] Satan can't touch
[2:09:07] you you know when I was young I've
[2:09:09] probably mentioned this in the past but
[2:09:10] it's just the way I felt led to go today
[2:09:12] I remember my dad teaching me and I'm so
[2:09:15] thankful for a dad that took me to
[2:09:16] church that raised me up in in in the
[2:09:19] word of God
[2:09:22] and he did it to the best of his ability
[2:09:24] and I'm certainly thankful and my dad he
[2:09:27] taught me one thing that uh two things
[2:09:30] two things that I I think are really
[2:09:32] important and and maybe I'll just
[2:09:34] mention both of them quickly here the
[2:09:36] first one is about finding the will of
[2:09:38] God for your
[2:09:39] life I I heard him tell me that the
[2:09:42] other thing that he taught me which I
[2:09:43] think is real important is to be
[2:09:45] accountable for your actions when you
[2:09:47] actually do something you've got to be
[2:09:48] willing to actually say yes indeed I did
[2:09:51] that and if you can't do that afterwards
[2:09:55] don't do it but two things that were
[2:09:58] just sort of life lessons for me and you
[2:10:01] know I I kind of secretly took this one
[2:10:03] about the the will of God in my life and
[2:10:05] I I tried to find the will of God I I
[2:10:07] wanted to know what that meant for me in
[2:10:09] my life and and had no way to find out
[2:10:12] no nowhere to go with it I went to the
[2:10:14] the church and said if if there's a will
[2:10:16] for God in my life then maybe the the
[2:10:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost is it and I
[2:10:20] went and a got baptized in titles and
[2:10:23] recognized very quickly that there was
[2:10:25] really no power there um they had great
[2:10:27] Services there was a great anointing
[2:10:29] there and and there was signs and
[2:10:31] wonders there was stuff that happened
[2:10:33] but I I still never really experienced
[2:10:35] it for myself and and there came a time
[2:10:38] where I thought you know there's really
[2:10:39] nothing to this and so I went out in the
[2:10:40] world and I'm not here to give my
[2:10:42] testimony this morning pertaining to all
[2:10:44] of that but I I just really kind of
[2:10:46] secretly once I was in the world had
[2:10:48] this desire for God's will but had no
[2:10:50] way to know to find it I had no clue how
[2:10:53] to get it where where would I find it my
[2:10:56] whole family kind of fell away from
[2:10:58] going to church and everything that I
[2:11:00] knew as a child kind of shifted just
[2:11:03] slightly a little bit and uh I found
[2:11:06] myself out in the world just like
[2:11:07] everyone else but you know it was about
[2:11:09] junior high when I had this desire and
[2:11:12] and I I always secretly wanted to know
[2:11:14] the will of God where would I find that
[2:11:17] and you know later on in life much later
[2:11:19] in life I I had the testimony of my wife
[2:11:22] ministering to me through work we were
[2:11:24] co-workers and and she said in the end
[2:11:27] just to make it a short story today
[2:11:29] because I really want to preach she
[2:11:30] invited me to church and when I came to
[2:11:33] church I said I don't understand this
[2:11:35] but I know something about it is true
[2:11:38] what I'm hearing brother Ken preach
[2:11:40] something about this is real and true
[2:11:43] and I never heard this before and and
[2:11:45] I'm just going to keep going and as I
[2:11:46] kept going and and just keeping my
[2:11:49] shoulder to the wheel trusting that the
[2:11:51] the Lord was leading me and guiding me
[2:11:52] because I believed this was truth what I
[2:11:55] heard when I started to really get ears
[2:11:57] to hear what the spirit was saying to
[2:11:59] the church was that God's will is his
[2:12:04] word and for me I thought my that's
[2:12:09] similar to what my dad was teaching me
[2:12:11] when I was younger find God's will for
[2:12:14] your life and now I have a pastor saying
[2:12:17] God's will for your life is his word so
[2:12:20] I'm think
[2:12:21] my how does that work so time goes on
[2:12:26] through the process of time I start to
[2:12:28] encounter problems as normal believers
[2:12:31] do the the trials of Life come our way
[2:12:35] and we go to the pastor and say Pastor
[2:12:37] how how can I deal with this
[2:12:39] circumstance and this situation what
[2:12:41] should I do what's the will of God in
[2:12:44] this situation and he would say brother
[2:12:47] Barry his will is his word and I'd be
[2:12:50] like come on brother Ken there's got to
[2:12:52] be another way you got to be able to
[2:12:54] help me as a pastor surely to goodness
[2:12:57] God could give you a word that would
[2:12:58] actually help me expedite through this
[2:13:01] problem but he said no God's will is his
[2:13:05] word amen and you have to trust God
[2:13:07] yourself for him to give you the
[2:13:10] Revelation about what you're looking
[2:13:13] for and you know what that takes is
[2:13:16] patience and now I'm just going to be
[2:13:18] real honest there was a time where where
[2:13:21] I was coming to church and I was
[2:13:23] probably just about like a walking
[2:13:26] zombie I was coming to church because
[2:13:28] it's just what we did it was just a
[2:13:31] tradition and you know I I'm just going
[2:13:34] to be transparent about it I was married
[2:13:36] with Children we were coming to church I
[2:13:38] was a deacon I was struggling in my life
[2:13:41] in my walk and I'm so thankful that I
[2:13:44] had a pastor that I know discerned me in
[2:13:47] my station but he did not come and crush
[2:13:50] me amen what he did was he encouraged
[2:13:54] me I saw a thing online and I thought it
[2:13:57] was real good maybe I shouldn't say it
[2:13:59] but I'm going
[2:14:01] to a woman is getting an interview and
[2:14:04] she was probably some author or someone
[2:14:06] that knows a lot about
[2:14:08] men but what she uh was asked by the
[2:14:11] interviewer if you've got a a husband
[2:14:15] that just misbehaves and and doesn't
[2:14:19] treat his wife nice or his family nice
[2:14:22] how do you address that and the woman
[2:14:25] who was being interviewed she gave such
[2:14:27] a simple answer but I think it's so good
[2:14:29] and I I'm sure it was a scriptural uh
[2:14:31] sort of perspective but I'm not
[2:14:33] condoning women Ministry don't go off
[2:14:35] the wrong direction with this I'm just
[2:14:36] saying there was an interview ER and an
[2:14:39] interview e and one person was asked a
[2:14:41] question and she gave this answer she
[2:14:43] said inside of every man there is a king
[2:14:46] and a
[2:14:47] fool and whichever one you speak to is
[2:14:50] the one that's going to to
[2:14:52] respond and to me I thought my goodness
[2:14:55] that's so good you know I I I had a
[2:14:58] pastor here we all did the people who
[2:15:00] were here with brother Ken who had a man
[2:15:02] with a supernatural gift and he was able
[2:15:05] to actually bring out the best
[2:15:07] spiritually in every one of us and I'm
[2:15:10] certainly thankful for that man and his
[2:15:12] ministry and his willingness to lay down
[2:15:14] his life and sister Shelly too because
[2:15:16] she was just as much of the ministry as
[2:15:18] brother Ken you know you don't know what
[2:15:20] goes on behind the scenes brothers and
[2:15:22] sisters the pulpit is only one part of
[2:15:24] the
[2:15:25] ministry so God bless you Sister Shelly
[2:15:28] for all that you've done but brother Ken
[2:15:30] he never ever lashed out at me and got
[2:15:33] angry with me and and I'm so thankful
[2:15:36] that he didn't because it was exactly
[2:15:38] what I needed he spoke to the king in me
[2:15:41] he didn't speak to the fool inside of me
[2:15:44] and let me tell you there was a fool
[2:15:45] standing at the
[2:15:47] door cuz I got resentful with God I went
[2:15:50] through all manner of stuff I don't need
[2:15:52] to go and dump out the garbage can
[2:15:54] across the pulpit here to you but what I
[2:15:57] do want to say is that God is always
[2:15:59] with us and his will will come to pass
[2:16:03] in our lives and sometimes even if we
[2:16:06] can't see night from Day Day from night
[2:16:09] if if everything is going wrong in our
[2:16:11] lives brothers and sisters keep coming
[2:16:13] to church it's a trick of the devil to
[2:16:16] get you to stay away from the body of
[2:16:19] believers
[2:16:21] amen you know what I told the people in
[2:16:23] Lethbridge on Friday night one of the
[2:16:26] greatest blessings that can ever happen
[2:16:28] in a church is when you are willing to
[2:16:32] put aside your emotions and your
[2:16:34] feelings and present yourselves with the
[2:16:37] Brothers and Sisters in Christ in a
[2:16:40] service yes sir because everyone's going
[2:16:43] through stuff and when we get together
[2:16:46] and we see one another we can say wow
[2:16:50] there's others that believe and it just
[2:16:53] feels good to get together with the
[2:16:54] brothers and sisters but you know we
[2:16:56] might not get anything out of it we
[2:16:57] might just drag our carcass in and drag
[2:16:59] our carcass out not hear anything from
[2:17:01] the preaching of the word etc etc
[2:17:05] etc but another brother another sister
[2:17:07] might be absolutely encouraged because
[2:17:09] they can look and they can see that
[2:17:11] brother came again and I know what that
[2:17:14] brother's going through or that sister
[2:17:18] she's got the courage to keep coming to
[2:17:20] church
[2:17:21] and not give
[2:17:23] up Satan wants us to give up Satan would
[2:17:27] love nothing more than to destroy a
[2:17:30] church remember we read it the church
[2:17:32] that's not under persecution isn't of
[2:17:34] God so we thank God for the persecutions
[2:17:37] unfortunately we all have to go through
[2:17:40] them but one of the best encouragements
[2:17:43] we can ever do is actually just come to
[2:17:45] church and show the brothers and sisters
[2:17:48] whose side we're
[2:17:49] on when you're if you've ever played on
[2:17:52] a team sport that's been sort of
[2:17:54] volunteering and and you you get
[2:17:57] together and you're going to play a game
[2:17:58] and you got a bunch of people at the
[2:17:59] beginning of the Season they're gung-ho
[2:18:01] yeah we're going to play together and
[2:18:03] then when the season comes and you
[2:18:05] actually start to play games and you're
[2:18:06] no longer practicing and you go to a
[2:18:08] game and you have four people show up
[2:18:11] and and you need seven or eight people
[2:18:13] to play the game and the other team has
[2:18:16] 15 or 20 people and you all can look at
[2:18:19] each other and go oh my what going to
[2:18:21] happen here we're going to have to give
[2:18:22] double time we're going to have to
[2:18:24] really put our shoulders to the wheel
[2:18:26] and try hard to make this work and
[2:18:28] usually what happens in that situation
[2:18:30] is one team beats the other team because
[2:18:32] they can't really overcome that kind of
[2:18:35] power but brothers and sisters we know
[2:18:37] the natural types the spiritual and and
[2:18:39] maybe I'm getting a little carnal
[2:18:40] talking that way but when we have
[2:18:42] brothers and sisters show up it brings
[2:18:43] courage to
[2:18:45] us it shows us that we're on the same
[2:18:47] team
[2:18:51] I was certainly thankful to have a
[2:18:53] pastor that told me the truth his will
[2:18:56] is his word so I took and I ate the
[2:19:00] book like we've all been instructed to
[2:19:03] every single one of us the latter part
[2:19:05] of Revelations 10 we know there's more
[2:19:08] verses past Revelations 10 veres 1 to7
[2:19:11] don't we we know those other verses
[2:19:12] there take the book and eat it up that's
[2:19:15] our commission brothers and sisters
[2:19:17] that's the bride's commission take that
[2:19:19] book and eat it up but you know honestly
[2:19:21] after I did that after I talked to my
[2:19:23] pastor about some of this stuff the
[2:19:25] struggles that were going on it was many
[2:19:27] years later that I caught the Revelation
[2:19:30] about what I'm getting into today it was
[2:19:32] many years later and you know it was a
[2:19:34] very plain conversation that I had with
[2:19:37] God if you've ever had one you'll know
[2:19:39] exactly what I'm talking about if you
[2:19:41] haven't had one I pray that you will
[2:19:43] because he wants to have those
[2:19:44] conversations with us and you know
[2:19:46] brother Bram says that maybe only one
[2:19:48] time in a person's life God will speak
[2:19:50] speak to you maybe only one time ever
[2:19:53] and that'll be it and that will be
[2:19:55] enough won't it to hear the voice of God
[2:19:58] for you in your own life we know that
[2:20:00] we've all actually had an experience
[2:20:03] that's why we're here today but it goes
[2:20:05] further than that excuse me he wants to
[2:20:07] take us and adopt us as his son and that
[2:20:10] doesn't mean just take you from not
[2:20:12] being his son to making you his son that
[2:20:14] means taking us and and showing an open
[2:20:17] declaration to everyone around this is
[2:20:19] my beloved son or daughter this is the
[2:20:23] one that I chose in me before the
[2:20:24] foundation of the world that's the kind
[2:20:26] of adoption we're talking about but you
[2:20:28] know for me in my life in my walk it
[2:20:30] took me a little bit of time and and
[2:20:32] what happened was a conversation
[2:20:34] happened just ordinary while I was
[2:20:36] driving to work and I was in that state
[2:20:38] where I didn't feel good about myself I
[2:20:40] didn't feel good about my marriage I
[2:20:41] didn't feel good about going to church I
[2:20:43] didn't feel good about my job I I was in
[2:20:45] a really rough spot Satan knows exactly
[2:20:47] how to get us exactly where we need to
[2:20:49] be how does he do that is because he
[2:20:51] knows our parents and he knows our
[2:20:53] parents parents and he knows the DNA
[2:20:55] that's inside of us and he's going to
[2:20:57] play upon all of that and you know it
[2:20:59] might sound naturally that's unfair
[2:21:02] that's unfair but what's unfair is that
[2:21:05] he believes the word of God maybe more
[2:21:07] so than most of the theologians brother
[2:21:09] Bram said Satan knows the word of God
[2:21:12] and he fears it it makes him
[2:21:15] tremble but we know that fools will walk
[2:21:19] with hob nail shoes
[2:21:21] over the word of God Where Angels Fear
[2:21:24] To
[2:21:26] Tread but I had this conversation with
[2:21:29] god I know he said to me just one time
[2:21:31] real plain real plain so that question
[2:21:34] about my will you want an answer for it
[2:21:38] and and I said yeah I do yeah kind of
[2:21:40] chuckled like Abraham I guess kind of
[2:21:42] chuckled I was just having this thought
[2:21:44] coming to me while I was driving and you
[2:21:46] want an answer yeah I do and so he said
[2:21:49] you know what my will is my word and I
[2:21:52] said yeah I know that I I've heard it
[2:21:54] before but I'd really like to understand
[2:21:57] it and he said you know there's a
[2:21:59] scriptural answer for a scriptural
[2:22:01] question and I thought my goodness he
[2:22:04] said you know what it's not an
[2:22:05] achievement and it's not a
[2:22:07] destination it's not even an action on
[2:22:10] our part we can't say that it's God's
[2:22:13] will for us to to go and get a degree
[2:22:15] it's God's will for us to go here or go
[2:22:17] there and it's God's will for us to do
[2:22:20] do this or do that but you know it's a
[2:22:23] paradox because it is so every one of
[2:22:25] those things so this is where it gets
[2:22:28] confusing and I know just try and bear
[2:22:29] with me as we go today I'm going to do
[2:22:31] my best to try and explain it I can only
[2:22:33] tell you the way God's told me and I I
[2:22:35] trust that it will be a blessing but you
[2:22:37] know many times we can look at it and I
[2:22:40] did myself to try and find God's will
[2:22:42] for my life does that mean that I'm
[2:22:43] going to be an airline pilot or a
[2:22:45] mechanic or an engineer or a
[2:22:48] mathematician a school teacher what am I
[2:22:50] going to be in my life is that what it's
[2:22:52] going to be and that's what I thought
[2:22:53] God's will was for for me to find that
[2:22:56] position in life and I think it is
[2:22:58] absolutely true we all have a calling
[2:23:00] and a commission from God and it doesn't
[2:23:03] matter whether we're we're the least of
[2:23:05] the Christians or the strongest of the
[2:23:07] Christians we've got the greatest of
[2:23:09] positions or the least of positions if
[2:23:10] we've got a position in the economy of
[2:23:12] God then that's all we need brothers and
[2:23:13] sisters that is it but it is truly a
[2:23:16] paradox because it's not an achievement
[2:23:18] even though it is an achievement it's
[2:23:19] not a destination but it but it truly is
[2:23:23] a destination is God's will for our life
[2:23:25] because many people could say brother
[2:23:26] Barry I moved here from another country
[2:23:28] knowing that it was the will of God and
[2:23:30] I acknowledge that and recognize that
[2:23:32] and say Amen it truly is I'm just
[2:23:34] explaining the way God revealed this to
[2:23:36] me it is a paradox because the truth of
[2:23:39] the question came to me so clearly and
[2:23:42] it was simply this that if your word my
[2:23:45] word abides in you you abide in me and
[2:23:49] my word abides in you then what ask what
[2:23:54] you will and it will be done to you it
[2:23:58] doesn't say where you're
[2:24:00] at it doesn't say where you're going it
[2:24:03] doesn't say with what you've
[2:24:05] achieved just if ye abide in me and my
[2:24:09] words abiding in you then ask what you
[2:24:12] will if you're going to get a degree and
[2:24:14] you feel led to go that way then simply
[2:24:17] have his word inside of you
[2:24:20] abide in him and have his word abiding
[2:24:23] in you then when you go and you do that
[2:24:25] degree you're going to be able to ask
[2:24:26] what you will and he'll help you through
[2:24:28] every single exam every single lab every
[2:24:30] single thing you got to do every paper
[2:24:32] you got to write you will do well
[2:24:34] because it's his
[2:24:35] will but his will is having him in every
[2:24:39] moment of whatever it is we're doing
[2:24:41] brothers and sisters that's the critical
[2:24:43] factor and that's what I needed to
[2:24:45] understand it's not some place that I'm
[2:24:47] going to go to and discover his will
[2:24:49] like a treasure chest and open up and
[2:24:51] say yahooo I found his will look it I
[2:24:54] found it I found it no his will is
[2:24:56] inside of the believer but we've got to
[2:24:58] have him inside of
[2:25:02] us that that that that question became
[2:25:05] so clearly answered and you know I I
[2:25:08] said in my heart I said I understand
[2:25:12] that I can see the the connecting of the
[2:25:14] dots but I need a little more than that
[2:25:17] and and I I'm only going to touch on one
[2:25:18] part of it today and I can can see time
[2:25:20] is flying but you know the one thing
[2:25:23] that the Lord said to me in that moment
[2:25:25] he said you want a scriptural answer for
[2:25:27] it don't you and this is how I knew it
[2:25:29] was the Lord because the devil's not
[2:25:30] going to go and do that and give us
[2:25:31] truth the devil's going to try and give
[2:25:33] us something else some kind of
[2:25:34] alternative and what he did was he said
[2:25:36] take a look at Joseph's life look at
[2:25:39] Joseph every single step of the way in
[2:25:42] his life what did he do he kept the word
[2:25:47] first he believed the Lord he created
[2:25:50] him to believe him he created him to be
[2:25:53] able to just manifest the life of Jesus
[2:25:56] Christ the life of God to everyone
[2:25:58] around him and he didn't care what their
[2:25:59] opinions were he didn't care what they
[2:26:01] thought he simply did
[2:26:04] it but I said you know I I do in fact I
[2:26:07] do need a scriptural answer for this and
[2:26:09] he said look at Joseph and take a look
[2:26:11] at Joseph's life and so we're going to
[2:26:13] do that today we're going to take a look
[2:26:14] at some of the aspects of Joseph's life
[2:26:16] but we'll get into it a little bit later
[2:26:18] one of the other things he said was look
[2:26:19] at Daniel's life
[2:26:21] two Believers in the scripture and both
[2:26:23] of them had tremendously strong
[2:26:25] circumstances against them but both of
[2:26:27] them kept the word before everything in
[2:26:30] their lives and what did God do even in
[2:26:32] the midst of their trials even in the
[2:26:34] midst of their calamities God blessed
[2:26:36] them and he made them both blessings to
[2:26:38] the people all around them and we know
[2:26:41] Joseph was a type of Jesus Christ that's
[2:26:42] what brother bradam said and I'm not
[2:26:44] going to dispute that for a second but I
[2:26:46] just want to bring the aspect of what
[2:26:47] like I said the Lord showed me clearly
[2:26:49] that you know what our our destination
[2:26:52] isn't necessarily the will of God
[2:26:54] because if that was the case how did he
[2:26:56] get th why did he get thrown into a pit
[2:26:58] and then drug out of the pit and then
[2:27:00] sold into slavery is that God's will for
[2:27:03] us my sometimes there's some tough
[2:27:07] circumstances out of one in a million
[2:27:10] brother Bram I just want to sort of lay
[2:27:12] down the foundations for this his will
[2:27:14] is his word he in one of a million he
[2:27:16] says let me give you shocking something
[2:27:18] see not all that's says unto me Lord
[2:27:21] Lord will enter in but the one that
[2:27:24] doeth the will of my
[2:27:29] father I love that and he just says it
[2:27:31] plainly his will is his word
[2:27:34] amen we can be ever so
[2:27:37] religious have great times shouting
[2:27:41] jumping in these
[2:27:44] meetings which were he says I don't want
[2:27:46] to be critical but I've got a duty to
[2:27:49] God and that duty is to be sincere and
[2:27:52] to say what he wants me to
[2:27:55] say and you know brothers and
[2:27:59] sisters many people claim Jesus
[2:28:03] today and they also say that his word is
[2:28:06] for another time or it was for another
[2:28:08] culture it was for another
[2:28:11] season isn't that exactly what the devil
[2:28:14] did with
[2:28:16] Eve God told Eve when she was inside of
[2:28:19] Adam
[2:28:20] that the day you eat of that tree is the
[2:28:24] day you will surely
[2:28:27] die but Satan comes along and says you
[2:28:30] shall not surely die just go ahead taste
[2:28:34] of that fruit it won't kill you but we
[2:28:37] know they were supposed to live a
[2:28:38] thousand
[2:28:40] years and they never did did they we
[2:28:43] know death entered in at that place and
[2:28:45] that's truly Satan's trick is to try and
[2:28:47] put off God's word into some other day
[2:28:51] or back in the in the past to look back
[2:28:53] at what God's done my goodness we had
[2:28:55] such good time such good meetings
[2:28:57] brother Bram had prayer lines etc etc
[2:29:02] etc You Know Not much bothers Satan
[2:29:05] about religion brothers and sisters why
[2:29:08] is that because Satan is the most
[2:29:11] religious he is the most religious and
[2:29:15] you know if you question that there's a
[2:29:16] scriptural answer you can look back to
[2:29:17] when Jesus was in the temple and he
[2:29:18] would talk to the Pharisees in the
[2:29:20] Sadducees and what did he call them he
[2:29:21] said you're not of your father Adam or
[2:29:23] your father God he said you're of your
[2:29:25] father the
[2:29:28] devil Satan is the most
[2:29:30] religious and Satan believes that word
[2:29:34] and he
[2:29:35] trembles but he doesn't tremble when
[2:29:37] people don't believe the word he says
[2:29:40] yeah I've got them I've got them right
[2:29:42] where I want them in a straight where
[2:29:44] they think they're good and they're
[2:29:46] actually not they think they're saved
[2:29:47] and they're actually not they're in a
[2:29:49] position where they they say they
[2:29:50] believe the word and they they act like
[2:29:52] they believe the word but deep down
[2:29:54] inside they don't believe the word
[2:29:56] because if they did they would say Amen
[2:29:58] to it and not just in a church service
[2:30:00] but in their very life in their
[2:30:02] homes their children their neighbors
[2:30:05] everyone would say that's a real
[2:30:06] believer right
[2:30:09] there but you know when the devil devil
[2:30:11] does tremble brothers and sisters and
[2:30:13] this is where I think it gets real good
[2:30:15] it's when the word of God that word of
[2:30:17] God is actually in our hearts and as not
[2:30:20] just in our hearts if ye abide in me and
[2:30:22] my word abides in you remember that
[2:30:25] scripture then ask what you will then
[2:30:27] speak what you will we live under the
[2:30:29] third pole anointing in the day in which
[2:30:31] we live when that word of God is no
[2:30:33] longer just something that's spoken and
[2:30:36] and just acted but when it's actually
[2:30:39] lived then when it's on the lips of a
[2:30:41] son and daughter of God it's then that
[2:30:44] Satan trembles and what happens at that
[2:30:46] point is Satan becomes powerless before
[2:30:49] us and we know that that's what's in the
[2:30:51] word of God that's what's in in the
[2:30:52] message of the hour a and I think it's
[2:30:54] important for us to find the will of God
[2:30:57] the true will of God for our lives
[2:30:59] according to the message of the hour
[2:31:01] according to the day in which we live
[2:31:03] brothers and sisters and you know what
[2:31:04] it means it means not making compromises
[2:31:06] with this message of the hour and saying
[2:31:08] you know what I see it this way so I'm
[2:31:10] just going to live it this way and and
[2:31:12] you know you might believe it that way
[2:31:13] but I'm going to believe it another way
[2:31:15] brothers and sisters there's only one
[2:31:16] way only one truth and one life and it's
[2:31:19] the word of God God and if we're willing
[2:31:21] to make excuses and concessions for it
[2:31:23] we're giving Satan a day
[2:31:27] off but when we can believe that word
[2:31:29] and actually live that word and actually
[2:31:31] speak that word and when that word comes
[2:31:33] around and brings correction to our
[2:31:35] doorsteps we say thank you Lord thank
[2:31:38] you Lord because it means you love me I
[2:31:40] know that you're my
[2:31:42] father but when we say I resent that you
[2:31:45] know what you're not resenting brother
[2:31:47] Barry you're not resenting the minister
[2:31:48] that says it if it's the word word of
[2:31:50] God you're resenting God and it means
[2:31:52] that there's another nature inside of
[2:31:56] you and we need to get rid of that
[2:32:00] nature but you know Psalms
[2:32:04] 138 he esteems his word greater than his
[2:32:08] name Psalms 138:2 I will worship toward
[2:32:13] thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for
[2:32:17] thy loving kindness and for thy truth
[2:32:19] for thou Hast magnified Thy word above
[2:32:24] all thy
[2:32:27] name in the day when I cried thou
[2:32:31] answerest me and
[2:32:34] strengthen me with
[2:32:37] strength with strength in my soul I
[2:32:42] think that's such a beautiful scripture
[2:32:44] I remember brother Ken bringing that and
[2:32:46] it just it's never left we've we've just
[2:32:49] kept that real close to our heart
[2:32:51] because it's so important for us to
[2:32:53] recognize the word of God is what the
[2:32:55] prophet pointed to the word of God is
[2:32:57] what every single Prophet pointed to I
[2:33:01] I've been doing a little study of the
[2:33:02] five anointings of Elijah and it's just
[2:33:04] so beautiful because every single one of
[2:33:07] them pointed back to scripture every one
[2:33:10] of those prophets pointed right back to
[2:33:12] scripture it's such a beautiful thing
[2:33:15] out of 1960 the Queen of Sheba brother
[2:33:18] Bram he says I I said I can't help how
[2:33:21] much Goliath it is God is still
[2:33:25] God the god of David still lives the god
[2:33:29] of Abraham still lives the god of Jacob
[2:33:31] lives the God that was in Christ is
[2:33:34] living tonight he's raised and I know
[2:33:38] he's real amen amen he says there's
[2:33:41] something that no matter what the
[2:33:43] difficult is you want to go anyhow
[2:33:47] because there's you've got an objective
[2:33:50] and if you'll take the right motive
[2:33:52] towards that
[2:33:53] objective you'll get there now he's
[2:33:56] talking about his will finding his will
[2:33:58] you'll have you've got to have the right
[2:34:01] motive towards your objective that's the
[2:34:04] way I always find the will of God first
[2:34:09] think if it's the will of God then my
[2:34:12] motive and my objective to it if it's
[2:34:16] the right
[2:34:18] motive then the objective I
[2:34:21] have and we know brother bham says it in
[2:34:23] the message that the right mental
[2:34:25] attitude to any one of the promises of
[2:34:27] God will bring it to pass in our
[2:34:30] lives what is our motive towards the
[2:34:33] actions in our lives brothers and
[2:34:35] sisters what is the
[2:34:37] objective for the actions that we're
[2:34:40] actually dealing with in our lives why
[2:34:43] are we doing it what's the purpose for
[2:34:45] it is it to glorify God is it according
[2:34:48] to the word of God isn't it a beautiful
[2:34:51] thing to think that the prophet in our
[2:34:53] day he said that our thoughts are louder
[2:34:55] in heaven than our voices are and even
[2:34:58] right now this morning brothers and
[2:34:59] sisters he knows exactly what we're
[2:35:02] thinking it's just so beautiful if we
[2:35:04] could truly have the right mental
[2:35:07] attitude I we've said this before youve
[2:35:09] probably all heard it before and it's
[2:35:10] not in the message I'm not saying that
[2:35:12] uh Brother Brad might say it I've never
[2:35:14] looked it up but our attitude it will
[2:35:16] dictate our
[2:35:17] altitude the attitude in which we choose
[2:35:20] to have in life it will determine how
[2:35:23] high we're going to fly as
[2:35:27] Eagles it's possible to be an eagle and
[2:35:30] just sit on the
[2:35:31] ground it's possible to be an eagle and
[2:35:34] be scratching around in a chicken yard
[2:35:37] not realizing that we're
[2:35:39] Eagles it's possible to be an eagle and
[2:35:42] to have your Eagle Eye filmed over amen
[2:35:46] brothers and
[2:35:47] sisters the Lord is Our Shepherd and he
[2:35:51] will lead us and guide us in every
[2:35:53] single stage of our walk in every single
[2:35:56] stage of Our
[2:35:58] Lives first Thessalonians chapter 5 if
[2:36:02] you want to turn there with
[2:36:05] me 1 Thessalonians chapter
[2:36:17] 5 verse 14
[2:36:28] now we exhort you Brethren warn them
[2:36:31] that are
[2:36:32] unruly Comfort the feeble
[2:36:36] minded support the
[2:36:39] weak be patient toward all
[2:36:43] men see that none render evil for evil
[2:36:47] unto any man but ever follow that which
[2:36:50] is good both among yourselves and to all
[2:36:54] men Rejoice ever more pray without
[2:36:58] ceasing in
[2:37:01] everything give
[2:37:03] thanks
[2:37:05] why for this is the will of God in
[2:37:09] Christ
[2:37:10] Jesus concerning
[2:37:13] youall concerning
[2:37:15] me in everything give thanks amen
[2:37:20] because that's the will of God not get
[2:37:22] upset not go and talk about a brother or
[2:37:26] sister but to Rejoice ever more pray
[2:37:29] without
[2:37:31] ceasing it's tough It's Not Easy I'm not
[2:37:34] saying it's easy I'm saying it's tough
[2:37:36] it definitely is tough but what is our
[2:37:39] attitude today brothers and
[2:37:42] sisters in First Peter chapter 2 I'll
[2:37:45] just read it for the sake of time submit
[2:37:48] yourselves to every Ord of man for the
[2:37:50] Lord's sake whether it be to the king as
[2:37:53] supreme or unto Governors as unto them
[2:37:55] that are sent by him for the punishment
[2:37:57] of evildoers and for the praise of them
[2:38:00] that do well for so is the will of
[2:38:04] God that with well-doing ye may put to
[2:38:08] silence the ignorance of foolish
[2:38:10] men so when you read a scripture like
[2:38:12] that it becomes real difficult to
[2:38:14] tolerate when you hear people say well I
[2:38:17] don't believe it that way or I don't
[2:38:19] like doing it that way or I want to try
[2:38:21] and pinch a corner and not pay taxes and
[2:38:24] you know the government will never know
[2:38:25] about that and this and that and every
[2:38:27] single time we want to actually try and
[2:38:29] contravene the law and I say Lord help
[2:38:31] me because I know sometimes I get a
[2:38:33] little heavy in the foot especially when
[2:38:36] I'm on the phone or a good song is
[2:38:37] playing you know speeding is against the
[2:38:40] law right that's not actually following
[2:38:42] the ordinance of the king we have laws
[2:38:45] of the land we're supposed to Render
[2:38:46] unto Caesar what's Caesar's but give God
[2:38:48] what's God's brothers and sisters SS but
[2:38:50] here we have the instruction of the word
[2:38:52] of God for us to not be trying to to to
[2:38:55] find loopholes and to find Solutions but
[2:38:58] to actually do the right thing because
[2:39:01] people are watching our
[2:39:03] lives and once again I'll say this you
[2:39:06] know what if we're doing that
[2:39:07] continually God has a way of sorting us
[2:39:10] out and it might not be tomorrow and it
[2:39:12] might not be next week but it might be
[2:39:14] in the life of our children it might be
[2:39:16] in a situation that we're like how can
[2:39:18] that possibly
[2:39:20] be but God will allow things to happen
[2:39:23] we're dealing with God's timing God's
[2:39:25] economy we need to know exactly where we
[2:39:28] stand not for our sake sometimes for our
[2:39:30] children's sake for our wi sake for our
[2:39:32] husband's sake for our church
[2:39:37] sake we need to make sure that
[2:39:39] we do the will of
[2:39:46] God verse 16 as free and not
[2:39:50] using your
[2:39:52] Liberty for a cloak of
[2:39:56] maliciousness but as the Servants of God
[2:40:00] and you know when we do when people know
[2:40:02] that we're a Christian and we beat our
[2:40:03] chest and say I'm a Christian I go to
[2:40:05] church I believe the message of the hour
[2:40:07] but then we go and we do things that are
[2:40:09] underhanded what does that do that
[2:40:12] completely undermines Our Testimony it
[2:40:14] completely erodes the faith that people
[2:40:17] have in the god in which we serve amen
[2:40:19] amen they say why would I do that
[2:40:21] because that's just like I expected the
[2:40:23] religious
[2:40:25] covering it says honor all men verse 17
[2:40:28] love the Brotherhood fear God honor the
[2:40:30] king servants be subject to your masters
[2:40:33] with all fear and not only to the good
[2:40:36] and gentle but also to the forward how
[2:40:38] many servants do we have
[2:40:41] here we can take that word out I'm not
[2:40:44] going to add to or take away I just want
[2:40:45] to try and bring a little bit of light
[2:40:47] to the situation employees let's put
[2:40:49] that word in there
[2:40:51] employees
[2:40:53] employees be subject to your Masters
[2:40:56] your bosses with all fear and not only
[2:41:00] to the good and gentle but also to the
[2:41:02] forward the ones that are real tough to
[2:41:04] deal with those hard task Masters be
[2:41:08] gentle and good to them for this is
[2:41:11] thankworthy if a man for conscience
[2:41:15] toward God endure grief suffering
[2:41:18] wrongfully
[2:41:20] for what glory is it if you be buffeted
[2:41:22] for your faults you shall take it
[2:41:24] patiently but if when you do well and
[2:41:27] suffer for it you take it patiently this
[2:41:30] is acceptable with
[2:41:33] God why not always needing to be right
[2:41:38] not always needing to be on top not
[2:41:40] always needing to get the last word in
[2:41:42] but to say hey you know what if this is
[2:41:44] what the Lord wants then that's okay
[2:41:46] blessed be the name of the Lord to
[2:41:49] endure with patience a and to Rejoice is
[2:41:52] what we heard in verse 16 Rejoice ever
[2:41:54] more and pray without ceasing thanking
[2:41:57] the lord verse 21 says for even here
[2:42:00] unto were ye called because Christ also
[2:42:04] suffered for us leaving us a what an
[2:42:08] example that ye should follow in his
[2:42:10] steps
[2:42:11] [Music]
[2:42:13] amen he do who did not sin neither was
[2:42:15] guile found in his
[2:42:17] mouth I say Lord help
[2:42:20] me who when he was reviled reviled not
[2:42:23] again when he suffered he threatened not
[2:42:27] now we know the story all too well he
[2:42:30] could have gone like that he could have
[2:42:33] just batted his eye and had 12 Legions
[2:42:36] of angels destroying
[2:42:39] everyone but he didn't for our
[2:42:42] sake so that he could die and and redeem
[2:42:46] all those that were his but also to give
[2:42:48] us an example a Godly example of how to
[2:42:51] live our lives even when we're
[2:42:56] persecuted who when he was reviled
[2:42:58] reviled not again when he suffered he
[2:43:01] threatened not but committed himself to
[2:43:03] him that judgeth
[2:43:06] righteously who his own self bear our
[2:43:09] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[2:43:12] being dead to
[2:43:14] sins should live unto
[2:43:17] righteousness by whose Stripes ye were
[2:43:20] healed past tense already
[2:43:24] done for ye were as sheep going astray
[2:43:27] but are now returned unto the shepherd
[2:43:30] and the bishop of your souls brothers
[2:43:32] and sisters what a wonderful thought
[2:43:34] that is he has already corrected us and
[2:43:38] brought us in he's already paid the
[2:43:40] reproach for our sins and all we need to
[2:43:42] do is follow his word because his word
[2:43:45] is his will
[2:43:47] amen it doesn't matter where we're at
[2:43:49] doesn't matter what job we're at doesn't
[2:43:52] matter where we're living doesn't matter
[2:43:54] what pit we're in what jail we're in
[2:43:56] doesn't matter maybe what palace we're
[2:43:58] living in or or how high we're flying it
[2:44:01] doesn't matter how much money we've got
[2:44:03] we just need to remember God's will his
[2:44:06] word every step of the
[2:44:10] way there's no
[2:44:12] shortcuts you know we all have to learn
[2:44:14] obedience is what we read about on
[2:44:16] Wednesday the saman church age for those
[2:44:19] maybe weren't here if you're curious
[2:44:22] about it the saman church age under the
[2:44:23] exposition of the seven Church ages we
[2:44:25] all have to learn obedience just like
[2:44:27] Jesus did through the things that we
[2:44:28] suffer because that's how he learned
[2:44:30] obedience was the things that he
[2:44:32] suffered how could we actually
[2:44:35] circumvent that how could we have a
[2:44:38] shortcut I think it's so amazing though
[2:44:41] brothers and sisters going back to kind
[2:44:43] of where we started is we want to feel
[2:44:45] find sorry God's word for our lives we
[2:44:48] want to to see his word fulfilled in our
[2:44:51] lives and you know like I said I had
[2:44:54] that conversation with the Lord and I
[2:44:56] believe he showed me this it's just
[2:44:58] amazing when you look at it because you
[2:44:59] can see clearly that his will is his
[2:45:02] word and it doesn't matter where you're
[2:45:03] at or what you're going through if we're
[2:45:05] willing to actually put his word first
[2:45:07] in our situation we will see him with us
[2:45:12] am so you know this question about
[2:45:14] looking into the scripture about his
[2:45:16] will a a scriptural question brothers
[2:45:18] and sisters it has to equal a scriptural
[2:45:21] answer where there's a deep calling what
[2:45:24] there has to be a deep to respond right
[2:45:27] that's the way we believe so look back
[2:45:29] to the Old Testament if if you want to
[2:45:31] maybe just turn with me to Genesis
[2:45:33] Chapter 30 we're just sort of getting
[2:45:35] started with this I think it's beautiful
[2:45:37] even though we're getting close to
[2:45:38] running out of time I'm not going to try
[2:45:41] and hold us late
[2:45:42] today but I just really want to take a
[2:45:45] look a good look at the life of Joseph
[2:45:47] there's so many different things that
[2:45:49] happened in his life that are just so
[2:45:52] relevant to us in our
[2:45:54] day and and as an example understanding
[2:45:58] that Joseph was a type of Christ knowing
[2:46:01] that full well Genesis chapter 23 just
[2:46:05] just looking at where did Joseph come
[2:46:07] from just to sort of set a background as
[2:46:10] a study you know what what happened here
[2:46:13] he came from we know Rachel and and the
[2:46:16] and the union of Jacob the the Shyer and
[2:46:20] and
[2:46:22] Rachel Genesis CH 30 verse
[2:46:31] 23 and she conceived and bear a son and
[2:46:35] said God hath taken away my
[2:46:39] reproach and she called his name Joseph
[2:46:42] and said the Lord shall add to me
[2:46:45] another
[2:46:47] son I just just wanted to mention that
[2:46:50] because we can see in the scripture here
[2:46:54] where Joseph came from his
[2:46:56] beginning and I had never really seen
[2:46:59] this before I started really looking at
[2:47:00] this and it's just uh a really neat
[2:47:03] thing to see we know that Jacob was his
[2:47:05] father and Rachel was his mother and his
[2:47:08] brother was
[2:47:10] Benjamin and Jacob he had four
[2:47:15] wives and you know he made the deal with
[2:47:18] his father father-in-law for the sake of
[2:47:20] time I'm just going to mention it you
[2:47:21] can go and read the story it's a real
[2:47:22] good one if you haven't read it recently
[2:47:25] but he made a deal with his
[2:47:26] father-in-law who actually was his uncle
[2:47:30] his mother's brother for his daughter
[2:47:33] and we know that he had two daughters at
[2:47:35] the time Leah and Rachel and Leah was
[2:47:40] tendere eyed but Rachel she was
[2:47:42] beautiful and we know that he fell in
[2:47:44] love with her immediately when he met
[2:47:46] her he immediately fell in love with her
[2:47:48] Rachel and and the father-in-law when he
[2:47:51] did the right thing and asked the
[2:47:52] father-in-law you know can I have your
[2:47:54] daughter in marriage and and he said
[2:47:56] sure you can but you know I can't let
[2:47:59] her go that easy because she means a lot
[2:48:01] to me and you know if you are to take
[2:48:03] her I think it would be real good for
[2:48:05] you to earn your stripes and show that
[2:48:07] you can provide for her while providing
[2:48:09] for me secretly but provide for her as a
[2:48:13] husband and actually just stick around
[2:48:15] for seven years and then you can have
[2:48:17] her and we know that so he said hey if
[2:48:19] that's all it takes no problem s years
[2:48:21] of Labor I'm in so he stuck around for S
[2:48:24] years worked for his father-in-law and
[2:48:26] we know that he was
[2:48:28] duped at the wedding when it was time to
[2:48:31] consummate the marriage the father
[2:48:33] quickly swapped the daughters and sent
[2:48:35] in Leah instead of Rachel the one that
[2:48:37] he made the deal for and in the morning
[2:48:39] when he recognized whoa this is
[2:48:41] different than what I anticipated this
[2:48:43] ain't the deal we made and he said it to
[2:48:45] his father-in-law he said yeah well
[2:48:47] we've got you know there's one little
[2:48:49] little uh little fine print here that we
[2:48:51] didn't mention before and that's we
[2:48:52] can't let the the the younger one go
[2:48:54] before the older one gets married so
[2:48:56] we've got to actually just do it that
[2:48:58] way and he said you know what give me my
[2:48:59] wife I want her and he said well if
[2:49:01] that's the case you can do it but
[2:49:03] unfortunately we've got this rule about
[2:49:05] the seven-year labor thing so stick
[2:49:07] around another seven years and you can
[2:49:08] have her so he said okay if that's all
[2:49:11] it's going to take seven more years I'm
[2:49:13] in cuz I love
[2:49:15] her but you know it's interesting the
[2:49:17] thing that I never saw before is that
[2:49:20] the word of God says that he hated Leah
[2:49:24] but he loved
[2:49:26] Rachel what kind of children do you
[2:49:29] think would be conceived with someone in
[2:49:32] a union where there's
[2:49:36] hatred I wondered why these brothers
[2:49:38] hated them so much but it becomes
[2:49:41] crystal clear in the
[2:49:43] scriptures oh yeah
[2:49:46] right so here we have
[2:49:51] zilpa who was the maid servant to Leah
[2:49:54] and baa who was the maid servant to
[2:49:57] Rachel they were also given to him with
[2:49:59] the wives it was a package deal so
[2:50:02] instead of just him getting two wives he
[2:50:04] got
[2:50:05] four for the price of two 14 years of
[2:50:10] Labor he gets four wives but it was
[2:50:13] through these four wives that Jacob had
[2:50:16] the 12 Patriarchs of the tribes of of
[2:50:19] Israel and it says in the word of God
[2:50:22] there was only one that he loved and
[2:50:23] it's interesting because he only had two
[2:50:25] boys with that one that he loved and and
[2:50:28] the one is Joseph and the other one is
[2:50:31] Benjamin and we know Benjamin was a real
[2:50:34] special
[2:50:36] Brother Joseph at 17 years old in
[2:50:39] Genesis
[2:50:40] 37 maybe turn over there quickly while
[2:50:42] we still have amen a couple
[2:50:46] minutes amen Genesis chapter
[2:50:54] 37 this is where this story really
[2:50:56] starts to pick up pace and where I
[2:50:58] really wanted to get to and it's just in
[2:51:00] time to close so I guess we'll maybe try
[2:51:02] and pick up some next week Lord
[2:51:05] willing Genesis CH 37 verse 1 and Jacob
[2:51:08] dwelt in the land wherein his father was
[2:51:12] a stranger in the land of
[2:51:14] Canaan these are the generations of
[2:51:17] Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was
[2:51:21] feeding the flock with his Brethren and
[2:51:24] the lad was with the sons of bilah and
[2:51:28] with the sons of zilpa his father's
[2:51:31] wives and Joseph brought unto his father
[2:51:36] what their evil
[2:51:39] report these weren't the the the sons
[2:51:42] these weren't the brothers of the one
[2:51:44] whom his father
[2:51:46] loved these were the ones that were just
[2:51:48] sort of of the package
[2:51:50] deal verse three now Israel loved Joseph
[2:51:54] Jacob Israel we know that Jacob's name
[2:51:57] was changed God changed his walk we
[2:52:00] skipped over that part but we know that
[2:52:02] his dad Joseph's dad Israel loved Joseph
[2:52:05] more than all his children because he
[2:52:08] was the son of his old age and he made
[2:52:11] him a coat of many
[2:52:13] colors and we know this is a very
[2:52:16] popular very famous Bible story
[2:52:21] excuse
[2:52:22] me a very popular Bible story the cat of
[2:52:25] Many Colors I remember it when I was
[2:52:27] going to Sunday school as a
[2:52:29] kid but the
[2:52:31] Brethren they hated him and could not
[2:52:35] speak peaceably unto him can imagine
[2:52:39] they always had a chip on their shoulder
[2:52:41] because daddy loved him
[2:52:42] more every single time they interacted
[2:52:45] with him it was abrasive it was it was
[2:52:48] it was with something they hated him and
[2:52:51] could not speak peaceably unto him and
[2:52:54] the footnote in my Bible says friendly
[2:52:56] they just couldn't be friendly to him
[2:52:58] because they they were jealous they knew
[2:53:00] their dad loved him more verse 5 says
[2:53:04] and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told
[2:53:06] it his Brethren and they hated him yet
[2:53:09] the
[2:53:10] more as I read this I keep thinking how
[2:53:13] how much could they really hate
[2:53:15] him it's his they're Brothers
[2:53:19] and he said unto them here I pray you
[2:53:21] this dream verse six which I have
[2:53:24] dreamed for behold we were binding sheep
[2:53:27] in the field and lo my sheath arose and
[2:53:30] also stood upright and behold your
[2:53:34] sheathes stood round about and made
[2:53:36] obedience to my sheath can you imagine
[2:53:40] that no
[2:53:42] fear knowing that they don't speak
[2:53:45] friendly to him but he's going to tell
[2:53:46] them the dream in his heart anyways
[2:53:49] because he's a Believer he's a genuine
[2:53:52] believer who was conceived in
[2:53:55] love the other ones weren't that's right
[2:53:59] but isn't it wild when you think about
[2:54:01] it you take one step back and you say
[2:54:03] wow those are the Patriarchs of the
[2:54:04] tribes of the children of
[2:54:07] Israel isn't it interesting that there
[2:54:09] was only two children from the marriage
[2:54:11] that was loved and and and the rest of
[2:54:13] them the other 10 were from other
[2:54:16] relations from the same Daddy
[2:54:19] isn't it interesting the children of
[2:54:21] Israel when they sent the spies into the
[2:54:23] land two of them only were able to say
[2:54:27] Amen we're more than able but 10 of them
[2:54:30] said no way there's no way that we can
[2:54:32] go over
[2:54:33] there where did they come from those
[2:54:35] other 10 Valiant men from those tribes
[2:54:39] brothers and sisters right that seed
[2:54:41] Gene carries on and Carries On and
[2:54:44] Carries On but isn't it wild to think
[2:54:46] that even though Naturally Speaking we
[2:54:48] can say I've got those things that try
[2:54:50] to carry on in my life we know there is
[2:54:53] a chain breaker we know there is a way
[2:54:55] maker we know there is a living God he
[2:54:58] has given us the ability to Step Beyond
[2:55:01] all of that generational garbage that we
[2:55:03] would otherwise be contending with and
[2:55:06] that's what causes the human being
[2:55:08] outside of having the Holy Ghost to be a
[2:55:10] brute
[2:55:11] Beast because a loving human being
[2:55:14] wouldn't want to sell their brother into
[2:55:15] slavery a loving human being wouldn't
[2:55:18] want to kill him wouldn't want to throw
[2:55:20] him in a pit wouldn't want to just take
[2:55:22] a the coat that their dad made for him
[2:55:25] and dip it in Blood and take it back to
[2:55:27] their dad and kill their dad and say oh
[2:55:29] your poor precious Golden Child he's
[2:55:32] dead a wild animal must have caught him
[2:55:35] we know that story all too well but
[2:55:37] remember they killed their
[2:55:41] dad for some reason they might have
[2:55:43] thought maybe that can urge inside of us
[2:55:48] will actually get Daddy to love us
[2:55:50] more and all they had to do was actually
[2:55:53] love the one that he loved and daddy
[2:55:55] would have loved them
[2:55:57] more but it was exactly opposite because
[2:56:00] he didn't have they didn't have the
[2:56:02] right nature they couldn't they were
[2:56:05] conceived
[2:56:07] wrong Israel loved Joseph more than all
[2:56:11] of his children what an amazing
[2:56:13] thing verse eight and his Brethren said
[2:56:16] unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us
[2:56:19] or shalt thou indeed have dominion over
[2:56:22] us you could just
[2:56:25] imagine maybe a bunch of teenagers or
[2:56:28] young
[2:56:29] adults and then a child like brother
[2:56:32] Isaiah saying you know I had a
[2:56:36] dream that my sheave actually watched
[2:56:39] your sheaves bow down to my she could
[2:56:43] you imagine how the young adult brothers
[2:56:44] would
[2:56:45] be they'd probably be tripping him every
[2:56:48] chance they got they'd probably be
[2:56:49] pushing them around and mocking him
[2:56:51] making it very difficult for him because
[2:56:54] of jealousy because of Pride the
[2:56:56] original sin that Satan had in his life
[2:56:59] iniquity was found in his heart
[2:57:05] right verse eight and his Brethren said
[2:57:08] unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us
[2:57:10] or shalt thou indeed have dominion over
[2:57:12] us and they hated him yet the more for
[2:57:14] his dreams and for his words
[2:57:18] and it just compounds verse 9 and he
[2:57:21] dreamed yet another dream that's where
[2:57:23] you have to say oh my and told it his
[2:57:26] Brethren and said behold I have dreamed
[2:57:28] a dream more and behold the Sun and the
[2:57:31] Moon and the 11 stars made obedience to
[2:57:34] me and he told it to his father and to
[2:57:37] his Brethren and we know that his father
[2:57:39] rebuked him and said unto him what is
[2:57:41] this dream that thou Hast dreamed what
[2:57:44] you talking about boy shall I and thy
[2:57:47] mother and th Brethren indeed come to
[2:57:49] bow down ourselves to thee to the
[2:57:53] Earth and that's exactly what
[2:57:56] happened isn't it amen the sun moon and
[2:58:00] the stars we know that he was so highly
[2:58:03] exalted that he was above everything and
[2:58:07] he still is and he always will be and we
[2:58:10] just have the ability to recognize that
[2:58:12] just by his grace we are saved through
[2:58:15] faith in this word amen it's just such
[2:58:18] an amazing thing verse 11 and his
[2:58:19] Brethren envied him oh but his father
[2:58:23] observed the
[2:58:24] saying someone somewhere along the way
[2:58:26] said hey there's something about this
[2:58:28] we've got to actually just take note of
[2:58:31] it and you know it is 12:00 I don't want
[2:58:33] to hold us long I I'm just going to
[2:58:35] press pause there I'll call the
[2:58:37] musicians I I just want to say brothers
[2:58:39] and sisters it's really impressed on my
[2:58:41] heart to recognize God's will for our
[2:58:43] lives and his will is his word it's not
[2:58:46] a denominational teaching it's not some
[2:58:48] sort of mess message oity it it's none
[2:58:51] of that it's the will of God is his word
[2:58:54] for us in our day it is truly the
[2:58:57] entirety of the message of the hour and
[2:59:00] when we have his word when he abides in
[2:59:02] us when we abide in him and he abides in
[2:59:05] us we can ask what we will and we'll
[2:59:07] have it we don't have to be afraid
[2:59:09] brothers and sisters and and really
[2:59:10] where I'm going with this is I want to
[2:59:12] say if we've got something on our heart
[2:59:14] to do if we've got something on our
[2:59:16] heart that the Lord has been leading us
[2:59:18] to that just keeps coming how do you
[2:59:19] know it's the
[2:59:21] Lord maybe stand with me as we close or
[2:59:24] I won't close I'll keep preaching it's
[2:59:26] just so much on my heart with this how
[2:59:28] do we know it's God speaking to us
[2:59:31] because many times we'll have an idea
[2:59:32] keep coming to us an idea keeps coming
[2:59:34] to us if it's in line with the word then
[2:59:36] it's God if it's not contravening the
[2:59:39] word of God then it's God but if it's
[2:59:43] one iota stepping outside of the bounds
[2:59:46] of the word of God brothers and sisters
[2:59:47] leave it Al alone because it will lead
[2:59:49] you astray it'll take you right into the
[2:59:51] unpromised land and and you know we'll
[2:59:54] get into this it's the permissive will
[2:59:56] of God because if you're a son and
[2:59:57] daughter of God you're gods and you're
[2:59:59] going to go all the way but you can get
[3:00:02] into the permissive will of God and
[3:00:04] that's where life gets really prickly
[3:00:06] that's where life gets really difficult
[3:00:08] and all we need to do is just go back
[3:00:10] and repent brother bradam says it just
[3:00:12] go back to where you got off and just
[3:00:14] get straight with God allow him to fix
[3:00:17] the problem the way he wants to and
[3:00:19] everything will be all right it's not
[3:00:22] going to be without trials or
[3:00:23] tribulations though remember his will is
[3:00:26] his word and he wants every one of us to
[3:00:29] be in good health and prosper he doesn't
[3:00:31] want to see any one of us downtrodden
[3:00:33] and Destroy none of his children will be
[3:00:35] begging bread brothers and sisters
[3:00:38] amen serving God is not a vow of poverty
[3:00:42] but it's not about actually being rich
[3:00:44] and famous either it's that Paradox of
[3:00:47] understanding that will meet every
[3:00:48] single need in my
[3:00:51] life let's just bow in prayer gracious
[3:00:54] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[3:00:56] your word Lord Jesus we thank you for
[3:00:59] your will father we thank you for your
[3:01:02] message that you've given to us through
[3:01:03] a Vindicated prophet in the day in which
[3:01:05] we live father and we thank you for
[3:01:07] giving us ears to hear what your spirit
[3:01:10] said through that man father we know
[3:01:12] that that is the way that's the way that
[3:01:15] was chosen for you to speak to man
[3:01:17] through to a prophet and father we just
[3:01:20] receive the prophet in the name of a
[3:01:23] prophet looking to that prophet's reward
[3:01:26] and we know that that's life eternal we
[3:01:27] know that that's overcoming power here
[3:01:30] father because Lord until you take us
[3:01:32] out of the way father we have to fight
[3:01:34] the battle we've got to live in this
[3:01:36] world and how could we ever do it
[3:01:38] without your spirit living out through
[3:01:40] us and we know that the message of the
[3:01:42] hour came so that we could get your
[3:01:44] spirit truly get the baptism of the Holy
[3:01:47] Ghost
[3:01:48] father we love you and we thank you I
[3:01:51] pray father for each family Lord
[3:01:54] Jesus each each person represented here
[3:01:57] today maybe those who are streaming or
[3:01:59] watching later those who aren't here
[3:02:01] father maybe in
[3:02:03] Lethbridge oh Father each and every one
[3:02:05] Lord Jesus let us discover your true
[3:02:09] will for us in our lives Lord father
[3:02:11] that we could see the power of you
[3:02:15] living out through US Lord not for a
[3:02:17] show but Lord Jesus so that we can
[3:02:19] overcome that we can overcome
[3:02:22] ourselves father we love you and we
[3:02:24] thank you we just pray that you would
[3:02:26] keep your hand upon us today as we go
[3:02:28] our separate ways that you would just
[3:02:30] continue revealing yourself father to us
[3:02:33] and through US Lord
[3:02:34] Jesus and help us father we pray that if
[3:02:37] we're going through a trial that we
[3:02:39] would not actually become seared with a
[3:02:43] hot iron but that we would actually
[3:02:45] receive what it is you want for us to
[3:02:48] get out of it Lord we love you and we
[3:02:50] thank you we ask all these things in
[3:02:52] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[3:02:56] amen just made me think about it I
[3:02:58] remember a brother saying it and for
[3:03:00] those people who know him you might know
[3:03:02] the
[3:03:03] saying don't waste the
[3:03:05] pain we all get pain and it's for a
[3:03:07] reason don't waste it the reason we have
[3:03:10] it is so that we can learn and grow from
[3:03:12] it
[3:03:13] amen God bless you this morning can we
[3:03:17] sing can you hear the sound from Heaven
[3:03:20] it's like the sound of many
[3:03:22] [Music]
[3:03:24] Waters
