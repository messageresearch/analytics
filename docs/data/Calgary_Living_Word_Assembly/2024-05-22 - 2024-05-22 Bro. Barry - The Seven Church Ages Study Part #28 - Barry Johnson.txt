ask now that we could commit the rest of this service into your hands father For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you musicians thank you for your efforts tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to continue on reading in Revelations chapter 2 Revelations chapter 2 Revelations chapter 2 verse 8 and unto the angel of the church in samna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the Blas of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and you may have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life amen he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father we're so thankful that Lord we cannot be hurt by the second death we're so thankful that you've given us ears to hear Lord Jesus what your spirit says to the church father tonight I pray that as we peel back the pages of this book and we read the words that you spoke through the prophet to this age Lord that it wouldn't just be something that we read that it wouldn't just be a traditional teaching or a fairy tale but Lord that these words that we hear they would become very real to us Lord that we would Lord not want to try and make this word adapt to fit our lives but that we would recognize the only way for us to not be heard of the second death is to adapt Our Lives to this word father we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I uh pray the Lord will be gracious to us and we'll still have a voice to be able to go over this certainly thankful for the the teaching here in this book it's just been tremendous for me I know myself and I'm sure it's been good for a few others just a few announcements um we've got the communion service coming up this Sunday that'll be at 5:30 we have brother Dela at delodon he'll be here on June the 2nd June the 6th we have the prayer meeting the first Thursday of the month as we agreed to in the uh men's meeting we have brother Mario Chua here on June the 9th which is a Sunday and we have a special worship service on uh June 23rd that will be an evening service and uh if you want to worship that will be a good one to come to brother Cadre digs will be here June 26th that will be a Wednesday and uh we have the the youth uh event will be at our house on June the 30th and I do have a revision that I need to make and uh I do apologize I've been misquoting this for a few Services now we'll have brother Jack Duff here on Wednesday June the 12th I've been saying July the 12th and it's June the 12th that we'll have brother Jack Duff here are you happy tonight where we left off last week um I believe that it was just so good I read it on Sunday and you know just talking about the spoken word seed and the bride and uh how you know we did not become seed by the rebirth and how there's a uh a very traditional teaching that somewhere along the way we recognize that we are seed and uh it's true that we do realize that we're seed we don't just become seed and that is what the traditional teaching is is that one day we become a seed of God and if we were uh if we are a seed of God then we always were a seed of God brother bam says that we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed that is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken hold this carefully in mind remember the children of Israel when they came out of bondage and they saw all the mighty signs and wonders God delivered them from 430 years of hard bondage under the task Master's whips people never knew any portion of Freedom the only thing they knew is what it meant to be a slave and to actually be under the Dominion of the task Masters and if they wanted you to die then you died if they wanted to take your wife they took your wife if they wanted to kill and abuse your children that's what they did because they were task Masters and you know brother brandom says it very clearly that those people when they came out into the Wilderness the reason they weren't able to go on into the promised land is because they never had Faith to mix with that word when it came when the prophet came and brought the word and told them at Kadesh barnea you need to not do what you're doing you need to change your ways and repent and they said nope no no we're going to do it our way that is when they all fell away and it's because they were not seed they were Shu and there always has to be a shu to protect the seed but the life will never ever change the life is always the same and it just keeps progressing pressing through the plant but in the non seat there's nothing to Quicken hold this carefully in mind is what the prophet says here paragraph 175 he says now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death shed Blood Bought back his own he didn't buy another he didn't just one day go searching for some people that he could find he bought back what he already owned amen he bought back the spoken word seed bride amen my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep and this is a beautiful thing I just it's so beautiful because many people can come around the word and many people can quote the word and many people can act like the word but not everyone can live the word those who live the word are the true seed bride of Christ they're the ones who always were sheep he goes on to say you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and upon hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God Amen I love that not that we're going to be that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son save me oh my father I am returning to thee amen a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son isn't that wonderful that's why brothers and sisters we can't point the finger at anybody else as soon as we start pointing the finger at anybody else we've got three pointing right back at ourselves we're not interested in trying to figure out who is the Son of God and who is not that's God's business to do amen our business is to get ourselves in line with this word amen hallelujah a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son blessed be the name of the Lord it took me 33 years in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hen you know that eagle is a type of the True Believer well a farmer took an egg from under an eagle's nest and he placed it under a hen in due time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but that little Eagle could not figure out the clucking and scratching for food in the manure pile he managed to make a living but was pretty confused about it all but one day from way up in the air the mother Eagle that laid that had that had laid the egg spied that little eag e on the ground she swooped down with a tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her he had never heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try I just wonder today how many people are actually afraid to try don't be afraid to try brother and sister if you've got that desire again again that mother screamed for him to rise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid many times I think we try and connect the dots we try and wonder well how am I going to do it don't think about how you're going to do it just do it just jump and flap your wings brother bradam says just just jump one time he says once more she called out screaming that he try beating his wings he hurled himself into the air and answering the Cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies you see he was always an eagle he wasn't a chicken that turned into an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the Great Eagle he came to his own place and once a true Son of God hears the Cry of the Spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I just think that's such a beautiful statement such a beautiful story isn't it now comes our triumphal Capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost Galatians 44-7 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts amen crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished Redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as Sons I just think that's so beautiful thereby placed us as Sons he did not make us Sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless and hear this and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father amen and that's what we do every single time we come to service brothers and sisters it's not just because we receive the word of God when we come to service we come to service to worship amen and we know the highest form of worship is the preaching of the word but when we have the opportunity to close our eyes and open our hearts raise our hands and sing praise unto the Lord that is not something that's just a traditional form it's not something that's just taken for granted you're singing to the king of kings and Lord of lords and what we do here who we are here remember is who we're going to be there we're not just going to suddenly become worshippers when we get over there that's not going to happen if you don't worship here I don't know will you worship over there upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons at Corinth upon sons while they heard the word what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God what we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all believed the doctrine of the Oneness of the godhead for there are not three persons in that godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of Jesus coming in and then subsequent to that the Holy Spirit coming in to give us power if that were true why are we dishonoring the father by not giving him a part in our complete Sal salvation for if salvation is of the lord and there are three Lords then he father must have something to do too but surely it can be seen that Jesus made this very clear that it was he and he alone who is God just so clear and it is he and he alone who is coming into the believer John 14:6 says that the father will send another comforter but in verse 17 says that he Jesus dwelleth in them and should be in them later in verse 18 he says he will come to them in verse 23 in speaking to the disciples he said we father and son will come unto him thus it is Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at the one time for it is one person amen Rising the godhead that advent took place at Pentecost there aren't two comings of the spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth and they simply believe in Jesus for remission of sin but never go on to receive the spirit I say oh Lord help us to go on to receive the spirit am don't let us just stay stuck in a rut where we think that we're saved and everything is fine paragraph 183 before I close this subject I know know there is a question in your minds you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls anymore than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that's it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Romans 9:13 and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that good sorry it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God am but if you know the story which we do very well he wasn't a very good guy for all intents and purposes outwardly speaking looking upon them as men we know that Esau was a gentleman Esau was a good Hunter Esau was fine upstanding and Jacob what did the prophet say he was a Shyer he was a Shifty one he was willing to go and pull a dirty deal and we know that his mom encouraged him in it but that didn't change that fact that he was the seed Gene word of God inside of him which gave him the desire to go after that birth rate and that's why every one of us has the desire to follow this message of the hour because there's a seed Gene word of God in every one of us amen if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day amen and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you again note Jesus was the royal seed he lived in a human body when the spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to the Jordan and was there baptized in water upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved Son hear ye him the voice did not say this has become my son Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost positioned him as that son before them all then having being filled thus and the same pattern holds at Pentecost and Ever After he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives let me show you most clearly The Seven Ages as set forth in Revelations chap 2 and 3 take in the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles or the whole time in which God is dealing with the Gentiles unto salvation in every single age Bar None it says the very same thing in opening and closing the message to each age unto the messenger of Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia leoda right these things saith he etc etc he that hath an ear let him singular hear what the spirit saith to the churches notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age that's very important Point only one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church that's where a lot of people will say that this man fell off his rocker and went off on his Doctrine but we know for sure there's all the church ages we know we have a specific identity and what makes these people stand out and how they fit this description he goes on to say he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God so beautiful and so perfectly clearly laid out there's no private interpretation to the message of the hour saying that I can take it and just put my own spin on it or I can take it and just live it the way that my church teaches it or that the way my parents taught it or the way my pastor brought it all of it's fine if it lines up with the word of God Amen if it doesn't line up with the word of God brothers and sisters it's not going to take you in the Rapture it's got to be according to the messenger for the age now think it not strange that this is the case for Paul set this pattern under the hand of God Paul alone had the Revelation for his day as evidenced by his con confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that Paul was the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for that day and also noted by actual illustration in the word that when Paul desired to go to Asia God forbade him for the Sheep his children were in Macedonia and they the macedonians would hear what the spirit had to say through Paul while the people in Asia would not in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught are you thankful that you're Faithfully taught and you know brothers and sisters I'm not even saying brother Barry I I just want to stick as close as I can to this word this is the only anchor that I've got the only navigation the only GPS that I've got is the messenger's message the word that God gave to a Vindicated Prophet that's the only thing that I've got to bring but if you've got ears to hear somewhere along the way somebody must have taught you correctly so that you're able to take this word when it's spoken it's so beautiful and every age has exactly the same pattern amen oh my but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken they might say they're a teacher they might say that they're an apostle they might say that they're a prophetic class of people and God's able to show them further light there's nothing further than what this Prophet brought everything falls under this prophet there is no greater Revelation because this Prophet taught what Paul taught and Paul was the first pattern Setter he was the first age messenger and every single messenger after Paul Falls right under the ministry of Paul and preached exactly what Paul preached amen remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord not the Commandments of Paul not the Commandments of the message of the hour not the Commandments of some church like Calgary Living Word the Commandments of the Lord what came the word of God out from you or came it to you only this is God's word this is God's work we only preach what Paul preached that's what brother brandham brought and the thing is this world is set up now in such a way that everything in this world is contrary to this word of God and you know what we can say just about everything and we're not going to go too far with that tonight but brothers and sisters it it is not it's not a joking time it's not time to play Church it is so much later than we think this Beast system is fully fully in place 100% already there and the only thing that has to happen is the rapture of the bride and when that happens look out it's going to go crazy paragraph 189 they add here or take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what he had given by Revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of God by the way of his Messengers and then say what has been given them to say to the churches there's no other messenger after William Miriam brandham he was that messenger for this age we just need to press play and Obey amen hear what the messenger said amen yes I hope you are beginning to see it now perhaps you can understand now why I don't hold with a fundamentalist and the Pentecostals I have to hold to what the word I have to hold to the word the way the Lord revealed it now I did not cover it all that would take a separate book but by the help of the lord we will get many sermons and tapes and messages on all these points to help you understand and dovetail all scripture he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches of each age in every age it was the same cry amen hear what the spirit says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age amen we won't be making excuses we won't be trying to find a loophole we won't be doing our own thing we'll be going exactly with the word every Messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age amen The Cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of God repent and come back to the word from the first book in the Bible Genesis to the last book revelation there was only one reason for God's displeasure isn't that easy and simple doesn't it just make it so clear there's only one reason for God's displeasure and that's leaving the word making some sort of cultural change saying oh pants that's that was for a different culture a different age that's old fashioned cutting your hair etc etc etc just leaving the word that's what displeases God and there was only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word and I just think that's so beautiful because that's how we can tell this is a prophet of God this is a god Prophet saying back to the word not I'm going to write my own book and I'm going to put my own spin on it and say that there's some great new revelation that's come that's outside of the Gospel no every single line back to the word amen yes in the Ephesian age and in this the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Goden this is my Earnest prayer for all of us that we may hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today and that brings us to the end of the samran church age I uh I guess I'll just call the musicians I'm just joking we still got some time would that be okay if I did that sometime when people get upset you know what I want to do is actually uh I want to do a recap so it's beautiful I went through and I just started thinking you know where's where's the high points in this there's so many points that we have you know we've gone over in this in this study and I'm just going to I'm just going to hit on them you don't have to try and find them Isaac you know uh just talking about this the messenger we know the messenger was irius for this for this church age and he stood solidly for a unified spirit filled gift manifesting local church it wasn't about uh having a a bishop over a couple of churches and congregations and you know a conglomeration it wasn't about that at all he was very clear on his understanding of the godhead and and we know that he was the right choice for the age and uh brother bradam says in here that it's unfortunate that the other ages did not have in their Messengers such a balance of fruit power and leadership in the Holy Spirit and the word what a tremendous admonition that is to think that someone could actually have that in their life and I don't think that's exclusive to him I believe every one of us could have that am you know it was a it was a bitter age filled with death we know that's what Suna means and uh you know I remember brother Ken preaching this uh quite early on in my walk with the Lord and uh I just it stuck with me and brother Bram he says in here that uh no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God and I say Lord help us to have help us to be oh my to have the knowledge of and adherence to that's all it is that the knowledge of it and the adherence to just sticking with the word of God when the word comes and corrects us just say Amen thank you Lord thank you that you love me enough to correct me it's not about getting my back up and saying you're just a a little two bit uneducated little fella up there thinking you can just preach the gospel it's not about that at all this is this is the Holy Ghost when we come to church when we come to church brothers and sisters if we don't come to church expecting to hear from the Holy Spirit then we've come to church for the wrong reason because that's why we gather here we Gather in in in in the name of Jesus Christ to invite him to speak to us to change our lives to correct us to give us extra overcoming power in our lives and I just think this is so good no no no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than as knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God now some people could say oh I know the Bible inside and out but do we know the message inside and out if we do know the message inside and out plus the Bible inside and out do we live it inside and out it's pretty easy to say that we do but to actually do it is a totally different thing you know I just think these uh little nuggets are so good I'm going to try and go through quick so we don't have to carry on with this we can get into the next one the next chapter uh next time you know uh brother bradam he talks about it how uh my the sorian church age it's just bringing up memories of Prior Services I apologize for just pausing like that but you know the one service we took we we got into how the people brother Bram says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love remember elect of love the proof of his love is election no matter what we go through we will actually go through trials we'll go through struggles but it doesn't mean that he's not actually with us it doesn't mean that he's not caring for us amen he gives us the ability to go through these things remember the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are the bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval we could be having a a storm in our life everything could be upside down in our our lives in our homes but that doesn't mean God doesn't disapprove of us amen and we can have big fat bank accounts and everything cruising along just perfectly calculated in our lives and that doesn't mean that's God's approval either the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are the bright skies and still wat signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is in the Beloved his love is elective with he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his Spirit placing us as Sons just like we just read right at the end of the chapter and how shall I prove my love to him this is where it shows whether we're pleasing him or not based on what we just read at the end of the chapter by by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass my it's not always easy the Christian walk is not easy but he has given us overcoming power amen he has given us the ability to endure amen he says later on in the chapter you see one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it right we never want to negate the leadership of the Holy Ghost every step of the way we want the leadership of the Holy Ghost the only thing that's going to save us brothers and sisters it has to be the Holy Ghost leadership in our lives in our homes the minute the church moved toward form and ceremony and toward priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word that very moment death entered and she started to get get sick and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument she could produce nothing in the spirit for her hopes were built on program and not on faith in his word they swed program and they reaped program they SED provision so they reaped perverted children my he says you tamper with God and you reap exactly what you injected just incredible the some of these are just absolute nuggets here oh my brother Bram he talks about the truth is that the writing is on writing the truth is that it is writing the Finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of God is being ushered in wake up people of God wake up if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pulpit without a call from God they have styled themselves the Fishers of Men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 410 13 that God gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of the prophecy calling the gain sayings of Kora and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may God have pity on them may their eyes be opened before it is too late I had a brother send me a a text message this week and some others might have seen it of brother Danny steeman preaching we all know him he's from Florida if you don't know him he's a really good brother he friends with brother Ken and he was here he's preached a couple times here but he preached and I think it was a camp that he was preaching at and he said two boys in the front come on up here I want to show you something he said you might not get it now but you might get it in 10 years from now and he said you you're going to be signs and you you're going to be wonders and I want you to follow me everywhere I go and what did he do he started preaching he started talking about experience and he started talking about signs and wonders and how we don't need to try and Trump anything up because guess what they follow and he walked all over the place he got down he walked around the front and as he talked he said you know I don't have to try and and produce them I don't have to try and call them I don't have to try and do anything because everywhere I go they follow follow me and they did and he went around he made a big deal about it he made a point and these two little boys they would not let him go they followed him closely and at the back there was even a dark place that was kind of you know hidden or whatever a curtain or something but he even went in in there and he said even in the Dark Places signs and wonders follow even when there's no other light when there's nothing else around signs and wonders I'll actually send it out if you'd like I'll forward it just a wonderful thing brothers and sisters don't try and put experience out front of the word of God the children of Israel were instructed to get up and get ready and follow that Ark because when that Ark goes across we're going across but they were told to keep a very specific distance from that Ark just make sure that you can see it that's all you need to do amen don't make experience the way we actually judge things brother Bram says it I don't know if I have it as one of these nuggets here but he says away with experience as our Plum line we don't want experience to be whether God's with us or not we have his word if we have his word he's with us if we're willing to say be it unto me according to Thy word that you've given to a Vindicated Prophet I'm going to surrender myself to every single word that you gave him then you know you got him my H there's so much in here so good brother Romy talks about the Revol under the reward for overcoming I stand here on the authority of the word of God and deny that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns eternally he talks about this how there's no such thing as an eternal hell because it was created for the devil and his angels that's what the word of God says we know that just for time sake I'm trying to to gallop along here but if it had a beginning then it can't be Eternal is what brother brandham says and uh it's such a beautiful thing it's one of the things that we know the denominational world really challenged him on because it goes right against everything that they believe in that there is uh an eternal hell just like there's an eternal heaven and uh Christianity we know that's the Catholics believe that for sure that there is an eternal hell and uh it's it's a pretty big organization and uh we're just thankful that we have the Revelation for our day he says now then only sons of God have eternal life the kind that never had a beginning but always was that's right you have something in you right now that is eternal without beginning or end it is the spirit of God it is a part of God himself it is the life of God and that's why I think it's so beautiful when we can step back from ourselves and and our own stations our own positions in our lives our own shortcomings faults and failures and recognize that this flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God this flesh has to perish that's why every single human being here in this world outside of going in a Rapture has to go in the grave because the only thing that goes is the soul that's it it's not who we are it's not who we think we are it's not how we feel it's not an emotional experience it's got nothing to do with it it's all about his life inside of us and if we have the ability to get his life inside of us then you know what we are as Eternal as he is eternal not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus is beautiful you know he talks about the blood and this the blood test and how if you belong to God he's only going to look at the blood he's not looking at our brand he's not looking at what church you attended he's not looking at what family you came from he's not looking at even what you claim to believe he's looking to see if you have his life inside of you that's what's going to make the difference if we have the blood tag then we have all that we need need so many different things in here so beautiful so beautiful sorry if this seems broken up goes on to say every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches but only a spirit filled man can hear the Revelation for for that age none other can no sir they cannot because that exact is exactly what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2 6-16 now this ought to make you rejoice there is a most peculiar Doctrine in the air that's causing much misunderstanding and hard feelings for when the Pentecostals say You must speak in tongues or you haven't been baptized with the Holy Ghost they are either denying that great men like Knox Moody Taylor go forth and others did not receive the holy ghost or saying that they all secretly spoke in tongues and were not aware of what was going on now that is not true no sir that is gross error tongues are not the evidence of being Spirit-filled it is simply one of the nine manifestations mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 there is no scripture that says you receive the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues or that you receive the Holy Spirit by speaking in tongues it does say that after they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they spake with tongues and later on it says that they prophesied it's just so beautiful brother Bram talks about this here and you know what he says is speaking in tongues is actually ushering in the end of the age it's a pretty profound statement now when God is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken we had better speak too and say what he has already said he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth But the teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that's why we need the spirit we need the Holy Ghost in our lives that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin I just say we need to get the Holy Ghost otherwise we're looking at it as carnal men and that's what's going to happen to us it'll just be a matter of time but we will find ourselves out there in sin in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it I have that highlighted right there with arrows pointing at it they took it and they lived it it wasn't something that they just said oh that's nice I just believe that with all my heart but then put their own interpretation to it that's not the way it happens amen so beautiful so now so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the Bible has not said when the scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time amen that is exactly correct amen now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost is according to the word I think this is so important for us how brother brandham brings this stuff out and it's not all specific to this Myan Church age we know that he says it over and over again that this is to every single age he says now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is according to the word it's not according to me and it's not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the Lord or we are falsely led to begin with you notice that in my meetings when I have finished preaching an Evangelistic service or some teaching message I cast the net and invite a response from the people I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they are already born again so when I invite those who are Spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same such an important part now I realize that it's going to be confusing for a moment here but as most people know that I that I was ordained a Baptist preacher and I have steadfastly declared that the Baptists have missed it for saying you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe for that is not so you receive him since you believe and he says Acts 2 Acts 19 verse verses 2-6 and he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Jesus Christ when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied the Bram says there it is Paul asked have you received since not when you believed and there's a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive Ephesians 1:13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in Ephesus according to Acts 19 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed not when ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise I just want to say have ye received the Holy Ghost because ye believe we don't need to make it uh a big thing I know that it's not a big thing amongst uh our ranks the people that are here but it's just important to recognize that the the the true New Birth is the one and the same thing we don't come and get saved and then we take steps because we're saved now we're going to take steps to come to the place where we one day get the baptism of the Holy Spirit if we're truly saved if we're truly adopted Sons and Daughters of God we get the Holy Spirit when we believe because we believe we don't have a progression to go down to try and receive the AP ISM of the Holy Spirit brother Bram he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they do not go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the Bible does not say that you receive when you believe it is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed the exact and literal translation is did ye having previously believed received the Holy Ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of penny cost and we know that brother Bram he goes on to say that it's just like the children stopping short of the promised land the promise was there they could taste the fruit they could see the evidence they heard the prophecy they knew that everything was lining up for them but they just didn't go all the way into the promised land we know that only two stayed with the word and that is the difference for us today just stay with the word if we can just stay with the word then we will truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because we believe and the only reason we can believe is because there's a seat inside of us that he placed there before the foundation of the world and when the word preached in season the pure word of God preached in season comes upon that seed what happens is there's a life that Springs forward and says be it unto me according to Thy word I just can't help but worship him and call him Abba Father excuse me I'm still trying to get over this I know the Lord has healed me he's given me the ability to get better and know him more and more as my own healer and I'm certainly thankful remember brothers and sisters you are the Eternal thoughts of God he thought about you before the foundation of the world he thought about you even before there was a speck of Stardust is what brother brandham says you know some of the uh most highlighted portion of this chapter is where we'll wind up tonight and it's kind of where we started according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the excuse me the elect of God are the predestination had forn of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season every one of us here is in the designated decreed season don't think for a second that we've missed out or that we're here just by accident you are here because you've come forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body how many have taken their place in the body tonight thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ I think this is real important here too brothers and sisters that's why I'm reading it because if we have this ability to be the seed if we can recognize the word and the seed Gene of God is pumping through our veins then we are now manifesting God in a many membered body amen that's what we're doing when we live our lives that's what we're doing when we gather together that's what we're doing when we go to work when we go to school we're not manifesting ourselves we're not working on our own brand and our own image I hope we're working on his image because the sooner we get fully In His Image or better yet his image fully in us the sooner we get out of here the sooner that we see this body change now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in his son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son so even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are soall amen we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed that is the the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken now he says hold that in mind carefully and uh I'll call the musicians now I'm just going to close we'll pick up the pergam and church age next Wednesday Lord willing or the next time in the Ephesian age and in this age and in every Age We contemplate we will see that this is true and in the the last age which is our age we find the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in the Great Tribulation if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now this is the prophet for this age the messenger saying this is my Earnest prayer for all of us that we may hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today let's just stand as we [Music] close gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us Lord we thank you Lord that we have been given the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church amen father tonight I just pray that Lord as we go forwards from here and contemplate the words that were spoken tonight and Lord as we read the words in this book and we consider your word and your life and our positions in your body that Lord father we would just begin to look at ourselves maybe in a little bit of a Different Light yes amen help us Lord Jesus to look at ourselves as the manifestation of your thoughts for this age Lord that we would look at one another and recognize that maybe that brother is weird maybe that sister is weird maybe we are different in our own ways but we are still the manifestation of your Eternal thoughts and we know that there's not one quirky nature about us that you were not aware of before the foundation of this world and you still chose to place your seed within the confines of that body Lord Jesus help us to look at one another and not see one another but to see you father as we go forwards tonight I pray that we would just consider these words that we would think about who we are and what we're really doing in this life father we know that the time is short we know that the stage is set for the tribulation to start and father the bride oh Lord Jesus your wife has found this word and heard the voice and she's making herself ready father if there's anything in our lives Lord that we can change that we need to do to make ourselves more ready father we pray that you would show us we pray that you would lead us and guide us father that Lord when that great day arrives that we would not find that there's any trouble in our lives anything to hinder us father from being able to take that Heavenly flight we love you and we thank you we just pray for those Lord who are sick tonight in their bodies that you would just touch them in the name of Jesus Christ amen father we know that the devil is roaming around as a roaring lion seeking whom he can devour but we know he has no teeth we know that's the Revelation that you gave us in this age and we thank you for it Lord and everyone who is sick tonight who serves you who is an eternal seed son and daughter of God oh Father tonight we just rebuke the devil together in the name of Jesus Christ for our brother and our sister Lord and we pray that you would raise us up and allow us to gather together again on Sunday if it Be Your Will Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands now For Your Glory as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen amen [Music] can we sing his strength is [Music] perfect remember we have a church
