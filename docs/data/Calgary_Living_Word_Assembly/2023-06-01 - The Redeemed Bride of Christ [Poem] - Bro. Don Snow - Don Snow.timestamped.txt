[0:02] bless you all
[0:04] it's just a little special or
[0:08] I'm not a singer so I was asking the
[0:10] Lord something I could do to encourage
[0:12] the body here
[0:15] so I've got about six poems written and
[0:18] about six more in the works so I'm just
[0:20] gonna trust the Lord and I'll read one
[0:22] tonight and
[0:23] we'll go from there
[0:25] I trust it's a blessing
[0:28] this poem is titled the redeemed bride
[0:30] of Christ
[0:33] in the end of days faithful Hearts did
[0:37] pray
[0:38] their voices raised High
[0:40] with much to say our father
[0:44] conveying their love
[0:47] with reverence they raised his name
[0:50] above
[0:51] hard sayings they loved and adored
[0:56] for it came by thus saith the Lord
[1:00] my heart's overwhelmed
[1:02] as they knew for sure
[1:05] in God's hands
[1:07] their souls were secure
[1:10] with glory on high
[1:12] his Saints didn't magnify
[1:16] their love for God a constant Supply
[1:21] light and darkness
[1:23] both in them dwelt
[1:26] God's nature the Holy Spirit did smelt
[1:30] [Music]
[1:32] with tears of joy they proclaimed with
[1:35] awe
[1:36] thy kingdom has come
[1:39] to Prevail overall
[1:43] their ranks and numbers he did thin
[1:47] when he came to his position within
[1:51] they arose to the challenge
[1:56] standard set for the balance
[2:00] in his will they always stayed
[2:03] through trials and storms their faith
[2:06] never swayed
[2:09] with trust and obedience they abide it
[2:12] through his Redemption they confidently
[2:15] confide it
[2:19] Overjoyed they testified with zeal
[2:23] prophecy spoken
[2:26] then fulfilled to reveal
[2:29] their very being to God they gave
[2:32] by grace and mercy others they did safe
[2:38] the great tempter vanquished evil
[2:41] overcome
[2:42] by God's design
[2:44] their faith Was Won
[2:48] for in him their power and their Glory
[2:51] they attested
[2:53] a connection above
[2:55] their hearts fully invested
[2:59] with heavy hearts their prayer they did
[3:02] end
[3:03] with amen
[3:06] and the hearts of their loved ones to
[3:08] God they did Bend
[3:10] Lord bless you all
