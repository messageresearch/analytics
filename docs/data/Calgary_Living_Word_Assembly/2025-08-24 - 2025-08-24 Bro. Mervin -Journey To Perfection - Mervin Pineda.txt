That is why we praise you, Lord, and we worship you. We see the work you've already done, Father. And we just ask and surrender all to you today, Father, to just one more step forward, Lord, in you and your word that we can stand in full confidence and knowing that we truly are your sons and daughters, Father. &gt;&gt; That is what it's all about, Father.

Just want to welcome all visitors. &gt;&gt; Brother Kevin, Sister Elizabeth Hanu from Edmonton, end time message, the vernacle. Amen. There. Oh, uh from brother Jerry.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just here uh standing as a spare tire for our pastor. He's in Weldon. He he sent his uh greetings from Weldon. He took the uh the service yesterday and today also he's preaching and he he told me to to greet the saints from the saints of Weldon. Amen. And uh we're glad uh we can be in uh uh of of his service here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm kind of nervous. You know how it goes uh when someone or to be here is not easy. &gt;&gt; But if the Lord will uh take over then all these nerves will will be settled. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful unto the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let's go with the first slide, brother. Uh while you're standing, uh second Peter 1 chapter uh chapter 5 to8. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, &gt;&gt; and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. For if these things be in you and abound, they make you. You see, we don't stop at seven, right? &gt;&gt; There's always an eight. &gt;&gt; For if these things be in you, but uh there's no ifs, no ends, no buts, right? Once once you have it, you will have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren &gt;&gt; or unfruitful. It means we will reproduce. Amen. We will produce &gt;&gt; in the knowledge which is the union &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts this morning. Oh Lord Jesus, we are so thankful unto you that we can gather here Lord in this last hour Lord to still preach your word in fullness. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord we know time will come they won't even allow these churches Lord to be opened. But we are so glad Lord that we can &gt;&gt; we can still do it because we're still in the process. &gt;&gt; We are still in our journey Lord towards perfection. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful unto you Lord that uh we have this opportunity now. May you bless the reading of the word. May you bless the the whole service in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. I'll just check this thing if it works. Oh, looks like it's not working. Yeah. Uh, bear with me here. I'll just I hope it will work. There you go. Anyway, yeah. So, the next uh slide, journey to perfection. I'll just say next slide, brother. So I have a big topic this morning. I hope it's okay with you. It's been a while since I preached. So three months, four months maybe. But I want to to bring the message of the hour in its fullness if we if we can with this one and a half hour or so. And uh bear with me. Uh there are lots of scriptures, lots of notes. But then the thing is at the end of the day or at the end of our journey we will reach our destination &gt;&gt; and that is perfection &gt;&gt; and that's the thing that our Lord Jesus Christ wanted us to achieve. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh but it's not easy to achieve those &gt;&gt; uh the the the basically the stature of a perfect man. You won't be able to achieve that by your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a guide. Amen. And uh I I have yeah 35 slides but then I have maybe uh 30 pages of notes but uh but &gt;&gt; I know this cannot be taken in one go but uh we'll try. We'll just summarize so that at least we know where we're standing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next page brother. So the stature of a perfect man. This is always very popular preaching for for for the believers. Amen. Uh and uh it's a good uh foundation so that uh so that we can see how we can attain the stature of a perfect man. Yes. &gt;&gt; But the thing there is we can uh it's not it's not that we don't have all these virtues these virtues that are mentioned in in second Peter but they are already there in us. They already placed in us. The only thing that uh they are what is required of us is to manifest them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how can they be manifested? Through trials and sufferings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because uh we know maturity being perfect means being matured, &gt;&gt; right? And uh let let's go to the process. It's a process. Amen. But the thing here is it's a process. But we know we are already sealed until the day of our redemption. And we have that seed already. Amen. So the stature of a perfect man, you can see uh they are all blank. And let's start with them. Amen. The first virtue next slide brother. So you you see before it's blank but then through the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; through the guide himself we will be able to attain that perfection. It's hand in hand. We must be ready to be led so that we can attain all those. We cannot do it ourselves. Amen. So it's through the Holy Spirit which is the guide that will help us attain such stature. Amen. The first one brother faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And without faith it is impossible to to please God. Amen. So this is the foundation of of of &gt;&gt; uh of the building basically of us. We cannot have faith if we don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So it's that's why the seals brother Brandham is saying it's either you're going or uh coming. It's the same thing, &gt;&gt; right? Because we are sealed until the day of our redemption. All the trials, even Abraham, Amen. when he was tested, he was not he was he was not tested to prove that he has faith. It's just to manifest that he has the faith that is placed in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should remember that because there is always a question for us. Do I have the Holy Ghost? Do I have the Holy Ghost? Because the thing is when we go to the the stature of a perfect man, all these virtues, when we go to temperance, we cannot even bridle our tongue and then we will say, "Oh, do I have the Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; Yes. So this thing is to to solidify our belief our our uh our stature that we have all those virtues placed in us. We have all the potential inside us because we are a seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the first foundation. So the first thing you have to lay down is faith because without faith it is impossible to please God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is the base of the pyramid. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So faith is the base of the pyramid. It is trusting God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Above sense knowledge. &gt;&gt; So you see faith is something that we don't see. But it's a substance. It means it's a it's an it's it exists. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A a good illustration for this day is uh a GPS. A GPS will not work for us if we will not blindly follow it. Although of course if we're going to a place where we know then we don't need the GPS. We might put it so that you will know what time we will arrive. &gt;&gt; But then the thing is the GPS will give you some detour or whatever right. So you have to trust the GPS blindly so that it will work. Although sometimes we are hardheaded that we will oh this is faster but then when you go there it's &gt;&gt; the end of the road right &gt;&gt; so that is faith we believe in something that we don't see blindly &gt;&gt; because it's the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh next one brother. Next is virtue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh I hope you you can read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Add to your faith virtue meaning adding. &gt;&gt; It's a ladder. All we know that it's a progression. Amen. And that is strength. &gt;&gt; And that is courage. Amen. We the bride, the church must have virtue to stand. Amen. And in Philippians 4:8, if there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think of these things. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is if I will I'll put an example for for virtue is just like the moral fiber of a steel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That allows a bridge to hold. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has the inner strength. We have the inner strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's virtue. Amen. Oh, God is so good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then knowledge. Barbana in his message. I got the inspiration for uh for the uh you know it stature of a perfect man and the guide. They go hand in hand. &gt;&gt; They're not separate things because you cannot attain this virtues like I've said without the Holy Ghost. And you cannot be led if you don't have these virtues. &gt;&gt; So they are both Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we know the purpose is to attain maturity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Hosea 4:6, my Oh, sorry. Uh we're still in uh Oh, we're we're already in knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the third virtue is knowledge. Amen. After virtue, you add to your virtue? Knowledge. What knowledge? Baram is saying not worldly knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the knowledge of the word, &gt;&gt; the knowledge of his will. When we have that knowledge, we know we will have wisdom. Uh there there's always a question, what's the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is what you know. Amen. But wisdom is the ability to apply what you know. A good example for that is uh having tools. You might have all the tools. Amen. All all those builders here uh or DIYers like me, we have all the tools. But if you don't know how to to use the tools and when to use them, then you don't have wisdom. That's why wisdom, how to how to have wisdom, right? Uh uh the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Meaning the fear is reverence, reverence to his word. Amen. Reverence uh to God. Amen. So in Hosea 4:6 actually I so it says here my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. We don't want to be destroyed brothers and sisters. That's why we need to feed on the word. We must have knowledge of the word. Amen. Not not we we know worldly knowledge is so good especially in this day and age just one click chat GPT all the AI tools right. It's so easy to to to check and and and fact check everything but not everything that is uh portray or or or being searched there are are the truth. So how would we know it's the truth? Go back to the word. &gt;&gt; When I accepted this message I uh because I was in Qatar in in uh in a Muslim country and then I have to move to Malaysia and then there's no church there. the the thing that was or or the the advice that uh was given to me is until now I still keep it. If you have some doubts because you don't have anyone to ask, just go back to the source which is the Bible and the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Right? You might have someone that you have uh confidence with. No problem. But then the thing make sure that that person is giving you advice according to the word, &gt;&gt; according to the knowledge of the word. Because the thing is we're all humans. Amen. That's why we are given this message of the hour in this little phone here so that we can check whether what I'm saying is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the ministers are saying is true. Amen. Knowledge of the word. Amen. Amen. Are we okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; The next is temperance. Add temperance. Add to your knowledge temperance. So what is temperance? That's how to control your tongue. How to control your eating, your drinking, your passions. Amen. Isn't that important? We're all guilty. Temperance. That's why. But the thing there is we might not be able to bridle our tongue, but then the thing is it doesn't mean that you don't have temperance. It's just not manifesting yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't worry. We have the Holy Ghost since we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are sealed until the day of our redemption. Do so we don't need to worry. The purpose of the five-fold ministry is to perfect &gt;&gt; one one of the purposes, right? Is to perfect the saints. Perfection means to be matured. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that God, the Lord Jesus Christ can marry us. &gt;&gt; Because all these things, right? The message of the hour is about the book of redemption is about the marriage between the bride and the bridegroom. Amen. It's a marriage love affair. Amen. And uh we we have those topics. Amen. And uh I'm glad we are only 15 minutes here. Thank you, Bra Paul. You gave me a an early uh uh uh time here. More time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Proverbs 25:28. We know uh I'm just reminding you brothers and sisters, right? We we all know this. But then the thing is we need to be reminded. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we need to fill our cup &gt;&gt; until it becomes full, until it runs over. if we can right so that when we run over then we can share it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you cannot share something that you lack. &gt;&gt; We cannot share something that we don't have. That's why we keep feeding the the the that the 10 virgins. Five are they just have enough. So they cannot share it to the foolish virgins. But for us now we have overflowing uh oil which is the Holy Ghost which is the word. That's why we are commanded to prophesy again. Prophesy again means to to preach the gospel again because it was already preached before. That's our purpose, brothers and sisters. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Proverbs 25:28, he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down. Spirit means is like mind, right? The spirit of the mind, the mind of the spirit. Because the thing is they are inter interchangeable although they are different. Amen. There's a figure of speech I think chiasmos or whatever they call it or or parallel you can interchange them because even the bible used it the spirit of your mind and the mind of the spirit. So the mind we we need to control our mind. &gt;&gt; When we control our mind we will be able to control our tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So an an illustration for this is like brakes in a car. Amen. It prevents from disaster. Imagine driving without a break. &gt;&gt; Amen. So temperance keeps the believer from spiritual wrecks. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But uh we're humans. Amen. We have this tongue that is really unruly. Right? But then we we say something. But then the good thing with believers, you are quick to repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? That's the thing. We are quick to repent, to ask forgiveness. Amen. Because we don't, we didn't mean it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good. &gt;&gt; Next one. Patience. Patience with what? &gt;&gt; Patience with God's promises. &gt;&gt; Waiting for it, not moved, but waiting until it is fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Waiting for God's promises. We're waiting for God's promises. But then the thing is, how can we uh attain those promises? We must be aligned with the word. We were we were fellowshipping with brother Don and uh it's so good when for example there's a rain. If you want to be poured out with uh poured on on that rain, you have to move where the rain is because the you know if in Calgary it's not raining and in Erdri it is raining, you have to go to Erdri. &gt;&gt; Right? So that the rain will pour on you. &gt;&gt; It means you have to be aligned so that the promises you will receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it means being aligned means you you have to move. That's why we are in a journey. We're not at standstill here. The bride will not keep still &gt;&gt; for he has said the Lord. We need to move. We We are in a journey. There might be breaks. There might be stops, &gt;&gt; right? But we need to move after. &gt;&gt; And when you're in a journey, when we are in a journey, we have to prepare, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Especially if we don't know where to go. That's why the importance of a GPS, right? Which is faith, which is the Holy Spirit himself. It's a revelation. So, we need a guide, &gt;&gt; right? And that guide we know that guide which is the Holy Spirit he must be with you. &gt;&gt; He must be in us always together. Amen. It's not a it's not a guide that uh I know remotely now you can guide someone to do this and do that right but then the thing is the actual guide he's present and when you go for a tour for example the guide is always you have to hear the guide what he's saying otherwise you'll be lost. Amen. It's so important. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So James 1:3-4, the trying of your faith workketh patience. &gt;&gt; So you see all these trials, there's a purpose, &gt;&gt; right? It workketh patience. It means it's building it's building the stature. &gt;&gt; He's not building a wall. He's building a house. Amen. Where he can dwell in. Amen. So the a good illustration for this is a farmer who plant seeds a seed who plants a seed he he he needs to wait right he needs to water the seed &gt;&gt; and wait for it to grow you cannot just force someone oh I have to I have to uh uh water it more it will be drowned right it it will drown uh oh I I I will put artificial son. No, we need we need we need to wait until it grows. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so it's important. So that that is patience. Amen. Waiting for the harvest because uh that tree when you plant the seed, it will bear fruit. Amen. But in his own time, in his time. Amen. We cannot we cannot force it. Amen. And the important of planting a seed you know you have to put it under the soil right &gt;&gt; and that soil is you can say that's a dirty that's dirt right so we need dirt also to grow amen you see the dirt of the world is so that to prove that we are overcomers &gt;&gt; amen those dirt those dirt are required because the seed if it is just on the surface and it rains and it uh uh and the sun is there. It can be baked and it it will just die &gt;&gt; but then you have to cover it with the soil. &gt;&gt; So it means so that it can overcome. Amen. And uh and it's important sometimes we for for children we are we accept that oh they're young right so we have to wait and then just feed them cerillac or whatever whatever baby food right until they grow right and then uh so we we get that it's young it's it's it's an infant it's it's a child but then spiritually sometimes we don't have patience for our Brothers and sisters, why can't he get that? Why can't he get this revelation? You cannot impart something, right? Uh or you cannot force something when he's not yet ready. &gt;&gt; We have to patiently wait upon the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then godliness. What is godliness? Godliness means to be like God, reverent, walking in his character. Amen. So 1 Timothy 6:6, but godliness with contentment is great gain. Amen. So uh an an illustration for this is just like a child. I have a son, Miles. So the thing is he's my reflection, you can say, because he's uh he's part of me. Amen. And we are the same. We are sons and daughters. Amen. Of of of God. But then we need to be adopted. We need to be matured so that we can be adopted. It's just like uh for me assuming I have a good estate. If Miles is not ready, how can I let him inherit my estate without being trained? Right? So assuming I have a good estate, but I just claim it will be. Yeah. Amen. Same for you, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Although this will all perish by the way, &gt;&gt; right? Because that's not the real purpose. &gt;&gt; Although if God will prosper us here on earth, praise the Lord. Why not? Abraham was uh was rich, right? Uh Solomon was rich. &gt;&gt; But but then the thing is that's the that's not the main point. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our main point is perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The next one is brotherly kindness. Oh, this one is a good one actually. Brotherly kindness is to forgive your brother or sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when he has done you wrong. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; sometimes it's difficult because we're still in this flesh. &gt;&gt; But then the thing is, as we have said, we cannot do this by our own. We need the guide, the Holy Spirit, so that we can attain this. Amen. John 13:35 But this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if what? If you have love one to another. Amen. And that is brotherly kindness. Amen. Oh, we can. So after this you can see these are all the seven virtues you can say before the last one can come down which is love. Amen. The next slide, brother. And we need so the Holy Spirit like we like what we said. This is the body. This is the head, the capstone which is love, which is Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; He can only come down if we have already attained this. That means we are already matured and attained perfection. Amen. But it's difficult. But then the thing is with God everything is possible. It's not by our own might, our own understanding. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why you can see the next slide there. These are all the the mysteries we can we can see that uh through the me through the preaching of the message of the hour through a vindicated prophet. And now in the bride we we know that uh we have the seven church ages. We have the seven uh messengers. We come from the dark ages, rotten seed, stock, tassel, shock and to become matured seed. This is all process. Amen. And we we go through a process of justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. So that what we can leave the full word after, right? Which is what which is Jesus Christ himself. And we are living in the bride age. We know that we are we know this is out there. But then we are given this uh this message that we are the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have changed dispensation from being a denomination &gt;&gt; to a uh to a normal church, nominal church to a capital C church which is the bride and then later on we'll become wife and we will live together. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's a process. Amen. That's why I'm just showing all this and then at the end of this when he comes down the next slide brother you will see it's one whole pyramid. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's one whole thing. the head being Christ and us being the body. There's no more mortar in between because it's already part. There's a oneness, &gt;&gt; right, of God in the bride. And what's that purpose? So that we can go to Eden condition again, &gt;&gt; perfect &gt;&gt; eternity. Amen. So that's why we need to know when you can see we always say that there should not be anything between the body and the head. &gt;&gt; So it means the shape of this body must fit the shape of the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that there will be no uh leak you can say if you're &gt;&gt; in a in a rocket if there's leak. I think uh his uh uh uh brother uh Constantine here is in the aerospace or whatever. If there is a leak, it will not fly. It will just explode in midair. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why this whole thing so that it can fly which is which is the rapture that we're waiting. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We need to be shaped. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need pressure at the bottom so that we can go up. &gt;&gt; And those pressures will make us attain all these virtues. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't worry when there are trials and sufferings that we &gt;&gt; that we experience here. It means we are maturing. We are growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need the guide brothers and sisters to to attain this to attain this stature. Amen. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. So the guide in in in the message the guide by brother Braham the guide is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows the way. &gt;&gt; We don't. &gt;&gt; Amen. We might presume we know the way but then we will make mistakes if that's not the right road. &gt;&gt; So there's a chance 50/50 that it's correct. It's either right or wrong. Right. So but then the thing is if you take the wrong road, go back where you came from and then take the right road. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As simple as that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Amen. Romans 8:14. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, a blind man needs a guide dog, right? &gt;&gt; So, what the believer What does the believer need? We need to yield. A believer must need to yield to the spirit's leadership. That's the key. Yield. &gt;&gt; Surrender. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Because you cannot be led if you don't surrender. Right? That's why I think it's Brier Ken who preached you kick a dead man, he will not fight back. &gt;&gt; So we need to be dead to ourselves so that we can be led. Amen. &gt;&gt; So So why we need a guide? Because he knows the dangers, &gt;&gt; right? He knows the pitfalls. &gt;&gt; He knows the traps &gt;&gt; and we need to have a guide. Amen. So mountain climbers, you know, I think uh brother Bry uh shared a testimony here. We we we need we need a guide. Amen. So that we know where we we're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes uh when we think that we know that's that's the time we will be in danger. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So how the guide operates? So the guide always points to the word. &gt;&gt; He doesn't talk about himself. So the Holy Spirit will lead us always to the word. Amen. If it's not the word, then it's not a right guide. There are so many false guides. Amen. Especially in this message as well. Especially Especially outside of this message, right? Imagine even in this message, there are so many guides that are not uh that are false. Imagine outside of this message. By the way, the message for for simplicity is Christ in us, the hope of glory, &gt;&gt; right? And when Christ is in us, &gt;&gt; we can be led. &gt;&gt; Right. And we we will reach our destination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a warning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we will not uh uh follow the guide, right? And if we refuse to the guide and uh it's actually in Proverbs uh 124:28, if you turn him away, there will come a time when you're when you will call and he will not answer. So there's still a point of no return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Because the thing is if you are given a lot of chances and you still don't uh uh don't hed one one day, right? When you try to call, he will not answer. So yeah, but for us we know we we we must make a decision. Amen. That we need to once we make a decision, we need to follow the guide completely. Amen. That's in Proverbs 124 20 uh Proverbs 124-28. Uh the 28 I'll just read the 28. Then shall they call upon me but I will not answer. They shall seek me early but they shall not find me. So you see while he's there while he's uh uh uh con uh convicting you when you do something wrong follow him. It means he's still calling. He's still uh forgiving. Amen. But uh when when our hearts are already hardened and we don't even recognize that there is God, then that that's the trouble. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see the goal for this stature of a perfect man is to be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A character that is rapture ready. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So you can see just to uh to finalize this uh stature of a perfect man, I have a I have a a topic here of the pressing of Gethsemane. So the virtues of Christ, I think I I I preach about Gethsemane during I think two years ago regarding uh Easter because Gethsemane is an oil press. It means it's an oil press right uh and and the virtues of Christ are not something we try to create by our own effort right so these virtues we cannot create them right they already placed within us by the holy spirit as I've said earlier but just like fruit it must be pressed so that the juice can come come out &gt;&gt; right it it's the same as in Gethsemane the in in Gethsemane God or Jesus was pressed so that his uh life the the eternal life that he he will impart to us it will come out right that's that's the oil he wanted to to to come out from him from his trials and sufferings he he he said here uh uh the fruit must be pressed before the sweetness of the juice is tasted or olives must be crushed in the Gethsemane which is uh which means oil press. So must our lives go through trials to bring forth what God has already planted. So God is the one that plants &gt;&gt; right? But then you know uh we need to be tried and tested so that we can have it. And Paul said in uh Paul said in Romans 5:3 and4, "We glory in tribulation knowing that tribulation workketh patience." &gt;&gt; Amen. And patience experience and experience hope. So the pressing the pressing or the trials is not to prove whether we have patience or love or faith all all these virtues but to develop and manifest those virtues. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without pressure oil remains hidden within the olive &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; without trial the character of Christ remains hidden within us. So don't worry about trials and sufferings. It's a it's part of our journey. Amen. And even in Matthew 26:39-36 when uh when the Lord Jesus Christ uh entered Gethsemane under the weight of sorrow, sorrow and agony, the true oil of surrender was pressed out as he prayed. Not as I will, but as thou wilt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he fully surrendered. Amen. In that crushing, the life of perfect obedience and submission to the father shone forth. Amen. Oh, what a beautiful reality, brothers and sisters. Amen. So, but here is the key. We cannot walk through our Gethsemane in our own strength. &gt;&gt; Right? We can only manifest this virtues when we yield ourselves to the guide which is the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth comes, he will guide us in all truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without the guide, Amen. &gt;&gt; pressure breaks a man. &gt;&gt; So imagine because you're doing it by our own. &gt;&gt; But with the guide, pressure will refine a man. It's a it's a different perspective. That's why we are in the end time evangelism, brothers and sisters. It's honing time. We we are already shaped almost in his image. But we need to to check all those uh improper shapes. Amen. Uh improper characters. Amen. That's why we are being tried and tested so that the character of Jesus Christ himself will manifest in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's go to the to the preaching now, I guess. Next slide, brother. So the message of the hour it has a lot of mysteries that we call them history already because they are already revealed and uh when I searched the message and and checked I found around 90 but there are more right but then uh I don't think we can take them all but uh I I'll give a summary so that we so that we can explain or discuss why do we believe what we believe right why do we Why do we uh believe the message of the hour? Why do we believe that God sent a prophet, right? Because for us, it's the manifestation of the word through us, through the vindicated prophet and then now us. And we cannot even attain maturity and perfection without knowing all this, &gt;&gt; right? Although they already revealed, but then for for many because like I've said a while ago, we are in a journey. Some are already very close to the finish line, but some are just starting. But the journey brothers and sisters is a personal journey. &gt;&gt; We cannot carry someone's someone else's burden. The only thing we can do is if we stumble, we can we can uh encourage him. Stand up and move. We cannot just carry. We have the same destination brothers and sisters. We know some are already 40 50 years in the message. Some are already not yet in the message. Some are just start starting. But then the thing is we are in a journey. So it means we we must never underestimate the planting of seed of uh of of God in our heart so that it can grow. Amen. And that's why we need maturity and perfection and through the preaching of the word through the message of the hour with all these mysteries that are revealed then it will turn our hearts &gt;&gt; back to the faith of the original father. Amen. Next slide brother and then we can read Malachi 456. These are we know all this. Amen. Right. Most of us. &gt;&gt; But then the thing is uh it's just like we have so much flowers but then a minister will put it in a bouquet different from another minister. That's why we have different types of h different administrations of gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can give a three roses or or whatever or uh bra can give seven or whatever or 12 but they are all roses but then the thing is it's just like also cooking we have the same ingredients but the way you cook will will turn out to be a different taste &gt;&gt; and we need all those that's why the the reason we have the five-fold ministry is so that we can uh we can be perfected amen we can amen we can be edified amen strengthened end. Amen. In faith. Amen. So, behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers. So, you can see here this is not all brother Brham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll just scrutinize because sometimes we say 456 is all brother Branham. No, I we know Malachi 3 is John the Baptist but Malachi 4 is not all braham. Let's just Are we okay? Amen. We we we'll just uh break it down. I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the the Lord. &gt;&gt; The first coming of Jesus Christ who was his uh uh uh what what do you call it? Forerunner. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist. Is that great? &gt;&gt; But is it dreadful? &gt;&gt; Not yet. Right? So it means great and dreadful. So it means the great day of the Lord was forun by John the Baptist. But the dreadful day of the Lord also same Elijah which is Elijah's spirit because but John the Baptist is third coming of Elijah and fourth coming of Elijah is Branam which is the prophet of Malachi 4 and the revelations 10:7 he right he will be sent to to whom to you to us the bride &gt;&gt; only for the bride. Amen. Because the fifth coming of Elijah is for Revelations 11. That's for the Jews. Then it means we already out. So we must know that's why the I'm I'm I'm tackling the message of the hour in its fullness now. Although it can be taken by many ministers after because Yeah. Good thing we have we have more hour. Amen. So he sh So you see here, he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children. Again, that's John the Baptist. Amen. And the heart of the children to their fathers. That's braham. Turn the hearts of the children of this age back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. Pure word. Back to the pure word. Amen. Or else or lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next slide, brother. Revelations 10:7. So we're talking about the mysteries through the me through the prophetic ministry of our vindicated prophet and now it is being manifested to us and we are doing it prophesying again. We cannot just sit in our church and then say oh I I got all this revelation and then we I'll be here. I will I will just eat eat and then you don't share. &gt;&gt; What will happen to you if you eat eat and then you don't exercise? You don't uh you you don't go and uh go out and move. &gt;&gt; So it will not vertically growing, right? It will be horizontal growing, right? So when we feed, we need to share. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, right? So you see, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, which is brother Brham, &gt;&gt; the the seventh messenger of Laiia, the seventh church age, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. Amen. Oh, that one I I don't even need to explain because we know it. But we know that the the the the prophet of Malach Let let's just continue I guess. Yeah. Next slide, brother. So now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4. He will turn the hearts of the children to fathers. That's what we broken broken down, right? And then two, he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10. And what are those re uh uh thunders which are the revelations contained in the seven seals? &gt;&gt; It will be this divinely revealed mystery truths &gt;&gt; that literally literally &gt;&gt; not spiritually &gt;&gt; literally Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; Oh exactly. So he said, "Right." &gt;&gt; Oh, now we got the we're getting we're getting there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next slide is just a summary. I don't know if you want to tackle this today. And then there's another page. It will be 19 pages, right? 19 mysteries. They are just the main ones. So let's just tackle them little by little so that at least you can have and then go back and then you you will have your first love again. &gt;&gt; When you accepted this message, you're just like a lion, &gt;&gt; right? You want you don't want to work anymore because you know you're thinking, "Oh, God is coming tomorrow." &gt;&gt; Are we in that stage right now, brothers and sisters? I'm guilty. Uh I'm my wife would know. I'm guilty. Oh, because the the cares of this world sometimes we are sidetracked. But then he knew when I accepted the message, I didn't want to work. But I have to feed the young Miles and Lynn and and and her, right? So I have I have to go back to work. That's right. &gt;&gt; If we can only think, oh, God is coming tomorrow. I will not send my children to school. No. Brham is clear. Ho your potato even though it's coming tomorrow. Right. &gt;&gt; Plant your potatoes. Amen. Although he's coming in a 100 years. Who would know? &gt;&gt; There's still people coming. &gt;&gt; Do you think Mercy City is over? Impossible. He's still calling. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to preach this, &gt;&gt; right? We need to go back to our first love which is the word full. Amen. And and when when we accepted this message, all this mystery, oh wow, &gt;&gt; how can a seventh grade education uh person explain this? It's impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's without the Holy Spirit in him, without God in him, he will not be able to do that. &gt;&gt; Oh brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So you can see these mysteries we know they are history. Why? Why they are history? They are revealed already. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then the thing is we know what their applications are. That's why we preach them. Amen. It's not I will say, "Oh, this is a big one. This is a mystery. I was able to uh to decipher it, right? It it got busted and oh, I know what it means." No, it's already revealed to the prophet. And now when it's revealed to us, check the message. It's already revealed in him. He's just we're just prophesying again because he already prophesied even before, right? &gt;&gt; So the first one Christ is the mystery of God revealed. So this uh there are three verses here summarized only Colossians 1:26-27. Even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. Who are the saints? The bride. Amen. Who will become wife later on, right? To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. It's not for the Jews. It's the Gentiles. We know we have discussion about Gentiles and Jews. Gentiles means it's come uh it's a nation. Heen something like that. So, but then the thing is before the Jews came there's they are all nations because uh the being a Jew it means you're an Israelite, right? you you are a descendant of Judah basically uh that's the Jew basically but then the thing is right now in the context of New Testament right the Gentiles anyone that is not a Jew is a Gentile &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and we are Gentiles amen because we are hybrid &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; we got mixed &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; so to whom God would make known to whom to to whom that's the same to us Amen And what is to whom would make known what's the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is what Christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed and in Ephesians 3 3-6 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. Aren't you happy? &gt;&gt; Israel was blinded for in part for a season, right? &gt;&gt; So that the fullness of Gentiles can come. That's the main thing. And and and we're so glad that they were blinded. But doesn't mean they were lost. They are lost. No, they're not lost. It's just for the last predestinated seed to come in. How long would that because I know one of the mysteries here is the the 70 weeks of Daniel and he's not counting our dates because his time piece is the the Israelites. That's not our whole topic. But then the thing is I preach that the thing there is he doesn't count whether it will be one day or 10,000 years from now. He doesn't count that. He only counts the the number or or or the timing for the Jews. Yes, &gt;&gt; the Jews is God God's time piece. That's why we're still living in grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Old Testament, they're living in law. But now in the New Testament, when Jesus Christ came, we're living in grace. It's not even grace. It's double grace. Grace. Grace. That's why we must have grace, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; We must provoke unto love to everyone that we will meet. Our colleagues, our clients, our customers, our co co-workers, everyone that we will meet, right? We must manifest him so that they will see Christ in us. That's we are only we are the their only hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. We are the hope of this generation. Brothers and sisters. Oh, and 1 Timothy 3:16. I know there are so many. If I'll put this, it will be 100 pages. So, you can just write them if you want. And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in flesh, justified in the spirit. sin of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory. So that is the Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Bar Branham declared that the entire Bible was the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hidden in mystery but made known at the end time. &gt;&gt; What is a mystery? It's hidden truth but it it doesn't mean that it cannot be uh unfolded or revealed. &gt;&gt; It's just hidden for not for a for a season but in the end time it will be revealed and we are so thankful that it's revealed. Amen. And we know the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh brother Brandham was saying now God's great mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; He revealed himself in Christ and Christ revealed himself in you. That's the great mystery. The indwelling of Christ, the hope of glory. And then what? We will go back to Eden condition again. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the summary of the first mystery. Amen. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And the second one is the true water baptism. This is the formula. This is not even a mystery because when you check if you are an hermeneutic, you just tie the uh tie Matthew 28:19 and acts 2:38, they're talking the same thing. One is titles, one is name. &gt;&gt; Title and name are different. But then when you ask title is a father, son, holy ghost, right? But what is the name of God? &gt;&gt; Right? And it's a singular name. It's a compound name which is the Lord Jesus Christ. That's why we need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Not entitles. You can you can recite both. I baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit which is the lord Jesus Christ. That's the complete baptism. Amen. So we can see that we're following. And in Acts 19:1-5, if you are not baptized properly, right, when when Paul was at Corinth, he he saw believer uh maybe they uh they might be believers at that time, but he was asked, "Did you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe?" No, we haven't heard of any Holy Ghost. What What kind of baptism were were you baptized? I was baptized in the in John's baptism which is the uh and and he explained John baptized in the uh for repentance but but the real baptism in Acts 238 it's so that you can receive the Holy Ghost and then they got rebaptized right &gt;&gt; amen so the the the the the challenge for us if those who are not yet baptized doesn't matter how many times you'll get baptized &gt;&gt; but you must do it rightly do it the right way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And and that's the Acts 238 way. &gt;&gt; Which is repent &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the forgiveness or remission of sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; For the promise is unto you and to your children, &gt;&gt; to you, to us and to our children, even afar. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; As many as the Lord God shall call. So that's our ministry actually, prophetic ministry actually is to spread this gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in Acts 4:12, neither is here salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. There's only one name. Amen. His name is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So yeah, we know every person in the Bible that was ever baptized was baptized in the name &gt;&gt; is they are not baptized in any title. Amen. Are we are you with me brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; Then the third mystery is the seven churches. &gt;&gt; The seven church ages. We have a series of the seven church ages every Wednesday here. That's a mystery but got revealed. Amen. and Revelations 1:11 saying, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. And what thou seeest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia." That's Revelation 111 and 120. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and seven con the the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels angels messengers of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou soest are the seven churches. Amen. And Revelations 3:14, "And unto the angel of the church of the loudysians, right, these things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Barnam stated that the Ludician age was closing, the church ages were finished, and the bride was being called out. That's why we are we're in bride age. Amen. Although Ludicia we see out there, it's Laudisa, but we are on top of Lauda. We're seeing what's going on right now because we have the fullness of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the seven church ages and there's a book on that. So those who who haven't read it, it's a beautiful history also of the church ages you can see and uh there are lot there lots of mysteries that got uh revealed there like even the godhead and and so on and so forth. Amen. And the fourth one is the 70 weeks of Daniel. So se we can see here uh these are in Daniel 9:24 and 9:27 and as I mentioned a while ago this is tied to the blindness of the striates right so that we the Gentiles will come in and we're so thankful that's the grace amen and he was cut in the middle of the week when he was here brother when Jesus Christ was here he was baptized when he he was about 30 years old and he has about three and a half years of ministry. That's the half of the 70th week of Daniel, right? And then the dispensation went to the Gentiles and we are there until now &gt;&gt; until the last predestinated seed will come in and then it will go back to the striites to the Jews the last three and a half which is half of the 70th week. But we already gone at that time. We are already in the married supper we call it. I have a I have a diagram for that. So is that already revealed? &gt;&gt; Amen. And is it important? Amen. Because it it will solidify our uh it it it will have a good foundation. Amen. Mystery number five, the seven seals. Oh, I don't want to read this because this will be a one-year teaching, right? Barbberry will if we will read it here it will be lots right but then just a summary here revelations 5:1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals in revelations 5:1 it is sealed and 61 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so it means it's open right it was opened by the lamb because the seals is Christ right and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder one of the four beast saying, "Come and see." And then Revelations 8:1, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven &gt;&gt; for about the space of half an hour." Amen. But in the days of the voice, Revelations 10:7, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; How? As he had declared to his servants the prophets. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the mystery of the seven seals brother Brham mentioned it is is about the cloud of angel in February 28, 1963, right? uh he said he was caught up by pyramids of angels and he was caught up that's that's the formation of the of the cloud and that is being disproved but for us we don't even believe uh I mean for me personally I didn't even know the cloud before but then once uh it was uh revealed to me oh praise the lord that's uh &gt;&gt; that's the face of hoffman or face of Christ looking at earth on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we know that the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And for some, they're still not revealed because brother Brandham mentioned clearly it is the coming of the Lord. That's what it is. The end of the world, the time for the rapture. But then for us, if you go beyond the seven seal book, right, all the preaching, the mysteries that we're talking about, right? &gt;&gt; They are revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I have a diagram later on. So the mystery of the seven seals was revealed. He said this but the seven seal was left in silence for it is the great circuit secret. The great circuit circuit the great secret hope is coming because yeah I'll go with the next one. The rapture. So at least you you will see why why it is already revealed and uh we so remember the the revelation of Jesus uh of of brother Brandham is also progressive &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and we are also the same that's the reason why we are in a journey to perfection we are in a journey to maturity same for the prophet of this age he also went to that he thought the white horse rider is Christ but Then later on the the spirit revealed to him that it's antichrist all these things. So that's why when when we read the message read the whole thing &gt;&gt; right don't just isolate codes and then check that oh I I have something that will uh will back up what I believe. &gt;&gt; No check the whole thing and check whether it is according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the the warning to us so that we would know that we are in his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because his will is his word. Amen. is if everything that we do is according to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So mystery number six, the seven thunders and this is Revelations 10:3 to4 and cried with a live loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he cried one cry, when he cried one cry, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not. They are unwritten, right? They are not written because John was forbidden to to write and even even Daniel was forbidden to seal until the end. &gt;&gt; But then the thing is Revelations 10:7 has already occurred, right? But in the voice when his voice right when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished. So it means and he's already out of the picture. So are we going to wait for him to come back to open? No. He already opened everything so that we can continue. &gt;&gt; Right? The Christ in Branham is the Christ in us also. &gt;&gt; That's why that mystery, the Christ in us, the hope of glory, we're we're just continuing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Barryham identified the seven thunders as unwritten mysteries that would be revealed to whom? To the bride at the end time. &gt;&gt; Are we at the end time? &gt;&gt; We know I have a very long uh uh presentation on timeline. I will not uh let you endure that. But uh the thing is uh we know we are in 2025. We've been preaching this message since what &gt;&gt; maybe around n after braom right and then he even his his uh preaching are it's later than you think. &gt;&gt; We are in the end time. That's 1965. 60 years down the road we're still here. Why? Because God is still calling. &gt;&gt; God is still perfecting. He wants us to get matured. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those who are already gone, who believe this message, they are in glory. They're not dead. They're just waiting, sleeping. &gt;&gt; Imagine brothers and sisters uh uh those who after Jesus Christ, they are in the New Testament, right? But uh after before Jesus Christ uh or I mean after Jesus Christ passed away, all those old testament saints including the last one on the cross, they they went for rapture. But then after that, then it's in the New Testament, which is now, and we are part of that, and we are waiting for the fullness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those who died after Jesus Christ died, they're still in the grave. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're just waiting for the perfection. They're waiting for the per uh for for our perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that it will go to the to the Jews and then we'll be raptured. Oh, brothers. That's why all these mysteries are important to to discuss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will be revealed to the bride at the end time. &gt;&gt; These seven thunders and the seven thunders was the seven mysterious voices sealed up. They were revealed in the opening of the seals to the bride. It is not written in the book, but it is made known by revelation to the elected. That's why you can see, isn't it? you cannot add uh to the Bible or take away from the Bible. How come you're you're reading books of Braham that uh his voice, right? But then the thing is he's pointing us those are the unwritten &gt;&gt; word that will be spoken by a vindicated prophet so that it will be explained and made alive. &gt;&gt; Right? It will manifest through us. That's the reason why we believe a prophet. That's the reason why we be we believe what we believe. Right? So there is a supernatural element here. You cannot just explain everything by reason right we know we we we could be intelligent but then the thing is there's there will come a point that you will say oh this is supernatural you cannot explain it right &gt;&gt; what is required from us is just to believe it &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; the seven thunders then the rapture number seven imagine even the the the number sevenh okay completion &gt;&gt; or translation of the saints is in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-52. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So shall we ever be with the Lord. And then the 1 Corinthians 5:51-52. Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed. Changed, &gt;&gt; grow, mature to perfection. Amen. We need We need change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Changed for the good, right? Yeah. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the trump at the last trump. I hope he's the last trump. Right. He cannot he cannot uh yeah cannot be reelected anyway. He has already two terms. So yeah, he's the last trump for sure unless his child will for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible. &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's see this. So it is a mystery. He he spoke of the translation as a hidden mystery but it's now revealed to us &gt;&gt; so that we can be prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. The shout is the message right of to get the bride together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the shout. Amen. What's the voice is the resurrection of the dead. &gt;&gt; So what is left now? The trump. &gt;&gt; That's why it's a mystery because we don't know when exactly but we know it's coming. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it's hidden. It is the the exact date is hidden but it's coming. That's the trump is the call to the wedding supper. That's what we are waiting for. &gt;&gt; That's why it's still a mystery to others. And and and if you check this uh with the with the process of the rapture, right? It's a shout, it's a voice. And the trump the trump is the only one that we don't know. &gt;&gt; We know the contents of the trump. But then the thing is when exactly is he coming? &gt;&gt; We don't know because only the father knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord does all three when he descends. Amen. Oh, that's in the the rapture message. Amen. And then the uh the number eight, the token. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Exodus 12:13. And the blood. Exodus 12:13. Those who are taking notes. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt. Amen. That's that's the token. That's their Exodus. Amen. Uh Passover. Amen. And Ephesians 4:30. And grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption. So brother Brham he warned the bride to be sure that we are sealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost before judgment strikes. How do we know we are sealed? &gt;&gt; Yeah. How do we get into Christ? By one baptism. &gt;&gt; We are all baptized into one body, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, and and we know the formula. repent and be baptized and get the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and and continue feeding the word, right, for our day continuously. Amen. And until we become mature and perfected so that God can marry us &gt;&gt; can we can be in a wedding with him. Amen. The token today is what is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's not the chemistry of the blood, right? It's the life that is in that blood. Amen. The life that was in the blood has come back upon the believer when he died on the cross bloodshed but the life in that blood was released which is the holy spirit that will be placed in us. &gt;&gt; That's why he we need death. He needs to die so that the life in him will come out and then will be given to all of us. Amen. Without it without the token the wrath of God falls but with it you are safe in Christ. He's He's our hiding place, right? That Christ is our hiding place. Amen. Serpent seat. I need to hurry because I have more. The serpent seed. We know that that uh &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Genesis 3:15. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. And 2 Corinthians 11:3, but I fear less by any means as the serpent begelled if Eve through his satility saw your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham reminded us that uh sa Satan has always injected deception into the human race from the beginning. Right? Uh he injected deception. It's one word off. That's why the original sin is unbelief in the word of God and then they disobeyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not an apple. It was not an apricot even. Right? Those are natural fruits. It was an act between Eve and the serpent. &gt;&gt; I'm putting a summary only because these are big teachings and uh preaching. But uh at least we know that there are almost 20 major mysteries right that has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that act between Eve and the serpent brought forth Cain. He is the serpent seed. We just read it. There's an enmity between the two seeds. So it means the woman has seed, the serpent has seed. That's why the the mystery is the serpent seed. Amen. And that's why Jesus had to come through a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because yeah, in sin we are conceived, right? Out of lust, we are conceived. All of us, &gt;&gt; right? We we were not born immaculate immaculate conception. No, it's not that right. So we need there's there's a requirement for a union between a man and a woman. But then that's out of lust, right? So that's why Jesus came right by virgin birth without any union. It's all God himself who impregnated Mary. He's just an she's just an incubator. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of the serpent seed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So yeah. Oh, so the the seed, the original seed of Christ must not be a contaminated one because he's the perfect sacrifice. A sacrifice must be perfect, blameless. And we we are not that. No, no matter how good we are, how righteous we are, we are not qualified. Amen. Christianity is the only religion we were talking that is not merit-based, right? It is gracebased, right? It's not it's not based on works at all. Right? The rest are all, oh, do this, do that, you'll go, &gt;&gt; right? But for us, we need the grace of God. No matter how righteous we are, how how good we are when we serve. No, it's all by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then number 10, mystery of MelkiseDC. Who is this Melkisedc? It's a mystery, right? And we know, yeah, Mel Melisedc was God himself in a Theophony body. Not Jesus the man yet, but the logos form of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we being his children have a theophony waiting for us. So &gt;&gt; that's why when we go, we have a body waiting. Amen. That's our theophony. If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already prepared. Isn't that a good promise for us, brothers and sisters? Whether we live, whether we die, we are Christ. So why worry, &gt;&gt; right? I hope this will burn in us as uh as we go along the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mystery 11, marriage and divorce. A very difficult subject. We know. But then it's the word. Matthew 19:3-8. The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? And he answered and said unto them, Have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? That's Matthew 19, by the way. And said, for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. &gt;&gt; What therefore God had joined together, let not man put us under. They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and put her away? He said unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed or suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning, it was not. So, &gt;&gt; so you see, marriage is Yeah, I've been putting this in cards when I give cards, I think, to brother Logan and brother brother Tabiso. This is against the law of mathematics. E marriage &gt;&gt; in mathematics 1 plus 1 is &gt;&gt; in marriage is what? 1 plus 1 is &gt;&gt; one. So you see it defies mathematics. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery, right? So Brandham, he warned of the corruption of and immorality of &gt;&gt; Laudisia, &gt;&gt; the breakdown of homes and the falling away of churches. Imagine if I'm not mistaken, but I checked it. It's correct. In Canada, only in Quebec, when you get married, you're not allowed to take the husband's last name. You know that? &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't, but it's the truth. You can fact check it later, but I was I was told. I think it's Sister Ra uh Brother Francis and Sister Rachel, I guess. Yeah, they were the one who told us she cannot take the the the the husband's last name. They're already preparing for divorce because for them it's just a paper works, right? &gt;&gt; Imagine that. Oh, what a terrible time we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But regardless, even you take the your last uh your your husband's last name, they will allow you to to divorce anyway. So, what's the point? It's the same. But for them, it's less paperworks, less tax money, right? less less employees. They they make sense in in a way, but for us it doesn't make sense. Amen. So God's perfect will is one man and one woman united by God. &gt;&gt; But because of sin, he permitted divorce. Today by opening by the opening of the word, God gives us grace. Grace, he gives us grace to restore back to the original order. He wants us to go back to the original order. And the prophet which is brother Brandham must declare the truth though it hurt right and and for us we ministers some it's difficult but it's the truth it's it's not our word it's the word of the Lord and the word of the prophet right number 12. Okay at least we get to the next page. Yes sir. Oh it's so rich but I'm I'm just giving you a snippet of everything. But then the thing is it's just to encourage you when you go back. Oh brothers and sisters, there's so much here in this message, 1200 plus messages. And if you want to be perfected, just just spend time. I'm guilty. Who's not guilty? Amen. Do do we have some other things that we do? Of course. Right? We're humans. We cannot spiritualize everything. But then the thing is at the end of the day, what do we need to do? We need to know our calling. We need to know our ministry. A prophetic ministry. Not only for the five-fold ministry but also to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the prophetic ministry is not only for the ones behind this pulpit because barb Yeah. I have a lot of quotes here. He mentioned that the bride has a ministry in the in the last age and it's composed of this five-fold. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So if if it says bride, he didn't say only men, even women. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And and and and to live that life of the message is a ministry by itself. Living the life is the best sermon preached. &gt;&gt; We were talking me and my wife. Yeah. He was she was in uh just a a little bit of a minute or something for for her. She went to supertore and then she was in line and then the the person behind or before he her or after. But anyway, he asked her, "Can you pay for my groceries?" And then uh Then she checked. Oh, it's quite so many. But then maybe I'll ask why. And smiling, why? Why you didn't need me to pay? No, no, no. I was just joking. He said, "I just knew that you will pay for it." No. Wow. Your hour says a thing that you will do it. There's a goodness in you. Oh, I'm not putting her up, but it's a real story. So she it's just fresh. So I need to to put this message fresh, right? So so that it's it's alive. So the thing there is that's a ministry brothers and sisters to manifest Christ to live a life that they will see us that we are real Christians. &gt;&gt; And then yeah where do you go to church? And then when they ask oh it's in uh 11484. Where is that word? What is that? We're small church here. But then we believe the Lord Jesus Christ completely. Amen. We we preach the full word. Amen. In its fullness. Amen. It's the It's the Bible we preach. Amen. It's not any man man-made uh form of doctrine. Amen. We're so thankful. Amen. Where are we? Number 12. Okay. Restoration promise. This is very important. This is the fourth coming of Elijah the seventh angel of Leysian church aids. It's a resto restoration. Restore us where? Back to the faith of the original uh uh back to the faith of the original fathers. Right. Without any uh without any mixture of of doctrines. It's the pure word itself going back to the full word. Amen. That's the the very heart of brother Brandham's uh ministry, right? is to uh is to restore us. Amen. He didn't restore means bringing it back, right? Where it where uh from its original condition, right? He he was not the one who changed us. He just restored us. Amen. Oh, God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he promised Elijah, which is the prophet in these last days, to restore. Amen. Oh, the restoration is the bringing back of the faith once delivered to the saints. Amen. In Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is it is the Lord by through the prophet of this age. Amen. The seventh angel's message restores the bride back to the apostolic faith. Amen. Number 13. I need to hurry so that at least uh uh the kingdom of heaven in parables 13. So we we know this the parable of the seed, the swer. Amen. Uh we will not tackle them but these are all this. So Jesus Christ was uh speaking in parables others will not understand but some will right and for us we understand all those parables. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they are in Matthew 13. Amen. So the the the teaching there of bar Branom is uh the kingdom of God is within you within us right it's Christ in us the hope of glory that's the kingdom of God just to simplify that and these parables were hid from the wise and prudent are we wise and prudent &gt;&gt; I hope we we must be like babe so that we can &gt;&gt; we can accept it amen oh the wheat and the tears grow together until the harvest But the the end time the wheat is gathered into the gardener and the tears will be burnt. Right? And for us we claim that we are the wheat because God put the the seed in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And 14 Israel's blindness. We already talk about it. Right? So blindness in part is happened to Israel so that the fullness of the Gentiles will come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the mysterio of of Christ as the incarnate God and the Godhead. It's already discussed in the myster uh revealed in the Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Amen. And then uh the mystery of iniquity which is revealed in the seven seals. Who is this uh uh who is this antichrist is the horse rider, right? He warned that the antichrist spirit was already at work in the church systems. Imagine deceiving many. So the antichrist is in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not in the government because we know that that they are already evil but in the church. Imagine it's in the church itself. And we know that mystery of iniquity. Amen. And the mystery of Babylon and the mark of the beast. Oh, and and this one is the mother of our harlots. We know. That's why the call for us is come out of her, my people that ye be not partakers of her sins. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful for this message, brothers and sisters. We are &gt;&gt; everything is being unveiled, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we know what we're reading. That's why when when you read the the Bible, it's a new book because of the explanation, because of the revelation that was imparted to us by by Jesus Christ uh by by by the prophet by Jesus Christ through the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit himself. And the mystery of the new birth, we know that uh John 3:3, right? Uh Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." So you need to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus answered and in in re in John 3:5, Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water, which is typing baptism, and of the spirit, which is the Holy Spirit, he cannot even enter into the kingdom of God." That's the mystery of new birth, which is revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and me. It's not a it's not a uh what what do you call it? uh compound revelation or uh additive re revelation whatever you call it it's an individual revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh amen. And the other one is mystery of predestination. Right. We were saved &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the lamb was lain before the foundation of the world. Okay. Can we go with the next one brother if we have time? So you see here you cannot underestimate you might have seen this for sure right it's it's a tree that broke the rock and then just flew. So you see we cannot force someone to hear a message they are not ready to receive &gt;&gt; but there is a but right &gt;&gt; we must never underestimate the power of planting a seed. So anything that you plant today doesn't mean that it will spurt tomorrow. just wait, keep watering, right? Keep uh keep exposing it to the sun. Even in this case, it is even hidden under a rock, but still grew because it's a seed. &gt;&gt; So, if you're a seed, right, you will grow &gt;&gt; to maturity. You will be perfected. Amen. Oh, &gt;&gt; next slide, brother. Can you give me 15 minutes? Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. because I will go to to the heart of this the prophetic ministry of the bride in this last age &gt;&gt; right so you see revelations 10:1-7 is for Christ and the and and barbran but 8 to11 is for us we need to prophesy again we need to take and eat up the open book and we know John is a type of the bride amen so you see Here he said unto me, thou must prophesy again. Why again? Because it's already prophesied before. So now we're continuing, &gt;&gt; right? We we are continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the ministry of Braham which is uh uh the whole thing for us which is the message of the hour. We are preaching it. We are prophesying preaching it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And next slide brother. &gt;&gt; I'll just try. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And he being the groom, the bride has to come forth &gt;&gt; because it's part of him. And it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations. Any others has spoke of the bride. It can only manifest it. If it does something different from the groom, it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. &gt;&gt; We This is oneness. A man and a woman are one &gt;&gt; and woman taken from his side. She had taken a spirit, the feminine spirit from him, the flesh from his side. Made both mechanics which is the word and dynamics, the Holy Spirit, the wife. So we are the bride coming of Christ. We are part of the second coming of Christ. Although the second coming it's not a it's not a it's not an event. The second coming of Christ is a timeline and it's happening right now. That's why we are called to the rapture. We are in the rapture right now. We already stepped in and we are being perfected day in day out and as we feed on the word. Amen. We are both the mechanics which is the word and the holy spirit. And that is the wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The wife, the wife has made herself ready, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are bride is a newly wedded wife, &gt;&gt; but there's no consummation yet at the bride for uh yet. But then when he's presented after the consummation to the marriage supper later on, &gt;&gt; I have a Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a lot more. &gt;&gt; Okay. But that's you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the wife. Next slide, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, this is the one that I I was speaking about. Would the bride have a ministry before the rapture? And that is now, right? Sure. That's what's going on right now. Right now. And this is even in 1963. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ. Certainly, it is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; See the bride of Christ. Sure. She's consist of apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. That's right. That's the bride of Christ. So, it means it's not the five-fold ministry. We were only limited to the people behind the pullpit. No, everyone. It's the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the bride of Christ. Sure, she's got a ministry. Great ministry. The ministry of the hour. It will be so humble. Next slide, brother. And you see here, there's also a purpose. The one that we're talking about that when we feed on the word here, we'll just sit here and feed feed feed. No, we have to do what is required of us. Let's read it. What is required of us? The purpose. That's the purpose of the Holy Ghost. It's the Father again, God the Father dwelling in you, working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Working through you, making you a co-orker with him. I'll stop there. The reason why I put that that red is co-orker. He didn't say we are worker of him. We are co-workers of him. &gt;&gt; Right? We are all of the same level. We are co-workers. If you have a colleague, right? It means you're Amen. &gt;&gt; He's my colleague. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Although sometime of course we have boss, right? He's my boss for example. But if you say he's my colleague, then most likely he's not your boss. &gt;&gt; You're of the same level. So in this case is the same. He asked us to be a coworker, &gt;&gt; not his worker. &gt;&gt; Coworker. And what what do we need to do? Hunt for the lost souls as he did in the garden of Eden. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next, bro. And and and we know, yeah, it's also scriptural. You can see he that receive a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And what is his reward? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right? He he have eternal life. We will have eternal life too. But then it's not only stop at the prophet, he that receiveth a righteous man. &gt;&gt; Are you righteous? Are you justified? Amen. Sanctified, baptized with the Holy Ghost, and living the full word. We are trying to live the full word because we are in the process. We might not be perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're in that process. All those virtues will come out. Brothers and sisters, just keep feeding. Just keep pressing on. Amen. &gt;&gt; He that receiveth a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to page 21, brother. 21. Yeah, this one I know it it has been shown here. It's just to prove that the seals are open &gt;&gt; in a descriptive illustrative way because when you in the in the old days, right, the the scrolls are not like this books that you can do it. It it's like scrolls like this. So if you have a let's say seven seven scrolls, the first message is you you you write it front and back and then roll it then seal it, right? Then the next one 2 3 4 5 6 7 Just for the sake of illustration you can see here to go to number one right for those who haven't seen this. What will you do? &gt;&gt; You have to break seven first. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal and then the six. 5 4 3 2 1. So that and then they will be all opened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But then they're not revealed until you open them. Yes. &gt;&gt; So there's a there's a difference between opening and revealing, &gt;&gt; right? If you check because the you you see the the title of the seven seal, it's the revelation of the seventh seal. It it didn't say the opening of the seventh seal. It's the revelation because they are opened. They already opened by whom? &gt;&gt; Let's go with the next slide. Right. Uh they were opened. Uh let's go with a quote. We already read that, I guess. Let's go with a quote. There we go. Uh yeah. Uh okay. Page 25. Brother, I'm I'm skipping some because I promise 15 minutes. So is is it okay to break promise a little bit? &gt;&gt; Okay. It is the rising of the sun. He is the one who opened those seals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is those seals &gt;&gt; for the whole word of God is Christ &gt;&gt; and Christ is the seals that was opened. &gt;&gt; So what is the opening of the seals then? &gt;&gt; Revealing Christ. So is it revealed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it revealed? Is the book revealed? &gt;&gt; And he said he he he pointed this they took the picture. What what picture? The cloud. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So it means when he was there he was caught up and then he said go back to Jeffersonville go back east and preach the seven seals the opening of the seals right the revelation of the seven seals and that's why we don't need to worry right it is already revealed &gt;&gt; amen hallelujah let's go to marriage process brother page 28 we're just in page something okay marriage process next one so I I put a table a bit uh on the stages of marriage. So at least it can be there are seven. I just put seven. You can put more because you if you argue more then that's another stage maybe right. So yeah but anyway it's part of it though. So decision that's the first thing. What's the spiritual meaning of uh of decision? It's like repentance and justification. This is the lion anointing. I'll I'll just put my notes here. I I will sleep. I I'll I'll stop on this uh these are so good, brothers and sisters. And uh it's just got revealed freshly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This week uh about uh even the anointing lion and even the gospel Matthew. It it's it's it's it just jibes with the message. I know this might be the first time you have seen this and it's so it's so rich but I will I have to stop and oh &gt;&gt; brothers it's so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But before going to the revelation four which is the four anointings I'll just read it so we have a background. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So because we are in a marriage &gt;&gt; in a marriage journey. Our journey is like a marriage. The reason why we need to be perfected is so that Christ can marry us. &gt;&gt; We can be wedded to him. That's the whole thing of the of the message of the hour is just like Elisar's uh duty. So Isaac typing God wanted a bride for Isaac his son. So he commanded Elisar his servant which is the prophet to look for a bride. So same for poor Brier Brham he was tasked by God to look for a bride for him. He was tasked by Jesus Christ. So s but after finding the bride he has to decrease &gt;&gt; so that Christ can increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a redemption story. It's a love story. It's a marriage stage. It's a marriage process. So the four anointings so that at least there's a background here. The first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third is a face of a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And we are in the flying eagle anointing this uh these days brothers and sisters. Give me give me a few more minutes please. Okay. Lion anointing Matthew and that is type to making a decision. So why Matthew if you read the gospel of Matthew he presents Christ as the king. &gt;&gt; Yes. the lion of Judah. Amen. And this anointing is anointing of courage, &gt;&gt; boldness with the word. Ephesians, Ephesian church aids. Amen. Boldness. They were bold. They were like lion. Oh, this is wrong. Cut. Right. This is Oh, everything is cut. And we have that anointing too. Right. When we accepted the message, everything is bad. Everything that is not in line with the word, then we become legalistic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But it's a process. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have the boldness. We have the proclamation. So in marriage, it corresponds to the stage of decision. &gt;&gt; That is when the bride must boldly choose Christ. &gt;&gt; That's a decision. So for those who do didn't decide yet to accept Christ, there's still hope. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is in Joshua. So you can see the first one, decision. It's like repentance. Repent and be baptized. That's justification, right? The baptism first stage. Amen. Choose your day. Joshua 24:15. Choose you this day whom you will serve, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for me and my house, I will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's a decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the next one? It's engagement. The ox anointing. And it is Mark. So Mark the gospel it presents Christ as servant. Amen. The ox of sacrifice. So these are good ones. Uh if you don't agree that's okay. But uh Amen. Uh this is the anointing of patience. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Endurance. Martyrdom. &gt;&gt; It ties to engagement. Why engagement? It means when you get married you will die. Oh no, no it ties to it's consecration consecration faithfulness separation unto Christ. So you will be separated, right? When you're engaged, you cannot accept any more suitors or you cannot ask or woo somebody else's uh lady or some some somebody else, right? You are already engaged to be married. Amen. It's a separation unto Christ. You will leave everything for Christ. Amen. And scripture says 2 Corinthians 11:2, for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to a one husband that I may present you as a chase virgin to Christ. That's why we're called the bride of Christ. Because Paul, he tried to espouse us to him to Christ. Amen. That's why we're called the bride of Christ. Amen. And we this is the same as saying the body of Christ. Amen. Next page, brother. wedding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So these are stages that we we typically do, but uh maybe it's different in North America, but so I'm I'm talking about the Jewish way, right? Wedding is the it's the spiritual meaning is receiving the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the anointing there is face of a man and it's Luke. Luke is a doctor, right? Luke is a very intelligent man. &gt;&gt; And he presented Christ as son of man, full of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's Luke. Yeah. And this is the anointing of intelligence, reform, discernment. And it ties to the wedding and consummation. &gt;&gt; Amen. The wedding, receiving the Holy Ghost, face of a man. And also uh with Luke, you you can see later on is also uh uh part of it. You can see Ephesians 1:13. In whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. in whom also after that ye believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. Amen. And you can see that's uh the wedding and then we go with consummation your sealed life and adoption process which is the flying eagle &gt;&gt; and it's John and why why for for John is you can see in Romans 8:15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba father right you are adopted now fully of course uh wedding and then consummation you consummated the marriage, right? So, and then the next one I'm just hearing, we will go to the wedding supper, which is the rapture, which is the marriage of the married supper of the lamb. Amen. And it's a flying eagle anointing. We see the end from the beginning. It's not just an eagle, brothers and sisters. It's just it is flying eagle because an eagle on the ground is just like any other chicken. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. But then when he soarses high with the two wings, Old Testament and uh New Testament, Right? He can see the end from the beginning. His his his view, his point of view is so wide that he can see the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; And that's the anointing for this age, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Oh, flying eagle. And you are in the honeymoon stage at that time, &gt;&gt; right? Oh, flying eagle. This is also flying eagle anointing you can say. Yeah, this is three and a half years. And then after that, we go to the millennium. And Barbara Branham called it the honeymoon stage. and and and in Revelations 20 and4 you can see that that's uh when and I saw thrones and sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their heads and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years that's why millennium millennium is a thousand years amen &gt;&gt; I'll call the musician last slide I eternal living together. So after your honeymoon, the real thing will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you will live together for long, &gt;&gt; right? So, and then that's the new heaven and new earth which is the eighth day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's also a flying eagle which is also John. And in Revelations 21:20 uh 21 2-3 he saw John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God. This is the ultimate destination brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; We will go back from nothing to eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right? Because we are the predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; That will grow and mature to perfection. &gt;&gt; And how can you achieve that is by the heeding our prophetic ministry. Right? Our prophetic ministry is to look for the last predest dead seat. Of course, we need to mature first. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So that we can be wedded with Christ and then we can share this good news which is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Oh last light brother. Oh second to the last but the other one lesson. Revelations 19:7-9. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him who Christ for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready. Are are we ready? Are we getting ready? If we're not ready, that's okay. But are we getting ready? Are we in a journey? Are we going? Are we moving? Or are we always stopping and then eating in whatever? Right. We need to move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. Righteousness being justified. Being fully owned by him. We are owned by him. We don't own ourselves, brothers and sisters. Even our children, they we don't own them. We are all owned by God. Amen. And he said unto him, "Write, blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the lamb." We are blessed because that's the only thing we're waiting now is the body change. Married supper of the lamb, wedding supper. Amen. And we can be clothed. Next slide, brother. &gt;&gt; Like him, the word bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, we need to have a transition, &gt;&gt; right? We might be bride now but we cannot stay as only as bride. We need to be the wife. &gt;&gt; Right. And that is the we will be presented in the married supper as wife not bride anymore because we are ready. Amen. And we thank the Lord for for this uh message of the hour that just unfolded revealed all these mysteries. They might be oh forgive me for for this long service but uh &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope something struck you. your heart. Amen. And and just encourage you to to move forward because we're in a journey, brothers. We're in a journey to perfection. Oh, &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You see stature of a perfect man. He built He didn't build a wall. He built a house in his image, in his likeness. &gt;&gt; He built a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's you and me. The bride, the wife is the masterpiece of Christ. Oh, we thank the Lord. How can that happen by by by accident? No, it's predestination. All these mysteries if we understand them, &gt;&gt; we don't need to understand them. Actually, just believe them, right? &gt;&gt; And through the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; we have the source. Remember &gt;&gt; I I mentioned that this is an apple but it has a bite to put some attention right it means it came from the knowledge of good and evil although they don't claim that and I think even baren mentioned the first first Apple computer was priced 666.67 or 66 66.66 66 dollars. So all these things, serpent seed, &gt;&gt; all these things, mysteries, right? And knowledge of good and evil, there's good in it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We need to use of the good, not of the evil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, I want to encourage you that the that the the message that we accepted is Christ himself. It's not it's not legalistic uh law or whatever. It's grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, so good. I'm so thankful for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; For his uh revelation, for his uh unfolding. I hope you're blessed this morning. I &gt;&gt; Do you have a song, brother? We can sing before we [Music] [Music] Can you hear the sound of heaven like the sound of many waters? It's the sound of worship coming from the throne. [Music] There are cries of adoration as men from every nation lift their voice to make his glory known. Oh, [Music] singing holy, holy, holy are you Lord. [Music] [Applause] Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. [Music] The ely [Music] are you singing? Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Singing holy, holy, holy are you Lord. [Music] [Applause] There's [Music] our redee. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Isn't he holy? Isn't he wonderful? Just uh some notes. You see in a marriage, right? When a man buries a woman, he justifies her. Regardless of her past, that's already forgiven. That's already settled. And the woman that was given the ring will be his bride. Right? So it's the same thing and he will take or she will take the the the last name with with my wife she takes my name whatever I own she owns. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever she owns she owns right and also of course I own also but then the thing is in the world is different. They want separate uh bank accounts, right? But then the thing is for us justification means you have not done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you forget everything. I think uh we're in the season of bit of quite a few marriages, right? Uh brother Logan, Sister Ruth, uh Sister Rebecca, and the ones that will get married soon, right? The thing is when you choose you you you might uh you might have looked for different prospects if you're the man but then the thing is it's the one that you gave the ring &gt;&gt; that will be your bride &gt;&gt; it's not the others right so for us God gave us the ring &gt;&gt; right gave us the ring so that we can be united with him we know we're not in a marriage setting here but there are three rings Right? &gt;&gt; Engagement ring, wedding ring and longsuffering. Right? So we we need to know all those because we are living with Christ when we go with eternity. New heaven and new earth. That's longsuffering. And that's the truth in marriage. It's longsuffering between a wife and a and a husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? It's not only honeymoon. No, honeymoon stage is over. Right? We have to go back to the reality now &gt;&gt; that we need to work. Right? But the at the the at the last end though is we need to multiply or reproduce Jesus Christ. That's why being a bride the purpose of Christ having a bride is so that he can reproduce himself. And it must be the same material, &gt;&gt; right? Same material of God. If God is God, Jesus is God, then the bride must be also a little God &gt;&gt; because he cannot reproduce himself with another species. &gt;&gt; Right? A dog cannot mate with a cat. &gt;&gt; It must be God and God and then equals God. And that's the reason of our being injected, impregnated by the word of God. And this message of the hour, all these mysteries which are history now will make us perfect and mature. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another song, brother. Uh, how about the glorious church without spot or wrinkle? &gt;&gt; Amen to the summing brother longing up the streams of life. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
