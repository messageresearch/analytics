[0:06] an expiry
[0:08] date May God help us to say yes right on
[0:12] time um sometimes while driving to work

[0:19] inspired maybe listening to some music
[0:21] or listening to a sermon and I get to
[0:24] work and at times I'm able to carry that

[0:47] and God laid a song on my
[0:50] heart and um something told me we send a
[0:53] message to prop Paul I was like oh I'll
