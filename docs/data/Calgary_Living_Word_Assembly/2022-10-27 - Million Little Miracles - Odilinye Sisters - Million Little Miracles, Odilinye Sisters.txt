foreign this morning we stand here grateful I remember it's about three years now that I left the doctor's office with a spring in my step my feet set to dancing [Applause] because the doctor's reports had been invalidated and a lot of reports stand still today the song is my testimony I hope it blessed to see you [Music] I know my life have been carried by Grace don't ask me how because I can't explain [Music] I've got some blessings that I don't deserve I've got some scars but that's how you learn it's not inside of a miracle I'm here I think it over any dozen add up I know it comes from Obama I've got miracles and miracles A Million Little Miracles I got miracles on Miracles count your Miracles one two three four right I can count them all [Music] you help me stand it so I wouldn't give up you opened us that nobody could shot I hope I never get over what you've done I wanna leave with an open heart I wanna leave like I Know Who You Are I never get over what you've done it's not coincidence and it's not luck I know it comes from above cause I've got miracles and miracles A Million Little Miracles I've got miracles and miracles count your Miracles one two three four I can't even count them all cause I've got miracles and miracles A Million Little Miracles and I've got miracles and miracles count your Miracles one two three four I can't even count them all I couldn't even I can't even count them all you heal my body [Music] I can do that I can even count all the food on my table I can't even I can't even count them but I know that you believe say I've got miracles on miracles A Million Little Miracles oh I got miracles on Miracles count your Miracles one two three four I can't even count them all I've got miracles and miracles [Music]
