Michelle and after that we're going to call on some children they have a special song then brother Murphy will be after that is this on yeah I haven't given this test 3 for about 17 years it's about this viola I was 20 when I started the viola and I actually had never heard one or knew what it was and I decided I want to learn the viola because someone said it sounded lower than a violin so I thought okay that's better because the high pitch of the violin can get irritating sometimes for me so I got a student violin which was a smaller size and what I didn't know is when you get a violin a viola it should fit in your hand like that I've got narrow shoulders and short arms I was not built for riviola but nobody told me so the student viola was fine but as I progressed and I upgraded I ended up with this what my teacher called a truck it just I could not work it and she would say get you know just get this right get that right and I couldn't get it right and then she took my Viola and she tried to do it and she said no man you this isn't working this isn't right she couldn't even get it right on that thing she says you're gonna have to upgrade but um I don't know if you know but with instruments like this the older they are the better so I want I got the desire for an antique antiques are very expensive they're very hard to get a hold of and our budget wasn't that big but I prayed and my gift of music was dedicated to the Lord right from the beginning I had the opportunity to study at a college but they told me I'd have to play rock and Jazz and perform all different genres and I said no I'm not doing that because my gift is for the Lord alone so I trusted him and my dad took me we went and tried three different violas it was an hour's drive this way and hours drive that way over months and eventually I ended up in the Yellow Pages and those of you whom My Generation might remember the Yellow Pages it's a phone book where you have to look up numbers no internet no Google and um there was this music import export and I phoned this man his name was Laszlo and I said I'm looking for an antique viola and he says okay he'll keep an eye out and with and I'd prayed and that was like the last resort we'd even been to a violent maker but he was too expensive and um one day he phoned me it was just like within a week he said I've got a viola for you in antique and I was like wow so my mom and I we drove all the way to his house we got there and he took me into a stone basement the walls were this thick he had dim lighting and he brought out this Viola in a case and I'd prayed I said Lord when I play this instrument that's the right one I want an atmosphere I wanted to be a feeling I must know and when I played this the Acoustics everything was just wonderful and there was feeling it was expensive though and it's got cracks so I was nervous and I didn't know but I got the feeling so I said to my mom this is the one and so she had to go to the banks it was was before e-transfer quickly get to the bank before it closed with this man and um I took it to my first Viola lesson with it and my teachers took one look at it she said I don't know what that is but that's not a viola what is Laszlo sold you so of course I was horrified we spent all this money There's No Going Back and I prayed that night was Wednesday night we had prayer meeting and I just said I'm going to dedicate this instrument to the Lord and I know it's going to be okay and then the pastor forgot to dedicate it to the Lord at the beginning of the service and during the service I just thought well if he would just lay hands on it I know it will be okay cracks and all and at the end of the services I forgot to pray for your instrument won't you give it to me sister Michelle and I'll pray for your instrument and then I knew it's going to be okay but my dad's a German and nothing can be in any state of disrepair so we went to the violin maker to see about the cracks and the violin maker had a look at these cracks and he looked at the label inside the viola and he said he found exactly who had made it and it was made in 1900 it's one of a hundred instruments of its type it is not a viola it is actually a tenor violin and they made it with five strings you can actually see the one peg hole has been closed here and it's made to have the full strings of the viola plus the high string of the violin but they weren't very popular because they're not very loud so they discontinued them but I just want to show you this instrument it's perfect for me so the Lord preserved it through two world wars with cracks and all and I just see my life we've gone through battles we go through things cracks and all the Lord can still use us and make something beautiful so I'd like you to join me the song I played when I the first song I played was Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine indeed [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Applause] thank you so we have a special from the children so you can make your way up now as we sing the song we've got the power in the name of Jesus [Music] we've got the power [Music] foreign

land We Will Conquer in your name and Proclaim that Jesus Reigns [Music] [Music] take me to Land We Will Conquer in your name and Proclaim that Jesus Reigns [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause]
