[1:10:49] yeah
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:53] hey man you love the Lord this morning
[1:10:56] amen job 42 verse 1.
[1:10:59] the Bible says here
[1:11:02] then job answered the Lord
[1:11:04] and said
[1:11:06] I love his authority here I know he's
[1:11:08] not saying I guess I know that thou
[1:11:11] canest do everything and that no fault
[1:11:14] can be withholding from thee who is he
[1:11:17] that hideth counsel without knowledge
[1:11:19] who is he that hideth counsel without
[1:11:22] knowledge now listen therefore have I
[1:11:24] uttered that I understood not
[1:11:27] thanks to wonderful wonderful for me
[1:11:29] which I knew not I loved how brother
[1:11:32] Barry said that you just say Amen even
[1:11:34] if you don't understand it right
[1:11:36] job utter things that I understood not
[1:11:38] and I'll notice here in verse 4 here I
[1:11:40] beseech thee and I will speak and I will
[1:11:43] demand of thee declare thou unto me so
[1:11:46] here's a man job looking at God and
[1:11:49] saying declare yourself to me in verse 5
[1:11:52] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:11:56] the ear but now might I seethy I have
[1:12:01] heard of thee of the hearing of the year
[1:12:04] but now my eyes seetham said what was he
[1:12:08] seen in his word Vindicated amen he was
[1:12:12] seen in his word Vindicated now in the
[1:12:15] book of First John the first chapter uh
[1:12:17] very very familiar reading to you here
[1:12:20] first John chapter 1 and we want to look
[1:12:23] there in the first verse
[1:12:25] I've actually been studying pretty heavy
[1:12:28] on first John 1 and just a few things
[1:12:30] I'd like to bring to you this morning
[1:12:32] from that I think it's a powerful
[1:12:34] reading how John there is describing the
[1:12:37] person of Christ and he says in the
[1:12:39] first verse that which was from the
[1:12:41] beginning which we have heard which we
[1:12:44] have seen with our eyes which we have
[1:12:46] looked upon and our hands have handled
[1:12:49] of the word of life
[1:12:51] for the lives somebody say the life
[1:12:53] the life was manifested and we have seen
[1:12:57] it and bear witness and show unto you
[1:12:59] that eternal life which was with the
[1:13:02] father and was manifested unto us now
[1:13:05] that which we have seen and heard
[1:13:08] declare we unto you now watch in job 42
[1:13:12] he's telling God declare yourself to me
[1:13:14] and now in first John actually you're
[1:13:17] actually declaring back to God see I
[1:13:20] have seen heard and declared we unto you
[1:13:22] that ye Also may have fellowship with us
[1:13:25] and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:13:26] father and with his son Jesus Christ and
[1:13:29] these things right we unto you that your
[1:13:31] joy may be full now I love this verse
[1:13:34] this then is the message
[1:13:37] this then is the message which we have
[1:13:41] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:13:44] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[1:13:48] at all amen we ask the Lord this morning
[1:13:50] to add the blessing to the reading of
[1:13:52] his word as you can be seated here this
[1:13:54] after this morning rather from those
[1:13:56] passages of scripture
[1:13:58] for just a few moments I want to by the
[1:14:01] help of the Lord to speak to you here
[1:14:02] and on this thought I want to speak to
[1:14:04] you on hearing seeing and declaring the
[1:14:07] message hearing seeing and declaring the
[1:14:11] message you know I love there that word
[1:14:13] that John uses in verse 5 he says this
[1:14:16] then is the message and I I'll go on
[1:14:19] record this morning and say we believe
[1:14:20] the message amen this then is the
[1:14:24] message now that word message there
[1:14:25] means an announcement it is a promise it
[1:14:28] is the act of promising it is a promise
[1:14:31] given or to be given it's a promised
[1:14:34] good or blessing so in other words we
[1:14:36] could say this then is the promise this
[1:14:39] then is the blessing this then is the
[1:14:41] announcement amen that God is light now
[1:14:45] brother remember says here in recognize
[1:14:47] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[1:14:49] 1960 he said first Faith cometh by
[1:14:52] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[1:14:54] then the believer hears it recognizes it
[1:14:57] and acts on it believer hears it
[1:14:59] recognizes it and acts on it he said the
[1:15:03] carnal man will hear it the sound of it
[1:15:05] amen but never see hear means to
[1:15:07] understand it now look at it is looking
[1:15:10] at something amen but to see it is to
[1:15:12] understand it so you can look at
[1:15:14] something but if you don't see it you
[1:15:16] didn't really look at it amen or you
[1:15:18] didn't really see it because when you
[1:15:20] see it then you understand it see
[1:15:22] brother Brown said now he goes back to
[1:15:24] John 3 where Jesus said except a man be
[1:15:26] born again he cannot see or understand
[1:15:29] the kingdom of God remember they were
[1:15:31] looking for the kingdom of God they said
[1:15:33] oh where is the kingdom of God he said
[1:15:35] the kingdom of God is within man now
[1:15:38] again I have heard but now I see but
[1:15:40] remember said and the church has heard
[1:15:42] of God they have read of him and what he
[1:15:44] did and the promise he made amen but now
[1:15:47] we see him with our eyes amen we've
[1:15:50] heard of him we've read about him amen
[1:15:53] but now we see him with our eyes just
[1:15:55] the same as job did I have heard of thee
[1:15:59] amen but now I see thee we see him so in
[1:16:02] other words we could say now we
[1:16:04] understand him that's the beautiful
[1:16:06] thing about this message is we're not
[1:16:08] just hearing about God we're not just
[1:16:10] looking at God but we're actually
[1:16:12] understanding God see amen the Bible
[1:16:14] said amen that we would have eyes to see
[1:16:17] we would have ears to hear we would have
[1:16:19] a heart he meant to receive now in other
[1:16:21] words amen we're not just looking at him
[1:16:23] but we see him and we understand him I
[1:16:25] love what brother Brown says he said in
[1:16:27] the Paradox 65 he says now in the last
[1:16:30] days we are given the understanding by
[1:16:33] the word that we are going to understand
[1:16:35] it because it'll come and Ephesian to it
[1:16:38] so when we come to this time we're not
[1:16:41] coming back amen God bless you brother
[1:16:42] Matthew we're not coming back Amen to
[1:16:45] another Corinthians we're not coming
[1:16:47] back to another a Pentecostal age but
[1:16:49] we're actually coming into an
[1:16:51] understanding now amen I said like this
[1:16:53] I believe we have seen the message how
[1:16:55] many here can raise your hand and say
[1:16:57] we've seen the message amen I believe
[1:16:59] that we've heard the message we can
[1:17:00] agree we've heard it amen but I believe
[1:17:03] that time has come to declare the
[1:17:05] message amen amen not just to see it not
[1:17:07] just to look at it not just to hear it
[1:17:09] amen but the time has come to declare it
[1:17:12] now Isaiah 48 verse 6 it said that I was
[1:17:15] heard amen see all this and will not ye
[1:17:18] declare it so here he's asking you a
[1:17:20] question you've heard these things
[1:17:21] you're seeing these things amen then why
[1:17:24] will you not declare it see I have
[1:17:27] showed thee new things from this time
[1:17:29] even hidden things and thou didst not
[1:17:32] know them amen in first John 1 3 he said
[1:17:35] this which we have seen that word see
[1:17:38] means to see with the Mind amen this
[1:17:40] word gives prominence to the Discerning
[1:17:43] mind so amen we have discerned we have
[1:17:45] we have perceived amen and heard that
[1:17:48] word heard amen means not to be death it
[1:17:51] means to proceed by the ear amen what is
[1:17:53] announced in one's presence so then what
[1:17:56] is the message amen the message is the
[1:17:59] announcement amen so when the
[1:18:01] announcement is made if you hear it amen
[1:18:04] you will actually give your ear Amen to
[1:18:06] announce or to declare what is in your
[1:18:09] presence see amen that word here means
[1:18:11] to learn to give over your ear to a
[1:18:13] teaching amen or a teacher John said we
[1:18:16] have seen and we heard now listen this
[1:18:18] word and we declare unto you that word
[1:18:20] declare amen means to bring Tidings from
[1:18:23] a person it means to bring a word to
[1:18:25] report Amen to Proclaim to make known
[1:18:29] openly amen amen let me preach this
[1:18:31] morning to you amen you are not the
[1:18:34] people of a close book
[1:18:36] you are not a church a meant of a close
[1:18:38] book you're actually a people of an open
[1:18:41] book amen then what has been done has
[1:18:44] been opened amen and God did not open
[1:18:46] the word for us to fuss about it he did
[1:18:49] not open the word for us to argue about
[1:18:51] it amen but he opened the word amen so
[1:18:54] that the things that have been hid from
[1:18:56] the foundation of the world would be
[1:18:58] made known in this generation amen but
[1:19:01] here's the beautiful thing about it amen
[1:19:03] he waited till there were eyes to see it
[1:19:05] amen he waited till there were ears to
[1:19:08] hear it he waited till there was
[1:19:09] somebody on the earth that when they
[1:19:12] heard it and they seen it they would not
[1:19:14] look at it and walk away amen but they
[1:19:16] would give their ear to it they would
[1:19:18] give their life to it and they would
[1:19:20] begin to declare amen the thing that
[1:19:22] they have seen and the thing that they
[1:19:24] have heard amen then these things we
[1:19:26] write unto you amen that's your joy
[1:19:28] might be full amen this then is the
[1:19:32] message which we ever heard of him and
[1:19:34] declare unto you amen I 11 Acts 20 verse
[1:19:37] 27 Paul they're writing he said I have
[1:19:39] not shunned Amen to declare unto you all
[1:19:43] the counsel of God in job 42 he said
[1:19:46] declare unto me amen your counsel and
[1:19:49] Paul writes and says I have not shunned
[1:19:51] a mentor declare unto you the whole
[1:19:54] counsel of God now when you look at this
[1:19:56] word son I'm just laying a foundation if
[1:19:58] that's okay when you look at this word
[1:20:00] shunned it means to draw back it means
[1:20:03] to let down it means to lower it means
[1:20:05] to withdraw of a timid person Amen to
[1:20:08] withdraw oneself Amen to be timid to
[1:20:11] cover Amen to shirk amen of those who
[1:20:14] from Timothy amen hesitate to avow what
[1:20:17] they believe amen of those of Timothy
[1:20:20] amen hesitate to avow what they believe
[1:20:22] Amen to be unwilling to utter from Fear
[1:20:26] Amen to shrink from declaring Amen to
[1:20:29] conceal and to disassemble amen now
[1:20:31] listen Paul here is telling you amen
[1:20:34] when you see the counsel of God when you
[1:20:36] hear the counsel of God that's not the
[1:20:39] time to become afraid that's not the
[1:20:41] time to pull back amen and say well I
[1:20:43] don't know I'm not sure amen but that is
[1:20:46] the time Amen to declare what you have
[1:20:49] seen and what you've heard I'm just
[1:20:50] going to preach amen because I think
[1:20:52] it's time we start declaring this
[1:20:54] message we've declared enough negativity
[1:20:56] we've declared enough this that and the
[1:20:59] other amen I think it's time somebody
[1:21:01] amen declare this message as the
[1:21:03] absolute they've been declared as the
[1:21:06] God Amen declared as Rapture in faith
[1:21:08] listen Church there's nothing else worth
[1:21:11] talking about and then there's nothing
[1:21:13] else worth singing about there's nothing
[1:21:15] else worth preaching about this message
[1:21:17] is the word of God and it should be
[1:21:19] declared now when somebody's son
[1:21:21] something they're only doing it because
[1:21:23] of fear and you all know that brother
[1:21:25] Brandon said amen that fear is one of
[1:21:28] the greatest things that Satan amen has
[1:21:31] put on the church amen is the spirit of
[1:21:34] fear but I want to say this this morning
[1:21:36] I rebuke the spirit of fear amen I
[1:21:38] rebuke the spirit of fear amen I rebuke
[1:21:41] the spirit of Timothy I rebuke the
[1:21:43] spirit of cowardism Amen this is not the
[1:21:46] hour to be a coward with this message
[1:21:48] this is not the hour to be a fearful
[1:21:50] Christian this is the hour to be a
[1:21:52] perseverant believer this is the hour to
[1:21:55] be a determined believer this is the
[1:21:57] hour to persevere this is the hour to
[1:22:00] endure this is the hour to say what a
[1:22:02] prophet said regardless of what devil
[1:22:05] don't like it say it anyhow it's the
[1:22:07] hour to declare the counsel of God
[1:22:10] Amen brother Ben said someday I want to
[1:22:13] stand by him and him say Well done my
[1:22:15] good and faithful servant
[1:22:17] faithful you stood at the post of Duty
[1:22:19] you did not shirk it amen you told the
[1:22:22] truth amen regardless of what it took
[1:22:25] you told the truth he said and it's well
[1:22:27] done now I love this he said that's what
[1:22:29] I'm looking for not for a better car not
[1:22:32] for a better position I want him amen
[1:22:35] everyone says anything about you that
[1:22:38] doesn't matter I want him listen if
[1:22:40] you're going to declare this message
[1:22:41] amen sometimes you're going to have to
[1:22:43] do it in the face of criticism amen if
[1:22:46] you're going to declare what God has
[1:22:47] done in your generation sometimes you're
[1:22:49] going to have to walk through the Hall
[1:22:51] of critics Amen to declare what God has
[1:22:54] done in the age you're living in amen
[1:22:56] but I want to tell that therefore he
[1:22:58] don't have enough criticism Amen to
[1:23:01] cause this bride Amen to shun from

[1:23:52] brother I believe the message Man the
[1:23:54] message is the truth and you know what
[1:23:56] sometimes I wonder if they really

[1:24:12] Pulpit to declare it from actually you

[1:24:16] preacher the sermon you're preaching is
[1:24:19] your life see you might not have a
[1:24:21] microphone Amen to declare this message
[1:24:24] but you have a life and John said it's
[1:24:27] the same life that was manifested in the
[1:24:30] sun is now manifested in the bride amen
[1:24:33] and it's an absolute life come on Church

[1:24:40] Life of your father and your mother

[1:24:47] absolute life there's a there's an
[1:24:49] unlimited life amen there's a stability
[1:24:52] life amen there's a Vindicated life it's
[1:24:55] the life of Jesus Christ only inside of
[1:24:58] the believer amen when that life comes
[1:25:00] in amen it stirs something up on me

[1:25:09] somebody amen when you've seen something
[1:25:11] and you've heard something you got to go
[1:25:13] tell somebody now amen I can take you to
[1:25:15] the Bible it's John the first chapter
[1:25:17] when the Bible says that Philip amen
[1:25:20] come to Nathanael and he actually saw
[1:25:22] the manifestation of the Messiah sign
[1:25:24] the product God says it's beautiful he
[1:25:27] said when Nathanael he said he said
[1:25:29] Philip saw it he went to Nathaniel's
[1:25:31] house he said he wanted to tell him that
[1:25:33] what we're looking for has been found
[1:25:35] he's sitting out he went up there and he
[1:25:37] went to the door and knocked on the door
[1:25:39] and Nathaniel's wife said he's out in
[1:25:41] the garden praying he said that wasn't
[1:25:43] enough to stop Philip amen he ran
[1:25:45] through the garden and he found
[1:25:47] Nathanael praying he said he was a
[1:25:49] gentleman he said he waited till he
[1:25:51] finished praying he said then he looked

[1:26:30] this is hard to say but it's true amen
[1:26:32] that ministers many times Circle
[1:26:34] responsibility for standing for the true
[1:26:36] word of God when they're confronted with
[1:26:38] him amen they'll shirk that
[1:26:40] responsibility when the truth of the
[1:26:42] word of God is brought face to face with

[1:26:47] shirt back until the last resource Amen
[1:26:49] Let Me rebuke that devil in the name of
[1:26:52] Jesus Christ it is not the time Amen to
[1:26:55] back up it's the time to go forward it's
[1:26:58] not the time he meant to look to the
[1:27:00] left or to look to the right it's the
[1:27:02] time to pursue amen and take back
[1:27:05] everything that the devil has told from
[1:27:08] the church
[1:27:09] I know what I'm talking about amen go
[1:27:12] through a prayer line on Sunday morning
[1:27:13] and let and let let hands be laid on you
[1:27:16] and you believe that God healed you and
[1:27:18] wake up on Monday morning and the
[1:27:20] symptom is there you know what will
[1:27:21] happen a spirit of Timothy will set in
[1:27:24] and a fear amen not to a vow that you
[1:27:27] believe you are healed amen but when
[1:27:29] this symptom raises its head that's the
[1:27:31] time to testify hey come on church when
[1:27:34] the storm clouds gather that's not the
[1:27:36] time to tuck tell and run that's the
[1:27:39] time to stand there amen come on how you
[1:27:42] gonna whip that devil we overcome him by
[1:27:45] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:27:47] Our Testimony and Jesus Christ is seated
[1:27:50] at the right hand of God this morning
[1:27:53] and he is the high priest amen of our
[1:27:56] confession I rebuke that devil it says
[1:27:59] we ain't got a right to confess if
[1:28:01] anybody got a right to confess it's the
[1:28:04] Bride of Jesus Christ if anybody got a
[1:28:06] right to use their voice to declare what
[1:28:09] they seen and they've heard
[1:28:11] come on church I tell you what will
[1:28:13] happen you'll declare it long enough
[1:28:15] till your body will obey it
[1:28:17] come on Amen you will declare it long
[1:28:20] enough until your body will have to obey
[1:28:23] your confession somebody said well
[1:28:25] confessions line confessions not lying
[1:28:28] confession is confessing
[1:28:30] foreign
[1:28:32] now you know I'm telling you the truth
[1:28:34] sometimes you gotta whip that devil just
[1:28:37] by confessing the word of God
[1:28:39] because he can only go into action based
[1:28:42] upon your confession now I mean I love
[1:28:45] how program says this he said now I
[1:28:47] stand Here declaring the creator of the
[1:28:49] heavens and earth Jehovah God he said
[1:28:52] now I claim to be a representative of
[1:28:55] his in these last days to bring Faith to
[1:28:58] his church he meant he was standing
[1:29:00] there declaring himself as a
[1:29:03] representative amen of Jehovah God Amen
[1:29:07] and to bring a faith in the church now
[1:29:08] how many knows the Bible said that
[1:29:11] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:29:13] except first he revealed of his Secrets
[1:29:16] unto His prophets and I know a lot of
[1:29:19] guys got new can I preach amen I know
[1:29:22] guys get New Revelations and they amen
[1:29:24] you know they want you to they want you
[1:29:25] to join in with them amen but here's the
[1:29:27] problem if a prophet didn't declare it
[1:29:30] then I have nothing to stand upon to
[1:29:32] declare it amen but if a prophet
[1:29:34] declared it then I can stand in the face
[1:29:36] of every agnostic I can stand in the
[1:29:39] face of every intellectual I can stand
[1:29:41] in the face of every doubting spirit and
[1:29:44] declare thus saith the Lord because a
[1:29:46] prophet has said amen what God has
[1:29:49] revealed in the age I'm living come on
[1:29:51] friends I know people say well amen we
[1:29:54] need to prophesy amen we need to
[1:29:55] prophesy and I agree amen anybody here
[1:29:58] want to prophesy
[1:30:00] three of you amen anybody here want to
[1:30:02] prophesy it's not a trick question you
[1:30:05] want to prophesy amen what can I tell
[1:30:07] you something I know this is on the
[1:30:08] internet okay can I tell you something
[1:30:10] this morning I'm going to teach you how
[1:30:11] to prophesy
[1:30:13] are you ready brother Paul will teach
[1:30:15] you how to prophesy you say Oh Brother
[1:30:16] Andy you're going far out there how are
[1:30:18] you going to do that are you ready for
[1:30:19] it I want you to go home and I want you
[1:30:22] to listen to a tape and then I want you
[1:30:23] to go tell somebody what you heard
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:29] you say that's not prophesied yes it is
[1:30:32] because the Bible said that thou amen
[1:30:35] must prophesy again if you're
[1:30:37] prophesying again then you're not saying
[1:30:40] something new you're saying what's
[1:30:42] already been said and the Bible said in
[1:30:44] revelation 22 17 that the spirit and the
[1:30:47] bride say come and a prophet said in the
[1:30:50] last days he said the spirit the prophet
[1:30:52] and the bride will be all saying the
[1:30:55] same thing they will be declaring that
[1:30:57] God is not dead he is alive they will be
[1:31:01] declaring this a Rapture is upon the
[1:31:03] church because the spirit said it the
[1:31:06] prophet declared it the bride received
[1:31:08] it and now she is declaring the
[1:31:11] Vindicated word of her hour let me say
[1:31:13] this plane as I know how God's provided
[1:31:16] channel to declare his word Secrets is
[1:31:20] by Prophet now notice he wrote the Bible
[1:31:22] by his own chosen way and he chose the
[1:31:25] way his word came and that was by His
[1:31:28] prophets which were predestinated and
[1:31:31] for ordained being part of God's word
[1:31:34] amen declaring the Revelation are you
[1:31:38] hearing me so a prophet is declaring the
[1:31:41] revelation of his word to that age and
[1:31:43] that time now watch of indicated Prophet

[1:38:28] listen friends through this message you

[1:38:32] you can hug his neck through this
[1:38:35] message you can kiss his feet through
[1:38:37] this message you can feel every Divine
[1:38:39] virtue amen flowing through your body

[1:38:44] contact with the Living God and we know
[1:38:48] him
[1:38:51] we know him in the power of his
[1:38:55] resurrection then because we know him we
[1:38:58] can have fellowship with him
[1:39:00] oh you know if that Word Fellowship is
[1:39:03] that word Fellowship is exhibiting an
[1:39:06] embodiment and proof of Fellowship when
[1:39:09] you are fellowshipping with something
[1:39:10] you are you are an embodiment oh God you
[1:39:15] are the literal embodiment of what
[1:39:17] you're fellowshipping with I love what
[1:39:19] the prophet of God says many of you can
[1:39:21] fellowship with me on this thought when
[1:39:23] you as a little boy or a little girl you
[1:39:25] would walk around there would be certain
[1:39:27] things it would just well where it
[1:39:28] wouldn't bother other kids it seemed
[1:39:30] like there was something in you that
[1:39:32] cried out
[1:39:33] there was a god somewhere see yet you
[1:39:36] were a sinner you remember that amen now
[1:39:39] what was that that was that little form
[1:39:41] of life that was in you then
[1:39:44] I'm on Church you did not receive that
[1:39:47] Effie altar you did not receive that
[1:39:50] seed when you heard the first tape that
[1:39:53] seed was in you always
[1:39:56] come on that seed was in you always but
[1:40:00] until that seed was quickened you were
[1:40:02] you come on amen God was looking at you
[1:40:05] but you had your back to him amen you
[1:40:08] were fellowshipping with drugs you were
[1:40:09] fellowship with alcohol you were
[1:40:11] fellowshipping with the nomination you
[1:40:13] had your back to him but my Bible says
[1:40:16] to Romans 8 11 if the same spirit that
[1:40:19] raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:40:22] he shall Quicken your mortal body do you
[1:40:25] see what that quickening power is it was
[1:40:28] the quickening of the form of life on
[1:40:31] the inside of you oh God Brother Don and
[1:40:34] when that seed was quickened it
[1:40:36] literally turned you from having your
[1:40:38] back to God to face to face with God
[1:40:42] Hallelujah it turns you from having your
[1:40:44] back come on church he was trawling at
[1:40:47] you he was wooing at you he was talking
[1:40:49] to you but just like I was talking to
[1:40:51] Isaac when he had his back to me there
[1:40:54] was no Fellowship there was no
[1:40:55] communication but when he turned around
[1:40:57] and he looked at me face to face
[1:41:00] foreign
[1:41:01] I wish I was a preacher right now when
[1:41:04] he looked at me face to face he then
[1:41:06] began to have Fellowship come on church
[1:41:09] and you're looking at God through this
[1:41:11] message face to face he said then one
[1:41:13] day you being a part of God you had to
[1:41:15] be a part of the word and when you heard
[1:41:17] the word you knew where you come from
[1:41:19] you know that was the truth you were
[1:41:22] always the seed was in you always you
[1:41:26] want to declare war on that emotional
[1:41:28] devil go ahead and do it right now the
[1:41:31] seed was in you always
[1:41:35] so you know what I say Amen you know
[1:41:37] what I can say brother Paul on my best

[1:44:43] a homosexual and he was in a mental
[1:44:45] hospital and the man walked in the in
[1:44:48] the meeting the prophet of God discerned
[1:44:49] him he was delivered but he come in the

[1:45:05] free I'm free robesco said when brother
[1:45:08] bam got back he said Eddie he said what
[1:45:10] happened is that boy is involved in
[1:45:11] homosexuality and the devil was lying to
[1:45:14] him and he he was going to commit
[1:45:15] suicide he said but the minute that
[1:45:18] thing was exposed was the men that he
[1:45:20] was free
[1:45:22] foreign
[1:45:25] church I'm preaching to you this morning
[1:45:28] and the word still exposes the devil and
[1:45:31] the church age book said the devil hates
[1:45:34] to be exposed you know what you you know
[1:45:37] what you're doing right now amen some of
[1:45:39] y'all sitting here and the devil's
[1:45:41] already been exposed and he's telling
[1:45:43] you you're not going to get free but
[1:45:45] will you receive a declaration from a
[1:45:47] word Prophet when the devil is exposed
[1:45:50] he has lost brother Gilbert his power
[1:45:52] over your life and you're automatically
[1:45:56] free
[1:45:58] well you know what I say pornography is
[1:46:01] defeated adultery is defeated
[1:46:04] fornication is defeated drunken lying
[1:46:07] and cheating and stealing and narcotics
[1:46:10] prescription abuse is defeated in the
[1:46:13] name of Jesus Christ depression is
[1:46:16] defeated anxiety is defeated complexes
[1:46:19] is defeated your past is defeated and
[1:46:22] the Holy Ghost is here to declare unto
[1:46:25] you who the son has made free is free
[1:46:28] indeed Satan in the name of Jesus I
[1:46:31] adore thee by the power of the Living
[1:46:34] God come away from the people and let
[1:46:36] her faith recognize who they are and
[1:46:39] declare with a word
[1:46:43] somebody shout hallelujah somebody
[1:46:46] giving me some praise somebody give him
[1:46:49] some worship
[1:46:51] who the son I set free
[1:46:55] it's free you're free you're free
[1:47:05] I know why that devil didn't want us to
[1:47:06] me to say that because you know what he
[1:47:08] said he said I already got you
[1:47:12] what that devil says he says I already
[1:47:14] got you but you know what when I was in
[1:47:16] my immaturity he could Bluff me out by
[1:47:18] that
[1:47:20] but one day I heard a prophet say
[1:47:22] take your hands off Satan take your
[1:47:26] hands off
[1:47:27] God's Property
[1:47:29] sis you know what I never heard him say
[1:47:31] I never heard him say Satan take your
[1:47:34] hands off and let them become God's
[1:47:36] Property
[1:47:42] you always were
[1:47:45] sister Shelley you always were God's
[1:47:48] Property so you know what happened God
[1:47:50] sent a prophet to declare to the devil
[1:47:52] Who You Are
[1:47:55] and take your hands off my kids
[1:48:00] are you hearing me I know there's a lot
[1:48:02] of things trying to claim our young
[1:48:03] people but I want to tell that devil
[1:48:05] you're too late
[1:48:08] devil you're too late
[1:48:10] brother I remember when that devil used
[1:48:12] to tell me I'm gonna get you I'm gonna
[1:48:14] get you and I would get scared and I
[1:48:16] would chirp back a little bit and I
[1:48:17] would probably shine to declare what I
[1:48:19] should have declared and said maybe that
[1:48:21] Devil's going to get me but you know
[1:48:22] what brother Barry one day I got to
[1:48:24] thinking about that amen I give my heart
[1:48:26] to God when I was a nine-year-old boy
[1:48:28] was baptized to receive the holy ghost
[1:48:30] at 12 years old I've been preaching this
[1:48:33] message since I was 13 years old amen
[1:48:35] and the devil's told me over and over
[1:48:37] and over I'm gonna get you you know when
[1:48:39] I come to realization one day if that
[1:48:41] devil was going to get me he would have
[1:48:42] done got me
[1:48:46] well let me shout a little bit on that
[1:48:48] if that devil was going to get me he
[1:48:50] would have done got me but the reason he
[1:48:53] ain't got me is because he don't have
[1:48:54] the ability to get me
[1:48:58] the devil does not have the ability to
[1:49:01] claim your life he cannot claim your
[1:49:04] flesh he come on church he cannot claim
[1:49:07] your testimony the message of the hour
[1:49:10] has already claimed you
[1:49:12] [Applause]
[1:49:14] you didn't claim this message this
[1:49:17] message claimed you
[1:49:19] this then is the message this then is
[1:49:22] the announcement that God has given this
[1:49:25] age laodicea according to Malachi 4 a
[1:49:28] message and that message is a claiming
[1:49:32] message
[1:49:33] can I preach it to you
[1:49:35] brother Isaac you didn't claim the
[1:49:37] message
[1:49:38] the message claims you
[1:49:42] are you hearing me Church you did not
[1:49:44] claim this message this message claimed
[1:49:48] you
[1:49:50] do you know why it claims you for its
[1:49:54] fulfillment
[1:49:56] it's in your tape proving his word there
[1:49:58] is going to be a Rapture there is going
[1:50:00] to be a resurrection there is going to
[1:50:02] be a millennium there will be a new
[1:50:03] heavens and a new Earth and only the
[1:50:06] righteous will be there those who's been
[1:50:08] made a part of his word in the age
[1:50:10] they're living in listen friends God is
[1:50:13] going to fulfill first Thessalonians 4
[1:50:15] and he's not going to hold God he's not
[1:50:18] going to raise up Seven Ages to do it
[1:50:20] the Bible said some are going to go by
[1:50:22] the way of the grave but some are going
[1:50:24] to be alive and they're going to remain
[1:50:26] as the coming of the Lord and you which
[1:50:29] are alive and remain are the claimed
[1:50:31] property of almighty God to fulfill the
[1:50:36] translation through your flesh
[1:50:38] come on Enoch it's time to walk come on
[1:50:42] Enoch it's time to go home
[1:50:45] oh God Enoch Enoch didn't bet God to be
[1:50:49] a type God claimed he not to be a top
[1:50:52] that's a powerful point right there
[1:50:54] Enoch didn't pay his way into being a
[1:50:56] tie for the bride God claimed him
[1:50:59] it's all for your message God claimed
[1:51:01] him because in the end time in the end
[1:51:04] of seven watches the seven from Adam the
[1:51:07] seventh Church age will take the Rapture
[1:51:09] and there had to be a top to do it by so
[1:51:12] God claimed Enoch but a translation
[1:51:15] message
[1:51:17] uh what are you saying I'm saying the
[1:51:20] message we're following is a scriptural
[1:51:22] message Mercy brother brother bear you

[2:19:48] to pour the word in
[2:19:53] he said oh fools and slow a heart not to
[2:19:55] understand went back to the Old
[2:19:57] Testament and begin to prove how that
[2:19:59] Christ should suffer and raise the third
[2:20:01] day what was it it was the washing of
[2:20:04] the Water by the word

[2:25:50] ain't nobody saying it
[2:25:54] you know all this trash is getting in
[2:25:56] the church it's because people quit
[2:25:58] saying what a prophet said
[2:26:01] you know why marriages are falling apart
[2:26:03] it's because we brought psychology in
[2:26:04] the house of God trying to fix marriages
[2:26:07] and quit saying what a prophet's saying
[2:26:09] listen I I'm not here to be a politician

[2:38:01] and pure Prophet as I read last night he
[2:38:04] said like a surgeon's knife and that
[2:38:06] naked truth

[2:38:16] and miss our ride we don't want to stand
[2:38:19] there on that day and

[2:38:57] father we're living in an age where
[2:38:59] people are adventuring out and well we
[2:39:01] got the message but we need a little Dr
[2:39:03] Dobson or a little Spurgeon or a little

[2:39:07] God
[2:39:08] help us Lord

[2:39:12] Lord she didn't come under influence of
[2:39:14] multiple messages she coming in first of
[2:39:16] one message Lord and that was the
[2:39:19] message of elieza

[2:39:41] stand the influence of the voice of the
[2:39:42] seventh angel everything he says to us

[2:39:48] when we behold you
[2:39:51] Glory
[2:39:52] Hallelujah
[2:39:55] some morning when we behold you
[2:39:58] it'll be to the exact detail
[2:40:01] of what we've heard
[2:40:03] Lord when we walk in that future home
[2:40:05] Hallelujah and we sit down there
[2:40:09] Lord your Prophet didn't want us to show
[2:40:10] up uninformed you didn't want us to
[2:40:14] so Lord you sent this seventh angel to
[2:40:16] declare to us
[2:40:18] that we'll walk in there and there'll be
[2:40:19] a table a thousand miles long Hallelujah
[2:40:23] but we won't go in there and say I
[2:40:26] wonder where I'll sit no there's a spot
[2:40:28] at the table with our name on it Glory
[2:40:31] there's a spot at the table with our
[2:40:34] name on it
[2:40:35] he said in those battles scarred
[2:40:37] veterans will sit down
[2:40:39] and Lord will look around the table and
[2:40:40] say oh there's brother so and so he made
[2:40:43] it their sister so and so and Lord your
[2:40:46] Prophet said all of a sudden there'll be
[2:40:48] such a presence come over us that a
[2:40:50] little tear will begin to tickle out of
[2:40:52] her eye begin to trickle down her cheek
[2:40:54] he said then all of a sudden you'll step
[2:40:56] out Glory
[2:40:58] you'll step out and you'll walk over and
[2:41:00] you'll take your garment and you'll wipe
[2:41:02] that tear from our eye and say my little
[2:41:05] child don't cry no more it's all over

[2:47:55] some things happened here today
[2:47:59] we haven't heard from a man
[2:48:02] if you've heard from a man today then
[2:48:04] you've missed the entire point
[2:48:08] but I believe we've heard from heaven
[2:48:09] today
[2:48:12] we have heard exactly what we heard
[2:48:14] preached is exactly what the prophet
[2:48:17] said
[2:48:18] there's only one thing that's going to
[2:48:19] make it to the other side when he came
[2:48:21] back from Beyond the curtain of time and
[2:48:23] that's Divine love that's perfect love
[2:48:26] and the only way we're going to have
[2:48:28] that is to stay straight on that word
[2:48:32] the word is the only thing that's going
[2:48:34] to do it for us brothers and sisters
[2:48:37] you know sometimes we have to get a
[2:48:39] spanking in our lives
[2:48:42] if we spare the rod we spoil the child
[2:48:46] and you know I want to say this
[2:48:49] in conjunction to what our brother said
[2:48:51] no psychological help is going to be
[2:48:54] mixed with the message of the hour
[2:48:57] if we have children we have to give them
[2:48:59] correction we have to do it according to
[2:49:02] the word of God we can't say we'll just
[2:49:04] take a psychological approach and it
[2:49:07] will turn out right because it won't the
[2:49:09] only thing that will is the word of God
[2:49:12] how much more the Sons and Daughters of
[2:49:15] God
[2:49:16] brothers and sisters if you've got a
[2:49:18] spanking today I know I did
[2:49:20] if you've got a spanking today Rejoice
[2:49:22] because God loves you
[2:49:25] he's not punishing us to to hurt us he's
[2:49:28] punishing us to correct us to tell us to
[2:49:30] get back in line
[2:49:32] I don't want to look at a whole bunch of
[2:49:34] people I want to look at one lineup one
[2:49:37] bride one bright body completely in line
[2:49:41] [Music]

[2:50:24] would like to do this again

[2:50:30] thankful for the leadership of the Lord
[2:50:32] you know
[2:50:33] sometimes when we do get a little
[2:50:35] spanking in our lives
[2:50:37] it's important for the parents to pick
[2:50:39] to pick us up as children and just tell
[2:50:42] us I love you
[2:50:44] I don't spank you and throw you into the
[2:50:46] basement and make you feel beat up but I
[2:50:50] pick you up and I put you on my lap and
[2:50:52] I wrap my arms around you and I tell you
[2:50:54] that I love you
[2:50:56] you got corrected because I love you
