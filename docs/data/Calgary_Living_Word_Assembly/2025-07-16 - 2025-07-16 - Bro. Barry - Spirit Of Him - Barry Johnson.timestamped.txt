[11:57] you glory, give you honor. Father,
[11:59] you're the God of all gods. There's none

[12:18] how special you have you felt about each
[12:21] one of us, Lord. Remember our our our
[12:24] late pastor many years ago saying, "You
[12:26] can tell the price someone's willing to
[12:27] pay or the cost you're willing to pay by
[12:29] the price they pay." And you laid your
[12:31] life down for us, Lord. how great a
[12:33] cost, how great a price, how big, how
[12:36] great a value, sorry, I meant to say how
[12:38] great a value you put in our lives by by
[12:41] giving your own life for us. Lord, we
[12:43] thank you for that. We thank you for
[12:45] salvation tonight. We thank you for
[12:47] relationships. We thank you for all the
[12:49] domestic blessings you've given us.

[13:04] of unified in spirit. We come hungering
[13:07] and thirsting after righteousness. Lord
[13:09] God, would you just bless everyone that
[13:11] made the effort? I truly believe that
[13:13] and I mean that. Lord, would you bless
[13:14] them? There's there's trials of life,
[13:17] Lord. As we sang earlier, Lord, there
[13:19] there's times when things get dark, but
[13:21] Lord, it's so wonderful to walk into go
[13:24] where there's light.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you tonight, Lord, that
[13:27] we can come into this place and set
[13:29] aside specifically to worship the King
[13:32] of Kings. Lord, to come in here and and
[13:35] and unite our spirits and bring those
[13:37] licks of fire together. Lord, you just
[13:40] always bless that, Lord. It's your way
[13:42] and we thank you for that. Thank you for
[13:44] putting a seed in us that just believes
[13:46] your word, just cannot deny your word,
[13:49] but believes every word, Lord, that we
[13:52] know that that's what entitles us to the
[13:54] token. Father, when we when we do that,
[13:56] and we're so thankful for your grace in
[13:59] our lives, Lord, receive our worship
[14:00] tonight. Bless everyone, Lord, the needs
[14:02] that are represented here. Father, may
[14:04] you meet each need very sovereignly,

[24:35] It's okay.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:38] Welcome. Certainly good to be back in
[24:41] the house of the Lord with you all.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Had a wonderful time away and uh we
[24:48] caught lots of fish and had lots of
[24:50] fellowship. It was just a wonderful time
[24:52] with uh with the brothers in nature. And
[24:57] uh yeah, we're certainly thankful that
[25:00] the Lord gives us those times, a little
[25:03] time of rest, a little time of
[25:05] refreshing, and uh it's just amazing to
[25:08] see that the the same spirit. There was
[25:11] a a real mix of people. We had brothers
[25:14] from Phoenix, Arizona, and Saskatoon,
[25:17] and Calgary all together. And
[25:20] &gt;&gt; you know, we're just fellowshipping
[25:21] around the same the same word and just
[25:24] &gt;&gt; just amazing.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight we just have a couple of
[25:27] requests we'd like to remember before we
[25:30] go to prayer. And uh we want to remember
[25:32] brother Peter Bochi Manu, our deacon.
[25:36] He's traveling to Ghana this Sunday. So
[25:38] we want to pray the Lord would give him
[25:40] traveling mercies and bless his time
[25:42] away.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; We want to remember sister Rhonda. I'm
[25:47] not sure what her last name is. It's
[25:48] brother Frank Kronite sister. She is in
[25:51] need of prayer. He has requested that we
[25:54] would remember her in prayer as well.
[25:56] And also we would like to continue to
[25:57] remember the Carpent family in Saskatoon
[26:00] from Saskatoon Tabernacle whose uh wife
[26:04] and mother passed away. Sister Heather
[26:07] Carpan, if you have a need tonight,
[26:09] maybe just make it known unto him by the
[26:11] way of an uplift hand as we go to him in
[26:14] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[26:16] tonight we're so thankful that we can
[26:18] gather together one more time, Lord, the
[26:21] way that you've ordained for us in this
[26:23] day.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, we know that you've given us
[26:26] a building and you've given us a a name,
[26:29] Lord Jesus. You've given us a place to
[26:31] worship, but Father, more than anything,
[26:33] you've given yourself to us, Father. And
[26:36] we know that's your only provided place
[26:38] of worship in the day in which we live,
[26:40] Lord. It's not a geographical location.
[26:42] It's not a great ministry. It's simply
[26:45] you, Father. And Lord, we accept it the
[26:48] way that you've given it to us through
[26:50] the the message of a vindicated prophet,
[26:53] knowing it wasn't his message. It was
[26:55] your message through him, Lord.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we just thank
[26:59] you for this opportunity one more time
[27:01] to approach you, Lord, with our needs.
[27:04] Father, we ask that you would just meet
[27:06] each and every need made known unto you
[27:08] tonight by the way of an uplift hand.
[27:10] Father,
[27:11] &gt;&gt; we know that you're well aware of the
[27:13] need, Father, and you're able to meet
[27:15] it, Lord.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just thank you for
[27:18] meeting the needs tonight.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask that you would
[27:21] continue to to minister to the Carpent
[27:24] family, Lord. The loss of Sister
[27:26] Heather, Lord, it's got to be a
[27:28] difficult thing here on this side of
[27:31] eternity, Lord. To lose a mother and to
[27:33] lose a a wife and to lose a sister. Oh,
[27:37] Father.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord, we can't even
[27:39] understand it. Lord, we don't ask you
[27:42] why, but we just ask for help, Lord. You
[27:44] said that you would be our help in our
[27:46] time of trouble, Lord, that you would
[27:48] heal the brokenhearted, Lord Jesus.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, that you would comfort
[27:53] those, Lord Jesus, that need it.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; We just pray for the Carpent family, the
[27:58] congregation at Saskatoon Tabernacle,
[28:00] Lord.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to remember Brother
[28:03] Frank Kronhite sister, Lord Rhonda. We
[28:05] just want to ask that you would minister
[28:07] unto her, Father. Lord,
[28:09] &gt;&gt; we thank you for the testimony, Lord, of
[28:12] healing her, Lord.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to continue
[28:16] to remember Brother Peter Hoffer, Lord
[28:19] Jesus, before your throne, Lord. Brother
[28:21] Peter's dad, Lord Jesus. We just ask
[28:24] that you would continue ministering to
[28:25] him, Lord. We know the doctors had no
[28:28] prognosis for him, Lord. But, Father,
[28:31] he's still there and he's still hanging
[28:33] on, Lord, and and stimulated, Father, in
[28:36] ways that the doctor said he never would
[28:38] be, Father. So, Lord, we just want to
[28:40] ask that you would continue ministering
[28:42] to him and through him, Lord.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you,
[28:46] Father, we want to remember Sister Mary
[28:48] Carpenter tonight. Father, she took a
[28:50] fall, Lord. She needs a touch from you.
[28:52] The carpenters have once again requested
[28:55] prayer. Lord, we know that you're more
[28:57] than able to meet it. Father, we're so
[29:00] thankful for the testimony of brother
[29:01] Jerry Carpenter, Lord, for the fall that
[29:03] he took, Lord, the severity that it was,
[29:06] Lord, and for the doctor's own testimony
[29:08] to say that it's a miracle that he could
[29:10] be healed so quickly.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would come on
[29:13] the scene one more time for Sister Mary.
[29:16] Lord Jesus, we just want to thank you
[29:19] for all of the needs in our lives, Lord,
[29:21] because we know they're just another
[29:23] opportunity for you to minister to us,
[29:25] Lord, with your spirit living in us,
[29:28] Father. Lord, tonight we just commit all
[29:30] of the needs into your hands. Father,
[29:32] whether spoken or unspoken, Lord,
[29:35] mentioned or not, Father, we know that
[29:37] you are the discerner of the thoughts
[29:39] and the intents of the heart tonight.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; And you are the same yesterday, today,
[29:44] and forever. Father, we just ask now
[29:47] that as we turn to you in your word that
[29:50] you would minister to each and every one
[29:52] of us sovereignly tonight, Lord. Oh,
[29:54] Father. So much so that Lord, there
[29:56] would be folks that say, "Somebody must
[29:59] have heard what we were talking about
[30:01] today. Somebody must have been listening
[30:03] to our conversation in our bed chamber
[30:05] last night. Lord, we know that that's
[30:07] the God you are. And Father, we're know
[30:10] that you're so able. We just love you
[30:12] and we thank you. We commit this service
[30:15] entirely into your hands now. In Jesus
[30:17] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank
[30:21] you, musicians.
[30:24] If you have your Bibles tonight, I would
[30:25] like to continue on with our discussion
[30:28] about Romans chapter 8. As I mentioned,
[30:31] I just can't get away from it. And uh
[30:35] you know, we had talked about the the
[30:37] mind of the spirit and
[30:41] so many different angles about it. But
[30:43] tonight, I just like to continue on with
[30:45] Revelations
[30:47] chapter 8 verse 11.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:52] But if the spirit of him
[30:56] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[31:00] in you,
[31:02] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[31:05] shall also quicken your mortal bodies.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; By his spirit that dwelleth in you.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, tonight Lord,
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just invite you, Father, to
[31:21] quicken
[31:22] &gt;&gt; quicken us, Lord.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; To quicken our mortal bodies, Lord
[31:25] Jesus.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; By your spirit.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; And Father, if we've made it anything
[31:31] else, Lord Jesus, if we've made it a
[31:34] religion, if we've made it a covering,
[31:38] Father, we pray that you would just
[31:39] forgive us for it.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We pray that you would just
[31:42] manifest to us, Lord Jesus, and through
[31:45] us. That Lord, we would recognize the
[31:48] day in which we live, Father, the
[31:49] greatest day out of all of the ages. We
[31:52] know it's the culmination of all time.
[31:55] Oh, Father, and you chose for us to be
[31:58] here, for you to manifest through.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to surrender unto you one
[32:03] more time, Father.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[32:05] &gt;&gt; we just commit this service and all that
[32:07] said into your hands now in Jesus
[32:09] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. You may be
[32:13] seated. Brother Brandham uses this
[32:16] scripture, Revelations 8:11 and Mark 16
[32:20] in the message, the Easter Seal and the
[32:23] message, it is the rising of the sun.
[32:26] Two of the most profound messages I
[32:29] believe in 1965. Although all of 1965 is
[32:33] the most profound out of all the
[32:35] message. I believe it's just a
[32:37] culmination of what the Lord was doing
[32:40] through uh through our prophet and uh
[32:43] it's just such a wonderful thing. But
[32:45] the scripture tonight specifically, but
[32:47] if the spirit of him that raised up
[32:49] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[32:52] that raised up Christ from the dead
[32:54] shall also quicken your not spiritual
[32:57] bodies and not your theophony bodies,
[33:01] &gt;&gt; he'll quicken your mortal bodies. Amen.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; So, I think this is where I really want
[33:05] to get to tonight. You know, brothers
[33:07] and sisters, to think that sometime,
[33:09] some way, the spirit is going to
[33:11] transform us. It's going to change us.
[33:13] We're going to have a new body. Sure
[33:14] enough, we will. But unless his spirit
[33:17] quickens this mortal body, we will not
[33:20] see that body change.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; So, if we're not seeing his spirit
[33:25] quicken these mortal bodies, then
[33:27] tonight, I want to encourage us. I want
[33:29] to ask us. I want to implore us. I want
[33:32] to beg and plead that we would desire to
[33:36] see the spirit of him quicken these
[33:39] mortal bodies. It's not going to be
[33:42] someday out there. It's right now today,
[33:46] brothers and sisters. It's right here
[33:47] and right now. And if it's not right
[33:49] here and right now, when is it going to
[33:50] be?
[33:52] And if it's not here right now with us,
[33:55] who is it going to be? I think that we
[33:58] have been given the entire book. We know
[34:00] the the revelations 10 verse 7. We know
[34:04] that very clearly. It's like the message
[34:07] buzzword. It's the the essence of the
[34:09] message, right? Where where that mighty
[34:12] angel descended with an open book in his
[34:14] hand. We know it very clearly that when
[34:17] he should begin to sound, the mystery of
[34:20] God should be finished. We we know that
[34:22] that's already taken place. So what day
[34:24] do we live in? Brothers and sisters,
[34:25] this is no time to just play religion or
[34:28] to play church. This is the time to see
[34:30] the quickening of our mortal bodies. And
[34:33] we know that there was one that actually
[34:35] had that happen here. And he walked with
[34:38] God and he had a testimony that pleased
[34:40] God
[34:42] and he was not.
[34:45] He was just not found. And that's going
[34:47] to be the testimony of the bride of
[34:48] Jesus Christ. I believe it with all my
[34:50] heart and I just want to encourage us
[34:52] tonight. But if the spirit of him, so
[34:55] tonight I want to talk about the spirit
[34:57] of him. And I think it's so beautiful
[35:00] because it's the masculine, the spirit
[35:02] of him, the bridegroom
[35:05] living out through the bride. If the
[35:08] spirit of him
[35:10] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[35:14] in you, it's just
[35:17] I don't know. Sometimes I just wish that
[35:19] I could really express the way the way
[35:22] it just jumps out at me. You know, the
[35:25] spirit of him,
[35:27] God almighty, the mighty Jehovah, the
[35:32] one that looked at the Red Sea with
[35:33] angry eyes, the one that created the
[35:36] plagues in Egypt, the one that hardened
[35:39] Pharaoh's heart, the one that raised up
[35:41] Pharaoh so that he could have his heart
[35:43] hardened.
[35:45] the one Jehovah God that called Moses to
[35:49] the top of the mountain where he said,
[35:51] "I exceedingly fear and tremble to go up
[35:54] there and meet with him, but he's called
[35:56] me to go."
[35:58] The same one that would sit upon the
[36:02] mercy seat once a year when the priest
[36:05] would go in behind the veil and he had
[36:09] to have every single thing in his life
[36:12] absolutely
[36:14] perfect
[36:17] or they would drag him out by the rope
[36:20] that was tied to his ankle.
[36:24] The same one that would see that priest
[36:28] die in his presence. The same one that
[36:31] tore that veil from the bottom to the
[36:34] top that said once upon a time it was
[36:36] death to enter in there. But now to stay
[36:38] outside of that is death. So what does
[36:41] it mean to stay outside of that,
[36:43] brothers and sisters? It means to resist
[36:45] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[36:49] to say the quickening of this mortal
[36:50] body is a it's actually a cultural thing
[36:54] in the world in which I live in. I just
[36:56] don't get excited about the word.
[36:59] Brother Brandham says when you set a man
[37:01] on fire, set a man on fire and see if he
[37:03] sat still. The people that came out of
[37:06] the upper room, they st staggered like
[37:08] drunk people.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; They weren't just still and said, "Well,
[37:15] I'm Canadian. I just don't get excited
[37:16] about this word." You know, It's just
[37:19] it's just the way it is. No, it's not.
[37:22] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[37:24] forever.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; And he affects people the same way
[37:27] yesterday, today, and forever. It's the
[37:30] same spirit. It says it right here. If
[37:32] the spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[37:34] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[37:36] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[37:38] your mortal bodies. And I know sometimes
[37:41] it's put off. Many times it's put off to
[37:44] somewhere in the future. It'll quicken
[37:45] our mortal bodies. It'll get us up out
[37:47] of the graveyard. And sure enough, it
[37:49] will. But that's not where Mark 16 in
[37:51] action is supposed to take place. We
[37:54] need healing in our bodies right now.
[37:59] Was it here? Do we have a brother here
[38:01] preach it? I listen to a lot, but
[38:06] can't remember if it was here. The
[38:08] brother mentioned I heard a brother
[38:10] mention it, you know, when he was asked
[38:11] to go up and pray for someone and he had
[38:12] just had nothing in him. Is that was
[38:15] that here? Was that brother Roshan? I
[38:17] think it was brother Roshan that
[38:18] preached that.
[38:21] What it's like if we don't actually have
[38:25] that spirit, his spirit in us. And and I
[38:28] think it's so beautiful because the way
[38:30] it's written here, if the spirit of him,
[38:32] it makes it more of a a personal thing.
[38:35] It's not uh uh some sort of uh
[38:37] intangible spirit that's out there in
[38:39] another dimension. And and I know the
[38:42] devil loves it to be that way where we
[38:44] can have some spirit can be in you. It's
[38:47] a the spirit of him, some spirit,
[38:50] something maybe a little intangible.
[38:52] Maybe it's the spirit of the father.
[38:53] Maybe it's the spirit of the son. Maybe
[38:56] it's the spirit of the holy ghost. And
[38:58] many times the devil likes to get it all
[39:00] sort of figured out and and positionally
[39:03] placed in very specific spots. And and
[39:06] we could try and cut it up and make it
[39:09] all specifically like that in an
[39:11] intellectual fashion. And we know those
[39:13] spirits are in and around the message of
[39:14] the hour. We know that very clear. A and
[39:17] usually it's teachers and teaching
[39:19] ministries that like to be able to
[39:22] express and explain the godhead in such
[39:24] a way that they even confuse themselves
[39:27] in a service. But I want to say tonight,
[39:29] brothers and sisters, let's not make it
[39:31] confusing or confounding because that's
[39:34] not the word of God that we understand.
[39:37] It's the spirit of him. It is Jesus
[39:40] Christ, the person of Jesus Christ,
[39:42] which is God the Father, manifest in the
[39:45] flesh, that was raised up from the dead,
[39:48] went back to sit down with the father on
[39:50] the right hand of the father, and he
[39:52] sent back his spirit to dwell in his
[39:54] people. It's the same spirit. It's the
[39:58] same personality. It's not a different
[40:00] person. It's the same person. We sing
[40:03] that song. If the same spirit that
[40:07] raised Christ from the dead dwells in
[40:11] you,
[40:13] it will quicken your mortal body. It
[40:16] won't just raise it up on the last day.
[40:18] It will be like Jesus Christ walking up
[40:21] to the tomb of Lazarus and putting his
[40:23] shoulders back and speaking with a loud
[40:25] voice. We know that his sister,
[40:27] Lazarus's sister, said, "If you would
[40:29] have been here a little bit sooner, he
[40:30] wouldn't have died. If you would have
[40:31] just answered our phone calls, if you
[40:33] would have just responded to the text,
[40:35] but you just ignored us. Now he's dead."
[40:40] But you could raise him up again at the
[40:42] last day. And he said, "You know what? I
[40:46] am the resurrection and the life."
[40:50] &gt;&gt; You're looking at it right here. This is
[40:52] the resurrection standing right before
[40:55] you. And tonight, brothers and sisters,
[40:57] I want to say this. I'm not the
[40:59] resurrection, but he is.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And he
[41:03] &gt;&gt; the masculine. If he, the spirit of him,
[41:07] dwells in you, it will quicken your
[41:09] mortal body to this word.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; We won't make an excuse for it and say,
[41:15] you know, I'll just do it this way. I
[41:17] can just do it this way. I've done it
[41:19] for years this way. It's been just fine
[41:20] this way. Has it been? Will it be? I
[41:24] don't know. I don't know. I think that
[41:27] we're all being called to live a little
[41:29] bit higher. He's calling all of us up a
[41:31] little higher. John, a type of the
[41:33] bride, was shown an open door in heaven
[41:36] and told, "Get in the spirit, John, and
[41:39] come a little higher."
[41:42] And we know, Brother Brandham says it in
[41:43] the church age book. You know, we ought
[41:44] to be just as exuberant, just as
[41:46] exuberant as the people that get excited
[41:48] about the sports games in this world.
[41:50] Just as exuberant about the people that
[41:52] love to go to the Calgary Stampede and
[41:54] hear the marching band and and just clap
[41:56] and scream and get excited. And when
[41:58] when the Flames score a goal and the
[42:00] Stampeders make a touchdown when we see
[42:03] something that really gets us excited in
[42:05] our lives, we ought to be just as
[42:07] exuberant about it in the church of the
[42:09] living God as we are out in the world.
[42:13] And I say, brothers and sisters, if
[42:15] we're not, there's something wrong.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong.
[42:20] Now, maybe someone would go to a hockey
[42:21] game and just sit there like a dried up
[42:24] old stick.
[42:26] That would be me because I don't care. I
[42:30] don't care about hockey. I don't care
[42:32] about football. I don't care about
[42:33] sports. I I would rather go hunting or
[42:36] fishing. I'd rather go and do different
[42:37] things, do something creative. But
[42:40] that's just me. There's other people
[42:42] that really, really get excited about a
[42:45] piece of rubber being slapped down the
[42:47] ice into a goal. It gets them excited.
[42:51] Other people love pigkins being kicked
[42:53] and thrown down the down the field and
[42:56] and football. They love that and it just
[42:58] gets them so excited. But what gets you
[43:01] excited tonight?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Is it the word of God?
[43:05] Is it understanding that the whole
[43:07] entire book is open and put back into
[43:10] the hands of man and we've been given it
[43:12] and told to eat it and because we eat
[43:15] it, we become it.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Does that get us excited?
[43:21] &gt;&gt; My, if the spirit of him that raised up
[43:24] Christ from the dead dwell in you, it'll
[43:26] quicken your mortal bodies. And it, the
[43:28] word quicken means bring to life.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; It'll bring to life. The people that we
[43:33] used to be will no longer be. People
[43:35] will look at us and say, "What is it
[43:37] about you? What happened to you? Why are
[43:40] you the way you are? What makes you so
[43:42] different?"
[43:43] And we'll have a reason. We'll have an
[43:46] excuse for the testimony, the life
[43:48] that's inside of us.
[43:51] So enjoyed the service on Sunday. I was
[43:53] streaming it on on Tuesday on the way
[43:56] back when Christopher and I came back
[43:58] from Saskatchewan.
[44:00] So beautiful to try the spirits. Try the
[44:04] spirits,
[44:06] try the thoughts,
[44:08] try the ideologies,
[44:12] try the the traditions, try the spirits,
[44:16] and see if they're correct. We know that
[44:19] it says in the word to try the spirits.
[44:21] And I'm not trying to add to or take
[44:23] away, and I don't think that's what
[44:23] brother Dawn was doing, but I just so
[44:25] appreciated the service. It was so good
[44:27] how we ought to be. You know, if we
[44:29] would just spend more time staying in
[44:31] our lanes, we would get more done.
[44:36] if if we would just thank God for the
[44:39] deacons and so thankful that God has
[44:41] brothers that really desire to step up
[44:43] and put their shoulder to the wheel and
[44:45] stand in the office of a deacon in the
[44:47] church instead of being critical about
[44:50] deacons and maybe they didn't do this
[44:52] the way that I think they should do it
[44:53] or they didn't do that or or maybe the
[44:55] pastor or maybe the song leader whatever
[44:58] if we would just be thankful for what
[45:00] God is doing and pray for one another we
[45:04] would probably get a whole lot more done
[45:06] in the body. But I think it's so
[45:08] important to try the spirits and test
[45:10] the thinking. Test the thinking. See
[45:13] what that thinking is. Is it lining up
[45:14] with the word of God? Is it the spirit
[45:16] of him that's living in us causing our
[45:19] thinking to actually line up with the
[45:21] word of God? If it is, then we're not
[45:24] going to make excuses for our behavior
[45:25] in our marriage. We're simply going to
[45:27] be a good husband to our wives. We're
[45:29] going to love our wives. That's what the
[45:31] word of God says. And the wives because
[45:33] of that are going to reverence their
[45:35] husbands.
[45:37] And the children will look at that and
[45:38] say, "Wow, I want to honor my father and
[45:42] honor my mother because I know the word
[45:45] of God says that my days will be long
[45:48] upon the earth."
[45:49] &gt;&gt; And you know, I remember brother Ken,
[45:52] it's interesting brother uh brother Paul
[45:54] mentioned it. You know, our late pastor,
[45:56] brother Ken brought this out so clearly
[45:58] many times. We have heard it said in the
[46:01] past. I don't know if everyone has, but
[46:02] I've heard it said where a wife just
[46:04] will not submit to her husband because,
[46:06] you know, the word of God says that she
[46:08] should reverence her husband. But you
[46:10] know what? He's got nothing that I can
[46:12] reverence. There's no nothing. He
[46:14] doesn't do anything that I can respect.
[46:16] So why would I respect him? Why would
[46:18] you? Because God's word says so.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Why would I love my wife? She doesn't
[46:24] reverence me.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; The word of God says so.
[46:30] And you know, when we're not doing those
[46:32] things, we're not pleasing God. We're
[46:34] not serving God. We're serving
[46:36] ourselves. And what is it that we're
[46:38] doing? We're actually not serving
[46:39] ourselves. We're actually serving the
[46:41] devil because it's either good or it's
[46:44] evil. It's not in between. There's no
[46:46] middle ground. There's no shade of gray
[46:47] with the word of God. But I really
[46:50] appreciated the way that Brother Dawn
[46:52] brought that, the way the Lord used
[46:53] brother Dawn on Sunday. And I think that
[46:56] if anyone hasn't gone back and listened
[46:57] to it, I would say it's well worth a
[46:59] second or even a third listening because
[47:02] of some of the points that were made in
[47:04] there. We can think that we're serving
[47:06] God when we're actually not serving God
[47:09] when we get outside of the word, but we
[47:11] need to look at the perspective that
[47:13] we're looking at things. And you know,
[47:15] the devil will always make us feel
[47:17] right. He'll always make our position
[47:21] the important one. He'll always make us
[47:24] feel righteous in our position, in our
[47:27] opinion. We can always find a quote. We
[47:30] can always find a scripture. But are we
[47:33] actually of the right spirit?
[47:36] Brother Bradom says it very clearly,
[47:37] doesn't he? He said that true revelation
[47:40] of the word of God, true revelation
[47:43] causes humility. It doesn't cause us to
[47:46] become puffed up and say that I'm right.
[47:47] You need to submit. you need to get in
[47:49] line because my ideas are best. No, it
[47:53] doesn't. That's not the right spirit.
[48:00] And that's what I'm talking about
[48:01] tonight, brothers and sisters, is his
[48:02] spirit, the spirit of him. If his spirit
[48:04] is in us, it's going to quicken our
[48:05] mortal bodies. One day out of the
[48:08] graveyard, perhaps maybe one day into a
[48:10] body change, but what about right now in
[48:13] into our families? What about right now
[48:15] into our jobs, our careers? What about
[48:17] right now into the congregation of our
[48:19] brothers and our sisters? Are we loving
[48:21] our brothers and our sisters? You know,
[48:24] we've got to be willing to to try the
[48:26] spirits. We need to test the thinking.
[48:28] We need to look at the perspective and
[48:30] and not look at the perspective of
[48:32] others. Forget about others. Look at our
[48:34] perspective. What's our perspective? Are
[48:38] we looking at the picture right?
[48:41] And and I just couldn't get past that.
[48:44] The way Brother Don brought that right
[48:46] at the beginning of it, you know,
[48:47] Brother Brandham, he got that that that
[48:50] picture and and the picture of the cloud
[48:52] and and through discernment, he heard
[48:53] the spirit of God, the spirit of him
[48:56] speak to him and say to him, "Turn it
[48:59] right." We need to get the right
[49:01] perspective of what's going on here. Are
[49:04] we having the right perspect do we have
[49:07] the right perspective of the message of
[49:09] the hour today brothers and sisters? Is
[49:12] it a religion or is it a covering for us
[49:17] to just live our lives any way we want
[49:20] or does it quicken our mortal bodies to
[49:23] the word of God?
[49:26] Does it bring us to a place where we say
[49:28] that I'm wrong? I know I'm wrong and I
[49:30] just want to be right at any cost. Lord,
[49:33] if you need to take this this pot, this
[49:35] vessel and break it into pieces to put
[49:38] it back together the way that it should
[49:39] be, then do it. Are we willing to put
[49:42] ourselves on the potter's wheel?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; It's not a comfortable thing. It's not a
[49:49] comfortable place, but until we're ready
[49:52] to do that, until we're ready to tear it
[49:54] down to the foundation and build it up
[49:58] again,
[49:59] we're not actually getting anywhere. We
[50:02] just simply have a religion. We simply
[50:05] have a covering
[50:07] because the spirit of him will always
[50:12] line up with the word of God. The spirit
[50:15] of him will always receive correction.
[50:19] We got into it a little bit on the on
[50:21] the journey. You know, when you travel
[50:23] many many hours with people, you just
[50:25] have so much opportunity for fellowship.
[50:27] And you know, one of the brothers, he's
[50:29] from Arizona and he's an elder. He's,
[50:31] you know, just about 70. And he was
[50:33] talking about how God got a hold of his
[50:35] life. And I just love listening to those
[50:38] older brothers and to ask them, "How did
[50:40] you hear about this message? How can you
[50:42] be, you know, still serving God and and
[50:45] in the message of the hour, so many
[50:48] years later, 45 years, 50 years of
[50:51] service for the kingdom of God in this
[50:54] message and still just love him as much
[50:56] as the day when you first met him?"
[51:00] And he said, 'You know what I discovered
[51:02] was? I discovered that really my ways of
[51:05] thinking are are wrong. My ways of
[51:07] thinking are going to lead me into
[51:08] error. And alls I did was surrender
[51:11] myself to his will completely. If if if
[51:14] the Lord told me something, if I heard
[51:16] something preached, I would take it and
[51:18] apply it in my life. And I I got to the
[51:20] place where I recognized that God speaks
[51:22] to us through men. And and when God
[51:25] would speak to me individually, I would
[51:28] say, "Ouch, that hurts. I don't like
[51:31] that, but I'll do it."
[51:34] And he said, "When I started to do that
[51:37] in my life, when I was a young
[51:38] Christian, what I found was
[51:42] God just poured out a blessing on me."
[51:46] And then another step would come. God
[51:48] would say, "I don't like that. I want
[51:50] you to change that." And and I would do
[51:52] it. and God would just pour out another
[51:55] blessing on me. And he said, 'You know
[51:57] what I found? By serving the Lord and
[52:00] following his leadership, because he's a
[52:03] gentleman, he doesn't slap us into
[52:05] submission,
[52:08] he woos us. But by listening to his
[52:11] wooing, to his voice, what I found was I
[52:14] I got myself into a cycle of blessing
[52:19] for years, for decades. And he said, "I
[52:23] can't explain it other than full
[52:26] obedience to the complete word of God
[52:28] entitles us to the token. And when you
[52:31] get there, I've just experienced a
[52:34] continual cycle of blessing in my life."
[52:37] And I thought, "My, what an
[52:40] encouragement. Lord, help me. Help me
[52:42] capture that that place. Help me find
[52:44] that channel where I can experience
[52:47] that. I know that I have. I'm not saying
[52:49] that I have it. Not for a second. But
[52:51] let me just stay there in that position
[52:53] where it is a continual cycle of
[52:55] blessing. And you know the blessing
[52:57] isn't necessarily I've I've got a great
[52:59] job and I've got a big fat bank account
[53:01] and all my needs are looked after. You
[53:03] know, one of the biggest blessings that
[53:04] we can get, brothers and sisters, is to
[53:06] have a church to go to where we hear the
[53:08] pure word of God in season where we get
[53:12] the truth preached to us where it it
[53:15] maybe doesn't feel the best, maybe it
[53:17] doesn't look the best, but it is the
[53:19] best. That's all we need, brothers and
[53:21] sisters. If we can actually get to that
[53:23] place, I believe the Lord will just
[53:25] bless us in a way that we can't even
[53:27] contain it. Because the blessing after
[53:30] all isn't a Leodysian blessing. He
[53:33] doesn't say that I'm going to bless you
[53:35] with Leodysian blessings. He says try
[53:38] try test the spirits, but I I counsel
[53:41] you to buy of me gold that's tried in
[53:45] the fire. And we know we heard about
[53:47] that in the church age book. That is the
[53:49] character of of him,
[53:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:53] &gt;&gt; It's the character of him. But we've got
[53:56] to look at this message through the
[53:58] right perspective. And and does it align
[54:00] with the word of God? Does does our
[54:02] traditions align with the word of God?
[54:04] Does it align with the message of the
[54:05] hour? Do our actions match our
[54:08] confession? Does our confession match
[54:10] the word? Anybody can say that they
[54:14] believe God sent a prophet. Anyone can
[54:21] you know the Mormons do. If you listen
[54:25] to the testimony of a Mormon, you would
[54:27] sound you would hear someone talk just
[54:29] like a message believer.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; They believe the word of God. They
[54:34] believe God sent a prophet. It was an
[54:35] enlightened word that brought them to a
[54:37] greater understanding of the word. But
[54:40] you know, anyone can say that they
[54:42] believe a prophet. But the only one
[54:44] that's actually going to be right is the
[54:45] one who's actually able to receive the
[54:47] word for their day. And the word for
[54:50] their day is going to match the word of
[54:52] God. It's not going to be a
[54:54] supplementary word.
[54:56] God's not going to do it any other way.
[54:59] And you know, that's the thing for me.
[55:01] That was the crux that showed me that
[55:03] this vindicated prophet that we talk
[55:05] about, William Mary Brandham, maybe they
[55:07] say that he was often his doctor. They
[55:08] sure loved his first and second poll
[55:10] just like Jesus when he was here. They
[55:12] love the signs and wonders in Jesus'
[55:14] ministry. But boy, when he sat down one
[55:16] day and said, "I and my father are one."
[55:18] That's when they said, "You know, we
[55:20] love you, but we can't stand that you
[55:21] call yourself God." That's going too
[55:23] far. And we know that brother Bradom
[55:26] when he was in Regina, Canada, there was
[55:29] a shift in his ministry. And it went
[55:32] from being able to heal people and and
[55:35] see mighty healings and and discern the
[55:37] diseases that were in people and to be
[55:39] able to see the healings come on the
[55:41] scene. He know we know there was a man
[55:43] that walked across the platform. Brother
[55:44] Brandham says that in Regina, Canada.
[55:46] And that was a change of his ministry.
[55:48] It was to be able to discern the hearts
[55:50] of men. And there's only one person that
[55:53] can do that. And you know, when you
[55:55] start talking like that, it gets a bit
[55:57] weird. People love though the first and
[55:59] second pulls of that ministry as well.
[56:01] They like to see that there was someone
[56:03] able to tell them their address. There
[56:06] was someone able to tell them what their
[56:07] ailments were. And not just that, but
[56:09] they would say, "Sister sitting in the
[56:11] row with the blonde hair and the black
[56:13] dress with the flowers, you have this
[56:15] wrong with you. And the woman next to
[56:16] you is your mother, and she is praying
[56:18] for this. and the woman in the green
[56:20] dress, you're praying for that. And the
[56:22] man in the blue shirt, you're praying
[56:24] for that. Who could do that?
[56:28] But boy,
[56:30] when the cloud popped up in 1963,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; that cloud that we were talking about a
[56:36] little earlier where we, you know, we
[56:37] know that he was told turn it right,
[56:39] there's there's a perspective of it and
[56:42] he really talks about it in it is the
[56:43] rising of the sun. And it wasn't the su
[56:47] just for clarity. It was the rising of
[56:49] the S O N. It is the rising, the
[56:52] resurrection of the S O N, the Easter
[56:55] seal. That Easter seal is the literal
[56:58] life of Jesus Christ coming back on
[57:00] earth again. And that was what he was he
[57:02] was teaching. He was showing the world
[57:04] that there was an open book that the
[57:05] seals were opened and all of those
[57:08] unknown mysteries contained in the
[57:10] thunders that John was told to seal up,
[57:12] all of those mysteries were made
[57:15] history.
[57:17] All of that was explained. But that's
[57:19] where all of the theology, all of the
[57:22] the theologians, all of the great
[57:24] ministries around the world, they they
[57:26] closed their doors. They stepped back
[57:28] and said, "Nope, this guy's off his
[57:29] rocker." But this is where I wanted to
[57:31] get to, brothers and sisters. He didn't
[57:33] have plates that came down from an
[57:35] angel, and he wasn't given glasses that
[57:37] he could specially see and and have some
[57:39] brand new text that was given. What he
[57:41] said very clearly was all of those
[57:44] mysteries were not revealed in another
[57:46] book. They were already in the book.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And it took the quickening power, the
[57:51] spirit of him to come by every single
[57:53] day when those seals were open. The
[57:55] angel of the Lord came and corrected him
[57:57] and showed him the meaning of those
[57:59] seals that were already in the Bible. It
[58:02] wasn't a new book. He said very clearly
[58:05] it couldn't be another book. It had to
[58:06] be the same word.
[58:10] But it's easy to say God sent a prophet.
[58:12] You know in James 2:19, "Thou believest
[58:14] that there is one God. Thou doest well."
[58:17] The devils also believe and tremble. The
[58:20] devils know it. The devils know full
[58:23] well that God sent a prophet. And we
[58:26] know, Brother Brandham says it so many
[58:28] times. Fools will tread in hobnailed
[58:32] shoes.
[58:34] Fools will walk in hobnailed shoes where
[58:37] angels fear to tread. They'll never go
[58:40] near it. Never. Never, never, never. But
[58:42] you know, some people in this world just
[58:44] aren't afraid. Just aren't afraid. In
[58:48] James 2:18, the verse just before it
[58:51] says, "Yay, a man may say, "Thou hast
[58:54] faith, and I have works."
[58:57] You know, Brother Brandham preaches
[58:59] works is faith expressed.
[59:03] Yeah. Your man may say, "Thou hast
[59:05] faith, and I have works. Show me thy
[59:07] faith without thy works.
[59:12] Talk is cheap.
[59:14] And I will show thee my faith by my
[59:17] works. The simple things, the ABCs.
[59:22] I'll show you that I believe by the life
[59:25] that I live. I heard it a couple times
[59:28] over the weekend when I was there. You
[59:30] know, Brother George Smith, he says
[59:31] this. I I might get it wrong. He says,
[59:33] "Preach, preach, preach a lot and
[59:38] sometimes speak
[59:41] preach the gospel with the life that you
[59:44] live and just every once in a while say
[59:46] something about it." Because the life
[59:48] that we live speaks way louder than the
[59:51] words that we speak. And why is that?
[59:54] Because if we live a life contrary to
[59:56] the words that we speak, people aren't
[59:58] going to believe us. They're going to
[59:59] call us a hypocrite and they'll say,
[1:00:01] "You're just like all the other
[1:00:02] Christians in this world. Why would I
[1:00:03] ever want to serve a God like that?"
[1:00:08] But you know, the devil, he knows, he
[1:00:10] knows full well and he trembles.
[1:00:13] And I think it's beautiful right now,
[1:00:15] brothers and sisters, anybody here under
[1:00:16] pressure tonight? Anybody here under
[1:00:19] anxiety or stress? This is the world
[1:00:22] that we live in. There's a reason for
[1:00:24] it. the the devil, he knows that his
[1:00:26] time is very very short.
[1:00:30] Over 50 years ago, the seventh angel
[1:00:33] messenger was in his position
[1:00:37] and he brought forth his message and God
[1:00:40] took him home. He finished his
[1:00:42] commission and God took him home.
[1:00:44] Otherwise, he would still be here. He
[1:00:46] did what he was supposed to do. And what
[1:00:47] was he supposed to do? He was Elyer for
[1:00:50] the bride of Christ. He was the L easer
[1:00:53] for this day for Isaac. And you know
[1:00:56] Rebecca heard his voice and Rebecca
[1:01:00] said, "Yeah, take me to him." And
[1:01:03] Rebecca has met him. And now there's a
[1:01:07] wedding going on.
[1:01:10] But that's the day in which we live,
[1:01:11] brothers and sisters. The devil is not
[1:01:13] going to give up easy. He's going to
[1:01:15] fight every single step of the way,
[1:01:18] every single inch of the way. And unless
[1:01:21] we're fully surrendered unto the Lord,
[1:01:23] the devil has right. He's got a right to
[1:01:26] that punch coming our way. But you know,
[1:01:29] when we actually are fully surrendered
[1:01:31] to this word of God, the devil can only
[1:01:33] punch so hard. He can only go so far. He
[1:01:38] has to actually stop. And I I just love
[1:01:40] it. Brother Ken, I'm I don't know why he
[1:01:41] keeps coming up tonight. I think it's so
[1:01:43] good. He always said it. You know, when
[1:01:45] we when we live our lives, we're sewing
[1:01:47] we're sewing seeds all the way along.
[1:01:49] And we're going to reap a harvest, some
[1:01:52] good harvest and some bad harvest as we
[1:01:54] go. But we can pray, Lord, lessen the
[1:01:57] bad harvest.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Help those seeds not to grow as as good
[1:02:02] as they could because it's true. He can
[1:02:04] help us in our time of trouble.
[1:02:07] You know, I I've got a couple quotes
[1:02:09] tonight talking about the spirit of him.
[1:02:11] This one, the first one is 1958.
[1:02:14] the unity of one God in the one church.
[1:02:21] Brother Bradam, he says Jesus prayed for
[1:02:23] that in the prayer tonight. Our heavenly
[1:02:26] father prayed to the father
[1:02:29] that we would be one as he and God is
[1:02:32] one. And how close were they?
[1:02:36] God
[1:02:37] was the life and spirit in him.
[1:02:41] And if we are one with him, we will be
[1:02:46] life and spirit of him will be in us.
[1:02:52] I think it's I just want to say this
[1:02:55] tonight. It can be easy to read these
[1:02:57] and and say these and and even maybe
[1:03:02] believe these. Maybe we can have a
[1:03:04] little bit of this comes to mind easy
[1:03:06] belieism.
[1:03:08] But brothers and sisters, we're not
[1:03:10] talking about just the hearing of the
[1:03:12] word. We're talking about the doing of
[1:03:14] the word, seeing the word manifest in
[1:03:16] our lives. If it's not manifesting in
[1:03:19] our lives, the way that we're reading
[1:03:20] about it, then there's something wrong.
[1:03:23] And we're not wrong. There's just
[1:03:26] something wrong. And and I want to say
[1:03:28] tonight that there could be a quickening
[1:03:30] of the word to us. We could actually see
[1:03:33] a change in our lives, a change in our
[1:03:35] behaviors. It's not too late. Just
[1:03:38] because we've done it one way all the
[1:03:40] way along, it doesn't mean that it's the
[1:03:42] right way. And it doesn't mean that it
[1:03:43] will actually allow the full quickening
[1:03:46] power of the word to come forth in our
[1:03:48] lives. But if we actually just suspend
[1:03:51] all of our thinking and just say, Lord,
[1:03:53] hey, if there's something to what's
[1:03:55] being said tonight, just be it unto me
[1:03:57] according to the word that's coming
[1:03:58] forward. I promise you, he will quicken
[1:04:01] your mortal body to this word.
[1:04:05] It won't just be easy belieism.
[1:04:08] Amen. I believe God sent a prophet.
[1:04:10] Yeah. God was the life and spirit in
[1:04:14] him. And if we are one with him, we will
[1:04:17] be life and spirit of him will be in us.
[1:04:20] Then earthly carnal intellectuals
[1:04:23] conception and creeds and dogmas will
[1:04:26] fade out. They won't remain.
[1:04:30] If they're remaining in our lives, if
[1:04:32] they're holding on in our lives, I want
[1:04:34] to say tonight, what spirit is reigning
[1:04:37] in our lives?
[1:04:41] They will fade out and a new generated
[1:04:45] bornagain virgin experience of the
[1:04:48] baptism of the Holy Spirit will take
[1:04:52] place in the human heart.
[1:04:56] Then you'll be one.
[1:04:59] Then brother will really be brother.
[1:05:03] Sister
[1:05:05] will be sister.
[1:05:07] Your objectives and your motives and all
[1:05:10] that you are and all that you ever want
[1:05:14] to be or try to be
[1:05:17] will be for the kingdom of God.
[1:05:20] No matter what church you represent,
[1:05:23] where you go, or what you do.
[1:05:27] I think it's such a such a a beautiful
[1:05:31] thing to think about this. Doesn't
[1:05:33] matter where we go, it will be living
[1:05:37] for the kingdom of God. It will be
[1:05:39] living for others, desiring to see
[1:05:42] people come to the fullness of the word
[1:05:45] to the degree that we are, to the degree
[1:05:48] that we have.
[1:05:51] I just couldn't help but think about it
[1:05:53] when I was studying this a little bit,
[1:05:55] you know, thinking about the spirit of
[1:05:57] him and and the spirit of him and and
[1:06:00] how that Shunomite woman of second Kings
[1:06:03] chapter 4, she got to see the spirit of
[1:06:06] him before the Holy Spirit was come. But
[1:06:09] who I want to say this tonight, whose
[1:06:10] spirit was it that was represented in
[1:06:13] the prophet of Elijah? Who was that
[1:06:17] spirit? Not what was that spirit? Who
[1:06:21] was that spirit? It's the same spirit,
[1:06:24] brothers and sisters. It's not a
[1:06:26] different spirit. It's not a spirit that
[1:06:28] was separated under bulls and goats. It
[1:06:31] wasn't that.
[1:06:34] It can't be that. He is the same
[1:06:36] yesterday, today, and forever. It has to
[1:06:39] be the exact same spirit. And we know
[1:06:41] this woman recognized it, right? Because
[1:06:43] she had an offering made unto this
[1:06:46] prophet. She was able to receive a son
[1:06:49] from the spirit that this prophet
[1:06:51] represented. And we know that the same
[1:06:54] spirit raised up her son.
[1:06:57] Her son got sick, had a headache, and
[1:06:59] maybe had a stroke in the field the one
[1:07:01] day. We know the story. And she said,
[1:07:03] "You know what? Hasten, saddle me and
[1:07:04] ass. Get me going. Get get us in the
[1:07:07] vehicle and let's get over there to
[1:07:09] where that prophet is because he's the
[1:07:10] one with the spirit of him. We need that
[1:07:13] spirit to come on the scene." God, that
[1:07:15] spirit gave me this son and God, that
[1:07:18] same spirit will raise this son up. She
[1:07:20] had a faith inside of her that was able
[1:07:23] to see the spirit of him. And and I
[1:07:26] think about another one as we continue
[1:07:29] on tonight. And and that's Gyrus's
[1:07:31] daughter. And Gyrus, we know, had a
[1:07:34] desire to see his daughter raised up
[1:07:36] again.
[1:07:39] And the spirit of him came by his way
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; and brought his daughter back to life
[1:07:45] again. And we know brother Brandham
[1:07:46] talks about it. There was mockers in the
[1:07:48] house and he said, "Everyone just get
[1:07:49] out.
[1:07:52] Just get out of here. We got some
[1:07:53] business to do. I'm going to show you
[1:07:55] that it's the same spirit. It is not a
[1:07:58] different spirit. I am the resurrection
[1:08:01] and the life."
[1:08:03] And we know there's another one that
[1:08:05] came on the scene and that one was
[1:08:07] Lazarus. Lazarus had been dead. We
[1:08:10] talked about a little bit earlier. He he
[1:08:12] had been dead and Jesus allowed him to
[1:08:14] die. And he said, "I'm thankful that
[1:08:16] he's dead for your sakes so that you can
[1:08:21] see this so that you can witness the
[1:08:23] true power of almighty God."
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Lazarus was dead four days.
[1:08:32] We know that the sisters said that if
[1:08:35] you would have come wouldn't have
[1:08:36] happened. Sometimes he lets things
[1:08:39] happen in our lives so that we can see
[1:08:41] his power in our lives. And you know,
[1:08:44] brothers and sisters, I want to say
[1:08:45] this. What's greater?
[1:08:49] What's greater? If we see a great
[1:08:51] tremendous miracle in our life where we
[1:08:54] have a real need and and we bring it to
[1:08:57] the Lord and he gives us the answer for
[1:09:00] our need
[1:09:02] because we prayed and we believed or
[1:09:06] when we pray and we believe and he says
[1:09:09] no
[1:09:11] and he doesn't give us what we desire
[1:09:14] the way that we desire it. But when we
[1:09:17] go by years down the road and we look
[1:09:19] back and we can see that we still love
[1:09:22] him just the same as when we asked him
[1:09:26] before. Which is a greater miracle,
[1:09:28] brothers and sisters?
[1:09:30] Personally, I think it's a greater
[1:09:32] miracle, humanly speaking, that we could
[1:09:34] love him just as much or more down the
[1:09:36] road when we get the no answer than when
[1:09:38] we truly get what we desire.
[1:09:43] But we all have different opinions,
[1:09:45] varying opinions. And that's why I think
[1:09:47] it's beautiful. God has a bouquet of
[1:09:49] people and there is an absolute. And if
[1:09:51] we ever want to know where we stand, we
[1:09:54] can always just take a look down at our
[1:09:56] roots. We might be one type of flower
[1:09:58] and you might be one type of flower, but
[1:10:00] all of our roots are going to be feeding
[1:10:01] off the exact same nutrition. And that
[1:10:03] is the same word of God. That is our
[1:10:06] absolute.
[1:10:08] But we know Lazarus, he got to meet the
[1:10:10] spirit of him. There was nothing that
[1:10:12] Lazarus could do. Lazarus didn't even
[1:10:15] have ears to hear what the spirit saith.
[1:10:18] Right? Lazarus was bound head to foot.
[1:10:21] Lazarus couldn't do anything.
[1:10:25] But Jesus came to him.
[1:10:28] Jesus came to him and spoke his name.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:10:34] every single one of us is exactly like
[1:10:36] Lazarus.
[1:10:38] Dead. nothing that we could ever do for
[1:10:41] ourselves. I know that I was walking in
[1:10:43] sin. I was born in sin shaped in
[1:10:44] iniquity. Come to the world speaking
[1:10:46] lies. Thought that I had the ability to
[1:10:48] meet God. Thought that what was going
[1:10:50] on, witnessed it with my excuse me, my
[1:10:52] own eyes and and thought that it was
[1:10:54] fake and and hypocritical and all kinds
[1:10:56] of stuff. So, I just went headlong into
[1:10:58] the world. Should have been no hope for
[1:11:00] me.
[1:11:02] But God, who is rich in mercy, my my
[1:11:07] goodness.
[1:11:08] Yet when I was dead in sin and trespass,
[1:11:12] came and made himself known to me.
[1:11:16] My
[1:11:19] another one that I just can't help but
[1:11:21] think about tonight as we go is the
[1:11:23] centurion. And we know brother Brandham
[1:11:26] talks about that man is a type of the
[1:11:28] gentile church. We know the Jews are all
[1:11:32] about laying on of hands. And brother
[1:11:34] Brandham even says that we don't need to
[1:11:36] lay on hands. We've got the anointing
[1:11:38] that that centurion had, the same level
[1:11:40] of faith. I'm not even worthy that you
[1:11:42] would even come under my house for my
[1:11:44] servant who is very sick previously unto
[1:11:46] death. But if you would just speak one
[1:11:48] word, just speak one word about my
[1:11:51] servant. And he said, you know, I
[1:11:54] haven't seen faith like that in all of
[1:11:55] Israel. And here we are talking to some
[1:11:58] Gentile.
[1:12:00] Wow.
[1:12:02] But that centurion had a revelation
[1:12:05] about the spirit of him. There was
[1:12:07] something about this man. There was
[1:12:08] something in him. He if if the same
[1:12:11] spirit that's in him could just come by
[1:12:14] and quicken the mortal body of my
[1:12:16] servant, I know that he could get well.
[1:12:19] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:21] forever. Brothers and sisters, don't
[1:12:23] discount him in any way. Don't think
[1:12:26] that he can't come, that he won't come
[1:12:28] on the scene for us in our lives.
[1:12:31] You know, I just can't help but think
[1:12:33] about the the other Shunomite woman. We
[1:12:36] talked about her a little while ago, and
[1:12:38] I just felt like I had to mention her
[1:12:39] tonight. And you know, the modern-day
[1:12:41] Shunomite woman of Memphis, Tennessee,
[1:12:45] never heard about a prophet, never heard
[1:12:47] about a healing ministry, but she knew
[1:12:50] that there was an Elijah in the Bible.
[1:12:54] And we know that she got to praying
[1:12:56] because she believed there was a God.
[1:12:58] She believed there was a Jesus Christ
[1:13:00] that died and rose again for her sins.
[1:13:03] She believed and she believed that there
[1:13:07] was an Elijah for her. And she prayed
[1:13:09] all night for that Elijah to come her
[1:13:11] way. And wasn't it interesting that God
[1:13:13] literally sent her an Elijah
[1:13:16] to come and minister to her son, to
[1:13:18] raise up her son, that Shounomite woman.
[1:13:23] You know, in uh what's this one here?
[1:13:26] Blind Barameus.
[1:13:28] We talked about this a little while ago,
[1:13:30] but brother Bradomy says God lives in
[1:13:33] his people.
[1:13:35] He's alive working among his people,
[1:13:39] resurrected and calling out his people
[1:13:43] and wooing them to him. Isn't that
[1:13:47] beautiful? He's not slapping them to
[1:13:49] him. He's not forcing them to him. He's
[1:13:52] wooing them, reminding them over and
[1:13:55] over again, I love you. I desire you. I
[1:13:59] want to see you set with me in my
[1:14:02] throne. That's the promise for your age.
[1:14:04] Just get in line with the word for your
[1:14:06] day and you're set. That's all you have
[1:14:09] to do. Surrender your life to the word
[1:14:13] for your day. He's wooing them to him.
[1:14:16] And these true offices of God witness
[1:14:20] the same thing because they're filled
[1:14:22] with that spirit of him that was lived
[1:14:26] on earth in human flesh in the body of
[1:14:30] Jesus
[1:14:31] which sits at the right hand of God now
[1:14:34] to make intercessions
[1:14:36] and his spirit is down here moving among
[1:14:41] his people.
[1:14:43] Blessed be his holy name. moving in his
[1:14:47] people.
[1:14:49] A lively church
[1:14:51] filled with the spirit with the spirit
[1:14:55] of him.
[1:14:57] Not just a spirit. Not just the spirit,
[1:15:03] but his spirit filled with his spirit
[1:15:07] moving in his people. A lively church
[1:15:11] filled with the spirit. all of his gifts
[1:15:14] and wonders working perfectly in the
[1:15:18] body.
[1:15:21] You know, I think about a marriage
[1:15:25] as we talk about this like we heard
[1:15:26] about on Sunday and to think about his
[1:15:29] people, a lively marriage
[1:15:32] filled with the spirit.
[1:15:36] Because you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:15:38] we can talk about the church and having
[1:15:41] the spirit in the church and being truly
[1:15:44] surrendered in the church and having the
[1:15:46] spirit in the church and being baptized
[1:15:48] with the Holy Ghost in the church. But
[1:15:50] what about being baptized with the Holy
[1:15:52] Ghost in our marriage?
[1:15:55] Because we heard about it on Sunday,
[1:15:56] brothers and sisters, the life that we
[1:15:58] live in the marriage that we represent
[1:16:00] here is a direct reflection of our
[1:16:02] relationship with him up there.
[1:16:04] And when we get out of our lane down
[1:16:07] here, we're actually getting out of our
[1:16:09] lane up there. Now, some would say,
[1:16:12] well, the word of God says that I can
[1:16:14] never be lost because I'm forained
[1:16:15] before the foundation of the world,
[1:16:17] predestinated unto adoption, which
[1:16:19] indeed truly I believe every one of us
[1:16:22] are. And that's why every one of us
[1:16:23] align with the word every single time we
[1:16:26] hear about it. And you know, we get out
[1:16:28] of line. Who's going to raise their hand
[1:16:30] here tonight and say, "Brother Barry,
[1:16:31] I've never gotten out of line of the
[1:16:33] word. I've never ever been out of line
[1:16:35] as a husband. I've never ever been out
[1:16:37] of line as a wife. I've never ever been
[1:16:39] out of line as a brother or a sister.
[1:16:41] I've never been out of line as a deacon.
[1:16:43] I've never been out of line as a song
[1:16:45] leader or a pastor or or an evangelist.
[1:16:48] I've never been out of line. We would
[1:16:50] all be liars, wouldn't we?
[1:16:52] We would all be liars. Every one of us
[1:16:55] gets out of line. But what brings us
[1:16:57] back into line is our ability to say the
[1:17:00] word is the absolute
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; and be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we've talked about it in the
[1:17:10] past and we were getting into it in the
[1:17:11] truck. I just love those conversations
[1:17:13] going down the highway as you're
[1:17:15] cruising down the road.
[1:17:17] But you know,
[1:17:22] unfortunately or fortunately, depending
[1:17:24] on how you look at it, you can see the
[1:17:26] spirit that's in people. You can see it
[1:17:28] loud and clear. And you know how you can
[1:17:32] see it is when correction by the word is
[1:17:34] brought.
[1:17:36] When correction by the word is brought,
[1:17:38] the reaction of the people, it shows
[1:17:41] who's on the inside.
[1:17:44] Who's your daddy? Who's your father?
[1:17:47] or maybe not who is your father, but who
[1:17:50] is influencing you right now? Who is
[1:17:53] influencing you right now? I I'll
[1:17:54] correct myself. I stand corrected. Who
[1:17:56] is influencing you right now? Because we
[1:17:58] can be saved and filled with the Holy
[1:18:00] Ghost and still be influenced the wrong
[1:18:02] way, brothers and sisters. We can still
[1:18:04] have our feelings hurt and allow those
[1:18:07] feelings to override us. My, now we're
[1:18:09] getting into something. You know, uh we
[1:18:11] are talking about this and I think it's
[1:18:12] so good. Brothers and sisters, one of
[1:18:14] the worst things that can be in our
[1:18:17] lives, one of the worst things that can
[1:18:19] hinder our spiritual walk is
[1:18:21] unforgiveness.
[1:18:24] And you know, if we say that we've
[1:18:25] forgiven brother so and so or sister so
[1:18:27] and so or parent so and so or daughter
[1:18:29] so and so or whoever, if we've forgiven
[1:18:32] them, but we just can't stop talking
[1:18:34] about it, I guarantee you, you have not
[1:18:36] forgiven them.
[1:18:39] You have not forgiven them. Because if
[1:18:40] you've forgiven them, you'll stop
[1:18:42] talking about it. You won't bring it up
[1:18:45] again. Especially in a marriage. When
[1:18:48] you do that in a marriage, your marriage
[1:18:50] is doomed. Your marriage is doomed. Mark
[1:18:53] my words on that. If you keep bringing
[1:18:55] up the past, bringing up the past,
[1:18:57] digging up bones, then your marriage is
[1:18:59] doomed. It will not last. And don't
[1:19:01] think for a second because you're in the
[1:19:03] message, because you go to Calgary
[1:19:05] Living Word that your marriage is exempt
[1:19:07] from divorce. Now, I'm not preaching
[1:19:09] this because I'm promoting it. And I'm
[1:19:10] preaching it as a warning. I'm preaching
[1:19:12] it to say, brothers and sisters, we
[1:19:13] heard brother Joel Galat say it that
[1:19:15] Adam thought his religion would save his
[1:19:18] relationship.
[1:19:20] Don't think the cloak of the message is
[1:19:21] going to save you from a divorce. The
[1:19:24] only thing that will save you from a
[1:19:25] divorce is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:28] in your marriage.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And if you're in a marriage and you
[1:19:31] don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:32] Ghost, I want to say tonight, there's a
[1:19:34] pool downstairs right now that can be
[1:19:37] used.
[1:19:38] Don't go another step without it.
[1:19:46] But to think that, you know, I just
[1:19:48] can't forget. I can pull up quotes out
[1:19:50] of the message. Brother Brandham says we
[1:19:52] can forgive, but you know, we just can't
[1:19:54] forget because we're humans.
[1:19:57] Nope, you can't. But I can tell you by
[1:20:00] experience. Now, people might get upset
[1:20:02] with me and by all means approach me,
[1:20:04] send me a note or whatever, a text or
[1:20:08] whatever. You can choose to. You can
[1:20:12] choose to forget
[1:20:15] because the word of God says to take how
[1:20:17] many thoughts into captivity?
[1:20:20] All of them.
[1:20:22] So when the devil comes around with a
[1:20:24] bag full of bad memories and says,
[1:20:26] "Don't you remember these bad memories
[1:20:28] about this person that's talking to you
[1:20:30] bad right now? Don't you remember those
[1:20:32] hundreds of times that they've talked
[1:20:33] bad to you, shaking and rattling those
[1:20:35] bad memories?" You can choose to take
[1:20:38] that jar and start digging in there and
[1:20:40] pulling out bad memories. Or you can
[1:20:42] smash that jar and say, "Satan, I rebuke
[1:20:45] you in the name of Jesus Christ. That is
[1:20:47] my wife. That is my husband. That is my
[1:20:50] son. That is my daughter. and I will not
[1:20:52] allow you to have power over any of us
[1:20:55] any longer
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; We have the choice. We can choose to
[1:21:02] say, "I no longer desire to bring up
[1:21:05] those memories." And you can ask God.
[1:21:09] Ask me and I'll tell you. Ask him and
[1:21:11] he'll show you. Please, Lord, take those
[1:21:14] memories away.
[1:21:18] Take those memories and throw them in
[1:21:20] the exact same place that you throw my
[1:21:22] sin.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Take those memories and throw them
[1:21:28] there. And you know what? He will.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; There'll come a time where Satan will
[1:21:34] come around and try and rattle that jar,
[1:21:36] rattle that bag of memories, and you'll
[1:21:38] be like, "What is that awful sound? Man,
[1:21:41] I hate that sound." And and you'll just
[1:21:44] carry on with your life. It'll just be
[1:21:46] like a fly buzzing around. You'll just
[1:21:48] be like, "Get lost. Get out of here. You
[1:21:50] won't entertain it at all." But as long
[1:21:52] as you entertain it, it's going to keep
[1:21:54] coming around.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You know, it's the worst thing, brothers
[1:21:58] and sisters, is unforgiveness.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Unforgiveness will kill you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; It will kill you physically and it will
[1:22:05] kill you spiritually. Unforgiveness, my
[1:22:09] old pastor, he used to say it. It's just
[1:22:11] like taking poison. I'm gonna take this
[1:22:14] vial of poison and I'm gonna wait for it
[1:22:17] to take effect on the person that I've
[1:22:19] unforgiven that I have not forgiven.
[1:22:23] It's just going to destroy us. That's
[1:22:25] all.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; And it's going to make the other people
[1:22:27] that are around you miserable because
[1:22:29] you can't hide your misery.
[1:22:32] But my when the spirit of him comes into
[1:22:35] our life
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and helps us align with his word.
[1:22:39] Brothers and sisters, we all need help
[1:22:41] to align with his word.
[1:22:43] There's none of us that's exempt that
[1:22:45] doesn't need help to align with his
[1:22:47] word. I need help to align with his word
[1:22:49] every day of my life.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; But when his spirit comes into us, when
[1:22:56] it's the spirit of him, then it's going
[1:22:58] to be a lively church. And I just can't
[1:23:00] help but think it's going to be a lively
[1:23:01] marriage.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Husband's just going to love his wife.
[1:23:05] And because he loves his wife, she's
[1:23:06] going to reverence him. And and because
[1:23:08] she reverences him, he's going to love
[1:23:10] her more. And and the more he loves on
[1:23:12] her, the more she's going to reverence
[1:23:14] him. And and the more that happens, the
[1:23:16] more the kids are going to say, "Man, I
[1:23:17] just honor my parents. They just love
[1:23:19] each other so much." It just makes
[1:23:21] children so upset when parents bicker
[1:23:23] and fight.
[1:23:25] [Laughter]
[1:23:27] Come on, be honest.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; I know there's some marriages here that
[1:23:30] would say, "We never bicker and fight,
[1:23:31] Brother Barry." And I I have to say,
[1:23:33] "Wow." Okay. I I don't know. I don't
[1:23:36] know. Okay. All right.
[1:23:40] But maybe we just disagree.
[1:23:43] Sometimes there's tension and children
[1:23:44] pick it up.
[1:23:46] But I can't help but think this tonight
[1:23:49] that his people, a lively people, a
[1:23:52] lively church, a lively marriage filled
[1:23:54] with the spirit, all of his gifts and
[1:23:58] wonders working perfectly in the body.
[1:24:01] So, brothers and sisters, I just had
[1:24:03] this desire in in my heart as I was
[1:24:05] studying this, as I was contemplating
[1:24:08] what maybe we would talk about tonight.
[1:24:09] What's your need tonight?
[1:24:12] What's your need tonight? Every one of
[1:24:14] us has a need.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; He's more than able to meet our needs,
[1:24:18] brothers and sisters.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; If you have a need and he hasn't met it
[1:24:22] in your life thus far, I would say stop
[1:24:26] doing things the way that you're doing
[1:24:27] them. Change the way that you're doing
[1:24:30] things. Change it up, man. To continue
[1:24:33] doing the same thing over and over again
[1:24:36] and hope that you're going to see a
[1:24:38] different result is the definition of
[1:24:40] what?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Insanity.
[1:24:43] And that's not just a message term.
[1:24:46] That's natural understanding.
[1:24:49] How much more spiritually speaking with
[1:24:51] his spirit in our lives? If we have a
[1:24:54] need, he's more than able to meet it.
[1:24:56] Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He's more than able to meet it. And I
[1:24:59] want to say this, we've got a little bit
[1:25:00] of a
[1:25:02] we have a little bit of a a testimony
[1:25:05] that we can say. Something happens when
[1:25:08] we have prayer meeting here.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Some people would say, "Brother Barry,
[1:25:11] we have enough church. Oh my, we have
[1:25:13] two services a week and just no way that
[1:25:15] we can schedule anything more in our
[1:25:17] lives. We're so busy with all that we
[1:25:19] do." And I know what it means to be
[1:25:20] busy, brothers and sisters. Don't get me
[1:25:22] wrong. I'm not mocking it and I'm not
[1:25:23] slamming it. But what I am saying is if
[1:25:25] you got a need, why aren't you here? Why
[1:25:28] aren't you in a prayer meeting? Give God
[1:25:31] a little bit more to honor and see if he
[1:25:33] won't come on the scene and honor it.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Reschedu things. Say, you know what? The
[1:25:39] most important thing for me in my house
[1:25:40] is that we'll serve the Lord.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; And I believe that the spirit of him
[1:25:46] that was in all of those other people
[1:25:48] that we heard about tonight is in me.
[1:25:52] see if he won't come on the scene,
[1:25:54] brothers and sisters.
[1:25:56] It is the rising of the sun. As we wrap
[1:25:59] up tonight,
[1:26:02] brother Brandham, he says, "And as he
[1:26:05] being the groom,
[1:26:08] the bride has to come forth
[1:26:10] because it's part of him.
[1:26:13] It's not just someone else."
[1:26:16] It's so beautiful the way he says it in
[1:26:18] here.
[1:26:20] It's part of him
[1:26:22] and it can only be the manifestation
[1:26:25] of the fulfilling
[1:26:28] of all the revelations
[1:26:31] any others has spoke of the bride.
[1:26:36] If you think about that for a second,
[1:26:38] just it can only be the manifestation of
[1:26:41] the fulfilling
[1:26:43] of all the revelations
[1:26:47] that's ever been spoke of the bride. It
[1:26:50] can only manifest.
[1:26:54] This is where I think this is the crux
[1:26:56] of the message right here, brothers and
[1:26:57] sisters. If it does something different
[1:26:59] from the groom, it ain't the bride.
[1:27:04] Now, Brother Random says it isn't the
[1:27:06] bride. Brother Barry says it ain't the
[1:27:08] bride.
[1:27:10] If it does anything different than the
[1:27:12] groom, it isn't the bride.
[1:27:16] So, I think it's time that maybe we
[1:27:18] ought to just step back and take a look
[1:27:20] at it and say, "What's going on in my
[1:27:22] life? Is my life lining up to
[1:27:26] the groom?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Is my life lined up to the groom?" I can
[1:27:32] say, brothers and sisters, my life can
[1:27:33] line up better to the groom. Can yours?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Does our life line up to the groom? If
[1:27:40] it doesn't line up to the groom, then we
[1:27:41] ain't the bride.
[1:27:46] And you know, the word of God says that
[1:27:48] for some people it would have been
[1:27:49] better that they didn't even know
[1:27:55] than to pretend
[1:27:57] and carry on and receive the blessing of
[1:28:01] the Holy Ghost in the church with all
[1:28:03] the other people that truly live the
[1:28:05] life.
[1:28:07] But brothers and sisters, I'm not saying
[1:28:09] that no, nobody here doesn't live the
[1:28:11] life. I'm just saying this is what the
[1:28:13] prophet said about this life. If it does
[1:28:16] something different from the groom,
[1:28:20] it isn't the bride.
[1:28:23] She is flesh of his flesh. Bone of his
[1:28:26] bone. Life of his life. Power of his
[1:28:30] power.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:42] Isn't it interesting that at the end of
[1:28:45] the message of the vindicated prophet in
[1:28:47] 1965, after all of the messages, after
[1:28:50] all of the goings around of the world,
[1:28:53] all of the campaigns, all of the healing
[1:28:55] lines, all of the discernments, all of
[1:28:57] the third pole manifestations,
[1:28:59] everything, the full culmination of this
[1:29:02] prophet's message,
[1:29:04] he's talking about she being he.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Take a look at this world around. Why
[1:29:10] are these people behaving the way they
[1:29:11] are? Well, it would have to be in a
[1:29:13] Sodom condition. Yeah, it does. Isn't it
[1:29:16] interesting?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; People are all mixed up thinking that
[1:29:19] they're supposed to be another gender
[1:29:22] when really they're supposed to be the
[1:29:24] bride.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:29:30] But the devil can't create. So, what
[1:29:32] does he do? He perverts.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Takes people and gets them to think that
[1:29:36] they should be something that they're
[1:29:37] not.
[1:29:39] But if we would just allow the spirit of
[1:29:41] him to come inside of us, it would
[1:29:43] quicken us to his word. And we would
[1:29:46] understand what this means. That if it
[1:29:48] does something different from the groom,
[1:29:50] if it does something different from the
[1:29:51] word, if it does something different
[1:29:53] from the word of a vindicated prophet,
[1:29:54] which is the word of God, it isn't the
[1:29:57] bride because she is flesh of his flesh,
[1:29:59] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[1:30:01] power of his power. She is him. It's the
[1:30:04] same in a marriage.
[1:30:06] The wife is going to do everything the
[1:30:08] husband wants. And if she doesn't, she
[1:30:11] is not part of him.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; She can say that she is all she wants,
[1:30:17] but her actions, her life demonstrates
[1:30:20] otherwise.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Same thing with a husband.
[1:30:25] If a husband has a wife and claims
[1:30:28] that's his wife, I have ownership of
[1:30:30] her, but boy, I just don't love her and
[1:30:33] I just don't treat her right. My actions
[1:30:36] are that I would rather be somewhere
[1:30:37] else than with her.
[1:30:40] What kind of an action is that? What
[1:30:42] kind of a life is that? What kind of a
[1:30:44] display is that? It's something
[1:30:46] different than the word.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Something different. And they would say,
[1:30:51] "He's definitely not part of her." But
[1:30:54] boy, when the two become one,
[1:30:58] when the two want to follow the word of
[1:31:00] God, when the two just want to stay in
[1:31:02] their lane, when the husband says, "I
[1:31:04] don't I don't care. I'm not going to
[1:31:05] make excuses. I know that I've made so
[1:31:06] many mistakes along the way, but I still
[1:31:08] have time. I still have breath in my
[1:31:09] lungs, and she still has breath in her
[1:31:11] lungs. I'm going to make it better in my
[1:31:13] life, in my marriage. I just want to
[1:31:15] try." How many people after the service
[1:31:17] on Wednesday on Sunday didn't want to go
[1:31:19] home, those people that are married, and
[1:31:21] just try a little harder in your
[1:31:22] marriage? It made me want to just try
[1:31:24] and be a better husband to my wife.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And I can guarantee you it makes the
[1:31:30] wives want to be a better wife to their
[1:31:32] husband.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; When you hear the word that way, who
[1:31:35] wouldn't want to stay in their lane? Who
[1:31:37] wouldn't want to stay in the word of God
[1:31:39] in their position after that? My
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; she is him as a man and woman are one
[1:31:47] and a woman taken from his side. She had
[1:31:50] taken a spirit,
[1:31:53] the feminist spirit from him, the flesh
[1:31:56] from his side. Ma made made both
[1:31:58] mechanics and dynamics.
[1:32:01] The wife, the spirit of him and the
[1:32:06] flesh of him and put it together and
[1:32:10] made mechan mechanics and dynamics.
[1:32:16] And it is until the church or the
[1:32:18] people, brother Bradom says it is the
[1:32:20] rising of the sun. It's the spirit of
[1:32:23] him lives in us. It's going to quicken
[1:32:25] our mortal bodies to the word of God.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; We're not going to just make excuses and
[1:32:29] say that it's okay for it to be the way
[1:32:31] that it's always been because that's all
[1:32:33] it will ever be. What we're doing at
[1:32:35] that point is limiting the power of God.
[1:32:38] Who would want to limit the power of
[1:32:40] God? Who would want to, I'll say it this
[1:32:43] way, dumb down the power of God to say
[1:32:45] that I'm I am the way that I am because
[1:32:47] of the generational curses in my family.
[1:32:50] I am the way that I am because of the
[1:32:52] genetics in my family. What we're doing
[1:32:55] is saying that God is not able to
[1:32:57] deliver us from any of the afflictions
[1:33:00] in our lives. You know, when we talk
[1:33:02] about generational curses, and I'll say
[1:33:04] this, the the genetics
[1:33:07] can be the generational curses.
[1:33:10] Don't think for a second that they're
[1:33:12] not. Now, this could open a whole can of
[1:33:14] worms, but I'm I welcome it. Let's talk
[1:33:16] about it. What we do is we say that God
[1:33:19] is not able to deliver us,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; We take that away from God and say, "No,
[1:33:25] that is actually more powerful than the
[1:33:26] God that I serve."
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Let's not do that. Let's say that the
[1:33:30] God that I serve is more powerful than
[1:33:33] any force in this world. We know that
[1:33:35] the word of God says that he would
[1:33:37] actually visit what is it? the
[1:33:39] iniquities of the fathers upon the
[1:33:41] children to the third and the fourth
[1:33:42] generation, not to those that love him,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; to those that hate him.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And as believers, do we hate him?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So, how can we dare say that we've got a
[1:33:54] curse?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians. We serve a
[1:33:59] mighty God, brothers and sisters.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Don't give the devil any credit.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Doubt your doubts.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Give God the glory. Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Take the word of God and say, "It's my
[1:34:11] absolute." And not just say it's my
[1:34:12] absolute, but make it your absolute.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; If you have troubles in your marriage,
[1:34:18] examine your life. Don't examine your
[1:34:23] spouse's wife life.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Your spouse shouldn't have a wife.
[1:34:30] Just examine your own life. Take a look
[1:34:32] in the mirror of God's word and say, "Do
[1:34:34] I line up with that word?" because if I
[1:34:37] don't, then I need to.
[1:34:40] It's pretty easy to put it off on
[1:34:42] someone else. But it's all about this
[1:34:46] introspection.
[1:34:48] Inspect me from the inside. Create in me
[1:34:51] a clean heart, Lord, and renew a what? A
[1:34:55] right spirit within me.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me tonight as we close.
[1:35:03] Just like to thank the brothers for
[1:35:05] stepping in. Brother Emanuel is going to
[1:35:07] take the service this Sunday. We're
[1:35:09] going to be away again. Just going to
[1:35:11] have a little time with the family and
[1:35:13] certainly thankful that we're able to do
[1:35:15] it. You know, as parents, we only get so
[1:35:18] many summers with our children and uh
[1:35:21] I'm certainly thankful that we have the
[1:35:23] opportunity to spend some time.
[1:35:27] God, richly bless you tonight. Let's
[1:35:28] just pray.
[1:35:30] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, tonight we
[1:35:32] just are so thankful for your spirit.
[1:35:35] Lord, we're so thankful that we have had
[1:35:39] a personal introduction, Lord Jesus, to
[1:35:41] your spirit. That we understand full
[1:35:43] well that it's not something intangible.
[1:35:46] It's not one of many spirits. That truly
[1:35:49] you are the person of Jesus Christ. You
[1:35:52] chose to manifest yourself to the human
[1:35:54] race in Jesus Christ, the mighty
[1:35:57] Jehovah, the one who framed the
[1:35:59] universe, who who put the foundations of
[1:36:02] the world together, the one who spoke to
[1:36:05] Job out of the whirlwind and asked him
[1:36:07] to declare, "Who is it that strang, oh
[1:36:11] Lord Jesus, that laid the foundations of
[1:36:15] the earth?"
[1:36:17] To declare, "Oh, who is that one?"
[1:36:20] Father, we know that we can talk to you.
[1:36:23] We can talk to that one that that Job
[1:36:25] spoke to out of the whirlwind
[1:36:28] that Moses met on top of the mountain.
[1:36:31] Father, that one that spoke and said,
[1:36:35] "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him."
[1:36:38] Thank you,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Tonight, if we have made
[1:36:44] this gospel anything other than what it
[1:36:47] is truly the coming of the person of
[1:36:51] Jesus Christ,
[1:36:54] Father, we ask that you would forgive us
[1:36:55] for it, Lord. Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; And we ask that Lord Jesus, maybe for
[1:37:00] some people, maybe not for everyone,
[1:37:03] maybe just for one, maybe just for two,
[1:37:05] maybe for some, Lord Jesus, that we have
[1:37:08] lived this message in such a way that
[1:37:10] it's just never brought the right
[1:37:12] results for us in our life. And Lord, we
[1:37:15] know that somewhere in there, there is a
[1:37:17] a cycle of blessing in a in our lives.
[1:37:21] if we could ever just align ourselves
[1:37:23] just right, Father. I pray that tonight
[1:37:25] you would allow ourselves to align
[1:37:27] ourselves, Father, with your word, Lord,
[1:37:30] that we could see a cycle of blessing,
[1:37:33] maybe like we've never experienced
[1:37:34] before, Lord. Oh father, not just with
[1:37:37] money and and with with things in this
[1:37:39] world, materialism, Father, but with the
[1:37:41] revelation of this word, Lord, to be
[1:37:44] able to not be proud, oh Father, but to
[1:37:46] humble ourselves in the sight of God,
[1:37:49] Lord, to submit ourselves one to another
[1:37:52] in the fear of God. to allow that spirit
[1:37:55] that we're talking about to permeate
[1:37:58] every area of our lives, Lord, not to
[1:38:01] think that we're right and everyone else
[1:38:04] is wrong. Father, Lord, we're so
[1:38:07] thankful that you spoke to us through
[1:38:08] your prophet and said that true
[1:38:10] revelation never pops up.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; But it causes a humility
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; with agape love. Yes, Lord.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just ask that you
[1:38:22] would keep your hand upon us, Lord.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; That you would just make yourself so
[1:38:26] real to us, Lord.
[1:38:29] Father, as we go our separate ways, I
[1:38:31] pray that you would keep your hand upon
[1:38:32] us. That you would just be with us,
[1:38:35] Father, every step of the way.
[1:38:38] And Lord, I thank you for the brethren,
[1:38:40] Lord, willing to put their shoulders to
[1:38:42] the wheel here on the body and the
[1:38:44] offices of the church. Lord, the
[1:38:47] ministers in the church, Lord. Thank you
[1:38:50] for the brothers taking the word to
[1:38:52] Lebridge, Lord. Father, we pray that you
[1:38:55] would just continue to bless them and
[1:38:56] the work that you're doing through them
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; tonight. We love you, Lord, and we thank
[1:39:01] you. We pray that you would be with
[1:39:03] those who couldn't be here wherever they
[1:39:05] are for whatever reason. Lord,
[1:39:08] if it be your will for us to meet again
[1:39:10] on Sunday, we just will be careful to
[1:39:12] give you praise.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Just ask all these things in Jesus
[1:39:16] Christ's name we pray.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:22] Amen.
[1:39:26] If the same spirit
[1:39:29] that raised Christ from the dead
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; dwells in you. If the same spirit that
[1:39:38] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:39:43] dwell in you.
[1:39:46] If the same
[1:39:49] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:39:52] dwell in you,
[1:39:56] dwell in you.
[1:39:59] It will quicken
[1:40:01] your mortal body.
[1:40:05] If that spirit
[1:40:08] dwells in you,
[1:40:12] it shall quicken
[1:40:14] your mortal body.
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:18] If that spirit
[1:40:20] dwells in you,
[1:40:24] if the same
[1:40:26] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:40:30] dwells in you,
[1:40:33] dwells in you.
[1:40:36] Him that same
[1:40:38] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:40:42] dwells in you.
[1:40:45] Dwells in you.
[1:40:48] It shall quicken
[1:40:51] your mortal body.
[1:40:55] That spirit
[1:40:58] dwells in you.
[1:41:01] It shall quicken.
[1:41:03] Your mortal body
[1:41:07] in that spirit
[1:41:10] dwells in you.
[1:41:13] Can we sing the potter's hand tonight?
[1:41:16] Beautiful
[1:41:17] Lord,
[1:41:19] wonderful Savior.
[1:41:22] Beautiful Lord,
[1:41:25] wonderful Savior.
[1:41:28] I know for sure
[1:41:31] that all of my days are held in your
[1:41:36] hands.
[1:41:38] They're crafted into
[1:41:41] your perfect
[1:41:45] plan.
[1:41:49] You can be calling
[1:41:52] into your presence,
[1:41:55] guiding me by
[1:41:59] your Holy Spirit.
[1:42:02] Teach me, dear Lord,
[1:42:05] to live all my life
