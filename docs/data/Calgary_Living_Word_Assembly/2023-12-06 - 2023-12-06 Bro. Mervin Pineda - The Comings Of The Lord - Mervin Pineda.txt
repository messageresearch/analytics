life I haven't talked to or seen this gentleman for probably just about 20 plus years and there's a great transformation that he's witnessed and he said that he wants to participate he wants to come to church he wants to get to know the God that I know and to me that's astounding because it's my past that I'm not proud of that I but if he wants to get to know the God that I know I want him to

gather here like this God is so good gracious to us he still allows us to gather uh and you know where two or three are gathered in his name he's in the midst we know that amen and uh yeah maybe before we read the scripture maybe uh we can can have a word of prayer oh Lord Jesus we're so thankful unto you Lord you have given us all things you revealed yourself to us oh Lord by Your Word oh

one that will speak speak through me oh Lord this lips of playay Lord this just I Surrender it unto you Lord you be in control of all things have preeminence now from the beginning to the end Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you musician musicians uh I'll just try uh so so yeah let's uh read and then I'll explain after the this presentation I don't know if it will work okay so let's uh read two scriptures and then I'll let you see Malachi 41 to3 I think it's okay you don't need to turn over there because uh we have only an hour so I'll try to not to hold you like Pharaoh uh I will release you early so Malachi 41 and3 for behold the day cometh amen that shall burn as an oven amen and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubbled and the day that cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither Ruth nor Branch verse two but to you amen who's that you that's you and me amen that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings amen and ye shall go forth and grow up up as culbs of the stall amen a special location culbs of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked they they shall be a for they shall be ashes under the Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this said the Lord of hosts we will place this later on in a timeline but then let's read another scripture here which is uh another end time uh scripture here second Peter 3 11-13 seeing then that all these things it's saying all these things shall be dissolved and what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the Heaven's being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we amen you and me again according to his promise and what's that promise where can we find that promise in the word amen look for new heavens and new earth yes where where IND dwelleth righteousness amen may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated so I am I'm debating with the title because the thing is you can put a lot of titles in this uh message because it's the whole thing so it's the message in a nutshell you can say that's why I'll try it message in one hour because it's uh it's Wednesday but uh I know barbaric can take over or other ministers but I'll just uh highlight the points uh so I entitled this actually the comings of the Lord why comings because Jesus came in three times right and then we'll uh we'll put them in a timeline so that at least we we can have visuals and we know one one picture paints a thousand words right so you can it means it means you can talk 1,000 words but then with one picture it will it will be equivalent so I'll I'll I'll try to not to speak more but I'll I'll try to uh put into uh layout so that we can see where we are right now we know we're end time message Believers amen oh by the way I want to acknowledge the presence of uh brother Ariel uh Ariel deuz is my massage therapist and uh we just invited him and he's uh here tonight and praise the Lord uh and who knows that uh he can uh be a a beneficiary we know it's the word of God so everyone if we believe the Bible right and and and the the word of God is the absolute it's not the man that is absolute it's the word through the man that is a prophet that is absolute it's the word of God Amen so yeah welcome uh brother Ariel amen so just a preview I know I I've been telling Barberry I I might repeat some slides but then the thing is because the message is Rich you cannot preach it at one time but then you have to go back and then Zoom this is a zoom out uh portion but then we can zoom in tonight also so just for those who haven't seen this presentation you can see uh where is the it's from eternity to Eternity right so you can see here eternity what is eternity it means no no beginning no end but when did Time start it's when God started to speak Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us at the same time Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created heaven and Earth but then the thing the thing here is in creation you can see Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created heaven and earth BR Branham is saying that's period and then between 1 one and one two could be millions of years ions of years we don't know amen but then the thing is uh the point here is I'm just trying to put it maybe in a five minute overview so that we can go with the topic so that we know where we are right now we believe that we are at the end because of the signs and because of the calendar and because of what's happening to the Jews amen so after creation it's Adam and then after Adam it's Noah and then Jesus Christ and today if you can see every 2,000 years there's a big milestone that happens in the time of Adam you can see here the the Earth before the fall it's perfect although they're created they were not supposed to die amen because he's a spoken word creation Adam is he he he was not supposed to fall but then our creation right now is through the union of a a man and a woman which is already a perver perverted creation that's not the original plan of God it's supposed to be a spoken word word but then we know that God has attributes that he wanted to uh to accomplish or manifest in his life or or in his being God that's why he allowed all these things it might not be the perfect will it is his permissive will but which will accomplish his perfect will amen amen so everything happens for a reason amen and everything will manifest according to the word of God Amen he has the different attributes he wanted to be a God so he and God is an object of worship so he must someone must worship Him and at first baram said he created angels first to worship him otherwise he cannot be God by him alone as Elohim amen so anyway so you can see the the Milestones that I want to run through as I I've said this just like a table of contest of time it's just like flying over Canada from east to west if you if you if you try that in Vancouver you will see on top from East uh the maritimes up to West over over BC but uh I I want you to be with me and then we will fly over time amen from eternity to Eternity and then this called time element is where we are right now amen so you can see from Adam to Noah is 2,000 years approximately okay so there's no exact dates but uh you you can study the Bible and then you will find out that the the flood happened in 2 348 BC okay uh we don't have time to prove it here but I believe you you believe the message of the hour and also those who already did the timelines like uh Bishop Asher who did this whole entire Ministry putting all the dates and bar branam also quoted Bishop Asher for those dates amen and that's why we're putting here it's again it has been preached last time we don't have our own thoughts our own mind we Just Surrender ourselves and then we'll put all the good things together so that they will become alive right amen so from Noah to Adam and then Jesus Christ from Noah is another 2,000 years and today is 2023 so if you if you do the math again another 2,000 years right and then beyond there we will go Millennium but then before that you can see in Adam's time it's almost perfect until the fall but after the fall then then comes death amen that's so so you can see here the the fall of Man in Genesis 2 and3 Adam set Cain and then from set you will see Cain he's a hybrid because he's a mixture right he's a mix of uh of the serpent and Eve amen and uh you can see Seth I didn't put Abel here because he was slain by Cain but all the uh the lineage of set up to Noah bar banam is saying that uh they are perfect sons of God it means they're sons of God the last Son of God is Noah but the Cain's uh uh offsprings they are mixture in Genesis 6 so actually Noah married from uh the daughters of men that's why all the sons of Noah they are hybrid also they have that uh uh uh Serpent's blood in them they're not Ser you can say for us uh we have the Serpent's blood in us because we're mixed already because all of mankind came from the the three sons of Noah amen because the as far as we can see there are only eight Souls that were that were left after the flood but even before that though we know that no uh Enoch was a type of the Bride he was raptured he didn't he was not dead amen he he he didn't die so quick one so the the hearts of uh the people in Noah's in Noah's time were continually evil that's why God even repented in creating man so he sent the flood you can see the flood there so it's approximately 2,000 hours uh 2,000 years so that's the first Milestone that we know that's why we we always say 6,000 years ago or 4,000 years ago this is from today is 4,000 years ago that's Noah amen and then what happened to to Noah after that it came Abraham and then Abraham begat Isaac the promised son and then Esau and Jacob Jacob became Israel and then the the the Ten Commandments and that's the law basically it's in Exodus 20 amen I'm I'm trying to rush so that at least we can go with the with our topic basically and then come Jesus Christ which is the shedding of blood here it's water but Jesus Christ shed his blood and amen for our salvation for our Redemption amen and and the exact date uh I mean approximate the date of uh the death of Jesus Christ is 33 ad but you can see here in between Jesus Christ and Noah is about 2,000 uh 2,000 years and then today so you can see the the progression from white to become darken darker and dark darker because the condition of time right now you as you can see what we're seeing out there is totally almost black out there's no more God out there amen it's only the only thing that uh God is Not uh uh he repented by the way and then he said I will not uh by the rainbow the Covenant he said he will not uh uh uh make this world perish Again by water but he didn't he promised it not by water but he will do it by fire amen still because of what man is uh uh status right now it's still continually evil amen so that is today so it means it's another 2,000 years so what are we waiting for in this age right now is baptism of fire right so you can see it's the spirit which is fire before we cross over to the 10,000 years of Peace there there's a lot of uh details here which we will tackle I hope I I will be able to to do it amen so you can see between Noah and Jesus Christ the only way you can be saved although you will not be raptured is following the law right the sacrifice amen sacrifice of bulls and goats but who can who can be perfect no one there's because an animal can cannot be a perfect sacrifice amen so that's why they waited for Jesus Christ to be uh crucified and you can see the last one that went with him is the thief on the cross right remember that one is uh he is the one the last predestinated SE for the Old Testament they've been waiting for him to accept Jesus Christ so that they can all be raptured amen imagine that a thief yeah it's it's it's kind of powerful on that on that perspective if we will see it because the thing is it's the same same for us right now until we see the last predestinated seed whether he will be the chiefest of Sinner chiefest of Sinners Like Me and some of you maybe because you might claim that you you don't sin but for me I claim I'm a sinner I'm just saved by grace amen so until we find that and it's also preached last Sunday that uh the thing is the good thing is uh we cannot all be divided it's even in the message that everyone must collaborate so that the third pool will manifest it's so important that's why we cannot forsake even the assembling of ourselves as we see the day approaching because uh it's very important actually I was supposed to to put a video so that at least there will be an intermission for the younger ones but I will just uh I will just uh uh narrate it I hope it's about the elephants protecting their calvs so basically if you see against the Lions basically think of the Lions as the as Satan and and your parents as the older elephants and you are the Cal right this is for the young people but I will I'll tackle the older people after but uh uh so the younger Cals if they you can see how how Satan is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may thear you know how he attacks he will attack when the Cal is isolated right when he's away from the parents and remember the parents remember until you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost your parents are your Holy Ghost amen so you see how the elephants will work out against the lion they will form almost a circle and the CBS are in the middle so imagine that as with the older elephants full of Faith Believers when they are around the calvs then the lion cannot attack so you see it's the same so don't be isolated amen but sometimes also with the older elephants if they are alone the lion can also attack and many lions will come the pride can Attack One lion so you see how important the the fellowship amen it's so important that we will not forsake that because when you're isolated that's the time the devil can come of course prayers must be between us and God but then the thing Fellowship is is sharpening iron you know iron sharpens iron we know that that's why when we Fellowship we talk about the things of God and we are after Fellowship almost we we're always pumped up amen because uh we know that's the importance of having a family of God Amen Believers of like Precious Faith together amen so it's so important that uh uh we will be together so you can see with with what we have with what we receive we know that we are at the end and that out there it's cruel amen we cannot survive by our own that's why we need each other amen amen brothers and sisters I it's not uh it's not because we we say that we're pumped up with faith we have high faith that we can just you know alone no we need each other amen and until we find that last pred predestinated seed until we all collaborate in one mind and one Accord amen with because we belong to a mystical body We Don't Belong only to CL wa Calgary Living Word no all all the church churches that believe the the Bible as the absolute the word of God as the absolute they belong to the mystical Body of Christ amen and we're so glad that uh God sent a prophet in this age so that we can uh we can understand the Bible and I will put a little bit so that that we can proceed so you can see here law right and then after that it's all by his grace through the through after he gave up The Ghost and then he he releases life and then where is that uh life now it's living in you and me in the form of the Holy Ghost amen so and we've been always talking about the Great Commission Matthew 289 and acts 238 right yes it was commiss IED to Peter in Acts 2 until they receive the uh the gift of the Holy Ghost amen but there are two here Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore preach the gospel and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit right but then in Acts 2:32 the Fulfillment of that commandment right in Matthew 28:19 it was Jesus speaking to the disciples he didn't want to say baptize in my name otherwise some M some man some men can come and then okay you can baptize in my name even Paul are you baptized in the name of Paul no right he didn't he the the Commandment is preach or or or uh baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit but those are titles and acts 238 will manifest such commandment and it we it's a fulfillment of the Commandment you think all all the apostles including Paul are wrong and can we prove that there is someone that is you know baptized uh in the name of the titles no we cannot prove that and it's even in the Bible that's why this is called Great Commission amen and that is the key right repent and be baptize if you want the Holy Ghost right then you have to be baptized fully submerged and uh until that is revealed to us you know uh because we're still alive we are not like the one uh the thief on the cross that he cannot have the chance to be baptized right because it's not the actual baptism that will that will save you right or that will give you the Holy Ghost it's the belief in Jesus Christ right it's the actual belief in the word of God which is Jesus Christ himself amen and and you can see that that's Grace and then later on we will cross over today because we're waiting for the Rapture amen after the Rapture it's peace we call it 1,000 years of Peace because why because Satan will be bound amen okay let's go so for those who haven't seen this so you can see eternity from eternity to Eternity is like a perfect circle has no beginning is has no end so when did time come time came because of sin amen and that is from start to finish you can see here this is the element of time but Jesus blood breathes the Gap right that blood will make us back to Eternity again and we're so thankful on that blood amen he's the perfect sacrifice he alone right he's no one no one is worthy except him because he's uh uh we tackle about original sin why why do we need a virgin birth why why why it has to be through a virgin because he was not conceived through the union of a man and a woman amen is a he is a spoken word creation amen and he's the only perfect sacrifice and that's the reason why the Old Testament saints were not uh able to be raptured because they were only sacrificing the blood of bulls and goats we need to sacrifice the blood of Jesus Christ himself amen so from eternity will go back to Eternity through the blood of Jesus Christ there are three comings so we're tackling now so the the subject there are three comings of Jesus Christ and it's a timeline the first one is from birth to Calvary right that is uh the purpose of his coming is to redeem his bride right and we'll support that with Coates and the second coming is to catch away his bride from Pentecost to the seven Church ages and the third coming which is at the end of all things is to reign with his bride is after the the Battle of armagedon to uh before the new Heaven and new earth I put some addition there so stay stay with me so which is good to to see that he has three comings so we know the seventh seal is the second and third coming right the seventh seal the book because it was was uh revealed in 1963 up to today it's a big timeline it's not an event it's a timeline so once we understand that it's a timeline then we know to place where to place them amen so you see here question and answers Christ comes three times amen the first time he came to redeem his church is that right the second time he comes to receive his church which is the rapture the third time he comes with his church right he come to redeem her he comes to Rapture her and be caught away in the time of plagues and so forth returns back for the Millennium amen lives through the Millennium so then we find out that the coming of Christ is in Trinity he first to redeem his bride next to receive his bride and comes next with his bride amen ask King and Queen to Reign through the Millennium you know that everything is in Trinity and we're in a trinity we have a mortal body a Celestial body body and glorified body three stages brings us back to our Perfection again like in Eden yeah we've been talking about theophany before but this is not the topic but then the thing is theophany plus mortal body it will be when you pick that up it will be glorified body and the theophan is the soul brother Ram is saying and where is God now if if your soul belongs to Christ then where is he reigning right now that's why the message is Christ in us it's living in our Soul we and the Breath of God is basically it will make us a living Soul same as what he did in with Adam but this flesh it's a mortal flesh right it's composed of 16 elements that whether we live or we die as long as the theophany that's why we have someone something uh we have a place waiting right uh it's called theophany that uh for those who already uh gun before us they are in their theophany they're waiting to pick up their mortal body wherever it's in uh in the grave or or right now for us we're still living it will be picked up and then it will become a glorified body then we will meet him in the air but you see there will be this Rapture for our age we have to wait for everyone even the sleeping Saints they have to resurrect first we have to wait for them that's why they're just waiting for the Perfection of the last predestinated seed it's so important that's why for us that's the reason why we have fivefold Ministry for there are missionaries that go to field to look for the last predestinated seat amen otherwise we'll still extend our time here amen so we don't want to expedite or something it's it's everything is in his control but then the thing is if we are uh you know not doing our job being uh being the bride of Christ who's extending the grace and mercy here in this world then we might end up with more more time amen so I think there's a work to be done amen amen so you can see so the new Heaven and new earth all right 30 minutes and we can I have yeah 40 slides I yeah reduced them to half so so we we will be finishing yeah so and I saw a new Heaven and new earth so this one is new Heaven and new earth just to show that there is a new Heaven and new earth and with timelines it's it's it's like adoption we are being placed where we are so that at least we can have an overview on on where we are and when we know where we are and where we're going it it just solidifies our faith that oh Lord thank you for your promise thank you for your election thank you for your predestination thank you for showing that this to us and we will be at rest amen so you see here even in Revelations 21 1-6 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth this is John speaking for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea you see see even even the heaven will pass away that's why where can you lay your your your faith it's in the word because the word will never pass away but Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away that's why we are being told go back to the absolute which is the word always amen it's very important that we have those foundation so that we know where we where we go amen amen and we need each other always always think about that that there's no one man ministry right we believe in the five-fold ministry and we thank the Lord that uh uh Barberry acknowledges that which is uh he's also a minister before but now he's the pastor but then there are other Ministries there are teachers there are Apostles prophets and there's a purpose we know that we heard that it's for the perfecting of the Saints edification of the body so we cannot be perfected by one man it should be the five-fold ministry amen amen so and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared us or like a bride adorned for her husband so it's a it's a you can see the New Jerusalem is like a bride adorned for her husband because it's a righteous perfect amen and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God so you can see here and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I will make things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful so you see it's the word of God it's true and faithful and they will all come to pass amen and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely amen so this is a blessed hope amen we're looking for a new Heaven and new earth we're not only looking for millennium we're new looking for new Heaven and new earth but then the thing is the bride I will tackle the classes of people after you can see we are special people amen I don't want to be uh ahead of myself the sunship of Jesus Christ so he came in three son's name the first one is son of man there are so many scriptures which we will not read but it's a prophetic uh title son of man means it's a prophet and then Son of God which is the holy ghost or Holy Spirit and then son of David in the Millennium but then brother branam made and uh put it based on scriptures that before before the Son of God and Son of of David Ministry there will be a son of man ministry again it's a prophetic Ministry meaning the word the full word will come through a prophet and then the subjects like you and me will also preach a prophetic Ministry through that Prophet right amen that's why it's so important that you can see all this there is a pattern here before the flood there was a prophet that's right and what is his name who was the prophet Before the Flood Noah that's right so Noah preached how many years 120 years thank you Elias uh he he got it because maybe if you can read so you can see Before the Flood there's a a milestone that happened so there was a prophet in the land that preached that there will be rain that there will be uh the Earth will be flooded before Jesus Christ came his first Advent first coming was there a Prophet that prepared his way is the the the man crying in the wilderness prepared the way of the Lord who is that man John the Baptist amen so two so two scriptures will blend together and make like a witness so so meaning for the third uh Milestone which is the rapture that we're we're we're we're waiting for so there should be a prophet also in the land and we know that that is brother Branham who by Vindication of what he preached there's so many Visions many miracles many healing he's the son of man or or the prophet that uh precedes the second coming or or he he's the he's the one that uh uh how do you call it uh yeah precedes the second coming of of Jesus Christ amen so there should be a prophet that's why for us we believe in a prophetic Ministry because the word comes through prophets right amen so you see here Prophet Holy Spirit and then Prophet this is a son of man ministry again prophet and then as a king so you see these are the sunship of Jesus Christ amen so there there actually three but then son of man it's just repeated here because at first when he came he's a prophet and then it was handed over to the prophet of this age and then to us right now amen that's why we still belong it's not only for br Bram son of man Ministry 1773 and 107 but also for the bride which is 10 Revelations 108 to1 amen amen this is just a a quick one so that at least we know where we are right now so you see it's a it's a timeline so that we know the importance why we believe a prophet why God sent a prophet it didn't end that way there is a purpose and there is a manifestation that's why we believe it we're not amen gble that uh that you can be baptized three times like me right I mean I was baptized three times first as a Catholic and then as a as an Evangelical and then the third in the message the right baptism you cannot be Gible if without a basis right but then the thing is you have to make your calling an election sure we have to know that we know that we know that we know amen and how would how would we know if we don't attend church how would we know if we don't read the Bible amen it's so important brothers and sisters that's why for this it's just putting things together so that we can have a a life this is life it's a positive gospel brothers and sisters it's a positive messag amen and the message is not from a man amen it's from God through a man and then how would we know that it's Vindicated you have a a written word everyone can read the Bible y but you will have a spoken word yes sir right through a prophet because not every everything that uh that is written can be of tailed like the Seven Seals you cannot even explain without the prophet right they're silent but we need a prophetic utterance we we need the prophet to to to really tell us what they are yes but how would we prove that it's true they manifest they become living word amen so that's so important and that's how to if we heard it if we want to to experience God just tell him how he wants uh how uh how we want him to you know manifest to us or or show himself to us we have different examples right Thomas is a doubting Thomas I want to put my uh my fingers on on your nails scattered hands and and feet it happened right so uh you know the the the the road to Emos the the two men they were withheld I mean Their Eyes Were withheld until they saw the breaking of the bread so what what I'm saying here is in different types or different forms if you want to seek God he will show himself to us as long as we're sincere amen and and the motive and objective is Right amen so you see this is the sunship of Jesus Christ that's the sunship but then the thing is uh it it's also backed up by coat you can see here uh okay let's see I won't read all throughout but then the thing is here just to prove that uh it was in the message so and and you you can see here in the 177 but now he is through the C to through the church age now he has been Son of God okay in the Millennium will be son of David sitting on David's throne but between this time this time we find out by scriptures he is to reveal himself as son of man a prophet so you can see that those those small words but they are proven amen and then it's a prophetic thing and and you see here the word of the Lord comes to prophets only amen so yes right we might claim that we're not prophets but we believe of the Prophet so therefore we will receive the prophet's reward we might not be preachers but we can live the life of the message then we our our our lives will be more than the preacher itself because it's a living testimony a best sermon preach Our Lives amen never to theologian amen it is to prophets and the Lord said he did nothing in his unchanging word we just talked about until first he shows His prophets amen and the end time them Seven Seals that this Bible has sealed up the Sevenfold mysteries of all Christ has to be revealed first and it can only brought be brought to a prophet we've been looking for that for years and we believe this spirit is Among Us now so we find so you see how important brothers and sisters this is precious to us amen if it if it if it didn't change your life you know I don't know because the thing is it it testimony yeah we always say it starts with a test but then once you overcome that test it's your personal testimony can they it might be similar to some but it's personal to you so if they tell me oh you you belong to a cult I don't care because it changed my life amen from mvin the old Irvin who died then now to the new mvin that still living and believing the word of God Amen and it's a change that's the greatest Miracle to every person amen is the changing from sinner conversion from sinner to Saint am and why it's important that we go back to the word lots of books can inform us but the Bible can transform us that's why the word is so important amen amen because it's the life but you cannot just read it by just reading verse to verse because this it's a mystery it's a yeah that's why Mysteries are revealed by prophets amen it's not by by theological uh seminarian uh Seminary uh education amen so the end of sun sunship of Jesus Christ so you see sunship has end BR Bram mentioned that too because son is a begotten so it has a beginning so it has an ending yes sir imagine that that's why all let's see it by scripture so that at least we can enjoy that we're we're not basing it on our own understanding so you see in 1 Corinthians 15:2 24-28 then cometh the end right when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall put down all Rule and all authority and power he will put down right now he in Authority we're always putting everything uh in his name we are doing everything in his name and we shall do everything in his name including baptism that's why it's so important everything but then remember that there's a there's a scripture that his word is above his name his word is magnified even above his name so it means the word is more absolute than his name amen so the word is the absolute what I'm saying here is he for when he shall put down all Rule and all all authority and Power for he must Reign till he had put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death let's continue for he had put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under him it is Manifest that is accepted which did put all things under him this is the key verse here and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be sub subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all so you see that's the reason why bar branam is not a Oneness right not like what this finger one it's an attribute it's it's a manifestation it's dispensation amen father son holy spirit is not three Gods it's just one God in three manifestations three dispensations so same for here you can see he will be subject to God but let's put this one also it's it's a good thing to back it up so that I'm not uh it's not coming from me on top of Mount Zion will set the lamp and the city will need no light for the lamb is the light therefore and above the lamp will be the father above the lamp will be the father which is the logos God the great light the eternal light that will shine just above the throne so you can see here let's let's just read it so at least and Jesus will not be on his father's Throne he'll be on his throne he will not be but he will be so it means he not future at that time he will be on his throne and the father will hover over the son which the father and son will be one and while they are yet speaking I'll answer before they can think I'm thinking for them that's right so is there an end for the sunship so we thought that sunship is eternal that's a doctrine of the of the other denominations that sunship is eternal no amen he started so he will end right so but he will end as God amen amen because he's God from the beginning so you can see the those are the scriptures so see we're talking about different uh things here but then the thing is there are classes of people in this world right they are summarized this way so that at least it's clear the wise virgins which is the bride second one is the foolish virgins the third is the 144,000 and the elect Jews the reprobates the borderline Believers the sheep and the goats which is the righteous and the wicked let's let's check one by one what they are of course we'll start with the bride are you bride this evening amen do we believe that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen because to qualify for a bride you you you must wear the word of righteousness completely and that will come through the prophet of this age amen amen so who are the wise virgins they are the lack of God they are God's chosen ones the predestinated seed the Bride of Jesus Christ as spoken of in Ephesians 1:44 1:4 to5 according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen how did he predestinated us how did he predestinate us because of his for knowledge right we we've been talking sister L on on on yeah sometime there and uh it was preached last Sunday and then you see how God works and then when you're talking about the Lord and then he will hear it and then it will be Vindicated you see he will choose you be before he will have a for knowledge of you so basically election or predestination comes after his forn knowledge because whom he did for know Romans 8 he predestinate whom he predestinate he called whom he called he justified whom he justified them he also glorified you see the sequence there right it's not it's not coincidence there there's a reason for it it amen so that's the bride the elect if you are a fish you're a fish that's right you cannot be a a spider but then the thing is our our our uh our work here on Earth is to look for the fish not to clean it cleaning is by the holy spirit amen by the washing of the Water by the word amen through how how through preaching still true man but we're not the one who will oh you do this you do that it's not by law but by his grace alone amen because the law 99% uh uh concurrent oh I mean uh if you follow the law 99% with 1% uh mistake you're still a sinner in the in the End Amen it's just like uh doubt and Faith right 90 99% Faith but 1% doubt it's still unbelief so it means it must be 100% the mark which is preached by by Barbarian bar Gilbert the 100% Mark different tests but same mark it must be 100% amen because we we can God will not give us something that we cannot uh overcome that's why we're called Overcomers right and it depends on the faith that we have yes sir and if our if our if our trials is maybe very very uh uh very hard to overcome maybe our faith is so high that uh or you know that God knew that we can overcome but we are all Overcomers of this age amen so you see the bride is God's choice they will be restored or brought back and they will be redeemed or bought back amen because they have eternal life in the first place isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters we we can put our belief in that I mean our faith in that because it's a it's it's an assurance amen so they are the redeemed they are converted they're translated and saved saved is common because it's not only the bride that will be in in the new Heaven and new earth that's why we have classes of people we'll we'll continue with that he's the word she is the word bride because we we put her clothing the word of God it's our righteousness his righteous righteousness become uh became our righteousness because we believe in him and he living in US amen he's a believer of the message of the hour this the bride because this message is for Rapture this is not only for salvation but it's for Rapture it's for Redemption it's for translation it's not only for salvation you will not go to through tribulation brothers and sisters if you believe this message amen she is the Queen of Heaven he's the capital c church not small CA Capital CA that's why it's highlighted amen he h she has the name her name is in the Lamb's Book of Life amen we know the Book of Life contains a a chapter of the Lamb's Book of Life and those names will not be blotted out amen amen we're Overcomers brothers and sisters we're more than conquerors amen we're the elect now being judged as she accepts the message of the hour so you see the judgment is happening right now whether you you're a Believer or unbeliever because there is a white Throne judgment which I have another timeline I still have 10 minutes bear with me I will let you go amen so we are being judged right now amen right for what we do according to the word yes what did we do with the word that we received through the prophet amen she will sit with Christ in judgment 1 Corinthians 6223 and Revelations 321 I think 1 Corinthians 62:3 is why why go to law or or a judge or or the court or whatever can't you judge uh simple things here as compared to you know the Heavenly things don't you know that we will judge Angels right we will judge Angels so that's why with the word of God right based on it everything is there it's just like uh when you're in a court or whatever profession you are you have certain uh rules that you need to follow if you're not following that then okay you you are violator of this or what but in this case it's according to the word right that's our Bible That's the I I remembered when when taking the exam uh here uh about ethics for for with a Pega and their basis one of their bases is the Bible moral about morality so it means they still believe before that there is God that the Bible is true because the product of a Bible will be peace will be love will be God Amen so that's why they they put that as one of their basis it's it's profound I I I I was surprised when I saw that that it's based on Bible also all the ethics because when you do something if it's not based on the word then you will think only of you know profit or whatever even though you're not uh uh you know if you're in a business or if you're working but if you're working for the Lord you want to please the Lord not the man or the boss amen it's important so because we can judge things according to the word and we are all work in progress we know that right no one is perfect amen amen and that's why we have Grace we have to extend Grace to each and everyone because we are one room Schoolhouse we know that amen so she will be raptured amen because only the bride will be raptured right because the Rapture there are six uh five uh six raptures in the Bible but then the thing is for our age for the Gentiles right the bride will be raptured and that is for this message because even the 144,000 will have their own Rapture or or or redemption or seal sealing in the Bible right but that's not for us so we will be in the Millennium amen we'll cross over we will be in new Heaven and new earth in the Kings and queen's chamber oh beautiful isn't that beautiful that's why you can see The Parables there all about Kingdom the kingdom of of the Holy Ghost the kingdom because we will sit as king and queen not only in the Millennium even Beyond Amen in the new Heaven and new earth we have enough oil which is the Holy Ghost in their lamp and vessel I put enough there because uh the other ones you will see they didn't have enough we'll go to the marriage supper which is the rapture which is the meeting in the air amen so you see these are all our attributes amen of being the bride the foolish virgins that's the second class they were virgins it means they didn't defile their you know their bodies it means they they're pure but did not go all the way in accepting the word of their day that's the message of the hour so it means they didn't accept the message of the hour that's why they're called foolish virgins amen that's why they will not go to the Rapture because if they accepted the message of the then they will go to the Rapture virgin means Purity they were all good people every every one of them virgin Sanctified vessels of God Amen they will be left behind and will go to tribulation we will plat this later on they will be saved but not in the Millennium amen will be judged as righteous by Jesus Christ with the bride during white Throne judgment we we don't need to wait for that right we want to be judged now amen and follow the word right now as for Matthew 25:3 2-33 and Revelations 20 to1 amen how their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection that is beyond Millennium that's the second Resurrection that's the white Throne judgment such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life so you see eternal life is not only for the bride amen it's also for those who will be you know purged also like the foolish virgins they are the church small SE the denominational church amen their names are in the book of life but not in the Lamb's Book of Life otherwise they will be the bride they will miss the Millennium right oo we'll be in the new Heaven and new Earth but outside the city oh aren't you glad you in the city have oil but not enough and it ran out amen oh the 144,000 and the elect Jews their names remain in the book of life right multitud Marty juice they are also saved but they're not the bride but they will be in the Millennium right the 144,000 elect juice sealed as per Revelation 7 will be slain at the end of the three and a half years of tribulation that means after tribulation there is a three and a half years at that time because uh uh Moses and Elijah will preach for three and a half years yes that's the time they will also be martyred together with the uh W with the with Moses and Elijah amen we'll be in the Millennium as Servants of the bridal chamber they're Uno they're they're the promised people but then God blinded them for a reason for you and me isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters sisters oh what more can we ask the fourth one the reprobates who are these reprobates their names were not written in the Book of Life they're in the revelations 138 and Revelation 178 they're like Pharaoh Romans 9:17 and22 Proverbs 16:4 the Lord had made the wicked for the day of evil job 2130 the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of Wrath in 1 Peter 2:8 and it says even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto they were appointed then june4 says it too who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into lasciviousness you see we cannot make them bride we cannot make them be saved they're born that way and God because of his for knowledge knew that they they won't even everyone is given the chance but uh you know if if if you don't hid that chance or you don't follow and Obey believe first and then obey right but then the thing is because of his for knowledge and it's about the sovereignty of God anyway right we we're just so thankful that he opened our eyes and then and we understand it's not because we're intelligent or we know everything no no one knows the more we know the more we we realize we don't know amen they're condemned these reprobates are condemned and they are called unbelievers they don't believe the word at so you can see sometimes we will meet people like that but then the thing is what can we do right it's about our reaction to what they do to us amen right borderline Believers they're like Judas in Acts 11617 and 25 they're like balum they're condemned also their names were written The Book of Life and later blotted out wow I'm so glad that my name is in the Lamb's Book of Life amen they're called the make Believers right okay the sheep and the goats so you see here this is during the white Throne judgment so the Sheep perhaps like Nicodemus and galel who stood for the children in the time of trouble will enter into eternal life because of their kindness you see to the Bride As per Matthew 2533 to 40 and Matthew 10:42 they gave cup of cold water to this little ones even simple ones the ones that help you when you have a flat tire they they gave you a favor in a line whatever whatever good that they will do to the bride they're called the friend of the Bride then they will be judged according to their Works their works of what on what they did to the bride also right so that's why and then the goats the wicked they are condemned because of their what unkindness to the bride so the other the opposite imagine oh and then they're also condemned to Everlasting punishment Everlasting means uh they will be totally separated from God because once they are Juds and they are they will be sent to Hell together with the with the false prophet and uh and uh and Satan then they will be forever you know away or totally separ separated from God they will not have eternal life because in in Hell there's no eternal hell we know that because otherwise they will still alive right hell is created for for the devil amen will be Juds according to their works so you see so these are the classes of people so you see knowing the classes of people what do we need to do in our lives being the bride we know that we have the highest calling here so we have to extend the grace every time we don't need to provoke other people that are not Believers if they don't accept what we're preaching we cannot do anything because God didn't open their eyes right amen so our our our job or our the work of the ministry here is to continue the the ministry of Jesus Christ because Ministry of Jesus Christ is through the is is for the Israelites but then they were blinded and that's why Paul Paul's preaching is to the Gentiles amen and then the prophet of this age is also a gentile amen and it it was handed over to the bride right now we are the one preaching now to the Lost amen because it needs a vessel right this gospel needs to be preached to all throughout the world that's the Commandment amen so that's why we need to be the vessels and our work is to preach and teach the gospel is not to clean right let the Holy Spirit cleanse every believer and let him do the election not us oh you are bride or you are reprobate not us brothers and sisters it's the word it's God himself who will do the election amen not us so sequence of time events okay nice oh three more minutes I think I I'll finish sequence of end time events this is beautiful I put the summary only so that at least it's uh it's fast I preached this here 70 weeks of Daniel but I put a summary so that we know why I I I want to uh uh preach on it that uh why do we need to know the 70 weeks of Daniel why did BR branam is always talking about it because we know God time piece is Israel if he said if if you know if you want to know the time of or or the day of the week right or the time of the week check your calendar but if you want to know the Time of the Season or or or or this day what time the day it is check Israel and what's going on in Israel right now is has been very close now that they're they're in their Homeland right all the checklist of the end time in Matthew 24 is already there war rumors of wars Israel is in their Hometown the only thing that is left the way we see it there's pestilence there's earthquakes in diverse places the only thing that we're waiting for is the preaching total preaching of the Gospel all throughout the world because the thing is there could be some that will not hear it but then the thing is the intent is for everyone to hear and then they can be judged whether they accept or not because you cannot judge something that they they haven't done right it's unfair for everyone that will be judged if they didn't hear it right and didn't accept it or or reject it or accept it amen so that's judgment did you accept this or did you reject it amen so you can see here 70 weeks right 7 weeks and 62 weeks it started in 445 BC up to 30 ad the calculation is 69th week so there's a half week during the uh uh Ministry of Jesus Christ and then he was cut off we know that scripturally and then that cut off is because God wants a bride of his own choosing from the Gentile there is a reason why he did that otherwise he will just continue but time was not calculated on the Gentiles so that's why why why he didn't come yet even though Baran was preaching in 1960s he said oh the coming of the Lord is so is here it could be tomorrow or what but he's so gracious that until the last predestinate cities in the fold then he cannot come the last Gentile and then it will be crossed over or this message of the hour which is the Full Gospel of Jesus Christ going back to the Jews again amen the other half week so you can see the timeline there 69th and this is the 70th week you can see the total is 70 weeks but they we're not counting the time now because it's still the time of the Gentiles all right so we'll not do the calculation but uh if you're interested we can calculate on uh Bible study so this is the summary of it you can see from eternity to Eternity but uh actually the 70 weeks of Daniel because Daniel is for the Jews the time of Daniel is for the Jews not for the Gentiles so that's why bar Branham preach it that uh why is it important so that you know where the time you are living and the time that oh really it's really at the end time amen so that's why it's so important if you will plot it 69 weeks here have Jesus Christ because he he got commission when at the age of 30 and he has three and a half years of uh Ministry before he was crucified that's Jesus Christ that's the first half of the 70th week and then come the the the seven Church Ages which is around 2,000 years and then before after the the Rapture will come and then there's another three and a half years amen so yeah I know this is uh uh between the seals and the Seven Church ages I know bar Barberry will tackle the uh it in very detail but this one is the the sequence of events after the Rapture so this is a fresh one so the first one let's start from today because that's the thing that is imminent right now is the rapture that's the only thing we're waiting for right now brothers and sisters is the chain of our bodies amen everything is is in place it's just the Reen changing of the body which is the meeting in the air Rapture amen that's the Rapture of the Gentile bride to the marriage supper then comes the tribulation per period before the Millennium what will happen here this is the last half week we just tackle it with the 70th week of Daniel that's exactly 1,260 days in Revelations 11 it's mentioned and 1 260 days in prophetic calendar 360 days per year it's exactly 3 three and A2 years so you see how perfect even the numbers where is the bride at after the Rapture he will be in the palace amen and that's why we're important it's a type when Joseph amen his family his bride is in the palace while Joseph is revealing himself to his brothers it's the same for us while Jesus Christ is revealing to his 144,000 elect Jews that he blinded purposely so that he can get a bride with we will be in the Palaces oh brothers and sisters if if you if this is founded in our hearts who can who can shake us amen the two witnesses you see these are the things that will happen here so the two witnesses or prophets of Revelations 11: 3-12 Moses and Elijah will minister to the 144,000 elect juice okay and then the foolish virgins also will be purged and killed so you see the foolish virgins the the bride is already out we are already in our glorified body we crossed the dimension but it's still a time element because Millennium is a thousand years amen but our bodies are different so NE there will be no more death for the bride amen amen after their Purge there will be Battle of our magedon it's in Revelation 16:16 Jesus returns with white horses with the glorified Saints forces of evil are overcome by Jesus as king of kings and Lord of lords Revelations 19:11 to 21 that is the third coming of Jesus Christ start off his third coming with the bride we will help basically uh the Israelite uh the the Jews basically that's so so that we can defeat the the Beast which is the Roman Catholic church amen and you see all the forces of evil will be will be uh overcome at that battle of our armagedon amen men and you you can find that in the message don't worry so it's not from me the Beast and the false prophet are cast alive into the Lake of Fire so it means even before the Millennium they will be cast this false beast and false prophet but later on they will be totally cast to the you know to the to Hell after all nature is Purge which is the six Hill and Earth will be burned as an oven this is the Malachi 413 that's why I said we will point we will try to plot this Malachi 413 and second Peter where they are because this one is natural fire volcanic fire or whatever fire but it's not coming from Heaven amen so then comes the Millennium so Satan is Bound for a th years Revelations 20 1- 3A Christ and the bride ruled the nations with a rod of iron as king and queen this is our rign this is our honeymoon right Witham is saying it's the honeymoon between the bride and the groom the hens will be raised as Nations hens hens means they haven't heard the gospel right because if you will reign as a king and a queen there you should have a domain right right there should be a subject who are the subject these are the heathens but where did these heathens come from it's a question but uh we we can talk about it but I don't want to presume also but then the thing is uh it's in the word that heathens will be raised we cannot limit God how they will be raised right so but then the thing is if there are people because in in I I believe it's is in Isaiah 65 we're thinking there will be no death in the Millennium but there is death in the Millennium not for the bride but there will be Mortals this hens because it says in in in Isaiah 65 right a a a a child will not get old because he will he he or she will die at 100 years same for the for for the trees so it means there's still death in the Millennium and at the same time there will be a little season when uh when Satan will be loose I I will continue with that so 144,000 Jews serve as unics to the bridal chamber this is the Millennium okay and then the post Millennium what will happen there Satan will be loose out of prison for a little season this is in this is what I'm talking about 20 and 3 B it's the second portion of this uh Revelations 20 and 3B he will be loose for a season for what to deceive the heans they will be like the sun of the sea where will this hens come from because for 10,000 years imagine how many people can be you know produced by The Mortals right during the Millennium because you cannot just raise someone as an enemy right other otherwise God will just you know make rocks and then worship him so they need to have their own free will right so this heans they didn't hear the Millennium that's why they called hens and they reproduced in the Millennium that's why there's so many but uh uh the thing there is uh I don't want to presume so much but then the thing is uh it just makes sense but it's not about sense or or reasoning but uh it's just scripturally there will be death in the Millennium amen and there will be Battle of Goen magod in Revelations 20 and9 and then holy fire comes down from heaven so this is the uh Revelations 20 and 9 and 2 Peter 31-13 if you will put the scriptures sometimes it got reversed and whatever but then the thing is if if the one that we read we look for a new Heaven and new earth after the fire after the Holy Fire It's called amen the devil is cast into the Lake of Fire and tormented forever Revelations 20 and 10 great white Throne judgment second or general Resurrection separate the sheep and the goats so this is the one where where the bride will sit with Jesus Christ as judge so that's why our families of course we will be biased right your family you so and you're the judge of course we everyone in right but then the thing is our families will be saved that's the scripture say but then we pray that there will also be bride not only be saved amen right and also our friends of course our colleagues who did good to us that's why right yeah and we will judge according to their Works what did they do to the bride death and Hell cast into Lake of Fire second death Revelations 24 those not found written The Book of Life are cast into the Lake of Fire so this is before eternity and then after that we will go to Eternity which is the Eighth Day again amen new Heaven and new earth amen I'll call the musici musicians and this is called the New Jerusalem city as well it's Revelations 21:22 eternity and time Blends together oh brothers and sisters you see where where where can we find this it's so rich that uh we're so thankful that God just so mer merciful to us that uh he just open our eyes of understanding oh how how how how can we understand all these things deep things of God oh God is so good to us amen I hope uh I know I I I try to limit it so at least yeah we still uh then past uh 9 so but uh forgive me maybe we can just uh sing some uh songs sister and then I'll give it to Barberry are we Justified can we sing Justified maybe I was sitting alone and wondering about what I'm supposed to do I can't deny the times I made mistakes I can't hide from in can you but I know that live with in my my soul I feel sorry Hest I do so I just cry and say forgive me Lord forgive me again with you [Music] justify justify you have not done it in the first place to justify justify JY you have not done it in the first place [Music] youy so often I am discouraged the times have fall a promise I'll be victorious when I know I'm not at all and I heard an eagle screaming his voice breaking my soul he said nothing it in the first place youtify justifi you have not done it first place you justy justify justify you have not done it in the first place you're [Applause] [Music] justifi [Applause] without it didn't look at you where you are now we from eternity he said just drop in that body you life master be off me you have not done it in the worst place you're justy [Music] justify [Applause] J you have not the first place you justify justify justify you have not done anything in the first place J Amen brother brandom said in the things that are to be he said that uh when you see uh that the life of Jesus Christ is ending because there's something that will come after it and uh he said uh we must be thankful that there's such thing as death because it's the only means so that we can cross over so that's when we are alive but then spiritually to grow and to live is for you to die first and that's why we need death in ourselves death with our own understanding death met with our own thinking we need the mind of Christ brothers and sisters and the only way we can take all this message of the hour which is Christ in us the hope of glory is to surrender ourselves amen not only die but rot so that we can grow oh brothers and sisters we we want to thank the Lord for for his grace and mercy for his election for his predestination for for his Wonderful Grace amen I'll ask Barberry to finish I hope it's real to you because uh you can see it's like a Roman Candle once you open a topic then it's just like a Candy I cannot blame him when there's so much good things brothers and sisters and we we thank the Lord [Music] amen you enjoy that tonight certainly wonderful to understand exactly where we are many of us know exactly where we are but sometimes it's good to just have our Pure Minds stirred up by way of remembrance some of these things I think are so good to to hear it's important for us to recognize that you know at the flood that's where all of the pure bloodline Naturally Speaking died out and when we think about the whole idea the concept this just struck me at the very beginning tonight the whole concept of serpent seed we talk about you know what every one of us Naturally Speaking our serpent seed because we're in a hybrid condition and this flesh will never be redeemed it will never be saved but it's the soul it's on the inside it's what's on the inside that counts so if we think that we're doing good works in this world and that's going to save us brothers and sisters we missed the Mark it's our soul that he's come for what a tremendous thing tonight to recognize this world's fit for judgment and uh we're just on the brink brothers and sisters brother Bram says it we'll just be doing our thing it'll just be a natural life that we live and we'll just step into that new dimension and and that's just any day now let's just bow in prayer as we close gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that we can look at these things that we heard about tonight father recognizing that you you you took and and you you hid them you wrapped them up in mystery for many many years and we know that there's there's men in the Bible that desire to see it and and we know that even angels desire to look upon these things prophets sages desired to look upon these things that we just speak about on a regular Wednesday night service oh father I pray that we would be able to understand the things that were spoken tonight father and if we can't I pray that as we heard we can ask you to reveal these things to us personally and you will we know you will and father we just thank you that those people in this world who can hear your word that they've been called to hear your word if we have the ability to hear your word it's because you called us to hear it father you gave us ears to hear what your spirit says to this age and father we know that if we can hear it that that means we are already Justified father and father we know that there's a day coming where we will be glorified and we just long for that day but until then we'll keep laboring father we'll keep giving you the fruit of our lips we'll keep worshiping you father more and more as we see that day approaching Lord father we know that we just can't keep quiet we just can't shut up we just can't hold our peace Lord we have to cry out unto you and express the love that you have given to us father back to you because we know that we are we come from glory and we're going to Glory from eternity right back to Eternity oh Lord what a blessing it is to understand these things we just pray that father you would keep your hand upon each one of us as we go our separate ways Lord that we could all do our part to find that pre last predestinated seed father that we would encourage one another towards good works father towards you Lord Jesus that we would provoke one another unto love Lord father we thank you for the the the burden you placed on brother mvin and we pray that you would just restore his strength Lord that you would help him to catch up on his his his tasks from today father that he was distracted from as he prepared as he had these thoughts Lord and father that you would just help him tomorrow at his job father we love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing that song on one of the few as we dismiss tonight not because of anything that we've done because of
