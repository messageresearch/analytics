[29:55] I
[29:57] I didn't come across it the first time

[30:16] lest I should put a stumbling box
[30:18] somewhere in their way I fear the people

[30:23] shall do something wrong that will cause

[47:39] 21 and 22.
[47:42] and the Lord went before them by day in
[47:45] a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way
[47:48] and by night in a pillar of fire to give
[47:50] them light
[47:52] to go by day and night
[47:54] he took not away the pillar of cloud by
[47:57] day nor the pillar of Fire by night
[48:01] from before the people
[48:03] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[48:06] Heavenly Father Lord we know that your
[48:08] scripture has a compound meaning and a
[48:11] compound Revelation and we know father
[48:13] that this word to many would be a
[48:16] mystical word that we read tonight
[48:18] father but we know it's a literal word
[48:20] for the message for our age Lord Jesus
[48:23] and we take it that way and we just
[48:25] accept it the way that you've provided
[48:27] it father we know that you are the same
[48:30] yesterday today and forever and that you
[48:32] change not Lord and father we just love
[48:34] you and we thank you for your word thank
[48:37] you for your leadership and your
[48:38] guidance Lord for not ever taking away
[48:41] that Pillar of Fire Lord Jesus or that
[48:44] cloud we just ask that you would be
[48:47] glorified in all that said and done now
[48:49] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[48:52] bless you tonight you may be seated
[48:55] foreign
[48:58] I'm still contending with the cold
[49:01] and uh certainly thankful for my healing
[49:05] it's a pleasure to be back and uh
[49:08] yeah I have lots to say
[49:11] I just would like to start with
[49:13] greetings from all of the Believers in
[49:15] the Philippines that we met
[49:17] there's such a lovely group of people
[49:19] there
[49:21] tremendous to go and see all of the the
[49:24] saints that we did and we know that we
[49:26] just met a mere few
[49:28] even though we met a lot
[49:30] um there was only just a few that we
[49:32] really had the opportunity to meet
[49:34] brother Danny del mundo
[49:37] um
[49:37] just a wonderful brother brother Ray
[49:39] Soriano
[49:40] his friend and they both are in Manila
[49:43] and have large congregations there
[49:47] um
[49:48] brother Danny tell Mondo he has uh and I
[49:51] think they work together at this as well
[49:53] I shouldn't say that it's all brother
[49:54] Danny but it might be I don't know the
[49:56] entire Dynamics but we we went uh into
[50:00] Manila and then we actually drove out
[50:03] from Manila we went and visited some
[50:05] Churches while we were there and took
[50:07] some services
[50:08] and I just thought it was tremendous to
[50:11] see the format that that's taking place
[50:14] in Philippines and I'm sure that it's
[50:16] that way all over the world but just to
[50:19] see it firsthand is
[50:21] it's second to none
[50:24] the brother goes and witnesses to
[50:26] someone and that that someone receives
[50:30] the message of the hour and takes it to
[50:33] the people and then before long
[50:35] that brother becomes a pastor to the
[50:38] people in his area
[50:40] and before long they start to get
[50:42] together and and create a church they
[50:45] get a church set in order and this comes
[50:48] from brother Danny del mundo he helps
[50:51] them set the church in order to
[50:53] recognize that if there's going to be a
[50:54] local body there needs to be a local
[50:56] commitment it's not just something from
[50:58] without it has to come from within and
[51:01] he teaches them the the tithes and the
[51:04] missions and the offerings and and gets
[51:06] the people to come together and then
[51:08] there's a pastor and then there's
[51:10] deacons and then there's trustees it's
[51:13] the same format that we have here over
[51:16] there but then that group gets
[51:18] established and then someone from that
[51:20] group gets inspired to go and talk to
[51:22] someone else and before long he takes
[51:24] that word to another group that actually
[51:27] gets inspired a brother Rises up and
[51:30] becomes a pastor and starts to speak to
[51:32] the people and before long the just
[51:35] repeat the process and we went from
[51:37] church to church to church that had gone
[51:39] through the that process of people
[51:42] hearing the word of God and actually
[51:44] catching the revelation of the message
[51:45] of the hour and becoming Believers of
[51:48] this word and then suddenly there's this
[51:50] group of Believers looking to put
[51:51] together a church
[51:53] and I don't think I'd seen it in that
[51:55] light before but it's it's tremendous
[51:58] when you can actually go and see the
[52:00] bricks and mortar and a few years ago we
[52:03] had committed to helping in one of the
[52:05] churches there and as the money goes to
[52:09] a place like that the brother Danny del
[52:11] mundo who is sort of the facilitator of
[52:13] it he he distributes the money a little
[52:15] bit here and a little bit here and a
[52:17] little bit here into all these
[52:18] outreaches they get a little bit every
[52:20] now and again but to see the work that
[52:23] can be done with just a tiny little bit
[52:25] of of missions funding is tremendous and
[52:28] you know brothers and sisters when you
[52:30] see it firsthand when you recognize how
[52:33] much maybe just say 50 US dollars
[52:36] actually is in in Filipino pesos but if
[52:40] you take that and and you know you you
[52:41] add a couple zeros and you go to five
[52:45] thousand dollars U.S dollars what what
[52:48] that or Canadian funds however you want
[52:49] to look at it in internationally USD is
[52:52] kind of the the thing so that's why I'm
[52:54] saying it that way but what what five
[52:57] thousand dollars will do for a church is
[53:00] almost build a building half of a
[53:02] building would would be completely built
[53:04] from that kind of investment I think
[53:06] actually I'm wrong probably a whole
[53:08] entire building would be built for that
[53:09] much money it's tremendous and and what
[53:12] it does for the people they go from
[53:15] worshiping in just a shanty to actually
[53:17] having walls and a floor and Chairs set
[53:20] up a building that's very similar to
[53:23] this only there's no windows there's
[53:25] just louvers in the holes where the
[53:27] windows are
[53:28] but anyways we got to go and and see
[53:30] some of these first hand and actually
[53:32] take services at the churches Brother
[53:34] Juan a brother Alvin and a brother ernan
[53:37] and it turns out I think it's brother
[53:39] ernin
[53:40] was a a school time a childhood
[53:44] classmate of brother Mervin is that the
[53:47] right brother
[53:49] Erna no they didn't know each other but
[53:51] they had the exact same teachers and
[53:53] they were in the same school at the same
[53:54] time and so years later as believers
[53:57] they come back together and recognize
[53:58] that they actually have this connection
[54:00] so it's pretty interesting to see
[54:04] um
[54:05] so yeah I'm not going to give an
[54:07] exhortation on what we did in the
[54:09] Philippines tonight if you were looking
[54:10] for a report I'm sorry I'm going to wait
[54:12] for brother Mervin because I know that
[54:14] he will do a much better job than I
[54:17] but uh he definitely will have a lot
[54:20] more information than I have to bring as
[54:22] well I I have to apologize when we were
[54:25] there
[54:26] um I got sick
[54:28] on the first week we went for the two
[54:30] weeks the first
[54:32] three nights and four days we went to an
[54:34] island and just sort of climatized and
[54:36] it was kind of a fun time we had some
[54:38] swimming and and some snorkeling we went
[54:40] on a boat we actually got to do some
[54:42] fishing on a reef which was really
[54:44] interesting that was kind of my speed
[54:47] um but we ate local food and you know we
[54:49] had a wonderful time there but that's
[54:52] where I started to get really sick with
[54:54] a head cold and then I had to go and
[54:56] preach so it's all kind of a blur to me
[54:59] and I don't really want to get mixed up
[55:01] so I'm really going to just go with that
[55:03] tonight and say I'm going to wait for
[55:05] brother Mervin to really get into the
[55:06] details there's some things though that
[55:09] that we saw
[55:11] um
[55:12] which I I think is just amazing actually
[55:16] it's a different world out there it
[55:18] really is and uh you know just two
[55:21] things I'll mention two things I didn't
[55:24] see it with my own eyes but Isaac dot
[55:27] Isaac did and I think brother miles did
[55:29] uh and that was a bat
[55:32] in the evening we pulled into one place
[55:33] we got there at night and uh it turns
[55:36] out they saw a bat that was larger than
[55:38] a raven
[55:39] just gliding underneath the street light
[55:42] and so I thought you know Isaac was
[55:45] telling me this and sometimes children
[55:47] can be exaggerated and I thought you
[55:49] know maybe you're going a little far
[55:51] with this but I looked it up and uh
[55:54] guess we're the largest bat in the world
[55:56] lives and it only lives there and that's
[55:59] in Philippines it has a wingspan of five
[56:01] to six feet and it's called the Golden
[56:04] crowned flying fox and it is literally
[56:07] the largest bat in the world
[56:10] foreign
[56:12] excuse me the other thing they have
[56:14] there which is extraordinary is spiders
[56:18] we had an experience
[56:21] that I I I'll just wait for brother
[56:23] Mervin to get back to really talk about
[56:25] that one but we had a spider in a van
[56:27] I'll just say it that way
[56:29] that was an experience
[56:30] um while I was preaching the last
[56:31] service there I remember I mentioned
[56:34] there's no windows there's just louvers
[56:35] they just have louvers and it was a
[56:38] building quite similar to ours only the
[56:40] back part of it is just open they don't
[56:41] have any doors there's no need for doors
[56:43] and they just had a vestibule at the
[56:45] back and plastic molded chairs on each
[56:48] side so it's quite like a church a
[56:50] normal church that you would see in
[56:51] different parts of the world concrete
[56:54] floors really nice tiled floors but out
[56:57] of this Louver here in the front window
[56:59] I saw a spider that big come through
[57:02] those louvers and it was lightning fast
[57:05] it was so fast I I actually stopped
[57:08] preaching and I said that is a very big
[57:11] spider right there
[57:13] just by the way it moved so fast I don't
[57:15] know what got me the speed or the size
[57:17] but then it went down the wall right
[57:20] beside a sister like our chairs are up
[57:22] against the wall that's how the chairs
[57:23] were there and the sister didn't even
[57:25] Flinch I said sister that spider and and
[57:28] she almost looked at me like she was
[57:30] getting upset that I was you know saying
[57:32] it but
[57:33] I just said okay
[57:34] I wanted to take my phone and take a
[57:36] picture of that thing because it was
[57:37] something else
[57:39] but yeah apparently uh
[57:42] they have spiders that big and I think
[57:44] they call it a huntsman spider I looked
[57:45] it up it's it's frighteningly fast if I
[57:48] was a bird I would be afraid
[57:51] even though I'm not a bird I'm a human
[57:53] I'm still sort of fearful but you know
[57:55] what it did for me is it kind of
[57:56] corrected my equilibrium I guess with
[57:58] spiders because now you know whatever
[58:00] it's a spider right it's a spider it
[58:04] doesn't matter
[58:06] seeing uh seeing Manila was was
[58:09] life-changing on its own just actually
[58:11] seeing the place uh brother Mervin said
[58:14] that it's one-fifth of the geographical
[58:16] size of Calgary
[58:18] but it has a population of 20 million
[58:21] people
[58:22] so the population is very very dense and
[58:25] and the shocking part about it is you
[58:28] see
[58:29] um wealthy and poverty just right beside
[58:32] each other
[58:33] everybody's just trying to make a living
[58:34] and you see shanties all over the place
[58:36] and you see dogs cats it's just
[58:41] it's a third world country it's
[58:43] definitely different but uh I think it
[58:46] would be so good for others to actually
[58:49] go and potentially you know see some of
[58:52] these things
[58:53] um
[58:54] in time we'll see what the Lord has in
[58:56] store
[58:57] it's life-changing to see another world
[58:59] and I think it's incredible and I I was
[59:01] so thankful to the people and and I was
[59:04] as well when we went to Kenya with
[59:06] brother Gilbert when you go and you
[59:08] actually get to meet
[59:10] a brother or a sister that you deal with
[59:12] in the church as your brother and sister
[59:15] when you get to go and meet their people
[59:17] there's something very special about
[59:19] that and to go and meet the people the
[59:21] Filipino people is has just been amazing
[59:24] our lives have been changed forever
[59:28] we're certainly thankful for our healing
[59:30] though I'm still coughing and stuttering
[59:33] a little bit from this cold and and Lisa
[59:35] is just about I would say 99.9 percent
[59:38] better
[59:39] from the the parasite or whatever it is
[59:42] that she got but
[59:44] we're just thankful
[59:45] thankful for the opportunity to go and
[59:48] meet the Believers there
[59:51] you know uh I just would like to take a
[59:53] moment as well and thank the brothers
[59:54] here
[59:55] for the Gilbert brother Toby and brother
[59:58] Emmanuel for stepping in and taking the
[1:00:01] services keeping Church going you know
[1:00:04] it really does something to the heart of
[1:00:05] a pastor I'm learning to know that when
[1:00:08] you go away we're all pulling for the
[1:00:10] same goal there isn't Schism in the body
[1:00:13] there's not someone pulling or pushing
[1:00:15] jockeying and and you know for me to
[1:00:18] actually get into YouTube and start
[1:00:21] really going into the services I'm just
[1:00:23] saying amen amen amen I and my father
[1:00:27] are one amen you know what there's a
[1:00:30] scarecrow there that means there's good
[1:00:32] eating Brothers and Sisters Let's get in
[1:00:34] there let's get after it you know what
[1:00:36] we all have talents God's given us
[1:00:38] talents and we can use them spiritually
[1:00:41] and get hung up on that but we all have
[1:00:44] natural talents as well and we have been
[1:00:46] given the opportunity to demonstrate
[1:00:47] that in the workplace in school wherever
[1:00:50] it is we're at
[1:00:51] so I just want to say thank you Brothers
[1:00:53] it means a lot to me and I'm sure it
[1:00:56] does for everyone I had someone give me
[1:00:57] the report that they have grown while we
[1:01:00] were away so that's a tremendous thing
[1:01:02] to hear from my perspective so thank you
[1:01:05] so much
[1:01:07] we preach four Services the second week
[1:01:09] that we were there and uh the first
[1:01:11] three services were a real blur for me I
[1:01:14] didn't sleep much
[1:01:15] I had a cough I had that cold it was
[1:01:19] just a it was just a real opportunity to
[1:01:22] thank the Lord in the midst of the trial
[1:01:24] because I I just wanted to curl up in a
[1:01:27] ball but I got to go and preach and uh
[1:01:30] you know I signed up for it so I
[1:01:32] certainly was thankful for the
[1:01:34] opportunity to be able to do it
[1:01:36] but you know what what I want to do
[1:01:38] tonight brothers and sisters is just go
[1:01:40] back to the final service that I
[1:01:41] preached in Philippines it did something
[1:01:44] to me and I think it was just such a
[1:01:46] wonderful wonderful time that we had
[1:01:49] um you know talking about the Believers
[1:01:52] I started out with a quote here I'm just
[1:01:54] going to get into it now if it's all
[1:01:56] just the same
[1:01:58] you know brother Bradham he says this
[1:02:00] and this was sort of something I wanted
[1:02:02] to say to the people in Philippines I
[1:02:04] wasn't sure how they were about quotes
[1:02:06] and and stuff and I I'm so glad they're
[1:02:09] able to receive the quotes
[1:02:12] um some people are funny about it some
[1:02:13] people are funny about the church age
[1:02:15] book you never really know what you're
[1:02:17] getting yourself into when you get
[1:02:18] behind a Pulpit in in different places
[1:02:20] but they received it very well it's a
[1:02:23] really difficult thing as well to be
[1:02:25] able to to preach through an interpreter
[1:02:27] because you have to go slow and when the
[1:02:29] anointing strikes you have to hit the
[1:02:31] brakes it's such a strange thing
[1:02:34] but you know I read this quote to them
[1:02:36] out of God in Simplicity in 1963 and I
[1:02:39] think it applies we could say this
[1:02:40] anywhere we go
[1:02:42] now I think it's our duty to make the
[1:02:44] inside right by the grace of God to be
[1:02:46] so grateful to God
[1:02:48] this this will just not only be a
[1:02:51] beautiful building that will come to but
[1:02:54] may everyone who comes in see the
[1:02:56] beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] and every person that comes in may it be
[1:03:01] a consecrated place to our Lord a
[1:03:03] consecrated people for no matter how
[1:03:06] beautiful the structure is
[1:03:08] that we certainly do appreciate
[1:03:11] the beauty of the church is the
[1:03:13] character of the people
[1:03:15] I trust it'll always be a house of God
[1:03:19] of beauty
[1:03:21] I just think that's so wonderful it's so
[1:03:23] applicable it doesn't matter where we go
[1:03:26] because the building is the building
[1:03:30] when we were there there was a church an
[1:03:31] Apostolic church I believe it was an
[1:03:33] Apostolic church that uh it wasn't
[1:03:36] Catholic but boy their buildings sure
[1:03:38] looked Catholic
[1:03:39] and we know that it's either the message
[1:03:42] of the hour or the Beast system and you
[1:03:45] can see the inspiration behind it
[1:03:46] because the buildings were just unreal
[1:03:48] so fancy and uh you know there's so much
[1:03:52] Catholic over there I think that's the
[1:03:54] predominant religion in Philippines
[1:03:57] but still when you get around the
[1:03:58] Believers it's just just like being home
[1:04:02] we had such a wonderful time
[1:04:04] talking about our scripture tonight I
[1:04:06] just want to get into this here and I
[1:04:09] hope you don't go too long
[1:04:11] but the uh the Lord went before them by
[1:04:14] day in a pillar of cloud to lead them
[1:04:16] the way and by night in a pillar of fire
[1:04:19] to give them light
[1:04:20] to go by day and night
[1:04:23] and isn't it wonderful to think the day
[1:04:25] in in which we live the age in which we
[1:04:28] live
[1:04:29] the word says that it shall be light
[1:04:32] in the evening time
[1:04:34] and how is it going to be light we're
[1:04:36] not looking at the sunlight setting and
[1:04:38] saying well you know we saw brother
[1:04:40] Branham cut the top of the pyramid off
[1:04:42] in junior Jackson's dream and he said
[1:04:44] stay here and look on this and then he
[1:04:46] went West and everybody watched him go
[1:04:47] west and some people followed them West
[1:04:49] into the sunset that's not the light
[1:04:50] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:04:52] the pillar of Fire Light the light
[1:04:54] that's not on the spectrum of the eyes I
[1:04:57] would say it's on the spectrum of the
[1:04:59] heart the pillar of Fire Light that one
[1:05:01] that once it shines on the heart of a
[1:05:04] Believer a predestinated seed a life
[1:05:06] Springs forth something changes in the
[1:05:09] heart of a Believer and that's why I
[1:05:11] just think it's so fantastic when you
[1:05:13] talk about these brothers in the
[1:05:15] Philippines and I'm sure it's in Congo
[1:05:17] I'm sure it's in Kenya I'm sure it's in
[1:05:20] in in Nigeria it's everywhere around the
[1:05:22] world it's the same gospel it's the same
[1:05:24] Spirit when someone truly gets that that
[1:05:27] Pillar of Fire experience in their own
[1:05:29] life something breaks forth and they
[1:05:32] can't stop it and they go forth and they
[1:05:34] actually begin to preach this gospel but
[1:05:36] what they're doing is sharing the pillar
[1:05:38] of Fire Light with people and what
[1:05:41] happens is people get saved that life
[1:05:43] that seed Gene of God that's in them
[1:05:45] from before the foundation of the world
[1:05:47] can't do anything but just Break Forth
[1:05:49] life and then before long you have
[1:05:51] another pastor and before long you've
[1:05:53] got another church
[1:05:55] you don't go and preach 24 months and
[1:05:58] have nothing change
[1:06:01] something happens in the heart of a
[1:06:04] believer
[1:06:06] out of Exodus
[1:06:08] Chapter 14 verse 24.
[1:06:11] I can just go there for the sake of time
[1:06:16] 14 24
[1:06:18] and it came to pass that in the morning
[1:06:20] watch
[1:06:22] the Lord looked down to the host of the
[1:06:24] Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
[1:06:26] of the cloud and troubled the host of
[1:06:29] the Egyptians
[1:06:32] and took off their chariot wheels that
[1:06:34] they draved them heavily so the
[1:06:35] Egyptians said let us flee from the face
[1:06:37] of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them
[1:06:40] against the Egyptians
[1:06:43] I had talked about this a while ago and
[1:06:45] I just couldn't get rid of it so I
[1:06:47] thought we'd talk about it again tonight
[1:06:48] and that is this thought that you know
[1:06:51] he looked at them the Lord looked unto
[1:06:54] the host of the Egyptians
[1:06:56] through the pillar of fire and of the
[1:06:59] cloud and I believe that's exactly
[1:07:02] what's going on in our day brothers and
[1:07:04] sisters he's looking on the host of the
[1:07:07] Gentile bride through the pillar of fire
[1:07:11] and the cloud and many times we can look
[1:07:14] at that cloud and say it's a fantastic
[1:07:16] Supernatural thing that happened in 1963
[1:07:19] over sunset Mountain and sure indeed it
[1:07:23] was and is but what is it to us today
[1:07:26] what does it mean to the believer today
[1:07:29] what does that Pillar of Fire mean to us
[1:07:32] today is it just a a picture that hangs
[1:07:35] in the Supernatural Hall of Fame in
[1:07:37] Washington D.C which I heard actually
[1:07:40] actually it does hang there today it
[1:07:43] hasn't changed it's still hanging there
[1:07:45] in Washington DC as the only
[1:07:48] supernatural being ever captured on film
[1:07:52] and what do those things mean to us
[1:07:54] today
[1:07:55] I just want to say it this way that
[1:07:57] that's God looking at us we don't have
[1:08:00] to hang a picture on our wall to say
[1:08:01] that God is looking at us what we need
[1:08:04] to do is just remember that that Pillar
[1:08:06] of Fire picture is a reminder of this
[1:08:08] scripture that we're talking about
[1:08:10] tonight that he took not the pillar took
[1:08:12] not away the pillar of Fire by night or
[1:08:15] the pillar of cloud by day from before
[1:08:17] the people he's kept them before the
[1:08:19] people throughout all the ages it's
[1:08:21] exactly according to scripture and even
[1:08:24] though it's happened in our age people
[1:08:26] will say well we're too scientifically
[1:08:28] Advanced to be able to accept it it's
[1:08:30] got to be a Thor rocket or maybe someone
[1:08:32] misinterpreted what it is there's got to
[1:08:34] be some moisture up in the sky but we
[1:08:36] had a Vindicated prophet in our day say
[1:08:38] you know what that picture I was
[1:08:40] troubled at it but God said to me turn
[1:08:43] it right
[1:08:44] turn it right and what did he mean turn
[1:08:47] it right 90 degrees or did he say look
[1:08:49] at it through the same eyes that I look
[1:08:52] at it from just like brother Gilbert
[1:08:54] said I am my father are one but that
[1:08:56] wasn't brother Gilbert saying that that
[1:08:58] was God saying to the Church of the
[1:09:00] Living God recognize your day and its
[1:09:03] message
[1:09:04] we're not here to play Church we're here
[1:09:06] to recognize the second coming of the
[1:09:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:10] and how did he do it through the pillar
[1:09:13] of fire through the cloud that's how he
[1:09:16] came the word coming of the Lord the
[1:09:18] rest of the world is looking for the
[1:09:19] 60-foot Jesus for the banisters of
[1:09:22] Heaven to unwind and all the angels to
[1:09:24] appear and the cataclysmic crashes and
[1:09:27] everything to change like they said
[1:09:28] about Y2K they're looking for that to
[1:09:30] happen but again the Vindicated Prophet
[1:09:32] for our day said you know what it's
[1:09:34] going to be the secret sudden going away
[1:09:36] of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:38] the world's not going to know anything
[1:09:40] about it she's just going to disappear
[1:09:42] but I think it's a tremendous
[1:09:44] opportunity for us to to just brush up
[1:09:47] our experiences and remember that the
[1:09:49] prophet also said that it will be
[1:09:51] scarcely 12 people from this generation
[1:09:54] that's a shocking thought
[1:09:57] that means Lord oh my I shudder at that
[1:10:01] thought help me Lord to get my stuff in
[1:10:04] order but we know that none of his will
[1:10:06] be lost
[1:10:08] none of his will be lost
[1:10:10] I heard brother Paul mention it that uh
[1:10:13] and I don't mean to correct I just want
[1:10:14] to say it this way because to to
[1:10:16] underpin what you said brother out of 8
[1:10:19] billion people in the world he chose us
[1:10:22] to be the ones to receive this message
[1:10:25] you look at a city of Manila and see how
[1:10:27] many people are squished into there it's
[1:10:29] it's such a a high population in the
[1:10:32] whole whole country of Philippines I
[1:10:34] think is 180 million people but what
[1:10:37] about 8 billion people
[1:10:39] it won't be 20 million people that are
[1:10:41] saved I don't think so
[1:10:44] brother Branham says people say to him
[1:10:46] but what about all of the ages brother
[1:10:49] Branham says it yeah it will only be a
[1:10:51] few out of this age there will be
[1:10:53] Millions over there but it's going to be
[1:10:55] from all of the ages that comes it's not
[1:10:58] going to be Millions just from this age
[1:11:01] and we know the word talks about five
[1:11:03] wise and five unwise we're not going to
[1:11:06] get into that tonight I'm guess I'm just
[1:11:08] going on a tangent here I apologize but
[1:11:10] you know talking about this this
[1:11:12] scripture here
[1:11:14] out of Exodus 23
[1:11:17] verse 20.
[1:11:21] Exodus 23 verse 20.
[1:11:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:11:27] and forever
[1:11:30] he's not changing his way
[1:11:32] he dealt with the children of Israel
[1:11:35] this way
[1:11:36] and he deals with the Gentiles this way
[1:11:40] or we never would have seen a clout in
[1:11:42] 1963 we never would have seen a pillar
[1:11:45] of fire picture
[1:11:46] those wouldn't have happened
[1:11:48] verse 20 says behold of gen Exodus
[1:11:51] chapter 23 verse 20. behold I sent an
[1:11:54] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:11:56] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:11:58] which I have prepared
[1:12:01] isn't it a wonderful thought Brothers
[1:12:03] and Sisters Jesus Christ the same
[1:12:04] yesterday today forever sending an angel
[1:12:06] before our way to prepare the way for us
[1:12:10] to prepare the way of the Lord that that
[1:12:13] Elijah Ministry to prepare
[1:12:17] a place for us verse 21 says beware of
[1:12:20] him and obey his voice
[1:12:23] just listen to him don't try and add to
[1:12:25] it or take away from it just listen to
[1:12:27] him provoke him not for he will not
[1:12:30] pardon your transgressions from my name
[1:12:33] is in him
[1:12:36] that takes away all of the question
[1:12:38] right there
[1:12:39] it's not his name
[1:12:41] we're talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:12:43] Christ's name Elohim that one that was
[1:12:45] in the pillar of fire looking at the
[1:12:47] host of the Egyptians that's who is in
[1:12:50] him when he says thus saith the Lord
[1:12:53] verse 22 but if Thou shalt indeed obey
[1:12:56] his voice
[1:12:58] and do all that I speak isn't it
[1:13:00] interesting I I just dwelled on this and
[1:13:03] I think I will tonight it's such a
[1:13:04] powerful thought if if Thou shalt indeed
[1:13:07] obey his voice
[1:13:09] and then the next words are and do all
[1:13:12] that I speak
[1:13:14] so whose voice is it
[1:13:18] then I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:13:21] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[1:13:23] adversaries
[1:13:25] for my angel shall go before thee and
[1:13:29] bring thee unto the amorites unto the
[1:13:32] Hittites and the parasites and the
[1:13:33] Canaanites and the hivites and the
[1:13:34] jebusites and I will cut them off
[1:13:37] brothers and sisters he's the same
[1:13:39] yesterday today and forever if we will
[1:13:41] listen to his voice recognize that it's
[1:13:43] not his voice that it's God's voice and
[1:13:46] that God has his name in there
[1:13:49] he will cut our enemies off
[1:13:51] he'll destroy them and we won't see them
[1:13:53] anymore
[1:13:55] I personally believe this this is my
[1:13:57] view that we're not going to have to
[1:13:59] wait until the Millennium to get to a
[1:14:01] place in our lives where Satan just
[1:14:02] won't know what to do with us
[1:14:04] as the bride comes to that place of
[1:14:07] perfection that brother Toby spoke about
[1:14:09] out of Philippians and you know brothers
[1:14:11] and sisters I believe that's such a
[1:14:13] powerful scripture we might get there
[1:14:15] tonight but you know what we're supposed
[1:14:16] to push on to Perfection out of Hebrews
[1:14:19] just just go on to Perfection forget
[1:14:21] about all of these ordinances that we
[1:14:23] have in the church water baptism and
[1:14:26] laying on of hands and and gifts and
[1:14:28] callings and all these different things
[1:14:30] that we strive to find and do we don't
[1:14:32] need those necessarily anymore because
[1:14:34] we have him we don't need to have the
[1:14:37] gift when we have The Giver
[1:14:40] he'll give it all to us
[1:14:43] I just think it's so powerful to
[1:14:45] recognize his voice and just do all that
[1:14:47] I speak wait a second I thought that was
[1:14:49] Moses voice that you were talking about
[1:14:51] there but now you're saying all that I
[1:14:54] speak he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:56] forever if we obey brother branham's
[1:14:59] voice and do all that God spoke through
[1:15:02] him brothers and sisters it will change
[1:15:05] things for us
[1:15:07] gifts and callings are without
[1:15:09] repentance in 1950 Exodus the 23rd
[1:15:12] chapter 20th verse beginning God's
[1:15:14] sending his Prophet Moses behold I sent
[1:15:17] an angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:15:19] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:15:21] which I have prepared beware of him obey
[1:15:25] his voice provoke him not for he will
[1:15:27] not pardon your transgressions for my
[1:15:29] name is in him but if thou will indeed
[1:15:31] obey his voice and do all that I speak
[1:15:34] then will I be an enemy to thy enemies
[1:15:37] an adversary to thy adversaries for my
[1:15:40] angel shall go before thee
[1:15:44] Moses did nothing
[1:15:46] brother Brown I'm speaking here
[1:15:48] it was the angel of God is that right
[1:15:54] what did it look like that led Israel
[1:15:58] a pillar of Fire by night
[1:16:01] and A Cloud by day
[1:16:05] I believe he's still leading on
[1:16:08] we know that was Angel of the Covenant
[1:16:11] is that right
[1:16:14] I just love this thought brothers and
[1:16:16] sisters because who's the angel of the
[1:16:17] Covenant what's the angel of the
[1:16:18] Covenant is Jesus Christ the same
[1:16:20] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:16:22] angel of the Covenant and it's not
[1:16:23] Gabriel it's it's not Michael although
[1:16:26] brother Branham says Michael is Jesus
[1:16:28] Jesus is Michael that's a discussion
[1:16:31] sometime he goes on to say we know that
[1:16:33] was the angel of the Covenant is that
[1:16:35] right it was the logos or the Christ
[1:16:38] he's still the same Leading the People
[1:16:41] today as he was then
[1:16:45] we're not talking crazy talk here
[1:16:47] brothers and sisters this is just almost
[1:16:49] Elementary stuff that the prophet of God
[1:16:52] said but sometimes I think it just
[1:16:54] really is good to just dust it off and
[1:16:56] and stir up our Pure Minds by way of
[1:16:58] remembrance recognizing this Pillar of
[1:17:00] Fire is not something to just say it's
[1:17:02] just a great picture that God allowed to
[1:17:04] happen and this cloud is not just
[1:17:06] something that God just allowed to
[1:17:08] happen I personally believe this that
[1:17:10] that cloud was just an invitation to the
[1:17:13] Bride of Jesus Christ just like John
[1:17:15] Once Upon a Time saw a door open in
[1:17:17] heaven that cloud is a door open in
[1:17:20] heaven to the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:17:22] say come up a little higher there's a
[1:17:24] revelation that I want you to know and
[1:17:26] that's not that you're just an ordinary
[1:17:27] church member that you are a bride that
[1:17:30] I have chosen from before the foundation
[1:17:32] of the world positionally placed to be
[1:17:34] grown up in Satan's Eden but just like
[1:17:37] Satan came in the Garden of Eden and
[1:17:39] took himself a bride I chose a bride to
[1:17:42] be taken right out of Satan's Eden and
[1:17:45] she won't fail at the word she won't
[1:17:47] stumble at the word she won't mix
[1:17:49] anything with this word it will not be a
[1:17:51] hybridized bride she will only have eyes
[1:17:55] for him
[1:17:57] Exodus 23 verse 20. I just think it's
[1:18:00] such a beautiful thought I'm going to go
[1:18:02] back to it here Exodus 23 verse 20. oh
[1:18:09] behold I sent an angel before thee to
[1:18:11] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[1:18:14] into the place which I have prepared and
[1:18:17] we know there's only one provided place
[1:18:19] of worship that's been prepared for us
[1:18:21] today brothers and sisters and you know
[1:18:23] I want to say it this way it is the
[1:18:25] message of the hour but you know what
[1:18:27] it's not Jeffersonville it's not voice
[1:18:30] of God Recordings it is the voice of God
[1:18:34] it's literally the voice of God through
[1:18:37] a Vindicated Prophet that's what we're
[1:18:38] talking about brothers and sisters this
[1:18:41] place that we have prepared for us is in
[1:18:45] Jesus Christ who is the message of the
[1:18:48] hour and it will not be denominated
[1:18:50] brother Branham says out of the Angel of
[1:18:53] the Lord in 1951 the same angel of God
[1:18:56] you know what I think friends I think
[1:18:59] that here's where this is in Exodus 13
[1:19:02] 21 and the Lord went before them by day
[1:19:06] in a pillar of cloud and a pillar of
[1:19:09] Cloud to lead them in the way and by
[1:19:12] night in a pillar of fire to give them
[1:19:15] light
[1:19:16] to go by Night and Day
[1:19:18] he took not away the pillar of cloud by
[1:19:21] day nor the pillar of Fire by night from
[1:19:24] before the people and with the reverent
[1:19:26] sincere heart I believe that that's the
[1:19:29] same angel of God that led Israel out of
[1:19:32] Egypt to the promised land in the
[1:19:34] natural is leading us to the promised
[1:19:36] land today in the spiritual
[1:19:41] and remember brothers and sisters what
[1:19:43] happened
[1:19:44] that cloud on Sunset Mountain
[1:19:47] something happened at that time
[1:19:49] and we know that was the call for the
[1:19:52] prophet it was a fulfillment of a
[1:19:54] prophecy it was a fulfillment of Dreams
[1:19:56] it was a fulfillment of many things but
[1:19:58] what what we're getting to brothers and
[1:20:00] sisters is that was actually God
[1:20:02] revealing the word to mankind again and
[1:20:05] you know brother Branham he went back
[1:20:07] according to the vision according to the
[1:20:09] instruction to go back to Jeffersonville
[1:20:11] to to preach the seals because he didn't
[1:20:13] open the seals some people might say
[1:20:15] that he opened the seals he preached the
[1:20:16] seals because that Covenant Angel the
[1:20:19] same one that was leading Israel is the
[1:20:21] one that opened the seals to this
[1:20:24] preacher that preached the seals and we
[1:20:26] know the man was the prophet of God I'm
[1:20:28] not trying to diminish him in any way
[1:20:30] but I just want to make a clear
[1:20:31] delineation that it was God that opened
[1:20:33] those seals it wasn't a man it was only
[1:20:36] God but that's what that cloud shows to
[1:20:39] us brothers and sisters is that God came
[1:20:41] down and revealed himself to mankind
[1:20:44] once again he didn't go outside of his
[1:20:46] word brother Branham said those seals
[1:20:48] there must be something additional to
[1:20:49] themselves somewhere along the way we've
[1:20:51] got to get this other Revelation but
[1:20:52] what God showed him was it was always
[1:20:54] laying right there in the word it was
[1:20:56] always in the word and it just needed to
[1:20:58] be revealed to us but it was the same
[1:21:01] angel that did it but what it was we
[1:21:04] hear about it and we think my that
[1:21:05] sounds interesting you know brother
[1:21:07] Branham was up in Sabina Canada praying
[1:21:09] the one time and that sword hit his hand
[1:21:11] and he said what's this why do I have a
[1:21:13] sword I'm always afraid of swords and he
[1:21:16] heard the voice say that's the sword of
[1:21:18] the king
[1:21:19] and he said the the king's sword the
[1:21:22] sword of the king the sword of a king
[1:21:24] and we know the voice said to him not a
[1:21:26] king but the king and there's only one
[1:21:28] king brother Branham said that's the
[1:21:30] sword of the king and that's not just a
[1:21:32] fancy story brothers and sisters that
[1:21:34] dovetails with this Cloud that we're
[1:21:36] talking about the cloud by day and the
[1:21:38] pillar of Fire by night what that is is
[1:21:41] God himself coming down and revealing to
[1:21:43] mankind that I have placed now the word
[1:21:46] of God entirely back into your hands you
[1:21:50] don't have any more Mysteries there's no
[1:21:52] more questions about this word it's
[1:21:54] completely open to you
[1:21:58] so how is he Leading the People
[1:22:00] today
[1:22:01] we can see that how he led the children
[1:22:03] of Israel and maybe some of the things
[1:22:05] in the past of how he's LED people but
[1:22:07] how is he leading people today and we
[1:22:09] know it's really quite simple it's
[1:22:11] according to Ephesians as we have read
[1:22:13] Ephesians chapter four but we know
[1:22:15] there's some people that would say that
[1:22:16] Ephesians chapter 4 ain't enough and
[1:22:19] that's such a sad statement because it's
[1:22:21] not true it's a lying devil it's a
[1:22:23] spirit and it's evil it's not good
[1:22:26] because Ephesians chapter 4 is the only
[1:22:29] way that we are to be perfected
[1:22:31] according to the word of God and we know
[1:22:34] the word of God says be ye therefore
[1:22:36] perfect as I my Father in Heaven is
[1:22:38] perfect and if we don't follow the word
[1:22:39] of God how could we ever expect to be
[1:22:42] perfected
[1:22:45] there's an apostle a prophet a pastor
[1:22:47] evangelist and a teacher
[1:22:49] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:22:52] for the edification of the body
[1:22:55] brothers and sisters we need to be
[1:22:57] perfect
[1:22:58] that's the call for our day how could we
[1:23:00] ever be perfect
[1:23:02] we could take and make a covenant with
[1:23:03] the Lord
[1:23:04] every day in the morning
[1:23:07] and we'll break that Covenant surely to
[1:23:09] goodness we'll break that Covenant we
[1:23:11] can make a covenant with another human
[1:23:13] being and surely to goodness likely will
[1:23:15] either come close or we will break that
[1:23:18] Covenant
[1:23:19] Covenant with God is not a man to God
[1:23:24] Covenant it's a God to God Covenant and
[1:23:27] the only way that we can have that
[1:23:28] Covenant is to take a look at that
[1:23:30] Pillar of Fire and and that picture of
[1:23:33] the cloud and say turn it right not just
[1:23:35] turn it right 90 degrees so I can
[1:23:38] actually have a better view of it but to
[1:23:40] recognize the right way of perceiving
[1:23:43] this picture and the right way of
[1:23:44] perceiving this picture is about
[1:23:46] Revelations it's not about the way that
[1:23:49] maybe we think about it brothers and
[1:23:50] sisters let's turn over to Revelations
[1:23:52] quickly as we have a little bit of time
[1:23:54] left I just think this is so powerful
[1:23:56] and maybe we'll get into it a little bit
[1:23:58] on Sunday Lord willing
[1:24:00] if you turn over to Revelations chapter
[1:24:02] 1
[1:24:03] . I know brother Branham talks about
[1:24:04] being able to see the picture of Jesus
[1:24:06] Christ In This Cloud and I'm not saying
[1:24:08] that we can't see the picture of Jesus
[1:24:10] Christ In This Cloud but I want to maybe
[1:24:12] just illustrate this picture of Jesus
[1:24:14] Christ In This Cloud because this is
[1:24:16] what brother Brandon was talking about
[1:24:17] when he says the white wigged one we
[1:24:20] know he had much discussion about that
[1:24:22] he talked to his Theologian friend
[1:24:23] Junior Jackson uh
[1:24:26] to have that Jack Moore exactly I
[1:24:28] apologize it was Jack Moore he said to
[1:24:30] him what was that and he said it was his
[1:24:32] glorified State and he couldn't
[1:24:33] recognize that he couldn't realize it
[1:24:35] until it became real to him it was a
[1:24:38] revelation that God gave him
[1:24:42] verse 13 of Revelations chapter 1.
[1:24:45] actually verse 12. and I turned to see
[1:24:47] the voice that spake with me and being
[1:24:49] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:24:52] and in the midst of the seven
[1:24:53] candlesticks one
[1:24:55] like unto the son of man clothed with a
[1:24:57] garment down to the foot and gird about
[1:24:59] the paps with a golden girdle
[1:25:01] and his head and his hairs were white
[1:25:05] Like Woe white as snow and his eyes were
[1:25:08] as a flame of fire brothers and sisters
[1:25:11] when we look at this Cloud I believe
[1:25:14] it's high tide we recognize what that
[1:25:16] cloud means what the signaling is for
[1:25:19] the ages of this world what it means is
[1:25:22] it's judgment time that's what that
[1:25:24] cloud means it's not time to say that
[1:25:26] God sent a prophet and everything is
[1:25:28] going to be just fine what it means is
[1:25:30] that judgment is set the books are just
[1:25:32] about open and everyone who was not
[1:25:34] found in the Lamb's Book of Life will be
[1:25:37] cast alive into the Lake of Fire
[1:25:39] we have been given an opportunity to
[1:25:42] recognize the position in which we live
[1:25:43] when we look at that picture we need to
[1:25:45] recognize this is God Almighty it's not
[1:25:48] some dirty old grandpa that's just going
[1:25:50] to say everything is fine I'm willing to
[1:25:52] wink now at your sin
[1:25:54] we need to walk forward with confidence
[1:25:56] and know that we can accept the word of
[1:25:58] God but he's given us conditions if you
[1:26:02] accept my word if you listen to the
[1:26:04] voice of the prophet and then accept
[1:26:06] what I say
[1:26:08] my voice my words will be in you
[1:26:13] and what that does brothers and sisters
[1:26:15] is it gives us the ability to stand and
[1:26:17] look at this Pillar of Fire And This
[1:26:19] Cloud this picture if we look at it
[1:26:21] right if we turn it right we can see him
[1:26:23] with eyes as flame of fire and hair
[1:26:26] white like well we can look in the face
[1:26:28] of judgment and say Lord be it unto me I
[1:26:31] know that I would never be able to keep
[1:26:33] this Covenant but the prophet of God
[1:26:34] said that you made a covenant and that
[1:26:37] it's your Covenant that's the only way
[1:26:39] that I could ever stand before you and
[1:26:41] face you with this kind of judgment
[1:26:44] called to another calling out of the
[1:26:47] first seal brother Branham says in its
[1:26:49] only is to be revealed in at this last
[1:26:52] day when the actual seal is broken
[1:26:56] to who
[1:26:57] not to Christ
[1:26:59] but to the church
[1:27:02] notice now
[1:27:04] he says oh my that just makes me tremble
[1:27:07] I hope that the church truly understands
[1:27:10] it see what I mean you people
[1:27:14] I'm going to call you bride see that
[1:27:17] you'll understand it
[1:27:20] something was happening there yes
[1:27:22] there was a real transition that was
[1:27:24] happening there brothers and sisters it
[1:27:26] excuse me it wasn't just that that he
[1:27:29] was saying I just want to make this so
[1:27:31] we're going to feel better and feel good
[1:27:33] God was saying something really
[1:27:35] significant to the entire bride of Jesus
[1:27:38] Christ to the church I no longer call
[1:27:40] you church I call you bride
[1:27:43] we know that in John 15 Jesus said
[1:27:46] henceforth I call you not servants for
[1:27:49] the servant knoweth not what the Lord
[1:27:51] doeth but I have called you friends for
[1:27:54] all things that I have heard of my
[1:27:56] father I have made known unto you he
[1:27:59] says ye have not chosen me but I have
[1:28:02] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:28:04] should go forward and bring forth fruit
[1:28:06] and that your fruit should remain that
[1:28:09] whatsoever ye ask of my father in his
[1:28:11] name he may give it unto you we talked
[1:28:15] about this this was one of The
[1:28:16] Inspirations over there was that you
[1:28:18] know the branches the the he said I am
[1:28:21] the vine and ye are the branches and you
[1:28:24] know what the branches are supposed to
[1:28:26] be purged and the ones that don't
[1:28:28] produce fruit what happens to them they
[1:28:31] get cut off and when they get cut off
[1:28:33] they wither away and sometimes that
[1:28:35] happens in the body of Jesus Christ we
[1:28:37] see folks they they wither away and
[1:28:39] there's nothing that we can really do
[1:28:40] about that except for pray for them and
[1:28:42] try and encourage them but brothers and
[1:28:44] sisters what the goal is is so that the
[1:28:47] branches can be purged when there's
[1:28:49] fruit on the ends of those branches then
[1:28:51] they're purged and we know that God
[1:28:54] wants to see fruit that will remain he
[1:28:56] doesn't want to see fruit that will just
[1:28:57] wither away and and come and go
[1:29:01] brothers and sisters we've been called
[1:29:03] out
[1:29:04] the pillar of fire in 1953 brother
[1:29:07] Bradham says he took not away the pillar
[1:29:09] of the cloud by day neither the pillar
[1:29:11] of Fire by night from before the people
[1:29:13] that's God's word now what was the angel
[1:29:17] was the angel of the Covenant and he led
[1:29:20] all the old things was a type of the new
[1:29:23] things to come you believe that
[1:29:25] scripture says so being a shadow Hebrews
[1:29:29] now as God led the children led the
[1:29:32] church in the natural in that day he's
[1:29:34] leading the church in the spiritual in
[1:29:37] this day do you believe it they were the
[1:29:40] people of God until they were called out
[1:29:43] of Egypt and then they become the Church
[1:29:46] of God for the word church means called
[1:29:48] out they were called out of Egypt and
[1:29:52] were called out of the world of peculiar
[1:29:54] people to serve God
[1:29:56] isn't it amazing brothers and sisters
[1:29:59] this was just blowing my mind when I was
[1:30:00] thinking about this and maybe it's just
[1:30:02] common and and I'm crazy but I'm happy
[1:30:04] right here so just leave me this way but
[1:30:06] isn't it wonderful to think that you
[1:30:08] know brother Branham says that here back
[1:30:11] in the children of Israel they were
[1:30:12] called
[1:30:13] out of Egypt
[1:30:16] what did he say here they were called
[1:30:18] the people of God until they were called
[1:30:20] out of Egypt but then they were called
[1:30:21] the church right but how many years was
[1:30:24] it since then that God came around and
[1:30:27] said now I no longer call you church I
[1:30:30] call you bride
[1:30:32] who has ever said that in the in the
[1:30:34] history of human beings on Earth
[1:30:37] only one man that I've ever heard of and
[1:30:40] that's William Mary and Branham but we
[1:30:42] know that wasn't the man saying that
[1:30:43] that was God saying that and you know we
[1:30:46] know one thing brothers and sisters this
[1:30:48] is sort of the encouragement that I'm
[1:30:49] I'm getting the inspiration for this is
[1:30:52] that simply this we know brother Branham
[1:30:53] says it in the message of the hour that
[1:30:56] all God was he poured into Christ and
[1:30:58] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:31:01] church and I want to say it this way all
[1:31:03] that Christ was he's poured into his
[1:31:05] bride because he's not pouring himself
[1:31:07] into a church that can't receive him
[1:31:09] there's vessels of honor and there's
[1:31:11] vessels of Dishonor there's people in
[1:31:13] the church worldwide that claim the
[1:31:16] blood of Jesus Christ but would say it's
[1:31:18] rubbish to believe that God sent a
[1:31:20] prophet in our day because the apostolic
[1:31:22] age is done and the way that you worship
[1:31:24] God under that that that ideology makes
[1:31:28] you a heretic but like I said brothers
[1:31:30] and sisters hey the way in which you
[1:31:32] call heresy that's how we worship God
[1:31:34] and you know what I'm happy just exactly
[1:31:37] the way that I am so if you see that I'm
[1:31:39] crazy just go ahead and leave me here
[1:31:41] but isn't it wonderful to think that
[1:31:43] there came a point in time where God
[1:31:45] actually changed the dispensation he
[1:31:47] changed the direction he changed the
[1:31:50] thought patterns to say you're no longer
[1:31:52] just a church you are the Bride of Jesus
[1:31:54] Christ you have come to a place where
[1:31:57] you need to recognize Who You Are
[1:32:00] we know that in Revelations 4 John was
[1:32:03] called to come up a little higher and
[1:32:05] that is the message of the hour brothers
[1:32:06] and sisters to recognize there was a
[1:32:08] door open in heaven when we are in the
[1:32:11] spirit on the Lord's day it's not a
[1:32:13] Sabbath it's not some place
[1:32:14] geographically that we're going to go to
[1:32:16] it's actually the revelation of Jesus
[1:32:18] Christ The Mystery of God revealed Jesus
[1:32:21] Christ The Mystery of God revealed the
[1:32:23] message of the hour and here we have it
[1:32:25] we are willing participants of this he's
[1:32:28] given us the ability to hear ears to
[1:32:30] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:32:32] churches
[1:32:33] we know that there was a group of bones
[1:32:36] in a valley
[1:32:38] I believe it was Isaiah was it Ezekiel
[1:32:40] I'm getting them mixed up now
[1:32:42] we know that there was a bunch of dry
[1:32:44] bones in the valley and we know the
[1:32:46] prophet of God said he was told speak to
[1:32:49] those bones speak to those bones he was
[1:32:52] first asked will those bones live again
[1:32:54] and he said I don't know you know and he
[1:32:58] said speak to those bones how could
[1:32:59] those bones hear they had no sinure
[1:33:01] flesh and we know that it's a
[1:33:03] supernatural anointing it's that same
[1:33:05] voice of God speak to those bones we
[1:33:10] have been given ears to hear what those
[1:33:12] bones could hear brothers and sisters in
[1:33:14] our day and you know that all God was he
[1:33:17] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:33:18] was he's poured into his bride today and
[1:33:22] you know I just want to say this what is
[1:33:24] the attraction on the mount 1965.
[1:33:27] brother Branham says that's what the
[1:33:29] attraction is the predestinated seed of
[1:33:32] God who can't do nothing else but follow
[1:33:35] it it means more than life to us take
[1:33:38] our lives but don't take that what is
[1:33:41] the attraction God God as usual
[1:33:44] fulfilling his word God himself coming
[1:33:47] down in a pillar of fire fulfilling his
[1:33:50] word God himself coming down in A Cloud
[1:33:53] by day fulfilling his word showing that
[1:33:55] there is going to be an opening of the
[1:33:57] seals showing that there is going to be
[1:33:59] a completion of the word that there's
[1:34:01] going to be a tying up of all of the
[1:34:03] Loose Ends and there's going to be a
[1:34:04] group of people that will say Amen to
[1:34:07] that word
[1:34:09] we know that there was Joshua and there
[1:34:11] was Caleb I was studying this these 12
[1:34:15] people they were called the Valiant ones
[1:34:19] oh God
[1:34:22] the ones
[1:34:24] who were the leaders
[1:34:26] brother Branham says the Elders of the
[1:34:29] church
[1:34:32] brother Emmanuel talked about this
[1:34:35] they were told to go spy out the land
[1:34:36] and they came back from the other side
[1:34:39] with the fruit of it
[1:34:41] and they threw it down and they said
[1:34:43] there it is
[1:34:45] but there's no way that we can take it
[1:34:47] because we're grasshoppers in the eyes
[1:34:49] of the Giants
[1:34:51] how did they know
[1:34:53] what the Giants saw
[1:34:56] how did they ever get that that that
[1:34:59] plug-in Revelation about what the Giants
[1:35:01] were seeing about them
[1:35:03] because we know the enemy
[1:35:05] they said when they when they went to
[1:35:08] the walls of Jericho remember Rahab the
[1:35:10] Harlot she said our hearts melt within
[1:35:14] us
[1:35:16] there was a different report
[1:35:18] but what was it it was it was that they
[1:35:21] were adding to the Revelation that was
[1:35:24] given to them in their day
[1:35:26] they were more willing to accept their
[1:35:28] emotions their own perceptions their own
[1:35:32] thinking their own ideologies then the
[1:35:35] word of God the way the prophet gave it
[1:35:37] to him
[1:35:38] even when they went and saw yes there's
[1:35:41] there's flowing milk and honey there's
[1:35:44] fruits that takes two men to carry
[1:35:46] everything the word says is there is
[1:35:49] there
[1:35:50] but we just can't do it
[1:35:52] brothers and sisters don't don't do
[1:35:54] ourselves out of a blessing don't say
[1:35:57] you can't do it say you can do it no
[1:35:59] matter what confess positive brother
[1:36:02] Branham says you'll never live above
[1:36:03] your confession
[1:36:05] so I just want to go here tonight and
[1:36:07] say this you know we have talked about
[1:36:09] bride to wife bride bride to wife we've
[1:36:13] talked about the bride and and how the
[1:36:15] Bride of Jesus Christ now is is is the
[1:36:18] one instead of the church how the word
[1:36:20] of God has come from the called out of
[1:36:22] God to the church to the the the the
[1:36:25] bride but brothers and sisters I think
[1:36:28] we've gone further than that now haven't
[1:36:30] we haven't we gone further than just
[1:36:32] being called The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:33] and don't get don't get nervous I'm not
[1:36:36] trying to change the Revelation but what
[1:36:37] I do want to say is there's coming a
[1:36:39] place where we're going to get to a very
[1:36:42] Pinnacle of the Capstone revelation of
[1:36:45] Jesus Christ himself in the body today
[1:36:47] and you know I just want to say it this
[1:36:49] way and this is what we said in the
[1:36:50] Philippines is that there comes a point
[1:36:52] in time where you have a wedding and up
[1:36:55] until that wedding ceremony you are the
[1:36:57] bride
[1:36:58] even during the wedding ceremony you are
[1:37:00] the bride at the rehearsal you are the
[1:37:03] bride when you're planning the bride the
[1:37:05] bride but you know what there comes a
[1:37:07] time when that marriage happens that you
[1:37:09] are no longer the bride that you're the
[1:37:11] wife that you are the same as him the
[1:37:14] twain become one
[1:37:15] they become one flesh so brothers and
[1:37:18] sisters we can no longer go forward
[1:37:20] saying that we are someday going to
[1:37:22] achieve this if we have received the
[1:37:24] message of the hour in its fullness then
[1:37:26] we are now married to Jesus Christ if we
[1:37:30] have received him in our lives
[1:37:32] Revelations 19 says let us be glad and
[1:37:35] rejoice and give honor unto him for the
[1:37:38] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:37:40] wife hath made herself ready how do we
[1:37:43] make ourselves ready by saying Amen to
[1:37:45] this message of the hour by simply just
[1:37:47] receiving it the way that God has given
[1:37:49] it to us I'm just going to call the
[1:37:51] musicians tonight I just want to
[1:37:53] encourage us for for 2023 brothers and
[1:37:56] sisters to no longer look at ourselves
[1:37:58] as the bride no no doubt that we are and
[1:38:01] some people are in different stages of
[1:38:03] their Journey but you know what if
[1:38:04] you've come to a place where you fully
[1:38:06] recognize the word of God and the
[1:38:08] message of the hour then you have all of
[1:38:11] the authority as our brother Jose says
[1:38:14] he creates a paycheck from his his job
[1:38:16] and he gives all of the paycheck to his
[1:38:19] wife because he fully trusts his wife he
[1:38:21] knows that his wife is no longer just a
[1:38:24] bride she is part of him she will look
[1:38:27] after everything the way that he wants
[1:38:29] it done she will never just go outside
[1:38:31] of his desires she'll say honey what do
[1:38:33] you think about this
[1:38:36] now what do you think if God has
[1:38:38] actually married us and given us the
[1:38:40] whole checkbook
[1:38:42] it's not just something that comes from
[1:38:43] Jeffersonville that we can just write
[1:38:46] out our desire and create a vision board
[1:38:48] and say you know Lord's going to do
[1:38:50] something for me here we can go on our
[1:38:52] knees and you know what sometimes
[1:38:53] brothers and sisters I'm sure as the
[1:38:55] Bride of Jesus Christ you've experienced
[1:38:57] this you go to go to prayer and before
[1:39:00] you even mention it God answers your
[1:39:03] prayer because he discerns the heart he
[1:39:06] is the discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:39:07] intents of the heart it goes further
[1:39:10] much further than just actually speaking
[1:39:13] with our voices when we follow his voice
[1:39:15] he knows us he knows our name he knows
[1:39:18] our hearts he knows our desires and he
[1:39:21] wants to see us happy he wants to see us
[1:39:23] Prosper he doesn't want to punish us he
[1:39:26] is a gentleman and you know brothers and
[1:39:28] sisters if we can just be in our
[1:39:30] position as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:33] and just take all of our cares to our
[1:39:35] husband and just ask his opinion of it I
[1:39:38] am sure that he will reward us
[1:39:40] accordingly
[1:39:42] I stand to our feet tonight God bless
[1:39:45] you it's good to be home
[1:39:47] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:39:49] tonight we thank you for your goodness
[1:39:51] to us
[1:39:52] Lord I pray that we could just father
[1:39:54] have the encouragement to recognize that
[1:39:57] Lord there's there's coming a day and
[1:39:59] and I believe it's by Revelation that
[1:40:02] that we will go from being just the
[1:40:04] bride to being your wife
[1:40:06] and father there's no time frame on that
[1:40:09] we have no pressure on anyone but father
[1:40:12] we will never live above our confession
[1:40:14] Lord and I pray that we could just Lord
[1:40:16] as we go forwards preach this gospel
[1:40:19] this message of the hour at the highest
[1:40:21] level father because that's what's going
[1:40:23] to change our body is the rapturing
[1:40:25] faith that lies on those tapes but Lord
[1:40:27] we know that rapturing faith that lies
[1:40:29] on the tapes will not Rapture those
[1:40:31] tapes that that raps rapturing faith
[1:40:35] that lies on those tapes has got to be
[1:40:37] in the hearts of men that you created
[1:40:39] that space for in their hearts Lord when
[1:40:42] that rapturing faith gets all the way
[1:40:44] into the hearts of men oh Father we know
[1:40:46] that that will Rapture human beings
[1:40:49] father and that's our desire today
[1:40:51] father is just to be more like you
[1:40:53] father we ask that you would just keep
[1:40:55] your hand upon us Lord pray pray that
[1:40:58] you would be with the panettas father
[1:40:59] while they're away that you would just
[1:41:01] bless their time the last few days
[1:41:03] father thank you for giving us safe
[1:41:05] passage home Lord father we pray that
[1:41:07] you would be with brother Justice while
[1:41:08] he travels Lord Jesus thank you for
[1:41:11] bringing our sisters back home to us
[1:41:13] father Lord Jesus we know that you are
[1:41:16] in control of all things and we thank
[1:41:17] you Father for leading us and guiding us
[1:41:19] Lord even through the valley of the
[1:41:22] shadow of death father we will fear no
[1:41:24] evil
[1:41:25] because we know your rod and your staff
[1:41:27] comforts us father we love you and we
[1:41:30] thank you we just ask that you would go
[1:41:32] with us now as we go our separate ways
[1:41:34] and if it Be Your Will for us to gather
[1:41:36] again on Sunday father Lord we'll be
[1:41:38] careful to give you all the glory
