know that it's only by your grace that we stand it's only by your grace that we have the ability to hear this word for our day and Lord Jesus we thank you for that we pray that you would just keep your hand upon us now as we go together through your word father as we just Lord as you speak to us along the way we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you today you may be seated I uh I just think it's wonderful wonderful to look at this word for our day and and really where we are today we've come many miles through many dangers toils and snares we have already come you know we've been talking about possessing our land possessing our inheritance and and walking into the promised land ourselves and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which really is all of the above the aforementioned our our promised land and our Holy Ghost our our promised land and our inheritance I mean is the Holy Ghost and we know brother Branham said that the Holy Ghost is the earnest it's the down payment of our inheritance because we know that when this body be dissolved we have a body already waiting and it's a tabernacle that's not made with hands it's one that's incorruptible it's our our treasure laid up for us in heaven and I think many times we can think about the treasure that's laid up for us in heaven and look at mounds of gold and and diamonds and gems and maybe a mansion up on the hill and maybe all of that's there but you know the greatest thing that we could ever experience is the ability to be able to hear the word in the age in which we live brother Bradham says the greatest Miracle you can type in greatest Miracle into the message of the hour and brother Bradham will say the greatest Miracle isn't being raised from the dead it's not being healed of cancer it's not being raised up from any illness it's being able to be transformed by the renewing of your mind to be able to be a new creature created in Christ Jesus to be able to receive the word for your day is the greatest miracle the transformation not the confirmation not to say that I go to a church and I I believe the way they believe so I know that I've got it and we're a happy group together that's not going to do it the greatest Miracle is being able to just take the word and say be it unto me according to Thy word and if I can't take maybe what I hear a pastor say I'm just going to spit that pit out I'm gonna throw that bone away and I'm just going to take the word of God and say hey he's going to want me to see it he's going to reveal it to me the way he wants it to be revealed but you know when we start to walk after the flesh then we start to actually spit out chicken with that bone and maybe a little bit of cherry with that pit and we don't want to do that brother Bradham says it very clearly you know what just go ahead and spit it out take out that bone if you don't want to eat a bone when you're eating chicken but look at it real good and make sure that it's just bone sometimes you get chicken that's cooked really hard and I'll never forget it I'll call them my African parents brother man told me in Africa he said I bet you like to eat soft meat don't you you like to chew soft meat and I said well yeah I kind of do while I was chewing through what I thought was a rooster a terribly old rooster it was so hard and he said you know we like to cook our meat really tough here in Africa and it just made me laugh but you know it might not be the way that I'm used to eating it but it doesn't matter if it's still chicken I need that protein in my body and if it's still the word of God we need to make sure that we're eating the word of God and we're not just throwing away the protein we're talking about possessing our land and you know I just thought it was a wonderful thought that possession we know we've heard it said carnally speaking is nine tenths of the law the children of Israel when they were on this side of Jordan when they were on the other side of Jordan when they weren't in the promised land they had nothing they had the god of Israel with them so they had everything don't get me wrong but they knew their destination was on the other side and once they were over there then everything was settled and we talked about it last week about how maybe sometimes when we have a situation in our lives if we can just change our perspective on the situation and zoom out and look at the situation from the pillar of fire instead of looking at the pillar of fire and and look at the situation from the cloud instead of just looking at it at the cloud we know the children of Israel we read it last week in Exodus when they were out of Egypt they had seen all the signs and wonders and they got themselves up against the Red Sea and up against the mountain and now Pharaoh's Army was coming after them and they started to murmur after Moses to say now you took us out of safety where we were just going to get beat every day and mistreated everything would happen to us anything could happen to us you took us out of that kind of insecurity to this now that we would die in the desert instead of saying you know what look at all the mighty miracles signs and wonders that he did there that same God has to be with us in fact look at that Pillar of Fire look at that cloud that's the one that's leading us but yet they got in the moment and started to look at the flesh to say oh no here comes the enemy oh no we're gonna die now we perish now what if we could just take a look at our situations from a different perspective I think it would be wonderful and I just want to try and encourage us to do that let's not look at the pillar of Fire Let's look from the pillar of fire because really that Pillar of Fire is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Elohim God himself the Holy Ghost choose your title it's the same one it's the same God but possession is nine tenths of the law and you know when we can get into our promised land when we can get the Holy Ghost in our life we know we've said it many times that the battle is just going to start but you know brothers and sisters it's not going to be a battle as we think and that's the beautiful part about it it's not going to be swords drawn and blood flowing it's not going to be that kind of a battle the Lord isn't going to see us destroyed Satan's going to come around and tempt us that's what's going to happen we're going to see Temptations all over the place but what's going to happen is we're going to be able to overcome them we're not going to be destroyed but Satan's going to say no no no now now you've gone all this way you've taken all the steps you've spread your wings of Faith now and you've given up all that you thought you had and you knew and you're going by faith now and and now you've got this problem where's this good that's what Satan's going to be saying and he's going to be saying yeah look watch what I want to do for you watch what I want to do for you in this situation and you know you might hear the Deliverance through listening to a tape you might hear it listening to a minister somewhere you might hear it from a minister from a Pulpit you might hear it in that still small voice but he will come and tell you you will not be destroyed I am I am I am the I am that met Moses in that burning bush I am the I am that went down and delivered the the children of Israel out of Egypt I am the I am that met Paul on the way to Damascus and I am the I am that was in that Pillar of Fire over William Miriam Branham and I am is here right now brothers and sisters and if we can just look at our situations through that Pillar of Fire isn't it wonderful that we were able to see that picture of the pillar of fire I remember the first time I saw it I thought it was a Halo and maybe it is and I remember watching cartoons when I was a little kid when when one of the characters would die it would be killed then he would just float up to heaven and go and sit on a cloud and he would have a Halo and it looked kind of like that Pillar of Fire so for me it was like man that makes perfect sense but it wasn't just so that we could start cartoons and and and be inspired to say that's what happens to us when we go to heaven and God is a good god and we can just get a Halo once we're we're good people and Christian folk that's not what it was about at all and the further I go with this the more I think my goodness how incredible is it to think that we had that visitation that we had that visible documentation God makes sure that Satan will Satan will be exposed but he makes sure that science will declare his life as well you know brothers and sisters today we're living under grace and we have it all isn't it wonderful to think that if we can look at at life through the pillar of fire and through the grace of God what do we have to fear what do we have to worry about there ain't no enemy there ain't no devil that can stand in your way he's going to try it but when you simply defy him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's got no Authority none No Authority you know I was thinking about that that view that perspective from the pillar of fire many times in the mornings my life is totally different now which I'm sure everyone is well aware of I don't have a business I'm not jumping in my truck and and racing to go and Chase the the renovation world like we used to every morning before light usually or just at light you know driving down the road and witnessing the sunset or the sunrise from my vehicle and and now I I look at it I Marvel usually the family goes to school Lisa's driving the the children to school and I have that moment looking at the Sunrise and it's just beautiful we're in a position where we've got such a a tremendous view to the East and and anyways it's So Glorious and I just had this thought this week speaking about you know the perception of of the pillar of fire looking at it from a different perspective altogether and and it was just simply this that you know we see that glory for a few seconds maybe a minute if we're lucky right we get that just be beautiful intensely magnificent Sunrise before us or the beautiful sunset before us one or the other is happening right we get that once in a while in our lives and it's just magnificent but what I got this week was simply this that you know what that's happening every single second all around the world it's not just once or twice a day which is what I always just sort of thought about assumed about but As the World Turns it's happening every second that's how magnificent our God is he can dwell in any position that he wants to and so can we brothers and sisters if we allow ourselves to that's the god that we serve he's encompassing the entire Earth all at the same time What a Beautiful thought it is I believe it's just an opportunity for us to have just a little glimpse of what eternity is like all encompassing time doesn't matter because it's all encompassed it's all in one moment it's just such a beautiful thought where are we going today brother Barry we're just just trying to settle in just trying to get going here get some traction you know we're talking about strongholds last week and and the scripture in in second Corinthians 10. I believe it's a real important one I believe that something real important happened last week and I believe that every single time we come to church like this something really important can happen in our lives if we want it to and you know brothers and sisters it all comes down to what we want out of a service what do we want out of a service what we want out of a service will actually pay back to us in what we put into it and you know I'm not even saying what you do when you're here what's going on Saturday night brothers and sisters are we getting ready for service Saturday night are we getting ready for service Friday night Thursday night Wednesday are we praying for service on Sunday are we thinking about this stuff if we are then we're going to get something out of it the devil wants to have strongholds but we know even though we walk in the flesh we're not worrying after the flesh so brothers and sisters today I just want to I just want to say this and I'll probably say it a few times maybe I did last week but you know as long as it's anointed we just need to keep preaching it and I just want to say this if we have something in our bodies in our minds in our Spirits that's causing us to war after the flesh you're in the wrong position you're doing it wrong we're doing it wrong because we're not walking in the flesh even though we're in the flesh we're not warring after the flesh the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but when we get in the carnality we're going about it wrong and what we're doing what we do when that happens is we give Satan a day off give him an hour off give them a week off sometimes sometimes as human beings will even give Satan a decade off because we just get in the flesh over someone and we just can't get past it you know brothers and sisters who wants to give Satan time off we're not dealing we're not dealing with the flesh the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal I just love the next part of this scripture of second Corinthians chapter 4 chapter 10 verse 4. but our our weapons are mighty through God our weapons are Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and those pulling down of strong holds aren't aren't the the Egyptians they're they're not the enemies the invites in the land they're devils they're devils in our land trying to get into our promised land and when we get into our Promised Land we're going to see devils and we're going to deal with them but it's a beautiful thing brothers and sisters because if we didn't have a struggle then Satan would have us if we're struggle and rejoice if you've got a struggle in your life clap your hands and Shout for Joy praise worship just like the redeemed would worship nobody in heaven can worship like the redeemed we have such an opportunity to do it here and remember we heard it said many times before you can look back at all of the times in the Bible and the and we read it in in in in Joshua the children of Israel coming out in The Exodus how many times did they win a battle every time except for one when there was sin in the camp but how did they win the battles God said just go out go to church in the morning and just array yourselves put yourselves in order follow all of the mechanics and when you're ready shout for Joy because then the Dynamics will come down and when the Dynamics comes down that's what takes the enemy out we want to take out strongholds brothers and sisters and as long as we're here in this flesh we're going to have strong holds in our lives and you know I've got them you've got them we've all got them but you know if we don't deal with them we're going to just make a provision for Satan to have his have his place in our lives I apologize for this this thing is problematic right now it's totally come apart on me oh boy we'll just go with it you know brothers and sisters we can say that we're in the Promised Land but if we're not careful this is what I want to get into today is that we can fortify instead of fortifying ourselves we can afford a fire enemy and it all comes down to what we feed on where do we spend our time you know brother brownie talks about the two dogs quarreling remember that story two dogs fighting he's talking to a Native American both these two dogs that fight and he says which dog wins and and the Indian the Native American tells them the one that he feeds the most the one that gets the protein and the bones and the cherries and the pits the one that gets it all he's the one that's going to win and you know that wasn't about the story about two dogs quarreling that was a a word stored up for someone in a certain day at a certain time in a certain season that was stored up food for a certain individual and I would say that would be me because I want to take it I want to say be done to me according to that word the two dogs quarreling which one wins whichever dogs gets fed the most you know what happens as human beings brothers and sisters guilty right here guilty of feeding the wrong dog and Satan is subtle he's the most subtle beast of the field that has never changed from the Garden of Eden Brothers and Sisters he'll come as a polished Slicker brother Bradham said look into defile whoever he can and we know we've worded or quoted it many times he says a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but we know that he's got no teeth that's what brother Branham said he's got no teeth but still it's kind of scary but if we're feeding the wrong dog then that dog is going to be the one that has power so let's just take that word dog out and say devil let's say spirit because we're either going to feed the Holy Spirit or we're going to feed the devil we're going to feed another spirit the Holy Spirit or another Spirit that's what's going to happen in our lives you know if we listen say Amen if we read Say Amen sing and shout and say amen and we just have the victory man we just have it like it's just on top of the world when we leave a service I guarantee you Satan is going to be sitting outside in the parking lot he ain't gonna wait till you get home he's going to be in the parking lot and there's going to be a text message there's going to be an update there's going to be another video dropped by someone something is going to be there to get our distraction our attention and it's going to get us but if we don't look at it he's not going to have any power over us [Applause] we can come and have the greatest victory in a service and then feed on anything inspired by Satan what happens is we forfeit the victory that we just got and there's make no mistake about it brothers and sisters there's Victory right here in this service we have seen them we have witness stuff we Are Witnesses of the victory of Jesus Christ today on Earth but Satan doesn't want us to have that Victory he wants to try and kick us he wants to try and make us feel condemned he wants us to have iniquity remember the word says because of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold so if we're waxing cold brothers and sisters what's going on it's the word of God but many times I feel like we can forfeit our Victory and I'm speaking from my own experience here and I just feel that's the only place that I can really preach from and I hope that it's somehow an inspiration we can forfeit our Victory by just feeding on the wrong thing by looking at the wrong thing remember Vex a lot vexed his righteous soul that righteous man the word says vexed his righteous Soul daily with what he saw and what he heard and what did he see and what did he hear brothers and sisters no doubt it was probably really polished it probably wasn't wasn't raging awful stuff he might have had just a a YouTube account he might have had a Facebook account he might have had some sort of other account some sort of other thing going on maybe he had a video game he had something that was controlling his time that was sucking his his mind power something was distracting him to Vex his righteous soul and you know it was it was appointed it was anointed for his day and make no mistake about it Satan is going to take everything and train it to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's going to take the jingliest thing the shiniest thing and try and get our attention with it brothers and sisters so if it's I just want to say it this way if it's inspired by God it's going to be about the word if it's not about the word I don't know I'll let you make that decision I would say ask the Holy Ghost in you what he says about that thing and see if he agrees with it and if he agrees with it then go for it but if he doesn't agree with it that's his grace to you for this day that's him saying to you just get in the boat just like Noah just get in the boat that's all you got to do is just put that thing away stop looking at that don't do that anymore and what will happen is you'll start to feed the right dog and then suddenly you'll have that strength in the moment where you don't you'll say man I wasn't even praying this morning I didn't even pray before I left the house today and and this thing that used to tempt me all the time now I'm seeing it bold-faced and it doesn't have any power over me how does that work because you're preparing you weren't feeding at the wrong Source but boy if you were feeding at the wrong source that Temptation comes up oh my it's a stumbling block you're just gonna trip and fall and then you've got iniquity and then you start to cycle over and over again if you ever wonder about this listen to why are people so tossed about brother Branham has two messages like that why are they so tossed about I would say it goes just like that with doors indoor brother Bradham preaches that in 1965 the only reason is because there's one's place in people's lives where they won't let him in they'll say you can go through anywhere in my house brother random talks about it you can come into my house just come into my house we we're so welcome to have you there he talks about what a pharaoh were to come by your house Pharaoh was going to say why I'd just like to come by your house and have a visit you'd be like wow honey we've got to dust the house we've got to clean the yard we gotta do everything clean the windows make it look great because Pharaoh's coming here and he talks about Adolf Hitler and just about how powerful these men were what if he came to the house and if it was a Nazi Soldier he would be like my goodness it's the viewer he's coming we need to make sure we have everything in order but what about God he says what about God when Jesus comes to our house what about Jesus when he comes to visit what do we do do we say welcome come on in we know he's talking about our house our house being our heart it's not our literal home but he uses a literal home as the example we can have the foyer set up just beautifully and take all of our trash and stuff it into the rooms and say you can come into the foyer that's as far as you can go or you can say no you're welcome to just go anywhere you want to go brother Branham talks about this and as he goes through the the message indoors and Dory talks about it in one place he says you know can I open just one more door I just love the way he preaches it he says can I just open one more door and he he actually opens I think three more doors after he says one more door but it's just a preacher's way of saying the service is going to end sometime I I'm gonna close soon you know and you have 20 minutes every time you say that sort of but he he says could I just go in one more door and he says this is the one that counts the most brothers and sisters I believe my personal life oh don't go there don't don't talk about my personal life brothers and sisters that's where we're going let's talk about our personal life because we should be the exact same person here that we are at home or in the grocery store or or wherever it is we go if we're not that same person or something wrong with our experience and we need to get back to the altar we need to get on the horns of the Altar and cry out to God for the baptism of the Holy Spirit we cannot behave the same way differently we have to behave the same way we have to be the same if we're feeding on something inspired by Satan that's going to cause us to behave differently for the brown amount of questions and answers number four 1964 he says somebody he somebody he had one one time he had one one time was converted received the Holy Ghost and he said to him how are you getting along and and he said pretty good and pretty bad oh my I don't think I can do this I just have to get this off bear with me all right I don't take my jacket off very much it's a good time it's a good opportunity for it this is uh not doing well for me today I apologize are we okay somebody told me he had one one time was converted received the Holy Ghost and he said to him how are you getting along he said pretty good and pretty bad and remember this is someone who got the Holy Ghost not just some random guy that's why I think this is important he said pretty pretty good and pretty bad he said well how how do you mean pretty bad and pretty good he said well since me received the Holy Ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog and said they argue all the time said they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad said well Chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one Chief feeds the most so I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you he takes it from being just a hypothetical thing out there to write down inside you right down home I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or spiritual nature after the things of God that does it I'm just going to say that last part there depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it where do we live brothers and sisters what what what one are we feeding in our lives because that's going to dictate the ability for us to be able to overcome in our day and you know we know we've already overcome but the only thing that's going to happen to us is we're just going to have a few extra bumps along the way because God's going to shake all of that carnality out of our lives he won't allow it to actually make its way there and that's why brother Branham talked about that's why God talked to us through brother Branham about the railroad company the railroad company will not put the seal on the door if it's not packed properly because that railroad company is going to be responsible for all the goods inside that's why God will not put his seal upon the human being until that person is willing to go right down to the foundation have that contrite spirit and actually make that relationship with God the solid foundation to start with and then go forwards and you know sometimes brothers and sisters it takes a little bit of dusting off sometimes we've got to go back and dig up sometimes we've got to get an excavator a giant loader in there something that they would have at a mine to clear all of the garbage in our life out of the way all the things that have piled on top of that one thing but once we get down to the foundation we can get that relationship with God right again once we do that you'll never have to say everybody raise your hands and now we're going to sing can we sing a little louder doesn't the music inspire you can I get an amen that's not going to happen because people are going to recognize the grace of God in their lives if you've had the new birth and you've been born again by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will not feed on the things of the world the Holy Ghost will not feed on the things of the world brothers and sisters you will not be able to serve God and Mammon at the same time that's what the word of God says that's what Jesus said he you will not be able to serve God and Mammon so whatever it is that we have as a as a time-consuming thing in our lives I just want to say it brothers and sisters is it of God or is it of the world because we can say that oh it's just of the world it's just of the world it's not of Satan remember what brother Branham said civilization is of Satan civilization is of the devil in our lives today he's going to come around as the most subtle beast of the field he's not going to come around as a great raging monster in front of us he's smarter than that he knows the Bride of Jesus Christ he just needs to be distracted so long as she's distracted she forgets who she is she forgets that she is literally the life of Jesus Christ on Earth in her day so long as she's distracted and doesn't recognize that he's got all the time in the world he knows that his time is short and then when the bride recognizes that when she comes to that realization she goes up and he comes down remember brother Branham said it when she recognizes when when it recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go oh you say no it ain't he says oh but yes it will yes it is that's the truth it's going to happen that way you won't be able to serve God and Mammon at the same time trying to serve two masters will drive a person mad if we're trying to serve two masters brothers and sisters what's going to happen we're going to have that wolf nature brother Branham talks about that dove in our life is just going to fly away and just allow that that that that dark dog in the fight that that call it other Spirit to manifest in our lives and that other spirit is going to have that wolf nature and he's going to growl and snap and bark because a person is trying to serve two masters you can't do that you can only serve one master at a time and you know when people are so tossed about it's because they're trying to serve two masters they really want to serve god brother Branham talks about it we'll probably read it quote in a little bit brother Branham says that there's two classes of Believers and then he correct corrects himself very quickly after that and says I correct myself there's not two classes of Believers I'm sorry there's actually two phases but I think it's important to recognize that there's a separation between the two one of them is carnal he says that's the difference carnal head knowledge it's all about what I know I I know the quotes I I understand the message of the hour I understand the Bible I can quote scripture after scripture but the dynamic power just ain't there why not because it's just carnal but boy oh boy when it makes that move from the Mind Into the Heart it changes things remember a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways you never want to get that reputation do you could be that person that will just flip you just don't know when that person is going to flip you know that there's two people there and you just don't understand when or where it could happen how it could trigger the reason it happens brothers and sisters is because someone's a double-minded person they're serving two masters at the same time and it makes them mad that's the word of God if you're serving two masters it will make you mad that's the word of God you can't escape that we can't escape it and I want to tell you brothers and sisters from experience it made me mad but thanks be to God for a pastor that would go on his knees and pray for the sheep that would just ask God to show someone a revelation about themselves because in doing so it delivered me I believe it delivered me I believe it showed me that I can't serve two masters I need to serve one and one only and by doing that it gives me the strength to overcome when I need it amen because brothers and sisters you know I thought for the longest time in my life that I need to be able to know the scripture so that I can just say when Satan comes around like a roaring lion I could just pull the sword of the of the word and and just stand and face Satan when he comes to me and be able to quote a scripture and be able to quote a scripture and be able to quote a scripture and be able to get rid of him and that will do him in and it will we know that's how Jesus defeated Satan but I believe it goes further than that brothers and sisters it goes much further than that that's where the denominational World lives we don't live in the denominational World remember I talked about it from the beginning pulling down strong holds in our lives and recognizing that we're not living in the carnal flesh we're we're living in the pillar of fire we should be looking at this world thinking there's no problem that's going to destroy us nothing can harm us sorry brother Daniel if I spit on you I really honestly don't mean to forgive me brother maybe one day I'll have to chew your gum for that we can't serve two masters at the same time it will drive us mad remember out of uh questions and answers Allah having a shadow 1954. Christian friend brother Branham says this a person cannot be born again till they receive the Holy Spirit and that's why I just harp on it I can't stop harping on it brothers and sisters it's the same importance just as it was for Noah and his day to get in the boat if we don't get the Holy Spirit In Our Lives then what we're doing is spinning our Wheels we're we're we're living in existence that's going to make us mad it's going to make us miserable you have to get the Holy Ghost in your life once you do get the Holy Ghost in your life brothers and sisters it's going to give you the ability to say Amen to every single word and what happens is you won't want to feed on the things of the world you won't want to feed on the carnality of this life you will want to feed on the word of God and the more that you feed on the word of God the more overcoming you're going to have in your life and the overcoming that you're going to have in your life is going to be from what you fed on yesterday and the day before and the day before those prayers then are going to be what rescues you today it's not going to be a prayer in the moment maybe it will be but remember brothers and sisters when life happens when you go through an intersection on a green light and you think that it's all fine and good and somebody comes and hits your vehicle and now you're caught between Heaven and Earth have you got the time to pray I remember going back to the hospital and the comment that came out in the truck with brother Ken that day was oh my there's times where you're sure glad your praying is already done because when you have something happen in your life it's too late you can't be born again until you receive the holy spirit so you can't you're not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost remember Jesus he told Peter feed my sheep do you love me Peter after everything that had happened he told them that you'll deny me three times before the crows no he'll never do that cut off the servants here so full of vigor I'm Gonna Save you you're not gonna die remember even having supper nobody will kill you I won't let them how bold he was how Brazen he was how on fire he was for the word in his day and what did he say to him he said get thee behind me Satan because it behooves us to fulfill all scripture the word has to be fulfilled and he had to go to Calvary but afterwards when he had risen and he had been around for about 40 days and and he said to him Peter do you love me oh yes Lord I love you feed my sheep Peter feed my sheep Peter don't don't don't get caught up in the isms in this world just feed my sheep Peter and we know that there came a time even when he was telling him that that he wasn't converted yet was he Peter was on the shore he saw Jesus risen from the dead Jesus fed them one more time fish and bread baked by a fire he was the one that jumped out of the boat to go and meet him so full of vigor but he still wasn't converted he needed to actually have a conversion and we know that every single person has to have that Upper Room experience they have got to go in that upper room and be just like every one of them even Mary his own mother had to have that Upper Room experience and brother Branham said that clearly that's where the the Catholics kind of went a little bit off maybe a lot off depending on who you're talking to or what you're looking at but but Mary was just like everyone else even though she was his mother she had to have that Upper Room experience and every one of us has to have that Upper Room experience you you are not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost I'm not say you're lost before you receive the Holy Ghost because you're not is what brother Branham says you're not lost it's one of those phases of Christianity that brother Branham was talking about your your your your either carnally looking at things or or you're looking at it spiritually brother random talks about it and why people are so tossed about the person who has carnal they're up and they're down and they're up and they're down they're still safe left somewhere throughout eternity they'll be saved maybe at the white Throne Maybe not maybe call them unwise virgin maybe not we would never want to put anybody in a category we want everybody to be saved as the Bride of Jesus Christ but we know that's not the reality we know that election has to stand but it's not up to us to determine who is elect and who is not that's up to God the only thing we need to do is preach this word and let the word do this sorting I just want to take a moment and say again talk about myself in front of everyone goodness it only can be real unless I experience it I guess I do want to apologize last week I think I came all maybe pretty hard about Facebook you know there's things in this world that we can be a part of and do that inherently aren't bad it's just what we allow them to turn into but I promise that Satan has created these things through men Satan has inspired men to create things for a purpose and that purpose is either to serve God or to serve the devil it's one of the other brothers and sisters that's it but we can use technology we can use phones we can use internet all for the glory of God but it's a very fine balance and although I came out hard about Facebook last week I just want to apologize not because anybody from Facebook called me I don't think I'm that important and I never would want to be but just for the simple fact is I don't ever want to tell anybody what to do I just want to say get the Holy Ghost and let him the spirit of Truth lead you and guide you into all truth let him give you the direction that you want to go in your life after service my wife and I we both deleted our account our Facebook accounts and you know I didn't really think it was that big a deal myself I know that it was consuming me but I didn't really think maybe I would need to delete it but I thought you know I don't I don't mind I it's not going to hold me I'm not going to say I have to have it if I just don't have it I have to have it to be able to demonstrate that I can overcome no no no no no no no no no I'll just say I don't need it it's that simple and and you know I've done that with a few different things in my life over time and I'll just give you an example brothers and sisters that it's such a it's just the devil if he can't get you on one front he'll get you on another he don't care what ditch you go into so long as you go into a ditch man he's going to push you one way or the other he'll push you or he'll pull you or he'll pull pull pull and then he'll just let go while you're pulling backwards and then you'll go that's why we need to know exactly what our footing is where we stand but you know I got rid of Facebook and some of the stuff that was popping up in the reels the short videos for me this is just me was music some of the old-fashioned music that I was into and I wasn't watching it streaming it saying you know whatever I would just see it there and I'd be like oh what's that song yeah I remember that song I used to play that game I don't know if anybody understands that there used to be a game a trivia game for music and I used to play it a lot and and so the the the the song that's playing is always something that I'm thinking about oh what song is that oh what song is that oh what song is that I bet I know it I better know it and you know fortunately I don't know the songs now that much but somehow Facebook got a hold whatever inspiration it is of some of that music that I used to listen to and started to send these things my way and I guess it's the algorithms if you click on it for a second it will actually capture that and then it will actually start to send you more and so here I find myself in this situation I'm thinking about this stuff I don't want to think about this stuff what am I thinking about this stuff for it's only because I looked at it what I'm doing is vexing my righteous soul with the things that I'm looking at and the things that I'm hearing so we delete it that's fine it's gone good praise the Lord I've got a victory there and you know it feels good feels good to think that you're taking a step by faith brothers and sisters if you haven't done it for a while or you've never done it I recommend trying it with something if something is in your life that you just think maybe you think you need check it out see if you really need it and see if you can just set it down and leave it alone we're going to talk about this a little further but you know just talking about myself here so what happened was I I use YouTube I use YouTube but I know they're linked now and everything is all one thing it's all working off of the same inspiration but what happens in YouTube suddenly I start getting all these things that was coming through on Facebook that I got rid of now it's filtering through on YouTube I'm like what is this here we go you know what I say YouTube and I will say this YouTube is very useful it's helped me fix Vehicles it's helped me fix appliances it's helped me build things it's helped me create things it's helped me with many different things we use YouTube to actually stream Services we use YouTube to Archive Services YouTube is a useful thing but not if you just don't use it properly and so what I found myself doing was not using it properly but you know really it's the inspiration that's behind it but I'm to the point where I'm prepared because I'm here I don't need to have YouTube in my phone in my life I don't need to have it really I suppose if I need to find YouTube I can look it up somewhere and go and look at a video but I don't have to have an update coming through all the time showing me that this thing is happening that's the devil though that's the inspiration let's try and keep everyone busy and keep them Afflicted keep them vexing their righteous Souls with the things that they see daily the sea and here but really what's what's getting our attention brothers and sisters this is what I want to get to I think you for me it's interesting because what's getting my attention these days is the screen time I'll say it openly it's my phone and the screen time and you know what I want to do is really kind of flush it down the toilet take it and drive over it with my truck maybe set it up in the backyard and shoot it with a shotgun forget about the television take the phone out and get rid of it but you know the way this world is set up is that we need them we have to have a phone to communicate so do you just get an analog phone that you can just dial numbers on maybe maybe some people need to go that far if you do God bless you I'm not going to judge anyone I wouldn't want to judge anyone only talking about my experience here but what consumes most of our time we're either feeding on the word or we're feeding on the world Matthew 24 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold you know I just think possessing our Promised Land possessing our inheritance brothers and sisters there's a little little thing that I remember brother Ken talked about one time and he talked about how the world has things out of order completely out of order the way the the world has things set up is that the children are number one the children are the ultimate in the family and and the wives are second in the family and the husband is third and and basically last in the world in the families and then Christ would be after the husband but that's the way the world has things set up and that's what Satan wants us to believe that's the way he wants us to live our lives but we know that it's Christ first in our lives right brothers and sisters it's Christ first then the husband then the wives then the children then the church I'm going to say that and that might be a little shocking but brothers and sisters we've got to be looking after our own Families First it's not up to the pastor to be a parent to someone's children although the pastor will certainly help the pastor will certainly encourage the pastor will be the one to be there for us when we need help but it's not the pastor's job to raise children it's not the church's job to raise children but you know in our in our families in our homes brothers and sisters I just want to throw this out there and I'm certainly open to discussion about it but just from my own perspective I started to think what would my priorities be if I had to prioritize what would I want to see them to be in my promised land with my family and I would probably try and encourage anyone who would be listening now to think about this that it should be Christ first number one in your life should be Christ number two should be your family number three your job because you got to provide for your family if you ain't providing for your family brothers and sisters we know what the word says you're worse than an infidel Paul said that if you're not working how are you eating how could you possibly be eating food if you're not working Christ Family job congregation the body the church and then Hobbies if you've got things you want to do screens you want to view places you want to go to whatever it is you want to do we all have different things in our lives we've all been created differently to be who we are that's the bouquet that God has created different flowers different different characteristics sometimes I think that myself I could get those out of order and I've had them out of order I've had my job number one my business because you don't know what it means to have your own business when your own when you're in business boy you're moving and shaking you don't know what it means to be in business to work 16 hours a day and and to not be able to be home to put the kids to bed and and to do all of that you know brothers and sisters that's a choice it's a choice and you know it's not a choice when you're in the midst of it it's a choice to actually go and do that to say I want to have my own business and that's the Trap the devil gets he sets that chap he loves it when people get so busy I think that I would never have my own business again if something changed and I wasn't a pastor anymore I'd probably go and be the best employee there ever was in the whole world you tell me what to do and I'll do it and that'll be it then I'll go home at the end of the day and I'll be dad to my family and husband to my wife but if I did ever have a business I wouldn't run it I wouldn't be the one doing it I would have it set up in such a way that somebody else would be doing it because what happens is that business stops you stop running the business and the business starts to run you if you don't have it set up that way but you know the reason I say this brothers and sisters because the church is made up of families that's what makes a body of Believers that's what makes the church husbands and wives where they have children and the children grow up and we raise them up according to the word and the fear and the admonition of the lord it's about having families because we know that Christ he wanted to have a family that was one of the attributes that he wanted to express address and brother Brad I'm talking about it and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he talks about that he wanted a family he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a husband he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a savior and he's every one of those brothers and sisters remember that habits in our lives are spirits in our lives habits are not just genetic things that we get in our lives and we just do it habits are something that are learned something that are created and it's either going to be a habit for the word or a habit for the world one or the other is going to happen in our lives in our flesh and you know it's I think it says that it takes 21 days to create a habit and 21 days to break a habit Just For Something free on the side to think about if you've got something you want to get rid of just try 21 days without it and if you do that carnally speaking likely you're going to overcome it but if you go and look at it again guess what's going to happen you're going to be right back to where you were but if you're talking about spirits brothers and sisters if you have been delivered of a spirit for 21 days you've been free of that Spirit you've been swept out and garnished that spirit is coming back around and he's going to check and see if that door is open and if that door is open what's going to happen he ain't coming in alone he's going to bring seven friends that are worse than he was we got to make sure that if we get the victory in our lives brothers and sisters we apply the token that's what the victory truly is in our lives is the token when we get that we got to make sure we apply it that's where brothers and sisters I can't say it enough the husbands and the fathers of the home it is our responsibility to make sure we apply that token in our homes because our whole entire family depends on us my goodness Spirits are habits habits are spirits questions and answers while having a shadow let's see did you believe that God gives the Holy Spirit to everyone that is truly born again Christian at the time they accept salvation or do you believe that this is a different work of Grace that in the experience of most Christians comes later please clarify this subject as many are confused because of the different teaching on this subject now if I don't answer this correctly well then you ask me and I'll put it on my desk for tonight and I'll get a hold of it now Christian friend a person cannot be born again until they have received the Holy Spirit so you can't you are not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost I'm not say you're lost before you receive the Holy Ghost because you're not there's only one work of Grace one work of Grace that's the Holy Spirit and it's in three manifestations and we know it's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he just doesn't say it here father Son and Holy Spirit one God only one now there's three works of Grace but three manifestations there's a manifestation of justification by faith a man believes God says yes sir I'll believe that believe that there's a true God and now for my personal savior I accept Jesus Christ his son as my personal savior now that's what's called justification by faith which the disciples received at first remember the disciples that's as far as they went until they went into that Upper Room and we're not looking at anything different today we got to go into that Upper Room brothers and sisters goes on to say now watch the next thing this man will go out today he might Smoke Drink curse do things that his habits is hanging into him it's just rooted in there it's spirits habits are spirits so I'm just going to step back and I'm just going to change it up a little bit here and say that today he might smoke he might drink he might curse you know as Believers we don't do that we don't go out to the bar room and drink and then go to the liquor store afterwards and pick up a bottle and take it home for safe keeping and make sure that we always have liquor to feed that Spirit that's in us we don't always have cigarettes on hand to make sure that we can feed that that demon of cigarettes but what is it that actually we have in our lives brothers and sisters our personal life Brother Brad I'm talking about that indoors indoor our personal life he says oh don't go there but you know brothers and sisters we've got to go there that's what's going to be the key to our overcoming in this day is our personal lives what are we doing in our personal life what do we look at in our personal lives who are we when we are alone because that's exactly who we are before God even though he has a perfect picture brothers and sisters what I'm talking about is in our hearts when we try and go to God In Prayer if we've got iniquity in our hearts because of what we're looking at and what we're seeing and what we're hearing how are we going to be able to go with confidence but boy when we can go with confidence in our lives that's why so many people are tossed about brothers and sisters they just they keep one door closed there's only one place uh you can go through the whole entire life you can you can see my whole entire house you can go into the attic you can go upstairs you can go downstairs but I've got one safe room and you know what brothers and sisters maybe it's only a little safe in one corner of the house just one place that only I've got the combination to nobody else has it you know what that's not enough we've got to be willing to show God every single Speck of Our Lives there's got to be no personal life in in the life of a Christian not that we say to everyone just take a look at all of my my my laundry room here it's not about that it's about surrendering unto God and saying be it unto me according to Thy word if you want me to stop that I'll stop that if you want me to start that I'll start that if you want me to do something I want to do that but if we got a habit in our life I want to say check it and see is it of God or is it of the devil is it of the word or is it of the world habits are spirits and you know what brothers and sisters here's the thing if we have been Justified if we have been swept out fixed up cleaned out given the Holy Ghost in our lives if we don't apply that token I believe the devil will come back around and he'll see if we've been delivered and if we haven't applied that token we've got to do it ourselves he'll come around and he'll give us the token but we've got to apply that token we've got to be able to hold that token out brother Branham says it even we got to hold that token over our prayers we got to show Satan I've got the token in my life you can't do this anymore you used to be able to but now I've got the token if we're not careful those Devils will come back and they'll take those habits and they'll just be another habit for a little while and then they'll actually increase then they'll increase and then they'll increase and before long those little habits will become addictions and brothers and sisters doesn't have to be a heroin addiction does it you know what they call called me what they would have called me in the world and they still would I mean they call people this functioning alcoholics they go to work and and they go home and they pay bills albeit late usually and and not very well but they just sort of function in life but a raging alcoholic but nobody from the outside would ever know it because they hide it they don't want anybody to see that little devil they've got that personal life but you know what Spirits are habits and if we've got something in our lives brothers and sisters if we're not careful it can become an addiction it doesn't have to be like I said a heroin addiction or an alcohol or addiction or a smoking addiction it can be a video game addiction it can be a Facebook addiction it can be a a YouTube addiction it can be a shopping addiction it can be an Amazon addiction there's many different addictions in our lives the devil doesn't care he just wants to get us addicted on something other than the word out of this why are people so tossed about brother Adam says it you find them people who seem to be very religious seems to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled or Anchored In Christ and this I have learned to be inexperience that it is people of intellectuals remember though we walk in the flesh we're not worrying after the flesh brothers and sisters we're talking about strongholds in our lives and the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God Mighty through God to tear down that strong hold of an intellectual Spirit to think that because I can read the quotes and say Amen to the quotes that it's going to be okay there's got to be an action in our lives there's got to be something that shows the world around us whose side we're on that's why we go to church on Sundays because we show Satan whose side we're on Liberty says now speaking this there's two two different types of Christianity seems strange but I'll not say two different types I said classes earlier forgive me two different types uh brother Brown I'm speaking here I'll say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types two phases the same Christianity but two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has give the man in his heart excuse me it's an experience that God has given a man in his heart the one intellectually is hungering he's feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be why are you laughing brother Barry no trials no storms bothers them at all how many have trials how many have storms but the Branham says but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of Christian the difference is brothers and sisters is that longest journey that we've talked about the longest journey that any human being will ever take is from having the intellectual knowledge of the word of Jesus Christ being a savior of Jesus Christ revealing himself in in in in his people of of the word being made flesh and manifest to us in our day that that intellectual knowledge that God sent a prophet that intellectual knowledge going from the intellect in the mind all the way down into the heart that 18 inch travel the longest journey that a human being will ever take in their lives is being able to accept that word in their hearts it's that little space that we talked about that's only created in a human being in a human heart for God himself he created himself you know there's a there's a quote here I think it's just beautiful I just want to say it I I just think it's wonderful because brothers and sisters really what we're talking about is not just overcoming not just being good Christian folks not just saying that I believe the message of the hour and I can overcome it goes from from being the good Christian that can overcome and and have a storm or a trial and never really be moved it goes from from that I believe to recognizing who we really are the Bride of Jesus Christ when I I think of someone like maybe Mr Trudeau who would be the prime minister of Canada if we could think about him and his wife Mrs Trudeau there's a reverence about her something that we would say wow that's Mrs Trudeau right Imagine The Bride of Jesus Christ when she speaks he's spoken or she's not the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Branham says this in questions and answers Cod 1964. I love it because for those people who are the the quotationists and and want the progressive revelation this is near the end of his ministry here in 1964. brother Branham says please explain people are saying brother Branham is more than a man he can create and Jesus can look just like brother Branham now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know but I am your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you I love this he says now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told me this now brother Branham could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that so he kind of belabers this goes on to say one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong now if we think about that there was a time in brother bradham's Ministry where they started to call him Christ Branham and there's still a spirit Spirits don't die people around the world trying to do that now but when brother Branham was alive they started to baptize in the name of brother Branham and I just was thinking about it I can't I think it's astounding I had never would have believed it but I heard someone pray in the name of some other man recently someone sent me a video and and the man was praying a fervent prayer and he sounded like a message believer but it was in the name of another man and I was like wow but it's true Spirits don't die they're very much alive we know brother Bradham when they started to do that they started to baptize in the name of of brother Branham William Branham baptized in his name that he said you know what when you do that you make me Antichrist and it was before the seals were open it was very timely on Satan's behalf wasn't it but he took himself off the field and set field and said you know what I won't be ministering as long as people are doing this if this is the way they're going to behave about my Ministry I'm off the field I'm done it's not going to happen until they corrected that error and he corrected it by saying that you are Antichrist it's not going to work for you to behave that way and that's what he's talking about here for people to say that you're Christ Branham that it's going to be something like that in one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory and he will come again in great power and Glory but people are looking for a different type of coming of great power and Glory just like they were in the days of Israel they were looking for someone to come and deliver them out of the hand of the Roman occupiers they were looking for that and it was a scripture we know that but they weren't realizing what was happening in their day and it's the same thing for us today they think that he's coming in great power and great Glory today that he's going to walk on earth and he's going to destroy the enemies and take his bride and and take her home he's going to meet her in the clouds the people who aren't a part of this word for the day they're not going to see him they're only going to see him in you and I brothers and sisters that's it he says here to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist for that person of the Lord Jesus is setting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him that's exactly the truth did you catch what he said there in one sense it's completely wrong and you make me Antichrist to say that I'm Christ but in another sense if his life is upon me and upon you then it's exactly true then it makes you Christ but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him that's exactly the truth he says this and you become Christ this is his words here and you remember my message on Messiah Etsy you are the word Messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one see and that's what I want to get to today brothers and sisters it's our perspective if you become the anointed one that you go from looking at the pillar of fire you go from looking at the cloud to being in the cloud to being in the pillar of fire to looking at the world and the situations of this world from a totally different perspective that nothing is going to bring you up and nothing is going to bring you down because you know exactly whom you have believed and that he is able you become the anointed one and he says you become the anointed one see then there's all kinds of anointed ones and you know we have heard the message said that there's false anointed ones at the end time and this is why people get so weird when you start talking about this because there are false anointed ones at the end time but you know brother Bradham says you have a way to tell who they are you can give them the word test you can take the word and see if they line up with the word and brothers and sisters if if they are weird but they line up with the word then say Amen to it every single time because that's the way God works his children are not normal polished perfect individuals in this world they are in that world but in this world they're Fanatics that's who his children are in this world the people that truly got the holy ghost in the upper room how did they come out remember they said it's the middle of the day but they're stumbling like drunk people are we going to behave normally I don't think so we're going to worship like we're redeemed like we know what he's done for us to recognize that our souls the elect of God hang over Hell by one chain brother Bradham says it that a chain is as strong as its weakest link but you know brothers and sisters we don't have a weak Link in our chain we just need to recognize that those links aren't our our humanity and and that's where we feel like maybe we fall down because we we think about our humanity and and our our faults and failures as links in that chain they're not the links in the chain are the word of God telling us that though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh the weapons of our Warfare are Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds by taking every single thought that would come into our minds into captivity and and The Obedience of Christ and saying that idea that I have is it from God or is it from Satan and if it's from Satan I'm going to discard that thought and I'm not going to pursue it any further but if it's of God I'm going to say Amen to that thought and I'm going to pursue that thought maybe it's to phone someone maybe it's to go to church maybe it's to go on my knees and pray Maybe it's just to Rejoice at the Sunrise that he's given me today because it's another one that it's a gift from him to see but you know what brothers and sisters you are a messiah it if you have his Spirit In You And there's no way around that that's the way it is for our day but you know when we are in our Promised Land there's still an enemy going to be in our land and this is where it becomes treacherous this is where we become confused when we get to trial when we get the storm when brother Bradham was talking about the trials and storms but those people are never upset those are the Christians that understand that that he's brought me through many trials before and he's brought me through many storms before and I know who is in my boat and all I have to do is just ask him to come on the scene for my situation because he wouldn't have given me that situation if he didn't want me to invite him into that situation he's testing to see that I am who I say I am and you know what we we if we have any questions about that just go back and read the very first chapter of job go back and read that the very first job chapter one the very first beginning part of it I don't know if it's the 10 verses the beginning of job God seated in heaven having a conversation with Satan the sons of God come and present themselves before the Lord right before the throne and Satan he comes in there too and he says oh hey Lucifer where you been uh what's going on he says you know I've been up and down through the Earth checking things out doing my business and he says to him have you considered my servant now you could put your name in there that's no different for job to us have you considered my servant it's time for him to get a test and we know God doesn't hang things on people I think it's tremendous talking about this this Wilson Rory um how how how tremendous his Revelation is as someone who has maybe denominational he said I know God didn't put this disease on me God doesn't put disease on people Satan does I don't know if Sister Stella did you tell him that I was shocked when I heard that though I thought my goodness he's got a revelation this is a man that can't even move he can move his head that's the only thing he can do and he can breathe and he struggles to do so he said he wants to get baptized I said we can do it he said I might want to wait till spring time I think and then I want to wait till spring time but I don't think I'm going to last until Springtime because I can already feel it now moving into my my body my chest all of this ALS is moving in there and I can't hardly breathe now so I don't think I'll make it till spring time and so I said to him you know don't worry God knows your heart you can't make it to be baptized in water that's okay people receive the Holy Ghost without water God knows your heart brother don't worry about it and I just prayed with him I said you know Lord just just let peace like a river flood his room just just let it come into his room in such a way that just just overpowers him but I said to him you know we have we we serve a God you know what I'm going to call the musicians I'm going to start getting expired here here we go I'll maybe call the the family as well if they'd like to uh dedicate the baby brother David but uh talking to him in his room and and telling him I thought you know I'll just have a word of prayer with him I asked him can we just have a word of prayer and so we did we had a little word of Prayer before we prayed though I said to him you know something spoke to me and said encourage him and I was like man how am I going to do that what am I going to do I'm on the Fly I gotta think about this and then suddenly I don't have to think about nothing I don't have to take one thought for what I should say that thought entered my heart and then you know what I just started to speak and I said hey you know what I want to tell you something the god that we're talking about getting you baptized unto he's a God that I've witnessed with my own eyes raising the Dead I have witnessed that with my own eyes he's a God that I have witnessed healing of breast cancer with my own eyes in this church I have witnessed both of those things this is the god that we're talking about getting you baptized unto and he was like well can't you get me baptized can't you just baptize me with this special water that my sister's Church sent me from Idaho and I said I probably could but I don't think there's enough of it there it's a bottle that was sent there of blast water I said we need full immersion and he said you know I don't know what we can do about that I'm not sure how we could ever do it you got to remember this guy's laying flat out he can't move his feet he can't move his arms he can only move his head how is he going to get from his place to water back to his place again and still be alive I'll tell you I've been scratching my head but I asked the Lord and he showed me a place there's a place for people with special needs to get into a warm pool he said to me how am I going to do it who's gonna dry me off who's gonna change my clothes I can't do any of that I said brother we're not talking about this carnality here we're talking about baptizing you unto that God remember I said there's people that would truly help you if you want to be helped there's a whole body of people that actually work in the health care industry and if you want to get baptized we'll sort it out we'll figure it out brother you don't have to worry about it and we went to prayer in that man's room and my goodness if the spirit of God didn't just come in that room just flood that room and I said to him you know I'm not going to talk anymore because I am a preacher and I'm just getting started I feel like I could really talk now so I'm just gonna bow out have a good night and I'll give you a call on Monday so brothers and sisters if anybody wants to help if the opportunity presents itself please let me know we I think we'd probably need three three strong men maybe a sister or two maybe just a man I don't even know how to do something like this maybe just brothers I don't know but we might have a baptism for someone with ALS before they go out of this world and just to think the man has this kind of a revelation I might not make it till spring but I want to get baptized is what he said I know that I'm probably gonna die and I don't know how I'm gonna figure all this out and I said don't worry we'll figure that out you just make sure you want to get it if you want to get it then we'll do everything we can brother remember Wilson Rory in your prayers I'm going to phone him tomorrow and we'll see what the Lord wants to have done maybe stand to your feet with me this morning as we as we close the service our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus today we
