[48:14] that we've done it all or that we have
[48:16] it all father Lord we need you tonight
[48:19] and we just want to ask Lord that we
[48:21] could present our bodies as a Living
[48:25] Sacrifice Lord Jesus we know the high
[48:28] priest could not go behind that inner
[48:30] Veil without having everything right and
[48:33] father we recognize whose presence we're

[53:53] world in North America anyways likes to
[53:57] Revel in the theory of Halloween
[54:00] and death and hell and the grave is just
[54:04] abundant you don't have to go looking
[54:07] for it in fact you have to hide your
[54:08] eyes from it in the world in which we
[54:11] live in it's terrible but that's the
[54:13] world we live in so we have decided to
[54:16] try and do something for uh families and
[54:18] for children if you are available I sent
[54:21] it out on the WhatsApp the information
[54:23] and if you have any questions by all
[54:25] means um just let me know and we would
[54:28] love to just get together and have a
[54:30] little Fellowship tomorrow night we got
[54:32] a prayer meeting coming up next Thursday
[54:33] 7:30 p.m. and uh I believe the youth
[54:36] meeting will be on the
[54:38] 17th of November as well and uh yeah are
[54:44] you happy
[54:45] tonight it's wonderful to know that we
[54:47] are in his presence the king of kings
[54:50] and Lord of
[54:51] lords you know I just got thinking about
[54:53] it and uh it's been a while since I read
[54:55] this so I just thought I would go back
[54:57] to to this and uh I know that there's
[55:00] people that watch this online and maybe
[55:02] some that are streaming people don't
[55:04] understand many times what it is we're
[55:06] reading this book was uh penned by
[55:10] William Mariam Branham and uh basically
[55:13] it's what we believe as what we would
[55:15] call the message of the hour in essence
[55:18] in this in this book and we know that he
[55:21] had uh Theologian grammar tize it is the
[55:24] way that he worded it and that would uh
[55:26] we would probably say he edited the book
[55:30] but you know this isn't a man looking to
[55:33] draw a man unto himself he is simply
[55:37] pointing people to Christ and the very
[55:39] last page in this book is what I want to
[55:42] read starting with uh in the book I have
[55:45] here anyways it's paragraph 73 and and
[55:48] for anybody that's interested I'll just
[55:50] show you um this is the book that I'm
[55:53] using if you don't have one and you
[55:55] would like one I can certainly provide
[55:56] you with one um it's from Brother George
[56:00] Smith he produced this book and uh we
[56:03] ordered them directly from him but at
[56:05] the end of it um it's the uh third last
[56:09] paragraph of the exposition of the seven
[56:12] Church ages and I believe it's the
[56:14] resume of the ages brother Bram he says
[56:16] so we conclude the seven Church ages
[56:18] saying only what the spirit said to each
[56:21] age he that hath an ear let him hear
[56:24] what the spirit saith to the church
[56:26] es now this is brother bradam just I
[56:30] believe speaking his heart here he says
[56:32] I sincerely believe that the spirit of
[56:34] God has been speaking to us not only
[56:36] teaching us the truths of the age but he
[56:40] has been Faithfully dealing with hearts
[56:43] that they may turn to
[56:45] him that is the reason for all the
[56:48] preaching and teaching for it is the
[56:50] preaching and teaching of the word that
[56:53] the sheep hear the voice of God and and
[56:56] follow
[56:57] him not for one moment do I bring a
[57:00] message to the people that they may
[57:03] follow me or join my church or start
[57:07] some
[57:08] fellowship and
[57:11] organization now I'm just going to
[57:13] highlight that part right there or start
[57:15] some fellowship and
[57:17] organization that Dov tales with what
[57:20] we're going to talk about tonight in the
[57:22] sardan church age this is Brother
[57:24] brandham giving instruction here not for
[57:26] one moment do I bring a message to the
[57:29] people that they may follow me or join
[57:32] my church or start some fellowship and
[57:36] organization I have never done that and
[57:39] will not do that now I have no interest
[57:42] in those things but I do have an
[57:45] interest in the things of God and people
[57:48] and if I can accomplish just one thing I
[57:51] will be satisfied that one thing is to
[57:54] see established a true spiritual
[57:58] relationship between God and Men wherein
[58:02] men become New Creations in
[58:05] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[58:08] according to his
[58:11] word I would invite plead and warn all
[58:16] to hear his voice at this time and yield
[58:18] your lives completely to him even as I
[58:21] trust in my heart that I have given my
[58:24] all to him God bless you and may his
[58:26] coming Rejoice your heart I just think
[58:30] it's such a wonderful wonderful
[58:33] description of the message and and you
[58:35] know sort of who William branam we'll
[58:38] say is because we know he's not
[58:40] dead but who he was when he was here on
[58:43] Earth he wasn't looking to start an
[58:45] organization he wasn't looking to create
[58:48] an organization and and a fellowship and
[58:51] have a bunch of people join the brandham
[58:53] Tabernacle and many times he even
[58:55] rebuked the brandham Tabernacle just
[58:57] like he did the denominational churches
[58:59] and said everybody needs to get right
[59:01] with God we need to be looking at Christ
[59:04] Christ Jesus is the one that died for
[59:06] our sins not William Mary and bradam and
[59:08] not for one second do we claim that
[59:10] William Mary and bradam has anything to
[59:12] do with our Salvation other than an
[59:15] introduction to the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:18] amen just like elaser was sent to find
[59:22] the bride for
[59:24] Isaac we left off last week with uh
[59:28] where was it here oh my the last
[59:33] subheading was the
[59:34] salutation and tonight we're going to
[59:36] pick up with a
[59:39] denunciation that's out of Revelations 3
[59:42] verses 1 and
[59:43] two says I Know Thy works that thou Hast
[59:46] a name that thou livest and art dead for
[59:51] I have not found thy works perfect
[59:53] before God I just think that's speaks
[59:56] volumes right there we know brother Bram
[59:58] says it that every single Church age
[1:00:00] bleeds into the other and all of this
[1:00:03] applies to every single Church age it's
[1:00:06] not exclusive to the sardan church age
[1:00:08] even though it's brought out from the
[1:00:10] sardan church age and highlighted from
[1:00:12] the sardan church age it applies to
[1:00:14] every single age these words I Know Thy
[1:00:17] works that thou Hast a name that thou
[1:00:19] livest and art dead for I have not found
[1:00:22] thy works perfect before God there's
[1:00:24] only one thing that's perfect before God
[1:00:27] who knows what that is his Spirit only
[1:00:30] one thing we have his Spirit we have
[1:00:33] that Perfection that he's looking for
[1:00:36] outside of that our our our
[1:00:38] righteousness is but filthy
[1:00:40] rags now he says now here indeed is a
[1:00:44] very strange thing in every age to this
[1:00:49] point the spirit has first of all
[1:00:52] praised the True Believers and then
[1:00:54] denounced the false Vine but in this
[1:00:56] period there is evidently such wanton
[1:00:59] disregard for the Lord and his word that
[1:01:02] the entire message to this fifth age
[1:01:04] rings with
[1:01:06] condemnation my I Know Thy Works what
[1:01:10] were these works that came up before the
[1:01:13] Lord and caused his
[1:01:15] displeasure well you know that each age
[1:01:19] lapped over into the next age so we have
[1:01:22] a continuation of the works of the
[1:01:25] fourth age age into the fifth these
[1:01:28] works as you are well aware were number
[1:01:33] one the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:35] was superseded by a human
[1:01:38] hierarchy number two the pure word of
[1:01:42] God and its free benefit to all men was
[1:01:46] deposed for Creeds dogmas Church orders
[1:01:52] ETC number three the word Worship in the
[1:01:56] spirit and gifts of the Spirit and all
[1:02:01] that which pertains to True Community
[1:02:04] Fellowship of the Saints was cast aside
[1:02:08] for Liturgy and literal idol worship
[1:02:13] Pagan feasts
[1:02:16] ETC number four Mary ol tree was
[1:02:21] assuming a greater place in the
[1:02:23] Christian worship until she had actually
[1:02:26] assumed a place of godhead and the son
[1:02:30] was brought from his lofty position of
[1:02:34] overall to being subservient to a man
[1:02:38] called the pope who termed
[1:02:41] himself the Vicor of
[1:02:44] Christ it's so interesting when you look
[1:02:46] at the the pictures
[1:02:49] of of uh marol Tre for a while I uh you
[1:02:55] know how you can follow things online
[1:02:57] for a while while I saw something
[1:03:00] Catholic pop up and so I thought you
[1:03:01] know I'll follow that I'll just see what
[1:03:04] what that is what what pops up and and
[1:03:06] the pictures continually are of the
[1:03:09] mother and a little tiny babe a little
[1:03:11] babe that looks like a man a face like a
[1:03:13] man and then pictures like the pope and
[1:03:16] just this continual thing feeding I just
[1:03:20] thought my goodness marry ol tree
[1:03:23] yeah putting the woman up above the
[1:03:25] child and making
[1:03:28] yeah it's wild but it's real it's very
[1:03:32] current brothers and sisters if you
[1:03:34] don't have to look far but I stumbled
[1:03:36] into it and and I I just I guess I
[1:03:39] couldn't really believe that it was that
[1:03:40] far but it very much is
[1:03:43] goodness carrying on here so I guess I
[1:03:46] should just say these four things I
[1:03:48] think are are very important and uh
[1:03:51] probably well worth looking at because
[1:03:53] these are works that that Jesus Jesus
[1:03:56] said that God said I know your works but
[1:03:59] they're not anything in my sight they
[1:04:03] will not actually bring the results that
[1:04:05] you
[1:04:06] think they're actually Leading Men away
[1:04:08] from him carrying on he says those who
[1:04:11] fought this terrible Antichrist Church
[1:04:14] were
[1:04:15] destroyed those who stayed with it found
[1:04:18] themselves the pawn of the church
[1:04:20] whether they be peasants or Kings their
[1:04:23] lives were not their own and neither
[1:04:26] were their lives christs what a place to
[1:04:29] be
[1:04:30] hey but they belonged Body Soul and
[1:04:34] Spirit to the Church of
[1:04:36] Rome they talked about the blood of
[1:04:38] Christ yet they purchased their
[1:04:40] salvation with money and bought
[1:04:42] forgiveness of sins either by gold or
[1:04:46] Penance now this next part is wild the
[1:04:49] wealthier of them found it a happy
[1:04:52] situation when Pope Leo X allowed them
[1:04:56] to buy indulgences for Sins Not Yet
[1:04:59] committed so that they with ease of
[1:05:02] conscience could plan their awful crimes
[1:05:04] and then proceed to carry them out
[1:05:07] knowing that the pope had already
[1:05:08] remitted their
[1:05:11] sins the word of God was kept from them
[1:05:14] so who was to know the truth no wonder
[1:05:17] it was the Dark Ages since truth comes
[1:05:21] only from the word the people were shut
[1:05:23] up in a dungeon of the Roman Church
[1:05:26] awaiting death and after death
[1:05:29] judgment but the great drunk with
[1:05:32] the blood of Martyrs and with no thought
[1:05:36] of the Judgment reeled savagely on to
[1:05:40] kill men with both spiritual and
[1:05:44] physical
[1:05:46] death now toward the end of the fourth
[1:05:48] age which would be the beginning of the
[1:05:50] fifth age also the invasion of
[1:05:54] Constantinople
[1:05:57] by the Turks sent the learn Scholars of
[1:06:00] the East with their Greek manuscripts to
[1:06:02] the West the purity of the word and the
[1:06:05] teachings of True Believers were thus
[1:06:08] disseminated and not only were these
[1:06:12] fine teachers of great importance but
[1:06:15] also the invention of what became the
[1:06:18] basis of our modern printing presses was
[1:06:21] discovered facilitating the production
[1:06:24] of books
[1:06:26] thus we find the great hunger and demand
[1:06:29] for the Bible could be
[1:06:31] answered
[1:06:33] tremendous God will not allow his
[1:06:36] children to be without light to be
[1:06:38] without representation and I just think
[1:06:41] this this whole last part of the
[1:06:43] paragraph just made me think about the
[1:06:45] magnetic recording device that was
[1:06:47] released upon the Earth that technology
[1:06:49] that was released many people think it's
[1:06:52] for Hollywood and movies and rock and
[1:06:54] roll and all the stuff that goes on
[1:06:57] computers it was simply so that the
[1:07:00] voice of God through a Vindicated
[1:07:02] Prophet could be recorded so there would
[1:07:04] be a witness against this generation and
[1:07:08] if you wonder what I'm talking about
[1:07:09] specifically for anybody that might
[1:07:11] maybe be hearing this for the first time
[1:07:13] I know everyone here is a veteran to the
[1:07:15] message present tonight but if you just
[1:07:18] listen
[1:07:19] 1964 in the message of the hour I just
[1:07:22] picked 1964 because that's where I'm at
[1:07:23] right now but just about every single
[1:07:25] one of those messages in 1964 there is a
[1:07:28] space at the end of the message where
[1:07:31] you hear God speak through this man he
[1:07:34] tells people things and he begins to
[1:07:37] tell people things in Rapid succession
[1:07:40] not just like brother sitting there
[1:07:42] wearing the blue shirt you have
[1:07:44] something wrong in your life and and
[1:07:47] something else and then wait and then
[1:07:49] another brother over here on the other
[1:07:50] side no the brother in the blue shirt
[1:07:52] you've got this and the sister sitting
[1:07:54] beside you you've got that and the
[1:07:55] brother sitting beside her you've got
[1:07:57] that and the brother sitting beside them
[1:07:59] and the sister and the brother and the
[1:08:00] sister and the brother and he goes on
[1:08:02] and on and on how can you say things
[1:08:04] like that even if you had a microphone
[1:08:07] in an ear and somebody with a microphone
[1:08:09] telling you these things it would be
[1:08:11] very difficult to speak as rapid and
[1:08:13] accurate as he did that's just one
[1:08:16] message there's thousands of messages
[1:08:20] where at the end you can hear the prayer
[1:08:22] line and you can hear the discernment
[1:08:25] that that discernment is only of God
[1:08:28] Amen that's why the magnetic recording
[1:08:30] device was created but it just made me
[1:08:32] think about it here the beginning of it
[1:08:33] you know and even in our day we can see
[1:08:35] that they stop printing books now the
[1:08:37] voice of God Recordings for better for
[1:08:40] worse I'm not judging them I'm just
[1:08:41] saying that the progression from from
[1:08:44] printing books like crazy to not
[1:08:45] printing books anymore and going now
[1:08:47] digital with all of it it's interesting
[1:08:50] it's
[1:08:51] interesting the next paragraph he says
[1:08:54] God raised up many Mighty Men of which
[1:08:57] Luther was but one Calvin and zwingley
[1:09:01] were two other luminaries and besides
[1:09:03] these were many many more who were not
[1:09:06] so well known however all of this was
[1:09:09] not in vain the mighty work of God was
[1:09:13] actually hindered by these very
[1:09:17] men wow for one thing they did not
[1:09:20] oppose the church State marriage of the
[1:09:23] Nan Council but actually fostered that
[1:09:29] Union the defense of the Gospel by the
[1:09:32] state was welcomed though there was no
[1:09:34] word for
[1:09:36] it and you know it was in their day we
[1:09:39] can look at it and say that's awful that
[1:09:41] they did that but it meant death there
[1:09:44] was no middle ground you either were on
[1:09:46] board or you were in the grave
[1:09:49] right and we know that God God will
[1:09:52] always have a witness it's beautiful
[1:09:56] I think brother Ram talks about it in
[1:09:57] here too you know maybe even comparing
[1:09:59] it I don't know I get confused sometimes
[1:10:02] I get ahead of myself but you know how
[1:10:04] brother bradam talks about the prophet
[1:10:06] Jonah many times people will say that
[1:10:09] Jonah was a backslider and Jonah was out
[1:10:12] of the will of God but we know the
[1:10:14] prophet of God said he was very much in
[1:10:16] the will of God he was doing exactly
[1:10:18] what he needed to do exactly the way God
[1:10:20] intended it he was playing out the role
[1:10:23] that was created for him but naturally
[1:10:25] speaking like these brothers it didn't
[1:10:28] really look that good but who are we to
[1:10:33] judge he goes on to say many many more
[1:10:36] who are not so well known however
[1:10:38] through all this was not in vain the
[1:10:41] mighty work of God was actually hindered
[1:10:44] by these very men for one thing they did
[1:10:46] not oppose the church State marriage of
[1:10:48] the nyine council but actually fostered
[1:10:51] that Union the defense of the Gospel by
[1:10:54] the state was welcome though there was
[1:10:56] no word for it and though we can see the
[1:10:59] wrath of man praising God in such events
[1:11:03] as Henry VII taking up for the
[1:11:06] reformation and the rejection of papal
[1:11:09] Authority it was a far cry from the
[1:11:12] truth of Pentecost and
[1:11:15] protection of an omnipotent God in spite
[1:11:19] of Luther's constant teaching against
[1:11:23] outside interference
[1:11:25] in local church matters he was not able
[1:11:28] to clear men's minds of the bishop
[1:11:32] Archbishop concept of church government
[1:11:36] and we know that's very very alive and
[1:11:38] well today that whole thing men's minds
[1:11:42] are not clear and and some like that
[1:11:45] idea of Bishop and
[1:11:47] Archbishop uh
[1:11:49] Theory and uh we know that that's it's
[1:11:53] it's not right you he goes on to say
[1:11:56] thus the church took one step in the
[1:11:58] right direction but still remained
[1:12:00] Shackled so in short order she was again
[1:12:04] imprisoned in the same dungeon when she
[1:12:07] had attempted to
[1:12:09] escape still the cup of the Abominable
[1:12:12] Works was not yet full not only did
[1:12:16] Luther through poor judgment in sight to
[1:12:19] battle and thereby caused the death of
[1:12:21] multitudes but zwing ley's party
[1:12:24] persecuted to prison The Godly Dr Hub me
[1:12:29] and through it and though it did not
[1:12:33] commit him to the stake it was actually
[1:12:36] responsible in great measure for his
[1:12:39] eventual death by fire and Calvin did no
[1:12:43] less for he demanded the arrest of
[1:12:46] servitus who had seen and taught the
[1:12:48] Oneness of the
[1:12:50] godhead the state then tried this
[1:12:52] brother and to Calvin's dismay
[1:12:55] he was burned at the
[1:12:58] stake if there was ever a time of
[1:13:01] denominational Zeal it was at this
[1:13:03] tragic
[1:13:04] time the words of Communists describe
[1:13:09] much of this
[1:13:11] era commenius wrote the one thing
[1:13:15] needful he compares the world to aabr
[1:13:20] and shows that the way out is by leaving
[1:13:23] what is needless and choosing the one
[1:13:26] thing needful
[1:13:28] Christ that's such a beautiful statement
[1:13:30] you know alls we ever need to do is get
[1:13:32] to the place where we've become
[1:13:33] desperate in our lives and everything in
[1:13:35] our lives that's needless we'll just say
[1:13:37] it doesn't matter we'll choose the one
[1:13:39] thing
[1:13:40] needful the great number of teachers he
[1:13:43] says is the reason of the multitudes of
[1:13:46] sex for which we shall soon have no
[1:13:49] names left each Church reckons itself as
[1:13:53] the true
[1:13:54] one or at least as the
[1:13:56] purest truest part of
[1:13:59] it while among themselves they persecute
[1:14:03] each other with the bitterest hatred I
[1:14:07] say Lord let that not purvey or come
[1:14:10] through in our churches
[1:14:13] here no reconciliation is to be hoped
[1:14:16] for between
[1:14:17] them they meet Amity with
[1:14:22] irreconcilable Amity out of the Bible
[1:14:25] they Forge their different
[1:14:28] Creeds these are their
[1:14:31] fortresses and bulwarks behind which
[1:14:35] they entrench themselves and resist all
[1:14:40] attacks I will not say that these
[1:14:43] confessions of faith for we can admit in
[1:14:46] most cases that they are so are bad in
[1:14:52] themselves they become so how however in
[1:14:56] that they feed the fire of emnity only
[1:15:00] by putting them away to all together
[1:15:03] would it be possible to set to work on
[1:15:07] healing the wounds of the
[1:15:10] church that's a mouthful that paragraph
[1:15:13] but I believe that's something that
[1:15:15] should be read it should be pondered on
[1:15:18] because Spirits don't die and I for one
[1:15:21] have seen this even in modern times
[1:15:25] where we live a church says this about
[1:15:27] another church and they do something and
[1:15:30] they don't do another thing and we can
[1:15:32] find ourselves saying hey you know what
[1:15:35] we're pretty pure here we actually we've
[1:15:37] got the truth and and on and on and on
[1:15:40] we need to say no no no no no the only
[1:15:42] thing we have is Jesus Christ we have
[1:15:44] the word of God we have his Spirit
[1:15:46] living out through us and he will lead
[1:15:49] us and guide us but as soon as we start
[1:15:51] to see emnity rising up we know that
[1:15:55] that's not right he goes on to say to
[1:15:57] this Labyrinth of sects and various
[1:16:01] confessions another
[1:16:03] belongs the love of
[1:16:07] disputation what is attained by it it
[1:16:10] has a single learned has has a single
[1:16:13] learned Strife ever been settled never
[1:16:17] their number has only been
[1:16:19] increased Satan is the greatest sophist
[1:16:23] he has never been being overcome in a
[1:16:26] Strife of words and we know that brother
[1:16:29] Ram said you will never win a dispute
[1:16:32] with the Theologian you will never win a
[1:16:35] dispute with a theologian and I think
[1:16:37] it's real important for us to remember
[1:16:39] in the day in which we live in Divine
[1:16:42] service the words of men are usually
[1:16:46] heard more than the word of God each one
[1:16:49] Chatters as he pleases or kills Time by
[1:16:53] learned
[1:16:55] disquisitions and
[1:16:57] disproving the views of others and we've
[1:17:00] seen it even in the message maybe some
[1:17:03] people will get upset with me for even
[1:17:04] talking this way but let's just be
[1:17:06] honest we can see it in the message and
[1:17:09] we can have a quote battle well I
[1:17:11] believe we should do it this way well I
[1:17:12] believe we should do it that way well
[1:17:14] I've got a quote and I've got a quote
[1:17:16] everybody's got a quote what do the
[1:17:18] quotes do for us let's get Jesus Christ
[1:17:21] and let him lead and guide us he's the
[1:17:24] one that will lead lead us into all
[1:17:30] truth of the new birth and how a man
[1:17:32] must be changed into likeness of Christ
[1:17:35] to become partaker of the divine nature
[1:17:37] 2 Peter
[1:17:38] 1:4 scarcely anything is
[1:17:43] said let's turn over there second
[1:17:47] Peter verse one let's just take a look
[1:17:49] at that
[1:18:08] second Peter 1
[1:18:10] verse4 second Peter 1
[1:18:16] verse4 says whereby are given unto us
[1:18:20] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:18:23] that by the
[1:18:26] ye might be partakers of the divine
[1:18:28] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:18:32] that is in the world through
[1:18:35] lust sometimes I think it's good just to
[1:18:39] pick up on what he's talking about here
[1:18:42] the divine nature scarcely anything is
[1:18:45] said of the power of the keys the church
[1:18:48] has almost lost the power of binding
[1:18:53] only the power of loose
[1:18:55] Remains the sacraments given as symbols
[1:18:58] of unity of love and of our life in
[1:19:03] Christ have been made the occasion of
[1:19:06] bitterest conflict a cause of mutual
[1:19:10] hatred a center of SEC SEC sarian ISM in
[1:19:18] short chry andom has become a
[1:19:23] labyrinth the faith has been split into
[1:19:26] a thousand little parts and you are made
[1:19:31] a
[1:19:32] heretic if there is one of them you do
[1:19:36] not
[1:19:37] accept now I'm just going to read that
[1:19:39] again the faith has been split into a
[1:19:43] thousand little parts and you are made a
[1:19:47] heretic if there is one of them you do
[1:19:51] not
[1:19:52] accept what can help
[1:19:55] only one thing
[1:19:58] needful return to
[1:20:01] Christ looking to Christ as the only
[1:20:05] leader and walking in his footsteps
[1:20:09] setting aside all other ways until we
[1:20:13] all reach the goal and have come to the
[1:20:16] unity of the
[1:20:18] faith let's turn over to Ephesians 4
[1:20:32] Ephesians 4 verse
[1:20:35] 13 and we know that this is maybe we'll
[1:20:38] just pick up the background we'll start
[1:20:39] with verse 11 pretty famous scripture
[1:20:42] here we're all familiar with and he gave
[1:20:44] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:20:46] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:20:48] teachers for what for the perfecting of
[1:20:52] the Saints for the working of the
[1:20:54] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:20:58] Christ and this is the verse out of the
[1:21:00] book we're reading tonight till we all
[1:21:02] come in the unity of the faith not some
[1:21:06] of us and not most of us until we all
[1:21:11] come in the unity of the faith and of
[1:21:14] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:21:17] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:21:20] stature of the fullness of
[1:21:23] Christ Ephesians 4:13 brother Bram says
[1:21:27] until we all reach the goal and have
[1:21:30] come to the unity of the
[1:21:32] faith as the Heavenly Master Built
[1:21:35] everything on the ground of the
[1:21:38] scriptures so should we leave all
[1:21:42] particularities of our special
[1:21:45] confessions and be satisfied with the
[1:21:48] revealed word of God which belongs to us
[1:21:51] all with the Bible in our hand we should
[1:21:55] cry I believe what God has revealed in
[1:21:59] this
[1:22:00] book I will obediently keep his
[1:22:04] Commandments I hope for that which he
[1:22:07] has
[1:22:08] promised Christians give
[1:22:10] ear there is only one life but
[1:22:15] death I have this highlighted here there
[1:22:17] is only one life but death comes to us
[1:22:21] in a thousand
[1:22:23] forms there is only one Christ but a
[1:22:27] thousand
[1:22:29] antichrists brothers and sisters I think
[1:22:32] that would be a fridge magnet statement
[1:22:36] something to put on a mirror in our
[1:22:38] bathroom every day just to read that and
[1:22:41] think about it and and meditate on it in
[1:22:44] our lives there is only one Christ but a
[1:22:47] thousand
[1:22:50] Antichrist carrying on he says so thou
[1:22:53] knowest oh Christan what is the one
[1:22:56] thing needful either thou turnest back
[1:22:58] to Christ or thou goest to destruction
[1:23:01] like the Antichrist if Thou Art wise and
[1:23:04] wil live follow the leader of
[1:23:09] life but you
[1:23:11] Christians rejoice in your being caught
[1:23:14] up hear the words of your heavenly
[1:23:16] leaders say come unto me answer with one
[1:23:20] voice even so we
[1:23:22] come and I believe that's why we worship
[1:23:25] when we get in church and we have the
[1:23:27] opportunity to close our eyes and and
[1:23:29] lift our hands and raise our voice we're
[1:23:32] just answering with one voice even so we
[1:23:35] come
[1:23:37] my now I just said that this era gave
[1:23:39] tremendous growth to the denominational
[1:23:42] Spirit if the Corinthian attitude
[1:23:46] of I am of Paul and I of cleopas was
[1:23:51] ever exhibited it was now there were
[1:23:54] lutherans hites zwingley party
[1:23:58] Etc such fragmentation of the body was
[1:24:01] deplorable and they were living a name
[1:24:04] but were dead certainly they were dead
[1:24:06] they died the minute they
[1:24:11] organized the great groups organized and
[1:24:13] tied themselves in matrimony to the
[1:24:17] state and that means they married the
[1:24:19] state they did it they were
[1:24:22] finished we're not supposed to marry
[1:24:24] theate State we're not supposed to marry
[1:24:26] the church we're supposed to marry
[1:24:29] Christ here were those lutherans who had
[1:24:32] criticized the Roman Church they knew
[1:24:34] the unrighteous of unrighteousness of
[1:24:37] political and spiritual unions yet
[1:24:40] Luther as when Peter was overbalanced by
[1:24:43] the
[1:24:45] Judas
[1:24:46] judaizers went right ahead and made the
[1:24:49] state instead of God the defender of the
[1:24:53] faith this is the first denomination of
[1:24:56] repute that came out of the Harlot but
[1:25:00] when Luther died it was not long until
[1:25:02] it had a hierarchy like the one it had
[1:25:07] fought I just want to read this
[1:25:12] again when Luther died it was not long
[1:25:16] until they had a hierarchy like the one
[1:25:19] it had
[1:25:20] fought this move of God by the time the
[1:25:24] second second generation came along was
[1:25:27] right back under the wing of her mother
[1:25:30] she had gone back and did not even know
[1:25:33] it they had taken on their own name
[1:25:37] above his name they were living their
[1:25:40] own name
[1:25:42] too and all the denominations that are
[1:25:44] doing that very thing
[1:25:48] today they are living their own name and
[1:25:53] not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:56] that is easily seen for every church is
[1:25:58] known by the way it
[1:26:00] worships but none are known by the power
[1:26:04] of God I say Lord help
[1:26:09] us we don't look for signs and wonders
[1:26:12] but we know they follow and when we
[1:26:14] don't have signs and wonders following
[1:26:16] where are we
[1:26:17] at he says there is your test and I want
[1:26:21] you to notice right here that this era
[1:26:25] did not have signs and wonders amongst
[1:26:28] them just for the record I'm not saying
[1:26:31] I wish we had signs and
[1:26:32] wonders I know that if we pass the
[1:26:35] microphone around everyone would be able
[1:26:36] to say I've had this I've seen that
[1:26:38] we've done this we've had that there's
[1:26:40] signs and
[1:26:41] wonders but that's not what drives
[1:26:44] us they gave up the power of God for the
[1:26:47] power of the state they clung to their
[1:26:49] own name they made their names great it
[1:26:52] was that old Spirit of getting everyone
[1:26:55] into its fold today the Baptists want
[1:26:58] the Methodist to come over to the
[1:26:59] Baptist the methodists are out to priz
[1:27:03] the Presbyterians the Pentecostals want
[1:27:06] them all each claims to offer the most
[1:27:10] and to hold out the greatest hopes a
[1:27:13] sort of Door to Heaven or at least the
[1:27:16] way to a more abundant entrance how
[1:27:20] tragic it all is this denominational
[1:27:23] spirit has made all the denominations
[1:27:26] write their manuals and teach their
[1:27:30] Creeds set up their offices and church
[1:27:34] governments and then each claims that
[1:27:37] she and she alone truly speaks for God
[1:27:42] as she is the best
[1:27:48] qualified now if that isn't exactly what
[1:27:51] the pope and the Roman Church are are
[1:27:54] doing they are right back there with
[1:27:57] their mother the Harlot and don't know
[1:28:01] it in closing Our Moment our comments on
[1:28:04] this verse thou Hast a name that thou
[1:28:07] livest and art dead I cannot impress
[1:28:09] upon you too strongly that in this age
[1:28:12] though it brought the Reformation as
[1:28:15] most sternly rebuked by God instead of
[1:28:18] being praised that it swed the seed of
[1:28:22] denomination
[1:28:24] that organized right back to the
[1:28:27] Harlot I think that's one one statement
[1:28:31] right there it just sets my soul on fire
[1:28:34] how we need to make sure that we are
[1:28:36] sowing the right seeds in the youth in
[1:28:39] our churches we need to make sure that
[1:28:42] we are not sowing seeds of doubt that
[1:28:45] we're not sowing seeds of exclusivity
[1:28:48] that we're not sowing seeds of division
[1:28:51] by talking about other people we've
[1:28:53] talked about it and on we need to make
[1:28:55] sure we're sewing the right seeds in the
[1:28:57] children in our
[1:28:59] church because they are the future of
[1:29:01] this church if the Lord should
[1:29:04] T after God had opened the door of
[1:29:08] Escape when the move away from God sorry
[1:29:12] when the move away from the Catholic
[1:29:13] Church took place it was not only truly
[1:29:17] spiritual as a whole but more political
[1:29:21] most of the people took up with
[1:29:23] prostatism
[1:29:24] because as I have stated they hated the
[1:29:27] Roman system of political and financial
[1:29:29] bondage thus instead of this being a
[1:29:33] great spiritual move with all the
[1:29:34] earmarks of the Holy Spirit influence as
[1:29:38] when God used purely spiritual means to
[1:29:41] accomplish his ends at
[1:29:43] Pentecost it was indeed a work wherein
[1:29:46] the wrath of man praised
[1:29:49] God and the results paralleled the
[1:29:52] history of Israel when she she left
[1:29:54] Egypt and wandered in the desert not
[1:29:57] making it to Canaan land and why didn't
[1:30:00] they make it there they
[1:30:03] murmured they started to complain they
[1:30:05] started to look at all the natural
[1:30:07] circumstances and they started to
[1:30:08] complain they didn't really come right
[1:30:10] out and curse God what they did was they
[1:30:12] cursed the guy that God put in
[1:30:16] place it didn't work out
[1:30:18] right however much was accomplished in
[1:30:22] that where the Yoke of home was even
[1:30:25] partly broken men could now receive the
[1:30:28] word of God and yield to the influence
[1:30:31] of the spirit without such great fear as
[1:30:35] formerly this opened the door to the
[1:30:38] great missionary age that followed the
[1:30:40] Jezebel of thyra was in no mood to give
[1:30:44] up her hold upon the people and thus we
[1:30:47] see her daughter a athalia raised her
[1:30:52] head in the sardan age
[1:30:54] with the hopes that she would be able to
[1:30:57] strangle the true seed by her schemes
[1:31:02] and
[1:31:03] organization I just think that's an
[1:31:05] interesting word
[1:31:08] schemes and uh we know that it's a
[1:31:10] spirit that's trying to cause people to
[1:31:13] want to organize that's what the
[1:31:14] denominational spirit is how we doing
[1:31:16] for time we're still good the warning
[1:31:18] Revelations 3:2 Be watchful and
[1:31:21] strengthen the things which remain that
[1:31:24] are ready to die for I have not found
[1:31:26] thy works perfect before God I wish it
[1:31:30] could be said that the sardian age was a
[1:31:33] restoration instead of a
[1:31:35] Reformation I cannot say that the word
[1:31:39] does not call it a restoration but
[1:31:42] certainly calls it a
[1:31:45] Reformation had it been a
[1:31:49] restoration that age would have been
[1:31:52] another Pentecostal age
[1:31:54] it's amazing hey but it was not the best
[1:31:58] that could be said of it was strengthen
[1:32:01] that which remains that's ready to
[1:32:04] die tragic there was something missing
[1:32:08] my yes there certainly was this age had
[1:32:11] justification but it had missed
[1:32:13] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:32:15] Holy Ghost and it's so beautiful because
[1:32:18] as I'm reading this as I'm studying it
[1:32:20] I'm sure every one of us feels that way
[1:32:22] we have this this is not not something
[1:32:24] that's missing from our lives we can
[1:32:26] almost take this for granted if we're
[1:32:28] not careful we have it that is what
[1:32:31] God's original plan was that is what
[1:32:34] they had at Pentecost they were
[1:32:35] Justified they were Sanctified and were
[1:32:37] filled with the Holy
[1:32:40] Ghost why listen to me the reason for
[1:32:43] being justified and Sanctified is to the
[1:32:46] end that you might be baptized with the
[1:32:48] Holy Ghost not just so that we can be
[1:32:51] justified not just so that we can be
[1:32:53] sanctified and live good lives and
[1:32:55] potentially one day perhaps no the goal
[1:32:58] is to get the Holy
[1:33:00] Ghost that is the reason that there is a
[1:33:03] church that's the reason we come to
[1:33:06] church brothers and sisters so we can
[1:33:08] get the Holy
[1:33:10] Ghost it is the temple of God filled
[1:33:13] with God even the Holy Ghost that's why
[1:33:17] I think it's so beautiful we heard it
[1:33:19] tonight shake one another's hands as
[1:33:22] you're seated who whose hands are you
[1:33:24] shaking really I mean really whose hands
[1:33:28] are we shaking now this is where it goes
[1:33:31] crazy this is where we start to become
[1:33:33] Heretics heretical teachings when we
[1:33:36] start to say you're shaking the hand of
[1:33:38] almighty God but but whose Temple are we
[1:33:42] this is not our own Temple that we can
[1:33:44] go and just treat and and and feed right
[1:33:46] and and and act right and and and live
[1:33:49] right and just be this Temple our bodies
[1:33:51] are a temple many times people say that
[1:33:54] even in the world sure enough they are
[1:33:56] but for what
[1:33:57] God that's the difference we're here to
[1:34:01] get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters
[1:34:03] that's our
[1:34:04] purpose that is the reason that there is
[1:34:06] a church it is the temple of God filled
[1:34:09] with God even the Holy Ghost The Same
[1:34:12] Spirit that was in Jesus while he was
[1:34:15] here on Earth causing him to do the
[1:34:17] mighty Works which he did came back upon
[1:34:21] the church at Pentecost so they did did
[1:34:23] the works that he did this age did not
[1:34:27] have those works oh they had the written
[1:34:31] word but not the revealed word and we've
[1:34:34] got the revealed word amen that's why
[1:34:38] brothers and sisters when we say it it's
[1:34:40] not just a cliche we worship in spirit
[1:34:43] because we have gone on to get the
[1:34:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost but we worship
[1:34:47] in spirit and the revealed word spirit
[1:34:52] and Truth
[1:34:56] this is the Reformation period but fear
[1:34:59] not little flock God said I will restore
[1:35:01] and this reform was going to be the
[1:35:04] start of it I just love this history to
[1:35:07] think this is where it was starting for
[1:35:10] us so that we could be here tonight
[1:35:12] partaking of this my he was going to
[1:35:17] according to his promise take the church
[1:35:19] back from the depth of Satan in the Dark
[1:35:22] Ages to the depth of God that they had
[1:35:26] at Pentecost and in the first few years
[1:35:29] of the existence of the
[1:35:31] church now be careful and get
[1:35:33] this it says in the second verse that I
[1:35:38] read for I have not found thy works
[1:35:41] perfect before
[1:35:43] God do you know what the meaning of not
[1:35:45] perfect really
[1:35:47] is it's
[1:35:50] unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled
[1:35:52] age it was just the start of getting
[1:35:56] back that is why I said the Bible called
[1:35:59] it Reformation not
[1:36:02] restoration it had started out in the
[1:36:05] doctrine of justification which meant
[1:36:07] salvation was all of God oh how Luther
[1:36:12] preached the sovereignty of God and
[1:36:14] election he knew it was all of Grace he
[1:36:17] separated the church from rule by
[1:36:19] ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down
[1:36:21] the idols he cast out the conf
[1:36:23] confessions he cast out of the
[1:36:26] confessions to the priest he denounced
[1:36:28] the pope it was wonderfully good as he
[1:36:32] started but God said God had said 1500
[1:36:36] years before Luther you're going to
[1:36:39] start things but your age will see it
[1:36:42] all
[1:36:44] unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later
[1:36:46] hallelujah our god reth he knows the end
[1:36:50] from the beginning yes Luther was his
[1:36:53] messenger
[1:36:54] it didn't look like it as we examine the
[1:36:57] flaws but there was a man called Jonah
[1:37:00] he had flaws in his life too he was a
[1:37:03] prophet though you and I might not want
[1:37:06] to say so on the basis of how he acted
[1:37:09] but God knows how them that are his and
[1:37:13] he has his way just as he did with
[1:37:18] Jonah he had his way with Luther in that
[1:37:21] age and he will have his way until the
[1:37:25] consummation and I want to say he is
[1:37:28] having his way
[1:37:30] tonight now in this now this was an
[1:37:33] unfulfilled age it was an age of
[1:37:36] reformation but that's how God wanted it
[1:37:40] I want to illustrate that to you the way
[1:37:42] I did to a very wonderful Lutheran
[1:37:45] brother who was a president of a very
[1:37:47] fine Seminary out
[1:37:49] west I had been invited to his place to
[1:37:52] have dinner with him and to speak to him
[1:37:56] concerning the Holy Spirit he was
[1:37:58] puzzled about many things and he said to
[1:38:00] me what have we Lutheran got I said well
[1:38:04] you have Christ he said we want the Holy
[1:38:07] Ghost do you think we got it I said
[1:38:11] potentially you are believing unto
[1:38:14] it he said what do you mean potentially
[1:38:18] we are hungry for God we read a book on
[1:38:21] Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:38:24] and so some of us flew out to California
[1:38:26] to see the author when we got there he
[1:38:28] told us that though he had written the
[1:38:30] book he did not have the
[1:38:33] gifts now when we saw the operation of
[1:38:36] gifts in your
[1:38:37] ministry we wanted to talk to you for
[1:38:41] you must know something about them isn't
[1:38:44] that
[1:38:45] beautiful even the Theologian is is
[1:38:48] calling upon him saying hey maybe I
[1:38:50] don't understand you or maybe I can't
[1:38:52] even believe you but there's something
[1:38:53] about the works that you're doing
[1:38:55] there's just something about you Mar now
[1:38:58] this brother's Seminary is out in the
[1:39:00] country and surrounded by many acres of
[1:39:02] Farmland on which the students can work
[1:39:04] and thereby pay their way through
[1:39:07] college he also has factories that go
[1:39:09] along with the farm to give added
[1:39:12] employment so using his fields to
[1:39:14] illustrate my case I said once there was
[1:39:18] a man who went forth on his own ground
[1:39:21] to plant a field of corn
[1:39:23] he pulled up the stumps cleared off the
[1:39:25] Rocks plowed and disced it and then
[1:39:28] planted his
[1:39:30] corn each morning he looked out across
[1:39:32] the field but one morning instead of a
[1:39:35] Barren ground he saw myriads of little
[1:39:39] blades coming up he said praise God for
[1:39:42] my Field of Corn I then asked him did
[1:39:47] the man have corn he said well in one
[1:39:51] way he did I said potentially yes and
[1:39:56] that was you Lutheran in the Reformation
[1:39:59] putting forth your blade see the corn
[1:40:03] began to grow after it had rotted in the
[1:40:06] ground during the Dark
[1:40:09] Ages after several joints there were
[1:40:12] fine large stocks and one day a tassel
[1:40:16] of silk
[1:40:18] appeared that tassel of silk looked down
[1:40:21] at the blades and said you old formal
[1:40:24] lutherans haven't
[1:40:26] anything look at us we're the Breeders
[1:40:30] the great
[1:40:31] missionaries our day is the missionary
[1:40:34] era that tassel age was the wesleyian
[1:40:38] age they were the greatest missionaries
[1:40:41] and even excelled in our
[1:40:44] age what did that age do it scattered
[1:40:48] like pollen in the
[1:40:50] breeze now what is the next step
[1:40:53] logically we think that is the actual
[1:40:57] forming and harvesting of the grain the
[1:41:00] completed cycle but not so there's
[1:41:03] another stage that stage is when the
[1:41:06] husk or chaff is formed to cover the
[1:41:10] seed and that is exactly what happened
[1:41:13] in this spiritual cycle at the turn of
[1:41:17] the 20th century in the start of the
[1:41:20] leodan age there was widespread belief
[1:41:23] that the Holy Ghost was falling exactly
[1:41:26] as he did at
[1:41:28] Pentecost people were talking in tongues
[1:41:30] and claiming to be baptized with the
[1:41:32] Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking
[1:41:35] in
[1:41:37] tongues but I have walked in the grain
[1:41:39] Fields many times and there in late
[1:41:43] summer I have plucked the heads of Wheat
[1:41:46] and rubbed them in my hand to get some
[1:41:50] grain when to my surprise there was
[1:41:53] wasn't any corn of wheat in that chaff
[1:41:56] though it indeed it surely looked as if
[1:42:00] wheat were there isn't that interesting
[1:42:04] it's such a perfect description it looks
[1:42:08] exactly like it I was doing that this
[1:42:11] summer we've got Fields close to our
[1:42:13] house I was doing that exact thing and
[1:42:15] and this is just so real it's just so
[1:42:19] perfect if anybody has a question about
[1:42:21] this we can actually show you next year
[1:42:23] here next summer come out we can go out
[1:42:25] in the field and you'll be able to see
[1:42:26] it exactly this is a perfect picture of
[1:42:29] the so-called Pentecostal move and we
[1:42:32] know I just want to throw this in there
[1:42:33] brother Bram he said very clearly in the
[1:42:36] anointed ones at the end time that Satan
[1:42:37] can impersonate any gift it's important
[1:42:41] to understand that he can impersonate
[1:42:43] his speaking in tongues he can heal all
[1:42:46] of that stuff can happen under the
[1:42:48] anointing the only one thing he cannot
[1:42:51] do is accept the word of God he cannot
[1:42:54] humble himself to the word of God
[1:42:57] brother bam says it's a perfect picture
[1:42:58] of the so-called Pentecostal move and
[1:43:01] that this is proven fact is found in
[1:43:05] these people organized on a Doctrine and
[1:43:09] bound themselves right back as did the
[1:43:12] organization ahead of them proving that
[1:43:15] instead of being the real seed they were
[1:43:18] the chaff or protecting cover for the
[1:43:21] wheat seed which should come this is
[1:43:24] where I want to throw in there too I
[1:43:26] just can't help it you know brother
[1:43:27] brandham said it when we look back in
[1:43:29] our lives maybe we would say I got the
[1:43:31] message of the hour I've got the
[1:43:32] revealed word for my day and I feel so
[1:43:35] bad for my Methodist grandmother he said
[1:43:39] don't you think for a second that your
[1:43:41] shouting Methodist Grandma won't be
[1:43:42] there because she accepted the word the
[1:43:45] light for her
[1:43:47] day you're not going to have a wheat
[1:43:49] seed without the chaff brothers and
[1:43:51] sisters don't throw off on the people
[1:43:54] that don't have a revelation that
[1:43:56] matches yours we have to have the chaff
[1:43:59] or you don't have a
[1:44:02] wheat it was a protecting cover for the
[1:44:05] wheat seed which should
[1:44:07] come this chaff stage was the danger
[1:44:11] period that Jesus spoke of in Matthew
[1:44:13] 24:24 deceiving the very elect if it
[1:44:16] were
[1:44:18] Possible Oh man felt that this husk the
[1:44:22] so-called Pentecostal age was the true
[1:44:25] seed but it proved to be just a carrier
[1:44:28] to carry the life over into the age in
[1:44:32] which the true restoration comes and the
[1:44:34] wheat bride is manifested in the power
[1:44:38] spoken of by Ezekiel 47 I'll call the
[1:44:41] musicians we'll end off with this
[1:44:43] scripture here Ezekiel
[1:44:46] 47:2
[1:44:48] to5 then brought he me out of the way by
[1:44:53] the gate northward and led me about the
[1:44:57] way without unto the utter gate by the
[1:45:01] way that lookth Eastward and behold
[1:45:04] there ran out waters on the right
[1:45:06] side and when the man that had the line
[1:45:09] in his hand went forth Eastward he
[1:45:12] measured a th cubits and he brought me
[1:45:16] through the waters the waters were to
[1:45:18] the
[1:45:19] ankles again he measured a thousand and
[1:45:22] brought brought me through the waters
[1:45:24] the waters were to the knees again
[1:45:27] measured a thousand and brought me
[1:45:29] through the waters were to the
[1:45:32] loins afterward he measured a thousand
[1:45:34] and it was a river that I could not pass
[1:45:36] over for the waters were risen Waters to
[1:45:39] swim in a river that could not be passed
[1:45:43] over and the way that it was done was by
[1:45:48] God's perfect will and programming the
[1:45:51] lutherans had the Holy Ghost
[1:45:53] potentially under justification the
[1:45:56] Methodist had it potentially under
[1:45:59] sanctification and today it is brought
[1:46:03] back a
[1:46:05] restoration the Holy Ghost is here God
[1:46:08] bless you tonight maybe stand with me as
[1:46:10] we
