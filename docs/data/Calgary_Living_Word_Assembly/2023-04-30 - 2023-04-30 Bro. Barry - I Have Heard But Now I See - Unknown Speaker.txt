Assange who will be traveling this week going to Ontario let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness to us Lord father when we can recognize what you've done for us lord it's so easy to worship you father it's so wonderful to express unto you father the love that you have placed within us Lord Jesus for you it's such a paradox Lord Jesus it's nothing that we could ever do on our own but it's because you this you said your word says that I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world and we know that as long as you're here with us father we have not seen the end of the world we know that you're still calling and we thank you for your goodness Lord Jesus although this morning we want to continue to remember these requests as we have made known unto you those who are traveling brother Paul who's going to be Sister Mary who is Father that you would just keep your hand upon them Lord thank you for bringing the ajala family home Lord Jesus we pray that you would touch them that you would heal their bodies Lord even though they they're home safely they're not feeling well father we just thank you for touching Isaiah Thomas Lord the 14 year old boy Afflicted with the Devil father father we thank you that there is always a time appointed of the father Lord where we might not see a miracle we might not see an instantaneous change but father we know that if we speak the word and we believe without doubting in our hearts then it will come to pass that which we believe that which we ask father in your name you said ask anything in my name and it shall be given unto you it shall be done we thank you Father for touching that boy in Jesus name father we thank you for brother Frank Cronkite Lord and his testimony Lord his service to your kingdom father Lord we thank you for his family Lord Jesus now we just continue to hold him before your throne trusting that your perfect will would work be worked out in his life according to your purpose Lord Jesus thank you for touching him now in Jesus name now father we just ask that you would meet each and every need May known unto you this morning by an uplift hand father we all are needy we all have needs father in our lives and father you know mine as well father we just want to commit them all into your hands trusting that you're in complete control father we certainly love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to maybe just take a little different direction today and read from Job chapter 42. Job chapter 42. certainly like to welcome many people in our midst today Jeffrey sister Carla family God bless you welcome I'd like to welcome sister Pearl brother Chris's mom would be a pleasure to have you with us look forward to meeting you after the service we'd also like to welcome sister Mary taiwo sister Faith igmanna's mother I believe she's come to visit for a while she's come to sojourn I know sister Faith will certainly enjoy having her and the whole family as well there's nothing better than having Grandma around Job chapter 42. verse 1. then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou can't do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine I see if the wherefore I abort myself and repent in dust and Ashes amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord thank you for your word thank you that your word is the present word lord it's not a historical text but it's something that we can read and father it has life Lord Jesus and we just ask Lord Jesus that once again you would come by here on this little corner in Calgary that you would just Quicken this word to us today Father Lord that when we leave this building today we would say that truly we met with the Lord Jesus Christ and father if there be any in our midst that maybe haven't Lord we just ask that supernaturally they would be able to say the same words father Lord we just love you and we thank you and we ask that you would bless the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated for a few minutes just a few announcements before we go too far we have the May calendar out and uh you'll be able to go and check it out just a few highlights we have a gym night arranged for May the 12th and I think it's at Central Memorial High this time we have two hours booked I believe so it should be a real good night um we have a ladies brunch booked for Saturday the 13th we have a prayer meeting on the 18th which is a Thursday we have a youth event on the 19th and we have a communion service booked for the 28th and moving forward I don't know if I've said it but I just will if I haven't I would like to re-uh pardon me I would like to alternate communion service one month praise and worship service the other month and we'll just sort of rotate that way and we should be able to have six of each in the course of a year just see what the Lord will do there I think there's something real special about worship and and I can't get away from that thought and as we go forwards I'm just going to go closer and closer towards it and I believe the Lord will open it wide to us but there's something real important about worship it's not something that we can just Overlook and say it's a formality that we just do because it's a mechanical thing when we go to church we just sing you know when we get over there brothers and sisters we're not going to be reading quotes from the message of the hour we're not going to be reading scriptures from the Bible we're not going to be having Bible studies or prayer meetings we're going to be worshiping that's what we're going to do when we're over there we're going to live and we're going to build but brothers and sisters we're not going to be trying to learn more about the word because we're going to be the word right now is the time to actually study and learn but hey something happens when you worship before you study and learn what we do is we tear down walls we tear down strongholds we talked about that a while ago if we want to see the success of the Lord in our services in our lives then we've got to let go of all of our inhibitions and give him the worthy Glory that he is do the praise that he is Desiring as our brother said it earlier I think it's so vital to recognize it that it's an expression of our love to our husband if we're the bride and as husbands how do we like our wives to express their love to us we like it I don't think there's any husband here that doesn't like it when their wife expresses her love anyways I'm going off on a tangent pardon me I had a hook or a slice there we're gonna go straight down the Fairway here you know we're we're gonna alternate the services and just see what the Lord will do also I wanted to throw it out there I wanted to mention it a while ago but I forgot I would like to see if we could do a passion play Journey a pilgrimage out to Drum Heller this summer so if anybody's interested in going I think we can make arrangements to go and I think it'd be a fun time it'll be a great time of fellowship if nobody has ever seen it before it's well worth it it's been many years since I've gone but if you'd like to go just send me a text message I'd like to see what there is for interest and we'll try and book something for everyone to be able to go together it's a very limited time if you were to go on the website you could see just look up Passion Play and uh let's just see if we can have a an outing I think it'll be a real fun time had a had a text sent this morning and I just think it's so beautiful I want to thank everyone for the specials today I want to thank everyone for the specials yesterday and I want to thank everyone for the specials in the future because the specials do something they set an atmosphere brothers and sisters they're an expression of our love of our worship unto God and we can never ever over rate the preciousness of a special when somebody takes the time and their energy to come and sing a special it's not so they can be seen sometimes we see that and unfortunately it's human nature and and we just want to have Grace for those people we don't want to say because of that I'm never going to go to a worship service again we've seen it before you know what that is it's a trap of the devil to try and see what you'll do God will allow those things to happen brothers and sisters just to see how we're going to react is are we going to stand before him one day and say well this thing happened on Earth that's why I couldn't worship you he's going to say really didn't my word say that immediately the Rocks would cry out if you wouldn't worship me what are we going to do what are we going to let stand in the way of us worshiping Lord the Lord but I just had this text come and uh I just wanted to read it here it's from Brother Toby this morning he sent it on the men's chat says now we come to church to better ourselves the people that come to church brothers and sisters aren't perfect people we come to church because we're broken people and we need to be fixed people we know that we're Sinners saved by grace that's why we come to church so we can get better the ones who are perfect you want to step back from you want to be careful now I say that in context because we're supposed to be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect the only way we're going to be perfect is to be completely surrendered unto the Lord but if somebody has a perfect image and their image is their perfection brothers and sisters that's the wrong thing but here we are reading this quote here it says now we come to church to better ourselves we we come to make ourselves better people this is where I think you know some of the people who are they want to try and make William Marion Brown I'm a fanatic if they would just listen to what he said they would just read it read what he says and listen to it with their ears with their minds we come to church to make ourselves better people better Christians better citizens better fathers better mothers better Neighbors we come because Christ has told us if we would come ask anything in his name where we are assembled together as many as two or three he would he would be with us and would Grant it to us so what could be any more be any better to us today than to know that we are at the church for to embed ourselves to broaden our understanding how many would say that's what I'm here for I think it's beautiful many times we'll go and buy a ticket to a tremendous concert or a tremendous play or a tremendous thing that only happens a certain time of the year maybe it's an Edmonton Oilers playoffs ticket what's that worth brothers and sisters on the free market tons of money I don't care because I don't really care about hockey but that's just me there's a lot of people that really Revel in hockey they love it and you know what there's nothing wrong with that so long as that's not your God so long as you don't put that first but when we come to the house of the Lord what happens when there's a breakaway do we get excited or is it a a playoff thing that does it for us but that's the reason we come to church brothers and sisters is to be able to better ourselves to become better people better citizens better neighbors better husbands better wives better children better parents our desire isn't to come and and say that we put on a cloak of religious righteousness and now I've done my deed for the week and I can go out and sin tomorrow and just come back next week and make it better no that's not what we do at all we come to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ we come to recognize how little we really are and in the midst of that it actually builds us up makes us better people welcome back kempers it's certainly good to see you again I trust you had a wonderful time away out of our scripture today I just can't help but think most of the inspiration today is out of uh 1965. I have heard but now I have seen um tremendous message the Lord just led me there but talking about the scripture here you know job answering the Lord and knowing that the Lord there's no thought that's hidden from the Lord and who is it that that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not this one just about put me on the floor when I was reading this and thinking about it brothers and sisters do I understand the things that I'm talking about oh my and here I am preaching the word of God I'm just going to try and be honest don't be afraid and don't get nervous I'm not saying that I'm A ranked sinner or anything but what I'm saying is I know that I'm a sinner saved by grace and I know that I had a meeting with him once upon a time and as I preached this message of the hour I wonder if I fully recognize the magnitude of this because this is the stuff that prophets and sages throughout the ages desire to look on even angels desire to see the stuff that we just take for granted and here we are we've got it all it's an open book to us but I think about this verse 6 wherefore I abort myself and repent and dust and Ashes when I recognize that do I understand this oh my but you know there came a time for me and I know it happens to every single believer it there's a time where we've heard about the message of the hour we've heard about it and we've heard about it and we've heard about it but there comes a point in time in our lives where we can finally see it we can finally understand it and that's what seeing it means having a comprehension of it it's not seeing the message of the hour I've got a bookshelf of every single published book there ever was and all the CDs and maybe the wire reel tapes and none of that it's not seeing all of that it's not having an app on our phone being able to see it and and cognitively reason it with our minds it's seeing it with our heart understanding by Revelation what the message of the hour is remember last week we we talked about this John chapter five verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that set me hasn't everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but has passed from Death unto life I just think when we hear that scripture brothers and sisters it gives us the ability to sing that song Justified Justified you never did it in the first place and you know if you truly believe that God sent a prophet if we believe that God sent us a prophet in our day to recognize that he said that God said to the Bride of Jesus Christ those people that hath an ear to hear what he saith unto the people you never did it in the first place that's astounding we've got reason to Rejoice right there he says verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that here shall live you know only a certain class of people are able to hear the son of God and that's the Holy Ghost speaking out to us speaking out through us last week we talked about spiritual viruses and sometimes we can be spreaders of a virus and not even know that we're spreading a virus and that's why the word says to watch what we say be very careful how we speak around our dinner tables no one else can hear us we could be talking on a phone be careful how we speak we can be spreading viruses and not even recognizing it we don't want to talk about the the natural types we talk a little bit about that last week and and it's important I guess to to look at it that way but more than anything I want to talk about the spiritual thing because we want to cover some ground today but just to sort of recap and remind us stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance we have to be careful what we say other people are listening to what we say and some people can can can not be affected at all they can hear something they'll go in one ear out the other ear you'll just say you know what it doesn't bother me I'm not going to worry about it it's it's irrelevant to me and it doesn't bother me but other times people hear it and it can affect them greatly it can cause a real problem in their life I heard one time about how someone was in a group of people that were just slamming someone just tearing them up and you know what happened that person who was there listening to it they left that meeting of all those people Believers that were doing it and what happened was a Great Depression set in on this person brothers and sisters we don't know how the devil is going to manifest he's a coward he's always going to come different than the way we think he's not going to come like a raging monster in front of our eyes some people can actually spread a spiritual virus and it won't affect them at all and other people they can wind up on spiritual life support because of it just like to remind everyone if you don't mind please just turn your cell phones off in the house of the Lord it's just a reverence if we think about it how it was in the days of the priests going into the temple they had to have everything in order very specifically in order and I'm pretty confident they never took cell phones into the temple into the holy of holies because if they did they would be drug out by a rope tied to their ankle this is life or death brothers and sisters this isn't just something we do out of fun it's not just a tradition this is serious business there's no greater honor or or judgment to us than to come to the house of the Lord but here we have a situation where people can be winding up on on spiritual life support because of what other people say not understanding that the words we have bear so much weight in our lives and we've talked about it in the past we're going to drill into this as we go forwards we're not living in the first poll or the second poll anointings brothers and sisters we're living in the third pull the third pull anointing that's the age we're living in the bride age where the bride is becoming the wife when the wife speaks God acts when she speaks it's actually not her speaking if she is together with him if she's United with him it's actually him speaking when we speak things we've got to be very careful because we are creators we can create an environment that opens doors for Devils we don't want to do that we want to close the doors on Devils we want to kick Devils out Matthew 5 37 but let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil Ephesians 4 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption how are we going to grieve the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters by speaking our communication is going to be corrupt by giving corrupt communication we're going to cause the Holy Ghost to just go and sit down and you know it might not be a buzz saw temper it might not be because we're actually doing something at a really big anger we might just be simply uttering words that are slamming someone else you know I was thinking about it while I was going over this in the last service preparing for the last service Sunday Wednesday today what's the biggest hindrance to the church today we all believe the message of the hour we all believe that God said a prophet we're all baptized in the Holy Holy Spirit we've been baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins We Believe but what's the biggest hindrance to the Bride of Jesus Christ today I I believe it and I would certainly be open to conversation again but I think it's our communication what happens is our communication can hinder us and you know when we communicate stuff that's actually not positive that's the tip of the iceberg because a word is a thought expressed and many times we do have pretty good manners and we do have the ability to refrain a little bit sometimes a lot but what else is going on up here brother Branham said that that is the greatest Battleground but he also said that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words word of God says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth not some not partial not only a few let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth I say Lord help me but that which is good to the edifying to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers we want to minister Grace to people we want to minister Grace to our families we want to minister Grace to our brothers and our sisters we don't want to minister anything else and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you're not going to change your destination but you might not be ministering Grace what is the next verse 31 says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake have forgiven you tenderhearted that's a good one sometimes in life we experience things that cause our hearts to get not tender they cause our hearts to get a little bit calloused anybody ever have a callus on your skin you understand what I'm talking about the skin gets really hard and you lose the feeling there's no more sensitivity there when you have a callus sometimes it's a good thing to have on your hands if you work with your hands sometimes it's a good thing to have I've heard for preachers to have a little callous on their voice on their voice box but sometimes a little callus is good it's good on our feet sometimes it can give us the ability to walk without shoes I have hypersensitive feet so I don't know I've never been able to develop a callus that big kind of wish I would but sometimes a callus is good but not when it's on our heart brothers and sisters be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven us we want to be a quick to forgive slow to speak never to Wrath Colossians 3 verse 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth we know that Jesus told the disciples it's not what you eat it's not because you live by the law it's what comes out of you out of your mouth it's not what you put into your mouth it's what comes out of your mouth that's the thing that causes all the problems First Corinthians 15 49 and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly that's common brothers and sisters and I believe it now is as we come to church As We Worship the Lord as we say Amen to the word we become the image of the Heavenly as we eat the book we become the book now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God we can never get there by our own works so we need to stop trying to have Works in our lives if we have Works a list of works that we do we need to just forget about it and we need to get saved we just need to allow the Holy Ghost to wash Us by the water of the word and that's what's going on when we have people that are continually trying to live by works because usually what's going on is they're looking at other people and examining their lives and saying well they don't do what I do and I don't do what they do works is not going to save us brothers and sisters works is Cain's religion Revelation is the one that will actually save us like Abel now this is safe Brethren flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery that's where we live right there isn't it we we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed kind of makes me wonder this this verse right here at the last Trump does Trump get elected again for another term that'll be the last Trump he won't be elected again the day which we live in is is very precarious we we have never lived in an age like we live in there's never been as much pressure as there is today we know the lid of hell was taken off many many years ago we had a prophet a Vindicated Prophet declare that to us and where we live brothers and sisters it's it's treacherous we need to be very careful where we live and once again as I speak these words I say Lord help me because I don't want to be darkening counsel I don't want to be declaring things that I don't know I want to be able to experience this and understand that that the words that I have heard about now I can see them I've heard with my ear but now mine I seeth Thee that's the scripture that we're talking about today out of Job chapter 42. and what we're talking about brothers and sisters isn't brother Barry just coming and bringing a few good words to encourage us we're not talking about having a guest Minister an evangelist come and give us a few words of encouragement or some other Pastor somewhere maybe that we stream if we have a favorite one that we stream you know it's not about that at all what it is is about the spirit of God discerning and that spirit of God has the ability to speak to us directly about needs in our lives if we're willing to allow it I remember a case in point example when I first started coming to church I was having many conversations with my wife who was a co-worker at the time asking questions about the word of God about what your religion is what do you believe you know what's all this noise about why do you behave the way you behave and and as I would ask questions she would be able to say to me there's times where I can't answer you you need to talk to someone else and and I would say okay I get it maybe it's just as far as we're going to go in our conversation about the word and that was fine and and I thought you know I will talk to maybe her father or I'll talk to brother Ken the pastor of the church and just see and we go to church the next week and brother Ken would start preaching about what we were talking about and I'd leave the service and I'd be like why did you go and talk to him you never even gave me a chance to go and have a conversation with a pastor I really wanted to talk to him about that I kind of feel a little bit you know betrayed here like what's going on with that but I found out she said I didn't tell him nothing I never said a word didn't talk to my dad didn't talk to the pastor and it took me a little while to get over myself to recognize hold on a second you're coming to church for a purpose you want to hear from God and now God is talking to you and you're going to say that it's something other than what is happening and when that happened brothers and sisters I can tell you that I knew that I got saved because now that I had a desire in my heart I would talk about it to God in my heart he would answer it without me even uttering a word and that's when I started to become very loud at amending in the church I don't know if people heard me or saw me or whatever but I recognized as I stood at the back as a deacon I don't care about anybody else here even though I love my brothers and sisters I'm here because I want to get fed and if I say Amen to the word it means sic'em to a preacher and God is going to come and speak through him to me so brothers and sisters don't let anybody hold you back when you come to church come with a purpose come to hear from God he's a Discerning spirit and when we hear preaching come from the pulpit from anybody even from a song If we hear a special brothers and sisters and it speaks to your needs that's not just someone pretending to worship that's God manifesting himself the Discerning Spirit isn't just a put on I remember having a conversation with someone saying oh discernment is only for the prophet well I want to say that there's only a prophetic class of people on Earth those people who can receive the word if it's only for the prophet but it ain't for the prophet it's not just for the prophet it's for the bride the bride if she is one with him she should be able to discern sometimes we could have a conversation with someone we were doing it just recently weren't we brother just having a conversation with someone and and suddenly it turned into this thing where the brother was like oh oh well oh uh and I didn't know anything about it but what I did was I discerned it and you know when we're Discerning it's not like God is saying into my microphone on my ear oh brother dawn so and so about such and such and and and there and then that's not the way it works the way it works is the minister gets inspired because someone says amen they go off their notes and they just start speaking and as they speak God speaks it's not a put on brothers and sisters some people might say it is but it's scriptural let's turn over to Second Kings verse verse 8. I just want to create a scriptural foundation for this and remember that God deals with man through Prophets this is the story of Elisha the king of Syria I preached on this a while ago I'm not going to go too far into it but I just want to bring this point out here verse 8 says then the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for tither the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent in a place which the man of God told and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice so multiple times this was happening the discernment was coming to the prophet he was telling the king don't go down there the syrians are going to be there verse 11 therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel who is speaking about our battle plans who is leaking the information how is this getting out this seems to be a major problem in some of the governments in the world today it's just leaked out to the media and that's what's going on here how on Earth could Israel understand so many times not once not twice who knows maybe three or four or five times escaping the king of Syria verse 12 and one of his servants said none my Lord O King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber there is a scriptural identification for what we're talking about today brothers and sisters when we are speaking we're going to give voice to God or we're going to give voice to the devil one of those two things is going to happen because a word is a thought expressed now our thinking is going to determine what's going to happen and that's why we have to make sure that we've got the Holy Ghost in our life because who can honestly who can physically take every single thought that comes into your mind into captivity on their own who can do that I know there's some people they've got a hair trigger with their mouth and sometimes I'm that person I'll just say things and I'm like oh I'd just like to take those words back but I can't they're gone at light speed the speed of sound sorry not light speed but sometimes it's that fast seems that way but you know what we're going to give voice to someone who is it going to be we know in this story here just before this the prophet of God was dealing with the the men the prophets who were out they were they were going to make some some provisions and they were digging along the riverbank and chopping with an ax and we know that the one dropped his ax head in the water it came off of his handle and he said Lord I I I we help me I I don't know what to do I borrowed this ax head and now it's gone in the water and the prophet of God came over and said oh really where did it go where did that ax head go is there anything too hard for God can you imagine having that much confidence brothers and sisters about the word of God in your mouth because I think we could have that much confidence what happened in that moment iron swam is what the Bible says that ax head swam up to the surface for that Prophet not for God it was the voice of a man that called that ax head up we know that further on here after this story The syrians came and they surrounded them they got them they heard that he was here in this town and they woke up in the morning and the servant of the prophet he woke up and he got real nervous and and we know that he saw the syrians surrounding their house and they went out we know the story real well and the prophet of God said you know there's more for us than there is against us just Lord please open this boy's eyes and show him that that there's more for us than there are against us but what I want to say brothers and sisters is that the words of the prophet he ran out to meet his enemy he didn't hide in the house he ran out to meet his enemy and said who are you looking for who is it you want and they said this Elisha Prophet that's who we want because we know that he's messing with our battle plans the king wants to meet with this boy and he said oh you know what he's not here but just follow me now some might say he lied to him but what if he made him blind he smelled him blind with the words that he spoke and said just follow me I'll show you and we know that he led them right to a table that was prepared in the presence of his enemies the king of Israel said should we kill him should we kill him and he said no no we want to minister Grace we want to be tender-hearted we want to be the ones that actually show him the spirit of Christ make a table prepare them victuals and let them know and we know what the word of God says at the end of this story they were no longer an enemy they became an ally because of the way they treated them you know that's what happens brothers and sisters when we have a brother or a sister we got a problem with if we can go and fix it it will turn around and so that we can be allies instead of enemies doesn't have to be that way but isn't it interesting how that that that works when we can recognize that if we have a burden and we have a desire and if we come to church and something is is burning within us and we just need to get an answer from God it might not come from a Pulpit it could be from a brother in the parking lot shaking our hand it could be from a Sunday school teacher downstairs it could be from a sister just shaking your hand and saying God bless you and you just have a simple conversation but she might be able to actually say something that would be of encouragement to the need that we have in our lives it could be a child it could be a husband it could be a wife could be a song leader singing a song could be a song special it could be anything could come from the the preaching of the word could come from a tape could just in devotions God will use anything to speak to us but brothers and sisters if a preacher speaks about something just say Amen to it it's not fake it's the Lord Jesus if a minister would actually hear a story and bring it to the pulpit and actually use it to slam someone they've got the wrong Spirit there's something wrong with that Ministry and you know what brothers and sisters if you ever feel like I've done that then come and talk to me because I never would it would just simply be what we're talking about today but I certainly don't want to be bringing something that would hinder people I I don't want to be darkening knowledge with my own wisdom as we read in job today job 42 but you know brothers and sisters win it it's revealed to you personally it changes everything doesn't it the spirit speaks to us and how does the spirit speak to us we just need to bring it right back to the scripture again that's why I love the message of the hour that William Mary and Branham brought some people will say you're a fanatic you're crank because you you say those words but if you just listen to what he said like I said you'll see that he always brings it back to the Bible he doesn't say I've got an addendum although he's got a lot of books and and and and things that are produced and many people will actually do it incorrectly but if you hear the pure word of what he said he always points it back to the Bible and not many people who have a prophetic calling in their lives self-proclaimed prophetic calling in their lives many other people who would simply be called prophetic by other people that want to exalt them those people they've always got some other spin on it they've always will say something else they won't just point to Christ but that's what this man did that's why I follow him and I know that's why you do as well but when the spirit speaks it's through the foolishness of preaching brothers and sisters and that's why we have to have a five-fold Ministry Ephesians 4 is enough Ephesians 4 is the only way for someone to say that Ephesians 4 is not enough that's a doctrine of a devil and I think it's terrible because sometimes people will sing a song that says that inside the Church of the Living God it's terrible Ephesians 4 is the only thing that's going to perfect us brothers and sisters it's through a five-fold Ministry it's for the Perfection of the Saints and anything other than that is going to be false Doctrine the word of God we read it on Wednesday be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect the only way we're going to get that is to follow the word for our day the only way they were perfect in Noah's day was to follow the word for their day and that word was simply get in the boat and this word today is get the Holy Ghost and the only way we're going to get the Holy Ghost is to not be baptized in the name of Father the name of son the name of Holy Ghost if we do that we're only baptized in titles who are you Baptist name you baptized in then what name is it there's no name a father isn't a name a son isn't a name and a holy ghost isn't a name but if you say the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now you're talking now you're speaking the name of God the name that he chose because we know that when Mary was visited by the angel messenger that angel messenger said that that thing that would be born of you you shall call him Jesus and we know Jesus is his name but when we say Jesus brother Brown and brings it out very clearly and I think other people would agree that there's millions of Jesus in the world right but there's only one Lord Jesus who is the Christ the Christ means the sent one means the anointed one Jesus is the name but there's only one Lord and there's only one Jesus Christ the anointed one the sent one and that's who we worship and that's God in flesh and when we do that brothers and sisters it gives us the ability to be there therefore perfect even as our father in Heaven is perfect because we take his Spirit that's why we become him we say oh oh Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I just want to I just want to worship you I want to see you come and live inside of me I want to see less of me and more of you and we know that that's what the prophet said in their days they said I must decrease so that he must increase that's the life of every single bride believer we must decrease so that he can increase the only way that happens is to go on our knees every day but you know I want to say this it doesn't take a prophet to discern the heart of a man and we talk about Discerning and being able to preach the word and how it's anointed and how it affects people you know it's not the prophet that discerns and it's not the bride that discerns it's the spirit that discerns because the spirit is a two-edged sword and we know that it will discern between right and wrong it will discern between life and death it's sharper than any two-edged sword it's discerning and Only God has the ability to discern brothers and sisters and in our day I think it's so beautiful we can see that God discerned and sometimes I I know I've taken it for granted when you listen to a prayer line you listen to uh uh a message or a tape and and you hear Brother Branham at the end of it talk to people and tell them your name is so and so would you believe if I was able to tell you where you come from if I was able to tell you why you came here here we have a man standing there and and Discerning but sometimes I think it's good just to step back take a step back and listen to that and recognize that wasn't a man speaking no man can do that we know there's been a lot of false impersonations that have risen up in light of that but that was simply God through a man talking to people how could he do it over and over and over again and never be wrong never we know that he can't ever be wrong he never was wrong but you know I just think it's wonderful I was having a conversation with my boy the other night and it was so beautiful I'd never really considered it but someone had sent around a video and I I would recommend watching it I do recommend it from the pulpit on YouTube it's called discernment of Secrets of people's hearts and Healing The Sick it's William Miriam Branham standing on stage you can see him talking to people and I believe in there he says do you feel that that's the angel of the Lord and he begins to express the thoughts in the hearts of the people and he tells them their name he tells them their address he tells them why they're here and and it's so moving and I was able to have a conversation with my boy and say do you recognize what's happening here this isn't a man speaking this is God speaking through the man to the people that's discernment and it's in our day brothers and sisters who else has done that for real discernment of Secrets of people's hearts and Healing The Sick 20th century Prophet Chicago campaign they're all on YouTube powerful powerful things to see some of the only video that you can see brother Branham in a service actually being used by God sure he was just a man but how many men had that gift and I would say not even a man and and you know what it wasn't just to heal people and and to make people feel good and to have a great campaign what it was was for one purpose and this is really where we're getting to we're just laying the background for I want to get to today we still have a half an hour Hallelujah and you know what it was is so that the gift could declare the time has come brothers and sisters that you know it's no longer time to be fed milk it's time to eat strong meat it's time to recognize the day in which we live in Revelations 10 1-7 there's going to be a time where there will be time no longer where where the mystery is going to be history but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel message when he shall begin to sound back in 1948 when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets he's never changed his problem why would he change his program why do they come up with the idea that a prophet is such a fanatical thing God's not going to change his program heavens and earth will pass away but his words will remain that's all that's the only thing that will remain like we talked about brothers and sisters not going to get into it too far but we know Revelations 10 1-7 is already fulfilled Revelations 8 to 11 is our our commission we've been given the ability to recognize it take the book and eat it and become perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect because when you read the book you become the book let me know that book brothers and sisters it's not some intangible book it's this book right here this is the book right here eat this book and you will become perfect if you're willing to consume it if you take it and you run it through the lens of a theological study through a theological University or college and and you start to pull words out and say well this word didn't mean that and and that chapter well you know it doesn't really apply because we've got you know female preachers you know what the word of God Paul is the one that said it not anybody else Paul's the one that said it let the women be silent in the church I'm not going to go too far with that but that's what Paul said and everything that brother brownham preached he said I preach what Paul preached and you know what when he saw all of us on the other side beyond the curtain of time we were screaming we're resting on that we believe that that's what we believe just the word that Paul preached we're not trying to put something fanatical or funny together here we just believe the word the way Paul preached it and you know what's so weird about that why can't the church believe that because they've missed one thing one important thing the Keystone of the Bible the name of Jesus Christ water baptism true water baptism because if you get the true baptism in water you're going to have an outward expression of the inward Spirit that's inhabiting you now and you're going to say Amen to every single word you're going to say no no no let's get that page and tape it back in the Bible let's get a glue stick and we're going to glue the other page in we're going to fit that chapter back in there because it all belongs together not one part of it contradicts another part but here we have the prophet in our day brothers and sisters in this message I just think it's so beautiful highly recommend listening to it I have heard but now I have seen he starts to tell stories and and it's such a beautiful thing he he takes his text from here I have heard but now I have seen in Job chapter 42 verse 5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eyes see a thee we have got to be able to say that ourselves brothers and sisters that's why children you can't rely on your parents experience husbands you can't rely on your wives wives you can't rely on your husbands it's got to be a personal experience that's what the new birth is the new birth is Christ revealed to the person individually personally and when that happens it changes everything about us brother Branham in this message he starts to tell the story of the little fish and it's such an insignificant thing but I just thought it was so powerful the way he talks about it in here I'd just talk about a little bit today the story of that little fish and how brother Lyle was there and he said Jehovah's Witness A friend of of the other brother a brother of the other brother they're in the boat fishing one day and and he catches this little Sunfish and and what did he do he caught it and they were trying to catch bait and they wanted to catch some bigger fish but they caught this little wood and he didn't want it so he just tore the hook out of it and threw it up into the into the reeds and said little fishy just you know shot your last wad too bad it's just a little fish who cares and all the way along for weeks before this brother Bradham was saying I believe the Lord is going to raise something from the dead I just believe that's going to happen we know that his little son Joseph got a hold of one of the kittens and they had in the house and he squished a kitten and he dropped it on its head and the kitten died and he said maybe it'll be that kitten that will be raised from the dead brother random didn't know so here they are out fishing the one day and what happens this little fish gets killed brother Bradham says to him by the way you know when you're fishing if you just set the hook before the fish can actually swallow it with a fly line you can actually just unhook it right from its jaw you'll catch it right in its mouth and you can just unhook it and let it swim away and you don't have that problem and this man was like ah we do it differently down in Texas he didn't want to listen to him and anyways that's just the story is here they are in the boat and brother Branham says out of the top of the mountain this Whirlwind came down into the lake where they were in the boat and he said stand to your feet tell that little fish to come back to life in the name of Jesus now it's so weird that it would even be that way and I I think about that many times and I think why a little fish but the prophet says it in this message very clearly it was so that he could show that he cares about the little things brothers and sisters it wasn't so that we could just say oh it's just a religious group of guys out there and God just came around and because they rubbed shoulders maybe they touched the prophet something good happened no no there is a quickening spirit but it's not about that at all he said very clearly that it was about God demonstrating that he cares about the little things so if we think he doesn't care about the little things just listen to what he says in here you can go and listen to it but he says that many a child was there in the day of Jesus to be prayed for in the day of brother Branham to be prayed for many times there's many people that needed to be prayed for in Jesus day what happened to the pool of Bethesda he walked through all those people all those people needed to be healed everyone was there because they needed healing they wanted to get in that water when it got stirred up and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when we get that Pentecostal experience and the water start to get stirred up when we actually just step into that pool anything is possible there's no different today than it was there the only thing is we just don't have a literal pool of water here but we got a literal pool of the Holy Ghost here and I'll tell you what if you ever feel you ever feel it just step into it one time and see what happens but here we have in this situation in brother branham's day many children to be prayed for but God chose to heal a little fish how do you explain that it doesn't make any sense does it but the battle says why it was to show that God looks on the little things that's his quote exactly so that God could look on the little things goes on to say he he used his power and put a curse on a tree we talked about this just before Easter when when Jesus was hungry he and and he hungered and he saw that fig tree looked on it for figs he wanted to see the fruit on that tree the one time he walked by that tree that tree should have been ready but because it wasn't ready what happened he said you know what if you're not going to be ready for me when I come by and I ask from you then never will you put forth fruit again we need to make sure we're ready when we have the opportunity because he might pass by our way but he used his power to put a curse on a tree began to wither when there was people laying everywhere needing that healing power but you see he wanted to show God's over everything whether it's small whether it's big whatever it is he's still God over all things over all creation this is out of I have heard but now I have seen then he goes into another story in there I think it's just so beautiful I'm just trying to to encourage us to recognize brothers and sisters he's demonstrating living in the third pole it's the spoken word it's the voice that we have the voice behind our voice is what I'm trying to get at if we submit that and surrender it to Satan we're putting ourselves behind I think that's the biggest hindrance to the Bride of Jesus Christ today but if we can push aside all of that and say only things that are edifying being tenderhearted and kind one to another not being stupid and not just being ridiculous but being tenderhearted and kind and recognizing that when someone else speaks viciously you know what it's just a devil in that person brothers and sisters that's what it is let's call it what it is it's not your brother it's not your sister it's the devil trying to get under your skin and God is allowing that to happen to see what you're going to do about it we're living under the spoken word condition we've heard it many times and we're going to get there today but I'll say it right now it's fine and good brother Branham says that it was just great when Jesus was in the land all the signs and wonders but when he sat down in one day and said I and my father are one then they said oh no now you're going too far and we know that William Miriam Branham had the same thing in his day the priest handed him the book didn't he the priest handed him the book it was no accident that he could his Pages were stuck together that he couldn't find the scripture and what happened the pre-sanded him the book and he he he he read the scripture and and he said precious words right proceeded from his mouth and we know the scripture he he turned around and he closed the book and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and if you listen to that's that message so many things he says in their brothers and sisters this is later much much later than we think going back to where we're at today though the next story that he goes into is about the Three Squirrels and and how he was out hunting and there was no squirrels around at all and while he was sitting there under the tree he heard a voice and the voice said something to him what are you doing Why'd You Come here what's your plans and we know that he told them he said I'm out hunting but there's no squirrels and I just don't know what to do I think I'm gonna have to go home but God said to him you want a squirrel how many of you want and he said I want three here he is having this conversation a Madman right he's not talking to anybody he hears the voice he looks around I don't see anybody has anybody else here Heard a Voice where you've looked around to see has somebody spoken to me God does that some people will say oh nobody can ever hear an audible voice he's God don't ever put him in a box as soon as you put him in a box you put a period behind them that's where that spirit is just going to go and set in the tree until you're willing to say that he's God here we have brother Branham though he's out in the woods hunting and so you want three squirrels okay how do you want it tell me how you want it so he gives them okay I think this is crazy I think I'm going crazy so I'm going to say it's just an absurd thing I'll see the squirrel run over there and jump up there and it'll sit and look at me and sure enough there's the squirrel runs over there jumps up there turns sets and looks at him and he's like wow okay so he shoots the squirrel that's one squirrel and and so he's like man this is amazing I can't believe this just happened and and I think it would be amazing and wouldn't be able to believe it just happened myself either but here we have him saying okay I think I'll just head on my way now and what happens I'll just read the quotas from paragraph 144. he said but you said do you doubt what you said brothers and sisters going back to what I've said I think this is the biggest thing that hinders the Bride of Jesus Christ Satan Creeps in and causes us to doubt and how does it happen we get condemnation in our heart we have things happen we we fall down in our lives and and we start to doubt the things that we've said that maybe God will actually hear our prayers brothers and sisters you're sealed already till the day of your Redemption you're already seated in Heavenly places if you're in Christ Jesus and if you're saying Amen to the word you're already there you're already seen it in Heavenly places you don't have to wait to get somewhere when you speak the word it's God speaking don't let Satan come around and say oh he never heard your prayer he saw what you did he knows who you are he does know who you are just remind Satan that he does know who I am he does know that I will be seated with him in his throne because that's the promise for the laodicean church and remind Satan that you're going to be cast alive into the Lake of Fire he says but you said do you doubt what you said you said you'd get three now where will the next come from can you imagine that God just anxious saying now what did you say well how can I do this for you how I just want to make this manifest so beautifully for you I just want to encourage you so incredibly I want to create a story that they'll be preaching after you go home how can I do this for you now where will the next come from can you imagine that so we know he says it I think he says up on a a pull with some poison ivy wrapped around it in such a an extremely bizarre weird place where a squirrel will never be never ever go and jump up and poison ivy never be in that situation but he says it happened there it was jumped out shot it and he said I was beginning to rub my eye rub my eyes am I losing my mind he goes over picks up the squirrel there's a squirrel and he says yeah there's blood and he throws this in there and he says a vision doesn't bleed Visions don't bleed brothers and sisters if you've ever shot anything you'll understand so then he says wow I've got three two squirrels here and this is just blowing my mind he wants to give them to me exactly how I want him and he's gonna go home now but he said you said three do you doubt what you said how many times do we doubt what we say he says I said no Lord I don't tell what I said for your confirming this is one scripture that stumped me he says not if I say but if you say not if Jesus said it but if you say it yourself but if you say it yourself and I thought somehow I broke into that channel and I I know he's here because I'm almost beside myself I thought I'll make this one ridiculous and sure enough and you know I'm not gonna go any more into that but he walked home with three squirrels and he says right after that what happened Satan came on on him Satan said to him he didn't come on him but he said Satan said to him oh look there's squirrels everywhere in the forest now when there wasn't squirrels before to try and say that's where you got your squirrels from they're all always here but there were no squirrels there and he said that very clearly he waited all morning and there was nothing then suddenly he's got three squirrels suddenly Satan is right there saying oh it wasn't what you think it was it was just they were here all along that's the way Satan Works brothers and sisters when God drops a blessing in our lap Satan's going to come around and say oh look at how good you are look what you did look at how this came together he's going to do anything and everything he can to get us to doubt but here we have the prophet of God saying God's saying to the prophet did you doubt what you said and this is where it gets real good and we probably know where this is going how he was sitting around a dinner table just sitting around with Believers at a dinner table at the right residence they're just eating cherry cobbler boy I'd like to try that sometime that sounds really good sitting around eating cherry cobbler drinking coffee talking about the word and and here we have the prophet of God saying I don't understand this I just don't understand it and he talks to brother woods and and the other brothers that are there around the table and he says you're expert squirrel Hunters have you ever seen a squirrel on those trees have you ever seen a squirrel behave that way have you ever seen anything like this before and they all agreed no no and while they're talking about it the sister has something in her heart that says that ain't nothing but the truth and here maybe this is just like a buzzword story kind of thing and I don't want it to be that way brothers and sisters I want it to be recognize your day and its message recognize that your voice has more power than I think we think many times I want to say it this way there was a sister sitting in the service right over here one time on a regular Wednesday night and she said the right thing in her heart brothers and sisters during a worship service not at the preaching of the word in worship she stood up when that voice said to her stand up and receive the healing of your breast cancer and what happened to her she received it in the name of Jesus Christ if anybody's got a question I've got her name and number we can pass it on to you and let her tell you but she was healed she received it she said be it unto me according to Thy word nobody told her to stand up if you hear that voice brothers and sisters if you have a need in your heart don't let anybody tell you anything you take that word at face value and stand up and receive it in the name of Jesus sister Addie right she said the right thing brother Bradham said I said they had they they just wasn't there I said the only thing I know it's just the same God when Abraham needed a ram he was Jehovah jira he could provide for himself I said I believe it's the same thing he's the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters what's your need what's your cry what's your desire today to come to church because you've got something on your heart if you do he's more than able to meet at brothers and sisters [Applause] he was Jehovah Jireh he could provide for himself I said I believe it's the same thing and little old Hattie sitting back there said brother Branham that ain't nothing but the truth she said the right thing when she said that the Holy Spirit dropped over in that channel again every one of them felt it don't go tell me that you can't feel it this business that the Holy Ghost is without sensation it's true when you get the Holy Ghost it's without sensation but I'll tell you what when you get close to the Lord Jesus Christ you feel them all over you brother Branham said you feel like dying we know that Eddie Biscoe said the same thing I feel like dying when I was in the car and the angel of the Lord came in between us says the Holy Spirit dropped in over that channel again and every one of them felt it I raised up and said sister Hattie thus saith the Lord you said the word like the seraphenician woman said the Holy Spirit speaking to me now and said for me to give you the desire of your heart I said now if I be God's servant if it is it'll happen if I ain't God's servant then I'm a liar and it won't happen I'm a Deceiver all you got to do is listen to this guy you just have to listen to what he says I would be a deceiver I said now try and see it's the spirit of God or not foreign and we know the story all so well he said to her if you you're broke you need money you're poor people if you want money speak the word your sister she's been sick her whole life we've prayed for her her whole life here we have the prophet of God saying we prayed for her her whole life she's sick in the wheelchair and she still doesn't come out the prophet of God Amen amen and there she was still sick how can that be but here we have money you sister what is it you want and we know it very well she only asked for one thing and that was the only thing of Eternal value her son's son sitting over there in the corner snickering regular Little Ricky's brother Brandon said just snickering and laughing about what they were talking about but what happened when she said the salvation of my sons they both came and fell right over they got baptism of the Holy Spirit right there in that meeting and I just think it's beautiful you might think I'm maybe a little bit crazy to say this you know talking about cherry cobbler I'm going to throw that plug in there again for my wife wink wink nudge nudge drinking coffee sitting around the table but brothers and sisters we might think that's just ordinary Fellowship don't be surprised if the Holy Spirit just drops in your fellowship one day and he gives you the desires of your heart because he's the same yesterday today and forever but if we get ourselves in the way we're just going to say well no it's got to be some great religious thing right it's got to be some certain way I I I'm used to the way that it's supposed to be we've got a tradition about the way it should happen if we do that we're going to put a period behind God he could come right now he could come at your lunch table this afternoon he could come and visit you at supper he could come and visit you in the lunchroom at work tomorrow we don't know just give them the Liberty to do it and watch him do it my goodness it's when it's revealed to you though that's when it becomes important that's when it becomes real it's got to be to you personally brother Bradham brings it out in this message so clearly oh my I've heard about it my whole entire life sometimes when we're a message kid we've only ever been fed the pure word we've heard about it our whole entire lives but it's got to become real to us individually and you know what when that happens brothers and sisters it don't matter if you've gone out into the world and you've come back doesn't matter what you've gone through when it's become real to you you don't care who's watching when you worship you don't care what you look like you don't care about none of the other things in this world except for that one thing the pearl of great price when it's been revealed to you but it's got to be to you brother Branham says and it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence see and that's really the biggest thing brothers and sisters we just get this lack of confidence and I'm talking about myself when I say this I've done it many times and like I said when I went down to North Carolina I was having a conversation with brother Daryl Ward and it might sound so Elementary and silly and forgive me if I'm a pastor and this is my walk but we all are growing we're all on a journey brothers and sisters but it just became so clear to me I was talking about my son how we went into a prayer line Brother Kelly's Church in grenthal Saskatchewan and we tried we applied for life insurance for our youngest son we wanted to get life insurance for him it's the cheapest time to buy it when they're young when they're first born so we apply for life insurance and he had something wrong with his lungs he had an infection in his lungs the first year he was in the hospital with pneumonia the second year he was in the hospital with pneumonia the third year he was in the hospital with pneumonia over and over again and they said you know what because of that we're not going to give you life insurance for him and what does that do to a parent's thinking that does something serious you start to think whoa if they're not going to insure a baby what does that mean is he not going to live so then the Devil comes around and starts talking so the parents start praying we went to a prayer line in Saskatchewan grenthal Saskatchewan brother Daryl Ward was there this isn't to glorify the man it's to tell you the story of how I've grown and learned and so we go there and we got prayed for and he got healed he got 100 healed he hasn't had pneumonia since but brother Daryl Ward told him just go on saying I'm Healed he was talking to a four-year-old boy at the time so here I am now many years later three years four years later down in North Carolina just having a coffee conversation with brother Daryl Ward and and I said yeah you know you remember you prayed for my son there and and I'm sorry because I seem to say it every single time but it's real significant to me every time I meet you I just can't help but give God the glory because you're the guy that God used and it's just such a wonderful thing and he said to me you know what brother I can't do nothing it's only God that heals and you just have to allow God to do the work all you do is pray the prayer of faith and it sounds so Elementary but it clicked for me I just need to be in my position when I'm in my position just worrying about me just minding me then God can do his thing but when I'm there trying to jump up and down and anoint with oil and scream and shout and make it happen God's not going to do it brother Branham says it you could dump a gallon of oil and you could shout till your horse you're gonna move a devil oh my but if you just simply speak the word by faith speak the word from your position and just see if God won't move brother Adam says and it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence see see we've got to have confidence I want this to the honor and glory of God then faith has a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine Faith from God and I think brothers and sisters there's been times in my life where I've had mental intellectual faith and this is what I'm getting to it's so beautiful because I just believe God's made this so real to me and it's no longer up to me I just need to have confidence towards God that's all just have confidence towards him that he could come on the scene anytime anywhere and all I've got to do is just say Amen to the word and let him do the work he says that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you to the healing that you're looking for so job checking himself with the genuine faith that God had give to him that he was just that he had done everything that God required him to do now when we're going to be prayed for for our sickness I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do and I just want to pause there for a second and say it again now when we're going to be prayed for I wonder prayer prayed for our sickness I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do have we followed every iota of the scripture have we give them our hearts and lives to service and you know brothers and sisters I want to say this if we have anything in our lives that's residual that's just been swept under the rug from years ago and maybe we got a little bit of a callus in our our heart I heard something this week that I thought was really interesting I don't know if I've ever heard it before is where pearls come from pearls come from a grain of sand getting inside one of those clams whatever it is and and that sand the way it gets around in there and it causes this this this turmoil inside the creature and that's what causes the Pearl and the context that it was brought up was those great pearly gates in Heaven 12 of them and the reason they're pearls is because of the tremendous trial the tremendous Agony that people went through just like a little Pearl that we would see is a grain of sand inside a little animal but if we've got the little tiny grain of sand inside of our hearts somewhere brothers and sisters the devil knows it and we know it and God knows it and we're not going to get what we want there's going to be something there standing in the way of our prayers we have got to come as the prophet said having every iota of the scripture followed in our lives have we give him our hearts and lives to service what is the reason you want to be healed that's what the prophet says it's interesting isn't it what's the reason you want to be healed that would even go so further as to say it was actually God saying that through the prophet what's the reason you want to be healed that's the reason you can't get Faith enough see because you haven't maybe made this thing to God sincerely from your heart like Hezekiah did give God the reason he wanted to set his kingdom in order and God sent his Prophet back and told him and he'd be healed see but you have to have those things made right first we can't have any lingering things there can't be anything swept under the rug it made me think about Aiken and the children of Israel he wanted that Babylonian garment and the and the wedge of gold and took it and hid it under his camp in his in his house and we know that him and his whole entire family perished for it Brothers as husbands We've Got No Room for anything to be hidden in our lives our wives mothers we've got no room in our lives for anything to be hidden we've got to be able to declare it all to God give it all to him brother random goes on to say so then as soon as you get to these places and know that it's been revealed to you by the word of God by the Revelation by the word that God requires you to do then you have faith genuine Faith but it takes a bit of work to get there we've got to really go in and clean things out and not have any room for anything to linger we can't have any grudges we can't have any any past hurts there can't be any calluses that we can say this thing happened to me and and I just can't get past it if we do that God's gonna say what happened to me I came and gave my entire life we need to make sure that we're willing to give him our all boy oh boy so many times I wonder how will I ever have enough but there's always too much you know there has to be a time brothers and sisters where this becomes real to us brother Branham says now we're promised a church age through reformers and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 that he'd keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic father for that very purpose and the church is so broke up in denominations and isms so tore to Pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared Revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service not the first and second polls but the third poll brothers and sisters that I and my father as one are one this is the Spoken Word season that we live in Jesus was a great guy as long as he could heal the sick but he said when I and my father are one that's when everything changed that's when it became a problem for him you know brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us today maybe I'll call the musicians all of the mechanics have been here but I want to say all the Dynamics are as well we have both we're not lacking either personally I feel the only thing we've got that's hindering the bride body of Jesus Christ is our words and the world that we live in is totally set up to be negative one hundred percent you know brother Bradham he says it in uh oh my I can't remember what the message is I I just bounced around and listen to so many of them but you know in the beginning of one of the messages um he says you know I just I just really hope I I don't become I think it's one of the worst things as a human being to become a crowded old person that's just angry and bitter and if we're not careful brothers and sisters if we let things linger we're going to have that grain of sand inside the inside and it's just going to work around and it's going to turn into a highly polished Stone because it's going to come out it's going to be expressed in our lives but if we're not careful it's going to be a very difficult thing to get out of us and I think I could be wrong but I think that the clams or whatever the animals are that grow pearls I don't think they live to give up their pearls I think they have to die to give up their pearls you know we've got all the mechanics and we've got all the Dynamics the only thing we need to do is just get ourselves out of the way first John chapter 3 where if our heart condemn us not God if our heart condemn us sorry God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God that's where I think I want I just want to say it again maybe stand with me as we close brothers and sisters when we don't have a good feeling about maybe something that we've have in our lives just remember you're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're not seeing how many places here in Calgary Living Word assembly in these chairs that were purchased at one time you see that in Heavenly places spiritually speaking because you believe the word of God for your day and that alone should mean that your heart doesn't condemn you Satan wants to say that your heart condemns you Satan wants me to say that my heart condemns me that I'm not seen in Heavenly places I know what I did I know what I said I know what I looked at I know all about it I know all the things in my life my shortcomings those words that were uttered that should never have been said but were boy but if we can just look past that like I said once upon a time if we could look at our problems our shortcomings if we could look at ourselves the way that he looks at us through that Pillar of Fire if we could do that brothers and sisters we would see that we're already seated Heavenly places we're already perfect because we accept the word for our day that's what gives us Perfection is that we believe and whatsoever we ask of him we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things which are Pleasant in a sight I just think it's so beautiful we have the ability brothers and sisters just to have this word to recognize that even though we've heard it and heard it and heard it there Comes A Time in our lives where we can say now I see and I would recommend if you want to just hear the expanded version is just listen to that message that I was referring to I have heard but now I've seen in 1965 brother Branham he just expresses those stories so much better than I did and he explains to us that it's up to us to speak the word because when we speak words like that brothers and sisters we're always going to speak the word according to the word we're never going to get outside of the word you don't have to be afraid of that the devil wants us to be afraid of that and say it's fanatical maybe we'll say something wrong maybe we'll cause something terrible to happen that's not going to happen we won't do that anyways I'll stop talking I just want to say God bless you don't be discouraged be encouraged and just believe the word and that will cause you to be a nuisance to the devil let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word thank you Father for the Vindicated Prophet that you sent Lord to show this world that Lord you have come Lord we know that there is a coming and there is an appearing and we'll get into that but father we just want to thank you for giving us your word Lord for giving us the ability to receive your word in the day in which we live because we recognize by doing that Lord we will come according to your word and when we come according to your word then we receive your spirit and when we receive your spirit Lord Jesus you live out through us and we no longer have condemnation in our lives father I pray that you would just go with each one of us as we go our separate way today and father let us feel you or Jesus don't let us get caught up with some dogmatic theory that we don't feel you we know the the story and we know the the way people have brought it and spun it but Lord Jesus we know your Prophet you said through the prophet that Pentecost is not a denomination it's an experience father I pray that we could have a Pentecostal experience in our lives Lord we're not going back to Pentecost we're marching on to Zion and father we know that as we March forward and as we shout the name of Jesus Christ all around the enemy's walls they fall down flat father we pray that you would just go with us now as we go our separate ways that you would be glorified in every aspect of Our Lives Lord in our homes and our families in our jobs Lord let us speak good words father let us speak encouraging things father let us be kind and tenderhearted one to another recognizing that father we're not going to grieve your spirit we're going to encourage your spirit between us Lord that the world around us would be able to say that truly they are Christians because not because they say they love you because they love one another father we just love you and we thank you for your goodness to us we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you near The Cross near The Cross maybe the chorus in the ground foreign [Music] good morning baby baby [Music]
