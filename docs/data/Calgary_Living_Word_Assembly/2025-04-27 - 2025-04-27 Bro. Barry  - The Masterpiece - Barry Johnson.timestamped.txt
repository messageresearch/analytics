[23:46] together. Confident in the knowledge
[23:49] that we are a child of the King, Lord
[23:51] Jesus. Confident, Lord, that you wanted

[24:03] just waiting for the last ones to come

[24:41] Amen. You may have your seats this
[24:43] morning. Just as Brother Sam came up,
[24:46] I've got a little bouquet for you,
[24:47] brother Sam. In front of the whole
[24:49] church, I was talking about Dwayne Far.
[24:51] He was flying and voice came over this
[24:54] intercom. This is your captain speaking,
[24:56] Sam Brennan.
[24:57] What? Sam the Sam. Anyway, he had a
[25:01] chance to go to the cockpit later, I
[25:03] believe. But the the neat thing about
[25:06] this story is Brother Dwayne was talking
[25:08] to some of the stewardists and they had
[25:10] such a
[25:11] glowing commentary about Brother Sam and
[25:14] who he was as a Christian. It just was
[25:16] evident that he had a testimony through
[25:18] the whole West Court organization. So,
[25:20] Brother Sam, may God richly bless you.
[25:22] You got every one of us have a have a
[25:24] little have a little testimony, right?
[25:26] wherever we are.
[25:28] Yes. God bless you, my brother. Haven't
[25:31] flown with you yet, so I'm gonna have to
[25:33] try and do that and orchestrate that.
[25:35] I'm thinking of the rapture. You sang it
[25:37] this or you you you prayed it this

[35:00] again father, when we meet like this, we
[35:03] don't take it for granted.

[35:14] once again. Father, bringing our

[36:00] this century Lord and it is our prayer
[36:03] that Lord you meet that need and when

[36:23] Tomorrow might not be there for us. This
[36:26] is the time for us to worship you.
[36:30] Father, this morning once again, we want
[36:32] to ask you to continue to help brother
[36:34] Paul leading songs here. Lord Jesus, the
[36:38] inspired songs that he has prepared to
[36:40] bring it. Lord, may we receive it as
[36:44] well as the pastor labored all night to
[36:47] bring your word, to bring your mind.
[36:49] Help us to receive the word that is
[36:52] about to come. When all said and done,
[36:55] we shall be careful to give you thanks.
[36:58] Now, Father, we bring in our tithes and
[36:59] offering. We ask you to receive it and
[37:02] bless it for in Jesus name that we pray.
[37:05] Amen. Amen.
[37:12] [Music]
[37:14] Just the uh first verse of that in the
[37:17] chorus.
[37:20] What a friend we have in

[39:03] Preious Savior still our

[39:46] [Music]
[40:06] check.
[40:12] Check. Check.
[40:15] Bless you.
[40:18] This is impromptu this morning, but I
[40:20] believe it to be a blessing. Brother
[40:21] Paul was asking if there was a special,
[40:23] and I thought
[40:25] Well, I have a reason to praise the
[40:26] Lord. So, I will bring this any way it
[40:29] sounds. It's going to be a blessing.
[40:36] I'll praise in the
[40:39] valley. Praise on the
[40:45] mountain. I'll praise when I'm
[40:49] sure. Praise when I'm doubting.
[40:55] I'll praise when
[40:58] outnumbered. I praise when
[41:01] [Music]
[41:03] surrounded. God's praise is the
[41:07] waters my enemy drowns
[41:13] in. As long as I'm breathing, I've got a
[41:17] reason to
[41:19] pray.
[41:21] Praise the Lord, oh my
[41:26] soul. I got to
[41:31] praise the Lord, oh my
[41:35] soul. I'll praise when I feel
[41:39] it. Praise when I don't.
[41:46] I praise God cuz I
[41:48] know you're still in
[41:54] control. My praise is the
[41:57] weapon. It's more than a sound. More
[42:01] than a
[42:03] sound. My praise is the shout that
[42:07] brings cherry call down.
[42:12] Oh, as long as I'm breathing, I've got a
[42:17] reason to
[42:21] praise the
[42:22] Lord. Oh my
[42:25] soul, I got to
[42:30] praise you,
[42:31] Lord. Oh my
[42:35] soul, I wouldn't be quiet. My God is
[42:39] alive. How could I keep it inside? I've
[42:44] got to
[42:48] pray, Lord. Oh my
[43:02] soul. Our praise cause you're so sorry.
[43:05] Praise cause you rain. Praise cause you
[43:09] rose. and defeated the grace. Our praise
[43:12] cause you're faithful. Praise cause
[43:15] you're true. Praise God cuz there's
[43:18] nobody greater than you.
[43:24] Praise the Lord. Oh my soul.
[43:29] I've got
[43:31] [Music]
[43:32] [Applause]
[43:37] them. I've got
[43:39] [Music]
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:45] them. I won't be quiet. No, I wouldn't
[43:49] be quiet. My God is alive. How could I
[43:54] keep it inside? I won't be quiet.
[43:59] My God is alive. How could I keep it? I
[44:04] won't be
[44:07] quiet. My God is alive. How could I keep
[44:12] it inside? I've got to
[44:18] praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[44:24] [Music]
[44:42] Heat. Heat.
[45:02] Yeah, you want to start doing some laps
[45:04] around, don't you?
[45:07] Not enough room in here, as they would
[45:08] say, to accept my praise. But thank you,
[45:11] my brother, for encouraging us with that
[45:13] song and thinking of David, how he cast
[45:16] away spirits from Saul with song. That
[45:18] was an encouraging song. would
[45:19] encourage, he would uplift. Brother
[45:21] Faren did that this morning. To me, I
[45:23] know he did it for all of you through
[45:25] the through the gift God gave him. He
[45:27] gave praise to the Lord this morning.
[45:28] Stand with me would just finish with
[45:30] this song as our pastor would come.
[45:32] Let's start with the
[45:34] chorus. Just prayerfully sing it to him.
[45:38] Brother Peter prayed a piece of this
[45:40] song that came to me this this morning
[45:42] and it was brother Random's comment. May
[45:44] the presence of Christ not go unre or
[45:47] may it not go unrecognized. May we
[45:48] recognize the presence of the Lord. I
[45:50] believe it's a sermon title, but Peter
[45:53] kind of prayed that together. May we not
[45:55] miss the presence of the Lord this
[45:57] morning. He's here. He's absolutely
[46:00] here. No question about that. Now, the
[46:02] question is, what will we do with this
[46:04] Jesus called Christ? Amen. Savior,
[46:07] Savior, would you hear my humble cry?
[46:09] Come to my seat this morning.
[46:14] [Music]
[46:19] Saveior. Oh my
[46:22] [Music]
[46:27] savior. Oh,
[46:29] hear
[46:31] my
[46:34] humble cry.
[46:41] Oh
[46:42] Lord
[46:45] why
[46:47] all the
[46:49] sound are
[46:54] calling. Oh Lord
[46:59] you not
[47:01] pass me. But let's sing that chorus one
[47:05] more time. Ac capello just worship to
[47:07] the Lord.
[47:10] Oh
[47:16] saveior. Oh my
[47:23] savior.
[47:24] Oh
[47:26] here
[47:28] my
[47:31] humble cry.
[47:36] [Music]
[47:41] Oh, all
[47:48] our
[47:51] holy, oh Lord,
[47:55] do not
[47:58] pass
[48:00] me by. Bow the spring of all my comfort.
[48:03] All together now.
[48:06] Oh,
[48:09] that the
[48:12] spring of all my
[48:17] love. Aren't you happy you feel this way
[48:20] about your feet? For you're
[48:23] more than I
[48:37] to have
[48:41] I beside
[48:46] [Music]
[48:52] [Applause]
[48:58] [Music]
[49:06] [Applause]
[49:08] together. Oh my
[49:11] [Music]
[49:31] Oh,
[49:34] heat, heat.
[49:44] [Music]
[49:57] Is that your prayer this morning? God
[49:59] richly bless you today.
[50:02] He is more than able and willing and
[50:06] he's here.
[50:08] If you have a need this morning, maybe
[50:10] just make it known unto him by way of an
[50:12] uplift hand. We just want to bring a
[50:14] praise report this morning from brother
[50:16] Don Snow. He said seven to eight months
[50:18] ago at a prayer
[50:21] meeting. Brothers and sisters, there's
[50:23] power in prayer.
[50:26] And you know, many times we'll have
[50:28] people say, "Well, I've got secret
[50:29] prayer in my closet." And we have to
[50:31] have that. But we also have to have
[50:34] prayer meetings.
[50:36] At a prayer meeting seven to eight
[50:37] months ago, Brother Don Snow, he brought
[50:40] forth a prayer request, a petition for
[50:44] the Lord's guidance and hand in a work
[50:47] situation. And you know, he said, "The
[50:49] Lord has steadily brought this prayer to
[50:51] pass."
[50:54] [Applause]
[50:55] Amen.
[51:04] Now, I don't know what it means, but he
[51:06] goes on to say that all my heart's
[51:08] desire has been fulfilled.
[51:12] Hallelujah. And we know that means
[51:14] praise our God. God bless you, brother
[51:16] Don. We just uh want to remember the
[51:19] carpenter's nephew. Welcome to the
[51:22] carpenters who are visiting. God bless
[51:24] you. And uh just a couple of unspoken
[51:26] requests. If you have a need this
[51:28] morning, maybe just defy gravity and
[51:30] make it known unto him by way of an
[51:32] uplift hand as we go to him. Gracious
[51:35] heavenly father, Lord, we're so thankful
[51:37] that we can gather together in your name
[51:39] because we know your word declares that
[51:41] you're there. Father, we have way more
[51:44] than the requirements according to your
[51:46] word. And Father, we're just so thankful
[51:48] that we can take you at your word. Oh
[51:51] Lord, we don't need to have some the
[51:53] theological understanding of it, Lord,
[51:56] but we take it by revelation. And
[51:59] Father, we know revelation only comes by
[52:01] your spirit, Father. And there's no way
[52:03] that we can take you and cut you into
[52:06] three persons, three distinct persons.
[52:09] It doesn't even make sense according to
[52:11] English. And Father, we just take you
[52:13] the way that you have presented yourself
[52:15] to us in this age. We take the
[52:17] revelation that you've given us by your
[52:19] spirit and we thank you, Father, for the
[52:22] position that you've placed us in. We
[52:24] know that it's only by your grace that
[52:26] we're saved through faith. And Lord, we
[52:29] just want to just give you praise, Lord.
[52:31] We thank you for the song special this
[52:33] morning. Lord, we can't even give you
[52:36] enough praise, Lord. How could we ever
[52:38] give you enough praise, Lord? We have so
[52:41] much to thank you for, Lord Jesus.
[52:44] Father, we just thank you for each and
[52:46] every life represented here today, Lord.
[52:48] For traveling mercies to make it here,
[52:51] Lord. Amen. Father, we pray that you
[52:53] would just bless each need that was made
[52:55] known unto you today by the way of an
[52:57] uplift hand. Father, maybe some hearts,
[53:00] Lord, that have needs that are heavy
[53:02] that just didn't raise their hand. Lord,
[53:05] you know our hearts, Father. There is
[53:07] nothing hidden from you today. Our
[53:09] thoughts in our hearts are louder in
[53:11] heaven than our words are here
[53:14] today than our thoughts are. Father,
[53:16] even in our own hearts, Lord Jesus, we
[53:19] pray that you would sovereignly meet the
[53:21] needs in each and every one of our lives
[53:23] today. Amen. Father, we pray that you
[53:26] would be with the carpenter's nephew.
[53:28] Lord, we thank you for touching the
[53:30] unspoken request. Lord, Father, we're so
[53:33] thankful that we have a place of refuge,
[53:36] that we have a strong tower that we can
[53:38] run into, Father. Lord Jesus, that your
[53:42] spirit raises a standard when the enemy
[53:44] comes in like a flood, like he has in
[53:48] 2025 in every area of this world.
[53:51] Father, we're so thankful for this place
[53:53] of refuge. Amen. We just ask now, Lord,
[53:56] that you would be glorified. That's all
[53:58] with all that's said and done. Lord, as
[54:00] we go forwards in this service this
[54:01] morning, let it be all glorifying unto
[54:05] you, Father. Let it be edifying unto
[54:07] your body, Lord Jesus. Help us to
[54:10] recognize our position in you, Father.
[54:13] We just ask all these things in Jesus
[54:16] Christ's name we pray.
[54:18] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[54:21] musicians. I just was looking at the
[54:24] musicians this morning and was just so
[54:28] thankful. There's not one empty seat on
[54:30] the stage here and uh I don't know if we
[54:33] could fit another musician on the stage.
[54:36] What a tremendous offering it is unto
[54:38] the Lord. Amen. What a tremendous
[54:40] offering it is unto the body to to give
[54:43] of a gift so that we could actually have
[54:46] an atmosphere set as we already heard.
[54:49] Let's give them a round of applause.
[54:51] Thank you.
[54:59] Musicians to think about what they do.
[55:02] Brothers and sisters, the musicians,
[55:05] they battle to play in their position.
[55:08] The song leader battles to sing songs.
[55:12] The preacher battles to find the mind of
[55:14] the Lord to preach. All of them desiring
[55:18] to find the mind of the Lord so that we
[55:21] can be blessed. So that we can have an
[55:23] atmosphere where the Holy Spirit is free
[55:25] to move from heart to heart. What a
[55:28] tremendous blessing it is. I just was
[55:31] thinking we're we're running at full
[55:32] capacity here in terms of being able to
[55:35] offer worship unto the Lord, aren't we?
[55:38] And then to go another step further to
[55:40] think that some can go away, we can be
[55:43] away and others can just step right in.
[55:47] God bless you, brother Aiden and Sister
[55:48] Michelle for putting your shoulder to
[55:51] the
[55:56] wheel. You know, there's a reason why we
[55:59] worship and why we're even talking like
[56:00] this. And I'm sure we're preaching to
[56:02] the choir. Amen. But for those people,
[56:05] maybe our our pure minds just need to be
[56:07] stirred up by way of remembrance. We
[56:10] come out of this world. We're not of
[56:11] this world.
[56:13] We come out of this world, living in
[56:15] this world. And we've got things in our
[56:17] lives that we've got to push aside.
[56:19] We've got to try and get out of the way
[56:21] so that we can actually find the mind of
[56:23] the Lord ourselves when we come to
[56:25] service. That's why the prophet said,
[56:26] "Come to church half an hour early." Not
[56:28] so that you can be a legalistic
[56:30] individual and say, "I was there exactly
[56:32] 30 minutes before the service was
[56:34] supposed to start. It's so that you can
[56:36] actually concentrate on the Lord. So
[56:38] that we can meditate on the Lord and get
[56:41] those evil spirits that are trying to
[56:43] get us down out of the way." And I just
[56:46] so appreciated what I heard in the song
[56:48] special playing the guitar with the
[56:51] heart. Some would say with the hand.
[56:54] That was with a heart. singing a song
[56:57] special. We got a reason to rejoice, to
[57:00] praise the Lord. I mean, how many people
[57:03] here don't have a reason to give him
[57:04] glory?
[57:08] But you know what? David cast out evil
[57:10] spirits
[57:12] with the stringed instruments. And some
[57:14] people might be saying, "Brother Barry,
[57:15] we're churchgoing people. We come to
[57:17] church. We're not evil." You know what?
[57:19] One word off is evil. It's either good
[57:22] or it's evil.
[57:24] Sometimes we just need to actually, what
[57:27] do you call it in in in natural terms?
[57:29] Exfoliate. We just need to scrape off
[57:32] all that dead scar tissue and get it out
[57:34] of the way so we can get down to the the
[57:36] the meat
[57:38] of the situation. I just feel encouraged
[57:40] to be here today. God bless you. If you
[57:42] have your Bibles, turn with me to Isaiah
[57:45] chapter 53. I'm going to preach a little
[57:47] bit on the resurrection today myself. I
[57:49] hope it's okay. It's still the
[57:50] resurrection season until the rapture
[57:52] happens. It's the resurrection season
[57:55] and that's the way it is. It's so
[57:56] beautiful. But we're just coming out of
[57:58] uh Easter Sunday and Palm Sunday and the
[58:01] whole
[58:03] resurrection celebrations. Isaiah
[58:05] chapter 53. Today I'll be preaching on
[58:09] the service the masterpiece in
[58:12] 1964. Isaiah chapter 53.
[58:17] Who hath believed our report? And to
[58:20] whom is the arm of the Lord
[58:23] revealed? For he shall grow up before
[58:26] him as a tender plant, and as a root out
[58:29] of dry ground. Amen. He hath no form,
[58:34] nor calmliness. And when we shall see
[58:36] him, there is no beauty that we should
[58:40] desire
[58:41] him. If we are trying to be in the image
[58:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ, brothers and
[58:48] sisters, ought we to have an
[58:51] image after reading this scripture
[58:54] here. Verse three, he is despised and
[58:58] rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
[59:01] acquainted with
[59:02] grief, and we hid as it were our faces
[59:07] from him. Amen.
[59:10] We know that all of his disciples
[59:12] scrambled to get
[59:13] away. He was
[59:15] despised and we esteemed him not. Amen.
[59:19] Surely he hath borne our griefs and
[59:22] carried our sorrows.
[59:25] Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten
[59:28] of God, and
[59:30] afflicted. But he was wounded for our
[59:33] transgressions, and he was bruised for
[59:36] our iniquities.
[59:38] The chastisement of our peace was upon
[59:42] him. Amen. And sister Mary Janette and
[59:46] with his stripes
[59:48] you are healed.
[59:53] All we like sheep have gone astray.
[59:56] We have turned everyone to his own
[59:59] way. And the Lord hath laid on him the
[1:00:02] iniquity of us all. Amen. He was
[1:00:06] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[1:00:09] opened not his mouth. And you know he
[1:00:11] could have just said
[1:00:13] now 12,000 legions of
[1:00:17] angels. Destroy them all. But he didn't.
[1:00:21] That's right. He could have.
[1:00:25] My He was oppressed and he was afflicted
[1:00:29] yet he opened not his mouth.
[1:00:32] He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:00:34] and as a sheep before his shears is
[1:00:37] dumb. So he opened not his mouth God in
[1:00:42] the
[1:00:44] flesh. He was taken from prison and from
[1:00:47] judgment. And who shall declare his
[1:00:50] generation? For he was cut off out of
[1:00:53] the land of the
[1:00:55] living. For the transgression of my
[1:00:57] people was he stricken. We can look at
[1:01:00] this and say, "For my transgression,
[1:01:02] yes,
[1:01:04] was he stricken and he made his grave
[1:01:07] with the wicked and with the rich in his
[1:01:10] death because he hath done no
[1:01:12] violence. Neither was there any deceit
[1:01:15] in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to
[1:01:19] bruise him." Amen. He hath put him to
[1:01:23] grief. When thou shalt make his soul an
[1:01:26] offering for sin, he shall see his seed.
[1:01:30] He shall prolong his days, and the
[1:01:32] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:01:36] his
[1:01:36] hand. He shall see of the travail of his
[1:01:40] soul, and shall be
[1:01:43] satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[1:01:46] righteous servant justify many, for he
[1:01:50] shall bear their iniquities. Amen.
[1:01:54] Therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:01:57] with the great, and he shall divide the
[1:01:59] spoil with the strong, because he hath
[1:02:02] poured out his soul unto death. And he
[1:02:06] was numbered with the
[1:02:07] transgressors, and he bare the sin of
[1:02:10] many, and made
[1:02:12] intercession for the transgressors.
[1:02:16] Let's just bow one more time.
[1:02:18] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that
[1:02:21] you and you
[1:02:23] alone made and make intercession for us
[1:02:29] transgressors.
[1:02:31] Heavenly Father, reading this scripture
[1:02:35] today, understanding that you saw fit
[1:02:38] for your son to be bruised for my sin,
[1:02:41] Lord, for my chastisement. Oh father,
[1:02:44] for our iniquities,
[1:02:46] Lord Jesus, stripes for our healing.
[1:02:48] Help us, Lord Jesus, to receive the full
[1:02:51] benefit of everything that was mentioned
[1:02:53] here, Lord. Oh, Father, and to have a
[1:02:56] consciousness in our lives of what you
[1:02:58] went through for our sakes. Yes. Amen.
[1:03:02] Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank
[1:03:03] you. We just commit this scripture
[1:03:05] reading into your hands now. We pray
[1:03:07] that you would break it open by
[1:03:09] revelation to us once again. In Jesus
[1:03:12] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[1:03:14] you this morning. You may be
[1:03:20] seated. Certainly. Oh my. Glad to be
[1:03:23] back. Just like to welcome our visitors.
[1:03:26] Yes. Sister Chantel, Brother John, and
[1:03:29] Brother Patrick. I don't know if you've
[1:03:31] been here before, but we certainly want
[1:03:32] to welcome you here and trust you feel
[1:03:34] right at home.
[1:03:37] I'd like to also welcome Sister
[1:03:41] Neve. I haven't seen her since she
[1:03:44] arrived. And uh I would like to
[1:03:46] personally congratulate you on your
[1:03:48] engagement, sister. God bless
[1:03:50] you. Amen.
[1:03:59] And last but not least in terms of the
[1:04:01] welcomes, certainly not least, we'd like
[1:04:04] I would like to welcome brother Jeriel
[1:04:07] Odenovo. Amen. God bless you, brother. I
[1:04:10] don't even know if he's here today. He's
[1:04:12] at home with
[1:04:14] mama. God bless you, sister, if you're
[1:04:17] watching. And uh we're certainly excited
[1:04:20] to meet brother Jerio. Certainly a
[1:04:23] blessing to see the deliverance of a
[1:04:26] child and uh just to see the little life
[1:04:29] there. You know, it's so significant to
[1:04:32] a Christian I believe and the Christian
[1:04:34] walk because we know the children came
[1:04:37] after Jesus when he was here and the
[1:04:39] disciples tried sheing them away and
[1:04:42] Jesus said, "No, you got it wrong, man.
[1:04:44] These these children are supposed to
[1:04:46] come unto me. Suffer the little children
[1:04:48] to come unto me. In fact, I if you're
[1:04:50] not willing to come earnestly as a
[1:04:52] little child unto me, you won't even see
[1:04:54] the kingdom of heaven.
[1:04:56] It's pretty significant for children.
[1:05:00] Anyways, um just bring you greetings
[1:05:02] from uh the Grenal Church in uh Grenal,
[1:05:05] Saskatchewan and Saskatoon Tabernacle uh
[1:05:08] just north of Saskatoon. We uh took one
[1:05:11] service at the Saskatoon Tabernacle and
[1:05:14] I was able to just sit and participate
[1:05:16] in the service at the Grenal Church for
[1:05:19] Sunday service. Easter Sunday was
[1:05:21] wonderful. Brother Jonas Hilderbrandt,
[1:05:23] he took the service. His parents were
[1:05:25] away for the weekend. So it was uh just
[1:05:28] a wonderful time of fellowship. Really
[1:05:31] sad to see a soldier go. We had to lay
[1:05:35] to rest Brother Pete Clawson, Brother
[1:05:37] Paul's dad, and I'm sure everyone is
[1:05:39] well acquainted with why we went. That
[1:05:41] was the purpose of our journey. And we
[1:05:43] just thought we would visit a few other
[1:05:45] people while we were there. And uh yeah,
[1:05:49] so it's certainly good to be back. I
[1:05:50] just want to thank everyone for your
[1:05:53] help and keeping things going in
[1:05:55] ourstead. the musicians, the song
[1:05:57] leaders, um the brothers, brother
[1:06:00] Emanuel and brother Mvin, the uh
[1:06:02] ministry, you know, witnessing the
[1:06:04] resurrection, justified by the
[1:06:06] resurrection. And today we're going to
[1:06:08] talk about the masterpiece of the
[1:06:10] resurrection. It's a wonderful thing to
[1:06:13] uh to just go away and know that
[1:06:16] everything is going to be looked after.
[1:06:18] And in fact, to have even have
[1:06:20] encouragement to to go away and just
[1:06:22] know that everything is going to be okay
[1:06:23] instead of worrying and and maybe
[1:06:26] fussing that things maybe aren't going
[1:06:28] to be okay. It really means a lot. So,
[1:06:30] thank you very much each and everyone.
[1:06:34] Today I want to talk as I mentioned
[1:06:35] about the masterpiece preached in
[1:06:38] 1964 and uh brother Batam he talks about
[1:06:42] how he went to Forest Lawn Cemetery in
[1:06:45] California and while he was there he
[1:06:48] went and paid respects. I find this very
[1:06:51] interesting and and maybe some watched I
[1:06:54] don't know I preached on Wednesday night
[1:06:55] about the masterpiece and I'm going to
[1:06:56] do that today as well. I just got so
[1:06:59] many inspiration nuggets out of it. I I
[1:07:02] had to just follow the leadership here.
[1:07:05] And if you haven't, um maybe if you
[1:07:08] listen to the message, you'll understand
[1:07:09] maybe some of the inspiration. But you
[1:07:11] know, it's in 1964 and Brother Bradom
[1:07:13] is, you know, basically in the twilight
[1:07:15] days of his ministry, of his life. He he
[1:07:19] basically lived uh probably for another
[1:07:21] year after he preached this message and
[1:07:24] not much longer. and uh you know maybe
[1:07:27] not even he didn't uh I don't know what
[1:07:30] the time frame is but he didn't have
[1:07:32] very much time left on earth when he
[1:07:34] preached this message but at the end of
[1:07:36] his ministry some people would say you
[1:07:38] know there's such a thing as progressive
[1:07:39] revelation and brother Bham preached
[1:07:40] something when he was younger and then
[1:07:42] he changed it when he got older and I'm
[1:07:44] not going down that road with this what
[1:07:46] I am saying is that near the end of his
[1:07:48] ministry he went and he said that he
[1:07:51] respected the woman preacher of Amy
[1:07:54] Simple McFersonson
[1:07:56] He respected what she did for the
[1:07:58] gospel. Now, here you have a
[1:08:01] dispensational
[1:08:02] prophet, saying that he went to pay
[1:08:05] respects to her at her grave in Forest
[1:08:09] Lawn Cemetery in California. Pretty
[1:08:12] amazing. He he said, you know, she uh
[1:08:14] she did a lot for the gospel, for the
[1:08:16] kingdom. So, I just think, you know,
[1:08:18] when we hear things like that, it
[1:08:20] probably ought to behoove us as
[1:08:22] believers to not worry about getting too
[1:08:24] legalistic about things, just to simply
[1:08:27] have grace for people and to trust that
[1:08:29] it's God's economy. And he knows how he
[1:08:31] wants to spend his money. He knows where
[1:08:33] he wants it spent. He knows who is a
[1:08:35] silver dollar and he knows who is a half
[1:08:38] penny. That's right. It's his economy.
[1:08:40] It's not up to us to determine that. I
[1:08:43] think it's so wonderful to hear things
[1:08:45] like that, you know. But he goes on to
[1:08:47] talk about how really the main purpose
[1:08:49] for him to go to this cemetery was to
[1:08:51] look at the statue of Moses. And uh do
[1:08:55] you have that that picture, brother? Did
[1:08:57] it come in an email? I tried to send it
[1:08:59] this morning. I hope it went
[1:09:02] through. Yes, sir. If you could bring
[1:09:04] that up on the screen. You got it there.
[1:09:07] For the people that don't know, um, the
[1:09:10] story goes that
[1:09:12] Michelangelo, he was the great sculptor
[1:09:15] and and artist. He's renowned for his
[1:09:18] frescos that he did for the popes in in
[1:09:22] Rome. And uh, if you hear some of the
[1:09:24] stories, if you've ever gone to the
[1:09:26] Vatican and had a tour, they explain how
[1:09:29] that Michelangelo was actually
[1:09:31] conscripted. When the church and state
[1:09:34] were one, the pope was able to basically
[1:09:38] make Michelangelo prisoner and force him
[1:09:42] to actually express the gift that God
[1:09:44] put in his life. And if you see the
[1:09:46] paintings in in the cyine chapel, it is
[1:09:49] unreal. But he has many different
[1:09:51] sculptures, many different things that
[1:09:53] he did as an artist. And with this
[1:09:55] particular story, it's said that it's a
[1:09:57] legend. And I don't know if anybody
[1:09:59] really knows for sure. That's the
[1:10:01] official Wikipedia thing. I love to go
[1:10:03] with what the the prophet said. And the
[1:10:06] prophet declares that it's not just a a
[1:10:09] fable. He said that Michelangelo, he had
[1:10:12] a vision in his heart. He had an
[1:10:14] understanding somehow. Some sort of a
[1:10:17] revelation took place in his life and
[1:10:20] and he was given a a a chunk of marble,
[1:10:22] a chunk of stone. You can imagine a big
[1:10:25] rock. And somehow with a hammer and a
[1:10:28] chisel, he was able to take and express
[1:10:32] that image that was inside of him, in
[1:10:35] his heart, in his mind. I would even go
[1:10:38] so far as to say even in his soul.
[1:10:41] Because if you look at the details of
[1:10:43] this picture, I I I you might not be
[1:10:45] able to appreciate it here, but if you
[1:10:47] maybe look it up on your computer, you
[1:10:48] can zoom in to different parts of the
[1:10:50] statue and see it. Brother Ben Brandham
[1:10:52] talks about the hair and the eyes and
[1:10:55] and the features, the muscles, the the
[1:10:58] knee, the the clothing, everything in
[1:11:00] this in this sculpture. It came from a
[1:11:04] solid piece of rock that that this man
[1:11:06] chiseled out with a hammer and a chisel,
[1:11:09] chisel by chisel. He wasn't using
[1:11:12] electric impact guns and uh a 3D laser
[1:11:16] rendering model laid out on the stone
[1:11:19] and he had to just, you know, draw what
[1:11:21] do you call it? Paint by number. It was
[1:11:23] none of that chisel by number. This was
[1:11:26] just an expression from inside of his
[1:11:28] heart and that's why he is a master.
[1:11:32] That's why it's considered to be what
[1:11:34] would what would be a masterpiece
[1:11:36] according to the world. Amen. But I love
[1:11:39] how the prophet, he takes this story and
[1:11:41] he goes further with it. And I'm going
[1:11:43] to do just like I did in Saskatoon. I'm
[1:11:45] going to jump to the punchline because
[1:11:46] we're going to it's just the way I
[1:11:48] preach. He talks about how there came a
[1:11:51] time when he was chiseling this
[1:11:55] sculpture, chiseling this statue. There
[1:11:58] came a time where he recognized that's
[1:12:01] it. I see the exact image that I had in
[1:12:07] my heart.
[1:12:09] And it's right there before me. And it
[1:12:11] became so real to him. Brother Bradom
[1:12:15] says it was so so real, so amazing to
[1:12:21] him. It looked like he could talk. And
[1:12:24] and he said under inspiration, he didn't
[1:12:28] even think. He said he didn't think
[1:12:30] about it. Hallelujah. Because who would
[1:12:32] spend how long would it take by hand to
[1:12:35] take a big huge rock and chisel out
[1:12:37] chisel by chisel by chisel to get that
[1:12:39] kind of detail and to think about how
[1:12:41] you would maybe if anybody has ever
[1:12:43] tried to do anything with rock if you
[1:12:45] would have to polish it and how you
[1:12:47] would scrub it and how you would get the
[1:12:49] smoothness and all of that maybe a
[1:12:51] little bit of water and maybe another
[1:12:52] stone another type of stone
[1:12:54] understanding the hardness of stones.
[1:12:55] How would you be able to to do all of
[1:12:57] that? With all of that labor, it must
[1:12:59] have taken months, if not years, to do
[1:13:02] by hand. And there came a point where he
[1:13:05] saw the very image that he had in his
[1:13:08] heart. And it it it struck him so
[1:13:11] intensely, he didn't take a thought that
[1:13:13] inspiration took a hold of him. And what
[1:13:16] did he do? He said, "Speak." And he
[1:13:19] struck the statue. He struck it. And it
[1:13:22] caused a chip to come out of it. caused
[1:13:26] a flaw to happen in that knee. And
[1:13:28] that's what that red circle is. I don't
[1:13:29] know if it's really visible to see. I
[1:13:32] could probably do this. I don't do it
[1:13:33] often, so I'm going to take advantage of
[1:13:35] it. Right there, there's a little line
[1:13:37] that runs right down the center of his
[1:13:38] knee. And you know, it's it's an
[1:13:41] interesting thing because brother
[1:13:42] Brandham says to his way of thinking,
[1:13:45] that flaw is what causes this to be a
[1:13:49] masterpiece.
[1:13:51] Now, you can take and run with this as
[1:13:54] we go today. I hope that we can all be
[1:13:56] together with it. That flaw that we see
[1:13:59] in our lives is what God calls the
[1:14:03] masterpiece. Remember that he created
[1:14:05] each and every one of us in his very
[1:14:07] image. So my job today here, I believe,
[1:14:10] is to try and encourage us not to look
[1:14:12] at the flaws in our life and think, why
[1:14:14] do I got this flaw? I just have this
[1:14:16] problem and I just can't seem to get
[1:14:18] over it. That's the devil speaking. What
[1:14:21] I want to do is try and encourage us to
[1:14:23] say, you know what, God knew exactly how
[1:14:25] I was going to be. He knew exactly where
[1:14:27] I was coming from. He knew exactly the
[1:14:29] things that I would have to go through
[1:14:31] in my life. And he knows exactly what I
[1:14:33] consider this flaw to be. But through
[1:14:36] that flaw, he sees me as a masterpiece.
[1:14:40] And brothers and sisters, I guarantee
[1:14:42] you that's the way he sees you. Because
[1:14:44] he doesn't see us the way we are today.
[1:14:47] He doesn't see us born in sin, shaped in
[1:14:50] iniquity. come to the world speaking
[1:14:51] lies. The dispensational prophet said he
[1:14:53] only hears your voice. He sees us the
[1:14:56] way he created us before the foundation
[1:14:58] of the world.
[1:15:00] And I can't help but think sometimes we
[1:15:02] can get in our lives that everything can
[1:15:04] be just going smooth sailing. Everything
[1:15:07] is in order. We've got all of our
[1:15:09] investments over here are in perfect
[1:15:11] order and our family over here in
[1:15:13] perfect order and our church back here
[1:15:15] is in perfect order and everything in
[1:15:17] our life is in perfect order and we just
[1:15:19] worship and and we go to church and
[1:15:21] everything is fine. Just expect brothers
[1:15:24] and sisters when God starts to see his
[1:15:27] image in your life, he's going to strike
[1:15:29] the image and say, "There it
[1:15:32] is." And when it happens, it's not
[1:15:35] judgment because we're bad. It's because
[1:15:37] he's seeing his image.
[1:15:42] Remember, he's looking for one thing.
[1:15:44] He's looking for his character.
[1:15:47] He doesn't care whether we got a wart,
[1:15:50] even though he does. He does care about
[1:15:51] little things, but he's not interested
[1:15:52] in this flesh. This flesh has to perish.
[1:15:56] It's our soul that he wants. And he has.
[1:15:59] And he's already got a body waiting
[1:16:01] that's perfect for that soul. Remember,
[1:16:04] we bypassed our theophony bodies and we
[1:16:08] came to this world speaking lies, born
[1:16:10] in sin, shaped in iniquity. But you know
[1:16:13] what? What does this say here? This this
[1:16:15] word says that he actually looked after
[1:16:17] all of our iniquities, didn't he? And he
[1:16:19] looked after all of our sin, didn't he?
[1:16:21] And he looked after all of our healing,
[1:16:23] didn't he? He did all those things for
[1:16:26] us. He bore our iniquities.
[1:16:30] The chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:16:33] him. Amen. Thank you, Lord. And by his
[1:16:35] stripes, we're healed. Amen. I think
[1:16:37] it's beautiful. What a tremendous
[1:16:40] scripture that is. We know that there's
[1:16:43] always a prophecy and then there's a
[1:16:46] fulfillment. This was a prophecy from
[1:16:48] before the foundation of the world. We
[1:16:50] know that lamb was slain. This lamb that
[1:16:52] we read about here was slain before the
[1:16:54] foundation of the world. It says it in
[1:16:56] the scripture. But what we have here is
[1:16:58] when it was slain before the foundation
[1:17:00] of the world, there had to be an earthly
[1:17:03] manifestation of it.
[1:17:06] And through that earthly
[1:17:08] manifestation, there first had to be a
[1:17:10] prophetic utterance for that to happen
[1:17:13] because that's the way God does stuff.
[1:17:16] And and it's no different for us today
[1:17:18] as the bride of Jesus Christ. There was
[1:17:21] a prophetic utterance in our day. But
[1:17:23] here we have Isaiah the prophet talking
[1:17:26] about this lamb that was slain before
[1:17:28] the foundation of the world. And
[1:17:30] everybody probably read this and
[1:17:31] thought, "What is this? This is strange.
[1:17:33] This is odd. Who hath borne our repo
[1:17:36] reproach? Who who who hath taken stripes
[1:17:38] for our healing?" The people in his day,
[1:17:41] the scholars in his day, they didn't
[1:17:43] understand that. But that was prophecy.
[1:17:45] And it had to first be prophesied. It
[1:17:48] comes first to the prophets according to
[1:17:50] Amos 3:7. Surely God will do nothing
[1:17:54] except he first reveals his secret
[1:17:57] through the prophets. Why would he be
[1:17:59] any different today, brothers and
[1:18:00] sisters? There's some sort of modern
[1:18:04] ideological thinking that would say
[1:18:06] there's no room for prophetic utterance
[1:18:09] today. But when it's according to the
[1:18:11] scripture, it has to be. Amen.
[1:18:15] Amen. We mustn't get too far down that
[1:18:18] road. I apologize.
[1:18:23] We all believe God sent a prophet, I'm
[1:18:25] sure. And if you don't, just read
[1:18:27] Malachi. Just read the book of Malachi,
[1:18:30] especially at the end. There's a part in
[1:18:32] there about a prophet. And you know, if
[1:18:34] he didn't come, then when is he coming?
[1:18:36] And what will he look like when he does
[1:18:37] come? I think it's a real interesting
[1:18:40] discussion. But you know, brother
[1:18:42] Brandham, he went to see this Moses
[1:18:44] statue because he was intrigued with the
[1:18:47] understanding that this man,
[1:18:49] Michelangelo, had an inspiration in his
[1:18:51] heart. And brother Brandham talks about
[1:18:53] the inspiration and how Michelangelo was
[1:18:55] able to just express through the
[1:18:57] inspiration. And like I said, like I
[1:18:59] mentioned, if you ever get the
[1:19:00] opportunity to go to Rome and and see,
[1:19:03] and if you've been there and seen it,
[1:19:04] you understand what I'm talking about.
[1:19:05] The inspiration is astounding to think
[1:19:08] that people could just do this just just
[1:19:10] carve and paint and and do all this
[1:19:12] stuff. And you know, it was interesting
[1:19:16] how
[1:19:17] Moses, Brother Brandham, he says, nobody
[1:19:20] ever saw Moses in the day that
[1:19:22] Michelangelo was alive. Nobody
[1:19:24] understood what Moses looked like. But
[1:19:27] yet, this man, Michelangelo, had an
[1:19:29] inspiration. And when he finally
[1:19:31] recognized the image in the statue was
[1:19:34] what his desire was, he got that
[1:19:36] inspiration and he struck the statue and
[1:19:39] yelled,
[1:19:40] "Speak." Um, I just think it's it's
[1:19:43] thrilling to look at that and and to
[1:19:46] recognize
[1:19:47] that that image was the very
[1:19:50] manifestation of what was in his heart.
[1:19:54] And every single one of us created in
[1:19:57] God's very image is truly a
[1:19:59] manifestation of what God had in his
[1:20:02] heart. And and maybe not had in his
[1:20:05] heart, maybe before the foundation of
[1:20:07] the world, but has present tense in his
[1:20:11] heart about our lives. But nobody
[1:20:14] understood what Moses looked like in the
[1:20:17] day that that image was created. And I
[1:20:19] can't help but think, you know, none of
[1:20:21] us, you know, brother Brandham, he says
[1:20:23] it, none of us know the real you and the
[1:20:26] real me. I I can't see the real you. And
[1:20:29] you can't see the real me. You see this
[1:20:32] pest house, this body with a flaw in it.
[1:20:35] And maybe you would say, "I don't need
[1:20:37] to to see your body, Brother Barry. I
[1:20:40] can just hear your voice." And I can see
[1:20:42] the flaw just by hearing your voice. And
[1:20:45] I'm real sorry about that. But that's
[1:20:47] the way our lives are. We're created the
[1:20:51] way that God created us so that we could
[1:20:53] be the expression of what was in his
[1:20:55] mind before there was even a speck of
[1:20:57] stardust in this universe. Amen.
[1:21:02] The flaw is in the imperfection.
[1:21:04] Brothers and sisters, we have the maybe
[1:21:07] the chiseled bodies and everything in
[1:21:09] our life just right, but every one of us
[1:21:12] has a flaw. Yes, every single one of us
[1:21:15] has a flaw. Some of us have flaws that
[1:21:18] are just like a a semi-tra following us
[1:21:22] down the road and everyone can see it
[1:21:23] and say, "Look at those flaws. Oh my
[1:21:25] goodness, that guy or that girl, that
[1:21:28] sister, that brother, you know, and
[1:21:29] other ones, they've got silent flaws,
[1:21:31] right? Where everything is under the
[1:21:34] surface and everything looks perfect in
[1:21:36] their life and you can't see it. They
[1:21:38] suffer in silence."
[1:21:41] Every one of us has a flaw, though. To
[1:21:44] think we don't have a flaw, that's the
[1:21:46] flaw.
[1:21:49] Right. It's pride.
[1:21:53] That's pride. The flaw is in the
[1:21:56] imperfection in our lives. And you know,
[1:21:58] brothers and sisters, I think it's so
[1:22:00] important to just just do this. So, I'm
[1:22:02] going to just hover here for a little
[1:22:04] bit, and I hope it's okay. Don't get
[1:22:05] nervous, but I want to say it this way.
[1:22:07] Sometimes the flaw is manifested in
[1:22:11] music.
[1:22:14] Sometimes we have everything thought out
[1:22:16] exactly the way we want it to be and
[1:22:19] somebody messes up on an instrument. or
[1:22:22] in a choir. Maybe the choir was supposed
[1:22:25] to sing today and somehow the
[1:22:26] communication didn't happen and somebody
[1:22:29] didn't know about it and everybody just
[1:22:31] scrambles and it's this thing where we
[1:22:33] just don't know what's going on and
[1:22:35] everybody's confused but we just roll
[1:22:37] with it and then they sing. What happens
[1:22:40] through that flaw, the seeming flaw, we
[1:22:43] have a tremendous choir song that just
[1:22:46] gives glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] Amen. Sometimes somebody misses a beat.
[1:22:53] Somebody misses a key. Sometimes the
[1:22:56] song leader's a little too fast, a
[1:22:58] little too slow. Sometimes there's
[1:23:00] something that's just seemingly off and
[1:23:03] we might call it a flaw. I want to say
[1:23:05] it's the masterpiece.
[1:23:07] It's what God is doing in our midst. We
[1:23:10] cannot be too fussed about having
[1:23:13] everything perfect. If we do that, we're
[1:23:15] going to get in the way of the spirit of
[1:23:17] the Lord.
[1:23:20] And you know, I'm saying sometimes it's
[1:23:22] in the music. And I'll say it this way.
[1:23:24] Most times it's in the preaching. Yes,
[1:23:26] sir.
[1:23:28] I'm not afraid to say it. We try and
[1:23:30] find the mind of the Lord and we put
[1:23:32] together notes and we study, we listen,
[1:23:34] we do all this stuff. And you come to
[1:23:36] the pulpit and sometimes you're just so
[1:23:38] nervous you don't even know what to say.
[1:23:40] You've got it all in front of you.
[1:23:42] Right? Many times you go out get a
[1:23:44] little bit of inspiration and you start
[1:23:46] to talk and you say things and
[1:23:47] afterwards you're like, "Why did I say
[1:23:49] that? Why didn't I say the other thing?
[1:23:51] I had it written right there. Why? It's
[1:23:54] the Lord. What we consider to be the
[1:23:57] flaw is the masterpiece."
[1:24:00] You know, brothers and sisters, I just
[1:24:02] want to really dwell on this for a
[1:24:04] little bit. Sometimes it's in our
[1:24:06] marriage. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:24:09] marriage. She talks about the
[1:24:10] masterpiece family in this message and
[1:24:13] he says it over and over again and how
[1:24:16] the husband and the wife, they need to
[1:24:18] become one. They need to be in accord,
[1:24:21] one accord. And if they're not in one
[1:24:23] accord, there's something wrong with
[1:24:26] that marriage. And I can guarantee you
[1:24:28] all it is is that the husband needs to
[1:24:32] submit himself unto the Lord
[1:24:36] all the way. Amen.
[1:24:39] and allow God to move on the scene.
[1:24:43] I just so appreciated what brother
[1:24:45] Emanuel said and I wonder if if
[1:24:47] everybody caught it. I'm going to try
[1:24:48] and say it my own way. Last Sunday he
[1:24:51] said it. Sisters, pray for your
[1:24:54] husbands. Amen. Sisters, pray for your
[1:24:57] fathers.
[1:24:58] Daughters, pray for your fathers. Pray
[1:25:01] for them. Because when they succeed, you
[1:25:04] succeed. When they fail, you fail. Amen.
[1:25:09] But when we have problems in our life,
[1:25:11] let's not dwell on the problems. Let's
[1:25:13] not look at our husband and say, "He's
[1:25:15] got this temper. He's got this thing.
[1:25:17] He's always doing that. He's always
[1:25:18] doing the other. I just wish. I just
[1:25:20] wish." What about saying that's who he
[1:25:22] is?
[1:25:24] You know, I I know someone in my life,
[1:25:27] they've spent their entire life desiring
[1:25:30] that every single person they have a
[1:25:32] close relationship with them, be it a
[1:25:34] spouse or a family member or even a
[1:25:37] close friend, every single person they
[1:25:40] meet, they desire that they would be
[1:25:43] different, that they would just be a
[1:25:46] little bit different. If they would just
[1:25:47] say things a little bit differently, if
[1:25:49] they would just walk a little
[1:25:50] differently, if they would dress a
[1:25:51] little differently. they would just do
[1:25:52] this thing just a little bit
[1:25:53] differently, then maybe they would be
[1:25:55] better. What about just saying they are
[1:25:57] who they are and I accept them for who
[1:26:00] they are.
[1:26:02] God accepts us for who we are.
[1:26:06] If if husbands and wives could just do
[1:26:08] that, I believe it would go a long ways
[1:26:11] for becoming one,
[1:26:14] for being in unity.
[1:26:16] But you know the flaw? It's in the
[1:26:18] marriage. The
[1:26:20] perfection is in the flaw. Amen.
[1:26:23] Hallelujah. And that's the masterpiece.
[1:26:27] Because how on how in the world how is
[1:26:30] it even possible that a husband and a
[1:26:33] wife can get married in the day in which
[1:26:35] we live and stay together.
[1:26:38] The world we're set up in is designed
[1:26:40] for divorce. You don't have to look very
[1:26:42] far. You just have to drive down the
[1:26:43] highway and you can see the sign that
[1:26:45] says divorce ease. You don't even have
[1:26:47] to spend very much money. They're
[1:26:48] looking for discount divorces.
[1:26:51] And they're getting it.
[1:26:55] You know, I I'll say this as a tribute
[1:26:57] to our late brother Pete. When I first
[1:27:00] started coming around, and I hope it's
[1:27:02] okay. I I hope it's okay. I don't want
[1:27:05] to upset anybody, but I'll just I can
[1:27:07] only be
[1:27:09] honest. I got to go to a 50th wedding
[1:27:12] anniversary when I first was in the
[1:27:15] family. I got married and was around for
[1:27:17] a little while in the church and I
[1:27:19] actually struggled with the idea that
[1:27:22] people could be together in this day and
[1:27:24] age for 50 years in a marriage. And I
[1:27:27] thought I was telling my wife this
[1:27:29] recently and she was kind of shocked.
[1:27:31] But I I I said I just I think
[1:27:33] something's funny there. Something's
[1:27:36] Are we getting the whole story here?
[1:27:40] How could that be? How could someone be
[1:27:41] together for 50 years? I've never heard
[1:27:43] of it.
[1:27:45] God. Not until I came around the
[1:27:47] message.
[1:27:49] I I I think it's amazing. Amen. I think
[1:27:51] we were talking to uh brother Menow. Did
[1:27:54] he say 62
[1:27:56] years? Again, I was like,
[1:28:00] "What?" This was just last week. I
[1:28:02] believe it though. And I believe it with
[1:28:05] brother Pete and sister Anne. What a
[1:28:07] tremendous thing it is. When you put God
[1:28:09] in the marriage,
[1:28:11] there ain't no room for the devil.
[1:28:14] When you put the word of God first in
[1:28:17] your marriage, God will bless it.
[1:28:20] But when we have that thing where we
[1:28:22] say, "No, I'm perfect." No, no, no. Just
[1:28:25] submit. When we start down that
[1:28:28] road, we're not submitting to God.
[1:28:32] But when we go on our knees as a
[1:28:33] husband, as a leader, and we submit
[1:28:35] ourselves, we don't even need to show
[1:28:36] our wives that we're doing that. And I
[1:28:38] would challenge any brother who has a
[1:28:40] problem in your marriage today. I
[1:28:43] challenge you. Go into a secret prayer
[1:28:46] closet. Go to a place where nobody knows
[1:28:49] and test God.
[1:28:52] See if he won't come on the scene and
[1:28:54] honor your prayer to submit yourself
[1:28:57] before him
[1:28:59] for your marriage, for your children.
[1:29:03] See if he won't do it.
[1:29:05] It's one thing if you do it and you say,
[1:29:07] "Come on, honey. Let's pray." And you go
[1:29:08] and you do it together and it's good.
[1:29:10] You have to do that as husband and wife.
[1:29:13] That's that's not something I would say
[1:29:14] don't do. But I'm saying husbands, if
[1:29:16] you've got an issue and you just can't
[1:29:18] seem to get over it, you can't get
[1:29:19] around it. You can't get through it. You
[1:29:20] don't know what's going on, just just
[1:29:22] submit yourself unto God. Fast for a
[1:29:25] little while. Pray for a little while.
[1:29:27] See if he won't come on the scene. And
[1:29:28] you know what? You'll be able to look
[1:29:30] back in your marriage and say, "Oh my,
[1:29:32] look at that tremendous flaw that I did.
[1:29:34] I did."
[1:29:37] Amen. And what happens is it becomes a
[1:29:39] masterpiece.
[1:29:41] And I'm not saying we're perfect by any
[1:29:43] means. What I am saying is I've
[1:29:45] experienced it in my life. What I've
[1:29:47] been talking about where I'm right and
[1:29:49] she's wrong and everything else is wrong
[1:29:52] and I'm right and I'm right. As long as
[1:29:54] you're right, you're right.
[1:29:58] Right. God's just going to say, you
[1:30:00] know, you're not taking me at my word.
[1:30:01] If you would just take me at my word,
[1:30:03] that's my will. If you would just follow
[1:30:05] the word of God, follow my word, you
[1:30:07] would see a supernatural blessing that
[1:30:09] would happen in your life. Many times
[1:30:11] we're very interested in making sure
[1:30:13] that we've got the tithe topped up and
[1:30:15] the offerings happening just so that God
[1:30:17] could open the windows of heaven and
[1:30:19] pour out a blessing. Don't think for a
[1:30:21] second that marriage isn't a part of
[1:30:24] that. But if we are willing to actually
[1:30:26] give them the opportunity, our marriage
[1:30:28] can become a masterpiece. And that
[1:30:31] masterpiece is going to have a flaw
[1:30:34] somewhere along the way. I've heard
[1:30:36] people say, "We've never had a fight.
[1:30:38] We've never had a disagreement. We've
[1:30:39] never had these things." And that's
[1:30:41] entirely true. I I I've come to the
[1:30:43] place where I say, you know, I I believe
[1:30:45] it. Okay? But I know we're not perfect
[1:30:48] and I know there's always trouble in one
[1:30:51] way or another.
[1:30:54] You know, talking about the masterpiece,
[1:30:57] it can be in our parenting.
[1:31:01] It can be in our parenting. And I'm not
[1:31:03] saying that, you know, we spare the rod,
[1:31:06] we spoil the child, and we're going to
[1:31:08] see our image so strongly in the child,
[1:31:10] we're going to smite them and say,
[1:31:11] "Speak." That's not what I'm saying at
[1:31:13] all. What I am saying is that we can
[1:31:16] actually decide to not use the rod
[1:31:19] because the word of God says that we
[1:31:21] ought to. That's the word of God.
[1:31:24] And when we don't do it, what happens is
[1:31:27] we actually have a bit of a flaw. And
[1:31:31] you know, sometimes we can actually be a
[1:31:33] little too strong with that rod and we
[1:31:36] can have a little bit of a flaw, right?
[1:31:39] But you know what? God can come on the
[1:31:41] scene both ways. Amen. He can come on
[1:31:44] the scene both ways and
[1:31:46] manifest the parenting flaw into a
[1:31:50] masterpiece
[1:31:52] if we're willing to put him first. Amen.
[1:31:55] It can happen in our walk as believers,
[1:31:58] brothers and sisters. We get out of
[1:32:00] step, we fall down, we make a mess, we
[1:32:03] have a problem. You know, are we willing
[1:32:06] to take correction when it comes our
[1:32:07] way? If we're not willing to take
[1:32:09] correction when it comes our way, then
[1:32:11] we are not a masterpiece. And every
[1:32:13] single son and daughter of God will be
[1:32:16] chastised according to the word of God.
[1:32:18] We know that whom he loves, he rebukes
[1:32:21] and he chasens. And that doesn't mean we
[1:32:24] It's so good. Isn't the the church age
[1:32:26] book such a wonderful study. It doesn't
[1:32:28] mean that he grabs a rod and and smites
[1:32:30] you. It doesn't mean he grabs a hammer
[1:32:31] because he sees your image and he smites
[1:32:33] you. Rebuking and chastening is simply
[1:32:36] correcting.
[1:32:38] Correcting and showing the right way.
[1:32:40] Giving the right leadership. showing
[1:32:42] that, you know, you don't want to ride
[1:32:44] your tricycle down the driveway. Even
[1:32:46] though you can get lots of speed, you're
[1:32:47] not going to be able to stop when you
[1:32:48] get to the bottom. So, I'm just going to
[1:32:50] help turn you and steer you and you can
[1:32:52] ride down the sidewalk and not go onto
[1:32:54] the street. Sometimes we need a little
[1:32:56] direction, a little correction in our
[1:32:58] lives. It can be in our our parenting.
[1:33:00] It can be in our walk as individuals, as
[1:33:04] believers. I was thinking about this and
[1:33:06] I hope, excuse me, I hope it's okay.
[1:33:08] Hey, does anybody here know who Bob Ross
[1:33:10] is? He had a famous saying, happy little
[1:33:13] mistakes. He'd be painting
[1:33:17] masterpieces and he would make a flaw
[1:33:20] and what he would do was just get a
[1:33:22] little more paint and mix it up and and
[1:33:23] he would just go and fix it and just
[1:33:25] say, you know, it's just a little happy
[1:33:26] happy little mistake and it would
[1:33:28] suddenly go from being maybe a mountain
[1:33:30] scene to being maybe just a little bit
[1:33:32] of a tree instead of a mountain or maybe
[1:33:34] a mountain instead of a tree, maybe a
[1:33:36] little bit of water, whatever it was, he
[1:33:38] was able to just manipulate it. And and
[1:33:40] don't think that God can't do that in
[1:33:42] our lives. If we're willing to put him
[1:33:45] first, he will take his permissive will,
[1:33:47] which will be that little mistake, and
[1:33:49] turn it into his very perfect will,
[1:33:51] which will turn into a masterpiece.
[1:33:58] In the life which we live in, there's
[1:34:00] many times we hear about mistakes, and I
[1:34:02] just quoted it, happy little mistakes.
[1:34:04] But we know there's no mistakes. Amen.
[1:34:06] Not for sons and daughters of God. Lord,
[1:34:09] we do error in our way, and he will
[1:34:11] always correct us. Amen. And whoever's
[1:34:14] on the inside will come out when that
[1:34:16] correction comes. When that correction
[1:34:18] comes our way, we will either have the
[1:34:21] nature of Abel or we'll have the nature
[1:34:24] of Cain. One of those two natures will
[1:34:26] be inside of us. And and Lord willing,
[1:34:29] we will all have the nature of Abel in
[1:34:32] our lives. We will not be like Cain
[1:34:35] where we will say, "I'm just going to
[1:34:37] shrug my shoulder and say, "I've heard
[1:34:39] it all before, preacher. Ain't nothing
[1:34:41] you're ever going to tell me." Well,
[1:34:43] who's
[1:34:45] talking? I'll say that when you hear a
[1:34:48] brother at the pulpit, who's talking?
[1:34:50] Because whoever you want to be talking
[1:34:52] is who will be talking.
[1:34:56] I just think it's wonderful. The
[1:34:58] prophet, he says it, you know, there's
[1:34:59] the the man that was in a meeting and he
[1:35:01] says, you know, all I after the meeting,
[1:35:04] alls I heard fellowshipping in the in
[1:35:06] the parking lot after service, all I
[1:35:08] heard him say was calling me a crow,
[1:35:09] calling me a buzzard. never said
[1:35:11] anything good about me. And the other
[1:35:13] person just standing there says, "You
[1:35:15] know what? I never heard that at all.
[1:35:17] What were you listening to? All I heard
[1:35:19] him say was that you're an eagle. And
[1:35:21] where the carcass is, there will the
[1:35:22] eagles be gathered
[1:35:26] out of the
[1:35:27] masterpiece." Brother talks about the
[1:35:30] same
[1:35:31] material. He says, "Let us not forget
[1:35:34] that in the beginning when he smoked the
[1:35:36] side of Adam, he took something from his
[1:35:38] side.
[1:35:40] Now the smiting of Christ was for a
[1:35:43] cause that he might take from him
[1:35:47] one to be a family, the
[1:35:51] bride. I just love this because brother
[1:35:53] Bradam talks about the masterpiece
[1:35:56] family. That's what God's desire was.
[1:35:59] Was to actually have a family. So that
[1:36:02] he could be a
[1:36:04] father so that he could be a husband. So
[1:36:07] that he could have children and so that
[1:36:09] he could actually have a wife so that he
[1:36:12] could have a relationship and express
[1:36:14] his
[1:36:16] attributes. He might take him a bride.
[1:36:19] So when his masterpiece was
[1:36:22] perfected, then he had to smite it or
[1:36:26] take from
[1:36:27] him not another
[1:36:30] piece, not another
[1:36:32] piece, not another
[1:36:35] creation, but of the same creation.
[1:36:40] So brothers and sisters, what I want to
[1:36:42] say here, and I'm just going to take my
[1:36:44] time and and go. We got lots of time
[1:36:46] here. I'm so glad for that. Is that
[1:36:48] clocked right? I think it is. We got
[1:36:51] lots of time. It's funny though because
[1:36:53] when it gets to about 20 after then it's
[1:36:55] like a time warp. Then it's like 5 to
[1:36:57] 12. And I don't know how that happens.
[1:36:58] But it's just the Lord. But talking
[1:37:01] about this here, it's not another piece
[1:37:03] and it's not another creation.
[1:37:06] Remember, we're not talking about this
[1:37:08] flesh. We're talking about our soul.
[1:37:10] Amen. And that soul comes from God.
[1:37:13] Amen. And he has made that soul to be a
[1:37:16] literal manifestation of his life, of
[1:37:20] his attributes. So when we look at
[1:37:23] ourselves, don't look at the
[1:37:26] flaw. Realize that he looks through the
[1:37:29] flaw and sees the masterpiece. He
[1:37:31] realizes this flesh being our flaw.
[1:37:36] Causes the masterpiece to shine in
[1:37:38] heaven. We don't have to worry about
[1:37:41] saving this flesh. Don't think about
[1:37:42] saving this flesh. This flesh is going
[1:37:44] to perish in this life in which we live.
[1:37:46] What's our desire? Brother menofen
[1:37:49] taught me this years ago. What's our
[1:37:51] desire, brothers and sisters? Is our
[1:37:53] desire to serve God? Then we have not
[1:37:56] fallen. Sometimes we can say, I I've
[1:37:58] done this and I've done that and I don't
[1:38:00] think I I could ever come back. I don't
[1:38:02] see how I could ever serve God with what
[1:38:04] I've done or thought or been or said,
[1:38:06] whatever it is that's gone on in my
[1:38:07] life. If we have the desire to serve
[1:38:09] God, you have not fallen from grace.
[1:38:14] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. If you desire to
[1:38:18] serve God, you need to remember. We need
[1:38:20] to remember. I need to remember that I
[1:38:23] am not another piece of material and I
[1:38:26] am not another creation. I am a literal
[1:38:29] part of the Lord Jesus Christ. If he is
[1:38:32] the head and we are the body,
[1:38:34] hallelujah. Where do we stand brothers
[1:38:36] and sisters?
[1:38:38] Devil's going to come around and say,
[1:38:39] "Well, look at your
[1:38:41] flaw. Look at your
[1:38:43] imperfection. How could you be the
[1:38:45] masterpiece?" You are. But remember, we
[1:38:48] can't even see it ourselves because it's
[1:38:50] our soul. How many people here can see
[1:38:52] your soul? Where's your soul? Amen. Can
[1:38:54] you show me your soul? Sometimes we'll
[1:38:55] say, "I just bear my soul." How do you
[1:38:57] do
[1:38:58] that? You speak the word. Amen. You
[1:39:02] actually speak words and you express
[1:39:04] what's in your soul.
[1:39:06] We have to remember we can't see our
[1:39:08] soul. So don't base our salvation on
[1:39:11] what we see with our eyes. And
[1:39:13] especially don't base other people's
[1:39:14] salvation with what you see on their
[1:39:16] eyes. Don't do that. Don't do it. Amen.
[1:39:19] Just remember that we're not talking
[1:39:21] about another creation. Brother
[1:39:22] Brandham, he says it here. The Holy
[1:39:24] Ghost through Brother Brandom, he says
[1:39:26] it here. He had to take it and smite it
[1:39:28] to take from him. Not another piece, not
[1:39:31] another creation of the same creation.
[1:39:33] And I know some might be saying, "Well,
[1:39:34] Brother Barry, he's talking about Adam
[1:39:36] and how he made a deep sleep to fall
[1:39:37] upon him and he reached in and pulled a
[1:39:40] rib and and and made the incision. It
[1:39:42] was a perfect surgery and there was no
[1:39:44] wound. There was no scar. There was no
[1:39:46] issue. There was just this woman." And
[1:39:48] and you know, perhaps all of that is
[1:39:50] 100% correct. But what we need to
[1:39:53] remember is that if it's good for Adam
[1:39:56] to actually have that happen, he is the
[1:39:59] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:40:02] Think about our souls and the value of
[1:40:04] our soul. It's worth 10,000 worlds is
[1:40:06] what we've heard said so many times in
[1:40:08] the word. It's not another piece, not
[1:40:11] another creation. It's the same creation
[1:40:13] of God. That same one that was in the
[1:40:16] Garden of Eden in a theophony B. I know
[1:40:19] that might get some people upset. They
[1:40:20] want to debate the whole theophony body
[1:40:22] whether it was in the Garden of Eden or
[1:40:24] not. I'm not interested in that. Adam
[1:40:27] was made to live a thousand years. Amen.
[1:40:30] Adam was made to be God of this earth.
[1:40:33] How could you be God of this earth and
[1:40:35] not be an eternal being?
[1:40:38] I don't know. I don't know. But Adam was
[1:40:41] a son of God. He didn't come into the
[1:40:43] world through sin. He wasn't born in sin
[1:40:45] shaped in iniquity. Come into the world
[1:40:47] speaking lies. He was directly a son of
[1:40:49] God. He never had a naval. Amen.
[1:40:52] If he was the same creation, then we are
[1:40:55] today.
[1:40:57] The devil's going to say, "No, we're
[1:40:58] not." When you hear that, tell him it's
[1:41:01] the devil. Rebuke him and tell him to
[1:41:04] get on his way. Amen. Don't be afraid of
[1:41:07] this, brothers and sisters, to just
[1:41:09] simply say the word. This is exactly the
[1:41:12] way God wanted it or we would not have
[1:41:14] had a dispensational vindicated prophet
[1:41:16] come and say these words to this
[1:41:19] age. The masterpiece was perfected. His
[1:41:22] masterpiece was perfected. Then he had
[1:41:24] to smite it to take from him not another
[1:41:27] piece, not another creation, but of the
[1:41:29] same creation. He says, "My brother,
[1:41:30] don't think bad at this, but think a
[1:41:33] minute. If he had took from him the
[1:41:34] original creation to make the bride for
[1:41:37] him, he never made another creation. He
[1:41:39] took a part of the original creation,
[1:41:42] then if he was the word, what must the
[1:41:44] bride be?
[1:41:47] It's got to be the original word. living
[1:41:50] God in the word, not in this flesh.
[1:41:54] Don't think about this flesh. Think
[1:41:56] about what's inside of us that causes
[1:41:59] the words to come out.
[1:42:02] Because when we're busy looking at this
[1:42:04] flesh, we're just like a Pharisee. And
[1:42:05] we'll say, "Well, look at the disciples.
[1:42:07] They eat with unwashing hands and they
[1:42:08] eat unclean things. They do all these
[1:42:10] things that are just not appropriate
[1:42:12] according to the law." We're we're we're
[1:42:14] not living under the law. We're living
[1:42:16] under grace today. That's the new
[1:42:18] covenant. That's the New Testament.
[1:42:20] That's where we're at today, brothers
[1:42:21] and sisters. And and you know what?
[1:42:23] We're not talking about what goes inside
[1:42:26] of us, inside of our mouth. Even though
[1:42:29] some carbs can be really bad and help
[1:42:31] you gain weight and make you not that
[1:42:34] performancebased, but you know,
[1:42:35] sometimes the things that we eat are
[1:42:37] bad, but they're not going to change our
[1:42:40] eternal salvation. It's what comes out
[1:42:43] of our mouths. out of our mouth. We
[1:42:47] speak the abundance of our heart.
[1:42:51] You know, you don't have to talk very
[1:42:52] long with people and you can pretty much
[1:42:54] hear what's going on their life. Get
[1:42:57] together with people and the first thing
[1:42:58] they want to do is talk about sport.
[1:43:00] Other people want to talk about
[1:43:02] investments. Other people want to talk
[1:43:03] about the word. Where are we at? What's
[1:43:07] important to us? You know, Revelation 13
[1:43:10] is unfolding right now. right now while
[1:43:14] we're here. Revelation 13 is unfolding
[1:43:17] and it's been unfolding for years, but
[1:43:19] it's actually really starting to unravel
[1:43:21] now. My my brother, don't think bad at
[1:43:24] this, but think a minute. If he took
[1:43:26] from him the original creation to make
[1:43:29] the bride for him, he never made another
[1:43:33] creation. He took a part of the original
[1:43:35] creation. Then if he was the word, what
[1:43:39] must the bride be?
[1:43:42] She is going to be a virgin to his word
[1:43:45] is what brother Brandham said. And and
[1:43:47] that means she's just not going to be
[1:43:48] interested in making excuses for it. I
[1:43:50] might not be a able to explain it. I
[1:43:52] might not be able to even understand it,
[1:43:54] but I don't need to. I just need to
[1:43:57] believe it. I just need to believe it.
[1:43:59] And if I can believe it, all things are
[1:44:02] possible. Amen. Hallelujah. If we can
[1:44:05] believe it, brothers and sisters, that
[1:44:07] is literally God in us. Amen.
[1:44:11] Hallelujah. Because unbelievers can't
[1:44:13] believe, right? The devil can do
[1:44:17] anything except for believe.
[1:44:21] The devil believes that he's going to
[1:44:22] win. He believes it. He believes that
[1:44:26] he's going to win at the battle of
[1:44:28] Armageddon. He believes that he's going
[1:44:30] to gather together all of the the people
[1:44:32] that are left on the earth and they're
[1:44:34] going to blaspheme all of the saints
[1:44:36] that are on the earth and they're going
[1:44:38] to blaspheme all of the saints that are
[1:44:39] in heaven. and they're going to
[1:44:41] blaspheme the God of heaven. A and he's
[1:44:43] going to think, he still thinks that he
[1:44:45] can actually go and win that war. He
[1:44:48] thinks that none of us are sons and
[1:44:50] daughters of God. He thought that Jesus
[1:44:53] Christ was not the atonement for all of
[1:44:56] our sins. That's why he allowed them to
[1:44:59] put Jesus on the cross. If he would have
[1:45:01] known what was going on, he never would
[1:45:03] have done that. But that was his death
[1:45:05] stroke is what brother Brandham said.
[1:45:07] That was the death stroke. That's where
[1:45:10] Paul could under
[1:45:11] inspiration strike that statue and say,
[1:45:15] "Death, where is thy sting? And grave,
[1:45:17] where is thy victory? You have no power
[1:45:21] over me because you never had me from
[1:45:23] the beginning." In
[1:45:26] 1964, it's only by the word. Brother
[1:45:29] Bam, he says, "As it taken him 4,000
[1:45:32] years to make his this masterpiece, now
[1:45:36] he's been for nearly 2,000 years making
[1:45:39] another masterpiece."
[1:45:42] A bride for Christ.
[1:45:45] Can you imagine that? How long did
[1:45:47] Michelangelo chisel at that statue?
[1:45:50] Think about how perfect that statue is.
[1:45:52] maybe go and zoom up on it and and take
[1:45:54] a look and just see some of the features
[1:45:57] on it and how it must have inspired him
[1:46:00] so much for him to take and smite it
[1:46:03] with a hammer. This thing that he had
[1:46:06] worked on for so long and so hard, all
[1:46:09] the criticism that he must have endured
[1:46:10] to do it. Think about how perfect that
[1:46:14] statue was and how perfect the statue
[1:46:17] is. the masterpiece that God is working
[1:46:20] on right now, that bride for Jesus
[1:46:23] Christ. And isn't it beautiful? It's not
[1:46:24] brides.
[1:46:28] It's one bride.
[1:46:30] That's going to be in one mind and one
[1:46:32] accord, one spirit. Hallelujah. Not a
[1:46:35] bunch of different camps, not a bunch of
[1:46:36] different theories, not a bunch of
[1:46:38] different divisions, one bride. I think
[1:46:41] that's just a a a masterpiece to itself.
[1:46:44] Amen. It's taken him 4,000 years to make
[1:46:47] this masterpiece. Now he's been for
[1:46:49] nearly 2,000 years making another
[1:46:51] masterpiece. A bride for Christ. Another
[1:46:54] masterpiece. In doing
[1:46:57] it, he has done it by his neverchanging
[1:47:01] method. The same way he made the
[1:47:04] masterpiece, the masterpiece by his
[1:47:08] word. Amen. Isn't that beautiful? Thank
[1:47:11] you. That's what we have been studying
[1:47:12] in the church age book all along. That's
[1:47:15] what we've been studying in the message
[1:47:16] all along. That's what brother Ken
[1:47:18] taught all along. That's what he
[1:47:20] preached his heart all along. It's all
[1:47:23] about the word. His word is his will.
[1:47:25] His will is his word. If we're willing
[1:47:27] to take his word and put it first in our
[1:47:29] lives, it will show. Amen. It shows.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. We can't take this word and
[1:47:36] hide it under a bushel.
[1:47:38] We can't take his word and hide it in
[1:47:40] our hearts and live in this world and
[1:47:43] let other people run all over us. When
[1:47:46] the sinners come around and try and get
[1:47:48] us to go and do sinful things, suddenly
[1:47:51] that word's going to shine. We're going
[1:47:53] to say, "Uh-uh. No way. I ain't doing
[1:47:56] that." Well, why don't you do that?
[1:47:58] Well, because I believe the word of God,
[1:48:00] and the word of God says not to do that.
[1:48:05] Thank you. It's the masterpiece.
[1:48:08] I just love how it's one bride. He's
[1:48:10] going to take one bride, brothers and
[1:48:12] sisters. And how is he going to take one
[1:48:13] bride? Isn't it interesting that it's
[1:48:15] one word different? Now, this is fresh
[1:48:19] for anybody that knows what that means.
[1:48:21] It's no different than what's going on
[1:48:23] today. Change that B with a P and what
[1:48:26] do you
[1:48:27] get? Pride.
[1:48:30] And there's a different type of pride
[1:48:31] going on in the world, but that was the
[1:48:33] original sin, ain't it? The original sin
[1:48:36] was Lucifer. Oh, the the son of the
[1:48:39] morning star. He he he thought that he
[1:48:41] would be the one that would just project
[1:48:43] himself to sit on the throne to be over
[1:48:46] top of everyone. But he knew full well
[1:48:48] the only thing he could say is to be
[1:48:50] like the most high. He couldn't be the
[1:48:53] most high. There's no way that could
[1:48:54] happen.
[1:48:56] But all it is is one word, one letter
[1:48:58] difference, isn't it? The whole world is
[1:49:01] looking at pride in in every single way.
[1:49:04] All of the different avenues that you
[1:49:07] could possibly have pride and meanings
[1:49:10] is in this world all around us. But I
[1:49:12] want to say this, the bride, she ain't
[1:49:15] got no pride.
[1:49:17] The bride is the most humble person
[1:49:20] you'll ever meet.
[1:49:22] The bride is the most submissive person
[1:49:24] you'll ever meet. The bride is the one
[1:49:27] that's going to say, "No, no, no. You go
[1:49:29] ahead." That's where you get the the
[1:49:30] weird awkward at a at a a buffet table,
[1:49:34] the brothers saying, "No, you go. No,
[1:49:35] you go. No, you go. No, you
[1:49:38] go." Simple, isn't it? It sounds simple,
[1:49:42] but is it? Sometimes you see people just
[1:49:44] about fighting to get in line first.
[1:49:48] We've been hungry. I mean, we fasted. We
[1:49:50] didn't even have breakfast, so we got to
[1:49:52] eat,
[1:49:53] man. You know, there's no pride in the
[1:49:57] bride. Amen. We just heard that there
[1:50:00] was nothing that that was desired to be
[1:50:03] seen in Jesus, right? What is that
[1:50:07] verse? He's despised. Oh, no. It's uh
[1:50:10] verse two. For he shall grow up. This is
[1:50:12] Isaiah 53. He shall grow up before him
[1:50:15] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[1:50:18] dry
[1:50:19] ground. You ever see what happens when
[1:50:21] you take a root out of dry ground? When
[1:50:23] you pull roots out of the garden, you
[1:50:25] don't have to worry about burning them
[1:50:26] or throwing them out. When they're just
[1:50:29] a tender plant with a root, you just
[1:50:31] have to pull it out and throw it down on
[1:50:33] the ground. Just drop it. And what
[1:50:35] happens is it shrivels up, right? A root
[1:50:40] out of dry ground. He hath no form nor
[1:50:45] calmliness. And when we shall see him,
[1:50:47] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:50:51] him. This was the image that he brought
[1:50:54] to the world.
[1:50:56] I think it's so beautiful because it
[1:50:58] shows really the position of the bride.
[1:51:00] She's not vaunting herself ahead. She's
[1:51:03] not trying to create an online image, an
[1:51:06] online presence around the world so that
[1:51:09] people would see her and and and and try
[1:51:12] and be her. That's not it at all. She is
[1:51:16] trying to submit herself to what her
[1:51:18] husband wants. And we know that every
[1:51:20] wife understands what her husband wants.
[1:51:24] And I want to say this, if we don't know
[1:51:26] what our husband wants, then there's a
[1:51:28] problem in that
[1:51:29] marriage. We need to know what the
[1:51:32] others want. But here we have this
[1:51:35] masterpiece, a bride for Christ. And you
[1:51:38] know, I just can't help but think like
[1:51:40] brother Farah sang today, we've got
[1:51:42] every single reason to praise because if
[1:51:44] we can see that we are the bride, he's
[1:51:47] been working on us to have the position
[1:51:50] that we have for over 2,000 years. I
[1:51:53] would say even many more thousand years
[1:51:55] for us to be exactly where we are. To be
[1:51:57] able to hear the word that we hear, to
[1:51:59] be able to worship the way we worship.
[1:52:02] We've got every single reason to praise
[1:52:04] the Lord. My and not even care who's
[1:52:07] listening. Not even care what's around
[1:52:10] us. This bride is the one that's going
[1:52:13] to be in heaven where he heaven is just
[1:52:14] silent for a little while so that the
[1:52:17] bride can worship. so that the redeemed
[1:52:19] ones can actually give glory to God for
[1:52:22] what he's done for them. Isaiah chapter
[1:52:25] 53. Goodness. He goes on to say, "In so
[1:52:29] doing it, he does it by his
[1:52:30] neverchanging method. The same way he
[1:52:33] made the masterpiece." Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:35] Amen. Is it any accident that we are in
[1:52:38] the third pole now?
[1:52:40] living under the full manifestation of
[1:52:42] the word, the complete opening of the
[1:52:44] word, recognizing that it is the spoken
[1:52:47] word. Amen. That's his neverchanging way
[1:52:50] of doing it. But now, as we heard
[1:52:53] brother Mvin say it, you know, there's a
[1:52:54] a Revelations 10 1-7, but there's also
[1:52:58] an 8 to11.
[1:53:00] There was John the Baptist portion where
[1:53:02] he was instructed as a type of the bride
[1:53:04] to take the book and eat it up. But then
[1:53:06] you got to do something with that. It's
[1:53:07] going to come out. Amen. Just was making
[1:53:09] me think as I was listening to that that
[1:53:11] song. It's bubbling. It's bubbling. It's
[1:53:13] bubbling in my soul. I just have to get
[1:53:15] it out. It's got to come out.
[1:53:18] When we take that book and eat it up, it
[1:53:20] changes us. Amen. And you know, we're
[1:53:22] going to prophesy. Amen. Either by word
[1:53:25] or by deed, we're going to prophesy. The
[1:53:27] world around us is going to see that
[1:53:29] word in our lives. It's his
[1:53:31] neverchanging method. The same way he
[1:53:34] made the masterpiece, his word. So
[1:53:38] beautiful. That's the way he makes his
[1:53:40] masterpieces because he can only be a
[1:53:43] perfect masterpiece when it's the
[1:53:46] perfect word. Isn't that beautiful? When
[1:53:49] we accept this word into our lives and
[1:53:51] we say, "Be it unto me just like Mary
[1:53:53] according to thy word, the angel
[1:53:55] messenger brought the message to
[1:53:58] her." And she didn't challenge it. She
[1:54:01] didn't argue with it. She didn't say,
[1:54:03] "Well, the elders, you know, well, our
[1:54:05] tradition, well, you know, I just can't
[1:54:08] understand it. I can't really see it."
[1:54:10] She didn't do any of that. She said, "Be
[1:54:12] it unto me according to what?
[1:54:16] Thy word."
[1:54:18] Thy word.
[1:54:22] I just think it's beautiful. This
[1:54:23] message, the masterpiece, highly
[1:54:24] recommend listening to it.
[1:54:28] You know, there's another part to this
[1:54:30] that I think is so good and it's
[1:54:32] relevant to the day in which we
[1:54:35] live in 64. Brother Bradom talks about
[1:54:38] this in in paragraph
[1:54:40] 134,
[1:54:42] how the
[1:54:44] prophet, he talks about how God came
[1:54:48] down and draw those things. We'll we'll
[1:54:52] read this quote paragraph 134. He says,
[1:54:54] "Notice here, the life that was in the
[1:54:57] stock tassel all now ends up in the
[1:55:02] seed." We talked about this in Saskatoon
[1:55:05] and I think it's so beautiful, brothers
[1:55:06] and sisters. We need to remember that
[1:55:08] there's no without the stock and without
[1:55:10] the tassel and without the husk, there's
[1:55:13] no seed. If we're a seed today, then
[1:55:16] every single part of that plant was
[1:55:19] required for us to be where we are.
[1:55:21] Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] to say that somebody else is just chaff.
[1:55:25] They're just a husk. They're just a a
[1:55:28] stock. That same exact life that caused
[1:55:32] that seed to crack and rot and come to
[1:55:35] life and then grow the stock and grow
[1:55:38] the leaves and to grow the tassel and to
[1:55:41] grow the husk that the seed is in where
[1:55:43] the that dries out and becomes chaff
[1:55:45] when that seed actually is released.
[1:55:48] That whole entire plant lived off the
[1:55:51] exact same life. And brother Bradom
[1:55:54] talks about it very clearly in the
[1:55:56] church in the in this message here about
[1:55:58] the church ages and talking about the
[1:56:02] stock. The seed, the stock, the tassel
[1:56:05] and the husk or the chap and then the
[1:56:07] seed again. It goes back to the seed
[1:56:09] again. That original life. That's why
[1:56:12] that song is so good. It's the original
[1:56:13] life. It's the original seed. It's the
[1:56:16] original word. That's what we believe.
[1:56:18] Amen. Amen. But he says, notice here,
[1:56:21] the life that was in the stock tassel
[1:56:23] all now ends up in the seed. The life
[1:56:26] that come out of the original seed come
[1:56:29] up through different processes. Three
[1:56:32] different processes and then turns back
[1:56:36] to its original condition. Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] Oh my. I'm the happiest person in the
[1:56:43] world that God has let me see this.
[1:56:46] Amen. Is that where we are today,
[1:56:48] brothers and sisters? I'm not trying to
[1:56:51] do a pep rally, but I am trying to to
[1:56:53] maybe highlight the importance of what
[1:56:56] we're seeing here. The importance to see
[1:56:59] if we are truly the seed, the elect of
[1:57:03] God, then we truly are a masterpiece in
[1:57:06] his eyes.
[1:57:09] And how beautiful it could be if we
[1:57:11] could look at one another and see each
[1:57:13] other as a masterpiece.
[1:57:16] The only way we're going to do that is
[1:57:17] to recognize that when we have the flaw
[1:57:19] in our life, that's because God chose
[1:57:21] that. Don't think that God doesn't know
[1:57:24] about our flaws. Don't think he doesn't
[1:57:26] know about our gimps. Don't think he
[1:57:29] doesn't know about our shortcomings and
[1:57:31] and our silent struggles and our on
[1:57:34] display struggles. All of our family
[1:57:36] struggles, all of our situations,
[1:57:39] everything is naked before God. He knows
[1:57:42] all about it. He knew that we would be
[1:57:44] here and he knew that is what we will
[1:57:48] overcome in the lives that we live
[1:57:51] because that's how we get to sit with
[1:57:53] him in his throne. It's not overcoming
[1:57:55] this world and saying I don't go out and
[1:57:57] drink and smoke and corouse. It's
[1:57:59] overcoming this guy. We were talking
[1:58:01] about it on on Sunday after service and
[1:58:04] just many of the days that we were there
[1:58:06] about how the resurrection that
[1:58:08] happened, it was the most beautiful
[1:58:11] thing. That resurrection is on display
[1:58:13] today. But it wouldn't have happened
[1:58:15] unless he laid down his will first in
[1:58:18] the garden of e uh the garden of
[1:58:20] Gethsemane where he laid down his will.
[1:58:23] When he laid down his will, the first
[1:58:25] drops of blood struck the ground. I
[1:58:29] remember brother Ken preaching that.
[1:58:30] Never forget it the way he brought it.
[1:58:33] That's where the victory was won,
[1:58:34] brothers and sisters. Where he laid down
[1:58:36] his life. He laid down his will. We
[1:58:39] could say that he laid down his life. He
[1:58:41] never died in the garden, did he? No.
[1:58:44] No. But his will did. Yes. And when
[1:58:47] we're willing, when we're willing to lay
[1:58:50] down our will, that's when the victory
[1:58:53] comes. Amen. And that doesn't come any
[1:58:56] other way than by submitting unto the
[1:58:58] Lord. And what better way than on our
[1:59:01] knees. And remember the story Jesus, he
[1:59:04] he went with his disciples further and
[1:59:06] further into the garden. And he told
[1:59:08] them to just sit here and pray, just
[1:59:10] terry with me for a little while. And he
[1:59:12] went further by himself and prayed and
[1:59:15] asked the father that he could take this
[1:59:18] cup from him. And he came back to see
[1:59:20] his disciples because he wasn't getting
[1:59:22] the answer that he wanted. Are you
[1:59:24] praying with me? Are you praying with
[1:59:26] me? Are you standing with me? You're my
[1:59:28] brethren. Oh, they're sleeping. Oh,
[1:59:30] they're sleeping. Can you imagine that?
[1:59:32] In the hour of his turmoil,
[1:59:34] understanding the gravity of what was
[1:59:36] coming his way. He knew what was
[1:59:38] happening. But yet his buddies, they're
[1:59:41] just sleeping.
[1:59:43] You know, you have the the ideology, the
[1:59:45] idea, I guess. Sorry for the grammar.
[1:59:49] But the theory that Jesus wasn't
[1:59:53] God, it's just a
[1:59:55] man. I I' I've been astounded by this
[1:59:59] theory because, you know, even in
[2:00:02] brother Brandham's day, he said that he
[2:00:04] had a woman that came to him and said,
[2:00:05] "Brother Brandom, you make Jesus God.
[2:00:07] How could you do
[2:00:09] that?" He was God.
[2:00:13] Nobody could do the things that he did.
[2:00:16] Yes. Nobody could create.
[2:00:20] Nobody could speak to the storm. Nobody
[2:00:22] has ever walked on water except for
[2:00:24] Peter. Amen. But only at the word of the
[2:00:28] master.
[2:00:30] But there's the same spirit that was
[2:00:32] around in brother Brandham's day that
[2:00:33] said, you know, he he was just a man. He
[2:00:36] was only a man. He's a good man, but he
[2:00:39] is only a man. Soon as you take God out
[2:00:43] of the equation, isn't it interesting
[2:00:44] that spirit's alive and well today,
[2:00:46] brothers and sisters? Because as soon as
[2:00:48] you take God out of the equation in
[2:00:50] Jesus' life, then there's no atoning for
[2:00:52] our sin. And when there's no atoning for
[2:00:54] our sin, then we're lost as lost can be.
[2:00:58] And I love it because even though that
[2:01:01] spirit's alive, it doesn't change that
[2:01:03] that atonement happened. Just because
[2:01:05] the devil can come around and whisper a
[2:01:07] lie, it doesn't mean there isn't truth.
[2:01:12] I think it's so important to recognize
[2:01:14] no matter what the devil tries to say,
[2:01:16] no matter what he tries to do, the
[2:01:18] atonement was paid in full. Isn't that
[2:01:21] beautiful? That same spirit's around
[2:01:24] today, though. He's just a man. For some
[2:01:27] people,
[2:01:29] maybe we know Brother Bam. He said that
[2:01:32] woman that said that to him, tried to
[2:01:33] hang that one on him. He said, 'How can
[2:01:35] that be? Well, brother Bham, you know,
[2:01:37] when he went to the tomb of Lazarus, he
[2:01:40] cried. What? What a simple
[2:01:44] explanation. What a simple explanation.
[2:01:46] He cried. Okay, so he had emotion. So he
[2:01:51] was tempted in all points as we
[2:01:54] are. But who was it after he cried?
[2:01:58] Brother Brandham says it when he walked
[2:02:00] up to the tomb of Lazarus and he put his
[2:02:03] shoulders back and he said, "Lazarus,
[2:02:05] come forth." And he didn't say it with a
[2:02:08] a little voice. He said it with a loud
[2:02:09] voice. Lazarus, come forth. Who was
[2:02:11] that? That was God.
[2:02:15] I think it's such a beautiful thought.
[2:02:17] We have the ability to recognize where
[2:02:20] we stand. But in our day, in our
[2:02:24] age, when the vindicated prophet was
[2:02:26] here on earth, God came down and he
[2:02:30] wrote
[2:02:31] things. And one of the examples is he
[2:02:34] told his prophet to pick up your pen and
[2:02:36] write. We know that God doesn't have
[2:02:37] hands. He doesn't have feet. He doesn't
[2:02:40] have a voice box. He doesn't have lips.
[2:02:43] He has the bride body. That's who he
[2:02:45] speaks through. And we know that brother
[2:02:47] Brandham's a part of that. But, you
[2:02:48] know, he was told to pick up your pen
[2:02:50] and write. That's one expression of it.
[2:02:52] Another expression of it is uh he he
[2:02:55] does have a hand if he needs one, if he
[2:02:57] chooses to have one. You can go back
[2:02:59] into the days of uh uh now I'm drawing a
[2:03:03] blank. Daniel, right? We know the story
[2:03:05] how there was the handwriting on the
[2:03:07] wall. Amen. And the king who was mocking
[2:03:10] God, he he was party. They were having a
[2:03:12] party. They were having a shaker,
[2:03:14] weren't they? And they said, "You know
[2:03:15] what? Just doing what we're doing, it's
[2:03:17] just not enough. Let's get a little more
[2:03:18] wild. Let's turn the tunes up a little
[2:03:20] more and let's go and get those vessels
[2:03:22] of gold out of the temple that we took
[2:03:24] from from Jerusalem and let's party with
[2:03:26] those, right? And God, we know that God
[2:03:30] will not be mocked. And that's what was
[2:03:32] happening there. And and and God, he
[2:03:34] came into the room and he wrote it on
[2:03:37] the wall and he wrote it in an unknown
[2:03:39] tongue. And and they didn't know what it
[2:03:42] meant. But it's funny because that king
[2:03:44] after it happened, it said that he got
[2:03:47] so scared and worried that his knees
[2:03:50] smoked together just like a cartoon. Can
[2:03:52] you imagine that? His knees started
[2:03:54] shaking and he got weak in his legs and
[2:03:56] he probably needed support. He didn't
[2:03:57] know what was going
[2:03:59] on. He was probably good and hammered.
[2:04:03] Partying down, having a shaker, mocking
[2:04:05] God with those vessels.
[2:04:07] And what did it take? A prophet from
[2:04:09] God. Amen. And we know the queen said,
[2:04:12] "You know what? There's a dissolver of
[2:04:13] doubts in the land." And all you have to
[2:04:16] do is ask him.
[2:04:19] And when he came, he told him, "You know
[2:04:21] what? You're done." Amen. As you hear
[2:04:25] the children say these days, you're
[2:04:27] cooked.
[2:04:29] You're
[2:04:31] over. God's done with you. You think you
[2:04:35] can mock him and get away with it? It's
[2:04:37] over.
[2:04:39] But you know something else happened in
[2:04:41] the day in which we live and I think
[2:04:43] it's beautiful. We'll just keep reading
[2:04:46] here. Just like we prove the
[2:04:49] resurrection, the rise, the sun, the
[2:04:51] setting of the sun, the rising again,
[2:04:53] the leaf going out of the tree down in
[2:04:58] the sap into the root and comes back up.
[2:05:01] And the leaf comes back with it again
[2:05:03] and falls on the ground. the life of the
[2:05:05] tree sucks it right back the calcium the
[2:05:08] pod ash and brings it right up to
[2:05:09] another leaf again. See all nature
[2:05:11] everything works right with the word of
[2:05:14] God. Amen. And here it is exactly
[2:05:17] perfectly in these church
[2:05:20] ages. That's the reason the Holy Ghost
[2:05:23] came down and draw those things and made
[2:05:26] them out for us the way he has. That's
[2:05:31] exactly this is in the
[2:05:33] masterpiece. I think it's an amazing
[2:05:36] thing how he would bring this up. So,
[2:05:39] brother Logan, if you don't mind just
[2:05:40] bringing up that picture. I think it's
[2:05:43] really interesting and and worthy of the
[2:05:46] discussion to just know, did it come
[2:05:51] through of the church ages? It was in
[2:05:54] the
[2:05:55] email with all the quotes. I made it a
[2:05:58] little bit confusing the way I did it
[2:05:59] this morning, but how many of us are
[2:06:02] familiar with the picture of the church
[2:06:03] ages?
[2:06:05] How it shows the sun and then it shows
[2:06:07] the moon going over it and and covering
[2:06:10] it up. Even if you just if it's not in
[2:06:13] the email, if you just searched it up,
[2:06:14] you'd be able to bring it
[2:06:16] up. Brother Brandham talks about how the
[2:06:19] Holy Ghost came and wrote that on the
[2:06:22] wall. Brother Brandham drew it as a
[2:06:24] diagram so that we would see it.
[2:06:27] But in the message shalom, which also is
[2:06:30] in
[2:06:32] 1964, he says, 'Now a few months ago, I
[2:06:35] preached for a series of meetings at the
[2:06:37] tabernacle on the seven church ages. You
[2:06:41] perhaps all have heard them. Amen. And
[2:06:44] when I finished drawing out on the
[2:06:47] blackboard the seven church ages, how
[2:06:51] the light come in and how the light went
[2:06:53] out. And I guess you have that perhaps
[2:06:56] here
[2:06:57] somewhere. God bless you. Thank
[2:07:00] you. That's what he drew out. You have
[2:07:03] this somewhere. But now it's among us.
[2:07:05] Anyhow, we know. And the strange thing
[2:07:09] on the last day when the last church age
[2:07:13] was drawn out this great pillar of fire
[2:07:17] which is among us. And you know brothers
[2:07:19] and sisters just because we can't
[2:07:21] visualize it with our own eyes because
[2:07:23] we can't see it. It's here. Don't think
[2:07:26] it's not here. That same pillar of fire
[2:07:28] that he's describing here in the words
[2:07:30] which we're reading is here in this
[2:07:32] room. It's the exact same pillar of
[2:07:35] fire.
[2:07:38] come
[2:07:39] down among hundreds of people and took
[2:07:43] itself back to the back wall of the
[2:07:45] tabernacle. And there before these
[2:07:49] hundreds
[2:07:50] draw those church ages darkening and
[2:07:54] lightening just exactly the way I had it
[2:07:57] draw on the board.
[2:08:00] Mysteriously,
[2:08:02] many people probably scratched their
[2:08:04] head and thought, why would this this
[2:08:05] man, this prophet, he should be out
[2:08:07] healing the sick and praying for all the
[2:08:09] sick people and all the things in this
[2:08:11] world. Why would he be drawing that
[2:08:14] out? We can look at it and say, "Blessed
[2:08:16] be the name of the Lord because we
[2:08:18] recognize why he drew it out. It gave us
[2:08:21] an example of the different church
[2:08:23] ages."
[2:08:25] But he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:08:27] forever. Isn't it the same thing as when
[2:08:29] Daniel was there? This is bringing
[2:08:32] judgment, too, brothers and sisters.
[2:08:34] Don't think it's not. This is not a
[2:08:36] flowery bed of ease. This is showing
[2:08:39] what took place in the church ages. And
[2:08:42] we know the dark ages was a very, very
[2:08:44] dark time. And the people who were the
[2:08:47] bride in those ages, they gave their
[2:08:50] lives. Amen. And we know, brother
[2:08:54] Brandham talks about it graphically, the
[2:08:56] young virgins and and how they were
[2:08:59] treated. Their hair, their beautiful
[2:09:01] long hair was dipped in tar. And then
[2:09:04] they were tied up and their hair was set
[2:09:07] on fire to burn as human torches until
[2:09:10] they gasped their last breath. And then
[2:09:13] they were fed to lions. And some other
[2:09:15] ones were fed to lions. and some other
[2:09:17] ones were tied to the underside of logs
[2:09:20] so that wild dogs could eat their flesh
[2:09:22] off of them while they were still alive.
[2:09:24] There's so many graphic, gruesome things
[2:09:26] that these people went through so that
[2:09:28] we could have this word today.
[2:09:31] I'm not saying it to scare us or make us
[2:09:33] feel bad. I'm saying it so that we would
[2:09:35] understand that we have every reason to
[2:09:38] rejoice.
[2:09:40] People gave their lives so that we could
[2:09:43] have this religious freedom.
[2:09:45] Amen. And we could even fast forward it
[2:09:48] even up to to be a Canadian, to be
[2:09:50] someone who is in the US. People gave
[2:09:52] their lives so that we could have the
[2:09:54] freedom here. But I'll say this, they
[2:09:56] did not give their lives so that we
[2:09:58] could put a rainbow flag and have a
[2:10:00] great parade and say, "We're all
[2:10:02] different sexual beings than the way God
[2:10:05] created us." And we're going to call it
[2:10:07] pride. Those people that gave their
[2:10:09] lives for our freedom here did not give
[2:10:12] it so that we could behave like that,
[2:10:14] right? That's right. That's right.
[2:10:18] Those people that try and make out like
[2:10:20] they have some right.
[2:10:24] I was talking to someone recently. I
[2:10:25] think it was Isaac. You know, there's
[2:10:27] coming a day. But the people, they've
[2:10:29] got their rights here. And you know
[2:10:31] what? We're going to say have them. Take
[2:10:33] them. Yes, but I'm not going to be shy
[2:10:36] and say that you got those rights
[2:10:38] because someone went out and put a
[2:10:40] rainbow flag on the end of their bayonet
[2:10:43] and waved it at the Russians or at the
[2:10:45] Germans and won a war because of it. No,
[2:10:50] there wasn't one person with a rainbow
[2:10:53] flag then.
[2:10:55] Not
[2:10:55] one. And they've taken it and tried. The
[2:10:59] devil has taken it. We're not going to
[2:11:01] put it on any human being. We're going
[2:11:02] to put it on the devil where it belongs.
[2:11:05] It's the
[2:11:06] devil trying to pervert. That's the only
[2:11:09] thing he's got to try and take that
[2:11:12] unconditional covenant that God gave
[2:11:15] Noah to say there would never be a
[2:11:18] flood.
[2:11:21] My amen.
[2:11:24] Getting back to the
[2:11:27] masterpiece, he says, notice here, the
[2:11:30] life that was in the husk, in the stock
[2:11:33] and in the tassel, in the husk all
[2:11:36] gathers in the seed. And the life that
[2:11:39] was in the stock went, and one went to
[2:11:42] make the other.
[2:11:45] Justification made way for
[2:11:48] sanctification. Sanctification made way
[2:11:51] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I
[2:11:54] love how Brother Brandham goes on. I
[2:11:57] think it's real important here. There's
[2:11:58] a a real important key here, brothers
[2:12:01] and sisters. The baptism of the Holy
[2:12:03] Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[2:12:06] itself. Amen. It's not about just saying
[2:12:10] that I've done the the steps of grace
[2:12:12] and now I understand that we've got the
[2:12:15] word. God sent a prophet and everything
[2:12:16] is fine in my life and and I've got the
[2:12:19] Holy Ghost. Amen. I can come to church
[2:12:20] and say amen. It's not about that at
[2:12:22] all. It's about the resurrection of the
[2:12:26] literal life of Jesus Christ inside of
[2:12:28] us. It's about understanding that there
[2:12:30] has to be a resurrection today. That
[2:12:33] tomb has to open up. that stone that
[2:12:36] stone stony heart has got to be rolled
[2:12:39] away so that that fleshy heart can be
[2:12:42] exposed where the Holy Ghost itself can
[2:12:45] actually manifest in our lives. It's not
[2:12:48] just about having the baptism of the
[2:12:50] Holy Ghost and seeing signs and wonders.
[2:12:52] It's not about seeing the the great
[2:12:54] things happening in my life. I've got a
[2:12:56] a great income. I've got good health.
[2:12:58] I've got all these things that the
[2:12:59] blessing of God in my life. They could
[2:13:01] be the curse of God in your life if
[2:13:04] you're not careful. Amen.
[2:13:07] The baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way
[2:13:09] for the Holy Ghost, I want to say it
[2:13:11] this way, himself,
[2:13:14] the Lord Jesus Christ to live out
[2:13:16] through us. So much so that the people
[2:13:19] around us that know us the most, they
[2:13:21] say, "What happened to you? Because
[2:13:24] you're not the same as you used to be."
[2:13:26] Amen. For the better. for the better.
[2:13:31] Brothers and sisters, this gospel we're
[2:13:32] talking about, this Holy Ghost that
[2:13:34] we're talking about, does not make us
[2:13:35] legalistic.
[2:13:37] It doesn't puff us up with pride. We
[2:13:38] don't become a stuffed shirt because of
[2:13:40] this gospel. We become humble.
[2:13:45] Thank you. This gospel changes us for
[2:13:49] the better.
[2:13:51] This gospel allows us to have joy. This
[2:13:55] gospel allows us to have peace. Amen.
[2:13:58] This gospel allows us to be
[2:14:00] long-suffering and gentlemen. Oh my. We
[2:14:04] know the fruit of the spirit. That's
[2:14:06] what this gospel does for us because
[2:14:07] that is the literal life of Jesus Christ
[2:14:10] living out through us. Amen.
[2:14:14] The Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[2:14:17] Ghost itself to come right down in
[2:14:20] perfection
[2:14:22] back to the word again to manifest
[2:14:26] itself. Where's it going to manifest?
[2:14:27] Brothers and sisters, I want to say it
[2:14:29] this way. Calgary living word.
[2:14:32] Those people who are living word
[2:14:35] manifestations of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:14:38] Those people, not because you're an
[2:14:39] association in membership of Calgary
[2:14:42] living word. No. Because you have taken
[2:14:44] that word and hid it in your heart that
[2:14:46] you might not sin against him. What is
[2:14:49] sin, brothers and sisters? Sin is
[2:14:51] unbelief. Amen. Sin is not running out
[2:14:54] and smoking or drinking or carousing or
[2:14:56] doing all those things. Those are all
[2:14:57] attributes of sin. But you wouldn't do
[2:15:00] them if you believed. Amen.
[2:15:04] Remember, brothers and sisters, the
[2:15:05] flaw. I'll call the musicians because
[2:15:07] we're going to close. The
[2:15:10] flaw. When we see it, just remember
[2:15:15] that's God.
[2:15:18] remember brother Brandham talking about
[2:15:20] being in I think it was in South
[2:15:24] Africa and how maybe it wasn't in South
[2:15:27] Africa he was somewhere I know in South
[2:15:30] Africa he had the dump trucks the mayor
[2:15:32] of the city said come and look at the
[2:15:34] dump trucks hauling all of the equipment
[2:15:36] from the people that were healed they
[2:15:37] don't need the crutches and wheelchairs
[2:15:39] and walkers and all the stuff but what
[2:15:43] I'm thinking of is where brother Bradom
[2:15:45] was using a church for his meetings and
[2:15:47] he waited. He got there early and he had
[2:15:50] to wait and he watched all of the
[2:15:51] perfectly polished people coming out of
[2:15:54] the church
[2:15:58] and it kind of bothered him and it
[2:16:00] bothered other people around him. The
[2:16:02] people I think even whose church it was
[2:16:05] because after all of the perfectly
[2:16:06] polished
[2:16:08] people who had their mass and were
[2:16:10] blessed, they went
[2:16:12] out. They may even have had the Holy
[2:16:14] Ghost. Brother Bam says you can have the
[2:16:17] Holy Ghost every hour of your life and
[2:16:18] still go to
[2:16:19] hell. The reason for that, brothers and
[2:16:21] sisters, is because people won't
[2:16:23] actually make way for the Holy Ghost
[2:16:24] itself to live out through
[2:16:27] them. They'll say, "I'm I'm not going to
[2:16:29] give this up and I'm not going to give
[2:16:30] that up. I'm going to keep the other
[2:16:32] thing." I say, "Lord, help me." But
[2:16:34] Brother Brandham looked at the perfectly
[2:16:36] polished people coming out and then he
[2:16:38] saw his people coming in, the lame and
[2:16:41] the halt and the blind.
[2:16:44] Maybe some smelly people, maybe some
[2:16:46] people not dressed very well. But you
[2:16:49] know, that's who Christ came for.
[2:16:53] I was just in prayer and I was thinking
[2:16:55] about it. You know, Lord, let us never
[2:16:59] ever have the publican attitude.
[2:17:04] Let us never be that way where we stand
[2:17:08] praying saying, "Oh Lord, I'm so glad
[2:17:11] I'm not like brother Barry.
[2:17:14] I've been in church all my life. I don't
[2:17:17] have a flaw. I never strayed from the
[2:17:21] message. So, I don't have those scars.
[2:17:23] But I want to say this. Do you know what
[2:17:25] it's like to get kicked around in the
[2:17:27] world? Do you know the law of the
[2:17:30] contrast? Do you understand what it
[2:17:31] means to actually be redeemed?
[2:17:34] Sometimes we need to have a little bit
[2:17:37] of a scar in our life to realize the
[2:17:40] masterpiece.
[2:17:42] And sometimes if we've never had that in
[2:17:44] our lives, we can cause our our our
[2:17:47] behavior to act like a publican. I'm so
[2:17:50] glad that I've never gone down that
[2:17:51] road. Don't ever act like a publican.
[2:17:56] Pray like the sinner and say, "Lord, I'm
[2:17:59] not even worthy of your grace, but you
[2:18:02] still chose me, so I'm willing to accept
[2:18:05] it the way that you've given it."
[2:18:08] Hallelujah. Maybe stand with me as we
[2:18:10] close. When we see the flaw, brothers
[2:18:12] and sisters, don't be afraid of it.
[2:18:14] Thank the Lord for that flaw. Thank him
[2:18:18] because when he sees his own image, he's
[2:18:22] going to strike that that sculpture and
[2:18:25] and he's going to make it a
[2:18:28] masterpiece. One last quote as we close.
[2:18:34] Brother Brandham says, "But you notice
[2:18:36] the church only came into view once,
[2:18:39] talking about the view of the bride, the
[2:18:41] preview of the bride." And he talks
[2:18:44] about the churches and how he had the
[2:18:46] vision. And and you can look it up and
[2:18:48] you can see it. It's in the masterpiece.
[2:18:50] He talks about this. You notice the
[2:18:52] church only came into view once, each
[2:18:55] nation, the
[2:18:57] church, but the bride come in twice.
[2:19:01] Isn't that beautiful?
[2:19:03] The church is given one shot. And
[2:19:07] remember, brother Brandham in the church
[2:19:08] age book, he says that every single one
[2:19:10] who calls themsself a Christian but
[2:19:12] isn't willing to accept the word the way
[2:19:14] that it was given in the day in which it
[2:19:15] was given through the vindicated prophet
[2:19:17] for the age. Everyone that's not willing
[2:19:19] to accept the word, but calls themsself
[2:19:21] a Christian is going to be judged
[2:19:24] according to the Christian values,
[2:19:26] according to his word, which means
[2:19:29] they're going to have the maximum
[2:19:30] judgment. The word of God says that it
[2:19:32] would have been better for them to not
[2:19:34] even have
[2:19:35] known than to call themselves a
[2:19:37] Christian, get a little bit puffed up,
[2:19:39] and act like they're something. Remember
[2:19:41] the rich young ruler? He lifted up his
[2:19:43] eyes in hell and immediately started
[2:19:45] barking out orders to Abraham. Get that
[2:19:48] beggar over there to come and bring me
[2:19:49] some water. I'm I'm suffering. Can't you
[2:19:51] see? Amen. What gall, what audacity. It
[2:19:55] just goes to show that the character we
[2:19:57] have here is what's going there. We
[2:20:00] don't change who we are. We only change
[2:20:02] our dwelling place. Glory to God. I I
[2:20:05] say, "Lord, just keep chiseling. Just
[2:20:08] keep working on me. Just keep peeling
[2:20:10] off the layers. Just keep polishing me,
[2:20:13] Lord." Oh my. The bride, she come in
[2:20:16] view twice. He says, "See what it was
[2:20:18] now, not knowing it, but look at it with
[2:20:21] my message this morning." Not knowing
[2:20:23] that, see the seed fell in that ground
[2:20:26] at Nia. That was the original seed and
[2:20:29] she's come through the process of these
[2:20:32] denominations which only comes in
[2:20:34] existence
[2:20:35] once but the bride returns back again in
[2:20:39] the last days. I will restore saith the
[2:20:43] Lord.
[2:20:44] See the masterpiece is brought up.
[2:20:46] That's the reason she was in view. She's
[2:20:50] the
[2:20:52] masterpiece. That's the reason she was
[2:20:55] in view. reviewed the second time. She
[2:20:58] was reviewed the first time, then she
[2:21:01] was reviewed the second time. And she
[2:21:03] was perfectly the second time like she
[2:21:07] was the first time. Isn't that
[2:21:10] beautiful? How many of us feel like
[2:21:12] we're perfect like the first time? I I
[2:21:15] don't know. I I I struggle to put my
[2:21:17] hand up. I don't feel like I'm perfect.
[2:21:19] That's why the prophet said, "Your
[2:21:21] feelings got nothing to do with it."
[2:21:23] Amen. That's why the Holy Ghost is
[2:21:25] without sensation. Just because we have
[2:21:27] a a a holy hallelujah doesn't mean that
[2:21:30] we're saved. We can just fall under the
[2:21:33] anointing.
[2:21:37] My God bless you today. I'll shut up.
[2:21:39] Just remember this. You are his
[2:21:42] masterpiece.
[2:21:44] Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father,
[2:21:47] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word.
[2:21:49] Amen. Thank you for sending a vindicated
[2:21:52] prophet, Lord. Father, thank you for
[2:21:55] giving us ears to hear what your spirit
[2:21:57] said to the
[2:21:59] church. I pray, Lord Jesus, that somehow
[2:22:02] someway
[2:22:03] today there would be words encouraging
[2:22:05] to us, Lord. That Amen. Father, we would
[2:22:08] desire to just surrender ourselves unto
[2:22:10] you in a greater way.
[2:22:14] Father, I I say these words and you know
[2:22:17] my heart. I say these words from my
[2:22:20] heart because I desire a greater
[2:22:22] surrender unto you, Lord.
[2:22:25] Father, the only way that we're going to
[2:22:28] get up is to first go down. Amen. And
[2:22:32] Father, I pray that we would just, Lord,
[2:22:35] have a humility in our heart that's
[2:22:37] second to
[2:22:38] none. As your bride, we recognize it's
[2:22:41] only by your grace that we're saved.
[2:22:45] Father, we pray that Lord, you would
[2:22:47] just keep your hand upon each one of us
[2:22:48] as we go our separate ways. Be with
[2:22:50] those who couldn't come today, whatever
[2:22:52] the reason. Lord, be with the sick and
[2:22:54] the afflicted. Father, be with those who
[2:22:57] are just streaming. And Lord
[2:23:00] Jesus, my prayer is that we would find
[2:23:03] that last predestinated seed in the city
[2:23:05] of Calvary. Yes. Thank you, Lord. That
[2:23:07] we would have that desire, Lord Jesus,
[2:23:09] to witness your life to this world
[2:23:11] around us. Amen. And father we pray Lord
[2:23:15] Jesus for brother Toby and brother
[2:23:18] Gilbert Lord and brother Paul who put
[2:23:21] their shoulder to the wheel week after
[2:23:23] week Lord month after month to take your
[2:23:26] word to the saints at Lethbridge.
[2:23:28] Pray that you would bless their way. We
[2:23:31] pray that you would just grant to them a
[2:23:33] fresh coal off the altar. Lord, that
[2:23:36] when the the burden gets heavy, Lord
[2:23:38] Jesus, when they would rather just be in
[2:23:41] service, saying amen, that Father, Lord,
[2:23:43] there would be a supernatural boost in
[2:23:46] their lives, Father, that you would just
[2:23:48] encourage them in a supernatural way.
[2:23:51] Father, we pray for the saints in
[2:23:53] Lethbridge, Lord, that they would be
[2:23:55] able to find the last predestinated seed
[2:23:57] there as well. Father, help us each one
[2:24:00] in our lives as we go. Father, we'll be
[2:24:03] careful to give you all the praise. Yes.
[2:24:05] Amen. Lord, we love you and we thank
[2:24:07] you. We just ask all of these things. In
[2:24:10] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:24:14] Amen. Can we sing the song When the
[2:24:17] Redeemed, when the redeemed are
[2:24:20] gathering in, all washed like
[2:24:23] snow and free from all sin. You know, we
[2:24:27] can raise a heavenly anthem and we will
