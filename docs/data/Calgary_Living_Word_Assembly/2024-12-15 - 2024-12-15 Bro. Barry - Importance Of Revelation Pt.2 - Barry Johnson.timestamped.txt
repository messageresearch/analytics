[39:58] [Music]
[40:18] um we have a special song to do um but
[40:21] if I may just
[40:22] quickly tell us the story behind the
[40:25] song It's a song that we know and we
[40:29] sing and we have known for a long time
[40:32] but there is actually a
[40:34] very interesting story about this
[40:37] song and it has to do with um a man in
[40:42] India who believed the word of God from
[40:45] the Baptist um missionaries that had
[40:48] gone to India it was part of a
[40:51] tribe and this was about 150 years
[40:55] ago and um
[40:57] because he made his decision to follow
[41:00] Jesus uh the chief of the tribe um and
[41:03] the rest of the tribe started to
[41:05] persecute him and uh at some point they
[41:09] asked him to renounce
[41:11] Jesus and if he wasn't going to they
[41:14] were going to kill his
[41:15] family and he said he wasn't going to um
[41:20] and they started to kill each of the
[41:22] family
[41:24] members he said the cross before me
[41:27] the World Behind Me no turning back and
[41:31] he had to eventually pay with his
[41:34] life and maybe we don't have to go
[41:36] through that but every day in our lives
[41:38] we make
[41:39] decisions and we make decisions whether
[41:41] to follow Jesus or not but I just pray
[41:45] that every time we remember this song We
[41:48] Remember the story behind the song and
[41:51] realize that we all have to make that
[41:53] decision to follow Jesus every day of
[41:56] our life
[41:58] we're going to do the first two verses
[42:01] as instrumental and they will'll invite
[42:03] you to join us to you know sing the rest
[42:06] of
[42:07] it God bless you

[58:12] because we know that your ear is always
[58:14] open to our
[58:16] prayer and Lord not in a way that you're
[58:19] in a different dimension listening to us

[58:48] of an uplift hand father you knew about
[58:50] those needs before the foundation of the
[58:52] world before there even was a speck of
[58:55] Stardust you knew those needs would come
[58:58] forward this
[58:59] morning and we just commit them into

[1:03:40] Consciousness every single moment of Our
[1:03:42] Lives Lord when we wake up in the
[1:03:45] morning that we would think about you

[1:04:13] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[1:04:15] this morning you may be seated today
[1:04:19] just a couple of announcements we have
[1:04:20] the Youth Event this afternoon after
[1:04:22] service and uh I believe that's already
[1:04:25] ready arranged so God bless you I think
[1:04:28] it's a wonderful opportunity for the
[1:04:30] children to get together the youth to
[1:04:32] get together and uh if you ever run out
[1:04:36] of things to pray for which I don't
[1:04:38] think is entirely possible but if you
[1:04:41] ever do just remember the youth because
[1:04:43] if the devil has one one Target in mind
[1:04:46] it's the youth he wants to take the
[1:04:48] youth and try and dangle the shiny
[1:04:51] things before their eyes he wants to try
[1:04:54] and talk to the youth through friends
[1:04:56] and and Associates and and say to them
[1:04:59] do you really go to church do you do you
[1:05:02] really go and do that on Sunday why
[1:05:04] don't you come and hang out with us
[1:05:06] we're going to go skiing we're going to
[1:05:08] go snowboarding we're going to go and do
[1:05:10] the fun things in the world maybe we're
[1:05:12] going to go to a party maybe we're going
[1:05:15] to do all these different things I can
[1:05:17] tell you by witness I'm I'm a living
[1:05:19] witness that the devil is going to lead
[1:05:21] you down a path of Destruction the devil
[1:05:24] is going to take the children and lead
[1:05:26] them to a place where they're going to
[1:05:28] wish they never went to by experience I
[1:05:32] can tell you that but hey we're not
[1:05:34] living there we have the delivering
[1:05:36] power of the Lord Jesus Christ in our
[1:05:38] lives and we're certainly thankful we're
[1:05:41] not here to glorify the devil we're here
[1:05:42] to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ but if
[1:05:45] you ever run out of anything to pray for
[1:05:47] I tell you the youth needs our
[1:05:49] prayer we have a communion service
[1:05:51] coming up on the 31st a communion
[1:05:53] testimony service and uh as mentioned
[1:05:56] I'm sure there would be room for
[1:05:58] specials if there was one or two we
[1:06:00] didn't want to really do a whole special
[1:06:02] service but if we have a couple that
[1:06:03] would certainly be a wonderful thing
[1:06:05] that's on the 31st and then we won't
[1:06:07] have a service on the 1st which is a
[1:06:09] Wednesday because uh of the service on
[1:06:12] the 31st you happy this
[1:06:14] morning we uh last time we we ministered
[1:06:19] which actually was a little while ago um
[1:06:23] we spoke on Revelation the importance of
[1:06:26] Revelation and I I want to speak on the
[1:06:29] importance of Revelation today too as a
[1:06:31] maybe a part two and uh I want to I want
[1:06:34] to speak on it maybe I I I I don't know
[1:06:37] if there's a maybe that's the text and
[1:06:39] this would be the context um call it
[1:06:42] perfect
[1:06:43] realization perfect realization is
[1:06:45] really what what Revelation is and uh
[1:06:49] it's it's the realization of something
[1:06:51] that's not just true or false it's the
[1:06:54] actual explanation of it it's it's the
[1:06:58] idea becoming real to us individually
[1:07:01] you know I I just wanted to pick up from
[1:07:03] where we left off before it's been a
[1:07:05] little while we had uh what a tremendous
[1:07:07] service last week did you enjoy that
[1:07:08] service with brother gift my let's cause
[1:07:12] confusion in the camp of the
[1:07:15] enemy I mean just living our lives every
[1:07:18] single day that we get up we will cause
[1:07:21] confusion in the camp of the enemy
[1:07:23] because we won't be attracted by what he
[1:07:26] has in terms of traps in our lives you
[1:07:29] know in uh in John chapter 6 the
[1:07:33] disciples in verse
[1:07:35] 25 um when they had found him on the
[1:07:37] other side of the sea they said unto him
[1:07:38] Rabbi when camest thou hither Jesus
[1:07:41] answered them and said verily verily I
[1:07:42] say unto you ye seek me not because you
[1:07:45] saw the Miracles but because you did eat
[1:07:48] of the Loaves and were
[1:07:50] filled labor not for the meat which
[1:07:53] perisheth but for that meat which
[1:07:57] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[1:08:00] son of man shall give unto you for him
[1:08:03] hath God the Father sealed remember you
[1:08:08] are what you
[1:08:10] eat I say Lord help me not feed on the
[1:08:12] things of this world help me just remain
[1:08:15] focused on your word let me eat and feed
[1:08:18] upon the word because the more I eat it
[1:08:20] the more I become it you know last week
[1:08:22] we talked about the importance of
[1:08:24] Revelation I'm not going to read the
[1:08:25] whole quote just a little snippet from
[1:08:26] it were you able to get the uh email
[1:08:29] beautiful the exposition of the seven
[1:08:31] Church ages brother bradam he says the
[1:08:34] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[1:08:36] to the True Believer can never be
[1:08:37] overemphasized that means I could preach
[1:08:39] on it every single
[1:08:42] service Revelation means more to you
[1:08:45] than perhaps you realize now I'm not
[1:08:47] talking about this book of
[1:08:50] Revelation and you not the Book of
[1:08:52] Revelation in the Bible even though it's
[1:08:55] a very important study he's not talking
[1:08:56] about that what he's speaking about is
[1:09:00] I'm talking about all Revelation is
[1:09:03] tremendously important to the church so
[1:09:07] I just want to try and maybe do a little
[1:09:09] recap from where we were last time I
[1:09:11] didn't really even get into the quotes
[1:09:13] where I wanted to get to last time um
[1:09:16] but we just trust the Lord you know we
[1:09:19] talked about Peter and and how Peter he
[1:09:23] he he had such an experience with the
[1:09:25] Lord a as Jesus began to to come into
[1:09:28] his ministry we know that he Jesus he
[1:09:33] actually Jesus came and found Peter
[1:09:36] fishing he had toiled all night and
[1:09:38] nothing was happening he was pretty
[1:09:40] frustrated things weren't going well for
[1:09:42] him and and we know that Peter actually
[1:09:47] had to have that Encounter With Jesus so
[1:09:49] that Jesus could say to him you know
[1:09:52] just just let me your boat for a sec I I
[1:09:54] just have to to speak to the people I
[1:09:56] can't really get in front of them
[1:09:58] properly so just if you don't mind just
[1:10:00] allow me your boat and uh we'll see what
[1:10:02] happens and we know Peter was probably
[1:10:04] in a a little bit of a foul mood at the
[1:10:06] time just surmising he he maybe wasn't
[1:10:08] that happy but he he did in the end
[1:10:11] relent and and said okay sure take my
[1:10:13] boat you know nothing's happened I can't
[1:10:15] catch any fish anyway so you might as
[1:10:16] well use it for something useful in Luke
[1:10:19] Chapter
[1:10:20] 5 and it came to pass that as the people
[1:10:24] pressed on him to hear the word of God
[1:10:26] he stood by the lake of ganat and and
[1:10:29] saw two ships standing by the lake but
[1:10:31] the fishermen were gone out of them and
[1:10:32] were washing their Nets and he entered
[1:10:34] into one of the ships which was Simon's
[1:10:37] and prayed of him that he would Thrust
[1:10:39] out a little bit from the land and he
[1:10:41] sat down and taught the people out of
[1:10:43] the ship now when he had left speaking
[1:10:45] he said unto Simon launch out into the
[1:10:48] deep and let down your nets for a
[1:10:51] drought and Simon answering said unto
[1:10:54] him Master we've toy
[1:10:55] all the night we've toiled all night
[1:10:58] long we've done everything we can and
[1:11:01] have taken nothing but here there was
[1:11:03] something inside of Peter Simon that
[1:11:05] didn't really know Jesus at the time but
[1:11:07] there was something in him to say
[1:11:11] nevertheless at Thy
[1:11:14] word now if you recall on Wednesday
[1:11:16] we're talking about the word and and the
[1:11:18] importance of the word and making the
[1:11:20] word Paramount not looking for signs and
[1:11:23] wonders not looking for eloquence not
[1:11:26] looking for all of the things that this
[1:11:28] world looks for in terms of churches and
[1:11:31] church bodies and theology Etc what we
[1:11:35] want to do is do exactly that
[1:11:37] nevertheless Lord at Thy word if your
[1:11:41] word says that I should do this then I'm
[1:11:43] going to do it that's all there is to it
[1:11:46] I'm not going to try and make an excuse
[1:11:47] for it and say wow no we're not
[1:11:51] interested in that we're only interested
[1:11:52] in saying nevertheless at Thy word and
[1:11:54] and I can just say to anyone Again by
[1:11:56] experience if you've never done that
[1:11:58] before and you really want to see
[1:12:00] whether God is God try it once we read
[1:12:03] the quote last time just try it one time
[1:12:06] for real and see if he is not
[1:12:09] God and Simon answering said unto him
[1:12:12] Master we've toiled all the night and
[1:12:13] have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy
[1:12:16] word I will let down the net and I just
[1:12:19] think it's so beautiful the scripture
[1:12:21] here and when they had this done they
[1:12:23] enclosed a great m multitude of fishes
[1:12:26] and their net
[1:12:28] break so much that they couldn't even
[1:12:30] contain it doesn't that sound like
[1:12:32] another scripture in Malachi chapter 3
[1:12:35] amen and they beckoned unto their
[1:12:37] Partners which were in the other ship so
[1:12:40] that they could come and help them and
[1:12:41] they came and filled both ships so that
[1:12:44] they began to sink not just one ship
[1:12:47] didn't just break one net I I think it's
[1:12:50] so wonderful the way God pours out a
[1:12:52] blessing don't you how he will make sure
[1:12:54] that there are witnesses to his life to
[1:12:58] his work it is not a private Affair even
[1:13:02] though the third pull it's it's private
[1:13:05] sure enough it
[1:13:06] is but that doesn't mean other people
[1:13:08] around won't see what's going on and say
[1:13:10] what is causing that to happen how could
[1:13:12] that possibly
[1:13:15] be when Simon Peter
[1:13:17] sought something happened in this man
[1:13:19] didn't it he fell down at jesus' knees
[1:13:22] saying depart from me for I am a sinful
[1:13:24] man oh Lord Lord why because he was
[1:13:28] astonished and all that were with him at
[1:13:30] the jot of fishes which they had taken
[1:13:34] something happened
[1:13:35] naturally God knows exactly where we are
[1:13:39] exactly what we're going through and
[1:13:41] exactly when we're going through it
[1:13:44] there no surprise he's not surprised I
[1:13:46] remember hearing brother Ken say it he's
[1:13:48] not up in heaven ringing his hands
[1:13:50] wondering oh my how is this going to
[1:13:52] work out I never anticipated that
[1:13:54] happening God knew all about it before
[1:13:56] the foundation of the
[1:13:58] world and he's just waiting to see what
[1:14:00] we're going to do amen are we going to
[1:14:02] put him first are we going to put his
[1:14:04] word first are we going to say
[1:14:06] nevertheless at Thy word we know the
[1:14:10] doctor has a word we know the nurse has
[1:14:12] a word sometimes we even know the pastor
[1:14:15] has a word but what is the word of God
[1:14:18] that's the ultimate brothers and
[1:14:21] sisters you know Peter he had lots of
[1:14:23] experiences with the Lord he had the
[1:14:25] opportunity to go to mount
[1:14:27] Transfiguration I know there's a really
[1:14:28] deep preaching on this and I'm not going
[1:14:30] to go there today but we know that when
[1:14:32] he was there something happened in his
[1:14:35] life turn with me quickly over to
[1:14:36] Matthew chapter 17 if you don't
[1:14:39] mind Matthew chapter
[1:14:51] 17 we still have lots of time so I just
[1:14:54] want to try and
[1:14:56] do this pick up from where we were last
[1:14:59] time verse one
[1:15:02] of Matthew chapter
[1:15:05] 17 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter
[1:15:09] James and John his brother and bringeth
[1:15:11] them up into a high mountain
[1:15:13] apart and he was transfigured before
[1:15:16] them and his face did shine as the sun
[1:15:19] and his reignment as white as the light
[1:15:22] and behold there appeared unto them
[1:15:24] Moses and Elijah talking with him then
[1:15:26] answered Peter and said unto Jesus lord
[1:15:28] it's good for us to be here if thou Wilt
[1:15:32] let us make here three Tabernacles one
[1:15:34] for thee and one for Moses and one for
[1:15:38] Elias and while he yet spake Behold a
[1:15:42] bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[1:15:44] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[1:15:47] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[1:15:50] well pleased hear ye him and when the
[1:15:53] disciples heard it they fell on their
[1:15:54] feet faces and were sore afraid and
[1:15:58] Jesus came and touched them and said
[1:16:00] arise Be not Afraid and and when they
[1:16:02] had lifted up their eyes they saw no man
[1:16:05] save Jesus
[1:16:07] only and as they came down from the
[1:16:09] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[1:16:10] no tell the vision to no man until the
[1:16:13] son of man be risen again from the dead
[1:16:17] and the disciples asked him saying why
[1:16:19] then say the scribes that Elias must
[1:16:22] first come and Jesus answered and said
[1:16:24] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[1:16:27] and restore all things but I say unto
[1:16:29] you that Elias is come
[1:16:32] already and they knew him not but have
[1:16:36] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[1:16:38] likewise shall also the son of man
[1:16:41] suffer of them now it doesn't say that
[1:16:45] Jesus explained this part to him so this
[1:16:47] is the part that I want to get to Jesus
[1:16:50] simply told them about Elias he referred
[1:16:54] back to the word he pointed directly
[1:16:56] back to the scripture that they would do
[1:16:58] whatsoever they listed and they knew
[1:17:00] that Elias must first come that's why
[1:17:02] they asked him but but wasn't Elias
[1:17:04] supposed to come first and then verse 13
[1:17:07] then the disciples they understood what
[1:17:09] happened was they got a revelation God
[1:17:12] allowed them to get a revelation and it
[1:17:15] wasn't just a private interpretation it
[1:17:18] was actually known by all three of them
[1:17:22] in the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[1:17:24] let every word be established I think
[1:17:26] it's so beautiful the way the Lord does
[1:17:28] it so he allowed the disciples to
[1:17:30] actually get a perfect realization of
[1:17:33] what the scripture was saying now I'm
[1:17:35] not just going to dwell there we're
[1:17:37] going to bounce back and forth I think
[1:17:38] it's beautiful in our day isn't it how
[1:17:40] we've been given the opportunity to
[1:17:42] receive a revelation about the word for
[1:17:44] our day and not just a revelation where
[1:17:46] we can say it's been revealed to me but
[1:17:49] just an absolute perfect realization
[1:17:52] about not just the word about not just a
[1:17:55] prophet that was sent from God about who
[1:17:57] we are amen a perfect realization about
[1:18:01] what it means to be a husband not just a
[1:18:04] partial Revelation or realization a
[1:18:07] perfect realization about what it means
[1:18:09] to be a
[1:18:11] wife oh my because we talk about being
[1:18:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ we must have
[1:18:16] an absolute perfect revelation of that
[1:18:21] one I think it's wonderful and you know
[1:18:24] what if we don't
[1:18:25] pray that the Lord would give us one
[1:18:27] because if we ask for the right things
[1:18:29] he'll give them to us we just have to
[1:18:31] make sure we ask for the right things
[1:18:33] James told us that didn't he we can just
[1:18:35] wind up asking a Miss because we just
[1:18:37] ask for the things in this flesh and
[1:18:38] this life consume it upon the lust that
[1:18:40] we live I want a new house I want new
[1:18:42] paint on my house I know new car I want
[1:18:45] some new shoes man I want some really
[1:18:47] nice custommade leather shoes all these
[1:18:49] things that don't matter amen the only
[1:18:52] thing that matters is what's going to
[1:18:54] happen to us when we
[1:18:56] die but when we get that part fixed I
[1:18:59] think something happens something
[1:19:00] tremendous happens it gives us a burden
[1:19:02] for the Lost gives us the the desire to
[1:19:06] see other people
[1:19:10] saved the disciples understood that he
[1:19:13] spake unto them of John the Baptist I
[1:19:16] think it's so beautiful again there's
[1:19:18] more scripture we could get into I'm not
[1:19:19] going too too far today we're talking
[1:19:22] about Peter and how God used him how how
[1:19:24] God used him to to actually Express
[1:19:27] himself to and through we know that
[1:19:30] there was many things that happened in
[1:19:32] his life we know there was a time when
[1:19:34] Peter began to rebuke Jesus Jesus was
[1:19:37] telling them that you know the son of
[1:19:38] man has to be lifted up and and and
[1:19:41] suffer all these things and Peter he
[1:19:43] jumped in and said no no no not on my
[1:19:44] watch I know we talked about this last
[1:19:46] time I'm just trying to refresh us on on
[1:19:48] on the thoughts and and Jesus he turned
[1:19:51] to him and he didn't say Peter you need
[1:19:53] to change your thinking you need to
[1:19:55] change what you're talking about you
[1:19:56] need to get in line with the word he got
[1:19:58] right to the heart of the matter he went
[1:19:59] right to the root of the problem didn't
[1:20:01] he he just said Satan get behind me get
[1:20:05] behind me because you don't Savor the
[1:20:06] things of the Lord you're busy savoring
[1:20:10] the things of this world a and and the
[1:20:12] devil is going to come and try and use
[1:20:14] us any way he can to try and encourage
[1:20:17] us to get mixed up and and maybe just a
[1:20:19] little bit off one way or the other he
[1:20:21] doesn't care whether you're Ultra
[1:20:23] religious or whether you're a rank
[1:20:25] sinner he doesn't care whether you're
[1:20:27] one way or the other because either way
[1:20:29] is maybe just a little bit wrong the
[1:20:30] ultra religious is just Ultra covered
[1:20:33] I've got the biggest and the best fig
[1:20:35] Leaf of the bunch I've been to theology
[1:20:38] school maybe I'm I'm a I'm a theologian
[1:20:41] maybe I've actually understand more than
[1:20:43] most people do the devil doesn't care
[1:20:46] what way we go just so long as we don't
[1:20:48] put that word first when we put that
[1:20:50] word first in our lives something
[1:20:52] happens it causes us to see the
[1:20:55] unlocking of the
[1:20:56] formula and that's why what happened in
[1:20:59] the Garden of Eden is such a mystery I
[1:21:00] know we talked about it last time too
[1:21:01] but what really happened in the Garden
[1:21:03] of Eden did they just eat some fruit and
[1:21:05] all of mankind fell all of the animals
[1:21:08] had to perish all of creation had to
[1:21:10] fall and and and go through all of the
[1:21:12] problems that creation is going through
[1:21:14] now and has been since just because of a
[1:21:17] a
[1:21:18] fruit now some would say well they
[1:21:20] disobeyed God's word and sure enough
[1:21:22] they did but they disobeyed God's word
[1:21:24] word to actually do something and and
[1:21:26] when they did that it caused the entire
[1:21:28] fall of
[1:21:30] mankind but if we put God's word first
[1:21:33] the devil can't get to
[1:21:35] us and that's where I want to go today
[1:21:37] with us brothers and sisters to
[1:21:39] encourage us to remember that we have
[1:21:41] been given not just a partial Revelation
[1:21:44] we've been given the full Revelation not
[1:21:46] just about the message of the hour in
[1:21:49] terms of a a knowledge-based
[1:21:51] understanding of the message of the hour
[1:21:53] but we have been given the perfect
[1:21:55] realization through the message of the
[1:21:57] hour about who we
[1:22:01] are and I keep going this way for a
[1:22:03] purpose because once we recognize what
[1:22:05] we are then the Rapture will go amen
[1:22:08] that's what's going to happen that's
[1:22:09] what we're expecting that's the only
[1:22:11] thing that's left as a promise for the
[1:22:13] Gentile church is the rapture to take
[1:22:16] place and any just any day now just any
[1:22:21] moment my it's so
[1:22:23] beautiful going back to our scripture
[1:22:25] this morning in John John 6 then Jesus
[1:22:29] said unto them verily verily I say unto
[1:22:30] you except you eat the Flesh of the son
[1:22:32] of man and drink his blood ye have no
[1:22:35] life in you who so eateth my flesh and
[1:22:38] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:22:40] I will raise him up at the last day and
[1:22:43] we can look at this and say you know
[1:22:45] there's there's lots of different things
[1:22:46] that we've heard about in in the age in
[1:22:48] which we live in there's there's people
[1:22:50] that that just worship the ideology of
[1:22:53] vampires and not going to go into that
[1:22:55] but I know brother Bram he talked about
[1:22:57] vampire he said they they think I'm a
[1:22:59] vampire by saying that so that's the
[1:23:01] reason I'm talking that way I'm not
[1:23:02] trying to bring anything strange to us
[1:23:04] but but the whole ideology of the
[1:23:06] vampire has become glorified in the age
[1:23:09] in which we live and that's terrible
[1:23:12] because it's a mockery of this that's
[1:23:15] what that is it's not just an evil
[1:23:17] Theory um by the way men behave or or
[1:23:21] women behave human beings behave because
[1:23:23] they're under the influence of a spirit
[1:23:25] it's absolutely a mockery of what Jesus
[1:23:27] Christ the word made flesh spoke when he
[1:23:30] stood on Earth there was only one that
[1:23:33] were supposed to eat his flesh and drink
[1:23:35] his blood but brother bradam he brought
[1:23:37] it and said you know these Ultra
[1:23:39] religious in his day they were stuck in
[1:23:42] their traditions and they couldn't
[1:23:43] recognize the the one who stood before
[1:23:46] them they couldn't understand it because
[1:23:49] they were stuck in their ways and we
[1:23:51] know that that corner was turned but
[1:23:53] when he was standing right there he said
[1:23:55] that for a reason brother Brandon brings
[1:23:57] it out he says he did it for the reason
[1:23:59] that he needed to thin the people out
[1:24:01] because there's some people that are
[1:24:02] going to get the perfect realization of
[1:24:05] the revelation of the word and there's
[1:24:07] some people that won't and those people
[1:24:09] who will will get it and I remember
[1:24:12] thinking when I first started coming to
[1:24:14] the message church this is kind of
[1:24:16] strange there's a lot of profit there's
[1:24:19] a lot of Eagle there's a lot of cloud
[1:24:21] there's a lot of mystery there's seals
[1:24:23] there's all these different things that
[1:24:25] are kind of strange and had me scratch
[1:24:27] in my head wondering what what what is
[1:24:29] it all about but I knew in my heart even
[1:24:33] though I couldn't understand it at the
[1:24:35] time there is something about
[1:24:38] it and that's where I want to say to
[1:24:40] anyone today if you've got any doubt
[1:24:42] about this don't say anything about it
[1:24:46] just say I don't understand it and if
[1:24:49] you would like to understand it ask God
[1:24:51] himself to reveal it to you because
[1:24:54] takes someone with that kind of power to
[1:24:57] reveal it we can only talk about it but
[1:24:59] it takes God to reveal it but when he
[1:25:02] reveals it we become perfected with that
[1:25:06] perfect realization it's such a
[1:25:08] beautiful thing I just love it out of
[1:25:11] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:25:13] in the Philadelphian Church age brother
[1:25:15] brandham he says this oh I am so glad
[1:25:18] that my Holiness is not of myself how
[1:25:21] many people could say that this morning
[1:25:23] I am so glad glad that my Holiness is
[1:25:26] not of myself I am glad I am in
[1:25:31] Christ but not just in Christ I am in
[1:25:36] Christ with all his wonderful attributes
[1:25:39] of righteousness imputed yay imparted
[1:25:44] unto me blessed be God
[1:25:49] forever these things saith he that is
[1:25:51] true now this word is true it's a very
[1:25:55] wonderful word it does not mean true in
[1:25:59] just the sense that it is opposite to
[1:26:02] false it expresses the perfect
[1:26:06] realization of an
[1:26:08] idea as contrasted with its partial
[1:26:13] realization for example we recall that
[1:26:16] Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you
[1:26:19] not that bread from heaven but my father
[1:26:22] giveth you the true bread from
[1:26:27] Heaven excuse me John 151 I am the True
[1:26:30] Vine Hebrews 9:24 for Christ has not
[1:26:33] entered into the holy places made with
[1:26:36] hands which are the figures of the true
[1:26:40] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[1:26:43] the presence of God for
[1:26:45] US 1 John 2:8 because the darkness is
[1:26:48] passed and the True Light now shineth
[1:26:51] since this word indeed expresses perfect
[1:26:53] real realization against the idea of
[1:26:56] partial realization as Illustrated in
[1:26:59] these verses we can Now understand as
[1:27:02] never before antitype contrast with type
[1:27:04] and substance with Shadow take the
[1:27:07] example now of Mana from Heaven God sent
[1:27:09] down Angel bread from heaven for Israel
[1:27:13] but that bread did not
[1:27:15] satisfy it was only good for a
[1:27:18] day those who ate it were hungry again
[1:27:21] the next day if it was left around it
[1:27:24] became
[1:27:25] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:27:27] from Heaven I love
[1:27:30] that whereof Mana was just a type and if
[1:27:34] any man eats that bread that came from
[1:27:37] Heaven he will never hunger again he
[1:27:40] does not need to come back and eat again
[1:27:43] the moment he
[1:27:44] partook he had eternal life here indeed
[1:27:48] was reality you no longer you need no
[1:27:53] need any longer for a shadow no need for
[1:27:57] a partial
[1:27:58] salvation here is the whole of it just
[1:28:02] like Jesus isn't a part of God he is
[1:28:08] God just love this this this this I love
[1:28:11] the message don't you just amazing how
[1:28:15] how clear it becomes we we don't need a
[1:28:17] shadow anymore we don't need to have a
[1:28:19] mystery anymore we don't need to have
[1:28:21] types anymore even though we do teach
[1:28:23] and preach from them we we we we try and
[1:28:27] impart the reality of the word of God to
[1:28:30] each and every one of us and we know
[1:28:31] that that word in our day is Jesus
[1:28:33] Christ that word is the perfect
[1:28:36] realization of what the message of the
[1:28:39] hour actually is the reason that God
[1:28:42] sent us a prophet in the day in which we
[1:28:44] live is for the perfect
[1:28:48] realization I would like to get
[1:28:51] into talking a little bit about our
[1:28:54] scripture in First
[1:28:55] Corinthians just just looking at it
[1:28:58] through the lens of the realization the
[1:29:01] perfect realization about who we are if
[1:29:05] we could just read this this chapter
[1:29:07] here I know it's a lot of reading but we
[1:29:09] still got a bit of time and what better
[1:29:11] thing to to do than just read the word
[1:29:14] of God Amen but in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:29:18] 2 Paul speaking to the Corinthian Church
[1:29:21] here and he says and I Brethren when I
[1:29:23] came to you came not with Excellency of
[1:29:26] speech or
[1:29:28] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:29:31] of God for I determined not to know
[1:29:35] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[1:29:38] him
[1:29:39] crucified now remember
[1:29:42] Paul was trained up under Gia wasn't he
[1:29:46] he was a Hebrew of Hebrew amen he was an
[1:29:50] Israeli he was a Jew he understood the
[1:29:53] word like not many people did in his day
[1:29:56] he
[1:29:58] was I would say a Pharisee and a
[1:30:00] sadducee all in one he knew the word of
[1:30:03] God and and and he came not with the
[1:30:07] Excellency of speech what he saying here
[1:30:10] many times we can look at it and and
[1:30:12] read it and just maybe gloss over it
[1:30:14] this is a man that actually really
[1:30:16] understood the law and we know that the
[1:30:20] scholars from that day I wonder if Paul
[1:30:22] would have been part of that group we've
[1:30:24] heard it said that you could roll the
[1:30:26] scroll they knew it so well that they
[1:30:29] could pierce the scroll through with a
[1:30:31] pin and then open the scroll before they
[1:30:34] opened it they could tell you exactly
[1:30:36] what scripture was pierced that's how
[1:30:39] well they knew it I wonder if Paul was a
[1:30:42] part of that group and I Brethren when I
[1:30:45] came to you came not with Excellency of
[1:30:48] speech or of wisdom all the eloquence
[1:30:51] and all my training was out the door
[1:30:54] amen declaring unto you the testimony of
[1:30:56] God for I determin not to know anything
[1:30:59] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:31:02] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[1:31:05] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[1:31:08] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:31:12] enticing words of man's Wisdom but a
[1:31:16] demonstration of spirit and Empower
[1:31:19] isn't that
[1:31:21] wonderful that your faith
[1:31:24] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:31:28] but in the power of
[1:31:29] God and you know brothers and sisters
[1:31:32] today I think that's probably one of the
[1:31:33] most important things that I feel led to
[1:31:36] talk about is to make sure that our
[1:31:38] faith is not standing in the wisdom of
[1:31:43] men sometimes we can have favorite
[1:31:46] Ministry sometimes we can have a
[1:31:48] favorite
[1:31:49] Pastor sometimes we can have our ideas
[1:31:54] but let's not let our ideas Fall upon
[1:31:57] men because if we do that we're going to
[1:32:01] actually go
[1:32:03] astray our faith should not stand in the
[1:32:06] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:32:10] and the only way we're going to see the
[1:32:12] power of God manifest in our lives is to
[1:32:14] put his word first his word has got to
[1:32:17] go first that is the
[1:32:20] Paramount how be it we speak wisdom
[1:32:23] among them that are perfect isn't that
[1:32:26] beautiful it's almost contradictory to
[1:32:29] the the scripture that he said there in
[1:32:30] verse 5 that your faith should not stand
[1:32:33] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:32:34] God how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:32:38] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[1:32:41] this world nor of the princes of this
[1:32:43] world that come to not but we speak the
[1:32:46] wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[1:32:49] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:32:52] the world
[1:32:54] unto our
[1:32:55] Glory there has to be someone that is
[1:32:58] able to understand this
[1:33:00] mystery and I think it's so beautiful
[1:33:02] it's the mystery of who we
[1:33:05] are the Tabernacle not made with
[1:33:09] hands the Tabernacle that God has chosen
[1:33:13] we know in the in the Old Testament
[1:33:14] there's the Tabernacle that was made in
[1:33:16] the wilderness and for the sin of the
[1:33:18] people God went through all of the
[1:33:21] instruction to build the Tabernacle and
[1:33:23] very specific instructions on how to
[1:33:25] build the instruments in the Tabernacle
[1:33:27] in the tent how to weave everything
[1:33:29] together all the Skins the colors of the
[1:33:32] Skins all of the very specific details
[1:33:35] on how to create the Ark of the Covenant
[1:33:37] and the and the holes for the the staves
[1:33:40] to fit through and how it should be made
[1:33:42] out of that type of wood shittum wood I
[1:33:44] think it's called and then how it should
[1:33:45] be overlaid with gold inside and out and
[1:33:49] and how it should bear the testimony of
[1:33:51] the word of God inside it but there
[1:33:54] should also be Angels on the top with
[1:33:56] their wings facing in so that he would
[1:33:58] actually call that The Mercy Seat that
[1:34:00] he would rest above the word for his day
[1:34:04] all of the very specific instruction was
[1:34:07] given to them to have a place for the
[1:34:10] Lord and here we are today brothers and
[1:34:12] sisters we've just been freely given
[1:34:14] that position and all we have to do is
[1:34:16] surrender it back to him and he will
[1:34:19] come and abide in The Mercy Seat of our
[1:34:23] heart am I think it's so beautiful how
[1:34:25] brother Bram brought it out in the 60s
[1:34:27] to say maybe it was the 50s but he
[1:34:29] brought it out to say in his ministry
[1:34:31] that science has proven that there is a
[1:34:33] teeny little space in the heart of a
[1:34:35] human and there isn't that space in any
[1:34:37] other animal in creation why is that he
[1:34:40] said it was the space for the
[1:34:44] soul and that's the only thing that
[1:34:46] God's interested in so I want to say
[1:34:48] this out of all of the glory that man
[1:34:50] was instructed to create in the
[1:34:52] wilderness in the Tabernacle and the
[1:34:54] gold and Angels the cherubims to Bear
[1:34:56] their wings and and to have that
[1:34:57] beautiful mercy seat behind the veil
[1:35:00] where only the high priest could go into
[1:35:02] that that sacred place he's put in the
[1:35:05] heart of every single human
[1:35:07] being and alls we have to do now through
[1:35:10] the revelation of the word for our day
[1:35:12] through the perfect realization is just
[1:35:14] open that little tiny space in our heart
[1:35:17] and say Lord be it unto me according to
[1:35:19] Thy word come and fill that space in
[1:35:22] that little void it's in my heart and
[1:35:25] isn't it amazing when we look around in
[1:35:26] this world that that tiny little space
[1:35:28] could be so thirsty so
[1:35:32] hungry drive people to act so crazy what
[1:35:36] we would say crazy to chase alcohol to
[1:35:39] chase women to chase money to chase all
[1:35:43] the fame and stuff that this world would
[1:35:45] do to chase Sports all of these things
[1:35:48] that people do in this world that teeny
[1:35:51] little space in the heart is what's
[1:35:53] driving them
[1:35:54] they're thirsting they're thirsting for
[1:35:56] the things of the Lord and they don't
[1:35:57] even know
[1:35:59] it but here we are we know it and we're
[1:36:02] so thankful that we can fill it with the
[1:36:04] right
[1:36:06] things whoa my verse seven but we speak
[1:36:10] the wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[1:36:12] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:36:15] the world unto our Glory which none of
[1:36:18] the princes of this world knew for had
[1:36:20] they known it they would not have
[1:36:22] crucified the Lord of Glory they would
[1:36:25] not have done it because then we
[1:36:27] wouldn't have salvation would
[1:36:29] we but as it is written eye hath Not
[1:36:32] Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it
[1:36:34] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:36:36] which God hath prepared for them that
[1:36:38] love
[1:36:39] him but I just love this next verse
[1:36:41] because if we just looked at verse n i i
[1:36:44] I looked at it for years and thought my
[1:36:46] there's such a wonderful place that we
[1:36:47] just will never know about until we
[1:36:49] cross over and true indeed much of it we
[1:36:51] won't know about but isn't it
[1:36:53] interesting that verse 10 says but God
[1:36:55] hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:36:59] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[1:37:02] the Deep things of
[1:37:06] God maybe why wise brother Barry gets so
[1:37:08] excited when he reads that because I
[1:37:10] think you know brother Bram he tells the
[1:37:12] vision about when he went beyond the
[1:37:13] curtain of time amen didn't he and
[1:37:16] that's no different from Paul we talked
[1:37:17] about that maybe uh last year or
[1:37:20] somewhere along the way that Paul he was
[1:37:21] caught up into heaven
[1:37:24] and he heard unspeakable words that he
[1:37:26] was wasn't lawful for him to repeat but
[1:37:29] yet in our day our Prophet was caught up
[1:37:32] into heaven and he actually came back
[1:37:34] with a report didn't
[1:37:36] he he came back with a report saying
[1:37:38] that everyone was in perfect health
[1:37:41] everyone was
[1:37:43] happy everyone was actually about 20
[1:37:46] years
[1:37:48] old and everyone had the same idea of
[1:37:52] the faith
[1:37:54] because he said can I see Jesus and the
[1:37:57] voice said to him no he's a little
[1:37:59] higher you can't see him yet and he said
[1:38:03] well yeah I can't remember I'm getting
[1:38:06] mixed up now but Paul he said does Paul
[1:38:09] have to be judged for what he taught and
[1:38:11] they said yep and he said well I preach
[1:38:14] what Paul preached and all of those
[1:38:16] voices that were there who were his
[1:38:18] converts in the vision what did they say
[1:38:21] they said we're resting on that
[1:38:25] this isn't a mystery brothers and
[1:38:26] sisters God hath revealed them unto us
[1:38:30] by his
[1:38:31] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:38:33] things yeay the Deep things of God for
[1:38:35] what a man knoweth for what man knoweth
[1:38:39] the things of man save the spirit of man
[1:38:41] which is in him even so the things of
[1:38:44] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[1:38:49] and I I just think it's so just dovet
[1:38:51] tales with what we've said and we'll
[1:38:52] continue to say you know we have got to
[1:38:54] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost In
[1:38:57] Our Lives now some people might get
[1:38:59] upset when they hear me say that again
[1:39:01] but brothers and sisters we're in a one
[1:39:03] room Schoolhouse we heard that a long
[1:39:05] time ago there's some people that are
[1:39:07] old veterans grandmas and grandpas of
[1:39:09] the message of the hour will call them
[1:39:10] they've had the Holy Ghost for so long
[1:39:12] and I just can't help but think of that
[1:39:14] story where brother Bram says to that
[1:39:15] sister sister how long has it been since
[1:39:18] you've had the Holy Ghost and she says
[1:39:20] bless God I remember I've had the Holy
[1:39:22] Ghost way back when I don't know the
[1:39:24] exact date but she never got upset why
[1:39:27] would anybody get upset when you talk
[1:39:29] about the Holy Ghost we should be able
[1:39:31] to say it loud and clear have ye
[1:39:33] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:39:35] believe since you call yourself a
[1:39:37] Believer have you got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:40] brothers and sisters I want to say it
[1:39:42] today if we can't say I know I got the
[1:39:44] Holy Ghost I think there's a little bit
[1:39:46] of work to do maybe not a lot alls it is
[1:39:50] is surrender open that little space in
[1:39:52] your heart that he created for himself
[1:39:54] and say Lord I want that Holy Ghost for
[1:39:57] myself I'm tired of looking around and
[1:39:59] seeing all the other people having the
[1:40:01] joy I'm tired of seeing all the other
[1:40:03] people having the victory in their lives
[1:40:05] bring some to me Lord the only way it
[1:40:08] happens is with surrender though full
[1:40:11] complete surrender say God if your God
[1:40:13] be my
[1:40:16] God and I promise you if you're honest
[1:40:20] he will
[1:40:21] be you know I was so thankful I was I
[1:40:24] was sharing with my friend I hope it's
[1:40:26] okay just a little bit of my testimony
[1:40:28] you know when I came into this message
[1:40:30] when I came 2005 July 27 I I came to an
[1:40:35] upper room and I I can say I had an
[1:40:37] upper room
[1:40:38] experience and I know we all can say
[1:40:40] that somewhere along the way in our
[1:40:41] lives but the Lord just made it so vivid
[1:40:43] so real to me and and you know what we
[1:40:45] can only deal with the way the Lord has
[1:40:47] spoke to us and that's my testimony and
[1:40:50] I just have to express it the way that
[1:40:51] he's given it to me but you know I I
[1:40:53] went into that upper room as a full-time
[1:40:56] smoker I went into that upper room as an
[1:40:59] alcoholic I was at the place in my life
[1:41:01] where I didn't know how to deal with
[1:41:02] either one because both of those had a
[1:41:05] grip of my life they were being used to
[1:41:08] try and fill that teeny little void in
[1:41:09] my heart and I had no idea what was
[1:41:12] going on why I was doing all of that and
[1:41:14] of course I'd heard it I had heard it
[1:41:17] I'd heard about Jesus I'd heard about
[1:41:18] how he died i' I grew up in Pentecost I
[1:41:22] heard about all that but wasn't real to
[1:41:24] me I never had a perfect
[1:41:27] realization I never had a revelation
[1:41:30] about it and you know I want to say this
[1:41:34] real clear too when I was in that
[1:41:36] service I I mentioned a little bit
[1:41:37] earlier I didn't understand that God
[1:41:39] sent a prophet I didn't understand all
[1:41:42] of the the the message theology all of
[1:41:44] the Mysteries and all of the stuff about
[1:41:47] it but what I did know is there was a
[1:41:50] God and I did know that through the
[1:41:52] words that were being spoken there was
[1:41:55] something different about this
[1:41:57] atmosphere there was something totally
[1:41:59] different than I'd ever heard in my life
[1:42:01] and you know what happened in that
[1:42:03] service was I just gave my heart to the
[1:42:05] Lord I I didn't have a prayer meeting
[1:42:07] there wasn't any lightning bolts or
[1:42:08] thunder the the walls never shook there
[1:42:11] was no visible signs there was no
[1:42:15] sensation but something
[1:42:18] happened in the moment in the twinkling
[1:42:20] of an eye I actually began to perceive
[1:42:23] that there was going to be a Rapture
[1:42:24] because what happened brothers and
[1:42:26] sisters was my body started to change I
[1:42:28] no longer craved cigarettes and I no
[1:42:30] longer drank both of those were gone in
[1:42:33] a twinkling of an
[1:42:34] eye they weren't gone because I went to
[1:42:37] God and said oh God I just can't stop
[1:42:39] smoking help me Lord I can't stop
[1:42:42] drinking oh I just can't stop doing this
[1:42:45] no no no that's not how the battle was
[1:42:46] won the battle was won with full
[1:42:50] Surrender by saying I'm tired of playing
[1:42:52] around
[1:42:53] I don't want a fake
[1:42:56] religion I want to know if there's a God
[1:42:59] and if there's a God be my
[1:43:02] God and I can tell you brothers and
[1:43:04] sisters whatever the problem is in your
[1:43:06] life if you got one just get real with
[1:43:08] God and see if he won't change your
[1:43:11] life you know we talked about this a
[1:43:14] while ago I think it's so beautiful the
[1:43:15] Rapture is a revelation brother Bram
[1:43:17] said this seventh angel messenger said
[1:43:20] the Rapture is a revelation the change
[1:43:21] of our bodies is a Revelation and you
[1:43:24] know when we see the body change it's
[1:43:26] only the final tiny little portion of
[1:43:29] what we've been going through all the
[1:43:30] way
[1:43:31] along because the word says let this
[1:43:35] mind that was in Christ be also in
[1:43:39] you so we begin to become his attributes
[1:43:43] our body begins to change we no longer
[1:43:46] try to fill that teeny little void in
[1:43:48] our hearts with all of the things of
[1:43:49] this world
[1:43:53] what happens is we get the right food we
[1:43:57] understand that there's a right way and
[1:43:59] when we actually repent we say Lord I
[1:44:02] know I'm a sinner I was born in sin I
[1:44:05] was shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:44:06] speaking Lies when we do that then we
[1:44:09] actually surrender our life to him then
[1:44:11] he can come in and begin to change our
[1:44:13] bodies isn't that what he does he
[1:44:15] changes our
[1:44:16] bodies he gives us a body change right
[1:44:19] here and and all that happens is we just
[1:44:23] get more and more and more changed I
[1:44:25] can't help but think about brother
[1:44:26] meno's dream that he told about seeing
[1:44:28] his sister I think it was his sister and
[1:44:30] what happened was he wound up just
[1:44:32] taking steps and he was going higher and
[1:44:34] higher and higher and high isn't that
[1:44:36] the life of a
[1:44:37] Christian whoever the oldest one in the
[1:44:39] building is I I would say this as a
[1:44:42] believer of the word of God are you the
[1:44:45] same person you were
[1:44:48] yesterday you're continually changing
[1:44:50] we're always changing conforming to the
[1:44:52] word word but not just conforming as the
[1:44:55] world says conforming we are actually
[1:44:58] being
[1:44:59] transformed by the word it's not us
[1:45:02] that's doing it but God has revealed
[1:45:06] them unto us by his Spirit verse 10 for
[1:45:08] the spirit searcheth all things yay the
[1:45:10] Deep things of God so if we don't have
[1:45:12] the spirit of God if we don't know that
[1:45:14] we got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives how
[1:45:16] are we ever going to understand the
[1:45:17] message of the hour it's only going to
[1:45:20] be the wisdom of man that's all it will
[1:45:22] ever be
[1:45:23] will become a message Theologian and
[1:45:26] that will be that and you know that
[1:45:28] ain't enough to take us in the
[1:45:30] Rapture that's why I'm talking the way
[1:45:32] I'm talking brothers and sisters it's
[1:45:33] not to try and belittle anybody for
[1:45:35] knowing a lot about the message of the
[1:45:37] hour I want to say do you know the
[1:45:38] author of the message of the hour do you
[1:45:41] know the god of William Mariam
[1:45:45] brandham because you have to it's not
[1:45:48] optional amen William bradam never came
[1:45:51] to Calvary
[1:45:54] though there's a deity spirit that wants
[1:45:55] to get people down that road of
[1:45:57] believing that he did
[1:45:59] somehow uhuh no way no no no verse 11
[1:46:05] for what man knoweth the things of man
[1:46:06] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:46:09] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:46:13] but the spirit of God my now we have
[1:46:17] received not the spirit of the
[1:46:20] world but the spirit which is of of
[1:46:23] God so I want to say this brothers and
[1:46:26] sisters if that's where we find
[1:46:29] ourselves what do people see when they
[1:46:31] see
[1:46:32] us are we are we are we advertising the
[1:46:35] Lord Jesus Christ or are we advertising
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:38] world and our lives demonstrate who we
[1:46:42] are our lives show the life that we're
[1:46:46] living verse 13 says which things also
[1:46:49] we speak not in The Words which man
[1:46:53] wisdom teacheth but with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:56] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:46:59] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:47:02] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:47:04] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:47:06] can he know them because they are
[1:47:09] spiritually discerned that's the only
[1:47:11] way we can understand what's being
[1:47:13] preached brothers and sisters is by the
[1:47:15] Holy Ghost In Our Lives now many times
[1:47:18] things can be spoken from the pulpit or
[1:47:20] from a tape when we're playing it or
[1:47:22] even just in conversation where you're
[1:47:24] pouring from cup to vessel to vessel
[1:47:26] right where you're fellowshipping around
[1:47:27] the word the Lord speaks to us but the
[1:47:30] only way that we can perceive it is to
[1:47:32] have his
[1:47:33] Spirit otherwise we'll be one of those
[1:47:35] people that goes to church and say I
[1:47:37] never got nothing in fact he called me a
[1:47:40] crow and others will go and be like
[1:47:43] Hallelujah glory to God I heard from my
[1:47:45] theophany I know that I'm an eagle cuz
[1:47:48] I'm not walking out of here I'm flying
[1:47:50] out of here depends on which spirit you
[1:47:53] got in you there's two Spirits the Holy
[1:47:55] Spirit and the Antichrist spirit and we
[1:47:58] know that brother bradam said the
[1:47:59] Antichrist Spirit would creep into what
[1:48:02] framework of the Christian church and
[1:48:04] cause it to become
[1:48:06] lukewarm formal oh my don't be shouting
[1:48:10] now don't be getting too excited keep it
[1:48:12] down I came here I just want to be able
[1:48:15] to
[1:48:17] hear and
[1:48:19] Powerless powerless powerless when the
[1:48:22] Devil comes around and tries to shake
[1:48:24] Our Lives Shake our existence we'll be
[1:48:27] powerless to deal with them don't let
[1:48:30] that anyti Christ Spirit creep into the
[1:48:31] framework of your church brothers and
[1:48:33] sisters I want to say it this way don't
[1:48:35] look at this building and call it the
[1:48:36] church look at that little teeny little
[1:48:38] spot on the inside of the heart because
[1:48:40] that's where that Antichrist spirit's
[1:48:42] going to creep into but if you got the
[1:48:44] Holy Spirit ain't no Spirit getting in
[1:48:46] there that's the strong man oh my the
[1:48:50] bad guy's going to come and try and kick
[1:48:52] down the door inside that that that spot
[1:48:55] but he's not going to have any
[1:48:56] opportunity when their eyes were open
[1:48:58] they knew him
[1:49:00] 1964
[1:49:02] 0212 don't stand and look at it and try
[1:49:05] to figure it out like the Pharisees said
[1:49:09] they stood and looked at him there and
[1:49:11] said this man is beah they had to try
[1:49:13] and classify him according to their
[1:49:15] knowledge according to their wisdom the
[1:49:16] teaching of man's Wisdom right the
[1:49:19] enticing words of man's Wisdom they had
[1:49:21] to put a classification on him your
[1:49:23] Oneness your Tess what what are you
[1:49:25] where'd you come from where where
[1:49:26] where'd you get your your ticket from
[1:49:28] who's your parents right and if they
[1:49:30] can't do that then automatically you
[1:49:32] become devilish my this man is be elub
[1:49:36] they couldn't figure it out they had to
[1:49:38] give it a name they said this man does
[1:49:41] this by the spirit of the devil can you
[1:49:43] imagine that we know that's why he said
[1:49:47] I'll forgive you now cuz you don't know
[1:49:50] but let me tell you something when my
[1:49:52] Holy Spirit comes around when when I
[1:49:54] give you what I'm going to go through
[1:49:56] I'm going to have my body split broken
[1:49:58] spit on punched kicked totally
[1:50:01] humiliated
[1:50:03] destroyed so that I can impart my spirit
[1:50:05] back on you you say one word against my
[1:50:09] spirit on any one of the little ones and
[1:50:10] it would be better that a millstone was
[1:50:12] hung around your neck and you were
[1:50:13] drowned in the depths of the ocean
[1:50:17] my this man is be elub they couldn't
[1:50:19] figure it out they had to give it a name
[1:50:22] they said this man does this by the
[1:50:24] spirit of the devil he is a Beelzebub a
[1:50:27] fortune teller I don't have nothing to
[1:50:30] do with this fellow can you imagine that
[1:50:33] don't have nothing to do with this guy
[1:50:35] he was born in sin he don't have our
[1:50:38] fellowship
[1:50:40] cards what does that have to do with
[1:50:42] being born in sin right many times it's
[1:50:45] like that though oh my where did he
[1:50:47] where did he come from that guy came
[1:50:48] from out in the world he must be a a
[1:50:51] terrible individual he was wasn't born
[1:50:53] in the message right don't go there
[1:50:55] brothers and sisters I got a quote for
[1:50:57] it but I'm not going to bring it today
[1:50:58] brother bradam he says it there's
[1:51:00] something wrong with your experience
[1:51:01] when you start doing that when we start
[1:51:03] judging people that way there's
[1:51:05] something wrong with
[1:51:07] us well I don't have nothing to do with
[1:51:09] this fellow he was born in sin he don't
[1:51:12] have our fellowship cards he doesn't
[1:51:14] belong to us and oh
[1:51:16] my they don't even know where he went to
[1:51:18] school at he has no
[1:51:21] education why
[1:51:23] well where did this man come
[1:51:26] from now he says the son of man that's
[1:51:28] going to ascend up descended down he was
[1:51:31] born right here he's crazy unless you
[1:51:35] eat the Flesh of the son of man drink
[1:51:37] his blood he's a cannibal and he did
[1:51:41] that just to make them say those things
[1:51:44] can you imagine
[1:51:45] that that wasn't just a man standing
[1:51:48] there it wasn't just a third person of
[1:51:50] the Trinity either it was God he he
[1:51:54] could discern their thoughts he knew
[1:51:56] exactly what was going on they had to do
[1:51:59] it he says and so is the Holy Ghost
[1:52:03] today putting forth his word in
[1:52:06] manifestation that men might condemn it
[1:52:09] I say Lord have
[1:52:13] mercy that God might put his judgment
[1:52:16] upon the Earth as he promised he would
[1:52:20] do now just remember brothers and
[1:52:22] sisters we we could easily say yeah Lord
[1:52:23] pour it out man there's some people that
[1:52:26] are pretty bad but remember brother
[1:52:28] bradam he said it he said it very
[1:52:31] clearly the ones who actually were the
[1:52:33] souls under the altar that were crying
[1:52:36] how long oh Lord holy and true do you
[1:52:40] not come and avenge our blood and he
[1:52:43] says you know what you must rest a
[1:52:45] little season until your fellow Brethren
[1:52:48] are killed like you were also and he
[1:52:50] gives them all a white robe he gives
[1:52:52] them all eternal life he gives it to
[1:52:55] them and tells them to just rest for a
[1:52:56] little season brother Brandon brings it
[1:52:58] out very clearly and says that those
[1:53:00] people under the altar were the Jews
[1:53:02] because the
[1:53:03] Gentile cries out for Mercy for the
[1:53:06] Brethren the Jew cries out for
[1:53:12] vengeance there's a
[1:53:13] difference we could be saying
[1:53:16] Lord have
[1:53:18] mercy bless their
[1:53:21] hearts we could good but there's
[1:53:23] something different in in that little
[1:53:25] teeny space of the heart of a True
[1:53:26] Believer isn't there we want to see
[1:53:29] Mercy we want to see grace we want to
[1:53:31] see eternal life part imparted to the
[1:53:33] people in this world we recognize we
[1:53:36] recognize what's going to happen
[1:53:38] millions and billions of people are
[1:53:41] going to
[1:53:42] perish and not just in this world not
[1:53:46] just laying down their flesh we're not
[1:53:48] saying that about about some sort of a
[1:53:50] war or some sort of a uh maybe an event
[1:53:52] that's going to take place maybe an
[1:53:53] asteroid's going to hit the earth I'm
[1:53:55] just throwing stuff out there brothers
[1:53:56] and sisters I'm not saying it's going to
[1:53:58] happen but you know if something like
[1:53:59] that did happen there' be millions and
[1:54:00] billions of people that would probably
[1:54:02] lose their lives over
[1:54:04] time but we're not talking about that in
[1:54:06] this flesh we're talking about eternity
[1:54:08] that great white Throne judgment that
[1:54:10] we've talked about that Daniel saw that
[1:54:13] John saw where people stood before that
[1:54:17] Throne all of the great people of this
[1:54:19] world death hell the grave the sea
[1:54:22] everyone had to give up the dead that
[1:54:24] were in them to go and stand before that
[1:54:26] white Throne of judgment oh
[1:54:30] my it's it's shocking to think about
[1:54:33] it's going to happen some people might
[1:54:35] say well we'll just gamble on it we'll
[1:54:38] just see brother Barry we don't know
[1:54:41] nobody has ever gone over there and come
[1:54:43] back maybe not but I believe a prophet
[1:54:46] did and I believe he gave us a good
[1:54:49] report but we can exercise our ability
[1:54:53] to impart Grace to this world why would
[1:54:55] we want to push judgment my you hear
[1:54:59] people say oh Cannon F serpent seed
[1:55:04] foolish virgin at best who is that that
[1:55:08] makes that kind of a judgment brothers
[1:55:10] and sisters I'll say it this way forgive
[1:55:13] me for saying it someone's probably
[1:55:15] gonna Scorch me for it but I want to say
[1:55:18] this brothers and sisters I do believe
[1:55:19] this it's either the Antichrist Spirit
[1:55:20] that's going to talk that way or it's
[1:55:22] God
[1:55:23] God those are the only ones that are
[1:55:25] going to speak that
[1:55:27] way he promised he would do he hardened
[1:55:31] the heart of pharaoh Hallelujah he is
[1:55:33] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:55:35] changes not he is God his systems of
[1:55:38] doing things shows himself Mighty in his
[1:55:41] word to manifest it he don't have to
[1:55:43] tell you all about it you don't have to
[1:55:46] figure it
[1:55:48] out you can't figure it out you got to
[1:55:51] accept it and this is what the
[1:55:53] Vindicated Prophet said he said just
[1:55:55] invite him in and see what happens if
[1:55:59] anybody here today has any doubts I
[1:56:01] would say just do exactly what he said
[1:56:04] push aside everything you think you know
[1:56:06] and just allow him just invite him in
[1:56:09] all the way and see what happens
[1:56:12] guarantee you you'll see results the
[1:56:15] voice of the sign 1964 brother Bram he
[1:56:18] says and notice when he did one day he
[1:56:20] began to speak to the people and he said
[1:56:23] excuse me unless you eat the Flesh of
[1:56:25] the son of man and drink his blood there
[1:56:26] is no life what would the doctors say
[1:56:29] about
[1:56:30] that now he never explained it I just
[1:56:34] love that how he never explained it how
[1:56:36] important is it for us brothers and
[1:56:38] sisters not to be able to explain every
[1:56:40] single thing not to be able to
[1:56:43] understand every single thing if we
[1:56:44] could do that it wouldn't take Faith
[1:56:46] then all the theologians would be Leaps
[1:56:48] and Bounds ahead of most of us right
[1:56:52] because they could learn their way into
[1:56:53] heaven and the same thing with the
[1:56:55] message of the hour if we can know every
[1:56:57] quote if we can memorize the entire
[1:56:59] message and all of the the message
[1:57:01] theology if we understood all of that
[1:57:03] and memorized it all there would be no
[1:57:06] faith
[1:57:07] involved but it's not up to us to
[1:57:10] understand it it's only up to us to
[1:57:12] believe it and when we believe it what
[1:57:15] happens this is what the Paradox is it's
[1:57:18] very strange but it's true when we
[1:57:20] simply believe it first then he reveals
[1:57:23] it to us second then we come to the
[1:57:25] place where we get the Revelation about
[1:57:27] what he's talking about we get the
[1:57:29] Revelation about what it means to have
[1:57:31] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives the perfect
[1:57:35] realization of who we
[1:57:38] are except you eat the Flesh of the son
[1:57:40] of man and drink his blood there is no
[1:57:42] life what would the doctor say about
[1:57:44] that now he never explained it he he
[1:57:46] never did say any he he just come for so
[1:57:49] many them that he forew he come he said
[1:57:53] no man can come except my father draws
[1:57:57] him and all the father has given me they
[1:58:00] will understand it they'll come see
[1:58:02] they'll come they'll understand it the
[1:58:05] one my father has given me those names
[1:58:08] is on the book of life he come to redeem
[1:58:12] them now we know we are talking about
[1:58:14] the Book of Life studying it in the
[1:58:15] exposition of the seven Church ages just
[1:58:17] a tremendous study out of the sardian
[1:58:20] church age just fantastic and I I
[1:58:22] believe we're going to preach on that
[1:58:24] but maybe just a little bit right now
[1:58:25] even there's one book and a couple
[1:58:28] different portions of that book and
[1:58:31] there's people's names that are on that
[1:58:32] book before the foundation of the world
[1:58:34] people's names that aren't on that book
[1:58:37] people's names that are in the book of
[1:58:39] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:58:41] the world those names can never be
[1:58:43] changed in the Book of Life the rest of
[1:58:45] the volume those names can be added or
[1:58:47] deleted it's not up to us to do it it's
[1:58:50] up to us to recognize where our name
[1:58:53] is and I know I remember a brother
[1:58:55] really torn up just ripped from end to
[1:58:59] end because he could not understand how
[1:59:01] his name that he knew that he knew that
[1:59:04] he knew that his name was in the Lamb's
[1:59:05] Book of Life the book of the lamb slain
[1:59:07] before the foundation of the world is
[1:59:09] the way it's written in the Bible we
[1:59:10] typically refer to it as the Lamb's Book
[1:59:12] of Life same book as The Book of Life
[1:59:15] just a different chapter in the same
[1:59:17] book that same book that John saw in the
[1:59:20] hand of him that sat upon the throne and
[1:59:22] we know that John heard the voice that
[1:59:24] said is there anybody worthy to take
[1:59:26] that book out of the hand of him that
[1:59:28] sits on the throne and John what did he
[1:59:31] do he wept greatly because they searched
[1:59:33] all of Heaven they searched all of Earth
[1:59:36] they searched under the Earth they
[1:59:38] probably went into all of the future
[1:59:40] they probably went into all of the past
[1:59:42] they went every single place they could
[1:59:44] possibly go looking for one
[1:59:48] worthy but then John saw the lamb Oh my
[1:59:53] he saw the lamb come and take that book
[1:59:55] and open it didn't he and that lamb he
[1:59:59] actually gave the book to John just such
[2:00:01] a beautiful thing going off topic here
[2:00:03] but we know that there is a portion of
[2:00:05] that book with our names written in it
[2:00:08] and how are we ever going to know that
[2:00:09] our name is written there brothers and
[2:00:11] sisters it has to be revealed to us we
[2:00:14] can't find our name written there he has
[2:00:16] to reveal it to us but when he does
[2:00:20] reveal it to us then we come to that
[2:00:22] place where I believe a brother has said
[2:00:24] it recently I don't know who said it uh
[2:00:26] it's simple that when we read the Bible
[2:00:28] we know brother bradam said that we need
[2:00:29] to be able to see Jesus Christ in every
[2:00:31] scripture every verse every line of the
[2:00:33] Bible every time we read it we should be
[2:00:35] able to see Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[2:00:37] Jesus Christ as we read it and if we
[2:00:39] can't then we need to go back and read
[2:00:41] it again keep doing it until we can find
[2:00:43] it but then I think it goes a little bit
[2:00:45] further brothers and sisters and I'm by
[2:00:46] no means trying to correct the prophet
[2:00:49] the Vindicated prophet in our day but I
[2:00:50] believe he brought a message that gives
[2:00:52] us the ability to say I can see my name
[2:00:55] written in that book I can see my name
[2:00:57] written in that book when he talks about
[2:00:59] us oh my I'm I'm so glad that I can say
[2:01:03] I'm one of them and how am I one of them
[2:01:04] it's by
[2:01:06] Revelation the perfect realization of
[2:01:08] this word that was given to us in the
[2:01:11] day in which we live to call me to bring
[2:01:13] forth my sacred portion my tiny little
[2:01:17] piece of my heart oh which is the
[2:01:19] greatest treasure that ever was placed
[2:01:21] upon on this Earth to give it to the
[2:01:24] Lord Jesus Christ even though he gave it
[2:01:26] to me I can just give it back to him and
[2:01:29] say Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[2:01:31] word and you know what happens
[2:01:33] pregnation happens there comes a point
[2:01:36] in time where that teeny little spot in
[2:01:37] the heart of a human being can just no
[2:01:39] longer contain that little Revelation
[2:01:41] that's in there oh my and it just starts
[2:01:43] to live out through the rest of our body
[2:01:45] doesn't it it changes the way we walk it
[2:01:48] changes the way we talk it changes the
[2:01:50] way we think amen talking to a brother
[2:01:53] recently you know we have thoughts we we
[2:01:55] have the devil coming around and
[2:01:57] sprinkling thoughts in our mind about
[2:01:59] the way a Brother's thinking about us
[2:02:01] and what we do we take those thoughts
[2:02:03] and we just put them into captivity and
[2:02:05] we say no I know that brother's not like
[2:02:06] that he wouldn't be that way that's not
[2:02:08] what he's thinking about me that's the
[2:02:11] devil sometimes we can do that about
[2:02:13] parents sometimes we can do that about
[2:02:15] spouses sometimes we can do that about
[2:02:18] pastors just allow the Lord brothers and
[2:02:21] sisters to take every single thought in
[2:02:22] our lives into captivity and we'll see a
[2:02:25] different result the voice of the sign
[2:02:27] 1964 brother Adam says watch the word is
[2:02:30] always
[2:02:32] corrective the word is always
[2:02:34] corrective I think it's so beautiful I
[2:02:37] was reading the scripture this morning
[2:02:39] just so
[2:02:41] wonderful I'm I'm going to mess up the
[2:02:43] the name I think it was
[2:02:46] Manassa I could be wrong 12-year-old
[2:02:50] king of Israel
[2:02:52] and what happened he actually was risen
[2:02:56] up into that lineage and he became king
[2:02:58] of Israel and and he absolutely fell off
[2:03:04] the wagon so to speak and he absolutely
[2:03:08] went off the deepend and started to
[2:03:09] serve Idols carved an idol himself and
[2:03:13] placed it in the temple of God raised up
[2:03:16] the high places did all of the terrible
[2:03:19] sins that that that were possible in the
[2:03:22] land and what did God do God raised up
[2:03:24] his enemy and he actually took him down
[2:03:26] into Babylon and said you need to repent
[2:03:29] you need to correct and then what
[2:03:32] happened he responded to the correction
[2:03:34] of the word and God put him back God put
[2:03:39] him back but you know what happened was
[2:03:41] it was too late already because his
[2:03:43] children had been taught the erroneous
[2:03:46] ways and we know that his son raised up
[2:03:48] in his stead after he passed away and
[2:03:50] his son went right into to it right into
[2:03:52] sin we need to be careful 1964 the voice
[2:03:57] of the sign watch the word is always
[2:03:59] corrective Lord help me to surrender
[2:04:02] myself to the word to the correction of
[2:04:03] the word that little 12-year-old boy
[2:04:06] never knew a day in school as we know of
[2:04:09] just a child he never knowed it he said
[2:04:12] it perhaps but watch what he said know
[2:04:15] ye not that I must be about my father's
[2:04:19] business this is Jesus we're talking
[2:04:21] talking about here not the 12-year-old I
[2:04:23] was just referring to by the way for
[2:04:25] those who might be wondering brother
[2:04:27] Bram goes on to say and he is the word
[2:04:29] today he is the same yesterday today and
[2:04:32] forever I I just think that's the
[2:04:34] greatest the greatest scripture for me
[2:04:38] is is just to when I actually began to
[2:04:41] get the perfect realization of that
[2:04:43] Hebrews
[2:04:45] 138 such a familiar scripture brothers
[2:04:47] and sisters so many times we can just
[2:04:49] say it and it sounds good and we just
[2:04:51] gloss over it but if he is the same
[2:04:54] yesterday in the past today and forever
[2:04:58] if he doesn't change then all of his
[2:05:01] attributes are available to the True
[2:05:04] Believer every single one of his
[2:05:06] promises is still true
[2:05:09] today we don't have to look back and
[2:05:12] think wow was such a great ministry with
[2:05:13] a prophet I'm I'm I'm guilty I'd been
[2:05:16] there what would it have been like to
[2:05:17] stand before the prophet I remember the
[2:05:18] first time I heard there was a prophet
[2:05:20] and that he could discern the thoughts
[2:05:21] in the heart of a man I said I ain't
[2:05:22] never going to go near that guy cuz I
[2:05:24] know he's going to know who I am oh my
[2:05:28] if people knew who I was what I thought
[2:05:31] what I did blah blah blah I I would be a
[2:05:35] scoundrel I knew it
[2:05:38] right and and many people do know it but
[2:05:40] you know he is the same yesterday today
[2:05:42] and forever he's still calling he's
[2:05:45] still calling we have the ability to
[2:05:48] heed his voice it's such a tremendous
[2:05:51] thing that scripture is just so
[2:05:53] powerful and he is the word today he's
[2:05:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:05:57] know ye not if he had been about
[2:05:59] Joseph's
[2:06:00] business his dad Naturally Speaking the
[2:06:03] one who actually reared him up not the
[2:06:05] one who actually sired him for the
[2:06:07] record Joseph his dad who was married to
[2:06:11] Mary he'd have been making Carpenter
[2:06:15] business but he was about the father
[2:06:18] Heavenly father's business
[2:06:22] now we know what he's referring to here
[2:06:25] that they were in Jerusalem and and they
[2:06:27] were there and the whole Company of Mary
[2:06:30] and Joseph and the whole family and who
[2:06:33] knows how many people were with them but
[2:06:34] they left Jerusalem thinking that Jesus
[2:06:37] was there in the company one of the
[2:06:39] children running around a 12-year-old
[2:06:41] probably just on the verge of being a
[2:06:43] man and and they got three days journey
[2:06:45] down the road and and thought can you
[2:06:48] imagine the conversation Mary where's
[2:06:49] Joseph oh I don't have them I thought
[2:06:51] you had him no I don't have him where is
[2:06:54] he and they went back to get him we know
[2:06:57] the story he was there busting up them
[2:07:00] organizations they had up there a
[2:07:03] 12-year-old wow they had up there and
[2:07:07] all that scrupled it he was tearing it
[2:07:10] to pieces and they was astonished a
[2:07:14] little boy like that that knowed that it
[2:07:18] was God speaking through him because he
[2:07:21] was the word for that day oh my notice
[2:07:26] how perfect that is Christ is the same
[2:07:29] yesterday today and forever his
[2:07:32] revelation we find out is the same he
[2:07:35] started healing and when he did
[2:07:37] everything was fine but then when he
[2:07:40] began to it it is the voice begins to
[2:07:44] speak unless you eat the Flesh of the
[2:07:47] son of
[2:07:49] man well they the congregation walked
[2:07:52] away said oh that fellow he's not
[2:07:56] educated that's why he's doing that
[2:07:57] that's that's why he's saying those
[2:07:59] things he he's he's not from the
[2:08:01] Seminary so of course he'd be following
[2:08:03] something fanatical right oh that fellow
[2:08:06] we don't want to hear him no more that
[2:08:09] fellow is out of his mind they forgot
[2:08:11] all that he had done the
[2:08:14] manifestation they didn't read the Bible
[2:08:16] to see what hour they were living sure
[2:08:19] he was an odd person God does it that
[2:08:21] way they say odd
[2:08:24] things how odd was William
[2:08:27] brandham if anybody is interested we
[2:08:30] have uh I'll I'll just show this out
[2:08:32] there on the computer in the back we
[2:08:34] actually have the life story and many
[2:08:37] people probably already have it but if
[2:08:39] you don't have it it's narrated and it's
[2:08:41] actually a wonderful thing you can
[2:08:42] actually take that life story put it on
[2:08:44] a thumb drive stick it in your car and
[2:08:46] every time you get in the car you can be
[2:08:47] listening I'm not saying you should I'm
[2:08:48] just saying you can you can take it and
[2:08:50] load it on your computer if if you want
[2:08:51] the life story we have a digital copy
[2:08:53] here and you're more than welcome to it
[2:08:55] but he was definitely odd if you listen
[2:08:58] to the things that he encountered what
[2:08:59] his family went through he was
[2:09:01] definitely an oddball wasn't he that's
[2:09:02] why he could preach the message Oddball
[2:09:05] he he knew what it meant to be oddd why
[2:09:08] couldn't Micaiah agree with the rest of
[2:09:11] them Israelite prophets down there
[2:09:14] before Jehoshaphat in them see why
[2:09:17] couldn't he had the word of the Lord he
[2:09:19] had to say and he said I'll only say
[2:09:22] what God Said and we know that he was
[2:09:24] standing against 400 God prophets
[2:09:28] brother bradam said and they all said
[2:09:30] you're gonna win don't worry King Ahab
[2:09:34] even though your wife is running the
[2:09:37] kingdom the
[2:09:39] unbeliever you want to go down and take
[2:09:41] that Kingdom it's actually your kingdom
[2:09:43] yeah you should be able to go and get it
[2:09:45] go for it don't worry but that man
[2:09:48] josephat hey isn't it wonderful that he
[2:09:51] said haven't you got one more Prophet
[2:09:53] amen I I'm sick and tired of hearing
[2:09:55] this same old thing the good old boys
[2:09:57] club there's got to be someone
[2:09:59] else and that one said hey I'm not going
[2:10:02] to say anything to conform I'm only
[2:10:04] going to say what God puts in my mouth
[2:10:07] and what did he say he said hey if you
[2:10:09] go down there you're ain't coming back
[2:10:11] and if God is God just try it and see
[2:10:14] what happens right and they didn't like
[2:10:16] that but why couldn't he he had the word
[2:10:18] of the Lord he had to say it he said
[2:10:21] only say what God Said and they had the
[2:10:23] scriptural authority to show that they
[2:10:25] were right it was their land they was
[2:10:27] the king but not all the
[2:10:30] scripture Jesus said it is also
[2:10:34] written see they didn't understand it
[2:10:37] and it wasn't for them to understand
[2:10:39] because Jesus is a divine revelation
[2:10:43] when we actually catch the perfect
[2:10:45] realization of who Jesus is today not
[2:10:49] just yesterday and not just in the
[2:10:51] future we know brother bradam said it
[2:10:53] many times in his his his his ministry
[2:10:56] that many times people they'll be busy
[2:10:59] thinking about what God's done in the
[2:11:00] past and how tremendous God has poured
[2:11:02] out blessings in the past and and and
[2:11:04] what he's going to do in the future but
[2:11:05] what what's happening right now they're
[2:11:07] just ignoring we don't want to be of
[2:11:10] that group we we want to be the one
[2:11:12] celebrating saying he is Hebrews 138
[2:11:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:11:17] and forever and and not just for other
[2:11:20] people for me and my house for me and my
[2:11:23] church for me and my
[2:11:25] situation in the voice of the sign
[2:11:27] brother Bram he says notice the Prophet
[2:11:29] come and when he does it shows a
[2:11:32] sign and then there is a voice in that
[2:11:36] sign that speaks a voice that speaks a
[2:11:39] scriptural voice that has to be
[2:11:42] according to the Bible reflecting the
[2:11:44] word for that hour it's always been that
[2:11:47] way it's always will be that way because
[2:11:50] God can cannot change isn't that
[2:11:52] wonderful to think that we have been
[2:11:54] given the ability to see that God sent a
[2:11:56] prophet to the ability to understand
[2:11:59] what the prophet was sent for there's
[2:12:01] some people in this world that don't
[2:12:03] know that yet and I just have such a
[2:12:06] burden to see those people hear about
[2:12:08] this voice I know I lived in this city
[2:12:11] for 33 years and hadn't heard that God
[2:12:14] sent a prophet nobody ever said that God
[2:12:16] sent a prophet to me I heard about
[2:12:20] Prophets I heard about all kinds of
[2:12:22] musical prophets and different prophets
[2:12:25] and many different things and I knew the
[2:12:28] name Prophet we the the devil's not
[2:12:30] stupid is
[2:12:31] he he's the most subtle of all the
[2:12:34] beasts of the field ain't he isn't that
[2:12:35] his position and what has he done he's
[2:12:38] taken the word prophet and made such a
[2:12:39] mockery out of it he's he's tarnished it
[2:12:42] so terribly for the people that have
[2:12:44] claimed to have some sort of a prophetic
[2:12:46] anything that people when they
[2:12:48] automatically hear the word Prophet
[2:12:49] they're just disgusted and immediately
[2:12:52] that was my reaction but I had to go and
[2:12:54] look it up and recognize that it just
[2:12:55] means messenger I we know brother bradam
[2:12:58] says that out of the word it means
[2:13:01] preacher
[2:13:03] Prophet don't be scared about the word
[2:13:05] Prophet there's nothing to be scared of
[2:13:08] it's God who is rich in Mercy wanting to
[2:13:11] show his love to
[2:13:14] mankind but we know that we had a
[2:13:17] scriptural voice that came in our day a
[2:13:19] sign of healing healing when people had
[2:13:22] tremendous problems in their lives
[2:13:24] mentally physically financially whatever
[2:13:26] it was if they were genuine with God God
[2:13:29] was more than willing to actually bless
[2:13:32] them according to their desire and many
[2:13:34] times they didn't even have to have a
[2:13:35] prayer card and get in line God would
[2:13:37] just discern their heart as they sat
[2:13:39] there in the audience what a tremendous
[2:13:42] thing brother bradam says that the voice
[2:13:44] and the sign that speaks a voice that
[2:13:46] speaks a scriptural voice that has to be
[2:13:49] according to the Bible there has to be
[2:13:51] some rails there has to be some
[2:13:53] guidelines for it that's where we can
[2:13:55] say well is that man speaking actually
[2:13:58] going to be worth listening to or is he
[2:14:00] another fanatical like the rest of the
[2:14:01] world like Satan has done with that word
[2:14:04] how will we ever
[2:14:05] know we got to be willing to take it
[2:14:07] back to the word
[2:14:09] ourselves and see is that true it does
[2:14:13] the word of God say Jesus Christ the
[2:14:16] same yesterday today and forever is
[2:14:19] there a scriptural identific a there has
[2:14:22] to be a scriptural voice and that has to
[2:14:25] be according to the Bible reflecting the
[2:14:27] word for that
[2:14:29] hour what hour is it brothers and
[2:14:32] sisters this is the hour of body change
[2:14:34] this isn't the hour of talking about
[2:14:36] building an arc this isn't the hour
[2:14:39] about talking about tremendous healing
[2:14:43] campaigns even though all of that is
[2:14:46] sort of part of it isn't it it's not a
[2:14:48] time to be talking about amassing great
[2:14:50] wealth and and becoming super uber
[2:14:53] wealthy in this world all of that's
[2:14:56] going to burn it's going to melt the
[2:14:58] gold that we amass is an element and
[2:15:00] it's going to melt with a fervent heat
[2:15:01] is what the Bible says the only thing of
[2:15:04] value is that soul that little teeny
[2:15:07] spot that's inside our heart and in that
[2:15:10] little teeny spot that's inside our
[2:15:12] heart have we taken the blood the token
[2:15:16] and struck the doorpost of that heart
[2:15:21] it's always been that way it always will
[2:15:23] be that way because God cannot change
[2:15:26] now notice jesus' first Ministry oh they
[2:15:28] all everybody wanted him in their Church
[2:15:30] oh my he's such a a great fellow sure he
[2:15:33] went in all the synagogues and read the
[2:15:35] Scrolls and sat down everybody young
[2:15:38] Rabbi and we know in our day in our age
[2:15:41] it was the same way with this Vindicated
[2:15:43] Prophet they loved his healing campaign
[2:15:45] they loved the way he talked about the
[2:15:46] word they loved his ministry oh but once
[2:15:49] he started to act
[2:15:51] become a voice behind the sign and start
[2:15:55] actually expounding upon the word oh my
[2:15:58] that was when they said NOP too much we
[2:16:00] can't do it brother BR goes on to say
[2:16:02] here but one day he began to talk to
[2:16:03] them Jesus began to talk to them in
[2:16:05] another way he didn't just continue on
[2:16:08] there was a change in his ministry the
[2:16:10] voice of the sign began to speak and we
[2:16:14] know that that voice of the sign began
[2:16:16] to speak I and my father are one unless
[2:16:20] you eat Eat My Flesh and drink my blood
[2:16:23] ye have no life in you as soon as he did
[2:16:26] that they wanted to kill him why did
[2:16:28] they want to kill them because in that
[2:16:30] little tiny space in their heart there
[2:16:32] was no faith to mix with the word that
[2:16:34] was coming across their path so what
[2:16:37] happened the only thing that was left
[2:16:39] was what was already in there and what
[2:16:41] was in there was
[2:16:42] murder because they were of their father
[2:16:44] the devil is what the word
[2:16:47] says oh my but one day he began to talk
[2:16:51] to them in another way I say Lord speak
[2:16:53] to us in another way let us actually
[2:16:56] have the perfect realization the perfect
[2:16:59] revelation of this word so that we can
[2:17:02] recognize who we
[2:17:04] are and the voice of the sign began to
[2:17:07] speak nobody wanted them one of them
[2:17:10] said this man is crazy it's a cannibal
[2:17:13] trying to make a cannibal out of all of
[2:17:15] us and some people might even say that
[2:17:18] when you start talking this way my we're
[2:17:20] not talking about being cannibals some
[2:17:21] people might say well now you're getting
[2:17:23] fanatical talking about you and your
[2:17:24] father being one and and and all
[2:17:27] this if his spirit's on the inside of
[2:17:30] you then who are you let this mind that
[2:17:33] was in Christ be in you also who's are
[2:17:36] you who is it that's actually thinking
[2:17:38] and reasoning in your
[2:17:41] body if it's us we're going to make the
[2:17:43] wrong decisions all day long every
[2:17:45] single time we might get one maybe two
[2:17:48] if we're lucky we'll make some good
[2:17:50] decisions along the way but the rest of
[2:17:52] it will be hiccuping along the dusty
[2:17:54] path of life if we're Sons and Daughters
[2:17:56] of God it won't be easy but one we
[2:17:59] actually do surrender all to him it does
[2:18:02] become easy because his word says it
[2:18:04] doesn't it my yoke my yoke is
[2:18:08] easy my burden is light when we start to
[2:18:13] get burdened down with all of the cares
[2:18:15] of this life brothers and sisters we can
[2:18:17] go on our knees and actually cry unto
[2:18:20] him and say Lord where are you and you
[2:18:24] know we can even say this brothers and
[2:18:25] sisters and I know some people might get
[2:18:27] upset but others are going to say Amen
[2:18:28] we can say where is the god of
[2:18:32] Elijah because he's the real God and I
[2:18:36] say I need him on the scene now and
[2:18:38] he'll come he'll come we know that
[2:18:41] Daniel the great Prophet Daniel he
[2:18:42] prayed and he waited 21
[2:18:45] days 21 days for the angel of the Lord
[2:18:48] to come to his rescue but what did he do
[2:18:50] get upset
[2:18:51] did he say oh I you know it's 20 days
[2:18:54] ago and I haven't heard anything and I'm
[2:18:55] just going through all this pain and
[2:18:57] Agony so he must not
[2:18:59] care nope no no like
[2:19:03] Abraham 25
[2:19:05] years 20 years in people were saying you
[2:19:09] sir are a freak you're saying you're
[2:19:12] going to have a baby at 100 years old
[2:19:13] you're a nuts man we should lock you up
[2:19:16] we should commit you to the infirmary
[2:19:19] because your your cuckoo according to
[2:19:21] the wisdom of man's teaching aren't you
[2:19:23] right but what did he say he said you
[2:19:26] know what 20 years down the road I know
[2:19:29] that promise has never been as close as
[2:19:31] it is today that promise is closer than
[2:19:34] it's ever been in my life and I say make
[2:19:37] ready the nursery oh my make sure we got
[2:19:40] thread and and yarn so we can knit those
[2:19:42] blankets so we could be ready for that
[2:19:44] baby when it comes because it's
[2:19:48] coming and I just want to say brothers
[2:19:50] and sister sisters don't get weary in
[2:19:52] well-doing if we haven't seen a promise
[2:19:55] answered from God yet don't get weary
[2:19:58] that promise is closer than it's ever
[2:20:00] been it's never been so close in our
[2:20:03] lives to think about the Rapture of the
[2:20:05] church don't think about the great
[2:20:07] Eternal event that's going to take place
[2:20:09] think about right now in my life what is
[2:20:11] changing in my life I should be seeing a
[2:20:14] body change God is only interested in
[2:20:17] our own personal spiritual growth and if
[2:20:19] we're not growing we're
[2:20:22] dying we have got to be making sure that
[2:20:25] we're feeding on the
[2:20:27] word I think it's so beautiful Matthew
[2:20:30] 16 my I just feel like I want to start
[2:20:33] preaching now in Matthew 16 I'll call
[2:20:35] the musicians as a as a as a token as a
[2:20:39] promise that uh we're going to end here
[2:20:41] you know in Matthew 16 the the greatest
[2:20:43] the greatest words I think that came out
[2:20:46] of Peter's
[2:20:48] mouth Jesus was asking them who does the
[2:20:51] world say that I am and and we know that
[2:20:53] he said he said to them who who who is
[2:20:56] everyone what's the word on the street
[2:20:57] about
[2:20:58] me they said some Elias and some
[2:21:01] Jeremiah and some the prophets but he
[2:21:04] narrowed it down because he wasn't
[2:21:05] talking to the rest of the world he
[2:21:07] wanted to see who they thought who do
[2:21:09] you say that I am amen but he didn't
[2:21:12] just say who do you say that I am who do
[2:21:14] you say the son of man
[2:21:17] is verse 17 of Matthew 16 Jesus J
[2:21:20] answered and said unto him blessed art
[2:21:23] thou Simon bar Jonah why did he say this
[2:21:26] to
[2:21:27] him because thou he said to him Thou Art
[2:21:30] the Christ the son of the Living
[2:21:33] God remember this is the man who was a
[2:21:36] fisherman he he mended Nets he didn't go
[2:21:38] to theology school he didn't go and go
[2:21:41] to university he wasn't studied he
[2:21:42] wasn't taught to think critically he
[2:21:46] never earned the right to this and Jesus
[2:21:49] Christ God in flesh was very quick to
[2:21:51] tell him that and to make sure that all
[2:21:54] of the rest of the people were able to
[2:21:56] perceive the blessing it moved from fish
[2:21:58] now to Total realization to Total
[2:22:00] Revelation such a revelation that the
[2:22:03] entire Catholic Church would try and
[2:22:05] build their Church Upon This and Miss
[2:22:07] what actually took place here Jesus
[2:22:11] answered and said unto him blessed art
[2:22:12] thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood
[2:22:14] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[2:22:16] Father which is in heaven and we know
[2:22:18] that that is what the church is built on
[2:22:21] Revelation not the rock of a Peter not
[2:22:24] Peter a man so unstable that he would
[2:22:27] deny Christ and curse while doing it we
[2:22:29] know that's what brother bradam taught
[2:22:31] that's not what it was at all it was the
[2:22:33] realization the perfect
[2:22:35] realization the Revelation that was
[2:22:37] given not by flesh and blood not taught
[2:22:40] in a theology in a seminary not not not
[2:22:43] because of Any traditional teaching
[2:22:45] simply because God himself chose to
[2:22:48] plant those thoughts in his heart amen
[2:22:52] and I just think brothers and sisters
[2:22:53] many times we can have those thoughts
[2:22:55] planted in our hearts but do we actually
[2:22:58] act on those
[2:23:00] thoughts I'm going to end there I'll ask
[2:23:02] you to stand with me as we close are we
[2:23:05] allowing his
[2:23:06] thoughts to permeate through our
[2:23:10] lives 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 49
[2:23:16] and as we have borne the image of the
[2:23:18] Earthly oh my we shall also bear the
[2:23:22] image of the Heavenly now this I say
[2:23:25] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[2:23:28] inherit the kingdom of God neither does
[2:23:31] corruption inherit
[2:23:33] incorruption so don't worry about this
[2:23:36] flesh worry about that Soul get the Lord
[2:23:40] Jesus Christ inside that soul and allow
[2:23:44] him the spirit of Truth to lead us and
[2:23:47] guide us he says behold I show you a
[2:23:49] mystery which shall not not all sleep
[2:23:51] but we shall all be changed isn't that
[2:23:54] interesting all of us will be whether we
[2:23:57] come from the grave or whether we
[2:23:59] actually see a molecular change in our
[2:24:01] bodies how that will happen no man knows
[2:24:05] except for God
[2:24:06] himself the one that could eat fish and
[2:24:10] eat honeycomb and then step through a
[2:24:13] wall that one the one that could break
[2:24:16] the bread that we read about that could
[2:24:17] break the fish create all of those
[2:24:19] things the same one that could actually
[2:24:21] come down in our generation and speak a
[2:24:25] squirrel into existence how do you
[2:24:27] explain that you can't explain it you
[2:24:29] just have to believe it we just have to
[2:24:32] believe it that in the moment in the
[2:24:33] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[2:24:35] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[2:24:37] in Christ shall rise be raised
[2:24:39] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[2:24:41] for this corruptible isn't it beautiful
[2:24:44] this corruptible must put on
[2:24:47] incorruption and this mortality must put
[2:24:50] on
[2:24:52] immortality my I need to stop I I I

[2:25:12] gather together in your name we thank
[2:25:15] you Lord Jesus that you are the same
[2:25:17] yesterday today and forever Lord Jesus
[2:25:20] that your desire for each and every one
[2:25:22] of us is that we would be changed in the
[2:25:24] moment in the twinkling of an eye father
[2:25:27] that Lord Jesus we would be able to see
[2:25:29] this
[2:25:31] corruption oh Father be changed into
[2:25:35] incorruption that this mortality father
[2:25:37] one day would be changed in the moment
[2:25:40] in the twinkling of an eye into
[2:25:42] immortality father Lord I pray that you
[2:25:45] would help us to search our hearts Lord
[2:25:47] to find that little tiny space inside of
[2:25:49] our hearts Lord that so hungry and so
[2:25:52] thirsty and that Lord we could fill it
[2:25:55] with the right things that we would not
[2:25:58] be trying to satisfy our
[2:26:00] Cravings with the things of this world
[2:26:03] Amen but that Lord we could just go on
[2:26:06] our knees and spend time with you in
[2:26:08] prayer and allow you father to fill that
[2:26:11] void that we would feed in the right
[2:26:14] places that we would not feed in the
[2:26:17] wrong places father I pray that you
[2:26:19] would just keep your hand upon each one
[2:26:21] of us now as we go our separate ways if
[2:26:24] Lord there's anybody that desires to
[2:26:26] have the baptism of your Holy Spirit I
[2:26:28] pray that you would just grant to them
[2:26:31] right now in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:26:33] the ability to receive that free gift
[2:26:36] from you Lord understanding that it's
[2:26:38] not just a package that we would put in
[2:26:40] our pocket and take but Lord that it's
[2:26:42] where you become Lord over their lives
[2:26:46] and father that every single Sinful
[2:26:48] Nature has to go when you come into our
[2:26:51] lives father I pray that Lord if there's
[2:26:54] anybody here that needs a refilling of
[2:26:56] your spirit Lord Jesus who has fully
[2:26:58] committed their lives to you and Lord
[2:27:01] just needs a little bit more father Lord
[2:27:03] I pray that you would grant that now in
[2:27:05] the name of Jesus Christ father that
[2:27:08] that that light that once burned bright
[2:27:10] and clear in our hearts father would
[2:27:12] just Lord Jesus Shine to the world
[2:27:14] around us father that our lamps would
[2:27:17] not become cloudy and and and SM but
[2:27:20] father that we could just trim our lamps
[2:27:22] Lord while there's still time that you
[2:27:24] would allow us father while we have the
[2:27:26] chance to fill our lamps with your oil
[2:27:29] Lord father we love you and we thank you
[2:27:32] and we just want to commit each life
[2:27:34] into your hands now for your glory in
