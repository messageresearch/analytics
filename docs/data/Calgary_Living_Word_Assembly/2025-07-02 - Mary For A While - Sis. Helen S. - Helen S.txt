[Music] And I know I could be Martha all day. I won't let my chance to be with him slip away. I want to be married for a while in all that I do. Close the door to everything that keeps my heart from him. Lord, I want to rest here and feel heaven smile. I want to be merry for a while. [Music] I know that I'll make Martha proud of me. with lost to do and places I must be. [Music] And yet I need this time to refresh my heart and mind. Your presence, Lord, is just what I need.
