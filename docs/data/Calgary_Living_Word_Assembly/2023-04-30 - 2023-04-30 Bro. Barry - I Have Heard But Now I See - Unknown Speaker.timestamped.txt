[1:09:03] unto you father the love that you have
[1:09:06] placed within us Lord Jesus for you
[1:09:09] it's such a paradox Lord Jesus it's
[1:09:12] nothing that we could ever do on our own
[1:09:13] but it's because you this you said your
[1:09:16] word says that I'll be with you even in
[1:09:19] you until the end of the world and we
[1:09:21] know that as long as you're here with us

[1:09:50] home safely they're not feeling well
[1:09:53] father we just thank you for touching
[1:09:55] Isaiah Thomas Lord the 14 year old boy
[1:09:58] Afflicted with the Devil
[1:10:00] father father we thank you that there is
[1:10:02] always a time appointed of the father
[1:10:04] Lord where we might not see a miracle we
[1:10:07] might not see an instantaneous change
[1:10:09] but father we know that if we speak the
[1:10:12] word and we believe without doubting in
[1:10:14] our hearts then it will come to pass
[1:10:16] that which we believe that which we ask

[1:12:19] I know sister Faith will certainly enjoy
[1:12:21] having her and the whole family as well
[1:12:24] there's nothing better than having
[1:12:26] Grandma around
[1:12:29] Job chapter 42.
[1:12:32] verse 1.
[1:12:35] then job answered the Lord and said I
[1:12:37] know that thou can't do everything
[1:12:41] and that no thought can be withholden
[1:12:44] from thee
[1:12:46] who is he that hideth counsel without
[1:12:48] knowledge
[1:12:50] therefore have I uttered that I
[1:12:53] understood not
[1:12:55] things too wonderful for me which I knew
[1:12:58] not
[1:12:59] here I beseech thee and I will speak I
[1:13:02] will demand of thee and declare thou
[1:13:04] unto me
[1:13:06] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:13:09] the ear but now mine I
[1:13:12] see if the
[1:13:14] wherefore I abort myself and repent in
[1:13:18] dust and Ashes
[1:13:20] amen let's just bow one more time
[1:13:22] Heavenly Father Lord thank you for your
[1:13:25] word thank you that your word is the
[1:13:28] present word lord it's not a historical
[1:13:31] text but it's something that we can read
[1:13:34] and father it has life Lord Jesus and we
[1:13:37] just ask Lord Jesus that once again you
[1:13:40] would come by here on this little corner
[1:13:42] in Calgary that you would just Quicken
[1:13:45] this word to us today Father Lord that
[1:13:48] when we leave this building today we
[1:13:50] would say that truly we met with the
[1:13:52] Lord Jesus Christ and father if there be
[1:13:55] any in our midst that maybe haven't Lord
[1:13:57] we just ask that supernaturally they
[1:14:00] would be able to say the same words
[1:14:01] father Lord we just love you and we
[1:14:04] thank you and we ask that you would
[1:14:05] bless the reading of your word now in
[1:14:08] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:14:10] God bless you this morning you may be
[1:14:12] seated
[1:14:13] for a few minutes
[1:14:17] just a few announcements before we go
[1:14:19] too far we have the May calendar out
[1:14:22] and uh
[1:14:25] you'll be able to go and check it out
[1:14:26] just a few highlights we have a gym
[1:14:29] night arranged for May the 12th and I
[1:14:32] think it's at Central Memorial High this
[1:14:35] time we have two hours booked I believe
[1:14:36] so it should be a real good night
[1:14:40] um we have a ladies brunch booked for
[1:14:42] Saturday the 13th
[1:14:44] we have a prayer meeting on the 18th
[1:14:46] which is a Thursday we have a youth
[1:14:48] event on the 19th
[1:14:50] and we have a communion service booked
[1:14:51] for the 28th
[1:14:53] and moving forward I don't know if I've
[1:14:56] said it but I just will if I haven't I
[1:15:00] would like to re-uh
[1:15:02] pardon me I would like to alternate
[1:15:05] communion service one month praise and
[1:15:08] worship service the other month
[1:15:10] and we'll just sort of rotate that way
[1:15:12] and we should be able to have six of
[1:15:13] each in the course of a year
[1:15:15] just see what the Lord will do there
[1:15:18] I think there's something real special
[1:15:20] about worship
[1:15:21] and and I can't get away from that
[1:15:23] thought and as we go forwards I'm just
[1:15:25] going to go closer and closer towards it
[1:15:28] and I believe the Lord will open it wide
[1:15:30] to us but there's something real
[1:15:32] important about worship it's not
[1:15:33] something that we can just Overlook and
[1:15:35] say it's a formality that we just do
[1:15:37] because it's a mechanical thing when we
[1:15:40] go to church we just sing you know when
[1:15:43] we get over there brothers and sisters
[1:15:44] we're not going to be reading quotes
[1:15:45] from the message of the hour we're not
[1:15:48] going to be reading scriptures from the
[1:15:49] Bible we're not going to be having Bible
[1:15:51] studies or prayer meetings we're going
[1:15:53] to be worshiping that's what we're going
[1:15:55] to do when we're over there we're going
[1:15:57] to live and we're going to build but
[1:15:58] brothers and sisters we're not going to
[1:15:59] be trying to learn more about the word
[1:16:01] because we're going to be the word
[1:16:03] right now is the time to actually study
[1:16:06] and learn but hey something happens when
[1:16:08] you worship before you study and learn
[1:16:10] what we do is we tear down walls we tear
[1:16:13] down strongholds we talked about that a
[1:16:15] while ago if we want to see the success
[1:16:17] of the Lord in our services in our lives
[1:16:19] then we've got to let go of all of our
[1:16:21] inhibitions and give him the worthy
[1:16:23] Glory that he is do the praise that he
[1:16:26] is Desiring
[1:16:29] as our brother said it earlier I think
[1:16:31] it's so vital to recognize it that it's
[1:16:34] an expression of our love to our husband
[1:16:37] if we're the bride
[1:16:38] and as husbands how do we like our wives
[1:16:41] to express their love to us
[1:16:43] we like it I don't think there's any
[1:16:45] husband here that doesn't like it when
[1:16:47] their wife expresses her love
[1:16:50] anyways I'm going off on a tangent
[1:16:53] pardon me I had a hook or a slice there
[1:16:55] we're gonna go straight down the Fairway
[1:16:57] here
[1:16:58] you know we're we're gonna alternate the
[1:17:00] services and just see what the Lord will
[1:17:01] do
[1:17:03] also I wanted to throw it out there I
[1:17:05] wanted to mention it a while ago but I
[1:17:07] forgot I would like to see if we could
[1:17:09] do a passion play Journey a pilgrimage
[1:17:12] out to Drum Heller this summer so if
[1:17:15] anybody's interested in going I think we
[1:17:17] can make arrangements to go and I think
[1:17:19] it'd be a fun time it'll be a great time
[1:17:21] of fellowship if nobody has ever seen it
[1:17:23] before it's well worth it it's been many
[1:17:25] years since I've gone but if you'd like
[1:17:27] to go just send me a text message I'd
[1:17:29] like to see what there is for interest
[1:17:31] and we'll try and book something for
[1:17:33] everyone to be able to go together it's
[1:17:35] a very limited time if you were to go on
[1:17:38] the website you could see just look up
[1:17:39] Passion Play and uh let's just see if we
[1:17:43] can have a an outing I think it'll be a
[1:17:45] real fun time
[1:17:47] had a had a text sent this morning and I
[1:17:50] just think it's so beautiful I want to
[1:17:52] thank everyone for the specials today
[1:17:55] I want to thank everyone for the
[1:17:56] specials yesterday and I want to thank
[1:17:59] everyone for the specials in the future
[1:18:00] because the specials do something they
[1:18:03] set an atmosphere brothers and sisters
[1:18:04] they're an expression of our love of our
[1:18:07] worship unto God and we can never ever
[1:18:10] over rate the preciousness of a special
[1:18:13] when somebody takes the time and their
[1:18:15] energy to come and sing a special it's
[1:18:18] not so they can be seen sometimes we see
[1:18:20] that and unfortunately it's human nature
[1:18:23] and and we just want to have Grace for
[1:18:25] those people we don't want to say
[1:18:26] because of that I'm never going to go to
[1:18:27] a worship service again
[1:18:29] we've seen it before
[1:18:31] you know what that is it's a trap of the
[1:18:33] devil to try and see what you'll do God
[1:18:35] will allow those things to happen
[1:18:36] brothers and sisters just to see how
[1:18:38] we're going to react
[1:18:39] is are we going to stand before him one
[1:18:41] day and say well this thing happened on
[1:18:43] Earth that's why I couldn't worship you
[1:18:44] he's going to say really didn't my word
[1:18:47] say that immediately the Rocks would cry
[1:18:49] out if you wouldn't worship me what are
[1:18:52] we going to do what are we going to let
[1:18:53] stand in the way of us worshiping Lord
[1:18:55] the Lord but I just had this text come
[1:18:58] and uh I just wanted to read it here
[1:19:00] it's from Brother Toby this morning he
[1:19:02] sent it on the men's chat says now we
[1:19:03] come to church to better ourselves
[1:19:06] the people that come to church brothers
[1:19:07] and sisters aren't perfect people we
[1:19:09] come to church because we're broken
[1:19:10] people and we need to be fixed people we
[1:19:13] know that we're Sinners saved by grace
[1:19:15] that's why we come to church so we can
[1:19:16] get better
[1:19:18] the ones who are perfect you want to
[1:19:20] step back from you want to be careful
[1:19:22] now I say that in context because we're
[1:19:25] supposed to be therefore perfect as your
[1:19:27] father in Heaven is perfect the only way
[1:19:29] we're going to be perfect is to be
[1:19:31] completely surrendered unto the Lord
[1:19:33] but if somebody has a perfect image and
[1:19:36] their image is their perfection brothers
[1:19:39] and sisters that's the wrong thing
[1:19:41] but here we are reading this quote here
[1:19:43] it says now we come to church to better
[1:19:45] ourselves we we come to make ourselves
[1:19:47] better people
[1:19:49] this is where I think you know some of
[1:19:51] the people who are
[1:19:52] they want to try and make William Marion
[1:19:54] Brown I'm a fanatic if they would just
[1:19:56] listen to what he said they would just
[1:19:57] read it read what he says and listen to
[1:20:00] it with their ears with their minds we
[1:20:03] come to church to make ourselves better
[1:20:05] people better Christians better citizens
[1:20:09] better fathers better mothers better
[1:20:12] Neighbors
[1:20:13] we come because Christ has told us if we
[1:20:16] would come ask anything in his name
[1:20:19] where we are assembled together as many
[1:20:21] as two or three he would he would be
[1:20:24] with us and would Grant it to us
[1:20:28] so what could be any more be any better
[1:20:31] to us today than to know that we are at
[1:20:34] the church for to embed ourselves
[1:20:37] to broaden our understanding how many
[1:20:40] would say that's what I'm here for
[1:20:42] I think it's beautiful many times we'll
[1:20:45] go and buy a ticket to a tremendous
[1:20:48] concert or a tremendous play or a
[1:20:51] tremendous thing that only happens a
[1:20:54] certain time of the year maybe it's an
[1:20:58] Edmonton Oilers playoffs ticket what's
[1:21:00] that worth brothers and sisters on the
[1:21:02] free market tons of money I don't care
[1:21:04] because I don't really care about hockey
[1:21:06] but that's just me there's a lot of
[1:21:08] people that really Revel in hockey they
[1:21:10] love it and you know what there's
[1:21:12] nothing wrong with that so long as
[1:21:13] that's not your God
[1:21:15] so long as you don't put that first
[1:21:17] but when we come to the house of the
[1:21:19] Lord what happens when there's a
[1:21:20] breakaway do we get excited or is it a a
[1:21:24] playoff thing that does it for us but
[1:21:27] that's the reason we come to church
[1:21:28] brothers and sisters is to be able to
[1:21:30] better ourselves to become better people
[1:21:32] better citizens better neighbors better
[1:21:35] husbands better wives better children
[1:21:38] better parents our desire isn't to come
[1:21:41] and and say that we put on a cloak of
[1:21:43] religious righteousness and now I've
[1:21:46] done my deed for the week and I can go
[1:21:48] out and sin tomorrow and just come back
[1:21:50] next week and make it better
[1:21:52] no that's not what we do at all we come
[1:21:55] to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:21:57] come to recognize how little we really
[1:21:59] are and in the midst of that it actually
[1:22:02] builds us up makes us better people
[1:22:07] welcome back kempers it's certainly good
[1:22:09] to see you again
[1:22:11] I trust you had a wonderful time away
[1:22:17] out of our scripture today I just can't
[1:22:20] help but think most of the inspiration
[1:22:23] today is out of uh 1965. I have heard
[1:22:27] but now I have seen
[1:22:30] um tremendous message
[1:22:33] the Lord just led me there but talking
[1:22:35] about the scripture here you know job
[1:22:37] answering the Lord and knowing that the
[1:22:40] Lord there's no thought that's hidden
[1:22:42] from the Lord
[1:22:43] and who is it that that hideth counsel
[1:22:46] without knowledge
[1:22:48] therefore have I uttered that I
[1:22:51] understood not things too wonderful for
[1:22:54] me which I knew not
[1:22:57] this one just about put me on the floor
[1:22:58] when I was reading this and thinking
[1:23:00] about it brothers and sisters do I
[1:23:03] understand the things that I'm talking
[1:23:04] about
[1:23:05] oh my and here I am preaching the word
[1:23:08] of God I'm just going to try and be
[1:23:09] honest don't be afraid and don't get
[1:23:11] nervous I'm not saying that I'm A ranked
[1:23:13] sinner or anything but what I'm saying
[1:23:15] is I know that I'm a sinner saved by
[1:23:17] grace and I know that I had a meeting
[1:23:18] with him once upon a time and as I
[1:23:21] preached this message of the hour I
[1:23:23] wonder if I fully recognize the
[1:23:25] magnitude of this
[1:23:27] because this is the stuff that prophets
[1:23:29] and sages throughout the ages desire to
[1:23:31] look on even angels desire to see the
[1:23:34] stuff that we just take for granted and
[1:23:36] here we are we've got it all it's an
[1:23:39] open book to us but I think about this
[1:23:42] verse 6 wherefore I abort myself and
[1:23:45] repent and dust and Ashes when I
[1:23:47] recognize that do I understand this oh
[1:23:49] my but you know there came a time for me
[1:23:52] and I know it happens to every single
[1:23:54] believer it there's a time where we've
[1:23:57] heard about the message of the hour
[1:23:58] we've heard about it and we've heard
[1:24:00] about it and we've heard about it but
[1:24:01] there comes a point in time in our lives
[1:24:03] where we can finally see it we can
[1:24:06] finally understand it and that's what
[1:24:08] seeing it means having a comprehension
[1:24:11] of it it's not seeing the message of the
[1:24:13] hour I've got a bookshelf of every
[1:24:15] single published book there ever was and
[1:24:17] all the CDs and maybe the wire reel
[1:24:19] tapes and none of that it's not seeing
[1:24:22] all of that it's not having an app on
[1:24:25] our phone being able to see it and and
[1:24:27] cognitively reason it with our minds
[1:24:29] it's seeing it with our heart
[1:24:31] understanding by Revelation what the
[1:24:33] message of the hour is
[1:24:37] remember last week we we talked about
[1:24:39] this John chapter five verily verily I
[1:24:41] say unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:24:44] believeth on him that set me hasn't
[1:24:46] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:24:48] the condemnation but has passed from
[1:24:50] Death unto life I just think when we
[1:24:51] hear that scripture brothers and sisters
[1:24:53] it gives us the ability to sing that
[1:24:55] song Justified
[1:24:56] Justified
[1:24:59] you never did it in the first place
[1:25:01] and you know if you truly believe that
[1:25:03] God sent a prophet if we believe that
[1:25:05] God sent us a prophet in our day to
[1:25:07] recognize that he said that God said to
[1:25:10] the Bride of Jesus Christ those people
[1:25:12] that hath an ear to hear
[1:25:15] what he saith unto the people you never
[1:25:17] did it in the first place that's
[1:25:19] astounding we've got reason to Rejoice
[1:25:21] right there
[1:25:23] he says verily verily I say unto you the
[1:25:25] hour is coming and now is when the dead
[1:25:28] shall hear the voice of the Son of God
[1:25:30] and they that here shall live you know
[1:25:33] only a certain class of people are able
[1:25:35] to hear
[1:25:37] the son of God
[1:25:38] and that's the Holy Ghost speaking out
[1:25:41] to us speaking out through us
[1:25:44] last week we talked about spiritual
[1:25:46] viruses and
[1:25:47] sometimes we can be spreaders of a virus
[1:25:50] and not even know that we're spreading a
[1:25:52] virus
[1:25:53] and that's why the word says to watch
[1:25:55] what we say
[1:25:56] be very careful how we speak
[1:25:58] around our dinner tables no one else can
[1:26:01] hear us we could be talking on a phone
[1:26:02] be careful how we speak we can be
[1:26:04] spreading viruses and not even
[1:26:07] recognizing it we don't want to talk
[1:26:09] about the the natural types we talk a
[1:26:11] little bit about that last week and and
[1:26:13] it's important I guess to to look at it
[1:26:15] that way but more than anything I want
[1:26:17] to talk about the spiritual thing
[1:26:17] because we want to cover some ground
[1:26:18] today but just to sort of recap and
[1:26:20] remind us stir up our Pure Minds by way
[1:26:23] of remembrance we have to be careful
[1:26:24] what we say other people are listening
[1:26:27] to what we say and some people can can
[1:26:29] can not be affected at all they can hear
[1:26:31] something they'll go in one ear out the
[1:26:33] other ear you'll just say you know what
[1:26:34] it doesn't bother me I'm not going to
[1:26:35] worry about it it's it's irrelevant to
[1:26:37] me and it doesn't bother me but other
[1:26:39] times people hear it and it can affect
[1:26:40] them greatly it can cause a real problem
[1:26:43] in their life I heard one time about how
[1:26:46] someone was in a group of people that
[1:26:47] were just slamming someone just tearing
[1:26:50] them up and you know what happened that
[1:26:52] person who was there listening to it
[1:26:53] they left that meeting of all those
[1:26:55] people Believers that were doing it and
[1:26:58] what happened was a Great Depression set
[1:27:00] in on this person brothers and sisters
[1:27:02] we don't know how the devil is going to
[1:27:04] manifest he's a coward he's always going
[1:27:06] to come different than the way we think
[1:27:07] he's not going to come like a raging
[1:27:09] monster in front of our eyes
[1:27:14] some people can actually
[1:27:17] spread a spiritual virus and it won't
[1:27:19] affect them at all and other people they
[1:27:21] can wind up on spiritual life support
[1:27:22] because of it
[1:27:30] just like to remind everyone if you
[1:27:32] don't mind please just turn your cell
[1:27:34] phones off
[1:27:35] in the house of the Lord
[1:27:37] it's just a reverence if we think about
[1:27:39] it how it was in the days of the priests
[1:27:41] going into the temple
[1:27:43] they had to have everything in order
[1:27:45] very specifically in order
[1:27:48] and I'm pretty confident they never took
[1:27:50] cell phones into the temple into the
[1:27:52] holy of holies
[1:27:53] because if they did they would be drug
[1:27:55] out by a rope tied to their ankle this
[1:27:59] is life or death brothers and sisters
[1:28:00] this isn't just something we do out of
[1:28:02] fun it's not just a tradition this is
[1:28:04] serious business there's no greater
[1:28:07] honor or or judgment to us than to come
[1:28:09] to the house of the Lord
[1:28:11] but here we have a situation where
[1:28:13] people can be winding up on on spiritual
[1:28:16] life support because of what other
[1:28:18] people say not understanding that the
[1:28:20] words we have bear so much weight in our
[1:28:24] lives and we've talked about it in the
[1:28:25] past we're going to drill into this as
[1:28:27] we go forwards we're not living in the
[1:28:28] first poll or the second poll anointings
[1:28:30] brothers and sisters we're living in the
[1:28:31] third pull the third pull anointing
[1:28:33] that's the age we're living in the bride
[1:28:35] age where the bride is becoming the wife
[1:28:38] when the wife speaks God acts when she
[1:28:42] speaks it's actually not her speaking if
[1:28:44] she is together with him if she's United
[1:28:46] with him it's actually him speaking when
[1:28:49] we speak things we've got to be very
[1:28:51] careful because we are creators we can
[1:28:53] create an environment that opens doors
[1:28:56] for Devils we don't want to do that we
[1:28:58] want to close the doors on Devils we
[1:29:00] want to kick Devils out
[1:29:03] Matthew 5 37 but let your communication
[1:29:07] be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is
[1:29:12] more than these cometh of evil Ephesians
[1:29:15] 4 29 let no corrupt communication
[1:29:18] proceed out of your mouth
[1:29:21] but that which is good to the use of
[1:29:23] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[1:29:26] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[1:29:28] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:29:30] until the day of your Redemption how are
[1:29:32] we going to grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:29:33] brothers and sisters
[1:29:35] by speaking our communication is going
[1:29:38] to be corrupt
[1:29:40] by giving corrupt communication we're
[1:29:42] going to cause the Holy Ghost to just go
[1:29:44] and sit down and you know it might not
[1:29:46] be a buzz saw temper it might not be
[1:29:48] because we're actually doing something
[1:29:50] at a really big anger we might just be
[1:29:52] simply uttering words that are slamming
[1:29:54] someone else
[1:29:55] you know I was thinking about it while I
[1:29:57] was going over this in the last service
[1:29:59] preparing for the last service Sunday
[1:30:02] Wednesday today what's the biggest
[1:30:04] hindrance to the church today
[1:30:06] we all believe the message of the hour
[1:30:09] we all believe that God said a prophet
[1:30:10] we're all baptized in the Holy Holy
[1:30:13] Spirit we've been baptized the name of
[1:30:14] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:30:16] of our sins We Believe
[1:30:18] but what's the biggest hindrance to the
[1:30:19] Bride of Jesus Christ today I I believe
[1:30:21] it and I would certainly be open to
[1:30:23] conversation again but I think it's our
[1:30:25] communication
[1:30:26] what happens is our communication can
[1:30:29] hinder us and you know when we
[1:30:31] communicate stuff that's actually not
[1:30:33] positive that's the tip of the iceberg
[1:30:37] because a word is a thought expressed
[1:30:39] and many times we do have pretty good
[1:30:41] manners and we do have the ability to
[1:30:43] refrain a little bit sometimes a lot but
[1:30:47] what else is going on up here brother
[1:30:49] Branham said that that is the greatest
[1:30:51] Battleground but he also said that our
[1:30:53] thoughts are louder in heaven than our
[1:30:55] words
[1:30:58] word of God says let no corrupt
[1:31:00] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:31:02] not some
[1:31:03] not partial not only a few
[1:31:06] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:31:09] of your mouth I say Lord help me
[1:31:11] but that which is good to the edifying
[1:31:13] to the use of edifying that it may
[1:31:15] Minister Grace unto the hearers we want
[1:31:18] to minister Grace to people we want to
[1:31:21] minister Grace to our families we want
[1:31:24] to minister Grace to our brothers and
[1:31:26] our sisters we don't want to minister
[1:31:28] anything else
[1:31:30] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:31:32] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:31:33] your Redemption you're not going to
[1:31:34] change your destination
[1:31:36] but you might not be ministering Grace
[1:31:39] what is the next verse 31 says let all
[1:31:41] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:31:42] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:31:45] from you with all malice and be kind one
[1:31:49] to another
[1:31:50] tenderhearted
[1:31:52] forgiving one another
[1:31:54] even as God for Christ's sake have
[1:31:56] forgiven you
[1:31:59] tenderhearted that's a good one
[1:32:02] sometimes in life we experience things
[1:32:05] that cause our hearts to get not tender
[1:32:08] they cause our hearts to get a little
[1:32:10] bit calloused anybody ever have a callus
[1:32:13] on your skin
[1:32:14] you understand what I'm talking about
[1:32:16] the skin gets really hard and you lose
[1:32:19] the feeling there's no more sensitivity
[1:32:22] there when you have a callus sometimes
[1:32:24] it's a good thing to have on your hands
[1:32:25] if you work with your hands sometimes
[1:32:28] it's a good thing to have I've heard for
[1:32:30] preachers to have a little callous on
[1:32:32] their voice on their voice box but
[1:32:34] sometimes a little callus is good it's
[1:32:36] good on our feet sometimes it can give
[1:32:38] us the ability to walk without shoes
[1:32:41] I have hypersensitive feet so I don't
[1:32:44] know I've never been able to develop a
[1:32:45] callus that big kind of wish I would but
[1:32:48] sometimes a callus is good but not when
[1:32:50] it's on our heart brothers and sisters
[1:32:52] be kind one to another tenderhearted
[1:32:55] forgiving one another even as God for
[1:32:58] Christ's sake hath forgiven us we want
[1:32:59] to be a quick to forgive
[1:33:02] slow to speak
[1:33:04] never to Wrath
[1:33:06] Colossians 3 verse 8 but now ye also put
[1:33:10] off all these anger wrath malice
[1:33:12] blasphemy filthy communication out of
[1:33:15] your mouth
[1:33:18] we know that Jesus told the disciples
[1:33:19] it's not what you eat it's not because
[1:33:21] you live by the law
[1:33:23] it's what comes out of you out of your
[1:33:25] mouth it's not what you put into your
[1:33:26] mouth it's what comes out of your mouth
[1:33:28] that's the thing that causes all the
[1:33:30] problems First Corinthians 15 49 and as
[1:33:33] we have borne the image of the Earthly
[1:33:35] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:33:38] heavenly that's common brothers and
[1:33:40] sisters and I believe it now is as we
[1:33:43] come to church As We Worship the Lord as
[1:33:45] we say Amen to the word we become the
[1:33:48] image of the Heavenly as we eat the book
[1:33:51] we become the book
[1:33:52] now this I say Brethren that flesh and
[1:33:55] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[1:33:57] we can never get there by our own works
[1:33:59] so we need to stop trying to have Works
[1:34:02] in our lives if we have Works a list of
[1:34:04] works that we do we need to just forget
[1:34:06] about it and we need to get saved we
[1:34:09] just need to allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:34:10] wash Us by the water of the word and
[1:34:13] that's what's going on when we have
[1:34:14] people that are continually trying to
[1:34:16] live by works because usually what's
[1:34:18] going on is they're looking at other
[1:34:20] people and examining their lives and
[1:34:22] saying well they don't do what I do and
[1:34:24] I don't do what they do works is not
[1:34:26] going to save us brothers and sisters
[1:34:27] works is Cain's religion
[1:34:30] Revelation is the one that will actually
[1:34:33] save us like Abel
[1:34:35] now this is safe Brethren flesh and
[1:34:37] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[1:34:38] neither doth corruption inherit
[1:34:40] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[1:34:44] that's where we live right there isn't
[1:34:46] it we we shall not all sleep but we
[1:34:49] shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:34:51] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:34:53] for the Trump trumpet shall sound and
[1:34:56] the dead shall be raised incorruptible
[1:34:58] and we shall be changed
[1:35:00] kind of makes me wonder this this verse
[1:35:03] right here at the last Trump does Trump
[1:35:05] get elected again for another term
[1:35:08] that'll be the last Trump
[1:35:10] he won't be elected again
[1:35:13] the day which we live in is is very
[1:35:15] precarious
[1:35:16] we we have never lived in an age like we
[1:35:19] live in there's never been as much
[1:35:20] pressure as there is today
[1:35:23] we know the lid of hell was taken off
[1:35:25] many many years ago we had a prophet a
[1:35:28] Vindicated Prophet declare that to us
[1:35:30] and where we live brothers and sisters
[1:35:33] it's it's treacherous we need to be very
[1:35:34] careful where we live and once again as
[1:35:37] I speak these words I say Lord help me
[1:35:40] because I don't want to be darkening
[1:35:42] counsel I don't want to be declaring
[1:35:44] things that I don't know I want to be
[1:35:47] able to experience this and understand
[1:35:48] that that the words that I have heard
[1:35:51] about now I can see them I've heard with
[1:35:55] my ear but now mine I seeth Thee that's
[1:36:00] the scripture that we're talking about
[1:36:02] today out of Job chapter 42.
[1:36:05] and what we're talking about brothers
[1:36:06] and sisters isn't brother Barry just
[1:36:09] coming and bringing a few good words to
[1:36:11] encourage us we're not talking about
[1:36:13] having a guest Minister an evangelist
[1:36:15] come and give us a few words of
[1:36:16] encouragement or some other Pastor
[1:36:18] somewhere maybe that we stream if we
[1:36:20] have a favorite one that we stream you
[1:36:22] know it's not about that at all what it
[1:36:25] is is about the spirit of God discerning
[1:36:28] and that spirit of God has the ability
[1:36:31] to speak to us directly about needs in
[1:36:34] our lives
[1:36:38] if we're willing to allow it
[1:36:40] I remember a case in point example when
[1:36:43] I first started coming to church
[1:36:45] I was having many conversations with my
[1:36:47] wife who was a co-worker at the time
[1:36:49] asking questions about the word of God
[1:36:51] about what your religion is what do you
[1:36:53] believe you know what's all this noise
[1:36:56] about why do you behave the way you
[1:36:58] behave and and as I would ask questions
[1:37:01] she would be able to say to me there's
[1:37:03] times where I can't answer you you need
[1:37:05] to talk to someone else and and I would
[1:37:07] say okay I get it maybe it's just as far
[1:37:10] as we're going to go in our conversation
[1:37:12] about the word and that was fine and and
[1:37:14] I thought you know I will talk to maybe
[1:37:16] her father or I'll talk to brother Ken
[1:37:18] the pastor of the church and just see
[1:37:20] and we go to church the next week and
[1:37:23] brother Ken would start preaching about
[1:37:24] what we were talking about and I'd leave
[1:37:27] the service and I'd be like why did you
[1:37:28] go and talk to him you never even gave
[1:37:30] me a chance to go and have a
[1:37:31] conversation with a pastor I really
[1:37:33] wanted to talk to him about that I kind
[1:37:35] of feel a little bit you know betrayed
[1:37:37] here like what's going on with that but
[1:37:40] I found out she said I didn't tell him
[1:37:42] nothing I never said a word didn't talk
[1:37:44] to my dad didn't talk to the pastor
[1:37:47] and it took me a little while to get
[1:37:48] over myself to recognize hold on a
[1:37:51] second you're coming to church for a
[1:37:52] purpose you want to hear from God and
[1:37:55] now God is talking to you and you're
[1:37:57] going to say that it's something other
[1:37:58] than what is happening
[1:38:00] and when that happened brothers and
[1:38:02] sisters I can tell you that I knew that
[1:38:04] I got saved because now that I had a
[1:38:06] desire in my heart I would talk about it
[1:38:08] to God in my heart he would answer it
[1:38:11] without me even uttering a word
[1:38:14] and that's when I started to become very
[1:38:17] loud at amending in the church I don't
[1:38:19] know if people heard me or saw me or
[1:38:21] whatever but I recognized as I stood at
[1:38:23] the back as a deacon I don't care about
[1:38:25] anybody else here even though I love my
[1:38:27] brothers and sisters I'm here because I
[1:38:29] want to get fed and if I say Amen to the
[1:38:31] word it means sic'em to a preacher and
[1:38:34] God is going to come and speak through
[1:38:35] him to me
[1:38:37] so brothers and sisters don't let
[1:38:39] anybody hold you back when you come to
[1:38:41] church come with a purpose come to hear
[1:38:43] from God
[1:38:46] he's a Discerning spirit and when we
[1:38:49] hear preaching come from the pulpit from
[1:38:51] anybody
[1:38:53] even from a song If we hear a special
[1:38:55] brothers and sisters and it speaks to
[1:38:57] your needs that's not just someone
[1:38:59] pretending to worship that's God
[1:39:02] manifesting himself
[1:39:06] the Discerning Spirit isn't just a put
[1:39:08] on I remember having a conversation with
[1:39:10] someone saying oh discernment is only
[1:39:12] for the prophet well I want to say that
[1:39:14] there's only a prophetic class of people
[1:39:16] on Earth those people who can receive
[1:39:19] the word
[1:39:20] if it's only for the prophet
[1:39:22] but it ain't for the prophet it's not
[1:39:25] just for the prophet it's for the bride
[1:39:27] the bride if she is one with him
[1:39:31] she should be able to discern
[1:39:34] sometimes we could have a conversation
[1:39:35] with someone
[1:39:37] we were doing it just recently weren't
[1:39:39] we brother
[1:39:40] just having a conversation with someone
[1:39:42] and and suddenly it turned into this
[1:39:44] thing where the brother was like oh oh
[1:39:46] well oh uh and I didn't know anything
[1:39:48] about it but what I did was I discerned
[1:39:50] it and you know when we're Discerning
[1:39:52] it's not like God is saying into my
[1:39:54] microphone on my ear oh brother dawn so
[1:39:57] and so about such and such and and and
[1:39:59] there and then that's not the way it
[1:40:01] works the way it works is the minister
[1:40:04] gets inspired because someone says amen
[1:40:06] they go off their notes and they just
[1:40:07] start speaking and as they speak God
[1:40:11] speaks
[1:40:12] it's not a put on brothers and sisters
[1:40:14] some people might say it is but it's
[1:40:16] scriptural let's turn over to Second
[1:40:18] Kings verse
[1:40:20] verse 8.
[1:40:23] I just want to create a scriptural
[1:40:26] foundation for this
[1:40:28] and remember that God deals with man
[1:40:32] through Prophets
[1:40:34] this is the story of
[1:40:36] Elisha
[1:40:55] the king of Syria
[1:40:56] I preached on this a while ago I'm not
[1:40:58] going to go too far into it but I just
[1:40:59] want to bring this point out here verse
[1:41:01] 8 says then the king of Syria wared
[1:41:03] against Israel
[1:41:04] and took counsel with his servants
[1:41:06] saying in such and such a place shall be
[1:41:09] my camp
[1:41:10] and the man of God sent unto the king of
[1:41:13] Israel saying beware
[1:41:15] that thou pass not such a place
[1:41:17] for tither the syrians are come down
[1:41:21] and the king of Israel sent in a place
[1:41:24] which the man of God told and warned him
[1:41:26] of and saved himself there not once nor
[1:41:30] twice so multiple times this was
[1:41:33] happening the discernment was coming to
[1:41:34] the prophet he was telling the king
[1:41:36] don't go down there the syrians are
[1:41:37] going to be there
[1:41:39] verse 11 therefore the heart of the king
[1:41:41] of Syria was sore troubled for this
[1:41:43] thing and he called his servants and
[1:41:46] said unto them will ye not show me which
[1:41:48] of us is for the king of Israel who is
[1:41:51] speaking about our battle plans who is
[1:41:55] leaking the information how is this
[1:41:57] getting out this seems to be a major
[1:41:59] problem in some of the governments in
[1:42:01] the world today it's just leaked out to
[1:42:03] the media and that's what's going on
[1:42:04] here how on Earth could Israel
[1:42:07] understand so many times not once not
[1:42:09] twice who knows maybe three or four or
[1:42:11] five times escaping the king of Syria
[1:42:16] verse 12 and one of his servants said
[1:42:19] none my Lord O King but Elisha the
[1:42:22] prophet that is in Israel telleth the
[1:42:24] king of Israel the words that thou
[1:42:27] speakest in thy bed chamber
[1:42:29] there is a scriptural identification for
[1:42:31] what we're talking about today brothers
[1:42:33] and sisters when we are speaking we're
[1:42:36] going to give voice to God or we're
[1:42:38] going to give voice to the devil one of
[1:42:41] those two things is going to happen
[1:42:42] because a word is a thought expressed
[1:42:44] now our thinking is going to determine
[1:42:47] what's going to happen and that's why we
[1:42:49] have to make sure that we've got the
[1:42:50] Holy Ghost in our life because who can
[1:42:52] honestly who can physically take every
[1:42:54] single thought that comes into your mind
[1:42:56] into captivity on their own who can do
[1:42:57] that
[1:42:59] I know there's some people they've got a
[1:43:00] hair trigger with their mouth
[1:43:02] and sometimes I'm that person
[1:43:04] I'll just say things and I'm like oh I'd
[1:43:07] just like to take those words back but I
[1:43:09] can't they're gone at light speed the
[1:43:11] speed of sound sorry not light speed but
[1:43:13] sometimes it's that fast seems that way
[1:43:15] but you know what we're going to give
[1:43:17] voice to someone
[1:43:19] who is it going to be we know in this
[1:43:21] story here just before this the prophet
[1:43:23] of God was dealing with the the men the
[1:43:26] prophets who were out they were they
[1:43:28] were going to make some some provisions
[1:43:29] and they were digging along the
[1:43:31] riverbank and chopping with an ax and we
[1:43:34] know that the one dropped his ax head in
[1:43:37] the water it came off of his handle and
[1:43:40] he said Lord I I I we help me I I don't
[1:43:43] know what to do I borrowed this ax head
[1:43:45] and now it's gone in the water and the
[1:43:46] prophet of God came over and said oh
[1:43:48] really where did it go where did that ax
[1:43:50] head go is there anything too hard for
[1:43:53] God
[1:43:54] can you imagine having that much
[1:43:55] confidence brothers and sisters about
[1:43:57] the word of God in your mouth because I
[1:43:59] think we could have that much confidence
[1:44:01] what happened in that moment iron swam
[1:44:03] is what the Bible says that ax head swam
[1:44:06] up to the surface for that Prophet not
[1:44:08] for God it was the voice of a man that
[1:44:11] called that ax head up
[1:44:15] we know that further on here after this
[1:44:17] story The syrians came and they
[1:44:20] surrounded them they got them they heard
[1:44:22] that he was here in this town and they
[1:44:25] woke up in the morning and the servant
[1:44:28] of the prophet he woke up and he got
[1:44:30] real nervous and and we know that he saw
[1:44:32] the syrians surrounding their house and
[1:44:35] they went out we know the story real
[1:44:36] well and the prophet of God said you
[1:44:38] know there's more for us than there is
[1:44:40] against us just Lord please open this
[1:44:42] boy's eyes and show him that that
[1:44:43] there's more for us than there are
[1:44:45] against us but what I want to say
[1:44:47] brothers and sisters is that the words
[1:44:49] of the prophet he ran out to meet his
[1:44:52] enemy
[1:44:53] he didn't hide in the house
[1:44:55] he ran out to meet his enemy and said
[1:44:57] who are you looking for
[1:44:58] who is it you want and they said this
[1:45:00] Elisha Prophet that's who we want
[1:45:02] because we know that he's messing with
[1:45:04] our battle plans the king wants to meet
[1:45:06] with this boy and he said oh you know
[1:45:08] what he's not here but just follow me
[1:45:10] now some might say he lied to him
[1:45:12] but what if he made him blind he smelled
[1:45:15] him blind with the words that he spoke
[1:45:17] and said just follow me I'll show you
[1:45:19] and we know that he led them right to a
[1:45:21] table
[1:45:22] that was prepared
[1:45:24] in the presence of his enemies
[1:45:27] the king of Israel said should we kill
[1:45:29] him should we kill him and he said no no
[1:45:31] we want to minister Grace we want to be
[1:45:35] tender-hearted we want to be the ones
[1:45:38] that actually show him the spirit of
[1:45:40] Christ
[1:45:42] make a table prepare them victuals and
[1:45:45] let them know and we know what the word
[1:45:46] of God says at the end of this story
[1:45:48] they were no longer an enemy they became
[1:45:50] an ally because of the way they treated
[1:45:52] them you know that's what happens
[1:45:53] brothers and sisters when we have a
[1:45:55] brother or a sister we got a problem
[1:45:56] with if we can go and fix it it will
[1:45:58] turn around and so that we can be allies
[1:46:00] instead of enemies
[1:46:02] doesn't have to be that way but isn't it
[1:46:04] interesting how that that that works
[1:46:07] when we can recognize that if we have a
[1:46:10] burden and we have a desire and if we
[1:46:12] come to church and something is is
[1:46:14] burning within us and we just need to
[1:46:16] get an answer from God it might not come
[1:46:18] from a Pulpit it could be from a brother
[1:46:20] in the parking lot shaking our hand it
[1:46:22] could be from a Sunday school teacher
[1:46:24] downstairs it could be from a sister
[1:46:27] just shaking your hand and saying God
[1:46:29] bless you and you just have a simple
[1:46:31] conversation but she might be able to
[1:46:33] actually say something that would be of
[1:46:35] encouragement to the need that we have
[1:46:36] in our lives it could be a child it
[1:46:38] could be a husband it could be a wife
[1:46:40] could be a song leader singing a song
[1:46:41] could be a song special it could be
[1:46:43] anything could come from the the
[1:46:45] preaching of the word could come from a
[1:46:47] tape could just in devotions God will
[1:46:50] use anything to speak to us but brothers
[1:46:52] and sisters if a preacher speaks about
[1:46:54] something just say Amen to it it's not
[1:46:57] fake it's the Lord Jesus
[1:46:59] if a minister would actually hear a
[1:47:01] story and bring it to the pulpit and
[1:47:03] actually use it to slam someone they've
[1:47:05] got the wrong Spirit there's something
[1:47:07] wrong with that Ministry and you know
[1:47:10] what brothers and sisters if you ever
[1:47:11] feel like I've done that then come and
[1:47:13] talk to me because I never would
[1:47:15] it would just simply be what we're
[1:47:17] talking about today
[1:47:20] but I certainly don't want to be
[1:47:22] bringing something that would
[1:47:23] hinder people I I don't want to be
[1:47:26] darkening knowledge with my own wisdom
[1:47:30] as we read in job today job 42
[1:47:34] but you know brothers and sisters win it
[1:47:35] it's revealed to you personally
[1:47:39] it changes everything doesn't it
[1:47:42] the spirit speaks to us and how does the
[1:47:45] spirit speak to us we just need to bring
[1:47:47] it right back to the scripture again
[1:47:48] that's why I love the message of the
[1:47:50] hour that William Mary and Branham
[1:47:52] brought some people will say you're a
[1:47:53] fanatic you're crank because you you say
[1:47:55] those words but if you just listen to
[1:47:57] what he said like I said you'll see that
[1:47:59] he always brings it back to the Bible he
[1:48:01] doesn't say I've got an addendum
[1:48:02] although he's got a lot of books and and
[1:48:04] and and things that are produced and
[1:48:07] many people will actually do it
[1:48:09] incorrectly but if you hear the pure
[1:48:11] word of what he said he always points it
[1:48:13] back to the Bible
[1:48:15] and not many people who have a prophetic
[1:48:18] calling in their lives
[1:48:20] self-proclaimed prophetic calling in
[1:48:22] their lives many other people who would
[1:48:24] simply be called prophetic by other
[1:48:27] people that want to exalt them those
[1:48:29] people they've always got some other
[1:48:31] spin on it they've always will say
[1:48:33] something else they won't just point to
[1:48:34] Christ but that's what this man did
[1:48:36] that's why I follow him and I know
[1:48:38] that's why you do as well but when the
[1:48:40] spirit speaks it's through the
[1:48:41] foolishness of preaching brothers and
[1:48:43] sisters and that's why we have to have a
[1:48:45] five-fold Ministry Ephesians 4 is enough
[1:48:48] Ephesians 4 is the only way for someone
[1:48:51] to say that Ephesians 4 is not enough
[1:48:53] that's a doctrine of a devil and I think
[1:48:56] it's terrible because sometimes people
[1:48:57] will sing a song that says that inside
[1:49:00] the Church of the Living God it's
[1:49:02] terrible
[1:49:05] Ephesians 4 is the only thing that's
[1:49:07] going to perfect us brothers and sisters
[1:49:08] it's through a five-fold Ministry it's
[1:49:11] for the Perfection of the Saints and
[1:49:14] anything other than that is going to be
[1:49:16] false Doctrine the word of God we read
[1:49:18] it on Wednesday be therefore perfect
[1:49:20] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:49:22] the only way we're going to get that is
[1:49:24] to follow the word for our day the only
[1:49:26] way they were perfect in Noah's day was
[1:49:29] to follow the word for their day and
[1:49:31] that word was simply get in the boat and
[1:49:34] this word today is get the Holy Ghost
[1:49:36] and the only way we're going to get the
[1:49:37] Holy Ghost is to not be baptized in the
[1:49:39] name of Father the name of son the name
[1:49:42] of Holy Ghost if we do that we're only
[1:49:44] baptized in titles who are you Baptist
[1:49:46] name you baptized in then what name is
[1:49:48] it there's no name a father isn't a name
[1:49:51] a son isn't a name and a holy ghost
[1:49:53] isn't a name but if you say the name of
[1:49:55] the Lord Jesus Christ now you're talking
[1:49:58] now you're speaking the name of God the
[1:50:01] name that he chose
[1:50:05] because we know that when Mary was
[1:50:07] visited by the angel messenger
[1:50:09] that angel messenger said that that
[1:50:12] thing
[1:50:13] that would be born of you you shall call
[1:50:16] him Jesus
[1:50:17] and we know Jesus is his name but when
[1:50:21] we say Jesus brother Brown and brings it
[1:50:23] out very clearly and I think other
[1:50:24] people would agree that there's millions
[1:50:25] of Jesus in the world
[1:50:27] right but there's only one Lord Jesus
[1:50:30] who is the Christ
[1:50:32] the Christ means the sent one means the
[1:50:35] anointed one Jesus is the name but
[1:50:38] there's only one Lord and there's only
[1:50:40] one Jesus Christ the anointed one the
[1:50:43] sent one and that's who we worship and
[1:50:46] that's God in flesh
[1:50:48] and when we do that brothers and sisters
[1:50:49] it gives us the ability to be there
[1:50:51] therefore perfect even as our father in
[1:50:53] Heaven is perfect because we take his
[1:50:54] Spirit that's why we become him we say
[1:50:57] oh oh Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I
[1:51:00] just want to I just want to worship you
[1:51:02] I want to see you come and live inside
[1:51:03] of me I want to see less of me and more
[1:51:05] of you and we know that that's what the
[1:51:07] prophet said in their days they said I
[1:51:09] must decrease so that he must increase
[1:51:11] that's the life of every single bride
[1:51:13] believer we must decrease so that he can
[1:51:15] increase the only way that happens is to
[1:51:17] go on our knees every day
[1:51:21] but you know I want to say this it
[1:51:24] doesn't take a prophet to discern
[1:51:27] the heart of a man
[1:51:29] and we talk about Discerning and being
[1:51:32] able to preach the word and how it's
[1:51:34] anointed and how it affects people you
[1:51:36] know it's not the prophet that discerns
[1:51:39] and it's not the bride that discerns
[1:51:41] it's the spirit that discerns because
[1:51:44] the spirit is a two-edged sword and we
[1:51:47] know that it will discern between right
[1:51:50] and wrong it will discern between life
[1:51:52] and death it's sharper than any
[1:51:54] two-edged sword
[1:51:56] it's discerning and Only God has the
[1:52:01] ability to discern brothers and sisters
[1:52:03] and in our day I think it's so beautiful
[1:52:06] we can see that God discerned and
[1:52:08] sometimes I I know I've taken it for
[1:52:10] granted when you listen to a prayer line
[1:52:13] you listen to uh
[1:52:16] uh a message or a tape and and you hear
[1:52:19] Brother Branham at the end of it talk to
[1:52:21] people and tell them
[1:52:23] your name is so and so would you believe
[1:52:26] if I was able to tell you where you come
[1:52:28] from if I was able to tell you why you
[1:52:31] came here
[1:52:32] here we have a man standing there and
[1:52:34] and Discerning but sometimes I think
[1:52:37] it's good just to step back take a step
[1:52:39] back and listen to that and recognize
[1:52:41] that wasn't a man speaking no man can do
[1:52:45] that we know there's been a lot of false
[1:52:47] impersonations that have risen up in
[1:52:49] light of that but that was simply God
[1:52:52] through a man talking to people how
[1:52:54] could he do it over and over and over
[1:52:56] again and never be wrong
[1:52:58] never
[1:53:01] we know that he can't ever be wrong he
[1:53:03] never was wrong
[1:53:05] but you know I just think it's wonderful
[1:53:07] I was having a conversation with my boy
[1:53:08] the other night and it was so beautiful
[1:53:11] I'd never really considered it but
[1:53:13] someone had sent around a video and I I
[1:53:15] would recommend watching it I do
[1:53:17] recommend it from the pulpit on YouTube
[1:53:19] it's called discernment of Secrets of
[1:53:22] people's hearts and Healing The Sick
[1:53:24] it's William Miriam Branham standing on
[1:53:27] stage you can see him talking to people
[1:53:30] and I believe in there he says do you
[1:53:33] feel that
[1:53:34] that's the angel of the Lord
[1:53:37] and he begins to express the thoughts in
[1:53:40] the hearts of the people and he tells
[1:53:42] them their name he tells them their
[1:53:44] address he tells them why they're here
[1:53:46] and and it's so moving and I was able to
[1:53:49] have a conversation with my boy and say
[1:53:51] do you recognize what's happening here
[1:53:52] this isn't a man speaking this is God
[1:53:55] speaking through the man to the people
[1:53:57] that's discernment and it's in our day
[1:54:00] brothers and sisters
[1:54:02] who else has done that for real
[1:54:06] discernment of Secrets of people's
[1:54:08] hearts and Healing The Sick 20th century
[1:54:10] Prophet Chicago campaign they're all on
[1:54:12] YouTube powerful powerful things to see
[1:54:15] some of the only video that you can see
[1:54:17] brother Branham in a service actually
[1:54:20] being used by God sure he was just a man
[1:54:24] but how many men had that gift
[1:54:26] and I would say not even a man
[1:54:29] and and you know what it wasn't just to
[1:54:31] heal people and and to make people feel
[1:54:34] good and to have a great campaign what
[1:54:36] it was was for one purpose and this is
[1:54:38] really where we're getting to we're just
[1:54:40] laying the background for I want to get
[1:54:41] to today we still have a half an hour
[1:54:43] Hallelujah and you know what it was is
[1:54:46] so that the gift could declare the time
[1:54:48] has come brothers and sisters that you
[1:54:50] know it's no longer time to be fed milk
[1:54:53] it's time to eat strong meat it's time
[1:54:55] to recognize the day in which we live in
[1:54:58] Revelations 10 1-7 there's going to be a
[1:55:01] time where there will be time no longer
[1:55:04] where where the mystery is going to be
[1:55:06] history
[1:55:08] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:55:10] seventh angel message when he shall
[1:55:12] begin to sound back in 1948
[1:55:15] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:55:17] of God should be finished
[1:55:20] as he hath declared to his servants the
[1:55:22] prophets
[1:55:23] he's never changed his problem why would
[1:55:25] he change his program why do they come
[1:55:28] up with the idea that a prophet is such
[1:55:29] a fanatical thing God's not going to
[1:55:31] change his program
[1:55:33] heavens and earth will pass away but his
[1:55:35] words will remain that's all that's the
[1:55:37] only thing that will remain like we
[1:55:39] talked about brothers and sisters not
[1:55:41] going to get into it too far but we know
[1:55:43] Revelations 10 1-7 is already fulfilled
[1:55:45] Revelations 8 to 11 is our
[1:55:49] our commission we've been given the
[1:55:52] ability to recognize it take the book
[1:55:54] and eat it and become perfect as your
[1:55:55] father in Heaven is perfect because when
[1:55:57] you read the book you become the book
[1:56:01] let me know that book brothers and
[1:56:02] sisters it's not some intangible book
[1:56:04] it's this book right here this is the
[1:56:06] book right here eat this book
[1:56:08] and you will become perfect
[1:56:11] if you're willing to consume it
[1:56:13] if you take it and you run it through
[1:56:14] the lens of a theological
[1:56:16] study through a theological University
[1:56:19] or college and and you start to pull
[1:56:22] words out and say well this word didn't
[1:56:24] mean that and and that chapter well you
[1:56:27] know it doesn't really apply because
[1:56:28] we've got you know female preachers you
[1:56:32] know what the word of God Paul is the
[1:56:35] one that said it
[1:56:36] not anybody else Paul's the one that
[1:56:39] said it let the women be silent in the
[1:56:41] church I'm not going to go too far with
[1:56:42] that but that's what Paul said
[1:56:45] and everything that brother brownham
[1:56:46] preached
[1:56:48] he said I preach what Paul preached
[1:56:50] and you know what when he saw all of us
[1:56:52] on the other side beyond the curtain of
[1:56:55] time we were screaming we're resting on
[1:56:57] that we believe that that's what we
[1:57:00] believe just the word that Paul preached
[1:57:02] we're not trying to put something
[1:57:03] fanatical or funny together here we just
[1:57:06] believe the word the way Paul preached
[1:57:08] it and you know what's so weird about
[1:57:09] that why can't the church believe that
[1:57:12] because they've missed one thing one
[1:57:15] important thing the Keystone of the
[1:57:16] Bible the name of Jesus Christ water
[1:57:20] baptism true water baptism because if
[1:57:22] you get the true baptism in water you're
[1:57:24] going to have an outward expression of
[1:57:26] the inward Spirit that's inhabiting you
[1:57:28] now and you're going to say Amen to
[1:57:29] every single word you're going to say no
[1:57:31] no no let's get that page and tape it
[1:57:33] back in the Bible let's get a glue stick
[1:57:34] and we're going to glue the other page
[1:57:35] in we're going to fit that chapter back
[1:57:37] in there because it all belongs together
[1:57:39] not one part of it contradicts another
[1:57:41] part
[1:57:43] but here we have the prophet in our day
[1:57:45] brothers and sisters in this message
[1:57:48] I just think it's so beautiful
[1:57:50] highly recommend listening to it I have
[1:57:52] heard but now I have seen
[1:57:56] he starts to tell stories and and it's
[1:57:58] such a beautiful thing he he takes his
[1:58:00] text from here I have heard but now I
[1:58:03] have seen in Job chapter 42 verse 5 I
[1:58:06] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:58:09] ear but now mine eyes see a thee we have
[1:58:14] got to be able to say that ourselves
[1:58:16] brothers and sisters that's why children
[1:58:18] you can't rely on your parents
[1:58:20] experience husbands you can't rely on
[1:58:22] your wives wives you can't rely on your
[1:58:23] husbands it's got to be a personal
[1:58:25] experience that's what the new birth is
[1:58:27] the new birth is Christ revealed to the
[1:58:29] person individually personally and when
[1:58:33] that happens it changes everything about
[1:58:35] us brother Branham in this message he
[1:58:37] starts to tell the story of the little
[1:58:39] fish
[1:58:40] and it's such an insignificant thing but
[1:58:43] I just thought it was so powerful the
[1:58:45] way he talks about it in here I'd just
[1:58:47] talk about a little bit today the story
[1:58:49] of that little fish and how brother Lyle
[1:58:51] was there and he said Jehovah's Witness
[1:58:52] A friend of of the other brother a
[1:58:54] brother of the other brother they're in
[1:58:56] the boat fishing one day and and he
[1:58:58] catches this little Sunfish and and what
[1:59:00] did he do he caught it and they were
[1:59:01] trying to catch bait and they wanted to
[1:59:03] catch some bigger fish but they caught
[1:59:05] this little wood and he didn't want it
[1:59:06] so he just tore the hook out of it and
[1:59:07] threw it up into the into the reeds and
[1:59:10] said little fishy just you know shot
[1:59:12] your last wad too bad it's just a little
[1:59:14] fish who cares and all the way along for
[1:59:17] weeks before this brother Bradham was
[1:59:18] saying I believe the Lord is going to
[1:59:20] raise something from the dead I just
[1:59:22] believe that's going to happen we know
[1:59:23] that his little son Joseph got a hold of
[1:59:26] one of the kittens and they had in the
[1:59:27] house and he squished a kitten and he
[1:59:30] dropped it on its head and the kitten
[1:59:31] died and he said maybe it'll be that
[1:59:32] kitten that will be raised from the dead
[1:59:34] brother random didn't know
[1:59:36] so here they are out fishing the one day
[1:59:38] and what happens this little fish gets
[1:59:40] killed brother Bradham says to him by
[1:59:42] the way you know when you're fishing if
[1:59:43] you just set the hook before the fish
[1:59:45] can actually swallow it with a fly line
[1:59:47] you can actually just unhook it right
[1:59:48] from its jaw you'll catch it right in
[1:59:50] its mouth and you can just unhook it and
[1:59:51] let it swim away and you don't have that
[1:59:53] problem and this man was like ah we do
[1:59:55] it differently down in Texas he didn't
[1:59:57] want to listen to him and anyways that's
[1:59:59] just the story is
[2:00:02] here they are in the boat and brother
[2:00:03] Branham says out of the top of the
[2:00:06] mountain this Whirlwind came down into
[2:00:08] the lake where they were in the boat and
[2:00:10] he said stand to your feet tell that
[2:00:12] little fish to come back to life in the
[2:00:15] name of Jesus now it's so weird that it
[2:00:17] would even be that way and I I think
[2:00:19] about that many times and I think why a
[2:00:21] little fish but the prophet says it in
[2:00:23] this message very clearly it was so that
[2:00:25] he could show that he cares about the
[2:00:28] little things brothers and sisters it
[2:00:31] wasn't so that we could just say oh it's
[2:00:33] just a religious group of guys out there
[2:00:35] and God just came around and because
[2:00:36] they rubbed shoulders maybe they touched
[2:00:39] the prophet something good happened no
[2:00:41] no there is a quickening spirit but it's
[2:00:43] not about that at all he said very
[2:00:44] clearly that it was about God
[2:00:46] demonstrating that he cares about the
[2:00:48] little things so if we think he doesn't
[2:00:50] care about the little things just listen
[2:00:52] to what he says in here you can go and
[2:00:54] listen to it but he says that many a
[2:00:56] child was there in the day of
[2:00:58] Jesus to be prayed for in the day of
[2:01:01] brother Branham to be prayed for many
[2:01:03] times there's many people that needed to
[2:01:05] be prayed for in Jesus day what happened
[2:01:08] to the pool of Bethesda he walked
[2:01:09] through all those people all those
[2:01:11] people needed to be healed everyone was
[2:01:13] there because they needed healing they
[2:01:14] wanted to get in that water when it got
[2:01:16] stirred up and I just can't help but
[2:01:17] think brothers and sisters when we get
[2:01:18] that Pentecostal experience and the
[2:01:20] water start to get stirred up when we
[2:01:22] actually just step into that pool
[2:01:24] anything is possible there's no
[2:01:26] different today than it was there the
[2:01:27] only thing is we just don't have a
[2:01:28] literal pool of water here but we got a
[2:01:30] literal pool of the Holy Ghost here
[2:01:32] and I'll tell you what if you ever feel
[2:01:35] you ever feel it just step into it one
[2:01:37] time and see what happens
[2:01:39] but here we have in this situation in
[2:01:41] brother branham's day many
[2:01:43] children to be prayed for but God chose
[2:01:45] to heal a little fish how do you explain
[2:01:47] that
[2:01:48] it doesn't make any sense does it
[2:01:51] but the battle says why it was to show
[2:01:53] that God looks on the little things
[2:01:54] that's his quote exactly so that God
[2:01:57] could look on the little things
[2:02:00] goes on to say he he used his power
[2:02:03] and put a curse on a tree we talked
[2:02:05] about this just before Easter when when
[2:02:07] Jesus was hungry he and and he hungered
[2:02:09] and he saw that fig tree looked on it
[2:02:11] for figs he wanted to see the fruit on
[2:02:13] that tree
[2:02:14] the one time he walked by that tree that
[2:02:16] tree should have been ready but because
[2:02:18] it wasn't ready what happened he said
[2:02:20] you know what if you're not going to be
[2:02:21] ready for me when I come by and I ask
[2:02:23] from you then never will you put forth
[2:02:25] fruit again we need to make sure we're
[2:02:27] ready when we have the opportunity
[2:02:29] because he might pass by our way
[2:02:31] but he used his power to put a curse on
[2:02:33] a tree began to wither when there was
[2:02:35] people laying everywhere needing that
[2:02:37] healing power but you see he wanted to
[2:02:39] show God's over everything whether it's
[2:02:42] small whether it's big whatever it is
[2:02:45] he's still God over all things over all
[2:02:48] creation this is out of I have heard but
[2:02:51] now I have seen then he goes into
[2:02:54] another story in there I think it's just
[2:02:57] so beautiful I'm just trying to to
[2:02:58] encourage us to recognize brothers and
[2:03:01] sisters he's demonstrating living in the
[2:03:03] third pole it's the spoken word it's the
[2:03:05] voice that we have the voice behind our
[2:03:08] voice is what I'm trying to get at if we
[2:03:11] submit that and surrender it to Satan
[2:03:13] we're putting ourselves behind I think
[2:03:15] that's the biggest hindrance to the
[2:03:17] Bride of Jesus Christ today but if we
[2:03:19] can push aside all of that and say only
[2:03:21] things that are edifying being
[2:03:23] tenderhearted and kind one to another
[2:03:25] not being stupid and not just being
[2:03:28] ridiculous but being tenderhearted and
[2:03:31] kind and recognizing that when someone
[2:03:33] else speaks viciously you know what it's
[2:03:35] just a devil in that person brothers and
[2:03:36] sisters that's what it is let's call it
[2:03:39] what it is it's not your brother it's
[2:03:41] not your sister it's the devil trying to
[2:03:43] get under your skin and God is allowing
[2:03:45] that to happen to see what you're going
[2:03:48] to do about it
[2:03:50] we're living under the spoken word
[2:03:52] condition we've heard it many times and
[2:03:54] we're going to get there today but I'll
[2:03:55] say it right now it's fine and good
[2:03:57] brother Branham says that it was just
[2:03:59] great when Jesus was in the land all the
[2:04:01] signs and wonders but when he sat down
[2:04:03] in one day and said I and my father are
[2:04:05] one then they said oh no now you're
[2:04:07] going too far and we know that William
[2:04:09] Miriam Branham had the same thing in his
[2:04:11] day the priest handed him the book
[2:04:13] didn't he the priest handed him the book
[2:04:16] it was no accident that he could his
[2:04:18] Pages were stuck together that he
[2:04:20] couldn't find the scripture and what
[2:04:22] happened the pre-sanded him the book and
[2:04:24] he he he he read the scripture
[2:04:27] and and he said
[2:04:29] precious words right proceeded from his
[2:04:33] mouth and we know the scripture he he
[2:04:36] turned around and he closed the book and
[2:04:38] he said this day this scripture is
[2:04:41] fulfilled
[2:04:43] and if you listen to that's that message
[2:04:45] so many things he says in their brothers
[2:04:48] and sisters this is later much much
[2:04:50] later than we think going back to where
[2:04:52] we're at today though
[2:04:54] the next story that he goes into is
[2:04:55] about the Three Squirrels
[2:04:57] and and how he was out hunting and there
[2:04:59] was no squirrels around at all
[2:05:02] and while he was sitting there under the
[2:05:04] tree he heard a voice
[2:05:06] and the voice said something to him what
[2:05:08] are you doing
[2:05:10] Why'd You Come here
[2:05:13] what's your plans
[2:05:16] and we know that he told them he said
[2:05:18] I'm out hunting but there's no squirrels
[2:05:20] and I just don't know what to do I think
[2:05:21] I'm gonna have to go home
[2:05:23] but God said to him you want a squirrel
[2:05:25] how many of you want
[2:05:27] and he said I want three here he is
[2:05:30] having this conversation a Madman right
[2:05:33] he's not talking to anybody
[2:05:35] he hears the voice he looks around I
[2:05:36] don't see anybody has anybody else here
[2:05:38] Heard a Voice where you've looked around
[2:05:40] to see has somebody spoken to me God
[2:05:43] does that some people will say oh nobody
[2:05:45] can ever hear an audible voice he's God
[2:05:47] don't ever put him in a box as soon as
[2:05:49] you put him in a box you put a period
[2:05:50] behind them that's where that spirit is
[2:05:52] just going to go and set in the tree
[2:05:53] until you're willing to say that he's
[2:05:55] God
[2:05:57] here we have brother Branham though he's
[2:05:59] out in the woods hunting and so you want
[2:06:01] three squirrels okay how do you want it
[2:06:03] tell me how you want it
[2:06:04] so he gives them okay I think this is
[2:06:08] crazy I think I'm going crazy so I'm
[2:06:09] going to say it's just an absurd thing
[2:06:11] I'll see the squirrel run over there and
[2:06:12] jump up there and it'll sit and look at
[2:06:13] me and sure enough there's the squirrel
[2:06:15] runs over there jumps up there turns
[2:06:17] sets and looks at him and he's like wow
[2:06:19] okay so he shoots the squirrel that's
[2:06:22] one squirrel and and so he's like man
[2:06:25] this is amazing I can't believe this
[2:06:27] just happened and and I think it would
[2:06:28] be amazing and wouldn't be able to
[2:06:30] believe it just happened myself either
[2:06:31] but here we have him saying okay I think
[2:06:34] I'll just head on my way now and what
[2:06:37] happens I'll just read the quotas from
[2:06:38] paragraph 144. he said but you said
[2:06:42] do you doubt what you said
[2:06:44] brothers and sisters going back to what
[2:06:47] I've said I think this is the biggest
[2:06:49] thing that hinders the Bride of Jesus
[2:06:51] Christ Satan Creeps in and causes us to
[2:06:53] doubt and how does it happen we get
[2:06:56] condemnation in our heart we have things
[2:06:58] happen we we fall down in our lives and
[2:07:02] and we start to doubt the things that
[2:07:04] we've said that maybe God will actually
[2:07:05] hear our prayers brothers and sisters
[2:07:08] you're sealed already till the day of
[2:07:09] your Redemption you're already seated in
[2:07:12] Heavenly places if you're in Christ
[2:07:14] Jesus and if you're saying Amen to the
[2:07:16] word you're already there you're already
[2:07:18] seen it in Heavenly places you don't
[2:07:19] have to wait to get somewhere when you
[2:07:21] speak the word it's God speaking
[2:07:25] don't let Satan come around and say oh
[2:07:27] he never heard your prayer
[2:07:29] he saw what you did he knows who you are
[2:07:31] he does know who you are just remind
[2:07:33] Satan that he does know who I am he does
[2:07:37] know that I will be seated with him in
[2:07:39] his throne because that's the promise
[2:07:41] for the laodicean church and remind
[2:07:43] Satan that you're going to be cast alive
[2:07:45] into the Lake of Fire
[2:07:48] he says
[2:07:50] but you said do you doubt what you said
[2:07:53] you said you'd get three
[2:07:56] now where will the next come from can
[2:07:58] you imagine that
[2:08:00] God just anxious saying now what did you
[2:08:02] say well how can I do this for you how I
[2:08:05] just want to make this manifest so
[2:08:06] beautifully for you I just want to
[2:08:08] encourage you so incredibly I want to
[2:08:10] create a story that they'll be preaching
[2:08:12] after you go home
[2:08:15] how can I do this for you
[2:08:16] now where will the next come from
[2:08:19] can you imagine that
[2:08:22] so we know he says it
[2:08:24] I think he says up on a a pull with some
[2:08:27] poison ivy wrapped around it in such a
[2:08:29] an extremely bizarre weird place where a
[2:08:31] squirrel will never be never ever go and
[2:08:34] jump up and poison ivy never be in that
[2:08:36] situation but he says it happened
[2:08:39] there it was jumped out shot it and he
[2:08:42] said I was beginning to rub my eye rub
[2:08:44] my eyes am I losing my mind he goes over
[2:08:46] picks up the squirrel there's a squirrel
[2:08:49] and he says yeah there's blood and he
[2:08:51] throws this in there and he says a
[2:08:53] vision doesn't bleed
[2:08:54] Visions don't bleed brothers and sisters
[2:08:56] if you've ever shot anything you'll
[2:08:58] understand
[2:09:00] so then he says wow I've got three two
[2:09:02] squirrels here and this is just blowing
[2:09:04] my mind he wants to give them to me
[2:09:06] exactly how I want him and he's gonna go
[2:09:08] home now but he said you said three do
[2:09:11] you doubt what you said
[2:09:13] how many times do we doubt what we say
[2:09:17] he says I said no Lord I don't tell what
[2:09:20] I said
[2:09:21] for your confirming
[2:09:25] this is one scripture that stumped me he
[2:09:27] says not if I say
[2:09:31] but if you say
[2:09:34] not if Jesus said it
[2:09:37] but if you say it yourself
[2:09:41] but if you say it yourself
[2:09:44] and I thought somehow I broke into that
[2:09:47] channel and I I know he's here because
[2:09:49] I'm almost beside myself
[2:09:52] I thought I'll make this one ridiculous
[2:09:54] and sure enough
[2:09:57] and you know I'm not gonna go any more
[2:09:59] into that but he walked home with three
[2:10:01] squirrels and he says right after that
[2:10:03] what happened Satan came on on him Satan
[2:10:06] said to him he didn't come on him but he
[2:10:08] said Satan said to him oh look there's
[2:10:10] squirrels everywhere in the forest now
[2:10:12] when there wasn't squirrels before to
[2:10:14] try and say that's where you got your
[2:10:15] squirrels from they're all always here
[2:10:17] but there were no squirrels there and he
[2:10:19] said that very clearly he waited all
[2:10:21] morning and there was nothing then
[2:10:22] suddenly he's got three squirrels
[2:10:24] suddenly Satan is right there saying oh
[2:10:26] it wasn't what you think it was it was
[2:10:28] just they were here all along that's the
[2:10:29] way Satan Works brothers and sisters
[2:10:31] when God drops a blessing in our lap
[2:10:33] Satan's going to come around and say oh
[2:10:34] look at how good you are look what you
[2:10:36] did look at how this came together he's
[2:10:38] going to do anything and everything he
[2:10:40] can to get us to doubt
[2:10:42] but here we have the prophet of God
[2:10:44] saying God's saying to the prophet did
[2:10:46] you doubt what you said
[2:10:49] and this is where it gets real good and
[2:10:51] we probably know where this is going how
[2:10:53] he was sitting around a dinner table
[2:10:55] just sitting around with Believers at a
[2:10:58] dinner table
[2:10:59] at the right residence
[2:11:01] they're just eating cherry cobbler boy
[2:11:04] I'd like to try that sometime that
[2:11:06] sounds really good
[2:11:07] sitting around eating cherry cobbler
[2:11:09] drinking coffee talking about the word
[2:11:10] and and here we have the prophet of God
[2:11:13] saying I don't understand this I just
[2:11:15] don't understand it and he talks to
[2:11:17] brother woods and and the other brothers
[2:11:19] that are there around the table and he
[2:11:21] says you're expert squirrel Hunters
[2:11:23] have you ever seen a squirrel on those
[2:11:26] trees have you ever seen a squirrel
[2:11:27] behave that way have you ever seen
[2:11:29] anything like this before and they all
[2:11:31] agreed no no and while they're talking
[2:11:33] about it the sister has something in her
[2:11:36] heart that says that ain't nothing but
[2:11:38] the truth
[2:11:40] and here maybe this is just like a
[2:11:42] buzzword story kind of thing and I don't
[2:11:44] want it to be that way brothers and
[2:11:45] sisters I want it to be recognize your
[2:11:48] day and its message recognize that your
[2:11:51] voice has more power than I think we
[2:11:53] think many times I want to say it this
[2:11:55] way there was a sister sitting in the
[2:11:58] service right over here one time on a
[2:12:00] regular Wednesday night and she said the
[2:12:03] right thing in her heart brothers and
[2:12:05] sisters during a worship service not at
[2:12:08] the preaching of the word in worship she
[2:12:10] stood up when that voice said to her
[2:12:12] stand up and receive the healing of your
[2:12:15] breast cancer and what happened to her
[2:12:17] she received it in the name of Jesus
[2:12:19] Christ
[2:12:22] if anybody's got a question I've got her
[2:12:24] name and number we can pass it on to you
[2:12:26] and let her tell you but she was healed
[2:12:29] she received it she said be it unto me
[2:12:32] according to Thy word nobody told her to
[2:12:35] stand up
[2:12:36] if you hear that voice brothers and
[2:12:38] sisters if you have a need in your heart
[2:12:40] don't let anybody tell you anything
[2:12:42] you take that word at face value and
[2:12:45] stand up and receive it in the name of
[2:12:47] Jesus
[2:12:49] sister Addie right
[2:12:51] she said the right thing brother Bradham
[2:12:53] said
[2:12:54] I said they had they they just wasn't
[2:12:56] there
[2:12:59] I said the only thing I know
[2:13:01] it's just the same God
[2:13:04] when Abraham needed a ram
[2:13:07] he was Jehovah jira
[2:13:09] he could provide for himself
[2:13:13] I said I believe it's the same thing
[2:13:16] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:13:18] forever brothers and sisters what's your
[2:13:20] need
[2:13:21] what's your cry
[2:13:23] what's your desire today
[2:13:26] to come to church because you've got
[2:13:28] something on your heart
[2:13:30] if you do he's more than able to meet at
[2:13:32] brothers and sisters
[2:13:34] [Applause]
[2:13:36] he was Jehovah Jireh he could provide
[2:13:38] for himself I said I believe it's the
[2:13:41] same thing
[2:13:43] and little old Hattie sitting back there
[2:13:45] said brother Branham that ain't nothing
[2:13:46] but the truth
[2:13:48] she said the right thing
[2:13:50] when she said that the Holy Spirit
[2:13:53] dropped over in that channel again
[2:13:56] every one of them felt it
[2:14:00] don't go tell me that you can't feel it
[2:14:03] this business that the Holy Ghost is
[2:14:05] without sensation it's true when you get
[2:14:08] the Holy Ghost it's without sensation
[2:14:11] but I'll tell you what when you get
[2:14:13] close to the Lord Jesus Christ you feel
[2:14:15] them all over you
[2:14:17] brother Branham said you feel like dying
[2:14:19] we know that Eddie Biscoe said the same
[2:14:22] thing I feel like dying when I was in
[2:14:23] the car and the angel of the Lord came
[2:14:25] in between us
[2:14:27] says the Holy Spirit dropped in over
[2:14:30] that channel again and every one of them
[2:14:31] felt it I raised up and said sister
[2:14:34] Hattie thus saith the Lord you said the
[2:14:38] word like the seraphenician woman said
[2:14:42] the Holy Spirit speaking to me now and
[2:14:45] said for me to give you the desire of
[2:14:48] your heart
[2:14:51] I said now if I be God's servant if it
[2:14:54] is it'll happen
[2:14:57] if I ain't God's servant then I'm a liar
[2:15:00] and it won't happen I'm a Deceiver
[2:15:04] all you got to do is listen to this guy
[2:15:06] you just have to listen to what he says
[2:15:10] I would be a deceiver I said now try and
[2:15:13] see it's the spirit of God or not
[2:15:16] foreign
[2:15:17] and we know the story all so well
[2:15:21] he said to her if you you're broke you
[2:15:23] need money you're poor people if you
[2:15:26] want money speak the word
[2:15:29] your sister she's been sick her whole
[2:15:31] life we've prayed for her her whole life
[2:15:33] here we have the prophet of God saying
[2:15:34] we prayed for her her whole life she's
[2:15:37] sick in the wheelchair and she still
[2:15:38] doesn't come out the prophet of God Amen
[2:15:41] amen and there she was still sick
[2:15:44] how can that be
[2:15:46] but here we have
[2:15:48] money
[2:15:50] you sister
[2:15:52] what is it you want
[2:15:54] and we know it very well she only asked
[2:15:56] for one thing and that was the only
[2:15:57] thing of Eternal value her son's son
[2:15:59] sitting over there in the corner
[2:16:00] snickering regular Little Ricky's
[2:16:02] brother Brandon said just snickering and
[2:16:04] laughing about what they were talking
[2:16:05] about but what happened when she said
[2:16:08] the salvation of my sons they both came
[2:16:10] and fell right over they got baptism of
[2:16:13] the Holy Spirit right there in that
[2:16:15] meeting
[2:16:18] and I just think it's beautiful you
[2:16:19] might think I'm maybe a little bit crazy
[2:16:21] to say this you know talking about
[2:16:23] cherry cobbler I'm going to throw that
[2:16:24] plug in there again for my wife wink
[2:16:26] wink nudge nudge drinking coffee sitting
[2:16:28] around the table but brothers and
[2:16:30] sisters we might think that's just
[2:16:31] ordinary Fellowship don't be surprised
[2:16:34] if the Holy Spirit just drops in your
[2:16:36] fellowship one day and he gives you the
[2:16:38] desires of your heart because he's the
[2:16:40] same yesterday today and forever but if
[2:16:43] we get ourselves in the way
[2:16:45] we're just going to say well no it's got
[2:16:47] to be some great religious thing right
[2:16:48] it's got to be some certain way I I I'm
[2:16:51] used to the way that it's supposed to be
[2:16:53] we've got a tradition about the way it
[2:16:55] should happen if we do that we're going
[2:16:57] to put a period behind God he could come
[2:17:00] right now he could come at your lunch
[2:17:01] table this afternoon he could come and
[2:17:03] visit you at supper he could come and
[2:17:05] visit you in the lunchroom at work
[2:17:07] tomorrow we don't know just give them
[2:17:09] the Liberty to do it and watch him do it
[2:17:13] my goodness
[2:17:16] it's when it's revealed to you though
[2:17:18] that's when it becomes important that's
[2:17:20] when it becomes real it's got to be to
[2:17:23] you personally brother Bradham brings it
[2:17:24] out in this message so clearly oh my
[2:17:27] I've heard about it my whole entire life
[2:17:29] sometimes when we're a message kid we've
[2:17:31] only ever been fed the pure word we've
[2:17:33] heard about it our whole entire lives
[2:17:35] but it's got to become real to us
[2:17:37] individually and you know what when that
[2:17:39] happens brothers and sisters it don't
[2:17:41] matter if you've gone out into the world
[2:17:43] and you've come back doesn't matter what
[2:17:45] you've gone through when it's become
[2:17:46] real to you you don't care who's
[2:17:48] watching when you worship you don't care
[2:17:50] what you look like you don't care about
[2:17:53] none of the other things in this world
[2:17:54] except for that one thing the pearl of
[2:17:56] great price
[2:17:59] when it's been revealed to you but it's
[2:18:01] got to be to you
[2:18:04] brother Branham says and it won't work
[2:18:06] no selfish thing will work
[2:18:09] your motives and objectives has to be
[2:18:11] exactly perfectly right then you have
[2:18:14] faith to ask
[2:18:16] if our hearts condemn us not then we
[2:18:18] have confidence see and that's really
[2:18:20] the biggest thing brothers and sisters
[2:18:22] we just get this lack of confidence and
[2:18:24] I'm talking about myself when I say this
[2:18:26] I've done it many times and like I said
[2:18:28] when I went down to North Carolina I was
[2:18:30] having a conversation with brother Daryl
[2:18:31] Ward and it might sound so Elementary
[2:18:33] and silly and forgive me if I'm a pastor
[2:18:37] and this is my walk but we all are
[2:18:39] growing we're all on a journey brothers
[2:18:40] and sisters but it just became so clear
[2:18:43] to me I was talking about my son how we
[2:18:46] went into a prayer line Brother Kelly's
[2:18:48] Church in grenthal Saskatchewan and we
[2:18:51] tried we applied for life insurance for
[2:18:52] our youngest son we wanted to get life
[2:18:55] insurance for him it's the cheapest time
[2:18:56] to buy it when they're young when
[2:18:57] they're first born so we apply for life
[2:18:59] insurance and he had something wrong
[2:19:01] with his lungs he had an infection in
[2:19:02] his lungs the first year he was in the
[2:19:04] hospital with pneumonia the second year
[2:19:06] he was in the hospital with pneumonia
[2:19:08] the third year he was in the hospital
[2:19:10] with pneumonia over and over again and
[2:19:14] they said you know what because of that
[2:19:15] we're not going to give you life
[2:19:17] insurance for him and what does that do
[2:19:19] to a parent's thinking
[2:19:21] that does something serious you start to
[2:19:24] think whoa if they're not going to
[2:19:25] insure a baby what does that mean is he
[2:19:27] not going to live so then the Devil
[2:19:29] comes around and starts talking so the
[2:19:31] parents start praying we went to a
[2:19:33] prayer line in Saskatchewan grenthal
[2:19:35] Saskatchewan brother Daryl Ward was
[2:19:36] there this isn't to glorify the man it's
[2:19:38] to tell you the story of how I've grown
[2:19:40] and learned and so we go there and we
[2:19:43] got prayed for and he got healed
[2:19:45] he got 100 healed he hasn't had
[2:19:49] pneumonia since but brother Daryl Ward
[2:19:51] told him just go on saying I'm Healed he
[2:19:55] was talking to a four-year-old boy at
[2:19:56] the time
[2:19:58] so here I am now many years later three
[2:20:01] years four years later down in North
[2:20:03] Carolina just having a coffee
[2:20:05] conversation with brother Daryl Ward and
[2:20:07] and I said yeah you know you remember
[2:20:09] you prayed for my son there and and I'm
[2:20:11] sorry because I seem to say it every
[2:20:12] single time but it's real significant to
[2:20:14] me every time I meet you I just can't
[2:20:16] help but give God the glory because
[2:20:18] you're the guy that God used and it's
[2:20:20] just such a wonderful thing and he said
[2:20:22] to me you know what brother I can't do
[2:20:24] nothing it's only God that heals
[2:20:27] and you just have to allow God to do the
[2:20:29] work all you do is pray the prayer of
[2:20:32] faith
[2:20:33] and it sounds so Elementary but it
[2:20:35] clicked for me I just need to be in my
[2:20:37] position when I'm in my position just
[2:20:39] worrying about me just minding me then
[2:20:41] God can do his thing but when I'm there
[2:20:43] trying to jump up and down and anoint
[2:20:45] with oil and scream and shout and make
[2:20:47] it happen God's not going to do it
[2:20:49] brother Branham says it you could dump a
[2:20:51] gallon of oil and you could shout till
[2:20:53] your horse you're gonna move a devil oh
[2:20:56] my but if you just simply speak the word
[2:20:58] by faith speak the word from your
[2:21:00] position and just see if God won't move
[2:21:03] brother Adam says and it won't work no
[2:21:05] selfish thing will work your motives and
[2:21:07] objectives has to be exactly perfectly
[2:21:09] right then you have faith to ask if our
[2:21:12] hearts condemn us not then we have
[2:21:13] confidence see see we've got to have
[2:21:16] confidence I want this to the honor and
[2:21:19] glory of God then faith has a channel to
[2:21:22] move into
[2:21:23] if it doesn't then you've got mental
[2:21:26] intellectual faith and not genuine Faith
[2:21:30] from God
[2:21:31] and I think brothers and sisters there's
[2:21:32] been times in my life where I've had
[2:21:34] mental intellectual faith and this is
[2:21:37] what I'm getting to it's so beautiful
[2:21:38] because I just believe God's made this
[2:21:41] so real to me and it's no longer up to
[2:21:43] me
[2:21:44] I just need to have confidence towards
[2:21:46] God that's all just have confidence
[2:21:48] towards him that he could come on the
[2:21:49] scene anytime anywhere and all I've got
[2:21:51] to do is just say Amen to the word and
[2:21:53] let him do the work he says that
[2:21:55] intellectual faith will get you nowhere
[2:21:57] might get you emotional but it won't get
[2:21:59] you to the healing that you're looking
[2:22:01] for
[2:22:03] so job checking himself with the genuine
[2:22:05] faith that God had give to him that he
[2:22:09] was just that he had done everything
[2:22:11] that God required him to do now when
[2:22:13] we're going to be prayed for for our
[2:22:16] sickness I wonder if we have done
[2:22:18] everything
[2:22:19] that God requires us to do
[2:22:23] and I just want to pause there for a
[2:22:25] second and say it again now when we're
[2:22:27] going to be prayed for I wonder prayer
[2:22:30] prayed for our sickness I wonder if we
[2:22:32] have done everything that God requires
[2:22:34] us to do have we followed every iota of
[2:22:39] the scripture
[2:22:40] have we give them our hearts and lives
[2:22:42] to service
[2:22:44] and you know brothers and sisters I want
[2:22:45] to say this if we have anything in our
[2:22:48] lives that's residual that's just been
[2:22:50] swept under the rug from years ago and
[2:22:52] maybe we got a little bit of a callus in
[2:22:54] our our heart I heard something this
[2:22:57] week that I thought was really
[2:22:58] interesting I don't know if I've ever
[2:23:00] heard it before is where pearls come
[2:23:02] from pearls come from a grain of sand
[2:23:04] getting inside one of those clams
[2:23:07] whatever it is and and that sand the way
[2:23:10] it gets around in there and it causes
[2:23:12] this this this turmoil inside the
[2:23:14] creature and that's what causes the
[2:23:16] Pearl and the context that it was
[2:23:17] brought up was those great pearly gates
[2:23:19] in Heaven 12 of them and the reason
[2:23:22] they're pearls is because of the
[2:23:24] tremendous trial the tremendous Agony
[2:23:27] that people went through just like a
[2:23:29] little Pearl that we would see is a
[2:23:30] grain of sand inside a little animal
[2:23:33] but if we've got the little tiny grain
[2:23:35] of sand inside of our hearts somewhere
[2:23:36] brothers and sisters the devil knows it
[2:23:38] and we know it and God knows it and
[2:23:40] we're not going to get what we want
[2:23:41] there's going to be something there
[2:23:43] standing in the way of our prayers we
[2:23:44] have got to come as the prophet said
[2:23:46] having every iota of the scripture
[2:23:49] followed in our lives have we give him
[2:23:51] our hearts and lives to service what is
[2:23:54] the reason you want to be healed
[2:23:56] that's what the prophet says it's
[2:23:57] interesting isn't it what's the reason
[2:23:59] you want to be healed that would even go
[2:24:01] so further as to say it was actually God
[2:24:03] saying that through the prophet what's
[2:24:04] the reason you want to be healed that's
[2:24:07] the reason you can't get Faith enough
[2:24:08] see because you haven't maybe made this
[2:24:10] thing to God sincerely from your heart
[2:24:13] like Hezekiah did give God the reason he
[2:24:15] wanted to set his kingdom in order and
[2:24:17] God sent his Prophet back and told him
[2:24:19] and he'd be healed see but you have to
[2:24:22] have those things made right first
[2:24:25] we can't have any lingering things there
[2:24:27] can't be anything swept under the rug it
[2:24:29] made me think about Aiken and the
[2:24:30] children of Israel he wanted that
[2:24:32] Babylonian garment and the and the wedge
[2:24:34] of gold and took it and hid it under his
[2:24:36] camp in his in his house and we know
[2:24:38] that him and his whole entire family
[2:24:39] perished for it Brothers as husbands
[2:24:42] We've Got No Room for anything to be
[2:24:44] hidden in our lives our wives mothers
[2:24:47] we've got no room in our lives for
[2:24:48] anything to be hidden we've got to be
[2:24:50] able to declare it all to God give it
[2:24:52] all to him
[2:24:54] brother random goes on to say so then as
[2:24:56] soon as you get to these places and know
[2:24:58] that it's been revealed to you by the
[2:25:00] word of God by the Revelation by the
[2:25:02] word that God requires you to do then
[2:25:06] you have faith genuine Faith but it
[2:25:09] takes a bit of work to get there we've
[2:25:11] got to really go in and clean things out
[2:25:13] and not have any room for anything to
[2:25:15] linger
[2:25:16] we can't have any grudges we can't have
[2:25:19] any any past hurts there can't be any
[2:25:21] calluses that we can say this thing
[2:25:24] happened to me and and I just can't get
[2:25:26] past it if we do that God's gonna say
[2:25:29] what happened to me
[2:25:30] I came and gave my entire life
[2:25:34] we need to make sure that we're willing
[2:25:35] to give him our all
[2:25:40] boy oh boy
[2:25:43] so many times I wonder how will I ever
[2:25:44] have enough
[2:25:46] but there's always too much
[2:25:49] you know there has to be a time brothers
[2:25:50] and sisters where this becomes real to
[2:25:52] us brother Branham says now we're
[2:25:54] promised a church age
[2:25:57] through reformers and we've had them but
[2:25:59] he promised in Malachi 4 that he'd keep
[2:26:01] his pattern in the last days
[2:26:04] what would take place to turn the hearts
[2:26:07] of the children back to the faith of the
[2:26:09] apostolic father
[2:26:11] for that very purpose
[2:26:14] and the church is so broke up in
[2:26:16] denominations and isms
[2:26:18] so tore to Pieces till it's dead
[2:26:22] it's been a carrier
[2:26:25] and then he promised in the hour of the
[2:26:28] seventh Angel's message
[2:26:29] the Seven Seals would be revealed and
[2:26:32] the mysteries of God would be declared
[2:26:34] Revelations 10 when the seventh angel
[2:26:37] begins to sound his message
[2:26:39] not the healing service
[2:26:42] the message that follows the healing
[2:26:44] service
[2:26:45] not the first and second polls but the
[2:26:48] third poll brothers and sisters that I
[2:26:50] and my father as one are one this is the
[2:26:53] Spoken Word season that we live in Jesus
[2:26:56] was a great guy as long as he could heal
[2:26:58] the sick
[2:26:59] but he said when I and my father are one
[2:27:02] that's when everything changed that's
[2:27:04] when it became a problem for him
[2:27:07] you know brothers and sisters I just
[2:27:08] want to encourage us
[2:27:10] today
[2:27:12] maybe I'll call the musicians
[2:27:15] all of the mechanics have been here
[2:27:17] but I want to say all the Dynamics are
[2:27:20] as well
[2:27:21] we have both
[2:27:23] we're not lacking either
[2:27:27] personally I feel the only thing we've
[2:27:29] got that's hindering the bride body of
[2:27:31] Jesus Christ is our words
[2:27:35] and the world that we live in is totally
[2:27:38] set up to be negative one hundred
[2:27:40] percent
[2:27:42] you know brother Bradham he says it in
[2:27:44] uh oh my I can't remember what the
[2:27:46] message is I I just bounced around and
[2:27:48] listen to so many of them but you know
[2:27:50] in the beginning of one of the messages
[2:27:52] um he says you know I just I just really
[2:27:55] hope I I don't become I think it's one
[2:27:58] of the worst things as a human being to
[2:28:00] become a crowded old person that's just
[2:28:03] angry and bitter and if we're not
[2:28:05] careful brothers and sisters if we let
[2:28:06] things linger we're going to have that
[2:28:08] grain of sand inside the inside and it's
[2:28:11] just going to work around and it's going
[2:28:12] to turn into a highly polished Stone
[2:28:14] because it's going to come out it's
[2:28:16] going to be expressed in our lives but
[2:28:18] if we're not careful it's going to be a
[2:28:20] very difficult thing to get out of us
[2:28:22] and I think I could be wrong but I think
[2:28:24] that the clams or whatever the animals
[2:28:26] are that grow pearls I don't think they
[2:28:28] live to give up their pearls I think
[2:28:30] they have to die to give up their pearls
[2:28:32] you know we've got all the mechanics and
[2:28:34] we've got all the Dynamics the only
[2:28:36] thing we need to do is just get
[2:28:37] ourselves out of the way
[2:28:39] first John chapter 3 where if our heart
[2:28:42] condemn us not
[2:28:44] God if our heart condemn us sorry God is
[2:28:47] greater than our heart
[2:28:48] and knoweth all things
[2:28:51] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[2:28:54] we have confidence toward God
[2:28:57] that's where I think I want I just want
[2:28:58] to say it again maybe stand with me as
[2:29:00] we close brothers and sisters when we
[2:29:03] don't have a good feeling about maybe
[2:29:06] something that we've have in our lives
[2:29:07] just remember you're already seated in
[2:29:09] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're
[2:29:11] not seeing how many places here in
[2:29:13] Calgary Living Word assembly in these
[2:29:15] chairs that were purchased at one time
[2:29:17] you see that in Heavenly places
[2:29:18] spiritually speaking because you believe
[2:29:20] the word of God for your day
[2:29:23] and that alone
[2:29:25] should mean that your heart doesn't
[2:29:27] condemn you
[2:29:28] Satan wants to say that your heart
[2:29:29] condemns you Satan wants me to say that
[2:29:31] my heart condemns me that I'm not seen
[2:29:33] in Heavenly places I know what I did I
[2:29:36] know what I said I know what I looked at
[2:29:38] I know all about it I know all the
[2:29:41] things in my life my shortcomings those
[2:29:42] words that were uttered that should
[2:29:44] never have been said but were
[2:29:46] boy
[2:29:48] but if we can just look past that like I
[2:29:50] said once upon a time if we could look
[2:29:52] at our problems our shortcomings if we
[2:29:54] could look at ourselves the way that he
[2:29:56] looks at us
[2:29:57] through that Pillar of Fire
[2:29:59] if we could do that brothers and sisters
[2:30:01] we would see that we're already seated
[2:30:02] Heavenly places we're already perfect
[2:30:04] because we accept the word for our day
[2:30:06] that's what gives us Perfection is that
[2:30:08] we believe
[2:30:10] and whatsoever we ask of him we receive
[2:30:13] of him because we keep his Commandments
[2:30:14] and do those things which are Pleasant
[2:30:16] in a sight
[2:30:18] I just think it's so beautiful
[2:30:20] we have the ability brothers and sisters
[2:30:23] just to have this word to recognize that
[2:30:27] even though we've heard it and heard it
[2:30:29] and heard it
[2:30:30] there Comes A Time in our lives where we
[2:30:32] can say now I see and I would recommend
[2:30:35] if you want to just hear the expanded
[2:30:38] version is just listen to that message
[2:30:39] that I was referring to I have heard but
[2:30:42] now I've seen in 1965 brother Branham he
[2:30:44] just expresses those stories so much
[2:30:46] better than I did and he explains to us
[2:30:49] that it's up to us to speak the word
[2:30:51] because when we speak words like that
[2:30:53] brothers and sisters we're always going
[2:30:54] to speak the word according to the word
[2:30:55] we're never going to get outside of the
[2:30:57] word you don't have to be afraid of that
[2:30:59] the devil wants us to be afraid of that
[2:31:01] and say it's fanatical maybe we'll say
[2:31:02] something wrong maybe we'll cause
[2:31:04] something terrible to happen that's not
[2:31:05] going to happen we won't do that
[2:31:09] anyways I'll stop talking I just want to
[2:31:11] say God bless you don't be discouraged
[2:31:13] be encouraged
[2:31:15] and just believe the word and that will
[2:31:17] cause you to be a nuisance to the devil
[2:31:20] let's just bow in prayer
[2:31:22] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love
[2:31:24] you and we thank you for your word thank
[2:31:26] you Father for the Vindicated Prophet
[2:31:29] that you sent Lord to show this world
[2:31:31] that Lord you have come Lord we know
[2:31:35] that there is a coming and there is an
[2:31:37] appearing and we'll get into that but
[2:31:39] father we just want to thank you for
[2:31:41] giving us your word Lord for giving us
[2:31:44] the ability to receive your word in the
[2:31:46] day in which we live because we
[2:31:48] recognize by doing that Lord we will
[2:31:50] come according to your word and when we
[2:31:52] come according to your word then we
[2:31:54] receive your spirit and when we receive
[2:31:56] your spirit Lord Jesus you live out
[2:31:58] through us and we no longer have
[2:31:59] condemnation in our lives
[2:32:02] father I pray that you would just go
[2:32:04] with each one of us as we go our
[2:32:05] separate way today and father let us
[2:32:07] feel you
[2:32:09] or Jesus don't let us get caught up with
[2:32:12] some dogmatic theory that we don't feel
[2:32:15] you we know the the story and we know
[2:32:18] the the way people have brought it and
[2:32:19] spun it but Lord Jesus we know your
[2:32:22] Prophet you said through the prophet
[2:32:24] that Pentecost is not a denomination
[2:32:26] it's an experience father I pray that we
[2:32:30] could have a Pentecostal experience in
[2:32:32] our lives Lord we're not going back to
[2:32:34] Pentecost we're marching on to Zion and
[2:32:37] father we know that as we March forward
[2:32:39] and as we shout the name of Jesus Christ
[2:32:41] all around the enemy's walls they fall
[2:32:44] down flat
[2:32:46] father we pray that you would just go
[2:32:48] with us now as we go our separate ways
[2:32:50] that you would be glorified in every
[2:32:51] aspect of Our Lives Lord in our homes
[2:32:54] and our families in our jobs Lord let us
[2:32:57] speak good words father let us speak
[2:32:59] encouraging things father let us be kind
[2:33:02] and tenderhearted one to another
[2:33:05] recognizing that father we're not going
[2:33:07] to grieve your spirit we're going to
[2:33:09] encourage your spirit between us Lord
[2:33:11] that the world around us would be able
[2:33:13] to say that truly they are Christians
[2:33:16] because not because they say they love
[2:33:18] you because they love one another father
[2:33:20] we just love you and we thank you for
[2:33:22] your goodness to us we just ask all
[2:33:24] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[2:33:26] we pray amen amen
[2:33:31] thank you
