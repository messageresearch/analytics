though it's overcast and the leaves aren't all the way out we know that it's very green and the sun is shining somewhere real close to here we have a few prayer requests that we'd like to bring before the church this morning brother Paul and sister Elaine have contracted covid and they're at home with it quarantining going through the hole whole rigmarole that we're doing in our lives now and uh you know the song that we just sang it really sums it up how we've learned to trust in Jesus and and how we trust him more and how do we do that by the trials that he brings that's how we learn to trust in him we don't learn to trust in him by just simply going to church and simply reading the scripture and simply saying that I believe we know we've said it before many times talk is cheap it's when we can actually believe in the Valley of the situation that's when it shows Who We Are it's pretty easy to believe when we're on the mountaintops we're just so thankful that brother Paul and sister Elaine aren't really sick they've indicated that it's like a bad cold or even just like a mild cold I think it's not a terrible thing for them well trust that the Lord will just continue watching over them that the angel of the Lord will just stay right there at Wood Glen Place just long enough to restore their strength and bring them back again let's just uh let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're just so thankful for your grace and your mercy in each one of our Lives Lord every single one of us we all rely upon that very same Grace that you have bestowed upon your children Lord there's not one of us that has any special favor with you because you're not a respecter of persons you are a respecter of your word and father I pray Lord we pray this morning a special prayer that your children would be found speaking your word Lord we're in a spoken word condition we're in an age that hasn't been since before the foundation of the world this is the age of the coming of the Lord your Prophet said that he's not looking for a Revival but he's looking for the coming of the Lord and Lord Jesus we know that that's already happened so father we just thank you we recognize the position that we in we're in and father we just want to give you all the opportunity to move in our midst in our lives father we pray for brother Paul and sister Elaine that you would just restore their strength that you would just cast out all fear that perfect love would reign in their lives Lord Jesus that you would just pick them up on the wings of the eagle and that you would just cast out all fear and doubt Lord that there would be no room for Satan to have any part in what's happening there Lord Jesus that you would just heal their bodies and restore their strength and bring them back to all that they need to be doing father in their business with their family and in the church and Lord Jesus anyone else with the need this morning rather maybe they could make it known unto you with an uplifted hand even while we pray Lord that you would just meet that need sovereignly we all have needs you've created us this way so that we could trust you more father because you have met so many times every single one of us has so many testimonies of how you've met the needs in our lives father we know that there's people right now in the congregation that need jobs father we have to we we have to work we have to provide for our families we can't just stay at home and do nothing we have to be able to pay our bills in this life Lord we know we know that you know that father I pray that each one with that need in their lives would just speak that word that there would be no fear that there'd be no room for Satan to come around and try and tempt them and and make them feel any other way than a son or a daughter of God because we know that you already have a job waiting for them they just need to trust in you father we pray that we could all just trust in you more we ask that you would meet each and every need this morning Father according to the the faith that you have given each one of us and Lord we pray that if we're lacking in faith that Lord we could just raise up our cups unto you that we could just raise our hand unto you and say Lord here's my cup it's a little empty father just just fill it up for me Lord Jesus just quench that longing in my soul father let me look to you before I Look to any worldly means Lord Jesus that you would be the satisfying portion in my life because your word says to seek ye first the kingdom of God then all the other things would be added unto you father I pray that you would just meet each and every need represented this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen before we get into the word this morning can we sing that song number 42 fill my cup Lord [Music] fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul foreign [Music] Lord [Music] that's why we're here today fill my cup upload I lift it up Oh Come and quench this thirsting of my soul Bread of Heaven feed me till I want no more here's my cup fill it up and make me home Hallelujah you have your Bibles this morning thank you musicians so wonderful to have musicians to be able to sing unto the Lord if you could turn to the gospel of Saint John chapter 1. and then we'll turn over to the book of Colossians chapter one what a tremendous day it is that we live in here certainly an honor and a privilege to understand the day that we live and that it's no ordinary day we've been spending a fair bit of time in the Book of John I believe there's just so very much in here today I'd like to read just from verse 12. of John chapter 1. to verse 18 and then over in the book of Colossians chapter 1. verse 12. but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh then dwelt Among Us and we beheld sorry and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have we have all we received and Grace for Grace but the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him let's turn over to Colossians now Colossians chapter one just two verses verse 26 and verse 27. very familiar scriptures even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but is now made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful for your word we're so thankful for a pure revelation of your word Lord for the opening of your word for sending us a prophet Lord that would be an instrument in your hand so that you could speak to us Lord we're thankful for your fivefold ministry Lord that would submit themselves unto your word that would surrender themselves unto the message of the hour and preach the truth Lord we're just so thankful that we can be the culmination of all of the ages in you we pray Lord Jesus that you would just take this word now and break it to us fresh once again that your children would be fed today help me Lord Jesus to just step aside and give you the preeminence that you desire speak that which you want spoken Lord Jesus we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you this morning you may have your seats we know that a few people in our congregation now have encountered this covid and uh we're certainly thankful for the healing touch of the Lord every one of us has a testimony of a miracle in our lives many people would say well science comes on the scene and helps us and yes indeed science does but we know that vaccine only comes because God allows it the only reason that there's science that actually helps us is because God imparts that wisdom into man Satan wants to destroy God wants to heal when we when we look at things in our lives we can easily get confused I think and and start to mix things up in a way that can can make God look like he's putting things on us and and make it look like Satan is going to heal Us by the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the only reason that there is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is because God placed it there in the garden that's the only reason it's not because of anything that Satan can do Satan is not a big monster remember there's coming a time and it's a scripture where men will walk by and see Satan on the sides of the pit and say that is the man that caused all of the anxiety throughout all of the ages that's what did it right there and wag their heads and walk away because he will have no power he will be powerless and and that time will come but brothers and sisters spiritually speaking that time is now and we have a prophet that brought that to us but we're so thankful for the Lord's Healing Touch in our lives every one of us has a testimony of times in our lives when we've been sick and we're no longer sick it's because God heals us what a mighty God we serve I just was thinking about this you know and how easy it can be to get caught up in fear and to think about how well people are dying because of covet and and all the different things and if something were to happen to us and perhaps we would find ourselves in a hospital even where all the bad germs are that we could simply contract something while we're there and and have such a a frightening time remember perfect love casts out all fear not some of fear and not most fear but all fear and if we we fear then do we have perfect love in our lives brothers and sisters there's times don't don't don't get me wrong as human beings there's times where things happen to us and I'll word it like this if in our camper we have a horn just just to make it a human example we have a horn in our camper and it's like a a gravel truck horn it's very loud and we could walk in front of it someone could walk in front of it and we could honk the horn and it will scare us it will cause fear if we're not expecting it that's what can happen to a believer we can be walking through our life and we can hear something a doctor might say well you have this or you could experience that or maybe something else happens in our life and and we have a moment of fear that doesn't mean we're not a Believer and that doesn't mean that we don't have perfect love what I'm saying is that when we have that perfect love when that fear tries to come down upon us and take us again in bondage because it's a spirit perfect love casts out that spirit perfect love cast away that fear perfect love gives us the ability to have that spoken word condition where we can say you know what that's not the word of God for me to be afraid of the situation God doesn't want us to be afraid of the situations in our lives he wants us to be Sons and Daughters of God that are going to stand up and say it doesn't matter what happens I know that he's in control I know whom I have believed and that he is able to keep that which he has promised me not be afraid I just was thinking about that testimony of whether Gary Walker remember that terrible terrible terrible accident that he was in horrible accident and I believe his daughter wasn't really that injured even though her daddy was on the brink of death I think he had already died once or twice maybe in the wreck before the paramedics got him out and there was all the chaos and everything was going on around there and and the little daughter who was a Believer is the one that said it's going to be okay don't worry it's gonna be okay we're Believers right can you imagine that perfect love brothers and sisters it casts out all fear we have nothing to be afraid of it doesn't matter what the situation is and how do we get perfect love where does that come from brothers and sisters that's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth it's Christ in us the hope of glory scripture that we read this morning we don't have to be afraid we'll get into our scriptures a little a little bit here but uh just wanted to remind everyone that there was a new baby in our midst this week brother baby Benjamin egmana to brother Samuel and sister Faith and Brother Joseph and brother Paul so now we have another family with three boys in it three boys God bless you brothers and sister it's truly a wonderful thing to have a child and begin to learn as a parent some of the teachings in the Bible until we have children it's kind of difficult I think to see some of these things to understand what it means to want to express yourself to a child what it means to want to help a child and to teach a child to train the child up in the way it should go and it won't depart from it and it doesn't matter what you train them up in that word applies so we certainly want to train our children up the right way and that is in the word in the message of the hour the present truth so it's super important in our lives but yeah it's a real blessing to have children God bless you um brother Samuel and sister Faith I just wanted to bring something before the church this morning that's really important and we're certainly thankful for it everyone has been in prayer I know it when we uh announced that we would put our name forward to be uh considered for the role of Pastor we were engaged heavily in our business and we have been ever since and uh it's been a real trial and we haven't really known what to do with it and we've just asked for prayer that the Lord would guide us lead us and guide us most businesses in in our space in in the world I think around Calgary that I'm aware of they they basically either just continue on or they uh they fold up and they go under and usually there's a lot of debt and a lot of Heartache in terms of probably the people that own the business and and customers in our case the Lord has answered prayer we we just this last week this is the very first week um that we've been operating the way we are it's just amazing for me if it sounds like I'm really confused I just have so many thoughts going through my head the Lord sold our business the business is officially sold just like when you buy a house you sign all the documents you go through all the efforts and it's not yours until you get the keys we've actually handed the keys over to someone else we are now officially employees we are no longer employers there's a transition period that we have to go through to hand the business over we want to see it succeed we trust that something good will come out of it for the man that bought it but we know that it's truly a miracle for this to happen um we could have a tremendous problem if it didn't go right it could be a tremendous debt like I said and and heartache all over the place but the Lord has really really provided and we're super thankful for everyone who has ever uttered a prayer that the Lord would help us this way truly our hearts desire is not to be business people not to be having something on the side I don't want to side hustle and try and be a preacher try and be a pastor of a church I want to be there for the congregation and and whether I'm on the phone or in person or whatever that is or maybe just in thought I want to be in the word I want to be full time in the ministry here this is my desire it's not to be working something out on the side so I can just say that I I have a little bit of jingle I'm not interested in jingle I'm interested in getting out of here my heart's desire is to see all of us come to the fullness of Jesus Christ in our lives where we can express Mark 16 in action and then have people say what is it about you man how does that work and you can say it's Mark 16 in action yeah yeah profit for our day he said that all all else is false that's the only true church that Christ will accept as his own you know brothers and sisters that's that sounds maybe far-fetched but that's the desire in my heart to see in every one of our Lives it's not a fairy tale or a pipe dream if we believe right and and like I said earlier this this testimony of Brother Gary Walker's daughter we're Believers right we believe that that's that's what the true church is Mark 16 in action we're not looking for signs and wonders they're just going to follow us that's all they do is follow so anyways company has sold we have about a six-month duration of transition and we'll just see what the Lord will do here but officially and legally we are no longer employees of that company it no longer owns US I can say this now with the Surety it's very easy very very easy for Satan to creep into a life and allow an idol to become built and and it might sound crazy to to even say this way but just if you listen for a second here I'll tell you uh having your own business is interesting because if you want to have your own business the only way that you're going to make it work is to actually feed it you have to provide for your business it becomes an entity all to itself and if you wanted to succeed you have got to give everything you've got to make it work unless you're able to purchase a business and and maybe just be an investor a private investor and a silent partner in a business and you have somebody else that's doing it and then you're just investing you're not a business owner but when you're a business owner and everything rides upon whatever decision you make it's taxing I have a healthy respect for anyone who owns their own business it's just like having a child sometimes we think we understand all about children usually it's it's the ones without children that understand the way children should be raised right but it's not the case once you have a child you begin a healthy respect for what it means to be a parent and what it means to have a fussy child and to not know how to actually Comfort it and make it quiet even in a church service there's times where that happens right but until you're there you don't really understand it so in terms of a business we are absolutely thrilled to see it go it got to be so so so large in our life not maybe in the world but in our life it was consuming us absolutely consuming us and you know what it becomes is an idol because it becomes in front of the word of God you're so tired at the end of the day you don't have time to pray you're so tired at the end in the start of the day you don't have time for devotions because you got all this stuff you got to do for your business and we know that that's what an idol is idolatry is putting anything before the word of God but you know what happens is it's soft and it's subtle that's the way Satan Works he's the most subtle of all the beasts of the field hey you'll come in and make it look glamorous and make it look good but you'll find yourself so incredibly busy sometimes that you have to serve it now this thing you created now you have to serve it and you know it might be easy to say in our case that while you you know maybe you chose that and and truly we did but you know when you go in and you tear apart a customer's house if anybody here has ever gone through renovation you'll understand what I'm talking about if you have a contractor that you put trust in to tear apart your house you kind of hope that they'll put it back together again right your whole family is depending on that action to happen so it's not just an easy case of just stopping and then moving on it's it's I could go on and on and on and I don't want to do that I want to preach the word today brothers and sisters the only reason I'm talking the way that I am is probably one of the most pivotal pivotal pivotal moments in our life in in Lisa and my lives has happened our company sale has gone and uh we're absolutely thrilled couldn't be more excited about not being involved in it not that we hate the business not that we hate the industry we believe we've been called to a position and we want to be at our post of Duty that's the desire in our hearts so anyways thank you for your prayers it's a tremendous thing there's a transition period it will probably be towards the fall before we're completely free and clear of it and uh yeah unless unless maybe the new owner he gets fed up with us and just fires us after all we are employees now of our former company so who knows what could happen I wouldn't be sad if that happened I hope he's not watching right now but I mean I'm I'm honest and sincere about that I I really want nothing more to do with it but we have obligations so we'll fill our end of the contractual obligation and that will take us into about the fall and then we'll be free so blessed be the name of the Lord getting into our uh our thought this morning uh uh we're probably just going to ease into it I trust we're okay for a little bit this whole discussion about vaccines and being vaccinated and the virus and all this stuff I I just I've been looking at it a little bit myself and and contemplating it and I know that there's all manner of stuff out there that that people are captivated by some are for it some are against it some believe that covet is real and some believe that it's fake all this stuff brothers and sisters if we were to just step back and and look at it take a look at when polio happened on Earth or any one of these other diseases before the internet was around what did people do people died right people died sometimes horrific deaths sometimes people were just paralyzed sometimes all these different things all these diseases that have come on the Earth The Killers is what brother Branham said and and people they either got vaccinated or they died and until there was a vaccine on the scene they had no choice maybe some people they were able to pray their way through and they were able to see the power of God moving their lives there's no doubt in my mind that that would have happened but with polio specifically brother Branham talks about it so I'm just going to read a little quote talking about it out of 1962. and uh just talking about fear and and looking at this whole thing with with kovid what I wanted to say was I imagine if we were like them back then when they had a disease like that if we didn't have the internet and all of this nonsense of people's opinions continually being propagated before our eyes and our ears vexing our righteous Souls daily with the things that we see and we hear what would we do brothers and sisters if we knew that there was a plague in the land and people were dying because of it but then we heard because someone told us do you know that they've actually got a vaccine there's a doctor with a needle that can give you something that will keep you from dying that will save you it will help you what would we do if we weren't full of all of the garbage from the internet we would say wow how do I get one where do I need to go we'd probably look into it a little more and have a little more ambition a little more excitement for it but now Satan's Eden he's got all kinds of static out there everybody's opinion anybody that wants to have an opinion can put an opinion out there they can say it's fake news they can say it's real they can say it's fake they can say it's good for you they can say it's bad for you some people live some people die all these different opinions brothers and sisters we don't need to look at that we need to look to Christ as as children of God that needs to be our main focus but we know that we had a prophet in our day and we can refer to what the prophet said for some of this stuff it's wonderful so I'm just going to read this quote here out of key to the door 1962 1007. but the Branham says when polio struck the nation as we're all commanded to now go get this vaccine sound familiar although we're not commanded to we just presented that there's a vaccine and you can go and get it if you want to as we're all commanded now to go and get this vaccine to stamp it out when polio struck yesterday I was listening to a doctor as I was driving over the road some doctor from Louisville he said a few years ago the Great Plague hit Louisville said if men would have stood there stood where I did and saw 57 respirators at one time men women boys and girls paralyzed with a disease called polio and there was nothing could be done about it said I'd never want to see a thing like that again but science thought if there's such an evil as polio surely there's something to counteract it they fought they stood on the streets with boots those firemen put hats out and they begged and bummed they done everything trying to find a key to unlock the door to Liberty and finally one Christian gentleman by the name of Salk found a vaccine why there was evil at stake there was a killer at stake there was a key somewhere that could unlock Freedom again for man and the Salk vaccine was that the great treatment oh what the key can do the vaccine was brought forth and now is stamping out the polio with this vaccine because it was it was a never tiring and never giving up that key laid somewhere there was something would inoculate from it and they were determined to find it and if there is such an evil as polio diphtheria smallpox yellow fever tetanus lock jaw my word here coved and so forth that science these evils has been able to fight day and night till they found an inoculation from it because it's evil it's a killer how much more is there a key to Salvation for a man that's in the prison House of sin brothers and sisters we have nothing to fear many people will say well that's easy for you to say and maybe it is but remember we just said it Mark 16 in action is the true church and all else is false brothers and sisters that's what the prophet said we're just saying what the prophet said that's all we want to say we don't want to say our own words he says there's a key to that door to liberate man from it a key usually when it turns the lock and when you find the key it's got to be some treasure something that's worthwhile or you wouldn't even lock it up if it ain't worth locking up just let it go but when it's worth locking up so usually so a key usually is the note or or to something or the way to entering something that's worthwhile the key that's what it's for now it unlocks something that's worthwhile Mark 16 action brothers and sisters and we could probably just quickly turn over there just for fun Mark 16 in action I believe we had a good service on Wednesday I know for sure that Satan he just hates hearing us talk about the manifestation of the sons of God and and that's what we're doing brothers and sisters you know there's a revelation that comes out of the message of the hour it's that same Revelation that that Peter had on on that day when when Jesus said to them who who does man say that I am now who do you say that I am and he had that Revelation that's what's happening right now brothers and sisters that very same Revelation only it's not the recognition of Jesus Christ out there somewhere tangibly it's Jesus Christ in us we just read it in Colossians Christ in you the hope of glory the revelation of the word coming to life inside us but let's read in mark 16. Mark 16 uh yeah Mark 16 sorry verse 15. and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized I'll just throw this out there in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the message of Malachi 4 right according to the prophet for our day he that believeth and is baptized he shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned so if you believe not I've just got a trinitarian baptism and I'm just going to take that that that baptism that's actually a satanic baptism I'm just going to take that you're not going to be saved you'll wind up going through the flood just like Noah but you better hope you have a boat he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that what that believe not those that just say I'm good I got my church I've got my Creed my doctor and my tradition no you've got to believe it and by believing it you actually demonstrated in your life you come forward and say I want to actually do that I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and you know there's some people that will take that and actually take it to the other end of the spectrum and say well you know what we can just have service and and who cares what the law of the land is we'll just have a communion service a communion foot Washing Service and we won't wear masks and we'll pack the church out and we'll just use one cup for communion because we believe right we don't want to tempt the Lord thy God that's what the word says don't don't tempt the Lord thy God brothers and sisters if we believe then we're going to just act like Christians we're not going to try and be fanatics God doesn't clown for nobody Mark 16 in action is the only church that he claims for his own brothers and sisters all else is false a false impersonation of the truth and it can happen so easy it will be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible brothers and sisters it's not going to be some crazy uh monstrous denomination out there that's going to come marching in and and growling and snarling scaring us it's not going to be that at all it'll be someone that will be around us real close those two Vines grow up together so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible Satan will come as a an angel of Light but you know just like Martin we'll be able to discern him because when he does that he won't be according to the word remember that happened to Martin is documented he saw this Angel come into His study and he said worship me worship me Martin I'm the one that you've longed to see now I'm here now worship me and he said no you know there's just something not right you're wearing a crown and you know at the end of the age that's when the saints Crown you you have the crown just a little too soon he got his costume mixed up but you know because of the word that was in him he was able to discern the situation brothers and sisters same thing with us when we understand the message of the hour we're able to do it ourselves now don't be afraid of covid don't be afraid of vaccines brothers and sisters if you could drink any deadly thing do you think that you could get anything injected into you that might be deadly even if it was poison direct poison you remember the story that brother Ken told about the believer I think he was in Russia or the Ukraine the story about the man who was taken because he was a Christian and he was told that you're going to drink this cup you say that you believe Mark 16 in action you're a Christian see that cup drink it prove to me that you believe and that cup is poison he told him that they told him that's a cup of poison and we want to see you prove it now drink that cup and the man was oh my this is really putting it to the test isn't it could you imagine that being that man what did they do they took it and they gave some of it to a dog that was there what'd the dog do died put him on his back and his legs up in the air dead immediately but what did that man do that man said you know what I do believe it with all my heart so give me that cup and let me drink it and he drank it and what happened didn't those men convert based on this man's testimony of him actually being able to prove it not because he wanted to clown for God it's because they probably had a gun pointed to the head saying that you better do it or we're gonna kill you but imagine that brothers and sisters so there we are in a situation like that now we have a vaccine brother Branham talks about it over and over again if we have the opportunity to get a fix from a doctor for your situation and we just refuse the medication it's not the doctor's fault that's what brother Bradham says it's not it's not the state's fault it's not anybody's fault we have to make our own decisions and we've been given the ability to be expressed in a land of the free and we have the opportunity to make our decisions but brothers and sisters don't be afraid I have to say it this way don't be afraid what do we have to be afraid of if we believe all things are possible Right Mark 16 in action if I drink any deadly thing if I get a vaccine stuffed in my arm even if it is true poison if I'm a Believer and God doesn't want me to die again you could give me two of those shots and I won't die until he says it's time for me to die I think brother Ken said this too a man that's destined to hang can't drown right if we're destined to be raptured as the Church of the Living God a vaccine isn't going to kill us we don't need to be afraid brothers and sisters that's my point we can stand tall we can put our shoulders back and raise our chin and say blessed be the name of the Lord whether I live or whether I die I'm Christ's it doesn't matter what matters is our testimony and if we display fear and if we talk fear and if we express fear are we doing anything positive with the word of God in our lives what we're doing is showing that we don't have perfect love because if we had perfect love then there would be no fear expressed in our lives we might feel it it might be like your bucket of cold water but you know when we get a bucket of cold water splashed on us eventually we start to dry off and we start to get warm again and everything is fine sometimes fear is like that in our lives it'll come on us and we'll be afraid for a moment but then it will just disappear because we have perfect love Mark 16 in action I just can't say it enough out of our scripture reading today now we're going to get into it brothers and sisters out of our scripture reading today we know that uh uh bear with me for a second here out of the book of Colossians Paul he's talking about verse 26 and verse 27 the mystery which hath been hid from the ages and from Generations that's now made manifest to his Saints now made manifest to us through the message of the hour brothers and sisters this mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory the second coming of the Lord is what we're talking about out of Christ is the mystery of God revealed whether banham says it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the Earth you know that rain it falls on the just and the unjust and and that that rain is the anointing of Malachi 4. of Revelations 10 7. the full opening of the word that was given to this world and we know what happened in 1963 if you look at the the graphs and the charts of how crime and criminal behavior and all of the Terrible Things I'm not going to list them all but if you were to look it up in a timeline and see what happened in in like 1963 when that anointing of the Lord was poured out when he poured his Spirit out upon All Flesh what happened there's all manner of evil things happen rock and roll took off the magnetic recording device came on the scene and was perverted for the use of Hollywood and and music and and the Beatles and all the different things that happen all of the the delinquencies everything just went off the charts at the same time God poured his Spirit out upon All Flesh and here we are brothers and sisters full recipients of that and today people are behaving in ways that that they think they're just going about their business and and behaving the way that they want to and and and exactly according to whatever they want to do because that's that's that's the way to see an age it's the age of people's rights and you know it just really hit me this week how how I've talked about the change of the bodies and we know all about that people wanting to change their bodies and not even realizing it why um but it just really hit me how you know in the in the word the the word to the laodicean church is that you're rich increased with goods and have need of nothing but you don't know that you're naked and poor and blind how that word is just sitting there and it I've read it so many times and we've heard it so many times but to look at it and think that how the world now is trying to get rich and trying to be naked the way the women are expressing themselves and they don't even understand it but it's fashionable it's Hollywood it's it's the way the world is I'm not going to go too far down that road don't don't get uneasy I'm not trying to to be that way but just to think about it how how amazing it is to see how the word it just affects all of humankind the entire world and and they don't even realize why except for those people who are the predestinated seed they can realize that the word of God comes on the world comes across the world for a purpose and that's to make make the seed that's in people come to manifest whether it's a seed of Honor or whether it's a seed of Dishonor everyone will Express what kind of seed is in them and people can't help it you can't prevent that from happening some people were made as a vessel of honor and some people were made as a vessel Of Dishonor some people made to be saved some people made for Destruction and it's terrible to even speak that but it's the word I'm just speaking what the word says you know Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated it's pretty alarming when you look at it that way and we know in case somebody is watching or looking at this later on we're not talking about this from an elite perspective because that's an antichrist spirit when someone would say I'm saved look at me thank you Lord that I'm not like all the rest of them people that I see in the denominational world no no that's not that is not the heart of a True Believer and that is not the heart of Christ because his heart is that all would come to repentance that everyone would be saved but you know there's there's people that would take that and say well you know when you talk that way about people being fit for Destruction that you're you're making yourself something no no no no no it's just what the word makes people and you know if you get that revelation that God has saved you that it truly has been a new birth in your life to understand that you've been born not of the will of the flesh not of the will of man but I've been born by the will of God that's talking about the New Birth that scripture in Saint John Christ making himself revealed to the individual personally Christ showing himself that he is alive and well when that Revelation hits the heart of a True Believer it causes something to happen we begin to sigh and we begin to cry for the Abominations that are in the land when we look around us and we see all of the different things that go on in the world no longer can we watch a Hollywood movie that will just promote adultery and fornication or listen to music that would promote either one of those things because they both promote the same thing rebellion and and and dishonor everything contrary to the word it's Antichrist but something in US Rises up and says I just can't do it anymore it doesn't give us the ability to say oh I judge those people look at those people they're horrible and I'm great no way no if that's happening in our lives brothers and sisters we need to take a step back and we need to check up our experience because our experience ain't right it's not we look at the world and we can see what's going on in the world but we don't judge people the word judges people and God judges people we want to try and attract every single person brother Branham says that we wouldn't wish that on our worst enemy that they would be lost we want to take as many people with us as we can and how does that happen it happens by the word by the word working mightily In You by the word working mightily in me where we just live our lives and people look at us and they say What Makes You Different what is it about you something about you I just don't understand it and sometimes you can say yeah you know I just can't understand it either but I believe it it's the word how do you explain Jesus Christ you just you just live it it's him living out through US brother Bradham says it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the Earth the same thing come through the days of Noah the same thing come through the days of Moses Days of Elijah days of the prophets days of Jesus on down through and to this very hour 50 years ago but it's no different today brothers and sisters the pagnated person with the seed of God the word in their manifesting itself and sometimes we say yeah I'm a Christian because that word just lives out through us right we don't we don't have to put a flag on our on our car and and bumper stickers and and go and tell everyone that I'm a Christian maybe sometimes we'll feel led to do that maybe we'll get a drum and a symbol and go on March up and down the street and and sing hymns so that people will see that there's a Christian Living there but you know what speaks louder than that is actually living your life brother Branham says that sometimes you'll even have to talk a life lived is the loudest sermon preached we don't have to go and be a fanatic to try and show people that we believe Jesus Christ what we need to do is actually cast out all fear with perfect love in our lives and express perfect love to this world to the people that nobody else wants to talk to in this world the people who are the most difficult people to get along with to be able to say well you know maybe someone just hasn't expressed love to them maybe they just never met Jesus Christ before in their lives on down through and to this very hour the pregnated person with the seed of God the word in there manifesting itself so surrender to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifests itself to this person's a prisoner to an individual are you a prisoner to an individual might sound weird but it's true we become prisoners to Christ when we believe maybe turn over to the Book of Luke with me this morning Luke chapter one it's one page over from Mark 16 in action in the Book of Luke I just believe it with all my heart that Satan absolutely hates what we're talking about today brothers and sisters we'll go back and read this quote again after we read this scripture Luke chapter 1 verse 26. and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be an angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever in the kingdom and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her we know that this is the beginning of the Christmas message but you know brothers and sisters I want to I want to beg to differ on that I want to take this and I want to make it the present tense scripture this is about us in our day you know that every scripture has a compound meaning and every scripture has a compound Revelation brother Branham said that what I want to do is take this out of history and take it from being Santa Claus and and the manger and Mary and all the stuff Associated to Christmas and let's fast forward and let's go back to the scripture that we just read now keep that keep that page open right there reading all of that that we just read and and let's let's read Colossians again verse 26 and 27. keeping that one open in in Luke let's go read Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 and 27. even the mystery which hath been hid from the ages and from Generations but is now made manifest to his Saints be it unto me according to Thy Word to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory how can that possibly be brothers and sisters I want to tell you and I knew that you knew that but you know what he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he's not going to do anything any different than he ever has the only thing different that he'll do what he already has done only a couple times in the Bible so far is he's going to Rapture a gentile church that's something that's not real popular that hasn't happened a lot but it's coming brothers and sisters and that's the last promise for the Gentile Church but how could we ever ever be able to be like Mary it's in verse 38. that's the key to it just just say say unto the Lord behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word how can we do that brothers and sisters by saying you know what God sends an angel you know what that that verse is in in Revelation chapter 10. behold in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels mystery Angels the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound even the mystery of Christ shall be revealed what is the mystery of Christ we just read it the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory so this scripture here that we just read in Luke yes it's about Mary and yes it's about Jesus being introduced to the world the Lamb of God the the one that taketh away all of the sin the atonement for all of us but brothers and sisters let's look at it a little bit closer and think you know what when the angel came unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored the the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women remember the church is referred to as woman as female so I say to you this morning blessed art you thou highly favored the Lord looks at you with high favor to be able to hear the salutation of the Angel of the Lord of Malachi 4. to hear the message of the hour brothers and sisters it's no different than it was for Mary thou highly favored but when she saw him she was troubled at his saying many of us when we hear about the message of the hour at first it's troubling how could it be the same thing how could it be that an angel has come and said to me thou highly favored of God blessed art thou but if we think about it it's no different than Mary right remember what brother Branham said in invisible Union you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ a virgin a spouse to one man so we look at ourselves and we say wow me that's weird why would you say that brother Barry look look at your life because typically that's probably what people will do is say look at your life I I would say that I'm you know I'm the chiefest of sinners I come from not a great area I come from probably not a great upbringing I probably don't have a great pedigree but you know what that's all irrelevant because we read it earlier in the quote that I'm going to go back and read again this just gets me excited because I know on my own I have nothing I am nothing and I never will be but if I could take the word for my day the prophet says it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the Earth the same thing through the days of Noah same thing through the days of Moses Elijah the prophets and even in Jesus day on down to this very hour the pregnated person with the seed of God which is the word the seed of God the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifests itself Mark 16 in action manifests itself to this person's a prisoner an individual the people in this world they look at us and they say what makes you different because I believe because I understood that an angel came to a virgin espoused but only this time not to a man not to some worldly denomination a virgin espoused to Christ but she just didn't recognize it she had a little bit of spiritual amnesia and you know she was troubled in her mind Mary was troubled in her mind at the saying how could how could this possibly be how could the message of the hour how could the revelations 10 7 actually be how how could this be the the angel of of Malachi 4. how could this be it's troubling until he he reveals himself to you but you know when you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins according to the scripture according to what the prophet brought the angel brought to us when we actually do that he's a dissolver of all doubts he actually opens our eyes of understanding that we can see what is the riches of his glory in our lives and there comes a point where we hear the angel say good evening friends and when we listen to that something inside of our hearts something inside of our souls just like Mary when we hear that voice we hear the angel saying to our souls fear not Mary just take out Mary's name for a little while and read this scripture a little bit this week just just just try and read it and put your name in there make it your name make it personal to you and say fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God brothers and sisters if you have the ability to even hear the message of the hour whether you believe it or not you have found favor with God whether you can say I believe in in the Elijah Ministry I believe that there's five comings of Elijah I believe that brother Bradham was a a prophet of God or not whether you believe it or not you're highly favored to be able to hear the words that God sent a prophet and whether you do something with it or not is up to you it depends on what that seed is that's inside of you but then brothers and sisters oh my this is where I start to get excited think about it even if you hear it and you don't have the ability to receive it you're highly favored but what about those who are that predestinated seed from before the foundation of the world that have been predestinated to receive that word in their day oh my to me that is exciting and you know if this doesn't get us excited I don't know what does what on this world gets us excited you know because there comes a point where we we realize that that the angel is saying to us behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb we know that this is talking about Mary physically but today we're talking about you spiritually me spiritually there comes a point where we realize what this Angel is trying to tell us that when we receive the message of the hour when we truly get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin so that we might receive the baptism of the holy spirit that which is conceived in our womb it's not just a church Creed it's not just a denomination it's not just an association it's not just a good Fellowship what it is brothers and sisters you will bring forth the son inside of you and you shall call his name what Jesus the word is only going to bring forth one thing in our lives brothers and sisters it's not going to bring us into a church it's not going to bring us into an association the prophet didn't come here to encourage us to get together and be clicky and just be a fine group of people he encouraged us to get into the word to get into Christ to follow his instructions so that when we receive the word spiritually into our womb something comes forth in our lives we have a new birth and when we have a new birth it's not someone that we we know it's not someone that we would like to be it's not part of our old self it's Jesus and Jesus alone it's Jesus that takes his his life starts to come forth inside of our womb and you know brother Branham talks about it that there's only one animal in the Kingdom that when they're pregnant their womb is sealed and that's a human brothers and sisters if you take this word into your soul and you become pregnant with this word you're sealed out all the rest of it is sealed out there's no room nobody else can come along and mess up your experience not even Satan we've talked about it you can get so far into the word so far into the word that Satan won't even be able to find you we can get so close to God that Satan won't even know what to do with us all of these different things that we know is available but brothers and sisters I just felt so impressed with this scripture from Luke it's not about Christmas Satan wants it to be about Christmas and about the the Virgin Mary and all the stuff that goes along with that no this is about you this is about you having a New Birth about that new birth coming and taking taking hold in your lives and you know he goes and talks to to Mary in verse 32 and 33 and says that he shall be great be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end he's describing Jesus the the person and how he will be exalted so high oh that he'll have to look down to be able to see heaven then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man how could this possibly be that I would be able to give birth how could I ever have a new birth in my life to Jesus Christ how could that ever be isn't it amazing to look at this the Virgin birth and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of sin and see what happens there is a promise that will come unto you you know he doesn't say that the church will overshadow you go up and see the priests and the Levites and they'll do an excellent sacrifice for you and and they shall overshadow you the power that's expressed through them shall overshadow you the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you this was before the Holy Ghost was given right Holy Ghost wasn't even given the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee oh my I just love this part this is the best part brothers and sisters because it's true it happens to us today he's the same yesterday today and forever Mark 16 in action brothers and sisters the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God now go back to Colossians and read that even the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory brothers and sisters not a fairy tale not sometime in the future not some other age not the Millennium right now right here today you know what Satan hates this preaching he hates it and you know I'm saying it because I know it but the prophet said it not just me this ain't just Barry saying this I just got to read this again I just love it so good I I hope it does this for someone else to maybe I'm just a fanatic goodness it says it goes by them it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the earth same thing through the days of Noah come through the days of Moses Days of Elijah days of the prophets days of Jesus on down and to and through this very hour the pregnant person with the seed of God what is the seed of God he says it right here the word in there manifesting itself so surrender to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifest itself to this person's a prisoner an individual we become a person who is a prisoner and to an individual I just love how he says that a person who is a prisoner to an individual you're not a prisoner to a church not a prisoner to an association not a prisoner to some place that's going to give you a fellowship card that if you believe and act and and do the way that they say that you should that you can have that fine card and all of the benefits that go along with that Association but as soon as you step out of line from what they believe get lost no impossible because they didn't write your name in heaven and they can't take it out of there it's awesome out of Christ the mystery butter Branham says not say my church done my church has done nothing to do with it he says it's an individual one person individual one person and he goes on to say that all hell is against this teaching all hell is against us coming to the manifestation of sons of God all hell is against us coming to the place where we recognize who we are brothers and sisters that's why we're preaching this today that's why we're preaching this this way because the only thing that's going to pregnate us is the word that's the only thing that's going to change our bodies is the word not a church not an organization not a program not not more organization none of that the only thing that's going to do it is the word that's all and Mary said unto the angel verse 34 how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God I believe many times we can talk about the new birth and and when there's a new birth I'll just use me for an example I went from being completely in the world to being completely saved and and and and and and I'm still very I'm not Barry you might see me in my flesh but you don't see who I am you don't see the Lord Jesus Christ in the inside of the inside because brothers and sisters if I've got the Holy Ghost that's what's in there that teeny little spot that he created inside the heart of a man for the Holy Spirit that's me my representation isn't this flesh it's not my my Consciousness it's not my spirit it's not what you see here on Earth my representation is in heaven I've got a theophany over there waiting for me and the more that we talk like this and and have decent Services the more we hear from our theophany bodies every one of us has a theophany body over there if we're a Believer and you know what that body cries out to us and and we know that but it's just worth talking about there's nothing else really worth talking about we can talk about sports and weather and all the different news things but what relevance does it have to the true believers you know the power of the highest it shall overshadow thee and and and and you'll have a new birth there'll be something that comes forward in your life you don't remain the same person that you were remember brother Branham says it that a birth doesn't matter what it is a birth is always messy why is it because you recognize how lost you really are when you have a new birth you recognize that your soul is actually hanging over Hell by a chain that's just about to break and once you recognize that brothers and sisters then you can sing Grace Grace marvelous Grace that Grace that was set aside for me the the thing the only thing that will ever save me is that Grace that he gave unto us and it gives us the ability we'll just jump down to verse 38 it gives us the ability the heart of a True Believer when when that light flashes when that word comes forward when that angel speaks to us and and we hear something is different about that when when that happens in our lives brothers and sisters there's something that rises up because it's that predestinated seed it can't not answer it has to answer just like every seed has to answer to the anointing that gets poured out upon All Flesh and not every seed is a seed of God but those seeds of God those ones who actually are predestined it to hear this word they're just like Mary and they say behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word and what happens then the angel departed from her that's all we need to do brothers and sisters is be able to say be it unto me according to Thy Word the message of Malachi 4 that angel the seventh angel messenger the final message to the final age on Earth and here we are brothers and sisters my goodness to think that we have the ability not only to just hear it but to receive it and and to receive it and then to actually become it it's not he how many of us would ever want to become Jesus Christ in our lives set out I'm born and and I come into this world and that's my ambition is to become Jesus Christ it's contrary to this flesh remember in in verse 8 of Revelations 10. there was that little book and John was instructed to take it and eat it up and that it would be bitter in thy belly but sweet is honey in thy mouth so sweet it's so sweet to talk about the things of the Lord but to go on let that word come right down on the inside and begin to pregnate us just like we talked about this morning having that word hit that predestinated seed in our lives it's bitter and the reason why is because this flesh will never see God this flesh has got to perish but it's our spirit that actually takes a hold of it and takes it right down into our soul our flesh takes us to church our spirit receives the word but it's our soul that actually takes root in and and this word comes to pass in our lives and Mary said behold the handmaid of the lord we just need to say it be it unto me according to Thy word just just let your word come to pass in my life I might not understand it completely remember Hattie writes she probably didn't understand it either when brother Brown was talking about the squirrels and telling the stories around the table but she said there's something about that she just couldn't lie because that thing inside of her that seed that was within her it just said that's nothing but the truth and when a True Believer comes across this word and they hear it they say the same thing and you know what happens when they say the same thing when that's nothing but the truth that means they're accepting that word for themselves and what they're doing is they're not just taking it in the Physical Realm they're not just taking it in the spirit realm but they're taking it into the soul realm that word is nothing but the truth and when that happens brothers and sisters the power of the highest will overshadow you and there will be a new birth there will be a new birth but it's not a man that does it for you it's not a church that does it for you it's the Lord Jesus Christ that does it for you in word form brother Branham says that it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it's truth Jesus never said now Peter you and John and all the rest of the people you've got the Revelation now the whole church is saved no it was to him personally it's a personal experience the new birth is personal it can be an association it can't be a tradition it can't be our parents it can't be our brother our sister our aunt and uncle grandparents nope it's got to be a new birth to the individual Christ revealed personally he says I say unto thee not unto them to thee Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the word Peter means a stone stone means the confessed one or the separated one Upon A Certain Stone Upon A Certain thing see a called out a church called out upon this Stone upon this revelation Flesh and Blood never revealed it to you but upon this Revelations called out group I'll build my church in them love how he says that not in the church this is the prophet saying it I'll build my church in them excuse me and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it once you've had that experience you've taken that word into your womb you say maybe I don't understand it completely but just be it unto me Lord according to Thy word that the seventh angel messenger brought that angel when you hear that voice and he begins to speak the word and you begin to not necessarily understand it but something just Rises up and says man there's something about that and the more you feed on it the more you receive it into you that's why Faith cometh by hearing and hearing what the word of God that's why when we do that brothers and sisters it becomes a new birth to us we become a new creature in Christ Jesus we're not the same as we were or the same that we were going to be but what happens is that no one will ever be able to take it away from you if you have a traditional experience someone somewhere along the way will take it away from you if you've got a church experience someone somewhere along the way will take it from you and you wonder how I'll tell you how someone is going to preach something that's going to step on your toes and you're going to get offended and you're going to leave if it's if it's an association someone could come and say something to you and and you think that you're amongst angels and you'll find out that you know what sometimes there's some nature there that you just don't really desire sometimes people are just prickly it's their nature and they might just poke you and you know what if it's not the new birth you'll get offended and you'll leave but you're not getting offended necessarily at the people you're getting offended at the word and the troubling part about it is you're right there the truth is what sets you free not the association not being a part of a group that's why brothers and sisters it's so important to get the Holy Ghost in your life because even if you get the Holy Ghost in your life you can be scared and and perfect love will cast out all fear someone can come and step on your toes and you might get upset but you'll forgive them someone might preach something that makes you upset but you'll go and talk to them and you'll forgive them because the Holy Ghost isn't going to hold on to stuff when we have the spirit of Christ in us we know that we don't need to get upset we don't need to be fussed because he's got everything under control brother Branham says here that not one hair of your head Shall Perish you or mine he says I'll raise you up in the last day give unto him eternal life and raise him up at the last days there it is the Revelation not them but him an individual not a group an individual and he says it again here that all hell is against this all hell is against it you can type that in all hell is against and you'll see this in Christ The Mystery of God revealed this is like two paragraphs but it's talking about the new birth and it's coming right out and saying it that it's the word of God coming to the believer through an angel the seventh angel messenger it's the word of God coming through an angel to a Believer a spouse to Christ and her either accepting the word or rejecting the word and by accepting the word she becomes pregnated with that word and when she's pregnant with that word the power of the most high overshadows her and that thing that happens that thing that comes forth in her life is what the thing is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ begins to come forth in the life of a True Believer and brothers and sisters that truly is the new birth maybe I'm preaching to the choir I believe there's probably people that have never heard this this way I know that God has revealed it to me in a way that's real clear given me the ability to be able to say it I trust that it's it's it's it's it's it's finding its marked today but he says there it is the Revelation not them but him an individual not a group an individual and all hell is against it remember we read on Wednesday behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God again Satan hates it but we love it Satan hates revelation but we love it because Revelation shows exactly who Satan is it shows all of his tactics and it shows his destruction but we love it because it shows who we are and it shows Who We Are Who will be and it shows where we're going to end up and it shows us also where he's going to end up that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not we're crazy for even talking this way that the word's going to impregnate you what you're a Madman but brothers and sisters if it ever happens to you you do become a new creature in Christ Jesus that's the only result that can happen you can't have part of you and still have Christ you can't have the word of God impregnated in you coming forward and birthing Christ you can't have that new birth and still have the old man the only thing that's happened is you've you've come close to it but you haven't quite received it yet if you haven't actually killed the old man but therefore the world looks at us and and they don't know they they know us the world therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not they don't know Jesus they don't want nothing to do with Jesus right but beloved to the very next verse now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is you know I learned a lesson a little while ago talking about the coming and the appearing brother Branham said very clearly in the message of the hour the appearing is now and how many years ago was that 50 years ago the appearing is now seeing the son of man Ministry that that that one that came down and Stood Beside brother Branham on the stage where people would feel something and he would say you feel that don't you and they would say yes I do and he would say that's him that's the angel of the Lord that's the appearing but to look at it he's not making a great image unto himself what he has is Sons and Daughters of God and that's his chosen vessel that's the way he's chosen to express himself to this Dying World not not a great Association not a great church not a great steeple not that simple men and simple women and I say that because I'm pretty simple myself but it's true he doesn't choose intellectual Giants he doesn't choose great wealthy people remember Jesus came to the publicans and the sinners it's just amazing that we have the ability to hear his voice in our day you know what I'll call I'll call the musicians we're at 12 o'clock now in first John chapter 4 verse 17 maybe stand with me this morning as we close brother Branham says herein is our love made perfect that we have may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is he is but as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love it casts out all fear perfect love casteth out all fear you ever seen someone that's afraid they're in torment aren't they I can tell you and I've told the testimony before that family trip that we went to Victoria I was afraid and I don't even know why why would I be so afraid about our business maybe it would have been good if God took it away from us but I had misquoted something so terribly and it was only like thirty thousand dollars but to me that was everything and I felt like I was so afraid of it because what would we do lose our business what would our children do what would our wife do would my wife leave me because I I'm a loser and all this silly fear Creeps in and you know what you become a bond a slave to it you wind up in bondage again to fear if you listen to that but you need to have perfect love in your life brothers and sisters because when you do perfect love grabs that fear by the throat and throws it up against the wall and puts its finger in its nose and says you have no ability to be here anymore you have no Authority here and what does it do by the throat it casts that fear out all of that fear goes perfect love cast out all fear brothers and sisters because fear hath torment we're not tormented we're Sons and Daughters of God we know who we are and we know what we're raised up for to be the dwelling place of the most high when that power of the highest shall overshadow you that thing that you'll bring forth in your life it's not going to be a church Association it's not going to be a message person it's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ period and brothers and sisters that's his chosen method that's his way we can't change that he that feareth is not made perfect in love we don't have to fear brothers and sisters I'll just say this here one last little quote but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one that could see it Christ in you the hope of glory that mystery that's been hid from all the generations there's only one person one one one body the many membered body of Jesus Christ there's only one person the Bride of Jesus Christ that has the ability to see that everyone else in this world will miss it it will just go completely past them they'll say seventh angel you're crazy Christ in you you're crazy you you're crazy the new birth meh maybe a little bit but I still have me and I still have all the things in this life that I love it's not the way it works it's the old man he dies out completely brother Branham says but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one that could see it and blessed are your eyes brothers and sisters if you have the ability to see this word today because the power of the highest if you can just imagine those words the power of the highest of overshadow thee and that thing that will come forward in your life is Jesus Christ my goodness let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful for your grace and for your mercy Lord for your Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world there's so many things that we could list off that we're thankful for but Lord Jesus the one thing that I believe I can say I'm the most thankful for is the new birth Lord Jesus we can see Mark 16 in action all day long and still be lost but oh Father to have the ability to receive your word into our spiritual womb Lord God that's the next level that's that's out of this world father to be able to hear your word and receive it into our worm womb and to be able to give birth a new birth to your life through us what a tremendous thing that is Lord Jesus father I just want to pray a special blessing upon each one who's listening this morning Father that every single one would be able to receive that kind of blessing Lord to be able to take and hear your word and be able to say be it unto me according to Thy word to receive that word uninhibitedly just just unreserve it into our womb spiritually Lord and just allow you to manifest in our lives to just grow in our lives Lord Jesus in a way that maybe we've never experienced father that Lord that most of all we would be able to recognize what we are that we are truly your body on Earth again father that we could just recognize that and then see the Rapture to go but we know until that day or if you take us the way of the Grave whatever happens Lord we're yours once we've received your seed word word father we just love you and we thank you we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us Lord as we travel we pray that you would give us traveling mercies that you would bring us back again at the appointed time father we pray that you would just bless each one in our absence father that you would just bless the brothers who are putting their shoulders to the wheel to to feed the sheep Lord to watch over the flock oh Father we just pray that your word would just continue coming forth in power and in demonstration we just love you and we thank you and we bless your name we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen In Christ Alone In Christ Alone will I Glory though I could pride myself in battle's one for I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone I overcome why could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands but those trophies could not equal by which I just in Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said of me my source of strength my source of Hope is Christ the lord In Christ Alone will I glory for only by his grace I am redeemed and only his tender Mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my need and now I seek no greater honor than just to know you more to count my gains but losses to the Glory of Love In Christ Alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every Victory let it be said of me my source of strength length high source of Hope is Christ the lord 2654 you deserve the glory [Music] you deserve the glory Glory [Music] Lord we lift our hands to worship as we praise your
