========================================

God bless you and uh good evening I just have this song in my heart that's it's been a blessing to me and wanted to share with you um title that I could still go free and you know one um one part of the song says that what kind of a man will reach down with his his hand and do this for me unworthy to leave and not fit to kill and just that part just registered to me what kind of a man will tell me to go free after all I've done against him um it's just a blessing and I hope it will be a blessing to you as well [Music] you can lock me up in the prison [Music] and throw away the king take away the vision from these eyes that now now can see then deprive me of the food I eat and even buying my head s and feet for as long as I know Jesus does and he said I could steal Go free he said I could steal go free what kind of a man break down his hand and do this for me so unworthy to leave and not free to kill the man on the cross he had my name is will he said go free foreign [Music] and feel the pain of flesh flesh and Bone then too late to trot the glory path that lead to Calvary for those blood red stains broke all might change [Music] I could still go free he said Go free what kind of a man will return on his hand and do this for me foreign [Music] [Music] I'm free from the fears of tomorrow I'm free free from the guilt of my past oh I've traded my shackles for Glorious song I am free praise the Lord good night [Music] [Applause]
