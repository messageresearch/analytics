[48:37] time from glory to glory we ask in Jesus
[48:41] Christ's name we pray amen amen
[48:47] bless you this morning musicians
[48:49] thank you if you have your Bibles I'd
[48:50] like to read from Mark
[48:52] chapter 10.
[48:54] verse 17 to 22.
[48:58] likely a very familiar scripture
[49:02] it's just a beautiful thing I believe
[49:05] the
[49:06] direction of the Lord and his leadership
[49:09] is such a wonderful thing
[49:15] Mark chapter 10.
[49:17] we'll start reading with verse 17. you
[49:19] have it say Amen this morning
[49:25] says and when he was gone forth into the
[49:28] way
[49:29] there came one running
[49:31] and kneeled to him and asked God
[49:35] asked him sorry good master
[49:38] what shall I do that I may inherit
[49:41] eternal life
[49:42] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[49:45] me good
[49:46] there is none good but one that is God
[49:52] Jesus speaking here continuing on in
[49:54] verse 19 says to him thou knowest the
[49:57] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[50:00] not kill
[50:01] do not steal
[50:03] do not bear false witness defraud not
[50:06] honor thy father and mother
[50:10] and he said and he answered
[50:12] and said unto him master all these have
[50:15] I observed from my youth
[50:18] then Jesus beholding him loved him
[50:22] and said unto him one thing thou lackest
[50:26] go thy way
[50:28] sell whatsoever thou Hast
[50:30] and give to the poor
[50:33] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[50:35] and come
[50:37] take up the cross and follow me
[50:42] and he was sad at that saying and went
[50:46] away grieved
[50:48] for he had great possessions
[50:50] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[50:53] a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[50:55] you for your word
[50:57] we thank you Father that you always come
[51:00] father that you always lead us
[51:03] father that you always give us the
[51:05] direction that we need in our lives and
[51:07] it's up to us whether we choose to
[51:08] accept it or reject it
[51:10] father this morning we pray that you
[51:12] would just take this bread of life that
[51:13] we've read now that you would break it
[51:15] open fresh to us father that you would
[51:18] Enlighten our eyes father of
[51:19] understanding today
[51:21] Lord Jesus that you would just have your
[51:23] will and your way in this service we ask
[51:25] all these things now when Jesus Christ
[51:26] name we pray amen God bless you this
[51:29] morning you may be seated
[51:33] just uh a few announcements before we
[51:36] get into the word this morning November
[51:39] calendar will be out this week
[51:41] not really much has changed
[51:44] um from what we do normally
[51:46] we'll be having the fellowship on the
[51:48] 31st which is tomorrow that's at our
[51:50] place for those people who feel inclined
[51:52] to come
[51:53] I'm sure it'll be a wonderful time a
[51:55] good opportunity to get together as
[51:57] friends and Families
[51:59] on November the 9th
[52:02] and I'll say November the 23rd kind of
[52:05] jumping ahead we're going to do
[52:07] something a little differently moving
[52:08] forwards and that's uh I've invited our
[52:10] ministering Brethren to take part in our
[52:12] services on Wednesdays so we're going to
[52:15] have our ministering ministering
[52:17] Brothers take two Services a month
[52:20] um for the next while just to see what
[52:23] the Lord will do it's important for us
[52:25] as ministers to be able to release
[52:29] we drink in a lot and we have to be able
[52:32] to push out and if we're not given that
[52:34] opportunity it can become problematic
[52:36] so we want to see the Lord move in our
[52:39] brother's life so we have brother
[52:40] Gilbert taking the service on the 9th of
[52:42] November and we have brother Emanuel
[52:44] taking the service on the 23rd of
[52:46] November and we'll have brother
[52:50] Toby
[52:52] yeah we'll have the other two brothers
[52:53] take Services brother Mervin and brother
[52:55] Toby in December but uh for now we'll
[52:58] have those two brothers in November we
[53:00] have the Men's breakfast coming up
[53:02] November the 12th we have a November
[53:04] Youth Event I believe that's on the 18th
[53:07] that's the third Friday
[53:10] then we have November the 20th we're
[53:11] going to have a communion service
[53:13] November the 23rd I already said brother
[53:15] Emanuel and November the 26th we're
[53:19] going to have a youth banquet and
[53:20] brother Toby is going to take that
[53:23] banquet for us which is a tremendous
[53:25] opportunity to maybe hear what the Lord
[53:28] has put on our brother's heart and to
[53:31] see what the Lord can do in the heart of
[53:33] a Believer I believe that when we get
[53:35] together with the youth like this we're
[53:36] not speaking to
[53:38] um unbelieving youth we're speaking to
[53:41] youth who are believers and there really
[53:43] is nothing better than to hear a real
[53:45] experience of a believing youth and you
[53:48] know many times we can look at it and
[53:50] say you know if if someone is a Believer
[53:52] and and they step away from the word and
[53:55] and maybe they deny their own testimony
[53:57] from the perception that we have perhaps
[54:00] they're an unbeliever at that time
[54:01] that's not true
[54:03] a Believer is a believer
[54:05] and sometimes we just actually get out
[54:08] of our position that's what happens but
[54:10] it doesn't change Who We Are
[54:12] and I believe brother Toby has a
[54:14] powerful testimony for the Youth it's
[54:16] incredible to look at it and understand
[54:18] that the Lord will use anyone anytime
[54:21] anywhere and uh just because maybe it
[54:25] looks like our youth is going Wayward
[54:26] remember we talked about this brother
[54:28] Branham said don't call them Renegades
[54:30] they're not Renegades they're our
[54:32] children
[54:32] they're the best children on the planet
[54:35] because they're ours and we apply the
[54:38] token
[54:39] to our homes so we have youth banquet on
[54:42] the 26th whether Toby's going to take
[54:44] that and uh we're certainly excited to
[54:46] see what the Lord will do
[54:48] we had an amazing time of Fellowship
[54:50] yesterday at the Men's breakfast in
[54:52] Edmonton we had uh four of the brothers
[54:56] go up with me and it was just tremendous
[54:58] to hear how the Lord moves in people's
[55:00] lives there was uh it was a testimony
[55:03] service just to hear what the Lord Has
[55:05] Done in in our brothers lives and a
[55:08] brother from Tennessee brother Tim
[55:09] Calhoun he took the the Lion's Share of
[55:12] the of the meeting but we had three
[55:14] other brothers give their testimonies
[55:16] and brother Mervin was invited to speak
[55:18] as well and he didn't really give his
[55:20] testimony he just preached he's an
[55:22] evangelist he can't help it he he just
[55:25] pulled the pin and and let him have it
[55:27] and it was wonderful it was really good
[55:29] but we uh you know we heard a testimony
[55:31] yesterday one testimony I thought was in
[55:34] particular it was so good the brother
[55:35] was African and and he just said you
[55:38] know there was a time in his life where
[55:40] he had to come face to face with the
[55:41] pillar of fire himself he was raised in
[55:44] a Christian Church in a message church
[55:46] and he got married under the message
[55:48] Banner he married a message girl and and
[55:50] he was all about the message but there
[55:52] came a point in time where he actually
[55:53] had to meet the pillar of fire for
[55:54] himself often what he did was he
[55:56] recognized that there ain't no culture
[55:59] in Christ
[56:00] there's no African culture in the Holy
[56:03] Ghost there's no North American culture
[56:06] in the Holy Ghost this is what this
[56:07] brother was saying it was powerful to
[56:09] hear what he had to say he said he had
[56:12] to forget everything that he knew
[56:14] and get into Christ all of the
[56:17] traditional teachings to say that I have
[56:20] the ability to behave this way because
[56:22] of my culture because of where I come
[56:24] from and the way everyone over there
[56:26] does it and that over there could be
[56:28] maybe in Canada just in another another
[56:30] location
[56:32] you know what the other brother said is
[56:34] the North American culture is the worst
[56:36] he said that and why is that because
[56:39] we're rich increased with goods and we
[56:41] come to the place where we believe we
[56:42] have need of nothing I have the message
[56:44] of the hour I've got the message up I've
[56:46] got all the message books I've even gone
[56:47] to Jeffersonville
[56:49] but what good is it if you haven't met
[56:51] the pillar of fire yourself
[56:55] and that's what he got at yesterday it
[56:56] was powerful so if anyone's interested
[56:59] I've got the recordings and I can
[57:01] certainly just WhatsApp them to you if
[57:03] you want to hear them and you'll be able
[57:05] to hear brother Victor he uh he's a
[57:07] brother in Edmonton a powerful testimony
[57:09] really good and and you know the
[57:11] fellowship just going up and coming back
[57:13] was just equally as good spending time
[57:15] with the brothers and just no pressures
[57:17] of life it was just wonderful
[57:19] so God bless you each one for for coming
[57:21] thank you for the wives the families to
[57:23] sacrifice your husbands for the day I
[57:25] think it was just a wonderful
[57:26] opportunity to to get together and
[57:29] fellowship around the things of the Lord
[57:31] you know to to go to another location
[57:33] and just to hear the Brethren speak and
[57:36] and to know that well we all come from
[57:38] different backgrounds different places
[57:39] and just to hear what the Lord has put
[57:42] on on the heart of the Believers is just
[57:44] tremendous
[57:46] you happy this morning
[57:49] certainly excited to see what the Lord
[57:51] has in store today we're talking about
[57:53] the Rich Young Ruler out of the message
[57:54] leadership and uh it's kind of from that
[57:59] thought that I had last week and we'll
[58:01] just see what the Lord will do as we go
[58:02] forwards it might be a few weeks it
[58:04] might just end today I don't know we
[58:06] just want to trust the Lord and follow
[58:07] him we want his leadership it's got to
[58:09] be his leadership but you know uh the
[58:12] thought about communion and Leadership
[58:14] and and we can't have communion true
[58:16] communion with the Lord unless we're
[58:17] willing to be led if we're not willing
[58:19] to be led then we can't truly have
[58:22] communion
[58:24] it's just the way it works this Young
[58:26] Ruler here the Rich Young Ruler he had
[58:28] done everything he kept everything right
[58:30] in his life he was perfectly Polished in
[58:34] the scripture we just read it we know it
[58:36] everything was correct in his life all
[58:38] of of his behavior was right in line
[58:41] with the word call it the message of the
[58:43] hour for his day he was right in line
[58:45] with it but when he came to that place
[58:48] in his life where he met the pillar of
[58:51] fire himself he had the opportunity to
[58:54] say ah I'm gonna forget all I know and
[58:58] follow your instructions or I'm gonna
[59:01] just be sad and walk away and say I just
[59:03] assume there's no way I can't walk away
[59:05] from everything that I think I know all
[59:07] of my behaviors everything that I do is
[59:09] fine he was positionally placed he was
[59:12] in that position to meet the pillar of
[59:14] fire himself the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:17] here we go talking about it again the
[59:19] punch line brothers and sisters we've
[59:21] got to be willing to come to that Pillar
[59:23] of Fire ourselves and when we come and
[59:25] we actually meet that Pillar of Fire
[59:27] ourselves himself we're faced with a
[59:30] choice to take what we think we know and
[59:33] go forwards
[59:35] or to take what he tells us to do and
[59:37] forget all we know and just go forwards
[59:40] and you know unless we're willing to
[59:42] actually do that unless we're willing to
[59:44] let go of all of our preconceived
[59:46] notions and our teachings and our
[59:48] ideologies and you know we heard
[59:50] Brothers talking about it our family
[59:52] idols
[59:53] what can a family Idol be maybe it's a
[59:56] teaching that we were given that doesn't
[59:57] line up with the message of the hour if
[59:58] we're willing to say I'm willing to keep
[1:00:00] that teaching
[1:00:01] and mix it with the message that becomes
[1:00:03] a family Idol it can be getting between
[1:00:06] us and God and and if we can't match it
[1:00:09] up with the message of the hour or the
[1:00:10] word we just need to let it go just set
[1:00:12] it down don't worry about it you don't
[1:00:14] have to make a big deal about it you
[1:00:15] don't have to go to your family and try
[1:00:16] and say this is wrong I'm going to have
[1:00:19] a fight because I've learned the word of
[1:00:20] God says something different no just set
[1:00:22] it down just just set it down and go
[1:00:25] forwards
[1:00:26] but here we have this Rich Young Ruler
[1:00:29] he was raised according to the word for
[1:00:31] his day brother Bradham and the message
[1:00:33] leadership it was the second last
[1:00:34] recorded message that brother Branham uh
[1:00:37] preached is is where I'm coming from
[1:00:38] this morning leadership and and then the
[1:00:41] next message right after that was
[1:00:42] communion
[1:00:43] you've got to be willing to be led in
[1:00:45] order to have communion with the Lord
[1:00:47] and we talked a little bit about it last
[1:00:48] week I'll do a quick recap as we go
[1:00:50] forwards but in the beginning of this
[1:00:52] message brother Branham he says his text
[1:00:54] is follow me
[1:00:56] follow me and the subject is actually
[1:00:59] leadership so that message is called
[1:01:00] leadership but he's saying the subject
[1:01:03] is follow me
[1:01:06] and he says I want to approach it from a
[1:01:08] different way I think it's just
[1:01:09] beautiful to to look at it that way to
[1:01:12] to maybe take a step backwards and say
[1:01:14] maybe I can just take a look at it from
[1:01:16] a different angle maybe just a different
[1:01:18] way and and see what the prophet of God
[1:01:20] has to say about it
[1:01:24] we can't just say that I I have done it
[1:01:26] once and and it's once and for all and
[1:01:29] and it's good even though when we're
[1:01:31] sealed we're sealed until the day of our
[1:01:33] Redemption this is where it can become
[1:01:35] very confusing in a paradox we heard the
[1:01:37] brother say it yesterday you know unless
[1:01:39] we're willing to actually die out to
[1:01:40] ourselves every single day of Our Lives
[1:01:44] we're in trouble
[1:01:46] we've got to be willing to die out to
[1:01:48] ourselves every single day of our lives
[1:01:49] and we have to do it we have to have
[1:01:52] that that leadership where we can have
[1:01:55] that true communion in our lives
[1:01:57] but true leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:59] leads us to communion leads us to that
[1:02:02] desire to get on our knees that desire
[1:02:04] to pray continuously that desire to just
[1:02:07] be in fellowship with the Saints
[1:02:10] you know being led of his Spirit takes
[1:02:13] us and and positionally placed Us in in
[1:02:16] our promised land in our inheritance and
[1:02:18] that's why we say we need to get the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost we need to cross over Jordan
[1:02:21] we need to make sure that we understand
[1:02:23] what it means to cross over Jordan again
[1:02:25] in our Promised Land we've talked about
[1:02:27] that
[1:02:28] um a long time
[1:02:30] the children of Israel being able to
[1:02:32] cross over and it wasn't just so that
[1:02:33] they could cross over and say praise the
[1:02:35] Lord I've crossed over I've come out of
[1:02:36] bondage and and here I am I'm in the
[1:02:38] promised land even though they could say
[1:02:39] that but we know there is a time in
[1:02:42] Joshua where he went to those seven
[1:02:43] tribes that did not do anything they
[1:02:45] were just over there they helped their
[1:02:46] brothers they were really good workers
[1:02:48] and they got everyone positionally
[1:02:49] placed but they themselves weren't there
[1:02:52] yet and Joshua Jehovah savior the Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost came around and said to them how
[1:02:56] long are you going to be slack in going
[1:02:58] forwards to possess your promise
[1:03:01] I think it's wonderful because I believe
[1:03:03] that's the job of the fivefold ministry
[1:03:05] today to encourage people to keep going
[1:03:07] don't just settle don't just stop don't
[1:03:10] just get tired and and say I've gone as
[1:03:12] far as I can go and I can't go any
[1:03:13] farther we got to go all the way
[1:03:15] brothers and sisters and we're not
[1:03:16] willing to leave any behind
[1:03:19] but we're looking at getting into our
[1:03:20] positions and our positions isn't a
[1:03:22] position in a church to say that I've
[1:03:24] got a church office or I've been in a
[1:03:26] church for a certain amount of time it's
[1:03:28] not about that it's about getting into
[1:03:30] our position in Christ Jesus we sang the
[1:03:32] songs of Zion this morning about Jesus
[1:03:35] the name of Jesus that's our ultimate
[1:03:37] goal God bless you brother Faron for
[1:03:39] being led of the spirit to take us and
[1:03:41] lead us through the songs of worship
[1:03:43] about Jesus because there's one name
[1:03:46] that Satan hates and that's the name of
[1:03:48] Jesus but you know brothers and sisters
[1:03:50] if we can say that name and something
[1:03:53] inside of us resounds then we've got
[1:03:55] something to Rejoice about
[1:03:58] we have something to Rejoice about
[1:04:00] because we are being positionally placed
[1:04:03] in our inheritance and you know taking
[1:04:06] that a little bit further we talked
[1:04:07] about it last week I believe and we've
[1:04:09] been talking about it on Wednesdays and
[1:04:10] our position in Christ Jesus brothers
[1:04:12] and sisters is coming to church and is
[1:04:14] recognizing the message of the hour but
[1:04:17] where is our position in our families
[1:04:19] are we living in our families according
[1:04:21] to the word of God because if we're not
[1:04:23] then are we truly positioned in Christ
[1:04:26] our position in our family is so
[1:04:29] incredibly important and we said this
[1:04:31] before brothers and sisters the devil is
[1:04:33] roaming around as a roaring lion seeking
[1:04:35] whom he may devour and I can promise
[1:04:37] every single one of us who have children
[1:04:39] the devil wants your children and he's
[1:04:41] going to do everything he can to get us
[1:04:43] out of order out of our position so that
[1:04:45] we don't have that token on display in
[1:04:47] our lives but if we can keep that token
[1:04:50] on display and stay in our position and
[1:04:52] maybe if we're not in our position get
[1:04:54] in our position then Satan won't have
[1:04:56] any success
[1:04:57] in our lives in our families
[1:05:01] you know we're talking about our
[1:05:04] position in Christ but it comes down to
[1:05:06] our position in our families and then it
[1:05:10] goes a little further to our position in
[1:05:12] the body
[1:05:13] and sometimes we can have one of those
[1:05:15] positions but maybe not the other two or
[1:05:18] maybe two and not the other one but you
[1:05:20] know to have all of that to be
[1:05:22] positionally placed in Christ we need to
[1:05:24] have our position in every one of those
[1:05:26] and maybe we don't find ourselves in a
[1:05:29] position where I'm exactly where I want
[1:05:31] to be but you know we need to know that
[1:05:33] in our heart of hearts we're striving to
[1:05:36] get into that position because that's
[1:05:38] what God's looking for he's not looking
[1:05:40] for someone who's perfectly Polished
[1:05:41] Church isn't for the perfectly refined
[1:05:44] individual church is for the broken
[1:05:46] people churches for the ones that really
[1:05:48] need help I remember when I was in the
[1:05:50] world I looked at people that went to
[1:05:51] church and I said they're losers they're
[1:05:53] weak because they can't stand on their
[1:05:55] own but truly they're not they're the
[1:05:57] ones that recognize there's no hope in
[1:05:59] this world this world is empty and this
[1:06:01] world has no mercy because this world is
[1:06:04] controlled by Satan and if you choose to
[1:06:06] reject the word of God then you're going
[1:06:08] to be chewed up and spit out we're going
[1:06:11] to fight all of our way to either go to
[1:06:13] hell or we're gonna fight our way to go
[1:06:15] to heaven
[1:06:16] but we can choose
[1:06:18] we are given the opportunity to meet
[1:06:19] with that Pillar of Fire in our own
[1:06:21] lives and when we do get that choice our
[1:06:25] choice determines whether we can
[1:06:26] actually have true communion with him
[1:06:30] and boy if we can have true communion
[1:06:32] with him then there ain't nothing that
[1:06:33] can rattle us
[1:06:35] you can see people who have true
[1:06:37] communion with the Lord
[1:06:39] they're happy
[1:06:40] nothing can rattle them nothing can
[1:06:42] shake them because they're willing to be
[1:06:44] led
[1:06:45] but you know when we're not willing to
[1:06:47] be led when we say no I've got it it's
[1:06:49] good
[1:06:51] then you know it's troubling you can't
[1:06:52] have true communion we can have
[1:06:55] communion
[1:06:57] but you know look at Abraham
[1:06:59] look at the story of Abraham he was told
[1:07:01] to come out of his family we talked
[1:07:03] about this last week Abraham had to come
[1:07:05] out of his his Kindred his family had to
[1:07:08] leave it all behind he was a gentile but
[1:07:10] he is also a Hebrew the word says that
[1:07:12] he was a Hebrew he came out and actually
[1:07:14] had communion because he was willing to
[1:07:16] follow the leadership of the Lord to
[1:07:18] forget all that he knew
[1:07:20] and we know we talked about it before as
[1:07:22] well it goes on for communion and and to
[1:07:24] having communion in in the upper room
[1:07:27] with Melchizedek again
[1:07:29] because we know Melchizedek was Christ
[1:07:31] Melchizedek was the amorphous God and
[1:07:34] morphe changing his mask brother Branham
[1:07:37] talks about it and who is this
[1:07:38] Melchizedek he wasn't just another man
[1:07:40] he wasn't an ordinary man the word says
[1:07:42] that he was without father and he was
[1:07:43] without mother he was without beginning
[1:07:45] of days or ending of life he was without
[1:07:47] dissent who is that that's God himself
[1:07:52] the high priest of our confessions and
[1:07:54] he's willing to come and give us
[1:07:56] communion himself and I think it's so
[1:07:59] powerful when we can look at it brothers
[1:08:00] and sisters when we're faced with a
[1:08:02] communion service
[1:08:04] we can come and actually receive true
[1:08:06] communion
[1:08:07] by the leadership of the Lord in our
[1:08:09] lives it's not the leadership of a man
[1:08:11] it's an ordinance that God gave to the
[1:08:13] church to the Christian church today
[1:08:15] this generation to actually be served
[1:08:18] the bread and the wine to denote the
[1:08:21] victory in the Battle of overcoming
[1:08:24] being able to overcome your own will and
[1:08:27] fight you all of the enemy and actually
[1:08:29] bring back those who need to come back
[1:08:32] and you know really what we need to do
[1:08:34] is just recognize that we're the ones
[1:08:36] that need to come back we're the ones
[1:08:37] that need communion we're the ones that
[1:08:39] need leadership we're the ones that need
[1:08:41] the help
[1:08:42] it's not perfect individuals
[1:08:45] well we have a community service so that
[1:08:47] we can come and receive communion from
[1:08:49] Melchizedek now it might be crazy for me
[1:08:53] to say it that way but I just can't help
[1:08:54] but say it that way because brothers and
[1:08:56] sisters if you're coming to receive
[1:08:57] communion from the deacons you're coming
[1:08:59] for the wrong reasons
[1:09:01] communion service is about following the
[1:09:03] ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:09:06] recognize that we have the battles in
[1:09:07] our lives but we've been given a victory
[1:09:09] in those battles in our lives because we
[1:09:12] have the token we've been given the Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost in our day we've been given the
[1:09:15] direction through the prophet for our
[1:09:17] day the message of Malachi 4 to repent
[1:09:21] for our sins and get baptized in the
[1:09:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:09:26] remission of our sins so that we can
[1:09:28] receive the Holy Ghost true Christian
[1:09:29] baptism Acts 2 38 not coming according
[1:09:32] to get baptized in the name of the
[1:09:34] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:09:35] because those are titles it's a trick of
[1:09:37] the devil it's a doctrine of devils
[1:09:39] brother Branham says it's from Hell the
[1:09:41] trinitarian doctrine there's nowhere in
[1:09:43] the Bible it says to get baptized that
[1:09:45] way
[1:09:47] but anyways we have a community service
[1:09:49] for a purpose and that is so that we can
[1:09:51] come and declare our victory in what the
[1:09:53] Lord Jesus Christ has done for us we
[1:09:55] come and and and have a communion
[1:09:57] service because we know what he's done
[1:09:59] for us we're not interested in letting
[1:10:01] Satan Rob us of that opportunity to have
[1:10:04] a victory in our lives because you know
[1:10:06] what happens you know what happens every
[1:10:08] one of you I believe has been a part of
[1:10:10] a communion service and if you haven't
[1:10:11] been I recommend you try it because if
[1:10:13] you haven't experienced it when you
[1:10:15] leave this building you have a victory
[1:10:17] in your life there's something that
[1:10:18] happens in your life Supernatural
[1:10:21] through a communion service one of them
[1:10:23] is you're coming to outwardly express
[1:10:25] your willingness to accept his body that
[1:10:27] was broken for you the other one is your
[1:10:29] willingness to accept the blood that was
[1:10:31] shed for you the other one is your
[1:10:33] willingness to come and humble yourself
[1:10:35] before your brother your sister and wash
[1:10:37] their feet to recognize that that's
[1:10:39] deity in flesh
[1:10:41] and boy when you can humble yourself in
[1:10:44] all three of those ways something
[1:10:45] Supernatural takes place in your life
[1:10:49] I would say this Melchizedek serves you
[1:10:52] communion at that point and that's why
[1:10:55] we don't leave here the same after a
[1:10:57] communion service but it's a we know
[1:10:59] that it's a it's a it's a demonstration
[1:11:01] of the last supper and we read the
[1:11:03] scripture many times but the communion
[1:11:05] service there's a very important part of
[1:11:07] our Lives as a Christian believer for
[1:11:10] today a communion service really
[1:11:12] according to William Miriam Bradham
[1:11:14] isn't optional it's not something that
[1:11:16] we just put off and say you know I'll
[1:11:17] just do it when I feel like it and you
[1:11:19] know I just don't feel like it now so I
[1:11:21] just won't do it you know what when we
[1:11:23] don't feel like it that means there's an
[1:11:24] indicator there's a red flag going off
[1:11:26] and you know what I'll say is that red
[1:11:28] flag is the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:11:30] saying that hey there's something not
[1:11:31] right and you got to make it right so
[1:11:33] that you can come to that table but if
[1:11:35] you're not willing to make it right
[1:11:36] what's going to happen is that voice is
[1:11:37] slowly going to get quieter and quieter
[1:11:40] and quieter and quieter and quieter and
[1:11:42] eventually that voice won't even sound
[1:11:44] you won't even hear that voice and
[1:11:46] you'll be able to say hey you know what
[1:11:47] I don't I don't need to go to communion
[1:11:48] Services let's at me I'm doing okay
[1:11:50] everything in my life is just fine but
[1:11:52] is it fine do you still hear that voice
[1:11:56] Abraham accepted that leadership in his
[1:11:58] life in Genesis 12 1-4 and we know that
[1:12:02] he took lot
[1:12:03] he took lot out of his family this is
[1:12:05] just sort of recapping and lot was a
[1:12:07] penny brother Bonham said and Abraham
[1:12:09] was a silver dollar and and even though
[1:12:12] Abraham recognized he was just a penny
[1:12:14] he was still a part of God's economy and
[1:12:16] we know through the leadership of the
[1:12:18] Lord he understood that that lot his
[1:12:20] nephew had been taken even though he'd
[1:12:22] brought him out he felt responsible for
[1:12:24] him so he went after him and it was
[1:12:26] after that he brought lot out that he
[1:12:28] was actually served communion by
[1:12:30] Melchizedek he came God himself came and
[1:12:33] served him communion and I can only
[1:12:35] imagine in that time Melchizedek might
[1:12:37] have said to him and oh by the way this
[1:12:39] is just me talking here this isn't the
[1:12:40] Prophet this is anybody else this is
[1:12:42] just me but I believe he actually could
[1:12:44] have heard Melchizedek say to him and oh
[1:12:46] by the way as soon as you're willing to
[1:12:48] separate yourself from your nephew then
[1:12:50] we'll get back to business because after
[1:12:52] he brought lot out it wasn't until after
[1:12:55] he separated till the herdsmen had
[1:12:56] Strife until there was a problem until
[1:12:58] they separated that God came back and
[1:13:01] spoke to Abraham again according to the
[1:13:03] scripture here Abraham didn't hear until
[1:13:05] they parted ways but he was given the
[1:13:07] opportunity to go and save his nephew so
[1:13:09] that he could be served communion
[1:13:12] you know brother Bradham in in communion
[1:13:14] the importance of communion he says now
[1:13:16] in other words don't just come and take
[1:13:17] it as as I said a while ago about what
[1:13:21] the Jews their sacrifice they it was
[1:13:23] wonderful it was given by God
[1:13:25] but it got to a place where they didn't
[1:13:27] do it in sincerity and reverence and in
[1:13:30] order
[1:13:31] and it become it just become as tension
[1:13:33] as nose
[1:13:34] and you know what that is is when we
[1:13:36] just come to the communion table and we
[1:13:37] just do it because it's just what we do
[1:13:39] it's just on the calendar so we just
[1:13:40] come and do it and everything is good in
[1:13:42] our lives and sometimes that's what we
[1:13:44] need to do we just need to drag it and
[1:13:46] do it even though we don't really feel
[1:13:48] it and you know I would say personally
[1:13:49] that's Sometimes the best time but we do
[1:13:52] need to recognize the importance of
[1:13:53] communion and not make it something that
[1:13:55] we're just doing just because we're just
[1:13:56] told to do it we need to recognize the
[1:13:58] importance of it when we come to a
[1:14:00] communion service don't look at the
[1:14:01] deacons serving it look at them and see
[1:14:04] Melchizedek look at them and see the
[1:14:05] Lord Jesus Christ this is the one whose
[1:14:07] body was broken for me this is the one
[1:14:09] whose blood this represents that I'm
[1:14:11] partaking of I'm consuming this because
[1:14:13] this is a part of him and I am truly a
[1:14:16] part of him and I'm willing to recognize
[1:14:18] it brother Branham says they did it
[1:14:20] since without sincerity and evidence
[1:14:22] reverence in an order then it becomes
[1:14:24] just a stench in his nose now the same
[1:14:26] thing is by our coming to take the
[1:14:28] Lord's Supper that we must know we must
[1:14:31] come knowing what we are doing
[1:14:34] we like when you go to the water to be
[1:14:36] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:14:39] know what you're doing
[1:14:41] he says you're putting on
[1:14:43] to the church
[1:14:45] what God has put in you Christ
[1:14:49] when we take this
[1:14:51] it shows to the church that I believe
[1:14:55] every word of God I believe that he is
[1:14:59] the bread of life that's come from God
[1:15:02] out of heaven I believe every word that
[1:15:05] he says is truth and I live by it to the
[1:15:08] best of my knowledge God being my judge
[1:15:12] therefore
[1:15:13] before my brothers before my sisters
[1:15:17] I just think this is so powerful
[1:15:18] brothers and sisters
[1:15:20] he says I do not swear I do not curse
[1:15:25] I do not do these things because I love
[1:15:27] the Lord and the Lord knows it and bears
[1:15:29] me record
[1:15:30] therefore before you
[1:15:33] I take the parcel of his body to know
[1:15:36] that I am not condemned with the world
[1:15:39] see
[1:15:40] there you are then it's a blessing
[1:15:44] and I I know it for sure brothers and
[1:15:46] sisters well I'm talking about just
[1:15:48] coming to have communion because it's
[1:15:50] just on the calendar I'm guilty I'm not
[1:15:52] saying it because I think there's people
[1:15:53] out here I just know that I've lived
[1:15:55] that and I can only preach from where
[1:15:57] I've lived I've done it because I
[1:16:00] thought that maybe I'm a little
[1:16:02] holier than thou I can come to a
[1:16:05] communion service and some people can't
[1:16:06] you know what both of those are just is
[1:16:09] wrong not one of those is Right we've
[1:16:11] got to come with the right attitude the
[1:16:13] right mental attitude and here we have
[1:16:14] the prophet of God giving us the pattern
[1:16:16] for that attitude we've got to be
[1:16:18] willing to come to accept what the Lord
[1:16:20] has done for us
[1:16:23] therefore before you I take this parcel
[1:16:25] of body to know that I am not condemned
[1:16:27] with the world there you are then it's a
[1:16:29] blessing he says and remember I could
[1:16:31] give many testimonies on this where I've
[1:16:33] I've I've took took that and explained
[1:16:36] it in a sick room and seen them healed
[1:16:39] remember when Israel taken the type of
[1:16:42] this they had journeyed 40 years in the
[1:16:44] wilderness and the clothes never even
[1:16:47] wore out
[1:16:48] and they come out with one feeble one
[1:16:52] one among them with two million people
[1:16:55] as a type of this
[1:16:58] well what will the anti-type do
[1:17:01] this is just where it's it just uh in my
[1:17:03] mind it's like it goes nuclear that's
[1:17:05] Israel
[1:17:07] they lived in the wilderness for 40
[1:17:09] years and not one of them was feeble not
[1:17:11] one of them had their clothing wear out
[1:17:12] and that was under
[1:17:14] the blood of bulls and goats that was
[1:17:15] under the blood of a sacrifice and here
[1:17:18] we live under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:21] he says well what will the anti-type do
[1:17:23] if the body of a sacrificial animal did
[1:17:26] that for them what will the body of
[1:17:29] Jesus Christ Emmanuel do for us
[1:17:33] let's just be reverent when we come
[1:17:36] let us be just as reverent as we know
[1:17:38] how to come and I believe that's the end
[1:17:41] of that message brother branham's final
[1:17:44] words
[1:17:45] giving them to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:47] let's just be reverent brothers and
[1:17:48] sisters if you haven't experienced a
[1:17:51] communion service tonight is a communion
[1:17:53] service you have the opportunity
[1:17:55] and God knows God knows our hearts
[1:17:59] you know talking about leadership though
[1:18:01] in order to come to that place where we
[1:18:04] can have communion we've got to be led
[1:18:06] brother Branham talks about in this
[1:18:08] message leadership every single human
[1:18:10] being on Earth has to be led you come
[1:18:12] into the world being led by your mother
[1:18:13] by a good mother a good Godly mother is
[1:18:16] going to lead us in the way that we
[1:18:17] should go and as we actually get to the
[1:18:20] place where we can't help ourselves in
[1:18:22] in the end of our lives our bodies
[1:18:24] become feeble we're going excuse me
[1:18:26] we're going to have someone who is going
[1:18:28] to to lead us we all will be led in the
[1:18:31] middle we're taught in this world not to
[1:18:33] be led no we're taught to be strong and
[1:18:35] Lead our own lives and do our own things
[1:18:36] especially as the men the heads of the
[1:18:38] homes we can do what we want to do but
[1:18:41] we can do it so long as it lines up with
[1:18:43] the word of God
[1:18:44] brother random talks about the story of
[1:18:46] the the squirrel hunting in this in this
[1:18:49] message leadership and it's just a
[1:18:51] wonderful story he talks about the the
[1:18:53] old Infidel up on the hill there and how
[1:18:56] they they go along and and and they go
[1:18:59] and and drive to this place and his
[1:19:02] brother jumps out and and goes over and
[1:19:04] talks to him he tells brother Branham
[1:19:06] this man is a real Infidel and he does
[1:19:07] not like preachers and we know the story
[1:19:10] really well and he goes and and he's
[1:19:12] talking to this this brother Brown gets
[1:19:14] out of the car and goes over and starts
[1:19:16] talking to this Infidel and they have
[1:19:18] that exchange he says oh you're a
[1:19:19] minister are you he says well you're
[1:19:21] barking up the wrong tree and and he's
[1:19:24] meaning that in in the way that they're
[1:19:27] actually as a minister you're looking at
[1:19:28] the wrong place he says it's a lying dog
[1:19:30] and if you're barking up the wrong tree
[1:19:33] then you're looking in the wrong place
[1:19:35] and and this Infidel is trying to tell
[1:19:37] brother Branham that and brother Branham
[1:19:38] says you know you're welcome to your own
[1:19:40] opinion but he knew that he had already
[1:19:42] met that Pillar of Fire and that this
[1:19:44] man had just never met the same Pillar
[1:19:46] of Fire but he knew in the moment that
[1:19:49] this man was about to meet the pillar of
[1:19:51] Fire
[1:19:52] but here he tells him he's barking up
[1:19:54] the wrong tree
[1:19:55] but he says to him you know there's one
[1:19:58] man one man that I heard about one time
[1:20:01] if I could ever get a chance to talk to
[1:20:03] him how many times in our lives do we
[1:20:06] have that one desire just one not two
[1:20:09] not three just one desire to talk to
[1:20:12] that one person that would give us truly
[1:20:14] the answer that we're looking for
[1:20:17] he says there's one man I'd sure like to
[1:20:19] talk to and he goes on to explain how
[1:20:22] the old woman so and so up on the hill
[1:20:24] he says to brother Bradham I've been
[1:20:26] here for 70 years in these Hills all
[1:20:29] around and I've looked all around and
[1:20:31] I've looked for God and I just don't see
[1:20:32] him anywhere and brother Branham says
[1:20:34] well I guess it depends on what you're
[1:20:35] looking for
[1:20:36] and the same thing for us brothers and
[1:20:38] sisters what are we looking for today
[1:20:40] are we looking for a prophet to come
[1:20:42] back to finish something off are we are
[1:20:46] we looking for another messenger not the
[1:20:48] same Prophet uh what are we looking for
[1:20:51] brother we know Jesus said to them what
[1:20:54] did you go out into the Wilderness to
[1:20:55] see a a man in in soft Raymond in a
[1:21:00] fluffy cloak what are we looking for
[1:21:03] today in our lives
[1:21:05] that woman
[1:21:06] he says that woman so and so was up on
[1:21:09] the hill and how one day he heard her
[1:21:11] screaming and shouting and and they knew
[1:21:13] that she was sick with the cancer and
[1:21:16] and he said you know we thought the
[1:21:17] Salvation Army was up there there was so
[1:21:20] much screaming and yelling going on and
[1:21:21] he said well I guess we'll we'll have to
[1:21:23] it was in the evening time of course but
[1:21:26] I guess we'll have to get the wagon and
[1:21:27] go up in the morning they're about a
[1:21:29] mile up the hill and they were going to
[1:21:30] go and take the the body of the woman
[1:21:32] out to the main road
[1:21:34] the human mind just has an understanding
[1:21:37] that is not the same as the supernatural
[1:21:40] Vindicated power of God that we have but
[1:21:43] he tells this story about her screaming
[1:21:45] and yelling and and the beauty of it is
[1:21:48] in the morning they went out to get the
[1:21:50] wagon and they went up there to get the
[1:21:52] dead woman and he says you know I just
[1:21:54] couldn't believe it because we found
[1:21:55] this woman that we were assuming was
[1:21:57] dead that's why they were screaming and
[1:21:59] mourning and yelling but it was
[1:22:00] screaming and yelling Joy and what did
[1:22:04] they find they found her sitting there
[1:22:05] in a right mind eating fried apple pie
[1:22:08] from from dying of cancer to die any
[1:22:11] moment suddenly she's there eating fried
[1:22:13] apple pie
[1:22:15] brother Branham listening to this man
[1:22:18] this man said to him you know I'd sure
[1:22:20] like to find out
[1:22:22] what it was I'd like to talk to that man
[1:22:24] that was there
[1:22:25] and brother Branham had already had the
[1:22:26] discussion with him about what the
[1:22:28] intelligence is that tells the sap
[1:22:30] that's in the trees to leave the leaves
[1:22:32] and shoot down into the roots what
[1:22:34] intelligence is it that speaks to the
[1:22:36] trees and tells them to go and hide in
[1:22:39] the roots hide that life in the roots
[1:22:41] for winter so that you don't die
[1:22:44] that man says it's just nature it's just
[1:22:46] nature whether Bradham says okay if it's
[1:22:48] just nature then just take a bucket of
[1:22:49] water and put a stick in it and and see
[1:22:51] if that water goes up and down that
[1:22:53] stick if it's just nature it should do
[1:22:55] the same thing he says there's an
[1:22:56] intelligence behind it and that man says
[1:22:58] oh you might you might have something
[1:23:00] there brother Branham says yeah
[1:23:03] and he says you know if you can tell me
[1:23:04] when I come back what intelligence tells
[1:23:08] those leaves to go up and down I'll tell
[1:23:09] you it's the same intelligence that told
[1:23:11] me to go and heal that woman up on the
[1:23:13] hill there
[1:23:14] to pray for her and that man says you
[1:23:18] and he says would you recognize the name
[1:23:19] and he says yes we're all familiar with
[1:23:22] this this story it's such a powerful
[1:23:24] story but he says I led that old man to
[1:23:27] the Lord right there
[1:23:29] he could have said oh he's an Infidel we
[1:23:31] can't hunt over there I was just
[1:23:34] thinking about it how easy it would be
[1:23:35] to just simply dismiss the whole entire
[1:23:37] situation and miss the beauty of the
[1:23:40] leadership of the Lord in that situation
[1:23:42] and isn't it interesting because the
[1:23:44] natural circumstance to just go and hunt
[1:23:46] and have fun was actually the leadership
[1:23:49] of the Lord
[1:23:51] great
[1:23:52] so if you've never gone hunting let's go
[1:23:54] hunting
[1:23:57] you can have some really good Fellowship
[1:23:58] when you get outside of the city and you
[1:24:00] get out into the Hills brothers and
[1:24:01] sisters and you know I'll say this for
[1:24:03] me myself hunting is nice the meat is
[1:24:05] nice but the fellowship is what it's all
[1:24:07] about same thing about fishing it's the
[1:24:09] same thing if you ever want to go
[1:24:10] fishing maybe when it's yeah you know
[1:24:12] you could go fishing in the winter too I
[1:24:14] was going to say when it's nice out we
[1:24:15] can go fishing in the summertime but you
[1:24:17] can walk on water here
[1:24:18] in the winter if you want to
[1:24:21] but we all need leadership in our lives
[1:24:24] brothers and sisters not one of us can
[1:24:25] do it without and that's why this world
[1:24:27] is set up the way it is it's absolutely
[1:24:29] contrary to the word of God we all need
[1:24:32] leadership and there comes a point in
[1:24:34] time in every one of our lives where we
[1:24:36] will meet the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:24:38] himself and and we know that he's going
[1:24:42] to take us and he's going to call us and
[1:24:44] he's going to say you know
[1:24:47] I love everything about you but there's
[1:24:49] just this one thing and you know nobody
[1:24:52] can say in our lives what that one thing
[1:24:54] is only you can say what that one thing
[1:24:57] that he tells you about in your life but
[1:25:00] when he tells you about it you're faced
[1:25:02] with that up opportunity to accept it or
[1:25:05] to reject it and you know many times
[1:25:08] that opportunity comes in just a regular
[1:25:10] ordinary service I know for me it came
[1:25:13] on a regular ordinary Wednesday night
[1:25:15] service and I think about it what would
[1:25:17] happen if I just didn't come to church
[1:25:18] on a Wednesday night service I would
[1:25:20] have missed that Pillar of Fire in my
[1:25:22] life brothers and sisters there's so
[1:25:24] many opportunities in our lives to come
[1:25:26] to service to actually meet with the
[1:25:29] pillar of fire if we're coming to church
[1:25:31] to hear from the brother you're coming
[1:25:33] to church for the wrong reasons God uses
[1:25:35] human beings we know that he we know
[1:25:37] that he's got a five-fold Ministry
[1:25:39] there's there's the brothers we know
[1:25:41] that he uses all of that but brothers
[1:25:44] and sisters what's the intelligence
[1:25:46] behind those Brothers it's got to be
[1:25:48] more than just something that they've
[1:25:50] learned it's got to be more than just
[1:25:52] the office they hold it's got to be more
[1:25:54] than who they are it's got to be the
[1:25:56] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:00] it's got to be the Lord that leads us
[1:26:02] you know right now today we're all being
[1:26:04] led whether we know it or not you might
[1:26:07] say brother Barry I've got things under
[1:26:09] control of my life well we're either
[1:26:10] being led by God or we're being led by
[1:26:12] Satan
[1:26:13] and you know it's a constant battle to
[1:26:15] be led by one or the other
[1:26:17] and that's the Paradox about it we're
[1:26:19] being led by one or the other
[1:26:22] out of leadership brother Bradham talks
[1:26:24] about this he says that's the same thing
[1:26:27] that this boy was confronted with he
[1:26:29] come in
[1:26:30] he had been a member maybe of the
[1:26:32] Pharisees or Sadducees or some great
[1:26:35] order of that day he was religious as he
[1:26:37] could be he says I I observed these
[1:26:41] Commandments I've been taught since I
[1:26:43] was a youth see and Jesus he loved him
[1:26:46] for it we read that Jesus loved him
[1:26:48] Jesus turned and beholding him loved him
[1:26:52] he didn't despise him but we know the
[1:26:55] story it goes further to say that
[1:26:57] there's a point in time where he lifted
[1:26:59] up his eyes in hell
[1:27:01] he didn't lift up his eyes in the
[1:27:03] Abraham in the bosom of Abraham like the
[1:27:05] beggar
[1:27:07] he was as religious as could be he said
[1:27:09] I've observed these Commandments I've
[1:27:11] been taught since I was a youth see and
[1:27:13] Jesus loved him for it
[1:27:16] brother Brown speaking he says but he
[1:27:18] refused to be guided
[1:27:20] he refused to be guided
[1:27:23] he refused to accept the real leadership
[1:27:26] of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life
[1:27:31] I'm saying this with respect to this
[1:27:34] brothers and sisters our leadership
[1:27:35] can't be a church
[1:27:38] our church points to Jesus Christ
[1:27:41] we have got to meet the pillar of fire
[1:27:43] ourselves
[1:27:44] amen we have got to say I I know brother
[1:27:47] Barry's a good brother and I appreciate
[1:27:49] all that he says but but I want to hear
[1:27:51] what Jesus Christ has to say to me today
[1:27:53] because when we come to church with that
[1:27:55] attitude in our heart brothers and
[1:27:57] sisters brother Barry is going to step
[1:27:58] aside from the things that he thought
[1:28:00] that he prepared to talk about and he's
[1:28:02] going to start to speak to needs
[1:28:04] it's not going to be Barry Johnson it's
[1:28:07] going to be the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:28:09] pillar of Fire
[1:28:10] but if we refuse to accept leadership in
[1:28:13] our lives and we say no I know the
[1:28:15] message of the hour and I know brother
[1:28:17] Barry's parents I know his wife and I
[1:28:20] know his his in-laws I I know all of his
[1:28:23] faults and his failures I don't know why
[1:28:25] I'm doing this forgive me but if we do
[1:28:27] that brothers and sisters we're not
[1:28:29] going to receive the leadership of the
[1:28:31] Holy Ghost because this is the format
[1:28:33] that he's given us
[1:28:36] it's amazing to look at
[1:28:40] I don't make myself anyone I would say
[1:28:42] I'm the chiefest of Sinners here and I
[1:28:44] don't I don't I don't I don't even
[1:28:47] I feel like I don't even qualify to be
[1:28:49] here but you know what he chose it so
[1:28:51] the only thing that I can do is follow I
[1:28:54] know when that leadership comes brothers
[1:28:55] and sisters I learned that much in my
[1:28:57] life I'm not an educated man but I I
[1:29:00] know that when you meet that Pillar of
[1:29:01] Fire and he gives you a direction you've
[1:29:03] got to follow it and and I say that hey
[1:29:05] I still am learning to follow it because
[1:29:07] I know that he's leading me and I know
[1:29:09] that he's guiding me and there's things
[1:29:10] in my life that I still need to get
[1:29:12] right that aren't right and and it's
[1:29:14] just the way it is we're all humans and
[1:29:16] we're all growing and evolving but you
[1:29:18] know what if we're not growing and
[1:29:19] evolving we're dying
[1:29:21] we either have to be going forwards or
[1:29:23] we're going backwards in the Christian
[1:29:25] Walk we're not just standing still if
[1:29:27] we're just standing still we're going to
[1:29:28] get it
[1:29:31] but this boy he refused to accept the
[1:29:34] real leadership of Jesus Christ to give
[1:29:35] him eternal life he says notice he
[1:29:38] believed there was something different
[1:29:40] than what he had or he would have never
[1:29:44] said good Master what must I do now
[1:29:48] he knew there was something more
[1:29:50] he knew it he had been taught
[1:29:53] but he didn't appreciate what Jesus told
[1:29:56] him because all of his natural
[1:29:58] understanding now he had to let go of
[1:30:01] he had to say nope all of my family
[1:30:04] business I have to set it aside oh no
[1:30:06] all of the wealth that I've amassed he
[1:30:09] said to me lay it down because remember
[1:30:11] brothers and sisters the love of money
[1:30:13] is the root of all evil
[1:30:16] he goes on to say this notice he
[1:30:18] believed there was something different
[1:30:19] that he had or he would have never said
[1:30:22] good Master what must I do now see he
[1:30:26] wanted to do something himself
[1:30:28] he didn't want to accept the leadership
[1:30:30] that was given to him he was given the
[1:30:32] leadership Jesus Christ himself the word
[1:30:35] made flesh and dwelling among them was
[1:30:38] giving him Direction
[1:30:40] in his day
[1:30:41] see he wanted to do something himself
[1:30:43] that's the way we do that's that's what
[1:30:45] we
[1:30:46] that's sorry he wanted to do something
[1:30:49] himself that's the way we do we want to
[1:30:53] do something ourself the gift of God is
[1:30:56] a free gift God give it to you you don't
[1:30:59] do one thing for it he ordained it to
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:03] and you're going to have it see
[1:31:06] I love that there's nothing that we're
[1:31:08] going to do to stop it the only thing
[1:31:10] that we're going to do is maybe avoid
[1:31:12] some bumpy roads along the way to get
[1:31:14] there as Believers but today in our
[1:31:17] lives brothers and sisters I can't help
[1:31:18] but think it how do we do
[1:31:20] we do we follow the leadership of the
[1:31:23] word in our lives and our families in
[1:31:25] our church at our jobs
[1:31:27] and and we know that we've talked about
[1:31:28] this and I probably mentioned it last
[1:31:30] week but I'm mentioning it again how in
[1:31:32] in Wednesdays we've talked about this
[1:31:34] Ephesians lays out the pattern for
[1:31:36] husbands wives and children and even
[1:31:38] employees
[1:31:40] we have the ability to apply this in our
[1:31:42] lives
[1:31:43] you know it's impossible it's possible
[1:31:45] as an employee to actually not be living
[1:31:48] our life according to the word of God if
[1:31:50] we waste time as an employee if we talk
[1:31:53] back to our masters our our bosses if we
[1:31:56] talk bad about them are we serving God
[1:31:59] we're not
[1:32:01] maybe we are but we're not pleasing them
[1:32:04] you know we talked about First
[1:32:05] Corinthians chapter 13 being a spiritual
[1:32:07] barometer if we want to check in once in
[1:32:09] a while and see how we're doing in our
[1:32:11] lives as a husband as a wife as a child
[1:32:14] as a student as an employee we have the
[1:32:16] opportunity to do that to see if we have
[1:32:19] those attributes living out in our lives
[1:32:21] this right Rich Young Ruler brother
[1:32:23] Branham talks about them he was a young
[1:32:25] businessman and and he had a real belief
[1:32:28] he he he had Jesus beholding him and
[1:32:31] loving him he was brought up right by
[1:32:33] his parents and taught right according
[1:32:35] to the word for his day
[1:32:37] but he knew he did not possess eternal
[1:32:40] life is what brother Branham said he he
[1:32:42] said to him not what should I stop doing
[1:32:44] what should I do and I think it's so
[1:32:47] critical to recognize how how brother
[1:32:49] Branham talks about this in the second
[1:32:51] last message of his life he doesn't say
[1:32:54] what should I stop doing what should I
[1:32:56] do is what he says as Believers of this
[1:32:59] message of the hour brothers and sisters
[1:33:01] I think that we ought to stop looking at
[1:33:03] what have we done in the past what
[1:33:05] should we stop doing and start pressing
[1:33:07] towards the mark for the prize of the
[1:33:09] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and
[1:33:11] say what must I do to inherit the
[1:33:14] kingdom of God what must I do to see the
[1:33:16] full manifestation of this word in my
[1:33:19] life what must I do to have that Pillar
[1:33:22] of Fire walking with me in my life get
[1:33:25] that Pillar of Fire to just come down
[1:33:27] and actually burn out all of the old me
[1:33:29] so that that old me is no longer driving
[1:33:32] me that old me just goes to a position
[1:33:34] of influence it's not the position of
[1:33:36] author Authority in my life
[1:33:39] but if we're not willing to actually
[1:33:40] meet that Pillar of Fire face to face
[1:33:42] and have that real honest conversation
[1:33:44] that can never happen
[1:33:46] that leadership of the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:33:48] Lives will always be just right there
[1:33:50] it'll be just right there but it might
[1:33:51] not be all the way
[1:33:53] and what
[1:33:55] we saw that yesterday brother Mervin
[1:33:57] brought it up on the screen it was
[1:33:58] beautiful I I would like to get some of
[1:34:01] those Graphics brother right now I
[1:34:03] should have asked you about it but he
[1:34:04] brought up the graphic of the the body
[1:34:06] and the spirit and the soul the three
[1:34:09] circles and how sometimes we can just go
[1:34:12] and get stuck in the justification and
[1:34:15] then the sanctification we can get to
[1:34:17] that place where the Holy Ghost gets
[1:34:18] into our spirit it goes beyond our body
[1:34:20] we don't drink we don't smoke we don't
[1:34:22] party we don't listen to music we don't
[1:34:24] watch movies where everything in our
[1:34:25] life is good we get into our spirit and
[1:34:28] we get as far as our spirit our
[1:34:30] intellect and our reasoning and that's
[1:34:31] where we stop with the baptism of the
[1:34:33] Holy Ghost with that Pillar of Fire but
[1:34:35] if we don't go all the way into our soul
[1:34:37] brothers and sisters it doesn't become
[1:34:39] an inside job and it's got to go all the
[1:34:42] way down to our souls if it doesn't get
[1:34:45] in our souls then it doesn't change us
[1:34:46] the weight Right Way something will be
[1:34:48] able to shake us somewhere along the way
[1:34:50] someone will offend us something will
[1:34:52] offend us and before long it won't work
[1:34:54] out we'll we'll wind up in a situation
[1:34:56] that won't be good
[1:34:58] but when it gets into our very Souls
[1:35:00] nothing will shake us nothing will
[1:35:02] change us no no devil anywhere anytime
[1:35:05] anyhow will be able to take this message
[1:35:07] out of our lives
[1:35:10] but what must I stop doing is not what
[1:35:12] we need to be asking each one of us is
[1:35:15] confronted with this question about
[1:35:17] eternal life what must I do to inherit
[1:35:20] the kingdom of God what must I do to see
[1:35:22] this eternal life successful for me
[1:35:27] you know many times
[1:35:30] it's the ABCs
[1:35:32] it's not the Deep Mysteries we're not
[1:35:33] talking about the Deep Mysteries
[1:35:35] I wish that I was more consistent when
[1:35:37] it came to finances I'll just be honest
[1:35:41] but you know what I am consistent with
[1:35:42] is the word
[1:35:44] that's the one thing in my life that I'm
[1:35:46] consistent with and I know that if I'm
[1:35:48] consistent with the word then I'll get
[1:35:50] the right outcome because the word is
[1:35:53] the only thing that's going to change my
[1:35:54] body finances won't change my body even
[1:35:57] though we have to pay our bills we've
[1:35:59] got to be diligent with money but you
[1:36:01] know what if we could be as diligent
[1:36:02] with the word as we are with money in
[1:36:04] our lives brothers and sisters we might
[1:36:06] see a little bit of a difference
[1:36:08] David he had a leadership and just
[1:36:11] talking about leadership we can have
[1:36:12] leadership in our lives brothers and
[1:36:14] sisters and and maybe not just have the
[1:36:17] right leadership at the right time we
[1:36:19] can take leadership and apply it the
[1:36:21] wrong way in our lives and get the wrong
[1:36:23] outcome
[1:36:24] David had leadership in his life and you
[1:36:28] know they had the ark was sent back from
[1:36:31] the Philistines the the Philistines had
[1:36:33] the Ark of the Covenant for a while and
[1:36:35] it was in their Temple they thought
[1:36:37] we've got their God we've got him and
[1:36:39] and the Ark of the Covenant was
[1:36:41] underneath their gods and and the god
[1:36:43] Dagon just couldn't stand before the Ark
[1:36:45] of the Covenant when they had the Ark of
[1:36:47] the Covenant there they would stand them
[1:36:49] up and suddenly they would come back the
[1:36:50] next day and he'd be on his face before
[1:36:52] the ark that's no accident God was
[1:36:55] throwing down the enemy's Idols throwing
[1:36:57] down that that false god but what
[1:37:00] happened was that what did they do they
[1:37:02] sent the cart they sent the ark back to
[1:37:04] the to the to Israel to children of
[1:37:06] Israel but they put it on a new card is
[1:37:08] what the word says
[1:37:10] and it's interesting because David
[1:37:12] he knew that Ark was in the land and he
[1:37:14] said that art can't stay there that Ark
[1:37:16] needs to come up to my house that Ark
[1:37:18] needs to come to Jerusalem and it needs
[1:37:19] to be in the temple and when that Ark is
[1:37:22] there we know that God is going to be
[1:37:24] with us and we know that he got so
[1:37:26] excited and made all the preparations
[1:37:28] and what did he do he did everything
[1:37:30] brother Bradham says he had all the
[1:37:32] religious motion he did everything under
[1:37:34] the leadership the inspiration of the
[1:37:36] Holy Ghost in his life he did everything
[1:37:37] that he could to get that Ark back in
[1:37:39] its rightful position
[1:37:42] but the one thing that he didn't do was
[1:37:44] actually follow the levitical law
[1:37:46] and he built a new cart
[1:37:49] and it's interesting because it's
[1:37:50] exactly the same way that the enemy sent
[1:37:52] the cart back
[1:37:53] he picked up the cart and picked up the
[1:37:56] ark and brought it back and what
[1:37:57] happened a man lost his life an innocent
[1:37:59] man lost his life he had the right
[1:38:01] desire
[1:38:03] but he did it the wrong way
[1:38:05] and if we don't do it the right way
[1:38:06] ourselves brothers and sisters we could
[1:38:09] die this is life or death we're talking
[1:38:11] about and you know it's life or death
[1:38:13] for our children that we're talking
[1:38:15] about if we don't do it the right way we
[1:38:16] need to make sure that we're following
[1:38:18] the leadership of the Lord according to
[1:38:19] the word for our day
[1:38:21] we don't want to take the Ark of the
[1:38:23] Covenant and try and operate it the way
[1:38:26] that that David did or that the
[1:38:28] Philistines did and put it on a new cart
[1:38:30] the Ark of the Covenant the word for our
[1:38:32] day brothers and sisters is only
[1:38:33] designed to be carried over the heart
[1:38:36] only to be carried over the heart and
[1:38:37] some people might say well it's only
[1:38:39] designed to be carried over the heart of
[1:38:40] a levite but I would say it's got to
[1:38:42] come further than the levite the levite
[1:38:44] is the one that gives it out but then
[1:38:45] where do we carry that Ark of the
[1:38:47] Covenant in our lives brothers and
[1:38:48] sisters
[1:38:49] it's got to be on our own hearts but we
[1:38:53] can't do it according to the way that we
[1:38:55] think it should be done we have to do it
[1:38:57] I'm telling you we have to do it
[1:38:59] according to the word for our day if we
[1:39:02] don't do it according to the word for
[1:39:03] our day then we're not going to get the
[1:39:04] blessing we're looking for he says
[1:39:05] notice David thought everything was fine
[1:39:07] and he counseled all these people
[1:39:10] and they everyone begin to dance and
[1:39:12] shout and scream they had all their
[1:39:14] religious motions that there was but
[1:39:16] still it wasn't God's will to go down
[1:39:18] and bring the word of God back to the
[1:39:20] house of God
[1:39:22] isn't that wonderful to think though
[1:39:24] that when it did fall
[1:39:26] they took it into that man's house
[1:39:29] that man took it in and the word says
[1:39:31] that he was blessed from the moment that
[1:39:33] it reached his door even until after it
[1:39:36] left he was thoroughly blessed and you
[1:39:39] know brothers and sisters if we get that
[1:39:40] Ark of the Covenant in our lives it you
[1:39:43] can't help but be blessed by it
[1:39:45] he goes on to say but you see God always
[1:39:47] in all ages Works through one way his
[1:39:51] first decision is his only decision
[1:39:52] because it's perfect in his decision he
[1:39:56] never does anything except he first
[1:39:58] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[1:40:01] that's exactly and that's it's just so
[1:40:04] beautiful when we can recognize Amos 3 7
[1:40:07] if we're wondering if God truly sent a
[1:40:10] prophet I I know we're preaching to the
[1:40:13] choir here but sometimes there's people
[1:40:14] listening that maybe don't understand
[1:40:16] this maybe there's sometimes people that
[1:40:18] will listen to this later that haven't
[1:40:20] quite heard that God sent a prophet and
[1:40:22] if God did send a prophet but I would
[1:40:25] say this if God were to send a prophet
[1:40:27] wouldn't you want to hear what he had to
[1:40:29] say
[1:40:30] and if you heard what that Prophet said
[1:40:33] and you believed that it was a prophet
[1:40:35] wouldn't you want to live what he said
[1:40:37] wouldn't you want to take it all and
[1:40:39] apply it
[1:40:40] or would you just reject it and say no I
[1:40:42] can't I just I just you know I got this
[1:40:45] great life and I just can't you know and
[1:40:48] turn away you know what will happen at
[1:40:50] that point is we'll lift up our eyes
[1:40:51] sometime in hell and we'll say my my my
[1:40:53] my my
[1:40:54] I had that opportunity but I just chose
[1:40:57] to to take what I had in that moment and
[1:41:00] accept that to be my absolute brothers
[1:41:02] and sisters we got to be willing to
[1:41:04] leave our fathers our mothers our our
[1:41:06] Kindred we got to be willing to leave
[1:41:08] our jobs we've got to be willing to
[1:41:09] leave our homes everything that we think
[1:41:12] that we know we've got to be willing to
[1:41:13] walk away from to be able to get this
[1:41:15] holy ghost in our lives and I'm not
[1:41:17] saying that you need to do anything
[1:41:18] extreme don't go and sell everything and
[1:41:20] give it to the poor and and and and just
[1:41:23] just make a vow of poverty to serve the
[1:41:25] Lord God that's not what I'm saying what
[1:41:27] I'm saying is God needs to know that
[1:41:28] you're absolutely sold out unto him when
[1:41:31] he knows your heart is there then that's
[1:41:33] all he needs to do and you know nobody
[1:41:35] will ever know different because you
[1:41:37] won't look any different and Satan will
[1:41:39] come around and tell you you know
[1:41:40] different you're the same person
[1:41:42] but God will know and you'll know
[1:41:45] and you know that's one of the things
[1:41:46] one of the ordinances that I would say
[1:41:49] which is so important to us and and that
[1:41:51] is talking about tithing when we get
[1:41:53] that Revelation in our hearts brothers
[1:41:55] and sisters about tithing I'm not
[1:41:57] pulling for money don't get me wrong
[1:41:58] what I'm pulling for is for people to
[1:42:00] realize the full blessing the full
[1:42:02] manifestation of the blessing of the
[1:42:04] word of God in your home to see that Ark
[1:42:06] of the Covenant in your home to see the
[1:42:08] Lord bless you when you need help in
[1:42:10] your life but you know what I've heard
[1:42:12] Brothers say it and I think it's
[1:42:13] wonderful I got there myself and that's
[1:42:15] why I can talk about it I feel I got to
[1:42:18] the place where I couldn't wait to tithe
[1:42:19] because I knew the blessing that was in
[1:42:21] store for me and and I've talked about
[1:42:24] the tremendous testimony that I got for
[1:42:25] it the Lord just revealed to me how
[1:42:27] important it is to tithe but you know
[1:42:28] it's not about money at all maybe
[1:42:31] there's a little portion about it but if
[1:42:32] you're looking at it for money you're
[1:42:33] looking at it for the wrong reason
[1:42:34] you're missing the blessing the blessing
[1:42:36] is to recognize that you've got that Ark
[1:42:38] of the Covenant in your house and when
[1:42:40] you get sickness that comes knocking at
[1:42:42] your door when your children get sick
[1:42:43] when your children get upset when you
[1:42:45] have problems in your life then you can
[1:42:47] recognize hey I have come and I've
[1:42:50] applied the token according to the word
[1:42:51] the full entire blessing
[1:42:53] you know it's not just about tithing
[1:42:55] it's about communion it's about
[1:42:57] recognizing that's an ordinance that God
[1:42:58] has given us it's not something that we
[1:43:00] just say I can just take it or leave it
[1:43:02] I believe it therefore I participate in
[1:43:04] it
[1:43:05] brother Branham he goes on to say here
[1:43:07] but you see God always always in all
[1:43:09] ages Works through one way his first
[1:43:11] decision is his only decision because
[1:43:13] he's perfect in his decision he never
[1:43:15] does nothing except he first reveals it
[1:43:17] to his servants the prophets that's
[1:43:19] exactly that's why this the church age
[1:43:22] that we live in there's no church no
[1:43:24] Methodist no Baptist no Pentecostal and
[1:43:27] brother Berry will say no message
[1:43:29] believer
[1:43:31] or anything else can ever put this
[1:43:33] church into the bride
[1:43:35] it'll have to be the answering of
[1:43:39] Malachi 4 for God to send a prophet to
[1:43:43] be revealed to because that's the only
[1:43:45] way
[1:43:46] our churches denominate and throw the
[1:43:48] thing into a mess and huddle they just
[1:43:52] like they've always been and God always
[1:43:55] sends the prophet
[1:43:57] we're not interested in getting people
[1:43:59] to church here
[1:44:01] we want to get people to Christ
[1:44:03] getting people to church will make us
[1:44:05] look good and it might make us feel good
[1:44:07] but it won't get you to Christ you won't
[1:44:09] have that Ark of the Covenant in your
[1:44:11] home when you need it brothers and
[1:44:12] sisters
[1:44:13] if we can get that Ark of the Covenant
[1:44:15] in our homes that Pillar of Fire that
[1:44:18] rests upon that Mercy Seat my goodness
[1:44:21] but it's what messes people up
[1:44:24] sometimes we we feel like coming to
[1:44:26] communion and and having communion just
[1:44:29] doing that will actually get us the
[1:44:31] blessing and it's not we need to
[1:44:33] understand why we need to recognize the
[1:44:35] purpose of it
[1:44:36] just like coming to church on a Sunday
[1:44:38] why do we come to church on a Sunday we
[1:44:40] need to recognize the purpose of it we
[1:44:42] come to church on a Sunday to get Washed
[1:44:44] by the Water of the word it's through
[1:44:46] the fivefold ministry is the perfecting
[1:44:47] of the Saints that's what the scripture
[1:44:49] says that's why we come to church we
[1:44:51] don't come to church just to feel good
[1:44:53] in our lives even though you can't help
[1:44:55] but feel good when you actually get
[1:44:56] Washed by the Water of the word brothers
[1:44:58] and sisters like we talked about the
[1:44:59] stimulation of Revelation that comes
[1:45:01] from a communion service something
[1:45:03] happens to you supernaturally when you
[1:45:05] come and you meet with Melchizedek
[1:45:07] but uh we're looking for
[1:45:10] the word of God in our lives we're
[1:45:12] looking to see the Lord manifest in our
[1:45:14] lives we're not interested in just
[1:45:16] joining a church and being a part of a
[1:45:18] group
[1:45:19] and we certainly don't want to do it our
[1:45:21] own way
[1:45:22] if we try and do it our own way then
[1:45:24] we'll wind up like David
[1:45:25] we'll wind up like David and we'll have
[1:45:27] all the religious motion we'll go to
[1:45:29] Every service maybe even go to communion
[1:45:31] service but not just not have one thing
[1:45:33] right can can put it in a position where
[1:45:36] someone can lose their life
[1:45:38] you know brother Branham talks about it
[1:45:39] how our lives are such a witness that
[1:45:41] people actually
[1:45:43] can actually receive eternal life from
[1:45:45] seeing Our Lives lived
[1:45:46] people can actually choose to reject the
[1:45:48] word from seeing Our Lives lived also
[1:45:52] we need to be careful
[1:45:53] because like that song says brothers and
[1:45:56] sisters we are the word made flesh today
[1:45:59] because this is what the scriptures say
[1:46:02] you know we can have all the religious
[1:46:04] motion and all the best organizations
[1:46:07] and all of it
[1:46:09] might not be the way that God chose
[1:46:13] he wants to see that Ark of the Covenant
[1:46:15] in
[1:46:16] in the proper location and that's in our
[1:46:18] heart that's the mercy seat for today
[1:46:20] it's in a temple that's not built with
[1:46:22] hands
[1:46:24] but it's up to the people to accept it
[1:46:25] one way or the other
[1:46:27] God's permissive will
[1:46:30] or his perfect will
[1:46:32] and you know
[1:46:34] it's beautiful
[1:46:36] because like we talked about a little
[1:46:38] bit earlier when the Ark of the Covenant
[1:46:40] was coming up and it fell
[1:46:42] and that man put his hand forward and
[1:46:44] died he lost his life
[1:46:46] it wasn't because he didn't have the
[1:46:48] right intention
[1:46:50] he fully had the right intention the Ark
[1:46:52] of the Covenant was going to fall who
[1:46:53] would want to see that happen
[1:46:55] but it was still against the law of God
[1:46:58] but you know this this this brother
[1:47:01] the household of Obed Edom
[1:47:04] he was a goodite
[1:47:06] he had the word for three months in his
[1:47:09] house
[1:47:09] and the Lord blessed him
[1:47:12] and that was an opportunity for the Lord
[1:47:14] to show how he can take his permissive
[1:47:17] will and make it as perfect will
[1:47:20] because this brother wasn't expecting
[1:47:22] that blessing at all was he is probably
[1:47:24] going to go out and wave
[1:47:26] there goes the Ark of the Covenant past
[1:47:28] my house there goes the god of Israel
[1:47:31] The Mercy Seat itself in a parade going
[1:47:34] past my house with all the religious
[1:47:36] motion but what happened was that Ark of
[1:47:39] the Covenant came to his house brothers
[1:47:40] and sisters and you know if we are in
[1:47:43] our position the Ark of the Covenant
[1:47:44] wants to come to our houses too
[1:47:47] we can see that happen in our lives
[1:47:50] and you know looking at this story about
[1:47:52] the Rich Young Ruler in leadership
[1:47:54] we've got to be willing to accept it the
[1:47:56] way that God gives it to us in our day
[1:47:59] we can say you know I I think that it
[1:48:01] should have happened a different way and
[1:48:02] I would have liked it to be otherwise
[1:48:04] but you know the way that God gives it
[1:48:06] to us is the way that we need it
[1:48:09] otherwise he would have given it to us
[1:48:11] differently
[1:48:12] it would be in a different fashion
[1:48:15] this Rich Young Ruler out of leadership
[1:48:17] we know that it's accounted for in
[1:48:19] Matthew Mark and Luke where today we're
[1:48:21] reading out of out of Mark and brother
[1:48:24] Branham says that's the same thing that
[1:48:25] this boy was confronted with
[1:48:28] you come in
[1:48:29] been a member of the Pharisees or
[1:48:31] Sadducees or some great order of that
[1:48:33] day he was religious as can be
[1:48:35] he said I've observed all these
[1:48:37] Commandments I've been taught since I
[1:48:39] was a youth see Jesus loved him for it
[1:48:41] but he refused to be guided he refused
[1:48:44] to accept the real leadership of Jesus
[1:48:46] Christ give to give him eternal life
[1:48:51] he believed there was something
[1:48:52] different than what he had or he would
[1:48:55] never have said good Master what must I
[1:48:57] do now
[1:48:58] see he wanted to do something himself
[1:49:00] that's the way we do the way we want to
[1:49:03] do ourselves the gift of God is a free
[1:49:06] gift God give it to you
[1:49:08] you don't do one thing for it
[1:49:11] he ordained it to you and you're going
[1:49:13] to have it see
[1:49:15] I just think it's a beautiful thing to
[1:49:18] to recognize and I know I've read that
[1:49:20] quote already today but I just I'm
[1:49:22] reading it again because I think it's
[1:49:24] important for us to recognize there's no
[1:49:26] other way for us to do it other than the
[1:49:27] way that God has ordained for us in our
[1:49:29] day and when we want to try and mix
[1:49:31] something else with it brothers and
[1:49:33] sisters we're getting a hybrid religion
[1:49:34] it's not going to turn out the way that
[1:49:36] we want it to and and you know this
[1:49:38] story here this is where it's so
[1:49:40] beautiful and and where it becomes I
[1:49:42] believe alive to me alive to us in our
[1:49:45] lives I don't have great wealth and and
[1:49:47] a great fortune or even a little Fortune
[1:49:50] where I can say you know if God told me
[1:49:52] to just forget it all then I could
[1:49:54] comprehend maybe what that would mean
[1:49:56] but what what I want to get to today
[1:49:58] brothers and sisters is that he'll come
[1:49:59] around and he'll show us if we ask him
[1:50:01] earnestly what is there in my life Lord
[1:50:04] what what is there if I was that rich
[1:50:06] young ruler and I met you on the road
[1:50:08] today which you can meet for him today
[1:50:10] brothers and sisters even right now in
[1:50:12] this service if there's something in
[1:50:13] your life if you ask him he will reveal
[1:50:15] it to you but then you're faced with
[1:50:18] that moment of decision in your life
[1:50:20] this is what we want to get to this is
[1:50:22] the nuts and bolts of it all when he
[1:50:23] gives us that answer are we willing to
[1:50:26] accept it or do we say oh my I don't
[1:50:28] know if I can do that we know that the
[1:50:30] Rich Young Ruler lifted up his eyes and
[1:50:32] hell he wound up in a situation that was
[1:50:34] beyond his control he could not go back
[1:50:36] and fix it he had that one opportunity
[1:50:39] and when God gives us the opportunity in
[1:50:42] our lives to meet that Pillar of Fire
[1:50:44] are we willing to accept it or are we
[1:50:46] willing to say no I don't know I think
[1:50:49] everything that I've been taught is good
[1:50:50] and and everything that I've got right
[1:50:52] now is fine and it's just going to
[1:50:54] remain the same way you know it might do
[1:50:57] that in this life but what's going to
[1:50:59] happen do we actually get access to that
[1:51:02] eternal life and it just goes right back
[1:51:04] full circle to the Token right back full
[1:51:07] circle to getting the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:51:08] Lives when we get the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:51:09] Lives brothers and sisters when we do
[1:51:11] get that opportunity to say Lord what is
[1:51:14] it in my life that I need help with Lord
[1:51:15] help me find this problem help me solve
[1:51:18] this problem in my life when we do that
[1:51:20] and he gives us the answer for it when
[1:51:22] we have the Holy Ghost we'll say thank
[1:51:23] you Lord thank you Lord and we'll
[1:51:26] actually make a change in our life we
[1:51:28] will change what we're doing we'll
[1:51:29] change our Direction we'll change our
[1:51:31] trajectory and we'll make a difference
[1:51:34] but if he gives us the answer and we
[1:51:36] don't change how can that help us
[1:51:39] brothers and sisters I think it will
[1:51:41] come to the place in our lives where
[1:51:42] we're going to start getting right down
[1:51:44] to the nitty-gritty where ananias and
[1:51:47] Sapphira times will be upon us and we
[1:51:49] will not be able to hide who we are and
[1:51:52] what we believe in we will stand out we
[1:51:54] will show who we are and the only way
[1:51:56] that we're going to show that we're a
[1:51:58] part of his kingdom that we have met
[1:52:00] that Pillar of Fire and that we have
[1:52:01] accepted his leadership in our lives and
[1:52:03] that we are able to go on to True
[1:52:05] communion is to show the true holy ghost
[1:52:07] in our lives saying Amen to every word
[1:52:09] not every word that brother Berry says
[1:52:11] every word the prophet of God said every
[1:52:13] word that the Holy Ghost says through
[1:52:15] the word that he gives us
[1:52:17] out of leadership he says notice he knew
[1:52:20] it was there the Rich Young Ruler knew
[1:52:22] it was there he knew there was something
[1:52:23] there he knew it was there he believed
[1:52:26] in it and he wanted it but when he was
[1:52:28] confronted with how he had to do it it
[1:52:32] was different from his ritual
[1:52:35] it was different
[1:52:37] how many times in our lives can we just
[1:52:39] get a little bit outside of our ritual
[1:52:40] oh my
[1:52:42] is it right is it wrong if it lines up
[1:52:44] with the scriptures brothers and sisters
[1:52:46] I'd say get outside of your ritual all
[1:52:47] day long go for it and see if God won't
[1:52:50] bless it if it lines up with the word if
[1:52:52] it does line up with the word just leave
[1:52:54] it alone
[1:52:57] it was different from his ritual brother
[1:52:59] Branham says it was different
[1:53:01] he could hold on to his money and belong
[1:53:04] onto one on onto the church that he
[1:53:07] belonged to and so forth
[1:53:09] but Jesus knew that
[1:53:12] and Jesus knew that he had hoarded this
[1:53:14] money
[1:53:16] he loved his money he hoarded it
[1:53:19] and he said go sell all you've got and
[1:53:21] give it to the poor
[1:53:23] and come take up your cross and follow
[1:53:25] me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven
[1:53:27] but that Rich Young Ruler he just
[1:53:29] couldn't do that he loved his money
[1:53:32] but you know brothers and sisters we
[1:53:33] just said it a minute ago I'm going to
[1:53:34] say it again
[1:53:36] it can be anything in our lives
[1:53:39] that one thing that we know about
[1:53:41] that God he speaks to us about it
[1:53:44] and we have the opportunity to accept it
[1:53:46] or to reject it and and isn't it
[1:53:49] wonderful
[1:53:50] does anybody hear his voice does anybody
[1:53:52] have this problem this thing in their
[1:53:54] lives where God speaks to us and gives
[1:53:55] us this leadership I I just trust that
[1:53:58] I'm I'm I'm I'm talking to people of
[1:54:00] like Precious Faith here because I feel
[1:54:02] it in my life but when he does that
[1:54:04] we're given the opportunity and and I
[1:54:06] just think it's amazing because in my
[1:54:08] life if if I were to be living under the
[1:54:11] law and and to just the moment that I
[1:54:14] reject it in my life
[1:54:16] I should be dead according to the law I
[1:54:20] I should have just been thrashed long
[1:54:22] ago even as a Believer and maybe even as
[1:54:25] a pastor because I'm just human the only
[1:54:28] thing I can do is step into an office
[1:54:29] and allow the Lord pray that the Lord
[1:54:31] operates it and you know that it's the
[1:54:33] people that actually operate the gift
[1:54:35] it's not the pastor that does it but you
[1:54:38] know it's interesting because I just
[1:54:39] can't help but think about his
[1:54:41] long-suffering and his kindness towards
[1:54:43] me his long suffering and his
[1:54:45] forgiveness because he'll say you've got
[1:54:47] this thing and and he'll say it today
[1:54:49] and tomorrow I'll get up in the morning
[1:54:51] and he'll say you've got this thing and
[1:54:54] the next day I'll get up and he'll say
[1:54:56] you've got this thing and the next day
[1:54:58] he'll say you got this thing in the next
[1:55:00] month and the next year you got this
[1:55:03] thing his long-suffering his kindness
[1:55:06] and gentleness towards me I I have
[1:55:08] reason to shout reason to Rejoice
[1:55:10] because he does care enough to lead me
[1:55:13] and guide me and tell me you've got this
[1:55:15] thing buried you you need to deal with
[1:55:17] it and and when I don't deal with it he
[1:55:19] comes around and tells me you need to
[1:55:21] deal with it my goodness it's so
[1:55:24] tremendous to think about his goodness
[1:55:25] to me
[1:55:27] brother Branham says he could hold his
[1:55:29] money and belong to the church that he
[1:55:31] belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew
[1:55:33] that and knew that he had hoarded his
[1:55:35] money and he said go sell you God give
[1:55:37] to the poor come take up your cross and
[1:55:39] follow me and you'll have Treasures in
[1:55:41] Heaven but he couldn't do it
[1:55:45] and you know as much as we struggle and
[1:55:47] strive in our lives and and we we feel
[1:55:49] like we just can't make a difference in
[1:55:52] our lives Brothers and Sisters Day by
[1:55:54] Day word sell upon word cell we are
[1:55:56] making a difference and you know we're
[1:55:59] not making a difference he's making a
[1:56:01] difference
[1:56:02] because we're not who we used to be and
[1:56:04] sometimes we just need to zoom out and
[1:56:06] reflect like brother Cadre said I know
[1:56:08] that I'm not who I want to be but I'm
[1:56:10] sure not who I used to be oh Lord have
[1:56:13] mercy and just keep talking to me and so
[1:56:16] long as we're willing to keep Fellowship
[1:56:17] in with him he'll keep fellowshipping
[1:56:19] with us
[1:56:21] oh this Rich Young Ruler he was told
[1:56:23] just get rid of it all throw down
[1:56:25] everything you think you know get rid of
[1:56:27] it I'll give it all to the poor whatever
[1:56:28] it is in your life that's holding you
[1:56:30] back you know what it is just lay it
[1:56:32] down and follow me take all that you
[1:56:35] think you know and throw it all to the
[1:56:37] wind and just follow me and see if I
[1:56:39] won't bless you and we all know what
[1:56:41] that is in our lives and if we're
[1:56:42] willing to do that brothers and sisters
[1:56:44] sometimes it's not the whole shooting
[1:56:46] match sometimes it's not the whole whole
[1:56:48] whole
[1:56:49] I don't know call it a ball of wax it's
[1:56:51] not everything all at once it's little
[1:56:53] by little but brothers and sisters so
[1:56:55] long as you're willing to make a step an
[1:56:56] effort and show him that little by
[1:56:58] little I'm actually making a difference
[1:57:00] I'm trying in my life to change things
[1:57:02] so that I can actually follow you he
[1:57:05] knows it he knows our hearts but he
[1:57:07] knows if we're just willing to reject it
[1:57:09] and say oh no I'm not interested in that
[1:57:11] I can't do that
[1:57:12] I'm not I'm not trying to say what it is
[1:57:14] in your life what I'm saying is his
[1:57:16] leadership shows you in your life
[1:57:18] and we're all faced with that problem
[1:57:20] because whatever that problem is it's
[1:57:22] holding us back from eternal life it's
[1:57:24] holding us back from going into that
[1:57:25] position and until we get to that
[1:57:27] position where we're all positionally
[1:57:28] placed in Christ Jesus right now here on
[1:57:31] Earth on this side of Eternity than the
[1:57:33] Rapture ain't gonna go but boy once we
[1:57:36] recognize who we are when we recognize
[1:57:38] what we are brothers and sisters this
[1:57:40] world isn't going to have any more hold
[1:57:41] on us
[1:57:42] isn't it amazing to think about how this
[1:57:45] world is right on the brink teetering
[1:57:47] right on the very brink of Eternity we
[1:57:50] know that when the bride goes up there's
[1:57:52] three and a half years left right
[1:57:54] three and a half years left on this
[1:57:56] Earth of tribulation and then we go to
[1:57:59] the white Throne then we go into
[1:58:01] tremendous tremendous change of
[1:58:04] everything the skies roll back like a
[1:58:06] scroll like we've heard about so many
[1:58:08] times we've sang those songs
[1:58:10] we're on the brink of Eternity right now
[1:58:12] today
[1:58:14] we know the the discussion about whether
[1:58:16] a bomb goes off and the bride will go
[1:58:19] home
[1:58:20] I just want to say this and and maybe we
[1:58:23] could have a discussion about it I think
[1:58:24] it's important though
[1:58:25] we were talking a little bit about this
[1:58:27] on the way up yesterday
[1:58:30] but you know sort of in our morning
[1:58:31] devotions we're talking about it how the
[1:58:33] word says in in the in the Visions in
[1:58:36] 1933 that a bomb is going to go off in
[1:58:39] the United States of America and and
[1:58:41] it'll be a smoldering ruin and we all
[1:58:44] sort of understand that and we look
[1:58:45] towards that and we know brother Branham
[1:58:47] said it's a nuclear bomb it's going to
[1:58:49] be a nuclear bomb and it you know what
[1:58:51] the USA's name is on that nuclear bomb
[1:58:53] and and it can be real easy to look at
[1:58:56] that and say that's the promise that
[1:58:58] that we're looking for because before
[1:58:59] one of those goes off we're going home
[1:59:03] but sometimes people can actually say a
[1:59:05] quote in such a way that it doesn't say
[1:59:07] exactly that
[1:59:08] and what I'm getting at is we can say
[1:59:10] before one bomb goes off
[1:59:12] the bride goes home so what happens if a
[1:59:15] strategic nuke goes off in the Ukraine
[1:59:19] and the bride doesn't go home
[1:59:21] does that mean we've missed the rapture
[1:59:24] I think it's important to talk about
[1:59:26] because we could see that happen today
[1:59:28] in our lives we could see it happen and
[1:59:30] are we ready to go home
[1:59:33] we need to make sure that we're ready to
[1:59:34] go home but if it goes off somewhere
[1:59:36] else brothers and sisters that doesn't
[1:59:37] mean we've missed the Rapture is my
[1:59:39] point
[1:59:40] we need to make sure that we're looking
[1:59:41] for the right thing and the right thing
[1:59:43] not that we're looking for it don't get
[1:59:44] me wrong we're not looking to see the
[1:59:45] United States of America destroyed we're
[1:59:47] looking to go to Glory but we know
[1:59:49] before the United States of America gets
[1:59:50] destroyed the bride goes home
[1:59:52] if it's if if a nuclear bomb goes off
[1:59:55] somewhere else that doesn't mean that
[1:59:56] we've missed it
[1:59:58] totally sidetracked there
[2:00:00] we need to know that we've got it fixed
[2:00:02] up that we've got it right we need to
[2:00:04] know that our hearts are correct and
[2:00:06] like I said brothers and sisters
[2:00:08] sometimes we have things in our lives we
[2:00:09] can get ourselves into positions where
[2:00:11] we can't make a change I'll tell you
[2:00:13] honestly just so you can hear a real
[2:00:15] life example we got into a position
[2:00:17] where we had a business in our lives
[2:00:18] that was running us
[2:00:20] people should have a business that they
[2:00:22] run right that's the way it should work
[2:00:24] but we got to a place where a business
[2:00:25] was absolutely running us my wife and
[2:00:28] myself were so completely busy we had no
[2:00:31] time for each other we had no time for
[2:00:32] our children and we barely had time for
[2:00:34] church
[2:00:35] That's The Way We Were
[2:00:37] but by the grace of God he has
[2:00:38] intervened and helped us in our lives
[2:00:40] and it's been Supernatural the way it's
[2:00:43] happened
[2:00:44] but brothers and sisters we couldn't
[2:00:46] just say you know this business that
[2:00:49] we've got we're just gonna
[2:00:50] throw it away
[2:00:52] and God's going to bless us
[2:00:54] I'm not saying that that's what we need
[2:00:56] to do in our lives he'll show us things
[2:00:57] in our lives that we need to change
[2:01:00] but so long as we've got the right
[2:01:02] mental attitude towards any promise of
[2:01:04] God he'll bring it to pass in our lives
[2:01:06] he will actually help us along the way
[2:01:09] and that's what this leadership is we're
[2:01:10] talking about many times we get into
[2:01:12] such a complicated problem such a
[2:01:15] complex position that we can't just turn
[2:01:18] and go the other way
[2:01:20] maybe maybe those people who don't have
[2:01:22] a business would say well sure you can
[2:01:23] you could totally do that if we did that
[2:01:25] in our business then we would leave
[2:01:26] customers with houses torn apart and
[2:01:28] Renovations not finished we would have
[2:01:31] um people that were actually working for
[2:01:32] us not getting paid many times companies
[2:01:35] would just go bankrupt and you could do
[2:01:36] that but would we do that as believers
[2:01:39] we had to try and find a way to do it
[2:01:40] with Integrity to make sure that our
[2:01:42] customers were looked after to make sure
[2:01:44] here I am talking about all this
[2:01:45] business stuff forgive me but what my
[2:01:48] point is that sometimes we can have
[2:01:49] ourselves in into painted into such a
[2:01:51] corner that we can't just take one step
[2:01:53] and get out of it it's a 50-step
[2:01:55] procedure to get out of it but God will
[2:01:58] take us and he will lead us if we're
[2:01:59] willing to follow him
[2:02:02] but this Rich Young Ruler he couldn't do
[2:02:04] it
[2:02:06] he couldn't follow him
[2:02:08] he says it wasn't according to his
[2:02:10] ritual
[2:02:12] what was his ritual isn't that weird
[2:02:14] it wasn't according to his ritual he
[2:02:17] just talked about his his hoarding of
[2:02:19] the money and maybe that's what the
[2:02:20] ritual was the hoarding of the money he
[2:02:22] just couldn't stop hoarding money he
[2:02:23] just couldn't stop dealing with his
[2:02:24] business maybe that's what it was
[2:02:28] he says the other leaders that he had in
[2:02:30] his youthful days
[2:02:31] had such an influence on him till he
[2:02:34] refused to accept God's provided way
[2:02:38] that's where I think it's powerful to
[2:02:41] hear what this brother Victor said in
[2:02:42] Edmonton about his culture
[2:02:45] brothers and sisters it doesn't matter
[2:02:46] there ain't no culture in the Holy Ghost
[2:02:49] we've got to be willing to say I don't
[2:02:51] care what anybody has taught me in the
[2:02:52] past what I know right now today does it
[2:02:54] line up with the word because if it
[2:02:56] doesn't
[2:02:57] it might not be according to the word
[2:02:59] for our day
[2:03:01] the other leaders that he had in his
[2:03:02] youthful days had such an influence on
[2:03:04] him till he refused to accept God's
[2:03:05] provided way which was Jesus Christ
[2:03:09] the only one who holds eternal life the
[2:03:12] only one that can give you
[2:03:14] not the church can't give you eternal
[2:03:17] life
[2:03:17] not your neighbor
[2:03:19] not your pastor not your priest not your
[2:03:23] Creed only Jesus Christ himself can give
[2:03:28] you eternal life see
[2:03:31] no matter how good you are
[2:03:34] what you quit doing
[2:03:37] what you start doing
[2:03:40] you've got to accept the person
[2:03:43] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:46] and I'm going to say this I'm going to
[2:03:47] insert this here that person of Jesus
[2:03:51] Christ
[2:03:52] is the message of the hour
[2:03:55] the message of the hour that William
[2:03:57] Miriam Branham brought was an invitation
[2:03:59] to the wedding supper in the sky it was
[2:04:03] an invitation to come to the marriage of
[2:04:05] the Lamb it was an invitation to take
[2:04:07] the word of God and actually change your
[2:04:10] name to his name that's the message of
[2:04:14] the hour that's what he's talking about
[2:04:15] here people might say oh you're
[2:04:17] interpreting what the prophet said he's
[2:04:18] saying it very clearly right here no
[2:04:20] matter how good you are what you quit
[2:04:22] doing what you start doing you've got to
[2:04:24] accept the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:26] Christ and what's the person of the Lord
[2:04:28] Jesus Christ the revealed word for our
[2:04:30] day brothers and sisters the opening of
[2:04:32] this word is the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:04:35] word coming of God before we meet with
[2:04:37] him in the clouds but if we reject the
[2:04:40] word coming of God and say oh it's got
[2:04:42] to be some other way it's not according
[2:04:43] to my ritual then we're going to miss it
[2:04:46] we're going to find ourselves standing
[2:04:48] before the white Throne of judgment one
[2:04:50] day hoping that there's something that
[2:04:52] will maybe Merit me an opportunity to
[2:04:54] see this eternal life when right now
[2:04:56] today at my voice the sound of my voice
[2:04:58] because we've all had different times
[2:05:00] but here we are in this present moment
[2:05:02] brothers and sisters this present moment
[2:05:04] God's choosing to speak to us right now
[2:05:06] this way if we want to hear from the
[2:05:08] Lord Jesus Christ right now we have the
[2:05:10] opportunity to accept the person of
[2:05:13] Jesus Christ or reject them
[2:05:17] and one day in eternity we're going to
[2:05:19] look at it and say wow
[2:05:21] I I'm so glad that I did that I'm so
[2:05:23] glad that I heard the word of God in my
[2:05:25] day and you know it's nothing that we
[2:05:26] could ever do we can't just decide one
[2:05:28] day I want to hear the word of God for
[2:05:30] my dad I want to be able to hear the
[2:05:31] message of the hour how many of us ever
[2:05:33] set out to hear the message of the hour
[2:05:36] God just gave it to us he just delivered
[2:05:38] it to us through our parents sometimes
[2:05:40] he he sent someone our way with the word
[2:05:43] just like this Obed Edom he had the Ark
[2:05:46] of the Covenant go past his house that
[2:05:48] one day and what happened is it stopped
[2:05:50] to fellowship with him and changed his
[2:05:52] life forever
[2:05:54] no matter how good you are what you quit
[2:05:56] doing what you start doing you've got to
[2:05:58] accept the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:05:59] Christ and then when you do that he is
[2:06:03] the word and then your life fits right
[2:06:05] in the word and manifests itself to this
[2:06:09] age
[2:06:10] that life you're living
[2:06:13] it's not something that we just say
[2:06:15] brothers and sisters I think this is the
[2:06:16] most beautiful part
[2:06:18] he is the word and then your life fits
[2:06:21] right in the word and it manifests
[2:06:23] itself to this age
[2:06:25] in that you're living in
[2:06:31] this man though this Rich Young Ruler he
[2:06:33] wanted to do something himself he wanted
[2:06:34] to do his own way
[2:06:36] we don't want to do it our own way
[2:06:38] we want to follow the word of God
[2:06:40] and and I want to say this brothers and
[2:06:42] sisters if we have lived our lives up
[2:06:45] until now a certain way
[2:06:47] just try and follow the word of God just
[2:06:51] say I don't know if if I have done it
[2:06:53] right in the past and I I I I don't know
[2:06:55] if it's right or wrong but it doesn't
[2:06:57] matter because what's in the past is in
[2:06:59] the past the only thing I can do is
[2:07:01] what's right now in the moment and going
[2:07:03] forwards
[2:07:06] he says see I wanted to do he wanted to
[2:07:08] do something himself that's the way we
[2:07:10] do we we want to do something ourselves
[2:07:12] the gift of God is a free gift God give
[2:07:14] it to you and you don't do one thing for
[2:07:17] it he ordained it to you and you're
[2:07:19] going to have it see I think that's such
[2:07:21] a beautiful quote you're going to have
[2:07:23] it I know I read it earlier but I just
[2:07:26] think it's worth bearing records saying
[2:07:28] it again you're going to have it
[2:07:29] brothers and sisters Satan wants us to
[2:07:31] believe there's something that we can do
[2:07:32] to not have it the only thing that we
[2:07:35] can do to not have it is just not
[2:07:36] receive it
[2:07:38] but I believe we're all here as
[2:07:40] receivers of this word and you know when
[2:07:42] we receive the word we become doers of
[2:07:44] the word we're not just hearers of the
[2:07:45] word
[2:07:46] we're receiving the word when we're
[2:07:48] receiving it we're taking it into
[2:07:50] ourselves it's becoming a part of us
[2:07:54] we're confronted with it we have the
[2:07:57] opportunity
[2:07:59] to do something with it
[2:08:01] it's only Christ that can give it to us
[2:08:03] brothers and sisters
[2:08:05] says the other leaders that he had in
[2:08:07] his youthful days had such an influence
[2:08:09] on him till he refused to accept God's
[2:08:12] provided way
[2:08:13] God's provided way today is the message
[2:08:16] of the hour it truly is the message that
[2:08:19] was given to us by the prophet of
[2:08:21] Malachi 4.
[2:08:23] though the word that was fulfilled was
[2:08:25] fulfilled
[2:08:27] in Revelations 10 7.
[2:08:29] is is this message of the hour it is the
[2:08:32] pillar of fire it is God's provided way
[2:08:34] and I would say I know brother Branham
[2:08:36] says it too we would all probably agree
[2:08:38] with it that it's God's only provided
[2:08:40] way it's God's only provided place of
[2:08:42] worship it's only those who accept this
[2:08:45] word that will truly go in the rapture
[2:08:48] it's not going to be a cataclysmic event
[2:08:50] we know that it was one
[2:08:53] out of a million that went across
[2:08:55] we know that it was eight Souls that
[2:08:58] were saved
[2:08:59] on the boat
[2:09:01] but it was only one that went before
[2:09:03] judgment
[2:09:05] it was only one that lived a life of
[2:09:07] Enoch that that walked with God and just
[2:09:10] was not and and that truly is the called
[2:09:12] out of the called out that's the church
[2:09:14] called out of the church that brother
[2:09:16] Branham talks about and he talks about
[2:09:18] it I believe in in leadership here it's
[2:09:21] just such a a profound thing to think
[2:09:24] that he is calling us out of a church
[2:09:27] it manifests itself this word manifests
[2:09:32] itself
[2:09:33] and and when we live our lives according
[2:09:35] to this word we can't help but push out
[2:09:38] this word when the word is what we take
[2:09:40] in and that's what I was talking about
[2:09:41] these brothers that are going to start
[2:09:43] ministering they're they're actually
[2:09:45] going to be pushing out what they've
[2:09:47] been taking in and when you Minister you
[2:09:50] have to be able to do that
[2:09:52] to just say you can't do it is you know
[2:09:55] they're gonna they're gonna do it one
[2:09:57] way or another
[2:09:58] we're all going to do it we're all going
[2:10:00] to Manifest this word when we take it in
[2:10:02] when you drink it when you drink in you
[2:10:05] push out brother Bradham talks about the
[2:10:06] trees the trees they have seasons that's
[2:10:08] why there's rings in the stump of a tree
[2:10:11] when you look at it there's a season and
[2:10:12] each ring represents a season of growth
[2:10:15] and we all go through seasons of growth
[2:10:17] sometimes we go through droughts
[2:10:18] brothers and sisters it doesn't mean
[2:10:20] that we're not growing
[2:10:21] sometimes we just have a little bit of a
[2:10:23] hard time other times we have a big part
[2:10:26] of growth and and the ring is really big
[2:10:28] in our lives and and that's the way it
[2:10:30] goes sometimes the season is long
[2:10:31] sometimes the season is short that's the
[2:10:34] life that we live in
[2:10:35] it's not a perfect life
[2:10:37] we know that there's only one thing
[2:10:39] that's perfect in this life and that's
[2:10:40] God that's Christ himself Melchizedek
[2:10:45] but it manifests itself out of
[2:10:47] leadership brother Adam says no matter
[2:10:48] how good you are what you quit doing
[2:10:50] what you start doing you've got to
[2:10:52] accept the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:10:54] Christ and then when you do that he is
[2:10:56] the word
[2:10:57] and your life fits right into the word
[2:10:59] it manifests itself to this age
[2:11:02] that you're living in
[2:11:04] you know going back to what we talked
[2:11:05] about with brother Mervin
[2:11:07] the outer body has the five senses the
[2:11:09] spirit has the inner five senses
[2:11:12] but both of those are there to protect
[2:11:14] the soul
[2:11:15] that's the reason we have them it's the
[2:11:18] only reason we have them maybe I'm
[2:11:19] getting a bit crazy to say that but I
[2:11:21] just believe it it's the only reason we
[2:11:22] have them is to protect that soul to
[2:11:24] keep that Soul safe
[2:11:26] but you know that soul is is there for a
[2:11:30] purpose and it was created well I can't
[2:11:32] believe we're already out of time I
[2:11:34] can't uh just looking at this that soul
[2:11:36] is created for one purpose we know that
[2:11:39] that brother Bradham said that God
[2:11:40] created that little teeny space in the
[2:11:43] heart of only a human being it's not in
[2:11:44] any other animal he created that space
[2:11:46] for himself and that's for that soul and
[2:11:49] that's on the inside of the inside and
[2:11:51] we have the ability to accept that word
[2:11:54] not just on our body not just to quit
[2:11:57] smoking drinking lying gambling and
[2:11:58] doing all the things that we used to do
[2:12:00] not just thinking that we're good
[2:12:02] because we don't think those thoughts
[2:12:04] anymore and we don't actually do those
[2:12:06] other things anymore and a lot of the
[2:12:07] memories we've erased out of our minds
[2:12:09] and everything on our inner senses is
[2:12:11] good it's got to go further than that
[2:12:12] brothers and sisters we got to go
[2:12:14] justification sanctification on through
[2:12:16] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ
[2:12:18] himself living out through Us in the
[2:12:21] control tower of our lives and the only
[2:12:23] place that control tower is is in that
[2:12:25] teeny little spot
[2:12:28] I just can't help but think about it you
[2:12:29] know when we were at the youth meeting
[2:12:30] it was it was pretty neat
[2:12:32] we know the the story we're probably all
[2:12:35] familiar with it but we talked about it
[2:12:37] you know how the life that's in the fire
[2:12:39] it's got to be in our lives and the only
[2:12:41] way that we can actually have that in
[2:12:44] our lives is to be a part of it
[2:12:47] and and during the the Youth Event we
[2:12:49] had a fire going and I was able to do it
[2:12:51] I was able to take a call
[2:12:53] excuse me out of the fire and set it on
[2:12:55] the Hearth outside of the fire and it
[2:12:57] was the same thing that was inside the
[2:12:59] fire when we took it out it was red hot
[2:13:01] and we set it there on the Hearth and
[2:13:04] just in a few minutes not very long it
[2:13:06] was no longer red hot it went to a dull
[2:13:09] color and it went darker and darker and
[2:13:11] darker and very soon it was just black
[2:13:13] just like an ash sitting there on the
[2:13:15] hearth and and you know what that's what
[2:13:18] happens to our lives if we get away from
[2:13:19] that fire
[2:13:21] we can't get outside of that fire in our
[2:13:23] lives and expect to remain hot it's just
[2:13:26] not going to work but we took that same
[2:13:28] call and we put it right back into the
[2:13:30] fire and it turned just as orange as it
[2:13:33] was
[2:13:34] and I couldn't help but think this
[2:13:35] morning you know once in a while
[2:13:37] brothers and sisters maybe this is the
[2:13:38] job of a pastor sometimes our fire can
[2:13:41] be burning but it's just sort of
[2:13:43] smoldering it's you know got a little
[2:13:45] bit of flame it's got lots of heat there
[2:13:46] there's tons of heat in the bottom of it
[2:13:48] but it's just sort of there and just
[2:13:50] sort of smoldering and sometimes all we
[2:13:52] need to do is just take a stick and just
[2:13:54] bump it just bump it I can't help but
[2:13:57] think sometimes maybe as a pastor we
[2:13:59] just need to just bump the body and
[2:14:01] shake off those coals on the outside and
[2:14:03] cause all the wood to draw that much
[2:14:05] closer together and what happens when
[2:14:07] you do that the Flames just instantly
[2:14:09] rise up
[2:14:12] and you know brothers and sisters
[2:14:13] there's other example that I got it's
[2:14:15] just so beautiful but sometimes all of
[2:14:18] the potential is right there in the fire
[2:14:20] but you just need to put one more log on
[2:14:22] and you know when that one log goes on
[2:14:24] and starts to burn when that one log
[2:14:26] starts to burn bright what it does is it
[2:14:28] pulls fire out of all the rest of the
[2:14:30] logs that are there everything just
[2:14:32] turns into one big fire I just can't
[2:14:35] help but think sometimes in the Church
[2:14:37] of the Living God maybe we just need a
[2:14:39] little bit of a shake maybe we just need
[2:14:41] one log brothers and sisters I want to
[2:14:43] say it today you could be that one luck
[2:14:45] don't resist the Holy Ghost when he
[2:14:47] comes around and says I want you to lift
[2:14:49] your hands and worship I want you to
[2:14:51] stand up in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:14:52] Christ and receive the healing for your
[2:14:54] cancer because you know what if you do
[2:14:57] that if you're willing to follow it you
[2:14:59] can see someone else get saved you could
[2:15:01] see somebody else get healed because
[2:15:03] another log went on the fire and it just
[2:15:05] drew the Heat and the Flames out of the
[2:15:07] fire that's already there my goodness
[2:15:09] sometimes we just need a little bit of
[2:15:11] stirring sometimes we just need to
[2:15:13] recognize we've already got the fire
[2:15:15] we've already got the leadership of the
[2:15:17] Holy Ghost we just need to get hot my
[2:15:20] goodness I better call them musicians we
[2:15:22] got a service tonight uh I feel like I'm
[2:15:24] just getting started man this is good
[2:15:28] thus saith the Lord
[2:15:30] let my people go
[2:15:32] isn't that the the scripture that was a
[2:15:35] Sunday school memory verse thus saith
[2:15:37] the Lord let my people go and you know
[2:15:40] we have that opportunity in our lives
[2:15:42] today to recognize it as Moses called a
[2:15:44] nation out of a Nation Christ today is
[2:15:47] calling a church out of a church he said
[2:15:50] you see the same thing in type taking
[2:15:53] them to the Glorious Eternal promised
[2:15:56] land this isn't just brother Barry
[2:15:59] speaking all this this is the prophet of
[2:16:01] God saying it he says now to refuse that
[2:16:03] person that's doing the calling Christ
[2:16:05] no matter if your Pentecostal Methodist
[2:16:08] Luther whatever you are you've got you
[2:16:11] got to this age nothing against them not
[2:16:14] at all but this age now you've got to
[2:16:16] accept like they did in that age the
[2:16:19] person of Christ which is the word maybe
[2:16:22] stand with me this morning we have got
[2:16:24] to be willing to accept the person of
[2:16:26] Christ which is the word today brothers
[2:16:28] and sisters the word for another day
[2:16:29] won't do it for us it's got to be the
[2:16:31] word for today a for 2022 before the
[2:16:35] eternity began back in eternity before
[2:16:37] when he was on the cross he had us on
[2:16:40] his mind he saw us here this morning and
[2:16:42] he knew the thoughts that would be in
[2:16:44] our very heart while we're here let's
