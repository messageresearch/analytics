[16:32] quality but more stability and we are
[16:36] planning to get fiber on this site and
[16:39] that will allow those who have better

[19:35] as we are saying humbly in Jesus name
[19:38] amen
[19:40] glory to bless you thank you musicians
[19:55] let's take our Bibles
[20:00] I have few places I'll be reading from
[20:08] [Music]
[20:13] let's turn to
[20:22] a class
[20:23] ecclesiastics
[20:26] chapter 3
[20:28] very very familiar scripture
[20:34] I will just read one verse
[20:44] verse 1.
[20:48] to everything
[20:50] there is a season
[20:52] and a Time
[20:54] to every purpose under the heaven
[20:59] please don't you with me to John chapter
[21:03] 18.
[21:19] verse 36 37.
[21:26] and pilot therefore said unto him
[21:28] a king
[21:33] then
[21:35] and Jesus answered
[21:38] thou says that I am a king
[21:41] to this end was I born
[21:44] and to this course came I into the world
[21:48] that should bear a witness
[21:51] unto the truth
[21:53] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[21:57] voice
[21:59] and pilate said unto him
[22:03] what is truth
[22:06] hey when he has said
[22:09] this
[22:10] he went out again
[22:13] unto the Jews and said unto them
[22:17] I find in him no fault at all
[22:23] but have accustomed
[22:26] that you release
[22:28] unto you
[22:29] one at at the Passover
[22:33] will ye therefore that I release unto
[22:36] you
[22:38] the king of the Jews
[22:41] then cry day or again saying not this
[22:45] man
[22:46] but Barabbas
[22:51] and I'll just stop there
[22:57] I have few scriptures but we'll read
[22:59] through as we go
[23:02] God richly bless you you may have your
[23:04] seat
[23:14] I want also to thank each one of you
[23:18] for the election for the confidence you
[23:21] have in us to serve as deacons we are
[23:24] here to serve you
[23:28] the leadership of the church is not to
[23:30] be Lord over
[23:32] the Lord's body but to serve the Lord's
[23:35] body
[23:36] so thank you for that confidence and by
[23:38] God's grace we'll do all we can to serve
[23:41] you
[23:42] in everything that we do
[23:46] and we know that we serve the Lord by
[23:49] serving his body
[23:51] amen
[24:02] I'll go a little slow this morning and
[24:05] bear with me I just have a thought
[24:07] that I believe
[24:10] the Lord wanted me to go this direction
[24:13] as a man I struggle with it and there
[24:15] are many topics I can speak about
[24:18] but I believe that's why he wanted us to
[24:20] cover today
[24:22] we'll be talking about purpose
[24:28] maybe not something that Branham covers
[24:31] specifically as one message
[24:35] but as
[24:38] when the law starts to deal with you in
[24:41] an area
[24:42] it's essential to see what the prophet
[24:44] has said about it for the Bible has said
[24:46] about it
[24:48] and as I start to look
[24:50] he actually touched on it all over the
[24:53] place
[24:57] that scripture we read
[24:59] talk about
[25:02] to
[25:03] I I just want to read it exactly the way
[25:07] ecclesiastic
[25:10] the Bible said it
[25:14] to everything there is a season
[25:18] and at time
[25:20] in every purpose under heaven
[25:24] so there is a time that is associated
[25:26] with the purpose it's not just a purpose
[25:29] that is Broad a purpose needs to be
[25:32] attached to a season or a specific time
[25:41] you see the prophet of God I've been
[25:44] going through a series
[25:46] and I think baloney or some of the
[25:48] ministers taught us some time back that
[25:51] is essential as you listen to the word
[25:54] of God or the prophet that you go
[25:56] through in a series so I started
[25:59] listening to
[26:00] messages like uh the spoken word is the
[26:04] Original Seed
[26:06] and after that you have expressions
[26:10] and after that you have the sign
[26:12] of the end time seed and so on and so on
[26:16] so he said God will give a thought to
[26:20] the prophet and he will go over the same
[26:22] thought over and over through multiple
[26:25] services so to capture the whole thought
[26:28] you need to follow how he expanded on it
[26:35] so as I got to the message expressions
[26:39] I took a service in Lethbridge
[26:42] based on
[26:44] the original series The spoken word is
[26:46] the Original Seed but right after that
[26:50] he preached expression
[26:52] which is actually a message that he
[26:55] preached after or
[26:57] together with a funeral of her sister
[27:03] amen and within that message he's
[27:06] talking about
[27:09] the purpose is crucial
[27:12] because our sister served her purpose
[27:17] know what she did not all the activities
[27:20] but the activities needs to be linked to
[27:24] a purpose
[27:27] amen Christian life is not our
[27:30] activities it's not about what we get or
[27:34] don't get it's about purpose
[27:37] so it's crucial for us to know what's
[27:40] our purpose
[27:54] I'll just read the definition according
[27:56] to Webster's
[27:57] 1828
[27:59] purpose
[28:01] that which a man set before him as an
[28:05] object to be rich
[28:07] or accomplish
[28:09] an end
[28:11] or aim to which the view is directed in
[28:15] any plan
[28:17] measure or exertion
[28:21] we believe that the Supreme Being 18 20
[28:25] 28 the Supreme Being created intelligent
[28:29] beings
[28:32] benevolence and glorious purpose
[28:37] and if so how glorious
[28:40] and benevolent
[28:42] must be his purpose in the Plan of
[28:45] Redemption
[28:47] so God did not do anything haphazardly
[28:50] everything that he did he did it for our
[28:53] purpose
[28:55] and the prophet of God told us that we
[28:57] are here for a purpose you are here in
[29:00] this congregation this morning for a
[29:02] purpose matter of fact there are other
[29:04] people that wanted to be in this service
[29:06] physically but you are ordained to be
[29:09] here for a purpose
[29:11] so don't just sit in to see what
[29:15] happened no you are here for a purpose
[29:18] this is not about the minister this is
[29:20] not about the sun leader or the
[29:22] musicians you are here for a purpose
[29:25] those who are at home they are listening
[29:29] there is a purpose that you are
[29:31] listening to the message there is a
[29:33] purpose what God call you
[29:38] so that needs to be settled within our
[29:40] heart what's our purpose
[29:43] why did God
[29:45] out of the billions chose us
[29:51] but you see when purpose is not known
[29:54] misuse or abused is inevitable
[30:00] if you have little kids
[30:03] they are Masters to use the wrong thing
[30:07] to do whatever they want to do
[30:11] because for them they don't understand
[30:13] the purpose of things
[30:21] can wash clothes
[30:25] in a toilet
[30:28] because she does not know that's not the
[30:31] purpose for it
[30:40] but you know what's sad
[30:42] many adults do the same thing
[30:48] churches
[30:51] the purpose of church is not to sleep
[30:53] I'm not saying so somebody is sleeping
[30:57] but we do it
[30:59] right
[31:00] because we don't understand what is
[31:03] happening when we are in divine presence
[31:06] when angels in Camp around those who
[31:09] fear Him in the congregation of the Lord
[31:13] what is possible
[31:19] I think recently
[31:22] Texas just went through
[31:24] a nice storm
[31:27] and some people actually
[31:29] lost their life because of the wrong use
[31:32] of barbecue trying to use barbecue to
[31:35] hit their homes
[31:40] barbecue generates heat but it's for the
[31:44] wrong pep
[38:48] you are the pastor for those children
[38:52] the way you conduct yourself
[38:55] is a reflection
[39:06] so we have to be strong strong on our
[39:09] knees
[39:10] strong in caring
[39:14] strong in following the Lord
[39:22] you see when Church forget what church
[39:25] is about
[39:26] memories start
[39:29] church is a hospital
[39:32] for The Sinner
[39:34] is a place where Grace can be ministered
[39:38] it's a place where people can be built
[39:40] up not brought down
[39:44] but purpose is what determine our action
[39:49] it's not our action that determine the
[39:51] the purpose purpose determine the action
[40:09] problem in the Sixth Seal he said look
[40:12] there they crucify him the Bible said
[40:18] that's a fall of the greatest words
[40:22] look there Jerusalem
[40:25] the most holy city in the world
[40:28] they the most holy people in the world
[40:31] crucify
[40:34] the most brutal death
[40:37] in the world him
[40:39] the most important person in the world
[40:42] why
[40:44] because they missed their their purpose
[40:47] while he was there
[40:50] they thought he was just there to give
[40:52] them food and here they are sick
[40:57] though he did all of that
[41:00] but his purpose was different
[41:04] his purpose was John 18 when he stood
[41:08] before pilot
[41:09] to to be a witness of Truth
[41:18] but because they missed the purpose
[41:21] they mistreat him
[41:23] and they crucify him
[41:27] but I'm not talking about two thousand
[41:29] years ago all right
[41:32] that's why the prophet of God will say
[41:35] what will you do with
[41:37] this this Christ
[41:40] not Christ two thousand years ago but
[41:43] this Christ
[41:45] because Christ is the word what are we
[41:48] going to do with the word this morning
[41:51] what are we doing with the word this
[41:53] morning
[42:04] one of the first thing the society has
[42:06] done is to remove the purpose of mankind
[42:10] they diluted it they say we come from
[42:13] animals
[42:14] you see animals they don't have the same
[42:18] problem we do
[42:21] they don't have high blood pressure they
[42:23] don't worry about anything
[42:26] because they still follow nature
[42:29] there is something different about
[42:31] Mankind a mankind
[42:34] because we are created in the image of
[42:36] God for a purpose
[42:39] once we miss the purpose everything else
[42:43] become shambled
[42:50] or political systems
[42:53] they forget the purpose why they are
[42:56] created
[42:58] the government the federal government
[43:00] especially their primary responsibility
[43:03] is to protect the citizens
[43:09] but when the power that is given to them
[43:12] is used now
[43:15] to persecute the same citizens
[43:18] because of their belief
[43:21] because of different things it's because
[43:24] they forget the very purpose they are
[43:26] there for
[43:27] when the church forget the purpose the
[43:30] church is raised up for to be a
[43:33] reflection of Jesus Christ to to bring
[43:36] people out of sin out of bondage
[43:39] then we turn our guns inward
[43:47] we saw that in Saul
[43:51] we don't have time to to read it
[43:54] but in first Samuel chapter 21
[43:58] Saul was King when God anointed
[44:02] David
[44:05] King over Israel
[44:08] instead of Saul using the Army to
[44:12] protect Israel
[44:14] he start to use the same Army to chase
[44:17] after David
[44:26] if we have the spirit of Saul we can
[44:28] pray for deliverance
[44:31] because the spirit of God in David
[44:34] understood that everything that belongs
[44:37] to God needs to be used to embedded the
[44:40] people of God
[44:45] so David never wasted his time
[44:49] to use his energy against Saul
[44:52] but he knew that the rear enemy that
[44:55] Israel has
[44:57] is the Philistine it's the Malachi and
[45:00] so on
[45:01] the Church of the Living God Christians
[45:04] our energy our everything that we are
[45:08] should be used against sin
[45:10] Hallelujah
[45:15] amen because we know
[45:18] whose program we are part of
[45:26] can miss the Revelation the purpose of
[45:31] the sacrifice
[45:33] the sacrifice was not just something
[45:36] nice for them to do
[45:38] the sacrifice was something it speak
[45:42] about an atonement that God wanted them
[45:45] to know do you understand this atonement
[45:49] But Ken did not have the revelation
[45:52] of that moment so he brought fruit
[45:55] because the purpose of the sacrifice was
[45:59] not known
[46:00] but able cut a revelation
[46:04] he caught a revelation that whenever
[46:06] there is sin there has to be a payment
[46:09] for sin
[46:13] because when his parents sin God himself
[46:17] made a sacrifice right away
[46:19] he provided alarm
[46:22] so the children growing up
[46:25] hearing the stories
[46:32] ever believe it
[46:34] that might because it's just like my
[46:37] kids they will ask me things what
[46:39] happened when you were my age
[46:42] I can't remember some of them
[46:44] did you like this did you like that some
[46:46] of the things they were not even made
[46:48] back then but they don't understand so
[46:52] the children able and Ken
[46:55] were asking their parents how was it
[46:59] like to be in the Garden of Eden
[47:02] to wait in the core of the evening for
[47:04] God himself to descend
[47:07] to come and commune and talk to you
[47:11] how was it like to be in the Holy
[47:13] presence
[47:17] and I can hear Adam telling them oh
[47:22] I cannot describe it just like the
[47:25] prophet said Sublime does not touch it
[47:31] Paul said it has not even entered into
[47:34] the heart of man what God has reserved
[47:37] for them that love him
[47:42] so they tell their children about how
[47:46] the garden was like
[47:49] and we have to tell our children about
[47:52] the hope that lay within us
[47:54] that this life is not everything one of
[47:57] these days if the Lord carries this body
[48:00] will be silent forever
[48:03] but there is something within man as job
[48:05] has said when man dies
[48:08] shall he live again
[48:11] so they talk to their children
[48:14] to heaven or the garden is so beautiful
[48:18] oh you love to be there
[48:22] and they say oh papa how long to be
[48:25] there ever will say
[48:27] how can we go back
[48:29] they say here is the key God has made a
[48:32] promise to us he said I will bring you
[48:35] back again there is a way back to God
[48:38] it's a blood is freaking way
[48:42] so able God that revelation
[48:46] so when God ask him for sacrifice he
[48:50] knew the only way back is Through Blood
[48:59] the blood
[49:03] Enoch
[49:04] knew
[49:06] that there is a way back
[49:09] so he consecrated his life
[49:12] the word of God said
[49:17] he had his this testimony
[49:28] amen
[49:30] what was the testimony of Enoch that he
[49:33] pleased the Lord
[49:36] he placed God in everything that he did
[49:39] not partially not haphazardly he please
[49:42] God
[49:58] I just want to jump to Joseph quickly
[50:02] in Genesis uh 45
[50:05] verse 7 and God said
[50:09] Joseph replied to his Brethren he said
[50:13] God sent me before you to preserve you a
[50:17] posterity in the earth and to save your
[50:21] life
[50:22] by great Deliverance
[50:25] we'll cover this later
[50:28] this is what
[50:30] Joseph understood the purpose of God
[50:33] sending him was
[50:36] which is truth
[50:38] but when Paul picked the same
[50:41] account up in Hebrew
[50:45] he moved higher
[50:48] Hebrew 11.
[50:50] by faith Joseph
[50:53] when he died
[50:55] made mention of
[50:57] the departing of the children of Israel
[51:01] and give commandment concerning his born
[51:05] he knew that there is a purpose greater
[51:08] than all the achievement that Joseph
[51:11] achieved
[51:12] if one of us were to be a prime minister
[51:15] of the most powerful Nation on Earth
[51:19] by none it's not even like you are
[51:21] saying China today
[51:25] Egypt at that point in time was the most
[51:28] powerful Nation on Earth
[51:31] but air all that achievement
[51:35] was nothing compared to the purpose why
[51:39] he was doing it
[51:42] it's not what he achieved it's the
[51:44] purpose why he achieved what he achieved
[51:55] I'll say time will fail us to go about
[51:58] rehab Gideon Samson
[52:05] I'll just stopped on Samsung very quick
[52:08] Samsung was strong
[52:10] because of the presence of God
[52:13] because God's blessing upon his life
[52:16] made him peculiar
[52:19] and many
[52:21] children of God they are peculiar
[52:23] because of God's blessing upon your life
[52:26] but God's blessing upon your life has a
[52:29] purpose
[52:31] he has a vision why he gave you what he
[52:35] gave you he has a purpose why he gave
[52:38] you the abilities he gave you
[52:42] is to use it for his glory
[52:45] if you're a musician is to use it to
[52:48] bless the people of God
[52:54] there are many people that are gifted
[52:56] they just don't use it for the Lord
[53:01] the prophet of God said every Presley
[53:04] was gifted
[53:06] his gift came from God but he used it
[53:10] wrongly
[53:11] he used it to to promote
[53:14] sin
[53:17] and Samson was gifted
[53:22] but he forgot the purpose of his gift
[53:26] his his mother was given a promise that
[53:30] through Samson there will be a deliverer
[53:33] for Israel
[53:36] it's not for him to have all the women
[53:38] that he can
[53:40] but the gift is for him to use them for
[53:43] the Deliverance of Israel
[53:46] Drive
[53:47] but you see when the purpose is unknown
[53:50] it's not known
[53:53] the gift is abuse
[54:04] Paul was A Gifted Man
[54:08] the apostles Paul
[54:12] Was A Gifted Man
[54:14] but he misused what God can do through
[54:18] him
[54:19] until God got hold of his life
[54:26] so we can see that it is important
[54:29] to know the purpose why we are here
[54:42] in that message the faith of Abraham
[54:47] he said God
[54:49] is like a great contractor
[54:54] I'll just read it
[54:58] what I am made out of petroleum Portage
[55:02] calcium my body was laying on Earth
[55:06] before
[55:07] there was anything
[55:10] at all ever on earth
[55:13] when the Holy Spirit went forth before
[55:16] God
[55:17] to brood up upon the Earth
[55:21] abroad mean a coup
[55:26] like a dog Cooling a hand mother
[55:31] when there was nothing but volcanic
[55:34] eruption when God moved the old star
[55:38] around
[55:39] the Sun
[55:41] making potash calcium
[55:43] he was like a great contract or laying
[55:46] out the lumber to build a house
[55:54] you see a great contractor has something
[55:57] in his mind or her mind that he's trying
[56:00] to achieve
[56:02] before they start building a bridge
[56:06] you see a movement around that area and
[56:09] often you may not even know what what
[56:12] are they doing
[56:13] they are removing dirt they are bringing
[56:16] in dirt they are laying bricks and
[56:19] different things
[56:21] they are laying everything that they
[56:23] need for the mission that they have
[56:26] and the prophet is saying God is like a
[56:29] contractor
[56:30] that before anything was built on Earth
[56:34] he lay your body and my body on Earth
[56:37] back then
[56:41] Hallelujah
[56:42] I can run
[56:45] because a contractor
[56:48] everything he bring on site
[56:51] is meticulously calculated
[56:55] he does not want to have a surplus of
[56:58] sun that will be on the way of gravel or
[57:01] cement or river everything needs to be
[57:05] laid at the proper proportion because of
[57:08] the work that he needs to accomplish
[57:10] therefore there is nothing of waste in
[57:13] the plan of a great contractor
[57:16] so when God bless you on Earth he did
[57:20] not make a mistake
[57:23] we are not an accident of father or
[57:25] mother God in his great
[57:29] for knowledge knew that you'll be here
[57:32] at this time he lay your body that you
[57:36] come into manifestation in Leo this year
[57:40] but you see the break in itself
[57:45] is not a purpose
[57:48] our life by themselves is not just the
[57:52] purpose
[57:54] the break needs to work its way into the
[57:57] master plan
[58:04] and you see a great contractor that's
[58:07] not just
[58:08] a bridge for instance it needs cement
[58:11] you need gravel it needs sand in in it
[58:16] rebirth and different calibers and so on
[58:20] you don't just push all of them together
[58:24] and hope a bridge will come out
[58:28] everything needs to lay in
[58:32] in a certain step
[58:36] the material that is needed and the
[58:38] concentration that is needed for this
[58:40] Foundation is different for the
[58:43] finishing
[58:46] when they are doing a bridge work
[58:49] the light cement that would go to the
[58:52] top to make it look pretty
[58:54] if you put it down for your foundation
[58:57] it will not hold
[59:01] so our life I lay in a certain way so
[59:05] that the material
[59:07] needed at a specific time
[59:11] come with the purpose of that time
[59:16] Wesley was not ordained to live in this
[59:18] day and age
[59:19] but you and I are
[59:22] great man of God
[59:25] but this is not their time
[59:28] they were used in a different
[59:30] dispensation for a different purpose
[59:34] so we cannot go and do what Wesley needs
[59:38] to do because we are not built like
[59:39] Wesley
[59:41] we cannot do what Luther has done
[59:43] because we are not built like Luther
[59:51] but here is the thing
[59:53] we can do what we have built to do in
[59:56] this generation
[59:58] the bride is built in this generation
[1:00:01] not to be Earthbound but you saw into
[1:00:04] the heaviest
[1:00:05] praise God you see truly I yes you
[1:00:12] brothers and sisters you are called into
[1:00:15] the heaviest
[1:00:17] they they're anointing for our
[1:00:20] generation is a flying eagle
[1:00:23] an eagle does not take pleasure to be on
[1:00:26] earth
[1:00:28] Earth is too cumbersome for an ego
[1:00:33] he comes he eats quickly
[1:00:37] he doesn't even sit on Earth to eat
[1:00:40] and you go he quickly come grabs his
[1:00:44] prey and away he goes
[1:00:46] why he's a Heavenly bird
[1:00:51] he's called to sorrow
[1:00:54] in the heavens
[1:00:58] but you see if you take an ego and you
[1:01:01] catch him down long enough he will start
[1:01:05] to walk
[1:01:06] right
[1:01:07] matter of fact you know a modern society
[1:01:11] in our food chain one of the problem
[1:01:14] we are eating too many unhealthy food
[1:01:18] chickens that cannot fly
[1:01:22] because they are caged in
[1:01:29] ask yourself are you Cajun
[1:01:31] do you have a Doctrine or background
[1:01:33] that is caging you in that you cannot
[1:01:36] fly into the things of God you cannot
[1:01:39] accept the word as he come fresh
[1:01:54] the prophet of God said
[1:01:59] God is still using his material
[1:02:02] you raise it up again in the last day
[1:02:05] God cannot
[1:02:07] God cannot be defeated
[1:02:09] his purpose is perfect
[1:02:14] just as certain as you are born again
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] so we don't have anything to worry about
[1:02:24] God is moving exactly according to his
[1:02:27] own plan and purpose
[1:02:32] but how does God work
[1:02:35] God purpose
[1:02:37] he give it to his Prophet that's why
[1:02:41] Amos 3 7 can say God does not do
[1:02:44] anything except he revealed to his
[1:02:47] servant the prophet
[1:02:50] and you can understand that's why the
[1:02:52] whole generation
[1:02:55] we have great we have great buildings
[1:02:59] in the in the church world
[1:03:03] great Ministries
[1:03:05] I think at the latest I was hearing is
[1:03:08] some of this congregation are like 80
[1:03:11] 000 people
[1:03:13] great Manet beautiful
[1:03:18] the prophet said it's like a hybrid corn
[1:03:22] is pretty it looks good but there is no
[1:03:25] life in it
[1:03:28] and I'm not just talking about them we
[1:03:31] can have a nice service everything just
[1:03:34] working right but there is no life in it
[1:03:37] life is the difference
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:44] how do you know there is life in it when
[1:03:46] it flows according to God's plan
[1:03:52] God will take his mind and unveil it to
[1:03:55] the prophet
[1:03:56] and a prophet who speak it to the
[1:03:58] generation
[1:03:59] and it is a responsibility of a pastor
[1:04:03] to take the same word and break it down
[1:04:05] to the congregation and the fathers need
[1:04:08] to take the same word and apply it at
[1:04:11] home and the mothers need to teach their
[1:04:14] children how to live that word
[1:04:17] that's the circle
[1:04:27] so the question is how how do we know
[1:04:31] our own purpose
[1:04:33] how do we know why we are here for
[1:04:36] you see the way you capture that is to
[1:04:39] understand what God is doing
[1:04:42] our purpose is not perfect but he's
[1:04:45] perfect purpose is perfect
[1:04:48] so what we need to do is to work our way
[1:04:51] into the purpose of God
[1:04:54] we cannot do it on our own it's what
[1:04:57] he's doing we just need to be surrender
[1:05:00] to it Joseph did not bring himself to
[1:05:02] Egypt God allowed Joseph to go to Egypt
[1:05:15] you can turn to it listen to Ephesians
[1:05:31] Ephesians chapter 1 and we just read
[1:05:34] from verse 9.
[1:05:39] have you been known unto us
[1:05:43] the mystery of his will
[1:05:49] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:05:51] has purposed in himself
[1:05:54] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:05:57] of times he might gather together in one
[1:06:00] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:06:03] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:06:08] him
[1:06:09] so there is one purpose that God has
[1:06:11] declared that in the dispensation of the
[1:06:14] fullness of time you gather everything
[1:06:17] in what in Christ
[1:06:20] not in a Calgary Living Word Assembly
[1:06:23] not in any other denomination but in
[1:06:26] Christ
[1:06:27] that's the purpose that God has to
[1:06:30] gather together all things in Christ
[1:06:34] a Christ is what Christ is the word when
[1:06:38] you are gathered in the world you have
[1:06:40] been Gathering and fulfilling the
[1:06:42] purpose of God
[1:06:45] but when you move away from the word
[1:06:47] guess what you are moving away from the
[1:06:50] very purpose of God you are moving away
[1:06:53] from what God can do
[1:07:00] the same age what God wants to bring
[1:07:04] fullness in the same age Satan is coming
[1:07:07] to full fruition also
[1:07:11] is the age of the esses
[1:07:15] Daniel said
[1:07:18] Daniel chapter 11 32.
[1:07:23] and such
[1:07:25] as such as do weekly against the
[1:07:28] Covenant shall he corrupt by flattery
[1:07:31] but the people that do know their God
[1:07:35] shall be strong and do exploit
[1:07:38] same age
[1:07:40] went flattery we gather together people
[1:07:45] don't know what they are living for they
[1:07:48] are just living for pleasure they are
[1:07:50] just living for entertainment
[1:07:52] but what's their entertainment for
[1:07:56] what's the purpose behind
[1:08:01] Bradham said
[1:08:02] one of the the most deceiving age we are
[1:08:06] living the seven age is the age that we
[1:08:09] are living in
[1:08:10] that people who think they are serving
[1:08:12] God
[1:08:14] but they are serving Satan not knowing
[1:08:17] it
[1:08:18] because he's using flattery
[1:08:21] he sits as God in the temple of God
[1:08:25] and receive worship as God
[1:08:33] but you see when we don't know
[1:08:36] what's the purpose of rock and roll
[1:08:38] Christian rock and roll
[1:08:40] we can fall for that
[1:08:44] because they have a purpose
[1:08:47] they have a purpose their purpose is to
[1:08:50] entertain your flesh
[1:08:52] but they will do away with your soul
[1:08:54] between the two which one is more
[1:08:57] important
[1:08:58] maybe we don't entertain you enough at
[1:09:01] church but we are concerned about your
[1:09:03] soul because there is something within
[1:09:05] the heart of human being that is worth
[1:09:08] more than anything that we have
[1:09:10] physically
[1:09:12] the prophet said
[1:09:14] our soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[1:09:17] think about it
[1:09:20] he said man that drink a soup
[1:09:23] with a spider
[1:09:25] in it
[1:09:27] they are going to sue that that
[1:09:30] restaurant
[1:09:32] because they just drank something that
[1:09:34] is going to make their body sick all so
[1:09:37] bad
[1:09:39] but we take in all the time
[1:09:42] Facebook Twitter
[1:09:45] YouTube all kind of garbage and we just
[1:09:48] absorb it
[1:09:50] and we don't wonder what's the purpose
[1:09:53] of this what's behind us when somebody
[1:09:56] is telling you gossip ask yourself
[1:09:58] what's behind this gossip
[1:10:01] is it going to strengthen you is it
[1:10:03] going to encourage you with in the in
[1:10:05] your work with God or it's going to pull
[1:10:07] you down
[1:10:10] what's the purpose
[1:10:18] there is a purpose why he came in
[1:10:21] Revelation 10 7.
[1:10:24] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:10:27] seven Angel when he shall begin to sound
[1:10:29] the mystery of God shall be finished
[1:10:34] as he has declared to his servants the
[1:10:37] prophet
[1:10:38] there is a purpose when we are why there
[1:10:42] is a manifestation of the son of man
[1:10:44] Ministry
[1:10:46] it's not for entertainment
[1:10:50] rebuke that generation
[1:10:53] they just come oh brother who come on
[1:10:57] on their pulpit and they'll bring
[1:11:00] somebody
[1:11:01] and through the word Discerning the
[1:11:03] thought and their intent brother will
[1:11:05] say oh you are from here oh you were at
[1:11:08] a hospital or I can see this happen oh
[1:11:12] but that says the Lord you are healed oh
[1:11:17] we like to see that when we are not too
[1:11:19] tired
[1:11:20] but he said no that's not a purpose
[1:11:23] this is the sign of the son of man
[1:11:28] this is the sign of
[1:11:30] Luke 17 30. that
[1:11:34] before the end of the time God has
[1:11:37] promised that he will return and reveal
[1:11:40] this the sign of the son of man
[1:11:44] this is the same sign that God did to
[1:11:47] Abraham before the change of his body
[1:11:53] so it's not just the entertainment it's
[1:11:56] not just what the prophet said or did
[1:12:00] is why he did it
[1:12:06] that's why he encouraged us to have
[1:12:08] spiritual food in due season
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:13] for us you have the result of the end
[1:12:16] time message you meet the entire
[1:12:18] condition
[1:12:19] amen only the end time message will meet
[1:12:23] that condition
[1:12:41] so it's good for us to know
[1:12:43] what God is doing right now
[1:12:50] or just read
[1:12:52] one more scripture before I change gear
[1:12:56] in Matthew 13 37 he answered and said
[1:12:59] unto them
[1:13:02] The Good Seed this is the parable of
[1:13:05] this
[1:13:07] this uh the width and the tears
[1:13:11] I know there is the parable of the soul
[1:13:13] but this one is different the width and
[1:13:16] the tears I'll just summarize it the
[1:13:19] Bible said there is a man that one
[1:13:21] fought to sow
[1:13:22] and when he saw the seed
[1:13:25] there came another man behind him
[1:13:28] dressing black that Soul tears into the
[1:13:32] same field
[1:13:34] and after a while both started to spring
[1:13:38] or to shrunk up
[1:13:42] and the servant of of the man
[1:13:45] said unto him
[1:13:46] will that die we removed the tears he
[1:13:50] said no
[1:13:52] leave them alone
[1:13:54] because there is a time of the Harvest
[1:13:59] then the disciple came to Jesus Christ
[1:14:02] and asked him
[1:14:04] give us
[1:14:07] or explain to us the parable
[1:14:09] and he said unto them
[1:14:12] he that's all the good seed is the son
[1:14:15] of man
[1:14:16] the field is the world
[1:14:19] the good seed are the children of the
[1:14:21] Kingdom
[1:14:22] but the tears are the children of of the
[1:14:25] wicked one
[1:14:27] the enemy that saw them
[1:14:29] is the devil
[1:14:31] the Harvest
[1:14:33] is the end of the world
[1:14:35] the rivers at the angels
[1:14:38] as therefore the tales are gathered
[1:14:40] together to be burned in in the fire
[1:14:44] social EB at the end
[1:14:46] of this world
[1:14:49] the son of Manchester sent forth his
[1:14:51] angels and they shall guide us out
[1:14:55] of his kingdom all things that offend
[1:14:59] them that do iniquity
[1:15:05] so he has a purpose
[1:15:07] that he lay out from the beginning until
[1:15:11] the end
[1:15:13] so we are now without purpose we are not
[1:15:16] here just truth in our our Thompson what
[1:15:20] are we going to do no God has a vision
[1:15:22] and a purpose of things that he wants to
[1:15:25] accomplish in this day what we need to
[1:15:27] do is to find out what does he have to
[1:15:30] does he want to accomplish and what's
[1:15:33] our goal in what he wants to accomplish
[1:15:38] it's not good enough to know that we are
[1:15:40] at the end of the ages
[1:15:42] why are we here for brother actually
[1:15:45] said
[1:15:47] is like a man hire someone
[1:15:51] and that man got a little busy if you
[1:15:54] just go near or go and you put your hand
[1:15:58] behind your your back
[1:16:01] and you are just taking it easy
[1:16:04] he said no that's not the thing to do
[1:16:06] you need to go to him and say Hey you
[1:16:09] hire me
[1:16:10] why did you hire me
[1:16:14] we are Christian Soldiers we need to
[1:16:17] know why are we enlist in the army of
[1:16:21] the Living God
[1:16:22] what's our position in the Army I'm not
[1:16:26] talking about rules and titles what is
[1:16:30] God calling you for
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:36] you see you may be just like that little
[1:16:38] girl that Israel a Jew girl
[1:16:44] living
[1:16:46] in the house with Neymar
[1:16:52] the prophet was not there to witness
[1:16:55] to this great man
[1:16:58] the King was not there but that little
[1:17:01] girl was there and she realized it is
[1:17:05] her responsibility to tell her master
[1:17:08] there is a bomb in Gilead
[1:17:12] yes we know that in Samaria you cannot
[1:17:15] heal leper but when you go to Israel
[1:17:18] there is a prophet and the god of that
[1:17:21] Prophet can heal this disease
[1:17:24] how many of you can tell your neighbors
[1:17:28] I know a God that delivers
[1:17:32] I know a God that healeth
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:38] nobody else can do that but this little
[1:17:40] girl
[1:17:44] she
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:18] foreign
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:19:09] thank you
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:29] foreign
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:20:12] thank you
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:48] thank you
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:21] foreign
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:39] car to witness
[1:21:45] even when the king heard about it
[1:21:49] as a Samaria sent forth to the king of
[1:21:52] Israel and say hey here is my Captain
[1:21:58] may you make him hold the king rented
[1:22:02] his his dress and said this king is
[1:22:06] seeking an occasion against me and
[1:22:09] sometimes that's what happened
[1:22:11] a brother a sister says something we
[1:22:13] misunderstand them
[1:22:16] and we started to make all kind of
[1:22:18] conclusions it's because of the and no
[1:22:22] the king said oh I just heard
[1:22:24] that there is a God in your land that
[1:22:27] can heal
[1:22:29] the King was not aware of it
[1:22:32] so Elijah needed to go and say there is
[1:22:36] a God in Israel
[1:22:43] I just want to turn to the life of Jesus
[1:22:46] Christ because he's the perfect example
[1:22:49] that is left us
[1:22:52] how did he knew his purpose
[1:22:56] if we follow him we know our purpose
[1:23:00] also
[1:23:09] Jesus himself he said
[1:23:12] if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto
[1:23:16] me
[1:23:19] and brother went on to say that's our
[1:23:22] purpose in life
[1:23:25] is to lift lift up before a dying
[1:23:29] generation
[1:23:31] of people
[1:23:33] you see many people got it we have a
[1:23:36] dying generation
[1:23:38] we have a generation that is perverted
[1:23:41] that that has lost their ways
[1:23:46] but we have a responsibility to lift up
[1:23:50] Christ before them
[1:23:52] to live a life of Christ before them
[1:23:57] that Jesus Christ is still the son of
[1:24:00] God
[1:24:01] the savior of the world
[1:24:04] I'm so happy to know that I live where
[1:24:07] there is people who believe that along
[1:24:11] with the thousands that have accepted
[1:24:14] him as their savior
[1:24:24] in John 5 19.
[1:24:26] then answer Jesus and said unto them
[1:24:30] very verily I said unto you the son can
[1:24:33] do nothing of himself
[1:24:36] but what he said the father do
[1:24:41] for what things
[1:24:43] so ever he do it this also the son do
[1:24:48] likewise
[1:24:50] so Christ is telling us the way he lives
[1:24:54] such a successful life is that his
[1:24:57] purpose is tied to God's purpose
[1:25:00] whatever God wants to do Christ is the
[1:25:04] venue through which
[1:25:06] he did it
[1:25:08] and Christ knew that he has no agenda of
[1:25:12] his own
[1:25:14] he just surrender who he is to God
[1:25:17] so that what God wants to do Christ did
[1:25:20] it
[1:25:23] what God wants to do in this generation
[1:25:25] the bride is called to do it
[1:25:30] that's why the prophet can say she has
[1:25:33] the mind of God
[1:25:39] and we can go through many the Apostle
[1:25:43] Paul Live the same way
[1:25:46] in Galatians 2 20 he said I am crucified
[1:25:49] with Christ nevertheless I live nor yet
[1:25:54] not I but Christ liveth in me and the
[1:25:57] life which I now live in the flesh I
[1:26:00] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[1:26:03] loved me and gave himself for me
[1:26:10] amen we know that we live in the in that
[1:26:14] day
[1:26:15] to whom God May known
[1:26:18] what is the richest of his glory
[1:26:21] of the mystery among the Gentiles which
[1:26:24] is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:26:27] that's where we are Christ in us doing
[1:26:30] his own things for his own purpose
[1:26:42] we can turn quickly
[1:26:50] to John
[1:27:00] John 18.
[1:27:18] foreign
[1:27:21] scripture and Palace therefore said unto
[1:27:24] him a king and Jesus answered thus said
[1:27:28] that I am a king
[1:27:30] to this end was I born
[1:27:35] and for this cause
[1:27:36] my
[1:27:38] into the world
[1:27:40] that I should bear witness unto the
[1:27:43] truth
[1:27:44] and everyone that is of the truth here
[1:27:46] at my voice
[1:27:49] so Christ knew exactly his purpose
[1:27:53] he knew what God placed him here for
[1:28:01] and he moved to do that and that only
[1:28:09] in John
[1:28:12] chapter 20 he
[1:28:15] he said
[1:28:16] then Jesus said unto them again peace be
[1:28:20] unto you as my father sent me
[1:28:23] even so send I you
[1:28:27] so when Christ came to the end I'll just
[1:28:30] summarize quickly
[1:28:32] in John chapter 18 Jesus Christ was
[1:28:35] before Pilate and before all of that
[1:28:38] they were hitting him they were forcing
[1:28:42] him to talk and he would not speak a
[1:28:44] word
[1:28:45] until Palace say hey they say you are a
[1:28:49] king
[1:28:50] I doubt a king and he said you said that
[1:28:53] right I am a king for this for this
[1:28:56] cause of to this end came right onto the
[1:29:00] Earth
[1:29:01] to Bear witness of Truth
[1:29:08] and
[1:29:09] Pilots went on
[1:29:11] to mock him and say hey if you are a
[1:29:13] king you should defend yourself
[1:29:16] and he took a pilot you know my kingdom
[1:29:20] is not of this world
[1:29:23] otherwise here is a principle my servant
[1:29:27] would defend me but his kingdom was
[1:29:31] about to be born
[1:29:32] his kingdom was about to be born in the
[1:29:35] heart of the children of God by the
[1:29:38] spirit of God meaning that when his
[1:29:41] kingdom is made flesh his children will
[1:29:45] be able to defend him
[1:29:47] his children will be able to stand Toe
[1:29:51] to Toe with the Enemy to say Christ that
[1:29:53] you crucify the life that was released
[1:29:56] is on me right now that's why greater
[1:30:00] than Solomon is here brother can say oh
[1:30:04] when Christ took the the Bible and he
[1:30:08] read it that the spirit of God was upon
[1:30:11] me and he has anointed me to declare the
[1:30:14] year of Liberty
[1:30:17] the same thing is being fulfilled right
[1:30:20] now because God is anointing his people
[1:30:23] once again to proclaim the the word of
[1:30:27] God to a dying generation
[1:30:30] we are commissioned we are anointed for
[1:30:34] the purpose of God to carry forward the
[1:30:36] gospel of God why are we so afraid
[1:30:40] why are we not stepping into the purpose
[1:30:42] of God and living it and knowing that
[1:30:45] nothing
[1:30:47] nothing there is no power in Hell there
[1:30:51] is no sin stronger enough to hold a
[1:30:54] Christian
[1:30:56] because of what not on our own doing
[1:30:59] because of what Christ has done because
[1:31:02] he said I'm dying but I'm dying so that
[1:31:06] my life
[1:31:07] will be in the bride my life will be in
[1:31:10] the church
[1:31:12] all that God was he brought into Christ
[1:31:15] or that Christ was he pour into the into
[1:31:19] the church
[1:31:21] you see why did God anointed Christ with
[1:31:24] his Spirit when he came down and said
[1:31:27] hear ye him
[1:31:30] that adoption that Christ will do
[1:31:34] everything that the father will do
[1:31:37] the adoption is not for just a gift for
[1:31:41] him to do Miracles no
[1:31:44] their adoption is that you enforce the
[1:31:48] same power that the father has through
[1:31:50] the Sun
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:55] and Christ lived his whole life with
[1:31:58] awareness
[1:32:00] that he's here for a purpose
[1:32:06] are we sleeping through life
[1:32:08] hoping to make it house tomorrow will be
[1:32:12] all things no
[1:32:14] we are here in 2021 for our purpose
[1:32:19] amen
[1:32:23] don't ask somebody else your purpose
[1:32:25] I'll just jump there
[1:32:27] your purpose is discover when you meet
[1:32:31] him face to face
[1:32:33] that's the only way not a possible way
[1:32:37] your parents cannot give you your
[1:32:40] purpose of life
[1:32:41] as much as they love you they challenge
[1:32:44] you they want to help you they cannot
[1:32:49] every Son of God must meet him
[1:32:53] personally
[1:32:55] because it's in that personal encounter
[1:32:58] with God that you are commissioned
[1:33:02] said the people of Israel must listen to
[1:33:06] Moses why
[1:33:08] because God was with him
[1:33:10] it's not maybe so he was not pleading
[1:33:13] for favor from the people he knew where
[1:33:17] he stand he knew that he was
[1:33:19] commissioned to take the people from
[1:33:21] Egypt to the Canaan land
[1:33:26] we are commissioned
[1:33:29] to take this gospel to all the world
[1:33:33] amen we are commission to leave this
[1:33:36] work word to a Dying World
[1:33:43] so as Christ stood knowing what the
[1:33:47] father wants him to do and surrendering
[1:33:50] his will to the father's will
[1:33:53] are we willing to do the same thing
[1:34:02] in the message expression
[1:34:04] or expressions
[1:34:07] only the things that fulfill the purpose
[1:34:11] of God will come into Resurrection
[1:34:17] we are not saved
[1:34:20] for 30 years 20 years 15 years for us to
[1:34:25] just occupy a few
[1:34:28] God has a plan and a purpose for us why
[1:34:31] he saved us
[1:34:33] there is just like a contractor nothing
[1:34:37] in that field
[1:34:39] is is there for just leisure most of the
[1:34:44] time when you go to a construction site
[1:34:46] You Don't See
[1:34:48] flowers
[1:34:50] they are nice
[1:34:52] but it does not not at that point in
[1:34:55] time they don't meet the requirement
[1:34:57] they will be used later for decoration
[1:35:00] and
[1:35:01] opening ceremonies but when they are
[1:35:05] building and bulldozers are moving
[1:35:07] things there you don't have flowers
[1:35:10] there
[1:35:12] there is no decorative Christian
[1:35:16] in the army of God we are placed here
[1:35:19] for a purpose and we must get in line to
[1:35:22] find out what we need to do
[1:35:25] and why do I need to encourage you
[1:35:27] because I need you amen
[1:35:31] without you
[1:35:32] fulfilling your portion we are not
[1:35:35] complete
[1:35:37] amen as Hebrews 11 chapter came to the
[1:35:41] end all these Great Men all the heroes
[1:35:44] of Faith they were not completed without
[1:35:47] us
[1:35:49] the body of Christ alive today is not
[1:35:53] completed if each one does not take its
[1:35:56] own position
[1:36:04] so we need each other we need to stand
[1:36:07] we need to you see one of the key things
[1:36:12] if you are in a in an army I'll use that
[1:36:15] example there is something called
[1:36:17] general order and there is specific
[1:36:19] order
[1:36:21] when they go to Iraq they will be under
[1:36:24] a general order to maintain Security
[1:36:27] First for the Americans and the the West
[1:36:33] second for maybe Iraqi officials and it
[1:36:37] goes in
[1:36:39] in different steps that's the general
[1:36:42] order which means they don't need a
[1:36:45] permission
[1:36:47] if they see something that is going to
[1:36:49] hurt
[1:36:50] that general order
[1:36:52] they can open fire they can do whatever
[1:36:55] based on the general order
[1:36:59] anything that conflicts with what they
[1:37:02] are there for
[1:37:05] you just bear with me
[1:37:07] Christians we have a general order
[1:37:11] not to negotiate with the Enemy
[1:37:15] we have a general order to say our
[1:37:18] children will not be subservient to the
[1:37:22] society that we live in
[1:37:24] we have a general order that said that
[1:37:28] says the Lord whatsoever you said
[1:37:33] amen that we are not going to burden to
[1:37:36] anything or sickness it's a general
[1:37:39] order you do not need a permission to
[1:37:42] carry it out
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] you have a general order to Proclaim
[1:37:49] what is truth
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:52] and there are specific orders
[1:37:56] a specific order is when they they uh I
[1:38:01] think president Trump ordered the
[1:38:04] killing of the general
[1:38:07] suleimani something like that that was a
[1:38:11] specific order
[1:38:12] amen but here is the key
[1:38:15] if you cannot carry out a general order
[1:38:19] they will not give you a specific order
[1:38:23] everybody wants a special assignment
[1:38:27] but you need to be faithful in the
[1:38:29] general order before you can receive a
[1:38:33] specific order
[1:38:40] so Christ
[1:38:42] show us an example
[1:38:44] and he lived Faithfully
[1:38:46] to what
[1:38:47] he was caught to do
[1:38:50] the prophet of the age
[1:38:52] heals the same way
[1:38:54] delay a foundation for us that we can
[1:38:56] follow
[1:38:58] that's why he can say now for a moment
[1:39:00] do I bring a message
[1:39:02] to the people that they may follow me or
[1:39:05] to join my church or to start some
[1:39:07] fellowship organ and organization I have
[1:39:11] never done done that
[1:39:14] I will not do that now
[1:39:17] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:39:20] have an interest in the things of God
[1:39:23] and people
[1:39:26] and if I can accomplish one thing
[1:39:30] I will be satisfied
[1:39:34] that one thing is to see establish
[1:39:37] a true spiritual Fellowship between God
[1:39:40] and man
[1:39:42] what in man become
[1:39:44] New Creation in Christ filled with the
[1:39:48] Holy Spirit and live according to his
[1:39:51] word
[1:39:54] that was his Commission
[1:39:57] you see when you have a revelation when
[1:39:59] you have your commission when you go to
[1:40:01] Iraq whatever your commission is you
[1:40:05] need to fit into the general and any
[1:40:08] specific order before
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:16] if you go to Iraq to fight
[1:40:19] for the government the gov we don't
[1:40:24] halfway just switch and start supporting
[1:40:29] um the caliphate
[1:40:33] amen so the church is order
[1:40:37] through Christ
[1:40:39] to be a witness of Truth
[1:40:42] everybody else that come after that
[1:40:45] needs to follow the same
[1:40:48] so Paul can say I lay a foundation look
[1:40:52] therefore how you build on it
[1:40:57] so the prophet also came built on top of
[1:41:00] that in an alignment with what Christ
[1:41:02] did and all the prophets all the
[1:41:05] apostles until now
[1:41:07] so when we find our purpose how do we
[1:41:10] know it is according to the word when it
[1:41:13] fits in line with what they've done
[1:41:15] before that
[1:41:18] here we have our commission to serve the
[1:41:21] body of Christ we look at how the
[1:41:24] prophets serve the body of Christ
[1:41:27] he serve it
[1:41:29] by establishing a relationship between
[1:41:32] man and God
[1:41:43] the time is almost gone
[1:41:48] amen
[1:41:51] you see
[1:41:54] man is God's agent
[1:41:58] God cannot do anything except he does it
[1:42:01] through men
[1:42:04] matter of fact the word tell us that
[1:42:07] the field
[1:42:09] is plenteous
[1:42:11] but the workers are few
[1:42:15] which means we need to just Avail
[1:42:17] ourselves to the master Reaper so he can
[1:42:21] put us in line with what he's doing and
[1:42:24] his purpose of accomplishing it
[1:42:30] he gave to each one
[1:42:33] according to
[1:42:35] the measure of faith that we have
[1:42:39] because of that we don't need anybody as
[1:42:41] position
[1:42:42] we don't need anybody else at work we
[1:42:45] need to do what God has called us to do
[1:42:48] and God has something for each one of us
[1:43:04] I'll finish with this bear with me for a
[1:43:06] few few more minutes
[1:43:08] let's take for instance Abraham
[1:43:11] I'm reading this from uh paragraph 57
[1:43:15] from that time
[1:43:18] 62. from that time it's a message that
[1:43:21] Brad Brahman preached I think eight
[1:43:22] several times trying to get something to
[1:43:26] the church
[1:43:28] matter of fact that message was born out
[1:43:30] of an unexperienced that rabbana had
[1:43:33] when he went to uh what what we call an
[1:43:36] insane institution there was a lady that
[1:43:38] was pretty and so on
[1:43:41] hey what are the patients and she said
[1:43:45] how about you start with me
[1:43:47] and Bradham said you
[1:43:50] she say yes they say I I I'm losing it
[1:43:53] and so on and through that the message
[1:43:56] through that problem
[1:43:59] ask her
[1:44:01] what are you living for
[1:44:03] oh she said nothing she's good for
[1:44:07] almost nothing and said
[1:44:12] have you ever thought
[1:44:14] that you can be married have children
[1:44:19] and she said oh who marry me
[1:44:24] but a prophet did not stop there
[1:44:28] because
[1:44:29] she did not know her purpose
[1:44:31] but she's about to know her purpose
[1:44:34] how when she will meet him the Creator
[1:44:39] so the prophet knew he didn't need to
[1:44:42] argue about how to get there until he
[1:44:46] get her to Christ
[1:44:48] because Christ will give her her purpose
[1:44:55] I just come back from Air to Abraham
[1:45:00] the prophet say
[1:45:04] Abraham he was an ordinary man he came
[1:45:07] down from Babylon with his father and he
[1:45:10] lived and dwell in that land of the
[1:45:12] champions in the city of Earth probably
[1:45:15] a farmer an ordinary man
[1:45:18] he was no special person or a man
[1:45:22] he was just a man
[1:45:25] he found Grace in the sight of God
[1:45:29] and he was 75
[1:45:31] I
[1:45:34] Abraham was no special man
[1:45:40] according to the prophet
[1:45:42] but let me ask you this question is
[1:45:44] Abraham a special man
[1:45:46] is the father of Faith a special man
[1:45:50] what make him special
[1:45:53] is because he come his world come
[1:45:56] colliding with God and God gave him a
[1:45:59] purpose
[1:46:01] what will make a difference in your life
[1:46:04] I I I can see the time is running and uh
[1:46:08] we need to go but let me just make this
[1:46:10] one make Abraham special is because he
[1:46:14] come in contact with God
[1:46:17] da alone made him special in his
[1:46:22] generation there were thousands of men
[1:46:25] maybe in Earth at that time but we know
[1:46:29] only about one man Abraham why he came
[1:46:33] in contact with God God gave him a
[1:46:37] purpose but here is the key he accepted
[1:46:40] it
[1:46:42] so I will turn it around will you accept
[1:46:46] the purpose of God concerning your life
[1:46:49] it made a difference in Abraham's life
[1:46:52] everybody wants to know the end from the
[1:46:55] beginning but not that's not the way God
[1:46:57] works
[1:46:58] the way to know the purpose of God
[1:47:01] concerning your life is to walk by faith
[1:47:04] ask God unfold things in front of you
[1:47:09] you see God came to Abraham and called
[1:47:13] Abraham
[1:47:14] and he gave him just one commission get
[1:47:18] out
[1:47:21] no explanation
[1:47:23] get out of the land of your fathers
[1:47:28] and he obeyed obedience will give you
[1:47:32] the key to your purpose
[1:47:37] same thing applied to children
[1:47:40] go do this why do they have to do it but
[1:47:44] see obedience
[1:47:46] if you follow that there will be a
[1:47:49] nesting to unfold
[1:47:55] what's the purpose for the bride the
[1:47:57] bride needs to walk in the things that
[1:47:59] God has already given her
[1:48:03] as we walk in the light
[1:48:08] he will make way where there seem to be
[1:48:11] no way
[1:48:14] Abraham just walk with God
[1:48:17] and Obey what God told him to do
[1:48:21] and from that that obedience God opened
[1:48:24] a little more
[1:48:26] and say the land
[1:48:28] actually is going to be Canon
[1:48:31] before he did not know the land but God
[1:48:33] now gave him a location of the land
[1:48:37] is going to be Canon
[1:48:40] now he can move into that land
[1:48:43] by obeying the world
[1:48:47] there were many people that followed
[1:48:49] Abraham but only Abraham knew
[1:48:53] the purpose why he was walking
[1:48:56] and God later told him you know the
[1:48:58] purpose is not even the land
[1:49:00] the purpose is that in this land of
[1:49:03] Canaan there will be a city
[1:49:07] a city that is made by God himself
[1:49:13] what
[1:49:14] he only knew about cities that are made
[1:49:17] by man
[1:49:19] but for the first time God is unveiling
[1:49:22] in front of him something greater and
[1:49:24] say
[1:49:25] walk in the land and within that land
[1:49:29] there will be a city
[1:49:31] that is made by the hand of God
[1:49:34] talking about actually a city that the
[1:49:37] Seed of Abraham is going to be ahead of
[1:49:40] so Abraham walk in the length and the
[1:49:44] breath of the city of the land
[1:49:47] looking for this city
[1:49:50] though the city the actual series for
[1:49:53] you and I
[1:49:55] but he walk in obedience and because of
[1:49:58] that he is called the father of Faith
[1:50:01] amen when God called him and say
[1:50:04] sacrifice Isaac
[1:50:07] he did not tell him oh how all of that
[1:50:10] is going to unfold
[1:50:13] but through the natural inheritance that
[1:50:17] God has given Abraham
[1:50:19] God is going to elevate his inheritance
[1:50:22] to even a greater level
[1:50:26] because through the art of faith
[1:50:30] God said now I know you love me
[1:50:35] in blessing I will bless you and I feel
[1:50:39] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[1:50:44] obedience
[1:50:45] gave him key to the purpose that was
[1:50:49] greater than what he can see the purpose
[1:50:52] was greater than what Joseph can see
[1:50:54] because the purpose was Resurrection the
[1:50:57] purpose of the trouble of a job was
[1:51:00] greater than everything that job was
[1:51:03] seeing because he was speaking about the
[1:51:05] resurrection
[1:51:07] we have a purpose
[1:51:10] for us to unfold for God to unveil that
[1:51:14] to us we need to walk by faith
[1:51:16] we need to take a step as he unfold the
[1:51:19] world we walk in it
[1:51:22] as we walk in truth he unveiled more
[1:51:25] truth
[1:51:26] and he unveiled my truth we don't need
[1:51:29] to know the end from the beginning we
[1:51:31] just need to have the god of the end
[1:51:33] from the beginning
[1:51:35] God richly bless you for the sake of
[1:51:38] time I'll just stop here musicians you
[1:51:40] can come
[1:51:44] go
[1:51:46] God has a desire
[1:51:49] to accomplish in this day
[1:51:52] his will and purpose through a bride
[1:51:57] [Music]
[1:52:03] you see when something
[1:52:06] gave his all he can stand
[1:52:09] to the Lord
[1:52:10] he can accomplish now
[1:52:13] why he couldn't before
[1:52:16] he surrendered his heart
[1:52:19] to Delilah
[1:52:21] and he used his strength he can carry
[1:52:25] the gates they can burn their fields
[1:52:29] but when he surrendered his heart and
[1:52:32] all that he is to God he destroyed all
[1:52:35] the Philistines
[1:52:39] what we need
[1:52:41] is a surrender heart
[1:52:44] complete yelling
[1:52:46] to him
[1:52:48] and he worked out all purpose
[1:52:51] all things work together for his own
[1:52:54] purpose
[1:52:55] foreign
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:09] did
[1:53:13] problem did not know his commission when
[1:53:16] he was first called
[1:53:17] he did not know about the first pool the
[1:53:20] second pool the third pool but he was
[1:53:23] obedient to what God unfold before him
[1:53:27] and God led him from one purpose to the
[1:53:31] other to the other
[1:53:33] until the opening of the word
[1:53:36] what we need
[1:53:37] sense of God
[1:53:40] let's stop looking aside
[1:53:43] let's stop
[1:53:46] trying to understand everything
[1:53:49] let's know him to know him is life
[1:53:53] and he will give you
[1:53:56] your purpose
[1:53:58] let's look to him together
