[16:07] [Music]
[16:33] Heat. Heat.
[16:38] [Music]
[17:32] Amen. God bless each one of you. Welcome
[17:34] once again in the house of the Lord this
[17:36] morning. Glad to see the Lord protected
[17:38] us. A little slippery out there this
[17:40] morning. Good to be in the house of the
[17:42] Lord, though. And I know that the Lord
[17:44] will will reward you for your sacrifice.
[17:46] That's just the way he is. He will not
[17:48] be a debtor to any man. So here we are
[17:50] to worship him tonight or this morning.
[17:51] Sorry. Stand with me if you would this
[17:54] morning. Start with take up your cross
[17:57] and follow Jesus. He took up his. It's
[18:00] up to us to take up ours. Oh, take up
[18:04] your
[18:07] cross and follow
[18:12] Jesus. Take up your
[18:16] cross each and every day.
[18:19] [Music]
[18:22] Don't be
[18:24] ashamed to say that you know
[18:29] him. Oh, count up the cost. Then take up
[18:33] your cross and follow
[18:37] him. Oh, take up your
[18:42] cross and follow Jesus.
[18:48] Take up your
[18:50] cross each and every
[18:55] day. Oh, don't be
[18:59] ashamed to say that you know
[19:03] him. Oh, count up the cost and take up
[19:08] your cross and follow him. Oh, yes. Take
[19:14] up your
[19:16] cross and follow
[19:21] Jesus. Take up your
[19:25] cross each and every
[19:29] day. Oh, don't be
[19:34] ashamed to say that you know him.
[19:40] Count of the cross. Then take up your
[19:43] cross and follow
[19:46] [Applause]
[19:48] me. If we do that, then we can do the
[19:52] following. I can do all
[19:57] things through Christ who gives me
[20:01] strength. Isn't that good news this
[20:02] morning? But
[20:04] sometimes I wonder what he can do
[20:09] through
[20:10] [Applause]
[20:12] me. Oh, no great success to
[20:19] show, no
[20:21] glory of my
[20:25] own. Yet in my weakness, he is there to
[20:31] let me
[20:35] know. His strength is
[20:40] perfect when our strength is.
[20:47] Oh, he'll carry
[20:50] us when we
[20:53] cannot carry
[20:58] on. Praised in his
[21:02] power, the
[21:04] weak become
[21:10] strong. His strength is
[21:13] [Music]
[21:15] perfect. His strength is
[21:22] burn. Oh, we can only
[21:28] know the power that he
[21:34] holds. When we truly see how deep our
[21:40] weakness goes.
[21:42] [Music]
[21:45] Oh, his strength in us
[21:51] begins when house comes to an
[21:56] in and he
[21:58] hears our humble cry and proves
[22:07] again. His strength is
[22:11] perfect. When our strength is
[22:18] gone, he'll carry
[22:22] us when we cannot carry on.
[22:30] raised in his
[22:34] power. The weak become
[22:39] [Music]
[22:41] strong. His strength is
[22:47] perfect. His strength is perfect.
[22:54] and
[22:55] turn your
[22:58] eyes upon
[23:02] [Music]
[23:03] Jesus. Oh,
[23:06] look in his
[23:10] wonderful face.
[23:15] Oh, and the
[23:17] things of this earth, oh, will grow
[23:23] strangeely
[23:26] dim in the
[23:28] light of his
[23:31] glory and grace. Let's sing that chorus
[23:34] again. Brother Mario, would you come,
[23:35] brother Mario? Oh, yes.
[23:39] Turn your
[23:42] eyes upon
[23:48] Jesus. Oh, look
[23:51] for in his
[23:54] wonderful face.
[24:00] And the
[24:01] things on this earth will grow
[24:08] strangely
[24:10] dim in the light of his
[24:21] glory. Let's bow our head for a word of
[24:25] prayer.
[24:28] Precious heavenly
[24:32] father, this morning once
[24:35] again we declare that your strength is
[24:41] perfect. Even though we are weak, Father
[24:46] God, we are fully
[24:49] aware that your strength is made
[24:52] perfect, Father God, in the time of
[24:55] weaknesses.
[24:57] Because the Apostle Paul said,
[25:01] "When we are weak,
[25:03] that's when we are strong."
[25:08] Father, we've come before you this
[25:09] morning,
[25:11] Lord, because we want to give reverence
[25:13] to your name.
[25:17] Because that name is still
[25:20] powerful. As the Bible says, you are
[25:23] still the same
[25:25] yesterday, today, and forever more.
[25:30] That's mean, Father God, if you walked
[25:32] on water thousand years ago, 2,000 years
[25:35] ago, you can still do it today.
[25:39] If you heal,
[25:42] 2,000 years ago, you still can do it
[25:45] today, Father God.
[25:48] If by the bre by the breath of your
[25:51] nostril, you parted the Red Sea, Father
[25:53] God, you can still part it for someone
[25:56] today, Father.
[25:58] Lord, there are needs that are unspoken,
[26:01] Father
[26:02] God. Lord, Father God, you know the
[26:05] secret of the heart of men, Father God.
[26:08] God, there are things, Father God, we
[26:10] not even explain it to nobody because
[26:13] they will not understand, right? My
[26:16] Lord, Father God, those needs, Father
[26:19] God, needs to be met, Lord Jesus Christ.
[26:23] You can scrutinize in the heart of mans,
[26:25] Father God, and find the secrets, Father
[26:27] God, that that they are hiding, Father
[26:30] God, and speak to them individually,
[26:32] Lord Jesus
[26:34] Christ. There might be somebody here,
[26:36] Father God, that have a request before
[26:39] you long time ago and they thank you for
[26:43] God. And sometime I will pray father god
[26:46] when you come and intervene to our needs
[26:48] our prayer said lord I didn't ask you
[26:52] for that much but you do it you do it
[26:55] more than I asked father god we are here
[26:58] father god with the expectations for you
[27:01] to meet our needs not only this father
[27:04] god but we are here father god to give
[27:07] you praise we are not here to meet one
[27:10] another even though this is important
[27:12] father god if we are coming here, Father
[27:15] God, and not hearing from you. This time
[27:17] is in vain, Father God. We don't want
[27:19] this to happen, Lord. Lord, bless this
[27:23] time that we are spending together. And
[27:25] more importantly, give us a word, Father
[27:27] God, that can transform our hearts, Lord
[27:30] Jesus Christ. And may this message,
[27:32] Father God, just in come into our hearts
[27:36] and dwell in there. We can recall,
[27:38] Father God, this message that is going
[27:40] to be pray that that is going to be
[27:42] preached. Father God, bless the songs
[27:45] that that are singing. Father God, we
[27:47] can feel that your presence is already
[27:49] there, Father God. Lord, bless your
[27:51] word, Father God, because the Bible says
[27:53] this is the confidence that we have in
[27:55] you that if we have if we ask anything
[27:59] according to your will, Father God, you
[28:01] will give it to us. We claim your
[28:03] presence this morning, Father God, and
[28:05] you shall give it to us, Lord Jesus
[28:08] Christ. Thank you, Lord. If there is
[28:10] anything that we shall ask, we don't
[28:12] know, we don't know, Father God, please
[28:14] do it. Do the impossible this morning,
[28:17] Lord Jesus Christ. Talk to someone. Talk
[28:19] to me. Give us our portion this morning,
[28:22] Father God. Because we are here, Father
[28:25] God, because we want to receive our
[28:28] portion. Bless the musicians. Bless
[28:31] everything that is going to be said in
[28:34] this service. For in Jesus name we pray.
[28:37] Somebody say,
[28:42] "Amen." Thank you, my brother. You may
[28:44] have your seats this morning. Good to be
[28:47] a Christian. Good to have brothers and
[28:49] sisters that standing with you. Brother

[33:07] story. How a savior came from glory.
[33:13] how he gave his life on
[33:17] Calvary to save a fresh like me. Oh,
[33:22] when I heard

[33:35] that sins and I won the victory.

[34:11] launched me to
[34:15] victory that cleansing
[34:18] blood. Oh, I heard about his
[34:23] healing of his cleansing power
[34:27] revealing how he made the pain to walk
[34:32] again.
[34:34] And he calls the blind to
[34:37] see. And I cry, "Dear
[34:41] Jesus, would
[34:45] you
[34:47] spit?" And somehow Jesus came and

[39:53] Savior, it's always a privilege together
[39:56] in your
[39:58] name. Father, we come knowing that in
[40:01] you all the problems are solved. We come
[40:05] knowing that you know the ending from
[40:06] the beginning. Father, we are so
[40:09] grateful, Lord, that you determine the
[40:12] end from the beginning.
[40:14] That we are not walking through life
[40:16] like people who have no hope, like
[40:19] people who have no faith, like people
[40:21] who don't know our destiny. No, you
[40:23] secured our destiny before you called
[40:25] us. What a privilege, precious Lord. And
[40:28] that is why our victory depends solely
[40:31] on you. It's not on our merit. And we

[40:54] give us, Lord. Our prayer this morning
[40:56] that you help us not to miss the things
[40:59] that are coming from the pulpit, Lord.
[41:01] not to miss the life, the healing, the
[41:04] deliverance that comes from the pulpit.
[41:06] Oh Lord, help us in all humility to
[41:09] receive all that you have for us. Oh
[41:10] Lord, help us not to take it for
[41:12] granted. Lord, we love you. We
[41:15] appreciate you, Father. We invite your
[41:17] presence here this morning. Father,
[41:18] bless the ongoing service. Father, take
[41:21] control and let it all be pleasing to
[41:23] you, Lord. As we bring in the tithe and
[41:25] offerings, Father, we pray that you'll
[41:27] bless it and sanctify it for the purpose
[41:29] for which it is intended. Lord, we love
[41:31] you. We appreciate you. Inspire your
[41:33] word to our hearts this morning in Jesus
[41:35] Christ's name. Amen. Amen.

[44:17] the time of the latter rain. So the Lord
[44:19] shall make bright clouds and give them
[44:22] showers of rain to everyone grass in the
[44:26] field. And the scripture says, "Oh that
[44:29] thou wouldest ren the
[44:30] heavens that thou wouldest come down
[44:33] that the mountains might flow down at
[44:35] thy presence." Another one says, "And
[44:38] when the day of Pentecost was fully
[44:42] come, they were all with one accord in
[44:45] one place, and suddenly there came a
[44:47] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[44:49] wind, and it filled all the house where
[44:53] they were sitting." This is a song. I
[44:55] pray it be a blessing to you this
[44:56] morning. Amen.
[45:23] The land is laying
[45:27] barren
[45:30] desolation everywhere.
[45:35] The
[45:35] harvest that we long
[45:39] for. We look and it's not
[45:45] there. The devil
[45:48] sws his evil seed to thwart the master's
[45:53] plan.
[45:57] Tired and
[46:01] discouraged, the servants walk as best
[46:04] they
[46:07] can. Send out
[46:11] a Holy
[46:13] Ghost
[46:16] revival. Revive us.
[46:22] [Music]
[46:23] Send the rain from heaven to flood our
[46:28] thirsty
[46:31] souls. We need a Holy
[46:35] Ghost
[46:38] revive. Revive
[46:40] us,
[46:44] Lord. Open up the
[46:48] heavens. Take control.
[46:55] The sky seems brass above
[46:59] us as we look for promised
[47:05] rain. We sow the seed of precious
[47:10] truth to reap the
[47:13] golden grain.
[47:16] But the spirit's power is what we
[47:21] need to see the harvest
[47:25] come. So Lord, send the Holy
[47:31] Spirit. Come and
[47:34] glorify your
[47:37] son. Send down
[47:41] a Holy
[47:44] Ghost revival.
[47:48] Revive
[47:52] us send the
[47:54] rain from
[47:56] heaven to flood our thirsty
[48:01] souls. We need a Holy
[48:05] Ghost revival.

[50:33] Stand with me if you would as we ask our
[50:35] pastor to come. I believe that's our
[50:37] promise. The bride's revival is a
[50:40] promise. It's an individual one. It's
[50:41] not a group one. That's to the Jews. But
[50:44] the individual, we can say, Lord, be on
[50:47] to me according to thy word. Amen. This

[55:01] [Music]
[55:03] by. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[55:06] Welcome to the house of the Lord. What a
[55:09] tremendous song that is. We know that
[55:12] he's already
[55:14] here. And if we have a need today, he is
[55:17] more than able to meet that need in our
[55:19] lives.
[55:21] because we believe it that he is the
[55:23] same yesterday, today, and
[55:25] forever. And if he has never made
[55:28] himself known to us in that way, my
[55:31] prayer for this service is that he
[55:34] would that we wouldn't just know him as
[55:37] a a fable, that we wouldn't know him as
[55:40] a tradition, but that we would know him
[55:44] as the living God. Not just as the
[55:46] living God, but our living God.
[55:50] just like to welcome brother John with
[55:52] us this morning. I believe he's
[55:54] traveling through and we just want to
[55:57] welcome you in the name of the Lord
[55:58] Jesus Christ and trust you feel right at
[56:00] home.
[56:01] Brother, we just have uh a couple of
[56:04] prayer requests. We want to continue to
[56:06] remember brother Johnny
[56:08] Huckluck needs a touch from the
[56:11] Lord. I also like to remember my nephew
[56:15] Zack
[56:16] Natarak. He is
[56:19] He's been afflicted his entire life
[56:21] since birth with
[56:22] musculardrophe and uh he has been
[56:25] admitted to the hospital this last
[56:27] week with a virus. He's not breathing on
[56:30] his own and
[56:32] uh they diagnosed him with a collapsed
[56:35] lung, partially collapsed lung. And in
[56:38] his condition that's a real bad thing
[56:40] naturally
[56:42] speaking. His mom is a real believer and
[56:45] uh she has always held the name of Jesus
[56:48] before her family. It's my sister. She
[56:52] also has the disease
[56:55] musculardrophe. She also got the same
[56:57] virus because it's hyper
[57:00] contagious. And uh just want to remember
[57:02] her as well as my mom Sharon Clark who
[57:05] has the same disease.
[57:08] We just trust that the Lord will bring
[57:11] comfort and dispel the fear and bring
[57:15] healing.
[57:16] And if you have a need this morning,
[57:18] maybe just make it known to unto him by
[57:20] way of an uplift hand as we go to him in
[57:22] prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[57:25] you know the needs on our hearts, Lord.
[57:28] We know there was a time, Father, where
[57:31] many people walked away from you and you
[57:34] looked at your 12 and you said, "Will
[57:36] you go
[57:39] also?" And we know they turned to you
[57:41] and said, "Lord, unto whom could we
[57:46] go?" Many times in this life, Lord, we
[57:49] see situations and trials, Lord, and we
[57:53] just don't know what way to go.
[57:56] We don't know where to turn, Father,
[57:58] naturally
[57:59] speaking. But Father, we're so thankful
[58:02] that we can always turn to you.
[58:05] That your ears are always open every
[58:07] time we
[58:09] pray. Father, we're so thankful that you
[58:12] are the living God.
[58:16] And if we have known you any other way,
[58:18] Father, we pray that you would forgive
[58:19] us for it now, Lord Jesus, that we could
[58:23] give you your rightful position in our
[58:25] lives, Lord. Father, this morning, we
[58:28] just want to remember each and every
[58:30] need made known unto you today by the
[58:32] way of an uplift hand. Father, we just
[58:34] ask that you would touch them, Lord.
[58:36] Touch each heart, Lord Jesus. Bring to
[58:39] pass that which the desire is in your
[58:42] children's hearts, Lord Jesus. We know
[58:44] that when we have your Holy Ghost,
[58:46] Father, when when you, the Spirit of
[58:47] truth, comes in, that we will never ever
[58:50] ask a miss, Lord, that we will always
[58:52] ask according to your word. But we know
[58:54] that without your spirit, we will ask a
[58:56] miss. We know that that's what James
[58:58] said, that we ask many times to consume
[59:02] things upon the lust of our mind and of
[59:05] our
[59:06] flesh. Forgive us,
[59:08] Lord. Let us come according to your
[59:11] will, which is your word. Yes. Thank
[59:14] you, Lord. Then we know things will get
[59:16] done.
[59:18] Father, we pray that you would just
[59:19] bless each one for their need this
[59:21] morning, Lord, in a special way. Father,
[59:24] I just want to remember my mom and my
[59:25] sister. You know the needs, Father. We
[59:28] pray that you would just bring healing
[59:29] to Kelly and and to Zach, her son. Lord,
[59:33] none of them asked for this, Lord, but
[59:35] they find themselves in this
[59:37] circumstance and
[59:39] situation. And father, they have kept
[59:42] your
[59:43] name. I thank you for my family, Lord.
[59:45] And I pray that we could just be a
[59:47] witness of your life unto them. Father,
[59:49] I pray that you would bring healing to
[59:51] Zach. Bring him comfort, Lord, even now
[59:53] while he's laid up in a hospital, not
[59:56] even able to help himself, Lord. Father,
[59:59] I pray that you would heal my sister,
[1:00:01] Lord. That you would just give her
[1:00:03] strength, Lord Jesus, in a time where
[1:00:05] she can't even manage looking after her
[1:00:07] son. And now she is under the weather.
[1:00:09] how she has become sick. Lord, we know
[1:00:12] that it's times like this that you
[1:00:14] specialize, Lord.
[1:00:17] And we just thank you for that. We just
[1:00:19] commit them all into your hands, Lord,
[1:00:21] for your glory. Now, as we turn to your
[1:00:24] word, Father, we pray that you would
[1:00:26] just have the preeminence, Lord, that we
[1:00:27] could just yield our minds and our
[1:00:30] hearts, all of our thoughts and our
[1:00:33] traditions and our ways unto you,
[1:00:35] Father, that you would have the right of
[1:00:38] way. Yes, ma'am. That you would speak to
[1:00:40] us, Lord. That we wouldn't have just
[1:00:42] come here this morning for a a vain
[1:00:44] meeting, Lord, for some traditional
[1:00:46] gathering, Lord Jesus. But that we would
[1:00:48] be changed one more time. Oh, Father,
[1:00:51] word cell upon word cell from glory unto
[1:00:54] glory, we pray that you could just have
[1:00:56] the rightful position that you desire in
[1:00:59] the hearts of every one of your children
[1:01:01] today, Father. Amen. Oh Lord Jesus, in
[1:01:03] my heart,
[1:01:05] too. Father, we need you and we love
[1:01:07] you. We thank you for your goodness and
[1:01:09] we just commit all that's said and done
[1:01:11] in this service now into your hands for
[1:01:13] your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:01:16] pray.
[1:01:18] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you
[1:01:23] musicians for your desire to serve one
[1:01:26] more
[1:01:27] time to set the
[1:01:31] atmosphere that we could worship.
[1:01:34] If you could turn in your Bibles with me
[1:01:36] over to the book of
[1:01:39] Mark. Mark chapter
[1:01:46] 7. Mark chapter
[1:01:49] 7. I trust that it's a familiar
[1:01:51] scripture. And if it's not, I trust that
[1:01:53] it will be by the time we're done today.
[1:02:00] I believe it is a a fairly familiar
[1:02:02] scripture if you know about the message
[1:02:04] of the hour and you've heard it and and
[1:02:07] read it. We'll start with verse 24 of
[1:02:11] St. Mark chapter
[1:02:14] 7. And from then he arose, speaking
[1:02:18] about Jesus, and he went into the
[1:02:20] borders of Ty and
[1:02:22] Siden, and entered into a
[1:02:29] house, sorry, and entered into a house,
[1:02:31] and would have had no man know it, but
[1:02:35] he could not be
[1:02:36] hid. For a certain woman, whose young
[1:02:39] daughter had an unclean spirit heard of
[1:02:42] him, and came and fell at his feet. The
[1:02:47] woman was a Greek, a cyro phoenician by
[1:02:50] nation, and she besought him that he
[1:02:53] would cast forth the devil out of her
[1:03:00] daughter. Someone's got the emergency
[1:03:03] bell going.
[1:03:05] But Jesus said unto her, "Let the
[1:03:08] children first be
[1:03:10] filled, for it is not meat to take the
[1:03:13] children's bread and cast it unto the
[1:03:18] dogs." And she answered and said unto
[1:03:21] him, "Yes,
[1:03:23] Lord. Yet the dogs under the table eat
[1:03:26] of the children's crumbs."
[1:03:29] And he said unto her, for this saying,
[1:03:33] go thy way. The devil is gone out of thy
[1:03:37] daughter. And when she was come to her
[1:03:40] house, she found the devil gone out and
[1:03:44] her daughter laid upon the
[1:03:47] bed. Let's just bow one more
[1:03:50] time. Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[1:03:52] this word. Thank you for this story,
[1:03:55] Lord. Father, we pray that you would
[1:03:58] just be glorified in this service. We
[1:04:00] know the devil's trying to upset it.
[1:04:02] He's been working at it for hours. And
[1:04:05] Father, we thank you because that means
[1:04:08] something is happening today. Father, I
[1:04:11] pray that Lord, you would just do
[1:04:13] something special for us today. Lord
[1:04:16] Jesus, we're not looking for mighty
[1:04:18] signs and wonders, but Lord, just one
[1:04:21] word spoken from you could change our
[1:04:24] lives forever, Lord. We just want to
[1:04:26] give you the preeminence that you desire
[1:04:29] and commit this service into your hands
[1:04:31] now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's
[1:04:33] name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:04:37] this morning. You may be
[1:04:43] seated. I want to preach today a little
[1:04:46] message just uh skip across one that
[1:04:49] brother Bradam preached in 1964 called
[1:04:52] Perseverant.
[1:04:53] It's uh it's probably a real familiar
[1:04:56] one, but if it's not, I as I said, I
[1:04:59] trust that it will be kind of by the
[1:05:00] time we leave today, by the time we end.
[1:05:04] You know, it's a pretty simple thing,
[1:05:06] but we need to be perseverant in in the
[1:05:08] day in which we live. And you know, this
[1:05:11] this story that we've read this morning,
[1:05:14] this woman who was a Cyrophenician
[1:05:16] woman, she wasn't even a a Jew.
[1:05:20] And uh it's just so interesting because
[1:05:23] she had something in her heart that she
[1:05:27] wanted to see this man
[1:05:29] Jesus. And you know, it's interesting
[1:05:32] because she was not a Jew. So for her to
[1:05:35] actually go in and get in around the
[1:05:37] Jews was a big deal. It wasn't just an
[1:05:40] ordinary thing. And sometimes when we
[1:05:42] read the scripture, it can just seem
[1:05:44] like a natural thing. But it was very
[1:05:46] unnatural for her to be pressing that
[1:05:48] close into the Jews. And here she was
[1:05:52] doing this. But why was she doing it? It
[1:05:55] was because she had a revelation in her
[1:05:57] heart. And you know, when we get a
[1:06:00] revelation in our heart, it's usually
[1:06:02] from God. And when it is from God,
[1:06:06] nothing will stop us. There's nothing
[1:06:09] that will shake us. Nobody can get us
[1:06:12] upset. Nobody can actually push us out
[1:06:16] or put us in. It's a revelation from
[1:06:18] God. And it's interesting because this
[1:06:20] woman, we'll get into a little bit. I'm
[1:06:22] just going to jump ahead. I just want to
[1:06:24] say this and I'm going to say it a few
[1:06:25] times, but you know, Brother Brandham,
[1:06:27] he says it in the message. This woman,
[1:06:29] she actually fought her way to get
[1:06:31] there. And when she got there, what
[1:06:34] happened? Jesus slapped her down. He
[1:06:37] just dismissed her. He said, "You know
[1:06:39] what? You're not even a Jew. And I'm
[1:06:43] sent to the house of children of Israel.
[1:06:45] I'm sent to actually feed those
[1:06:47] children, not the Gentiles. Get out of
[1:06:51] here. And And what did she say? No. No.
[1:06:54] No. No. No. No. No. She wasn't going
[1:06:56] anywhere. She wasn't interested in
[1:06:58] hearing that answer. And And it's
[1:07:01] interesting because as she was there,
[1:07:04] what did Jesus say? The next thing was,
[1:07:07] you know what? It's not meat to feed
[1:07:12] dogs the children's
[1:07:14] bread. What did he do? He didn't
[1:07:17] actually just say, "You're just a
[1:07:19] gentile and this is a ministry that's
[1:07:22] just for the Jews. You're a filthy dog.
[1:07:26] Get out of
[1:07:28] here." And then what
[1:07:30] happened? She kept
[1:07:33] pressing. That didn't deter her. But
[1:07:36] it's interesting because many times
[1:07:37] today you can say something or not and
[1:07:41] people just get offended and
[1:07:44] leave. What would happen if you called
[1:07:46] someone a dog?
[1:07:48] Many times people today, they've got
[1:07:50] dogs and dogs are wonderful. We've got a
[1:07:52] dog. We love dogs. Not like we love
[1:07:54] people. People always are more important
[1:07:57] than animals. There's some people that
[1:07:59] just love animals more than people and
[1:08:00] we can't help that. The prophet said
[1:08:03] there would be people like that. I'm not
[1:08:04] going to get too far into that, but if
[1:08:06] you want to hear it, go and listen to
[1:08:07] this message. He talks about it. But you
[1:08:10] know, animals are nice, but people are
[1:08:13] the reason that God came. Amen. And if
[1:08:18] you take a look at the definition of dog
[1:08:20] in in in terms of what Jesus was talking
[1:08:23] about here, the dog was actually not a
[1:08:26] very nice animal. They didn't just have
[1:08:29] pets in those days of dogs.
[1:08:34] Dogs in those days were likely feral,
[1:08:38] potentially rabid animals that were
[1:08:41] unclean. They were not part of the clean
[1:08:43] animals. The Jews were not supposed to
[1:08:46] have anything to do with it. So when he
[1:08:48] called her a dog, it's not feat to feed
[1:08:50] the children's bread to dogs. He was
[1:08:52] really, really insulting her. And I
[1:08:55] think it's really important to maybe
[1:08:56] just start out with that to understand
[1:08:58] it because it didn't stop her. Yes, sir.
[1:09:02] Yeah, it didn't stop her. And she wasn't
[1:09:06] a part of a church. She wasn't a part of
[1:09:07] a Christian group. She wasn't anything
[1:09:09] on her own. But what was it that
[1:09:12] constrained her? She had heard about
[1:09:14] this man Jesus. And she had a real need
[1:09:17] in her life. And because of that, she
[1:09:19] wasn't interested in anybody's opinion.
[1:09:22] She wasn't interested in anybody's
[1:09:24] ideas. She wasn't even interested in his
[1:09:26] idea.
[1:09:28] She knew that he was the Messiah by
[1:09:31] revelation. And it wasn't nobody going
[1:09:34] to stop her from achieving what she was
[1:09:36] going to do. Amen. Nobody was going to
[1:09:40] offend her because she was unoffendable.
[1:09:44] She knew what she needed and that was to
[1:09:46] see the healing in her daughter.
[1:09:51] I just think it's a beautiful
[1:09:53] story. Now, Brother Brandham talks about
[1:09:55] it and I'm just going to skip over some
[1:09:58] quotes today and just preach a little
[1:10:00] today and just trust that we're just
[1:10:02] following the leadership of the Lord
[1:10:03] today and hopefully somehow someway
[1:10:06] something can happen. You know, out of
[1:10:08] perseverance, brother Brandham, he talks
[1:10:10] about this this this thing. I think it's
[1:10:13] so good. He says, "So, we have little
[1:10:15] fellowships, groups, and so forth. We
[1:10:19] shouldn't differing with each other."
[1:10:22] And you know, brothers and sisters, we
[1:10:23] talk about this from a way that, you
[1:10:25] know, maybe we have a group in Edmonton
[1:10:27] and we have a group in Colona and we got
[1:10:28] a group in Lethbridge and maybe
[1:10:30] Saskatoon. We got groups all over the
[1:10:32] place. That's true. But we can actually
[1:10:35] have groups in the
[1:10:37] church. It's
[1:10:39] important. We have little fellowships,
[1:10:43] groups, and so forth. We shouldn't
[1:10:45] differing with each
[1:10:47] other. But way they they just human
[1:10:50] beings. I think it's human nature. It
[1:10:53] truly is. He says, "I've talked to many
[1:10:56] of the leaders and so forth. I don't
[1:10:58] think it's amongst the
[1:11:00] leaders. I think it's just somebody gets
[1:11:03] in, stirs up
[1:11:06] something."
[1:11:07] Remember, I ain't throwing off on
[1:11:10] anybody because Peter the
[1:11:12] rock, Jesus was dealing with them one
[1:11:15] day and he said, "There's coming a time
[1:11:17] where the son of man's got to be
[1:11:18] delivered up and killed, right?" And
[1:11:22] Peter the rock turned to him and said,
[1:11:24] "No way. Not on my watch. Nobody's going
[1:11:26] to touch you." And what did he do? He
[1:11:28] didn't say, "Peter, come on. You're not
[1:11:30] actually listening to what I'm saying."
[1:11:32] He just simply said, "Get thou behind
[1:11:34] me, Satan.
[1:11:36] Satan was right there in that one that
[1:11:39] they called the rock. The Catholic
[1:11:40] Church says they built the church on
[1:11:42] him. But we know you can't build a
[1:11:45] church on someone that's so unstable
[1:11:46] that would act that way and and curse
[1:11:49] and we know
[1:11:51] betray, run away from Jesus, all the
[1:11:54] stuff that happened with
[1:11:56] him. Brother Bradam, he says that's as
[1:11:59] good as Satan wants to do. You see, he
[1:12:01] just wants to get in someone and he
[1:12:03] wants to get in there and he wants to
[1:12:04] stir it up. That's what Satan wants to
[1:12:06] do. So, I just want to say this. If we
[1:12:08] see someone stirring up or getting
[1:12:10] stirred up, if we're getting stirred up,
[1:12:12] we just need to say, "Satan, I rebuke
[1:12:14] you in the name of Jesus." Because a a
[1:12:16] true believer shouldn't be getting
[1:12:17] stirred up. There was nobody going to
[1:12:20] stir up this Cyranician woman.
[1:12:24] Nobody. Even
[1:12:26] Jesus. She c he called her a dog and she
[1:12:29] said, "Yeah, even the dogs get to eat
[1:12:33] the crumbs that fall from the master's
[1:12:35] table."
[1:12:37] So, brothers and sisters, I want to
[1:12:39] start this today and say, "How are we
[1:12:41] today? Are we robust Christians?"
[1:12:42] Brother Brandham talks about it. The the
[1:12:44] true believers, the real Holy Ghost
[1:12:46] fililled believers ought to have hair on
[1:12:48] their chest, so to speak. They ought to
[1:12:51] be robust. Nobody should be able to
[1:12:53] offend us.
[1:12:55] There shouldn't be anything that really
[1:12:56] gets us upset. What have we got to get
[1:12:58] upset about? We know who our redeemer
[1:13:01] is, but so many times so little things
[1:13:04] can get us get a get a be in our bonnet,
[1:13:07] so to speak. Can get us so upset. Oh my,
[1:13:10] I'm so offended at this thing.
[1:13:13] What's wrong with us? Why are we
[1:13:15] offended? What is there to be offended
[1:13:17] about? We're the redeemed.
[1:13:22] There's nothing to be offended about.
[1:13:24] It's Satan.
[1:13:25] I think it's time that we take off the
[1:13:27] gloves and actually just call it what it
[1:13:29] is. It's Satan. Satan wants to get in
[1:13:31] and get us stirred up one against the
[1:13:33] other. But if we draw close together, he
[1:13:36] can't do it. But the Brandon talks about
[1:13:38] it. I got a quote. I'll get to it. But
[1:13:40] he said, "If we would just stop looking
[1:13:42] out at Satan
[1:13:44] and start looking inwards, maybe I'm
[1:13:46] getting this backwards. If we would just
[1:13:48] stop looking at the problems and start
[1:13:50] looking at the promise,
[1:13:53] become unified, united,
[1:13:56] things might change.
[1:13:59] So appreciate the special this morning.
[1:14:01] Thank you, brothers. That's what we need
[1:14:03] is a Holy Ghost revival in our life.
[1:14:05] It's exactly what we need. Every single
[1:14:06] one of us need that. And I want to say
[1:14:08] this. We ought to be saying that, Lord,
[1:14:10] give me a Holy Ghost revival in my life.
[1:14:13] Amen. Stir up that which already is.
[1:14:18] Take the trash in my life and wash it up
[1:14:21] on the shore. Like we talked about on
[1:14:23] Wednesday. Brother Bana mentions it.
[1:14:24] That's what happens when he was at the
[1:14:26] Great Lakes. He saw the trash getting
[1:14:28] washed up, the waves hitting the shore
[1:14:31] and he saw all the garbage coming out of
[1:14:33] the water. That's what we need in our
[1:14:34] lives. Let's throw out the trash. Get
[1:14:36] out the garbage
[1:14:37] and give him the opportunity to have a
[1:14:39] revival to stir up that that that which
[1:14:42] we already have.
[1:14:44] He says, ' That's as good as Satan wants
[1:14:45] to do. You see, just as long as you're
[1:14:47] firing at one another, you're not firing
[1:14:50] at
[1:14:52] him. Just as long as you're firing at
[1:14:55] one another, you're not firing at him.
[1:14:58] If we just turn our faces about and go
[1:15:00] to firing on him, the great church of
[1:15:04] the living God would come to her colors.
[1:15:07] Christ would come. I believe that. He's
[1:15:10] waiting for us to do it.
[1:15:13] So, what's stopping us, brothers and
[1:15:15] sisters?
[1:15:18] I trust that we're pointing the guns at
[1:15:20] Satan today.
[1:15:22] That we're not pointing the guns at one
[1:15:24] another. If we are, we're not doing what
[1:15:25] the prophet said. Better yet, we're not
[1:15:28] doing what God said through his prophet
[1:15:30] to his people.
[1:15:32] I believe that. He says he's waiting for
[1:15:34] us to do it. Let's point our guns at
[1:15:38] Satan today, brothers and sisters. Let's
[1:15:40] turn our guns on the devil. Let's
[1:15:42] recognize when we someone get see
[1:15:44] someone getting all stirred up and all
[1:15:46] out of bent out of shape because they're
[1:15:48] too rigid in their ways. It's the devil.
[1:15:52] We don't want to see anybody get too
[1:15:53] upset or too bent out of shape. But
[1:15:55] remember, we've got to be flexible in
[1:15:57] this world. God knows that we've got to
[1:15:59] be flexible in this world. He'll allow
[1:16:02] the circumstances to come our way to
[1:16:04] make sure that we are flexible.
[1:16:07] And you know, we look at nature, we can
[1:16:09] see it all over the place. When we see
[1:16:11] the trees, the trees outside when the
[1:16:13] wind blows and they start to sway and
[1:16:16] bend and sway and bend. Remember why
[1:16:18] they do that. It's not so that they can
[1:16:20] actually be stretched and broken and
[1:16:22] damaged. It's so that they can actually
[1:16:24] bend and stretch their roots. Because
[1:16:26] when they stretch their roots, holding
[1:16:28] the whole tree in place, what happens is
[1:16:30] there becomes a little bit of loose spot
[1:16:32] underneath the roots. And as that
[1:16:34] happens, those roots can actually start
[1:16:35] to grow deeper and deeper. So when the
[1:16:38] storms in our lives come, when the
[1:16:40] trials and tribulations happen our way,
[1:16:42] it's so that our spiritual roots can go
[1:16:45] deeper
[1:16:46] and get strongermen, not
[1:16:50] weaker. He's waiting for us to do it.
[1:16:53] And I've tried my best through these 18
[1:16:56] years on the field to try to bring that
[1:16:58] together to see all the hearts united as
[1:17:02] one. All the tents stretch beyond the
[1:17:05] boundary
[1:17:07] line. I think it's beautiful. You know,
[1:17:09] we can we can we can we can behave in
[1:17:12] such a way that we can outshine the
[1:17:15] problems if we want to. I don't even
[1:17:18] know why we're doing this, but we are. I
[1:17:21] just have to trust the Lord. I hope it's
[1:17:23] okay. I hope we're happy today. I hope
[1:17:25] that this is the word of God. It's not
[1:17:28] my word. It's his word. Um we know that
[1:17:30] he said, "Let every man's word be a lie.
[1:17:34] Every word that comes out of a a mouth
[1:17:36] of a man be a lie, but his word be
[1:17:38] true."
[1:17:42] But here he had this woman that had this
[1:17:45] revelation. She heard about the master.
[1:17:47] She heard about this man Jesus and that
[1:17:50] he was in the land and that he was able
[1:17:52] to heal and her daughter was vexed with
[1:17:55] the devil. And I think it's interesting
[1:17:56] because what what does that mean? I know
[1:18:00] my life my whole life I growing up
[1:18:02] reading this story off and on. I always
[1:18:04] thought that it was kind of like the
[1:18:06] story where the the man had the son that
[1:18:08] was vexed with the devil and he was a
[1:18:10] lunatic and he'd throw himself in the
[1:18:11] water and he'd throw himself in the fire
[1:18:13] and we know that when Jesus finally
[1:18:14] said, "Come out of him, evil spirit."
[1:18:17] That's all he said. And what happened?
[1:18:20] The devil threw him down just like he
[1:18:22] was dead. They thought he was dead.
[1:18:24] That's not even part of the story today.
[1:18:27] But I always thought that it was a
[1:18:28] certain way, you know, is my point. And
[1:18:31] and maybe it isn't. What was the devil
[1:18:32] that she had? I think that we could come
[1:18:34] up with any kind of a an adjective or
[1:18:37] any kind of a description for a devil
[1:18:39] that we contend with in the age in which
[1:18:41] we live. There's many. We know the lid
[1:18:43] of hell was taken off in Hollywood.
[1:18:45] There's a 100,000,000 demons on the
[1:18:47] loose. Take your
[1:18:50] pick. We know this scripture applies
[1:18:53] today. We got to put ourselves there.
[1:18:57] I believe we can take and put ourselves
[1:18:59] there and say, "Lord, I've got a need.
[1:19:02] Maybe my child has a need. Maybe my
[1:19:04] spouse has a need. Maybe my friend, my
[1:19:07] sibling, my parent. Maybe an aunt and
[1:19:09] uncle. Maybe a brother or sister. Maybe
[1:19:12] a pastor has a need. But you can pray
[1:19:16] for him.
[1:19:17] You can go to God for any one of those
[1:19:20] people.
[1:19:21] Maybe a teacher, maybe a classmate,
[1:19:24] maybe a
[1:19:25] co-orker. There's so many different
[1:19:26] people that we can pray for. There's
[1:19:28] never ever a shortage of things to pray
[1:19:30] for in this world in which we live. Boy,
[1:19:33] you know, turn with me over to Matthew
[1:19:36] chapter
[1:19:40] 15. I think it's beautiful because it's,
[1:19:43] you know, the same
[1:19:45] story. Out of two or three mouths, let
[1:19:47] every word be
[1:19:49] established. Matthew chapter 15 verse
[1:19:52] 21.
[1:20:03] Then Jesus went thence and departed into
[1:20:05] the coast of Ty and
[1:20:08] Sidon. And
[1:20:10] behold, a woman of Canaan came out of
[1:20:14] the same coast and cried unto him,
[1:20:17] saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou
[1:20:20] son of David. My daughter is grievously
[1:20:23] vexed with the devil. Not just a little,
[1:20:26] but grievously vexed with the devil. But
[1:20:29] he answered her not a word, just ignored
[1:20:33] her. And his disciples came and besought
[1:20:35] him, saying, "Send her away, for she
[1:20:38] crith after us. She's causing a
[1:20:41] disturbance." But he answered and said,
[1:20:44] "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
[1:20:48] of the house of Israel." Then came she
[1:20:51] and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help
[1:20:53] me." But he answered and said, "It's not
[1:20:55] meat to take the children's bread and
[1:20:57] cast it to
[1:21:00] dogs." And she said, "Truth, Lord, yet
[1:21:03] the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
[1:21:05] from their master's table." Then when
[1:21:08] Jesus answered and said unto her, "Oh
[1:21:12] woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto
[1:21:16] thee, even as thou wilt." and her
[1:21:18] daughter was made whole from that very
[1:21:22] hour. Amen.
[1:21:25] She has a need. She's not even a Jew.
[1:21:28] She finally gets through. She fought to
[1:21:30] get there. And what did Jesus do? He
[1:21:33] called her a
[1:21:34] dog. You know, Brother Brandham says it.
[1:21:37] We'll get into it. He says it many
[1:21:39] times. We'll fight our way to get to
[1:21:41] Jesus. And that's as far as we go.
[1:21:45] He said, "You ain't even started
[1:21:47] then." You know, people who are in
[1:21:50] sales, they'll know what I'm saying
[1:21:51] here. I learned this. I learned this
[1:21:53] when I worked for a company. And uh in
[1:21:57] sales specifically, you know, the sale
[1:22:01] only starts at the word
[1:22:05] no. If you understand what I'm saying,
[1:22:07] when somebody says no, they don't want
[1:22:08] it. You're not selling until you're
[1:22:10] actually going beyond their rejection of
[1:22:13] that word of your pitch. The sale
[1:22:17] actually begins when you persuade them
[1:22:19] that yes
[1:22:20] indeed you truly need the product that I
[1:22:23] have. And here we have Jesus telling the
[1:22:26] woman, "Forget it. No way." Her
[1:22:28] disciples were say his disciples were
[1:22:30] saying that you're she's a nuisance. Get
[1:22:32] rid of her. Why do we have her
[1:22:34] here? But Jesus knew all things, didn't
[1:22:37] he? He knew what was going on. He needed
[1:22:40] to let it happen. It was for a
[1:22:43] purpose. You know, I I just think it's
[1:22:46] it's beautiful how we can look at the
[1:22:48] scripture. We can see these these
[1:22:50] stories and and read them and and look
[1:22:52] at them through the lens of this message
[1:22:55] of the hour. And you know, if you've
[1:22:57] listened to these messages, you'll know
[1:22:59] where I'm coming from today. if you
[1:23:01] haven't, I trust that we can impart sort
[1:23:04] of a little bit of the heart of of what
[1:23:06] we're trying to get at, you know, and
[1:23:08] and it's just I I can't help but think
[1:23:10] at the beginning of this message,
[1:23:11] Brother Brandom, he talks about the the
[1:23:13] neighbors. There's neighbors, they have
[1:23:15] ducks, and and each one has their own
[1:23:19] fencedin yard of ducks and they've got
[1:23:21] this division with their ducks. The
[1:23:23] ducks are the same ducks, but they're
[1:23:25] just two separate groups and they're
[1:23:27] fenced off and held apart. We probably
[1:23:29] all know the story very well. But what
[1:23:32] happened was the division started to
[1:23:34] disappear when the flood waters came.
[1:23:36] When the waters started to rise, the
[1:23:38] fence got shorter and shorter and
[1:23:40] shorter. And eventually there was no
[1:23:41] more fence. And what happened was the
[1:23:43] ducks were able to just swim together.
[1:23:45] They were able to be together. They were
[1:23:46] all the same. They weren't any
[1:23:48] different. And then he goes on to talk
[1:23:50] about the corn in the fields and how an
[1:23:53] aviator would fly and look at the corn
[1:23:55] fields and be able to see the the the
[1:23:58] specific field here of corn and there's
[1:24:00] another field here of corn and there's
[1:24:01] another field here of corn and you can
[1:24:04] see the fence lines and how there's very
[1:24:06] distinct lines of division, separation.
[1:24:10] It's the same product in each field but
[1:24:13] there's very specific differences, very
[1:24:16] dividing lines. And you know, he tells
[1:24:20] how that corn just kept growing and
[1:24:21] growing. And the same aviator that flew
[1:24:23] over and saw the fence lines, when that
[1:24:26] corn started to mature, it grew up over
[1:24:29] the fences. The fences didn't mean
[1:24:31] anything anymore. And why didn't it?
[1:24:33] Because that corn got more mature than
[1:24:36] those dividing
[1:24:37] lines. And as the aviator flew over
[1:24:41] later at the harvest time, what did he
[1:24:44] see? He saw one big crop of corn. I
[1:24:47] think that's so beautiful. It's a
[1:24:49] wonderful depiction of the Christian
[1:24:51] life. There comes a point in time where
[1:24:53] we have to move on and mature beyond the
[1:24:56] dividing lines, those division things
[1:24:59] that are here on earth created by the
[1:25:01] devil. It ain't created by the church.
[1:25:05] It's created by the
[1:25:06] devil. But I think it's
[1:25:10] beautiful. Brother Brandham, he says it
[1:25:12] he says it this way. So I think that's
[1:25:14] the way that it ought to be. We ought to
[1:25:16] just not see the fences, just see one
[1:25:18] big crop. We just if we grow a little
[1:25:21] bit, he says, "How many want to grow
[1:25:23] today?" I'll put my hand up and say, "I
[1:25:26] know that I'm not growing as much as I
[1:25:27] want. When I grow up spiritually
[1:25:30] speaking, I want to be like Jesus."
[1:25:34] We just we just need to grow a bit, he
[1:25:36] says. But as long as we're immature,
[1:25:39] we'll still be fenced off. That's the
[1:25:42] prophet's words. So I want to say today,
[1:25:44] brothers and sisters, if we've got
[1:25:46] divisions in our heart, if we've got
[1:25:48] fencing off in our heart, if we say
[1:25:50] whatever, are we mature? I I would think
[1:25:54] not. And I'm not saying we're immature.
[1:25:57] What I'm saying is maybe we need to be
[1:25:59] more mature. Amen.
[1:26:01] And I'll say this because I've had
[1:26:03] divisions in my heart. I'll say it. I'm
[1:26:06] not afraid to say it.
[1:26:08] There's times in my life where I've
[1:26:10] been very spir spiritually legalistic.
[1:26:14] Think about, you know, there's no way
[1:26:16] that I would ever do that. There's no
[1:26:18] way that maybe my family would ever do
[1:26:20] that. And you know what happens? God has
[1:26:22] a way of allowing us to become humble
[1:26:24] just a little bit to say, you know what?
[1:26:25] There is a way that you would do that.
[1:26:27] And there is a way that you could
[1:26:29] actually experience that. Just allow
[1:26:31] yourself to get a little air in your
[1:26:32] tires. Maybe just a little bit too much
[1:26:34] air in your tires. And God will let it
[1:26:36] out.
[1:26:37] exactly the way that we need it. That's
[1:26:39] how he works. Out of perseverance,
[1:26:42] brother Bradom, he says, "Someone was
[1:26:43] preaching one time, there was a boy that
[1:26:46] belonged to the First Baptist church
[1:26:47] when I was a missionary Baptist and I
[1:26:51] was preaching. There was some sister
[1:26:53] really enjoying it and and she got to
[1:26:55] crying and shouting and she was quite a
[1:26:58] ball player." He was quite a ball
[1:27:00] player, sorry. and and he met me a few
[1:27:02] days after that and he said, "I come to
[1:27:04] hear you last night, Billy, but said,"I
[1:27:07] couldn't do it for all them people
[1:27:09] saying, "Amen."
[1:27:12] Remember, he was a ball player. He likes
[1:27:14] to have people
[1:27:17] cheering. And said, "That woman sitting
[1:27:19] over there crying said, "That just got
[1:27:21] on my nerves so
[1:27:23] bad." I said, "Oh, it shouldn't do
[1:27:26] that." I said, "I don't think." He said,
[1:27:29] "Well, I can't imagine heaven being like
[1:27:31] that." Brother Brandham said, "I sure
[1:27:33] can."
[1:27:35] He said, "Well, that just made shivers
[1:27:38] run up my back."
[1:27:42] I guess this one's for free
[1:27:44] today. I said, "If you ever got to
[1:27:46] heaven, you'd freeze to death if you
[1:27:49] hear that noisy group up there." And
[1:27:51] what noisy group is that going to be,
[1:27:53] brothers and
[1:27:55] sisters? Uh-huh.
[1:27:57] This is the quietest place you'll ever
[1:27:59] live. He says, I'll tell you that
[1:28:02] because if you go to hell, he says it.
[1:28:05] There'll be weeping and wailing and
[1:28:07] nashing of teeth. If you go to heaven,
[1:28:09] why even the angels don't stop day and
[1:28:12] night screaming, "Holy, holy, holy is
[1:28:14] the Lord God Almighty." See such
[1:28:16] hallelujah and amens and praise the
[1:28:18] Lord. Well, you never heard such till
[1:28:20] you heard that meeting up
[1:28:23] there. So, this is a quiet place.
[1:28:27] And I want to say it today, brothers and
[1:28:28] sisters, this is a quiet place.
[1:28:31] Don't be bashful. Practice shouting to
[1:28:33] the Lord. Practice giving him worship
[1:28:36] and glory and honor and praise. That
[1:28:39] after all, that's why we gather here,
[1:28:41] isn't it? Why else would we come to this
[1:28:44] house, to this building? Yes. Just to
[1:28:47] have someone say some fine words and and
[1:28:49] and maybe look at ourselves in the
[1:28:51] mirror and shake some hands and go home.
[1:28:53] We come to meet with the living God.
[1:28:57] What was it in in Matthew chapter 15?
[1:29:00] I'm jumping ahead of myself again, but I
[1:29:02] can't help it. It's beautiful. What
[1:29:04] changed the circumstances for her? It
[1:29:06] said that she worshiped him. He refused
[1:29:09] her. She worshiped him.
[1:29:13] What brother Cadre preached here?
[1:29:15] Worship him. What have we heard so many
[1:29:18] times? You want to change the
[1:29:20] circumstances? Worship him. Yes.
[1:29:24] Don't let our our knuckles drag on the
[1:29:26] ground because we're so mopy like a
[1:29:28] Neandrith. Lift up those hands, those
[1:29:31] feeble hands unto heaven and give them
[1:29:33] praise.
[1:29:36] Hallelujah. You know, there's one thing
[1:29:38] that I know for sure is the devils when
[1:29:40] you come into church. Now, Brother
[1:29:41] Barry's probably sound a little bit
[1:29:43] crazy, but I'm going to say it straight.
[1:29:44] They love to just climb on the arms and
[1:29:47] grab onto the arms just like monkeys do
[1:29:49] on trees. You get 30 or 40 devils on
[1:29:52] each arm. But we need to shake those
[1:29:55] arms. Shake those devils off. And when
[1:29:58] it hurts our shoulders, oh, I've got
[1:30:00] that shoulder injury. Stretch into it,
[1:30:03] brothers and sisters, to give him
[1:30:04] worship and see if that shoulder injury
[1:30:07] won't disappear.
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:10] Why will that happen? Because you're
[1:30:12] doing the right thing.
[1:30:15] Remember Sister Hadtie writes, "She said
[1:30:17] the right thing." Amen.
[1:30:19] That was an example for someone. Amen.
[1:30:24] Don't let the devil say, "I don't have
[1:30:25] to worship that way. That's just for
[1:30:27] them." Ah, that's just the devil.
[1:30:30] Shake off that devil and worship him the
[1:30:32] way he desires to be worshiped.
[1:30:35] Remember, this is a quiet
[1:30:37] place. I love what he says here. And I
[1:30:39] always afraid of anything quiet.
[1:30:43] You got to be w careful for those quiet
[1:30:45] people that never say anything because
[1:30:46] you can never tell what they're
[1:30:48] thinking, right? He says, "I'm afraid of
[1:30:51] anything quiet. It sounds dead." So, I'm
[1:30:53] not much for dead things. So, anything
[1:30:55] without emotion is dead. And he says,
[1:30:57] "The scientific research will prove
[1:31:00] that. Anything without emotion." So, if
[1:31:02] your experience hasn't got a little
[1:31:04] emotion in it, you better bury it and
[1:31:07] get something that's got some emotion in
[1:31:09] it. That's right. It's exactly. And I'll
[1:31:12] say it plainly, if you have no emotion,
[1:31:16] go get the Holy Ghost one time and see
[1:31:18] if you don't have some emotion. Remember
[1:31:21] the prophet said the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:23] without sensation, not emotion. When we
[1:31:26] go to saying, "Well, it's not without
[1:31:28] emotion. I I I just need to sit quiet
[1:31:30] and and it's just the way that I'm
[1:31:31] created." I want to say, "Stretch out of
[1:31:34] the place that you're in, the shell that
[1:31:36] you're living under. Crack out of it.
[1:31:38] Pip out of it. see if God won't meet you
[1:31:40] on the other side and bless you.
[1:31:44] I I'll tell you a little story about a
[1:31:46] cyber phoenician woman in this church
[1:31:48] building right here that stepped out of
[1:31:51] the ordinary on a boring old Wednesday
[1:31:53] night service in the middle of worship
[1:31:55] service. She stood up at the word of the
[1:31:58] Lord in her mind and her heart and she
[1:32:01] received healing for the breast cancer
[1:32:03] that she was contending with because she
[1:32:06] stood up and worshiped.
[1:32:10] She wasn't busy murmuring and talking
[1:32:13] bad about people and saying this and
[1:32:15] thinking that and dragging around all
[1:32:17] that baggage. What she was interested in
[1:32:19] was meeting with the living God. He's
[1:32:22] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:26] If we desire more from him, that's
[1:32:28] because there's more of him to be had.
[1:32:30] When there's a deep calling, there's got
[1:32:32] to be a deep to respond.
[1:32:35] Amen.
[1:32:37] Hallelujah. You know, Brother Bradam, he
[1:32:39] talks about it. What happens when you
[1:32:41] kick a dead person?
[1:32:46] They're dead. Kick them. Kick a
[1:32:49] corpse. Gentiles can do
[1:32:52] that. Jews have to go through the
[1:32:54] cleansing
[1:32:56] process. Well, when you kick a dead man,
[1:32:59] maybe he'll just move a little bit and
[1:33:01] that'll be it. You won't hear a sound.
[1:33:04] You might even hurt your foot doing it.
[1:33:07] It doesn't make any difference to him
[1:33:08] because he's dead.
[1:33:11] But brother Bradam says, you know, many
[1:33:12] times we're just a little too not dead.
[1:33:17] We're just a little bit too alive still.
[1:33:20] Soon as someone comes along and kicks
[1:33:21] us, what happens? Oh my, he kicked me.
[1:33:26] She kicked me. There's got to be a deep
[1:33:28] to respond, doesn't there?
[1:33:32] No. No. Because if we've truly died out
[1:33:34] to ourselves, is what the prophet's
[1:33:36] saying. If we've truly died out to
[1:33:37] ourselves, which is what the word of God
[1:33:39] says, we've got to die out to ourselves,
[1:33:41] every single speck of our old man has
[1:33:43] got to die in order for him to live.
[1:33:48] But there's just a little bit too much
[1:33:49] of that old man living inside of us. My,
[1:33:53] you know, Brother Bam, in this message,
[1:33:55] I think it's so good. He goes on and
[1:33:56] talks about a few different people and
[1:33:58] it's just so wonderful. He talks about
[1:34:01] Noah, you know, like the Syrphenician
[1:34:04] woman. Noah had a revelation. God spoke
[1:34:06] to him directly. God didn't speak to the
[1:34:08] whole earth and say that, "Excuse me,
[1:34:10] everyone is evil continually in their
[1:34:12] hearts and I'm going to send a flood. I
[1:34:15] want you to build an ark. Here's the
[1:34:17] dimensions." He didn't have a board of
[1:34:19] directors. There was no uh ministerial
[1:34:22] association, if you will. There was no
[1:34:24] consulting others about this. It was
[1:34:27] simply a personal revelation. And it was
[1:34:28] a revelation from God to Noah. And Noah
[1:34:31] began to act on it because he knew he
[1:34:33] heard from God. He didn't need anybody's
[1:34:35] permission. He wasn't interested in
[1:34:37] anybody's opinion. All he was interested
[1:34:39] in doing was following the word of God
[1:34:42] for his day.
[1:34:44] And we know that he was judged for it.
[1:34:46] The people mocked him. You can imagine
[1:34:50] millions of people on the earth. And
[1:34:52] here this guy with his revelation,
[1:34:54] brother Brham, he depicts it really
[1:34:55] good. They said he must have had
[1:34:57] sunstroke. the old bald bald-headed man
[1:34:59] up there on the hill beating on the wood
[1:35:01] putting up putting together an ark for
[1:35:03] animals cuz it's going to rain. He said,
[1:35:05] "We can scientifically shoot rockets
[1:35:07] into the atmosphere and prove that
[1:35:09] there's no rain." You know, isn't it
[1:35:11] interesting, brothers and sisters, for
[1:35:13] anybody that does see any of the modern
[1:35:15] posts that are online, I'm sure most of
[1:35:17] us have seen it. They're talking about
[1:35:19] the pyramids in Egypt right now. Now,
[1:35:21] Brother Brandham talks about the pyramid
[1:35:22] in Egypt, but they're saying they're
[1:35:24] finding things underneath them, and
[1:35:25] they're saying that these pyramids are
[1:35:27] from a civilization that's way far
[1:35:29] advanced from our civilization,
[1:35:32] something beyond what we could do, even
[1:35:35] in the way that they drill the holes in
[1:35:38] the rock. If you listen to what they
[1:35:40] talk about, I don't have the exact
[1:35:41] specifications, but they say there's no
[1:35:44] way today that they could even drill a
[1:35:46] hole in that rock the same rate of feed
[1:35:49] that they actually drilled in the day in
[1:35:51] whenever it was made. But, you know, it
[1:35:53] was an advanced civilization.
[1:35:55] Scientifically, they could prove that
[1:35:57] there was no rain. There was a mist. The
[1:36:00] anti-dolivian time, it was before the
[1:36:02] flood. Amen. You can imagine the way the
[1:36:05] earth was and and and and the knowledge
[1:36:08] that must have been here. They were
[1:36:09] direct descendants from Adam. Think of
[1:36:12] all of the oral tradition, all of the
[1:36:14] oral knowledge that Adam must have
[1:36:17] passed on to his lineage all the way
[1:36:19] down to all the different people and the
[1:36:21] secrets and the stories that they would
[1:36:22] have about the angels and the way it was
[1:36:25] in the Garden of Eden and and God's ways
[1:36:27] and and his behaviors, his nature, all
[1:36:30] of the stories that they had. Yet they
[1:36:33] were evil continually in their hearts.
[1:36:36] Yes. And only eight souls were saved
[1:36:39] because only eight people were willing
[1:36:40] to listen to the prophet in that day.
[1:36:43] Eight people. That's it. Out of the
[1:36:45] millions and and millions of people on
[1:36:47] earth. Only eight
[1:36:49] people. My But it didn't matter to Noah
[1:36:55] cuz he was going to go
[1:36:56] anyway. What a beautiful thing. And what
[1:36:59] was it? It was actually the the
[1:37:01] revelation that was in his heart. God
[1:37:02] spoke to him directly. And when that
[1:37:04] happens, brothers and sisters, remember
[1:37:06] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:37:07] forever. I think it's beautiful in this
[1:37:09] message. It would probably be good if
[1:37:11] you get the time just to go and listen
[1:37:12] to it because brother Brandham talks
[1:37:13] about how God speaks to you in your
[1:37:15] heart. He does everyone. Some people
[1:37:17] will say, "No, you can't hear God." You
[1:37:19] know, dismiss that. That's a devil. We
[1:37:21] have to have a personal relationship
[1:37:23] with him. We have got to lay ourselves
[1:37:26] open so we can hear from him. The only
[1:37:28] way that's going to happen is if we're
[1:37:29] willing to tune out the rest of this
[1:37:30] world and give him the opportunity.
[1:37:34] You know, another one that he talks
[1:37:36] about, which is so good, is Moses.
[1:37:39] Moses, this guy was was was born in the
[1:37:44] house of Israel. And we know that the
[1:37:46] king found out, Pharaoh found out, and
[1:37:49] this was the devil's tactic. We've
[1:37:50] talked about this in the past, but the
[1:37:51] devil got in the pharaoh and and heard
[1:37:54] that there was going to be a deliverer
[1:37:56] and and there was a prophecy about this
[1:37:58] supposed to happen. And so what did the
[1:38:00] Pharaoh do? The devil in Pharaoh, he
[1:38:01] said, you know, all the kids that are
[1:38:02] two years and younger younger, all the
[1:38:05] boys, the males, kill them. Take them.
[1:38:08] Go and take them from all the women and
[1:38:10] just feed them to the crocodiles. Slide
[1:38:13] them down a sword. Do whatever you want
[1:38:14] to do. Just kill them. Don't let them
[1:38:16] live. All the babies being ripped from
[1:38:18] their mamas. Can you imagine that? What
[1:38:21] a terrible time. Excuse me. But that's
[1:38:23] the the day in which he lived. And and
[1:38:26] he was born under that. And his mom
[1:38:29] said, "No, I know. I know." Yoshel knew
[1:38:34] this was a different child. He was a
[1:38:36] proper child. And what did she do? She
[1:38:38] built a little basket, weaved a basket,
[1:38:40] pitched it within and without. Sound
[1:38:43] familiar?
[1:38:44] Put it out in the water. It was the
[1:38:46] water that saved him. And when he was
[1:38:49] out on the water, we know the crocodiles
[1:38:50] were eating babies all over the place.
[1:38:52] If you've ever gone fishing and and seen
[1:38:55] how fish operate, if you just take a
[1:38:57] little bit of of bait and you throw it
[1:38:58] out on the water, you want to see if
[1:39:00] there's fish there. You'll see them
[1:39:01] start eating it. The fish will come and
[1:39:03] start eating it. And and if you want to,
[1:39:04] you can throw a lure out and you'll
[1:39:06] catch a fish. It's not legal to do in
[1:39:08] the Bow River. Please don't ever do
[1:39:09] that. Check your fishing regulations
[1:39:11] before you do that. I'm not promoting
[1:39:13] that, but I'm just saying that that's
[1:39:14] what happened. So you can imagine the
[1:39:16] way the crocodiles would have been with
[1:39:18] all the babies and all the things being
[1:39:20] thrown in the river at the
[1:39:22] time. Probably hundreds of babies, maybe
[1:39:25] thousands of them. And here we have this
[1:39:27] one who is a proper child put in this
[1:39:29] little
[1:39:30] ark and slid out on the water. And we
[1:39:33] know brother Bradomy brings such a
[1:39:34] perfect depiction of it. All the other
[1:39:36] babies could be eaten by the crocodiles.
[1:39:39] But the angel of the Lord came and put
[1:39:41] his foot upon that that one basket and
[1:39:44] said, "Not this one. You can have all
[1:39:46] the rest of them, but you cannot touch
[1:39:47] this one. You leave this one alone." And
[1:39:51] isn't it interesting that Pharaoh's
[1:39:52] daughter just happened to be desiring a
[1:39:55] baby of her own and just happened to
[1:39:57] grab this child and just happened to
[1:40:00] meet this baby's sister and just
[1:40:02] happened to find out who the mom was and
[1:40:04] the mom was just given the ability to
[1:40:06] feed the child. We know the supernatural
[1:40:09] hand of God in this story. What a
[1:40:12] tremendous story it is. He comes to the
[1:40:14] place where he's now second in line for
[1:40:17] the throne.
[1:40:20] He's trained up in the ways of of of
[1:40:22] Egypt under Pharaoh. He's raised in the
[1:40:25] house of Pharaoh, eating the best,
[1:40:26] drinking the best, learning the
[1:40:30] best. But something wasn't right. And we
[1:40:34] know that he found out things were
[1:40:35] absolutely wrong. It came to light that
[1:40:38] he was not actually Egyptian, that he
[1:40:41] was Hebrew. And we know that because of
[1:40:43] that, he actually couldn't stand to see
[1:40:45] the Egyptians mistreating his family,
[1:40:49] his kin. And what did he do? He went and
[1:40:51] killed a man, threw him in the sand, and
[1:40:53] and ran away because he knew there was
[1:40:55] going to be a problem over it. He got
[1:40:57] afraid. Killed a man and then split.
[1:40:59] Found himself on the back side of the
[1:41:01] desert for 40 years. It took 40 years to
[1:41:06] get Egypt into him. He was 40 years old
[1:41:09] when he left. And we know that God
[1:41:11] allowed him to spend 40 years in the
[1:41:13] backside of the desert without all of
[1:41:16] the electronic signals, without all of
[1:41:19] the social media influence, without any
[1:41:22] of the friends and family that he once
[1:41:24] knew. He had to go and tend to life in a
[1:41:29] different way, his father-in-law's
[1:41:31] sheep. We know that he wound up getting
[1:41:33] married out there. He found himself on
[1:41:34] the back side of the desert. We know
[1:41:35] that brother Brandham says that we all
[1:41:37] need to have a backside of the desert
[1:41:38] experience, don't we? Why is that?
[1:41:41] Because he found the burning bush. And
[1:41:43] maybe even better yet, that burning bush
[1:41:45] found him.
[1:41:47] But the random talks about it how people
[1:41:48] must have been walking by, they saw the
[1:41:50] burning bush and thought, "Well, that's
[1:41:51] weird. Who cares? Keep going. I've got
[1:41:53] stuff to do. I've got things to do and
[1:41:55] places to go and people to see. There's
[1:41:57] there's appointments. We've got a
[1:41:58] schedule to keep, right?
[1:42:01] But this Moses, there was something in
[1:42:03] him. Something about that fire, that
[1:42:07] tree, something about that flame.
[1:42:10] Something about that is just it's just
[1:42:12] capturing my attention. And we know that
[1:42:14] he turned aside to look at it. And we
[1:42:17] know that as soon as that bush saw that
[1:42:19] he turned aside to look at it, the flame
[1:42:21] in the bush, as soon as God saw that he
[1:42:24] stopped to look at it, what happened? He
[1:42:26] spoke to him. He said,
[1:42:29] "Moses, can you imagine that out of a
[1:42:32] burning bush? Take off your shoes
[1:42:34] because the ground that you're standing
[1:42:36] on is hallowed."
[1:42:38] That that that must have shocked him.
[1:42:41] But he he he obliged. He said, "Hey, I I
[1:42:44] want to see what this is all about." And
[1:42:46] it's interesting because we know that
[1:42:48] through that he was told by God through
[1:42:51] a revelation, I want you to go down and
[1:42:53] take over Egypt. Amen.
[1:42:55] a oneman invasion of Egypt.
[1:43:00] And you got to imagine this guy knew
[1:43:02] about all of their devices. He knew
[1:43:04] about all of their war tactics and
[1:43:06] strategies. He wasn't just going in
[1:43:08] blind like one of us that would go in
[1:43:10] there. We'd say, "Well, they're e
[1:43:11] Egyptians. We don't know their ways of
[1:43:14] war." He knew it all. They knew
[1:43:18] him. Even when he went in there though
[1:43:21] and he even said to them, "How could I
[1:43:23] ever go in there and do anything? Who
[1:43:26] should I say sent me
[1:43:28] even?" And he said, "Tell them I am.
[1:43:32] I am said, let my people go. You just
[1:43:36] follow my instruction and I'll back it
[1:43:39] up."
[1:43:41] Turned into a oneperson invasion of
[1:43:43] Egypt. And we know all of the story. We
[1:43:46] could go on and on about it. And we know
[1:43:48] that he had many signs and wonders.
[1:43:50] There was all of the the plagues the
[1:43:52] that happened and the last plague, the
[1:43:54] final plague was the plague of death,
[1:43:56] the death plague. I can't help but think
[1:43:58] that's where we're at today, brothers
[1:43:59] and sisters, as parents. It it it
[1:44:02] behooves us to make sure that we're
[1:44:04] applying that token to our home, not as
[1:44:06] a tradition, not as a church membership,
[1:44:09] but as a real blood token. I'm not
[1:44:12] saying go and get an animal, but what I
[1:44:14] am saying is get the Holy Ghost for
[1:44:15] yourself and apply that token to your
[1:44:17] home, to your children. Put it on your
[1:44:21] home, your family, the way that we're
[1:44:23] supposed to until the age of
[1:44:25] accountability. You know, another one he
[1:44:27] talks about is David. It's just so
[1:44:29] beautiful. David, the story of David.
[1:44:32] Here he is, a little ruddy fella, just a
[1:44:36] sheep herder out minding his own
[1:44:39] father's business, outing sheep. not
[1:44:42] doing anything. We know that there was
[1:44:44] the cry in the heart of the children for
[1:44:46] a a king to happen and and in the land
[1:44:49] of Israel and and God said, you know,
[1:44:52] why do you need a king? Like you you got
[1:44:54] me, don't you? And they said, yeah, we
[1:44:57] know we we we we know that you're the
[1:44:59] same yesterday, today, forever, but you
[1:45:01] know, we're just looking around at all
[1:45:02] the other people and we just want to be
[1:45:03] like them. You know, we need to be
[1:45:06] careful what we look at. We need to be
[1:45:08] careful who we look at. We need to be
[1:45:11] very careful at the influence in our
[1:45:13] lives because it will draw our
[1:45:16] attention. And the children of Israel
[1:45:17] desired to be like the enemies of the
[1:45:20] land. Isn't that such a strange thing?
[1:45:23] We want a king like the Philistines.
[1:45:24] They're enemies. God said, "You know
[1:45:27] what? I'll do it. I'll give you a king
[1:45:28] if that's what you really want. But he's
[1:45:30] going to tax you. He's going to take
[1:45:32] your children and enslave them. They're
[1:45:34] going to go and work for them. They're
[1:45:35] going to have to go into the army. It's
[1:45:37] going to change. Everything around here
[1:45:38] is going to change. But if that's the
[1:45:39] way you want it, hey, God bless you. You
[1:45:42] can have it. And what did he do? He gave
[1:45:43] them Saul. He was head and shoulders
[1:45:46] above everyone else. Saul was really
[1:45:49] really stunningly handsome. He was he
[1:45:53] was a great guy. He was all around
[1:45:55] great. But what happened? He served the
[1:45:57] Lord in a great capacity. Must have been
[1:45:59] a wonderful time to see Saul rise up, to
[1:46:01] see the king, the one that God chose,
[1:46:03] right?
[1:46:04] But what happened was it got a little
[1:46:07] bit puffy in his life, in his mind. He
[1:46:10] got a little bit too big for his
[1:46:11] britches as it were. He wasn't willing
[1:46:13] to wait upon the Lord anymore. And we
[1:46:15] know there came a time where he decided,
[1:46:17] I'm just going to go and do a sacrifice
[1:46:18] myself. You know that prophet, he's
[1:46:20] always late. He always makes us wait.
[1:46:22] We're always wondering what's going on.
[1:46:24] We can never predict anything with that
[1:46:26] guy. So, we're just going to get it
[1:46:28] done. We're just going to be on time
[1:46:30] today. We're going to get it done and be
[1:46:31] on time. we're going to just go and do a
[1:46:33] sacrifice. And we know that while he was
[1:46:35] in the midst of a sacrifice, the prophet
[1:46:37] came and said to him, "What on earth are
[1:46:38] you doing? You know what? You're you're
[1:46:40] actually just being disobedient all over
[1:46:43] the place. God told you not to spare
[1:46:46] anything from the enemy, but yet you've
[1:46:49] taken the best of the cows. And what's
[1:46:50] this king here?" He grabbed the spear
[1:46:53] and thrust him through. Killed the king.
[1:46:55] The prophet had to do it. And he told
[1:46:57] David, "You know what,
[1:46:58] David? God's done with you. Saul, sorry.
[1:47:03] Saul, God's done with you. He's over
[1:47:06] you. You have disobeyed him for the last
[1:47:09] time and your kingdom is now rent from
[1:47:12] you. And we know what happened. Prophet
[1:47:15] turned to walk away and Saul started
[1:47:18] sobbing and
[1:47:19] begging. But you can't change God's
[1:47:21] mind.
[1:47:23] He gives us opportunities and we have
[1:47:25] the opportunity to serve him. And you
[1:47:27] know there's a shelf life. Brother
[1:47:30] Brandham says it that we can cross a
[1:47:32] line where there's no coming back. And I
[1:47:35] pray that we would never cross that
[1:47:37] line. That we would always stay away
[1:47:39] from the edge, not see how close to the
[1:47:41] edge we can
[1:47:43] get. But this Saul, he had his kingdom
[1:47:46] rent from him. And we know that the
[1:47:48] prophet said, "I don't know what's going
[1:47:50] to happen." And God said, "I do. I want
[1:47:52] you to go to the house of Jesse and I
[1:47:55] want you to anoint his kid, his son,
[1:47:58] king over Israel. And so he goes into
[1:48:02] the town. We know he goes in there and
[1:48:04] he says, "Where's your sons? Line them
[1:48:05] up." And he does. And he says, "Nope,
[1:48:09] none of these." And we know they were
[1:48:11] fine men. They were gentlemen. They were
[1:48:13] raised up. They were probably educated.
[1:48:15] They were smart guys. But what happened?
[1:48:18] There was one that wasn't there. And
[1:48:21] that one was busy dealing with his
[1:48:22] daddy's business, wasn't he? He was out
[1:48:24] being obedient to his father's will. He
[1:48:27] was out tending the sheep. While he was
[1:48:30] out tending the sheep, the prophet of
[1:48:32] God was looking for him. He didn't
[1:48:35] realize that that's who he was looking
[1:48:37] for. But he said to Jesse, "Ain't you
[1:48:39] got another one? Isn't there another
[1:48:40] one? Haven't you got another one? One
[1:48:43] more? There must be another one." So he
[1:48:45] went and he sent for him and he came and
[1:48:48] he said, "Yep, that's the one." And
[1:48:50] everyone was like, "No way. Can't be
[1:48:52] this ruddy little guy. This is just a
[1:48:55] little sheep herder." And you know, the
[1:49:00] prophet, he was God's eyes and ears and
[1:49:03] his mouth. And I think it's beautiful
[1:49:06] because the prophet, he was looking at
[1:49:08] the men from the heart, wasn't he? Just
[1:49:11] the way that God looks at us. Just the
[1:49:14] way that God looks at men. Men look at
[1:49:16] men and women outwardly. God looks
[1:49:19] inwardly. What's going on inside the
[1:49:22] heart? And anyways, God was able to say,
[1:49:25] "Hey, that's the
[1:49:28] guy." We know the rest of that story.
[1:49:30] There was a a long period of time where
[1:49:32] he was banished. Saul was still alive.
[1:49:34] Saul went mad. There was all kinds of
[1:49:37] different things that happened in the
[1:49:39] kingdom. But we know that David was
[1:49:41] already anointed king. There was no
[1:49:43] turning back from that. The prophet of
[1:49:45] God anointed him, said that you are king
[1:49:47] over Israel, even though all of the
[1:49:49] natural circumstances didn't line up.
[1:49:52] And I can't help but think, you know,
[1:49:54] brothers and sisters, how is it in the
[1:49:56] day in which we live, God says that
[1:49:57] we're sons and daughters of God, we're
[1:49:59] already seated in heavenly places, but
[1:50:01] here we find ourselves seated at Calgary
[1:50:02] Living Word
[1:50:04] Assembly on this little corner here in
[1:50:06] Calgary. How can we be seated in
[1:50:08] heavenly places? His word says so. And
[1:50:10] we know that his word said so about
[1:50:13] David as well. And all David did was
[1:50:16] just carry on, carry on. He didn't
[1:50:19] change anything. All he did was continue
[1:50:21] to to worship. We know that even while
[1:50:24] Saul was actually going mad before he
[1:50:27] really got after David, David cast out
[1:50:30] devils from Saul by worship, by playing
[1:50:34] music.
[1:50:36] Such a beautiful component, such an
[1:50:37] important part of our lives to be able
[1:50:40] to worship. But you know, David in this
[1:50:43] circumstance knowing that people were
[1:50:46] looking outwardly, but God was looking
[1:50:48] inward. God must have spoken to David.
[1:50:51] God had a personal relationship with
[1:50:53] David where David knew his God. He
[1:50:56] didn't care about what all the other
[1:50:58] people were thinking. He didn't care
[1:50:59] what they were saying. He knew that God
[1:51:01] dealt with him and and God even
[1:51:03] vindicated it with a
[1:51:07] prophet. We know there came a time where
[1:51:10] David was told by his dad, "Go see your
[1:51:15] brother, your brothers out in the
[1:51:17] battlefield. Take them a little
[1:51:19] sustenance and bring me report." This is
[1:51:23] what Jesse said. I want to see how
[1:51:24] they're doing. Give me give me some
[1:51:26] words on what's going on in the battle
[1:51:28] lines. and and he went out there again
[1:51:31] just doing his dad's will, following his
[1:51:33] father's business, being about his his
[1:51:36] his his father's
[1:51:39] business. He gets out to the battlefield
[1:51:41] and and all the brethren are up there on
[1:51:43] the hill and one side of the valley and
[1:51:46] the Philistines are up on the other side
[1:51:48] of the valley. And here we have down in
[1:51:50] the bottom the scene that David's seeing
[1:51:53] this giant boasting, boasting and
[1:51:56] boasting. Come on out, send me a
[1:51:57] champion. And we know the story very
[1:51:59] well. It's such a good story though
[1:52:02] because David, he knew something in his
[1:52:05] heart that nobody else knew.
[1:52:09] And when God gives us something, nobody
[1:52:11] can take it away from us. I think it's
[1:52:13] such an amazing thing. Brothers and
[1:52:14] sisters, if God has given us something,
[1:52:17] let's not discount it. Let's make sure
[1:52:20] that it lines up with the word. It will
[1:52:22] always line up with the word. It won't
[1:52:24] be contrary to God's word. Many times
[1:52:26] we'll have times in our life where we'll
[1:52:28] say, "God gave me this." But if it
[1:52:29] doesn't line up with the word, we just
[1:52:31] have to let it go. We have to be willing
[1:52:33] to do that. And I believe any true
[1:52:35] believer will. It's not something we
[1:52:38] even need to say. But you know, man, he
[1:52:41] looks outwardly. God looks
[1:52:44] inwardly. David is given the
[1:52:46] instructions to go give the report.
[1:52:48] Goliath down in the bottom boasting.
[1:52:50] And brother Bradam says it in this
[1:52:52] message that Satan will always boast
[1:52:54] when it looks like he's got the upper
[1:52:56] hand. He'll always be boasting when it
[1:52:58] looks like he's got the upper hand. And
[1:53:01] you know, I think that in the heart of
[1:53:03] every single one of God's true believing
[1:53:06] children, there's a little portion of
[1:53:08] David.
[1:53:10] There's a little portion of that person
[1:53:12] that just doesn't care what anybody
[1:53:14] thinks, doesn't care what anybody
[1:53:16] says, and they say, "I know my redeemer
[1:53:20] lives. I know that he is the same
[1:53:22] yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:53:25] But
[1:53:27] how? It's through all of our experience.
[1:53:30] We know that experience works patience
[1:53:34] in the lives of the believers. Because
[1:53:37] we have experience, we can say, "I know
[1:53:40] that God will come on the scene. I just
[1:53:42] need to hold still. I just need to hang
[1:53:44] tight. I need to surrender my will unto
[1:53:47] him and allow him to come on the scene
[1:53:49] and work it out, not try and figure it
[1:53:51] out on my own." But it's our experience
[1:53:55] that gives us the ability to deal with
[1:53:58] the boasting of the devil. Because David
[1:54:00] in that situation, what did he do? All
[1:54:02] the brethren were were like, "There he
[1:54:04] is. There he is. We need to be quiet.
[1:54:05] Don't Don't get him upset. He could come
[1:54:07] and get us. And David said, "You mean to
[1:54:10] tell me you're going to let this
[1:54:11] uncircumcised Philistine, the enemy,
[1:54:14] boast down there in our land? You're
[1:54:16] going to let him do that against the
[1:54:18] armies of the living God? This is the
[1:54:20] living God army up here. We have every
[1:54:23] single right to every single place in
[1:54:25] this land." Joshua was told, "Everywhere
[1:54:27] the soul of your foot treads is your
[1:54:29] possession." They're treading on our
[1:54:31] land. They're trespassing. They've got
[1:54:33] no
[1:54:35] right. But nobody had the revelation
[1:54:37] David had.
[1:54:39] David said, "You know what? I'll go take
[1:54:41] him." And they all said, "No, no, no,
[1:54:43] no, no." They're looking outwardly. No,
[1:54:45] no, no, no, no. You're you're you're
[1:54:47] you're just a ruddy little fella. How
[1:54:49] could you ever do that? And they said,
[1:54:51] "You know, this guy, we can't talk him
[1:54:53] out of it. We better tell the king.
[1:54:54] Quickly tell the king. Maybe the king
[1:54:55] can talk him out of it." So, he winds up
[1:54:57] going and talking to Saul. And Saul says
[1:54:59] to him, you know that he's a warrior
[1:55:01] from his youth and you are just a youth.
[1:55:04] What do you think that you can bring to
[1:55:05] this? And he said, 'Hey, I don't I don't
[1:55:07] know what to tell
[1:55:09] you except for my experience.
[1:55:12] There was a time where I was out hurting
[1:55:14] my father's sheep. I was about my
[1:55:16] father's
[1:55:17] business and and a bear came in and
[1:55:21] tried to steal one of the sheep. And
[1:55:24] what did he say? I slew that bear. Amen.
[1:55:28] I went and I actually slew that bear and
[1:55:30] I took that sheep back. That was my
[1:55:32] father's sheep. I wasn't willing to let
[1:55:34] that devil come and take that sheep. And
[1:55:36] he said, "Furthermore, there was a time
[1:55:38] where a lion came in and actually tried
[1:55:41] to take a sheep and I rose up against
[1:55:43] that lion and that lion tried to rise up
[1:55:45] against
[1:55:46] me. And what did he say? I grabbed him
[1:55:49] by the beard and I slew that lion.
[1:55:52] And you know, I can go and take this
[1:55:55] giant. I don't need to worry about all
[1:55:57] the stuff that you've got going on.
[1:55:59] You're all looking outward, but I'm
[1:56:01] looking inward by the spirit that's
[1:56:03] inside of me. And Saul said, "No, no,
[1:56:05] no, no, no. You you need to take my
[1:56:06] armor. Take my armor. Put on my armor,
[1:56:08] my vest, but take my sword and my
[1:56:10] shield. Don't go out there unprotected
[1:56:12] at least. Just just allow us to help you
[1:56:14] this much." And he said, "You know, I
[1:56:16] just can't manage that stuff." And we
[1:56:18] know, Brother Bradam talks about it
[1:56:19] being a religion. take the the
[1:56:22] certificate, the degree,
[1:56:25] the LLD or the maybe the Bible college
[1:56:28] degree. You know, the worst thing that
[1:56:29] we could ever do is try and mix a Bible
[1:56:31] college degree with this message of the
[1:56:32] hour. The worst thing that we could ever
[1:56:35] do is try and mix education, higher
[1:56:37] education with this message of the hour.
[1:56:40] It's okay to be educated, but as soon as
[1:56:42] that education starts to actually bump
[1:56:44] against faith in this word for our day,
[1:56:48] that's where we need to draw the line.
[1:56:50] But many times we can take it and try
[1:56:52] and mix it and cause a hybrid religion.
[1:56:55] We don't want to do that. David said,
[1:56:57] you know, I can't explain any of it. I
[1:56:59] don't understand any of these war
[1:57:00] tactics. Alls I know is that the living
[1:57:03] God is with us right here. And I know
[1:57:05] the promise. That guy cannot stand
[1:57:07] against the living God. And by the way,
[1:57:09] I've got five smooth stones in my
[1:57:11] script. And we could go on and on about
[1:57:14] that, but I just want to say it this
[1:57:15] way. He only needed one stone.
[1:57:19] He didn't need a sword. He didn't need a
[1:57:20] shield. When David got down there, we
[1:57:23] know that Goliath said, "I'll put you on
[1:57:24] the end of the spear and feed you to the
[1:57:26] birds. You know, you I've been crying
[1:57:27] for you to send me a champion and you
[1:57:29] send me a ruddy little boy." What do you
[1:57:32] guys think this is? And he just mocked
[1:57:34] him incessantly. And we know that David
[1:57:37] said, "Hey, today I'm going to cut your
[1:57:40] head off."
[1:57:42] And he did, didn't he? And he didn't cut
[1:57:44] his head off with his own sword. He
[1:57:46] didn't cut his head off with his own
[1:57:47] sling. He cut his head off with the the
[1:57:50] giant's own sword. He took Goliath's own
[1:57:54] sword and cut off his head. And we know
[1:57:56] that changed everything for Saul and and
[1:57:57] and and David. I don't want to get into
[1:57:59] that too much, but I just want to say
[1:58:01] this, brothers and sisters. Isn't it
[1:58:02] interesting? He had a revelation. Why'd
[1:58:03] you pick up five stones?
[1:58:06] Because Goliath had four brothers.
[1:58:08] There was five giants.
[1:58:11] He had a revelation. There was something
[1:58:14] inside of him that knew. But it's only
[1:58:16] going to take one stone because I'm just
[1:58:19] going to go and get in position. And I'm
[1:58:20] going to trust that I'm going to do what
[1:58:22] I just know how to do. And I'm going to
[1:58:25] let God do the rest. And that's what I
[1:58:27] do every time I come to this pulpit.
[1:58:29] Brothers and sisters, I don't know what
[1:58:30] I'm going to do. I just want God to do
[1:58:32] it. And I know that's what the musicians
[1:58:34] do. I don't know what I'm going to do. I
[1:58:35] just know how to play the piano. I just
[1:58:37] know how to play the guitar. I just know
[1:58:38] how to play the violin or the viola or
[1:58:41] the organ. But I'm going to let God do
[1:58:43] it. It's got to be God that does it. If
[1:58:46] we try and do a perfect program, we're
[1:58:48] going to squash the spirit of God out of
[1:58:51] our church. But if we can just get
[1:58:54] ourselves in a position like David, what
[1:58:56] we'll do is kill giants.
[1:58:59] And I think it's so beautiful because we
[1:59:01] could kill giants before a word is
[1:59:02] spoken from the pulpit. Brothers and
[1:59:04] sisters,
[1:59:06] just in a worship service,
[1:59:08] cancer can be killed.
[1:59:12] Amen.
[1:59:14] Just in a worship service, marriages can
[1:59:16] be healed.
[1:59:19] Just in a worship service, hearts can be
[1:59:22] forgiven. Amen. Hallelujah. What a bonus
[1:59:26] it is to get the word of God afterwards.
[1:59:28] My So, you know, brothers and
[1:59:31] sisters, alls we need to do is trust the
[1:59:34] Lord. Amen. Another one he talks about
[1:59:36] quickly, we're running out of time here.
[1:59:38] My goodness. Samson. Samson had a
[1:59:41] revelation from God. He had a revelation
[1:59:43] about the Nazerite vow because his
[1:59:44] parents taught him that way, right? He
[1:59:47] understood that he had a vow and as long
[1:59:49] as he could reach around and feel those
[1:59:50] locks, look
[1:59:52] out because nobody could stand in his
[1:59:55] way. This is the guy that would tear off
[1:59:58] the gate of the city and run to the top
[2:00:01] of the hill with it. Right now, many
[2:00:05] times, I love how Brother Bradom brings
[2:00:07] this out. Many times we look at that
[2:00:08] story and think that, you know, he must
[2:00:11] have been a really big man. Brother
[2:00:13] Brham says that he was mama's little
[2:00:15] shrimp. Amen. He was a little boy.
[2:00:19] But he could tear the gates off of a
[2:00:22] city and run to the top of the hill with
[2:00:23] them. What a tremendous thing. He had a
[2:00:26] Nazerite vow. His parents taught him
[2:00:28] that. And I just hope that this morning,
[2:00:31] brothers and sisters, somewhere along
[2:00:33] the way, we could just look around in
[2:00:35] our life and find that vow for
[2:00:37] ourselves. Amen. When the devil comes
[2:00:40] around, not if he does, when he does,
[2:00:44] we can look around in our life and see
[2:00:46] that vow in our life. We can point to
[2:00:48] that time in our life. Brother Brandham
[2:00:50] preaches a message from that
[2:00:53] time. There's always a time in our life.
[2:00:56] And it's a time where we can recognize
[2:00:58] that from that time everything changed
[2:01:00] in my life for the better or from that
[2:01:03] time everything changed in my life for
[2:01:05] the worse. Amen. There comes a time
[2:01:08] where we're going to make
[2:01:10] decisions and we get to choose. Thank
[2:01:12] you. Amen, brother Brandham. He says in
[2:01:14] this message, he says, "How much ought
[2:01:16] the church tonight that claims that you
[2:01:19] are born of the spirit of God standing
[2:01:21] in the meeting and see the vindication
[2:01:23] of the resurrected Jesus Christ and
[2:01:25] claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:01:28] and could sit still and let Satan push
[2:01:30] you around like he does." I trust that
[2:01:33] nobody here ever gets pushed around by
[2:01:36] Satan. The reason why I'm reading it
[2:01:38] today is because I've been pushed around
[2:01:39] by Satan.
[2:01:41] I've been slapped around by him and then
[2:01:43] I think, "Oh, yeah, I should pray." I'm
[2:01:45] just human, brothers and sisters.
[2:01:48] There's times where I get mad. There's
[2:01:49] times where I get sad. There's times
[2:01:52] where we deal with things as a human
[2:01:54] being. Let's not let Satan push us
[2:02:00] around. He says, "It's a strange thing.
[2:02:02] As long as you can feel the presence of
[2:02:04] the Holy
[2:02:06] Ghost, know that it's his word and his
[2:02:09] promise for this day, you should be
[2:02:12] persistent to press in until it's over.
[2:02:17] Perseverant. Stay with it. God promised
[2:02:22] it. It's not you, it's God. Amen. So
[2:02:26] many times in our lives, I think that's
[2:02:28] probably the the mistake is it's
[2:02:32] us. We try and do it. So many times as
[2:02:36] parents, we try and do it. Well, I've
[2:02:40] got to be the Holy Ghost for my
[2:02:41] children. We
[2:02:43] do. But what does the Holy Ghost do?
[2:02:45] Does he come around and actually grab us
[2:02:47] and shake us and and push us around and
[2:02:50] and hurt us and and and corral us?
[2:02:54] No, he doesn't do that. He speaks to us
[2:02:57] and says, "I wouldn't do that. I
[2:02:59] wouldn't do that. If you do that, it's
[2:03:01] not going to turn out right. Please
[2:03:03] don't do that." And we have the ability
[2:03:05] to do that to our children, to encourage
[2:03:07] them, to train them up in the way they
[2:03:09] should go, not shake them up and make
[2:03:12] them afraid of us.
[2:03:15] Brother Bradam says in persevering and
[2:03:17] just as soon as that human name of God
[2:03:20] Jesus was spoke by a mortal lip. I think
[2:03:25] this is so beautiful this story. Another
[2:03:28] story of Jesus being born. The angel of
[2:03:32] the Lord coming unto Mary as soon as the
[2:03:36] name of Jesus was spoke by a mortal lip
[2:03:39] out of a human being.
[2:03:42] Mary got a revelation from the angel and
[2:03:45] nothing was going to stop her from
[2:03:46] seeing that come to pass. The only thing
[2:03:48] she did was say, "Be it unto me
[2:03:50] according to thy word. Just let it
[2:03:51] happen the way that you've said it. I
[2:03:53] accept it the way that you brought it. I
[2:03:55] don't want to try and make it something
[2:03:57] different." When that
[2:03:59] name of
[2:04:01] God, Jesus, was spoke by a mortal lip
[2:04:04] out of a human being, a dead baby come
[2:04:06] to life in the womb of a woman. And we
[2:04:08] know that was in Elizabeth. That was
[2:04:09] John the Baptist. and receive the Holy
[2:04:13] Ghost. I just think this is beautiful.
[2:04:15] And if it will do that to a baby dead in
[2:04:17] the mother's womb, what ought it to do
[2:04:20] to the bornagain church? The first time
[2:04:23] the name of Jesus Christ was ever spoke
[2:04:25] by a mortal lip. A baby dead in its
[2:04:27] mother's womb came to life and received
[2:04:28] the Holy Ghost. Whence cometh the mother
[2:04:30] of my Lord, said Elizabeth. For as soon
[2:04:33] as your salutation came in my ears, my
[2:04:35] baby leapt for for in the womb for joy.
[2:04:38] And today we claim to have the Holy
[2:04:39] Ghost and cowardly with it, afraid to
[2:04:42] move out. We've got to be persistent. If
[2:04:45] we got the real genuine Holy Spirit, we
[2:04:48] will be persistent.
[2:04:53] I think it's so good, brothers and
[2:04:55] sisters. My desire today is to encourage
[2:04:58] us to be perseverant,
[2:05:00] to be resilient, to be
[2:05:04] persistent, not willing to just settle
[2:05:07] for mediocrity, to say that, well, I
[2:05:10] prayed and nothing happened before, so
[2:05:12] what's the point in praying and you
[2:05:14] know, everything is just the same since
[2:05:17] the fathers fell asleep. It's not the
[2:05:19] same.
[2:05:21] The world is actually in a in a state of
[2:05:24] confusion right now. It's never been so
[2:05:27] dark. And here we
[2:05:30] are. We can look around and say the
[2:05:32] world is so dark and so evil and so
[2:05:34] terrible. But as all of that happens,
[2:05:38] the bride of Jesus Christ is getting
[2:05:40] brighter and stronger
[2:05:44] and greater in
[2:05:45] stature, not succumbing to the the the
[2:05:49] whelming flood of the enemy because the
[2:05:51] word of God says that when the enemy
[2:05:53] comes in like a flood, which he is, the
[2:05:56] spirit of God raises a standard against
[2:05:58] that flood. And that standard that he's
[2:06:00] raising is believers of this word. Real
[2:06:04] believers that are spiritfilled, not
[2:06:07] interested in being shaken to one side
[2:06:09] or the other. I don't care what what
[2:06:11] brother so and so said. I don't care
[2:06:12] what sister so and so said. I I don't
[2:06:15] care what they did or they didn't. It
[2:06:17] doesn't matter to me what's going on in
[2:06:18] their churches. It doesn't matter about
[2:06:20] anything what's going on even here in
[2:06:22] this church. I'm here for one purpose
[2:06:24] and that is to meet with the living God.
[2:06:27] Hallelujah. And when we come with that
[2:06:29] in our hearts, brothers and sisters, we
[2:06:31] will see God move in our midst. And I'm
[2:06:35] not preaching a a a signs and wonders
[2:06:37] ministry. I'm just saying, let's let's
[2:06:39] live under the maximum potential of the
[2:06:41] blessing of God in our lives. The
[2:06:44] prophet of God said in the day in which
[2:06:46] he lived, he said, you know, we live a
[2:06:48] thousand times below our privilege.
[2:06:50] Where are we living today? Are we caught
[2:06:53] up in this world? Are we caught up with
[2:06:54] upsets and downsets and insetss and
[2:06:57] outsets, all these different things in
[2:06:59] life? Or are we just steady as she goes,
[2:07:02] trust in the Lord with all of our
[2:07:03] hearts, leaning not not to our own
[2:07:06] understanding, looking at things
[2:07:07] outwardly
[2:07:10] in all our ways, acknowledging him.
[2:07:12] Amen. He'll be directing our path out of
[2:07:16] perseverance. Brother Bradom, he says,
[2:07:17] "And just as soon as that human name of
[2:07:19] God, Jesus was sp Oh, sorry, I uh
[2:07:22] doubled up there. forgive me. You know,
[2:07:25] getting back to our scripture today, I
[2:07:27] can see that we got 10 minutes
[2:07:28] here. This woman that we're talking of,
[2:07:32] this Syrphenician woman, she was a Greek
[2:07:35] and she had heard about Jesus. And you
[2:07:40] know, she had faith, didn't she?
[2:07:44] Something constrained her to go and
[2:07:46] fight her way through, to go and
[2:07:49] embarrass herself from all of her peers.
[2:07:53] They were probably saying to her,
[2:07:54] "You're going to go and get all mixed up
[2:07:57] with those holy rollers down there, all
[2:07:59] those Jews. Why would you bother going
[2:08:03] down there?" But something happened in
[2:08:05] her. She had faith. And you know, faith
[2:08:08] cometh by hearing hearing the word of
[2:08:11] God. And somewhere along the way, she
[2:08:14] had heard. And because of that, she had
[2:08:17] something that rose up inside her heart.
[2:08:19] And it caused her to act. She did not
[2:08:22] sit still. I think it's so beautiful.
[2:08:25] Somehow faith finds a source that others
[2:08:30] don't see. Faith, it's the substance of
[2:08:34] things hoped for.
[2:08:36] But the evidence of things not seen. We
[2:08:40] know through faith the worlds were
[2:08:43] formed. We could we could go on and on
[2:08:46] talking about it. It's Hebrews chapter
[2:08:47] 11, the faith chapter. But you know,
[2:08:49] brothers and sisters, I just can't help
[2:08:51] but think about this woman here. This
[2:08:53] woman, she worshiped God. Jesus in flesh
[2:08:59] told her, "You know what? It's not meat
[2:09:01] to give this bread, this this life that
[2:09:04] I've got, the words that I have to offer
[2:09:07] to preach to the dogs of the Gentiles. I
[2:09:11] won't even do it." And what did she do?
[2:09:14] She didn't let that deter her at
[2:09:16] all. She worshiped. And I just can't say
[2:09:19] it enough. Brothers and sisters, don't
[2:09:21] ever underestimate the power of worship
[2:09:25] because the worship I believe is what
[2:09:28] changed Jesus' direction here. She
[2:09:32] answered him. He said after she
[2:09:34] worshiped, but he answered and said,
[2:09:36] "It's not me to take the children's
[2:09:37] bread and cast it to dogs." Just totally
[2:09:39] insulted her. And we know brother
[2:09:42] Brandham, he says it. I'll just say it
[2:09:45] here in paragraph 109 of Perseverance.
[2:09:48] She had broke through all these gates,
[2:09:49] all these critics and all the laughats
[2:09:52] and all the your husband will put you
[2:09:55] away. Your fellowship card is gone from
[2:09:59] the church. You'll have to find
[2:10:01] something else. You'll be cast away.
[2:10:03] You'll be called a holy roller. That
[2:10:05] didn't mean a thing to her because she
[2:10:08] had already seen God.
[2:10:11] She had heard. And faith cometh by
[2:10:14] hearing. and she knew that others had
[2:10:17] been healed. Why couldn't her daughter
[2:10:20] be healed? There you are. She comes
[2:10:24] through. Brothers and sisters, if we got
[2:10:26] a need in our heart, don't think for a
[2:10:28] second that it's just a tradition to
[2:10:30] raise our hand and say, you know, I I I
[2:10:32] have a need. And when the the the person
[2:10:35] says, anybody with a need, raise your
[2:10:37] hand unto him, don't think it's just a
[2:10:38] formal tradition. We're speaking to the
[2:10:41] living God. He sees us defy gravity. He
[2:10:44] sees us shaking off those devils and
[2:10:46] saying, "Yes, indeed. I've got no pride.
[2:10:48] I've got a need in my heart, Lord, and I
[2:10:50] trust that you're able to meet that
[2:10:52] need."
[2:10:55] I think one of the best things that we
[2:10:56] can ever have is a testimony service
[2:10:58] because we can hear about what God's
[2:11:00] doing in people's lives. When we can
[2:11:02] hear that God did that for that person
[2:11:04] and met that person on those grounds, we
[2:11:06] know that if we meet God on those same
[2:11:08] grounds, he will meet that need in our
[2:11:10] life. Yes,
[2:11:12] he is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:11:14] forever. Out of perseverance, he says
[2:11:16] finally she arrives at the feet of
[2:11:18] Jesus. And notice what a shock many
[2:11:20] people think because they can get there.
[2:11:23] They can get all the way through to
[2:11:25] Jesus. Maybe in a prayer meeting, maybe
[2:11:27] in a service, they can get all the way
[2:11:29] to Jesus. They get there, that's all
[2:11:31] there is to it. He says, "But you've
[2:11:34] just started now.
[2:11:37] You got to Jesus. You just started now.
[2:11:41] When she got to Jesus, what a
[2:11:42] disappointment to her or it would have
[2:11:45] been maybe to us in this day. Jesus said
[2:11:48] he wasn't even sent to
[2:11:50] erase. My
[2:11:53] goodness. Just go and cry out with all
[2:11:56] of its might and say, "Lord, I need a
[2:11:59] touch from you. Lord, my daughter needs
[2:12:01] a touch from you. Lord, my marriage
[2:12:03] needs a touch from you. Lord, my church
[2:12:05] needs a touch from you. Maybe Lord, I
[2:12:08] can't stand to hear that kind of
[2:12:09] preaching anymore. I need something
[2:12:12] deep. Maybe if you want more from God,
[2:12:15] there's more to be had. Just cry out to
[2:12:18] him. 1964 and persevering. He goes on to
[2:12:22] say, "Now here, some time ago, I just
[2:12:24] remembered at the tabernacle, I see some
[2:12:26] of the brethren sitting here from the
[2:12:27] tabernacle tonight, there was a lady I
[2:12:30] had come into the church. We have about
[2:12:32] every night. What we got in here is our
[2:12:34] meeting." And so then I I was praying
[2:12:36] for the sick that night and there had
[2:12:39] been a woman come and there had been a
[2:12:40] woman come from California had a tumor.
[2:12:43] The tumor itself weighed 50bs.
[2:12:48] Can you imagine
[2:12:50] that? Packing around a 50 lb tumor.
[2:12:56] So they had had her in the
[2:12:59] back. So they told he wasn't praying for
[2:13:01] the sick that night. Can you imagine how
[2:13:03] disappointing that must have been for
[2:13:05] her? Traveled all that
[2:13:07] way, carried all that weight, so much
[2:13:11] anticipation to find out they weren't
[2:13:12] praying for the sick that night.
[2:13:15] My it was just coming down to speak
[2:13:20] because I just come from a meeting and
[2:13:22] when I went out the back door two of the
[2:13:24] deacons had drawn her around the house
[2:13:27] in a chair and sat her at the
[2:13:29] door pushed through right and right on
[2:13:34] the ground. And when I come out she
[2:13:36] caught me by the trouser leg when I went
[2:13:39] out. She said, "Brother Brandom, the
[2:13:41] only thing I ask you is lay your hands
[2:13:43] on me." She said, "My tumor will go."
[2:13:47] And she was just about like this. About
[2:13:49] 6 weeks from then, she was in a meeting.
[2:13:51] And I took the sisters to go in and
[2:13:53] examine her. Without any operation,
[2:13:56] there wasn't a speck of the tumor
[2:13:58] nowhere.
[2:14:00] No matter if it wasn't the night to pray
[2:14:03] for the
[2:14:04] sick, she was perseverant.
[2:14:08] She got what she asked for. Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] faith found its place and had a hold.
[2:14:15] I'll call the musicians this
[2:14:18] morning. I just want to say, brothers
[2:14:20] and sisters, be perseverant. Amen. Amen.
[2:14:24] Don't be willing to just give up. Don't
[2:14:27] be willing to say, "It must be this
[2:14:29] way." Don't be willing to say, "I prayed
[2:14:31] and I prayed and God never answered it."
[2:14:33] You know, he's going to answer every
[2:14:35] single time we pray. He might not answer
[2:14:37] the way we want him to, but we need to
[2:14:40] be able to say, "Be it unto me, Lord,
[2:14:42] according to thy will." If that's the
[2:14:44] way you want to answer it, then I accept
[2:14:47] it that way. But if you don't want it
[2:14:50] that way, Lord, then I know you won't
[2:14:52] allow it to stay this way.
[2:14:57] That's the God we serve. We know that he
[2:14:59] is more than able to meet every single
[2:15:02] one of our needs. Maybe stand with me as
[2:15:04] we close.
[2:15:06] this
[2:15:10] morning. Let's just bow in
[2:15:13] prayer. Heavenly Father,
[2:15:17] Lord, thank you for your word. Lord,
[2:15:20] thank you for the story of this
[2:15:21] Cyranician woman.
[2:15:24] Lord, all she must have gone through to
[2:15:28] fight her way to come to you, the
[2:15:31] master.
[2:15:33] all of the doubters, all of the
[2:15:36] people saying
[2:15:38] that it won't work out the way that she
[2:15:41] thinks it
[2:15:42] will. Father, I pray that we would just
[2:15:44] be able to have a personal revelation
[2:15:46] with you and just trust that you would
[2:15:49] lead us and guide us, Lord. That you
[2:15:52] would not lead us
[2:15:54] astray. Father, we're so thankful that
[2:15:56] you have given us your will. We know
[2:15:59] many times when people are going to pass
[2:16:02] away, they write a last will and
[2:16:04] testament and that their wishes would be
[2:16:07] carried out. And we know that's what
[2:16:09] you've done with your
[2:16:11] Bible. Only you're not dead. And you
[2:16:14] have given us your will. And it's up to
[2:16:16] us to read it and accept it the way that
[2:16:18] you've given it to us and to say thank
[2:16:21] you for the riches that you have given
[2:16:24] us in Christ Jesus.
[2:16:27] Lord Jesus, this morning I pray that
[2:16:29] Father, if there's anybody that has a
[2:16:31] need that maybe they haven't seen met
[2:16:34] before in their life, if anybody doesn't
[2:16:36] know you in the excuse me, the power of
[2:16:39] your
[2:16:40] resurrection, Father, I pray that you
[2:16:42] would just reveal yourself.
[2:16:44] If anybody needs to have another touch
[2:16:47] from you because maybe our experience
[2:16:50] has grown cold, Father, I pray that you
[2:16:52] would light that fire once again, Lord
[2:16:55] Jesus. Father, oh Lord, we all need to
[2:16:59] have a little more of you. Father, we
[2:17:01] know there was only one difference
[2:17:03] between the the five foolish and the
[2:17:05] five wise virgins. They the only
[2:17:07] difference was five of them had oil in
[2:17:10] their vessels. Lord, help us to have oil
[2:17:13] in our vessels. Lord Jesus, oh Father,
[2:17:16] more of you and less of
[2:17:18] us. We know that you're more than able
[2:17:21] to meet the needs in our lives, but help
[2:17:23] us to just put you first, Father. Help
[2:17:25] us to recognize that there's not one
[2:17:27] challenge of the devil that can't be met
[2:17:30] by you. Lord, we love you and we thank
[2:17:33] you and we just commit all of our needs
[2:17:35] into your hands for your care. We pray
[2:17:38] that you would keep your hand upon us as
[2:17:40] we go our separate ways today, Father.
[2:17:43] and that Lord Jesus, even when it would
[2:17:45] seem like there's no hope, help us,
[2:17:48] Father, to just take a hold of your hand
[2:17:51] and trust in you with all of our hearts.
[2:17:54] Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[2:17:57] just ask all these things now. In Jesus
[2:17:59] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Can we sing
[2:18:04] 758, Victory in
[2:18:09] Jesus. Victory in Jesus. I heard an old
[2:18:13] story. I heard an old old
[2:18:18] story. How a savior came from
[2:18:22] glory. How he gave his life on
[2:18:27] Calvary to save a rich like me.
[2:18:33] I heard about his
[2:18:36] glory of his precious blood at
[2:18:41] me and I
[2:18:43] repented of my sin and I want the
[2:18:50] victory.
