[19:15] Oh light

[19:23] darkness.
[19:25] You open my eyes. Let me see.
[19:32] Oh beauty
[19:35] that made
[19:37] this heart
[19:39] adore you. Oh my life spent with you.
[19:48] So here I am to worship.

[20:00] that you're my God.
[20:04] You're all together lovely,
[20:09] allto together worthy,
[20:12] allto together wonderful
[20:17] to me.
[20:21] Oh, and king of all days. Oh, so highly
[20:27] exalted,
[20:29] glorious in heaven
[20:33] above.
[20:36] Oh, humbly you came to the earth. You
[20:42] created
[20:44] all for love's sake became poor.
[20:50] So here I am to worship.
[20:55] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say

[21:18] to me.
[21:22] Oh, and I'll never know. Sorry, I don't
[21:26] know that bridge. I'm sorry.
[21:32] How much it cost
[21:36] to see my sin
[21:39] upon that cross?
[21:42] I'll never know
[21:46] how much it cost.
[21:50] to see
[21:53] upon that cross.
[21:57] So here I am to worship.

[22:24] to me.
[22:28] [Music]
[22:29] And I can do all things
[22:35] through Christ who gives me strength.
[22:41] But sometimes I wonder what he can do
[22:46] through me.
[22:50] Oh, no great success to show,
[22:57] no glory of my own.
[23:02] Yet in my weakness, he is there to let
[23:07] me know.
[23:11] His strength is perfect
[23:15] when our strength is gone.
[23:21] He'll carry us when we cannot carry on.
[23:31] Raised in his power,
[23:34] the weak becomes strong.
[23:41] His strength is perfect.
[23:45] Oh, his strength is perfect. Maybe stand
[23:49] at me if you would. But to me, so would
[23:51] you come for the uh chorus? but to be
[23:54] so. We can only know
[24:00] the power that he holds
[24:04] when we truly see how deep our weakness
[24:10] goes.
[24:13] Oh yes, his strength in us begins
[24:19] when our comes to an end.
[24:24] And he hears our humble cry and proves
[24:29] again.
[24:32] His strength is perfect
[24:36] when our strength is gone.
[24:42] He'll carry us when we cannot carry on.
[24:51] Raised in his power,
[24:55] the weak become strong.
[25:01] His strength is perfect.
[25:06] His strength is perfect.
[25:12] Let's bow and pray.
[25:15] Dear Lord Jesus Christ,
[25:19] we love you Lord.
[25:22] Dear Lord,
[25:24] this is nothing but the truth. Lord,
[25:28] your strength is perfect.
[25:30] Lord, one of those benefits,
[25:33] Lord, of being your children, Lord. And
[25:36] it's one of the reasons, Lord, we are
[25:39] here this evening, Lord, to draw that
[25:43] strength, Lord, from you, Lord, from
[25:46] your word, Lord Jesus Christ. Dear Lord
[25:48] Jesus Christ, we cannot express how much
[25:51] we love you. Lord, your word is so good
[25:54] for us. Lord, it protects us, Lord, from
[25:58] a lot of things that we cannot
[26:00] comprehend. Lord Jesus Christ, only if
[26:03] we can understand
[26:05] and only if we can just yield more, Lord
[26:07] Jesus Christ. Dear Lord Jesus Christ, we
[26:10] love you, Lord.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the great shepherd.
[26:15] And Lord Jesus Christ, you said your
[26:17] sheep hear your voice. And Lord Jesus
[26:19] Christ, we are here because you have
[26:22] called us. Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we
[26:25] love you, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we
[26:27] know this is a midweek service and our
[26:31] minds could be everywhere. Lord, we are
[26:34] tired. But Lord Jesus Christ, we just
[26:37] pray that we just get in the spirit of
[26:40] worship,
[26:41] &gt;&gt; the spirit of receiving your word, Lord
[26:43] Jesus Christ, that we have enough
[26:45] strength, Lord, to push through the
[26:47] weak, Lord Jesus Christ. And be the
[26:49] light to this world, Lord Jesus Christ,
[26:51] and fulfill the purpose, Lord Jesus
[26:53] Christ, you have called us to do to be,
[26:56] Lord Jesus Christ, to this world, Lord
[26:58] Jesus Christ. Lord, we love you, Lord.
[27:01] We just commit the song service, the
[27:04] musicians, even the preacher Lord into
[27:06] your to your hands Lord. We just want to
[27:09] hear your mind, not men's mind, Lord
[27:11] Jesus Christ. And Lord Jesus Christ, in
[27:13] our midst, Lord, we are your children
[27:16] with different needs, Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:19] May you address those needs, Lord, even
[27:21] through singing and even through your
[27:24] word, Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord Jesus
[27:26] Christ above all Lord give us revelation
[27:29] and understanding of your word Lord
[27:31] Jesus Christ. And it's only you who can
[27:34] give that Lord Jesus Christ. Lord we
[27:36] love you. We bless your holy name. In
[27:38] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you my brother. Take your
[27:46] seats tonight.

[37:35] What a day that will be. He's deserving
[37:37] of our praises. What a day that'll be
[37:39] when we won't have to stop singing his
[37:41] praises out of this human flesh of ours.
[37:44] Our biggest enemy is ourselves as we
[37:46] know. Let's just sing this song tonight.
[37:49] Just think about project yourself to
[37:51] that next chapter of our lives. Well,
[37:54] there is coming
[37:57] a day when no heartache

[38:08] no more tears

[38:25] glorious day
[38:28] that will be.
[38:31] Oh,
[38:32] what a day
[38:35] that will be.
[38:37] When my Jesus
[38:40] I shall see. Oh, when I look upon his
[38:45] face. Oh, that one who saved me by his
[38:50] grace
[38:51] and he takes me by the hand and he leads
[38:56] me through that promised land.
[39:00] What a day,
[39:03] glorious day
[39:05] that will be.
[39:08] Oh, there will be no
[39:12] sorrow there.
[39:14] No more burdens
[39:17] to bear.
[39:19] No more sickness,
[39:21] no more pain,
[39:23] no more parting
[39:26] over them.
[39:28] And forever
[39:30] I will be
[39:32] with the one who died for me. Oh, what a
[39:38] day.
[39:39] Glorious day
[39:42] that will be.
[39:44] Oh,
[39:46] what a day
[39:49] that will be.
[39:53] [Music]
[40:01] But who save me by his grace? When he
[40:06] takes me by the hand and leads me
[40:10] through the promised land,
[40:14] what a day,
[40:17] glorious day
[40:19] that will be.
[40:23] Amen. Amen. That day has never been
[40:26] closer.
[40:27] If you have a need tonight, we just want
[40:30] to invite you to defy gravity and bring
[40:33] it to the throne of mercy and grace. We
[40:37] just have a couple of requests we wanted
[40:38] to mention. We want to remember brother
[40:40] Peter who's traveling. He's in Ghana and
[40:43] he'll be away until the beginning of
[40:44] August. And uh we also have a request
[40:47] here for Sister Linda Dick's father,
[40:50] Brother Herman Fzen. He fell down and
[40:53] he'll be getting assessed tomorrow. And
[40:55] we just want to ask the Lord to
[40:57] intervene and touch our brother.
[41:00] If you have a need, just make it known
[41:02] unto him by the way of an uplift hand as
[41:05] we go to him in prayer tonight. Gracious
[41:08] heavenly father, we're so thankful that
[41:10] we have a place that we can come to,
[41:12] Lord. We're so thankful that we have a
[41:15] place that we can bring our prayers,
[41:16] Lord. Father, the many needs that we
[41:19] have in our lives, Father, we can bring
[41:21] them unto you, Lord. We know that you
[41:23] are more than able to meet each and
[41:25] every need. And Father, tonight one more
[41:28] time, we just want to take you at your
[41:30] word. Father, you said to come unto you,
[41:34] to bring unto you all of our needs, Lord
[41:38] Jesus, that our burdens, Father, are
[41:42] more than we can bear sometimes. But you
[41:44] said in your word that you would never
[41:46] give us more than we can bear. So,
[41:48] Father, tonight Lord Jesus, whatever the
[41:51] needs are behind the hands that were
[41:53] raised, we just want to bring them unto
[41:55] you tonight, Father, and thank you, Lord
[41:57] Jesus, for giving us the need, Lord, so
[42:00] that you could express yourself to us
[42:02] through that need, Lord. Father, that we
[42:05] could come to know you in a greater way.
[42:07] That's the only reason we have these
[42:08] needs in our lives. And father, if we
[42:11] could just have the right perspective,
[42:14] Father, Lord, we pray that you would
[42:16] meet the needs sovereignly according to
[42:17] your will, Lord. Tonight, we just want
[42:19] to remember Brother Herman Fzen, Lord
[42:21] Jesus. Father, we pray that you would
[42:24] just touch him now in the name of Jesus,
[42:26] that you would heal his body. Father, we
[42:29] thank you that we can remember him, Lord
[42:31] Jesus. Even though we're not
[42:33] geographically close, we know that time
[42:35] and space does not stop or hinder you,
[42:39] Father. So we thank you also for healing
[42:41] brother Herman and father tonight we
[42:44] just thank you for brother Peter Bochi
[42:46] Manu Lord we pray that you would be with
[42:48] him as he has traveled Lord while he
[42:50] mourns for his brother Father that you
[42:52] would just bear them up Lord Jesus be
[42:54] with the family Lord Jesus and Father if
[42:57] it be your will that you would bring him
[42:58] back home again safely at the appointed
[43:00] time Lord to his family and this body
[43:04] Lord Jesus tonight we love you and we
[43:06] thank you we just want to commit all
[43:08] these needs needs into your hands,
[43:10] Father, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[43:13] Amen.
[43:15] Thank you, musicians. If you have your
[43:17] Bibles tonight, I would like to read uh
[43:20] familiar scripture we went over a little
[43:23] while ago in Mark chapter 7.
[43:26] Mark chapter 7 verse 24
[43:30] talking about the Syrphenician woman
[43:35] who was a Greek which is a gentile
[43:41] in Mark 7
[43:44] verse 24
[43:51] says and from thence he arose and went
[43:54] into the borders of Ty in Sidon and
[43:57] entered into a house and would have no
[44:01] man know it. But he could not be hid.
[44:05] For a certain woman whose young daughter
[44:07] had an unclean spirit
[44:10] heard of him and came and fell at his
[44:14] feet. The woman was a Greek and a
[44:17] cyrophenician by nation. And she
[44:20] besought him that he would cast forth
[44:23] the devil out of her daughter.
[44:26] But Jesus said unto her,
[44:30] "The children first be filled, for it's
[44:33] not meat to take the children's bread
[44:35] and cast it unto the dogs."
[44:39] And she answered and said unto him,
[44:40] "Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table
[44:44] eat of the children's crumbs."
[44:47] And he said unto her, for this saying,
[44:49] Go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy
[44:52] daughter.
[44:54] And when she was come to her house, she
[44:57] found the devil gone out, and her
[45:00] daughter laid upon the bed. Let's just
[45:03] bow one more time. Heavenly Father,
[45:06] Lord, we thank you for your word. We
[45:08] thank you that you are the same today as
[45:12] you were there, Father, on the coast of
[45:14] Ty and Siden, Lord Jesus. Speaking to
[45:18] that that little woman, Father, that had
[45:20] the need in her heart, Lord. She had the
[45:23] need in her family, Lord. She had the
[45:25] need in her child, Lord Jesus. And
[45:28] Father, Lord, even though you spoke to
[45:31] her in in a different way than maybe she
[45:33] was used to, Lord, she never gave up.
[45:38] There was something inside of her that
[45:40] knew who you were.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; And Father, tonight I pray that that
[45:44] same something would be inside of us,
[45:46] Lord. That we would recognize you just
[45:48] like that Cyrophenician woman did as
[45:51] well. Lord, as we turn to your word now,
[45:55] we pray that we could just surrender
[45:56] ourselves, Lord, our hearts and our
[45:58] minds. That Lord, we could just be knit
[46:00] together in love, Father. That the
[46:02] charity of your Holy Spirit would just
[46:05] minister from seat to seat, Lord, from
[46:08] heart to heart, Lord, in this building
[46:10] tonight. That when we leave here
[46:11] tonight, we would say truly that our
[46:13] hearts burned within us because we know
[46:16] you walked with us along the way. We
[46:19] love you tonight, Father. We just commit
[46:20] this service into your hands now for
[46:22] your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we
[46:25] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight.
[46:28] You may be seated.
[46:31] We are certainly thankful to be back
[46:33] once again in the house of the Lord. We
[46:36] had a nice little journey this last week
[46:38] and I'd like to thank the brothers once
[46:41] again for stepping in um in mystead. It
[46:45] was a much needed break just to be with
[46:47] the family and to not be thinking about
[46:51] much of anything. But we all uh we all
[46:54] need to have breaks once in a while. And
[46:57] &gt;&gt; I was just so thankful to be able to do
[46:59] that, you know. And for those who were
[47:01] wondering what we did, we just jumped in
[47:03] the in the motor home and we drove we
[47:05] drove out to the west coast and drove
[47:08] through Victoria and uh then we went up
[47:11] north in Vancouver Island up to Tofino
[47:15] and we spent a couple days there in
[47:17] Tofino and around that area and it was
[47:20] just a wonderful, wonderful time. We
[47:22] didn't have any real bad weather which
[47:24] was nice. It was a little bit cloudy,
[47:26] but you know, it's just good to to get
[47:28] away. And one of the things that's
[47:31] tremendous, I think, is to be able to
[47:33] spend that much time driving. Uh,
[47:36] conversations are had. And you can get
[47:38] to know one another in a in a really
[47:40] good way. And it's it's kind of good
[47:42] because sometimes nobody can get away
[47:45] when you're having a conversation. And
[47:48] uh it's just the way it is, you know.
[47:49] Sometimes the conversations get tough
[47:51] and sometimes the conversations um just
[47:54] flow when they're easy, but it's just a
[47:56] wonderful thing to get away and have a
[47:58] little bit of a road trip. So, I want to
[48:00] thank everyone for stepping in and just
[48:02] giving us that opportunity to have a
[48:04] little break. We just have a couple of
[48:06] announcements I wanted to make. We have
[48:08] uh a wedding happening this Saturday, as
[48:10] I'm sure we're all aware of. It's
[48:12] brother Logan and sister Neve and uh
[48:15] it's going to be this Saturday and they
[48:17] have said they would love to celebrate
[48:19] with everyone but they are limited by
[48:21] numbers and the wedding that's happening
[48:24] is by invitation only. And they said
[48:27] however we would sincerely appreciate
[48:29] your prayers. So, if you don't mind, uh
[48:32] just please have a little bit of grace
[48:33] for them and offer them the best thing
[48:36] that you can and that is your prayer and
[48:39] uh encouragement as a new couple. So,
[48:42] we're certainly excited for them and
[48:43] what the Lord's done for them in their
[48:45] lives and uh as it turns into a life.
[48:50] It's going to go from two to one and
[48:52] we're certainly thankful to see that. So
[48:54] just pray for brother Logan and sister
[48:56] Neve and uh we're sure the Lord will
[48:58] bless their their marriage. We have uh
[49:01] brother Menel Freezen is going to be
[49:03] here. That's brother Logan's grandpa and
[49:05] he's a general in the gospel, a general
[49:09] in this message. And I just asked him if
[49:12] he would mind taking the service while
[49:13] he's here. He's a man who's seen just
[49:16] about every single wind of doctrine that
[49:18] could possibly blow through the message
[49:21] ranks and uh still he serves the Lord
[49:24] with all his heart, just loves the Lord
[49:26] and uh he's just a wealth of
[49:28] information. So we're certainly honored
[49:30] to have brother Menof Fzen uh who is
[49:33] also Sister Shel's dad take the service
[49:36] for us on uh Sunday. We have a potluck
[49:39] that's going to follow out at our house
[49:41] on Sunday. So, if you feel inclined, I'm
[49:44] sure there will be a poll. And if you
[49:45] would like to uh respond with what you
[49:48] plan to bring, that would be
[49:49] appreciated. We have a youth hike coming
[49:52] up on August the 9th, Saturday, August
[49:54] the 9th. And that's always a good time
[49:56] for the youth and anyone that desires to
[49:59] hike. I'm sure it will be just fine.
[50:02] We also have a picnic in the park. And
[50:05] we were going to try and do this at Bone
[50:07] S Park. And I know it became probably a
[50:08] little bit confusing because it was
[50:10] announced that way, but things changed.
[50:12] Um, and it's now going to be at what's
[50:15] called Prairie Winds Park. That's in the
[50:17] northeast. And that will be August the
[50:19] 31st. And there will be details to
[50:21] follow that. So, I trust that uh the
[50:25] Lord blesses our our summer as we go
[50:29] forwards. There's a couple other things
[50:31] brewing that's uh you know, brothers
[50:33] that are coming. I believe brother Danny
[50:35] Delmundo is potentially coming and uh
[50:38] we're just waiting for a confirmation
[50:39] from him. So, we're excited to see what
[50:42] uh what will transpire with that and uh
[50:45] yeah, we'll just see what the Lord has
[50:47] in store.
[50:49] Oh my, are you happy tonight?
[50:52] &gt;&gt; We uh talked about this story a little
[50:54] while ago about the Cyber Phoenician
[50:56] woman and how she was uh she was in need
[50:59] and she wasn't afraid that she was a
[51:01] Gentile. She wasn't afraid that Jesus
[51:02] was a Jew. She wasn't afraid that there
[51:05] was segregation. And uh you know, she
[51:08] had a need and that was something that
[51:10] was driving her. And uh she knew that
[51:13] someone was able to meet that need
[51:14] according to the testimonies that were
[51:16] going through the land. And this cyber
[51:18] phoenician woman, she was was inspired
[51:22] to go and see Jesus. But I think it's
[51:26] just beautiful. As we say many times,
[51:29] it's not always one-sided. In fact, it's
[51:32] never one-sided. And and you know,
[51:34] Brother Brandham says it very clearly
[51:35] that we don't desire Jesus, Jesus
[51:38] desires us. We don't seek the Lord, the
[51:41] Lord seeks us. Even though we do come to
[51:45] a place where we desire, we say, "What
[51:46] is this? What what what am I looking at?
[51:49] What what what is it I'm hearing?
[51:51] There's something about this that is
[51:52] inspiring to us, but we uh it's no
[51:57] accident.
[52:00] And tonight, I just want to talk about
[52:01] this Cyr Phoenician woman. And and you
[52:03] know, the thought for tonight, the
[52:04] inspiration for tonight was how this
[52:07] woman, she she answered. She she
[52:11] answered and said unto him, you know,
[52:14] Jesus, let's just go back a little bit
[52:16] just for the sake of it, you know, just
[52:17] to I guess make it fresh. We'll just
[52:19] read it again from verse 24. And and
[52:21] from thence he arose and went into the
[52:23] borders of Ty and Sidon. He went there
[52:26] specifically with a purpose. He didn't
[52:29] just go there willy-nilly because it was
[52:31] just the way uh he had to go. He went
[52:34] there for a very specific purpose. He
[52:36] entered into a house and would have no
[52:38] man know it, but he could not be hid.
[52:40] The people knew. There were testimonies
[52:42] swirling around about this guy. For a
[52:45] certain woman whose young daughter had
[52:47] an unclean spirit heard of him and came
[52:49] and fell at his feet.
[52:53] She had the right approach.
[52:55] She didn't just speak to him. She didn't
[52:58] just yell at him. She didn't just get
[53:00] someone to go and talk to him. She fell
[53:03] at his feet. She had a very specific
[53:05] approach. The woman was a Greek, a cyber
[53:08] phoenician by nation. And we know that
[53:10] the Greek is a gentile as well. and she
[53:13] besought him that he would cast forth
[53:15] the devil out of her daughter. But
[53:17] here's what Jesus' response is. The
[53:20] children must first be filled. We must
[53:23] first fill the children. For it's not
[53:25] meat to take the children's bread and
[53:27] cast it unto the dogs. And you know,
[53:30] brother Brandham talks about this, I
[53:32] think, in such an interesting way
[53:34] because here, here Jesus is taking a
[53:37] very insulting thought, a very insulting
[53:41] statement, and he's putting it in her
[53:43] lap. She's bringing the need. She's
[53:45] bringing the approach. She's being
[53:47] reverent, coming to him. And what does
[53:49] Jesus say? You know what? It's not it's
[53:52] not right for us to just for for me to
[53:54] just give it to the dogs. We got to feed
[53:56] the children first. We came to feed the
[53:58] the children of Israel first and and the
[54:01] dogs are the ones without the Gentiles,
[54:04] the heathens. They don't deserve the
[54:06] children's meat. And you know, I just
[54:09] love how brother Brandham talks about
[54:10] this because sometimes he he brings it
[54:12] forward, not sometimes, he does bring it
[54:14] forward to a a modern-day discussion
[54:16] where people can actually hear something
[54:18] like that in the church where maybe the
[54:20] preaching happens and someone says, you
[54:22] know, the whole service alls I heard was
[54:24] that guy just say that I'm a crow. I'm a
[54:26] crow. I'm a crow. And the other person
[54:29] talking to him says, you know, I I just
[54:31] can't believe it because alls I heard
[54:32] was that I'm an eagle. I'm an eagle. I'm
[54:35] an eagle.
[54:36] It's just the spirit that we're in. It's
[54:39] it's it's what we're we're doing in our
[54:41] own lives. What are we bringing to the
[54:43] party? Are we having the right approach?
[54:47] Even though sometimes the word of God
[54:49] might give us a little bit of a
[54:51] spanking, is it going to be enough for
[54:53] us to get up and run out and say, "I
[54:55] can't do that." Is it the man
[54:58] ministering or is it the Holy Ghost
[55:00] ministering? That's where we have to put
[55:03] it. And and I just think it's so
[55:05] interesting because this woman was
[55:06] insulted in a very insulting way. Dogs
[55:09] were not a pleasant creature in that
[55:12] land at that time. A dog was a very
[55:15] strong insult to call another human
[55:18] being. And she answered and said unto
[55:20] him, "Yes, Lord. Yet the dogs under the
[55:23] table eat of the children's crumbs. The
[55:26] dogs under the table, the Cyranicians,
[55:29] the Greeks, the people who are the
[55:32] heathens, the ones who are outside of
[55:34] the economy of the Jewish race. Those
[55:38] people live on the testimonies that
[55:41] they're hearing swirling around in the
[55:43] markets with the Jews. They live on
[55:45] those crumbs, those little morsels,
[55:47] those those tender bits that fall. They
[55:50] they hold their their they put a lot of
[55:53] weight in it. They think, you know, I've
[55:55] got a problem and if I could just get
[55:56] through and just maybe just maybe touch
[55:59] the hem of his garment, right? Maybe if
[56:01] I could just get his attention in just a
[56:04] little tiny way, maybe there would be
[56:06] hope for my child. maybe there would be
[56:08] hope for my need. But this woman, she
[56:10] said it, "Yep, even though I'm a dog, oh
[56:14] my, I I still eat the the crumbs under
[56:17] the table."
[56:20] And he said unto her, for this saying,
[56:23] "Go thy way. The devil has gone out of
[56:26] thy daughter." Tonight, I want to I want
[56:28] to call this, if I had to call this
[56:29] title this, I would say, "For this
[56:33] saying,"
[56:35] you know, Brother Brad, I'm going to
[56:36] read the quotes. I get to them. I sent
[56:37] the email tonight. Thank you. I'm
[56:40] thankful that I did that. Um, but what I
[56:44] want to say is, Brother Brandham, he
[56:46] mentions this and he says Jesus didn't
[56:48] even pray for her. He didn't even lay
[56:51] hands on her. He didn't even go see her.
[56:54] He said, "For this saying." And whose
[56:57] saying was it?
[56:59] &gt;&gt; It was her saying.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. I know who I am. I'm a
[57:05] sinner saved by grace just like
[57:07] everybody else. I'm not holier than
[57:09] thou. I I know that there's nothing that
[57:11] I could ever do in my own self. It's
[57:14] only the grace of God. That's the only
[57:17] reason that I'm here. But because of
[57:19] that, she was able to say even the dogs,
[57:24] I know you called me a dog and I am a
[57:27] dog. I recognize I'm a dog, but even the
[57:31] dogs, they eat the crumbs. They still
[57:32] get fed. they still hear the testimonies
[57:35] of what the Lord's doing in our land.
[57:37] And I just can't help but think that's
[57:38] that's that's just the the way of a
[57:41] believer for this saying. And you know,
[57:43] tonight I don't want to just leave it
[57:44] back there in history. I want to bring
[57:46] it right up to modern-day events made
[57:49] clear by prophecy. We know the age in
[57:51] which we're living in, brothers and
[57:52] sisters. This is not the age of of
[57:54] discernment of the heart. This is not
[57:56] the age of of touching someone's hand
[57:59] and having a prayer line a and doing
[58:01] everything that the prophet did, trying
[58:03] to just repeat what the prophet did,
[58:04] trying to make a cookie cutter religion,
[58:07] a denomination surrounding this message
[58:09] of the hour. What we want to do is bring
[58:11] it into the true dynamic power of the
[58:15] Holy Ghost falling upon his people. When
[58:18] that happens, there's something that
[58:20] takes place.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Then it's no longer him speaking.
[58:25] We know that Vashi had an attitude. We
[58:27] heard about it. Thank you, brother
[58:28] Emanuel. She did. She thought she was
[58:31] someone, didn't she?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; I'm the bride. I know who I am. And the
[58:37] king says, "I want to see your beauty. I
[58:40] know that you're so beautiful. I've had
[58:43] a really big celebration and I would
[58:44] just like to actually show you. I would
[58:46] like to bring you on display." Isn't it
[58:48] interesting that the bride came into
[58:50] preview two times? Isn't it a
[58:53] coincidence? Is it a coincidence that
[58:55] there was the first bride that got out
[58:57] of step? This Vashti got right out of
[58:59] step. Oh my. But there was another one,
[59:01] wasn't there? And she knew her position.
[59:04] She got right into step. She didn't
[59:05] recognize it initially. She had to have
[59:08] someone say, "Do you think that it's
[59:09] possible that you could have been raised
[59:11] up for a time such as this?"
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, do you think it's
[59:15] possible that we could have been raised
[59:16] up for a time such as this?
[59:20] &gt;&gt; This ain't time to play church. This
[59:22] ain't time to play message. This is time
[59:25] to play our position.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And our position is not play. Just for
[59:31] the record, our position is as serious
[59:33] as it's ever been or ever could be. It's
[59:36] recognizing who we are. Recognizing our
[59:39] day in and its message.
[59:43] Recognizing that we have been called
[59:46] unto adoption. Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; We haven't been called to just be church
[59:51] members, to just be believers, to just
[59:55] be growing. We've been called to be the
[59:58] queen of the universe.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's beyond comprehension.
[1:00:05] But I just think it's so beautiful
[1:00:08] for this saying go thy way. For you're
[1:00:12] saying just go and live your life. just
[1:00:15] go and do your thing because your saying
[1:00:18] pleased me. Your saying showed me that
[1:00:20] even though someone stepped on your
[1:00:22] toes, you never got offended and ran
[1:00:24] away. You're just willing to say, "Be it
[1:00:26] unto me according to thy word." I I'm
[1:00:29] just going to say, how can it possibly
[1:00:32] how can we ever be any different than
[1:00:36] she was in this scripture here?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I just love how he he just went over
[1:00:43] there. had a very specific purpose just
[1:00:45] like he went unto the woman at the well.
[1:00:46] And you know, the disciples, they didn't
[1:00:48] they didn't know what he was doing. They
[1:00:51] didn't realize why he was going to to to
[1:00:55] the well to sit by the well at that time
[1:00:57] of the day, but he had a very specific
[1:00:59] purpose in mind. And and we know that
[1:01:02] there was the natural tendencies that
[1:01:04] were happening. They were hungry. And
[1:01:06] Jesus said, "Why don't you just go and
[1:01:07] get some food? Go get some viddles and
[1:01:09] and I'll just stay here. I'll just hang
[1:01:11] out here and I'll wait for you. I'll
[1:01:12] have a rest. But what happened was that
[1:01:15] woman came. That woman who had five
[1:01:18] husbands and the one whom she had now
[1:01:20] was not her own. But he knew that she
[1:01:23] was going to be there. I just think it's
[1:01:24] so beautiful how he how he does it is no
[1:01:27] accidents to the way the Lord the Lord
[1:01:30] moves. The way he answers prayer.
[1:01:32] Everything that he does is with a very
[1:01:34] specific purpose. And and you know, I
[1:01:37] just think it's such a such an amazing
[1:01:39] thing tonight to look at this scripture
[1:01:41] and see that it's at thy saying because
[1:01:44] of this saying, go thy way. Just go thy
[1:01:47] way. The devil is gone out of thy
[1:01:49] daughter. Got a couple of quotes that I
[1:01:51] want to bring tonight. And uh they're
[1:01:55] out of questions and answers on the Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost.
[1:01:58] And uh brother Brandam says this in in
[1:02:02] paragraph 17. And he says, "I want you
[1:02:03] to remember this and I'll try to go over
[1:02:05] it in the morning again. Gentiles, the
[1:02:08] gospel that's given to them is a faith
[1:02:11] gospel,
[1:02:13] not a works at all." See, but isn't that
[1:02:17] interesting where so many times people
[1:02:19] can get hung up in a worksbased gospel
[1:02:22] and try and make something happen by the
[1:02:25] way we work, by the way, by the way we
[1:02:29] look. It's got nothing to do with it.
[1:02:33] I want you to remember this and I'll try
[1:02:34] to go over it in the morning. Gentiles,
[1:02:36] the gospel that's given to them is a
[1:02:38] faith gospel, not a works at all. See,
[1:02:41] and and like I said last night, when the
[1:02:43] Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost, when they
[1:02:46] went down to the Jews,
[1:02:49] Acts 19:5,
[1:02:52] they had to lay hands on them that they
[1:02:55] receive it. And when they went down to
[1:02:58] the Samaritans,
[1:03:00] they had to lay hands on them. But when
[1:03:03] they come to the Gentiles at Cornelius
[1:03:06] house, while Peter spake these words, no
[1:03:11] laying on of hands.
[1:03:14] All it was was the preaching of the
[1:03:16] gospel, bringing the present truth to
[1:03:19] the situation. That's what it was. He
[1:03:22] says, "When the little girl died,
[1:03:24] Gyrus's daughter, the priest said, come
[1:03:26] lay hands on her and she'll leave,
[1:03:29] live." Sorry. But when the Roman
[1:03:31] centurion, the Gentile, said, "I'm not
[1:03:34] worthy. You come under my roof. Speak
[1:03:38] the word." That's it. See?
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. Right.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; The Syrphanician woman Greek actually
[1:03:50] what she was
[1:03:52] when she when Jesus said to her said
[1:03:55] it's not meat for me to take the
[1:03:57] children's bread and give it to the dog.
[1:03:58] She said that's true Lord but the dogs
[1:04:01] under the table eats the children's
[1:04:05] crumbs.
[1:04:07] He said, "For this saying, the devil's
[1:04:10] left your daughter."
[1:04:12] Now, I love this. I think sometimes we
[1:04:15] can look at at at at quotes like this.
[1:04:18] We can hear quotes like this and maybe
[1:04:21] actually just have it brush over and it
[1:04:23] just it just doesn't really stick with
[1:04:25] us. We don't really grasp it. But here
[1:04:28] he says, "For this saying, the devil's
[1:04:30] left your daughter. Say good things."
[1:04:33] Then
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; say something good about somebody.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Talk about Jesus.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Say something loyal, something real.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; That's the way to get rid of devils.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; It's not jumping up and down. It's not
[1:04:54] prayer lines. It's not screaming and
[1:04:57] shouting. It's not even prayer meetings.
[1:05:00] Remember, brother Brandham, he said
[1:05:02] Jesus, he didn't pray for this woman. He
[1:05:05] didn't lay hands on this woman. He said,
[1:05:07] "For your saying, for your sake, because
[1:05:10] you say it,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; go thy way. Just go live your life.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Keep doing what you're doing.
[1:05:18] But thank you for believing."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; But if we want to see some action,
[1:05:23] brothers and sisters, and I know that we
[1:05:26] know this, but I just want to encourage
[1:05:27] us tonight. Say something nice.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Say something nice. And we know full
[1:05:33] well, we've heard it many times. Brother
[1:05:34] Barry's going to do it again. Is those
[1:05:37] dinnertime conversations, those times,
[1:05:40] like we were just talking about driving
[1:05:41] in the vehicle where nobody else can
[1:05:42] hear us.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; We can talk about whatever we want.
[1:05:47] Nobody can tell. Nobody's heard it, but
[1:05:50] God's heard it.
[1:05:52] And you know what's worse is when our
[1:05:54] children hear it and our children hear
[1:05:57] it and then our children go and repeat
[1:05:59] it and when our children go and repeat
[1:06:01] it in such a way it can cause a lot of
[1:06:04] problems. I was talking to a brother
[1:06:07] recently. We were fellowshipping and he
[1:06:09] was telling us about how how embarrassed
[1:06:11] he got, how thoroughly embarrassed he
[1:06:14] got. He was talking
[1:06:16] in front of his nephew and he said
[1:06:18] something bad about another person in
[1:06:21] front of his nephew and and it wasn't
[1:06:24] terrible but it wasn't really good. And
[1:06:27] few weeks later his little nephew's
[1:06:30] nephew was probably 5 years old. They
[1:06:32] were having a conversation
[1:06:34] and uh someone's name came up and the
[1:06:36] little nephew he said, "Is that that so
[1:06:38] and so?" In in a really crass way that
[1:06:43] parents would typically say, "I'll wash
[1:06:45] your mouth out with soap for that." But
[1:06:48] he heard his uncle say it and he he
[1:06:50] really appreciated his uncle. He looked
[1:06:53] up to his uncle. We've got to be careful
[1:06:55] what we say.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; People are listening and we know our
[1:06:59] children are listening very intently.
[1:07:02] And what's interesting also is you know
[1:07:04] in the Bible those uh what is it 40 and
[1:07:06] two children
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; two she bears went out and thrashed
[1:07:10] them. Brother Brandham said it was
[1:07:11] because of the dinner dinner time
[1:07:13] conversations the parents were having
[1:07:15] when no one else was listening but the
[1:07:16] children were and they went out and
[1:07:18] mocked the prophet for it.
[1:07:21] The worst thing that can ever happen is
[1:07:23] for us to mock another ministry or
[1:07:26] minister or church and say that church
[1:07:29] is this and that church is that.
[1:07:30] Brothers and sisters, God's work is
[1:07:33] sovereign. His churches are sovereign.
[1:07:36] He puts people in position sovereignly.
[1:07:40] Might be for a day, might be for a week,
[1:07:42] might be for a year, could be for a
[1:07:44] decade. It's God's work.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; But for this saying, the daughters left
[1:07:50] your daughter. How many people have
[1:07:52] situations in their lives where they
[1:07:54] know they're dealing with devils? I just
[1:07:57] want to say tonight, say good things.
[1:08:00] make those devils leave.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; They can't stand it when we start to say
[1:08:05] good things.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; But you know, they love it when we talk
[1:08:09] negative.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Love it when we speak negative. When we
[1:08:13] talk bad, when we speak negative. And
[1:08:15] you know, brothers and sisters, we know
[1:08:17] it. But sometimes, let's just stir up
[1:08:19] our pure minds by way of remembrance.
[1:08:21] Why does it change the atmosphere when
[1:08:23] we pray play music? When we press press
[1:08:27] play and and have worship music
[1:08:29] happening, we can take a bad situation
[1:08:31] and just change it in an instant just by
[1:08:34] playing good music. How could David cast
[1:08:37] out devils from Saul
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; by his stringed instrument?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; We can change the atmosphere.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; We have that ability. Brother Brandham
[1:08:47] talked about it how as a husband, he saw
[1:08:50] the house was just fit to be tied. His
[1:08:53] wife was all upset. Everything was going
[1:08:54] wrong. He didn't come in and say,
[1:08:56] "Where's my dinner?" and just put
[1:08:59] another weight on top of the situation.
[1:09:01] What he did was he said he put on an
[1:09:03] apron and he got in front of that dirty
[1:09:06] sink and he started washing dishes. He
[1:09:09] changed the atmosphere. We have the
[1:09:11] ability to do that
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; in such a simple way. H how about a
[1:09:15] greater way? Maybe in the church of the
[1:09:18] living God. Maybe in our own famil
[1:09:20] family's lives where maybe once upon a
[1:09:22] time when we were stuck in the
[1:09:24] sanctification stage, we looked at
[1:09:26] ourselves in the mirror and thought, "We
[1:09:27] look pretty good. I can see my name in
[1:09:30] the word of God in every every verse,
[1:09:32] every chapter, every verse from Genesis
[1:09:34] to Revelation. Man, I'm a fine looking
[1:09:36] fella. I wish my family had the grace
[1:09:39] that I have." Don't you know that they
[1:09:41] do have that grace? They just haven't
[1:09:43] recognized it. Right?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; But if we have that attitude towards
[1:09:48] them where we're better than them,
[1:09:50] they're less than, we're not going to
[1:09:52] attract them to this gospel, we're going
[1:09:54] to detract them.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; But for this saying, the devil's left
[1:09:59] your daughter, who had the saying, it
[1:10:01] wasn't Jesus. It wasn't one of the
[1:10:03] disciples. It wasn't one of the
[1:10:05] ministry. It was that woman.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; That woman had the words. her words
[1:10:14] allowed that devil to leave.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Talk about Jesus. Say something loyal,
[1:10:21] something real. That's the way to get
[1:10:24] rid of devils. And you know, brothers
[1:10:26] and sisters, if you have a situation,
[1:10:29] even in your marriage,
[1:10:32] for the married people, don't talk bad.
[1:10:36] Do not talk bad about your spouse. Don't
[1:10:39] go and pour your heart out to a brother
[1:10:41] or a sister and talk about how bad your
[1:10:43] husband is or how bad your wife is, how
[1:10:46] bad how bad, how bad. Go and pour your
[1:10:49] heart out and say how good they are.
[1:10:52] Talk about why you fell in love. Say
[1:10:55] loyal things. Say good things. Say
[1:10:58] encouraging things. That is how you will
[1:11:01] cast out that devil out of your
[1:11:02] marriage. If we have a situation with a
[1:11:05] relationship, maybe with siblings or or
[1:11:09] with anybody, it doesn't matter. Say
[1:11:11] nice things.
[1:11:14] It can be so easy to get caught up in in
[1:11:16] the moment. And I know it so easy to get
[1:11:19] caught up in the moment. But we're not
[1:11:21] living in an ordinary day, are we? I'm
[1:11:24] sure we can look at it. Many people can
[1:11:26] look at this world and and not even be
[1:11:29] religious, not have a a lick of of
[1:11:33] understanding about what's going on in
[1:11:35] terms of the message of the hour, not
[1:11:37] not have any ability to believe what we
[1:11:40] believe, but still look at this world
[1:11:43] and say it is crazy bonkers. There's
[1:11:46] something wrong with this world. Why is
[1:11:50] that? Because it is a different age.
[1:11:53] This is the age of the rapture. This is
[1:11:55] the age of a body change. This is the
[1:11:57] age where we will just be moving out of
[1:12:01] here in the moment in the twinkling of
[1:12:03] an eye. This is the time. It's such a
[1:12:05] paradox where we have to prepare. We
[1:12:08] have to
[1:12:09] ho our potatoes like he's coming in a
[1:12:12] hundred years but live like he's coming
[1:12:14] tomorrow.
[1:12:16] And I just wanted to encourage us
[1:12:18] tonight brothers and sisters that you
[1:12:20] know it was at this saying it was for
[1:12:23] her saying that Jesus who is the same
[1:12:26] yesterday today and forever told her to
[1:12:28] go her way because of your saying just
[1:12:32] go your way. We know that that Vashi she
[1:12:35] had no interest at all. She was
[1:12:38] spiritually entitled
[1:12:41] wasn't she? She she was entitled to her
[1:12:44] position and she didn't realize that you
[1:12:46] know what you could be put away and and
[1:12:50] she found herself in that situation. But
[1:12:52] the other wife, Queen Esther, she she
[1:12:56] actually came to the place where she was
[1:12:58] being persecuted. We know the story full
[1:13:00] well. But what did the king say to her
[1:13:02] when she recognized it and brought her
[1:13:04] petition? The king king said to her,
[1:13:06] "You do it to the half of my kingdom.
[1:13:09] Take my seal and make it happen. You're
[1:13:12] the queen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You say the word.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:17] forever.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; You know, Sister Hadtie Wright,
[1:13:24] this is the third quote, Brother
[1:13:25] Brandham. He says, Hadtie Wright the
[1:13:28] other day,
[1:13:30] she didn't ask for nothing.
[1:13:33] She didn't ask for nothing. She was just
[1:13:36] sitting there. And you know, I I can't
[1:13:38] help but think about it. If you ever get
[1:13:40] into that scenario where maybe dinner
[1:13:42] has ended and you're just having a
[1:13:44] little bit of fellowship, I'd just like
[1:13:45] to encourage us to think about it. I'm
[1:13:47] sure we all do. But again, let's just
[1:13:49] stir up our pure minds by way of
[1:13:50] remembrance. He is the same yesterday,
[1:13:52] today, and forever after supper is done
[1:13:54] and we're sitting around maybe with some
[1:13:56] guests over and we're about to embark on
[1:13:58] the sweets. the dessert's about to come
[1:14:01] out and coffee is being served and we're
[1:14:03] all getting comfortably settled in for
[1:14:05] the next round of of entertainment and
[1:14:08] our discussion. You know, it was in a
[1:14:10] setting just like that, just exactly
[1:14:13] like that where they were sitting around
[1:14:15] with the prophet of God. And and we know
[1:14:17] that where two or three are gathered
[1:14:19] together in his name, he's there.
[1:14:20] Brothers and sisters, don't think that
[1:14:21] was a special occasion. It was a special
[1:14:23] group of people. It was an example for
[1:14:26] every single one of our lives. When
[1:14:28] we're sitting around, are we talking
[1:14:29] nice? Are we speaking good? If we are,
[1:14:32] then what we're doing is inviting the
[1:14:34] Lord to come around. I I just can't help
[1:14:37] but think about this, you know, out of
[1:14:39] I'm just going to read this. out of
[1:14:40] Philippians 4:8 it says finally brethren
[1:14:43] whatsoever things are are true
[1:14:46] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:14:48] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:14:51] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:14:54] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:14:56] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:14:58] any praise think on these things
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; those which ye have both learned and
[1:15:06] received and heard and seen in me do
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; and the God of peace shall be with you.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Sister Hattie Wright sitting around a
[1:15:17] table
[1:15:20] had many needs. We know she had many
[1:15:21] needs in her life
[1:15:24] says in this quote here right the other
[1:15:26] day she didn't ask for nothing.
[1:15:29] She was just sitting there
[1:15:31] but she said the right thing.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; I just want to dwell on this brothers
[1:15:36] and sisters. She didn't ask the right
[1:15:39] thing. He said that at the beginning of
[1:15:41] this quote. She didn't ask for nothing.
[1:15:44] She wasn't holding on to the legs of the
[1:15:46] prophet while he went around knocking on
[1:15:49] on the door, going to his house. She
[1:15:51] wasn't calling him. She wasn't chasing
[1:15:53] him down. She wasn't begging him for a
[1:15:56] need. She didn't ask for nothing. All
[1:15:59] she did was fellowship with him. She was
[1:16:01] just fellowshipping with him.
[1:16:04] She said the right thing.
[1:16:08] which pleased the Holy Spirit. And
[1:16:10] what'd she say?
[1:16:12] We know what she said when brother
[1:16:14] Brandham was talking about the next
[1:16:17] phase of his ministry. He was talking
[1:16:19] about how he had the discernment in in
[1:16:21] in the hands for diseases. He was able
[1:16:25] to tell people what the diseases were by
[1:16:26] touching their hands through the
[1:16:27] vibrations that would happen and the
[1:16:29] bumps that would appear. We know that
[1:16:30] that was the first phase of his
[1:16:32] ministry, the first pull of his
[1:16:33] ministry. the second pull or phase of
[1:16:36] his ministry. He was able to discern
[1:16:38] what was going on in the hearts of men.
[1:16:40] And we heard about it the other night.
[1:16:42] Brother Bradom, he started that changed
[1:16:44] in Regina, Canada. That is where it
[1:16:47] happened. It changed in Canada. And and
[1:16:50] he was able to see what was going on in
[1:16:53] the hearts of men. He was able to
[1:16:55] discern the thoughts and the intents of
[1:16:58] hearts of people. And we know that,
[1:16:59] brother, it's at the point where brother
[1:17:01] Bradom told his friends when he was with
[1:17:03] them, "Tell me some jokes while we're
[1:17:05] driving because I I I just can't turn it
[1:17:07] off. You can't stop the discernment from
[1:17:09] happening." To the point where just
[1:17:12] through oral tradition, I don't even
[1:17:13] think it's in the message of the hour,
[1:17:14] but through other brothers and
[1:17:16] testimonies, they that even when he was
[1:17:18] driving down the road, someone in a car
[1:17:20] going the other direction, he could
[1:17:22] discern what was going on in their heart
[1:17:24] or head. How was that possible? That's
[1:17:26] not brother Brandham. Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; That's not a man. No man could ever do
[1:17:31] that.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; But there was a change in the ministry
[1:17:36] from that even. And here, Brother
[1:17:38] Brandham is sitting around eating cherry
[1:17:40] cobbler talking about this with a cup of
[1:17:43] coffee and just some friends talking
[1:17:45] about the change of the ministry. And
[1:17:47] and and he said, "What was it? Who was
[1:17:49] it that said, didn't you? You say, "I
[1:17:54] want that squirrel to come out this way
[1:17:56] and run down that branch and stand up on
[1:17:58] that fence post like that."
[1:18:01] We know that, brother Brandham, he had
[1:18:03] that whole conversation seemingly with
[1:18:05] himself, but it wasn't with himself. We
[1:18:07] know that it was with the King of Kings
[1:18:09] and Lord of Lords, the very same Holy
[1:18:11] Ghost that we're talking about tonight.
[1:18:13] He had that conversation with him. He's
[1:18:15] explaining this as he's fellowshipping
[1:18:17] around the table. Brothers and sisters,
[1:18:19] don't be don't be afraid to fellowship
[1:18:21] around the word around the table. Invite
[1:18:24] people over, drink coffee, and talk
[1:18:26] about the word of God. Not that we want
[1:18:28] to create a cookie cutter religion. And
[1:18:29] I'm not saying that that's where
[1:18:30] religion is. What I am saying is that
[1:18:32] God knows exactly where we are. He knows
[1:18:35] who we are and the condition that we're
[1:18:36] in, the station that we're at. We don't
[1:18:39] have to have some special place, go to a
[1:18:41] a special height in our spiritual
[1:18:43] journey to be able to fellowship with
[1:18:45] him. He comes right down and fellowships
[1:18:47] with us wherever we are. Sister Hadtie
[1:18:49] Wright was poor.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; They're sitting around a poor person's
[1:18:54] table. Hadty Wright the other day, she
[1:18:55] didn't ask for nothing. She was just
[1:18:57] sitting there, but she said the right
[1:18:58] thing which pleased the Holy Spirit. She
[1:19:02] said as brother Brandham was explaining
[1:19:04] how these squirrels just came into
[1:19:06] existence, how he can't explain it. We
[1:19:08] know it happened nine times. not both
[1:19:12] together, four in one and five in
[1:19:14] another, but how it happened. And he's
[1:19:16] explaining it to her, to them. And she
[1:19:19] just said, "Brother Brandom, that ain't
[1:19:21] nothing but the truth."
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing but the truth. Now,
[1:19:25] she didn't say, "I understand it." She
[1:19:27] didn't say, "I could explain it." She
[1:19:30] just said, "I believe it."
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the same testimony
[1:19:34] for every single bride member of this
[1:19:37] body.
[1:19:40] But you know she said the right thing
[1:19:42] which pleased the Holy Spirit. I just
[1:19:44] want to encourage us tonight brothers
[1:19:45] and sisters be conscious be God
[1:19:48] conscious. Brother Ken used to preach
[1:19:50] that have a God consciousness as we live
[1:19:53] our lives wherever we are. Be conscious
[1:19:55] that God is with us even in us to the
[1:19:58] end of the world
[1:20:00] and say the right thing.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; When we have a God consciousness we're
[1:20:04] going to take every single thought into
[1:20:06] captivity.
[1:20:08] We're not going to give liberty to the
[1:20:09] devil and say, "No, no, no. That genetic
[1:20:11] thing that my great-grandfather had on
[1:20:13] the other side, now I just can't control
[1:20:15] my tongue. I've got a temper. All this
[1:20:17] stuff." No, we're not going to make
[1:20:18] excuses for the devil. This carnality is
[1:20:21] of the devil. That's the reason we're in
[1:20:23] this pest house. Otherwise, we would
[1:20:26] have been products of the spoken word
[1:20:28] being the original seed.
[1:20:31] But we know it was through the fall that
[1:20:32] that we're here. All born in sin.
[1:20:36] can't even help it. The way we come into
[1:20:38] this world, the way God does things is
[1:20:40] just magnificent. We came under a curse.
[1:20:43] That's the way we come into this world
[1:20:44] is under the curse. We know that. We're
[1:20:47] not going to dwell on that tonight. But
[1:20:50] she said the right thing which pleased
[1:20:51] the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit
[1:20:53] spoke back.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? The Holy Spirit
[1:20:59] spoke back and said, "Hattie, ask
[1:21:01] whatever that you will."
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that one place in the
[1:21:06] message he says he says ask for a
[1:21:09] million dollars and see if he won't give
[1:21:11] it to you right now. And here he says
[1:21:14] ask anything that you will whatever you
[1:21:16] got and you want. Ask anything.
[1:21:22] Find out whether this is real or not.
[1:21:24] Ask anything.
[1:21:26] The healing of her little crippled
[1:21:28] sister sitting there all drawn up. And
[1:21:31] he even says that we prayed for her
[1:21:34] multiple times in another quote in the
[1:21:36] message of the hour. We prayed for her
[1:21:38] multiple times and here she sits all
[1:21:41] crippled up. Say the word and she'll be
[1:21:44] free.
[1:21:46] He says $10,000 to keep her from digging
[1:21:50] on them hills over there being being
[1:21:53] stuck in a poor condition having to go
[1:21:55] out and till the soil being a widow
[1:21:57] woman. We know that brother Brandham he
[1:21:59] even went back there to give back some
[1:22:01] of her tithe. That was part of the
[1:22:02] operation of the fellowship.
[1:22:06] And he said, you know, I realized while
[1:22:07] I was there, I just couldn't do it
[1:22:10] because she put her two mites in.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; She gave what she had.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; He said $10,000 to keep her from digging
[1:22:21] on them hills over there. She wouldn't
[1:22:22] have to farm anymore. She could have all
[1:22:25] of the money that she wanted. Whatever
[1:22:27] you want, you can have it. The youth
[1:22:31] restored to her well-run down body.
[1:22:34] Whatever you want to ask, you ask it
[1:22:37] right now.
[1:22:40] If it don't come and give it to you
[1:22:42] right now, then I'm a false prophet.
[1:22:46] He says, "That's that's something, isn't
[1:22:48] it?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something to think about?
[1:22:53] just whatever you want. You ask it and
[1:22:56] he'll give it. I I just love the way
[1:22:58] that this this is worded though. She
[1:23:01] said the right thing. It pleased the
[1:23:02] Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit spoke back.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Brother Brandham speaking
[1:23:08] here.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Brother Brandham speaking
[1:23:11] here. It was the Holy Ghost. It was
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[1:23:16] and forever. And what did she ask for?
[1:23:17] We know what she asked for. She asked
[1:23:19] for the only thing of eternal value. I
[1:23:21] want to see my children when I'm over
[1:23:22] there. I want them to be with me in
[1:23:24] glory.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And we know that the story goes that
[1:23:29] they just came and fell over her lap.
[1:23:31] And brother Bradam talks about in other
[1:23:32] places and says that her children were
[1:23:34] in church serving the Lord, active
[1:23:37] members in the assembly. What a
[1:23:39] tremendous thing it is. He's the same
[1:23:41] yesterday, today, and forever, brothers
[1:23:43] and sisters.
[1:23:45] Even though
[1:23:48] many times we get caught up in our
[1:23:49] situations, we get caught up in our
[1:23:51] lives and think that maybe when this
[1:23:52] happens then I can change and do that.
[1:23:55] Don't worry about whatever is going on.
[1:23:58] Just say the right thing right now.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Just say the right thing right now. And
[1:24:02] I think that many times we can change
[1:24:04] circumstances, situations in our lives
[1:24:07] if we're willing to just change our own
[1:24:10] attitudes.
[1:24:11] If we can change our own attitudes, our
[1:24:14] own behaviors, then we can see things
[1:24:16] happen. You know, we can't change other
[1:24:18] people. We can't change other people. We
[1:24:21] talked about it before. Sometimes
[1:24:22] someone will step on our toes and we'll
[1:24:24] do something. We'll act a certain way
[1:24:26] and we're we're just going to do this
[1:24:27] and and until God changes the situation
[1:24:30] and what we're doing in in that
[1:24:32] situation is just it's like drinking
[1:24:34] poison and waiting for it to take effect
[1:24:35] on the other person. If we're carrying
[1:24:37] around bitterness and and and anger
[1:24:40] about a situation, it's not going to do
[1:24:42] us any good. What we have to do is just
[1:24:44] let it go. Just let it go.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And God will come on the scene. If if we
[1:24:50] say the right thing, I just think that's
[1:24:52] so beautiful. I can't get that out of my
[1:24:53] head. For this saying, go thy way. The
[1:24:56] devil is gone out of thy daughter. My
[1:25:02] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:25:03] forever. And I I just thank the Lord
[1:25:06] when he comes around with the
[1:25:07] inspiration for these services because I
[1:25:10] could not do this on my own. There's no
[1:25:12] way that I could do this. But the
[1:25:15] inspiration comes and uh we just step
[1:25:17] into it. I think it's beautiful for this
[1:25:19] saying, "Go thy way. The devil is gone
[1:25:22] out of thy daughter." Could you imagine
[1:25:24] those words? If we had a daughter and
[1:25:27] the devil was in our daughter, could you
[1:25:29] imagine for this saying, "Go thy way.
[1:25:32] The devil is gone out of thy daughter."
[1:25:35] My, we know that over in Ephesians
[1:25:38] chapter 4, a very familiar scripture,
[1:25:40] verse 29, let no corrupt communication,
[1:25:46] and I looked this up in the lexicon just
[1:25:49] for fun. corrupt, being rotten,
[1:25:52] worthless, literally or morally,
[1:25:56] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:25:59] of your mouth.
[1:26:02] Oh my, you know, we have to take every
[1:26:05] single thought into captivity.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. The first church
[1:26:11] age messenger said that, take every
[1:26:14] thought into captivity. Don't let the
[1:26:17] words get away. Don't let it actually
[1:26:20] trigger our mouth and say, "Well, it's
[1:26:22] just the way I am. I just have this
[1:26:23] thing." The word of God is an
[1:26:26] instructor. Let no corrupt
[1:26:28] communication,
[1:26:30] rotten, worthless, literally or morally,
[1:26:34] proceed out of your mouth, but that
[1:26:37] which is good to the use of edifying.
[1:26:42] I can actually start closing.
[1:26:51] But I won't yet.
[1:26:53] But don't let anything like that proceed
[1:26:54] out of your mouth. But that which is
[1:26:56] good to the use of edifying, to
[1:26:58] encouraging, to building someone up, to
[1:27:01] building a situation up, to encouraging,
[1:27:04] right? To make people feel good. And you
[1:27:08] know, one of the best things that can
[1:27:10] ever happen, brothers and sisters, is
[1:27:12] when you're in a group of people and you
[1:27:15] have a group of people that are talking
[1:27:17] bad about someone or something. They're
[1:27:20] talking bad about it and you don't
[1:27:22] agree. You say, "Nope, I'm not going to
[1:27:25] actually entertain that. I'm not going
[1:27:27] to get involved in that. What I'm going
[1:27:28] to do is the opposite, and I'm going to
[1:27:30] say something nice about that person."
[1:27:32] What's going to happen is you're going
[1:27:34] to change that situation. You're going
[1:27:36] to put a big old crack in that ball of
[1:27:39] hatred. And you know, we know the story
[1:27:42] full well. Spirits travel in words.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; There's some pretty nasty spirits that
[1:27:49] can be contracted. Spiritual viruses
[1:27:51] that can be contracted from corrupt
[1:27:54] communication, especially when it comes
[1:27:56] to talking about other brothers or
[1:27:57] sisters. Let no corrupt communication
[1:28:00] proceed out of your mouth. You can't
[1:28:02] control what other people are doing, but
[1:28:05] you better control this.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; But that which is good to the use of
[1:28:10] edifying that it may minister grace unto
[1:28:12] the hearers.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; We want to minister grace.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And we know the next scripture very
[1:28:20] well. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:28:23] God.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[1:28:26] your redemption. And we know, brothers
[1:28:27] and sisters, when we're sealed, we're
[1:28:29] sealed to the day of redemption. But
[1:28:30] would we want to grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:28:32] who's already sealed us?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:28:37] But we know that full well that we can
[1:28:39] be afflicted in this flesh. We're going
[1:28:41] to be attacked until the day that we lay
[1:28:43] this flesh down. One way or the other.
[1:28:45] Whether we go by the way of the grave or
[1:28:47] whether we go in the rapture, one way or
[1:28:49] another, we're going to lay down this
[1:28:51] robe of flesh. This flesh cannot inherit
[1:28:54] incorruption because this flesh is
[1:28:58] corruption
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; and it's slowly dying.
[1:29:02] But grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:29:04] which means that you could. We don't
[1:29:06] want to do that. Brother Brandham says
[1:29:07] that when we do that, the Holy Spirit
[1:29:09] will just sort of fly away a little ways
[1:29:13] and just go and rest in a maybe a tree
[1:29:14] branch and just say, you know, let me
[1:29:16] know when that that wolf nature is gone
[1:29:19] and and the the the lamb speaking has
[1:29:23] come back and I'll just, you know, come
[1:29:25] back and and be that dove with the lamb.
[1:29:29] But we know full well that the wolf and
[1:29:32] the lamb nature will not dwell together.
[1:29:35] Doesn't happen that way. But grieve not
[1:29:37] the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are
[1:29:39] sealed until the day of your redemption.
[1:29:41] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:29:45] and clamor and evil
[1:29:48] not thinking,
[1:29:50] evil speaking.
[1:29:54] Remember,
[1:29:55] for this saying,
[1:29:58] for this saying,
[1:30:00] for this saying, the devil has left your
[1:30:03] daughter. For this saying the devil has
[1:30:07] left your marriage.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; For this saying the devil has left your
[1:30:12] church. For this saying the devil has
[1:30:15] left your job. For this saying the devil
[1:30:18] has left whatever it is we have need of.
[1:30:20] Brothers and sisters, don't think for a
[1:30:22] second that he is going to be any
[1:30:23] different for us in our lives. What are
[1:30:26] we saying?
[1:30:28] What are we saying? Let all bitterness
[1:30:30] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:30:33] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:30:35] malice. And be ye what? Kind one to
[1:30:40] another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
[1:30:43] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[1:30:46] hath forgiven you.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; How can we hold on to things and think
[1:30:52] that it's going to be okay?
[1:30:55] I've got I've got I've got the right I
[1:30:59] got the right to hang on to this.
[1:31:04] I don't have any right to hang on to
[1:31:05] anything.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; We have to be tender-hearted and
[1:31:08] forgiving
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; one to another. Now, some people might
[1:31:11] say, "Well, we've talked about this
[1:31:13] recently, but I just
[1:31:16] can't forget." No, but we can actually
[1:31:18] choose to forget.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; The memories come back and what are we
[1:31:22] going to do? entertain those memories,
[1:31:24] grab on to them and and host them. Or
[1:31:27] are we going to say, "No, no, no, no.
[1:31:29] You're not going to dominate me. You're
[1:31:30] you will not rule my life. I will not
[1:31:34] allow that program to circulate in my
[1:31:36] mind." Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; We have the ability to do that because
[1:31:39] the word says to take every single
[1:31:41] thought into captivity. Whether it's a
[1:31:43] memory or whether it's a present tense
[1:31:45] situation, we have that ability and we
[1:31:48] can choose to do what the Holy Ghost
[1:31:51] tells us to do with it or not. And it's
[1:31:53] not easy, but I know we can do it. But
[1:31:56] be ye kind one to another,
[1:31:59] tenderhearted,
[1:32:01] forgiving one another, even as God for
[1:32:03] Christ's sake hath forgiven you. I just
[1:32:06] was talking about a situation and I just
[1:32:09] can't let it go. I think it's so good.
[1:32:11] I'm probably going to talk about it in
[1:32:13] the future. And I think it's very
[1:32:14] important in the time in which we live.
[1:32:16] Many times people they joke. We know
[1:32:19] that many times you hear it said that uh
[1:32:22] what is it um sorry
[1:32:27] many a truth is spoken in just that's
[1:32:29] what it is. And people will just volley
[1:32:32] backhander comments and then laugh. It's
[1:32:35] funny. I'll just throw a back smacker at
[1:32:38] you and and then laugh and it'll be
[1:32:40] funny and and it's okay. Right. It's not
[1:32:43] okay.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; That's that's corrupt communication.
[1:32:46] That's
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Because are you being tenderhearted and
[1:32:49] kind to that individual or is it's just
[1:32:51] a joke. We can just do that. It's just
[1:32:53] fine. No, it ain't fine. It's not fine.
[1:32:57] It's not right.
[1:32:59] The word says to be kind one to another.
[1:33:02] How can we actually throw backhanded
[1:33:04] comments, belittling comments, ingest,
[1:33:08] in joke to people, to friends, to
[1:33:11] family, to brothers, to sisters, and
[1:33:14] think that it's actually kind. It's not
[1:33:16] kind.
[1:33:18] But you know, many times what happens is
[1:33:21] people will say, "Well, that's just
[1:33:22] brother so and so and that's just so and
[1:33:24] that's just how they are." What it is is
[1:33:27] nobody has actually called him out and
[1:33:28] said,"You know what? That's not
[1:33:29] acceptable behavior.
[1:33:32] That's not kind and it's not
[1:33:33] tenderhearted." What makes you think
[1:33:35] that it's appropriate to speak that way
[1:33:38] to me? Or what makes you think it's
[1:33:39] appropriate to speak that way about your
[1:33:42] brother or your sister? When the word of
[1:33:44] God says to be kind one to another,
[1:33:46] tenderhearted,
[1:33:48] forgiving one another. Well, that person
[1:33:50] could say, "Well, the word says that
[1:33:52] you're supposed to be forgiving. So, if
[1:33:54] I do those backhander slaps to you, that
[1:33:56] you're supposed to be forgiving." Yeah,
[1:33:58] it's true. You are supposed to be
[1:34:00] forgiving and loving. And sometimes love
[1:34:02] is corrective. Sometimes you have to say
[1:34:05] a truth to actually get the point
[1:34:08] across. But not in in malice, not in
[1:34:11] anger, in kindness to say, "You know
[1:34:14] what? The way you're speaking is
[1:34:16] actually hurtful. It's actually not
[1:34:18] kind. And I don't feel like it's very
[1:34:21] tender-hearted. Sometimes we need to say
[1:34:24] it. Sometimes we need to call it out.
[1:34:27] And you know what I think we can do is
[1:34:29] actually help, brothers and sisters. But
[1:34:31] you know where I wanted to get to
[1:34:33] tonight, brothers and sisters? I've said
[1:34:34] it over and over. I'm going to say it
[1:34:35] one more time. It's for this saying. So
[1:34:38] what's our saying? What's our saying?
[1:34:42] Might seem like a really simple little
[1:34:44] sermon tonight. Okay, just nothing deep
[1:34:47] about it. But you know what are we
[1:34:49] saying? What what is it that we're
[1:34:52] saying? Because if if brother Brandham
[1:34:54] can talk about it this way that you know
[1:34:57] this woman never asked nothing. Sister
[1:34:59] Hattie right never asked nothing. The
[1:35:01] Syphenician woman she did ask but Hadi
[1:35:03] Wright didn't ask. Had he Wright is in
[1:35:05] the age in which we live and we know we
[1:35:07] already talked about it. The vibration
[1:35:08] in the hand, the discernment in the
[1:35:10] heart. Now we're at speak the word.
[1:35:13] We're not worried about speaking
[1:35:15] squirrels into existence, are we? For a
[1:35:18] while, I thought maybe there'll be a
[1:35:19] time where I could see a little animal
[1:35:21] come back to life. Maybe a little fishy
[1:35:23] or something like that. Maybe I'll see
[1:35:25] some supernatural power of God come
[1:35:27] rolling off the mountain and into my
[1:35:29] boat and I'll I'll just witness
[1:35:31] something so magnificently supernatural.
[1:35:34] Remember, Brother Bradom said, "The
[1:35:35] greatest miracle is that a sinner could
[1:35:38] become a saint."
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest miracle, brothers
[1:35:42] and sisters. And it's not some third
[1:35:44] pole manifestation that we're going to
[1:35:45] be able to say, "See, see, there it is.
[1:35:48] We know what's going to happen if that
[1:35:50] happens. Then people will come around,
[1:35:53] the the the rumors will start. You know,
[1:35:55] there's a great ministry up in Edmonton.
[1:35:56] They had this happen and that happened
[1:35:58] and all the other things happen and
[1:35:59] suddenly people are going to start
[1:36:00] wanting to flock there because the power
[1:36:02] of God is moving." We saw it happen just
[1:36:05] with a simple manifestation of speaking
[1:36:07] in tongues and worship down in Ashbury,
[1:36:10] right? or Asbury. Did I say that right?
[1:36:14] But you know what I'm talking about.
[1:36:15] That place, how much more uh uh third
[1:36:18] pole manifestations. It's not a public
[1:36:21] show.
[1:36:22] And I know for sure there's people in
[1:36:24] this room tonight who have witnessed the
[1:36:26] third pole manifestation of this living
[1:36:29] word in their very own lives. I I can
[1:36:33] say that I'm a witness to it. Some
[1:36:34] people might say, "Well, what did you
[1:36:35] create?" I never created nothing, but I
[1:36:37] saw God come on the situation in a way
[1:36:40] that nobody could explain it. I can't
[1:36:41] even explain it, but I know it had to be
[1:36:43] God.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that it's not
[1:36:48] happening. It's very much happening. As
[1:36:50] this world's progressing, that third
[1:36:52] full pull manifestation is fully
[1:36:55] underway in the hearts and lives of
[1:36:57] believers in in every single assembly of
[1:37:00] this true message of the hour. you would
[1:37:03] be able to go from church to church and
[1:37:05] have testimony service after testimony
[1:37:07] service of the power of the living God
[1:37:10] moving in their lives. But we know that
[1:37:13] the only manifestation that we really
[1:37:14] look to is the manifestation of this
[1:37:17] word in our lives. Our ability to say
[1:37:19] amen to every single word that that ma
[1:37:22] manifestation of Revelations 10:7 uh uh
[1:37:26] Luke 17, we know all the scriptures. the
[1:37:28] the prophet of Malachi 4, every single
[1:37:32] word that he brought forward, even if it
[1:37:34] shakes us down to our core, we say amen
[1:37:38] to that word.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; And what happens when that happens is we
[1:37:43] live that word. We become living
[1:37:46] manifestations of that word. The sisters
[1:37:48] don't cut their hair because he said
[1:37:50] don't do it. Why not? Not because I say
[1:37:53] because Paul said to the Corinthian
[1:37:55] church, don't cut your hair.
[1:37:57] It's not just a cultural thing for back
[1:37:59] then.
[1:38:02] Women don't wear clothing that pertains
[1:38:04] to men.
[1:38:06] Men don't wear clothing that pertains to
[1:38:09] women.
[1:38:11] Why? Not because he started some strange
[1:38:15] doctrine out of Kentucky, the backwoods
[1:38:17] of Kentucky, and now there's just a
[1:38:18] bunch of Branommites that follow him.
[1:38:20] No. Every single time he pointed to the
[1:38:22] word and said, "The word says it's
[1:38:24] abomination.
[1:38:27] And it's the exact same word that says
[1:38:29] man don't lie with man nor woman with
[1:38:32] woman. There's no difference.
[1:38:35] So what makes the difference now in
[1:38:37] society for people to say it's okay to
[1:38:40] wear pants. It's okay to wear where
[1:38:44] how could we do that? How could we say
[1:38:45] it's all right when it's not? The word
[1:38:47] of God says it's not. Brother Brandham,
[1:38:49] he wasn't he wasn't bringing a new
[1:38:50] doctrine. The only thing he was doing
[1:38:51] was what prophets do and that's point
[1:38:53] right back to the word of God to say get
[1:38:54] back in line with the word of God. And I
[1:38:56] just can't help but think tonight,
[1:38:57] brothers and sisters, what we're saying
[1:39:00] is going to be exactly what he was
[1:39:01] saying, which is exactly what Paul was
[1:39:03] saying, which is exactly what the spirit
[1:39:05] is saying. The spirit and the bride say
[1:39:08] come. We're not going to be saying
[1:39:10] nothing different than what the Holy
[1:39:12] Ghost is saying, than what any of the
[1:39:14] prophets said in any of the word says.
[1:39:17] We are going to be saying the exact same
[1:39:19] thing. And we are living in the age we
[1:39:22] know of the spoken word.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; The spoken word manifestation.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful. Brother
[1:39:29] Brandham, he says it, you know, in in in
[1:39:31] the message. And uh I didn't want to get
[1:39:33] too far into it, but you know, you can
[1:39:36] actually speak the word in a negative
[1:39:38] way as well. You can destroy a man's
[1:39:40] character just by talking bad about him
[1:39:42] behind his back.
[1:39:45] You can actually hurt people really
[1:39:48] badly. And I say, 'Lord, forgive me if
[1:39:50] I've ever done that. And I say I I'm
[1:39:53] sure that every single one of us would
[1:39:55] feel the same way. We would not want to
[1:39:57] do that to anybody, but we're humans
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and sometimes things happen. And you
[1:40:03] know, when it happens, the believers
[1:40:04] just go make it right. They don't just
[1:40:06] leave it lingering. But I I I think
[1:40:09] tonight, brothers and sisters, just
[1:40:10] recognizing where we are in the age in
[1:40:13] which we live, we we have an attitude of
[1:40:17] preparation. And I think it was so good
[1:40:19] the service we heard with brother Dela
[1:40:21] how how he ministered that word to us an
[1:40:24] attitude of preparation. That's the age
[1:40:26] in which we live in because there is
[1:40:28] going to be a body change. This is the
[1:40:31] countdown days in which we're living.
[1:40:33] And are we in in in three or two or or
[1:40:37] or one or seven? We don't know if it's
[1:40:41] counting down from 10. We don't know
[1:40:43] what number it's at. But it's countdown.
[1:40:45] The countdown time is on. It's already
[1:40:47] started. And we have an attitude of
[1:40:50] preparation. And we know that God
[1:40:51] doesn't do anything outside of his word.
[1:40:54] But he always makes preparation for his
[1:40:57] word, doesn't he? So beautiful. And I I
[1:41:00] know that that we all heard it and I
[1:41:03] think it's important to say it that
[1:41:04] knowing knowing about this word of God
[1:41:07] and preparing for this word of God are
[1:41:10] two different things. knowing that
[1:41:13] there's going to be a rapture and
[1:41:15] preparing for a rapture. They're two
[1:41:17] different things altogether. We can know
[1:41:20] all about it and still not prepare in
[1:41:23] our lives and still not prepare in our
[1:41:25] hearts and in our homes. And you know,
[1:41:27] one day we'll find out that we missed
[1:41:30] it, but to be preparing to know about it
[1:41:33] and to prepare it. And how do we do
[1:41:34] that? We just say, "Lord, search my
[1:41:36] heart and try me. Don't don't don't go
[1:41:39] and fix my brother. Don't go and fix my
[1:41:41] sister. I know that brother has this
[1:41:42] thing in his life and and I know that
[1:41:44] he's wrong and I'm right and blah blah
[1:41:46] blah blah blah. Alls we need to do is
[1:41:48] say, "Lord, change my heart. Come and
[1:41:51] look at me. Get inside here and change
[1:41:53] my heart." When our hearts change,
[1:41:56] something happens. Brothers and sisters,
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; we have the ability to speak the word to
[1:42:02] the situation. And the devil doesn't
[1:42:04] want us getting anywhere near that. What
[1:42:07] I'm talking about tonight, like I said
[1:42:08] earlier, might sound so light and maybe
[1:42:12] fluffy and and and you could put
[1:42:14] whatever adjective you want in there,
[1:42:15] but what's our speech? What are we
[1:42:17] saying? It is not right to be speaking
[1:42:20] wrong. And I I just think it's important
[1:42:22] to say it. It was for this saying that
[1:42:25] Jesus told that woman, for this saying,
[1:42:27] go thy way. The devil is gone out of thy
[1:42:30] daughter.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; So, whatever we have need of tonight,
[1:42:33] brothers and sisters, what are we
[1:42:35] saying? What are we saying? The devil is
[1:42:38] insidious. He doesn't come the way that
[1:42:40] we think he comes.
[1:42:42] He is very, very, very cunning. Brother
[1:42:46] Brandham called him. What a worthy
[1:42:49] adversary. He's created co-equal with
[1:42:52] God. There's no way we're ever going to
[1:42:54] outsmart him. Being associated with the
[1:42:56] message of the hour is actually going to
[1:42:59] put us in hell. But getting that message
[1:43:02] of the hour inside of us is going to
[1:43:05] save us.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; When that happens, brothers and sisters,
[1:43:12] when we get that message inside of us,
[1:43:14] we can speak the word.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; And we can speak the word to every
[1:43:17] situation in our lives. And you know, we
[1:43:20] can speak the word to those devils that
[1:43:21] come around and might try and upset our
[1:43:24] church. They might try and upset our
[1:43:26] marriage. Those devils want the devil
[1:43:28] wants nothing more than to destroy
[1:43:30] marriage. And you know, I'm going to
[1:43:33] preach on that one day. It's coming.
[1:43:35] Like brother Bradam talked about
[1:43:36] marriage and divorce. I'm not going to
[1:43:37] do that because I don't have anything to
[1:43:39] make right to bring correction to. I'm
[1:43:41] not going to do that. But what I do want
[1:43:42] to do is talk about how it's the devil's
[1:43:45] choice. It's his preferred access method
[1:43:48] is to destroy marriage. Brother Bradam
[1:43:50] talks about it in Invasion USA. I'm sure
[1:43:52] it's in that message. He wanted to break
[1:43:54] the backbone of America, didn't he? And
[1:43:56] how did he do it? How do he how did he
[1:43:58] go about it? Just destroying marriages.
[1:44:01] If he could destroy marriages, then he's
[1:44:02] got it. He's got the country licked,
[1:44:04] doesn't he? Now, you look at how many
[1:44:06] children are born without parents, two
[1:44:08] parents, and and they have no idea about
[1:44:11] the way things are supposed to be. And,
[1:44:12] you know, the the the new normal is not
[1:44:16] normal. And and that's the new normal.
[1:44:18] It's it's crazy the way it is, but you
[1:44:20] know, it was the devil's choice right
[1:44:22] from the Garden of Eden.
[1:44:24] All he wanted to do was get in that
[1:44:26] marriage. He knew there was going to be
[1:44:27] a marriage. He he probably knew full
[1:44:29] well, the word of God said there's going
[1:44:31] to be a bride of his own choosing. And
[1:44:34] what the devil thought, well, this will
[1:44:35] be easy. I'll just get in there and I'll
[1:44:37] mix up this marriage here and there'll
[1:44:39] never be anybody that will ever be able
[1:44:42] to worship God the way that they once
[1:44:44] did, the way Adam and Eve did once.
[1:44:48] But we know that nothing can stop the
[1:44:50] word of God from coming to pass. And
[1:44:52] even Satan has no hope of outsmarting
[1:44:56] the Lord.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Not a hope. And we know that through his
[1:45:00] own cunningness that the Lord deceived
[1:45:03] him.
[1:45:05] He sent another human in flesh, didn't
[1:45:07] he? He sent a man that was not born in
[1:45:10] sin or shaped in iniquity. Shaped. Yeah.
[1:45:12] Came into the world speaking lies. We
[1:45:14] know that Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:45:18] in flesh. But the devil could never
[1:45:20] believe that God would step into a
[1:45:22] filthy pest house of a body like a
[1:45:25] human.
[1:45:27] But hasn't he done it again?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll call the musicians as we
[1:45:31] close tonight. You know, brothers and
[1:45:33] sisters, I just want to say remember for
[1:45:36] this saying.
[1:45:38] So what are you saying? What am I
[1:45:40] saying? What are we saying? because it
[1:45:43] was for this saying that her daughter
[1:45:46] was made whole for this saying. And it
[1:45:49] wasn't his saying. It wasn't the
[1:45:50] ministry saying, it was her own saying.
[1:45:53] I think it's just so powerful. My
[1:45:55] goodness.
[1:45:57] Let's just bow in prayer. Maybe stand
[1:45:59] with me as we close. Gracious heavenly
[1:46:02] father, Lord Jesus,
[1:46:04] we're so thankful that you are the same
[1:46:06] yesterday, today, and forever. And Lord,
[1:46:09] you always make preparations.
[1:46:12] Father, you always do things
[1:46:14] deliberately with a purpose. And Father,
[1:46:17] it's up to us to trust you in all that
[1:46:20] you do. And Father, we do. And tonight,
[1:46:23] we're so thankful, Lord, for one more
[1:46:25] time we've heard your word. And one more
[1:46:27] time, Lord, we can say, "Be it unto me
[1:46:30] according to thy word."
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Because I could see myself as that
[1:46:35] cyrophenician woman. I I understand that
[1:46:38] I'm a dog. I understand that uh uh
[1:46:42] outside of your grace, I'm nothing.
[1:46:46] But Lord, you chose to come by here. You
[1:46:49] chose to come by my way. You chose to
[1:46:51] cross my path and introduce yourself
[1:46:53] personally to me. And Lord, Father, I
[1:46:56] pray that you would just allow me, Lord,
[1:46:58] to come back to you one more time and
[1:47:01] just say, Lord, please forgive me for
[1:47:04] everything in my heart, for every sin in
[1:47:06] my life, Lord. Let me not have any
[1:47:07] iniquity in my life, Lord. in my heart,
[1:47:10] in my mind. Oh, Father, when those
[1:47:13] memories come around, help me to dismiss
[1:47:15] them, Lord Jesus.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Because if you help me, I'll be able to.
[1:47:20] But Lord, our biggest problem is not
[1:47:23] surrendering our lives unto you, Father.
[1:47:26] Not surrendering our problems unto you.
[1:47:29] Father, I pray that tonight, Lord, we
[1:47:31] could do what Paul said, that I could
[1:47:33] die daily. that this pest house could
[1:47:36] die out daily and that your spirit would
[1:47:39] live through me, Lord. That the the
[1:47:42] wills and the desires that I have, Lord,
[1:47:45] that I could just put them down. That
[1:47:46] they would no longer rule me. That they
[1:47:49] would no longer reign in this life. But
[1:47:52] Lord, that you would have the
[1:47:54] preeminence in my life like you've never
[1:47:56] had before. that Lord Jesus, I would see
[1:48:00] that when I speak, oh Father, it's as
[1:48:03] good as you speaking,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; that I could recognize what adoption
[1:48:07] truly means. It doesn't mean that I can
[1:48:10] just behave one way one day and be
[1:48:12] totally different the next day and still
[1:48:14] be just that son of God.
[1:48:18] Oh, Father, that we could move into that
[1:48:21] place of adoption, that we could move
[1:48:22] into that place of full maturity where
[1:48:25] we could recognize for for my saying, oh
[1:48:29] Lord, that it would be you speaking
[1:48:32] through us.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to take this book
[1:48:35] and eat it up, Lord, knowing that it's
[1:48:38] going to make our bellies bitter, that
[1:48:40] this flesh just cannot stand it.
[1:48:44] But Lord Jesus, we know that our souls
[1:48:48] require it.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; So Father, tonight we just commit the
[1:48:51] word that was spoken into your hands.
[1:48:53] Lord, we just commit the lives here,
[1:48:55] Father, into your hands for your care.
[1:48:57] And Lord, we just ask that you would
[1:48:59] just watch over us and keep us as we go
[1:49:02] our separate ways, Lord. Father, we pray
[1:49:04] that you would be with those who
[1:49:06] couldn't be here tonight, Father.
[1:49:08] Wherever they are, whatever they're
[1:49:10] doing, Father, whatever their need is,
[1:49:12] Lord, help them to recognize that
[1:49:15] Father, for this saying, the devil could
[1:49:17] leave their situation, too.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; We know that there is a liberty and
[1:49:23] Father, we thank you for it because it's
[1:49:25] only because of you. Tonight, Lord
[1:49:28] Jesus, we just love you and we thank you
[1:49:30] for your goodness and your mercy to us.
[1:49:32] We just ask all these things now. In
[1:49:35] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:49:38] Amen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God.
[1:49:49] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:49:57] Make it ever
[1:50:00] true.
[1:50:04] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:50:12] May I be like you.
[1:50:16] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:50:19] Change my heart, oh
[1:50:22] God.
[1:50:26] Make it ever
[1:50:29] true.
[1:50:34] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:50:41] May I be like you.
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:49] You are the potter.
[1:50:55] I am the clay.
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:03] Oh, mold me and make
[1:51:07] me.
[1:51:10] This is what I pray.
[1:51:17] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:51:24] Make it ever
[1:51:26] true.
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:31] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:38] May I be like you.
[1:51:44] Amen. Can we sing 896? Lead me, Lord.
[1:51:50] Lead me, Lord.
[1:51:53] It's hard to take the first step
[1:51:58] when I don't know the way.
[1:52:02] Each step is so uncertain.
[1:52:07] I learn to walk by faith.
[1:52:11] But you gave me the promise
[1:52:16] that you will never leave.
[1:52:20] you would lead and guide me.
[1:52:24] Lord, I do believe.
[1:52:29] Lead me, Lord,
[1:52:33] I
[1:52:35] will follow.
[1:52:38] Lead me, Lord,
[1:52:42] I
[1:52:43] will go.
[1:52:45] Oh, you have called me.
[1:52:51] I have answered.
[1:52:55] Lead me Lord.
[1:52:58] I
[1:53:00] will go
[1:53:05] for me are perfect.
[1:53:08] I never need to fear.
[1:53:12] For though sometimes I feel alone, I
[1:53:16] know that you are here.
[1:53:20] My heart just wants to follow.
[1:53:24] I'm willing to obey.
[1:53:29] Take my hand and lead me. I'll follow
[1:53:34] all the way.
[1:53:37] Lead me, Lord.
[1:53:41] I
[1:53:43] will follow.
[1:53:46] Lead me, Lord.
[1:53:50] I
[1:53:51] will go.
[1:53:55] You have called me.
[1:53:59] I haveed.
[1:54:03] Lead me, Lord.
[1:54:06] I
[1:54:08] will go.
[1:54:11] Can we sing 373?
[1:54:14] The more that I surrender.
[1:54:19] The more that I surrender,
[1:54:24] the lighter
[1:54:26] my load.
[1:54:29] The more that I release my cares. The
[1:54:34] more you take control,
[1:54:38] the more that I can humble myself, the
[1:54:43] more you lift me up.
[1:54:47] Every day I live. Lord, I love you more.
[1:54:54] Is that your confession?
[1:54:57] The more that I surrender,
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] the lighter my load.
[1:55:06] The more that I release my cares, the
[1:55:11] more he takes control.
[1:55:16] The more that I can humble myself, the
[1:55:20] more he lift me up.
[1:55:24] Every day I live, Lord, I love you more.
[1:55:31] Can we sing 619?
[1:55:34] Glory to His name.
[1:55:36] Down at the cross.
[1:55:39] Oh, down at the cross where my Savior
[1:55:44] died. Oh, down where for cleansing from
[1:55:49] sin I cried.
[1:55:52] There to my heart was that blood
[1:55:56] applied.
[1:55:58] Oh glory.
[1:56:00] Thank you Lord.
[1:56:04] Oh glory.
[1:56:06] Glor his name.
[1:56:11] Gloryy
[1:56:12] to his wonderful
[1:56:16] name. Clear to my heart was the blood
