We're here to raise our voices in praise and adoration to him. Let's stand as we start our service this morning. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's worthy to be praised. I was thinking of &gt;&gt; Elizabeth being greeted by Mary as she came up when she was pregnant with Jesus. That baby was born, still born as far as I know. And uh Elizabeth and John the Baptist leapt at the name of Jesus. Think about that this morning as we lift up this beautiful, wonderful, matchless name of the Lord Jesus this morning. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, he is worthy to be praised and adore. Oh, so we lift up holy hands in one accord, singing, blessed be thy name. Oh, blessed be that name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, he is worthy to be praised and adored. Oh soul we lift up holy hands in one accord. Oh singing blessed be the name. Oh blessed be thy name. Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. So we lift up holy hands in one accord. Oh, singing. Blessed be thy name. Oh, blessed be thy name. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. What a beautiful name it is. What a beautiful name it is. and the name of Jesus Christ my king. What a beautiful name it is. Nothing compares to this. What a beautiful name it is. The name of Jesus. Death cannot hold. Death could not hold you. vtory before you s [Applause] [Music] raise your glory for you to have the Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, what a power. [Music] What a power.

Oh, what a powerful name is that Jesus Christ my king. What a powerful name it is. Oh, nothing can say. What a powerful name is that name of Jesus. You may pray with me if you will this morning. [Music] Lord Jesus, as we come before you this morning, Lord, I trust in our hearts. Lord, there's one desire that we have and that's to lift up your name, Lord. Father, may we not not that we don't love each other, but Lord, may we not may we not be swayed by someone sitting beside us whether I should worship you the way you deserve to be. &gt;&gt; But Lord, may it be a personal thing, you sitting beside us. Lord, if the Lord Jesus was sitting beside me, standing beside me this morning, how would I worship him? And Lord, that's the physical form. The fact is that same pillar of fire that appeared above our prophet that appeared above Moses with Moses in the burning bush. Lord, that same prophet that that that or that same pillar of fire that appeared to Paul is here today, Lord. You are here in our midst because you promised it. And Lord, we brought all our licks of fire together for one purpose, and that's to lift your name. Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're here for that. Forgive us for apathy, Lord. It's a it's a spirit of the age. Son, all all of us fight it constantly. Lord, may you forgive us for it. For the Leodysian spirit of lukewarmness. Oh God, you're the king of Salem. You're the one that appeared to Abraham, that great Melzdc, Lord. Father, that's the one we're worshiping. We're not here to impress each other, Lord. But if the King of Kings is in our midst, how ought we to try and impress you, Lord? &gt;&gt; You're the one that took the price, Lord. You hung on that cross, nails ripping through your flesh, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, you died the most horrible, horrific death for us. And Lord, that life that was in that blood that spilled on the earth redeemed everything in that earth and redeemed us all. Lord, we stand as redeemed before the Lord Jesus this morning. Receive our worship, Lord. Oh God, may it be a sacrifice, Lord. It is a sacrifice. It's something that we have to press into, Lord. That's true. But may you receive that sacrifice of praise from each lip here this this morning, Lord. Every heart, Lord. And Father, if there's somebody here that needs an extra, as it were, an extra dose of the Holy Spirit, Father, may you just do that for them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, may the worship, as we heard from our pastor with the with the youth night, how David could could with his music could set the the demons on on on flight. Lord, Father, may we realize that the spirit of music, the the love of you and the music together with our voices, Father, David could sit before Saul, a man possessed and and those demons would have to flee. Lord, may we may we do that. May we recognize with the power of our voice, with the desire and the spirit in us to worship you, what it can do. Lord, set the demons on on on a run. Lord, we we just rebuke every unclean spirit here this morning from us, Lord. May we we brought it in from this Leodysian world. Forgive us, Lord. But we we rebuke every unclean spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus that we could lift your name in worship the way you deserve to be. Grant these mercies, we pray. Receive our worship. We love you so much, Lord. We can only say that because you first loved us. Blessed be your name, Lord. Blessed be your name. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats tonight. Wonderful to be a Christian this morning. &gt;&gt; Why don't we let our praises &gt;&gt; and have it the praise may this building and have it to praise the people.

Let's bow our heads and hearts. Oh father, how we love you, Lord. Father, there is nothing in this world more worthy &gt;&gt; to be loved &gt;&gt; than you, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; We love you with all of our being, Lord. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You came down, Father. You died for us, Lord. &gt;&gt; We accept it, Lord. &gt;&gt; We accept the benefits, Father, of it. &gt;&gt; Not only that, Lord, you said you poured all of him in us. &gt;&gt; You come and you claimed us, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why we love you, Lord. There's nothing else in this world, Father, that we desire to devote our whole lives, our whole beings, everything we say and do. Father, &gt;&gt; it's to show you that we love you. Forgive us, Father, of our mistakes, Father, and our failures. Lord, Father, that testimony is building in us that we do nothing. We say nothing unless first we see our husband say it first. We only do that which is pleasing to you. That is the testimony, Father, we desire to have in our lives, Father, Lord. And we know, Father, based on that testimony, the true revelation of that, Father, when it is fully revealed in us, Father, &gt;&gt; Father, we'll go home. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we'll go home, Lord. &gt;&gt; We have to come to that realization, Father. And that is why we're here today, Lord, to once again hear the word of life broken, brought forth to us to eat and consume, to see it made manifest in our lives. Father, Lord, receive our worship, Father. Receive our praise. Thank you, Father, for the musicians and the song leaders, the trustees. Father, Lord, everyone that makes this so easy, Father, to just come, Father, and sit at your feet and worship freely all of the things that happen behind the scenes. Thank you, Father, for the human effort, Lord, knowing it's your spirit motivating and moving, Father. And we do it because we love you. And because we love you, Father, we love your body. Father, as a part of our worship and praise, Father, we bring our tithes and offerings, Father. Receive it, Father. Lord, bless us, Father, so we can give more, Lord, for your kingdom, Father, for your benefit, Lord. That is our true desire, Father, just to see your kingdom made manifest in the earth, Father. Lord, thank you, Father. We love you, Father. and we commit the remainder of this service into your hands. We welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, his love. Oh, he takes good care of me. Oh yes, his love. Oh yes, he takes good care of me. Oh, [Music] and the rain fall and storms are on the sea.

I love the way you find me. I love the way you find me. And when I look into your eyes, from deep within, my spirit cries, I love the way you father me. Before such love, I stand amazed. I never will. through endless days. I love the way you father me. Father me forever. You father me. And in your embrace I'll be forever secure. [Music] I love the way you father me. I love the way you father me. I love the way you found the me. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Brother Farah. Wonderful. Just so personal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just what do you say to that? Just thank you, my brother. Just brought an atmosphere. You talk about a song to drive away demon spirits. That one is is special. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Stand if you if you would. Don't you love the way he fathers you? &gt;&gt; You know, when we make mistakes, &gt;&gt; he's not like the world so often just puts it's like the devil puts his heel on your neck and just forces you down. Instead, he embraces you. He says, "Come on back. You're a prodal. Just come on back. I'll start running towards you before you start running towards me. I'll start running towards you." That's our God. That's the way he fathers us. Think about that this morning as we sing Jesus your name. Well, Jesus, your name is power. Jesus, your name is mine. And oh Jesus your name will break every struggle. Jesus your name is life. Jesus your name is healing. [Music] Oh Jesus your name gives [Music] Jesus your name will every captive Jesus your name is alive brother Toby oh yes Jesus your name is holy Oh Jesus, your name is Jesus your name.

Oh Jesus, your name is [Music] I love you, Lord. So Rocky, you love me. Love you, Lord. [Music] And I my toship you all my soul my soul rejoice. Oh, take your king. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] One more time. Oh yes, I love you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Listen [Music] that once more. Tell him how much you love him. Oh, Lord, we love you for all your mercies and grace of recognize his presence this morning to worship. Oh my soul, So, [Applause] so take your [Music] will you take joy for you. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Let's give him a hand of praise this morning. You know this week I was thinking about worship and asking myself why do we as humans have a nudge in us to worship and most of the time you realize that when we are in awe of someone their personality their abilities the things they can do that triggers worship. &gt;&gt; That's why people worship soccer stars. That's why people worship musicians because they do something that you're not able to do. But you compare what God is able to do &gt;&gt; and what God has done &gt;&gt; to what anyone can do. So if you're thinking about who who truly deserves worship &gt;&gt; is our father in heaven that truly deserves worship. &gt;&gt; May you help us to truly have that sense of worship. May you help us. May you bring us to the consciousness of what we're doing whenever we say that we're worshiping God. Welcome to church this morning. The Lord bless you. We thank the Lord for the privilege to be able to stand before you. We want to thank our pastor as well and want to thank everyone for coming. If you are not here, there will be no one to preach to. Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer before we go into the word. Father, we are grateful for the privilege to be here. &gt;&gt; You said to Moses, "Gather the people together and I, the Lord, will give them water." We are here to step out of the way and we're asking you to take control this morning. Father, the thought you place in my heart for your people, I cannot deliver it myself. But when your spirit comes and delivers it there, Lord, it will meet every need. &gt;&gt; So I ask Lord Jesus that you take me out of the way. &gt;&gt; I ask Lord Jesus Christ that you take my senses out of the way, &gt;&gt; my thoughts, my memory, take it entirely out of the way. your people, Lord, that you will be speaking to, Lord. May you open up their hearts to receive from you. &gt;&gt; May you discern their thoughts by your word. &gt;&gt; May you, Lord Jesus, meet their needs according to your riches and glory. &gt;&gt; That at the end of this service, our testimony will be that the Lord was gracious to us. Let it be, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We ask in your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. The Lord bless you. If you quickly pick up your Bible, we'll uh take readings from three portions of the scripture. We'll start from Matthew chapter 6. All of these are familiar scriptures to us. Matthew chapter 6. I'm going to read from verse 7. This was the first sermon that Jesus Christ preached. And he has said a lot in chapter five and he get into chapter six talking about how we should pray and how we should not be like the hypocrites that try to stand and you know show everyone that they're praying talking about those that fast and how they try to let everyone see that they're fasting and then he started to speak to his disciples and tell them about how to pray. So I'll start from verse seven. It says, "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heen do, for they think that they shall be heard, for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your father knoweth what things ye have need of &gt;&gt; before ye ask him." He then says, "After this manner, therefore, pray ye, our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name." &gt;&gt; I'll be taking my title from the middle of that verse. My title is our father which art in heaven. &gt;&gt; So, it's a title you can never forget. If you want to remember, just remember the very first phrase of the Lord's Prayer. Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 6. We'll take the first four verses. And as we go on, you probably start to guess where we're going this morning. It's not so much about talking about prayer this morning. I'd asked brother Farah, brother John to sing that song that I have known for many years, but it's an expression of how God is a parent. And today we're going to be asking ourselves as parents, how are we parenting our children? I know the sisters talked about that yesterday, but just to be entirely open, this has been placed in my heart for about 6 months and uh I knew the Lord at an appointed time and so this is the appointed time. Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1-4. Paul speaking here says to the Ephesians, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Horn thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it says, "And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll quickly read the last scripture. Colossians chapter 3 verse 20 and 21. Paul saying similar things to the church in Colossus. He said, "Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged." May the Lord bless the reading of his word in Jesus name. Amen. Please have your seat. The first place we read in Matthew, Jesus Christ was speaking to his disciples and teaching them how to pray. And I was thinking about this. There are many ways Jesus could have taught us how to pray. There are many ways he could have taught us how to address the the the almighty God that we serve. He could have told us to say, "Oh Jehovah, oh mighty God." There's so many things um many ways all the seven redemptive names that that prayer could have been started with. But Jesus Christ was trying to point us to the relationship that we have with our heavenly father &gt;&gt; so that when we come to him we come with a consciousness of sunship. Amen. &gt;&gt; We come with a consciousness of being a child and we come with a consciousness of the responsibility that he has over us by being our father. Now we know that if we want to think about um perfection, God is the expression of perfection. So in any role we have in life, if you can find how God does it or you find how God did it, that will be the measure. Because if you keep reading on in um in in Matthew, I believe chapter 6, Jesus Christ started to tell, you know, um teaching the first principles of our our faith. He was telling the disciples, it said in chapter five, you know, the beatitudes and then in chapter six, telling us how to live our lives, the very basic things. If somebody ask you to go a mile, go two miles with them. But he stressed something. He hit something like as you continue to read down, he said that all the things I'm asking you to do, I'm just paraphrasing here. He said, "Do it because you are the children of your heavenly father." &gt;&gt; We're going to get into some of those things this this morning. And then we see Paul coming to, you know, he had Paul wrote a lot about mysteries as well. He told the people that there's certain things that God has shown him that has been hidden since the foundation of the world but now being revealed. But as Paul was teaching them and unveiling those mysteries to them, he was also telling them how to live their lives. Now, he was telling the fathers, he said, "Don't provoke your children to wrath." Um, and uh the word father, we're going to get to it. Um I'm not speaking to the fathers alone because the word can also translate to parents, right? Um Deuteronomy, you know, um Moses was speaking here. He said, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But those things which are revealed. Now those things when they are secret, they are mysteries. &gt;&gt; Everybody agree? &gt;&gt; Are we in church this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we in church this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when you say amen, it encourages the preacher. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It makes them know that you are listening and uh it's it's getting it's coming across. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Moses was saying that God has secret things, but God does not keep all of them secret. God reveals some of them. Now he tells us for what purpose? He said those things which God has revealed, they belong to us, &gt;&gt; right? And to our children forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we may do all the words of this law. &gt;&gt; There is a doing that comes after the revelation of the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Bram told us in a man running from the presence of the Lord, he said, "Dear Jesus," he was praying here, "help us tonight in this few words, as we wait upon thee, and we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us, Lord, and tender our hearts. Move back all the shocks and thorns, the thieves. Let the blessed sunshine of God fall in upon the word, Lord. And may we have such a great meeting till there will not be an unsaved person among us. All the children will be in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; He said those without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it. Father, you want to say amen this morning. &gt;&gt; He said may all the great mysteries the great mysteries that we are supposed to know in this age there are mysteries that were that were withheld in the time of John. that is for us to know in this age. And we believe that those mysteries have been revealed and whenever we come to church, whenever the pastor is preaching, whenever a minister is preaching, those mysteries have been unveiled personally to us. Now we need to understand the purpose for it. May all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age, Lord, be unveiled to us and we will see the plainness of God &gt;&gt; where God is no more a mystery to us. For what purpose? So that we'll know how to behave ourselves. It comes down to behavior. &gt;&gt; If I will go a little bit ahead of myself this morning, our behavior amongst our neighbors &gt;&gt; who are the closest neighbors to us, our wife and children, &gt;&gt; those are the closest neighbors to us. The reason why we have an edge over others, over the Pentecostals, over all the ages that were gone that did not know all the secrets of God that God withheld and was given to this age. It's not so that we are intellectual. &gt;&gt; It's not so that we can argue. &gt;&gt; It's not so that we can come and have a conversation with someone and show them how every scripture ties together. Those things are good. But the purpose for it as the prophet is telling us is that so that we'll know how to behave ourselves and act &gt;&gt; action correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word. &gt;&gt; So we take all of that and we have to go and see how it applies to our behavior. And what that means is that our behavior should surpass the behaviors of those that did not know as much as we know. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; That we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is a very common quote. Our pastor read it many times as we were going through the study of this church age book. Abraham said, "When the Methodists failed, God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until in this last day, there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age." &gt;&gt; How are we going to be the final voice to the final age? Is he about going to say that we believe a prophet that God sent a prophet? Let's see what brother Abraham said in the message revelation chapter 4 part three. He said he was talking about you know revelation where John said that um he heard the voice of God and then he heard thunderings. A brother was telling us that the voice of God means thunder like thunder when God speaks it thunders. Now he was saying that here he said all right here was voices. How we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's replace that with Calgary. How we need in Calgary thousands of lived voices. He didn't just call them voices. He called them lived voices &gt;&gt; where the word is becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; Right? The reason I'm going through this introductory part is just to set um um help us understand why we are going to look at the things we're going to look at this morning. &gt;&gt; How many parents are in the house? &gt;&gt; Okay. How many potential parents are in the house? &gt;&gt; There are many potential parents. Right? So if you think it doesn't apply today, just note it down. And being a parent is not just being a dad or a mom. There are many non-dads and many non-Moms that are parents. &gt;&gt; And being a dad doesn't mean you're a father. Being a mom does not mean you are a mother. We're going to look at the definition of a father this morning. And you're going to see that it's much more than just giving birth to children. There are people that might not have had children in this world, but God has placed them in a role to father a child or to mother a child. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said, "We need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices, the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we're talk you're talking about the mysteries, you're talking about the thunders, the the reality is those things are good. We need to know them &gt;&gt; but it needs to do something in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The raw material is the thunder. &gt;&gt; The final product is the lived voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The way I'm living my life &gt;&gt; now. Brother said sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in earth today in the earth today without a blemish. He said, "Yes, sir. Real Christians, that's the thunder against the enemy. The devil don't care how loud you holler. &gt;&gt; The devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout, but what hurts the devil?" &gt;&gt; How many people want to hurt the devil this morning? &gt;&gt; How many people want to go back home and hurt the devil? The devil hurts us so bad. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't take a break from hurting the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. because it doesn't take a break from hurting us. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bram is telling us how to hurt the devil. What hurts the devil is to see that sanctified life, &gt;&gt; holy life, consecrated to God, &gt;&gt; say anything to him, call him anything, just as sweet as he can be and move right on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my, that throws him away. It throws the devil away." Why? That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Now God is a father but God was not a father from the very start. Brother Bramble tell us that when God dwelt by himself when he was Elohim he had attributes in himself. He had a lot of attributes. He had the attribute of being a savior which is a potential of being a savior of being a healer of being a deliverer. But the conditions were not right for God to manifest those attributes. Every child has a potential to be an adult. A little baby has a potential to be a father someday. But if the conditions don't develop to that point, it's not possible for those potentials to finally be expressed. So that's how it was for God. And that's why God allowed the fall. So God allowed the fall. He allowed the fall to happen so he can be a savior. He allowed the fall to happen so he can be a healer. He allowed the fall to happen so he can be a deliverer. But he also allowed the fall to happen so he can father us. &gt;&gt; He was a father before the fall happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But to be able to translate all the, you know, brother Paul was saying a few things after the song was sang this morning, just speaking from the lyrics of that song. But one of the things you realize that makes God a good father is the fact that we don't have to run back to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; the love is so strong. &gt;&gt; If the fall did not happen, we will still appreciate that God loves us. &gt;&gt; But we will not appreciate it to the extent that we appreciate it after we fell and he redeemed us. &gt;&gt; That's why the songwriter says that there is a song that holy angels cannot sing. &gt;&gt; The song called Amazing Grace, angels cannot relate to it. When we are singing the song of the redeemed, the angels will not be able to relate to it because they never fell. So our own type of love that we experienced from our father is much greater than their own love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you never been a prodigal &gt;&gt; that was welcome back home, &gt;&gt; you never actually you've not known the extent to which that father can love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God had all these attributes, but the Bible will tell us in in in adoption number two. He said, he said, "Let me draw you a little illustration here." &gt;&gt; It's good we go back. I believe I talked &gt;&gt; on in a little bit the other night or struck it in Genesis 1st chapter 126 when God called his name the Lord. It's in the word of Ela Elohim, which means the selfexisting one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was nothing else existed but him. There was no air. There was no lights. There was no stars. There was no wall. There was no nothing else. It was God and God alone. Ll Elohim. Now he made that inside of that was attributes which meant inside of this great LL Elohim was an attribute. You know what an attribute is or let me say it like this was a nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's so the little fellow will get it. I'm going I'm and I'm one of the little fellows that has got to get it that way. Inside of him was the nature to be a father. &gt;&gt; Is self-existent. There ain't there ain't nothing for him to be a father by because at that time there was no he didn't have Adam. He didn't have Eve. So he was just by himself alone. There were no angels. So he could not be a father. And now down inside of that was something else that he was God and God is an object of worship but he was self-existent. Ll Elohim. So there was nothing to worship him inside of that. It was a savior and there was nothing to be saved. Inside of that he was a healer. See, but there was nothing sick to be healed. Wasn't nothing to be sick. Now do you get the picture? So his attributes, his nature produced what is today. &gt;&gt; So we can say here that God has demonstrated fatherhood. &gt;&gt; Have we all experience the fatherhood of the father? &gt;&gt; Have we all experienced it? &gt;&gt; Now let's look at the word father. what it means in the uh lexicon uh the original word it's pronounced patai and it means it could be it could mean father it could mean heavenly father it could mean ancestor elder senior um Strong's exhaustive concordance would use the word father or parent and now this is where I want us to that you know I want us to pay attention. It says that father means one who imparts life and is committed to it. So he imparts life &gt;&gt; and is committed to imparting life. &gt;&gt; Now listen it said a progenitor bringing into being to pass on the potential for likeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. it brings into being to pass on the potential for likeness. I was on a call with my dad yesterday, my dad and mom yesterday and um I gave the phone to my son Matias and and my dad looked at him and said, "Hey, Matias, you're looking more like your dad now. Did I have to do anything to make my son look like me? Did I have to mold him in a certain way to make his face look like have my resemblance?" No. It's just that because it's my son, the potential is there. &gt;&gt; But as we start to talk about character, &gt;&gt; I have work to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So likeness is beyond looks. &gt;&gt; Likeness comes down to character. So being a parent, we have the ability to bring into being to pass on the potential for likeness. &gt;&gt; We have the ability to transfer character &gt;&gt; so that it can be carried on. &gt;&gt; That is why David could say that we have a goodly heritage. &gt;&gt; What's an heritage? Heritage is an inheritance. Something you've passed down from generation to generation. Our goodly heritage is not cars. It's not homes. It's is not material things as Christians. Our goodly heritage is to be able to pass on the Lord, the baptism of the Holy Ghost to our children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't give it to them, but we can create an atmosphere. We can do our part so that God can do his own part. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first time you will see in the Bible where God was referred to as a father is in Exodus 4:22. This is when he was telling Moses to go to Pharaoh and he said, "And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, thus seeth the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn." We know that brother Ram told us that Adam was a son. God will come and fellowship with Adam and Eve in the garden. We know that that that but the first time it was referred to as father where God will admit that I have a son. You find that in Exodus. Now let's start to look at God's approach to parenting. How does God parent us? The very first thing you find is God shows his children love and affection. Love and affection. I'm sorry. Sorry, I should have done a slide deck so that you can follow along. But I don't want to restrict myself so that the anointing can flow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I mean but if you if you want like I I have the notes I can share. There's nothing that's that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So um I'm happy to share the notes after but you're welcome to take notes as well. So God shows his love and affection to his children. And we can see this know many places in the scriptures in Osir 11:1 he was talking about Israel and he said when Israel was a child then I loved him and called my son out of Egypt in 1 John 3:1 very common scripture said behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we shall be called the sons of god. &gt;&gt; Isaiah tells us um can a woman forget a suckling child? God was saying, "I will not forget you." Even if a woman could. So, he's showing us love and affection. But the question is, how does God communicate love and affection? &gt;&gt; Now, God communicates love and affection through fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother said in the message, fellowship. He said, "Fellowship, wonderful thing." said, "Now, why does men like fellowship? Why is it men like to meet with men? Women meet with women. We all like to meet together. The ladies meet together and so and talk and the men go to the table and they have things in common that they like to talk about that come from somewhere." Brother Abraham is telling us that the desire we have to fellowship, no human is built to be an island. That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; No human is built to be an island. Right. We got to fellowship. Now, brother Abraham said that come from somewhere. What makes you love your children? &gt;&gt; He said because you are a father. &gt;&gt; That's the strain, human strain. That's the reason it proves that we have a heavenly father that loves we his children. All the things is now made of things that was. All the things now made of things that was. The Bible said there's nothing new in the world. Now in the beginning when God made a man, he didn't make him to be sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't make him to have cancer. He never made him to die. &gt;&gt; He made him for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So our children were also made for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Great. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'll take permission from my family. I might get a bit personal because I know the Lord has been dealing with me, you know, on this as well. So, I'm not coming to preach to people. I'm preaching to myself. &gt;&gt; And if the Lord gives you something from it, please take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we try to get feedback from our children. Um, I never remembered anytime my parents did that with me. Call me into a room and say, "Tell, give me feedback about I'm parenting you." um it didn't happen and I don't I don't say that that was wrong. It's just times are different now. We we need to approach things differently. &gt;&gt; So we try to ask the kids, you know, give us feedback. What do you think we could do better? Um and one of the kids was telling my wife that I think we should have more family time. I think we should have more time. We should do more board games. And in my mind, I'm like, I thought he will want to have more screen time, &gt;&gt; which they really do want to have. I mean, if you give them endless hours, they could be on screen, but brother Bram was telling us here that God made us for fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we ignore them and give them all the screen time, don't ever think that deep down in their mind they don't want to spend time with dad and mom. &gt;&gt; I know our pastor has talked about that. I know that's the reason why he's away today, right? Fellowship. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Abraham said, now in the evening was talking about God and his children. God came down and had fellowship with Adam and Eve. They loved God. God loved them. He didn't want them to be sick, get old, and die. He wanted to be young and lovely forever. Wanted them to be young and lovely forever. But sin brought us here, not God. It's against God's will. &gt;&gt; Now, we live in this modern world that doors everything to keep us from fellowshipping with our children. &gt;&gt; Everything possible. &gt;&gt; We have bills to pay. We have work to do. When you're done working, there are things to do in the house. You you're you're spent by the end of the day. &gt;&gt; Kids go to school, they come back, the day is over, and it repeats itself. When it's the weekend, you want to sleep in. So a lot of parents report that they feel time starved because of demanding work schedules and that leads to stress and reduces the quality time they have with children. And just to say fellowship does not mean being together in the same room. I think our world tells us that that is true because everyone can be in the same room but each one can be fellowshipping somewhere else &gt;&gt; on their devices. So the model currents I don't know it's it's we're still like 21st century but when we bring it to this time and age this AI world whatever you call it the model family is a family that's sitting together in the same living room but everyone is on a device that is connecting them to someone else. &gt;&gt; Fellowship means companionship. &gt;&gt; Amen. it and it also means company. Now people also talk about technology distractions. Of course the rise of smartphones and other devices has led to what is called tenno friends. Ten tech techno friends. Yeah. Where parents attention is divided potentially affecting the quality of interactions with their children. It's called techno friends. So pretty much what I is not conference conference is is different because conference you're together and you're having interaction together. Techno friends is half technology half conference. So divided attention. I'm in the room. My kids are speaking to me. I'm trying to answer them but I'm so locked up on my phone that I'm not actually listening to them. That is not God's approach to fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's not God's approach to parenting. &gt;&gt; A lot of parents also talked about perceived time deficits, which means never enough time in a day. And I can relate to that because I asked myself if I had 40 48 hours in a day, it probably wouldn't still be enough cuz there's so much to do. There's work to do. Kids go for music. I have my music goals. I have to spend time with my wife. I have to spend time with family. There chores to do and you don't have enough time. Why am I bringing this? Because these are the battles that we fight every day. &gt;&gt; Now know that God does not put this condition in place. &gt;&gt; It was not God's design. Brother Abraham told us that the advances of this world is the knowledge of the devil. &gt;&gt; He said is the god of this evil age &gt;&gt; and Satan as we all agree his aim is to destroy families. &gt;&gt; That's Satan's aim. So whatever Satan can do to destroy families, as much as it looks like there are lots of benefits in it, remember it's the tree of good and evil, right? Looks like there's so many benefits in it. We can do our businesses better. There's so many things we can we can do better with technology, but let's not forget the fact that it's also taking us away from what is needful. Now, what is the implication of not having enough time with our children? Not having enough um quality time with children, it affects their emotional well-being. You know, I was in the US last year. Um, we had gone to speak for a brother in Florida who's a black American and I was in his truck. He was I don't know, he was probably taking me for lunch somewhere. And then he got a call and he answered the call. I think it was a missed call. There was a message that was left and then he turned to me and said, "Oh, that's my nephew. He's in prison. And I'd never been in the conversation that being in prison would have been said that casually. But if you look at the black American society or black American community in the states, one of the reason why you have a lot of them in prison, a lot of them doing bad stuff is lack of parenting. Many of them have been parented by single parents who have to go to work in the morning, don't come back till late and the children are left alone to do whatever they can do. Now when we are born as babies, we come into this world empty behaviorally. &gt;&gt; Behaviorally, we are empty. We don't know how to behave. We don't know how to greet people. We we have nothing and depending on what is filled into that child that molds their character in the future. &gt;&gt; Now behavioral outcomes, you know, is also one of the things you see when we don't spend quality time with our children. the time we could have used to transfer. We're going to look at how children learn behaviors, but the time we could have used to transfer the right behaviors to them to mold them. And let's not forget, there is a time for molding. &gt;&gt; When you get a potter, when the potter is trying to mold the clay, he only molds it when it's pliable. He only molds it when it's soft. If he allows it to dry, he's got to crumble it &gt;&gt; to build it up again. &gt;&gt; So God has given us as parents a huge responsibility. &gt;&gt; God has given us the responsibility of building another generation. Remember, Israel was in this position. At some point after they came into the promised land, after they got all their possession, after they settled down, God had told them from the time of Moses that all these things I'm giving unto you, pass it on down to your children. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't just tell them. Make it sign. Make it bracelets. Just do everything you can &gt;&gt; to keep passing it on." Amen. &gt;&gt; But by the time we got to Judges, sadly, the Bible told us and there rose up another generation that knew not the Lord. &gt;&gt; And what did that lead to? Everybody started to do what was right &gt;&gt; in their own eyes. &gt;&gt; Not what was right before God, &gt;&gt; but what was right in their own eyes. whatever was deposited into them was what they were able to display. &gt;&gt; But Ram said in be not afraid was talking about Susan Wesley. Says Susanna Wesley was the mother of 17 children. She didn't have no push button dishwashers and speakers to turn on to get water. And yet with all those children, she could spend two to three hours in a in a day in prayer around those 17 children. and said from that little nest of little birds came forth a John and a Charles. &gt;&gt; So what we are doing as parents today is investment. &gt;&gt; We are either investing the right things or investing the wrong things. &gt;&gt; And there is always a return on investment. &gt;&gt; If you don't invest, there's a return on not investing. &gt;&gt; Maybe brother Joel can tell us more about that. But if you invest, there's always a return. &gt;&gt; And we don't always get the same. It also comes with how intentional you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; About your investment. &gt;&gt; The Ram said, "We need more mothers like that with time." How many mothers know that they don't have enough time? And fathers know they don't have enough time. I'll raise up my hand. But we've got to do all we can. We've got to deprioritize some certain things &gt;&gt; so that we can spend more time with our children with time to teach their children about God. Another way we can see the God parents is through discipline and correction. Now what does discipline mean? The definition of discipline, it means control gained by enforcing obedience or order. The control that you gain. So it's a process of gaining control. If somebody says that you need to gain control, it means that you don't currently have control. So when we give birth to our kids, as they start to grow, they're totally dependent on us as babies. And as they start to grow and get to being becoming toddlers, this is my fourth experience of, you know, managing toddlerhood. When they become toddlers, they want to be in control. Remember I said that they don't know anything yet. They came empty. Right? &gt;&gt; So if they try to be in control, but Abraham said power without character &gt;&gt; is satanic. &gt;&gt; Character is built over time. &gt;&gt; Character takes time before you can say this person has now come to maturity. They have character. They cannot take decisions the right decisions. I'll say when character is not built yet. So discipline is a way to gain that control. Make sure that you are in control. &gt;&gt; It also means to orderly orderly or prescribed conduct or pattern of behavior and also means self-control. But in the context of what we're talking about this morning, control seems to be the most uh appropriate definition for it. Gaining control. Now if you look at the word correction, correction means the action or instance of correcting such as amendment, &gt;&gt; rectification, &gt;&gt; rebuke, punishment. It also means bringing into conformity with a standard. &gt;&gt; So you try to make someone conform to a standard. How many of us have pets? How many of us train our pets? Everyone, if you don't train your pets, you have too much work, right? Your dog will pee and poo on your carpet. You have to take it, clean it up. The smell will never go. Or maybe it might go if you spent a lot of money. But we try to train them so that they can come to a certain standard or the conformity to a certain standard. So you let him know that when you want to do the toilet, it doesn't happen in the house. When we go for a walk, that's when it happens. And after a while, the dog understands and they follow, they conform to that standard. &gt;&gt; Now the word correction, as I was telling us, the meaning also pushed out the word punishment. And I decided to take a look at the word punishment. Punishment means training that corrects. So when you punish a child, you are training because there's some there are certain things we probably do. Well, I experienced that I can't agree there was punishment. Let's look at the purpose of punishment. Is the training that corrects, molds or perfects the mental faculties or moral character. Right? So we were not born with the perfect level of u mental faculty or moral character. We like I said we're born empty. Our kids were born empty. So we have to train them up. We have to guide them to the path that is right if we want them to end up well. &gt;&gt; And that's how God does. So 2 Samuel 7:14 God was speaking to David about Solomon. God says, "I will be his father and he shall be my son. &gt;&gt; If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him." &gt;&gt; If he does what is wrong, I will correct him. &gt;&gt; If he does what is wrong, I will chasten him. The word chastin means to correct. Reciprocally to argue, concessively to decide, justify or convict. Appoint, argue, chest, convince, correct, correction, daysmen, dispute, judge, maintain, plead, reason or reason together. Rebuke, reprove. So there are many many ways when we start to look at chastening. There are many many ways. Sometimes is actual outright rebuke. Sometimes is reasoning together. God told Israel come let us reason together. We're going to see how brother advised us to deal with certain age group of ch um as we go along. Hebrews 12 7-9 Bible tells us God dealeth with you as with sons. He for a prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness. Malachi 1:6 the Lord was speaking through the prophet Malachi and demanding horner from the children of Israel said a son honorth his father. If I then be a father where is my horner? Ram told us in the end time evangelism he said and all that go all that go with God has trials your faith is tried when you start to live for him then every neighbor's going to talk about you everything is going to go wrong for you wow nobody said amen when we say everything is going to go right we want to say amen but sometimes God intentionally ally allows things to go wrong for you for a purpose. Why? Just remember that for it's God trying you. &gt;&gt; The Bible said every son that cometh to God must first be proven. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He said &gt;&gt; character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; Character is what? Victory. &gt;&gt; What? What does that mean? you win character. &gt;&gt; You've got to fight to be able to come to the level of character &gt;&gt; because by default you don't want character &gt;&gt; or you want the wrong character by default. We were born in sin, were shaped in iniquity. We came to this world speaking lies. You don't need to teach a little child how to tell a lie. Their nature makes them do it. &gt;&gt; When they think they're going to be punished for something, they tell a lie because they want to escape. It's fight or flight. Right? They want to escape that punishment. They tell a lie. So if we follow our natural way, if you just leave a child to go by his way, he's going to end up wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God also does not want us to just go our way. God wants to make sure that we are trained so that we can have character. Must be proven, chastening, child trained. Brother said like my daddy trained me when I done wrong. They had ten commandments hanging up over the door. Said he was a limp about this long and Mr. Brown was a pretty good man in his arm and he took us out and trained us. If you don't know what that is kids, it means spanking. Now, I'm not here to tell you how to train your kids, but one thing I'll tell you is whatever you are doing, are you the one in control or that child is still in control? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Whatever you're doing, is it helping you to be in control? When you give an instruction to the child and the child definitely tells you, "I'm not going to do it," then that child is in control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, think about what you do. I'm not here to tell you spank your kids, don't spank your kids. It's it's between you and God. &gt;&gt; But let's remember, you've got to be in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham said that's the way God does. He tries, child trains you, brings you up because you're his child. There's something in the future for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something in the future for you. &gt;&gt; When God is training us, God is not looking at today, God is thinking about the future. Is the same thing we tell our kids. I tell my kids when I'm training you. Some of them I tell them, see, if you wake up late for school, you're going to wake up late for work. If you keep waking up late for work, you're going to get fired. If you're you're fired, you won't have no money and you'll be able to make ends meet. So, I'm training you now for the future. Just like my parents trained me for my future. &gt;&gt; All of us here, whatever character we had, it was the the parenting that we got, whether that was from our actual parents or from someone else that was a parent figure in our lives. &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing God does. Brother Aram said, "He trains you because you're his child. There's something in the future for you. Home in glory and it trains you." Now, every son must be tried. So, like I said before, our kids are born empty and we've got to mold them. So, how do kids learn good behaviors? How do we make them learn good behaviors? I'm not a behavioral scientist, but I work in I've been in human resources for about 20 years and part of my work requires to understand people's behaviors. When a company is trying to select someone, I know everyone here that's been interviewing past few years or even more, you hear a lot about behavioral interviews, right? In the past, we used to have situational interviews. Sorry, I'm getting a bit technical but it might help someone where you ask somebody tell me if you have ever done this and someone can just make it up and tell you what they have done. But behavioral interviews will ask the question differently. It will say give me a situation where you had to do this. Right? So you have to actually demonstrate behavior, right? So our kids as well, they born empty, but they learn behaviors as they grow. So in what ways do they learn behavior? One of it is modeling, which means observing and imitating. And they start that from when they're born. As long as their eyes are open, they already start to observe. And though they might not imitate, but they're recording it. That's why sometimes you hear your toddler say something, you're like, "Really? I didn't know you could speak that that good English, right? Because they've been they've been keeping it or you see expressions on their faces, you know, the the way they are going they they they like express some things. Maybe they're talking and then they show some certain expressions and you're like, "This is still a child. How are you able to do that?" They are observing and they are imitating. So kids learn by watching adults and pairs. They observe what others do and the outcomes of it. They try to see whether you get rewarded or whether you get punished. If they know that what you did led to a reward, they want to model after it. If they know that what the person did led to punishment, they want to um avoid doing that. Another way that kids learn is reinforcement, which I know this is the word that we use when we train our pets, right? Treats. Why do you give treats? It's positive reinforcement. You're trying to tell that pet that what you did, I like it. I want you to continue to do it. So, we do that with our kids as well. There's positive reinforcement. There's negative reinforcement as well. Consequences for bad behavior. When you do what is not right, if a parent tells the child, "This is what I've asked you to do." If the child does not do it and there are no consequences, you're not modeling the right behavior. We are learning from the way God does his things, right? You're going to see all of this from the scriptures and from things with the ram um shared with us. There's also classical conditioning which talks about association um between certain behaviors and emotional experiences. Um so like sequencing of things. So if a child if they know that um once they're done brushing their teeth then they're going to be told a bedtime story that motivates them to brush their teeth at at at night so that they can get the bedtime story. There's also attachment and emotional bonding which um as we take care of our children their emotional um attachment that they have to us that becomes a reward for the type of behaviors we're trying to promote. And then sometimes we struggle with kids not having the right behaviors. And this is one of the things that I know most parents are very frustrated about. when you continuously correct your child will they continuously do what you tell them not to do. Now, one of the things that we don't do when we're correcting our kids and observing their reaction to our correction is we don't go back to when we were kids and try to think like them. We don't do that. I'm not saying that we ought to do that. It's we have just passed that stage. We we are past it. We're gone. I'm speaking to you as an adult and I expect you to do what I what I'm telling you to do. And one of the things I realized as well is that most of we parents parents the way we were parented, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's usually the default because that's the only way we have learned parenting. &gt;&gt; My grandfather was very strict. My grandfather, my father told me and I well I met my grandfather. He was a disciplinarian. My dad told us a story of one day he was just standing he had done nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing wrong. My grandfather was coming just hit him on the at the back of his head. Pam and my grandmother was like why will you do that? And he said I want him to be at alert. So you have people who have gone through like that military approach and by default my dad was moving that way but my dad never was never as bad as my grandfather. That's why I'm not as bad as my dad. So it's it's toning down as you come down the generations. But you realize that as you are parenting your kids, you find yourself doing exact same thing that you criticized your parents about because that is what you have learned to be parenting. So when we are correcting our kids um behavioral scientists have taken a look at why sometimes our kids are not as responsive as we want them to be. So kids they say that they have underdeveloped prefrontal cortex which is the part of the brain that is in charge of self-control, judgment and impulse regulation. So in children those part of our brain are still immature and is continuing to develop as they get into early adulthood. So kids you find them acting on impulse um because if they are going to demonstrate good behavior they have to have some level of cognitive control to be able to um demonstrate that but that is still under construction. Another thing you find in kids is something called egoentrism where young children they say especially under the age of seven are naturally egoentric and they struggle to see perspective outside of their own. So they want to do something that's exactly what they want to do. It's hard for you to explain why they shouldn't do it. And many of us you know our parents our children sorry always ask the question why. Um, I couldn't ask my parents some of those wise, but you tell them to do something. If I asked the why, I would have been too scared of the consequence to ask the why because some wise just you get a you get a slap and then you know that you shouldn't ask why. Um, but our children are I mean it's a different generation and we can't approach things the same way. There are basic things that are principles that we cannot change but our approach can be a little bit different as we you know um adjust to the times that we're living in. But our children want to know why especially at a certain age they want to know why they are egocentric. They they think about themselves first and maybe just themselves. Um and that can make them start to look selfish or rude when you speak with them. Um but we need to understand that they are still developing right. Um there's also the triad at error learning. Children naturally test boundaries. &gt;&gt; They don't stay in the middle. &gt;&gt; They try to go as far as they can. &gt;&gt; They try to test boundaries. Try to see, you know, am I meant to go more than I'm supposed to go? So um because they're naturally curious and they explore by pushing limits because they are still in that stage of they have the appetite for learning. They have the biggest appetite for learning and one of the ways to learn is to go as far. Don't restrict yourself. That's why when you buy a new gadget, you bring it into the house, you're still trying to figure it out, your son comes and says, "Oh, mommy, this gadget can do this." And like, "How did you know?" Well, I read the instructions. Well, you that bought it didn't read the instruction, but they want to know. So, they are pushing themselves. They're pushing limits. And that might also like in a negative way um restrict them from modeling the right behaviors as quickly as we want them to. There's also the lack of socialization which you know um social norms and moral values you have to develop them over time. Many times we tell our kids somebody you just got there you're supposed to tell them good morning. They don't they're not born with that. They have to learn. We have to reinforce and reinforce and reinforce and be patient with them because one day they will get it. Sometimes, you know, look at when we talk about potty training and sometimes we get anxious like, oh, he's already three. He's not potty trained. I'm like, you would never see a 5-year-old that is still using diapers unless there's something wrong with them, &gt;&gt; right? So, children develop at different paces &gt;&gt; and we've got to be patient with them. Now, when you're correcting your children, I also trying to find out because this was a question I had. what's actually going on in their mind when you're correcting them. Um, and sometimes when we correct our children, they can feel confused or conflicted if what they did felt natural or rewarding to them, right? They had spent 5 hours on screen and you come back home and like so you've been on screen all the chores I asked you to do. Why didn't you why didn't you do it? And when you correct them, they give you the face, right? But what is actually happening at that time is because their level of understanding is very different from your level of understanding they are not able to um see why you are correcting them. So and depending on our tone and the consistency of correction that's one of the things that will bring results. I remember a couple years ago I was away. My wife had the family hotel with the kids and she did I think she was the one that did the first feedback session and and the kids she told them write down the things you want daddy to stop doing. And I don't know maybe one or two of them wrote that we want daddy to stop yelling at us. And I took it and I tried to hopefully I don't yell anymore. Maybe it's just a few times. But I I took that feedback because I felt I'm not achieving anything by yelling. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you start to yell, they just put a blocker. &gt;&gt; And communication is supposed to be two ways. So depending on the tone of our correction, we might achieve stuff faster or slower. There's also the internalization process where young children normally they would obey to avoid punishment at the early stages before this is internalized. But when kids are doing something just for the sake of conformity, it is dangerous. Because when they have their freedom, they will do just what they wanted to do. So we need to ask ourselves the question, are my kids obeying today just because they're trying to conform? And I can say this from a first person experience. I always say, I'm sorry if this sounds a little bit disagreeable, but I always say that those of us that grew up in the message should better understand our kids that are growing up in the message because our struggles are similar. The reason I'll say that is when our parents came from Pentecostalism or the world into the message, they repented. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Their lives were changed. They came in, they had the passion, they ran with this message. Those of us that were born into it. We didn't have the chance. We were just told. I always try to relate it to the journey of the children of Israel. And the three generations you'll find in that journey. You have the generation of Moses. You have the generation of Eleazar, the son of Aaron. You have the generation of Phineas. Now, Phineas was about maybe a toddler or two years old from historians. When they left Egypt, Phineas had no opportunity to eat cucumbers and onions and all the things that those middle class were craving for and saying want to go back to Egypt to eat. He always ate mana &gt;&gt; because that was what was fed through the wilderness. &gt;&gt; So we always ate the message but we did not eat it with revelation until God came and revealed himself personally to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Alistister was preaching some time ago and he said growing up in the message he used to ask himself what should I repent of? &gt;&gt; I do everything right. So when my parents were telling me to repent I didn't understand. I've not done anything wrong. You're asking me to repent. So first time I went for water baptism, I went because my friends went for water baptism. Because truly I I I listen to everything they tell me. I go to school, I do the right thing. Before I got to the point where all I have been doing through the years, I realized it was just trying to conform. &gt;&gt; And the danger of conformity is when you now get to the place where you don't have that protection, &gt;&gt; then your real self shows up. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have to understand as our kids are internal internalizing the um going through internalization of the things we are teaching them. We have to be sure that they understand &gt;&gt; and they feel safe as well. One of the things I lately told our kids is if you do anything wrong don't think you will do something that is so bad that you cannot tell dad and mom &gt;&gt; because regardless of what you go through I've gone through it before. &gt;&gt; Mom has gone through it before. So always have the freedom. We have an open door policy. Come and tell us. We are telling you do what is right. But in case you are not able to do it like we we heard this morning, the father comes after us. &gt;&gt; He doesn't forsake us. He doesn't push us away. He doesn't disown us &gt;&gt; regardless of what we did. If we are learning from his parental attributes, we've got to let our kids know the same. &gt;&gt; Kids also go through em emotional regulation and frustration. Um their emotional brain often reacts faster than their logical brain. So they they're more on the emotional side than the logical side. Um which when they're corrected, they might feel very overwhelmed. They might feel defensive. And that's why our approach to correction, we have to watch it as well because many times the way we correct our kids is out of frustration. Now, I don't know if I'm there yet, but I'll just bring that up. There's a scripture that I read and I said, "Lord, help me." And we will get to that. Um, so we we we can look at how God approached the children of Israel and all the troubles that they gave God and Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. You can look at how um the psalmist um chronicled that in Psalms 78 and 106. But you will see that God always longsuffered with them. God was long-suffering with them. I try to to see when was the first time that God gave the children of Israel a spanking. So there there were there were judgments that happened like those that you know um were when they had the golden calve and how Moses came down and saw that they had the golden calf and Moses said it was on the Lord's side and told the priest and he killed 3,000. But I I was looking specifically at how God when God reacted based on their complaint. So the first complaint that the children of Israel um gave before God was right after they came out of you know the the um crossed the Red Sea. Of course at the Red Sea they already complained and said oh you want to kill us let us go back to Egypt um why did you bring us here but as they crossed the Red Sea Exodus 15 they couldn't find water. The water they found was bitter. So at the water of at at at the at the um water of Mara they complained. God did not spank them. God did not scold them. God just told Moses, "You take this wood, put it in that inside the water. The water will be sweet and they can drink." When they got to the wilderness of sin, there was no food. They complained again. All the food we brought, we run out. What are you doing about it? And then God didn't tell Moses. He didn't he didn't punish them. He didn't do anything. He just told Moses, "Don't worry. Tell them I'm going to give them enough food. They're going to eat it till it's going to come out of their nose. I'll give them mana. I'll give them quills." And God did that. Now, they got to the um refidim and they also did not have water to drink. So, of course, they've left the waters of Mara. They've journeyed. They couldn't be of course carry enough water that will take them through. They got there and they couldn't find water to drink. And God just told Moses, "You know what? Just smite the rock and they will get water." Now, the first time that God reacted to their disobedience was when they got to Tabera. Numbers 11:1. And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord. And the Lord heard it, and his anger was kindled. And the fire of the Lord burnt among them and consumed them that they that that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. So God was longsuffering with them. &gt;&gt; God showed compassion. &gt;&gt; God showed pity. &gt;&gt; In correction there has to be compassion. Now um yes. So in Hebrews Paul was writing this Hebrews 12 7-10 he was talking about how God deals with us. He said if ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then ye are bastards and not sons. Furthermore we have our fathers of our flesh. This is where I'm going. Which corrected us and we gave them reverence. Shall we not shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and leave? He said, "For they our earthly fathers and this speaks to us as parents for a few days chasind us after their own pleasure." And this might mean different things, but what struck me is that when I'm correcting my kids, am I correcting them for their own benefit or I'm correcting them to save face? Maybe there's a visitor there. Maybe they do something I feel like, how will you do this in church now? This is going to bring disgrace on me and the family and stuff. and we're correcting them for our own pleasure. But look at how God corrects us. &gt;&gt; He corrects us for our profit. &gt;&gt; So correction has to be it has to be focused on the profit of the child. What will this child gain from correction? Let me times we react. Let me hold back my reaction and think this through. Back in the day when I was growing up, I had friends in school that would tell me that anytime they did something wrong during the day, they don't they don't get spanked for it during the day. It's at the middle of the night when they are sleeping. That's when they the parents will have conversation. I'm not saying that that's the right thing to do, but what I'm saying is that father had time to think through it. At the time they are correcting, they're not correcting from a reactive place. They're correcting from a place where they know this is going to profit the child. Many times what happens with kids that are molested is it's reactive. You do something wrong and a parent throws something and then the kid gets um you know um hurt somewhere. But if we take time to think about it, we will correct but we will explain why we are correcting. My dad did that a lot with us where when you want to get spanked you will have a conversation. Then he got to a time he stopped spanking us. And when he's having the conversation, you will prefer the spanking because he will point out every wrong thing that you did and why you shouldn't have done it and why you should have known better. You're like just spank me and let me go. You get the spanking, you go. But that is the right way. And I believe the bra talked about this as well. how we must make sure that when we are Is he almost 12? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; All right. I have to I have to rush. Um I'm sorry. I wasn't looking at the time. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I hope no one was looking at the time as well. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I I'll be done. I'll be done. Just maybe give me five minutes over. &gt;&gt; They were listening. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know that I don't take time normally, right? You know my sermons are short, right? So please forgive me for today. But I'll just hit a few points and then we'll be done. So God expects us to chasten our children not for our pleasure but for their profit. &gt;&gt; Now as our children grow older, the approach has got to change. &gt;&gt; You cannot treat an 18year-old the same way you will treat a 5-year-old. There are times where if your approach is spanking, the kids have to outgrow spanking. Otherwise, you are just fighting with your child. I don't think brother Peter would want to spank Daniel because that would be too fighting. But there's a different approach. And you know Isaiah was telling us he said whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast. So he told it he tells us that there's a progression even in our spiritual growth. And uh brother Bram had an experience that he narrated to us in questions and answers. I'll just paraphrase. I don't have time to read all of it. But this had to do with his daughter called Rebecca. Sister Rebecca at you know she had turned 18. Brother Bram called it when she got to a little teen Annie said she was going with some girl when we first went out there run over some girls house taking music lessons and she was going to come home and play certain type of music that brother Ram said wasn't welcome in their home and sister Mida had reacted in a different way. Sister Mida had reacted in a way that was more confrontational in the same way she would have treated her maybe when she was 10 years old or 12 years old but now she had gone to a different stage where the approach had to change. So brother Bram said here he said I said um so let me just read what brother so brother Bram actually went and um you know met with his wife and said um this approach is not right because sister Rebecca was getting very frustrated. She was going to leave the house. She was going to go she's going to go somewhere. They said she should not go and she was going to go anyways. Um so brother Ram called her. Brother Ram said, um, I never said that. I never said that. He was talking to his wife. We'll quit scolding her. Just advise her. She needs a body. And you are the one to be our body. You and I. We. must be friends with our kids to the point that our kids would rather trust us to take advice from us than from someone else. We must build that, especially as they're growing older, we must get to the point where we build that relationship with them that they rather say, "Let me let me have a conversation with dad and mom first before they take the um advice they get from their friends." I was telling our kids recently, we're reading um or talking about Raobam and how Rubam, you know, rather than take the advice of the wise men that were with his father Solomon, he took the advice of his friends, their age group. And I said, why was that wrong? And the simple answer is the wise men knew a lot more than the age group of Rhob said, this kids today needs a body. If they had a mother and father will stay home and take care of them instead of out here in the barroom running around all night and things like that wouldn't have a juvenile delinquency. They get away from the Bible. They all went to church and made bunko games and things like that. Said you're trying to polish up like Satan's ground out in Hollywoods. You could never bring Hollywood into the church. I mean bring the church into Hollywood. You've got to bring Hollywood to your grounds, not on their grounds. Let them come over here. We got something they know nothing about. So, we got down our knees and committed it to God. I said, "I know she's 18 years old. We'll be in a few days. A girl that age will think about boyfriends." I told the other ones of my kid, I said there's Don't tell me there's no boy that you think is good-look or there's no girl that doesn't. No, because at their age, I could tell. I I had a crush when I was in elementary school and I'm not holding it back because if my 8-year-old sees a girl and thinks she's pretty and she's afraid and he's afraid to tell me, I want him to know that I went through that as well because it's developmental stages. The the mistake our parents made was they all grew up fine. &gt;&gt; They had no sin. They all made A's in their grade. Everybody was fine. My dad was quite honest. I would tell us what he went through. But maybe I'll say that we probably need to start a little earlier &gt;&gt; because of the things they're encountering in school. So, Brother Bram said here, he said she will think about boyfriends. We've kept her in. I never wanted to see her get married. I want to put her in the office here, do the work. I want to see her filled with the spirit and leave like that. That's how every father is. You never really want your daughter to go, right? He said, "Well, we all wanted that." Well, we can't do that. She just won't listen to it. I said, "Wait a minute. We've raised her all we can. &gt;&gt; Do all you can on that day. God will say, "Yes, you did what you can. &gt;&gt; It's not in our hands to save our kids." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not in our hands. We are never going to be able to do it. But if we do our part and leave the rest to God, then God will do it. &gt;&gt; It might be their last minute on earth &gt;&gt; that God will turn them back. &gt;&gt; God could do it a few years before. God could do it many years before. God could take a child that has gone into all the nonsense of this world and make him a preacher tomorrow. You never really know. &gt;&gt; But we've got to do our part. So brother was saying, we've raised her all we can. Now put her in the hands of God. Commit her. Then when she does anything, say Becky, darling, he was advising his wife. Mother don't want you to do that, but I'm your pal. I'll stick by you. &gt;&gt; Let her know you love her. She's going to get somebody to love her, and it might be the wrong woman. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Aram said that we are built as humans to crave for fellowship. We also crave for love because that's what fellowship brings. But we want to be the ones that our kids would rather take love and fellowship from rather than someone out there because they could guide them in the wrong path. You be the woman does the loving. Honey, that sound kind of cruel crude, but people come everywhere. Brother was now telling her that yes, I'm your husband, but I'm more than just that. People come everywhere and set on personal interviews and things. I said, I'm so common. We're common to one another because we are husband and wife, but we never let that happen. You must remember this is the name of the Lord. In other words, I'm not telling you this as your husband. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you this as a servant of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if brother Bram was not just advising Sister Ma as the husband, but as a servant of the Lord, then I want to take what brother Bram said and apply it as well &gt;&gt; because that is the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I'm friends &gt;&gt; with my teenagers &gt;&gt; to the point where they would rather take my advice than take someone else's advice. &gt;&gt; Can I make it happen myself? No. But can I do all I can to make it happen? &gt;&gt; Yes. Abraham said, "We got down, committed it to God, said we'll take our hands off it." That afternoon, she coming. She said, "Well, I guess you'll still staying. Um, I guess I guess you're still staying. I ain't got going over there." So, she said she's not going where she was going before. So, what was actually making them argue? She and her mother. The prayer worked. &gt;&gt; The prayer worked. &gt;&gt; Sometimes all we need to do is pray &gt;&gt; and God will work on the other side. said, "No, I'll never said nothing about it." Said, "You know, mother don't want you know mother don't want you to do that and you know that it's like to kill your daddy when he heard you up there playing that boogie woogie music ever what it was with that girl said." Now, he didn't want you to do that and we don't want you to do that, Becky, but we just committed it to the Lord. I want you to know we love you. Whatever you do, we still love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The last thing that God does, hold on, there are two more things. God shows compassion and mercy. Um, I'll just run through this very quickly. &gt;&gt; Bring it on. &gt;&gt; Um, Psalms 103, like a father pier his children, so the Lord piered them fear him. As one who is mother comforted in Isaiah tells us, so will I comfort you. And he says, thou, oh Lord, are our father. Thy name is from everlasting. Now brother Ram told a story. Um many of us should be familiar with this. Their son Joseph, brother Joseph Branham, who is now a grandpa I'm sure um he did something wrong in the house and sister media was going to give him a spanking and he ran to the father and as soon as the bra carried him he said daddy I'm sorry. When he said, "Daddy, I'm sorry." Sister Mida said, "Billy, give him a spank." And Brother Bram could not do it because he felt this child already repented. Now, Sister Mida didn't like that, and we know what that resulted into because she was um she was rude to God's servant. and God did not like it. What God told Brother to tell her to go and read about um Moses and his sister and his brother. Um but brother Bram told Joseph, he said, "Joseph, come on. Daddy shall give you a licking. You know that. But being that you repented, remember my patience is going to run out one of those days." And that repenting, you've got to bring forth fruit meets for repentance. and prove to me that you really mean it. &gt;&gt; So God shows us compassion, but we must show the same level of compassion to our children &gt;&gt; to be able to win them over. I'm not saying we should be so soft and let them to be wherever they want to be, but also we shouldn't be too hard on them to the point as we read, you know, Paul saying we should not provoke them. &gt;&gt; But Ram said somewhere, he said that we need to be careful. They've got their guardian angels. You should be careful not to provoke their guardian angel. &gt;&gt; The last thing that God does, God reinforces our identity and our relationship with him. &gt;&gt; And we've got to do the same for our kids. None of our kids are bad kids. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; None of them are renegades. That's why brother Rama said he didn't like the Lord told him to stop calling those kids Rickys and Rickers. right &gt;&gt; kids in the world. So we should never allow the bad words like that to come out of our mouth. &gt;&gt; God was telling Israel, "Is he not thy father that he that had brought thee?" Jeremiah said, "Thou shalt call me my father and shall not turn away from me." John 1:2 said to give them the power to become sons of God. Galatians said, "The spirit of his son is in your hearts crying aba father." God is reinforcing that we are his children and he's our father. I will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters. Second Corinthians. Now, brother Aram said this. I'll just quickly say the story. I'm so sorry I'm way past time. My dad told us something when we were growing up. Brother um my dad said that he was a boy as a boy. Like he was very stubborn as a little boy. And many times he thought his father never loved him. But one day he went out with his father. My dad my grandfather was um you know an educationist. He he was well to do. So my grandfather took my dad out and went to visit with some of his friends like prestigious people. And my grandfather introduced my father to his friends as his son said this is my boy. And that moment my father said, "So this man thinks highly of me enough to introduce me to his friends. I must change." What was happening? He was reinforcing his identity. By reinforcing our children's identity. What are we here for? Why do we come to church? To know who we are. &gt;&gt; God wants us to know who we are. Once we know who we are, then the rapture is going to go. So our children, we must let them know who they are. Even if they are acting differently, &gt;&gt; they must know that's not who you are. We must reinforce their identity. We must reinforce our relationship with them. We must let them know regardless of what you do, I'm never going to disown you. &gt;&gt; You're my child. You will remain my child. &gt;&gt; Brother says this in thy house. He said, "Now, reason I thought about saying this because you people here, most of your children are saved. They're Christians. I've admired Brother Ian's family. This young man here usually maybe I'll ask the musicians to come so you know I'm closing. Musicians, you can come. I'm so sorry." Brother Ram said, "I've admired Brother A's family. This young man here usually who would get a teenager sit around and listen to someone preacher talk." Said, "Usually who will get that? That doesn't happen often." is saying why they be out and gone somewhere little girls like that I said to brother Fred his kids they can just hear me say one thing that's wrong they're ready to stop it right now you see and set with the highest respect so brother Abraham is preaching those kids know the word enough to come ask questions but they don't do it arrogantly they Come with respect instead of being out a hot roing rambling around a hot roing rambling around they when they hear you speak about the gospel they're ready to sit right there and listen he said now I know we all want our kids we all think our kids is renegades and things like that but we must stop that I believe we must remember that these kids are the best kids in the world &gt;&gt; because they are our children &gt;&gt; and we claim them for God. &gt;&gt; Now your salvation will not save that child. But Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved. &gt;&gt; What did he mean by that? It didn't mean that because they were saved that their house would be saved with it. He meant this that because if they had enough faith &gt;&gt; to be saved themselves, that same amount of faith that he had for himself will work for his children. &gt;&gt; Now I've got my children. There's my little son, Joseph, Billy, Sarah, Rebecca. I want to see each of them a worker in the gospel doing something. I want to see them saved and filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, I've committed them to God. I'm holding on to God for them. See, and I believe they are going to be saved. We must believe that our children are going to be saved. Brother Aram said, "Every one of them." &gt;&gt; And I believe that that is a truth. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many of you know, but I don't think Sister Sarah Bram was going to church at some point. I mean, we don't hear about her, but Brother Bram claimed that for God. I don't want to know who she got married to, where she is. Brother Bram claimed that for God, and I know that she will be in the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Every one of them, see, I believe they're going to be saved and I'll have them on the other side. I don't believe my salvation will save them. No, but my faith in God will do it." You see, my faith, believing God will do it, will cause them to come to Christ. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's where you people praying for your children. And that's the reason your children has the manners. And the real lady and gentlemen in this wild age that we are living in yet they have that part about them that's the best I know of any kids. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think the reason of that is because your prayers for them. You've committed them to God and you are holding on. &gt;&gt; Let's be on our feet. I'll read one more quote. It's a collective work. Fathers, mothers, children. Before God, we are all children. &gt;&gt; He's our father. And children, your parents father must become your father. I don't mean your grandfather. I mean your parents heavenly father has got to become your heavenly father. But Ram said, "And let one member of the family get nervous. It goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all forcing and going on and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something. He upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family is upset. He said it's Satan. We've got to run Satan out of our homes. &gt;&gt; We've got to discern what is happening &gt;&gt; when Satan shows up in the home. said then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them rejoice with it. So everyone of the family try to do that. Try each one of you children to help your papa. Mama mama papa you try to help the children. Don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you. &gt;&gt; Why? You're Christians. &gt;&gt; You are born of the spirit of God. You are the salt of the earth. You have God-given rights. And the Bible said, "If there be any praise, if there be any virtue, think on those things. &gt;&gt; Don't think about the wrong thing." &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Loving father, I believe this has been done according to your command. &gt;&gt; So unworthy to say the words, but Paul said, I have received of the Lord that which also I give unto you. &gt;&gt; You gave our prophet this words. You've made the Bible a new book unto us. We don't just read the Bible theologically. We read it with understanding. &gt;&gt; We read it with revelation. knowing who we ought to be in every aspect of our lives. knowing that you want to form your character in us and bring us to a place dear Lord Jesus where we will do everything we'll do by own your own leadership where our children will look at us and Lord may it never be but even if they don't agree with what we believe they will be able to say I know my parents are true Christians &gt;&gt; help every parent hereord Lord Jesus, as your prophet said, we've got to apply the same faith that we had for our own salvation, apply that same faith for our kids. And know that regardless of what happens, you will save them. They will be with us in the rapture, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. They will be with us, Lord, in the translation, &gt;&gt; Lord, on the other side. Lord, the family chain will not be broken. Father, that is our confession. That is what we believe. &gt;&gt; Lord, if any of our kids are going weward, Lord, we will not call them that. We will remind them of their true identity. &gt;&gt; We will tell them they are the best children in the world. &gt;&gt; We'll let them know, Lord Jesus Christ, Father, that they were brought forward and dedicated as babies. And that prayer that was offered whenever it was you heard that prayer and you are going to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Lord help us. Give us guidance. These are your children that you have given unto us. We cannot take care of them ourselves. You've only put them in our care. They are your children. Help us to know that we have the work to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, on the other side, they won't be children to us. We'll be brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Help us to have that consciousness as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Lord, in all the callings of our lives, including this one on that day, you'll be able to say, "Welcome, faithful servant. You've done what your Lord asked you to do." Pray you bless us as we go. We pray you bless our pastor Lord and Benjamin Lord on their hunting trip. May you give them good game. May you also Lord Jesus have let them have a wonderful time of fellowship. Lord our pastor desires to Lord one way or the other just be of a good influence to his brother. Lord maybe Lord in a way he can Lord just see the life of Christ Lord that would make him to also want to be Lord like our pastor. We pray that you just bring that testimony, Lord Jesus Christ. Father, back with him. Bless us today, Lord Jesus. If I've said anything that I ought not to say, I pray that you will forgive me. I trust, Lord Jesus Christ, that this is what you wanted to give to your people. And Lord, beyond us hearing, Lord Jesus, give us the ability to do the word that we heard this morning. We give you all the glory, honor, and praise. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Brothers, can you please just I know we don't know the song. We might not sing it, but if you can just bring up the lyrics of that song that brother Pharaoh sang, I just want to read it out to us. It says, "Oh, father of the fatherless in whom all families are blessed. I love the way you father me." This is how he fathers us. You gave me life. You forgave the past. &gt;&gt; God, help us to forgive our children. Now in your arms I'm safe at last. I love the way you father me. When bruised and broken, I draw near. You hold me close and dry my tears. I love the way you father me. At last my fearful heart is still surrender to your perfect will. I love the way you father me. said, "If in my foolishness I stray, returning empty and ashamed, I love the way you father me, exchanging for my wretchedness, your radiant robes of righteousness. I love the way you father me." And when I look into your eyes, from deep within, my spirit cries, I love the way you father me. Before such love I stand amazed and ever will through endless days. I love the way you father me. Father me forever. Father me and in your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way you father me. [Music] I'm a child of the king. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of his royal blood. His royal blood. Oh, now flows through my veins. And I who was wretched and po now can see. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of Let's sing him one more time as brother Emanuel comes. Oh yes, they might. Oh yes, I am a child of the king. Oh yes. And I know that I can sing. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Toby said he felt this was inspired of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe that too. &gt;&gt; My brother, thank you very much. This was very bold and this was very practical. I believe we all have something that we are going to use when we get home. How many are going to be praying for brother Toby? &gt;&gt; Yes, that is easy. Now, how many are going to be praying for me and the parents? Hallelujah. Now, children, this is something you have to know. It's not always fathers and mothers praying for you. Sometimes the Lord can reveal something to your heart and you also have to pray for your parents. And the Lord listens because he knows it's needed in the house. Hallelujah. You know any of us can quote scriptures, memory verses, quotes. But as he was talking, I was thinking how many of that in my own life is the lived voice and that is what is important and that is what matters before God. And that's why you have to realize young girl when you step out there when you could have those earrings and you don't have them. That is a lived voice. When you could put on that tight pants so that you get all the attention of the men and you choose to wear those big skirts, that is a lived voice. Understanding that we are called into it. It's a life. &gt;&gt; May God help us all. &gt;&gt; I believe we all needed it. Let's bow our hearts before him. Our dear Lord and King, our God and Master, our Savior, you mean everything to us. Thank you again for imparting into us our natural life. But more than that, thank you for imparting into us the spiritual life, Lord. And Father, calling us to emulate your life. Help us, oh God, as parents to be able to impart that life. Oh Lord, we invite your presence into our homes, into our minds, into our lives, into every aspect of our life, Father, that it will portray you, that it will manifest you in flesh again once more on this earth, oh Lord, because Father, we know that you that last representation will be made before the rapture. And here we are as your children. We have know our identity. We know we are the ones called to do that, Father. But Father, we have weaknesses. we are short force and that is why we turn to you again that you come down in us. Fill us with that quickening power Lord that we will not be afraid or ashamed to stand up and show who we are. That our children will not be afraid or ashamed to stand up and be who they have been called to be. Lord have your way in every life here. Father, we pray that you'll bless us all as we go home. That Father, this will en encourage us more to move closer to you and into you and to live that life. Oh Lord, glory to be to your name, Father, for this time and for the inspiration that you've given us. We love you. We appreciate you. Be with our pastor and father, bring it home at your appointed time. Bless every soul who will listen to this soul to receive of you the same way you fed this year. We love you. We appreciate you. We adore you. We believe you, Father. Continue to strengthen my brother Toby. Continue to encourage him. Continue to use him for your purpose. Continue to anoint him, oh Lord. And if it please you, bring him our way again this way. We love you. In Jesus Christ's name do we pray with thanksgiving. Amen. [Music] Uh, let's sing. He knows my name.
