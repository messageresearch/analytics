[9:45] Oh, can't you
[9:47] see why I'm so

[10:01] It's the
[10:03] revealed word that's been
[10:09] spoken by the prophet of
[10:13] man. Oh, brother Harvey, would you come
[10:16] over here for a second? Can't you
[10:19] see why I'm so happy? Oh, yes. I've
[10:27] accepted the word of God.
[10:47] So God for a word of prayer. Lord Jesus,
[10:50] we say thank you Lord for this privilege
[10:52] and this opportunity Lord to come to the
[10:54] house of God and worship you and sing
[10:56] these songs of praise. Yes. God, I pray
[11:00] that you would anoint the speaker, Lord.
[11:03] Anoint those lips, Lord, and help them
[11:05] to get ourselves out of the way. Help
[11:07] us, Lord Jesus, to get ourselves out of
[11:09] the way to receive what you have for us
[11:11] tonight, Lord. I pray you bless these
[11:14] people, the words, song of Jesus Christ.
[11:20] Thank you.
[11:23] Amen. God bless you. Tonight, you have
[11:25] your seats.
[11:27] be seated in the heavenly places. I was
[11:30] uh listening I think to the second
[11:33] seal here yesterday and brother Brad
[11:35] just talks and we've heard it. We've all
[11:37] heard it. You said think about it. All
[11:39] those reformers all through those ages
[11:41] through the seven church ages had
[11:43] partial light. Prophets look for this.
[11:46] They saw way beyond saw the age we're
[11:48] living in. And we have it all. We have
[11:50] the full word revealed. Just when you
[11:53] think about the seals, how how the angel
[11:55] of the Lord came in every room to run
[11:56] grand and said, "This is the way it's
[11:58] going to be." Raph said, "I had no idea
[12:00] what that seal would be every single
[12:02] morning." Think about the privilege we
[12:04] have. I I I you know, it's it's it's uh
[12:08] it's a time to count on your blessing. I
[12:10] don't know. It just hit me some kind of
[12:12] extra deep this today when I heard that
[12:15] all those things are tied up. All the
[12:18] lights come. We are living in that
[12:20] glorious light. We are blessed. Brother
[12:23] John. Agree. He's I just enjoy brother
[12:26] John's personality. He just says you're
[12:28] blessed. You're just blessed. You're
[12:29] just always blessed. I love that.
[12:31] Looking forward to hearing what the Lord
[12:32] has placed on his heart tonight. Let's
[12:34] sing it. Count your blessings. When upon
[12:38] life, you are
[12:42] templess. When you are this sinking, all
[12:47] is lost. Just count your many blessings
[12:52] in them one by
[12:55] one and it will surprise you what the
[12:59] Lord have done. Oh yes. Now your
[13:04] blessings make them one by one. Oh your

[14:24] land and
[14:26] gold, think that Christ has promised you

[22:47] me when

[23:31] Lord with the fire of your spirit.
[23:45] Lord, and make me more like you. Isn't
[23:50] that all I desire tonight? Oh,
[23:54] pray me,
[23:58] Lord, and bless the

[25:14] [Music]
[25:19] Hallelujah.
[25:22] Amen. It's wonder to be wonderful to be
[25:24] in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Glory
[25:26] to God.
[25:28] While we are standing, you know, I think
[25:29] we should start with the verse. If we
[25:32] can take out
[25:36] Daniel, chapter
[25:38] [Music]
[25:39] 9, verse 20 to 23. God bless you, my
[25:45] brother, sisters. Yeah.
[26:04] Okay. And while I was speaking and
[26:06] praying and confessing my sin and the
[26:09] sin of my people Israel, and presenting
[26:12] my supplication before the Lord my God
[26:14] for the holy mountain of my God. Yay.
[26:18] while I was speaking in prayer, even the
[26:20] man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the
[26:23] vision at the beginning, being caused to
[26:26] fly swiftly, touched me about the time
[26:29] of the evening
[26:31] oblation, and he informed me and talked
[26:34] with me, and said, "Oh Daniel, I am now
[26:38] come forth to give thee skill and
[26:40] understanding."
[26:44] That's it. And we'll go in prayer.
[26:47] Thank you aba heavenly father for this
[26:49] wonderful time that you've given us.
[26:51] You've given us an opportunity to be
[26:53] present here Lord in your presence Lord.
[26:58] We dedicate ourselves to you Lord and we
[27:00] recognize and we acknowledge that there
[27:03] is nothing good in us Lord. There is
[27:05] nothing that we could have done to merit
[27:07] this grace Lord. It is absolutely your
[27:10] love and your mercy towards us Lord that
[27:13] you have taken us out of this world
[27:15] brought us here in your presence Lord
[27:18] paid for our sins Lord and washed us
[27:21] with your blood Lord. There is
[27:23] absolutely nothing we could have done.
[27:24] We acknowledge that Lord we know it Lord
[27:27] but we thank you that you have made a
[27:29] way Lord. You have given us a provided
[27:31] way where we can approach you Lord. I
[27:34] thank you Lord. And we also pray for our
[27:37] sister Michelle, Lord. She isn't feeling
[27:39] well. Touch her, Lord. Heal her, Lord,
[27:42] completely. And restore her, Lord. And
[27:45] we also pray for our brother Tabis. So,
[27:47] Lord, he's down with a cold, Lord. Have
[27:50] mercy upon him. Lord, restore him, Lord.
[27:54] And Lord, we know whatever we ask in
[27:57] your name in a prayer, Lord, we already
[28:00] believe that we have received it, Lord.
[28:02] We thank you, Lord. And we also pray for
[28:04] our pastor Lord. Wherever he is, Lord,
[28:07] be with him. Help him. Guide him Lord.
[28:10] Lord and also Lord we consecrate our
[28:13] hearts and our minds Lord. We want to
[28:16] hear from you Lord. Take this vessel
[28:18] Lord and speak to us Lord. I am here to
[28:21] learn. Lord speak to us. Lord give us
[28:25] from your heavenly mana Lord. We ask
[28:28] this small prayer in the name of our
[28:30] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:33] Amen.
[28:34] Amen. You may please be seated.
[28:42] Pretty interesting times that we are
[28:44] living in right now. Recently we got to
[28:47] know that the pope expired. Then there
[28:50] is wars everywhere and see I think
[28:54] yesterday day before yesterday there is
[28:56] a new war. Now India bombing Pakistan
[28:59] and you know the whole of uh Southeast
[29:03] Asia going into a turmoil there.
[29:06] Everybody's watching what is going to
[29:07] happen
[29:09] uh in these times. You know I I I saw it
[29:12] in the news. I'm not a political person
[29:14] whatsoever and I don't have any opinion
[29:16] who is right who is wrong but I saw a
[29:18] change in things. Uh what happened is I
[29:21] I saw this in the news basically and it
[29:23] stirred me up and uh I saw that you know
[29:26] uh it was of course it was afternoon
[29:29] here but in India and Pakistan it was
[29:31] night you know in the middle of the
[29:33] night India Indian planes went and they
[29:36] bombed you know certain uh terrorist
[29:38] camps they say in uh Pakistan and they
[29:42] destroyed it and the next day in the
[29:45] morning when uh you know there is a
[29:47] press conference called by the Indian
[29:49] government and I see that you know uh
[29:52] the people who are addressing the press
[29:54] there for a change it was you know two
[29:57] lady officers from the Indian army and
[30:00] from the Indian air
[30:02] force and uh a prelude to this what
[30:06] actually happened was that you know some
[30:08] terrorist went into India killed the
[30:10] male family members you know of certain
[30:12] terrorists there in cold blood just shot
[30:15] them you know right there in front of
[30:16] their families and India took this uh
[30:19] thing upon themselves and you know all
[30:21] those things happened. But the catch
[30:22] here was that you know for once I saw
[30:25] that you know uh uh from the army and
[30:27] from the air force they put the woman in
[30:31] front there and they were saying that
[30:33] you know what we avenged them. And when
[30:36] I looked at this you know on the natural
[30:38] side and on the spiritual I felt like
[30:40] you know it is time for the bride to get
[30:42] up now. You know things are changing.
[30:45] usually you know a military uh thing and
[30:48] you know army things you know these are
[30:49] all headed by men usually you know the
[30:52] journals and colonels and all those
[30:53] people but this time it was a a
[30:56] different thing altogether
[30:58] uh I'm not saying that it has got any
[30:59] you know significance but still you know
[31:01] I see it you know uh in the natural when
[31:04] things happen brother said that you know
[31:06] uh there is this bulakart age there is
[31:09] this automobile age and there is this uh
[31:12] astronaut age so when people are trying
[31:15] to reach mass you know set up colonies
[31:17] there the message moves along right you
[31:21] see so what you see in the spir in the
[31:23] physical also has you know uh certain
[31:25] implications in the spiritual
[31:28] also so uh looking at those things and
[31:31] you know like I said the economy is you
[31:34] know shaking everywhere there are
[31:36] tariffs and everybody's like you know
[31:37] confused if you know what is to be done
[31:40] and in the midst of all this confusion
[31:43] okay We have a place where we can rest.
[31:46] We know that it is not money that is
[31:48] going to save us. It is not gold that is
[31:50] going to save us. It is not our
[31:52] intelligence that is going to save us.
[31:54] You know, it is only purely the word of
[31:56] God. Amen. You know, because uh in the
[31:59] message uh broken systems and uh uh and
[32:03] another message, you know, brother
[32:05] Brandon said about uncertain sound. You
[32:08] know there is uncertainty everywhere but
[32:11] we have a place to be rested by the
[32:14] grace of God you know and we know that
[32:17] we are in safe hands and there is
[32:19] nothing that we need to do because
[32:21] everything has already been done for us.
[32:23] All we can do is just trust believe have
[32:27] faith. So coming to this uh uh a few
[32:30] days back you know I was sitting with uh
[32:32] my kids and we were uh having a morning
[32:34] altar and praying and you know a certain
[32:37] topic came to us and it was about how to
[32:40] pray how to you know reach out to God
[32:43] and when this was happening and I in my
[32:46] mind in my heart I thought you know it
[32:48] would be so nice if I could share this
[32:49] in the church also at some point in time
[32:51] you know because uh like I always say
[32:54] that you know we are special people we
[32:57] are not like common you know uh uh
[33:00] people I mean special when I say special
[33:01] I mean bought by the blood of Christ you
[33:04] know we are not just people who are
[33:07] struggling in life and you know don't
[33:08] know what to do just confused you know
[33:11] sometime praying to a tree sometimes
[33:13] praying to a you know an animal and you
[33:15] know doing all that no we have a very
[33:17] clear vision we know who we are so it
[33:20] helps you know and this is these are you
[33:23] know family secrets which have been
[33:24] handed down from Adam downwards to his
[33:27] own lineage. So these things are pretty
[33:30] much in the Bible. But the message in
[33:32] this last age has come up and opened up
[33:35] these mysteries and these things to you
[33:37] know and in this time basically and many
[33:40] prophets wanted to see you know our time
[33:42] when you know uh we will see a body
[33:46] change and you know people changing
[33:48] alive you know changing their bodies
[33:50] alive and going into heaven and the
[33:53] mysteries which are going to be opened
[33:54] you know the seven seals a lot of
[33:56] prophets including Daniel here wanted to
[33:58] see it but then you know the Lord said
[34:00] and it is not for you. Right? Okay. At
[34:02] the end time, you know, uh there will be
[34:04] a race. There will be people to whom it
[34:07] will be revealed.
[34:08] So, uh when we look at the scripture
[34:11] that we read here, you know, Daniel is
[34:13] making a supplication. He knows he read
[34:16] the book of Jeremiah and he knew by the
[34:19] books the calculation that you know
[34:21] about uh you know about two years is
[34:23] remaining. Okay. around about two years
[34:26] is remaining for our slavery and bondage
[34:29] in Babylon to get over. Now the
[34:31] important thing is that even if God has
[34:34] given a time that you know you will be
[34:37] in bondage for x amount of years, it is
[34:40] important and it behooves us as people
[34:44] to pray for it to come to pass. Okay?
[34:48] Because if you see uh in the book of
[34:51] Exodus when uh not just in the book of
[34:53] Exodus but in the book of Genesis when
[34:55] Abraham was giving an offering of
[34:58] sacrifice and by the way he got tired
[35:01] and you know he just doze off and when
[35:03] that happened God said that you know
[35:06] because you slept because you fell
[35:09] asleep your kids will go into slavery
[35:12] for 400 years. Now the prophecy was 400
[35:16] years. Okay. But in reality, what had
[35:19] happened is when you look at the book of
[35:22] Exodus, people were there in Egypt and
[35:25] they were actually
[35:27] enjoying. They were not crying out to
[35:29] God for, you know, Lord, take us back to
[35:32] our promised land. You know, we are
[35:34] slaves here. They did not realize that
[35:35] they are slaves. They thought they are
[35:37] equal citizens. What is the problem? You
[35:39] know, okay, maybe we have uh, you know,
[35:41] we we have our rights. We can, you know,
[35:44] do whatever we want. We have freedom of
[35:46] speech. We have so many freedoms here,
[35:48] okay? In this country in Egypt. But they
[35:51] didn't realize it is not their country.
[35:53] You see, so then God is looking and you
[35:56] know God is waiting like okay 350 years
[35:58] over 400 years over. Nobody's asking you
[36:01] know nobody's saying you know God we
[36:03] want to go back home. This is not our
[36:05] place. Okay we might have big cars here,
[36:08] big houses here. We might be very
[36:09] successful but in spite of all this this
[36:12] is not our place. You know because this
[36:15] flesh always falls. You know we fall
[36:18] sick. We have so many problems here.
[36:21] This is not the you know brother said
[36:22] that uh this body is like a stinking
[36:25] urinal. No matter how much I deck it up
[36:27] with good clothes and you know uh you
[36:31] know all that denting painting and you
[36:33] know you know these days I saw here
[36:35] people putting eyelashes colored
[36:38] eyelashes like you know red and black
[36:40] and stuff. So no matter what you do, how
[36:42] beautifification, how much
[36:43] beautifification you do, eventually it
[36:45] is going to rot right you know when the
[36:48] Lord calls you back home even your
[36:51] family cannot keep this body. This is
[36:53] not our home. Okay. So at some point in
[36:57] time they had to cry out and cry out and
[37:02] say to Lord oh please let us out from
[37:05] here we don't want to stay. Okay. So
[37:08] this already happened with them and in
[37:10] the book of Exodus if you see it
[37:13] extended their slavery was supposed to
[37:15] be for 400 years but when it became 430
[37:19] years and still nobody's asking you know
[37:21] nobody's saying we want to go back to
[37:22] Israel then you know God had no other
[37:24] choice. He rose up a pharaoh who did not
[37:28] know Joseph. That's what it says in the
[37:30] Bible. And now the pharaoh started
[37:34] persecuting them. Right. Persecuting
[37:36] them big time. Yes. Okay. Making them
[37:40] work overtime and you know doing all
[37:43] those things to them and just
[37:45] frustrating them to the core. And that
[37:48] is when you know people started shouting
[37:50] and they cried out oh my god this is not
[37:53] our place. This is not where we are
[37:55] supposed to be. You know there's freedom
[37:56] of speech, freedom of this, freedom of
[37:58] that. You know you can dress the way you
[38:00] want to. You can do what this is not.
[38:02] This is just an eyewash. This is not the
[38:04] place where we want to be, you know,
[38:06] forever because we have a new body
[38:09] waiting for us, a much better and
[38:12] magnificent place, you know, that the
[38:14] Lord has prepared for us and we cannot
[38:16] get you know cozy in this body. So we
[38:19] have to I mean you know at that point in
[38:21] time uh Amram from uh the tribe of Levi
[38:25] he got up he started praying and you
[38:28] have to also see you know when a godly
[38:31] parent okay when they pray they go on
[38:34] their knees God does move. Yes. Okay.
[38:38] And that is the way that you know our
[38:40] families and you know our see these
[38:42] things are all written in the Bible but
[38:45] these are family secrets
[38:48] for the children of Adam.
[38:52] Okay. Cain can only impersonate.
[38:56] Okay. He named one of the cities Ino.
[38:59] Okay. Cain. But that was just an
[39:01] impersonation. Right. Okay. He didn't
[39:04] have Ino. It was you know the lineage of
[39:07] Adam. The seventh from Adam was Ino and
[39:10] Ino saw body change. Okay. The same way
[39:14] we are the seventh from the uh you know
[39:18] first church age. This is the seventh
[39:20] church age which is coming to an end.
[39:21] Although we are living in the bride age
[39:23] but still this is the seventh church age
[39:26] which is going on which will see a body
[39:27] change. Okay. This is our promise.
[39:30] So in order to look at that now uh what
[39:33] we also want to do right now is just see
[39:36] how you know an individual who is
[39:39] sitting here in bondage in slavery is
[39:43] now getting on his knees 2 years before
[39:46] the time gets over because he knew what
[39:48] happened in Egypt. He knows that you
[39:50] know if we don't pray this bondage will
[39:53] go beyond although the prophecy is for
[39:55] 70 years it will still
[39:57] extend. Okay. So uh just like you know
[40:01] brother Brandham said you know I predict
[40:03] he said he he didn't say I prophesy he
[40:04] said I predict around 1977 okay now the
[40:08] thing here is that although dates might
[40:11] be given in the Bible in the book of
[40:12] Jeremiah he very clearly said you know
[40:14] 70 years okay you'll be in bondage so
[40:19] David started uh sorry Daniel started
[40:21] calculating he said now okay we are at
[40:23] 68 years now is the time when you know
[40:26] we have to start praying so that in 70
[40:28] we are out of this place, out of
[40:30] bondage. Okay, just before the time
[40:33] comes. They didn't do it in the time
[40:35] of Egypt when they were in slavery. So,
[40:38] do you want to read it? Let's go to, you
[40:40] know, Exodus chapter
[40:47] 1. Uh, Exodus, the second book of the
[40:53] Bible. Yeah.
[41:13] uh chapter 1, I'll read from verse 7
[41:15] onwards. And the children of Israel were
[41:18] fruitful and increased abundantly and
[41:20] multiplied and waxed exceedingly mighty
[41:23] and the land was filled with them.
[41:26] And you know what? Nothing is happening.
[41:28] They're happy and multiplying and you
[41:30] know just filling up Egypt.
[41:34] Okay? And
[41:37] uh now there arose up a new king over
[41:40] Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he
[41:43] said unto his people, "Behold, the
[41:44] children of Israel are more and mightier
[41:47] than we. Come, let us deal wisely with
[41:50] them, lest they multiply." And it come
[41:52] to pass that when there fallth any
[41:55] fallth out any war, they join also our
[41:58] enemies and fight against us. So get
[42:00] them up out of the land. And therefore
[42:03] they did set over them task masters to
[42:06] afflict them with their burdens. And
[42:08] they built for and they built for the
[42:10] Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithome and
[42:13] Ramses. But more they but the more they
[42:16] afflicted them, the more they multiplied
[42:18] and grew. And they were grieved because
[42:21] the children of Israel. And the
[42:23] Egyptians made the children of Israel to
[42:26] serve with rigor. And they made their
[42:28] lives bitter with hard bondage in
[42:30] mortar, in break, and in all manner of
[42:33] service in the field. And the service
[42:35] wherein they made them serve was rigor.
[42:39] They made their life very hard. Very
[42:41] hard. Okay. And these uh Israeli people
[42:44] at that time, they didn't realize, you
[42:46] know, we're in bondage. They thought we
[42:47] are multiplying now. This is our
[42:48] country. We are more than you know the
[42:50] natives here. So you know we are almost
[42:53] like rulers and we can rule here and you
[42:55] know we've got political positions and
[42:57] all those things. They're happy and
[42:58] happy to the core. Didn't even realize
[43:00] that they're in bondage. You know that
[43:02] is the way things are. And the king of
[43:04] Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives which
[43:07] of which the name of one was Cphara and
[43:10] the name of the other was Pua. And he
[43:13] said, "When ye do the office of the
[43:16] midwife of to the Hebrew woman and see
[43:19] them upon these stools, if it be a son,
[43:22] then he shall kill him. But if it be a
[43:25] daughter, then he shall then she shall
[43:27] live." But the midwives feared God and
[43:30] did not as the king of Egypt commanded
[43:33] them, but saved the men alive. And the
[43:37] king of Egypt called for the midwives
[43:40] and sent unto them that why have they
[43:42] you know all those things happened. Now
[43:44] what happens here is that you see it
[43:46] comes to a level where you know uh
[43:48] persecution starts happening. Okay. And
[43:52] this is exactly what you know also
[43:54] brother Brandham said before the rapture
[43:57] happens there will come a squeeze. Yes.
[44:00] Okay. Now this squeeze will motivate us
[44:05] to you know just recognize where are we
[44:08] standing right now. Okay. It'll give us
[44:11] the faith to go out of this place. Yes.
[44:15] Okay. So you know rapture the word
[44:18] rapture is not there in the Bible.
[44:19] Instead the Greek Bible says a word
[44:21] called harpazo. Harpazo means to snatch
[44:25] away. Okay. So that is what God is going
[44:27] to do. like you know he's going to come
[44:29] and snatch us away from this body. Okay.
[44:32] And put us in a new body. Yes. So now
[44:35] here it says that you know they were
[44:37] absolutely troubled. God you know made
[44:39] sure that you know they cry out. Also
[44:41] one more point I want to make here is
[44:44] that God does not forget. You know when
[44:47] they started persecuting the the
[44:52] Israelis they started killing the boys.
[44:55] Yes. you know small children
[44:58] and when they left Egypt
[45:02] okay when they left Egypt
[45:05] after say about 40 odd years okay
[45:10] and God did not forget right you know at
[45:14] one point in time they killed my
[45:17] children that's true and when the you
[45:21] know uh Passover came they are leaving
[45:24] for Isra The next day the angel of the
[45:27] death passed through Egypt and
[45:30] slaughtered not just the firstborn of
[45:33] Egypt but even the cattle.
[45:37] Okay. So you have to remember that you
[45:39] know God always remembers. He does.
[45:43] Okay. He does.
[45:50] So looking at this you know all these
[45:53] things that have happened in the past
[45:56] Daniel the prophet realized that you
[45:59] know what if we don't pray for
[46:01] redemption right now before the time
[46:04] ends okay we will be in bondage and our
[46:08] bondage will extend and if it extends
[46:11] then God will have to do something to
[46:14] make Let's pray for it. Okay. So before
[46:18] anything like that happens, Daniel being
[46:20] wise and he had the scriptures like we
[46:23] have today, he went ahead, he read and
[46:25] he now realized that you know there is
[46:28] only so much time left. Now I have to
[46:30] you know we have to start praying and
[46:31] you know getting ready to leave Babylon.
[46:34] Whereas if you see uh Daniel was the
[46:36] prime minister there. He was in a very
[46:38] good position in uh Babylon. Okay. and
[46:43] uh he was not uh like you know
[46:44] persecuted or he didn't have problems
[46:46] like that but in spite of being in a
[46:49] position of power Daniel still realized
[46:53] this is not my place
[46:55] this is not we where we are going to get
[46:58] blessings their blessings is tied in
[47:01] their land
[47:04] that is why even while dying Joseph you
[47:06] know and those patriarchs they said that
[47:08] you know don't leave our bones here
[47:10] right because they know that there is
[47:12] the resurrection coming a son of man
[47:14] coming and when he raises up you know
[47:17] our bodies even though we be dead we
[47:20] will also raise up with him so you know
[47:22] what I am dead I can't do anything and
[47:25] uh you know his father also you know he
[47:28] put their hands under his thighs and
[47:30] made them swear that you know what
[47:32] whatever happens don't leave my bones
[47:36] here okay because there was a
[47:39] resurrection which was supposed to
[47:40] happen and
[47:42] says the oldest book chronologically in
[47:44] the Bible is the book of Job. That's
[47:47] right. Okay. The book of Job was you
[47:51] know written I don't know when it was
[47:53] written but it happened before even
[47:55] before
[47:56] Abraham. So Job had seen in his vision
[48:00] that you know even if the skin worms eat
[48:02] this devour this flesh I shall see my
[48:05] redeemer with these eyes. Okay. And the
[48:08] place where he saw that is where he
[48:12] built the cave of Makfella. Okay. And
[48:15] that is the reason why these folks you
[48:18] know all the patriarchs Abraham and you
[48:20] know Abraham went there he said you know
[48:22] I want to bury my wife here. So uh the
[48:26] local person there said okay you can
[48:28] bury you are amongst you know you're
[48:29] like one of us so you can very well go
[48:31] ahead you know take the cave bury your
[48:33] wife there. No we have no problem. He
[48:34] said no I will pay and take this land so
[48:39] that later on you can never you know put
[48:43] a claim on this. This is my land. Okay.
[48:47] So that is why he went ahead he bought
[48:49] the cave of Makfella. He you know buried
[48:52] Sarah there and that is where you know
[48:54] almost everybody else was buried and
[48:57] that is where you know Joseph. So that
[48:58] is why they had this you know like I
[49:01] said these things are coming from family
[49:04] to family to family you know um I'm
[49:07] forgetting the name of the person there
[49:09] but you know the locals there did not
[49:10] know the significance of that cave right
[49:13] okay they thought it is just folklore or
[49:15] some story somebody is being saying all
[49:17] these things Job who knows about all
[49:19] that but Abraham knew that Job saw that
[49:22] place you know that is where he did it
[49:24] so that is why he went he purchased that
[49:26] place he put his dead there, buried them
[49:29] there. And then when Jesus rose up, all
[49:32] these people who were there, you know,
[49:34] they had, you know, they had this faith
[49:37] that even if we die, you know, our dead
[49:40] bones 2,000 years in that cave, they
[49:43] will still come back to life, you know.
[49:46] So, uh, because that is the kind of
[49:48] faith, you know, today the Abraham seed
[49:50] has. Abraham didn't see didn't he he
[49:53] didn't see that vision. It was Job who
[49:54] saw that vision and it was Job who you
[49:56] know looked at that mak as cave. Okay.
[50:00] So now coming back to the point when
[50:02] this happens
[50:05] uh Daniel coming back to Daniel now he
[50:08] knew that you know what this is what is
[50:10] going to happen. We are going to go out
[50:11] of this place our redemption is coming
[50:13] nigh. So then he sits down to pray. Now
[50:17] when he prays, you know, once again,
[50:19] like I said, there is a confidence in a
[50:23] believer's prayer because you know why?
[50:26] Uh there is another person who is
[50:28] praying in the Bible and you know he's
[50:30] mocking that is uh Elijah. Do you want
[50:34] to read it? He him making fun of the
[50:36] others in on Mount Carmel. I think it is
[50:41] uh first kings. Yeah, first kings.
[50:48] And
[50:50] uh you know like brother sometimes my
[50:53] Bibles pages stick together
[50:58] so it takes a little bit of
[51:03] time. Yeah. Here we go.
[51:07] Okay. Have it
[51:10] here. First Kings chapter 18.
[51:17] verse I would want to read from verse 20
[51:20] so that you know um you get a little
[51:22] background of what is happening here 20
[51:24] and 21
[51:28] okay got it yeah I have sent unto the
[51:31] children of Israel and gathered prophets
[51:33] together okay so now what is happening
[51:34] here is a mount caramel showdown Elijah
[51:38] is fed up he's like you know the people
[51:40] sometimes they believe in bal sometimes
[51:42] they are like you know Elohim or you
[51:45] know Jehovah is God and now he says that
[51:48] you know what finally make up your mind
[51:51] are you going in the world or are you
[51:53] staying in the message okay you can't
[51:55] keep doing both you know half the time
[51:59] you are in the message rest of the times
[52:01] you are in the world sometimes you're
[52:03] behaving like a believer sometimes
[52:06] you're behaving like you know you don't
[52:07] know what is going to happen okay so
[52:10] here Elijah says that you know make up
[52:12] your point right okay if you are with
[52:15] Bal stay there if you are in the message
[52:18] stay here okay don't keep mixing don't
[52:21] you know sometimes uh you know you
[52:23] believe in God other times you don't
[52:25] believe you know sometimes you are uh
[52:27] scared other times you are like oh no
[52:29] yes yes yes you know so here is a
[52:32] decisive
[52:34] uh decision that they have to take okay
[52:36] so now coming to it uh we will read
[52:38] further so 21st verse we'll
[52:42] And Elijah came unto the people and
[52:44] said, "How long, how long halt E between
[52:48] two opinions? If Lord be God, follow
[52:51] him. But if Bal, then follow him." And
[52:55] the people answered him, "Not a word."
[52:57] They didn't have the confidence to say
[52:58] that, you know what, Lord is God. Okay.
[53:02] All right. Now, these are believers.
[53:03] These are Israeli people. Okay. So uh
[53:06] they are at this point in time they're
[53:08] like you know what we are kind of
[53:10] neutral you know we go with sometimes
[53:13] you know we are okay with what the world
[53:16] is teaching sometimes okay and sometimes
[53:19] you know we yeah I mean we have to go to
[53:21] the message because our parents were in
[53:22] the meetings you know they know about
[53:24] the prophet we are from a message
[53:26] background we are from a message family
[53:28] so yeah we have to follow it but on the
[53:31] contrary the works are all showing the
[53:32] other you know otherwise okay most of
[53:35] the time in the So they are not decisive
[53:36] here. So he says make up your mind. Now
[53:39] the next verse, then said Elijah unto
[53:42] the people, I even I only remain a
[53:45] prophet of the Lord, but Bal's prophets
[53:48] are 450 men.
[53:52] Let them therefore give us two bulocks,
[53:54] and let them choose one bulock for
[53:56] themselves, and cut it in pieces, and
[53:59] lay it on the wood, and put no fire
[54:02] under. I will dress the other bulock and
[54:05] lay it on the wood and put no fire under
[54:09] and call e on the name of the of your
[54:12] gods and I will call the name of the
[54:14] lord. This is l o r d capital. Okay. And
[54:19] the god thatth by fire let him be god.
[54:24] And all people answered and said it is
[54:27] well spoken. They said okay fine let us
[54:29] do this once and for all and you know
[54:30] get over with this. Now Elijah gave them
[54:34] the opportunity, the prophets of Bal,
[54:36] okay, to do their
[54:39] stuff. And Elijah said unto the prophets
[54:41] of Bal, "Choose you one bulock for
[54:44] yourselves and dress it first for you
[54:46] are many. You have 450 prophets, you
[54:49] know, so you are a huge majority. So you
[54:52] guys gohead first." Okay. But he
[54:56] knew he knew that the way to approach
[55:00] God is the evening sacrifice. So he has
[55:04] all the time in the world till evening
[55:06] time. Okay. He knew the
[55:08] password. Okay. So he was like okay
[55:10] fine. You know what you guys go ahead.
[55:12] You go first because you know it's your
[55:13] first move is yours. You know uh and
[55:16] you're more 400 people. So you know each
[55:18] of you even if you say a small prayer it
[55:20] will take a long time. So you know what
[55:22] you guys go first. Okay. And they took
[55:25] the bulock which was given them and they
[55:26] rested called on the name of Bal from
[55:29] morning even until the noon okay
[55:33] afternoon
[55:34] saying oh Bal hear us but there was no
[55:38] voice nor any that answered and they
[55:42] leaped upon the altar which they made
[55:44] okay finally they're going crazy now
[55:46] they've made an altar they you know they
[55:48] put the animal there and they're crying
[55:50] shouting screaming nothing is happening
[55:52] they're getting frustrated now they
[55:53] started jumping on the altar itself.
[55:55] Okay. And like you know where are you?
[55:58] And when Elijah sees this he is like it
[56:02] came to pass at noon. Okay. Now Elijah
[56:04] knows that I have time. Okay. Let them
[56:06] do all these mockery. Okay. When the
[56:08] noon time comes he knows that you know
[56:10] now it is time for me to start preparing
[56:12] and getting them off the scene. So then
[56:14] you know he was like and it came to pass
[56:16] at noon that Elijah mocked them. Okay.
[56:18] And now he started making fun of them
[56:21] and he's like said cry louder. Okay, you
[56:26] cry loud for he is a god. If for he is a
[56:29] god either he's taking either he's
[56:32] talking to somebody probably you know
[56:33] he's busy on the phone or something you
[56:35] know you're god so you know louder he's
[56:38] not able to hear you so you you know
[56:39] scream louder and then you know if for
[56:42] he's a god he's either talking or he's
[56:44] pursuing or maybe he's in the metro or
[56:46] he's in the car or something he's
[56:47] traveling going somewhere so you shout
[56:50] louder he's not able to hear you okay or
[56:53] he's in a journey or per adventure He
[56:58] sleepeth.
[57:00] So he must be awakened. So wake him up.
[57:03] Shout, scream, jump, do whatever you
[57:05] have to do. Come on. Now you understand
[57:07] when he's mocking these people, you
[57:10] know, Elijah must have so much of
[57:12] confidence that you know what, next is
[57:15] my turn. Okay? And if it doesn't happen,
[57:18] the fire doesn't come in, you know, they
[57:20] I am one to 450. the 450 and the people
[57:24] you know standing here they will be
[57:26] mocking me okay so you understand the
[57:29] kind of confidence that Elijah had at
[57:31] that point in time he's he knew by
[57:32] default it is going to happen definitely
[57:35] you know the fire is absolutely going to
[57:38] come down there is no doubt about it in
[57:40] his mind otherwise you know what he
[57:41] would have done all these people are
[57:42] doing something you know he would have
[57:43] been kneeling down and he would have
[57:45] been praying Lord please please in the
[57:48] evening when I pray please come okay
[57:50] please send the fire he's not doing all
[57:52] that. That's right. He is a son of God.
[57:55] He knows the password. Okay? So, he
[57:58] knows that, you know, if I put this
[57:59] password, it has to open, right? Okay.
[58:02] And then uh and then, okay, now this is
[58:05] what verse 28. They cried aloud and cut
[58:08] themselves. Now, you know what? Crying
[58:10] and all is not helping. Now, they
[58:11] started beating themselves up. You know,
[58:13] they're cutting themselves up. And you
[58:15] know, even then, Bal is not the bulock
[58:17] is already cut and you know, put it
[58:19] there. But then they're like, "No, this
[58:20] is not enough. Now the prophets have to
[58:22] cut themselves also and they're bleeding
[58:24] and shouting and
[58:26] screaming. And it says here that they
[58:28] cut themselves after their manner with
[58:31] knives and lacets till blood gushed out
[58:34] upon them. Their own blood is now
[58:36] flowing. Okay, but still no answer. And
[58:39] it came to pass when midday was passed,
[58:42] they prophesied until the time of the
[58:44] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[58:47] there was neither voice nor any answer
[58:50] nor any that regarded. Okay. So they
[58:53] tried everything till the evening
[58:56] sacrifice time. Now Elijah had already
[58:58] you know he knew that you know now is
[58:59] the time you know now what happens and
[59:04] Elijah said unto the people come near me
[59:06] now. Okay, now this is the real test
[59:08] that is going to
[59:10] happen. All the people came near to him
[59:13] and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[59:15] that was broken
[59:16] down. And Elijah took 12 stones
[59:19] according to the number of the tribes of
[59:21] the sons of Jacob. Unto him the word of
[59:23] the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be
[59:27] thy name.
[59:29] And with the stones he built an altar in
[59:31] the name of the Lord. And he made a
[59:33] trench about the altar as great as would
[59:37] contain two measures of seed. And he put
[59:40] wood in order and cut the bulock in
[59:42] pieces and laid him on the wood and
[59:46] said, "Fill four barrels with water and
[59:48] pour on the burnt sacrifice and on the
[59:51] wood." Okay. Now they should not say
[59:53] that, you know what, it was already lit
[59:55] up. So what he did, he poured water
[59:58] around it. Okay? Now water depicts the
[1:00:00] word. Okay? Your sacrifice has to be
[1:00:03] covered in the word. Okay? So he did
[1:00:07] that and then he said, "Do it a second
[1:00:10] time." And they did it a second time.
[1:00:12] And he said, "Do it a third time." And
[1:00:13] they did it a third time. And the water
[1:00:16] ran round about the altar and he filled
[1:00:18] the trench also with water. And it came
[1:00:20] to pass at the time of the offering of
[1:00:24] the evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[1:00:27] prophet came near and said,
[1:00:30] Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[1:00:34] Israel, let it be known this day that
[1:00:37] thou art God in Israel.
[1:00:42] You see that? And he is giving the
[1:00:45] proper address, okay? The proper
[1:00:48] acknowledgement. He is not you know
[1:00:50] referring to some god here and there
[1:00:52] because Abraham, Isaac, these are people
[1:00:56] with a promise. Yes. Okay. Now I you
[1:00:59] know you know what I I by profession I'm
[1:01:02] a lawyer. So when you go to court what
[1:01:04] happens is the uh there are different
[1:01:07] layers of courts. Okay. There is a
[1:01:09] district court, there is a provincial
[1:01:11] court and there is a federal court.
[1:01:13] Okay. I it's pretty much same in all the
[1:01:15] countries. Same here in Canada also.
[1:01:17] There are different layers. So a smaller
[1:01:19] court then a higher court and then the
[1:01:22] topmost court and it behooves the
[1:01:25] smaller courts they have to you know if
[1:01:27] you have to get a judgment from them
[1:01:29] what uh we usually do is we go to the
[1:01:32] lower courts where the lower courts you
[1:01:34] know and we say that you know what uh
[1:01:36] this is our petition and with the
[1:01:39] petition what we also do is we attach
[1:01:41] judgments of the Supreme Court. Okay. So
[1:01:45] when the Supreme Court judgments are
[1:01:47] attached with your petition, the lower
[1:01:50] court judge when he looks at it, he goes
[1:01:52] like, "Okay, so now the Supreme Court
[1:01:54] has already made a judgment on this. So
[1:01:56] there is no way a junior court can
[1:02:00] overrule the Supreme Court's judgment.
[1:02:03] Okay. So every time we present a case,
[1:02:06] we present the case with all the
[1:02:08] relevant Supreme Court judgments. Okay?
[1:02:10] So now whatever the rule, whatever the
[1:02:14] law, this judge cannot overrule a
[1:02:18] supreme court judgment. Okay? So in the
[1:02:21] same way Elijah knows that the Lord the
[1:02:25] our God does not change. Okay. So
[1:02:29] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:02:32] yesterday, today and forever. Amen.
[1:02:35] Okay. So whenever we go in prayer okay
[1:02:38] now I have to actually come to the you
[1:02:40] know anatomy of the prayer you know we
[1:02:41] have to break down Daniel's prayer also
[1:02:44] we have say about half an hour we'll get
[1:02:46] there so you know coming to this uh okay
[1:02:49] so this is what he does now Elijah knows
[1:02:53] the password the password is the supreme
[1:02:54] court judgments basically for us so you
[1:02:56] know even before going there I know that
[1:02:58] you know my case matches with this so
[1:02:59] this is the supreme court judgment I
[1:03:01] know even before appearing in front of
[1:03:03] the court I know that you know the judge
[1:03:05] Well, this is the judgment that he's
[1:03:06] going to give because there is a
[1:03:07] judgment I have from the Supreme Court
[1:03:09] which I'm going to offer to him and you
[1:03:10] know he has no way to get out of it. So
[1:03:13] you bind the judge with these judgments.
[1:03:17] So you bind God with the word. Yeah.
[1:03:22] Because he cannot go against the word.
[1:03:26] Right? So now a believer knows that you
[1:03:29] know if I have to bring fire down from
[1:03:31] heaven this is the password. You
[1:03:35] understand? Because in the book of
[1:03:36] Leviticus, God has given all the rules
[1:03:39] and what will be you know of God if he
[1:03:42] doesn't follow his own rules. Yeah. So
[1:03:45] you have to see everything was already
[1:03:48] laid down before Elijah did this. So he
[1:03:52] knew by revelation.
[1:03:54] Coming to this point, you know, I have
[1:03:56] another detour that I want to take. Uh
[1:03:59] when it comes to the point
[1:04:00] of
[1:04:02] sacrifices, you know, uh in the garden
[1:04:04] of
[1:04:05] Eden, Abel had a
[1:04:08] sacrifice. Cain also had a
[1:04:11] sacrifice. Okay? Now, having a sacrifice
[1:04:14] is just not enough. Right? Brother said
[1:04:17] that Cain was a religious
[1:04:20] person. Okay? His offerings were not
[1:04:23] rotten stuff that you know he brought he
[1:04:25] brought the best of what he had very
[1:04:28] beautiful and Abel's
[1:04:30] sacrifice was a lamb and an altar which
[1:04:34] is full of blood and you know all that
[1:04:37] not very pleasant sight to see but on
[1:04:40] the contrary Cain sacrifice the the
[1:04:43] offerings that he brought for all
[1:04:44] beautiful flowers and beautiful
[1:04:46] beautiful you know green and orange and
[1:04:48] all those colorful things and the fruits
[1:04:49] and all those things. Now the thing is
[1:04:53] that Abel had the
[1:04:55] revelation okay of the time and the
[1:04:59] season okay there is in the Bible God
[1:05:02] has given a time when you bring in the
[1:05:05] first fruits he does take offerings of
[1:05:08] the first fruits but the timing matters
[1:05:13] right it is you know after the harvest
[1:05:17] the first fruits that is when you know
[1:05:18] before the harvest they have you know
[1:05:20] they take it and and they have a wave
[1:05:21] offering and all those things are all in
[1:05:23] place. So Cain although he also brought
[1:05:26] an offering but it was out of season
[1:05:29] right that was not the season of the
[1:05:32] first fruits. Okay. So that is why that
[1:05:37] offering in spite of being somewhat
[1:05:40] matching with the word it did not
[1:05:42] because you have to be in season. You
[1:05:44] have to know today if you're sitting and
[1:05:46] praying that God please save America,
[1:05:50] Lord please save you know whatever it is
[1:05:54] a prayer which is kind of out of season
[1:05:58] because the prophet has already said
[1:06:01] certain things about certain countries.
[1:06:03] Okay. So there is no point you know we
[1:06:06] praying or we doing stuff which is
[1:06:08] contrary to the word right although in
[1:06:11] our minds we want everybody to be saved.
[1:06:13] We want you know America to flourish. We
[1:06:16] want Canada to flourish. We want
[1:06:18] everybody to flourish.
[1:06:20] But the vision that he had saw when I
[1:06:24] turned back I saw that you know I saw
[1:06:26] smoke and debris everywhere. Mhm. So
[1:06:30] that prayer doesn't really match up with
[1:06:33] you know what the times are saying,
[1:06:35] right? Yeah. I hope Lord the economy
[1:06:38] stabilizes. I hope that the the wars
[1:06:41] stop. I hope there is peace everywhere.
[1:06:43] And you know this is a prayer which is
[1:06:46] out of season. Right. Amen. So that is
[1:06:49] why we have to be the main cornerstone
[1:06:53] of this message and our life is
[1:06:56] revelation. That is where God has placed
[1:06:59] you know this
[1:07:01] church. It is not on Peter. Okay. It is
[1:07:04] not given on Jesus. It is a revelation.
[1:07:08] Okay. Where the church is placed. So
[1:07:10] coming back to this um Elijah thing.
[1:07:15] So he did the sacrifice and then you
[1:07:17] know what he said? He called on the name
[1:07:18] of the lord. He gave the proper address
[1:07:20] everything. You know like I said the
[1:07:22] supreme court judgments. He's quoting
[1:07:24] everything from the scriptures and he's
[1:07:26] putting it right there. And then he said
[1:07:28] that know this day. Uh I'm reading the
[1:07:31] 36th
[1:07:32] verse. And he said, "Lord God of
[1:07:34] Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel. Let it be
[1:07:37] known this day that thou art God in
[1:07:39] Israel and that I am thy servant and I
[1:07:41] have done these things at thy word. Hear
[1:07:44] me, oh Lord. hear me that these people
[1:07:46] may know that thou art the Lord God and
[1:07:50] thou has turned their heart back
[1:07:53] again. And then a fire and then the fire
[1:07:57] of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt
[1:08:00] sacrifice, the wood, the stone, the
[1:08:03] dust, and licked up the water that was
[1:08:05] in the trench. Yes. You know what the
[1:08:09] reason I took this scripture is because
[1:08:11] in the New
[1:08:13] Testament Bible says that Elijah was a
[1:08:18] man of like
[1:08:21] Yeah. like us.
[1:08:23] Okay. So you have to understand now I'm
[1:08:27] not talking as a church as a whole. I'm
[1:08:29] talking individually. Yes. Every
[1:08:33] brother, every sister, every child,
[1:08:36] every mother, every father who is
[1:08:38] present here has got the capability to
[1:08:43] bring down fire from heaven. Right.
[1:08:47] That's right. When you are standing in
[1:08:49] your position,
[1:08:52] right? So when you are a mother and you
[1:08:55] see your children going, you know, in
[1:08:57] trouble, having trouble, when you're
[1:08:59] standing in your post of duty, You know,
[1:09:02] you have the power to command, right?
[1:09:08] Not request, right? Okay. To tell the
[1:09:11] devil get lost. Yes. Amen. Yeah.
[1:09:15] Whatever the sickness, no matter how
[1:09:18] big, how small, you being a mother in
[1:09:21] the message, you know your position. You
[1:09:25] being a father in the message, you know
[1:09:28] your position. Amen. Right. You being a
[1:09:31] believer in the message, you know your
[1:09:33] position. It is nothing less than what
[1:09:36] Elijah is right here. That's right. You
[1:09:39] know, and that is why I say it this
[1:09:42] message is not a joke. It's not just,
[1:09:44] you know, one book that we come and we
[1:09:46] read every day, you know, in the morning
[1:09:48] and the evening like a ritual. No, it is
[1:09:50] not a game of church, church, church.
[1:09:52] This is a life. This is a life. Okay?
[1:09:56] And this life has come down from you
[1:10:00] know our forefathers handed down today
[1:10:03] to us in a platter.
[1:10:06] So many people have died to compile this
[1:10:08] book. You know so many people have given
[1:10:12] their lives. They have struggled. You
[1:10:14] know people like Paul who could have
[1:10:16] lived a very easy life. You know he was
[1:10:19] way too qualified for his time. He
[1:10:21] learned at the feet of Galiel. Okay. and
[1:10:24] he was going to be the next high priest
[1:10:25] or you know whoever it is. Okay, he
[1:10:28] threw everything away. He said this is
[1:10:30] all dumb.
[1:10:33] Okay, and he said that you know he led a
[1:10:35] life or he he became a tent maker.
[1:10:38] Right. Okay. And the whole day he was
[1:10:41] you know doing his tent making in the
[1:10:42] evening he used to take it sell it get
[1:10:45] the money you know use it for himself
[1:10:47] and for the churches. Right. Right. And
[1:10:49] help people. Right. Okay. And he lived
[1:10:53] in the Bible it says that you know he he
[1:10:55] asked somebody to get his code from
[1:10:57] throwas which means he had just one
[1:10:59] quote okay he's like you know when
[1:11:02] you're coming from throwas get my coat
[1:11:04] from there because the weather is
[1:11:05] changing okay I don't have anything to
[1:11:07] wear here so today when we have dozens
[1:11:10] of clothes to wear all those things you
[1:11:13] have to imagine that you know what many
[1:11:15] people went through many troubles many
[1:11:17] problems only to hand over this word to
[1:11:20] us okay given to us in a platter. We I
[1:11:23] like I said we have never done anything
[1:11:25] to merit it. It is just God's sovereign
[1:11:28] grace that you know we by some uh you
[1:11:31] know uh absolutely nothing that we have
[1:11:33] done but it is just his grace that you
[1:11:35] know we have been selected. Amen.
[1:11:38] Nothing that we could have done and the
[1:11:40] privilege is too much too much. Right.
[1:11:44] You know, like I said, you have the
[1:11:47] power, individual, each one of you has
[1:11:50] the power today to impart eternal life.
[1:11:53] Yes, that's right. Amen. You know, a
[1:11:55] life which will never end. You have the
[1:11:57] power.
[1:11:59] And we are kings and priests with God.
[1:12:03] You are not simple, you know, people who
[1:12:06] are just, you understand where the world
[1:12:08] is going today, right? you know praying
[1:12:11] to inanimate things doing all those I
[1:12:14] don't say it is right or wrong but the
[1:12:16] Bible says that you know what you are
[1:12:18] better than all that
[1:12:20] you know sometimes when you ask a mule
[1:12:22] you know who's your daddy you know he
[1:12:24] looks at the horse then he looks at the
[1:12:26] donkey then he looks at the horse then
[1:12:28] he looks at the donkey doesn't know
[1:12:30] where he's coming from right okay we are
[1:12:33] born of the spirit of God and we have
[1:12:36] the chance to call the Lord aba father
[1:12:40] So whatever your need, whatever your
[1:12:43] requirement, just put it to him and it
[1:12:46] will be answered. Again I said Elijah
[1:12:48] could bring fire from heaven, you can
[1:12:51] also do that
[1:12:53] provided you have the faith like Elijah
[1:12:56] had. Amen. Right? And the key the
[1:12:59] password Jesus Christ is same yesterday,
[1:13:02] today and forever. Right? Use it and
[1:13:05] your life is all set
[1:13:07] you know. Okay. So now coming back to
[1:13:10] Daniel you know the prayer of Daniel I
[1:13:11] want to uh go through that and also
[1:13:14] brother if you can put up the image of
[1:13:16] the temple uh you know that I
[1:13:19] send.
[1:13:21] Yes this is how uh can everybody see
[1:13:24] this?
[1:13:26] Now this is actually you know uh the
[1:13:30] image of the temple is put on vertically
[1:13:32] usually but because the dimensions of
[1:13:35] this screen is the the width is more
[1:13:38] than the height so I just turned it
[1:13:40] towards the north but usually if you see
[1:13:43] uh it'll be you know east will be facing
[1:13:45] the down and west is on top okay but
[1:13:49] nevertheless this is the whole setup
[1:13:51] this is how it is so when we go into
[1:13:54] prayer this is any prayer.
[1:13:58] Okay, this is where we start
[1:14:02] from in the outer court. This is the
[1:14:05] outer
[1:14:06] code. There is a brazen altar and there
[1:14:10] is a lav. L is where you wash. Okay. And
[1:14:15] brazen altar is where the sacrifices are
[1:14:17] given. The animals when they are given
[1:14:20] for sacrifice. Okay. It is sacrificed
[1:14:23] here in the outer court. In the outer
[1:14:25] court, the light comes from the sun.
[1:14:29] Okay? Because in the open, it's in the
[1:14:31] open place. Okay? Here the sun is a
[1:14:33] light, the one that we have here. Okay?
[1:14:38] And now you have to look at this
[1:14:40] pattern. This is how you approach the
[1:14:42] throne. Okay? And this is exactly how
[1:14:46] Daniel also did it in his prayer. I will
[1:14:49] read it. You can keep the picture on.
[1:14:51] I'm I'm reading from Daniel chapter
[1:14:54] 9 verse
[1:14:56] 5 or maybe I'll read from verse
[1:14:59] three. When we started we looked at the
[1:15:02] answer that came. Gabriel came down with
[1:15:04] an answer. Okay. Now before the answer
[1:15:07] comes there has to be a prayer. Now I am
[1:15:10] reading the prayer. Okay. How he
[1:15:12] approaches the throne. Okay.
[1:15:17] Daniel says, okay, you know what? I
[1:15:20] should read from the first verse. In the
[1:15:22] first year of Darius, the son of Asarus,
[1:15:25] the seed of the Mes, which was made king
[1:15:28] over the realm of the Shaldians, in the
[1:15:31] first year of his reign, I Daniel
[1:15:34] understood by the books the number of
[1:15:37] years whereof the word of the Lord came
[1:15:40] to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would
[1:15:42] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[1:15:46] of Jerusalem. So Jerusalem will be
[1:15:48] desolate for 70 years. He read and he
[1:15:50] knew from the book of Jeremiah. Okay. So
[1:15:53] that is when he starts moving and he
[1:15:54] starts
[1:15:56] praying and because he knows that the
[1:15:58] time is coming 70 years is coming. So
[1:16:01] two years before that he starts praying.
[1:16:04] Okay. I set my face unto the Lord God to
[1:16:07] seek by prayer and supplications with
[1:16:10] fasting and sackcloth and ashes. And I
[1:16:13] prayed unto the Lord my God and made my
[1:16:16] confession. Okay, now here is his prayer
[1:16:18] starting. It starts with a
[1:16:21] confession. And said, Oh Lord God, the
[1:16:25] great and dreadful God, keeping the
[1:16:27] covenant and mercy to them that love him
[1:16:30] and to them that keep his commandments.
[1:16:32] Okay, now his confession is starting. We
[1:16:34] have sinned. We have committed iniquity.
[1:16:37] We have done wickedly and have rebelled
[1:16:40] even by departing from thy percepts,
[1:16:42] from thy judgments. Neither have we
[1:16:44] hearkened unto thy servants, the
[1:16:46] prophets, which spake in thy name to our
[1:16:49] kings, our princes, our fathers, and all
[1:16:52] the people of the land. So now what he's
[1:16:54] doing, he's coming here, okay? He's
[1:16:57] washing and he's coming to the altar,
[1:17:00] okay? Where the sacrifice is. This is
[1:17:03] the first step. So when we start our
[1:17:05] prayer usually you know again this is
[1:17:08] not a law not a rule when you're in
[1:17:10] trouble you can't really you know you're
[1:17:13] stuck somewhere and you can't go back
[1:17:15] like oh my god you know what is the uh
[1:17:17] formula for this thing no but this is
[1:17:20] the most uh appropriate or
[1:17:23] most uh ideal situation okay the most
[1:17:26] ideal prayer the way you approach God is
[1:17:29] first you bring in the
[1:17:31] sacrifice okay where is a sacrifice. The
[1:17:34] sacrifice for us today is given by Jesus
[1:17:38] Christ. Okay. So when we start we go
[1:17:40] into like you know we go under the blood
[1:17:42] first. Okay. That is where that is what
[1:17:45] happens here in the brazen altar. Okay.
[1:17:48] So we when we start our prayer we go go
[1:17:51] like you know Lord we come under the
[1:17:53] shed blood of the lamb. Okay. It's not
[1:17:55] just fancy things that we are speaking.
[1:17:57] It has got an implication here. Okay.
[1:18:00] You want Gabriel to bring answer to you.
[1:18:03] you might as well follow what you know
[1:18:05] Daniel did. Yeah. So, and again Daniel
[1:18:09] was a very wise person. Okay? He was a
[1:18:11] wise prophet. He knew by the books this
[1:18:14] is what is supposed to be happening.
[1:18:15] Now, the reason why I'm telling you this
[1:18:17] is because each one of us here has
[1:18:20] access to
[1:18:22] the throne. Yes. Okay. It is you who is
[1:18:26] going to speak and things are going to
[1:18:30] happen. Okay. Like I said, you're not,
[1:18:33] you know, normal, you know, P peace
[1:18:35] officers and stuff. You are SW A special
[1:18:39] weapons and tactics. You are an elite
[1:18:41] league of people who are sitting here
[1:18:43] today bought by the blood of the lamb.
[1:18:45] So you need to know that you know what
[1:18:48] if I have to approach God, what is the
[1:18:50] way of approach? This is the way of
[1:18:51] approach. Okay, this is the way of
[1:18:53] approach. Here you come in and you know
[1:18:56] you confess your sins and put in between
[1:18:58] in in front of the altar. Okay, bring in
[1:19:01] the altar there. Bring in the blood.
[1:19:03] Bring in the bleeding word. Now you see
[1:19:07] the difference between denominations and
[1:19:09] uh you know us at this point in time is
[1:19:10] that we have the bleeding word. The
[1:19:12] bleeding word is the message of the r.
[1:19:15] Amen. Okay. We are not only relying on
[1:19:18] the fact that you know uh Jesus died
[1:19:21] 2,000 years back but today again the
[1:19:24] word was crucified on the altars of the
[1:19:27] denomination. Okay. So that is the
[1:19:29] bleeding word that has and you know what
[1:19:31] when I say that you know you look at
[1:19:34] Jesus when we say Jesus Christ okay what
[1:19:38] comes to our
[1:19:39] mind what comes to our mind mostly when
[1:19:43] I'm small you know the Hoffman's head or
[1:19:45] you that picture came to my mind but
[1:19:48] there is a difference right there is a
[1:19:51] difference when I say a red balloon what
[1:19:57] comes to your mind. My thought of a red
[1:19:59] balloon comes to my mouth as a word and
[1:20:03] the same thought comes in your mind now.
[1:20:05] Right? When I say red balloon, you start
[1:20:07] visualizing a red balloon. Right? In the
[1:20:10] same way, when I say Jesus Christ, what
[1:20:14] is what are you visualizing? You know
[1:20:16] what you're supposed to be visualizing?
[1:20:17] I don't know what you are visualizing,
[1:20:18] but what you're supposed to be
[1:20:20] visualizing
[1:20:21] is in the beginning was the word. Word
[1:20:24] was with God and the word was
[1:20:29] God. So when I say
[1:20:32] Jesus, Jesus is the word. Now word is
[1:20:35] not this book. It's not the it's not the
[1:20:37] pages. It's not the ink. But what is
[1:20:40] written inside of it? Okay. What is
[1:20:43] written inside of it? This is Jesus
[1:20:45] Christ. So this word in this age was
[1:20:50] crucified.
[1:20:51] Okay. Jesus physically when he came down
[1:20:54] was crucified 2,000 years back but today
[1:20:58] again the same word you know Jesus the
[1:21:01] same Jesus in the word form was
[1:21:04] crucified again true okay so that is our
[1:21:08] sacrifice that is our atonement when we
[1:21:11] realize that that is when we are coming
[1:21:13] under the blood right okay so once we do
[1:21:17] that here we confess our sins and you
[1:21:19] know we come under the blood and all
[1:21:21] that then we Move on to the holy place.
[1:21:25] Okay. In the holy place, there are three
[1:21:27] pieces of
[1:21:29] furniture. There is a
[1:21:31] lampstand. This has got seven
[1:21:33] candlesticks on it. Okay. Then there is
[1:21:36] a table with showbread there. It's got
[1:21:40] 12 pieces of bread there. Okay. And
[1:21:43] there is a golden altar. So when you
[1:21:45] look at Daniel's prayer, I'm not reading
[1:21:47] the whole thing because I just have 15
[1:21:49] minutes left. So if you go there you
[1:21:51] know I started with fifth now uh fifth
[1:21:54] verse now I go down to say about 12th
[1:21:57] verse. Okay
[1:22:00] here he's see he he's still you know
[1:22:03] reminding and you know confessing the
[1:22:05] sins and you know doing all this and
[1:22:07] bringing the sacrifice
[1:22:09] there. Uh I'm going to read from
[1:22:13] verse 11. Ye all all Israel have
[1:22:16] transgressed thy law even by departing
[1:22:19] that they might not obey thy voice.
[1:22:21] Therefore the curse is poured upon us
[1:22:23] and the oath that is written in the law
[1:22:25] of Moses the servant of God because we
[1:22:27] have sinned against him. And he had
[1:22:29] confirmed his words which he spoke
[1:22:31] against us and against our judges and
[1:22:33] against us by bringing upon us a great
[1:22:36] evil. For under the whole heaven had not
[1:22:39] been done as hath been done upon
[1:22:41] Jerusalem. As it is written in the law
[1:22:44] of Moses, all this evil is come upon us,
[1:22:46] yet made we not our prayer before the
[1:22:49] Lord our God, that we might turn from
[1:22:52] our iniquities, and understand thy
[1:22:54] truth. Therefore the therefore hath the
[1:22:57] Lord washed upon the evil and brought it
[1:23:00] upon us. For the Lord our God is
[1:23:02] righteous. Okay. Now he's slowly moving
[1:23:05] on to the golden altar. The golden altar
[1:23:08] is place where you put your worship.
[1:23:12] Okay. Here this altar is the altar for
[1:23:16] sacrifice. Okay. And here there is
[1:23:19] another al altar the golden altar. This
[1:23:21] is where your prayers and you know your
[1:23:24] uh worship goes on. So in your prayer
[1:23:27] you start by bringing in the sacrifice
[1:23:31] confessing your sins then you switch
[1:23:33] over to worship. Okay. Then you switch
[1:23:37] over to worship. Now there is a
[1:23:39] difference between a prayer and a
[1:23:40] worship. In a prayer we ask from God.
[1:23:44] Okay? We ask that you know God help me
[1:23:47] bless me with you know good health.
[1:23:49] Bless me with a car. Bless me with a
[1:23:51] house. Bless me with this. Give me this.
[1:23:53] Give me that. Give me this. This is a
[1:23:54] prayer. But worship you give to the
[1:23:57] Lord. Okay. I worship you. I give you
[1:24:01] honor. I give you thanks. I give you
[1:24:04] praise. You start giving now. Okay. And
[1:24:07] when you start doing
[1:24:09] that this you know this is the place
[1:24:12] where you do that. Okay. So here now he
[1:24:15] starts you know praising God. Therefore
[1:24:18] okay now I'm I'm going to
[1:24:22] uh verse 16 onwards. I mean you can read
[1:24:26] the whole prayer basically you know and
[1:24:27] this is the pattern of most of the
[1:24:29] prayers you know in the Bible if you see
[1:24:31] because the Holy Ghost you know comes
[1:24:34] with us and it prays with us. So it is
[1:24:37] essentially you know the Holy Ghost who
[1:24:39] leads us in prayer. Amen. Okay. So now
[1:24:42] when you see this the the pattern of the
[1:24:46] temple this is very very important
[1:24:48] because this pattern was given to Moses
[1:24:51] and the same pattern was followed by
[1:24:53] David. Okay. And then again the temple
[1:24:56] was broken down. Now Israel, like I
[1:24:59] said, there are like 12 shoe bread
[1:25:00] showbreads here. The 12 showbreads
[1:25:03] depict the 12 tribes of Israel. Okay?
[1:25:06] And the seven candlesticks. This is a
[1:25:08] candlestick with seven uh candle these
[1:25:10] things on it. These depict the seven
[1:25:12] church ages. Brother Benham, you know,
[1:25:15] he also drew the seven candlesticks with
[1:25:16] seven messengers and all those things.
[1:25:18] So this is the way to go for both, you
[1:25:20] know, Israel and the Gentiles. Okay? And
[1:25:23] once you do this that is when you
[1:25:26] approach the you know uh the most holy
[1:25:28] place here in this place there is no
[1:25:31] sunlight the candle stand the candle the
[1:25:34] lampstand this provides the light okay
[1:25:37] but when you go in
[1:25:38] here okay here the lamp is the light the
[1:25:42] ark of the covenant is the light there
[1:25:44] is no artificial light here okay in the
[1:25:47] most holy place and this when Jesus
[1:25:50] Christ died on the cross this uh curtain
[1:25:55] it rent it tore down. Now earlier only
[1:25:58] this high priest could go in but now
[1:26:02] even a common person like you and me can
[1:26:05] approach God and put our petitions
[1:26:07] directly to him. We don't need another
[1:26:10] mediator.
[1:26:12] You know we don't need a saint or you
[1:26:14] know anybody else. We can directly once
[1:26:17] we are under the blood here we can
[1:26:19] approach the throne of mercy. Okay. So
[1:26:23] this is the pattern of the prayer that
[1:26:27] Daniel followed. And this is the most
[1:26:30] ideal pattern. Sometimes you know you're
[1:26:33] in a hurry. You can't really follow the
[1:26:34] whole pattern. Doesn't matter. But still
[1:26:36] you have to know that you know what I
[1:26:38] know the password. This is what is the
[1:26:40] difference between a nominal Christian
[1:26:42] and a believer. You are not doing things
[1:26:45] just by mimicking something. You're
[1:26:48] doing things by revelation. You know
[1:26:50] that you know the reason why I am
[1:26:52] praying like this is because there is a
[1:26:54] pattern which is given in the Bible.
[1:26:56] Right? The reason why Abel brought a
[1:26:59] better sacrifice was because when uh
[1:27:02] Adam and Eve were sent out of the garden
[1:27:04] of Eden, you know, they were clothed
[1:27:07] with the skin of a lamb. Okay? And it
[1:27:12] was a bleeding skin that they were
[1:27:13] wearing. Okay? And Adam told this thing
[1:27:16] to his son
[1:27:18] Abel. And Abel knew that you know when
[1:27:20] my parents had sinned, God sacrificed
[1:27:24] his lamb. And clothed them with the skin
[1:27:28] of that lamb. So what I'm going to give
[1:27:31] to God is the same. It's not my
[1:27:33] sacrifice. It's what was in his mind is
[1:27:36] what I'm going to give him. Amen. He
[1:27:38] didn't bring fruits and
[1:27:39] vegetables. He gave the exact offering.
[1:27:42] So this pattern is not our pattern. This
[1:27:45] pattern is given by God. And this
[1:27:48] pattern is what we follow to approach
[1:27:50] him. You understand? This is not, you
[1:27:53] know, we don't have many fancy words.
[1:27:55] No, it doesn't matter. What matters is
[1:27:58] the God's chosen way of approaching him.
[1:28:02] Amen. You see that? And when you do this
[1:28:08] uh and you see this
[1:28:10] uh in the middle this is the place where
[1:28:13] Levi is you know in the all you know the
[1:28:17] temple on the all the four sides there
[1:28:20] were three
[1:28:23] uh tribes of Israel on each gate. Okay.
[1:28:28] But Levi did not have a place outside.
[1:28:33] Okay. Levi was right here in the middle.
[1:28:38] Yeah. This is the place. Yes. Okay. And
[1:28:41] also one more thing I want to mention
[1:28:42] here. Brother Brham when he went uh you
[1:28:45] know across uh the uh curtain of time.
[1:28:50] Okay. He said that you know where is
[1:28:52] Paul? He didn't see Paul there. Why?
[1:28:55] Because Paul was with his people in this
[1:28:59] section. Okay. Because although all of
[1:29:02] them are in heaven, there is there are
[1:29:03] sections.
[1:29:05] Okay. Where you know they don't cross
[1:29:06] over and you know go over. So he was in
[1:29:09] a different section here under the lion
[1:29:11] because uh the message tells us that
[1:29:13] there are like you know four ages. The
[1:29:16] iron sorry the lion age, the ox age, the
[1:29:20] man age and the last one is the eagle
[1:29:23] age. Yeah. So we are under the prophet
[1:29:26] the eagle age here. So this is where and
[1:29:30] these are the four gospels. The gospel
[1:29:32] of John, the gospel of Matthew, the
[1:29:34] gospel of Luke, the gospel of Mark. So
[1:29:37] you know it's all depicted in this
[1:29:39] temple. It this is the source of all
[1:29:42] your you know message information. So
[1:29:45] brother Brham did not come up with you
[1:29:47] know uh ideas from his own mind. This is
[1:29:50] the place where you know we get all the
[1:29:52] information and like I said this is very
[1:29:55] very privileged information.
[1:29:58] It's not open to everybody. You know
[1:30:01] people who don't even know that you know
[1:30:02] if God is one, God is three, is it three
[1:30:05] in one, one in three? You know, world is
[1:30:09] still confused with all
[1:30:10] that. But we, you know, there's a reason
[1:30:14] we are going in the rapture because we
[1:30:16] know our God. And the message says in
[1:30:18] the Bible says people who know their God
[1:30:20] shall do exploits. You know when they
[1:30:23] say know your God, you know, it's just
[1:30:26] not God is love. You know, what they
[1:30:29] call it this a prosperity gospel. Okay.
[1:30:32] God is not only love. He's a just God
[1:30:35] also. He punishes also. He passes
[1:30:38] judgment also. Who will tell about all
[1:30:40] these things? Right? You see, so there
[1:30:43] is a lake of fire that he has made.
[1:30:46] Okay? And there are some people and some
[1:30:48] angels and some you know who are going
[1:30:50] to go there. Yes.
[1:30:52] vessels of dishonor.
[1:30:54] Okay. So all those things are there. So
[1:30:57] we as message believers, as somebody who
[1:31:00] has got a prophet in this last age, who
[1:31:03] have got the revelation of what God
[1:31:05] wants from us right now are very clear
[1:31:08] in our mind, right? We are not confused
[1:31:10] like you know one day we are here, one
[1:31:12] day we are there. Whatever situation God
[1:31:15] keeps us in, we are absolutely happy.
[1:31:19] You know why? It says the Bible says
[1:31:21] pray without ceasing.
[1:31:24] Pray without ceasing. Okay. Now uh I
[1:31:28] have a little bit more than I want to
[1:31:30] speak on when it comes to prayer and I
[1:31:33] have got exactly 5 minutes. I will not
[1:31:36] exceed. So I will quickly you know uh
[1:31:39] take you through it. Now when it comes
[1:31:41] to praying you have to understand that
[1:31:42] you know first now you know the pattern
[1:31:44] of the prayer. Okay. You can pray any
[1:31:46] which ways you want to. I'm not you know
[1:31:48] giving you a you know a doctrine that
[1:31:50] you know if you don't pray like this it
[1:31:52] is not right or wrong. No I'm just
[1:31:53] telling you this is what is given you
[1:31:56] know in the message in the Bible. So if
[1:31:58] you follow it this is the best practice.
[1:31:59] If you don't want to do it uh or if you
[1:32:01] want to do something differently it's
[1:32:03] all this is not a rule this is not a law
[1:32:05] this is nothing like that it's just for
[1:32:07] you know your information. Okay. So when
[1:32:10] you get your revelation you know as to
[1:32:12] how I can approach God. The reason why
[1:32:14] I'm telling you this is because you know
[1:32:16] Elijah knew for certain. He knew for a
[1:32:19] fact that you know fire will come. The
[1:32:22] reason why he knew it is because he
[1:32:24] followed the protocol. Right. And the
[1:32:26] protocol given by God. So if you know
[1:32:29] the protocol you're you know you can
[1:32:32] bring fire down. Absolutely. Okay. So it
[1:32:35] is up to you. Now coming to the prayer.
[1:32:38] uh prayer is very very I mean it is the
[1:32:41] most potent and the most uh
[1:32:45] um d I wouldn't say dangerous but most
[1:32:48] uh effective weapon that god has given
[1:32:50] to the believer okay with prayers you
[1:32:53] can achieve much okay and it is very
[1:32:57] important sometimes we have to you know
[1:33:00] the devil is absolutely scared when a
[1:33:03] believer goes into prayer you know the
[1:33:06] whole kingdom you know shakes of for the
[1:33:10] devil you know when a believer goes down
[1:33:13] on his knees and he prays. Okay. So I'm
[1:33:16] not taking a lot of scriptures but uh I
[1:33:19] want to just uh show you one verse from
[1:33:23] the message
[1:33:26] probably does there is a message which
[1:33:28] brother Benham said uh took which is
[1:33:30] called does god ever change his mind
[1:33:33] about his word. Okay the fact is he
[1:33:35] never changes his mind. What the thought
[1:33:37] of God is perfect. Once he thought
[1:33:40] that's forever and it is good because he
[1:33:42] doesn't need to, you know, learn from
[1:33:44] his mistakes and stuff. He's perfect.
[1:33:47] But there is a detour. Sometimes God
[1:33:51] doesn't change his word. God doesn't
[1:33:53] change his mind. But sometimes God does.
[1:33:57] You know what a believer has tremendous
[1:34:00] power over God. I'll tell you
[1:34:04] how you know we can make God take a
[1:34:07] detour. Detour when I say detour I mean
[1:34:11] permissive will
[1:34:13] okay
[1:34:15] sometimes if we pray too much about you
[1:34:19] know about a thing. Okay God might give
[1:34:23] in as it happened in the case of Ezekiel
[1:34:27] the king. How many of us know about
[1:34:29] Ezekiel the king? Yeah, he God said that
[1:34:33] you know what you're going to die. Yeah.
[1:34:34] Isaiah came and prophesied already that
[1:34:36] you know what you're going to die so put
[1:34:38] your uh things in order. Hezekiah went
[1:34:40] down. He started praying. He prayed. He
[1:34:44] fasted and he prayed and he prayed and
[1:34:48] God said okay fine
[1:34:51] whatever in 3 days you will be back up.
[1:34:54] You're not
[1:34:55] dying. Okay. Now when that happened that
[1:34:59] was per permissive will perfect will was
[1:35:01] that you know in about a couple of days
[1:35:03] Ezekiel fell sick and you know he was
[1:35:05] going to die you know I think we should
[1:35:07] just uh brother you know if you can just
[1:35:09] put it on the screen
[1:35:12] Kings okay 2 kings yo wow I I got it
[1:35:16] right here in front I didn't even have
[1:35:17] to search for it because we don't have
[1:35:18] time god is helping me
[1:35:21] so yeah 2 kings chapter
[1:35:34] Oh, sorry. It's
[1:35:36] 20. Do you have it? Verse
[1:35:40] one. Oh, I will go like now. It came to
[1:35:43] pass in the third year of Hosea, the
[1:35:45] king of No, 2 Kings
[1:35:49] 21. 21. Verse 20. Oh, chapter 20 verse
[1:35:53] one.
[1:35:54] Is anybody getting
[1:35:56] late? Okay, because you know what? I
[1:35:59] leave it here. Then it'll be like, you
[1:36:00] know, I can't start all over again. So,
[1:36:02] it's just another 5 10 minutes. That's
[1:36:04] it. Okay. In those days was Ezekiel
[1:36:06] sick. Yeah. In those days was Ezekiel
[1:36:09] sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah
[1:36:11] son of Amos came to him and said to him,
[1:36:13] "Thus say the Lord, set thine house in
[1:36:15] order, for thou shalt die and not live."
[1:36:18] Then he turned his face to the Lord,
[1:36:20] face to the wall, and prayed to the
[1:36:22] Lord, saying, I beseech thee, oh Lord,
[1:36:25] remember how I have walked before thee
[1:36:27] in truth and with a perfect heart, and
[1:36:29] have done which is good in thy sight.
[1:36:31] And Hezekiah wept sore. And it came to
[1:36:34] pass before Isaiah was gone out of gone
[1:36:36] out into the middle court that the word
[1:36:40] of the Lord came to him, saying, "Turn
[1:36:43] again. Go back. Okay, go back and tell
[1:36:47] Hezekiah the captain of my people, "Thus
[1:36:49] say the Lord, God of David, thy father,
[1:36:51] I have heard thy prayer. I have seen thy
[1:36:54] tears. Behold, I will heal thee. On the
[1:36:57] third day, thou shalt go up into the
[1:36:58] house of the Lord." Okay? And I would
[1:37:02] add unto thee, add unto thy days 15
[1:37:06] years, and I will deliver thee and the
[1:37:07] city out of the hand of the king of
[1:37:09] Assyria. and I will defend this city for
[1:37:12] my own sake and for my servant David's
[1:37:15] sake. So you see God first he said now
[1:37:18] this is the you know this is how you
[1:37:19] know he says that God could have
[1:37:21] actually healed him but you know God
[1:37:22] said no take medicine go to the doctor.
[1:37:24] Okay here he says that Isaiah and Isaiah
[1:37:27] said take a lump of figs and they took
[1:37:29] it and laid it on the boil and he
[1:37:30] recovered. Okay so this is one scripture
[1:37:32] where you know you say that God could
[1:37:34] have really you know healed him
[1:37:35] directly. No but God said no take
[1:37:37] medicine. Okay. And now you will be
[1:37:39] healed.
[1:37:41] So, oh no, I'm not reading any further
[1:37:43] although there is so much to read. Okay.
[1:37:45] So, now this is what happens. Now, uh
[1:37:47] you know, Hezekiah was healed because
[1:37:49] why? He fasted and he
[1:37:51] prayed, right? He is fasting and he's
[1:37:54] praying.
[1:37:56] And brother said uh I don't have the
[1:38:00] quote right now but these 15 years okay
[1:38:04] is when Hezekiah had another son and
[1:38:06] from him then the you know the children
[1:38:10] came down and then he had a king called
[1:38:14] Ahab
[1:38:15] Ahab. Yeah. It was in this 15 years.
[1:38:19] Yeah. And had he died Ahab would not
[1:38:23] have been there. there would have been
[1:38:24] no Jezebel.
[1:38:27] You see that what happens when we pray
[1:38:30] to change God's mind.
[1:38:33] Yeah. Now prayer is a very important
[1:38:36] tool. That's what I said. You can change
[1:38:38] God's mind. But our prayer should be
[1:38:41] that Lord you change my mind to accept
[1:38:44] your decision.
[1:38:46] Yeah. I am rich. I am poor. Whatever it
[1:38:49] is, Lord, I am happy with what you want
[1:38:51] for me. Because sometimes when we get
[1:38:55] very rich, very
[1:38:58] accomplished, there are confusions which
[1:39:00] come in our lives which draw us away
[1:39:02] from God.
[1:39:04] There are marriages which happen because
[1:39:06] of which we go away from the Lord. Okay.
[1:39:10] So for everything you have to pray but
[1:39:12] you have to pray that God grants his
[1:39:15] wish. Let thy will be done. Yes. You
[1:39:18] know, I think God, I need a new car. I
[1:39:21] need a new car. I need a new car.
[1:39:22] Please, please, please. And then what? I
[1:39:25] am fasting and praying for a new car.
[1:39:26] God will give you a new
[1:39:28] car because you know why? You are
[1:39:31] following the
[1:39:34] protocol. Even if God doesn't want to,
[1:39:36] he will still do it for you. But that
[1:39:39] might not be the best for you, right? So
[1:39:42] whenever you are in trouble, whenever
[1:39:44] you need something, put it in front of
[1:39:46] the Lord. Tell him Lord, you know I am
[1:39:49] in this situation right now. Let it be
[1:39:51] unto me as according to thy word.
[1:39:55] Exactly. That is what Mary said. Yeah.
[1:39:58] Not me. I'm not choosing for myself
[1:40:00] because I can't choose for myself. I I I
[1:40:02] I don't have any vision. I cannot see
[1:40:05] one minute ahead of what is going to
[1:40:07] happen. But you being God know from
[1:40:08] eternity eternity what is going to
[1:40:10] happen. Right? So put your will in front
[1:40:12] of God. So when we go to God in prayer,
[1:40:15] okay? But there are some things which
[1:40:16] you have to fermentally pray for. Keep
[1:40:18] praying. Keep praying. What is that for?
[1:40:20] That is for the Holy Ghost because you
[1:40:23] need a refilling of the Holy Ghost every
[1:40:25] time. Yes. Because you know what? When
[1:40:27] we have the Holy Ghost, it dries away.
[1:40:29] We need a refilling. We need a refilling
[1:40:32] again and again. So, you know, seize.
[1:40:36] Oh, no. Pray without seizing. That's
[1:40:38] what the word says. Yeah. Pray without
[1:40:40] seizing. For what? For a motorcycle. Is
[1:40:44] it? Pray without ceasing for what? For a
[1:40:47] new car? No. Pray without ceasing for a
[1:40:50] iPhone? No. Pray without ceasing for
[1:40:53] your body change for, you know, always
[1:40:56] be in season. Yes. Doesn't matter if
[1:40:59] you're, you know, driving a rundown,
[1:41:01] beat up car. Doesn't matter because you
[1:41:03] know what? You're kings and priests. You
[1:41:06] are going to be ruling the, you know,
[1:41:08] planet. Amen. Yeah. Angels are going to
[1:41:11] be subject to you, right? Yeah. So, you
[1:41:15] know, make sure when, you know, this
[1:41:17] thing happened with sister Hattie,
[1:41:18] right? She had her sister who was, you
[1:41:22] know, in a wheelchair for so many years.
[1:41:25] Okay? And when brother Brandham said,
[1:41:26] "Ask what you will." She asked for
[1:41:29] salvation of her two boys. And you know,
[1:41:31] and the spirit said that is a right
[1:41:33] choice.
[1:41:35] Why? Because once Lazarus was raised up
[1:41:37] from dead, but he died again. Where is
[1:41:40] Lazarus? He's not here with us anymore.
[1:41:42] Right. Right? So you know even if uh you
[1:41:45] know a debt is raised up but even bigger
[1:41:49] than that is salvation. So that is what
[1:41:52] we have right now. So make sure that you
[1:41:54] pray pray often pray for anything and
[1:41:58] next thing is that you know what
[1:41:59] everything is open to you. You can
[1:42:01] change your destiny your you know
[1:42:04] everything you can change in this world.
[1:42:06] You have that power. You're not just,
[1:42:08] you know, some, you know, uh, people who
[1:42:10] don't know what to do now. Oh, Lord, now
[1:42:12] this has happened. Now what do I do? Now
[1:42:14] this has happened. What do I do? Where
[1:42:16] do I go? Who do I seek help? Now I'm
[1:42:18] running from here to here. I'm running
[1:42:20] to my, you know, politician. I'm running
[1:42:22] to the police. I'm going here. I'm going
[1:42:24] there. And, you know, I'm just breaking
[1:42:26] my head.
[1:42:27] Whereas you are people with a promise.
[1:42:33] Just embrace the fact. Amen. Okay. I
[1:42:36] will invite uh our brothers here for uh
[1:42:39] the
[1:42:43] musicians and sisters of
[1:42:45] course. So coming back to it, we are
[1:42:48] people with a promise. So don't forget
[1:42:50] where you're coming from. You are coming
[1:42:52] from the lineage of Adam and Adam was
[1:42:56] the son of God.
[1:42:58] You know like I said last time or the
[1:43:00] previous time, you know, when a monkey
[1:43:02] has a baby, it's a monkey. A donkey has
[1:43:05] a baby, it's a donkey. When God has a
[1:43:07] son, it has got to be nothing less than
[1:43:09] what he is. Amen. That is your position.
[1:43:12] Don't look at your physical
[1:43:14] circumstances. We are not a product of
[1:43:17] our natural birth. You know, we skipped
[1:43:19] our theophanes.
[1:43:21] Right? But today we have the message has
[1:43:24] brought us back. You know, we see the
[1:43:25] lighthouse, we remember this is where
[1:43:27] our house is, you see. So this message
[1:43:29] tells us this is where we are coming
[1:43:31] from from the bosom of God from
[1:43:34] eternity. Right. Right. Amen. We are not
[1:43:37] getting eternity right now. We are not
[1:43:38] becoming eternal now. We were always in
[1:43:40] the thought of God. Amen. You know those
[1:43:42] thoughts became words and manifested
[1:43:46] today. Right. Right. Yes. Okay. So, uh I
[1:43:51] am like 10 minutes over. I would want
[1:43:54] any brother you know here if you can
[1:43:57] come forward and say a small prayer
[1:44:00] before we
[1:44:03] close. Who would want to come forward? I
[1:44:05] you know it's open. I'm not taking any
[1:44:08] names. Anybody you know who would want
[1:44:13] to say a small word of
[1:44:17] prayer and we can end with that. God
[1:44:21] bless you all. Praise the Lord. God
[1:44:23] bless you
[1:44:26] brother. Bow our heads.
[1:44:33] Gracious heavenly father,

[1:45:16] these words, Father. See if they're not
[1:45:18] true or not. And may they produce fruit
[1:45:21] in our lives, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:45:23] your goodness and your mercy and your
[1:45:24] kindness to us, Father. Father, we count
[1:45:27] this a blessing. Bless our pastor,

[1:45:38] around us, Father, to believe, Father,
[1:45:40] our testimony.
[1:45:42] Father, by producing your life, help me
[1:45:45] be more sincere, Lord. Help me to apply
