brother brandom takes from the rising of the sun this is Mark 16 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salom had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came to the seler at the rising of the Sun and they said amongst themselves who shall roll away the Stone from this from that of the SRE and when they looked they saw the stone was rolled away for it was very great sorry I've lost my spot need to have my glasses on and entering into sorry this phone's not working for me and entering into the supper they saw saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a white white garment and they were afed he said unto them be not afed ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he's not here and of course you know the rest of this the story they went and told the disciples what was interesting I thought is that it was a group of women there's I I

you may be seated turn with me to Revelations chapter 1 and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for because you are a Believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you that faith is of God is the token himself that moves in you you were always a part of the mechanics we have the evidence now the token the substance amen Revelations chap 1 and verse 16 and he had in let's back up to 15 and his feet were like undefined brass no I'm sorry 16 and he had in his hand right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the son and we could say s o n today as the sun his face was as the sun shining shineth in his strength and when I saw him when I saw him i f fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last amen I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen let me read that again fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death that's a conqueror who' he conquer for you and I that's why when John saw him being the type of the Bride he fell at his feet is dead and said I am nothing that's why John that's why excuse me Isaiah in Hebrews 6 when he come into the temple and saw the the Holy One seated upon the throne and the cherubs he said I am a man of unclean lips I dwell upon a me of unclean lips woe is me right but then he took a Tong of fire a coal of fire from off the altar amen and said fear not Isaac Isaiah I mean fear not maybe that Isaac is here Isaiah fear not amen and touched my lips and purged the sin took it said who will go for me who will bear my life who will take this resurrection and and let it live through them amen Romans chapter 8 I may come back to this to read more from this but Romans 8:11 but if here it is but if the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell Not In and Out In and Out dwell Tak up in the Bood you're his house are you going to give him and let him be master of your house or not right let that decision be made this morning amen are you going to let him be master or not amen I think he's thoroughly proved to you in the word who you are he showed you let's not just be a part partaker and then turn away but let it become a revelation in you ask God for Revelation you have need ask him amen amen you have need of further Revelation ask him to give it to you Lord give me that unveiling of yourself in me amen than let it just not be on my spirit let it go all the way into my soul and become a reality amen yes let it become a positive let it become the person Christ am Amen Let it become that new birth then Lord you're born again you say I but I still need then call upon him let go and Lord I need more of you comeing reveal yourself to me will he yes he will amen why because he said so amen he promised it to you let's read again but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead he was in the Tomb but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead not another Resurrection is not replacement amen the one that laid in the grave will come out of the Grave is that right not another but it won't come up with corruption your body will come you may lay in the grave I may lay in the grave this may be the last sermon I preach but I'm going to give my everything for it amen give my total part to him Hallelujah if I lay in the grave you'll see this man come out of the Grave young right it won't have corruption in it because sin once died that's all that can do it can only it's only a buggy to take this inside of the inside to a waiting body then that waiting body will come when the when the last one comes in it's going to come and pick up this body and becomes a glorified body amen amen is that right amen sin goes down sin cannot rise again I'm talking about Sin your body not sin in you sin in your body amen is that right it can't rise thank you Lord those mistakes and failures won't rise it has one place to go yes that's death but you have conquered death through him death is conquered amen hallelujah all right so if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ also that he that raised up Christ in you from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you what a promise amen what a reality to a Believer amen God said so that settles it you don't have no free thought about this he's in you he'll perform and do what he said he would do rest on it all right now then if it was Jesus if it was now then he said talking about it but let me just start here Jesus was the fullness of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth and was manifest in flesh you were in him then amen because he was the word in the beginning was the word a thought expressed his thought expressed and the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen the word was made flesh watch the statement now the word was made flesh and if you were in him then you are that word amen that was made flesh then I always said if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily where were you then yes sir because you have that same word in you identifying you were also with him in the beginning amen amen all right then he when the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him where when you were in him you walked with him when you were in him yes when he was on Earth you suffered with him praise the Lord amen when you suffered with him in the garden you suffered with him the decision he made in the garden you made it you were in him you were identified you're identified now with his presence his Spirit In You identified you there in that Garden making that decision amen thank you Lord can you understand that amen amen I pray God reveal it to us he you suffered with him and you died with him amen when he went to Calvary he went with you in him am when he was smitten you were smitten in him amen you were in him he died in the flesh when he died in the flesh his body died his Spirit went to hell is that right and testified and preached to those souls in prison but you couldn't keep that life in the grave you couldn't keep it Ted up he had to come back to his position in the body and Rise Again amen all right so you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and how do you know I'm going to come to that in a few minutes how do you know you were buried with him how do you know you died with him how do you know you raised with him and now he said you were buried with him and now and now now the tomb is empty now you are risen with him thank you you raised with him so now you are risen with him amen amen and you're the manifested attributes of God when he expressed those attributes in a word you were expressed amen amen and so you would you were the attribute Ed attributes of God when the word comes in you what is it the word made manifest now the word manifested in you identifies that you are a Believer and everything this word said about a Believer you are amen and everything that said about Jesus Christ you are amen amen amen certainly it is rising certainly is maturing it's maturing and as we feed on the word it it becomes alive to us why because faith comes by hearing the word because Faith lays in the word hallelujah so your manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to a new life amen well I know know about that I think I'll take that back no he don't take it back you're already raised he said you're already raised then tell the Devil he's a liar when he wants to point to that which is not you amen you're a liar Satan you're a father of lies right you're trying to accuse me of something I'm not I am the resurrection and the life I am he that was dead and I'm alive I am he amen amen that is manifested I'm more than a conqueror am Hallelujah already resurrected to a new life and now you're setting in Heavenly places now and now amen you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that is your ordained position that is your posited position that is your positionally you are positionally placed as being risen as having already raised because you've experienced it in a new birth which is a new creation which is his race hallelujah amen oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to see oursel positionally placed Amen Hallelujah in Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord hallelujah and I don't care how much this nose wants to run I'm going to finish this message amen amen that's all right let me say again his grace is sufficient amen amen his grace is sufficient I declare that David is is a weak excuse see that's what happens I declare that David is a weakling I'm not ashamed to declare of an absolute weakling I can do nothing unless he does it I can do nothing unless he shows it I can do nothing in my own self Jesus said that himself I can do nothing but what the father shows me I can do nothing in my own self I can do nothing St John 8 amen amen five no five eight yeah St John 8 I can do nothing in my own self the father worketh my father shows me and I work it's my father that does the work Hallelujah when you realize you're an absolute weakling and no good in your outer man there's not one good thing in this flesh you've got not one good thing quit trying to lift it up and start looking on in the inward where God has placed his spirit and realize that that is your strength hallelujah hallelujah Let It Rise amen thank you Lord let it rise don't keep it under a bushel quit hiding it let it rise amen amen hallelujah all right praise the Lord amen amen when God and His word becomes one Allelujah when God's spirit Waters the seed of God the word of God it produces God exactly not I love a simple message amen you're not born of man nor the will of man or the will of Flesh you are born of God and conjunction and the word is become flesh in you amen is that right right what word the word in the beginning was the word yes all right it produces God and it's not the individual it's God for what you are dead you're not yourself no more what a glorious Awakening I'm not myself no more you can pound all you want Satan you can punch all you want amen but I have a standard amen and it's not this flesh it's not my feelings it's not my reasoning it's not what I think about it my standard is the word living in me The Headstone is in me it was found in me it was found in the bride where was The Headstone found in the bride but it had to be a awakened amen that's why the seals open Amen to show you to reveal to you you always were a part of me you always were in him you always were God found you you didn't find him he found you this morning do you realize he found you this morning it's his achievement has nothing to do with your achievement or your Works amen let off the pressure amen just let off the pressure amen I'm pressed I got to do this you just think you got to do what you think you got to do you don't even know what the next moment holds that's right but he does and he's leading you and he's guiding you if you'll just let go and let him lead for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure hallelujah it's not yourself no more you reckon Yourself Dead daily that's right well I did it once do it again and again and again you're fighting in a battle you are not on a picnic amen Hold Steady and bring every thought under obedience to Christ bring those thoughts under obedience to Christ oh if I just knew it was well listen I'll tell you something when he comes in you have the deser Turner amen that's right you don't have to wonder about it is or isn't it or is or isn't it you'll know it he'll make you to know it he'll show you to know it what's your next step then listen you say the preacher just spoke against me he just speaks against me he just says this against me I don't like the way he says it again he talks too rough well I'll have you know this Leon that has M middle name means lionlike and I may Roar but it's love projected am and when love is projected Grace takes over and when love is projected you say well I can't be loved he just stepped on my toes he just worked against what I had in my mind to do he want he wants to take away from me my own self etc etc ET Etc but when Love Goes Forth is for a purpose when it uncovers that hidden thing you want to keep hidden that no one knows about maybe not even your husband or your wife you want to keep that H hidden you've got a mental attitude that you think you're better than somebody else you want to think that oh well but what is your motive what is your objective in everything you do that's what God's looking at I don't know why I'm preaching this way I never intended to preach this way but I'm going to follow the Lord's leading I'm going to tell you right now yeah I can't be something I'm not I gave myself to God and say God here I am you do what you want to do you take the time you stop me you start me you do what you want to do did I mean it yes if I didn't mean it then I'm using his name in vain cuz I spoke it in his name amen if you don't believe what you ask don't ask ask it if you have fear and to still ask be careful you'll get what you fear because the bottom line of what you're asking is not out of faith in the word it's something else you may have the wrong motive or objective for what you're asking you see God knows remember he knows you inside and out he knows your name he knows your address he knew where you were born he knew before the foundation of the world you be sitting here rubbing your eyes right now he'd be sitting here just doing what you're doing he knew every little move if he could know the the move of a of a of a flea and how many times it bat its eyes and how much Tallow would make I don't understand that but he but he said that other words he knows amen if he knows you like that God open up my soul let me know you let me have the same faith that you had to know me praise be to God hallelujah amen amen so when love goes out there and exposes something in your life remember it's love amen amen now when love exposes it you have a choice you have a choice to release it and let go of it or hold it amen I'll just let you feed on that a while think about that CU that's what's happening you've got a and you've got a pastor you've got a a minister standing before you whose life projects Jesus Christ his life is not going out there like the world he's genuine he's sincere he's a servant of God you ought to respect that gift because respecting that gift is giving God authority over your [Applause] life Hallelujah that's right amen and when you feel like you've been stepped on and if the shoe fits we it if it's if it's just remember God exposed your life exposed sin Expos those things in your life that aren't pleasing to him he's done it because he loves you he's done it because he loves you the word will expose the word will expose things you've got to believe that because that's exactly what the word is it'll even go down and separate you from Spirit and Soul right it'll it'll separate you from who you really are from what you're not thank you Lord you let the word do that you allow the word to do that and he'll put you in a Rapture he'll bring the Rapture to you you'll begin to have the Rapture you become awakened knowing that right there you have the positive you have the ultimate you have the absolute uh uh reality that this body will change because you've already changed inside amen you've already risen amen amen thank you Lord amen so when God comes in it produces God when God Waters that seed in your soul why are you so hungry for God it shows what's in the soul it shows what you're drawing what you're wanting it shows you have a thinking man's taste if there's no desire in your soul where is that thinking man amen you're going to draw for whatever your soul desires is you'll seek something to satisfy what's in your soul go back to thinking man's filter and see if that's not right but if you have that seed in there and you start drawing through the Word of Promise for this day and this hour the word of the word itself you're going to draw life to Quicken that seed to bring to Resurrection Jesus Christ personally it won't be this person had this experience I'm not working on his experience I'm working on what God you gave me by Revelation the experience you've given me Hallelujah then it'll be your individual walk with him yes amen individuals make up his body individual members little Clouds Of Glory he cometh in clouds of glory amen amen that's right Hallelujah all right thank you Lord amen all right you reckon Yourself Dead hollowed out empty vessel empty the vessel Lord here I am fill it amen you know you've got to die to be birthed you've got to die to live amen amen it takes a death first yes all right and then what is it it isn't you no more it's God it isn't the man he wanting to make sure he knows what you're talk he's talking about it's not you the man it's not the man it's God in the man it's the seed germ in the man in the beginning spoken word like in the beginning spoken word who is this bride she is a spoken word seed amuah what is the Original Seed the spoken word right amen what you have and what comes alive in you is a spoken word birth amen amen and God speaks his word and that's what births his children praise be to God and that's exactly what God has done in this hour he spoke the word because he had predestinated seed for this day and this hour he speaks the word for the season and you come alive amen showing that you were identified in him before the foundation of the world amen amen it's God's word made manifest in the man amen it isn't the man it's the man that died he can't be a hbrd and a son at the same time he's either a son of death or a son of life don't be caught in between those two opinions amen a man that's caught between two and opinions is unstable right exactly right you've got either serve the the Elder twin or the younger one who's the younger the Jacob amen you may be a Jacob but Jacob was seed and when that seed come alive you won't serve nothing else he come out a limping man he come out with his name changed when he met God when he met the person then he was no had no more fear because he had risen no more fear because he that was dead is alive he had no more fear of Esau he had no more fear of his Elder twin he had no more fear of what he thought he had no more fear amen of his actions right of his feelings of his senses of his mistakes and failures he had no more fear he knew that he had mastered that twin he knew that what was in him had already overcome he knew that he was more than a conqueror he didn't fear what Esau would do he didn't fear you to quit fearing your mistakes and failures I'm coming to that I'm coming right to it if I can get to it Lord help me amen all right give over to God I mean let him kill the devil that's in you see you're fighting that's what I wanted to get to about Esau he was fighting a defeated enemy that's right you're fighting if you just recognize that everything's been put under your feet amen everything been put under the body of Christ when the head and the body come together they're identified and everything he said every principality and power has been put under his feet and I don't care if you're just the skin under the feet I don't care if you're the cell under the feet every devil is underneath that word amen every one of them I don't say that just to be funny I say that with absolute meaning amen yes when you're in the body you're in the body when you're in the body you're a part of the body you are Christ when you're in Christ you're risen amen hallelujah amen amen all right you can't be in the body and out of the body at the same time once you're placed there you're placed there there's nobody no devil nothing going to come in and take you out of there because the devil can't get in there there's only one way to get in there justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming through the blood into the inner Veil into the very presence and Satan can't go there and when you're hid Psalm 275 he shall hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle and when you're hid you're hid amen God knows how to hide you amen and you were hidden already in this word and God knows how to release you and let you see amen then he knows how to hide you again amen and keep you from him thank you Lord just recognize it's not you it's him in you amen working and he's already ordained the things you'll do and not do yes that's right you're his workmanship you're in Union with him he's already ordained The Works that you would do and what you would do because it's he that worketh in you amen it's not even your Works amen glory it's his works yeah the scripture said so he that believeth in me the works that I do who's the I do is in you the works that I do shall he do also amen The Works that I do shall Quicken his mortal body and he'll do the works am amen did you get that amen amen all right all right praise the Lord praise the Lord God helped me to get through here amen he is he is but it may not be in the way timing you think it ought to be right exactly right you are pretty bold to say that Brother David no I'm saying that in Revelation in love you just let go and let him take care of that clock yes amen amen I don't hear Too Many amens amen amen said but I get tired so I do too great what's got tired what's tired got to do with who you are on the inside great amen who are you feeding the outer man or the inner man amen amen I'm not upset with you I'm just speaking the truth get upset you want to get upset with me be careful who you're getting upset with right right my because this man you can take all the punches you want this isn't me amen amen yes sir all right I'm not angry with anybody well it sounds like it get off of that kick yeah I've got a life that proves he's in me my life testifies of it if it didn't I'm a liar amen amen amen isn't that right you might as well just hit the rubber where yes sir where it hits the road here amen amen I still got some things to carry here amen I haven't got to the punchline yet it's not a joke either I know but there is a a definite thing that God wants to get to you get to you and Satan going to do everything he can in your mind to discourage you from sitting here listening don't tell me he doesn't do it he comes to church right yes you didn't leave him at the door he come right in with this congregation sits right here but he's defeated and we're calling his bluff amen and we're exposing him if he wants to sit here and get exposed he will be exposed and if he's exposed in you let go of [Applause] him amen hallelujah amen as we said who is in you that's greater well you say it's Christ yes it's Christ then it's not you living anymore am amen glory it's he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world greater than your feelings of your flesh greater than any kind of judgment the devil could put on you and and accuse you with and say they did this they did that but our judge said it's not even written amen the judge said it's been smitten off the book there is no record in my sight they are [Applause] perfect in my sight they're me I can look through myself and I see them because they were always a part of me you can't accuse them Without accusing me right Hallelujah so true amen hallelujah we're talking about Resurrection this [Applause] [Music] morning this is what Easter means no it's not bunny rabbits and chicken eggs it's a living Christ Living in you that is not dead He's Alive and he's trying to get to you and across to you that you live also because I live St John 14:19 he said these words to his bride because I live you live also praise the Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah but if you're born again you're alive with Christ amen yes Christ is your temple amen do you realize that's your habitation amen that's where you dwell that's right and everything is perfect in Christ amen amen well I don't feel perfect I don't do things perfect that's not who I'm talking about this morning I'm talking about faith I'm talking about you this real you the spirit of God in you is who you are and that is rising that is rising it it's rising in character it's rising in love it's rising in works it's rising in sign it's rising but in you now it's risen and it's maturing therefore it is rising also in you but Fai said as the prophet said the son is up what is he saying this he's come out of the Tomb amen it's rising but the sun has come out of the Tomb amen amen all right if you're born again and you know that or not it's not I hope I am I hope I am but let that hope become substance let the promise that you are become alive in you a revelation then you aren't saying I hope I am I've done made it yes amen I'm there amen God thank you I'm identified Amen in you Lord in in you see this message isn't something we mentally conceive that'll take you nowhere there is an intellectual Revelation did you know that Prophet said there's two kinds mental faith and God's faith amen amen amen I'll just let you chew on that a while but if you're born again you're alive with Christ Christ and your affections is on things above let's go over here to Colossians and I'll try to get through this hurry L this I'm still okay though I'm still okay in time amen so just cool it let off the pressure relax no reason to get stirred up you're not getting stirred up worry won't produce nothing has no virtue but faith will set you free amen and has thank you Lord all right so so Colossians 3 verse 1 if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above amen where Christ sth on the right hand what is the right hand of God power and authority he's the Living Word power and authority amen he's the son God manifest in flesh power and authority amen he said all power is given unto me over all things over All Flesh what about yours are you not a king then start ruling your flesh you don't recognize you're a king when you recognize you're a king you have authority over flesh over yours not over the ne not over your brothers over yours amen thank you brother that's the truth amen over your flesh bring it under obedience go back to Romans 6 and read it and see if that's not what it said thank you he now made you Kings and Priests to give spiritual sacrifice let go of what you think take the word amen spiritually die to yourself amen sacrifice yourself sacrifice your own ambition sacrifice your own thinking sacrifice it leave it in the Tom when you come out of that tomb you come out of New Creation I said when you came out and when you come out now but I'm moving back to what he did already and when he did it you did it amen hallelujah so you say Well then well then how can I bring it under obedience that right there I just told you you've already conquered death you've already conquered the grave amen you've conquered the tomb it's empty all right thank you Lord if you are born again now I want to read this over here verse okay seek where where Christ sth on the right hand of God verse two set your affection you seek it set your affection on things above not on things on the Earth right if you set your affection over the things that are above and you set your affection on things on the earth and you give that first place and you Bow Down and Worship that you have an idolatrous Spirit working with you amen true yeah amen it's idolatry it's a I'm not saying you're an idolator I'm saying that Spirit wanting to move you in that place he'll say who's going to recognize it you will if you're seeing seed you'll recognize what I just said either that or you go ponder it and God will open it to you amen don't let nothing come between you and your head amen wives or wives don't let nothing become between you and your head amen be careful when you remember what the prophet said as you serve your husband you serve God Amen it's a reflection and the wife as you love your wife and give yourself for her you're serving God that's right hello when you reverence your H wife I mean hus wife reverence and respect your husband you're reverencing respecting God Amen because God is the head of the man yes and the man is the head of the woman and the woman is to reflect his glory that's right amen hello you see it's deeper than dos and don'ts and law we aren't here to come to declare that we're coming here to declare Revelation A Love Affair that's hid in the word you're reading between the lines amen what is your marriage reflecting amen amen maybe it's needs some cleaning up in your house then apply the token amen it's not going to work unless you apply it right well I'll apply it but really it's not my heart to apply it although I've applied it no you haven't when you apply it it's truly on the door and the door is the word when you apply the word you've applied his life over that situation you've made your choice amen well I don't know Brother David we may not want you to ever come back that doesn't mean a thing to me a Ministry a true Minister doesn't doesn't move upon your reactions I'm going to tell you that right now yes sir we aren't responsible for your reaction I'm not looking out here and say well he reacted he must have got it that's no evidence you got [Music] nothing but let that amen come from the soul and it means something thank you Lord brother Barry this is going to good brother I tell you what when you stand up here I just say Lord take your Liberty I meant it you can change my words and I'm going to follow just what you lead me to follow and you know what he's leading and I'm following how about [Music] you all right if you're born again the spirit of God you become a part of of God and are Eternal with him amen now how is eternity going to end it never began how's it going to end amen he gave you the best thing you can fight the devil with his word because his word can't end it can't come to an ending it's Eternal so he gave you that wall of the word to stand behind don't let the devil punch through it with his reasoning in your mind because that that word will not be thwarted there is remember brother Bram said you really got real faith that Faith knows no hindrances amen hallelujah that Faith won't reason it doesn't move on feelings you don't contact god with your senses you contact god with one sense his faith amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord You're Eternal with him then death cannot touch you when you're born again am death can not touch you when you're born again how many will say praise the Lord amen you are Eternal that was God's voice to you you this morning you are Eternal amen and there's only one eternal life then who are you who is you who's the inside I'm not pointing to your outside I tried to make that very clear I'm pointing to that germ seed that seed Gene in your soul that's where you dwell that's who you are that's what God's recognizing he's not recognizing your mistakes and your ups and your Downs in this flesh yes amen Lord not when the blood's applied he won't even see it you are identified in him Eternal amen you have changed from a creature of time just chew on this this is good eating amen you change from a creature of time to a creature of Eternity amen there's been a change there's been a change in me amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah I can't say hallelujah is enough that's more than just a hop so that's Revelation where are those people that have the re Revelation amen sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth not that you aren't conceived but you haven't been birthed yet you haven't been given Life to Live yet yet move yet with it's there and you will come to it but many haven't they didn't go far enough amen but I'm not worried about the bride going far enough because the ministry is telling her she's got to go this other way she's got to go further you think the bride's going to set there I don't know about that when God stands behind it and vindicates it I have to tell you this message is already told this prophet's already told you that then why aren't you not feeding on it amen yeah you mean you would turn down life because you're too busy which is more important to you your business which is temporal and going to pass away and tomorrow you won't have it won't even have the job possibly I'm not telling you will but where's the where's your absolute it's in the Things Not Seen that's Eternal that's the real that's reality this outer feeling you have is not even a reality amen all right you have changed from Death unto life isn't that what St John 5:24 said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth I I mean John St John 11 whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die St John 5:24 said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me and believeth on him that sent me not just well I've heard the word and go out and continue on the way you are remember how he he talked about the prostitute and the drunk had it on arm said did you hear what that preacher said yeah I heard it but that's not what hearing means there it said did you understand amen if you do and there's that ability to hear that word inside you're going to change amen amen the word changes Prayer Changes Things amen amen amen okay you have changed from Death un life I'm talking about eternal life verse three of Colossians 3:3 for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God and when Christ who you're Now watch how the prophet said that for you are dead and your life is you are dead and you are sealed in Christ amen you're hid hid means you're sealed you're sealed in not in the Tomb you're sealed in Christ amen oh my oh my we're coming that just a moment God help us I want to get through it when I say if it's his will he's taking me this way I'll just continue on I the message has been preached regardless whether I preach it through the notes or don't that's right amen God knows exactly I don't know what you're going through but God will take away the doubt out of that believer's life and will pick you up and show you the way to go for he is the way amen amen and when Christ who is our life shall appear then you shall appear with him in Glory thank you Lord the GU glory is come rise shine and the glory is seen upon thee what Glory his own it's the identification that token that you have passed from Death To Life you've already come through the blood so cheer up you've come through the blood there's nothing greater we sing about it this morning amen amen okay predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh in you his church God's word yes makes you makes you he said makes the seed Word Flesh in you his body his bride his church God's word All Right Now Praise the Lord we're moving on now little another step amen okay watch this now the same thing he does oh let's just I'll just just a moment okay that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with fire he can come and dwell in you and we can set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now set setting in Heavenly places okay we follow that I want to get to this how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we're all baptized into Christ which we are now won't be if Christ in Christ we are he's the great spirit spiritual King over the spirit that's in us because we were in him at the beginning yes now Church age book he said he told us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that you would have the teacher come and teach all truth but when the teacher was the teacher but that teacher is an inside teacher not an outside teacher all right if the spirit wasn't inside you right even at this moment you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day amen amen so that has to be there he's the hearer of the word he's the receiver of the word and he guides you teaches you leads you into all Truth All right but but that teacher now that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy ghost heard the word received it and lived it amen it's not you living it it's him living it amen but he lives it through you he quickens your mortal body to the word he acts through flesh he's made flesh in you but who's the one living it well he is I say he is then you are amen amen the inside is living it from the coming from the inside outside amen you've heard that statement before coming from the inside out exactly what it is all right those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin sin is unbelief every age the evidence was the same those that had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that Spirit took the word and taught it or other words revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the message and the messenger excuse me and his message and took it and lived it they were those individuals that make up that body amen all right okay let's move a little further then we'll maybe close on time all right now notice the harmony this is pick up your pen and write notice the harmony of the father and son Jesus never did anything now I've been through this so I'm just going to I'm just going to skip down she shows her he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here's the secret of this yes the word is in the bride just as it was in Mary the shook are you with me but it had to come out of the shook is that right now I'm not saying Mary was an unbeliever but we this outside is like Mary y right this is the negative where's the positive there can't be a negative without a positive hello right you heard your pastor say that last night right you're hearing it said again there can't be a negative without a positive though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil because the positive is there amen though I walk through a shadow of negative and remember it's only a shadow so quit fearing the shadow Hallelujah this is only a shadow someday it won't be a shadow no more it'll be what I am on the inside praise the Lord praise the Lord all right the bride has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name she has thus saith the Lord amen hallelujah I'm not saying that as a cliche this is revelation this is becoming more all the time more Revelation all the time clearer all the time am amen because the bride and the groom are one more all the time thank you Lord all right until this flesh gets so filled up with that word it's got to let go did you hear Prophet say that it's going to get so filled up it can't stand it no more it can't stand the stimulation of Revelation because death is being swallowed up with the victory that is I am on the inside it's Eternal and time are blending which is going to win right amen which is becoming if you blend something you add a little more of of something in it it's blending but it comes more what you're adding until the other that you're adding into becomes no more and it becomes just Blends right in that's right you come out of Eternity you just go right back up you came out of that little hickey eternity continues on you came that little hickey and you go right back up into eternity again eternity never stopped time stops but it's at this age when the ending of time has come to us that this thing is now revealed and open to us now watch what he said here okay see you were made for an eternal purpose I think this is out of uh future home you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you now Ephesians 1:10 said the Ephesians 1:10 was the fullness of time brother Braham said it was the fullness of time has come yes that's when time has been fulfilled when there's no more time then you go into eternity after the seventh Church age is finished is over and it is is then he comes to another place and said no brother sister you misunderstood the ages and over yet yeah then who is he talking about eternity who's eternity you are the real you are I'm Eternal he's Eternal that makes me and him one it's he in you that's Eternal that's not in Leo DEA anymore you raptured out of Leo DEA Revelations 4:1 said you raptured out of leoda because the door was opened the Seal's been opened amen that's right and the opening of the seal you were able to come out of leoda and into the bride time right the bride age which is the message of the seventh seal which was the opening of Seven Seals All the seventh seal did was finish it seal what was spoken in those seals amenallah without the seventh seal you wouldn't know what was said right that's right because the seventh seal is him opening himself up and when he opened himself up you saw yourself written in the book amen amen hallelujah all right now you say Brother David you're making everything so positive w we have anything I'm telling you what you have to have here to get there amen hallelujah amen we ought to have a positive message we ought to be dealing with who you really are I don't have to keep dealing with who you're not I just tell you who you are the other will take follow suit once you get a revelation of that you'll know the other twin that's so close it would deceive you if possible see I had I had a reviv my mother and father had a Revival and they brought twins so did Rebecca and and Isaac both godly people but they weren't dealing with the human part of it they were twin but what did it say The Elder will serve the younger I mean the yeah the younger what were that talking about Jacob I loved and Esau I hated because one had the seed and is the seed and the other despised it wouldn't have nothing to do with the both Birthright and just sold it out for a mess of podage I wonder how many people claiming to believe the message are going to sell it out for a mess of the world for a mess of churchianity for a mess of what people think about you I say help me Lord help us all that's exactly right amen but I got a staying power I have confidence not in this man but in the staying power am see Luther's AG is over he comes the Leo and it is Luther's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over amen don't try to go pick that up it had its day it had its time but life has come out of that shook the same life that went through Luther came into Wesley coming up into Pentecost shuck now it's moved where amen the seed again who is the seed again Jesus Christ what day is this and there's to come on the scene a royal seed yes it would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son that's right all right now okay Hallelujah okay now we're just moving right along praise the Lord we're doing good nothing okay now I read that okay that's good I got that praise the Lord okay praise the Lord I got that one all right it's always nice to see you get through these things you know okay now I just read to you Colossians 3:3 which we already discussed that see the Holy Spirit itself is a seal let me just turn the corner a little bit excuse me I don't mean to Snuff all the time I know those people out here not only you the ones on the live sorry people don't worry about them forgive me ignore it thank you brother thank you doesn't bother you good praise the Lord okay I guess it's only bothered me all right praise the Lord now so I can read this properly Ephesians 4:30 said where grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed to the day of redemption the Holy Spirit itself is the seal now brother brandom says hold that word Redemption sealed to the day of redemption now he says hold that word Redemption see until the day until the day that the book Redemption has been revealed hold that word Redemption you're sealed hold it until the day that the book of redemption is opened or revealed and the Redeemer comes to claim his Poss posession all right how many believe he's come to claim his possession and is claiming his possession and will fulfill that full claiming at the meeting in the air is that right amen but what the book open for to claim his possession claim what he has redeemed amen see nothing can keep you out of that claim right because you have the seal amen amen amen that's right amen now and the Holy Spirit itself is the seal the holy spirit is a seal and a seal signifies what a finished work amen my the seal signifies what a finished work well praise the Lord how many sealed well then it's finished yes sir a finished work thank you Lord Jesus said it is finished right is that right the Redemption is finished now he comes in on the scene in the end time this end day and and takes claim of what he finished amen and brings it to himself as we read last night he comes to claim he comes to take it to himself that where he is you may be also what's it going to take revelation of it will take you to the body change am don't don't let the devil misplace your the coming amen cuz that's exactly what he fights yes he wants you to get confused about it amen amen you just stay in the word you keep eating that open book amen give me the book he heard the voice again and he said give me the book The Voice said take the book and he said give me the book why did he was so adamant he didn't stop and stutter around it he give it to me why cuz I'm possession my possession is in that book my name is in there my right is in there everything I have is in there amen and the lamb opened the book who is he coming to claim those nam in that book and this is the record that he's given to us eternal life and this record is in his son and who he who hath the son hath life all right now so it's a finished work the holy spirit being a seal to the individual and that individual when he receives the Holy Spirit then his time of of groaning is over hello when he receives the Holy Spirit then his time of groaning oh was me I would quit confessing you don't have faith quit confessing the devil what you want you to confess every word has a spirit behind it is that right don't confess that confess what the word said your confession ought to say what he said amen is that right that's a confession that's a true profession amen all right now then your time of groaning is over because it is a finished work Hallelujah and I'll bypass some of this so he said then next what the seal signifies is a finished work now watch what he says about this finished work now this is the words that I got he picks up what the seal signifies from the dictionary he said SE seal is a finished work now watch what he says and when the s th seal is broken the mystery of God that's sealed in these mysterious seals is finished there's a message what are the seven Thunders it's the Revelation contained in the seals what is the Revelation contained in the seals I read it to you out of rising of the sun last night what is it about her the bride amen where she come from who she is how she was in Christ and how she would be manifest In the End Amen that's what he's preaching to you this morning amen amen all right then see when the seventh seal the mystery of God Revelations 10:7 the mystery of God would be finished amen all right because the message of the seventh angel was Revelations 10 which the prophet said is those seals amen is the seventh seal all right and you wonder what's in that box car you wonder what's sealed in there it's supposed to be such and such there're supposed to be he's presuming but when the that when the seal that seventh seal broken and the door is opened where do we find that Revelations 4 let's go over there just a moment Revelations CH 4 and after this verse one I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven amen what brother brandom identifi that to be Rapture is that right Rapture now and Rapture of our body but it had to be a Rapture now in you first Because unless that Rapture becomes a substance in you you'll never see it in the body amen and it'll take the Holy Ghost as we just read to reveal it to you yeah right all right so he said when the seal is broken the door is open we see into it then we see into it then watch what it said and the the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which was reev gelations 1:10 was as of a trumpet talking with me remember he turned to see the voice and when he turned to see The Voice he said seven saw seven candlesticks and one standing in the midst we went over that last night all right then he said when the seal is broken the door is open we see into it then and see exactly what's in there but you can't you see it how can you see what's in there until the doors open and what did he say here and of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither sounds like Song of Solomon Chapter 2 ver8 come away come up higher come out you come out of come out of your tomb of leoda amen amen and come up higher Hallelujah and I will show thee what was this what was the token to do what was the Holy Spirit to do an inside teacher and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter after the birth after that what is it coming to a full manifestation a rising of the sun it's the bride time the seals open for that purpose those seals the Revelation contained those seals were for no nobody else but the bride amen amen okay than you now another thing a seal signifies is ownership and the seal has a mark on it shows ownership and when you are bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to it and another thing is the seal is is a security the seal is security sealed means you are secured amen I don't care you say oh my mistakes oh that's not your security quit looking at that amen you're always confessing that when you should be confessing what he said about it and about you amen go to the blood say Lord I'm sorry I made that mistake you know what he's faithful and just to forgive amen just take a sincere heart and say Lord I apply the blood over that by your spirit having it in me I have the right I have the the right to apply the blood he wants you to that's right he's expecting you to Hallelujah Hallelujah all right now seal means you're secured and you that don't believe in eternal security but a seal signifies security to its destination wo to that guy that would try to break that seal and let me tell you something what God joins together let no man including you including me let no man bring it us under or try to get it us under cuz it can't be done when you're sealed in you're secure so quit worrying about be a little bit uh more proactive quit worrying about your ups and and your mistakes because you never had the desire in your soul in the first place to even do it and if you have the desire let's start getting rid of it right now take it out of me Lord am yes sir because when the Holy Ghost comes in there's no desire even to do a mistake but you're going to have mistakes you're going to have failures it's a part of the life of this but but it's not the part of the life of [Music] this my I don't know how much clearer you can get it amen amen all right and I'm not trying to say I can explain because you can't amen amen you know what and another thing that Pastor minister or minister is not responsible for whether you get it or not true it's exactly right because it's God that gives it to you all I'm responsible the forest scattering the light amen upon the seed amen amen that's all we're responsible for let God take care of it and he will amen because it that seed cannot that word cannot return to a void it will accomplish it there's somebody that is going to strike whether now or later on or tomorrow driving down the road that's it that's it I see it and watch how the Holy Ghost come back and vindicates it to you takes you right back okay didn't the prophet say this didn't my words say this right and over here why it says it here why it says it back over here amen amen amen all right oh I just love the word don't you I just I can't it's just woe unto the guy would try to break that seal woe unto the man that tries to break this Union between the bride and the groom amen cuz God joined them together there's no man can break it Hallelujah so quit worrying about your mistakes breaking it because there's no man can break it praise God Amen all right then watch he said now that Spirit seal cannot be broken you have heard me say that people said the devil made me do this no no the devil didn't do it you just you just wasn't sealed in so then you see see cuz when you're sealed in he's sealed out get the mess I want to get the message to you that you are a part of this Resurrection amen amen now I'm going to begin to wind down that you are a part of this resurrection and don't worry about it no more where is he preaching this message token which had to follow he said to vindicate the message that you are sealed in had to follow the seals because it was the Capstone of of all of it he said was that token message amen that's right amen you're not going in a Rapture without the token that's right the token is the Holy Ghost when you're born again you're sealed in amen amen man and you grow up into the very stature of himself because it's him growing up amen you understand it's him growing up in you amen that's why it's just becoming so clear and clear and clear and how much clearer can it get yeah still clear amen okay just start rejoicing over it quit worrying about it anymore there's nothing nowhere can separate you from it Hallelujah I'm not talking about when you're born again you know it because it's a knowing it's a revelation amen I'll build my church upon this Revelation amen and when he builds it upon the revelation of who he is when that church is finished it's who he is amen all right all right now see nowhere can separate you from it nothing eternally secured in the kingdom of God when God has stamped his seal upon you you're to the end of the destination amen hallelu that's a revelation Jeremiah 29:11 said I know my thoughts concerning you not thoughts of evil but thoughts of good to give you an expected end amen amen amen amen now praise the Lorden amen Hallelujah all right just a little bit more and I'm done are you okay all right now let's just get this finished here this one that stands in the in the midst of the church revealing who he is in this last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of him amen he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own Bride As the spirit of God he came down created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body what about these spiritual cells he's created in you for this change because when you get the change inside of you you've come to the end of your destination you've already got this change as substance so that makes this body potentially to be changed it's already got the potential do you understand all right now let's see okay now I'm not going to go any further with that so we'll just come to this the new creation it's not the old creation made over or it canot be called a new creation that is exactly what it says New Creation it's another creation distinct from the old one different from the old one now I'm just coming back and I'm going to bring out what I've been saying what he's what he's been saying through me bringing it right back into this what this Prophet said here listen he said no long longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue Through The Godly line Isaac line but now out out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was he was God created in the form of a man now by his Spirit he's creating many sons unto himself see the beginning means there's others to come just like him God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation amen this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose the purpose took through took form through election all right and and he does that by the decree he elected them he elected the members of his new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children maturity adoption of children because you've already got the the spirit of adoption so you're heading right to the end of your destiny you're going to come exactly in character and everything exactly in that person himself and that's what's happening you talk to any bride member that's getting Revelation that's exactly what's happening I just see myself in him so one it just keeps opening opening the Oneness the Oneness the Oneness till there's no difference the only difference is this but Eve had a little different thing too than Adam but she was of the Adam's Body she was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she' just come in a little different shape because God was in morphed amen are you with me in another mask but it wasn't a different person because Eve had Adam's spirit amen and had Adam's Body right [Music] amen what's he coming back to a full restoration of that family right that's why God allowed it he allowed Adam to step aside he allowed Adam to take and listen to his wife and die die for her is that right that's exactly was what God was doing showing Redemption right there because he took you and me to Calvary died to death and right there he died for you and released you out of that tomb of yourself all right now now see now you are all see aren't you glad he said aren't you glad you belong to him amen now see now you are already resurrected when God raised him up he raised you comeing now don't don't go to sleep on me I know you're getting a little weary but listen I got to get to those punch lines amen okay listen world this is still just a barely barely afternoon it's not nighttime amen all right the day has come the light is here amen the sun is risen and you raised with him you are already resurrected when God raised him up he raised you the sun is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come in obedience to it didn't it Romans 8:11 amen amen your body coming why by what same spirit amen hallelujah I just said eve didn't have a different Spirit she had Adam's Spirit right amen Adam was both M masculine and feminist all Ed what eve took the feminist part out of Adam which was not another Spirit it was Adam's Spirit hallelujah amen now you're resurrected completely your body come in obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what a church the word which is life there then he said then you are now resurrected from the dead you are now Resurrected from the dead let me say it again you are now resurrected from the dead hallelujah amen oh my are you satisfied that you're a part of that Easter Resurrection Hallelujah that you raised with him notice that quickening power the mind that was in Christ was in you then I'm trying to show you that when you raised when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also why you've got the seal to prove it thank you Lord amen and also Quicken to life with him you are now quickened to life with him although you were you were but an attribute in his thoughts but God saw all in him at the Finish amen and what he knew of you and saw you he knows you gave you an expected in he will not change his mind about you he doesn't have another thought about you God's going to bring you right to fulfillment he's going to bring you the word to be fulfilled and he's going to work it through you to do it amen and it's God's doing I can't drive that hard enough home it's God's doing it's God's working he's the one that positionally placed you you didn't Place yourself anywhere he's placed you amen and I'm trying to show you trying to show you where you're placed amen hallelujah he saw all in him when God looked down it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride amen the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of you bride amen Lord your body ain't subject to sin no more amen your desires have changed Amen on Easter morning not only did he rise but his beneficiaries raised with him it took death and when there was death then the will was released leased of the testator to be manifested in flesh of a bride Hallelujah and then he raised up to seal that will amen it's already been done it's finished amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord Glory he didn't stay in the grave corruption couldn't come in him neither can it touch you amen the real you it can't corruption can't touch you you're free from Death you're born again you're birth you're resurrected born again the baptism of the Holy Ghost means to be born from above Hallelujah I'm sure this morning even we who believe it he said back then we can't comprehend what a great thing that was but we are comprehending it amen by his spirit that said he would lead you into all truth we are comprehending it by his power of his word and promise amen amen hallelujah because he raised from the dead you we also have raised from the dead for we were in him hallelujah amen amen amen amen and when he said come up higher you walked into that Rapture amen he he did something right then Colossians even spoke of it who hath believed who hath did who excuse me who he who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness Colossians 1:13 and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son Hebrews 11:5 said Enoch walked with the raptured faith amen and was not and our type is Enoch Glory the seventh from Adam hallah but then he might have been the seventh but what he walked into was the first day that's right it was a resurrection amen and he had to have the resurrection to Rapture so he had the resurrection in him that was his testimony what is your testimony this morning I am risen hallelujah amen glory oh my by faith Enoch was translated same word changed translated raptured by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death didn't we just get in reading that the you that has come alive in Christ will never see death he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die am oh you say what about this body I'm talking about the real you right this body because of that you inside is been quickened this body will rise again am and if you're alive and remain it's going to be caught up with those caught up means Rapture it's going to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye in that moment in that moment of that trumpet amen hallelujah the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise am first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air My my what an expected end like how do you know it's expected he said so to me what about to you this morning he said so he meant what he said I believe what he said I'm expecting what he said I don't care how it has to come and how many how many ditches and mountains and paths I must go through I've already got the substance to buy that promise it's already bought I got to go take possession of it amen hallelujah oh my because he raised we have also raised we for we were in him can you catch that word when he laid there you laid there when he rose you Rose in him see it's already finished the seal signifies it amen amen all right oh my quickening power lets us see his coming amen quickening power snatches us from death to life that same prophecy and word of God that said he had raised again says you are already rose with him fear not no wonder he said fear not amen as it is written the spirit that is now was that is now was in him now in us also quickens our mortal body fear not friend the s o n is up it's risen amen and he said it's risen the son and when he raised you raised the son raised am he that hath the son hath Resurrection Life So What does that

to the heart when the when the when the when the word of the Lord when it turned when the heart excuse me when the heart turned to the Lord the veil was taken away 2 Corinthians 3:16 and the Lord that

when he is glorified in US yes he asked the same question in this message rising of the sun when he said how does your mortal body become his body Romans 8:11 if the spirit that was in him is in you he raised up that anointed word in you will also Quicken your mortal body not only bring bring it to the subject to the word now but that spirit will raise you up again am out of that tomb if you have
