[0:05] in. Bring them in from the fields

[0:27] [Music]
[0:32] You know, I
[0:34] uh my I just want to read a scripture
[0:37] here out of Mark chapter
[0:40] 10. And they brought young children to
[0:42] him that he should touch
[0:45] them. And his disciples rebuked those
[0:48] that brought them. And we know that
[0:51] that's the traditional teaching. Don't
[0:53] don't mess with things. Don't get out of
[0:55] order here. But when Jesus saw it, he
[0:59] was much displeased, and he said unto
[1:01] them, "Suffer the little children to
[1:02] come unto me, and forbid them not, for
[1:06] such is the kingdom of God. Verily, I
[1:08] say unto you, whosoever shall not
[1:10] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[1:13] child, he shall not enter
[1:15] therein." And he took them up in his
[1:18] arms, and put his hands upon them, and
[1:21] blessed them. And that's what we are
[1:24] going to do today.
[1:27] Certainly wonderful to have this
[1:32] honor. Hey,
[1:34] buddy. Brother
[1:36] Jerry, can you see
[1:39] him? God bless you,
[1:42] buddy. Yeah, it's okay if you're yawning
[1:44] in
[1:46] church. You're allowed
[1:48] to. Let's just bow in
[1:51] prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord
[1:54] Jesus, one more time.
[1:56] What an honor and a privilege it is to
[1:58] hold one of your elect.
[2:01] Father, this morning, Lord Jesus, we
[2:04] want to thank you for this life of
[2:06] brother Jeriel, Lord Odono. Father, we
[2:10] thank you for the Odinoo family, Lord
[2:12] Jesus, brother Farah, Sister Merritt,
[2:15] Sister Zoe, and Brother Jason, Lord. And
[2:18] this morning, Father, we just want to
[2:19] take this life that you have given unto
[2:22] this family, Lord, and dedicate it back
[2:25] unto you, Father. Lord Jesus, we know
[2:28] that all life comes from you. And what
[2:30] greater honor and privilege is it as
[2:33] parents, Lord Jesus, to acknowledge you
[2:35] as the giver of all life. And Father, to
[2:38] be able to take that life that you have
[2:40] given us and dedicate it back unto you.
[2:43] So father this morning even as a body of
[2:46] believers here in Calgary we unite
[2:48] together around this family Lord around
[2:51] the Odonovos and we just ask Lord Jesus
[2:53] in the name of Jesus that you would
[2:56] watch over this boy for the duration of
[2:58] his life. Father as we've read about and
[3:00] heard about so many times Lord there's
[3:02] so many different things that we could
[3:04] ask for but Father this morning we unite
[3:06] together and we ask for the salvation of
[3:09] this boy. We just pray that Lord Jesus,
[3:12] you would guide his footsteps all the
[3:14] days of his life. That you would lead
[3:16] him and guide him into all
[3:18] righteousness, Lord. That his desire
[3:20] would be unto you first and foremost,
[3:22] Lord. And oh, Father, that all of the
[3:25] other gifts would follow, Lord Jesus.
[3:27] Father, we pray that you would allow him
[3:29] to be an inspiration of joy to his
[3:31] family, Lord Jesus. That he would be an
[3:33] inspiration of the foundation of your
[3:36] love and your gospel to all the people
[3:38] around him, Lord. because he knows what
[3:40] you've done for him. Father, we pray
[3:42] that you would just keep sickness away,
[3:45] Lord. And Father, let him just
[3:47] experience the joy of your salvation.
[3:51] Father, we love you and we thank you and
[3:52] we just want to commit this boy into
[3:54] your hands now for your glory. As we
[3:56] dedicate him in the name of Jesus
[3:58] Christ, we'd ask Lord also that you
[4:01] would watch over the family in every
[4:03] aspect. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[4:06] Amen. Amen.
[4:08] Amen. God bless you, buddy. You feel
[4:11] that presence, don't you? It's not
[4:13] brother Barry. Oh
[4:15] my.
[4:17] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother.
[4:21] Congratulations. Bless you,
[4:23] sister. Bless you, sister. Oh, bring
[4:27] them
[4:28] in. Bring them
[4:32] in.
