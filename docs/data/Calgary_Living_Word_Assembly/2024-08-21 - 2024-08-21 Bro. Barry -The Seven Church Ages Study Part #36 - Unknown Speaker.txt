life from coming to pass and we thank you for that Lord and we know the trials of this life are fit for us Lord Jesus so that your character will actually come through in our lives and father tonight we just ask that you would meet each and every need made known unto you by the way of an uplift hand in the Defiance of the law of gravity that you set in motion father in this universe father we pray that you would sovereignly meet the needs in the hearts and lives of your children tonight Lord father we pray that you would meet the two unspoken requests Lord Jesus you know them you understand

away and the Lord's brought them back safely God bless you we know the claen are back we certainly thank the Lord for traveling mercies and just a wonderful time away where we can refresh and fellowship and here we have the Snows thank you for coming God bless you it's good to see you I believe they just landed in Calgary and their desires to be in Fellowship so hallelujah it's wonderful to get together with the body I was having a conversation this week about you know the body of Believers here and how is that sister Pamela back there God bless you Sister It's good to see you too how how this isn't just a church we don't just go to different denominational fellowships this is a body this is a family a and we know one another we fellowship with one another we care for one another we pray for one another we we understand what's going on in one another's lives right it's not just distant people that just come to church once in a while when when we feel the need because God's given us a a problem in our life and we need a blessing from God this is more than that and it's tremendous and you know we're not here we miss one another I I saw a man in a in a video clip I hope it's okay if I just talk a little bit tonight but I saw a man in a video clip and he said you know one of the reasons we go to church is not even for us it's for everyone else to encourage everyone else around us many times we don't even maybe feel the blessing in our lives but our presence when we come together in the house of the Lord it actually brings encouragement to other people who are watching we know the prophet said there's always people watching so when we are not here we're missed so welcome everyone it's certainly a pleasure to see your smiling faces God richly bless you if you have your Bibles tonight I want to continue on in the exposition of the seven Church ages in the pergan church age in Revelations CH 2:12 Revelations 2 verse 12 boy after the weekend I got to say I just want to preach tonight but uh we're just going to try and keep it tame Revelations chapter 2 verse 12 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where s where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word once again Lord we could read this scripture over and over and over and every single time it will have something new for us because this word is not just print this word is life this is the word that you have given to the churches and we thank you for it Lord we pray that Lord Jesus you would open our ears to this word tonight that you would Quicken it to our very Souls we just commit the rest of this service and all that said father into your name we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated once again we uh just have a couple of announcements we have uh this weekend we're going away we're going to go to the Moose Lake Family Camp and uh brother Jose cmf who was uh originally going to take the service earlier in September but has agreed to take the service on the 25th so this Sunday brother sh way will be here we will be away and uh certainly looking forward to hearing brother toes oonoo he is going to take the service on the 8th of September and we're already heading into September summer is basically over I don't know how many people have gone back to school yet but uh it's happening we're going to go back to school very soon our our children start on the third of September and uh it's shocking that it's that close but I guess time just speeds up the further we go the faster it gets and uh I've heard it said from some of the oldtimers it doesn't slow down it just goes faster and faster spring summer fall winter and uh so anyways we're certainly excited to to be in fellowship with brother too denovo and uh we know that they had a wonderful time of traveling recently and brother to took a few Services I understand and we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has put on his heart and uh for anyone that doesn't know it um I believe he and his bride Sister Janet I think are leaving on the 11th is that right on Wednesday the 11th so we certainly want to extend the right hand of Fellowship while we have some time left and uh just certainly trust the Lord will continue to allow them to feel welcome yes that's all uh we have a potluck I guess after service on the 8th so that will be a a wonderful time of Fellowship we we sure had a good time this weekend my goodness and uh you know what's interesting is I I thought my I really maybe made a mistake booking the the services on this weekend but at the same time I thought you know we booked it a year in advance so for the uh opportunity to be here was certainly there and we all have lives to live I understand that but I was I was feeling down that maybe the church would be empty and we'd have brother Andrew come all this way and what would we do but you know I don't know if we could have contained everyone if everyone who was away would have been here I don't know if we would have fit in this building it was pretty much full so it's just the way God does things and uh we sure had a wonderful time my and uh if you stream the services I'm I'm sure you you caught sort of what we were doing and and what was happening it was just an amazing time so you know I was talking to brother Andrew and we're looking to shift it uh a little further forwards so we'll see what the Lord has in store and if we can we're potentially going to move into September next year so that way everyone can be here and uh I mean there's always going to be someone away you can't prevent that but we certainly would like to try and make it as available as possible for everyone we know that we typically travel in the summertime and there's always stuff going on so whatever we can do to try and be a blessing to the body we certainly want to do that and I can tell tell you that brother Andrew certainly was blessed he was absolutely exhausted when he left and uh you know he he certainly gave his all and uh we certainly appreciate the the gift that that the Lord has placed in our brother's life and uh it's just wonderful to think back I was considering you know how did I ever come across brother Andrew I'd heard about him before but I went to that ministers enrichment weekend in North Carolina and I was just down in the in in the morning in the hotel having breakfast I was just getting a cup of coffee and just having breakfast and there was one brother there that was glued to me and he was preaching tape Ministry and he was just giving it to me and I I you know I said yeah you know rapturing faith lies on the tapes but it's got to move from those tapes to our hearts you know and it was about then that brother Andrew he just pulled up and sat down and I'd never met him before but we just started to talk like we'd known each other forever and it was just wonderful to meet him that way and I found out that he was a full-time evangelist and I said my goodness we need to talk and so that's where it started so um he is very interested in uh doing annual meetings so that's our plan moving forward we're going to continue to do annual meetings and we'll try and get a solid time that works for everyone so uh yeah and he's completely on board with that so it's wonderful that we can actually try and do that all right enough talking are you happy tonight it's certainly good to see everyone here carrying on out of the uh pergam and church age you know uh I believe we left off at paragraph 131 last time it now behooves us to discover the original mother and child the original goddess mother of Babylon was SE saramis who was called Ria in the Eastern countries in her arms she held a son who though a babe was described as a tall strong handsome especially captivating to women in Ezekiel 8:14 he was called tamuz among several classical writers he was called bakas to the Babylonians he was nus what accounts for the fact that he is represented as a babe in arms and yet described as a Great and Mighty Man is that he is known as the husband's son one of his titles was husband of the mother and in India where the two are known is eswara and isi he the husband is represented as the babe at the breast of his own wife that this nenus is the Nimrod of the Bible we can affirm by comparing history with the Genesis account pompus said nus king of Assyria changed the ancient moderate ways of life by the desire for Conquest he was the first who carried war against his neighbors he conquered all nations from Assyria to lib Libya as these men knew not the Arts of War I think we talked about it last time how tragic it would have been to be living in peace and then have your neighbors March over and just start slaughtering your people it would have been uh just shocking Doras said nenus was the most ancient of Assyrian Kings mentioned in history being of warlike disposition he trained many young men rigorously in the Arts of War he brought bab Babylonia under him while yet there was no city of Babylon thus we see this nenus started to become great in Babylon built Babel and took over Assyria becoming its king and then proceeded to devour other vast territories where the people were unskilled in war and lived in a moderate way as said in pompus now in Genesis 10 speaking of the kingdom of nim Rod it says and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Eric and akad and kalna in the land of shinar out of that land went forth Asher and builded Nineveh and the City of rabo and kala we know that's Genesis 1010 and 11 but the translators made a mistake in translating Asher as a noun for it is a verb and in the Chalan means to make strong strong thus it is Nimrod who having been made strong he established his kingdom by building the world's first Army which he trained by Drilling and through the rigors of hunting went beyond shinar with his strong Army and subdued Nations and built cities such as Nineveh which was named after him for even today a chief part of the ruins of that city is called Nim round since we have discovered who ninis was it is now necessary to discover who his father was according to history it was Bell the founder of Babylon now it is to be noted here that Bell founded in the sense that he started this whole move but it was the son nus that established it and was the first king but according to the scripture the father of nimrod was kush and Kush begat Nimrod not only is this so but we find that ham begat Kush and now in the Egyptian culture Bell was called Hermes and Hermes means the son of ham according to history Hermes was the great prophet of idolatry he was The Interpreter of the Gods another name by which he was called was Mercury read acts 14 11 to2 henus says this about The God Who was known variously as Bell Hermes Mercury etc for many ages men lived under the government of Jo not the Roman Jo but the Jehovah of the Hebrews who predates Roman history without cities and without laws and all speaking one language but after that mercury Bell Kush interpreted the speeches of men whence an interpreter is called her miniutes the same individual distributed the Nations then Discord began it is seen from this that Bellar Kush the father of nimrod originally was the ring leader that led the people away from the true God and encourage the people as The Interpreter of the Gods to take another form of religion my he encouraged them to go ahead with the tower which his son actually built this encouragement is what brought the confusion and division of men so that he was both interpreter and confuser Kush then was the father of the polytheistic system and when men were deified by men he of course became the father of gods now Kush was called Bell and Bell in Roman mythology was Janice he is pictured having two faces and he carried a club by which he confounded and Scattered the people ID writes that Janice said concerning himself the Ancients called me chaos thus we find that the Kush of the Bible the original rebel against monotheism was called Bell Bellis Hermes Janice Etc amongst the ancient peoples he purported to bring Revelations and interpretations from the gods to the people now in so doing he caused the wrath of God to scatter the people bringing Division and confusion this one just caused me to just pause there on that on that that one sentence there in doing so he caus the wrath of God to scatter the people we know the story bringing Division and confusion now up to this point we have seen whence polytheism or the worship of many gods came but did you notice that we also found a mention of a man named Kush who is given title of the father of gods did you notice here the old theme of ancient mythologies that Gods identify themselves with men that is where ancestor worship comes from so we might just examine history to find out about ancestor worship well it was brought out that kush introduced a three God worship of father son and spirit three Gods who were all equal but he knew about the seed of the woman coming so there would have to be a woman and her seed come into the picture this was brought to pass when Nimrod died his wife Samus defied him and thus made herself the mother of the son and also the mother of the Gods just exactly as the Roman Church has deified Mary they claim that she was without sin and was the mother of God she SE samiramis called Nimrod zeros which means the woman's promised seed but it wasn't too long until the woman began to attract more attention than the son and soon she was the one who was depicted as trampling underfoot the serpent they called her the queen of the heaven and made her Divine how like today when Mary the mother of Jesus had been elevated to immortality and right now as of September 1964 the Vatican council is attempting to give a quality to Mary she does not possess for they would like to call her Mary the mediatrix Mary the mother of all believers or Mary or mother of the church sorry if there was ever babylonish ancestor worship in a religion it is the religion of the Church of Rome my I think a lot can be said there about Mary but I like what the prophet said he made made it real clear he made it real simple he said she just like everyone else had to be one of those 120 in the upper room she had to have a holy ghost experience for herself she did not just become someone that she wasn't she was human being just like us paragraph 142 Not only was ancestor worship originated in Babylon but it but so also was the worship of nature it was in Babylon the gods were identified with the Sun Moon Etc the chief object in nature was the sun which had light-giving and Heat giving properties and appears to man as a ball of fire in the heavens thus the chief God would be the sun god whom they called bael often the sun was depicted as a circle of flame and soon around that flame there appeared a serpent it wasn't long until the serpent became a symbol of the Sun and consequently worshiped thus the desire of Satan's heart became full-fledged he was worshiped as God his throne was established his slaves bowed to him there in pergamus in the form of a living serpent he was worshiped the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now symbolized in the form of a living serpent had not only seduced Eve but the majority of mankind but how did pergamus become the seat of Satan if Babylon was the seat the answer again is in history when Babylon fell to the mes and Persians the priest king adelus fled the city and went to pergamus with his priests and sacred Mysteries there he set up his kingdom outside the Roman Empire and thrived under the care of the devil this has been a very short resume of the history of the Babylon religion and its Adventure Advent to pergamus many questions are no doubt left unanswered and much more no doubt could have been said to Enlighten us but this is not intended to be a study of history rather it's intended to be a help to the study of the word once again hey the prophet pointing right back to the word the denunciation Revelations 2: 14 to 15 but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balam who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so Hast th Al so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nians which thing I hate now I just want to pause there for a second if we were to go and look it up I don't want to tonight I would just recommend it if you want to go and look up this story about balum and baac we know it very well how there was the the the donkey that actually spoke to him the the Mad prophet he got out of the will of God he was coerced into Fame he was coerced into a little bit of Fortune and we know that God dealt with him through the the donkey and the donkey spoke so it just goes to show that God can use whoever he wants to to actually speak to man but what I want to get to with this is there's a whole story about how balum taught baac taught balum kept showing him over and over and over again the hinder parts of the children of Israel if if if they couldn't get if he couldn't get the children of Israel to fall and actually get out of the land what he wanted to do was get them to actually start looking at one another and isn't that the same spirit that can get into the church today do you do you know brother so and so do you do you know sister so and so have you heard what they've done have you seen where they've been do you know who their family is do you know do you know do you know just get get get the people to look at the hinder parts and cast what's what you're doing is casting stumbling blocks in front of those people and not recognizing that you're actually under the influence inuence of an evil spirit because God's spirit does not do that that's exactly the same Spirit of BAC and balum but what I want to get to here is brother Bram he takes and uses this this part of Revelations 2: 14 and 15 he refers to that story here but he goes and he explains all about the Catholic church it's got nothing to do with balum and baac and I love how he brings that out because an ordinary human looking at this would just want to go back to the story of balam and baac and see what they said what happened there that's the natural thing but here we have a prophet in our day taking and bringing light to this this scripture in Revelations 2: 14 and 15 so as we go forward I just wanted to sort of bring that to the surface so that we will think about maybe the the the original story as we go through this and and you don't see him mention the original story in here at all in paragraph 146 he says in this pergan age the Lord denounces two doctrines which he hates the doctrine of balum which brought idolatry and sinful excess to Israel at B peor where they said you know what just come and fellowship with us everything is fine we're one when God said no separate yourself from the people of the land no no no separate yourself from the sins of the people and get right with the word that I gave to you through the prophet the doctrine of balum and number two the doctrine of the nians brother Bram really hammers it in here he gets right down to it the the right to the bone on this one and it's so good but that's simple simply the Conquering of the leoty the the the lordship of man over man and how man can actually set up Bishops and and have elders and and and have many churches and have everybody participating under the headship of one man and that's not the way it's supposed to be according to the prophet which is according to the word which is the thus sayith the Lord for our day the the doctrine of the nians lordship over man those things are the things that God hates he's not just displeased with them he hates them I think that's powerful the doctrine of the nicians which had been but deeds in the Ephesian age combine this denouncement with the fact that he has been emphasizing per as the seed of Satan and it is very easy and proper to conclude that somehow the religion of Babylon has become intermingled with Christianity amen why now this will not merely this is not merely an assumption but a historical fact which we will prove by going back into history to about 36 ad and coming up to the Nan Council of 325 when the Christians mainly Jews by birth were scattered abroad from Jerusalem and went everywhere preaching the gospel particularly in the synagogues th within 3 years or about in 36 ad the gospel had been taken to Rome by junas and Andrus who according to Romans 16:7 were Apostles the the work flourished there for several years until the constant altercations of the Jews amongst themselves caused Emperor Claudius to expel them from Rome with the Jews banished from that City the backbone of that little church was practically broken but it wasn't it was practically perhaps even the elders had been Jewish and so would be gone the flock would be unattended and since the word had not been written as a guide it would be very easy for this little flock to drift or be inundated by the philosophers and pagans of that day with Grievous wolves on the prow and the spirit of antichrist released we find from history that this little church in Rome became hopelessly backslidden and began to introduce Pagan ceremonies under Christian titles sometimes you can have Ministry that will try and mingle with the word and what happens is you wind up with that exact same thing Pagan s ceremonies under Christian titles and what happens is it will break the backbone of the church it will destroy the power of God inside a church and remember Satan he's not afraid to come to a message Church he's not afraid to try and speak little things to brother Barry you should look at this book you should quote that author you should bring this you should do that no way back to the word back to the word of a Vindicated Prophet that's the only word as the period of banishment lasted for 13 years the founders Junius and Andrus I hope I'm saying that right did not come back until 54 ad imagine their horror to find a church with a Christian title that was woefully Pagan there were altars in the church upon which they placed incense and celebrated Pagan rights the established leaders of that church could not be approached so with the few who had tried to remain faithful they started a new church or the second Church of Rome God graciously worked amongst them by signs and wonders so that a third church was started isn't it interesting the first church the second church and the third church and though the first church was reproached for being Pagan and not Christian in its worship it would not give up its title but remained and Still Remains the first Church of Rome the Roman Catholic church now the majority of us have the mistaken idea that any and all who call themselves Christians would be the target of the devil and consequently the brunt of governmental tyranny but not so this first church had begun to thrive and multiply so in numbers that the Emperors and various officials of the government actually favored that church for political reasons thus when the leaders of the first church in Rome found themselves in favor they took the opportunity to turn the government against the True Believers can you believe that Christians and demand their persecution unless they came into their fold unless You' seen it my way you're lost as lost can be my you ever heard that Spirit one such Bishop of the First Church of Rome was anitus I hope I said that right too who lived in the second century and was contemporary with polycarp when the venerable polycarp heard that the First Christian Church of Rome was involved in Pagan ceremonies and had corrupted the truth of the Gospel he went there to implore them to change he saw them prostrate themselves before images named after Apostles and Saints he saw them light candles and burn incense on the altar he saw them celebrate the Passover under the name Easter where they elevated the dis shaped bread and honored the Sun God and then they poured the wine out as a libation to the gods but this aged Saint who had traveled 1500 miles could not arrest their downward plunge God spoke through him just as was leaving Ephraim is married to his idols let him alone Hosea 4:15 polycarp never more returned remember brother bradam he goes on to talk about this in in what we're reading tonight but uh I think it was in the Ephesian age where polycarp was I may have that wrong I think it was um brother Bram said that uh that this brother here uh he should have he should have I'm sorry I'm hoping I'm getting this right he should have been the one for the age I apologize yeah polycarp he should have been the one who actually was the one for the age but he was not the messenger for the age because he actually fell for the leadership of man he actually was more for the organized religion than he was for following the word of the Lord Brother Bram gets into that a little further here sorry I was confusing myself it happens easy paragraph 151 following anitus was the Wicked Bishop of Rome called Victor he introduced even more Pagan festivals and ceremonies into the first church and also went about trying his utmost to persuade the true Christian churches to incorporate the same ideas they would not do as he requested so he prevailed upon government officials to persecute the Believers hailing them into court casting them into prison and even meeting out death to many such an example of his vile Deeds is found in history where Emperor Septimus seus was prevailed upon by kalistus the friend of Victor to kill 7,000 at thessalonica because these True Believers celebrated the Passover according to the Lord Jesus and not according to the worship of estarte already the false Vine was turning loose its anger against the Living God by killing the elect even as did its forebear Cain kill Abel just goes right back to the word of God the true church kept trying to get the first church to repent now I got those two highlighted in here it just jumped out at me the true church and the first church first doesn't always mean true it would not do so it increased in size and influence it embarked upon a constant campaign to discredit the true seed they claimed that they and they alone were the true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ and vaunted the fact that they were the original Church in Rome that was the only thing they had to stand on right they never had the power of God in their midst and they alone were the first church indeed they were the first church and indeed they are thus by the time this third Church age we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth married idols and has no life in her she has hybridized herself and the signs of death not life follow in her wake and I want to say this what is the sign of death I got thinking about that the signs of of death are What's following in her wake I'll say this where the churches are dying the numbers are declining people don't want to go to church the children they don't want to serve a God that's just form it's just formal lukewarm formal and Powerless children don't want to serve a god like that children want to serve a God where they see God as a living God where they see god with skin on that's the god that children want to serve but that's what I believe he's talking about here I could be wrong about it but I believe that's the death that's happening it's spiritual death people don't want to serve a god there's no point it's just form she is powerful with many members she is favored by the world the other is a little persecuted group but she follows the word amen and the signs follow her the sick are healed the dead are raised she is alive with the life of the word the life and word of God she loves not her life but holds to his name and his faith even unto death not her faith his faith and so the terrible persecution of official Rome fell upon the True Believers until Constantine arose and granted freedom of religious worship now this is interesting there seems to be two reasons why this Freedom was granted in the first place various good Emperors had not allowed persecution but as they passed on they were followed by those who killed Christians it was so senseless that they finally came to public heed that the Christians ought to be left alone the second and best noted reason is that Constantine had a very difficult battle ahead of him in taking over over the control of the Empire it's interesting how the Lord uses things how he uses people one night in a dream he saw a white cross appear before him he felt that he that this was an omen unto him that if the Christians prayed for a victory for him he would win the battle he promised freedom for them in the event that he was Victorious he was Victorious and the freedom of worship was granted in the Edict of Nan's 312 a but this freedom from persecution and death was not as magnanimous as it had first appeared he had a motive Constantine was now the patron as a patron his interest was somewhat more than that of an observer for he decided that the church needed his help in her Affairs isn't that nice he had seen them disagreeing over ious matters and this is really isn't it beautiful Jesus said how will people know that you have you love me how how will they know you love me you persecute one another you talk about one another you're at odds against one another you claim the same thing you believe you say you see believe the same thing you say you you follow the same Prophet but yet you're divided there's divisions right how is that that doesn't work and this is exactly what a worldly man was observing I just can't help but think it he had seen them disagreeing over various matters one of which involved Aras Bishop of Alexander who taught that his adherence taught his adherence that Jesus was not truly God but a lesser being having been created of God the western church held the opposite view believing that Jesus was the very essence of God and as they said co-equal with the father and isn't it amazing to look at those and say wow it's beautiful to have a prophet that would bring it right to center not one way or not the other way but right in the middle right where it needs to be with such matters along with the intrusion of pagan ceremony into worship the emperor called for the nian council in 3:25 with the thought that he would bring all groups together where they could iron out their differences and come to a common understanding and all be one isn't it peculiar that though this started with Constantine it didn't die but is very much alive today as the World Council of churches and where he failed to truly achieve it it will be achieved in this day through the ecumenical move now this interference of the state with the church is a foolish thing for the for the world does not understand either the truth found in the word or the ways of the church why the very decision handed down by the council Council that Aras was wrong with was that Aras was wrong was reversed two years later by the emperor and for many years that false Doctrine was foed upon the people but that church and state would come together was truly forn of the Lord the very name pergamus means thoroughly married and indeed State and church were married politics and religion were United The Offspring of that Union have been consistently the most horrible hybrids the world has ever seen the truth is not in them but all the evil ways of Cain the first hybrid Is Not only was State and church wedded in this age but the Babylonian religion was officially joined to the first church Satan now had access to the name of Christ can you believe that Satan now had had access to the name of Christ and he was enthroned as God In Worship with the help of Federal Aid the churches fell air to beautiful buildings which were lined with altars of white marble and images of The Departed Saints now I don't know how many people have had the opportunity to do it but if you ever get the chance go to the UK and take a look at some of of those churches and this becomes alive you can see what he's talking about if you ever get a chance to go to Italy and see some of the churches the Basilica is there see their churches this becomes alive the state funded the building of these buildings and even today you can't even imagine what these buildings would cost to build just tremendous I think is it in Spain there's a church that's just not even finished they've been building it for I don't know a hundred years or something and it's still not done they're still buing building on it it's crazy but it's true it's when the the church and state become one with the help of Federal Aid the churches fell air to beautiful buildings which were lined with altars of white marble and images of The Departed Saints and right in this age is when the Beast of Revelations 13:3 that was wounded to death the Rome the Pagan Roman Empire came back to life and power as the holy Roman Empire brother bradam thoroughly brings that out in the study of the seals Rome was a material nation and had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely but it it mattered not now for her religious Empire would keep her on top of the world governing from inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside he says let me show the exact scriptural truth of this matter for I do not anyone want anyone to think that I am giving a revelation of my own one not found in scripture isn't that beautiful how he would say that let's just take it right back to the word once again and uh yeah yeah it's just amazing I like it I like it a lot he he goes into Daniel chapter 2: 31- 45 this is Daniel talking to the King Nebuchadnezzar now about the dream that he had thou oh king sawest and beheld a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible the image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver and his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great Mountain and filled the whole earth we know that that is a representation of Mount Zion the literal city of God this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou oh king art a king of kings for the god of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and Glory it's just beautiful how Daniel would just have the courage to say that that's the only reason you're there buddy is because God is God and whosoever wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee rule over them all Thou Art his this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear bear rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breakthe shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with myy clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with myy Clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure I just love it because he does like we said he does not go into the story of balum and baac he he brings it right down to the rubber meeting the road this is history now this is what's happened in history and this is what's going to happen in the future is what brother bradam does with this he goes on to say herein is revealed an exact account of future unfilled history that was prophesied to come upon the Earth from the time of Daniel until Jesus would come and reign as the son of David we know that's the Millennium it is known as the times of the Gentiles it had within it four historical divisions which were known by the dominating Empire in each division Babylonian Meo Persian Grecian and Roman the Great greatest and most absolute monarchy was the Babylonian which was typified as the head of gold the next in glory was the MEO Persian which as history bore out was truly less glorious and was typified as the breast and arms of silver then there followed the Grecian age whose King was the most brilliant of all military leaders the world has ever known so it was fittingly typified as the belly and thighs of brass it was less glorious than the other two preceding it finally came the last Kingdom which was the Roman Empire typified as the legs and feet but wherein the former kingdoms were typified as pure minerals pure gold silver and Brass this last empire was purely iron only in the legs for when it came to the feet it was a mixture of iron and clay and mineral and soil just don't mix and produce consistency and strength excuse me but not only is this so but most amazing this last empire Roman would endure in its peculiar mixed state right up until Jesus returns that's a pretty long time this Roman Empire of iron iron signifying power and great destructive force against opposition was to be made of two main divisions and and it certainly was for the Empire literally split into two East and West both very powerful crushing all before them but as the glory and power of all Empires fail so this Empire began to fall also thus Rome fell Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron she crumbled she was wounded to death Rome could not now rule it was all over so thought the world but how wrong the world was for that head Rome though wounded was not wounded unto death woest translation of Revelations 133 and one of the heads appeared to have been mortally wounded the throat having been slashed and his death stroke was healed he and the whole earth followed after the wild beast in amazement people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area of his domain how many people know that he has an area of domain inside of the city of Rome there's the country of Italy there's the city of Rome but there's another city inside that City called The Vatican City and they have their own set of rules but he also has his own set of ambassadors that actually go all the way around the world and and yeah it's amazing the influence that that uh little tiny place that actual area of his domain where he rules from is worldwide it's amazing it is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors papal false Christian Rome she is even called The Eternal City how Blasphemous Now controls by religion even more ability than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the pure iron of force now many people would look at this and say you know brother Barry you're crazy you're heretical for even saying this because there's a lot of ecumenical movement there's a lot of denominational churches that are non- denominational and and they're not Roman Catholic and they would say the Roman Catholics are wrong but you know what's interesting is if you look at their website I was talking to someone about this earlier in the week if you look at the websites you know who we are what what we're about about us whatever it is you'll be able to find more times than not the Apostles Creed why do you find the Apostles Creed there because it's it's homage to the mother right brother Bram brought it out very clearly there's a mother and there's harlots and the harlots are the churches of denomination that actually fall under that category and you know what they don't have to swear that they believe the Roman Catholic church because the leaders of those churches already had amen and as long as the leaders do it then everyone who falls under that Ministry they're under that Ministry amen and I think it's interesting because what they do is they actually put a little asterisk in there I didn't bring it tonight maybe we will next time but if you read the Apostles Creed you can type it into Google and come up with the Apostles Creed real easy um it it says a reference in there to the Holy Roman Catholic church and they put a little asterisk by that line of the Apostles Creed and at the bottom they have a clarification that says that the word Catholic just means universal church not the Holy Roman Catholic church but they don't understand it's too late by that point when they're putting that Apostles Creed in there when the prophet for our age said it's wrong they don't understand that they've actually already signed up it's already too late a little asterisk is not going to negate our responsibility to follow the word for our day you know the children of Israel they could not have gone to Jeremiah and said you know what we've got in our word in our in our Creeds and our dogmas in our in our about us on our website we've got a little asterisk that says we're not actually falling under the headship of the king here so uh you know it's going to be okay it won't be okay the only way it will be okay is to fall under the word leadership of the Lord through the Vindicated profit for your age that's the only way it will work but everyone else they don't understand it they're already under the influence of Rome and the people in North America maybe don't understand it but alls you have to do we've said it before brother Ken brought it out real clear he played the video here of Tony Palmer in the states and this is with this Pope the pope that's in Vatican City right now reigning as the current pope if you look up Tony Palmer in Google you will see the video that the pastor the former Pastor here played and what he shows is him standing there telling his relation to the pope and how he's the Ambassador for the pope and they play a video from the Pope the pope speaking and and he's talking to an ecumenical council all of the religious leaders in Greater North America Maybe maybe even in Europe and around the world hosted by Kenneth Copeland one of the big big ones probably the biggest one in the states hosting this by the church the Roman Catholic church and what does he tell he tells them two things that really struck out to me I don't know why I'm going off like this I just think it's important to understand how how late it really is he said that I come in the spirit of unity and I come under the anointing of the spirit of Elijah to The ecumenical movement you hear that you're like buddy that's already happened the Revival's done gone but what he says is the word Catholic means Universal so we're we're more alike than we are different aren't we and he goes on to talk like that and he says you know what I want to tell you is that the lutherans have actually already signed an approval that the protest of Luther is over they've come to the Catholic church and the Catholic church has come to them and they have made amends and now they agree to fall under the leadership of the Holy Roman Catholic church and he says it very clearly that the protest with Luther is over so what about you what about your protest are you still protesting because the word Catholic means Universal so we're more Christians than than we're not we're more together than we're apart and here we had a prophet saying it's later than you think my goodness I should call the musicians I'll just read a couple more paragraphs here that's okay paragraph 168 I I'll just read this part here papal false Christianity Rome she is even called that Eternal City how Blasphemous Now controls by religion not politics by religion but religion is definitely in the politics controls by religion even more a then when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the pure iron of force Rome took on a new lease of Life I'll call the musicians up or I will keep going Rome took on a new lease of life and I mean we don't have to end I'm good we can keep going that's fine I'm going to hear about it later I love you honey it's all good I'll just stop talking Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and backed the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates the motivates false Christian R you can see that is so because you now know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed in its outer texture isn't that amazing how he would bring that to life how he would bring it to light the iron and the clay they won't mix and and that that will remain in place until the Eternal reign of the Throne of David I think that's amazing because that's going to go even beyond that that rule will go even Beyond The Rapture of the church right all the way to the very end once the Nan Council had swung the power of political role to the church it seemed that there would be no limits to which this First Christian Church would go the name Christian which originally brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors my terrible brothers and sisters I want to say this tonight let us never ever find ourselves with that label let us never ever have a persecution attitude towards anyone else on this Earth because if we do we're falling under this category we're following under this headship this spirit is actually getting a hold of Our Lives we do not want to persecute anyone what we want to do is uplift and encourage our brothers and our sisters we want to uplift and encourage the Sinners the rank lost ones in this world that have no hope we want to give them the encouragement that they need not persecute them maybe stand with me as we close gracious heavenly father I just can't help but think about this last statement that we read Lord how the how the church went from being persecuted to becoming the persecutor father I I pray that Lord we would maybe just consider these words and as we go our separate ways tonight that we would just look around this world and and consider how the rest of this world has no ability to hear what we hear and and it's only because you've given us ears to hear it's only because of election it's only because of your predestination it's only because of your grace that we're able to hear this word in our age and because of your grace we say Amen because of your grace we worship you because of your grace we sigh and we cry for the Abominations in this land because we can see that Lord this whole world is lost and there's only a very few that you have chosen father I pray that every single one of us would have the desire in our hearts not to persecute but Lord to create such an atmosphere in this world around us even with the Sinners of this life that we could maybe give them an opportunity to extend to us some cor some kindness Lord maybe a a glass of cold water maybe a glass of warm water just something kind help us Lord Jesus to create that atmosphere to never look at someone and Scorn upon them to never have the desire to persecute within the church or without father let us live by that Grace let us look unto you father and see that it's only by your grace that we're saved through the faith that you put inside of us Lord before the foundation of the world we love you father we thank you for this word we pray that you would be with those who are still traveling Lord that you would Grant to them traveling mercies that you would allow them to be a blessing to those people around them Father and that you would bring them home safely again at the appointed time lord we love you and we thank you we just commit all things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen amen I pledge allegiance to the lamb I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a Ty thr they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of Christ So What by one they chose to die Son of God they would not deny like a great Angelic fire [Music] sings ohes I pled alance to the lamb all my strength with all I am I will see to honor his command I pledge the to the lamb now the years have come and
