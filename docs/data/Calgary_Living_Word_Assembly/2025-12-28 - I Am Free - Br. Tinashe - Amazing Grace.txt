Description:
I Am Free

When I think of Jesus
This man who died for me; took my sins away
What made Him give his life?
What was the meaning of Amazing Grace?
I just couldn't see

This Bloody Lamb that was slain, for me
I could not believe
The suffering He bore; took my place, on that tree

Despised and rejected
It pleased the Father to, give His son, for my life
Smitten and afflicted
I am now a prisoner of Christ

I've never known such love
To save me from the wrath, He covered me,
With His blood
Amazing Grace I see
Justified I stand;

I am Free 
From the bondage of sin
Christ now dwells within
I am free
He was the perfect sacrifice
The Lamb gave me His life

The cross x2
Now im living my life in the bloody 
footprints of the cross

The cross x 2
Lord please keep me in the bloody footprints of the cross
