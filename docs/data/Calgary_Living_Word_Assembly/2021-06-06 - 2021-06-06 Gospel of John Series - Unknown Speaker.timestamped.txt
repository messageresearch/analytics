[0:00] would have looked down on and and and
[0:01] said who who is this person
[0:04] who is Elijah the wild man that is is
[0:08] gird about with camel skins and eats
[0:11] locusts and and honey who is this wild
[0:14] man who is this this fanatic John the
[0:17] Baptist down on the river baptizing
[0:19] people unto repentance who who is this
[0:22] guy
[0:23] he's a wild man put him in jail and and
[0:26] he went into jail and you know it was
[0:28] fine for him to be there
[0:31] but look at the persecution that came
[0:33] against water baptism then
[0:37] and look at the persecution that came
[0:39] against water baptism in our day
[0:42] it's the same thing it's the same
[0:44] Spirits it's good and evil continually
[0:46] battling Satan knows that if if if if
[0:49] the children get the true revelation
[0:52] the true church gets the true revelation
[0:54] of the Antichrist Spirit within the
[0:57] framework of where
[0:59] the denominational world no within the
[1:01] framework of the Christian church if we
[1:04] can get that Revelation how do we get
[1:06] that Revelation brothers and sisters to
[1:07] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:09] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:11] and then you shall receive the gift of
[1:14] the Holy Ghost but outside of following
[1:16] the program outside of having the desire
[1:18] to actually come according to the word
[1:20] aside from having
[1:22] the ability to set aside our pride and
[1:26] say I I don't have any Pride I've got
[1:28] nothing to lose I I have nothing on my
[1:32] own I'm willing to actually see
[1:35] I want to see Jesus
[1:38] if we're willing to do that
[1:41] then he'll reveal himself to us he
[1:42] doesn't reveal himself to the proud
[1:45] does he
[1:46] no he reveals himself unto babes such as
[1:49] would learn
[1:51] but you know
[1:52] Pride
[1:54] the original sin in heaven
[1:57] that's the thing that gets in the way of
[2:00] everyone being able to get truly
[2:02] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:04] Christ baptized according to the word
[2:07] which is what will actually give you the
[2:10] ability to see the revelation of Jesus
[2:12] Christ in our day
[2:14] but you know the people who actually get
[2:17] that are the ones that just set aside
[2:19] all of their pride in all of their
[2:20] Theology and all of their teachings and
[2:22] thinking and and belief structures and
[2:25] say you know just
[2:26] like we said we preached out a little
[2:28] while ago I'll probably read it again
[2:29] today but you know Mary she couldn't go
[2:31] through her catalog of Theology and say
[2:34] well you know it's got to be according
[2:36] to this because I was taught that and
[2:38] unless the other thing no she said you
[2:40] know how can this be but hey there
[2:43] stands Before Me an Angel messenger and
[2:45] he's giving me a message that I'm highly
[2:48] favored
[2:50] brothers and sisters we've had an angel
[2:53] messenger in our day that has come to
[2:55] say that you are highly favored of God
[2:59] and the only thing you have to do is say
[3:01] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[3:05] you're the angel of God
[3:07] a messenger from God
[3:11] but Satan has caused so much confusion
[3:14] around a messenger from God so many
[3:17] people
[3:18] you know brother Bradham he preached at
[3:20] false anointed ones at the end time
[3:23] there will be many
[3:25] christs which is out of the word many
[3:28] christs
[3:29] anointed ones
[3:31] ones that will actually come as an angel
[3:33] of Light thou claim the message of the
[3:35] hour
[3:36] they won't just claim Christ they won't
[3:39] just claim the Bible but they'll claim
[3:41] the message of the hour
[3:43] false anointed ones we need to be very
[3:46] cautious very careful brothers and
[3:48] sisters there's only one Angel Messenger
[3:51] to this age
[3:52] if we start following some other guy
[3:55] that claims to have some Edge on the
[3:58] message of the hour he's a false
[4:00] anointed one
[4:02] that might be real strong but it's real
[4:04] true
[4:05] because the only thing a true anointed
[4:08] one will say is follow Christ
[4:12] that's all and that's exactly what the
[4:15] seventh angel messenger said
[4:17] follow Christ
[4:21] but you know he comes he comes to his
[4:23] own
[4:24] and when his own see him they say beat
[4:27] unto me according to Thy Word
[4:30] that light flashes across that seed
[4:33] this woman said this is Brother Brown
[4:35] I'm speaking in a Christ of mystery I'm
[4:36] looking for a messiah and when that
[4:38] Messiah comes he'll do the very same
[4:41] thing he'll tell us these things he'll
[4:44] he'll understand that you know I have a
[4:47] longing in my heart from a little girl I
[4:49] just I just wanted to have someone that
[4:51] would love me someone that would
[4:52] appreciate me someone that would
[4:54] actually just just cherish me as a wife
[4:57] that would say that that that you're
[5:00] highly favored to me
[5:03] but because I didn't have a good
[5:05] relationship with my dad
[5:07] because things didn't work out when I
[5:08] was a little girl
[5:10] I went looking for that relationship
[5:12] somewhere else
[5:14] and I found it in a man I thought at one
[5:17] time in my life
[5:18] and that man he didn't turn out to be a
[5:20] very good man he mistreated me
[5:23] he treated me wrong he did me real wrong
[5:27] and because of that I left him
[5:31] and I went to survive
[5:33] and I raised my kids on my own
[5:36] and as I did that I found someone else
[5:39] and he began to treat me nice
[5:43] and so I got with him
[5:45] and I lived with him for a certain time
[5:47] and then I found that he was wrong
[5:51] and then I found another man and I
[5:53] thought maybe he would be the one that
[5:55] would actually treat me right and found
[5:57] out that he was wrong
[6:01] and I went on and here she finds herself
[6:04] now in a real fix at the end of her life
[6:08] grown up her children probably raised
[6:11] believing that there's just nothing for
[6:14] her in this world
[6:15] but still having a belief deep down
[6:18] inside that there is a messiah going to
[6:20] come and maybe maybe he would be the one
[6:23] that would give that life to me that
[6:25] would give that love to me that that
[6:26] that that thing that I just longed for
[6:29] so much in my soul
[6:32] still holding on to a belief in her
[6:35] heart
[6:37] and to just be going about her business
[6:40] to just be living her life not even
[6:42] looking anymore
[6:44] just going to draw water as it was
[6:47] custom for the ones who maybe weren't
[6:49] the cherished ones
[6:51] the ones who maybe were looked down upon
[6:54] from the city
[6:55] here she goes just about her daily
[6:57] business and while she's doing it what
[7:00] happens the word itself comes to her
[7:06] I just wonder how many of us today have
[7:08] been doing that in our own lives and
[7:11] have had the word itself come to us but
[7:14] you know brothers and sisters
[7:16] we've got to be able to recognize the
[7:18] word when it comes to us
[7:20] we can't look at it through our own
[7:22] teaching we can't look at it through our
[7:25] own traditions we can't look at it
[7:27] Through The Eyes of denomination or
[7:29] we'll miss it we've got to look at it
[7:32] through our own heart
[7:35] and when we do that
[7:36] then he will speak to us
[7:39] this woman had a conversation with the
[7:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[7:45] can you imagine that
[7:48] it was for an example brothers and
[7:50] sisters
[7:52] so many times we see scriptures and and
[7:55] one one man can be named in one
[7:57] scripture and what an honor and a
[7:59] privilege it would be to have your name
[8:01] as one scripture
[8:03] but to look at how many verses this
[8:07] conversation goes on about this woman my
[8:10] goodness
[8:13] he'll tell us these things he says he
[8:15] said I am he she was longing for this
[8:20] she was longing in her heart that there
[8:23] had to be a truth somewhere in this
[8:26] world of of sin and Corruption and and
[8:29] confusion and frustration there had to
[8:31] be some truth in this world somewhere
[8:38] and to have him say to her I am he
[8:42] brother Branham says oh Lord she left
[8:45] her pot here he was come see a man who's
[8:48] told me the things what was it it was
[8:51] that light that struck that seed
[8:54] only those who the father has given me
[8:58] will come
[9:01] that light it struck that seed that was
[9:03] placed in her from before the foundation
[9:05] of the world my goodness that light
[9:07] struck the seed he says that life was
[9:10] there it come forth and imagine after he
[9:14] discerned her heart she didn't care
[9:16] anymore about the water she didn't care
[9:18] anymore about what the people thought
[9:21] about her she didn't care anymore about
[9:23] anything because she found that one
[9:26] person that one thing that she longed
[9:29] for her entire life to give her that
[9:32] love
[9:34] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[9:36] she was raptured into that Revelation
[9:38] she got it and what did she do she ran
[9:41] right back into the City and told
[9:43] everyone about the man come and see a
[9:45] man who told me the things that I have
[9:47] done would she have ever done that
[9:49] before if she never met Messiah she
[9:52] wouldn't go and tell anyone about the
[9:53] things she'd done
[9:54] she was one of the shunned remember
[9:58] it's tremendous to think about it that
[10:00] that light it struck the seed
[10:03] it's no different today brothers and
[10:04] sisters
[10:05] he'll come right to where we are
[10:08] he will do that
[10:11] the story of of of maybe even just
[10:14] um I'll just say it this way in in our
[10:16] life having a business we have an
[10:18] employee and and and to have an employee
[10:21] there who is going to have a brain bleed
[10:23] and you know what he has the opportunity
[10:25] one time in his life to fellowship with
[10:28] the word maybe he's dealt with other
[10:30] believers I I don't know we we interact
[10:33] in our lives every day and you know what
[10:35] how the Lord comes to those people in
[10:37] this world today is through you and I
[10:40] brothers and sisters
[10:41] that's his choice
[10:45] and outside of that you know brother
[10:46] Branham says it somewhere that we are
[10:48] the only Christ
[10:51] that this world will ever see
[10:54] to think about that
[10:57] and you know
[10:58] the people who actually don't get the
[11:00] word from us
[11:02] again brother Branham says it maybe not
[11:04] exactly like this but he says it that
[11:08] we will be responsible
[11:10] for those people that don't actually
[11:13] come to the fullness of the word
[11:15] those people that actually wind up
[11:18] before the white Throne of judgment
[11:21] for not testifying of of the Lord Jesus
[11:24] Christ in our life Maybe by
[11:25] misrepresenting it maybe by not actually
[11:28] talking about it at the right time who
[11:30] knows maybe by not doing the right
[11:32] business deal at the moment
[11:34] we don't know
[11:37] whether Bradham says same thing today
[11:40] he's going on and Christ is the mystery
[11:42] I'll just go back and read that that
[11:44] light struck the seed that life was
[11:46] there it come forth same thing today but
[11:49] the theologians say now wait just a
[11:51] minute
[11:53] I'll find out if so and so if Pastor
[11:56] Moody said
[11:58] he says what's Pastor Moody Got to Do
[12:00] with It
[12:02] I'm going to jump ahead here for a
[12:03] second I I said it before and I found it
[12:06] astounding and and I still find it
[12:08] astounding brother Bradham says what
[12:11] caused the people to actually become
[12:14] misled
[12:16] throughout the ages
[12:18] what what caused them to become misled
[12:20] he says it in this message here he said
[12:22] fallen angels
[12:24] fallen angels and he says what fallen
[12:27] angels
[12:28] and he says Luther
[12:30] Wesley
[12:33] Arrhenius
[12:35] it's pretty amazing but you have to
[12:38] actually go further to hear what he's
[12:39] actually saying about that he's not
[12:41] saying that those Messengers were Fallen
[12:44] Angels he's saying that Fallen Angels
[12:47] got in underneath their Ministry and
[12:50] actually Twisted the words slightly and
[12:52] caused a denomination to happen under
[12:55] that message
[12:58] it's pretty astounding when you look at
[13:00] it because if he is Jesus Christ the
[13:02] same yesterday today and forever his
[13:03] program is the same he says it right
[13:05] here it's the same thing today but
[13:07] theologians say hold on a second I'm
[13:10] going to go and actually search out what
[13:12] what what what this Pastor said or what
[13:13] brother so and so said instead of
[13:16] allowing the word to wash over them
[13:19] hold on a second my theology is actually
[13:22] going to take control here not
[13:24] Revelation not the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:26] it's pretty amazing when you look at it
[13:29] that way
[13:30] but but brother Bradham says that it's
[13:32] fallen angels that actually caused this
[13:34] confusion to happen it's astounding when
[13:36] you look at it
[13:38] they come in right after the message the
[13:40] Fallen Angels come right in to where
[13:42] it's so close that it would deceive the
[13:44] very elected if it were possible it's
[13:46] not out there it's not the Catholic
[13:47] church it's not the Baptists or whatever
[13:50] it's right here brothers and sisters so
[13:53] close that it would deceive us if it
[13:54] were possible but if we've been baptized
[13:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[13:58] the remission of our sins there is a
[14:00] promise unto us where we shall receive
[14:02] the Holy Ghost and when he the spirit of
[14:04] truth comes into our own lives he will
[14:06] lead us into what into all truth he
[14:09] won't let us be be led astray brother
[14:12] Branham says same thing today but now
[14:13] the theologians say now wait just a
[14:15] minute I'll find out if so and so if
[14:17] Pastor moody or or what's Pastor Moody
[14:19] got to do with this today
[14:21] Pastor Moody lived in his day but not
[14:24] now certainly not Luther lived in his
[14:26] day but in the day of Wesley but not in
[14:28] the day of Wesley he says Wesley lived
[14:30] in his day not in the day of Pentecost
[14:32] Pentecost lived in their day but they
[14:34] were a long ways from this in this hour
[14:36] We're in the last hour sure
[14:39] their organizations and scrupled up
[14:43] proves that it's not there
[14:45] the word has never been correctly
[14:47] Vindicated just only in its strength
[14:51] seeds denominations
[14:54] and they make denominations
[14:56] and then put them old gyms and weed
[14:58] seeds in with that genuine wheat
[15:03] hybrid it
[15:04] get them in there to choke it out
[15:08] he said that's right green Briars and
[15:10] nettles
[15:12] went on back to that it died right out
[15:17] then they broke the field up and started
[15:19] over again
[15:20] planted some real seeds
[15:23] and some of them come up and choked it
[15:25] out
[15:28] excuse me at the beginning of this quote
[15:30] here
[15:32] brother Branham says same thing today
[15:34] but the theologians say now wait just a
[15:37] minute
[15:39] when people do that
[15:41] they stop the power of God right there
[15:43] in their own lives
[15:45] when when we hear about the message of
[15:47] the hour because really honestly truly
[15:49] everyone's heard of Jesus Christ for the
[15:52] most part right
[15:53] there's all kinds of of Christian Church
[15:56] all over the world the Roman Catholics
[15:58] have done an outstanding job of that
[16:01] Jesus Christ is everywhere and
[16:06] what's not everywhere is the word of the
[16:08] hour the message of the hour and and
[16:11] it's almost everywhere
[16:13] but it's the message of the hour the
[16:14] message under the seventh angel
[16:15] messenger that's what will actually
[16:18] bring the culmination of all the ages
[16:20] together but that is the message of the
[16:24] hour is Jesus Christ coming and sitting
[16:26] down
[16:27] saying
[16:30] give me a drink
[16:33] and we have the opportunity to say whoa
[16:35] wait a second
[16:37] I don't know if I want to talk to you
[16:39] because I don't know if I believe it the
[16:40] way you believe it that's why I said at
[16:42] the beginning brothers and sisters
[16:43] there's people out there that they might
[16:45] actually be true Sons and Daughters of
[16:47] God but they just haven't been shown
[16:49] the true life of Jesus Christ
[16:51] through some sort of a denominational
[16:52] belief
[16:55] I took a look at uh
[16:57] at old old Websters Noah Websters
[17:01] uh dictionary
[17:03] and I looked up the word theology
[17:06] and and I found it astounding it's one
[17:08] of those words so I'll just read it this
[17:10] morning remember brother Branham says it
[17:12] here
[17:14] same thing today
[17:15] that seed
[17:17] that light flashes across the seed
[17:20] and that seed comes to life
[17:22] he says same thing today
[17:24] but the theologic theologians say now
[17:27] wait just a minute I know that light
[17:29] flashed across I know something just
[17:30] happened here but wait just a minute
[17:33] I just want to check it up I just want
[17:35] to see
[17:36] and not check it up with the word but
[17:38] check it up with what Pastor so-and-so
[17:40] says the theology
[17:42] so I looked up that word theology it
[17:44] says the science of God and divine
[17:46] things
[17:48] or the science which teaches the
[17:50] existence or character and attributes of
[17:53] God
[17:54] his laws and government
[17:57] the doctrines
[17:58] we are to believe and the duties we are
[18:02] to practice theology
[18:06] theology
[18:08] consists of two branches
[18:12] this is where it gets good natural
[18:15] and revealed
[18:18] natural theology is the knowledge we
[18:22] have of God from his works
[18:26] by the light of Nature and of reason
[18:31] revealed theology
[18:33] is that which is to be learned only from
[18:38] revelation
[18:40] only from revelation
[18:43] we're not looking at natural theology
[18:46] here
[18:48] and that's the difference I believe
[18:49] brothers and sisters we can actually
[18:51] start to begin taking the message of the
[18:54] hour and creating a natural theology
[18:57] with the message of the hour and say
[18:59] that I've got all the quotes and I know
[19:01] exactly where this this was quoted and
[19:04] exactly how it was quoted and what it
[19:06] was quoted about we can have all of that
[19:09] but if we don't have the revelation we
[19:11] miss exactly what he said
[19:15] we're not talking about natural Theology
[19:17] of the message of the hour we're talking
[19:19] about spiritual theology here
[19:22] it has to be spiritual we know that
[19:26] Jesus said to Peter Flesh and Blood
[19:27] hasn't revealed that unto you Peter but
[19:30] my Father which is in heaven hath
[19:32] revealed it unto you and Upon This Rock
[19:34] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[19:37] Hell shall not Prevail against it not
[19:39] not talking about natural theology that
[19:42] that we get through nature and and that
[19:45] we understand through through the Flesh
[19:47] and and what we see in terms of light no
[19:49] way no it's not a natural carnal thing
[19:54] it's Christ revealed to you the
[19:56] individual personally
[19:58] but when that happens it's just like the
[20:00] woman at the well something happens
[20:02] finally we see that that one person that
[20:07] one thing that we've longed for our
[20:09] entire lives come to us and reveal
[20:12] himself to us personally
[20:15] revealed theology is that which is to be
[20:18] learned only from revelation
[20:20] it has to be Christ revealing himself to
[20:23] us personally
[20:26] you know talking about the woman at the
[20:28] well
[20:33] verse 13 Jesus answered and said unto
[20:36] her whosoever drinketh of this water
[20:37] shall never thirst again but whosoever
[20:41] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[20:43] him shall never thirst again but the
[20:46] water that I shall give him shall be in
[20:49] him a well of water springing up into
[20:52] everlasting life
[20:56] totally talking about
[20:59] a revelation
[21:02] although it's a natural substance
[21:04] they're speaking about
[21:08] many people would say there's no way
[21:10] that the water could actually do that
[21:11] and truly it wouldn't be able to do that
[21:15] there was another one that that Jesus
[21:17] talks about over in John chapter 7 if
[21:20] you want to turn over there John chapter
[21:22] 7.
[21:26] we could probably start with verse 36.
[21:30] John chapter 7 verse 36.
[21:38] what manner of saying is this that he
[21:40] said ye shall seek me and shall not find
[21:43] me and and where I am hither ye cannot
[21:47] come
[21:48] in the last day that great day of the
[21:50] feast Jesus stood up and cried saying if
[21:53] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[21:56] drink
[21:57] what were we gonna drink some people
[21:59] would have said he already said unless
[22:01] you eat of My Flesh and drink of my
[22:03] blood you have no part in me
[22:05] right
[22:07] unless you come unto me and drink
[22:09] and then he says in verse 38 he that
[22:11] believeth on me as the scripture hath
[22:13] said
[22:15] not theology hath said on this he that
[22:19] believeth on me as a scripture hath said
[22:21] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[22:25] Living Water
[22:27] how many people that believe on him as
[22:30] the scripture saith see out of their
[22:32] mouths
[22:33] rivers of Living Water
[22:36] we're not talking about a natural thing
[22:37] here we're talking very specifically
[22:39] about a personally revealed revelation
[22:42] of who the Lord Jesus Christ is through
[22:45] the prophet of the hour
[22:48] in Jesus day there was a prophet
[22:51] declaring there's one coming that I'm
[22:53] not even worthy to loose the latchets on
[22:56] his sandals
[22:57] but I must decrease so that he could
[23:00] increase and we know the same thing
[23:01] happened in our day brothers and sisters
[23:04] and when we hear the word for our day
[23:07] what do we do with it what what do we do
[23:10] with this Jesus that we call Christ
[23:14] the anointed one for our day what do we
[23:16] do with him do we accept him and say
[23:18] just like Mary be it unto me according
[23:20] to thy will or no hold on a second I I
[23:23] I'm just going to confirm it with with
[23:25] Pastor so and so
[23:27] and we'll see if he believes such and
[23:30] such you know there's no greater
[23:32] Revelation in this age than what the
[23:34] prophet for our day brought
[23:36] no greater revelation
[23:39] every Revelation that is truly of Christ
[23:42] will fall under the message of that hour
[23:46] and the simplest form we always go back
[23:48] to it but let's just do it for a moment
[23:50] the simplest form is Noah
[23:52] it's going to rain God gave me
[23:54] instructions to build a boat and whoever
[23:56] wants to live get in the boat
[23:59] that's all you got to do is just get in
[24:01] the boat
[24:02] and you know it's the same thing for us
[24:04] today brothers and sisters we say it
[24:05] over and over again but it's true all
[24:07] you need to do is get the Holy Ghost
[24:10] but it's not for everyone to get the
[24:12] Holy Ghost I'm coming to that Revelation
[24:13] myself it's not for everyone to get the
[24:15] Holy Ghost
[24:16] only a few people those ones that he has
[24:19] called
[24:20] are the ones that are predestinated to
[24:23] get the Holy Ghost
[24:25] there's going to be a lot of people that
[24:26] actually are around there's there's
[24:29] there's there's wise virgins and unwise
[24:31] virgins and they're all virgins
[24:35] but only some of them will have oil when
[24:37] that shout goes forward
[24:39] behold the bridegroom cometh
[24:41] you know there's no time frame
[24:44] in that in that in that in that that
[24:47] story of the the wise and the foolish
[24:49] virgins there's no specific time frame
[24:51] given
[24:53] we know there's a shout a voice and a
[24:55] trump out of Thessalonians we know that
[24:57] brother Branham said that the Rapture is
[24:58] a process
[25:00] the end of the world is a process it's
[25:01] not going to be Clockwork it's not going
[25:04] to be exactly what the theologians say
[25:06] it's not going to be according to
[25:07] Natural Science
[25:09] The Book of Revelation already has parts
[25:11] of it fulfilled
[25:13] and and that's the way it is God will
[25:15] actually just just reveal himself how he
[25:18] will and not everyone is actually called
[25:21] to get the true baptism of the Holy
[25:23] Spirit but those people who are they
[25:25] will
[25:26] everyone will come not one of his will
[25:29] be lost
[25:31] but the Branham goes on to say but then
[25:33] God said in this last days he'd bring
[25:36] out a people washed in his blood
[25:39] and they
[25:41] were predestinated to be there
[25:44] they've got to be there
[25:46] God said so
[25:49] I just believe that that's all of the
[25:51] people who truly believe the message of
[25:53] the hour
[25:54] those people who reject the mark of the
[25:56] beast by accepting
[25:58] the mark of the spirit
[26:00] by accepting the holy ghost in your life
[26:04] and we know that to resist the Holy
[26:06] Ghost In Our Lives to say that maybe I
[26:09] just can wait I I don't know maybe I
[26:11] could get baptized at a later date I
[26:12] don't know maybe God will reveal it to
[26:14] me in a little bit greater way or
[26:16] whatever do you know what brothers and
[26:17] sisters potentially you're putting
[26:19] yourself in a position where you're
[26:21] actually hanging on to or or maybe not
[26:25] sealing out the mark of the beast
[26:28] brother Branham said it that if you
[26:29] reject the Holy Ghost you accept the
[26:31] mark of the beast it is that simple
[26:34] and really it's terrible not everyone
[26:37] will be lost I'm not saying that there
[26:39] might be people that will be saved we
[26:40] know that the five un unwise virgins the
[26:43] foolish virgin is what the word says
[26:45] those ones Will Truly find themselves in
[26:48] eternal life but they'll have to go
[26:50] through the not whole sideways they're
[26:52] going to go through the tribulation and
[26:53] and you know there's going to be Sorrows
[26:55] that have never been known on the face
[26:57] of the Earth in that situation not one
[26:59] of us wants to go through that
[27:01] why would we ever put ourselves in a
[27:03] position where we would go through that
[27:04] why would we resist the Holy Ghost
[27:06] why would we do that it doesn't make any
[27:08] sense but you know what it's not for
[27:10] everyone
[27:12] if you have been given the ability to
[27:13] receive the Holy Ghost we have reason to
[27:15] shout we have reason to do cartwheels we
[27:19] can be like gymnasts like Olympian
[27:21] gymnasts to think that God chose me from
[27:24] before the foundation of the world to be
[27:26] a recipient of the greatest honor ever
[27:28] given to a human being in this earth and
[27:30] that is to be able to speak to God
[27:33] himself
[27:34] not through a pastor not through a pope
[27:37] not through a prophet
[27:39] but the ability to recognize that I'm
[27:41] truly a son and if I'm a son that I can
[27:43] approach my daddy and say hey
[27:46] I have a need and and I desire to hear
[27:49] from you
[27:51] he says and they were predestinated to
[27:53] be there
[27:55] they've got to be there
[27:57] God said so
[27:59] and it would reveal
[28:01] and the Very sign
[28:04] he says I was Malachi for
[28:07] and what he would do
[28:09] restore back again
[28:12] restore back
[28:14] all the years
[28:16] that the Palmer worm that the canker
[28:18] worm
[28:19] all the years going back to our story
[28:22] this morning
[28:24] all the years that that first
[28:26] will say all the years that maybe that
[28:29] that woman at the well missed out with
[28:30] her dad in her relationship
[28:33] he will restore it all back again all of
[28:36] the years that that woman suffered under
[28:38] the hand of her first husband thinking
[28:40] that she would find the love that she
[28:42] longed for all of the years that she
[28:45] suffered under the second husband and
[28:46] the third husband and the fourth husband
[28:50] and even the fifth one all of the years
[28:52] all that she had lost he will restore
[28:57] he would restore I had a conversation in
[29:00] my life one time
[29:04] when I had just become a Christian
[29:06] and I really wanted to
[29:08] grow in the word and see the word grow
[29:11] in me
[29:13] I had a brother say to me you know what
[29:16] I believe that God could restore back
[29:17] everything that you have lost
[29:19] everything that you missed in your life
[29:22] and I'm standing here now as a witness
[29:25] before God to say hallelujah it's true
[29:29] he did restore he did prophesy in the
[29:32] moment
[29:33] he is a God
[29:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[29:37] and forever
[29:39] but you have to unreservedly accept him
[29:42] you've got to be willing to go all the
[29:44] way you can't just be reserved and say
[29:45] I'm going to run whatever it is I hear
[29:47] through my former theology I'm going to
[29:49] take whatever it is I hear preached and
[29:51] say I'm going to run it through brother
[29:53] so and so even though he claims to
[29:55] believe the message he maybe doesn't
[29:57] have the full revelation of it yet
[30:00] can't do that Brothers and Sisters
[30:02] You've got to be willing to run it
[30:03] through the word
[30:05] amen you've got to be willing to run it
[30:07] through the profit we've got the ability
[30:10] to take any thought that we hear or or
[30:12] capture anything that has to do with the
[30:14] word and just put it in a message search
[30:15] and let it run through the message and
[30:18] see what the prophet says about it and
[30:19] there's some things that he doesn't talk
[30:21] about in there
[30:22] you know what happens when you have a
[30:24] question
[30:25] like that
[30:27] ask God
[30:29] just just go on our knees and ask God
[30:31] that's all we have to do and you know
[30:32] what he will reveal it to you
[30:35] many times he'll give us an answer that
[30:37] we don't want to hear many times we ask
[30:39] for an answer that will just suit our
[30:42] needs the word in in the Book of James I
[30:44] believe it is says that when we ask we
[30:46] ask a mess because we look to consume it
[30:49] upon our flesh upon the lusts of our
[30:51] flesh we want to serve this body in in
[30:54] this natural theology how we believe
[30:56] that we perceive things and that's not
[30:58] the way we're supposed to do it
[31:00] we're supposed to say he gave us
[31:02] instruction how to pray when his
[31:04] disciples asked him didn't he Our Father
[31:06] who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[31:09] thy kingdom come
[31:11] Thy word be done on Earth as it is in
[31:14] heaven
[31:15] give us this day our daily bread
[31:18] you know he gave us real Specific
[31:20] Instructions Not My will but thy will
[31:22] let Thy word come forward in my life
[31:27] if we could just pray that way then we
[31:29] wouldn't ask to consume the things on
[31:31] the lusts of our flesh then many times I
[31:34] believe it that we wouldn't hear the
[31:36] word no
[31:38] and sometimes we don't hear the word no
[31:39] most times in fact we just don't see an
[31:42] answer come the way we want it to
[31:45] but that doesn't mean that God hasn't
[31:46] answered our prayers God answers our
[31:48] prayers every single time he hears our
[31:51] prayer and he answers them
[31:52] and and you know in the long run he
[31:55] answers our prayers in the way that's
[31:57] best for us
[31:59] so that we can be perfected
[32:03] this story today about the woman at the
[32:05] well just
[32:08] just Thrills me to look at it
[32:11] because it's no different for us today
[32:13] he says that brother Branham says it
[32:15] it's no different today
[32:17] and and if we look at this whole entire
[32:19] story and we just step back for a second
[32:21] and think the prophet of God said that
[32:23] it's no different for today the word was
[32:26] made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word
[32:29] was made flesh and is dwelling Among Us
[32:31] right now and many times the word will
[32:35] come and sit down with us and say give
[32:37] me a drink
[32:39] the word will come and sit down with us
[32:41] and say what's going on many times the
[32:44] word will phone us up and say Hey
[32:45] brother I haven't talked to you for a
[32:47] long time how are you doing
[32:51] it's no different brothers and sisters
[32:53] if you think about it if someone has the
[32:55] Holy Ghost in their life this is where
[32:58] it becomes real confusing and Satan
[33:00] loves to get in and around this and I I
[33:02] just can't get away from it outside of
[33:04] the Holy Ghost we're lost as lost can be
[33:06] it's not an option for a believer it's
[33:09] not an option the Holy Ghost is what we
[33:11] need when we have the Holy Ghost we have
[33:12] Christ
[33:13] we have Jesus Christ in our lives when
[33:16] we talk to our brothers and our sisters
[33:18] we are talking to Jesus Christ in flesh
[33:22] when we think about our brothers and our
[33:24] sisters we're thinking about Jesus
[33:27] Christ in flesh
[33:30] we need to take every thought into
[33:32] captivity brothers and sisters not take
[33:34] it for granted no that's just brother so
[33:36] and so that's just sister so and so
[33:38] that's just their way that's how they
[33:40] are no way
[33:42] if they're believers we need to treat
[33:45] them like they're Jesus Christ you know
[33:47] what brother Branham says we know it I'm
[33:50] just going to say it though he says that
[33:51] when we actually talk about someone we
[33:55] potentially damage them
[34:00] we're having a conversation last night
[34:03] just about the the power of the spoken
[34:06] word in our own lives
[34:07] and I've learned this
[34:09] I have
[34:11] we can talk about someone because of the
[34:13] way their nature is
[34:15] I've experienced this in my own life so
[34:16] this is just me talking and I can I can
[34:19] I can talk because I've experienced it
[34:21] if somebody wants to give a testimony
[34:22] we'll give them the microphone they can
[34:23] do the same
[34:25] but it's got to be word based
[34:27] and you know what when you speak about
[34:30] someone
[34:31] you give them the ability to succeed or
[34:35] to fail
[34:38] the words on our lips if we have the
[34:41] Holy Ghost in our lives
[34:42] are powerful
[34:44] brothers and sisters where do spirits
[34:46] travel
[34:49] do we know
[34:51] Spirits travel
[34:53] on words
[34:55] if you get a minister up here who is a
[34:58] pastor or a minister and they speak
[35:01] words
[35:02] that's mostly truth
[35:03] but but but partially not it's the same
[35:06] thing as the serpent speaking to Eve in
[35:08] the Garden of Eden
[35:10] he has the ability to minister death
[35:13] unto the camp
[35:15] and there's people that will actually
[35:16] become in Peril because of it
[35:19] there's people who are unstable what I'm
[35:21] saying is
[35:22] we have the ability to actually help
[35:25] people or hinder people
[35:28] and whether we understand it or not it's
[35:30] a spiritual principle if we talk
[35:32] positively
[35:33] then we cause positive to come back to
[35:37] us I'm not preaching psychology I'm
[35:39] preaching the third pull here this is
[35:41] the power of the spoken word if we will
[35:45] say good
[35:46] about our brother and our sister
[35:49] guess what will happen
[35:51] things might change in the way our
[35:53] brother and our sister behave
[35:57] but if we say bad things if we just
[35:59] Grumble if we murmur remember we talked
[36:01] about murmuring if we have the low
[36:03] guttural tone about brother so and so
[36:05] and for sister so and so and that's just
[36:07] the way they are guess what they're
[36:09] gonna do they're gonna be that way
[36:12] but if we have the ability to say no I
[36:15] don't think they meant that that way
[36:17] I just know that maybe they do have
[36:19] maybe uh maybe they've got a genetic
[36:21] disposition to a bad temper and they
[36:24] didn't mean to actually fly off the
[36:25] handle and I know that the Lord Jesus is
[36:28] dealing with them and I I know that they
[36:30] love the Lord and I know that if we ever
[36:32] stood Before the Throne of mercy and
[36:34] Grace together that they would just put
[36:35] their arms around me and say I sure love
[36:37] and appreciate you brother
[36:39] I know that's the Son of God I know
[36:42] that's a sister of God I I know it's my
[36:44] brother or my sister and and they don't
[36:46] mean it the way that someone said it or
[36:48] or the way that I perceive it all the
[36:50] time
[36:51] if we start doing that brothers and
[36:52] sisters we could change the outcome of
[36:55] situations we have the power of creation
[36:58] we've got the power to speak a world
[37:00] into existence and go and inhabit it but
[37:03] it won't do us any good
[37:05] but that power is already right there we
[37:07] sing that song the power is already in
[37:10] the sky all you have to do is spread
[37:12] your wings and just let that power
[37:13] that's there just take you up like an
[37:15] eagle brothers and sisters we have the
[37:17] power to do that today with the message
[37:19] of the hour by just saying you know what
[37:21] I'm just going to speak the word I might
[37:23] not understand it but I'm just going to
[37:25] profess it I'm going to confess positive
[37:27] moving forward that's all I'm gonna do
[37:29] I'm going to confess positive about the
[37:31] people at school the principal the
[37:33] teachers the the people that I don't
[37:35] don't like me at all I'm just going to
[37:37] confess positive about them and I'm
[37:39] gonna see what happens
[37:40] try it
[37:42] see if the Lord won't back it up
[37:45] we know that God is not negative
[37:48] Satan is negative we've talked about it
[37:50] at length probably to the point where it
[37:52] just wears some people and I apologize
[37:55] if it does but you know brothers and
[37:57] sisters we are only going to speak one
[37:59] of two thoughts in our lives we are only
[38:02] going to speak what the Lord Jesus
[38:04] Christ puts in our mind or we're going
[38:06] to speak what Satan puts in our mind
[38:08] that's why the word says to take every
[38:10] single word into captivity
[38:13] did you ever notice how you get around
[38:14] some people and the only thing they want
[38:16] to do is talk about other people and
[38:18] criticize other people
[38:20] you know what that is that's a spirit
[38:22] brothers and sisters I got caught up in
[38:24] that in my life
[38:26] and it's weird because I I again just
[38:29] talking about myself here I'm not
[38:31] narcissistic believe me but just because
[38:34] I've experienced it
[38:36] people sometimes that's all they can do
[38:39] is talk about other people
[38:41] and in a negative context
[38:44] and it doesn't do anything any good it
[38:46] doesn't do anybody any good the people
[38:48] who are hearing it that have nothing to
[38:49] do with the situation it makes them feel
[38:51] rotten it makes them feel bad the people
[38:54] who actually you're talking about no
[38:57] doubt spiritually speaking it makes them
[38:59] feel bad and they don't even know why
[39:02] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[39:04] brothers and sisters but against powers
[39:07] of Darkness spiritual wickedness in high
[39:09] places principalities and Powers is what
[39:12] we're wrestling against
[39:14] that's why we need to put on the whole
[39:16] armor of God and not allow Satan to have
[39:18] any any room in our lives
[39:22] and you know we can we can stop right
[39:24] now in our tracks and say you know what
[39:26] Lord forgive me if I have done that Lord
[39:29] just forgive me and you know what he
[39:31] will he will and we can go forwards in a
[39:35] positive way I was thinking about this
[39:37] too you know and I want to throw it out
[39:38] there I'll probably start sprinkling
[39:39] this out there as we go forwards
[39:41] brothers and sisters I know I preached
[39:43] on it for a while but I just want to say
[39:44] it plainly and clearly as we go forwards
[39:46] and we begin to have communion Services
[39:48] don't wait for a communion service to go
[39:51] and deal with ought if you have
[39:52] something against a brother or a brother
[39:54] has something against you or a sister or
[39:56] a sister or a child a child whatever it
[39:58] is
[40:00] will we tarry one for another start
[40:02] right now
[40:03] Terry right now
[40:06] Terry one for another so that when we
[40:09] come to the communion table we don't eat
[40:10] and drink damnation unto ourselves
[40:14] don't make it a thing where we have to
[40:16] you know maybe in 30 seconds or a minute
[40:18] before the pastor says okay let's change
[40:20] the order of the service and now go to
[40:21] the communion table no do it right now
[40:24] don't make it right
[40:27] let the power of the Holy Spirit just
[40:29] wash over you like the water of the word
[40:31] and just watch the The Liberation happen
[40:34] in your life and your brother or your
[40:36] sister's life when you go and you make
[40:38] something right it changes everything
[40:40] you have the potential if there is
[40:42] something in your life to actually
[40:44] change the outcome of a service
[40:47] maybe maybe I'll just say this I don't
[40:50] know
[40:51] because I don't know all the Dynamics
[40:52] between the people I know people have a
[40:55] hard time getting together and we've
[40:57] said it before that there's such a
[40:58] different
[40:59] Dynamic of people here from all kinds of
[41:02] walks there's very educated Highly
[41:04] Educated very high earning people to
[41:06] maybe people like me that are very low
[41:08] educated that don't really know very
[41:10] much about anything and everyone in
[41:12] between and Naturally Speaking we would
[41:15] never Fellowship together
[41:17] but you know what brings us together is
[41:19] the fellowship of Christ the word for
[41:22] our day and if we have the ability to
[41:24] overcome Satan
[41:26] by Discerning and withstanding the
[41:29] Antichrist spirit that would try and
[41:30] creep into the framework of the
[41:32] Christian Church Satan will be powerless
[41:34] before us brothers and sisters imagine
[41:37] that if Satan could be powerless before
[41:39] you this morning well he can be
[41:42] it's not just a pipe dream the prophet
[41:45] for our day prophesied it
[41:47] he spoke the words and nothing will stop
[41:50] God's word from coming to pass
[41:52] nothing
[41:54] we have the ability to see Satan
[41:56] powerless before us
[41:59] tarry one for another don't wait for a
[42:02] communion service
[42:03] and don't wait and think that maybe I'll
[42:05] just go make it right after go do it now
[42:08] do it right now we don't know what
[42:10] tomorrow holds but what I was getting at
[42:13] is we have the potential to impact the
[42:15] way a service happens maybe brother so
[42:18] and so maybe brother Barry is going to
[42:19] come and preach again and I just pray
[42:21] Lord send us someone that can feed us
[42:25] maybe that's on our heart you know what
[42:27] brothers and sisters just examine your
[42:29] life I'll say this just examine your
[42:31] life is there any ought there is there
[42:33] anything in your life that maybe you
[42:35] could just make a little bit better
[42:36] according to the word because if there
[42:38] is just see if God won't take brother
[42:40] Berry and change him in such a way that
[42:42] he'll be able to preach the word that
[42:44] will sustain you in a way that you'll be
[42:46] able to say bless the Lord O my soul and
[42:48] all of it soon within me because I can
[42:50] see that the Lord answers prayer
[42:55] that's the God we serve
[42:58] I know many times we want to see a great
[43:01] sermon preached
[43:03] but you know really that sermon is
[43:06] totally dependent on the people
[43:10] we could be as most prepared
[43:12] as as as we could ever be and come
[43:16] and it's a complete fight
[43:18] just a struggle just like wading through
[43:20] a swamp up to your waist all the way
[43:24] from from the end of the song service
[43:26] right to the very last word that sung in
[43:29] the last song just a slug to get through
[43:31] it why because there's differences in
[43:34] ideas differences in thoughts
[43:36] differences in beliefs people with ought
[43:38] this that this that but if we can come
[43:42] in unity of spirit and just push aside
[43:44] all of the garbage all the nonsense is
[43:46] what brother Branham says if we can just
[43:48] quit all the nonsense and just see God
[43:50] move in our in our Lives who knows what
[43:53] could happen brothers and sisters
[43:56] remember we talked about the quote that
[43:58] brother Branham said
[43:59] and you'd be able to find it based on
[44:01] this one one name
[44:05] he said I'd invite any Spirit to walk
[44:08] through the door
[44:10] from any Joe Lewis
[44:12] if you look up that word Joe Lewis I
[44:15] believe is what it is he challenged any
[44:18] spirit that would walk through that door
[44:19] to a group of believers who truly
[44:22] believe the word for their day
[44:24] who truly are filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:26] in one mind and one Accord in unity of
[44:29] spirit endeavoring to keep the bond of
[44:31] Peace not just saying we just rub
[44:33] shoulders and we've got the bond of
[44:35] Peace no but endeavoring to keep the
[44:36] bond of Peace somebody offended me and
[44:38] I'm not going to let Satan get between
[44:39] us I'm going to run to him and say
[44:41] brother you said this and I feel that
[44:43] can we just make it right somehow
[44:46] endeavoring to keep the unity of spirit
[44:49] that environment brother Bradham said
[44:52] you could challenge any Spirit to come
[44:54] through that door anybody with any
[44:56] disease Bring It On come through that
[44:57] door and just by the entrance of that
[44:59] person into the group they would be
[45:02] healed in the name of Jesus Christ could
[45:03] you imagine that brothers and sisters
[45:06] that's exactly the message for our day
[45:09] that's where we live that's the power of
[45:11] Christ Living out through the Believers
[45:15] and that's the one that came and sat
[45:18] down and sat beside that woman at the
[45:19] well that day and told her the things
[45:22] that she had done
[45:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[45:26] forever brothers and sisters when we
[45:27] hear the word preached in season when we
[45:30] hear the word of God preached by the
[45:33] prophet for our day
[45:35] and we we speak those words it's the
[45:38] same one it's Jesus Christ coming and
[45:41] sitting down with us once again if you
[45:43] could imagine we could we could put it
[45:45] up on the leg and get brother Logan to
[45:47] just bring up a picture here I'm not
[45:48] saying do it but we could if you could
[45:50] Envision it a well
[45:52] and and and a picture of Jesus coming
[45:55] and sitting we could even do a little
[45:56] actual waterfall here and and then
[45:59] visualize Jesus Christ the same
[46:02] yesterday today and forever coming and
[46:04] sitting down
[46:05] and fellowshipping with us
[46:09] you know
[46:10] we have the power to pull on the gift
[46:12] doesn't matter who's preaching
[46:14] we have the power to pull on the gift to
[46:17] get that excuse me that gift to bring
[46:19] the sermon right off their notes and go
[46:21] right off the main trail and go right on
[46:24] the back road deal with exactly what's
[46:26] on our hearts if we have the ability to
[46:30] surrender to God we can totally have the
[46:33] minister Minister directly to our need
[46:36] because brothers and sisters this isn't
[46:38] play time here this isn't coming to
[46:40] church and hoping that brother Berry has
[46:42] something to say we should be hoping
[46:44] that the Lord Jesus Christ is going to
[46:46] come and sit down by my well today and
[46:48] speak to me sovereignly about my exact
[46:51] need
[46:53] and if we don't see it that way then
[46:55] brothers and sisters I think that maybe
[46:56] we should just consider why would we
[46:58] bother coming to church
[47:01] it needs to be that personal
[47:05] he wants to minister to us he wants to
[47:07] speak to us
[47:09] he wants to give us the ability to rise
[47:13] remember we read that quote that he's
[47:15] just waiting for the church in the last
[47:17] days to rise and accept what he's
[47:21] already done for us he's given us the
[47:24] ability to overcome Satan he's given us
[47:26] the ability to thwart Satan exactly the
[47:29] same way as thwarted as he was in the
[47:31] desert with Jesus when he came to tempt
[47:34] Jesus we could be so hidden in Christ
[47:37] that Satan can't even find us
[47:39] we can be so hidden in Christ so
[47:42] consumed by the word so saturated with
[47:45] the word for our day that even when he
[47:47] does find us he doesn't know what to do
[47:49] with us
[47:50] because we speak the word so strongly to
[47:53] him we might not yell it
[47:56] and I'm not getting crazy because I'm
[47:57] screaming I'm getting crazy I'm
[47:59] screaming because I'm excited to think
[48:01] that we have the ability to be there
[48:06] to be able to discern and withstand that
[48:08] Antichrist spirit that would creep into
[48:10] the Christian Church into the framework
[48:12] of the Christian church
[48:14] right and try and defile it and make it
[48:16] lukewarm and formal and Powerless
[48:21] Mark 16 in action is the true church the
[48:23] only one that he claims has his own and
[48:25] all else is false it's true it's real
[48:27] but I'm not here to judge who is and who
[48:30] isn't I'm only here to encourage
[48:33] I only want to see everybody come to
[48:35] that place
[48:37] I want to see it in my own life
[48:40] I want to be a part of that true church
[48:43] but we know that prophet of Malachi 4
[48:45] he's come for a purpose and that's to
[48:47] restore all things back
[48:49] to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[48:53] faith of the apostolic church that we've
[48:56] talked about that church
[48:59] that people wanted to actually come to
[49:03] where they would actually just ask can
[49:06] we give you a handkerchief
[49:07] and can you just place it on your body
[49:09] can you just touch that handkerchief to
[49:12] you and and then give it back to me so I
[49:14] can take it home and put it on my sick
[49:15] grandmother so she might live or my
[49:18] husband so he might live so he might
[49:20] rise up
[49:21] can you just position me so that when
[49:24] when brother so and so walks down the
[49:26] street that his shadow would just pass
[49:28] over me because if his shadow passed
[49:30] over me I know that I would be healed
[49:32] because he's so full of the holy spirit
[49:34] in his life
[49:36] brothers and sisters we're talking about
[49:38] that church we're not talking about the
[49:40] the Pentecostal fathers the Azusa Street
[49:42] Revival we're not talking about the
[49:44] natural theology here we're talking
[49:46] about spiritual theology the one that's
[49:49] given by Revelation and Revelation only
[49:53] the one that the Gates of Hell will
[49:55] never Prevail against
[49:57] that's what we're talking about
[50:00] that church
[50:02] he said to restore back again to bring
[50:04] back in the last days these great things
[50:08] that he's promised he'd bring the
[50:11] Revelation what is he to do Malachi 4
[50:14] was to bring back the faith of the
[50:16] fathers to the children see that's right
[50:20] to bring the same thing the same Pillar
[50:23] of Fire on the scene
[50:26] the same signs
[50:27] the same wonders
[50:29] the same Jesus making him the same
[50:33] I just love this part
[50:35] I just love this part so much I'm not
[50:38] going to keep us late today I'll call
[50:39] the musicians now I know that we're 10
[50:41] minutes too we're going to have service
[50:43] tonight
[50:44] I want to be careful to not weary
[50:46] everyone and I know some people would
[50:48] say why don't you go for another hour
[50:49] and I mean we just want to want to be
[50:52] gentle with the people
[50:55] the same Pillar of Fire on the scene the
[50:58] same signs
[51:00] the same wonders
[51:02] the same Jesus
[51:06] making him the same
[51:08] preaching him the same
[51:12] vindicating him the same
[51:15] yesterday today and forever
[51:19] excuse me
[51:21] I will restore saith the Lord
[51:23] all the years that the Methodist worm
[51:27] the caterpillar worm and the Baptist and
[51:29] the Catholic and all them worms eating
[51:33] that
[51:35] eating that Faith down to become a
[51:38] denominational stump
[51:41] where there's no seed left in there
[51:44] brothers and sisters it can become that
[51:46] way in our lives if we're not careful we
[51:49] can become a denominational stump
[51:51] because we take what we hear and and we
[51:55] want to try and run it through our
[51:57] theology
[51:58] don't try and make the message of the
[52:00] hour theology
[52:02] it's not studied it's revealed
[52:07] it's probably the easiest way to word it
[52:09] it's not studied it's revealed
[52:13] but when it's revealed brothers and
[52:15] sisters and we hear the message of the
[52:17] hour preached when we hear the message
[52:20] of the hour played
[52:23] something happens
[52:24] it's a supernatural happening
[52:27] that Revelation it just comes
[52:29] supernaturally and you know what
[52:31] brothers and sisters the gates of hell
[52:32] can't Prevail against it and you know
[52:34] how
[52:34] because once you truly receive the
[52:36] baptism of the holy spirit in your life
[52:38] there ain't nobody that's ever going to
[52:40] talk you out of it ever
[52:42] ever
[52:43] excuse me
[52:45] stand with me this morning there's no
[52:47] person there's no church
[52:50] there's no sign there's no wonder
[52:53] they can come around and try and tell
[52:55] you we've got something greater we've
[52:58] got something better
[52:59] because you know that you found the
[53:01] pearl of great price
[53:05] he says in all them's worms eating
[53:07] eating that
[53:09] that Faith down to become a
[53:11] denominational stump where there's no
[53:13] seed left in there
[53:15] but I will restore again saith the Lord
[53:18] all the years what
[53:21] all the signs and wonders that they have
[53:24] forsaken
[53:25] that all of the churches have forsaken
[53:28] same thing with this woman at the well
[53:31] he came and told her that I'll restore
[53:35] everything that every one of those men
[53:36] in your life
[53:38] took away from you
[53:40] I will restore it all of the faith
[53:44] that all of those men
[53:47] that you gave to I will give you that
[53:49] back
[53:52] all the signs and wonders that they have
[53:54] forsaken I'll take it right back to that
[53:57] original tree again
[53:59] and I will restore it saith the Lord
[54:01] that prophet
[54:04] has a Vindicated Prophet that Prophet
[54:06] was a Vindicated prophet
[54:09] his words
[54:10] has come to pass amen
[54:13] let's just bow
[54:16] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as
[54:19] we go forwards today we just want to be
[54:22] thankful for what you've given us
[54:24] we do not want to take it for granted
[54:26] Lord to be able to hear the message of
[54:28] the Yahweh
[54:29] Lord to know that you
[54:32] not only will restore but you have
[54:34] restored
[54:35] all the years that have been taken away
[54:38] from us
[54:40] and Lord Jesus how many of us are just
[54:43] like that woman at the well
[54:45] father who who who who at one time in
[54:48] their lives they had faith in someone
[54:49] really important
[54:52] and found that that person let them down
[54:55] and maybe they had faith in someone else
[54:57] and found that that person let them down
[55:01] but Lord Jesus that day when you come
[55:04] when you came on the scene and made
[55:07] yourself known to the individual
[55:09] personally Lord my
[55:12] father I pray that we could just accept
[55:15] you as you are
[55:16] and not try and run you through our
[55:18] theology
[55:20] but to just take you in the fullness of
[55:23] the Revelation for our day
[55:25] Lord I pray that you would bless the
[55:27] words that were spoken today I pray that
[55:29] you would just be with each one father
[55:30] be with each need Lord help us father to
[55:34] tarry one for another that when we come
[55:35] to the communion table we don't eat and
[55:37] drink damnation to ourselves and Lord
[55:39] Jesus I pray that it would just be
[55:41] something that we can't wait to do is
[55:43] come to the communion table
[55:45] because we know that we're following
[55:47] your word for our day
[55:49] Lord we just ask that you would continue
[55:51] watching over your children keep your
[55:53] hand upon each one of us and if it Be
[55:55] Your Will father for us to to have a
[55:57] musician's practice today and to have a
[55:59] service again tonight we pray that you
[56:01] would be with brother Toby that you
[56:02] would just give him a fresh call off the
[56:04] altar Lord that we would have the desire
[56:06] in our hearts to pull upon the gift Lord
[56:08] Jesus to just see what you have to say
[56:11] to us today
[56:12] we just ask all these things now in
[56:14] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[56:19] can we sing 2186
