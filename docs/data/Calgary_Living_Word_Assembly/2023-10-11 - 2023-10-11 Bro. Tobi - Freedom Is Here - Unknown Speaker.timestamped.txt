[29:33] 12 and Pharaoh rose up in the night he
[29:37] and all the servants and all the
[29:39] Egyptians and there was a great cry in
[29:42] Egypt for there was not a house where
[29:44] there was not one dead we know this was
[29:47] the story of God bringing Deliverance to
[29:50] the people of
[29:52] Israel verse 31 and he called for Moses
[29:55] and Aaron by night and said rise up up
[29:57] and get you forth from among my people

[30:12] also the Egyptians were urgent upon the
[30:16] people that they might send them out of
[30:17] the land in haste for they said we be
[30:20] all dead men and the people took their
[30:23] door before it was leavened their
[30:26] needing troughs being bound up in their
[30:28] clothes and upon their
[30:30] shoulders and the children of Israel did
[30:33] according to the word of the Lord and
[30:35] they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of
[30:38] silver and jewels of gold and rainment
[30:41] and the lord gave the people favor in
[30:43] the side of the Egyptians so that they
[30:45] lent unto them such things as they
[30:47] required and they spoiled the Egyptians

[31:59] possession amen the Lord bless the
[32:01] reading of his word tonight in Jesus
[32:02] Christ's name for a title tonight I want
[32:06] to bring a declaration to you that
[32:09] freedom is here so that's my title
[32:12] tonight freedom is here we know this is
[32:15] the story of the children of Israel but
[32:18] way before this time God had made a
[32:20] covenant to Abraham the father of the
[32:23] Jews and many other nations the father
[32:26] of many Nation Nations and when God made
[32:28] this Covenant to
[32:30] Abraham God told him that his people
[32:33] were going to sourn in a Strange Land
[32:36] for 400 years and he said after 400
[32:39] years he was going to bring them out and
[32:41] the lord gave enough detail to make
[32:44] Abraham know that the people that will
[32:47] oppress God's people the Seed of Abraham
[32:50] God was going to punish
[32:53] them and brother br will say to us in
[32:55] the message at Kadesh B here he said now
[32:58] this Covenant People Israel down in
[33:01] Egypt on account of
[33:04] Disobedience and of selling their
[33:06] brother Joseph and was taken down into
[33:09] Egypt and there was 400 years under
[33:13] bondage he said I want you to
[33:16] notice they never lost their Covenant
[33:20] amen they lost their
[33:23] freedom not their Covenant Hallelujah
[33:26] I'll just PA a little bit and speak to
[33:28] you for a moment here brothers and
[33:30] sisters that regardless of what is
[33:33] happening in your
[33:34] life remember you have not lost the
[33:37] Covenant amen you might have lost your
[33:40] freedom but you've not lost your
[33:42] Covenant you might have lost the joy of
[33:44] your salvation David once said Lord
[33:47] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[33:50] but it could only say that because he
[33:52] realized that he had a covenant and he
[33:55] had not lost that Covenant amen amen
[33:59] Jesus Christ said all that the father
[34:00] has given unto me he said they shall
[34:03] come unto me and he that cometh I will
[34:06] in no wise cast out he said no man can
[34:09] pluck them out of my hands he said
[34:12] because the father that gave them to me
[34:14] he is greater than all
[34:17] amen have you lost your
[34:20] Victory remember you have not lost the
[34:24] Covenant you know the almighty God
[34:27] decided to show
[34:30] John a revelation of Jesus Christ
[34:34] himself really grateful that our pastor
[34:37] is taken that teaching sorry to
[34:39] interrupt it
[34:40] tonight but I believe that's how the
[34:42] Lord ordained it amen that's right but
[34:45] he said in Revelation 12 he said and I
[34:47] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[34:49] is come salvation and strength and the
[34:52] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[34:53] Christ for the accuser of our brethren
[34:56] and is cast down which accused them
[34:59] before our God day and night and they
[35:00] overcame him not will overcome him but
[35:04] they already overcame him by what by the
[35:07] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[35:10] their
[35:12] testimony you are already an overcomer
[35:15] amen said they love not their lives even
[35:18] unto death she've lost your health
[35:21] remember you've not lost the
[35:23] Covenant he said I am the Lord your God
[35:25] that health all your diseases amen he
[35:29] also told you that he was wounded for
[35:31] your transgression he was
[35:33] bruised for your iniquity the
[35:35] chastisement of your peace was upon him
[35:40] and by his tribes you were healed
[35:42] brother brah told of a story of someone
[35:45] who was sick and a little boy was
[35:47] admonishing him like when you read the
[35:50] scripture just read it the way my mother
[35:51] used to read it put your name in there
[35:54] why because you are part of that coven
[36:00] now let me tell you something about this
[36:03] Covenant number one it is unconditional
[36:07] amen what does that mean it has nothing
[36:10] to do with what you
[36:12] did what you could do or what you will
[36:16] ever do it has nothing to do with you
[36:20] this Covenant is a sworn Covenant the
[36:24] Bible said that because God could swear
[36:26] by no no greater God looked around he
[36:29] wanted to confirm this Covenant unto
[36:31] Abraham he wanted to seal that Covenant
[36:34] he wanted to make that Covenant be a
[36:37] type of Covenant that cannot be
[36:40] broken he wanted to take
[36:43] it a step higher from the level of a
[36:48] promise to an
[36:50] oath and because there was no other
[36:53] person that God could swear by God swore
[36:56] by himself self so you've got a swan
[36:59] Covenant that is signed by God
[37:01] himself this Covenant was before the
[37:04] foundation of the
[37:06] world he said the lamb was slain before
[37:10] the world
[37:11] began and as we heard that brother Paul
[37:13] preached the other time this Covenant is
[37:16] a covenant by
[37:21] Blood it was a covenant by Blood
[37:23] something had to die in this case God
[37:27] himself had to die that's right so we're
[37:31] saying the people of Israel they might
[37:33] have lost their freedom but they never
[37:35] lost their Covenant Abraham went ahead
[37:38] to say when God made the Covenant with
[37:40] Abraham Isaac and Jacob that he swore by
[37:42] himself that he will save Abraham and he
[37:44] seed after him God is Duty bound to keep
[37:48] that promise and as his just Duty bound
[37:51] to you and sorry and he is just as Duty
[37:53] bound to you on that promise as it was
[37:56] to Abraham on the promise that's right
[37:58] if you are Abraham's seed how many of us
[38:00] are Abraham seed tonight if you are
[38:02] Abraham's seed says the Bible and hears
[38:06] according to the promise then God is
[38:09] just as Duty bound to you as he what to
[38:13] Abraham amen said that will take all the
[38:15] scare out of it God don't want you to be
[38:18] scared of
[38:20] nothing he doesn't want you to be scared
[38:22] of nothing what does he want you to do
[38:25] he wants you to rest
[38:28] solemnly upon what he said because God
[38:31] cannot fail so it took 500 years from
[38:35] the time that God made that promise to
[38:39] Abraham until the time that Moses was
[38:42] born 500 years God didn't even do
[38:45] anything about it was just laying there
[38:47] oh my goodness God is said I am the Lord
[38:50] that watched over my word to perform it
[38:54] sometimes there might be a huge gap in
[38:56] between s but God is watching is acting
[38:59] it looks like he's not doing anything
[39:01] but God is doing something don't look at
[39:03] what you see know that when God makes a
[39:06] promise God is able to fulfill it you
[39:09] believe that tonight say
[39:13] Amen so Moses was called by
[39:16] God at the age of
[39:19] 80 and it was at the time that he had
[39:22] run away from
[39:24] God it was a time that it was aware of
[39:27] his calling but he tried to do it by
[39:30] himself and he
[39:31] failed
[39:35] miserably but God knew that the time was
[39:38] not
[39:39] yet and God also knew that he wanted to
[39:42] work on that man to take the man to a
[39:46] place where the man becomes dependent on
[39:49] God himself and not him and not not
[39:52] himself as a
[39:54] man we never heard about
[39:57] Moses's
[39:59] flaws the first 80 years of his life we
[40:03] heard he was a prince where he was so
[40:06] bold he understood what he was supposed
[40:08] to be a deliverer and he was bold enough
[40:11] to kill an Egyptians for the sake of an
[40:15] Israelite but by the time God started to
[40:17] deal with
[40:19] him by the time God appeared to him when
[40:22] he was 80 years and God gave him the
[40:24] commission to go deliver the children of
[40:26] of Israel we started to see Moses had
[40:29] gone to a stage where he had already
[40:31] become
[40:32] broken and he said Lord I'm just a
[40:35] stammer I'm not even and and we know
[40:38] that Moses was
[40:39] educated Moses had the best that was
[40:42] available at that time because it was a
[40:44] prince of the most powerful nation in
[40:46] the
[40:49] world and God told
[40:51] him go tell Pharaoh my people have got
[40:55] to be freed
[40:57] and Moses was wondering because Moses
[40:59] also knew that when he goes to the
[41:02] children of Israel number one maybe most
[41:03] of the people that knew him would have
[41:05] died because he was an 80y old man maybe
[41:08] many of them would not remember him
[41:09] anymore there's so many people and it
[41:12] was not even that popular no one really
[41:15] wanted
[41:16] him when he was in Egypt so Moses also
[41:20] then asked God because wherever deity is
[41:24] there has to be the supernatural
[41:27] he said the people are not going to
[41:29] believe me and then God said I'll give
[41:31] you two signs I'll give you a
[41:33] supernatural sign two Supernatural signs
[41:37] that will confirm to the people that I
[41:39] am the one that sent
[41:41] you so let's imagine Moses traveled
[41:44] finally God told him you will be God
[41:47] unto un unto pharaoh and Aaron will be
[41:51] your prophet and then Moses traveled and
[41:54] then he got there now the people were a
[41:56] bad
[41:57] State you know none of us has an
[42:00] experience of knowing what it means to
[42:02] be a
[42:03] slave a slave is owned by the master is
[42:08] it's it's worse than you owning your
[42:11] pets because many times you give your
[42:13] pets you know good treatments you allow
[42:16] your pets to to to have food when they
[42:18] are supposed to have food you take them
[42:19] to the doctor for for for for to the
[42:22] veterinary doctor for treatment you take
[42:24] good care of them slaves were not taking
[42:25] care of like
[42:27] that the slaves had no will of
[42:33] themselves the slaves they they they
[42:37] didn't they couldn't wake up in the
[42:38] morning and say this is what my day was
[42:40] going to be
[42:41] like because they had to do what the
[42:43] master
[42:44] willed and we know that that is in the
[42:47] natural but today in the spiritual there
[42:50] are also slaves I think about people who
[42:53] are addicted to certain habits like
[42:55] smoking is getting into winter now it's
[42:57] going to get cold whilst you're in
[43:00] inside the house inside your office
[43:02] trying to keep warm you're going to see
[43:04] that smoker man or smoker lady come out
[43:07] in the cold to
[43:08] smoke why they're under a
[43:11] bondage they are slaves to that demon
[43:14] and regardless of how much they tell
[43:16] that demon no it's it's cold I can't go
[43:18] outside the Demon's going to tell them
[43:19] it's not your will you have to do my
[43:21] will so the people of Israel were in
[43:24] that state and I could imagine more
[43:26] Moses arriving there and telling them
[43:29] you know what I have a commission from
[43:31] God remember Moses said to them sorry
[43:34] Moses said to God that if they don't
[43:36] believe me what will happen so imagine
[43:38] that the manifestation of the
[43:40] supernatural was first done to the
[43:42] children of Israel to convince them that
[43:44] God had sent
[43:47] Moses and the word on the streets will
[43:50] have been freedom is here
[43:53] hallelujah but we know it was going to
[43:55] take a lot
[43:56] it was going to take 10 different
[44:00] plagues before Pharaoh we finally get to
[44:03] that point of saying okay I'm done with
[44:07] you guys you can
[44:09] go but where we first read in Exodus was
[44:12] the
[44:13] night where that freedom was about to be
[44:16] declared brother Brown will give us an
[44:18] illustration he did that in the few
[44:20] messages where it will say that the
[44:22] first born will come to the father
[44:25] because this meant a lot to them
[44:27] remember that a death angel was going to
[44:30] go through the land and kill all the
[44:32] first bores whether it be of humans or
[44:34] of
[44:36] animals and the first one will go to the
[44:38] dad and say
[44:39] Daddy I just heard them crying in the
[44:42] other house they're Egyptians the
[44:45] firstborn has just died they lost the
[44:47] firstborn of their pets as well Daddy
[44:50] what about me you know I'm your
[44:52] firstborn and the father will say don't
[44:56] worry son I have applied the blood I
[45:00] have done what I am meant to do Jehovah
[45:03] made us a promise that if we will apply
[45:06] the blood then the that angel is going
[45:08] to pass over us and finally that
[45:12] happened all the Egyptians and those
[45:14] that failed to apply the
[45:16] blood they lost their first bones in
[45:19] their houses whether I be animals or I
[45:21] was humans and then Pharaoh said now you
[45:26] can
[45:27] go and that was a declaration of
[45:31] Freedom now we read in Leviticus 25 as
[45:34] well the Lord J the Lord God told them
[45:38] he said that they should count seven
[45:41] Sabbath years so Sabbath is seven um the
[45:44] Sabbath is seven days normally like the
[45:47] land of Israel they will have what they
[45:48] call the Shabbat which is the seventh
[45:50] day but God was telling them given that
[45:52] law to Moses that they should have seven
[45:56] Sabbath years so 7 * 7
[46:01] is 49 there you go nice to have the
[46:05] young little ones right in front here
[46:07] they can answer our questions for
[46:10] us brother the Paul put them to work got
[46:12] them to read the Bible it was Elias you
[46:14] did a good job Elias God bless
[46:17] you say it's 49 years and on the 50th
[46:21] year there was supposed to be a
[46:23] declaration of Jubilee
[46:27] now in the land of Israel this is way
[46:29] after they had gone into the promised
[46:31] land they also had slaves so what could
[46:35] happen a situation could arise where
[46:37] someone will borrow something from a
[46:39] family will borrow from another family
[46:42] and then they are not able to pay back
[46:45] and because they cannot pay back they
[46:47] have to give their daughter or their son
[46:49] to be a slave to this other family but
[46:52] God made a provision and we can go into
[46:54] the details of why God did that because
[46:56] if you look at this as well this had to
[46:58] also do with the
[47:00] inheritance God wanting to keep the
[47:02] inheritance God gave all the tribes
[47:04] their inheritance and God wanted to keep
[47:07] that inheritance God wanted to keep the
[47:09] people with the way they were but this
[47:11] was also god making them understand that
[47:13] a time of Freedom was supposed to come
[47:15] for everyone that was being
[47:19] enslaved now God told
[47:22] him every man that is a slave from the
[47:25] land of Israel on that 50th year you
[47:29] have to proclaim a
[47:31] jubilee and then there has to be a
[47:34] trumpet that has to
[47:36] sound and regardless of what that slave
[47:39] was doing at that time it might have
[47:41] been on the plantation of the master
[47:44] with the hole and farming and doing all
[47:46] of that as soon as he hears the trumpet
[47:49] the Jubilee trumpet he has the right to
[47:52] drop it and say I am now a free man
[47:56] amenallah
[48:00] and we see in the book of jorges as
[48:03] well most of the time the people will
[48:05] sin against God God will deliver them
[48:08] over to their enemies but God always
[48:10] brought a
[48:11] freedom now what am I saying
[48:15] tonight there is also a situation that
[48:18] God gave in in the book of
[48:21] Deuteronomy we a
[48:24] master
[48:26] could obey the instruction that God gave
[48:29] at the sound of the trumpet the Jubilee
[48:33] trumpet and then the slave could say I
[48:36] have had so much fun with my
[48:38] master I Don't Want to Be Free
[48:41] Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 1516 to17 said
[48:45] and it shall be if he shall say unto
[48:48] thee I will not go away from thee
[48:50] because he loveth thee and thine house
[48:53] because he is well with thee then shall
[48:56] thou take an all and thrust it through
[48:59] his ha onto the door and it shall be thy
[49:02] servant forever and also unto thy mid
[49:05] Heaven Thou shalt do likewise why
[49:07] because God knows that a
[49:10] pardon is not a
[49:12] pardon until it is accepted as a pardon
[49:17] but the Braham was the one that said
[49:18] this to us but Braham told a story that
[49:21] he read and you can see several times
[49:22] you know brother Braham narrated that
[49:25] story in different ways and and because
[49:28] it was something that he read he would
[49:30] have you know at that moment brought out
[49:32] as much as he retained in his memory but
[49:36] brother Braham the one I want to talk
[49:37] about was brother Braham actually
[49:38] explained that this story was about um
[49:42] was he read it in in the book that had
[49:44] to do with the life of Abraham
[49:46] Lincoln so he said there was a man who
[49:49] was in the
[49:51] Army
[49:52] and at that time if you're enlisted said
[49:55] into the army as long as you you know
[49:58] voluntarily said you're going to do it
[50:00] you're not allowed to run away you're
[50:02] not allowed to flee so this man was in
[50:05] the Army the went to war started to hear
[50:07] you know the sound of the ammunation and
[50:09] the GS and all of that and then he
[50:13] fled and the penalty for that was that
[50:16] he was supposed to die by the firing
[50:18] Court he was supposed to be
[50:20] killed and then his friend knowing that
[50:23] this man had been arrested had been
[50:24] tried and was going to be killed found
[50:26] an audience with Abraham
[50:29] Lincoln and said Abraham Lincoln I know
[50:31] you are a
[50:32] Christian Mr President this boy is a
[50:35] good boy he didn't mean to do it he was
[50:39] just afraid when he started to hear all
[50:41] the noise the the the the the the the
[50:44] sound of of of the guns and and and the
[50:46] bombs and all of that and he and he ran
[50:48] away please just just have mercy upon
[50:51] him at the least let him be in prison
[50:54] but don't let him be killed K and
[50:56] Abraham Lincoln being being a Christian
[50:59] he felt pity for the man but Abraham
[51:01] Lincoln was just in his courage about to
[51:03] go into a hotel so he did not have his
[51:06] his
[51:07] presidential um letter head and and and
[51:10] the seal and all of those things so he
[51:12] just took a simple piece of
[51:15] paper simple piece of paper and wrote
[51:19] this man is pardoned and signed Abraham
[51:22] Lincoln and this man's friend was so
[51:24] excited and he got this piece of paper
[51:27] and he ran to the prison and went to his
[51:30] friend and said hey I've got the pardon
[51:32] from the president you can now go
[51:36] free and his friend looked at the
[51:39] package his friend looked at the piece
[51:42] of paper his friend failed to look at
[51:45] the signature of the president he looked
[51:48] at the packet that was carrying his
[51:51] pardon and because it did not look like
[51:53] what he expected
[51:56] he said you're just here to mock me go
[51:59] away and his friend pleaded with him
[52:01] this is real this is a orinal this is
[52:04] from the president look at the signature
[52:07] and he kept saying no you're here to
[52:08] mock me go away I know I'm going to be
[52:11] killed by the next
[52:13] morning and by the next morning he was
[52:17] killed at the firing court so the case
[52:20] came to the Supreme
[52:22] Court and the questions were asked
[52:26] will the president give the pardon yes
[52:29] did the president sign the pardon yes so
[52:32] why was the man killed and they said the
[52:34] pardon is not a pardon until it is
[52:38] accepted as a
[52:41] pardon brother Braham told
[52:44] us about a dream that he had he said he
[52:47] doesn't dream that often was a prophet
[52:50] he saw many Vision hundreds of thousands
[52:53] of them but not so much of a dreamer but
[52:57] in this dream I remember a pastor was
[52:59] referring to this
[53:01] recently he said um I'll just kind of
[53:05] read it quickly how we doing with time
[53:07] very good he said he had a dream the
[53:08] other morning he said I don't dream very
[53:10] often but I'm not a dreamer but I dream
[53:12] I sent a man a young fellow in shackles
[53:14] and he was trying to get out somebody
[53:17] told me those are horrible people don't
[53:20] have nothing to do with them and I see
[53:22] this young fellow getting out of his
[53:23] shackles so I just let him alone I
[53:26] thought I just see what he does so when
[53:28] he got out he was a nice fellow and I
[53:30] seen the others trying to get out now
[53:33] this is only a dream and I walked over
[53:35] this way and I seen a brother Roy
[53:37] borders a very good friend of mine lives
[53:39] in California look like there's
[53:41] something wrong his eyes was half closed
[53:44] maybe cancer or something over his eyes
[53:46] and someone was trying to pull me away
[53:49] from him I screamed brother borders in
[53:51] the name of Jesus snap out of that and
[53:54] he just be will speak saying brother
[53:56] Braham it'll have to take something more
[53:59] than this I just can't grasp it brother
[54:02] Braham I just can't grasp it I said
[54:04] brother borders oh I love him and
[54:08] someone pulled me away I looked and it
[54:09] was a lady standing over here that when
[54:12] I was a little boy I used to haul Gres
[54:14] groceries from the grocery store to to
[54:16] the people and the name was Mrs Fenton
[54:19] she lived in Jeffersonville yet a
[54:21] personal friend to the wife and I and
[54:23] she said brother Bram the Del us from
[54:26] this said this is a house of hell and
[54:29] said you've been
[54:31] misunderstood I said you misunderstood
[54:33] these people remember somebody told brah
[54:35] this this this this horrible people
[54:38] don't have nothing to do with them and
[54:40] so this is this woman who was telling
[54:42] brother Braham you have been
[54:43] misunderstood brother Braham and then
[54:45] you have also misunderstood those people
[54:48] these are fine people he said I looked
[54:50] over there a BRI a great big sell or big
[54:53] walls down beneath a great
[54:55] big cave and great iron bars eight or 10
[54:58] inches thick and people out of their
[55:01] mind Twisted arms and legs beating their
[55:04] head like that and she was crying saying
[55:07] deliver the people brother Braham help
[55:09] us we're in trouble she herself I know
[55:13] brother brah said she belonged to the
[55:14] Church of
[55:15] Christ um the Christian church called
[55:17] The Church of the Brethren said I looked
[55:20] around and I said I wish I could and go
[55:23] on looking around my little be body them
[55:25] great big iron bars and those poor
[55:28] people in there and you couldn't get to
[55:30] them them iron bars were sitting close
[55:33] together and I looked and they were
[55:35] beating their head like they were out of
[55:37] their mind and I seen some lights
[55:39] flickering around in there and I looked
[55:41] up and there stood the Lord Jesus with
[55:44] the light of rainbow around him he was
[55:46] looking right straight to me he said
[55:49] deliver those people and it went away
[55:52] and I thought well how can I deliver
[55:54] them I haven't G got strength enough in
[55:58] my arms to break those BS so I said
[56:01] House of Hell give way to the name of
[56:04] Jesus Christ said and all the creaking
[56:07] and popping and rocks rolling and the
[56:09] bars falling and people running
[56:11] screaming
[56:12] delivered and screamed at the top of
[56:15] their voice and was all delivered now
[56:19] brother God gave him the ability to
[56:21] deliver the people that were held out
[56:23] but remember he told us he had a
[56:26] friend the B said and I was screaming
[56:28] then brother borders brother Roy borders
[56:31] where are you where are you God is
[56:34] delivering his people where are you
[56:36] brother borders said I've wondered about
[56:39] that we are in a time that God is
[56:41] delivering his people amen we're in a
[56:44] time where we know that things are
[56:46] wrapping up I know a lot of us probably
[56:49] will be following what is happening in
[56:51] Israel and and in the Gaza street but
[56:54] but that has been unpre
[56:56] unprecedented over the past you know 40
[57:00] 50 years that the the amount of Israelis
[57:04] that have been killed by the
[57:05] Palestinians that has never happened in
[57:07] since
[57:11] 1970s I'm not here to tell you what it
[57:13] means I'm not speculating but we know
[57:16] that this a part of the
[57:18] promises and if Israel is getting to the
[57:20] point where there is a squeeze going on
[57:25] to bring them to the realization that
[57:27] they need the
[57:28] mesiah then you know that God is
[57:30] wrapping up his Gentile bride as
[57:33] well so we're in a time where God is
[57:35] delivering his people young people we're
[57:38] in a time where God is setting young
[57:40] people
[57:42] free we all grew up as young people is
[57:46] when you were young that the devil
[57:47] actually tries to focus a lot on you
[57:51] because he knows the Bible said Remember
[57:53] the Lord your God in the days of of your
[57:55] youth before the evil days come so he
[57:58] tries to get you at that time tries to
[58:00] get you with a spirit of stubbornness he
[58:02] tries to get you with a spirit of
[58:04] self-righteousness he tries to put some
[58:06] habits in your life he tries to put you
[58:08] in a place where you find it difficult
[58:12] to live a true Christian
[58:16] life but this is a time of Freedom so
[58:19] brother Braham remembered his friend now
[58:23] Freedom when we talk about about freedom
[58:26] in terms of Salvation is freedom from
[58:31] sin we all born in sin we're all shaped
[58:36] in iniquity we come to the world
[58:37] speaking lies there Comes A Time as you
[58:40] continue to hear the word of God there's
[58:43] something in you tells you that I need
[58:44] to give my life to
[58:47] Christ the moment you give your life to
[58:50] Christ you are taking a step to move
[58:54] away from bondage into
[58:57] Freedom that's why brother Brown will
[59:00] explain to us
[59:01] that you know when when he had his own
[59:04] experience of giving his life to Christ
[59:06] he he felt a joy of
[59:09] Salvation it was a joy of Salvation
[59:12] there was something my dad always told
[59:14] us the story that um of of when he gave
[59:16] his life to Christ when he was in high
[59:18] school and um his friend had invited him
[59:21] to come listen to an Apostolic Faith um
[59:25] um concert where they were going to sing
[59:27] my dad will always tell us like when
[59:29] he's telling the story said I was a boy
[59:31] as a boy so it was just a sinner
[59:34] boy but his friend told him you know
[59:37] come with me to this Apostolic Faith
[59:40] concert you know it's music it's
[59:41] Christmas time it's going to be music
[59:43] just come
[59:45] listen and my dad said well if you will
[59:47] give me you buy me the banana to eat
[59:49] with my rice during lunch then I'll come
[59:51] with you so we did that because of food
[59:56] but that was his day of
[59:57] salvation and he said he went to the
[1:00:01] concert and of course it did the music
[1:00:03] but there were there was someone that
[1:00:05] came a minister came to to speak to them
[1:00:09] just just give a word of
[1:00:11] exaltation and this Minister just
[1:00:14] literally just told his own life story
[1:00:17] of how he came to Christ and my dad said
[1:00:20] as he was sitting in the audience
[1:00:21] listening to this man he said this man
[1:00:24] was was telling him exactly what is
[1:00:27] going on in his life the man was
[1:00:28] narrating my dad's own life when he was
[1:00:32] describing his own
[1:00:34] life and there was an altar
[1:00:37] call and he said as he approached the
[1:00:40] altar he felt as if he saw a cross
[1:00:43] before
[1:00:45] him and then he felt as if there was a
[1:00:49] burden that he was carrying like a
[1:00:51] backpack that just got cut away and
[1:00:54] rolled away and he said when after the
[1:00:58] service he saw his friend he was still a
[1:01:01] few feet away he jumped into the arms of
[1:01:03] his friend why he had a feeling of
[1:01:07] Freedom my sins are gone we sing that
[1:01:10] song you ask me why I'm happy so I just
[1:01:12] tell you why because my sins are gone
[1:01:16] it's a freedom you realize you're no
[1:01:19] more a slave to
[1:01:23] sin so the first time I actually had
[1:01:26] this message put together and and and
[1:01:28] before I preached it I already preached
[1:01:29] this for um last year some um in in
[1:01:32] mober I was actually wondering like just
[1:01:35] coming closer to our own time so the
[1:01:38] africanamerican slaves when the
[1:01:39] Proclamation was going to be given how
[1:01:43] were they
[1:01:44] feeling these are people that have been
[1:01:46] taken away from where they had called
[1:01:49] home for years and brought into a place
[1:01:52] um where where they they were they were
[1:01:54] made slaves and they had no Freedom they
[1:01:57] didn't know what Freedom was some of
[1:01:59] them were born as
[1:02:00] slaves but then President Abraham
[1:02:04] Lincoln was going to give a
[1:02:07] declaration that they were going to be
[1:02:08] free by the next morning so I did a bit
[1:02:11] of research and I'll read a few things
[1:02:13] to
[1:02:14] you so one of the writers said when
[1:02:17] Lincoln did signed the proclamation on
[1:02:19] January 1 1863 freeing slaves across the
[1:02:23] Confederate territ
[1:02:25] widespread Joy developed through the
[1:02:28] africanamerican community as Frederick
[1:02:31] Douglas described it the scene was wild
[1:02:34] and Grand joy and gladness exhausted all
[1:02:38] forms of expression from shouts of
[1:02:41] praise to Joys and tears said then in
[1:02:46] 1876 reflecting back on the momentous
[1:02:50] moments he said can any colored man or
[1:02:54] for any white man friendly to the
[1:02:56] freedom of all men ever forget the night
[1:02:59] which followed the first day of January
[1:03:03] 1863 when the world was to see if
[1:03:07] Abraham Lincoln will prove to be as good
[1:03:10] as he word as his word said I shall
[1:03:13] never forget that memorable night when
[1:03:16] in a distant City I waited and watched
[1:03:20] at a public meeting with 3,000 others
[1:03:24] not less anxious than myself for the
[1:03:27] Word of Deliverance amen which we have
[1:03:30] heard read today nor shall I ever forget
[1:03:33] the Outburst of joy and Thanksgiving
[1:03:36] that rent the Earth when the lightning
[1:03:39] brought to us the Emancipation
[1:03:43] Proclamation in that happy hour we
[1:03:46] forgot all the lay and forgot all
[1:03:50] tidiness forgot that the president had
[1:03:53] bribed the rebel to lay down their arms
[1:03:56] by a promise to withold the bolt which
[1:03:58] will Smite the slavery system with
[1:04:01] destruction and we were then forth
[1:04:04] willing to allow the president of all
[1:04:06] the latitude of time phology and every
[1:04:10] honorable device that statesmanship
[1:04:14] might require for the achievement of a
[1:04:17] great and beneficient measure of Liberty
[1:04:21] and progress so these people were in a
[1:04:24] where regardless of what they had gone
[1:04:26] through regardless of all the politics
[1:04:28] that might happen that might have
[1:04:30] delayed this Proclamation amen they knew
[1:04:33] that it was just one more night and they
[1:04:36] were going to be
[1:04:38] free someone else talked about how
[1:04:42] this brought mixed emotions because the
[1:04:46] question is the freedom has been offered
[1:04:49] the freedom has been given but what does
[1:04:52] freedom mean to to you what does he mean
[1:04:56] to
[1:04:57] you Christ has died he has given you
[1:05:01] Freedom he said now you can go free but
[1:05:04] what does it mean to
[1:05:06] you they said interviews with historians
[1:05:09] hired during the Depression to record
[1:05:12] the experiences of former slaves show
[1:05:15] the Garment of emotions they
[1:05:18] felt after surrender someone said I can
[1:05:21] remember the Negroes were so happy
[1:05:24] recalled amenti who had been enslaved in
[1:05:28] Mississippi they just rang Bells blowed
[1:05:31] horns and shouted like they were
[1:05:33] crazy then they brought a brand new rope
[1:05:36] and cut it up into little pieces and
[1:05:38] gave everyone a little piece and
[1:05:40] whenever they look at the Rope they
[1:05:41] should remember that they were free from
[1:05:44] bondage
[1:05:46] amen so Lei Prince of Morgan County
[1:05:50] Alaska the Jubilation of
[1:05:52] emancipation meant that I am free as a
[1:05:55] frog because a frog had freedom to jump
[1:05:59] and where it pleases yet many newly
[1:06:03] freed realized that this was a time of
[1:06:06] great
[1:06:07] uncertainty and
[1:06:10] danger to WL boost Freedom meant being
[1:06:14] just like a turtle cautiously picking
[1:06:16] out of the shell to understand the lay
[1:06:20] of the land it is that sense of caution
[1:06:24] that sense of the unknown that shaped
[1:06:25] the experiences of most
[1:06:27] African-Americans when Freedom came
[1:06:30] while many defined Freedom as a chance
[1:06:32] to reunite with King to ensure the
[1:06:34] education of their children and
[1:06:36] themselves never again to experience the
[1:06:37] violence and sexual exploitation that
[1:06:40] was much so much part of the institution
[1:06:42] of Slavery to have the economic where
[1:06:44] will without to provide for their
[1:06:47] families the family's well-being they
[1:06:49] also realize the limit of freedom and
[1:06:52] the vulnerability that accompanied
[1:06:56] emancipation as the daughter of a Freed
[1:06:59] Man explained she said Daddy was so
[1:07:03] proud of freedom but afraid to own
[1:07:08] it so this people were free but there
[1:07:11] was no provision made for their freedom
[1:07:15] so they knew that they were free but
[1:07:17] something else was lacking brother
[1:07:19] Braham told us in the message Paradox he
[1:07:21] said Joshua here is a book it's a book
[1:07:24] of redemption of the Old Testament
[1:07:27] Joshua we will have we have to consider
[1:07:29] it to be that the book of redemption
[1:07:32] because it is redemption has two
[1:07:36] parts Redemption anywhere has two parts
[1:07:39] that it it's out of and into amen it
[1:07:44] takes two parts to make
[1:07:47] Redemption and we see that this people
[1:07:49] though they got their freedom they
[1:07:51] didn't know what to do with it they came
[1:07:54] out of slavery but they didn't know
[1:07:56] where to go to the children of Israel 2
[1:08:00] million people came out of Egypt only
[1:08:03] two of them went in brother Braham said
[1:08:06] Redemption has got what two
[1:08:09] parts there is a coming out of it's good
[1:08:12] to come out of but are you going into
[1:08:15] the promised land it's good to say I've
[1:08:18] given my life to Christ it's good to say
[1:08:20] I'm in the message church it's good to
[1:08:22] say that I'm in the message Mage and
[1:08:24] better than those in the denomination
[1:08:26] but brother Brown will still tell us
[1:08:28] that very simple question that was asked
[1:08:32] in the book of Acts have you received
[1:08:34] the Holy Ghost since you
[1:08:39] believed cuz Redemption is in two parts
[1:08:43] amen Paul told us in Romans
[1:08:46] 6 verse 16 he said know ye not that to
[1:08:49] whom ye yield yourself servants to obey
[1:08:53] is servants ye are to whom ye obey
[1:08:56] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:08:58] obedience unto righteousness but God be
[1:09:01] thank that ye were the Servants of sin
[1:09:03] but ye have obeyed from the heart that
[1:09:06] form of Doctrine which was delivered you
[1:09:09] being made free from sin ye became
[1:09:12] Servants of righteousness said I speak
[1:09:15] after the manner of men because of the
[1:09:16] infirmity of your flesh for as ye have
[1:09:19] yielded your members servants unto
[1:09:22] uncleanliness and to iniquity unto
[1:09:26] iniquity each so now yield your members
[1:09:31] servants to righteousness unto
[1:09:36] Holiness we came out of slavery of sin
[1:09:39] but is making us Servants of Christ
[1:09:42] where once we lived Our Lives to please
[1:09:44] the enemy to please Satan to do that
[1:09:47] thing that he wanted you to do but when
[1:09:49] you come out of it there is a going into
[1:09:52] that is what Redemption is Redemption is
[1:09:55] taking it back to his rightful position
[1:09:57] coming back to the African-American
[1:09:59] slaves some of them brother did give a
[1:10:01] description of one of
[1:10:03] them who was a prince in his
[1:10:06] homeland and being a prince in Africa he
[1:10:09] had all that he desired to have
[1:10:12] everything that he wanted to have he
[1:10:13] could have it at fingertips he probably
[1:10:15] had servants but then he was made a
[1:10:18] slave now to redeem him Freedom was not
[1:10:23] enough
[1:10:25] Redemption is not just
[1:10:27] Freedom that is the coming out there has
[1:10:29] to be going in he has to be restored
[1:10:32] back to his wealth amen and that's
[1:10:35] exactly what God did God did not just
[1:10:37] bring us what I'm trying to say brothers
[1:10:39] and sisters tonight is God did not just
[1:10:41] bring us out of sin he made a provision
[1:10:44] for our freedom so that we can go
[1:10:49] in brother raham said in total
[1:10:51] Deliverance he said when God sends a man
[1:10:53] to to do anything he completely equips
[1:10:56] him with everything that he has need of
[1:10:59] if he calls a man to be a preacher it
[1:11:01] puts something in him to preach with if
[1:11:04] he calls him to be a teacher it puts
[1:11:07] something in him to teach with if he
[1:11:09] calls him to be a prophet he puts
[1:11:11] something in him to see visions and to
[1:11:13] be a prophet God always completely
[1:11:17] equips his men said just like if you
[1:11:20] were a Christian God Don't Make Halfway
[1:11:23] Christian
[1:11:25] God makes complete Christians God Don't
[1:11:27] Make halfway preachers but the preacher
[1:11:30] can be halfway Lord help me not to be
[1:11:32] halfway I was thinking about it if I
[1:11:34] know there's something that can help the
[1:11:36] people why should I hold it back because
[1:11:39] I think of how people will
[1:11:42] feel Paul
[1:11:44] said then I should not be a servant of
[1:11:50] Christ but Abraham said God Don't Make
[1:11:53] halfway preach preachers preachers can
[1:11:55] be halfway and God makes his children
[1:11:58] Christians but sometimes they are
[1:12:00] Halfway
[1:12:02] Christian but it's not God's intention
[1:12:04] for them to be that way it's their own
[1:12:07] ways got mixed up with a plan of God for
[1:12:10] their
[1:12:11] life and that's what makes them the way
[1:12:13] they are God don't want them to be
[1:12:16] halfway Christians or halfway preachers
[1:12:19] compromising on either side he wants
[1:12:21] them to completely stand in the bridge
[1:12:24] and brothers and sisters if there's
[1:12:27] anyone of us that is in that state I
[1:12:29] don't know if anyone is here but I've
[1:12:30] seen many
[1:12:32] people in in my journey over you know
[1:12:35] the years I've been growing up in the
[1:12:37] message that actually has the question
[1:12:40] of whether they have the Holy Ghost or
[1:12:42] not it's not something to put in the
[1:12:44] back
[1:12:45] burner right right we've got to make
[1:12:49] sure we've got to make certain that we
[1:12:51] have received the Holy Ghost since we
[1:12:55] believed because you have said you've
[1:12:58] accepted the message does not mean
[1:13:00] you've received the Holy Ghost I know
[1:13:02] there's a quote that sounds like
[1:13:04] that and I have it here I may not have
[1:13:07] the time to read it I want us to finish
[1:13:09] very quickly I know there's a quote that
[1:13:12] sounds like that but let me explain what
[1:13:15] brother Braham was saying brother Braham
[1:13:18] initially talked about the evidence of
[1:13:21] the Holy
[1:13:22] Ghost and he said the evidence of the
[1:13:24] Holy Ghost he literarily just said is
[1:13:26] the fruits of the
[1:13:29] spirit and then as God took him on he
[1:13:32] got to a point where God showed him the
[1:13:35] dream to realize that the rain falls on
[1:13:37] the just and the
[1:13:39] unjust and that's when brother Braham
[1:13:41] said that you can have the Holy Spirit
[1:13:43] all the days of your life and still go
[1:13:45] to hell brother Braham was not talking
[1:13:48] about the conversion of the Soul Brother
[1:13:51] Braham was talking about the anointing
[1:13:52] of the Hool holy spirit that can come
[1:13:55] upon a man and make that man to live a
[1:13:58] good life it will have more patience
[1:14:01] than most of us will
[1:14:03] have oh you said that's not true go look
[1:14:06] at the
[1:14:08] Muslims some of them when it comes to
[1:14:10] righteousness they will beat us black
[1:14:13] and
[1:14:14] [Laughter]
[1:14:16] blue they qualify more than we do so
[1:14:20] brother BR realized I I don't have the
[1:14:22] time to read all the quotes but if you
[1:14:23] want it I can give them to you it
[1:14:25] realized that it's not just about the
[1:14:27] fruit because the anointing can come on
[1:14:29] someone and then brother Braham got to
[1:14:31] the point where the Lord made him
[1:14:34] realize that receiving the holy ghost
[1:14:36] means that you accept the word for your
[1:14:39] age now when you say accept the word for
[1:14:41] your age is not coming to sit in a
[1:14:43] message church we should not get
[1:14:45] comfortable by the fact that we are
[1:14:47] sitting in the message church and our
[1:14:49] life does not reflect the spirit of
[1:14:51] Christ do you understand understand that
[1:14:54] so what brother brah is saying is you
[1:14:57] will accept the word but in addition to
[1:14:59] that your life will also tell the story
[1:15:02] that something has
[1:15:04] happened Paul said but said he preached
[1:15:07] what Paul said Paul said the life that I
[1:15:10] now live it is no more I that liveth but
[1:15:14] Christ that liveth in
[1:15:16] me you might ask me the
[1:15:19] question so if I have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:21] will I do anything wrong the problem the
[1:15:24] the the answer is
[1:15:26] probably and many times you will because
[1:15:28] you're still struggling with this flesh
[1:15:31] but let me give a good example that
[1:15:32] might explain it for us how many people
[1:15:35] know that all liars will go to hell the
[1:15:37] Bible said
[1:15:38] that okay all liars will go to hell
[1:15:41] right if they don't
[1:15:43] repent okay how many people believe that
[1:15:45] brother AB Braham told a
[1:15:47] lie you've heard the story did he have
[1:15:50] the Holy Ghost when he told the
[1:15:52] LIE he did have the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:55] brother was brother Braham a
[1:15:56] liar was he always telling lies did he
[1:16:00] tell a lie yesterday and told it again
[1:16:02] no but Abraham was pushed to a corner
[1:16:06] where this
[1:16:08] flesh was broken down brother Braham was
[1:16:11] emotionally at a point where he just
[1:16:14] couldn't take it anymore and because of
[1:16:18] the weakness of the
[1:16:19] flesh brother Braham told a lie but
[1:16:22] guess what happened right after I did
[1:16:25] what he repented of it that is the real
[1:16:29] sign that you've got the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:31] the holy ghost that makes you to say
[1:16:32] that this that I've done wrong I can't
[1:16:34] Ste till
[1:16:36] tomorrow I must make it right right
[1:16:40] now brothers and sisters it's personal
[1:16:43] experience that's why I'm able to tell
[1:16:45] you I I not tell the story but I know
[1:16:48] that there's been a time in my life I
[1:16:49] can tell you the story of one time in my
[1:16:51] life when I knew I received the Holy
[1:16:53] Ghost right after few months after that
[1:16:56] I did something that was
[1:17:00] wrong and I felt like I wanted to
[1:17:03] die right I couldn't wait to make it
[1:17:08] right so it's not just about saying I'm
[1:17:10] a message believer brother the Bram
[1:17:12] preached and told us that there are
[1:17:14] three kinds of believer in the local
[1:17:16] assembly amen that is still part of the
[1:17:19] message I'm not saying we have make
[1:17:20] Believers and unbelievers my prayer is
[1:17:22] is someone who in here as a nonbeliever
[1:17:24] God gives them the grace to realize that
[1:17:26] they have to be a believer if someone
[1:17:28] has been sitting here as a make believer
[1:17:29] living a double life I was once like
[1:17:32] that oh yes I was once like
[1:17:35] that but God's grace came down and made
[1:17:39] me a Believer but let's remember that
[1:17:41] it's not just coming to church let's not
[1:17:44] get comfortable with that right you've
[1:17:46] come out of the world yes you wear your
[1:17:49] skirts you know brothers are well
[1:17:51] groomed they look good we know the
[1:17:54] language it doesn't take time to learn
[1:17:55] the message language how many people
[1:17:57] know that it doesn't take time you know
[1:17:59] growing up we had cousins that came to
[1:18:01] live with us they were they were not
[1:18:03] even Christians they they they were
[1:18:05] coming from a church that worshiped the
[1:18:07] man and he didn't take it didn't take
[1:18:09] long before they they learned the
[1:18:11] message the message uh vocabulary and
[1:18:14] then they know how to say God bless you
[1:18:16] and how to dress fine and be really
[1:18:21] good one of them my
[1:18:24] cousin lady I'll say she probably got
[1:18:27] her Freedom she probably gave her life
[1:18:28] to Christ she actually did confess of
[1:18:32] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:34] but I felt that was just an anointing
[1:18:36] and did I see a change in our life I saw
[1:18:38] some changes in our
[1:18:40] life but a few years down the line she
[1:18:43] went back to where her mom was where she
[1:18:46] wasn't going to The Message Church it
[1:18:48] didn't take long toci to wear
[1:18:49] pants today she is a Muslim
[1:18:59] and sadly living with
[1:19:02] HIV so it's not just about coming to a
[1:19:05] message
[1:19:06] church this part of the service I wasn't
[1:19:08] supposed to bring it like this but I
[1:19:09] know the Lord impress it in my heart if
[1:19:12] you have a question about the Holy Ghost
[1:19:15] if you are not sure if your life is not
[1:19:16] telling with the word of God don't get
[1:19:19] comfortable by being in the message
[1:19:21] Church don't say I've received the
[1:19:23] message that is the evidence I've got
[1:19:25] the Holy Ghost no that is not what he
[1:19:27] meant by that I know brother Barry
[1:19:29] quotes that but brother Barry has also
[1:19:31] made us realize that your life has got
[1:19:33] to tally with the
[1:19:35] word
[1:19:37] amen young people if you have question
[1:19:40] about the Holy Ghost God has got answers
[1:19:43] amen find
[1:19:45] someone who you know that they living a
[1:19:48] good life they're living a Christian
[1:19:50] Life and ask them questions we talk
[1:19:52] about about that in career how do you
[1:19:54] become successful in your career you
[1:19:56] need to have a role model you go to
[1:19:58] someone how did you do it what was it
[1:20:00] like for you 15 years ago I want to be
[1:20:02] where you are today and I know it's
[1:20:05] going to take me 15 years to be there
[1:20:07] but what was it like for you 15 years
[1:20:08] ago what was it like for you 10 years
[1:20:10] ago what was it like for you 5 years ago
[1:20:12] what steps did you take and by learning
[1:20:15] from those people you can do the same
[1:20:17] thing and you find yourself in the same
[1:20:19] place where they are it is the same
[1:20:21] thing with a Christian walk
[1:20:23] amen we've got to encourage one
[1:20:28] another there are people that add that
[1:20:31] question in the time of Abram so that
[1:20:33] you don't feel alone I won't read the
[1:20:35] answer but I'll just read the question
[1:20:37] in the message question and and answer
[1:20:39] is number two preed to 1964 this was one
[1:20:41] of the questions that brother Braham got
[1:20:44] the person said dear brother Braham I
[1:20:46] have been baptized in Jesus name the
[1:20:49] word says you shall receive the gift of
[1:20:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] does this mean the
[1:20:55] baptism the Holy Spirit or does it mean
[1:20:59] I should receive the
[1:21:01] gift definite I shall receive a definite
[1:21:05] experience with the baptism am
[1:21:08] manious to be filled with the spirits
[1:21:11] please excuse the long note as I've been
[1:21:13] wanting to ask this question for a long
[1:21:16] time and the person said thank you the
[1:21:19] brah said and the person had their name
[1:21:20] sign and they are one of the out of Town
[1:21:25] people so people had questions it's not
[1:21:29] it's not there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:31] having the question I'll even say it's
[1:21:33] better to have the question now when you
[1:21:36] are
[1:21:37] alive and you can make things right and
[1:21:40] you can be double
[1:21:42] sure before that moment when it's
[1:21:46] between life and death
[1:21:49] am let's be on our feet tonight
[1:21:54] I'll just read a prayer that brother Ram
[1:21:56] fre in the message the impersonation of
[1:22:00] Christianity yes musicians can come

[1:22:25] counterfeit any church theology any
[1:22:28] intellectuals any emotions anything
[1:22:31] contrary when the Pentecostal skies are
[1:22:35] full of genuine blessings the real
[1:22:37] spirit of God that controls you and
[1:22:39] makes you a real Christian so you don't
[1:22:42] have to impersonate a thing you just be
[1:22:45] a child of the Living God why tell me
[1:22:48] why will you try to accept anything
[1:22:50] different when God is willing and
[1:22:52] waiting and has brought you this far and
[1:22:54] then trying to make love to you through
[1:22:57] the Holy Spirit would you accept a
[1:23:00] declaration of Creeds and so forth and
[1:23:03] try to get you to heaven or some
[1:23:06] fantastic mental emotion which not even
[1:23:10] recognized in the
[1:23:12] Bible would't you receive it all people

[1:24:04] by its
[1:24:05] quality metal is tested by its strength
