[1:00:34] Fellowship for the singles this weekend
[1:00:37] at our place and uh I just um we just
[1:00:41] are overwhelmed
[1:00:43] with how incredible it it actually was
[1:00:47] so our thoughts were perhaps maybe it
[1:00:49] would be wonderful if you know 15 or 20
[1:00:53] people would show interest in you know
[1:00:55] maybe coming to fellowship at our house
[1:00:57] and I believe we had over 40 people
[1:00:59] interested that took of their time and
[1:01:02] their resources to buy plane tickets and
[1:01:04] to drive all night to come to fellowship
[1:01:06] with us and it's it's not taken lightly
[1:01:08] it's truly
[1:01:10] humbling um just a couple of
[1:01:12] announcements uh we have the Men's
[1:01:14] breakfast in Edmonton we'll be going to
[1:01:16] for those who have responded on the poll
[1:01:19] uh that's coming up this weekend we'll
[1:01:20] go up Friday night and then come back
[1:01:22] Saturday afternoon and we have the Youth
[1:01:25] Event happening on the the 20th of
[1:01:26] October as
[1:01:28] well just wanted to bring the results of
[1:01:31] the church officer vote we had this week
[1:01:34] and uh the deacons who have been voted
[1:01:38] in are brother Emanuel Brother Don and
[1:01:41] brother Peter brother Emanuel sarpong
[1:01:43] Brother Don snow brother Peter Boi Manu
[1:01:47] uh the treasurer is brother mvin Panetta
[1:01:50] the trustees are brother Henry Henry
[1:01:52] dick and brother Paul clawen who is in
[1:01:55] surgery this morning God bless you each
[1:01:58] one for stepping forward to bring of
[1:02:01] your sacred portion to the body of
[1:02:03] Christ it is not uh just magic that
[1:02:07] things happen in the church it's not
[1:02:09] just because God just lets it happen
[1:02:13] it's because people have a burden on
[1:02:14] their heart and they step forward
[1:02:16] according to the word and uh we're
[1:02:18] certainly thankful for everyone's
[1:02:20] efforts brother Toby odoo he actually is
[1:02:24] still a deacon we didn't put him on the
[1:02:27] uh on the ballot this year because he
[1:02:30] has decided to step back from the office
[1:02:33] of Deacon so that he can engage in his
[1:02:35] ministry in a greater capacity he feels
[1:02:37] LED of the Lord to do that and uh he did
[1:02:40] talk to me two years ago about that and
[1:02:42] uh we're certainly thankful for the
[1:02:43] leadership of the Lord in our brother's
[1:02:45] life and for the gift in his life so we
[1:02:49] just want to continue to pray for
[1:02:50] brother Toby he said he'll serve until
[1:02:52] the beginning of the new year in the
[1:02:54] capacity of Deacons so if anybody has a
[1:02:57] leadership from the Lord to actually
[1:02:58] stand in that office we certainly have a
[1:03:00] need for that so by all means let one of
[1:03:03] us know and we can certainly go from
[1:03:05] there are you happy this
[1:03:08] morning um I wasn't going to do this but
[1:03:12] I'm just going to do
[1:03:13] this um bear with me for a second
[1:03:17] here I just wanted to let everyone know
[1:03:21] uh this morning I just felt led to do it
[1:03:23] so here we go uh what we did this this
[1:03:25] weekend was we just took from Isaiah
[1:03:27] chapter 40 for those people who are
[1:03:28] wondering about the the singles weekend
[1:03:31] on Friday night we had a devotion at our
[1:03:33] house and uh everyone was there and it
[1:03:35] was just a wonderful time you know
[1:03:37] sometimes in our lives we can we can
[1:03:39] start to age and and maybe grow and
[1:03:42] desire something from the Lord and it
[1:03:43] can seem like the Lord doesn't really
[1:03:45] answer us it sometimes feels like his
[1:03:48] ears are stopped to our prayers and and
[1:03:50] that life continues on and and we just
[1:03:53] keep trudging forward believing the Lord
[1:03:55] but see l in our heart we feel maybe a
[1:03:57] little bit down that God hasn't actually
[1:03:59] heard our prayers and he's not actually
[1:04:01] answering our prayers so we took from
[1:04:03] Isaiah chapter 40 and I just wanted to
[1:04:05] try and encourage each and every one
[1:04:07] that came this morning just or or on
[1:04:10] Friday this weekend the the singles just
[1:04:12] to admonish them that the reason they're
[1:04:15] there is because of the standard they
[1:04:16] hold in their lives because they believe
[1:04:20] they are not giving in to the easy way
[1:04:22] out they're waiting upon the Lord Lord
[1:04:26] and so I took from Isaiah chapter 40 I
[1:04:28] started with verse 26 and and you don't
[1:04:31] have to bring it up I'll just read it
[1:04:32] quickly because this is not the sermon I
[1:04:33] just wanted to to bring this for
[1:04:35] everyone lift up your eyes on high and
[1:04:37] behold who hath created these things
[1:04:40] that bringeth out their host by number
[1:04:43] he calleth them all by names by the
[1:04:46] greatness of his might for that he is
[1:04:49] strong in power not one faileth this is
[1:04:53] the god that we serve Why sayth thou oh
[1:04:56] Jacob and speakest oh Israel my way is
[1:04:59] hid from the Lord he doesn't know what's
[1:05:01] going on in my life he's not listening
[1:05:02] to me no he's listening he knows exactly
[1:05:04] what's going on in our lives my way is
[1:05:07] hid from the Lord and my judgment is
[1:05:09] passed over from my God hast thou not
[1:05:12] known hast thou not heard that the
[1:05:15] Everlasting God the Lord the creator of
[1:05:17] the ends of the Earth fainteth not
[1:05:19] neither is weary there is no searching
[1:05:23] of his understanding he giveth power to
[1:05:25] the faint and to them that have no might
[1:05:29] he increaseth
[1:05:31] strength even the youth shall faint and
[1:05:35] be wary and the young men shall utterly
[1:05:37] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:05:41] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:05:43] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:05:46] run not be weary they shall walk and not
[1:05:49] faint and you know I I don't know if I
[1:05:52] talked about it on Friday but it just
[1:05:53] really hit my heart when I was studying
[1:05:55] this that you know even the youth shall
[1:05:56] faint and be weary the ones who aren't
[1:05:59] actually skillful in the word of God the
[1:06:01] ones that still require milk but the
[1:06:03] ones who are into strong meat that
[1:06:05] really truly have the baptism of the
[1:06:07] Holy Ghost who understand who they are
[1:06:10] when brother Bram talks about adoption
[1:06:11] he says you know all about it you know
[1:06:14] all about who you are you know all about
[1:06:16] your position you know all about the
[1:06:18] word in your day when we're adopted
[1:06:20] we're not youths and we don't faint and
[1:06:23] become weary and the young men shall
[1:06:25] utterly fall how will the young men
[1:06:27] utterly fall they'll just try and do it
[1:06:29] their own way but they that wait upon
[1:06:31] the Lord they're the ones that will
[1:06:33] renew their strength amen I just want to
[1:06:36] encourage each and every one of us let's
[1:06:38] wait upon the Lord he will renew our
[1:06:41] strength we had a tremendous time this
[1:06:43] weekend and Lord willing um it seems
[1:06:45] like we'll potentially do it again and
[1:06:48] uh I think we're really excited about
[1:06:50] that we have learned a few things and
[1:06:53] and met a bunch of people and it's just
[1:06:56] a wonderful time to get together as
[1:06:59] Believers getting into our our lesson
[1:07:02] today our our study today talking about
[1:07:04] the story in 2 Kings chapter 18 uh the
[1:07:08] story of Hezekiah and and how the king
[1:07:11] of Assyria came up against him and said
[1:07:13] make excuse me make an agreement with me
[1:07:17] by a present show me a token give me
[1:07:20] something let me know that you actually
[1:07:22] are willing to make a deal with me and
[1:07:25] last week week when we talked about this
[1:07:26] we we brought it out and said that's
[1:07:28] just exactly what the devil wants us to
[1:07:30] do is to make a concession in our lives
[1:07:32] to just make a deal with them and if we
[1:07:34] can make a deal with the devil then
[1:07:36] he'll he'll he'll give unto us all the
[1:07:39] desires of our heart he'll make our way
[1:07:41] easy isn't it interesting that here we
[1:07:43] have this enemy King sending his
[1:07:46] Messengers to the people of Israel
[1:07:48] saying just don't listen to this guy
[1:07:50] who's a religious crank over here the
[1:07:52] the the pastor of your church or
[1:07:54] whatever it is the king of your land
[1:07:56] just don't listen to him don't hearken
[1:07:58] to his voice just listen to me because I
[1:08:00] can actually take you into your own land
[1:08:02] I can start to give you the stuff and
[1:08:04] and I just want to turn back over if you
[1:08:06] will this morning to the book of numbers
[1:08:09] and and just do a little comparison with
[1:08:11] this verse here in in 2 Kings chapter 18
[1:08:15] where he says uh make an agreement with
[1:08:17] me and and specifically of verse 32
[1:08:20] until I come and take you away to a land
[1:08:22] like your own land in Numbers chapter 14
[1:08:26] we have the uh spies going out into the
[1:08:29] land over into the promised land they
[1:08:32] were right up to the the River Jordan
[1:08:35] the children of Israel were brought out
[1:08:37] from bondage they were brought out from
[1:08:39] the Pharaoh 430 years of task Masters
[1:08:44] doing whatever they wanted to with the
[1:08:46] wives and the daughters and the sons of
[1:08:49] all of the children of Israel according
[1:08:52] to scripture but we know that they went
[1:08:54] over into to the promised land and and
[1:08:57] they actually 12 of them went over and
[1:09:00] 10 of them said we can't do it we're not
[1:09:03] going to be able to do it even though
[1:09:05] they went over and they spied out the
[1:09:07] land and they actually brought back
[1:09:10] fruit of the land they brought back
[1:09:13] evidence one cluster of grapes that it
[1:09:15] took two men to carry out of Numbers
[1:09:18] Chapter 13 sorry not
[1:09:21] 14 they brought the proom pomegranates
[1:09:24] and the figs
[1:09:27] and verse 24 of chapter 13 says the
[1:09:30] place was called The Brook eshkol
[1:09:33] because of the cluster of grapes which
[1:09:35] the children of Israel cut down from
[1:09:37] then and they returned from searching of
[1:09:40] the land after 40 days and they went and
[1:09:43] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[1:09:45] the congregation of the children of
[1:09:46] Israel unto the Wilderness of parin Unto
[1:09:50] Kadesh and brought back word unto them
[1:09:53] and unto all the congregation and showed
[1:09:56] them the fruit of the land they brought
[1:09:59] them and showed them the fruit of the
[1:10:01] land they gave them the evidence that
[1:10:03] land is real it's a real land and it has
[1:10:07] real
[1:10:08] fruit and they told him and said we came
[1:10:12] unto the land whether thou sent us and
[1:10:16] surely it floweth with milk and honey
[1:10:19] and this is the fruit of it and isn't
[1:10:23] that interesting that I just wanted to
[1:10:25] point that out in Numbers Chapter 13
[1:10:28] this is what this king of the of the
[1:10:30] Assyrians is trying to actually bring
[1:10:32] he's trying to give them something that
[1:10:35] sounds remotely similar to what they've
[1:10:37] already been promised and and it's
[1:10:40] interesting because weren't they already
[1:10:42] in their Promised Land weren't they
[1:10:44] already there in the land that floweth
[1:10:46] with milk and honey so why would the
[1:10:48] king come and try and tell them that
[1:10:51] they could actually go somewhere else
[1:10:53] who would want to leave the promised
[1:10:55] land when you're there who would want to
[1:10:57] stop having the Holy Ghost in their life
[1:10:59] when you have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:11:00] life because today when we talk about
[1:11:02] this we're talking about having the
[1:11:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:11:06] the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ himself
[1:11:10] living out through us and the fruit of
[1:11:13] that land is the life that we live the
[1:11:16] fruit of the spirit that we bear on our
[1:11:19] branches for people to partake of the
[1:11:22] fruit of the spirit isn't even for us to
[1:11:24] enjoy we don't pick fruit off our own
[1:11:26] branches and enjoy I don't pick Joy off
[1:11:29] of myself and say I'm going to have some
[1:11:31] Joy I decide I want to have joy and I
[1:11:33] display joy and the world around me sees
[1:11:36] that brother Barry's got joy and
[1:11:38] remember the joy of the Lord not our joy
[1:11:41] the joy of the Lord is what it's our
[1:11:44] strength if we want to be strong and
[1:11:47] stand in this age then we better get
[1:11:49] some
[1:11:50] joy and there's no better way to get joy
[1:11:53] than to encourage ourselves in the the
[1:11:55] word we know that's what David did David
[1:11:57] got down David was a man David he
[1:12:01] suffered some stuff that God had to get
[1:12:03] out of his life but he encouraged
[1:12:04] himself by the word is what the word
[1:12:08] says out of 1963 God doesn't call a man
[1:12:12] to judgment without first warning
[1:12:15] him talking about positions and
[1:12:19] understanding where we are in in our in
[1:12:22] maybe our church and maybe in our
[1:12:23] families but I want to say even more so
[1:12:26] in the promised land but the Bram he
[1:12:29] says if you're working for a man find
[1:12:31] out what your duties
[1:12:34] is you wouldn't he in his message he
[1:12:36] talks about it you wouldn't be working
[1:12:37] for a man and then just go and sit down
[1:12:40] and not do any work for him and wait for
[1:12:43] him to come and tell you you would
[1:12:44] actually go to him and find out what
[1:12:46] what should I do for you what's what's
[1:12:48] the job description because I want to
[1:12:50] actually be in my position for you he
[1:12:53] says if you're working for a man find
[1:12:54] out when what your duties is and then if
[1:12:57] your life is on the earth the earth here
[1:13:00] then we should go to the one who put us
[1:13:03] here and Lord what would you have me to
[1:13:07] do they that wait upon the Lord right
[1:13:11] what would you have me to do what what
[1:13:13] must I do why am I here if it's to be a
[1:13:16] housewife I love how brother brownon
[1:13:18] writes this a
[1:13:20] dishwasher if it's to be whatever God
[1:13:22] wants you to do then to do that the very
[1:13:27] best that you know how to do
[1:13:30] it now I'm just going to throw this out
[1:13:32] there and people might get upset but
[1:13:34] that's
[1:13:36] okay being a housewife doesn't mean that
[1:13:39] you're a
[1:13:42] dishwasher that's brother Barry's
[1:13:44] opinion I'll say it that way you know
[1:13:46] what you could be a dishwasher for an
[1:13:48] employe employment I was a dishwasher
[1:13:50] for employment I did that that was my
[1:13:53] first job when I really needed to
[1:13:56] actually earn some money it was a job
[1:13:57] that I got and uh just because you're a
[1:14:00] housewife doesn't mean you're a
[1:14:01] dishwasher it doesn't mean that you're a
[1:14:03] doormat when you're a housewife you're
[1:14:05] the Bride of the king of the house just
[1:14:08] like We The Kings of the house are the
[1:14:11] Bride of Jesus Christ and just like he
[1:14:14] treats us the grace and the tender mercy
[1:14:17] and love that he gives us we give to our
[1:14:20] bride she's not just a
[1:14:23] dishwasher but brother bradam in context
[1:14:25] here is saying if she's if you're a
[1:14:28] housewife a dishwasher just be whatever
[1:14:31] God wants you to do and you know it just
[1:14:33] brings to mind a story that I was
[1:14:34] reading while I was laid up here I was
[1:14:36] going through one of the books of uh
[1:14:37] brother Bram and uh I just heard the
[1:14:40] story that uh sister ma talked about
[1:14:43] talking to her daughter her daughter
[1:14:45] said mom why do you like ironing so much
[1:14:47] she ironed everything apparently
[1:14:50] everything she ironed everything and one
[1:14:53] day she finally said to her daughter you
[1:14:54] know you know what I don't like ironing
[1:14:56] I hate ironing I have never liked
[1:14:59] ironing but I got a revelation one day
[1:15:02] that if I'm serving my husband I'm
[1:15:05] actually serving God and the way that I
[1:15:07] actually do my own duties the way I
[1:15:11] conduct myself is what I'll be
[1:15:12] responsible for God it was interesting
[1:15:15] though because she did Iron so much but
[1:15:18] she didn't like it she hated it but what
[1:15:20] an example to show her daughter and what
[1:15:21] a a reckoning it must have been for her
[1:15:23] daughter to say what you don't like iron
[1:15:25] I thought you loved ironing because he
[1:15:26] ironed everything no no I got a
[1:15:29] revelation about my position about doing
[1:15:31] everything that I do according to the
[1:15:34] best I can no matter how little no
[1:15:36] matter how little it is brother bradam
[1:15:38] says You must do it you say well the
[1:15:40] trouble of it is each one of us wants to
[1:15:42] do the next man's
[1:15:44] job right sometimes we get the wives
[1:15:48] wanting to do the husband's
[1:15:50] job and don't get me wrong I don't want
[1:15:52] to be a
[1:15:53] dishwasher I've done it I know what it's
[1:15:55] like but I still do it once in a while
[1:15:57] but I don't want to be in the position
[1:15:59] of mom in my house that's not the right
[1:16:02] way we need to do the best we can with
[1:16:04] every single position we have we don't
[1:16:06] want to take each other's positions I
[1:16:08] just got a few quotes to kind of get us
[1:16:10] going here and then we're going to
[1:16:12] really get into it here out of God don't
[1:16:14] call a man to judgment without first
[1:16:16] warning him paragraph 33 brother Bram
[1:16:17] says it's hard if you don't you have to
[1:16:20] depend on the holy spirit because the
[1:16:23] Bible is wrote in riddle
[1:16:26] that's why brothers and sisters we can't
[1:16:28] just say I believe God sent a prophet
[1:16:30] and woohoo it's great I'm saved what's
[1:16:34] going to happen is we think we're saved
[1:16:36] and we're going to slip back into the
[1:16:37] traditions of this world that we live in
[1:16:40] maybe our forefathers maybe our genetics
[1:16:43] maybe an outside influence outside of
[1:16:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've
[1:16:47] already received the mark of the
[1:16:50] beast that's why brother brandham says
[1:16:52] as parents it's vital for us to apply
[1:16:55] the token to our family amen I've got it
[1:16:59] in my notes I'm jumping ahead here but
[1:17:00] you know what entitles us to the Token
[1:17:02] brothers and sisters the full obedience
[1:17:06] to the entire word of God entitles us to
[1:17:09] the Token not just coming to a message
[1:17:11] church not just having message parents
[1:17:14] not just saying I know God sent a
[1:17:15] prophet and I've been to Jeffersonville
[1:17:17] we've got to go on to Crossing Jordan to
[1:17:21] where that fruit lies to where all of
[1:17:23] the promises are on the other side and
[1:17:25] that means we've got to dial to
[1:17:26] ourselves but if we're not willing to do
[1:17:28] that we're never going to see the fruit
[1:17:30] we're going to say where's all the
[1:17:32] Miracles Where's
[1:17:34] God it's just tradition you can't sit
[1:17:37] down and read it the Bible like a
[1:17:40] newspaper brother Bram says it's hid yes
[1:17:42] sir how would you ever justify God when
[1:17:46] he told Moses up there said now you
[1:17:48] don't make any engraven images and
[1:17:50] that's what he said right don't make any
[1:17:52] engraven images in his Commandments
[1:17:54] don't you make anything like heaven any
[1:17:57] Angel anything else don't make any
[1:17:59] engraven images And yet on the same day
[1:18:01] told him to mold two angels out of brass
[1:18:04] and put them right here at the mercy
[1:18:05] seat
[1:18:07] amen how do you explain
[1:18:10] that many people want to look at it with
[1:18:12] common knowledge and say well that's
[1:18:14] contradictory isn't it but if you read
[1:18:17] between the lines if you allow the Holy
[1:18:19] Spirit to interpret this word you can
[1:18:21] see it's God's will he says you have to
[1:18:23] know God and his nature before you can
[1:18:27] understand his word that's why we have
[1:18:29] to go on to having a true relationship
[1:18:32] with Jesus
[1:18:33] Christ if we're not willing to do that
[1:18:35] we're not going to see him he's not
[1:18:38] going to just come and smack us one day
[1:18:40] and say Tada here I am we have to be
[1:18:45] willing to have a relationship with
[1:18:47] him and he will reveal
[1:18:52] himself he says he has to he has the key
[1:18:55] to that word himself he is the only one
[1:18:59] that can handle it and open it and he's
[1:19:02] the only one that has to reveal it we
[1:19:06] can preach the word all we want we can
[1:19:09] try and encourage each other all we want
[1:19:12] but we all every single one of us have
[1:19:14] to go on to having a new birth
[1:19:16] experience and you know brother Bram
[1:19:18] talks about it we can get into a
[1:19:20] situation where maybe the new birth is
[1:19:22] just a little bit not not cool maybe the
[1:19:25] the new birth is just a little bit
[1:19:27] exposing maybe we can feel like people
[1:19:29] will look at us and judge us if we have
[1:19:30] a new birth
[1:19:32] experience brother bradam says it very
[1:19:34] clearly that a new birth any birth is
[1:19:37] messy we're we're having kittens at our
[1:19:40] house this weekend and some of the
[1:19:41] people got to see them and we've had
[1:19:43] them for the last little while but you
[1:19:45] know a a birth is a messy experience
[1:19:47] it's not pleasant it's not and it's the
[1:19:51] same thing with the new birth but for us
[1:19:53] to judge people about how they actually
[1:19:56] die out to themselves this flesh doesn't
[1:19:58] want to die if anybody here has ever had
[1:20:00] the new birth you know exactly what I'm
[1:20:02] talking
[1:20:04] about if you haven't had the new birth I
[1:20:07] strongly recommend it it will change
[1:20:09] everything this Bible will become a new
[1:20:12] book the message will become a brand new
[1:20:15] message brother bradam in the same
[1:20:17] message God doesn't call man to judgment
[1:20:19] without first warning him he says and
[1:20:21] that's the way it is with people we all
[1:20:23] the body of Christ has got to be in
[1:20:25] their position in harmony not just in
[1:20:29] their position in harmony he says see
[1:20:33] and then we can look around and see what
[1:20:34] time of day it is see then the world's
[1:20:37] looking to see what it is
[1:20:39] see but they're watching you remember
[1:20:43] brothers and sisters we can preach all
[1:20:44] we want we can say we're Christians all
[1:20:46] we want but the world around us our
[1:20:49] families the church body they're
[1:20:52] watching
[1:20:53] us and that preach pre is the loudest
[1:20:55] sermon ever the life that we live he
[1:20:58] says but they're watching you and if
[1:21:00] you're just a little hairspring a
[1:21:02] mainspring or whatever you are you do
[1:21:05] the best job you can at that now because
[1:21:09] we have a responsibility that we've got
[1:21:11] to answer to God someday for every man
[1:21:16] that come on the face of the Earth has
[1:21:18] to answer to God for a responsibility my
[1:21:24] I say Lord help me I want to be ready on
[1:21:26] that day when he calls me home my and to
[1:21:30] many of us a stewardship we have to
[1:21:32] answer for this responsibility is a
[1:21:35] stewardship that's been committed to us
[1:21:37] by God he says I don't care what it is
[1:21:40] as I said a few moments ago a housewife
[1:21:43] then be a genuine
[1:21:44] housewife that's
[1:21:46] right excuse me if it's to be a farmer
[1:21:49] be a genuine farmer whatever it is that
[1:21:52] God has put you to do
[1:21:55] you got a stewardship to that you've got
[1:21:58] to answer for to God for because it
[1:22:01] takes all these things to do it it's
[1:22:04] just so beautiful to think about if we
[1:22:06] can just do the very best we can and
[1:22:09] then we reach the end our limit we can't
[1:22:11] go any farther we can't do any better
[1:22:13] and we call upon the name of the Lord to
[1:22:15] help us I guarantee you he's going to
[1:22:17] take us higher and farther he's going to
[1:22:19] take us to places we never even imagined
[1:22:21] that we would go to but it takes
[1:22:23] surrender we've got to be willing to
[1:22:25] surrender to him you know just going
[1:22:27] over this before Israel uh our lesson in
[1:22:31] uh 2 Kings chapter 18 Israel had
[1:22:33] succumbed to the traditional worship of
[1:22:35] the heathens in the land even though
[1:22:39] they were in the promised land they were
[1:22:41] already in the land that floweth with
[1:22:43] milk and honey they have already gone
[1:22:45] over and conquered the land all of the
[1:22:46] old Fighters brother Bram talks about
[1:22:49] that if you want to see something you
[1:22:51] could look it up the old fighters of the
[1:22:52] land the ones that wanted to bicker and
[1:22:54] try and contest and argue and the chors
[1:22:57] and the daans all those guys were long
[1:23:00] gone they were now in the promised land
[1:23:02] they were where they should have been to
[1:23:04] receive the full blessing of God they
[1:23:06] were in the land where David said how
[1:23:08] long you going to let that giant down
[1:23:10] their boast against the armies of the
[1:23:12] Living God don't you know this is our
[1:23:14] Promised Land we can actually stand up
[1:23:16] and defend ourselves and God will fight
[1:23:18] the battles am that's where they
[1:23:21] were but what happened was everything
[1:23:24] was good for them their fridges were
[1:23:26] full of food their bank accounts were
[1:23:29] full they had lots of garments they had
[1:23:33] nice cars everything in their lives were
[1:23:35] good they were in the promised
[1:23:38] land what happened was they started to
[1:23:40] look around and the Heathen worship
[1:23:42] started to creep in it started to come
[1:23:44] into the Church of the Living God and
[1:23:47] God wasn't happy with it at all we'll go
[1:23:50] back and we'll read I think it's in
[1:23:51] chapter 17 it is in chapter 17 17 God
[1:23:55] wasn't happy with
[1:23:56] them and you know it was through the
[1:23:59] prophet that he reminded them and it's
[1:24:01] no different today brothers and sisters
[1:24:04] we can take the message of the hour and
[1:24:06] it will actually encourage us and build
[1:24:08] us up and give us encouragement because
[1:24:10] we can say amen I know I'm in the
[1:24:12] promised land and I'm trying my best I
[1:24:15] fail all the time but I always have the
[1:24:17] desire to get back up again and say Amen
[1:24:20] thank you Lord for sending a prophet let
[1:24:22] me take that word and make it all about
[1:24:24] about my life or we can say that message
[1:24:27] is searing that message is just
[1:24:30] controlling people just take the message
[1:24:31] and try and manipulate people with it
[1:24:34] one of those two ways is what's going to
[1:24:36] happen in our lives there's no neutral
[1:24:38] ground we cannot live in this world and
[1:24:41] just remain neutral especially
[1:24:42] spiritually speaking we're either living
[1:24:45] or we're dying we're growing or we're
[1:24:47] shrinking That's the Law of this
[1:24:49] universe but the prophet of God in this
[1:24:52] day came around and told them get back
[1:24:54] in line with the word don't get up mixed
[1:24:58] up with the heathens don't get all bent
[1:24:59] out of shape and and forget about God
[1:25:02] but that's what they did you know how
[1:25:04] they did it the interesting thing is
[1:25:06] what we're going to study today here God
[1:25:08] reminded the people how they were once
[1:25:10] under bondage in in Egypt and he
[1:25:13] reminded them you can go back and read
[1:25:14] it for the sake of time I I don't really
[1:25:17] want to read too much of it today but
[1:25:20] God God reminded the people that he had
[1:25:21] delivered them out of bondage how they
[1:25:24] were there for 430 years and and and how
[1:25:27] he did it with a mighty hand he hardened
[1:25:29] Pharaoh's heart and how he destroyed all
[1:25:32] of the enemies once they were out all
[1:25:35] they had to do was follow the word of
[1:25:38] the Lord and where was the word of the
[1:25:40] Lord it was in the prophet Moses all
[1:25:43] they had to do was listen to him and do
[1:25:45] exactly what he said and if they did
[1:25:47] that they actually went forward and they
[1:25:50] conquered all of the enemies in the land
[1:25:52] even right up till they came to K Kesh
[1:25:54] barnea and Kadesh barnea was a defining
[1:25:57] moment in the lives of the children of
[1:26:00] Israel wasn't it it was at kadish barnea
[1:26:03] that they had the ability to say Amen
[1:26:05] everything that our forefathers fought
[1:26:07] for all the people that died the enemies
[1:26:09] that died to get us to come this far all
[1:26:12] of those lives are not in vain because
[1:26:14] we know that God is more than able to
[1:26:15] take us
[1:26:16] across but there was 10 of them that
[1:26:19] said no I don't know I don't know don't
[1:26:21] you know there's Giants in the land oh I
[1:26:25] we're just like grasshoppers brothers
[1:26:27] and sisters there's Giants spiritually
[1:26:30] speaking in our land and they're
[1:26:32] boasting saying that we're sick they're
[1:26:35] boasting saying that we've got a
[1:26:37] detached retina they're boasting saying
[1:26:39] that our marriages are in trouble
[1:26:41] they're boasting saying all manner of
[1:26:43] things in our lives but we have the
[1:26:46] ability to say I know exactly who I am
[1:26:48] and I know exactly where I stand and I
[1:26:50] don't have to take that from any giant
[1:26:53] because I know that God God is more than
[1:26:54] able and willing to deal with this giant
[1:26:57] for
[1:26:58] me but God reminded these people how
[1:27:01] they were once under bondage and how
[1:27:02] they had been delivered and how all
[1:27:04] their enemies were destroyed but the
[1:27:06] reason they got to where they are is
[1:27:08] because of their
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:11] Disobedience and it's just it's
[1:27:13] sad because really it's obedience that
[1:27:17] entitles us to the
[1:27:20] Token it's obedience to the entire word
[1:27:23] of God and it's not is saying the entire
[1:27:25] word we've got the written word it's
[1:27:27] black and white and we can read between
[1:27:28] the lines here we've got the entire word
[1:27:30] and I obey the word I I just can't
[1:27:32] really deal with the prophet bit it's a
[1:27:35] bit much it's a bit heavy it's a bit
[1:27:37] carnal because it's a man and you know
[1:27:39] we live in a modern age it's a bit much
[1:27:42] but the entire word is the word of God
[1:27:45] through the prophet amen and the word of
[1:27:47] God through the prophet will only point
[1:27:49] back to the entire word of God he won't
[1:27:52] bring his own word we have a prophet in
[1:27:54] our day and full obedience to the entire
[1:27:57] word of God that He gave in print and
[1:28:00] through the prophet entitles us to the
[1:28:02] token and one iota of a deviation from
[1:28:05] that brothers and sisters gives us the
[1:28:08] opportunity to actually not really
[1:28:11] receive the token in our lives and you
[1:28:13] know unfortunately I believe it and I'm
[1:28:16] sure that every one of us do this is the
[1:28:18] day and age where we need to make sure
[1:28:20] that it's absolutely cut and dried
[1:28:23] there's no room for deviation here
[1:28:24] there's no saying that we can just make
[1:28:26] a hybrid religion and say it's okay to
[1:28:28] do a little bit of this and it's okay to
[1:28:30] do a little bit of that and God will
[1:28:32] still bless me I could still come to
[1:28:34] church and be blessed sure enough you
[1:28:36] can but do you have the
[1:28:39] token because if you don't have the
[1:28:41] token there's a
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] problem full obedience to the entire
[1:28:48] word of God entitles us to the Token
[1:28:50] it's an exact quote what is the token
[1:28:52] brothers and sisters today in our our
[1:28:55] age it's the Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost and you know sometimes it's a
[1:28:59] little uncomfortable to talk about the
[1:29:01] Holy Ghost but those people who know me
[1:29:03] know that that's pretty much all I like
[1:29:05] to talk about because without the Holy
[1:29:07] Ghost In Our Lives we're not going to
[1:29:09] understand this word of God as we read
[1:29:11] in Isaiah we've got to have the Holy
[1:29:13] Ghost In Our Lives when we have the Holy
[1:29:15] Ghost In Our Lives it makes the Bible a
[1:29:17] new book it makes the message a new
[1:29:19] message and most importantly of all it
[1:29:22] makes us a new creature amen in Christ
[1:29:25] Jesus because we're not just getting
[1:29:26] into Christ Jesus we're actually getting
[1:29:28] Christ Jesus into us and it becomes his
[1:29:31] Spirit living out through us to the
[1:29:33] world around us the token is the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost how do you get it you get it by a
[1:29:37] new birth the dying out of ourselves not
[1:29:40] just saying that I believe am and
[1:29:43] therefore I'm saved no no that's a BAP
[1:29:46] good Baptist Doctrine but understanding
[1:29:48] that we have got to actually make a
[1:29:50] change in our lives and how how can we
[1:29:53] ever live the life
[1:29:54] of the token in our lives nobody nobody
[1:29:57] can there's not one of us that could
[1:29:58] ever live the life of the message I'm
[1:30:01] sure brother art would be one who' be
[1:30:02] able to testify about that the amount of
[1:30:04] years that you've been around the
[1:30:05] message of the hour have you ever been
[1:30:07] able to live the message it's got to be
[1:30:09] God's life living it out through us how
[1:30:12] could you serve God that many years with
[1:30:14] that many Winds of doctrine that many
[1:30:16] different things that come around and
[1:30:18] Shake us you get the life of Jesus
[1:30:21] Christ the token and you're able to with
[1:30:24] stand all of the enemies that come our
[1:30:27] way but God allowed Israel because of
[1:30:29] their
[1:30:30] Disobedience to be carried off into
[1:30:33] another land and he allowed Judah to
[1:30:36] become Under Siege and and this is where
[1:30:38] it leads into our story this morning now
[1:30:41] we're going to really begin the story I
[1:30:44] I am sorry I just wanted to lay a bit of
[1:30:45] a background with it sort of a recap
[1:30:47] from last week God allowed Israel to be
[1:30:49] carried off why because they were
[1:30:51] disobedient if we become disobedient
[1:30:54] children to the word of God in our day
[1:30:56] then he will allow us to be carried off
[1:30:58] we can never ever think that we're going
[1:31:00] to be able to just dabble a little bit
[1:31:02] with something that's unclean and and
[1:31:04] think it's going to be okay we I I don't
[1:31:06] know what the the quote is there I think
[1:31:08] there's a song that you know if we sin a
[1:31:10] little bit it's going to take us a whole
[1:31:11] lot farther than we ever intended for it
[1:31:14] to take us and it's going to cost us a
[1:31:16] whole lot more than we ever thought we
[1:31:19] would ever be able to pay or would have
[1:31:20] to pay for it but just like Israel was
[1:31:23] carried off so will we be carried off if
[1:31:25] we are not careful and God allowed Judah
[1:31:29] the remaining country the remaining
[1:31:31] Believers to become Under Siege now so
[1:31:34] they weren't carried off but they had
[1:31:36] all of the enemy surrounding them and
[1:31:37] there was no way for them to escape
[1:31:39] there was nothing that they could do a
[1:31:41] and why was it though if we could just
[1:31:43] look in in Kings 2 Kings chapter
[1:31:47] 17 I think it's important just to maybe
[1:31:50] dwell on this for a little bit just to
[1:31:51] to look at it
[1:31:55] we'll start with verse
[1:31:56] 24 of 2 Kings chapter
[1:32:03] 17 talking about where the the people
[1:32:06] came
[1:32:07] from and and how he placed
[1:32:10] them verse 24 and the king of Assyria
[1:32:13] brought men from Babylon and from Kua
[1:32:16] and from Ava and from hamath and from
[1:32:20] sepharim and placed them in the cities
[1:32:22] of Samaria instead of the children of
[1:32:25] Israel and they possessed Samaria and
[1:32:29] dwelt in the cities thereof why on Earth
[1:32:31] were their enemy people living in the
[1:32:33] promised land in the position where the
[1:32:35] children of Israel should have been and
[1:32:37] so it was at the beginning of their
[1:32:39] dwelling there that they feared not the
[1:32:41] Lord they didn't know the Lord they
[1:32:42] didn't care therefore the Lord sent
[1:32:44] Lions among them which slew some of them
[1:32:47] wherefor they spake to the king of
[1:32:49] Assyria saying the Nations which thou
[1:32:51] Hast removed and placed in the cities of
[1:32:54] Samaria know not the manner of God of
[1:32:56] the land therefore he hath sent lines
[1:32:59] among them and and behold they slay them
[1:33:01] because they know not the manner of the
[1:33:04] god of the land why wouldn't they know
[1:33:06] the manner of the god of the land this
[1:33:08] was the promised land and the king of
[1:33:11] Assyria commanded what did he say saying
[1:33:14] carry tither one of the priests whom he
[1:33:16] brought from then and let them go and
[1:33:18] dwell there and let him teach the manner
[1:33:20] of the god of the land get one of the
[1:33:23] these priests back here and and get them
[1:33:25] preaching get them teaching preaching
[1:33:28] Saves The Sinner but we know teaching
[1:33:30] positionally places them and we needed a
[1:33:33] little bit of that then then one of the
[1:33:35] priests who they had carried away from
[1:33:37] Samaria came and dwelt in bethl and
[1:33:39] taught them how they should fear the
[1:33:42] lord but here's the problem how be it
[1:33:46] every nation made gods of their own and
[1:33:49] put them in houses of the high places
[1:33:52] which the Samaritan had made every
[1:33:55] nation in their cities wherein they
[1:33:58] dwelt and the men of Babylon made Sako
[1:34:02] benoth and the men of C made Negel and
[1:34:06] the man of hamath made Ashima and the
[1:34:10] aites made
[1:34:11] nibas and tarac and the saphar vites
[1:34:16] burnt their children in fire to adriam
[1:34:21] MC and Anam Al
[1:34:24] the gods of
[1:34:26] searam and you know it's been said I
[1:34:28] think it might even be in the Bible I
[1:34:30] could be wrong but uh I remember hearing
[1:34:32] it said preached it's probably in the
[1:34:35] message that when they were doing that
[1:34:38] passing their children their seed
[1:34:40] through the fire to to Molech that's who
[1:34:42] it really was the god of Molech uh uh
[1:34:45] they're passing their children throwing
[1:34:47] their children they literally put their
[1:34:48] children on the arms of this Idol at
[1:34:51] their babies and let the babies roll off
[1:34:53] the hands Into the Fire and you know
[1:34:56] what was said is that they had the music
[1:34:58] playing and the drums beating and all of
[1:35:01] this stuff happening in the background
[1:35:02] and what they did was they actually made
[1:35:04] the sounds louder so they could overcome
[1:35:07] the screams of the children as they died
[1:35:10] could you imagine parents doing that it
[1:35:12] doesn't make any sense but you know what
[1:35:15] brothers and sisters we look at it
[1:35:17] naturally and say it's terrible and it
[1:35:19] surely
[1:35:20] is oh Lord have mercy that nobody on
[1:35:23] Earth would do that
[1:35:25] now but I want to say as Believers of
[1:35:29] this message if we let down the bars in
[1:35:32] our own homes as parents we're letting
[1:35:35] our children potentially have the
[1:35:38] opportunity to pass from our hands Into
[1:35:40] the
[1:35:44] Fire and if we're not careful maybe
[1:35:47] we'll just turn up the music a little
[1:35:48] louder and just drown out the screams of
[1:35:50] our children we don't want to do that we
[1:35:53] want to make sure that we're presenting
[1:35:55] the cleancut word of God according to
[1:35:57] the messenger for our age without
[1:35:59] excuses if it takes our own hide off
[1:36:02] that's what we need isn't
[1:36:06] it goes on in verse 32 so they feared
[1:36:10] the
[1:36:11] Lord they feared the
[1:36:13] Lord and made unto themselves of the
[1:36:16] lowest of them Priests of the high
[1:36:19] places oh my which sanri s sacrifice for
[1:36:24] them in the houses of the high places
[1:36:26] verse 33 they feared the Lord and served
[1:36:29] their own
[1:36:31] Gods brothers and sisters let us not
[1:36:34] fear the
[1:36:36] lord say we believe the message of the
[1:36:38] hour and serve other gods this ain't no
[1:36:42] time to play church this ain't no time
[1:36:45] to be getting caught up in the left hand
[1:36:47] or the right hand we know that Israel is
[1:36:49] in our homeland we know the whole world
[1:36:52] now is gathering around
[1:36:54] Israel we can see the sign of the times
[1:36:58] we know exactly where we are brothers
[1:37:00] and sisters the prophet said that it's
[1:37:02] later than you think we're 60 years down
[1:37:04] the
[1:37:05] road where do we stand today this is no
[1:37:08] time to play
[1:37:10] Church they feared the Lord and served
[1:37:14] their own Gods after the manner of the
[1:37:17] Nations whom They Carried Away from then
[1:37:20] unto this day they do after the Lord
[1:37:24] unto this day they do after the former
[1:37:27] manners they fear not the Lord neither
[1:37:30] do they after their statutes or after
[1:37:33] their ordinances or after the law and
[1:37:35] Commandments which the Lord commanded
[1:37:38] the children of Jacob whom he named
[1:37:42] Israel this just about put me on the
[1:37:45] floor when I was reading this they
[1:37:46] feared the Lord but they made unto
[1:37:49] themselves their own religion they
[1:37:52] feared the Lord but they serve the other
[1:37:55] gods I just wonder brothers and sisters
[1:37:57] today if any of us myself included have
[1:38:01] ever feared the Lord and served another
[1:38:05] God because if we're doing that we're
[1:38:08] taking away the blessing in our lives
[1:38:10] we're going to find ourselves getting
[1:38:11] carried away by the king of Assyria to a
[1:38:14] place that we don't want to go to we'll
[1:38:16] find ourselves in a position where we
[1:38:18] won't even be able to worship the way we
[1:38:20] want
[1:38:21] to because we're in a position that we
[1:38:24] allowed ourselves to get
[1:38:28] to isn't it interesting though that God
[1:38:32] in this situation in chapter 17
[1:38:35] here God he'll never be without a
[1:38:38] witness will he he even took the king of
[1:38:42] the enemy and said we're we're getting
[1:38:44] attacked with lions in here we we better
[1:38:46] we better actually call one of those
[1:38:48] priests in here not because we want to
[1:38:50] see them succeed and worship God and
[1:38:52] have the token in their life and have
[1:38:53] successful marriages and families and
[1:38:56] and to see them just Excel and and live
[1:38:59] the best life they ever could no no just
[1:39:02] so we can save our hide there's Lions
[1:39:03] coming in and eating people up so we
[1:39:05] better get one of those priests in here
[1:39:06] and have a hlink preacher and just get
[1:39:08] some some word of God going on so we're
[1:39:10] safe right that's not the way God does
[1:39:13] it but he still allowed it to happen he
[1:39:16] still allowed the ministry to come in
[1:39:19] and help them amen I think it's
[1:39:22] beautiful that's the God we serve
[1:39:24] but you know even in this situation God
[1:39:26] did not leave his people he didn't leave
[1:39:29] his people for the sake of his name
[1:39:31] without a
[1:39:32] representation here we have King
[1:39:34] Hezekiah there in 2 Kings chapter 18
[1:39:38] going a little bit forwards now in 2
[1:39:40] Kings 18
[1:39:42] verse1 it says now it came to pass in
[1:39:45] the third year of HOSA son of ela king
[1:39:48] of Israel that Hezekiah the son of ahaz
[1:39:50] King of Judah began to Reign 2 and5
[1:39:53] years years old was he when he began to
[1:39:54] Reign and he reigned 20 and9 years in
[1:39:57] Jerusalem his mother name also was Abby
[1:40:00] the daughter of
[1:40:02] Zachariah this was the one right in the
[1:40:05] middle where this verse applies from the
[1:40:08] king before and the King after and he
[1:40:10] did that which was right in the sight of
[1:40:12] the Lord I say Lord help me Lord help us
[1:40:16] to do that which is right in the sight
[1:40:19] of the Lord according to all that David
[1:40:22] his father did and what did he do
[1:40:25] remember they feared the Lord but they
[1:40:28] had their own Gods right this King came
[1:40:31] in now at 25 years old we talked about
[1:40:35] this last time I just think it's so good
[1:40:37] I I can totally talk about it again what
[1:40:38] did he do he removed the high places and
[1:40:40] break the images and cut down the Groves
[1:40:42] and break in pieces the Brazen serpent
[1:40:45] that Moses had made he completely made a
[1:40:49] mess of everything that they had going
[1:40:51] on imagine the pers ution he must have
[1:40:54] got just like the two the two spies with
[1:40:57] the other 10 Elders of the church that
[1:41:00] were there they said no no no we can't
[1:41:02] do that we're we're just grasshoppers
[1:41:04] look at the natural circumstances
[1:41:05] there's no way we could take that
[1:41:06] Promised Land but the two of them
[1:41:08] because they were another Spirit they
[1:41:09] said you know what we're more than able
[1:41:11] God himself is going to do it for us we
[1:41:13] can't do it we just need to follow him
[1:41:14] and trust him he said he give it to us
[1:41:16] he brought us this far didn't we make it
[1:41:18] this far isn't that fruit of the land
[1:41:23] my goodness here we have this King
[1:41:26] Hezekiah and he just thrashed their
[1:41:29] religion he thrashed it cut it down and
[1:41:32] brought it right back to the word of God
[1:41:34] right back to the word of the Prophet
[1:41:36] right back to the message of the hour he
[1:41:39] remove the high places break the images
[1:41:41] cut down the Groves and break in pieces
[1:41:43] the Brazen serpent that Moses had made
[1:41:46] why did he break that BRAC and serpent
[1:41:48] For unto those days the children of
[1:41:50] Israel took what was given given by God
[1:41:54] to help them and they Twisted it and
[1:41:57] manipulated it and began to make it
[1:41:59] their religion again we're going to take
[1:42:01] what God has given and just pervert it
[1:42:03] it's the way of the devil we'll take the
[1:42:05] the message of the hour we'll take the
[1:42:06] theory and we'll just pervert it just a
[1:42:08] little bit and we'll wind up with a a
[1:42:10] hybrid religion and there ain't no
[1:42:13] hybrid about this religion it will never
[1:42:16] become
[1:42:17] hybridized but the children of Israel
[1:42:19] they took this thing this good thing and
[1:42:20] they actually perverted it but God
[1:42:23] didn't leave his people forsaken his
[1:42:26] word says that he'll never leave us or
[1:42:27] forsake us I just think it's so
[1:42:30] beautiful if we turn over to chapter
[1:42:33] 19 Hezekiah he heard the boast of the
[1:42:37] great king he understood what the king
[1:42:41] had said you know if you just make an
[1:42:43] agreement with us if you'll just listen
[1:42:47] to us if you'll just hearken to us
[1:42:49] because we're stronger naturally we're
[1:42:51] stronger everyone is surrounded you
[1:42:53] can't get away from us you might as well
[1:42:55] just make a league with us and let us
[1:42:57] lead you into the greener pastures and
[1:43:00] we'll give you a land that's sort of
[1:43:02] flowing with milk and honey not
[1:43:04] realizing that this is their land but
[1:43:06] it's God who is rich in Mercy will not
[1:43:08] leave his word unattended he will always
[1:43:11] have a representation on earth in every
[1:43:14] single age in every single
[1:43:17] situation and so he has Hezekiah here on
[1:43:20] the ground in chapter 19
[1:43:23] and it came to pass when King Hezekiah
[1:43:25] heard it that he rent his clothes and
[1:43:29] covered himself with sackcloth and went
[1:43:31] into the house of the
[1:43:33] Lord and he sent eliakim which was over
[1:43:36] the household and shebna the Scribe and
[1:43:39] the Elders of the priest covered with
[1:43:41] sackcloth in
[1:43:44] total
[1:43:46] humility covered in sackcloth to Isaiah
[1:43:49] the prophet the son of Amos
[1:43:53] and they said unto him it's just
[1:43:55] beautiful isn't it they went right to
[1:43:56] the prophet right they didn't go to a
[1:43:59] pastor they didn't go to a preacher they
[1:44:00] didn't go to a Ministry they didn't go
[1:44:01] to their parents they didn't go anywhere
[1:44:03] else they went right to what the prophet
[1:44:05] said what is the prophet going to tell
[1:44:07] us he went unto him thus sayith Hezekiah
[1:44:10] this day is a day of trouble and of
[1:44:12] rebuke and blasphemy for the children
[1:44:15] are come to birth and there was not
[1:44:17] strength to bring forth and we talked a
[1:44:20] little bit about this last time I think
[1:44:21] it's probably good just to make a little
[1:44:23] bit of a point of it we can come to the
[1:44:25] place where we are just on the brink of
[1:44:28] getting into that new birth but just not
[1:44:30] have the strength to be able to push
[1:44:32] ourselves all the way through and see
[1:44:34] that new birth manifest in our lives
[1:44:36] just like the children of Israel coming
[1:44:38] up to the Jordan River to Kadesh barnea
[1:44:40] and saying you know what it's all right
[1:44:42] here we're we're just about ready to
[1:44:44] have the new birth but oh there's just
[1:44:46] not enough strength because there's
[1:44:47] Giants on the other side don't look at
[1:44:49] the natural situations brothers and
[1:44:51] sisters don't wait for a miracle to come
[1:44:54] our way for God to show us that he loves
[1:44:56] us he says he loves us in his word that
[1:44:58] means he loves
[1:45:00] us thank you Lord we've got to be
[1:45:02] willing to take him at his word amen
[1:45:07] Hezekiah going into the house of the
[1:45:09] Lord going into the prophet in verse
[1:45:12] four it may be well it it may be the
[1:45:16] Lord thy God will hear all the words of
[1:45:20] R Shaka RAB Shaka remember remember the
[1:45:23] bad guy that we talked about last week
[1:45:25] this is the messenger from the king of
[1:45:27] Assyria it may be that the Lord God will
[1:45:30] hear all the words of this guy whom the
[1:45:31] king Assyria his master hath sent to
[1:45:34] reproach the Living God a Goliath
[1:45:37] standing in the promised land thinking
[1:45:39] he's got any power attraction my and
[1:45:43] will reprove The Words which the Lord
[1:45:46] thy God hath heard wherefore lift up thy
[1:45:48] prayer for the remnant that are left and
[1:45:52] remember this guy he was bringing word
[1:45:54] to the people in in Judah telling them
[1:45:58] thus saith the great
[1:46:00] king thus saith the great king and the
[1:46:04] people were trying hard not to listen
[1:46:07] but they were getting nervous because
[1:46:08] they kept hearing thus saith the great
[1:46:10] king and it was an uncertain sound and
[1:46:13] we know the prophet preaches a a message
[1:46:15] like that we don't want to hear an
[1:46:17] uncertain sound we want to hear a
[1:46:19] certain
[1:46:20] sound and you know what the certain
[1:46:22] sound is that they were're longing to
[1:46:23] hear is exactly the same thing that we
[1:46:25] long to hear thus sayith the
[1:46:27] Lord and we know they heard it so the
[1:46:31] Servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah
[1:46:33] they came to the prophet the servants
[1:46:35] were looking at the natural situations
[1:46:37] but they came to the prophet and Isaiah
[1:46:39] said unto them verse six thus shall ye
[1:46:42] say to your master thus saith the Lord
[1:46:46] not thus sayth the great king thus saith
[1:46:48] the Lord be not afraid of The Words
[1:46:50] which thou Hast heard which Hast the
[1:46:53] Servants of the kinging of Assyria have
[1:46:56] blasphemed me I love it because right
[1:46:59] there brothers and sisters he's taking
[1:47:01] it and he's making it personal against
[1:47:03] himself they have blasphemed against me
[1:47:06] not against you you got everything to do
[1:47:09] with it but it's all about
[1:47:10] me verse seven behold I will send a
[1:47:13] blast upon him and he shall you shall
[1:47:17] hear a
[1:47:19] rumor I was thinking a nuclear bomb
[1:47:22] maybe a catapult with something really
[1:47:24] explosive on it and fiery something some
[1:47:27] kind of a blast brothers and sisters
[1:47:29] rumors are dangerous
[1:47:32] things and shall return to his own land
[1:47:35] and I will cause him to Fall by the
[1:47:37] sword of his own
[1:47:39] land so RAB RAB Shaka returned and found
[1:47:43] the king of Assyria Waring against libna
[1:47:45] for he had not had heard that he was
[1:47:48] departed from lakes and when he heard
[1:47:51] say of
[1:47:53] triath the king of Ethiopia behold he
[1:47:56] has come out to fight against thee he
[1:47:57] sent Messengers again unto Hezekiah
[1:48:00] saying thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah
[1:48:03] the king of Judah saying let not thy God
[1:48:06] in whom thou trust us deceive
[1:48:09] Thee the devil's not afraid to come
[1:48:12] around and quote the word of
[1:48:14] God just like he was in the Garden of
[1:48:16] Eden it was only one word off and we
[1:48:19] know that it would be so close it would
[1:48:21] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:48:22] possible what's the difference how is it
[1:48:24] not possible with the very elected the
[1:48:26] very elected go on to the true baptism
[1:48:28] of the Holy Ghost some people live under
[1:48:31] the anointing of the Holy Ghost where
[1:48:32] they come to service and it's a great
[1:48:34] service and they can see maybe signs and
[1:48:36] wonders and they can hear good preaching
[1:48:38] and they feel encouraged and then Monday
[1:48:40] morning rolls around and they fall flat
[1:48:42] on their face again and they say I just
[1:48:43] can't live it the only reason you can't
[1:48:46] live it is because you haven't
[1:48:47] experienced
[1:48:48] it don't just take a service don't just
[1:48:51] take service or or special meetings or
[1:48:54] Camp experiences it's got to be the true
[1:48:56] indwelling of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:48:58] life and when that happens brothers and
[1:49:01] sisters it becomes spiritually speaking
[1:49:04] autopilot alls we do is surrender to him
[1:49:07] and his word and he drives we're not his
[1:49:10] co-pilot he's not our co-pilot he's our
[1:49:13] God he is the Mighty
[1:49:16] God I think it's so beautiful this story
[1:49:19] is just
[1:49:21] amazing verse 11 beh behold thou Hast
[1:49:25] heard what the kings of Assyria have
[1:49:27] done to all lands by destroying them
[1:49:29] utterly and shalt thou be delivered is
[1:49:32] this guy really going to save you this
[1:49:34] God this one that hezekiah's preaching
[1:49:36] about you might as well not listen to
[1:49:38] him his where where they're going with
[1:49:39] it just jump down to verse
[1:49:42] 14 and we talked about this last week
[1:49:44] it's just so good we got to do it again
[1:49:46] verse 14 says and Hezekiah received the
[1:49:48] letters of the hand of The Messengers he
[1:49:51] got the word he got the doctor's report
[1:49:53] he got the argument from the spouse he
[1:49:56] got the problem with the children who've
[1:49:58] gone Wayward he understood the situation
[1:50:01] he was manifesting before him and
[1:50:02] Hezekiah received the letter in the hand
[1:50:04] of The Messengers and read it and
[1:50:06] Hezekiah went up to the house of the
[1:50:08] Lord and spread it out before the Lord
[1:50:10] we talked about this last week we need
[1:50:12] to take the situations in our lives and
[1:50:14] know where to go they that wait upon the
[1:50:17] Lord shall renew their
[1:50:20] strength if we try and find a natural
[1:50:22] solution for a spiritual problem
[1:50:24] brothers and sisters the devil's got us
[1:50:26] duped we will never solve a spiritual
[1:50:29] problem with a natural solution the
[1:50:31] world wants us to try and live with it
[1:50:33] through medication through psychology
[1:50:36] but not according to the word of the
[1:50:37] Living God Amen no way the king of
[1:50:41] Assyria the True Believers they're going
[1:50:44] to take their problems and spread them
[1:50:45] out before the Lord the prayer meeting
[1:50:48] on Thursday night is not going to be too
[1:50:50] much for their schedule they're going to
[1:50:51] go up to the house house of the Lord and
[1:50:53] lay their problems out before him
[1:50:55] because they know that he is
[1:50:58] alive and Hezekiah verse1 15 prayed
[1:51:02] before the Lord and said oh Lord God of
[1:51:05] Israel oh Lord God of the Church of the
[1:51:08] Living God I want to say this morning
[1:51:09] which dwelleth between the cherubims
[1:51:11] Thou Art the god even thou alone of all
[1:51:15] the kingdoms of the
[1:51:17] earth thou Hast made Heaven and Earth
[1:51:19] remember we talked about this a little
[1:51:21] while ago sometimes we need to remember
[1:51:23] the Lord's Prayer the disciples said
[1:51:25] teach us how to pray Lord Master Rabbi
[1:51:28] tell us how you want us to speak to you
[1:51:31] we need to remember that one once in a
[1:51:34] while how to speak to him to think about
[1:51:36] it we need to speak like Hezekiah spoke
[1:51:39] unto him my verse 16 Lord bow down thine
[1:51:43] ear and hear Open Lord thine eyes and
[1:51:46] see and hear the words of s cherub which
[1:51:50] hath sent him to reproach not the
[1:51:53] children of Israel to reproach the
[1:51:56] Living
[1:51:56] God and I think that's really maybe a
[1:51:59] key to where we stand today brothers and
[1:52:02] sisters is to remember when the Devil
[1:52:03] comes around with his boasts in our
[1:52:04] lives he's not coming around boasting
[1:52:06] against us he wants us to believe that
[1:52:08] he's coming around boasting against us
[1:52:10] he's coming around and boasting against
[1:52:11] God and we just need to go Lord he's
[1:52:14] coming around to boast against
[1:52:19] you Lord bow down thine ear and hear and
[1:52:22] open Lord thine eyes and see and hear
[1:52:24] the words of Sienna cherub which hath
[1:52:26] sent him to reproach the Living
[1:52:28] God of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria
[1:52:32] have destroyed the Nations and their
[1:52:35] lands of a truth Lord these are the
[1:52:39] facts yes this is what's going on and
[1:52:43] it's real and it's
[1:52:47] true and have cast their gods Into the
[1:52:51] Fire for were no Gods but the work of
[1:52:54] men's hands wood and stone and therefore
[1:52:58] they have destroyed them now therefore
[1:53:00] oh Lord Our God I beseech thee that thou
[1:53:03] save us out of his
[1:53:05] hand that all the kingdoms of the earth
[1:53:08] may know that thou art the Lord God even
[1:53:13] thou
[1:53:15] only isn't it beautiful this next
[1:53:18] verse I know I'm repeating a lot from a
[1:53:21] lot from last week praise the Lord then
[1:53:23] Isaiah the son of Amos sent to Hezekiah
[1:53:27] saying thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:53:30] the sweetest words ever heard in the
[1:53:33] ears of a mortal human I can only
[1:53:36] imagine in that moment hey the sweetest
[1:53:38] words you could ever desire to hear thus
[1:53:41] saith the Lord concerning you thus saith
[1:53:44] the Lord of Israel that which thou Hast
[1:53:46] prayed to me against Sienna cherub the
[1:53:49] king of Assyria I have heard
[1:53:54] so beautiful so amazing what a mighty
[1:53:57] God we
[1:54:01] serve it's just such a beautiful thing
[1:54:05] amen and you know what the prophet did
[1:54:09] when Hezekiah
[1:54:11] went Hezekiah went to the Lord not the
[1:54:14] prophet Hezekiah went to the Lord
[1:54:17] himself and and what did he do he took
[1:54:19] the word of the Prophet to the Lord he
[1:54:22] didn't take his own words he did he
[1:54:24] prayed but but he took his own words and
[1:54:28] the prophet's word which is actually the
[1:54:30] word of God and he brought it back to
[1:54:32] the Lord in his prayer he reminded him
[1:54:36] that he is the Lord and that he is more
[1:54:38] than able to deliver them and he's just
[1:54:41] looking for that same thing in our lives
[1:54:43] today brothers and sisters that kind of
[1:54:45] surrender in our
[1:54:46] lives and I can guarantee you if we're
[1:54:49] willing to do that we'll hear him say I
[1:54:51] have heard heard thy prayer amen many
[1:54:54] times in our lives the devil will come
[1:54:56] around and make his boast I bet we could
[1:54:58] ask every one of us and every single one
[1:55:00] of us would be able to say
[1:55:02] that I've experienced it this week the
[1:55:06] devil's come around and made his boast
[1:55:08] he knows me he knows my DNA he knows my
[1:55:10] physical makeup he thinks he knows my
[1:55:13] mental makeup he probably knows a lot
[1:55:15] more about it than I do because of the
[1:55:17] genealogies behind me and this natural
[1:55:20] state that I live in but you know I
[1:55:22] don't trust in him amen so when he comes
[1:55:25] around to make his boast I I don't trust
[1:55:27] in him I trust in the Lord am I trust in
[1:55:30] the word of God I trust in the message
[1:55:32] of the hour I'm willing to esteem that
[1:55:34] greater than any one of the
[1:55:35] circumstances that I encounter in my
[1:55:37] life I'm not willing to hearken to a
[1:55:39] devil that's going to come around and
[1:55:40] say do this do that think about this
[1:55:43] look at that go over here go over there
[1:55:45] blah blah blah all of that is just
[1:55:48] garbage from the devil and we don't have
[1:55:50] to tolerate it brothers and sisters we
[1:55:52] don't have to hearken to it we don't
[1:55:54] have to give him a second of our time we
[1:55:57] can simply dismiss him you know we
[1:56:00] talked about a little earlier I told you
[1:56:01] I jumped ahead but I'm getting into my
[1:56:03] notes here we've got Numbers Chapter 13
[1:56:05] and 14 the children of Israel they had
[1:56:07] evidence that there was a land flowing
[1:56:09] with milk and honey they had the proof
[1:56:11] right right before them but many of them
[1:56:14] were more willing to actually go after
[1:56:16] the natural circumstances than actually
[1:56:19] believing the word of God in their
[1:56:21] moment believing that that moment was
[1:56:23] actually in the eyes and the ears of the
[1:56:26] Lord that the Lord was well aware of
[1:56:27] their circumstance and their situation
[1:56:30] the devil wants us to believe that
[1:56:31] nobody has ever gone through what you're
[1:56:32] going through right now the stuff that
[1:56:34] I'm going through in my mind and my
[1:56:36] heart nobody ever deserves to know about
[1:56:39] it because no one has ever gone through
[1:56:41] it like this and if anybody ever heard
[1:56:43] or understood what I'm actually
[1:56:44] experiencing in my life right now they
[1:56:46] would say that I'm an unbeliever and
[1:56:48] maybe a heretic and maybe they wouldn't
[1:56:49] want to associate with me anymore that's
[1:56:51] all the devil
[1:56:54] you're a son and daughter of the most
[1:56:55] high God when you start hearing that
[1:56:57] kind of talk just recognize who it is
[1:57:01] and put them to flight amen they that
[1:57:04] wait upon the Lord will renew their
[1:57:10] strength there is
[1:57:12] evidence there is evidence brothers and
[1:57:14] sisters and I can promise you if you
[1:57:16] looking for evidence get in the word get
[1:57:19] in the word of God and when your time
[1:57:21] comes for for the test you'll actually
[1:57:24] see the fruit of the land you'll see in
[1:57:27] the experience that this is a living God
[1:57:29] that you serve when the devil wants to
[1:57:31] come around and try and Shake our faith
[1:57:33] we'll be able to say uhuh ain't
[1:57:35] happening here out of 1963 God doesn't
[1:57:38] call man to judgment without first
[1:57:40] warning
[1:57:41] him brother Bram he says paragraph 43
[1:57:44] when you plead anything to
[1:57:47] God you got to be reason for it
[1:57:52] it's just like this scripture that I so
[1:57:54] often refer to if you say to this
[1:57:57] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[1:58:00] you believe that what you've said will
[1:58:02] come to pass now you can have what you
[1:58:07] said now that's all alt together
[1:58:10] controlled on motive and objective see
[1:58:13] or it won't happen see and I want to say
[1:58:16] this brothers and sisters if we're not
[1:58:18] seeing the results of God in our lives
[1:58:20] maybe according to the way we believe
[1:58:22] that they should be according to the
[1:58:24] word of God if we're not witnessing
[1:58:26] those results I want to ask the question
[1:58:28] and and it's just a question I don't
[1:58:29] want any answers I want us to just think
[1:58:31] about these words I I take this in my
[1:58:34] own heart and think about it as I say it
[1:58:36] is there anything in our life that we
[1:58:38] can change that will cause us to line up
[1:58:41] with this word a little better because
[1:58:43] if there is then that means we got
[1:58:45] something stopping us from seeing the
[1:58:48] manifestation the full manifestation of
[1:58:50] this power in our lives
[1:58:53] but when we're willing to just say Lord
[1:58:55] be it unto me according to Thy word just
[1:58:57] like Mary said then we're going to see
[1:58:59] the results he is the same yesterday
[1:59:01] today and forever that's the Keystone
[1:59:03] verse of the message he is the same
[1:59:06] yesterday today and forever this is the
[1:59:09] God we
[1:59:10] serve he said it's controlled on motive
[1:59:13] and objective I've got prayers for a
[1:59:16] brand new Ferrari Lord I need a Ferrari
[1:59:20] I can see what that does for my image
[1:59:22] oh yeah people like it when people have
[1:59:24] Ferraris when you pull up to a stoplight
[1:59:27] and you rev that engine and people can
[1:59:29] hear it and they look and they say man
[1:59:31] that's different than everything else
[1:59:32] around look at that guy he must be rich
[1:59:36] my is my motive correct you could hear a
[1:59:40] whole bunch of different things in there
[1:59:42] if you're
[1:59:42] listening there's a lust of the flesh
[1:59:45] there's a pride of life there's all
[1:59:47] these different things going on is that
[1:59:50] where we're living no do we need to have
[1:59:53] a new suit of clothes do we need to have
[1:59:55] a new car do we need to have a new house
[1:59:58] say Amen
[2:00:02] brother have we got the right motive and
[2:00:04] objective according to the message of
[2:00:06] the
[2:00:07] hour I I can say this I I think it's
[2:00:11] beautiful I would say that's God
[2:00:13] speaking right there out of the mouth of
[2:00:18] babes brother bradam says you just can't
[2:00:21] go out here here that's where many of us
[2:00:24] make so many mistakes and I can tell you
[2:00:26] brother and sister I'm not saying this
[2:00:28] from a Pious position behind a Pulpit
[2:00:30] I'm preaching to me I've done it out of
[2:00:32] the wrong
[2:00:33] motive many times you just can't go out
[2:00:37] here that's where many of us makes many
[2:00:39] mistakes it's it's going out and say now
[2:00:41] I'll show you I got faith to do this now
[2:00:44] you're wrong to begin with God don't
[2:00:47] give you gifts just to play
[2:00:49] with God won't be mocked
[2:00:52] we can't wave our little wand and say
[2:00:54] just I can do this and God's going to do
[2:00:56] his thing you know it's not going to
[2:01:00] happen it won't
[2:01:04] work sometimes I I don't know I can only
[2:01:06] be honest brothers and sisters I'm just
[2:01:08] going to be
[2:01:09] me once upon a time I saw this little
[2:01:14] thing I trust that maybe it will help
[2:01:16] somebody the only reason I'm saying it
[2:01:17] is not because it's not to it's almost
[2:01:19] to my shame but I'm just going to say it
[2:01:23] many times I think we can actually
[2:01:24] behave this way as message Believers and
[2:01:27] I sayl help
[2:01:29] me I watched this little clip of a show
[2:01:32] when I was a kid it was called I don't
[2:01:33] know what it was called it's a game
[2:01:35] show and it gets to a showdown in in the
[2:01:39] game show and to my shame as a Believer
[2:01:42] I watched just this little clip I didn't
[2:01:44] watch the whole thing I don't subscribe
[2:01:45] to it but I saw this thing and right at
[2:01:48] the end when it was the most critical
[2:01:50] point of the game and this woman was
[2:01:53] there and she had the opportunity to win
[2:01:55] I don't know a few thousand dollars like
[2:01:57] big deal and and everything was set to
[2:01:59] start in this game and what happened
[2:02:03] blew my mind as a Believer it shocked me
[2:02:07] to my core because here we have this
[2:02:09] game show Hollywood it's all whatever
[2:02:12] and and they're just about to The
[2:02:13] Showdown and now we're going to start
[2:02:15] okay are you ready and she says no no no
[2:02:17] just wait just wait just wait to the
[2:02:18] host to the game show host just hold on
[2:02:19] a second and he's like really what like
[2:02:21] what could be so important that youd
[2:02:23] want to stop this and she just says holy
[2:02:26] spirit activate Holy Spirit activate and
[2:02:30] she started doing this and and before
[2:02:33] long everyone in the studio the game
[2:02:35] show host everyone was getting into
[2:02:36] their groove let's activate the Holy
[2:02:38] Spirit and I just stood back and I
[2:02:40] thought you know is that what we do
[2:02:43] sometimes as Believers we think that we
[2:02:44] can just do something to cause God to
[2:02:47] move according to our
[2:02:49] desire we need to be saying Lord not my
[2:02:52] will but thy will be
[2:02:55] done I don't want my will I want your
[2:02:58] will because you know best you've got
[2:03:01] all things under your control but it
[2:03:04] shocked me and you know I just have to
[2:03:05] liken it to the same thing as the
[2:03:07] prophet saying something told him to
[2:03:09] bend around and pick up that pack of
[2:03:11] cigarettes in the woods and he preached
[2:03:13] that message the smoking man's taste
[2:03:16] right not that's not what it's called
[2:03:18] it's the thinking man's filter right or
[2:03:21] smoking man's taste and are we willing
[2:03:24] to actually filter all of the things
[2:03:26] through this word of God it's a
[2:03:28] tremendous
[2:03:29] message but it shocked me to think that
[2:03:32] people would actually think that we can
[2:03:34] just do some kind of an act and suddenly
[2:03:36] God's coming on the scene to do
[2:03:38] something for us he's going to help us
[2:03:40] win a game
[2:03:42] show
[2:03:43] my if that's all we're doing with God
[2:03:46] then then we got serious
[2:03:49] problems out of the same message
[2:03:51] paragraph 60 God don't call a man to
[2:03:54] judgment without first warning him he
[2:03:55] says remember God is like always in
[2:03:57] threes like father son Holy Ghost
[2:04:00] justification baptism sanctification
[2:04:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost so forth he's
[2:04:05] in threes now God is that message of
[2:04:08] repentance to the church
[2:04:11] nominal not the bride the bride's well
[2:04:14] beyond just
[2:04:16] repentance God is that message of
[2:04:19] repentance to the church nominal
[2:04:22] gods in that message of Divine Healing
[2:04:25] to the church
[2:04:28] Pentecostal the ones seen the the
[2:04:31] outpouring of the Holy Ghost the isusa
[2:04:33] Street Revival right the the
[2:04:35] Pentecostals but he takes it further I
[2:04:38] think it's so good we don't want to live
[2:04:40] in the Pentecostal Realms do we we had a
[2:04:42] prophet say that we're not living in the
[2:04:44] Pentecostal age or the Leo Dean age we
[2:04:46] living in the bride age 60 years ago
[2:04:48] where are we at
[2:04:50] today Divine heals to the church
[2:04:52] Pentecostal gods in the message to the
[2:04:55] bride see so we find out that all of
[2:04:59] them calling one to this this to that
[2:05:02] and to that to that God calling the
[2:05:05] church out of the world the calling the
[2:05:08] church into the denominational Church
[2:05:11] into Pentecost and calling out calling
[2:05:15] the bride out of Pentecost see we're not
[2:05:19] just interested in seeing signs and
[2:05:20] wonders we're not just interested in
[2:05:22] having a a good musical show and our
[2:05:24] hearts feel energized because we went to
[2:05:27] church we're interested in recognizing
[2:05:30] Who We
[2:05:31] Are The Bride of Jesus
[2:05:35] Christ there's no greater calling in
[2:05:37] this
[2:05:40] universe another quote I hope it's
[2:05:43] okay actually I'm going to go back to
[2:05:45] the message here the Bible I
[2:05:49] mean I just think it's so good
[2:05:53] verse 35 of 2 Kings chapter
[2:06:03] 19 actually we'll just go to 32 start at
[2:06:08] 32 2 Kings 19:32 says therefore thus
[2:06:13] saith the Lord concerning the king of
[2:06:16] Assyria he shall not come into this city
[2:06:20] nor shoot an AR there nor come before it
[2:06:24] with
[2:06:25] Shield nor cast cast a bank against it
[2:06:30] by the way that he came by the same
[2:06:33] shall he return and shall not come into
[2:06:36] this city saith the Lord hallelujah and
[2:06:39] I just want to say this brothers and
[2:06:41] sisters this applies to our
[2:06:44] congregations this applies to our homes
[2:06:46] our marriages this applies to our
[2:06:48] families amen this applies to us
[2:06:52] this applies to us as individuals in our
[2:06:54] lives in our spiritual walk when the
[2:06:56] Devil comes around and tries to tell us
[2:06:57] you made this mistake now you've
[2:06:59] actually gone so far you can't come back
[2:07:01] or look at what you've done look at what
[2:07:03] you thought look at what you looked at
[2:07:04] blah blah blah when you start to hear
[2:07:05] those thoughts just go and read this and
[2:07:07] put yourself in this in this verse here
[2:07:10] for I will defend this city to save it
[2:07:13] not to lose it to save it for my own
[2:07:16] sake and for my servant David's sake and
[2:07:19] it came to pass that night that the the
[2:07:21] angel of the Lord went out and smoted in
[2:07:23] the camp of the
[2:07:25] Assyrians 14 score 5,000 that's
[2:07:29] 185,000 people and when they arose early
[2:07:33] in the morning behold they were all dead
[2:07:38] corpses this is the same God that we
[2:07:40] serve brothers and
[2:07:42] sisters when our Our Lives feel like
[2:07:44] we're under siege let's go to prayer
[2:07:47] remember it wasn't I'm going to bring
[2:07:49] the quote it wasn't the prophet prayer
[2:07:52] that saved the the people was
[2:07:55] it I started to think about this as I
[2:07:58] was studying it it was not the prophet's
[2:08:01] prayer sometimes we can get caught up in
[2:08:03] a situation where we want to put it off
[2:08:05] on the prophet what did the prophet say
[2:08:06] and sure enough we should do that but
[2:08:08] that's not enough to give us a
[2:08:09] relationship with him the prophet came
[2:08:12] to tell us go on to
[2:08:18] Christ if we're willing to do that he's
[2:08:20] willing to defend
[2:08:22] even if we're not willing ourselves that
[2:08:24] doesn't change the fact that he's still
[2:08:26] willing to defend what a mighty God we
[2:08:29] serveu out of 1952 0716 thou knowest all
[2:08:34] things it was not the prophet's
[2:08:37] prayer just think about this brothers
[2:08:40] and sisters brother Ram he says now if
[2:08:41] we can see what Jesus was in the New
[2:08:43] Testament then we'll see what Jesus is
[2:08:45] working amongst us in the last days is
[2:08:48] that right now not altogether Jesus
[2:08:50] working in me he works in you just the
[2:08:54] same as he works in me
[2:08:57] what this is the
[2:09:00] prophet does he work the same in us just
[2:09:02] the same as he works in him my I haven't
[2:09:06] seen that in my life the reason I'm
[2:09:08] saying that is I think it's important
[2:09:09] for us to recognize he's trying to
[2:09:11] encourage us to recognize it's not him
[2:09:15] it's
[2:09:17] him he works in you just the same as he
[2:09:20] works in me anybody
[2:09:21] that's born again dot dot
[2:09:24] dot I may able may be able to see
[2:09:27] visions and you may not but that doesn't
[2:09:31] mean that he's not with
[2:09:34] you brothers and sisters take courage if
[2:09:37] you can't see Visions take courage maybe
[2:09:40] we can't have a prayer line and see
[2:09:42] person after person after person healed
[2:09:44] going on rejoicing that doesn't mean
[2:09:47] anything people can be healed today and
[2:09:49] die a Lost Sinner
[2:09:52] moral remember people could be healed at
[2:09:54] Beatles
[2:09:56] concerts don't let a sign or wonder be
[2:09:59] our sticking point let the word of God
[2:10:01] do it for us he works in you just the
[2:10:06] same as he works in me anybody that's
[2:10:08] born again I may be able to see Visions
[2:10:11] you may not but that doesn't mean he's
[2:10:13] not with you he's with you just the same
[2:10:17] he was just the same with Hezekiah as he
[2:10:20] was with us
[2:10:23] Isaiah he was just the
[2:10:25] same Hezekiah was the one who got the
[2:10:28] blessing Isaiah took the
[2:10:31] word you know when I was reading this
[2:10:33] and studying I just thought you know
[2:10:35] isn't that exactly right about the
[2:10:36] prophet he lived his whole life fought
[2:10:38] his whole ministry didn't he with that
[2:10:41] gastro intestinal thing in his stomach
[2:10:44] here and some of the doctors tried to
[2:10:45] tell him it was his heart and he had
[2:10:47] that Vision that told him don't don't
[2:10:49] let them tell you it's your heart it's
[2:10:51] not your heart and we know on the wings
[2:10:53] of the snow white dove he got his answer
[2:10:55] he preached it he found that seventh
[2:10:57] White Dove and we know that God told him
[2:10:59] your enemy is dead remember the story
[2:11:01] where he's raking up and down the stick
[2:11:03] and that little weasel looking thing
[2:11:05] came out with the electric currents on
[2:11:06] it that thing was killed brother Bram he
[2:11:09] did his whole
[2:11:11] Ministry asking and pleading he even
[2:11:14] wrote a new verse for that song
[2:11:17] right oh my I can't even remember the
[2:11:20] song's name probably yeah on the wings
[2:11:22] of a snow white dove but here we have
[2:11:25] the prophet God didn't change his life
[2:11:28] even though he prayed for it he didn't
[2:11:29] change his life he let him go a long
[2:11:33] long ways but he did finally answer his
[2:11:35] prayer towards the end of his ministry
[2:11:37] and isn't it interesting right at the
[2:11:38] very end when he was in the car wreck
[2:11:40] what was he doing in the car wreck he
[2:11:43] was apologizing to the people while they
[2:11:44] were trying to get him out and he moaned
[2:11:47] in pain he probably screamed in pain and
[2:11:50] and and and the First Responders were
[2:11:52] like wow this guy's apologizing to
[2:11:55] us his wife needed a touch what did he
[2:11:58] do he reached over and touched sister Ma
[2:12:01] how many more years did she live by the
[2:12:03] prayer of that
[2:12:04] Prophet but you know it wasn't for him
[2:12:07] was it it was for us amen it was for the
[2:12:10] Bride of Jesus Christ so that we could
[2:12:12] go on to have a real relationship with
[2:12:13] our God Amen not so that we can see
[2:12:16] signs and wonders but I'll tell you what
[2:12:18] when you need him when you really need
[2:12:20] him and you're born again and you call
[2:12:22] upon the name of the Living God he is
[2:12:24] more than willing to be right there with
[2:12:29] you Hezekiah was the one who got the
[2:12:32] blessing and I want to say it today take
[2:12:35] hezekiah's name out not adding or or or
[2:12:38] taking away from don't don't go too far
[2:12:40] getting that way with me but just take
[2:12:42] your name and insert it in
[2:12:44] there right say Christopher was the one
[2:12:47] who got the blessing brother brandham
[2:12:50] just took the word put your name in
[2:12:53] there make it real brother brandom in
[2:12:55] the message he says we've got to find
[2:12:57] our own characteristics in the Bible
[2:13:00] characters we need to be willing to put
[2:13:03] ourselves in there and when we can do
[2:13:05] that I think we'll get some great
[2:13:07] encouragement Hezekiah was the one who
[2:13:10] got the blessing Isaiah just took the
[2:13:12] word I better call the musicians amen
[2:13:14] you see it Hezekiah was the one that got
[2:13:17] the blessing not Isaiah it wasn't
[2:13:20] Isaiah's prayers that was heard it was
[2:13:22] hezekiah's prayers that was heard and I
[2:13:24] want to say today brothers and sisters
[2:13:26] the prophet for our day is done gone
[2:13:29] onto his
[2:13:30] reward he's been gone for how many years
[2:13:33] now God's not listening to hear the word
[2:13:35] of the Prophet he's listening to hear
[2:13:37] your words he's listening to hear my
[2:13:40] words but we got to be willing to give
[2:13:42] him words but when we are his ears open
[2:13:45] to hear
[2:13:46] it it was hezekiah's prayers that was
[2:13:49] heard Isaiah was just the medium that
[2:13:52] took him the word in human lips what God
[2:13:56] had said well that's the same thing he
[2:13:58] says well that's the same thing that was
[2:14:01] God don't you believe that was Christ
[2:14:04] the anointed the logos well sure it's
[2:14:07] the same thing tonight I say sure it's
[2:14:10] the same thing this morning brothers and
[2:14:12] sisters they that wait upon the Lord
[2:14:14] they will renew their strength that's
[2:14:16] the word of God you have to renew your
[2:14:17] strength if you're willing to wait upon
[2:14:20] the Lord H he's not going to come as an
[2:14:23] Uber delivery or or door Dash or
[2:14:25] whatever it is skip the dishes whatever
[2:14:27] it is we're used to just getting instant
[2:14:29] results for our lives it's not the way
