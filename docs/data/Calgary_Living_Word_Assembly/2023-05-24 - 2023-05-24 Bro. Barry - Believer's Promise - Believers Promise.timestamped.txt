[43:36] just like to read verse 3 and verse 4
[43:38] tonight
[43:41] blessed be the God and father of our
[43:43] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[43:46] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[43:49] places in Christ
[43:53] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[43:55] before the foundation of the world
[43:58] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[44:01] before him in love
[44:04] let's just bow one more time
[44:07] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[44:08] word thank you Lord that it's a Living
[44:10] Word
[44:11] and father we we don't want to just
[44:15] be formal and lukewarm and Powerless
[44:18] father we want to recognize that this
[44:20] word the only way this word can have
[44:23] life is if you Quicken it and when you
[44:26] Quicken it father then it is truly a
[44:28] Living Word father I pray that tonight
[44:31] we could just take these words that were
[44:33] spoken that were read your Eternal Word
[44:35] father and that you would just allow it
[44:38] father to Quicken our souls father Lord
[44:41] that it would just be more than print on
[44:43] pages father that we would be able to
[44:45] read between the lines father that you
[44:48] would just open this word to us like
[44:50] those two on the road to Emmaus father
[44:52] Lord we need to hear from you it takes
[44:55] your spirit to make these words life to
[44:58] us father so we just invite you father
[45:00] to have the preeminence in the service
[45:02] now help me to get out of the way father
[45:04] help the listeners to get out of the way
[45:06] help all of us father to just open our
[45:08] hearts and our minds unto you father and
[45:10] give you the preeminence that you desire
[45:12] Lord then we'll be careful to give you
[45:14] the prayer praise we just ask that you
[45:16] would be with all those who couldn't be
[45:18] here tonight for whatever reason Lord
[45:19] that you would just bless them
[45:21] abundantly above all they could ask or
[45:23] think now Lord we just want to commit
[45:25] this service entirely into your hands
[45:27] that when we leave here tonight we could
[45:29] say truly we heard from you we just love
[45:32] you and we thank you we ask all of these
[45:34] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[45:36] amen amen God bless you tonight you may
[45:40] be seated
[45:41] certainly wonderful to see everyone here
[45:44] tonight I'd like to speak on the
[45:46] believer's position and we've been
[45:49] taking so much time talking about the
[45:52] the positions and and the family and we
[45:56] know that one of the one of the things
[45:58] that God had in his mind is he he wanted
[46:01] to have a family he had an attribute
[46:03] that he needed to express and that's why
[46:06] he chose to express it in mankind and to
[46:09] have a a family but
[46:11] you know I want to take it from the
[46:13] perspective of Ephesians chapter
[46:16] five verse 31 and 32 for this cause
[46:20] shall a man leave his father and mother
[46:22] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[46:24] they too shall be one flesh as we heard
[46:28] brother Gilbert say at the beginning of
[46:30] the year I and my father are one that's
[46:33] the purpose that the the people purposed
[46:35] in their hearts and we know that it
[46:36] wasn't the people even it was the devil
[46:38] in the people they purposed to kill
[46:41] Jesus Christ when he was on Earth and it
[46:43] was just fine that he said you know I
[46:45] can heal you and I can deliver you and
[46:47] and I can preach the word real good we
[46:50] can have wonderful meetings but as soon
[46:52] as I begin to declare I and my father
[46:54] are one that's when the people wanted to
[46:56] kill Jesus and you know the devil wants
[46:59] to keep us from receiving that
[47:01] Revelation in our hearts and and I
[47:03] believe it with all of my heart the more
[47:05] that that I talk about it even I feel
[47:07] the pressure of the enemy saying no
[47:10] don't don't go there and and the more I
[47:12] think about it the more it becomes a
[47:14] little bit confusing to me in my mind
[47:15] but I know one thing is for certain when
[47:18] we get up here and we just follow the
[47:20] leadership of the Lord and the notes
[47:21] that he gives us I know something's
[47:23] happening I know that that we are coming
[47:26] to a place brothers and sisters where
[47:28] Satan doesn't want us to get to and that
[47:31] is in our true position because once we
[47:33] get there once the bride body gets to
[47:36] that place where truly she is one with
[47:38] the Lord then Satan is powerless before
[47:41] her and it will be a short quick
[47:42] demonstration not of her power because
[47:45] she has none of her own it's all his
[47:47] power but it'll be a short quick
[47:48] demonstration of his power to this world
[47:51] and then the bride goes home
[47:54] and I think that's what we're all
[47:56] hungering and thirsting for we had such
[47:59] a wonderful time on Sunday after service
[48:01] thank you everyone for coming and
[48:04] participating it's just almost like a
[48:06] taste of the Millennium I just I just
[48:08] wonder will we play music there will we
[48:11] just play songs and and worship I kind
[48:15] of think we will and probably will eat
[48:18] probably will rest but we won't need to
[48:21] rest because we're tired and we won't
[48:23] need to eat because we're hungry
[48:25] we'll just be there doing what we love
[48:27] to do together it'll be so wonderful
[48:31] talking about the believer's position in
[48:34] Christ tonight that is what I want to
[48:37] talk about and and that is truly the
[48:39] believer's position we know that the
[48:41] wife's position is with her husband even
[48:44] in her husband and and the husband's
[48:47] position is with his wife
[48:49] and uh the children's position is with
[48:52] their parents you know sometimes I I
[48:54] remember growing up as a kid it was
[48:56] something that was maybe a little bit uh
[49:00] common sort of in the area that I was
[49:02] living or maybe it was something I saw
[49:04] on television as a child I don't know
[49:06] but children ran away from home
[49:09] sometimes when they're trying to make a
[49:11] statement to their parents now I'm not
[49:14] in any way saying that anyone should
[49:16] ever do that as a child because you're
[49:19] not going to make any statement other
[49:21] than you are rebellious as a child to
[49:23] your parents you have god-given parents
[49:26] for a purpose but I just was it just
[49:30] came to me now and I was thinking you
[49:31] know it's wonderful because sometimes we
[49:34] want to just run away
[49:36] we want to just run away from our
[49:38] problems and what that demonstrates as a
[49:41] child is running away from your problems
[49:43] isn't going to solve anything it's just
[49:44] going to give you a multiplicity of new
[49:47] problems and you know this world is full
[49:50] of bad people and there's people out
[49:51] there that would just love to get a hold
[49:53] of a child that has no authority over
[49:56] them nobody helping them nobody watching
[49:58] over them and and it's a terrible
[50:00] terrible thing but it's a very real
[50:02] thing and you know it's just the same
[50:04] thing I can't help but think it's the
[50:05] same exact thing for a Believer to want
[50:08] to run away from from their leadership
[50:10] from from their headship from from their
[50:13] protection and when that happens when
[50:15] the devil can get us to get away from
[50:17] from our leadership from our protection
[50:19] from our parents so to speak and the
[50:22] devil's got us he's he's got easy access
[50:24] to us and that's what Satan wants he
[50:27] just wants to get us out of our position
[50:28] if he can do that then he's got some
[50:31] some success in our lives but we know as
[50:34] Sons and Daughters of God it will only
[50:35] be for a short while he'll never have
[50:37] true success in our lives even if we
[50:40] give it to him or not he will never do
[50:42] it because if this scripture that we
[50:44] read tonight out of Ephesians chapter
[50:45] one if he has Cho chosen us verse 4
[50:50] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[50:52] before the foundation of the world
[50:55] ain't nobody ever going to touch us
[50:56] Satan can't have us
[50:58] God might say you can put your hand on
[51:00] his life you can you can put the
[51:03] pressure to him so that we can actually
[51:04] see that maturity come out and you know
[51:07] we know Christ he only learned obedience
[51:10] through the sufferings in his life right
[51:13] and not one of us is going to be exempt
[51:15] from from that angle from that direction
[51:17] we have got to go through sufferings in
[51:20] this life and sometimes children our
[51:22] parents can be tough to contend with
[51:24] sometimes our parents are tired
[51:26] sometimes our parents are frustrated
[51:27] sometimes our parents are angry
[51:30] sometimes they're negligent but it
[51:32] doesn't change the fact that they're
[51:34] your parents and you have to obey them
[51:36] because that's your position as a child
[51:38] and it's the same thing as a husband to
[51:40] a wife and the same thing as a wife to a
[51:42] husband but the key to it I believe as a
[51:44] Believer a Believer will always say I
[51:47] was wrong
[51:48] I recognize that I was wrong because
[51:50] when we have the spirit of Christ he
[51:52] will tell you
[51:54] you did wrong
[51:55] you need to go fix that
[51:57] and whether we listen to that voice and
[51:59] fix it or not is is completely up to us
[52:03] but talking about our position
[52:05] and Believers I don't even know how I
[52:07] got into that uh children's thing wow
[52:11] brother Branham says out of the
[52:13] believer's position in Christ such a
[52:16] beautiful message
[52:17] and it's in the 50s too I just think
[52:19] it's so wonderful because we could say
[52:21] you know
[52:22] that was before the seals
[52:24] I think we've gone over this so many
[52:26] times but you know before the seals were
[52:28] open was brother Branham a prophet
[52:31] he was a prophet from his mother's womb
[52:33] right that's that's the office of a
[52:35] prophet so the entirety of the message
[52:37] is applicable
[52:39] the believer's position in Christ
[52:42] um
[52:43] sorry I didn't even put it there it's
[52:44] out of 1955 but you know when when when
[52:47] you do have
[52:50] um
[52:50] the latter part of the message in you
[52:52] when you've eaten that book you know
[52:55] that the stuff that he's saying in the
[52:57] early parts of the message it's just
[52:59] right in line there's no part that's
[53:01] that's off there's a couple places where
[53:03] he was off but he did go and correct
[53:06] that I'm not going to get into that
[53:07] tonight but out of this message
[53:08] believer's position of Christ he says
[53:10] how many Christians are here raise up
[53:11] your hands
[53:12] all the Believers raise up your hands
[53:14] everywhere oh I suppose that's wonderful
[53:18] he says 100 percent
[53:21] now if you're a Believer I believe that
[53:23] I know what the greatest curse that's on
[53:26] the church today
[53:29] is not knowing what they are
[53:33] the greatest curse that's on the church
[53:35] today is not knowing what they are
[53:37] the believer's position in Christ
[53:41] just so beautiful how our positions play
[53:43] into this and and I'll just slide this
[53:45] in right here if we want to be in our
[53:48] positions in Christ brothers and sisters
[53:50] be the best husband that you can be be
[53:52] the best wife that you can be be the
[53:54] best child that you can be be the best
[53:57] in your position in your job that you
[53:59] can be just do your very best live live
[54:01] your life like your Christ to this world
[54:04] and and you will actually show a Living
[54:07] Word to this world but the Bible goes on
[54:10] they say he says now with the help of
[54:11] God this afternoon the holy scriptures
[54:13] if he will help us let's try to place
[54:16] the believer positionally in Christ and
[54:19] show what is his authority in Christ
[54:23] then everybody out there will be praying
[54:25] for the sick and will be having a great
[54:27] meeting I'm sure
[54:28] and I just can't help but think it's so
[54:30] relevant tonight as we gather together
[54:33] if we can just consider what our
[54:36] position is in Christ brothers and
[54:38] sisters he has blessed us with all
[54:42] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[54:44] he's chosen us before in in him before
[54:48] the foundation of the world that we
[54:50] should be holy and Without Blame I just
[54:54] want to dwell there for a few minutes
[54:55] holy and Without Blame and I think the
[54:59] way that the scripture is written it's
[55:00] not to confuse us and I think it's
[55:02] important for us to recognize that it's
[55:04] not written maybe the way that we speak
[55:06] it and that we would comprehend it in in
[55:08] our English language now I'm not going
[55:10] to claim to be grammarically correct or
[55:12] a scholar but I just want to bring this
[55:14] to our our thoughts and and make us
[55:17] consider this that that he has chosen Us
[55:20] in him before the foundation of the
[55:23] world that we should be holy and Without
[55:25] Blame before him in love that word that
[55:27] isn't saying something in the future
[55:30] that some time out there we should be
[55:33] holy and and before him in love
[55:36] blameless it's that he has done that
[55:39] that we truly are before him blameless
[55:42] in love that he chose us to be holy and
[55:45] Without Blame before the foundation of
[55:47] the world that's our position in Christ
[55:49] brothers and sisters not to be condemned
[55:52] with this world not to be saying that
[55:54] you know I did this wrong and I did that
[55:55] wrong and I know I'm going to do
[55:57] something wrong tomorrow so I might as
[55:58] well just give up and and and just live
[56:00] a half-baked Christian life because it's
[56:03] the only life that I know that's not it
[56:05] at all satan wants us to dwell there
[56:08] Satan wants us to be the ones that are
[56:10] just moping around because we don't
[56:12] recognize our position but if we can
[56:14] recognize that you are the sinless
[56:17] Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[56:19] if you want to talk about the the times
[56:21] of the message and and and what do you
[56:24] call it the uh progressive revelation at
[56:26] the end of the message of the hour just
[56:28] before he signs off he says that you are
[56:31] the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus
[56:33] Christ and you never did it in the first
[56:34] place why is that because of Ephesians
[56:37] chapter one he chose you in him before
[56:41] the foundation of the world to be holy
[56:43] and Without Blame
[56:46] there's no way that you could be holy on
[56:48] your own brothers and sisters there's no
[56:49] way that we could be holy on our own
[56:52] I just was thinking about it this
[56:54] afternoon you know what was it like in
[56:55] the Garden of Eden
[56:58] there was a real Harmony that existed
[57:00] there wasn't it
[57:01] just a tremendous Harmony starting with
[57:03] you know even God coming and walking
[57:06] with them in the cool of the evening God
[57:08] himself just coming and walking with
[57:11] them in the cool of the evening
[57:13] just to be able to fellowship with God
[57:15] and ask any question brother Branham
[57:17] talks about the way it was without him I
[57:19] think I've got the quote here but just
[57:21] the way he says it that you know Adam
[57:23] there was nothing held back from him
[57:25] when he was in the Garden of Eden he was
[57:28] the son of God and what could he do he
[57:30] could just go and and crawl right up in
[57:33] daddy's knee he's a man
[57:36] but he was still a son
[57:38] brother Bradham says he could just go
[57:39] and crawl right up in daddy's knee and
[57:41] say Daddy what about this what what
[57:43] about that you could just ask him any
[57:46] question and God would take the time to
[57:48] explain it son you know what here's the
[57:51] answer just exactly the way you want it
[57:53] and you ask that question because I
[57:56] wanted you to ask that question and this
[57:57] is why I wanted you to ask that question
[57:59] to think about the harmony that would be
[58:01] in the garden and then he says you know
[58:04] what I know that my son is a little bit
[58:07] lonely so I'm going to create a woman
[58:09] I'm going to take one from his side a
[58:12] rib out of his side and just allow her
[58:14] to be instead of being in him
[58:17] she'll be with him
[58:19] and isn't it interesting because now in
[58:22] the Garden of Eden he has a bride he has
[58:25] Eve that just comes out of him God takes
[58:28] her from inside of him
[58:31] so that she could be there expressed in
[58:33] his life and there's a a real Harmony
[58:36] still she understands she's the wife she
[58:39] understands that Adam is is is her
[58:42] husband and they both understand that
[58:45] God is the head of both of them and and
[58:48] that he is the head of the church
[58:49] there's there's none greater than God
[58:51] and they understand there's a Harmony in
[58:54] all of creation understands there's this
[58:58] harmony but what happens is that battle
[59:01] that started in heaven Satan coming down
[59:05] and being positionally placed in the
[59:07] garden so that God could express his
[59:10] attributes
[59:11] something interrupts this harmony
[59:14] and Eve gets out from the headship of
[59:17] her husband
[59:18] and begins to think on her own begins to
[59:21] reason on her own begins to think that
[59:22] you know what I don't know if I should
[59:24] take everything that my husband says to
[59:26] be 100 correct
[59:28] I think I should maybe listen to another
[59:30] voice just a little bit because I have I
[59:33] have I have critical thinking in my in
[59:36] my body in my mind so maybe I should
[59:39] just think a little bit about what's
[59:40] been said and and consider what this
[59:43] serpent is telling me
[59:45] can you imagine that Harmony was broken
[59:48] right there
[59:49] before she acted before anything
[59:51] happened the harmony was broken when she
[59:53] stopped accepting her husband's word
[59:57] as soon as she stepped out and said I'm
[59:59] going to think for myself I'm going to
[1:00:01] do this on my own
[1:00:03] that's when it ended that's when it
[1:00:05] changed we know there's a whole bunch of
[1:00:07] different things and you know brothers
[1:00:08] and sisters I can't help but think it's
[1:00:09] the other way around in the in the realm
[1:00:11] that we live the the world that we're in
[1:00:14] now at the farthest end of of time and
[1:00:17] creation from Adam and Eve from that
[1:00:20] timeline you know we're in a place now
[1:00:22] where we need to fight everything that's
[1:00:25] within us I would say as wives to
[1:00:27] surrender our will to our husband's will
[1:00:30] to be in our position and the husbands
[1:00:33] need to do that with their own will to
[1:00:35] be the Bride of Jesus Christ to be in
[1:00:37] their position for the Lord and accept
[1:00:39] his word to be the ultimate for them
[1:00:42] but we know that something happened in
[1:00:44] the garden once that reasoning happened
[1:00:46] Adam stepped out for his wife she was
[1:00:49] deceived but Adam wasn't deceived Adam
[1:00:52] knew exactly what he was doing can you
[1:00:55] imagine that brothers and sisters to
[1:00:57] step out from that Harmony for your wife
[1:01:00] whoo you must have loved her
[1:01:04] I just want to say this and I'm not
[1:01:06] saying anybody wouldn't but how many of
[1:01:08] us as husbands would do that step out
[1:01:10] for our wives today this far down the
[1:01:13] line with this much polluted DNA
[1:01:15] how many of us would do that knowing
[1:01:17] that God could just get us another one
[1:01:20] how many times do we hear that even in a
[1:01:22] message it's okay to get divorced you
[1:01:24] can just get divorced if you're divorced
[1:01:25] you can just get remarried again because
[1:01:27] of this reason and because of this quote
[1:01:29] and because of this angle really
[1:01:32] I don't know
[1:01:34] I don't want to do that I shouldn't do
[1:01:36] that I apologize
[1:01:39] Christ wasn't deceived either was he
[1:01:43] he came and he stepped out and that's
[1:01:45] what dupe Satan I just I'll say it again
[1:01:47] how holy was God how holy is God how
[1:01:50] holy was Jesus Christ standing before
[1:01:52] God when when God would come down and
[1:01:55] express himself in a Manger in as a baby
[1:01:59] as a human being to condescend how far
[1:02:02] was that condescension I think one day
[1:02:04] maybe we'll begin to consciously
[1:02:07] understand that but it's just amazing
[1:02:09] and the reason for it was for the love
[1:02:12] of his bride when his bride Adam stepped
[1:02:15] out and said you know what I can't let
[1:02:17] my wife go I can't let her go because I
[1:02:18] love her she's a part of me
[1:02:21] I've got to go after her
[1:02:24] isn't it wonderful that that's exactly
[1:02:26] what God has done and in our scripture
[1:02:29] tonight we can see that that that he he
[1:02:31] has chosen Us in him before the
[1:02:34] foundation of the world
[1:02:37] to be holy and Without Blame
[1:02:40] you know I just can't help but think
[1:02:41] about all that Adam lost
[1:02:44] we know that it's been restored in the
[1:02:45] day in which we live in
[1:02:47] all that Adam lost has been restored
[1:02:51] and this is out of the fundamental
[1:02:52] foundation for faith in
[1:02:54] 1955 not 65. what about him says an Adam
[1:02:58] never had to be sick
[1:03:00] talk about this harmony a little bit in
[1:03:02] the garden he never had to be sick he
[1:03:04] never had to die
[1:03:06] he never had to worry
[1:03:08] he never had a heartache
[1:03:11] he never had a fear
[1:03:14] I heard a brother I think it was brother
[1:03:16] Donnie Reagan talk about this if
[1:03:17] nobody's heard it I I it's unreal the
[1:03:20] way he says it can you imagine what it
[1:03:22] would have been like that first moment
[1:03:24] that very first moment when Adam had
[1:03:26] that very first Rush of adrenaline in
[1:03:29] his body
[1:03:30] because of fear
[1:03:32] he had never experienced it it was a
[1:03:34] brand new thing he'd never ever
[1:03:36] experienced fear but when that fear
[1:03:39] happened suddenly the adrenaline just
[1:03:41] totally took over his body what that
[1:03:44] would have been like it was so strong it
[1:03:46] caused them to go and hide from God from
[1:03:48] their husband from their dad from his
[1:03:50] daddy the one that he could just climb
[1:03:51] up in his knees and ask him anything
[1:03:53] suddenly he's running and hiding
[1:03:57] he never had to die he never had to
[1:03:59] worry he never had heartache he never
[1:04:02] had fear
[1:04:04] he just climbed up in the arms of the
[1:04:06] father and just like a child everything
[1:04:09] was his
[1:04:10] whatever he asked why he just got it
[1:04:13] everything obeyed him because he was
[1:04:15] God's child
[1:04:17] and the child is heir of all things
[1:04:21] now when man fell he lost this and now
[1:04:23] what he lost in the fall Christ come as
[1:04:27] a redeemer did you ever stop to think of
[1:04:29] what Christ redeemed us for
[1:04:32] he gave us eternal life he brought us
[1:04:34] back to the Eternal fellowship and
[1:04:37] relationship to God to be his sons and
[1:04:40] daughters again to restore back all that
[1:04:42] Adam lost in the fall
[1:04:46] I just think that's beautiful
[1:04:49] now there's some people I know that
[1:04:50] would say well you know what it didn't
[1:04:51] take a profit to come and say that and
[1:04:54] maybe it didn't
[1:04:55] but maybe it did
[1:04:57] maybe it took someone with a prophetic
[1:04:59] insight to be able to put this together
[1:05:01] because who else is saying this in in
[1:05:03] the history of mankind
[1:05:05] everyone else is saying you know what if
[1:05:07] you just do what I tell you to do
[1:05:09] everything will be fine just take
[1:05:11] communion the way we take communion just
[1:05:12] do what we do and everything will be
[1:05:14] good
[1:05:15] it's not so
[1:05:17] unless you come according to the word of
[1:05:19] God
[1:05:20] all things that Adam lost are not
[1:05:21] restored
[1:05:23] to you
[1:05:25] brother Branham he goes on to say now
[1:05:26] the thing of it is since he has restored
[1:05:28] man back to his place man in the fall
[1:05:31] has lost his consciousness of what
[1:05:34] father put him here on Earth to do
[1:05:37] in other words
[1:05:39] all of the plumbing as it was in our
[1:05:41] brain and in the outlets the faith has
[1:05:45] been clogged up
[1:05:46] with business affair with home life
[1:05:49] domestic things it's all become so
[1:05:53] clogged clogged up with that until God
[1:05:56] can't operate through those channels
[1:05:59] that he made a man for
[1:06:04] he's caused us to be those channels
[1:06:06] brothers and sisters he created us in
[1:06:08] him
[1:06:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:10] chosen in him to be holy and Without
[1:06:13] Blame so that we could be those channels
[1:06:15] for him to operate through but that's
[1:06:18] the trick of the devil is to get us so
[1:06:19] busy and so distracted with everything
[1:06:21] in this life that we can no longer have
[1:06:23] access to those channels and you know
[1:06:26] some might say brother Barry that's easy
[1:06:27] for you to say because you don't have a
[1:06:29] job now I I don't actually have a
[1:06:31] physical employee now that's correct but
[1:06:34] I'll tell you what I did I did it for
[1:06:36] years and I'll say it this way I did it
[1:06:39] in such a way that I was not very smart
[1:06:41] I didn't listen to the instruction of my
[1:06:43] parents I disobeyed my parents I didn't
[1:06:45] run away but I didn't go to school and I
[1:06:47] understood the only way that I was going
[1:06:49] to get anything was to work and to work
[1:06:51] hard so I had better Pony up and and
[1:06:54] work my my my fingers to the Bone and so
[1:06:58] I did that brothers and sisters I
[1:07:00] understand what hard work is I
[1:07:01] understand what it means to get clogged
[1:07:03] up in the channels with the cares of
[1:07:05] this life I 100 understand that and I
[1:07:09] think that God allowed me to do so much
[1:07:11] in certain ways that I will never be
[1:07:13] able to forget that so that that's not
[1:07:15] even going to be really a discussion I
[1:07:17] understand it but that's why I'm trying
[1:07:18] to say it tonight to us That these
[1:07:20] channels can get clogged up but that's
[1:07:22] why we come to church and that's why we
[1:07:24] gather together in the name of the Lord
[1:07:26] Jesus Christ so we can run some
[1:07:28] Roto-Rooter through those drains to try
[1:07:31] and unclog the channels a little bit and
[1:07:33] the more the channels get on clogged
[1:07:34] brothers and sisters the more success we
[1:07:37] see of the spirit in our lives the more
[1:07:38] we're going to want to unclear those
[1:07:40] channels the more we're going to
[1:07:41] recognize the spiritual Amnesia that
[1:07:43] we're experiencing
[1:07:45] brother random talks about an experience
[1:07:48] spiritual Amnesia if you listen to that
[1:07:50] message that's totally off off base for
[1:07:52] what we're talking about but I just
[1:07:54] listen now to a lot of messages and and
[1:07:56] that's one of them that it kind of talks
[1:07:58] about this in in a different way but we
[1:08:00] can forget about our position
[1:08:02] and that's what brother Branham says
[1:08:04] here tonight we read that quote it's the
[1:08:06] the the most difficult thing for the
[1:08:08] church in the age in which we live in
[1:08:10] she doesn't remember her position but if
[1:08:12] we can remember our position brothers
[1:08:13] and sisters that Satan belongs under our
[1:08:16] feet and if he's anywhere else in our
[1:08:17] lives brothers and sisters he's out of
[1:08:19] his position but we have been given
[1:08:21] Authority we don't have any power of our
[1:08:23] own brother Bradham talks about it we
[1:08:25] can we can have all of the authority
[1:08:28] that we allow the Lord to work through
[1:08:30] in our lives but we've got no power it's
[1:08:33] only Authority you know brother Branham
[1:08:36] uses that example of the policeman
[1:08:37] standing there you can have a car worth
[1:08:39] 400 horsepower and raging down the road
[1:08:42] it's going and you know that policeman
[1:08:45] can go on stand out on the street and
[1:08:46] raise up his hand and say stop and it
[1:08:49] doesn't mean anything does it
[1:08:51] but if that policeman takes out his
[1:08:53] badge his badge that token he can show
[1:08:55] that token and say stop because there's
[1:08:59] Authority behind that badge that person
[1:09:01] driving the car knows that he better
[1:09:03] stop because if he doesn't he'll be in
[1:09:06] big trouble
[1:09:07] but all all of the plumbing as it was in
[1:09:10] our brain and the outlets of of the
[1:09:12] faith have been clogged up with the
[1:09:13] business affair with a home life
[1:09:15] domestic things it's all become so
[1:09:17] clogged up until God can't operate
[1:09:19] through those channels that he made man
[1:09:22] for now when God made the human body
[1:09:24] every little part had its place to play
[1:09:26] the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose
[1:09:29] God has everything in there to make it
[1:09:31] perfect in operation to make man to live
[1:09:34] and if God so patterned the man the body
[1:09:38] of a man how much more has he patterned
[1:09:41] and said in order the body of Christ the
[1:09:43] church
[1:09:44] I just think it's beautiful brothers and
[1:09:46] sisters
[1:09:48] you've been given Authority we haven't
[1:09:50] been given power we have no power
[1:09:53] we've been given Authority though
[1:09:57] you know in the seventh seal brother
[1:09:58] Branham says in a different way
[1:10:00] and then just then a voice shook down
[1:10:03] through there
[1:10:04] That Rock The Rock said
[1:10:06] it's the sword of the king
[1:10:10] and then I come out of it
[1:10:12] the sword of the king now if it said a
[1:10:15] sword of a king but it said the sword of
[1:10:19] the king and there was only one king and
[1:10:22] that's God and he has one sword and
[1:10:24] that's his word what I've lived by
[1:10:27] that so help me God standing over his
[1:10:30] holy desk here with this holy word
[1:10:33] laying here it's the word amen oh what a
[1:10:36] day we're living in what a great thing
[1:10:38] see the mystery and the secret
[1:10:41] and he goes on to say the third poll
[1:10:43] but you know brothers and sisters
[1:10:45] tonight I just mentioned that because I
[1:10:47] want to remind us that all that Adam
[1:10:49] lost has been restored but it's not the
[1:10:52] way that maybe we would want to think
[1:10:54] about as we think about this and the
[1:10:56] harmony that we talked about in the
[1:10:58] Garden of Eden and how beautiful it was
[1:10:59] and maybe how there was no rain and
[1:11:02] probably no thunder or lightning it was
[1:11:05] all just gently misted throughout the
[1:11:07] night and everything grew so Lush and
[1:11:10] green and it was just perfect harmony
[1:11:11] all the birds everything was wonderful
[1:11:15] that's not what we're talking about
[1:11:17] having a restoration to what we are
[1:11:19] talking about having a restoration to is
[1:11:21] the word of God and when brother Branham
[1:11:23] tells that story about the sword of the
[1:11:25] king there is only one sword and that's
[1:11:28] his word he says that it's his word that
[1:11:30] has been restored to Mankind and his
[1:11:33] word is what will take us to that
[1:11:35] Perfection that we're going to we will
[1:11:37] see that kind of perfection brothers and
[1:11:39] sisters it's coming there is a
[1:11:42] restoration of all things that's coming
[1:11:44] we're going to live on this Earth in a
[1:11:48] restored condition that was one of the
[1:11:50] threefold purpose was to restore all
[1:11:52] things to restore the kingdom and and
[1:11:55] that's what's going to happen but you
[1:11:57] know Hebrews 4 12 says for the word of
[1:11:59] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:12:01] than any two-edged
[1:12:03] sword
[1:12:05] and what does it do
[1:12:08] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:12:10] Soul and Spirit
[1:12:12] exactly what happened in the meetings of
[1:12:15] William Mary and Branham and I just
[1:12:17] think it's beautiful because I know it's
[1:12:19] exactly what happens when we get in a
[1:12:21] room full of Believers that have sang
[1:12:23] the songs of Zion and call upon the name
[1:12:26] of the Lord when a minister Gets behind
[1:12:28] the pulpit it doesn't matter who it is
[1:12:29] when you get a group of Believers
[1:12:31] together pulling on the word of God it's
[1:12:33] the same word of God it doesn't take a
[1:12:35] prophet to come and discern the thoughts
[1:12:37] that are in the heart with the sword of
[1:12:39] the word
[1:12:41] it's piercing even to the dividing
[1:12:43] asunder of Soul and Spirit into the
[1:12:45] joints and Marrow and is a discerner of
[1:12:47] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:12:49] heart that sword has been placed back in
[1:12:52] the hands of men again brothers and
[1:12:54] sisters and it's not for gain it's not
[1:12:57] for personal gain and many times people
[1:12:59] might say it you know you had a
[1:13:01] conversation with somebody so you know
[1:13:02] that I want to say did did someone
[1:13:04] really have a conversation with somebody
[1:13:05] or was it the spirit of God Discerning
[1:13:08] your thoughts Discerning your
[1:13:09] conversation remember the syrians the
[1:13:12] king of Syria were saying who's talking
[1:13:13] who's the the rat who's who's telling
[1:13:16] everyone what we're doing our secrets
[1:13:18] our battle plans and it was one of the
[1:13:21] wise men that he had there he said you
[1:13:22] know what there's a prophet in the land
[1:13:23] and that's what the problem is you need
[1:13:25] to you need to go and talk to that guy
[1:13:26] get get some words from him because he's
[1:13:29] the one that's Discerning the thoughts
[1:13:30] and it's not even him it's just his God
[1:13:32] you know that's the same Spirit brothers
[1:13:35] and sisters that we're dealing with here
[1:13:36] and who is dealing with us better not us
[1:13:39] dealing with him but he's he's dealing
[1:13:42] with us and you know he has blessed us
[1:13:44] with all spiritual blessings I think
[1:13:46] it's so important for us to remember
[1:13:48] that it's not something that we need to
[1:13:50] overlook and maybe just just take for
[1:13:52] granted blessed be the God and father of
[1:13:54] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[1:13:56] us with all spiritual blessings where at
[1:14:00] brothers and sisters in Heavenly places
[1:14:02] but where's the Heavenly places
[1:14:05] the last word of this verse is in Christ
[1:14:09] if you want your your your all spiritual
[1:14:12] blessings it's in Christ and where is
[1:14:15] Christ today brothers and sisters it's
[1:14:17] this book but we have to eat this book
[1:14:20] if we eat this book then Christ is going
[1:14:23] to be blessing us with all spiritual
[1:14:25] blessings in us because we will actually
[1:14:29] have Christ in US but if we never eat
[1:14:32] the book then how are we ever going to
[1:14:33] get Christ in us just coming to church
[1:14:35] on its own ain't enough it's not enough
[1:14:38] you got to be like John and eat the book
[1:14:40] when you eat the book your spirit is
[1:14:43] going to love it but yours your body is
[1:14:45] just gonna detest it it's so hard to
[1:14:48] read the book to take the time to have
[1:14:50] devotions
[1:14:51] but take the time
[1:14:53] set aside a little bit of time just do
[1:14:55] that just eat the book If You Can Eat
[1:14:57] the book there is a real spiritual
[1:15:01] blessing that comes to us I just love
[1:15:04] that that thought tonight about the the
[1:15:06] harmony that existed in the Garden of
[1:15:08] Eden and you know I I just want to say
[1:15:10] it tonight brothers and sisters when
[1:15:12] we're in our positions as husbands as
[1:15:15] wives as children
[1:15:16] as as the church as deacons as trustees
[1:15:21] as Treasurer when we're in our positions
[1:15:24] there is a Harmony that exists and you
[1:15:28] know we might not actually see a Harmony
[1:15:32] where we're walking hand in hand singing
[1:15:35] Onward Christian Soldiers what we're not
[1:15:38] talking about that kind of Harmony we're
[1:15:40] talking about the harmony of the word in
[1:15:42] our lives and I think I could take a
[1:15:44] whole series on the harmony of the word
[1:15:46] to think about the the power of that but
[1:15:49] you know brothers and sisters the
[1:15:50] harmony that existed in the Garden of
[1:15:52] Eden is now existing in The Bride of
[1:15:55] Jesus Christ in in the mystical body of
[1:15:58] Jesus Christ it's not and a specific
[1:16:00] geographical location on this Earth it's
[1:16:02] as the lightning travels from the East
[1:16:04] to the West that's that's what's
[1:16:06] happening with the spirit of the Lord
[1:16:08] right now
[1:16:09] the day in which we live brother Branham
[1:16:12] he says this these notable words and and
[1:16:14] we've heard it all I know we have but I
[1:16:16] just want to remind us about our
[1:16:18] position in Christ brothers and sisters
[1:16:19] as we follow this word as we eat the
[1:16:21] book as we just keep pressing on towards
[1:16:24] that Mark or the prize of the High
[1:16:25] Calling of God in Christ Jesus as we
[1:16:27] keep doing that and not letting anything
[1:16:29] Shake us from our position in Christ
[1:16:32] brother Branham he's got words the Holy
[1:16:35] Spirit has words through his Prophet for
[1:16:37] us he says the members of the Virgin
[1:16:39] bride will love him
[1:16:41] and remember the only way that we're
[1:16:43] going to be a bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:16:45] to be a virgin to him and the only way
[1:16:47] that we're going to be a virgin to him
[1:16:48] is to not let any other word get in the
[1:16:50] way not let anybody come to reason with
[1:16:53] us and say you know I I know this this
[1:16:56] was said but it was really meant that
[1:16:58] any of that none of it just like Eve in
[1:17:01] the beginning when we talked about when
[1:17:02] when the serpent came and gave her the
[1:17:04] ability to do some some some critical
[1:17:07] thinking about the word of her husband
[1:17:11] this word
[1:17:13] when we accept it it causes us to be a
[1:17:16] virgin to it as well but only the people
[1:17:18] who have been chosen in him before the
[1:17:20] foundation of the world will be able to
[1:17:21] it's just the way it is
[1:17:23] the members of the Virgin bride will
[1:17:25] love him and they will have his
[1:17:26] potentials
[1:17:29] they will have his potentials they will
[1:17:31] discern
[1:17:32] they will be able to encourage they will
[1:17:35] be able to heal they will be able to
[1:17:38] drink any deadly thing and it won't harm
[1:17:40] them
[1:17:42] it's the way it is they will have his
[1:17:44] potentials for he is their head and all
[1:17:48] power belongs to him
[1:17:51] outside of him brothers and sisters it's
[1:17:53] satanic isn't it
[1:17:55] to have power in this life without
[1:17:57] character and and character there's only
[1:18:00] one character let's just be frank about
[1:18:02] that there's only one character and that
[1:18:04] character is the word of God the word of
[1:18:06] God character brothers and sisters is
[1:18:08] the only thing that we want anything to
[1:18:10] do with but when we have that character
[1:18:12] in our lives all power belongs to him
[1:18:15] when he's in us we have his potential
[1:18:17] they are subject to him as the members
[1:18:20] of our bodies are subject to our heads
[1:18:24] this is the part that brought me to this
[1:18:26] he says notice the harmony of the father
[1:18:28] and the son
[1:18:29] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:18:31] first shown him by the father
[1:18:33] John 5 19 this harmony is now to exist
[1:18:36] between the groom and his bride
[1:18:38] if you ever want to wonder about what
[1:18:40] that means
[1:18:41] um it's not like we're just gonna have a
[1:18:44] vision from Heaven God's Not Just Gonna
[1:18:46] lightning bolt a vision into our heart
[1:18:48] to see what the father wants done this
[1:18:52] is where it's critical for us to know
[1:18:53] the word of God because when we have
[1:18:55] eaten this book we might not always
[1:18:57] remember it we might not be able to
[1:18:58] quote the scriptures but let me assure
[1:19:00] you if you eat the book genuinely ask
[1:19:03] God to reveal it to you
[1:19:05] what will happen is the word will come
[1:19:07] back to you we know the word of God says
[1:19:09] take no thought for what you should say
[1:19:11] in that hour right and and we know for
[1:19:14] certain there's times where that word
[1:19:16] will just come to us the word of God
[1:19:18] that we have eaten it will just rise to
[1:19:20] the surface and we'll be like why am I
[1:19:22] thinking this what is that and you know
[1:19:23] we can just go at that point and look it
[1:19:25] up and then you'll say wow that's the
[1:19:28] word that came to my heart and this is
[1:19:30] the scripture that it's from you know
[1:19:33] what happens that's the word of God
[1:19:34] Discerning our thoughts that's the
[1:19:36] harmony between the father and the son
[1:19:39] right there he says notice the harmony
[1:19:41] of the father and the son Jesus never
[1:19:42] did anything until it was first showed
[1:19:45] him by the Father John 5 19. his word is
[1:19:48] the word it's our word that's me
[1:19:51] speaking here brother Brown I'm going on
[1:19:53] he says this harmony is now to exist
[1:19:54] between the groom and his bride he shows
[1:19:57] her his Word of Life she receives it she
[1:20:00] never doubts it
[1:20:02] Eve doubted it didn't she she said yeah
[1:20:05] I'll accept somebody else's word and
[1:20:07] I'll I'll maybe challenge that I'll
[1:20:08] entertain that but she doesn't the Bride
[1:20:11] of Jesus Christ doesn't she never doubts
[1:20:13] it therefore nothing can harm her not
[1:20:15] even death
[1:20:16] this is where I want to say you know I
[1:20:18] believe believers they don't get afraid
[1:20:20] they just say hey you know what God
[1:20:22] wants to change my dwelling place that's
[1:20:23] all he's got a better body that's
[1:20:25] already waiting for me if he wants to
[1:20:26] lay me down with cancer in a bed or or
[1:20:29] wind up in a car crash or something
[1:20:31] happens if if it has to happen that way
[1:20:34] then that's God's choice there's no
[1:20:35] accidental death in this world it
[1:20:38] doesn't happen
[1:20:39] it's only because God allows it she
[1:20:42] receives it she never doubts it
[1:20:43] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:20:45] death
[1:20:46] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:20:48] will raise it up again and what will
[1:20:51] water it brothers and sisters it's the
[1:20:52] word the only thing is the word
[1:20:56] there's the word that's the seed and
[1:20:58] then the spirit of Christ
[1:21:00] Waters that seed for the seed will be
[1:21:02] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:21:04] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:21:06] in the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[1:21:08] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:21:12] what he wants done with the word
[1:21:15] how many wives know
[1:21:17] what the husband wants done with his
[1:21:19] word
[1:21:21] I just was thinking about that today
[1:21:22] it's such an amazing thing we were
[1:21:25] talking about a little while ago it was
[1:21:26] just a funny little thing but we we
[1:21:28] witnessed a wife that was just doing
[1:21:30] things for her husband and he wasn't
[1:21:31] even asking her and and we were like man
[1:21:34] look at that she's just doing what that
[1:21:37] husband would like she just knows what
[1:21:39] would please her husband and so she's
[1:21:41] just doing it because she knows that's
[1:21:43] his word
[1:21:44] he's not always saying to her oh you got
[1:21:47] to do this or you got to do that or you
[1:21:48] got to do this or you got to do that and
[1:21:49] I you know here I am talking like this
[1:21:51] now brother Barry he's gonna get a a
[1:21:54] plug for the husbands tonight I'm not
[1:21:55] looking to do that brothers and sisters
[1:21:57] I'm trying to bring it from a spiritual
[1:21:58] context but remember we've talked about
[1:22:00] the positions and knowing that that
[1:22:03] there's there's ways we need to behave
[1:22:04] in in our world in our lives
[1:22:07] the wife wants to please the husband
[1:22:10] and if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:12] then you're his wife and you want to
[1:22:14] please your husband we want to please
[1:22:16] our husband we don't want to wait for
[1:22:18] him to try and push us down the two
[1:22:19] brother Bradham talks about that that's
[1:22:21] one of the problems with the church just
[1:22:22] waiting for God to show me what to do
[1:22:24] show me what to do just go walk go March
[1:22:27] forward by faith and see if he won't
[1:22:29] direct your path
[1:22:31] because that's according to his word
[1:22:33] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:22:35] in the bride as it wasn't Mary the bride
[1:22:36] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:22:38] what he wants done with the word she
[1:22:40] performs the command of the word in his
[1:22:43] name for she has thus saith the Lord
[1:22:48] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:22:50] and it comes to pass
[1:22:52] and see brothers and sisters
[1:22:54] we can read that and say well I've seen
[1:22:57] things in my life where I've prayed and
[1:22:59] I've spoken the word and hasn't come to
[1:23:01] pass the way that I've desired I've
[1:23:03] prayed and and spoken the word hasn't
[1:23:05] come to pass and the reason for that is
[1:23:07] not because of you is because of God
[1:23:09] it's not exactly the way God wants it
[1:23:11] done
[1:23:12] or it would come to pass the way that we
[1:23:14] have wanted it to
[1:23:19] I believe it just comes to the place
[1:23:20] where we need to know that it's not our
[1:23:23] will not my will Lord but let thy will
[1:23:25] be done
[1:23:26] on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:23:28] it's got to be according to his will
[1:23:32] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:23:34] and it comes to pass
[1:23:36] like a seed that's planted and watered
[1:23:38] it comes to full Harvest serving its
[1:23:40] purpose
[1:23:41] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:23:43] one can make them do otherwise
[1:23:46] they have thus saith the Lord or they
[1:23:47] keep still
[1:23:49] they know that it has to be God in them
[1:23:52] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:23:56] and and so I just want to mention that
[1:23:58] paragraph I think I do it every time but
[1:24:00] I just want to continually do it I want
[1:24:02] to make sure that we just stick together
[1:24:04] with this they have thus saith the Lord
[1:24:07] or they keep still and and you either
[1:24:09] have the word of God or you don't
[1:24:12] when you have the word of God you have
[1:24:13] thus saith the Lord this is thus saith
[1:24:16] the Lord this is that word that the the
[1:24:19] sword that was placed back into the
[1:24:21] hands of the Prophet so it could be an
[1:24:23] example of it being placed back into the
[1:24:25] hands of mankind some people don't have
[1:24:27] thus saith the Lord brothers and sisters
[1:24:29] and that's why they keep still
[1:24:33] and I would say this
[1:24:35] that if the bride the true elect bride
[1:24:37] of Jesus Christ has an idea that comes
[1:24:40] to her mind and it doesn't line up with
[1:24:42] the word she'll keep still too
[1:24:46] but if it lines up with the word you got
[1:24:48] no reason to keep still brothers and
[1:24:49] sisters there's no reason at all for us
[1:24:52] to keep still just like Joshua and Caleb
[1:24:54] they they were told to go forwards and
[1:24:57] and be strong and very courageous don't
[1:24:59] don't don't turn to the right hand or to
[1:25:01] the left hand just keep going the way
[1:25:02] you're going because you believe the
[1:25:04] word for your day
[1:25:06] they have thus saith the Lord and they
[1:25:08] keep still they know it has to be God in
[1:25:10] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:25:12] word
[1:25:13] it's outside of the word it's someone
[1:25:15] else's word brothers and sisters he did
[1:25:17] not complete all his work while in his
[1:25:20] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:25:24] through the bride
[1:25:26] I I just love this this really struck me
[1:25:29] tonight
[1:25:30] she knows that
[1:25:33] she knows that
[1:25:35] such a simple statement do you know that
[1:25:37] tonight brothers and sisters we're
[1:25:39] fulfilling the end time Prophecy of the
[1:25:42] world
[1:25:43] she knows that
[1:25:45] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:25:47] certain things that he must do now
[1:25:51] and if you remember this what I'm
[1:25:53] reading here someone might say well it's
[1:25:54] out of the programian church age and
[1:25:56] just out of the church age book brother
[1:25:57] Branham take some time to express it
[1:25:59] that I was just pondering one night and
[1:26:01] the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said
[1:26:03] pick up your pen and write
[1:26:05] this is a message that I want your your
[1:26:08] pen to put to paper because this is
[1:26:11] going to go forwards to a group of
[1:26:13] people that are going to say Amen to
[1:26:14] this word this was the Holy Ghost
[1:26:16] speaking here brothers and sisters not
[1:26:17] just a man talking about things this is
[1:26:20] God sending a direct message for his
[1:26:23] bride he did not complete all his
[1:26:25] Earthly work while in his Earthly
[1:26:28] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:26:30] the bride she knows that for it was not
[1:26:32] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:26:34] that he must now do but he will now
[1:26:36] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:26:39] which he left for this specific time
[1:26:42] this is the exposition of the seven
[1:26:45] Church ages the pergamian church age I
[1:26:48] just think it's beautiful brothers and
[1:26:49] sisters because she knows that she just
[1:26:52] knows that there was there was stuff
[1:26:53] that needed to be finished there was
[1:26:55] there was scripture that needed to be
[1:26:56] fulfilled there needed to be a people
[1:26:58] that didn't actually go by the way of
[1:27:00] the Grave there needed to be people here
[1:27:02] that just believe the word of God with
[1:27:04] all of their heart even though they'd
[1:27:06] never met Jesus they'd never followed a
[1:27:08] Ministry they never even met William
[1:27:10] Miriam Branham but something inside this
[1:27:12] word that was stored up it just caused
[1:27:15] them to say Amen from their innermost
[1:27:16] being there's something about this word
[1:27:18] there had to be a people to fulfill that
[1:27:21] part of scripture
[1:27:23] the brothers and sisters we've been
[1:27:25] given all spiritual blessings and and I
[1:27:27] just want to say it this way if we can
[1:27:29] just recognize that all spiritual
[1:27:31] blessings tonight it's not about having
[1:27:33] uh uh God bless my bank account and God
[1:27:36] gave me a job and and God gave me this
[1:27:39] and and brought me there and and did
[1:27:41] this other wonderful thing for me
[1:27:43] brothers and sisters the spiritual
[1:27:44] blessings all of the spiritual blessings
[1:27:46] are right here this is all the spiritual
[1:27:49] blessings in Heavenly places because
[1:27:51] this is the only thing that's going to
[1:27:52] heaven outside of our character is God's
[1:27:55] word we're not taking any bit of this
[1:27:56] world with us brothers and sisters it's
[1:27:59] only his word remember one time in our
[1:28:02] lives out of Ephesians chapter 2 verse
[1:28:04] 11 wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:28:06] time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are
[1:28:09] called uncircumcision by which is called
[1:28:12] the circumcision in the flesh made by
[1:28:13] hands that at that time ye were without
[1:28:17] Christ being aliens from the
[1:28:20] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:28:22] from the covenants of Promise having no
[1:28:24] hope and without God in the world
[1:28:27] that's where we were brothers and
[1:28:29] sisters without this message of the hour
[1:28:32] we could receive something else for our
[1:28:34] day but would it have satisfied us I
[1:28:36] doubt it otherwise why are we here
[1:28:39] tonight
[1:28:40] there's no way that would have been
[1:28:42] enough for us
[1:28:44] verse 13 says but now in Christ Jesus ye
[1:28:47] who sometimes were far off
[1:28:51] are made nigh by the blood of Christ we
[1:28:54] have been drawn in him from before the
[1:28:57] foundation of the world to be holy and
[1:29:00] Without Blame he chose us in him before
[1:29:03] the foundation of the world I so want to
[1:29:04] get into verse 5. I could probably say
[1:29:07] it and and we could come back to it
[1:29:08] later on he's he's predestinated having
[1:29:11] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:29:13] children he's chosen us to be those ones
[1:29:17] that can go and crawl back up in his lap
[1:29:19] and talk to our daddy and say what about
[1:29:22] this and what about that and how do we
[1:29:24] do that brothers and sisters by reading
[1:29:25] the word of God and going on our knees
[1:29:28] just picture that going on your knees
[1:29:30] you're not going on your knees on the
[1:29:31] hard concrete floor or on your soft
[1:29:33] beautiful
[1:29:35] carpet floor you're going and crawling
[1:29:37] up in Daddy's knees and saying Lord I
[1:29:40] want to spend some time with you I want
[1:29:42] you to whisper in my ear I want you to
[1:29:44] tell me things that I don't know I want
[1:29:46] you to tell me the things that I need to
[1:29:48] know I want to hear your voice in my ear
[1:29:51] I don't want to just say that oh it's
[1:29:54] impossible for God to for God to speak
[1:29:56] to man for men to be able to hear God
[1:29:58] that's that's for some people some
[1:30:01] people can't hear that voice but others
[1:30:02] brothers and sisters we know other
[1:30:04] people can hear the voice of God and
[1:30:06] once you've heard the voice of God you
[1:30:08] won't hear any other voice there's no
[1:30:10] other voice that we want to hear boy oh
[1:30:12] boy and that's what causes us to be here
[1:30:14] in in a in a weird little message church
[1:30:17] that's what causes it to happen is God
[1:30:20] speaks to us personally that's what the
[1:30:22] new birth is that's what it's all about
[1:30:24] but brothers and sisters we are in
[1:30:26] Heavenly places and we know Romans
[1:30:29] chapter 8 I'll just maybe read that that
[1:30:32] first verse and and how do we get there
[1:30:34] in in in Christ how do we get into
[1:30:38] Heavenly places in Christ it's just such
[1:30:40] a beautiful thing
[1:30:42] I just had it on my heart so strong the
[1:30:44] last few weeks I just have to express it
[1:30:47] and maybe then I can move on to
[1:30:49] something else but you know Romans
[1:30:51] chapter 8 verse 1 is is a change of gear
[1:30:54] from Romans chapter 7 the end of chapter
[1:30:56] seven it's so easy to get caught up in
[1:30:58] Romans chapter 7 as as human beings in
[1:31:01] this flesh condition knowing that we're
[1:31:03] dealing with the hybrid condition we can
[1:31:05] get so caught up in looking at what kind
[1:31:07] of a man am I I never seem to be able to
[1:31:10] overcome my problems and my issues and
[1:31:12] these things that just continually seem
[1:31:14] to Badger me and dog dog me down but you
[1:31:17] know we just need to just flip the page
[1:31:19] turn to that next chapter don't give up
[1:31:23] even though it's a dark night and a hard
[1:31:25] time in our lives brothers and sisters
[1:31:27] keep pressing on go to the morning
[1:31:30] because the sun will rise tomorrow and
[1:31:32] when you get to Romans chapter 8 verse 1
[1:31:34] there is therefore now not in the future
[1:31:37] and not yesterday right now no
[1:31:40] condemnation to them that what that are
[1:31:43] in Christ Jesus that like to crawl up on
[1:31:45] Daddy's lap that like to read his word
[1:31:48] and eat his book those people those are
[1:31:50] the ones who walk not after the flesh
[1:31:52] but after the spirit don't be looking at
[1:31:54] the flesh don't look at your flesh don't
[1:31:56] look at the faults and fail of the years
[1:31:58] in you don't look at the faults and
[1:32:00] failures in others
[1:32:02] I was amazed one time in the world when
[1:32:04] when I was living in sin I I was in a
[1:32:08] terrible state
[1:32:09] and I wasn't afraid to just slam people
[1:32:11] behind their backs
[1:32:13] and there was one man he said you know
[1:32:16] we're all a little bit weird in our own
[1:32:18] way aren't we
[1:32:19] and I just thought my goodness
[1:32:21] he's not even a believer he's got no
[1:32:24] Christian anything with him but yet here
[1:32:27] he is saying yeah we are and you know we
[1:32:29] are
[1:32:30] God's created us to be that way don't
[1:32:33] look at the flesh brothers and sisters
[1:32:35] if you are then you're listening to that
[1:32:38] other voice in the Garden of Eden that's
[1:32:40] just trying to give you some reasoning
[1:32:42] just go back to the word of God and
[1:32:44] recognize there's no condemnation to
[1:32:46] those who are not walking after the
[1:32:48] flesh but those who were walking after
[1:32:50] the spirit
[1:32:52] and then brothers and sisters you're
[1:32:54] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:32:56] Jesus that's when you can begin to look
[1:32:57] around and say wow man I'm not seated in
[1:33:00] this world I'm not part of this world
[1:33:01] I'm an alien to this world once upon a
[1:33:04] time I was an alien to heaven but now
[1:33:06] I'm an alien to this world I'm just a
[1:33:08] pilgrim I'm just passing through I'm on
[1:33:10] my way
[1:33:12] you know brother Branham he talks about
[1:33:14] this in in I believe it's in this
[1:33:15] message uh the believer's position in
[1:33:17] Christ he talks about having a dry crop
[1:33:20] the only way that we're going to see the
[1:33:21] Holy Ghost move in our lives brothers
[1:33:23] and sisters is for us to line up with
[1:33:25] the Holy Ghost for us to line up with
[1:33:27] the word and and how are we going to
[1:33:28] line up with the Holy Ghost is to line
[1:33:30] up with the word that's the only way and
[1:33:32] and how are we going to line up with the
[1:33:33] word in our day unless God sends a
[1:33:35] preacher and how is a preacher going to
[1:33:37] know what to say unless God sends a
[1:33:38] prophet because he doesn't just send his
[1:33:40] word to a preacher does he God sends his
[1:33:42] word to the prophet the prophet is the
[1:33:46] one that brings the word to the people
[1:33:48] and that is exactly according to God's
[1:33:50] word I'm not going into that tonight but
[1:33:52] brother Brian he talks about this if
[1:33:54] we're willing to operate within the
[1:33:56] parameters of God's laws of the universe
[1:33:58] then we'll see success but if we're
[1:33:59] trying to do it on our own bring it our
[1:34:01] own way or listen to someone else's
[1:34:03] reasoning we're not going to see the
[1:34:04] success that we want to see he talks
[1:34:06] about it we and I just love how he uses
[1:34:08] a real life example we can have a a crop
[1:34:11] in the ground over here and it could be
[1:34:13] just burning up in the sun just dry as
[1:34:15] all get out and unless we see some water
[1:34:18] in the next little bit it's going to die
[1:34:19] all of my money and my labor is going
[1:34:22] for naught and over here on this other
[1:34:24] side we could have a great Artesian well
[1:34:26] with way more water than we would ever
[1:34:29] need over here and brother Bradham talks
[1:34:31] about in this message he says you could
[1:34:32] scream at it you could shout at it and
[1:34:34] say just water my crop you could jump up
[1:34:36] and down scream and shout and it's not
[1:34:39] going to do a thing
[1:34:40] your crop's gonna keep burning up and
[1:34:42] that water up there is going to keep
[1:34:43] bubbling over and you're going to be
[1:34:45] caught in the middle wondering what to
[1:34:46] do
[1:34:47] but he says boy if you could ever just
[1:34:49] understand the laws of gravity if you
[1:34:52] could ever just understand the laws of
[1:34:54] God's universe and put together a little
[1:34:56] bit of reasoning about it and say well
[1:34:58] if I'm able to get a pipe over there to
[1:35:01] that water and and just get it in the
[1:35:03] right angle to allow gravity to bring it
[1:35:05] down and to go far enough to get to my
[1:35:08] crop I could probably get enough
[1:35:09] pressure in there to put a sprinkler on
[1:35:11] it and allow that crop to get some water
[1:35:13] he says now you're talking because
[1:35:15] you're operating through the parameters
[1:35:17] of God's laws but if we want to try and
[1:35:20] bring the Holy Ghost to operate in our
[1:35:22] position if we're not in the right
[1:35:24] position we're not going to see nothing
[1:35:27] we're going to come to church we're
[1:35:28] going to scream and shout we might even
[1:35:30] pray we might read the word if we're out
[1:35:32] of our positions brothers and sisters
[1:35:34] we're just screaming and shouting we're
[1:35:36] not going to see it happen and our crops
[1:35:38] are going to burn up
[1:35:42] I'll just read it I know I improvised a
[1:35:44] bit I wasn't reading there just for the
[1:35:46] record brother Bradham says it he says
[1:35:48] so you can scream and you can cry and
[1:35:50] you can shout you can run you can speak
[1:35:52] in tongues
[1:35:54] you could jump up and down you could
[1:35:55] sing songs you could preach the gospel
[1:35:58] but until you work in harmony with the
[1:36:00] Holy Ghost
[1:36:01] you'll make yourself hoarse
[1:36:04] and get nowhere he says right you
[1:36:06] believe that
[1:36:07] he says that's right that's a believer's
[1:36:09] the position of a believer in Christ
[1:36:11] 1955-0227a
[1:36:16] I'll call the musicians
[1:36:18] brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:36:20] encourage us we have been chosen to be
[1:36:24] holy and Without Blame
[1:36:26] Satan's trying to tell us no look at you
[1:36:29] you haven't made it yet no no look at
[1:36:31] you you haven't made it to spiritual
[1:36:33] maturity yet no you're not quite in your
[1:36:35] position yet it's just not quite
[1:36:36] happened yet you know what as soon as
[1:36:39] you say Amen to the word brothers and
[1:36:41] sisters it's happened and I want to say
[1:36:43] this he's already said it in his word
[1:36:45] it's already happened before the
[1:36:47] foundation of the world the only thing
[1:36:48] that's going to happen is we're going to
[1:36:50] realize it we're going to recognize it
[1:36:52] brother Branham says it when did you get
[1:36:53] saved was it in that meeting that time
[1:36:55] that place was it tonight was it
[1:36:58] somewhere along the way when did you get
[1:37:00] saved
[1:37:02] but he brings it to our memory only from
[1:37:04] a prophet isn't it beautiful you were
[1:37:07] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:37:09] you didn't just get saved tonight you
[1:37:10] just didn't get saved over there and
[1:37:12] then at that place you just recognized
[1:37:15] it there it's the same thing with this
[1:37:17] what we're talking about tonight
