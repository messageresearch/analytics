they could ask or think Lord Jesus that father when we would get together again we would just have a testimony service about how great our God is Lord we love you and we thank you and we just commit all these needs into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians you have your Bibles this morning i' just like to read from Hebrews chap 11 certainly thankful to be back in service again it's been a while we've had quite a few ministers come through and certainly thankful for the five-fold ministry because that's where the perfecting of the Saints are it's not just in in in one of the five that's not where the Perfection lies even though there's lies that say there is we know the Perfections in the five full ministry and we're certainly thankful for each one amen Hebrews chap 11 maybe we'll just start reading with verse one I had one verse verse six that I wanted to get to but we'll just we'll just read one to six now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh isn't that rich God testified of his gifts yes verse five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death right and was not found because God had translated him or before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word amen thank you for the so very many nuggets that are contained in this word Lord we're so thankful that you've given us the ability by your spirit Lord to read between the lines father we just ask that you would take this word that we've read this morning and that father it wouldn't just be print on a page it wouldn't just be words in our ears but Lord it would be a living word in our hearts Lord father that it would consume our very Souls Lord Jesus that this word would become so encompassing in our lives father that this is what we would live and breathe to this world around us Lord father we love you and we thank you we just commit every single word now as we go forwards into your hands Lord yes just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a couple of announcements before we get going here we have brother Cadre Diggs next weekend he will be here um Saturday night at 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning with a youth event to follow on uh on Sunday after the service we have uh we have have the the month of December upon us and I've been thinking about it and and just praying about it and wondering what we should do and uh I just felt this year I don't ever want to get stuck in a tradition or a routine or a rut that's a religion and I don't want to do that and uh I don't know if I heard it said before but or or I mentioned it before but I heard a brother talking about it you know when you're training your body you don't want to do the same exercise every single time or your body will not strengthen to its full capacity but when you change things up the body actually gets the strongest that it's ever going to go so in light of that and and just the way I felt led to go this year we're not going to have a watch Night Service but what I want to do is encourage everyone to Fellowship I know that so many people have the desire to fellowship and uh we just want to create the opportunity for that because the way Services fall we're going to have regular Services both Sundays so we'll just see what the Lord will do and uh we'll resume the communion service the watch Night Service in January I trust that's okay with everyone um if not by all means just come and talk to me and uh you know we can talk about it today I want to talk about our senses I want to talk about our senses and I've got uh I feel a tremendous inspiration from the message a super sense from 1959 and we could just jump right to the punch line and I probably will um just so you know where I'm going with it and and that super sense is is not just the ability to believe and it's not just the ability to have faith and it's not just the ability to come to church and and to see that God sent a prophet it is all of that but it's none of that what what it is is the Holy Ghost that's the super sense that we're going to get to today that we're going to point to all service long and and every service is the Holy Ghost because just like Noah preached for how many years did he preach uh 125 years get in the boat he had nothing else to say just get in the boat it's going to rain but everyone wanted to depend on their natural senses and their scientific reasoning and and their brain power and the ability that they had to study and and understand things naturally and they said it wasn't going to rain there's no rain we can prove there's no rain scientifically you're a quack remember brother bradam said he must have been must have the old bald head up on the hill must have got sunstroke beaten on the wood saying it's going to rain but what happened one day God said now it's time for you to get in the ark and you would think that these people I've marveled at this at times and I'm sure you have as well but you would think the people in that day would have said you know Noah said that it's going to rain and somehow this guy has the ability to capture the attention of two of every single living creature with breath in their lungs to get in that boat how does that work nobody seemed to question it or maybe they did but still they didn't have the ability to believe isn't that weird but yet once all the animals were in we know God told Noah it's time now it's time all things are ready get in the boat Noah right and when he got in the boat what happened happened God closed the door it wasn't Noah amen and you know we we've probably all heard of it before but the the the dramatization of of what it must have sounded like they were mocking him on the outside of the boat look at the crankies in there with all those animals the sun is baking hot and must smell real good in there now doesn't it Noah if anybody's been around animals you know what I mean stuck inside a boat in the sun it would be it would be really difficult 7 days they sat there so he's getting mocked from without and even from within the children must have been saying Daddy what's happening where's the rain we're listening we even put a tin roof up there so we could hear that rain but there's no rain coming Daddy and even his wife saying to him honey are you sure are you sure this is right are we going the right way we've given up everything we've spent our our whole Fortune building this boat and here we're sitting for six days and nothing's happened oh my thank the Lord for the seventh day yes and a prophet of God that would listen you know sometimes in our lives we don't even understand why the prophet said things the way he said but we follow because we know it'll turn out right I was doing a little reading this week and I I just thought you know it's amazing that we have the ability to talk about about a prophet and and to speak about prophetic insight and and and to say that we believe that God raised up a prophet to lead his church because how many prophets have there been raised up and how many of those prophets have been real quacks how many of them have done their own agendas some sort of demonic Behavior that's landed them in prison or worse how many prophets have there been but how many of them have just simply pointed to the word have just simply pointed to the word of God and said if you can't take my word for it take God's word for it not many if any except for one and it's just so beautiful to think you know what in Noah's day they were dealing on their senses they were totally relying upon their natural five senses and and and today we have people doing the very same thing but we know that we've been given a a six sense it's going to sound really simple after all that we've heard recently such great ministry every one of the brothers just bringing the truth as high as you want to go as a message believer and as low down deep below the surface as deep as you can possibly get in into the message of the hour we've heard it all recently it's been so good so rich today I just want to I just want to skip across the surface and hopefully just encourage us because we know the Mysteries and if we don't know the Mysteries there's only one way we're going to know them and that is to get the Holy Ghost because he the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ God himself when he the spirit of truth comes to you he will lead you and guide you into all truth he won't let you be led astray by a false prophet he won't let you be led astray by some black minister or Ministry he won't let you be led astray by family traditions for yourself you'll say I can't I can't follow that there's something that's just not right about that yes but there's no way we're going to be able to do that spiritually spinking with our senses our natural senses and and what I'm talking about specifically is the the five natural senses that we've been given and and we've been given them by God for a purpose but it's not to contact the spirit world and many times we try to deal with a spiritual situation with our natural senses and it's not going to work we know that the the the Deep caller to the deep and when there's a deep calling there's always a deep to respond if we have the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church but I want to talk about faith today and and our senses and you know I'm just going to start with a quote from a super sense in 1959 1227 e brother bam he says I I would like to speak just for a short time on the subject of Senses we are taught that the natural man has five senses and those five senses control his or or give God gave him those five senses to contact his Earthly home and those senses are known as see taste feel smell hear those five senses which are known to the Natural man and they are good we cannot operate or live a normal life when one of these senses fail to act your sight hearing feeling smelling or tasting we cannot be normal without them there's something missing some portion of life that we cannot contact without that sense acting and they're good and they're useful and they were given to us by God yes but they're for a purpose brothers and sisters God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift and it depends on how you what you yield these senses to will be the way that your life is controlled the way that you yield those five senses I'm just going to let that sink for a minute because we can live our lives in such a way that we have a a a real holy consecrated walk with the Lord but if we still go and yield our senses to the wrong things what's going to happen is we're going to ground out all of that power that we had the Holy Ghost is just going to take a step backwards and say well I'll just wait until you know what you're done doing whatever you're doing you know you shouldn't be doing what you're doing you know it because when he the spirit of truth comes he will lead you and guide you into all truth we're not going to go and do something and be like you know uh I don't know whether God thinks this is good or not if we're Believers we're going to know full well I remember hearing a minister say that you know what happens is there's a red flag there and you can choose to step over that red flag or not but if you choose to step over that red flag then you're actually going into a place where you know you shouldn't be and we know that once you're saved you're you're sealed until the day of your Redemption you're not going to lose your salvation our Salvation isn't going to be lost but as Sons and Daughters of God he'll allow us to harvest Harvest a harvest from the seeds that we've sown because whatever we we seow that that's what we're also going to reap that's the scripture God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift and it depends on how you what you yield these senses to when have we ever had a time where we have so much to yield our senses to I just can't help but think back in the days of Noah I bet you they had a lot of stuff that they could yield their senses to brother brandom says that back then they were more technologically advanced than we are today I I think that's pretty amazing because there's some pretty tremendous uh technology in the world today but whatever we yield our senses to that's the way our life is controlled the way you yield those five senses your what you see what you hear what you taste smell or feel whatever those senses are yield to they will dominate you this just really spoke to me brothers and sisters wow if we're in a position in our lives where we just just seem to not be able to get the victory over a certain thing in our lives I want to ask the question today what do we yield these five natural senses to because they're the gateway to our soul that's the only way the devil can get to us sometimes he'll use people and people will say things people will do things but sometimes we'll see things sometimes we'll hear things what do we yield our senses to because that what's going to dominate us and you know what's interesting is when that happens in our lives it doesn't show up when we come to church we don't bring that to church we bring our best we bring our egame to church right we put on our Sunday Best and we come to church it's when we're at home it's when we're with our families it's when we're at school it's when we're on our job it's when we're alone that's when this problem can actually come to the surface but whatever we're yielding our senses to that's what will dominate us that's why I know it just about everybody here I'm sure you do and if you don't I strongly recommend it just play a message in your house play a message in your house even just super quiet doesn't even have to be loud just play it in the background just just let the message play now I know some people would say brother Barry you can never play a message and just let it play as background noise but I want to say this even if you're not listening the devil is and he don't like it none because it's a prophet of God but brothers and sisters every once in a while we're going to tune in and say oh that sounds familiar and as we do that something's going to happen supernaturally in our lives we're going to be yielding our senses to the word of God but if we just put on a gentle background music maybe Calgary soft rock oh oh maybe not that because that's Rock right maybe shine FM what's the difference can someone tell me the difference I I I don't think there's a difference in fact I think they're owned by the same company exactly maybe they just play Christmas carols on shine that's all but what are we yielding our senses to brothers and sisters and and my my heart's desire today is just to give us a a bump forwards just a a little bit of a boost in our Our Lives to think that you know what maybe there's something small that we can change that will give us a drastic impact in our lives that maybe we'll have a supernatural strength we didn't even realize we had but I want to say it today if you're a son and daughter of God you've already got it I just hope we can realize it [Music] amen we know that we're talking about the the age the Christmas age the the Christmas story and I was so blessed this week I just had such a wonderful time I've been invited to come and minister at a at a chapel in uh uh Trinity Lodge it's just off of Glenmore Trail and and I've gone three times now and and this time I I just went in and I I I just told him about the Christmas story I thought it was so good but I I actually brought it from from Hebrews chap 11 you know without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and every time I go to that Chapel I see the same faces but you know these people what do you say to people who are in the position of wanting to just go home these are people in their 80s and their 90s The Pianist the second last time I was there she said to the the the one man that I met there he she she said to he said you know well so good to see you we'll see you next time and she said I hope not I hope I'm already gone by the time we have Chapel next week I'm thinking wow what do we say to these people it's so wonderful though to be able to go and understand that even though we're in the Christmas season it's not about a baby in a manger it's about the living breathing word of Jesus Christ today right and you know it's it's it's interesting because they tell you you know it's a morning Chapel you get 10 minutes to speak go and I always have to say I'm so sorry in advance because I don't know if I can just speak for 10 minutes but once upon a time I could but I I try to let them out on time I know I want to be respectful for them and just it's just a wonderful thing to think that you know there's people that really desire the sincere milk of the word they desire the the truth and and you see the same faces every single time you go and it's just wonderful but you know we've been given a super sign and and I believe most of the world would see it that that there is a super sign and that was God said I'll give you a sign to the prophet Isaiah and that will be that a virgin shall conceive and this is what I talk to these people about I don't think they've ever heard this before this one I think was a little bit much I said you know how many virgins were in the land that were taught this scripture that thought perhaps they could be the one perhaps I'm going to be that virgin how many of them were in the land but there was one there was one just like there's some today brothers and sisters who will not taste of death because they've got a testimony just like Enoch right that testimony is what that they please God because they're not bombarding their natural senses with all of the rubbish of this world they're taking and immersing thems elv in the word of God and there's so many different avenues that we can do it and one of the easiest ways is to just simply press play and obey obey the word of the Prophet which said obey the word of the Lord if we can do that brothers and sisters we'll have a testimony that we'll just please God and what will happen we'll just be like Enoch we'll have the same testimony that he pleased god without faith it's impossible to please him so how do we get this faith I think it's beautiful we're just going to dwell on this for a little bit you know we know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God so just press play just let that message play brothers and sisters if you want to see a change listen to more of the message press play we we have the ability to have the audio Bible as well if you get tired of hearing the prophet talk you can press play on the on the on the audio Bible and listen to the pure word of God and I would say this don't go don't go and feed upon some different translation once in a while okay reference it but I would encourage every single one of us to follow what the prophet laid out as a pattern there's a reason why he used the King James version of the Bible and it's not something that we should just negate and maybe try and read a different different version of it because maybe that's what we've done in the past maybe what we need to do is push aside all of the things that we've done in the past and just press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus just follow the pattern that's been sent set for us but we know we live in the season where there was a super sign given and that's really what the birth of Jesus Christ was that was a super sign that a virgin shall conceive when did a virgin ever conceive before Mary and we've talked about it many times I think it's good there's a virgin today a virgin to his word and that virgin just says Amen to his word and every time she says Amen to his word something Supernatural happens that life inside of her just kicks it just bumps it just comes to life and something happens and eventually brothers and sisters it's no longer going to be just us plus whatever life is growing inside of us it's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ will be history right but we live in an age I believe today especially that we need to preach faith and not you know Faith healing okay we can do that we can totally do that because we need healing in our bodies we're not looking for healing on the in the Millennium we're not looking for healing in the New Jerusalem when when we look at the Timeline that brother mvin brought so beautifully we're not looking for healing once we actually are raptured in our bodies we're looking for healing right now but we know brothers and sisters the word of God says seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all these other things shall be added unto you we can't think that we're just going to come and and and bang on God's door and say I need healing I need healing I need healing without first repenting for our sins and saying I know that I'm a sinner and I know there's nothing good in me first we have to seek the kingdom of God if we're willing to come the way he wants us to we will please him and when we please him brothers and sisters something happens in our lives we know that Enoch was translated and he wasn't found isn't it interesting how the word says that by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death it goes on to say and was not found because God had translated him it just totally took me to that to that that story of Elijah and remember the story of Elijah when he was taken up we know that the prophecy had gone forth that he was going to be taken up we know that the school of the prophets had heard they got the good word they were able to listen to The Prophet's message and they too knew they were enlightened that that there was actually going to be a Rapture that something was going to happen their master was going to be taken up and we know they came to Elisha think about the pressure on Elisha if you see me when I go you can have what you ask but then the prophet says to him you know why don't you just wait here I just got some business to tend to you know a little further down the road just just wait here and I'll be right back for you and he said not so Master you're not leaving my sight I'm not letting you go until I watch you go up because I believe the word for my day that's why but the school of the prophets we know that after he was raptured what happened they came to Elisha the follower and they said oh where's your master where'd he go he must be out in the mountains maybe he just went fishing he needed a break right he's out camping somewhere maybe we should send some people and we know that they came these were the prophets the school of the prophets the Believers they came and pressed him so much that he blushed he was embarrassed by it the way they asked him so he finally gave in and said go search and did they find him they couldn't find him I can only think that they must have done that for Enoch even though the word of God doesn't say it we know that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change his program he's IM mutable as immutable in his nature as he is in his ways so I can't help but think that you know as Enoch was taken up and was not found someone looked for him someone searched yes they did but they couldn't find find Enoch where was he God translated him why because he pleased God he wasn't willing to be caught up in all the fanaticism in the day he wasn't willing to be caught up in all of the so-called religious behaviors of the day we know brother bradam said that in David's day they had all the religious motion they even had the Ark of the Covenant but they didn't do it the way that God said that that Ark should be carried over the heart of the Levites what did they do they put it on a new cart they did this new religion and what happened people died for it that's what will happen if we're willing to take a tradition or some sort of teaching or some sort of idea over top of the revelation of Jesus Christ in our day he had a a testimony that pleased God I just think that's beautiful it wasn't a quote it wasn't a song it was it wasn't something he preached it was that he believed he just believed the word of God and because of that he was translated I think it's so beautiful you know out of the Amplified I I said earlier I just want to be clear I'm I'm bringing it out of the Amplified just to try and enhance it a little bit but I don't sit at home and study the Amplified Bible I I get a an inspiration for a scripture and then I'll just look at it in the Amplified Bible I'll look at in the Strong's Concordance and that's as far as I go with it I don't even own an amplified Bible but just the Amplified Bible Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith it's impossible to please and be satisfactory to him who wouldn't want to please and be satisfactory to him for whoever would come near to God must necessarily believe that God exists and that he is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek him out I just can't help but think that it's it's it's it's imperative for us yes it is to diligently seek him out amen and and to me I I looked up the word but I didn't I didn't quote it I didn't bring it but to me to be diligent about it means to be very careful a and very very very deliberate about what we do and and how we do it for the word of God for seeking the Lord Jesus Christ in our day I believe it's what we do don't get me wrong but I just want to encourage us to watch watch what's affecting our senses because if we're relying on these senses in any way to help us down the spiritual Road there's potential that the devil will come and and and and mess with us and and get in our lives and mix us up out of a super sense brother Bram he says people who talk that there was no such thing as the Holy Spirit don't know what they're talking about now I believe that everyone here today believes there is such a thing as the holy spirit amen and I believe that everyone here today either has the holy spirit in their lives right now or will have old and young I'm not going to put anybody in a category that's up to God to do that but I just want to say what brother bradam said here I I I've never heard this story before it's just a little one and I thought it was so good he says like a boy once peeling an apple I was asked by an Infidel debating a meeting he said what do you want what do you want up here he said I want to ask you a question while he was eating the apple and enjoying it a very simple sort of a a looked like delinquent person with hair hanging in his face and one tooth out in the front a dirty overall all Jack it on he said just one question I want to ask you the Infidel had just said there's no such thing as God it's all emotion there's nonsense to it it's all all it is and the boy said I want to ask you a question Mister is this apple sweet or sour he said how do I know I'm not eating it it's a pretty fair answer and question isn't it right he said that's what I thought walked right back brother Bram says how do you know when you haven't tasted the Lord how do we know brothers and sisters unless you have tasted the Heavenly gift but I want to say this it's impossible for you to fall away once you have tasted that Heavenly gift once you have been sealed with the Holy Ghost you're not going to fall away no we might just bombard our senses with the wrong things and cause a little bit of a bumpy road for us in our lives but once you're sealed you're sealed till your day of Redemption how do you know when you haven't tasted the Lord how do you know when you've never received the Holy Ghost whether he's real or whether he's not how do you know where there's faith and power how do you know there's not joy unspeakable and full of Glory when you've never tasted it to see hallu the six sense leads you to that the six sense declares that to you some might wonder why do you continually harp on the Holy Ghost I said it at the beginning I'll just reiterate it again brothers and sisters that's the only hope for our children I can teach them how to polish up put on the Sunday Best and go to church I can teach him all the message buzzwords I can teach him all the Mysteries but you know what if they don't have charity then all of that is like a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol isn't that what we've heard we we know that's the word of God we've got to get our children to Christ Jesus and the only way we're going to get them to Christ Jesus is by the Holy Ghost because you can't even call him Lord outside of the Holy Ghost in your life amen how do you how do you know there's not joy unspeakable and full of glory and you know what the beautiful thing is brothers and sisters if there's any but I don't even know but if there's anybody going oh I don't know I just I just can't make a decision I don't know I I kind of want to and I kind of don't want to I don't know can I do it you know what unless you've done it you'll never know it and you'll always wonder but why wouldn't you want joy unspeakable and full of Glory in your life right why wouldn't you want to go to bed at night Joy with joy unspeakable where you just can't even put words to what you're feeling and you just feel like it's full of Glory whe When when when you think about oh we're going to have church and something happens in your heart it just thumps in your chest oh my I'm going to church some people do things in life to actually get a thrill some people do things in life and it actually gets their heart to pump but you know I think the believer gets actually thinking about going to church we know that David said I was glad when they said let us go into the house of the Lord there's something that happens in our lives when we think about coming to meet at church because we're not coming to meet with our brothers and sisters if we are brothers and sisters we got it wrong we come to this building we're coming to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ amen how do you know there's not joy unspeakable and full of Glory when you've never tasted it to see it how do you know if the Apple's sweet or sour I've done that at home I'll just be honest I'm not really a big fan of mey apples I think they're probably better in a a crumble or a pie you know I like a really crisp sort of Sweet Apple something that's got a lot of juice it's juicy I like that kind of apple but how would I ever know until I taste it and I've seen them sitting on the counter in our house and I've thought you know that looks Meely to me I don't think so ah I'll pass by and you know I'll see one of my kids eating it and they'll be biting it and slurping the juice from it and it'll Crunch and crisp and I have to turn around and go back and grab one for myself because I'm like man that's a good apple I can tell just by the way they're eating it you know brothers and sisters if we're willing to take the time to take a look with our eyes you know brother bradam he says that we we we look with our eyes right but we see with our heart we don't see with our eyes as a man thinketh in what his heart so is he there's a whole thing here about senses that we'll probably talk about for a while but today we're just dwelling with the the natural external senses those five external senses but you know what I want to get to here and I just go off on a tangent and I apologize is that the devil wants us to think that it's not joy unspeakable that it's just misery you're just going to put on a ball and chain and now you're just going to drag that ball and chain around now you're going to be a message believer you're going to be a wife you're just going to have to be submissive slave for your husband every time he snaps his finger you're just going to drag that ball and chain around and around and around that's what the world Paints the picture of but you know what that's what the devil does because if you ever get to Christ you're only going to want to follow the word of [Music] God it doesn't mean you're going to treat your wife like a slave you're not going to be a slave we know Paul said that he was a prisoner of Christ our wives aren't prisoners and you know what a man is going to treat his wife just like we want God to treat us as his bride he's going to esteem us as his bride he's going to treat us very well every one of us all the men especially here want to be treated good by God which means every one of us that want to be treated good by God is going to treat our wives just like we want God to treat us right amen if we're not there's something wrong amen but how do you know there's not joy unspeakable and full of Glory if you're afraid to taste it if you're afraid to see it it's the devil Satan has got in the way and and made it look like something that it's not because when we serve God with all of our hearts brothers and sisters it's joy unspeakable and it's full of Glory we see God come on the scene for us in our lives when we have problems in our lives and we come to the throne we bring a prayer request to the Lord Jesus Christ he answers our prayers that's not to say he doesn't answer many other prayers in this world too right but as his bride she's the apple of his eye brother brandham goes on to say the six sense lends you to that the six sense declares that to you says there's no intellectual Powers at all I love this there's no intellectual Powers at all will ever bring that to you the intellectual Powers will reason and say why it's psychology it's something this way and it's emotion with the people remember sometimes people get upset when they see too much emotion but if your religion doesn't have emotion it's dead and you probably better bury it that's a direct quote from the prophet because when we truly find the Lord Jesus Christ when we truly find that pearl of great price we can't wait for those doors to be open to come and worship God to bring our praise offering unto him it's like someone getting the the revelation of tithing whoa that's what God wants me to do so that pleases him so if I bring my tithe to him that pleases him then there's a blessing in store for me and it's not about money it's about understanding that when my children get sick I can say you said you would rebuke the Devourer for my sakes when my Devil comes and tries to get in my marriage and mix it up I can say that you said that you would rebuke the devour for my sake when the devil tries to get into the church brothers and sisters if we take God at his word we can have a testimony that pleases him you know brother randam said it we know that God said it through brother Bram that God wants to bless us what a thousand times more did he say it that way than we're we're willing to actually accept it from him it's not just emotion emotion comes with it the Holy Ghost is without sensation you don't get a feeling in your senses that you got the holy ghost in your life you got the ability to say Amen to the word and every time you do something reacts there's a an emotion that comes with it you just can't help but say it and when you catch the Revelation about what saying Amen to the word does because you believe it something Supernatural takes place in your life and you get emotional anybody here ever got in the presence of God really in the presence of God where you know that you've been in the presence of God and not actually shed a tear can you go before the Throne of God and not actually get emotional I I don't know I'm not saying you should or you shouldn't but I know that I can't when you really break through and you get into that place the the presence of God comes in the room so strong oh my it does something to us brothers and sisters that's why you can't say that oh there's no emotion with it goodness sakes how can you have the pearl of great price and not get emotional but the bradam says it that the world they just love their baseball games and basketball games and football games and hockey games all the sports games in the world and they're not afraid to enter right in what about the Sons and Daughters of God that know that they've been just been freely given eternal life you just get to go to heaven you just get to go to the New Jerusalem you didn't do anything on your own you just get to go there because God knew before the foundation of the world that you were going to be an expression of him to this age you just get a pass doesn't matter about all your shortcomings or your failures you just get a pass my how could we not get excited brothers and sisters I'm not trying to pump us up but I just can't help but think how exciting it really is hallelujah boy if I won the 649 I'd probably be jumping around if I was Cadre Diggs I'd be doing it but I'm not so but if I W the Powerball lottery I'd be doing it I could buy a helicopter I could buy a Pilot I could do all these different things I'd be excited amen but but to think that all of that's going to burn oh my and there's going to be a city that comes down from heaven oh and it's going to have our name on it he's busy preparing that place for you right now brothers and sisters it's got your name on it it's an inheritance that's in heaven it's undefiled it's Incorruptible and it's reserved for you ram says but when the six sense comes in it denies all of those things and moves a person straight into the bosoms of God oh my he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him so I want to say with our senses just on the basest level even if that's a word forgive me if it's not Tom Ernest reminded me that I'm not uh gramar correct individual God bless him what it is brothers and sisters is just such a tremendous thing if we're diligent when we're diligent when we seek Him by faith brother Bram says by Faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith it's the sixth sense that does it six sense denies all symptoms all symptoms anything that's contrary to God's word any feeling emotion somebody say oh well I was prayed for but I just don't feel any better that's not where the healing comes from brothers and sisters we're not trying to activate God's hand we're not trying to say that just if you do this that God will do do that what we are doing is saying that God gave us these instructions for a reason and the reason is that if we're willing to believe unequivocally not the words of brother Barry believe the words of God through the prophet believe those words and you will see the results that you're looking for right let that Sixth Sense take over don't worry about your feelings somebody say oh well I was prayed for but I just don't feel any better six cense would never stand still for that six cense would say it's a lie I feel better I'm getting well God said so that settles it amen God said so six cents only feeds on the word of God how many people have ever done that exercised that because I know that we all know this how many of us have ever done that and then started to feel worse that's the time to believe brothers and sisters because that's something's happening in your life you can see that the promise is on the way sometimes it's not in our time frame that's right just about every time it's not in our time frame amen it's always in his time frame but if we're willing to just trust him and take him at his word and just allow that time frame to manifest it will turn out right amen you know we say six sense here I don't know how many times he said in this message I'd like to look it up but he's talk about the Holy Ghost and I think I'll bring the quote here I don't know if I'll have it in here or not but he's speaking about the Holy Ghost Christ himself living out through the individual that's the six sense that he's talking about that super sense it's super above the senses it's greater sense it's a faith it's a power that stirs and drives amen it's something that makes you do things that you never thought you would do it's the six sense the super sense I just had this on my heart I'm going to say this my words here this morning brothers and sisters we're here together we heard it on Sunday and I believe we heard it in the past many times we're not we're not preaching Faith healing this is not first and second pull stuff we're not looking for skim milk we're not looking to name it and claim it we're looking for the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives we want to see the baptism of the holy spirit in our lives because that's what's going to get us out of here we could find our way into the graveyard but there's only one thing that's going to get us out of there but there's going to be a people who will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye that shall not taste of death just like Enoch that's right and you know what we're preaching brothers and sisters this is third pole preaching that's where we're going with this that that's what this is that's my heart's desire is to just remind us this is third Paul preaching understanding who we are and what we're raised up for we're not just church members we're not just message Believers we're the living manifestation living attributes of the word for our day amen it is a living breathing word brothers and sisters it's not just a print on a page it's not just a a a place in Jeffersonville it's not just an app on a phone it's the Lord Jesus Christ Living out through his bride amen making himself real to her over and over and over again wooing her telling her just follow my word you'll please me and when you do you'll go in the rapture we know the great revivals have already happened in this world and people might say well brother Barry there's great Revival happening over in this continent and over here in this portion we know we just saw one down is it was it Asbury or Ashbury I can't remember the name of it but the University of pouring out I you know what brother Bram said it no doubt it's the holy spirit it's the anointed ones at the end time and those people were diligently seeking the Lord weren't they and you know he's a gentleman he always comes where he's invited but we can live on the anointing or we can live as Jesus Christ because if you've got him in you who are you brothers and sisters if you've got the Holy Ghost living out through you who are you you can't be your own anymore but we know that where we're at brothers and sisters the great Revival is over this world being swept over and pulling people out and and and like I said it can be said there's a revival going on and sure enough there is there's people crying out saying that there's a great revival going on but we know we had a prophet in our day that was rejected when the Great Revival was actually happening what happened they rejected the word of God for their day which means judgment is the only thing that's left but when he was here preaching when he was here bringing the word as God's prophets do amen he said that the revivals are over there is going to be another one though and that's going to be the bride's Revival and so there is a Revival that's happening today and I want to say it this way that it is the bride's Revival but he also said this when you see the unwise Virgin go looking for oil get ready look up because your Redemption draws brothers and sisters I want to say it this morning get ready because there is a group of people that's out there searching diligently for oil but they're willing to reject the word of a Vindicated Prophet God help us right you can't reject God's word through a prophet and we know that Jesus said hey you know what they couldn't believe him we know Joseph we know who your dad is we know who your mother is we know you're an illegitimate child dealing with her senses right y going For The Senses oh we're looking at it naturally you can't take a a prophetic scripture and and and apply it and say that I'm going to interpret it naturally it doesn't work that way can you take it back to the word that's what we got to be able to do so long as we can connect the dots in the word then we can say hey you know what just like Jesus said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do because they are they that testify of who I am yes there is a Revival that's happening right now but it's a private event isn't it beautiful it's a private event and it's the bride's Revival Hallelujah she's she's having a real Fiesta she's really enjoying her time in the word with the word as the word amen and it's all about knowing who we are and and I just think it's so amazing because like I said I was looking at this stuff and seeing how these false prophets rise up and they try and exalt people and make people feel like there's something Elite and and there's something better better class of people people we heard about classes of people on Wednesday and sure enough there is a better class of people but you know those better people they're humble people they're not puffed up they don't walk down the street and think that oh Lord I'm so glad that I'm better than that person look at that person he's got all this this natural sign of the world in his life or the thumping music in his car or whatever it is all these problems we see in this world brothers and sisters but for the grace of God there go I amen we need to keep that in our minds and recognize that the truly elect bride of Jesus Christ is probably one of the most humble people that you'll ever meet because she knows that it's only because he called her before the foundation of the world he chose her to be his bride she didn't say oh I'm going to be the bride of Christ doesn't work that way there is a Revival happening it's a bride's Revival and it's happening it's in full swing it's beautiful brother Bram goes on to say in a super sense and we are a great we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but we by no by no means but by no means was these five senses given to you to guide you they were given to you for Earthly contact but there was given you a six sense and that six sense is belongs only to the Christian just letting that soak a little bit it and you cannot have this six sense until you become a Christian it's the only way you can ever have any more than the natural than the five natural senses for the natural person but the six sense is better known to the Christian as Faith it's the one that governs and guides you and it's Superior to all the other senses it's Superior to all the other senses the other five senses and I I want to say this I'll get into it maybe later we'll see how the the Lord just leads but many people might be asking well brother Barry isn't there five other senses and there are five inner senses and these are the more tricky ones because the devil can get into our emotions they can get into the the inner five senses Consciousness reasoning memory memory is a bad one the devil can get into memories and and cause us to remember things that we need to forget and many times it's things that we've actually said oh I've forgotten and I've forgiven I've forgiven and I've forgotten yeah it's all good but what happens is the Devil comes around when something new happens especially in marriages if anybody's married you probably encountered this and if you haven't God bless you but the Devil comes around and says remember that thing that she did remember that thing that he did and it becomes a little bit of Leverage and and you can take that and just add it to the moment of anger and you don't have to be married to encounter you can have a friend you can have a brother or a sister and say that you know I remember they did that to me and and now they did this to me and they're always the same they're never going to change it just we don't need to do that that's the devil getting into the inner senses I'm not getting into those today I don't want to do that but we got to be careful how we use our senses we cannot guide ourselves spiritually by our natural senses right I think it's just so important so important to get a super sense brother Ram he says going on here he says now I would not say that because we receive the six sense that the five senses are no good no more yes they are I love it the way he says stuff there's always a balance to it right it's always balanced if we're just willing to listen to what he says says yes they are those five senses were given to you by God and they are to be used but when the five senses act contrary to the word of God then they are lying I love how he said that they're not just wrong they're not just incorrect they're lying now the six sense cannot lie it's a super sense and that's what I want to speak about this morning I spoke on a super sign and tonight on a super sense and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you excuse me and if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense I think that's that is so rich right there brothers and sisters but that is not an easy task because we got this old man that we deal with every single day but you know that's why Paul said I Die daily amen I I I go on my knees and I say let me crucify this flesh Lord let your spirit live out through me let don't don't let it be Barry living out through this world don't don't let it be Barry that the children see or that my wife sees let it be Jesus Christ amen let let my family around me see Jesus Christ Living out through me let the friends in this world let all the people in this world see a totally different individual let them see a new creature in Christ Jesus if we're willing to do that that's yielding our bodies that's yielding our minds that's yielding all of our senses to that single sick sense and when we do that brothers and sisters something Supernatural takes place and you know what even if we're willing to take five minutes in the morning because we're busy we're rushed we slept in we had such a wonderful time of Fellowship on Sunday now Monday morning hits we got to get the kids to school school got to get their lunches got to get out the door got all this pressure pressure pressure got to get to work that's life that's the life we live but don't let it get in the way of that sick sense Satan wants to squeeze the pressure on us and tell us we're too busy but even five minutes even three minutes even a couple words breathed in prayer brothers and sisters can change the day Amen brother Bram says that super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural sense that the spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens is above the natural man and has five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you believe things that you cannot see amen it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about it remember this what he says here the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he can't touch that super sense he can't touch that super Faith he can't touch that Lord Jesus Christ he can't touch the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and that's why he can impersonate anything but he cannot impersonate the word amen that's why we've got to be able to take it back to the word brothers and sisters sometimes we'll hear things in our lives and we'll say you know that just doesn't ring true but I can't put a scripture to it I can't understand it I just don't know just ask God just ask him and I guarantee you he'll give you an answer for it he'll bring a scripture or you'll hear a quote from the prophet one or the other or maybe a brother will say it to you or a sister will say it to you you'll hear an answer though God will give it the devil can get into the these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God it's called faith faith is that great thing isn't that wonderful brothers and sisters he can't touch that six sense don't you want to be where the devil can't touch want to be in a place where the devil can't touch our relationships with our husbands our relationships with our wives our relationships with our parents our relationships with our children children oh my all of these relationships in our lives if we can be in a position like that we know Satan won't be able to touch us that's incredible I want to live there brother Bram going on here he says and the five senses does not control the six sense but the six sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the five senses is see taste feel smell and hear and the super sense is something that'll make you believe God's word isn't that beautiful yes amen it's not going to make you be someone that you're not it's not going to give you riches it's not going to make you speak in tongues it's not going to make you have the gift of healing or the gift of discernment it's not going to be any of these gifts that the devil can impersonate he just says it right there it gives you the ability that'll make you believe God's word for that's the only thing it'll speak about what do we saturate our senses with brothers and sisters you know sometimes we don't even have to saturate our senses sometimes it can just be a little tiny bit I I got into uh I got into welding a little bit and uh sorry brother Jeff I'm going to talk about you a little bit I'm G to brag on you brother Jeff's a welder here and uh he's got a welding rig and he was teaching me a little bit about welding but you know while we were doing it I just kept thinking if anybody's familiar with it you can get a flash from the weld that's so bright it can burn your eye and and it doesn't take very much of it to actually hurt you to really hurt your eye but prolonged exposure without dealing with it correctly can really hurt you as well but you know what I just got thinking about sometimes our senses can be just like that we can have a very very small exposure of something just flash in front of our eyes and you know what it does it affects us us and and it might not be just one and it might not be just two but it can be over time just a little bit here and a little bit there and a little bit here and a little bit there and before long if we're not careful if we're not guarding ourselves putting on the whole armor of God brothers and sisters our natural senses can allow enough saturation of these little tiny things it's not the big problems that spoil the vine it's the little foxes that spoil the vine the little tiny things in our life that we might just say it's okay I can do that I can handle that it's not a big deal I know many brothers that are doing it I can do it with many other brothers and everybody's doing it it's just fine it might not be just fine brothers and sisters amen is it is it agreeing with the word I would say this whatever we're doing are we doing it under Christ because if we're not doing it under Christ then we shouldn't be doing it I say Lord help me says that super sense is something that'll make you believe God's word for it's the only thing it'll speak about it'll make you believe for things that you can't see taste feel smell or hear because it'll take God's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but God's word by faith faith does it we live in a world where the devil can get into our lives and so many different Avenues so many different ways of affecting our senses but we have the ability to have that super sense we've got the ability to overcome All Things by the Lord living out through US brother Bram goes on to say I know I got lots of quotes but I'm not going to keep us long today he says now you cannot believe it until you are regenerated the Bible said that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost and Jesus means Jesus and the Christ is the anointed one the Messiah the sent one no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the holy ghost that six sense that we're talking about we went through that this last week and it's been such a stumbling block especially to the Pentecostal believing people when they hear me say that Jesus said in St John 5:24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal etal life eternal life comes from God alone and no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost you're only taking what somebody else said what you learned by intellectual what you learned by the natural five senses but when the six sense comes in the Holy Spirit it takes away all the reasonings right of these six senses and five senses and lifts you up into that six sense to make you believe things that you can't see taste feel smell or hear Hallelujah does something to you then you can say Jesus is the Christ because you have witnessed it not what intellectual teaching has taught you but what you've experienced and that's why brothers and sisters today I I just want to emphasize it again that's why we preach the Holy Ghost here in this church and you know we don't we don't preach it in such a way that we we want to see gifts manifesting and that's going to be our true evidence of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives what we do is we preach Christ crucified and that he died and he rose again and it's not just 2,000 years ago that he truly lives out through his bride body today our ability to say that it's not an intellectual teaching that's taught us but it's what we've experienced it it is we know that Pentecost brother brandom says that Pentecost is not just a denomination in fact it's not a denomination even though the world and the devil has tried to make it that way it's an experience it's an upper room experience where we encounter the Holy Ghost for ourselves when we do that we do become a new creature in Christ Jesus but it gives us the ability to to overcome all of these five senses if we can subdue these five senses I think the world would be a better place maybe we should start campaigning that if we can just get the Holy Ghost in our lives and subdue these senses we know the world would never go for it oh they wouldn't never brother bam goes on to say the six Sense come for this reason now the six sense is the faith the super sense now the six Sense come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you you deny anything that's contrary to God's word I find myself many times looking at situations naturally and I have a natural opinion and I've got a natural tendency and a natural thought pattern but there's got to be a time where we stop doing that and and where we say you know I want to see the good in people I want to see the Holy Ghost in people I don't want to see the natural circumstances I don't want to read a book just by looking at its cover I want to be able to take a look at this situation I want to be able to go on my knees and ask the Lord to show me what's going on to have discernment by the six sense and you know if we do that as Believers our world would be a different place brothers and sisters that's what the six sense is for the scripture speaks of casting down reasonings taking every thought into captivity right because the devil plants a thought in our head doesn't mean that we've gone ahead and done it doesn't mean that it's our thought it's the devil's thought but if we don't take the time that Split Second to take that thought into captivity and recognize is it a the word of God if it's not of the word of God brothers and sisters it's of the devil take it into captivity give it a split second and just see where it came from and if it's the devil's give it back to him that ain't my thought I never thought that that wasn't that wasn't mine that was from the devil amen I think it's so beautiful when we can start to look at it that way and recognize that it's actually the devil we can give it back to him and remind him of his future and say maybe once upon a time you affected me that way but buddy you've got it coming to you try and dig up my past let's go to your future and you know what there comes a time where he'll leave he'll split the devil will leave you alone he will stop bugging you he'll come around again but that's why we've got to put on the whole armor of God that's why we've got to fortify ourselves that's why we need to have the six sense without that we're going to be just beat up the five senses will you can reason well now why should this man he why should but the six sense doesn't see that at all they see it brother in Christ you know we uh I think we read a scripture recently or a quote a quote sorry um where brother bradam says that you know when we get that six sense when we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it's going to give us the ability to actually endure with a brother to be able to intreat him even when we know he's wrong are we able to do that six sense doesn't see that at all it's so far beyond it it's so much higher than it is until it don't even have any reasonings at all with it we believe it it's far beyond anything that the five senses would have to say about it now get ready for a healing service see we believe it you walk by that six sense you talk by that six sense you live by that six sense you die by that six sense and you rise by that six sense that super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is I love the way he says that because doesn't leave any room out for a Believer doesn't give us room to say well I can just go and do this I can take Liberty to do that uh you know we can do the other thing no we live by it we die by it we walk by it we talk by it we think by it everything that we do is by the six sense which is the Holy Ghost amen that's going to give us overcoming power brothers and sisters where we get to the place where Satan won't even want to deal with us we will be so far hid back in Christ the devil will say no no no no no no we'll go and deal with all the other people in this world but not them we don't want nothing to do with them because we can't get through that's where we find ourselves turn with me this morning over to First Peter just got a couple of scriptures I wanted to read hope it's okay we still got six minutes seven minutes I wanted to read a lot but I don't know maybe uh we'll just read verse 7 start at verse 7 anyway but the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you we know it very well but as we've read you know when we're going through the trial in our lives brothers and sisters it's not the trial for the natural senses it's not the trial for the things that we see naturally speaking it's for the trial of our faith the devil wants us to believe that we don't have faith and that's why we're in a trial but what's happening is it's the exact opposite we're in the trial because God's proving that you have faith God is proving his life through you and he wants you to know he wants us to know all of us that the trial that we're going through is more precious than gold it's more precious than anything that we could encounter here on Earth it's more precious than everything that we could encounter here because you know this is what gives us joy unspeakable and full of glory and what is it brothers and sisters it's that six sense that we've been talking about and I I believe I'm not even really doing this justice but what it's doing is giving us the ability to recognize that the faith we're talking about is not just a faith that we get from listening to a prophet even though hearing gives us Faith it's the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ that we get through the message of the hour understanding that we receive Jesus Christ today the same yesterday today and forever when we receive that Jesus Christ we now move into a place where we get that six sense where we get that Holy Ghost where we actually don't have our own faith any longer we have faith enough to believe to get us to church and that's one thing but we've got to have faith enough to believe in our Salvation if we have faith to believe in our Salvation we've got faith to actually make it you know Romans 5 I'll just read it for the sake of time Romans 5 vers1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by what by faith in to this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God Amen and not only so but we glory in tribulations also amen we glory in tribulations also my knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us you know we read in First Peter here this is the Salvation what we're talking about is this salvation this is the Salvation that the prophets they they inquired diligently but it was prophesied that it should come unto you all right one final point that I'm going to make today and and perhaps we can pick up on it later on we'll see what the Lord has in store I just want to read one little story in Matthew chapter 99 brothers and sisters maybe just turn there quick with me still have 2 minutes I hope we're okay for a couple more minutes amen Matthew chapter 9 I think the Lord showed me this this morning and I just hope that it would just be an encouragement to to everyone because it just did something to me something that I knew but every once in a while while we just need to have a little bit of encouragement don't we it's a very familiar story Matthew chapter 9 verse one says and he entered into a ship speaking about Jesus here and it passed over and came into his own City and behold they brought to him a man sick of the paly lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the py son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts for whether it's easy is it for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick and the apy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine own house and he arose and departed to his house isn't that wonderful Jesus he goes over and they bring to him someone sick of the paly and what does he say to him first he doesn't say to him you know I'm God and I can heal all thy diseases he says to him first you you know what your sins are forgiven I want you to know that you are Justified you didn't do anything I knew you were here and I came directly to you and the first thing I want to tell you is that your sins they're forgiven you we're not even going to talk about your healing first we're going to talk about your salvation because once you've been sealed you've been sealed to until the day of your Redemption but I want you to know that your sins firstly they're forgiven you you don't have to worry about a thing could you imagine God coming and telling you that your sins have been forgiven you whatever it is that's ailing you now you can get up and go home can you imagine that right we've been told that today brothers and sisters yeah the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ you never did it in the first place you've been Justified before the foundation of the world he chose you in him to be perfect and Without Blame the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ this just just just made me so happy to see how Jesus did so I started to look at it and and I would recommend if you have any questions go and look at the gospels and see that was his sort of Mo first your sins are forgiven then we heal you your sins are forgiven then will heal you and he did it over and over and over why did he do that I believe he was setting an example for the Bride of Jesus Christ today today to show that there will be a person there will be a bride there will be a body of believers who will recognize that there was nothing they ever did from the beginning from the start it's all what he has done for them and you know we're not living in that timeline like brother mvin was showing we're not living under the law and we're not living under the time of Jesus we're living in the time of Grace it's all Grace it's all what Jesus has done for us the son of man Ministry he came and he did it all for us amen gave us the ability to recognize that through for knowledge you have been predestinated in love to be before him holy and blameless that to me just does something amenallah I'll call the musicians now I will and just remember brothers and sisters when we have the problems in our lives that he's forgiven your sins [Music] AMU I think think that we have many times I know I have many times taken myself back or down to a maybe a denominational level spiritually speaking because I'm trying to deal with God according to my senses but we've got to push these senses aside and move into that place where all things are possible we've got to approach the Lord through that sick sense and when we do that then we'll get into that presence we talked about earlier where we just can't contain ourselves where where we know the presence of God is with us where he has drawn near to us I'm just going to read out of Hebrews chapter 12 as we close maybe stand with me this morning Hebrews 12:1 says wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so doth easily beset us let us run with pain patience the race that is set before us every one of us are sinners saved by grace but let's stop looking at the sin let's stop looking at the senses naturally speaking and let's just press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of god let's run this race forget about the sins he said I forgiven you you're already Justified you never even did it you never even did it in the first place I just want to close on this scripture here it's verse two of Hebrews 12 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith the faith that we have brothers and sisters he he he wrote it before the foundation of the world and then he gave it to us amen we don't just generate the faith we can't just go and buy the faith he's the author of it he wrote it Satan knows about it but he's the author and the finisher he started it and he's going to finish it we can't finish it because he's the author and the finisher of your faith of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross so that he could tell us your sins are forgiven isn't that amazing to think about that thief on the cross yes what church did you go to when he got to Heaven no doubt they had conversation what church did you go to what Bible did you read how much did you worship what did you do nothing I didn't even know the guy I just believed that he was innocent he forgave all of our sins brothers and sisters look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith God wrote Our Lives he wrote the beginning to the end and he wrote the finishing of our faith we just need to keep pressing on don't get weary and well-doing just keep pressing on that was the instruction the prophet was given from the other side just keep pressing on no do I have to go back to my body yes you do but just keep pressing on don't give in just keep going to church just keep pressing on let the washing of the Water by the word happen and it will let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word we're thankful Lord Jesus that you are truly the author and the finisher of our faith Lord that it was written in you before the foundation of the world and you knew exactly who would and who wouldn't receive it and father Lord this morning I pray that Lord for many of us we have this faith and let it just be a boost to us Lord let it just be an encouragement and father if there's any of us that don't have this level of Faith Lord let us not leave this building until we see it Lord until we feel it until we understand it for ourselves Lord let us experience this faith that we're talking about Lord for ourselves just like the Apple father let it let it be something that we can taste of the fruit of the land let us see that there is a real place there is a real promised land and that promised land is in you father we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us as we go our separate ways Lord help us to be a living witness help us to show the world there is a Living Word of Jesus Christ today father that it's not coming tomorrow and that it's not something from the past not the I was or will be but the I am living out through your children today Father Lord we love you and we thank you we just commit all these words and all of my brothers and sisters into your hands as we go our separate ways and if it Be Your Will for us toide gather again on Wednesday father we certainly will give you the praise and the glory we just ask all these things
