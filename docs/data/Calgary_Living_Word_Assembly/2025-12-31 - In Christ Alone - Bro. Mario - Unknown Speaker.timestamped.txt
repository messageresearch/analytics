[0:00] Will I glory
[0:03] though I could pride myself in battles
[0:07] won.
[0:10] For I've been blessed beyond measure
[0:15] and by his strength alone I overcome.
[0:22] Oh, I could stop count successes
[0:27] like diamond in my hand.
[0:33] But those trophies could not equal
[0:37] to the grace
[0:39] by which I stand.
[0:47] In Christ alone
[0:51] I place my trust
[0:55] and find my glory
[0:58] through the power of the cross.
[1:04] In every victory
[1:08] let be said of me.
[1:13] My source of strength.
[1:16] My source of hope
[1:19] is Christ alone.
[1:26] In Christ alone
[1:29] will I glory.
[1:31] For only by his grace I am redeemed.
[1:35] [music]
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Tender mercy
[1:43] could reach [music] beyond my weakness
[1:46] to my name.
[1:51] And now
[1:53] I seek no greater honor than just to
[1:57] know [music and singing] you.
[2:00] Hallelujah.
[2:03] [music] To count again loses
[2:07] to the glory
[2:09] of the Lord. Come on, somebody say, "Oo
[2:15] in Christ the Lord." [singing]
[2:22] [music]
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Not somebody, [singing]
[2:26] &gt;&gt; not to Mohamad,
[2:28] &gt;&gt; not to Buddha.
[2:30] not to anybody else. In every victory,
[2:36] let be
[2:41] [music]
[2:45] my source of hope
[2:48] is my [music and singing]
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Can I get you please again?
[2:53] In Christ alone
[2:56] will I glory
[2:58] for only by his grace.
[3:03] I can hear you say that
[3:06] [music]
[3:10] &gt;&gt; could reach beyond my [music] weakness
[3:13] to my need.
[3:18] And now
[3:20] I seek no greater honor
[3:24] than just [singing] to know you more
[3:30] [music]
[3:34] to the glory.
[3:37] Pray of the [singing] Lord. [music]
[3:43] In Christ
[3:45] the Lord
[3:48] I place my trust
[3:52] and find my glory to the power
[4:00] in every victory [singing]
[4:03] [music]
[4:05] that be said
[4:07] on [singing] me.
[4:11] Hallelujah.
[4:13] My source of hope [music] in Christ
[4:17] [singing] Lord.
[4:20] My source of strength.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[4:24] &gt;&gt; My source of hope.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Is Christ the Lord.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
