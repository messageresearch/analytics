[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:35] I chose you
[1:10:37] you father
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:47] father Lord
[1:10:50] certainly an honor and a privilege to
[1:10:51] gather together in the name above every
[1:10:53] name
[1:10:55] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:58] I just can't help but think about the
[1:11:01] specials this morning and certainly love
[1:11:04] the
[1:11:05] the efforts put forth look forward to
[1:11:07] the service this evening but
[1:11:10] just couldn't help but think with that
[1:11:12] last special the sister sang
[1:11:14] you know the story where the radam talks
[1:11:16] about Dwight Moody
[1:11:19] do you know Grace
[1:11:22] and the men said Grace who
[1:11:25] Dwight Moody said to them the grace of
[1:11:27] God
[1:11:30] that's exactly what we were singing
[1:11:31] about this morning that's what we were
[1:11:33] hearing and brother Branham goes on to
[1:11:35] talk about that in the invisible Union
[1:11:36] of the Bride of Jesus Christ that there
[1:11:39] was only one
[1:11:42] one woman chosen amongst many
[1:11:46] and that's the grace that we live under
[1:11:48] brothers and sisters why
[1:11:51] if you have a need this morning make it
[1:11:53] known unto him with an uplift hand I
[1:11:55] know we've already had some needs and
[1:11:58] just want to continue to uphold sister
[1:11:59] Tina
[1:12:01] brother Paul and sister Elaine who would
[1:12:04] prefer to be here I know
[1:12:06] but are once again at home because of
[1:12:08] this illness
[1:12:12] and I can only assume that the snows
[1:12:16] are at home with the illness
[1:12:18] and anyone else who's dealing with it
[1:12:21] let's just go to him in prayer this
[1:12:23] morning
[1:12:24] a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:12:26] you for your goodness to us we thank you
[1:12:29] for your grace Lord
[1:12:31] and father we don't just thank you for
[1:12:33] the grace that you've given to us but
[1:12:35] Lord we thank you that you have given us
[1:12:37] the grace but then you have expressed it
[1:12:40] to us Lord You've explained it to us
[1:12:42] Lord you've given it to us freely and
[1:12:44] then and then explained it so that we
[1:12:46] can understand it Lord Jesus father this
[1:12:49] morning we pray that your grace would
[1:12:51] abound in our service father Lord that
[1:12:54] our hearts would be open and receptive
[1:12:56] to your words Lord Jesus father that it
[1:12:58] wouldn't be words of man but it would
[1:13:00] truly be the words of Our Lord father
[1:13:04] this morning we know we have many needs
[1:13:06] in the body and and that's why we have a
[1:13:08] body so that each part each member of
[1:13:11] the body can supply to the other parts
[1:13:13] of the body that which we need father we
[1:13:16] just ask that you would touch those who
[1:13:17] were down with an illness father we know
[1:13:20] this illness has gone through the the
[1:13:22] group The Body here father so many
[1:13:24] people have been sick by it and Lord
[1:13:26] Jesus we thank you for your healing
[1:13:28] touch in their lives many people have
[1:13:30] been healed from it and father we trust
[1:13:33] for the healing in the rest of the body
[1:13:34] as well Lord Jesus father we just want
[1:13:37] to rebuke that devil in the name of
[1:13:39] Jesus Christ it has no part in this body
[1:13:42] father we pray that you would just allow
[1:13:44] our brothers and sisters to come back to
[1:13:47] be in their position father in the body
[1:13:49] Lord we just want to remember sister
[1:13:51] Tina father who would much rather be in
[1:13:53] service than be in the hospital Lord
[1:13:55] knowing that she is battling between
[1:13:57] this this thing that's attacking her
[1:14:00] heart father and and and the desire to
[1:14:03] have your healing touch in her body Lord
[1:14:05] and in the meantime the surgeons are are
[1:14:07] looking after her father we pray that
[1:14:09] you would just bring a deep seated peace
[1:14:12] to her soul father just a real rest that
[1:14:15] she can trust in you father because we
[1:14:17] know that your hand is in complete
[1:14:19] control whether it's the doctors or
[1:14:21] whether it's you father you're in
[1:14:23] control and We Know It And we thank you
[1:14:25] for that control Lord we pray that you
[1:14:27] would just bless our sister raise her up
[1:14:29] again at the appointed time we ask now
[1:14:32] father as we go forwards we pray that
[1:14:35] you would just bless each one who's made
[1:14:36] an effort to to bring their lick of fire
[1:14:39] to this service this morning Lord Jesus
[1:14:41] all those who have come to hear the word
[1:14:43] all those who have come to participate
[1:14:45] to play in the musical realm Lord and
[1:14:48] those who have sang father Lord each one
[1:14:50] Desiring to to hear from you father we
[1:14:54] pray that you would bless them
[1:14:55] abundantly for their efforts Lord father
[1:14:57] that when we leave here today we would
[1:14:59] say truly we heard from you Lord Jesus
[1:15:01] that's why we've gathered father we
[1:15:03] haven't come to hear from a man oh
[1:15:05] Father we pray that you would just be
[1:15:07] glorified in every aspect of this
[1:15:08] service Lord be with those who are
[1:15:10] streaming now father wherever they are
[1:15:12] we pray that you would just flood their
[1:15:14] living rooms Lord wherever it is they're
[1:15:16] at maybe their basements maybe their
[1:15:18] cars father wherever it is Lord make
[1:15:20] your presence known we ask in the name
[1:15:23] of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[1:15:26] amen God bless you this morning thank
[1:15:29] you musicians
[1:15:30] certainly wonderful to have the
[1:15:33] musicians the many many talents in the
[1:15:35] body
[1:15:36] I I just think it's tremendous
[1:15:41] we just want to turn to Romans chapter
[1:15:43] 12 again this week
[1:15:46] I trust it's okay
[1:15:56] I believe that I'm just
[1:15:59] just about over this thing in my own
[1:16:01] body
[1:16:04] certainly thankful for the
[1:16:07] thankful for the illnesses because
[1:16:09] without them we wouldn't know that he's
[1:16:10] a Healer
[1:16:13] we have to see the law of the contrast
[1:16:15] to fully appreciate it unfortunately in
[1:16:17] this hybrid condition otherwise we get
[1:16:19] prideful and we get full of ourselves
[1:16:21] and we think that everything that
[1:16:23] happens is because we do it but the Lord
[1:16:26] shows us that no he he does it all
[1:16:30] Romans chapter 12
[1:16:34] we'll just start with verse one
[1:16:36] I beseech you therefore brethren
[1:16:38] by the mercies of God
[1:16:40] that ye present your bodies a Living
[1:16:42] Sacrifice holy
[1:16:45] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:16:47] reasonable service
[1:16:49] in my Bible the footnote there it says
[1:16:51] yield
[1:16:53] your bodies
[1:16:55] verse 2 says and be not conformed to
[1:16:58] this world but be ye transformed by the
[1:17:02] renewing of your mind
[1:17:03] that ye may prove what is that good and
[1:17:07] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:17:10] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[1:17:14] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:17:16] your word we know that it's eternal
[1:17:19] and we know there's no other Foundation
[1:17:21] Lord Jesus that we would desire to build
[1:17:24] our our spiritual health upon Lord we
[1:17:27] know that any other foundation will be
[1:17:29] washed away we know that every other
[1:17:31] foundation will be Tried by fire in this
[1:17:34] next judgment that's coming to this
[1:17:36] world lord it's not going to be washed
[1:17:38] away by a flood and every man's Works
[1:17:41] will be made manifest Lord Jesus we pray
[1:17:44] that you would just be glorified now
[1:17:46] when all that's said and done that you
[1:17:47] would take this bread of life once again
[1:17:49] and break it open fresh to us Lord Jesus
[1:17:52] that it would be nourishing to our
[1:17:54] spiritual life that when we leave here
[1:17:56] father we would say that truly you spoke
[1:17:58] to us while we walked with you along the
[1:18:00] way we love you father and we thank you
[1:18:03] Lord and we ask all these things now in
[1:18:05] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[1:18:08] bless you this morning you may be seated
[1:18:13] just a few announcements we
[1:18:15] want to say farewell to Brother John
[1:18:18] Gunn one this is his last service with
[1:18:21] us
[1:18:21] and we'll be going for lunch after
[1:18:23] service and if anybody is Desiring to
[1:18:26] come we certainly wouldn't appreciate
[1:18:27] your company with us we have
[1:18:29] reservations made for a few people so we
[1:18:32] certainly would enjoy your company if
[1:18:34] you'd like to come

[1:18:38] wish him well he's been so journeying
[1:18:40] with us in Calgary for a year now as uh
[1:18:44] a doctor and I believe it's an emergency
[1:18:47] room doctor not a student and now he's
[1:18:51] earned his stripes as it were and he's
[1:18:54] taken on a job up north I don't think
[1:18:56] it's in Edmonton is it North of Edmonton
[1:18:58] brother
[1:18:59] it's in Edmonton okay so that's
[1:19:01] wonderful he gets to go back to his home
[1:19:03] church and and his family that's a
[1:19:05] tremendous opportunity so greet brother
[1:19:07] John if you don't get to come for lunch
[1:19:09] with us this afternoon the brennans are
[1:19:11] heading back to Georgia they said this
[1:19:12] is their last service with us as well so
[1:19:15] be sure to greet them I invited them for
[1:19:17] lunch but they have plans already so
[1:19:19] just make sure you shake their hands and
[1:19:21] say God bless you it certainly is
[1:19:22] wonderful to see you once again

[1:19:30] just a wonderful time of fellowship and
[1:19:33] uh we have the worship service tonight

[1:19:36] like to bring by all means come on if
[1:19:39] you play an instrument you'd like to
[1:19:40] play uh certainly a wonderful time if
[1:19:42] you just want to come and sing if you
[1:19:44] just want to come and and just sit and
[1:19:46] not do a thing you're welcome to do that
[1:19:48] and I trust it will be a blessing
[1:19:50] because the atmosphere that's created is
[1:19:52] just wonderful
[1:19:53] so God bless you this morning this this
[1:19:56] morning I really want to carry on with
[1:19:58] the thought that we've been talking
[1:19:59] about transformation and and and the the
[1:20:04] translation and
[1:20:06] Transfiguration all of the all of the
[1:20:09] thoughts about the body change
[1:20:12] but I I just thought this morning maybe
[1:20:15] for a little bit we could talk about
[1:20:16] this in in the way that not not so much
[1:20:20] as we have been in the past talking
[1:20:21] about being transformed we know that we
[1:20:24] need to be transformed and the whole
[1:20:25] world knows that they need to be
[1:20:27] transformed whether they consciously
[1:20:28] recognize it or not that's why there's
[1:20:30] people trying to change their bodies and
[1:20:32] and alter things and and have things
[1:20:34] made differently on the outside but what
[1:20:37] I want to talk about today many times we
[1:20:38] can say the the the the the the problem
[1:20:41] this is the problem but I want to get to
[1:20:43] potentially what the solution is with
[1:20:45] this we know the the what but but let's
[1:20:48] get into the how it's one thing to say
[1:20:51] that we need to be transformed but how
[1:20:54] do we get transformed brothers and
[1:20:55] sisters and this is what I think is so
[1:20:57] crucial for us especially in our day the
[1:21:00] word of God says be not conformed to
[1:21:03] this world don't try and get worldly
[1:21:05] don't try and dress worldly don't try
[1:21:08] and listen worldly don't try and watch
[1:21:10] worldly don't try and be worldly trying
[1:21:12] to be worldly is contrary to the word of
[1:21:15] God I forgot to say God bless you Sister
[1:21:17] Rosie it's a pleasure to have you with
[1:21:19] us she was in India and she has returned
[1:21:22] she just got back last night and her
[1:21:25] desire was to be in service so I said
[1:21:27] boy if you feel tired
[1:21:29] we understand
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:34] but you know we don't want to be
[1:21:35] conformed to this world we don't want to
[1:21:37] look worldly we don't want to talk
[1:21:39] worldly even though you know what I'm
[1:21:41] guilty I like to use worldly words
[1:21:43] sometimes because it sounds cool but is
[1:21:45] that according to the word of God I'll
[1:21:47] say no and I'll accept that correction
[1:21:48] myself right now we don't want to
[1:21:51] conform to this world brothers and
[1:21:52] sisters we've got to live a testimony of
[1:21:54] Jesus Christ where we're Christ like
[1:21:57] that's what Christian means
[1:22:00] but be not conformed to this world but
[1:22:03] be ye transformed we've we've labored on
[1:22:06] this be transformed
[1:22:08] by the renewing of your mind that's what
[1:22:11] I want to talk about today brothers and
[1:22:13] sisters by the renewing of our minds our
[1:22:16] minds we say many times in the world
[1:22:18] that our eyes are the gateway to the
[1:22:20] soul brothers and sisters our minds are
[1:22:22] the gateway to our soul we know that the
[1:22:25] word of God says as a man thinketh in
[1:22:26] his heart and we know brother Branham he
[1:22:28] brings this so clearly I don't think
[1:22:30] I've ever heard anybody else say it has
[1:22:31] anybody else ever heard anybody else say
[1:22:33] it brother Branham says how do you think
[1:22:34] with your heart isn't a heart just a
[1:22:36] muscle that pumps it's it's controlled
[1:22:39] by electricity that comes from the
[1:22:40] central nervous system that just sends
[1:22:42] pulses sometimes they get interrupted
[1:22:45] and you need to actually have a doctor's
[1:22:47] intervention and they put in a pacemaker
[1:22:48] and it causes a heart to beat more
[1:22:50] regular but but how do you think inside
[1:22:52] your heart don't you think inside your
[1:22:54] your brain isn't the brain where it
[1:22:56] happens the word of God says as a man
[1:22:57] thinketh in his heart
[1:22:59] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:23:02] mouth speaketh how does a heart have
[1:23:04] anything but blood inside of it it's
[1:23:06] talking about the Mind brothers and
[1:23:08] sisters and I don't want to try and put
[1:23:09] words in it and I don't want to twist
[1:23:11] the word of God but I just want to bring
[1:23:12] out sort of what the prophet says in a
[1:23:14] high level he's talking about our hearts
[1:23:16] and our our minds getting into the the
[1:23:19] root of all Humanity right inside the
[1:23:22] man and and this word renewing I think
[1:23:25] is such an important word out of
[1:23:27] Strong's it's G three four two
[1:23:32] it's an
[1:23:35] anacanni osis I apologize I'm probably
[1:23:38] pronouncing it way wrong
[1:23:40] but I just want to say this it's such a
[1:23:43] simple thing the the Strong's
[1:23:45] Concordance says it means to renovate
[1:23:48] and when I read this as I looked into it
[1:23:50] I was like oh my I know how to renovate
[1:23:52] I know how to renovate I know exactly
[1:23:54] how to renovate and there's some steps
[1:23:56] that you have to take to be able to
[1:23:57] renovate brothers and sisters I'm not
[1:23:59] going to give us a full rundown but I'm
[1:24:01] just going to do sort of a high level
[1:24:02] flyover there's some people that I know
[1:24:04] are attempting to do a renovation
[1:24:05] there's other people that might want to
[1:24:07] do one we we want to do one in time
[1:24:09] there's other people that do it for a
[1:24:10] living we used to do it for a living but
[1:24:13] the only way that you can do a real
[1:24:14] renovation anywhere on a building is to
[1:24:18] First assess that building you have to
[1:24:20] determine what there is there for a
[1:24:23] building and you have to look at it all
[1:24:25] around inside and out you can't leave a
[1:24:27] stone unturned sometimes people will be
[1:24:30] sloppy with it and they will leave
[1:24:31] Stones unturned they'll leave rooms not
[1:24:34] looked at they won't look at certain
[1:24:35] details and you know that's the
[1:24:37] difference between somebody that has
[1:24:39] experience and it doesn't have
[1:24:40] experience I'm really not trying to
[1:24:42] preach Renovations here but this is what
[1:24:43] this word means it's important
[1:24:47] if we're sloppy and we don't actually
[1:24:49] look at every aspect of our lives inside
[1:24:52] our minds
[1:24:54] we might miss a detail and you know what
[1:24:56] the biggest thing with Renovations is
[1:24:58] when you miss the detail brothers and
[1:24:59] sisters anything can be fixed people ask
[1:25:01] me can we do that can you do that and I
[1:25:04] always say you can do anything
[1:25:06] it just comes down to time and money how
[1:25:09] much money have you got if you leave a
[1:25:10] detail out if you miss a detail it gets
[1:25:13] expensive
[1:25:14] and it costs time and we know in our
[1:25:17] lives as humans if we let a little bit
[1:25:19] of sin
[1:25:24] if we let a little bit of sin in our
[1:25:25] lives something that's overlooked that's
[1:25:27] just not dealt with all the way
[1:25:29] something that's just lingering there in
[1:25:30] the background and we just sweep it
[1:25:32] under the rug and say I slept it under
[1:25:33] the rug and I put it under the blood
[1:25:35] it's all gone it's dealt with I don't
[1:25:36] have to worry about it anymore if you
[1:25:38] didn't do what the word of God says to
[1:25:40] go to your brother or sister and and do
[1:25:42] everything you can to try and make the
[1:25:43] situation right then you haven't dealt
[1:25:45] with it and if that thing lays there you
[1:25:47] can have 20 years go by and that thing
[1:25:49] is still going to be there
[1:25:50] and the thing is Satan knows it Satan
[1:25:53] will know that thing is there and he's
[1:25:55] going to have every right to come and
[1:25:56] tap dance in your land but when we have
[1:25:59] that little detail that's Overlook
[1:26:01] brothers and sisters it's going to cost
[1:26:03] us
[1:26:03] 20 years down the road it's so much less
[1:26:06] expensive to just deal with it when we
[1:26:08] have the situation at hand
[1:26:10] that's why when we renovate we want to
[1:26:12] make sure we renovate properly and
[1:26:14] that's why brothers and sisters we can
[1:26:15] just get right to the punch line like I
[1:26:16] always do you know what there's only one
[1:26:18] way one truth and one life we can talk
[1:26:20] about the message of the hour and that's
[1:26:21] great and God sent a prophet that's
[1:26:23] great but have ye received the Holy
[1:26:25] Ghost since ye believed that God sent a
[1:26:27] prophet because that's where the rubber
[1:26:29] meets the road outside of of a new birth
[1:26:31] experience brothers and sisters we're
[1:26:33] all just fellowshipping together and you
[1:26:35] know we're kind of good people and
[1:26:36] having kind of a good time but what good
[1:26:38] is it if we don't have the baptism of
[1:26:40] the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:26:42] there's so many promises in the Bible
[1:26:45] that are are eligible for us to
[1:26:47] experience and enjoy
[1:26:49] but the first step for all of this to
[1:26:52] renovate properly is to assess it
[1:26:53] properly and as Believers we want to
[1:26:56] assess it according to the word of God
[1:26:58] we don't want to assess it according to
[1:27:00] what our church says according to what
[1:27:03] maybe our parents said according to what
[1:27:06] maybe our Traditions have told us and
[1:27:09] maybe even our culture has has dictated
[1:27:12] something about that that's not the way
[1:27:14] it is at all we want the Bible to be the
[1:27:16] absolute it has to be the absolute we've
[1:27:18] got to have an absolute otherwise we're
[1:27:20] just what are we doing
[1:27:23] you know the second step in a in a in
[1:27:26] getting after a renovation we know that
[1:27:28] the natural types of spiritual so I
[1:27:30] thought that it would be okay to just go
[1:27:31] this way a little bit
[1:27:33] um the second step is is to determine
[1:27:35] what parts of the of the renovation are
[1:27:37] going to be infected because you're not
[1:27:40] building new
[1:27:41] you're renovating right that's that's
[1:27:43] kind of what this this renewing is it's
[1:27:46] renovating we're not building new
[1:27:49] building new before the foundation of
[1:27:51] the world has already happened but we
[1:27:53] know that when we were built new we
[1:27:55] bypassed our theophanese our perfect
[1:27:56] condition our perfect bodies and we came
[1:27:58] into this word world born and sin shaped
[1:28:01] and iniquity come into this world
[1:28:02] speaking lies under the curse that Adam
[1:28:05] and Eve caused the fall here we are in
[1:28:08] this world
[1:28:09] and we have got to be transformed we've
[1:28:12] got to renew our mind that's the only
[1:28:14] way we're going to be transformed and
[1:28:16] the only way we're going to be
[1:28:16] transformed is to renew our mind
[1:28:18] according to the word of God and it's
[1:28:20] just beautiful because we had a prophet
[1:28:22] in our day come and say you know what if
[1:28:24] you can't take my word for it take God's
[1:28:27] word for it it's so beautiful for me
[1:28:30] that brought me so much rest many times
[1:28:32] when when people would say the word
[1:28:34] prophet in the past I would be like whoa
[1:28:37] aren't they the ones that actually take
[1:28:40] people into a jungle and and get them to
[1:28:43] starve themselves to death or in the
[1:28:45] name of Jesus Christ or aren't they the
[1:28:47] ones that take them into a jungle and
[1:28:49] actually get them all to drink Kool-Aid
[1:28:50] because it's the Rapture it's the time
[1:28:52] to go all of these things have elements
[1:28:55] to truth to them and the people
[1:28:56] genuinely want to believe but you know
[1:28:59] brother Branham he says it very clearly
[1:29:00] that you can be so sincere
[1:29:02] but sincerely wrong brothers and sisters
[1:29:05] and we want to be right and and the only
[1:29:08] way that we can be right is to be right
[1:29:09] according to the word of God
[1:29:14] excuse me
[1:29:16] because if you have someone who claims
[1:29:17] to be a prophet
[1:29:19] and and they're outside of the word of
[1:29:21] God you can just leave it alone and say
[1:29:23] no you know it's incorrect
[1:29:26] it doesn't get any clearer than that
[1:29:29] but many times when that word Prophet is
[1:29:31] used it causes a little bit of anxiety
[1:29:35] but I would say just take it back to the
[1:29:36] word and see if what that man says is
[1:29:39] according to the word of God and if it
[1:29:40] is brothers and sisters you can follow
[1:29:41] it you can have rest you can know that
[1:29:43] it's okay but you know the second step
[1:29:45] in a renovation is to look at what parts
[1:29:46] are going to be affected and and there's
[1:29:49] parts that you want to change and
[1:29:50] there's parts that you don't want to
[1:29:52] change and and Naturally Speaking that's
[1:29:54] the way it is in your house we're not
[1:29:56] like I said we're not talking about
[1:29:57] building new we're talking about
[1:29:58] renovating so we're going to take an
[1:30:00] existing building and we're going to
[1:30:01] change a part of it and when we're going
[1:30:03] to renew that part we need to determine
[1:30:05] how do you get that part to fit the rest
[1:30:08] of the building because if you're going
[1:30:10] to renovate it you don't want to have
[1:30:11] one part look totally different than all
[1:30:13] the rest of it even though you would
[1:30:15] like it to be newer I I learned in in in
[1:30:18] the renovation business that that's one
[1:30:20] of the most difficult things there is is
[1:30:21] to actually blend the old with the new
[1:30:24] and make it look like it was supposed to
[1:30:25] be that way and a great example of that
[1:30:27] is on the outside of a building when you
[1:30:29] do an addition or when you change
[1:30:31] Windows or you do something really
[1:30:33] dramatic on the outside of a building
[1:30:34] you don't want to put a great big
[1:30:36] building on top of the outside of a
[1:30:38] building as an addition that's hanging
[1:30:40] out over the street it will look like a
[1:30:42] sore thumb
[1:30:44] you want to make it so that it looks
[1:30:45] like it's supposed to be there
[1:30:47] and isn't it interesting that when we
[1:30:49] get renovated when we get renewed in our
[1:30:52] minds the world will look at us and say
[1:30:54] you look like the same person
[1:30:56] you don't look any different
[1:30:58] but you won't be the same person because
[1:30:59] you won't talk the same you won't want
[1:31:01] to go to the same places you won't want
[1:31:04] to hang out with the same people you
[1:31:06] won't want to look at the same things
[1:31:07] you won't want to listen to the same
[1:31:09] music something happens on the inside
[1:31:11] it's not an outward fix
[1:31:15] but sometimes there's things that get
[1:31:16] overlooked when when you're going to do
[1:31:19] a renovation
[1:31:20] and and those things I I think it's just
[1:31:24] amazing when you look at this if you
[1:31:25] have any experience with Renovations one
[1:31:27] of the things that is so tremendous when
[1:31:29] you're doing a renovation because you're
[1:31:31] not changing a whole building remember
[1:31:32] you're only changing one part of it
[1:31:34] um is is the parts that aren't going to
[1:31:36] be fixed you have got to protect them
[1:31:38] you have to guard them and you have to
[1:31:40] guard them carefully and many times when
[1:31:43] we were doing renovations people would
[1:31:44] say why would you put so much money
[1:31:45] towards that because the dust from
[1:31:48] Renovations is nasty and I just can't
[1:31:50] help but think you know brothers and
[1:31:51] sisters when we're renovating Our Lives
[1:31:53] there's things in our lives that if we
[1:31:55] don't protect the rest of it while we're
[1:31:57] doing that we can actually get a little
[1:31:59] bit Dusty on other parts of our lives
[1:32:01] and and we don't want that and I would
[1:32:03] just liken the dust to be like sin as
[1:32:05] we're sweeping out all of that sin in
[1:32:07] our lives and getting rid of all that
[1:32:08] garbage it can actually get on the other
[1:32:11] parts of our life if we're not careful
[1:32:13] we have to be so careful to guard those
[1:32:15] areas in our lives
[1:32:18] but you know I just want to say this
[1:32:21] when it comes to our lives it's easy to
[1:32:23] do a comparison and say you know I've
[1:32:25] renovated and and we can talk about
[1:32:28] protecting protection budgets and we can
[1:32:30] talk about renovation budgets and and
[1:32:33] how you renovate and all the stuff the
[1:32:35] engineering and everything that would go
[1:32:36] into that but you know when we're
[1:32:38] talking about our lives there's nothing
[1:32:40] in our lives that we really want to be
[1:32:42] preserving is there when we're going to
[1:32:44] renew our minds I would say this
[1:32:47] brothers and sisters when we're
[1:32:48] renovating Our Lives when we're renewing
[1:32:51] our minds
[1:32:53] we're going to do a complete gut
[1:32:55] and if you're not willing to do a
[1:32:57] complete gut then you're not going to be
[1:32:58] completely renewed we have to be willing
[1:33:01] to subject ourselves entirely to the
[1:33:04] word of God if we have just a portion
[1:33:06] that I'm willing to renovate in this
[1:33:08] body in this Temple I just want to
[1:33:09] renovate my bathroom that's all I want
[1:33:11] to do or I just want to renovate the
[1:33:12] kitchen in my life that's all I want to
[1:33:14] do God's going to say that's great I'll
[1:33:16] give you a brand new kitchen I'll give
[1:33:17] you a brand new bathroom you can have
[1:33:18] both of those that's no problem but what
[1:33:20] about the rest of your house brother
[1:33:22] Brandon preaches that message doors
[1:33:23] indoor if there's a place that we're
[1:33:25] reserving that we're keeping back from
[1:33:27] him he's not going to be able to to deal
[1:33:29] with us the way we we really want him to
[1:33:32] we've got to be willing to go to the
[1:33:34] complete gut Renault and you know many
[1:33:36] times when people look at that that's
[1:33:38] expensive that's the most expensive
[1:33:40] renovation that there is where you take
[1:33:42] everything out of the building and you
[1:33:43] just have the walls and maybe you even
[1:33:45] don't even have the windows in the
[1:33:47] building maybe you're going to do an
[1:33:48] addition but you strip absolutely
[1:33:50] everything out and you just say you know
[1:33:51] what it's an open budget do everything
[1:33:53] that you need to do to make this
[1:33:54] renovation brand new perfect so it looks
[1:33:57] like a brand new building and you know
[1:33:59] that's what happens to the human when we
[1:34:01] do get renovated when we renew our minds
[1:34:03] according to what the word of God says
[1:34:05] being not conformed to this world but
[1:34:06] being transformed by the renewing of
[1:34:09] your mind why do we do that so that we
[1:34:12] can prove what is that good and
[1:34:15] acceptable and perfect will of God that
[1:34:17] we can show that we become a new
[1:34:20] creature in Christ Jesus but not just in
[1:34:24] Christ Jesus when we're in church that
[1:34:26] Christ Jesus is actually inside of us
[1:34:29] and as we live our lives we demonstrate
[1:34:31] the life of Christ Jesus to the world
[1:34:34] around us and it just comes down to this
[1:34:36] brothers and sisters get saved
[1:34:38] just get saved
[1:34:40] we have to realize that it's only by his
[1:34:42] grace
[1:34:43] as we heard this morning it's only by
[1:34:45] his grace that we are saved can you
[1:34:47] imagine thinking about this we were
[1:34:49] driving yesterday we drove to Lethbridge
[1:34:51] and we went to talk to the Saints down
[1:34:53] there but we were just talking as we
[1:34:55] were driving and I was looking out at
[1:34:57] the Foothills and the mountains in the
[1:34:58] background just couldn't help but talk
[1:35:00] about how brother Branham he said you
[1:35:02] know I'm going to be singing that song
[1:35:03] Here we have the seventh angel messenger
[1:35:05] he's going to be singing that song
[1:35:07] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[1:35:11] saved a Wretch like Me throughout the
[1:35:13] Millennium out somewhere in the Rockies
[1:35:15] by Bamford Jasper
[1:35:17] how many people are going to be out
[1:35:19] there singing that same song my goodness
[1:35:21] what a tremendous thing it is to
[1:35:24] recognize Grace
[1:35:25] for oneself when we can recognize Grace
[1:35:29] then we understand oh it's not me at all
[1:35:31] the only thing I have to do is just
[1:35:33] surrender to it the only thing that I
[1:35:35] have to do is just say hey it's an open
[1:35:37] po
[1:35:39] you're the renovator and you've got the
[1:35:41] checkbook can you imagine that usually
[1:35:44] it's the homeowner that has the
[1:35:45] checkbook not this time brothers and
[1:35:47] sisters this time it's the Lord Jesus
[1:35:49] Christ
[1:35:50] we know Jeffersonville came up with
[1:35:52] those checkbooks at one time and and
[1:35:54] said that it was from the bank of heaven
[1:35:55] and you could just write in whatever
[1:35:57] your need was and it was a prayer
[1:35:59] request sheet and and it's just an
[1:36:01] amazing description of really what it's
[1:36:03] like
[1:36:05] brothers and sisters how do we renew our
[1:36:08] minds how do we do that there's one
[1:36:11] thing to talk about it it's so good to
[1:36:13] talk about it's amazing to think that we
[1:36:15] are already seated in Heavenly places in
[1:36:19] Christ Jesus and very much right now
[1:36:21] this moment Brothers and Sisters You Are
[1:36:24] we are
[1:36:27] and I just want to I just want to say
[1:36:29] that and pause there for a little bit
[1:36:31] because we have got to come to that
[1:36:33] place that we recognize that's where we
[1:36:35] stand
[1:36:37] We Stand seated in Heavenly places
[1:36:40] and what that means is that we're seated
[1:36:43] with authority
[1:36:44] because we know that Christ once he died
[1:36:46] and he went down into hell and took the
[1:36:48] keys of death and Hell from the devil
[1:36:50] and told him you are defeated and I told
[1:36:53] you you were and you were completely
[1:36:54] duped and now you can only wait until
[1:36:57] your time comes for the Lake of Fire
[1:36:59] you're going to wait for that he took
[1:37:01] those keys and he came up and he we know
[1:37:03] that he led captivity captive right and
[1:37:07] Abraham and Sarah they said oh can we
[1:37:09] just make a little Whistle Stop back in
[1:37:11] Jerusalem we just want to look at the
[1:37:12] home we just want to look at the Home
[1:37:14] Place we've done that recently the place
[1:37:16] that we moved from we drove past it
[1:37:18] there's something in the heart of a
[1:37:19] person that just remembers where they
[1:37:21] were and and it's nice to just go by
[1:37:23] once in a while but then he actually
[1:37:25] took them all up into heaven and what
[1:37:27] did he do after he conquered death and
[1:37:28] hell he went and sat down on the right
[1:37:30] hand of the Majesty
[1:37:32] and what that is is power brothers and
[1:37:35] sisters full Authority and power and
[1:37:38] that is where you are seated today not
[1:37:43] just in a chair in heaven somewhere with
[1:37:46] angels all around you you're seated in
[1:37:48] the throne with him
[1:37:52] many times we talk about the gates of
[1:37:54] hell they won't Prevail against the
[1:37:56] Revelation and you know what's fine and
[1:37:58] good to talk about the Revelation but
[1:37:59] let's connect the dots with the
[1:38:01] Revelation the Revelation isn't that God
[1:38:03] sent a prophet the Revelation isn't
[1:38:05] about the Seven Seals it's not about all
[1:38:08] of the Mysteries brothers and sisters
[1:38:09] it's about the mystery of Who You Are
[1:38:12] that one that he chose Grace that one
[1:38:16] woman amongst many women the church
[1:38:19] being feminine one woman being called
[1:38:22] out
[1:38:23] and many times we can say it hey I'm I'm
[1:38:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:28] if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:29] you're going to live this word
[1:38:32] all of it
[1:38:34] not going to have to try and create a
[1:38:37] list of do's and don'ts in our church
[1:38:38] this is what we do and this is what we
[1:38:40] don't and everything in between we need
[1:38:42] to size it up with the deacons and we
[1:38:44] need to have a little bit of a council
[1:38:46] meeting and and talk about the way
[1:38:48] things are no the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:50] is going to know what her husband likes
[1:38:52] we were having this conversation too
[1:38:54] weren't we Brothers Josue the husband he
[1:38:56] knows what his wife likes and the
[1:38:58] husband just does it for his wife and
[1:39:00] the wife she knows what her husband
[1:39:01] likes and she just does it for him she
[1:39:04] doesn't have to say don't you know I
[1:39:05] like this and she doesn't have to say
[1:39:07] don't you know I like that they just
[1:39:09] know because they love one another
[1:39:11] they're a part of one another and they
[1:39:13] want to serve one another
[1:39:15] but how do we renew our minds brothers
[1:39:17] and sisters I just want to say it this
[1:39:19] way today just in my own little way just
[1:39:21] take inventory of your mind look at your
[1:39:25] beliefs I remember brother Ken he said
[1:39:27] one time take 10 of the most important
[1:39:30] items in your life and write them down
[1:39:32] what are the 10 most fundamental beliefs
[1:39:35] that you have in your life write them
[1:39:37] out put them on a page and then take
[1:39:39] them back and line them up with the word
[1:39:41] of God do they line up with the word of
[1:39:43] God if they don't line up with the word
[1:39:44] of God it's not a big deal just get rid
[1:39:46] of it just push it to the side but if it
[1:39:49] does line up with the word of God say
[1:39:51] Amen to it
[1:39:53] we need to take an inventory of Our
[1:39:55] Lives that's how we renew our mind and
[1:39:57] you know Paul said I Die daily I want to
[1:40:00] say this I believe Paul renewed his mind
[1:40:02] daily Paul took inventory daily and said
[1:40:05] did I hurt that person that I spoke to
[1:40:07] today did the words that came out of my
[1:40:09] mouth yesterday really cause pain in
[1:40:11] that person did I did I overstep
[1:40:13] somewhere did I do something Lord show
[1:40:15] me help me and as he would pray the Lord
[1:40:17] would show him and help him
[1:40:20] same thing for us
[1:40:22] if we're willing to allow him
[1:40:24] and that's the key we've got to be
[1:40:26] willing to allow him to just come and
[1:40:27] renew my mind come and and take a look
[1:40:30] on the inside take a walk through my
[1:40:31] life take a look at my my my my
[1:40:33] listenings take a look at my viewings
[1:40:36] take a look at my thoughts take a look
[1:40:38] at every single aspect of my life and if
[1:40:41] you're willing to do that Lord I know
[1:40:43] that you'll be able to help me and
[1:40:44] unless we're willing to do that brothers
[1:40:46] and sisters we're just going to remain
[1:40:47] as church members we're not going to
[1:40:49] take that next step to get to that place
[1:40:51] where we really want to be where when we
[1:40:54] say we know where the Bride of Jesus
[1:40:55] Christ and Satan hears our voice and
[1:40:57] trembles
[1:40:59] because he doesn't believe that we're
[1:41:01] the Bride of Jesus Christ if he believed
[1:41:04] that we were the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:41:05] he wouldn't come near us because he
[1:41:08] knows he would get a spanking he knows
[1:41:10] that he wouldn't be able to touch us but
[1:41:12] he doesn't believe it for a second just
[1:41:14] like they didn't he didn't believe that
[1:41:15] Jesus was the Christ
[1:41:17] otherwise he wouldn't have put him on
[1:41:19] the cross that spelled his Doom
[1:41:23] but just like
[1:41:24] Jesus came and totally totally duped the
[1:41:28] devil
[1:41:29] now you've come
[1:41:31] and he's chosen you to totally dupe the
[1:41:34] devil once again
[1:41:36] as his bride and he doesn't believe it
[1:41:40] for a second and you know I think it's
[1:41:42] just incredible for us to be able to
[1:41:44] gather together this way to be able to
[1:41:46] talk about the message of the hour and
[1:41:48] to recognize that we are already seated
[1:41:50] in Heavenly places all the Mysteries
[1:41:51] throughout all the ages all those loose
[1:41:53] ends they're now history I'm not here to
[1:41:55] try and teach us all the Loose Ends what
[1:41:58] I want to do is teach us the new birth I
[1:42:00] want to teach us to renew our minds to
[1:42:02] make sure that we are transformed the
[1:42:04] right way from the inside out that when
[1:42:06] we go out into this world we don't have
[1:42:08] to show people that we're a new creature
[1:42:10] created by some pharmacist or some
[1:42:12] doctor somewhere but we are truly new
[1:42:15] creatures in Christ Jesus and the people
[1:42:17] in this world will say what is it about
[1:42:19] you why do you behave the way that you
[1:42:21] behave and then we'll have a quick
[1:42:23] answer for them that it's the Lord Jesus
[1:42:24] Christ it's the word of God living out
[1:42:27] through me because I've taken the book
[1:42:28] according to Revelations 10 8-13 and
[1:42:31] I've eaten that book that book is now a
[1:42:33] part of me and it exudes through every
[1:42:36] single part of of my life in my business
[1:42:38] in my school in my travel in my home
[1:42:40] life in my relationships in my church in
[1:42:43] every single aspect of my life
[1:42:45] everywhere I go people see Christ Jesus
[1:42:47] living out through me isn't that what we
[1:42:49] want brothers and sisters the only way
[1:42:51] we're going to get there is to take
[1:42:52] inventory in our lives and look at our
[1:42:54] beliefs look at our Traditions do they
[1:42:56] align with the word of God or do they
[1:42:58] not if they don't it's not a big deal
[1:43:00] like I said just set them to the side I
[1:43:02] said throw it away but just maybe set it
[1:43:04] to the side just just push it off just a
[1:43:06] little bit nobody wants to cause
[1:43:08] conflict or or a frustration or anger
[1:43:11] but you know what we've we've got to
[1:43:12] believe the word of God that's the only
[1:43:14] thing that's going to get us out of here
[1:43:15] I've got the quote but I'm going to jump
[1:43:16] to it right now you know what brother
[1:43:17] Branham said we all want to get the
[1:43:19] token don't we the token of the Holy
[1:43:21] Ghost in our lives but there's only one
[1:43:22] way we're going to get that token and
[1:43:24] that's only by full obedience to the
[1:43:27] entire word is going to entitle us to
[1:43:30] the Token anything outside of that
[1:43:31] brothers and sisters we're going to
[1:43:33] experience other people who have come
[1:43:35] according to that instruction
[1:43:38] because there are people who will get
[1:43:40] the token and there are blessings for
[1:43:43] hanging out with people that have the
[1:43:44] token there are
[1:43:46] the people that truly have the token
[1:43:48] they can sing and create an atmosphere
[1:43:51] the people that truly have a token they
[1:43:53] can speak the word of God and create an
[1:43:55] atmosphere we know that the prophet said
[1:43:58] we have the ability to speak worlds and
[1:44:00] go and inhabit them
[1:44:02] but we have no need to do that so why
[1:44:04] would we
[1:44:05] we need to make sure that we are
[1:44:07] actually carrying that token in our
[1:44:09] lives for ourselves but the only way
[1:44:12] we're going to do it brothers and
[1:44:12] sisters is to be renewed in our minds to
[1:44:15] make sure that this mind lines up with
[1:44:17] the word of God because we know the word
[1:44:18] of God said let this mind be in you
[1:44:21] there was also in Christ Jesus so how
[1:44:23] could we have any other mind and we know
[1:44:25] that that's one of the
[1:44:26] one of them this world today and it
[1:44:28] happened many many years ago was that
[1:44:30] the woman was given the ability to vote
[1:44:32] now that might sound shocking to say it
[1:44:34] but what happened was now we have
[1:44:36] critical thinking that's happening in
[1:44:39] the world and women will say I don't
[1:44:41] have to listen to the voice of my
[1:44:42] husband I can be the one who is in
[1:44:44] control I'm the one to the point where
[1:44:47] maybe even people won't even take their
[1:44:49] husband's name when they get married a
[1:44:50] husband and wife will say no no I don't
[1:44:52] have to actually take his name I can
[1:44:54] keep my own name and we see it many
[1:44:56] times there'll be a hyphenated name or
[1:44:58] they'll just take the woman's name
[1:45:00] and we know that the worst one or maybe
[1:45:02] what happens I shouldn't say the worst
[1:45:05] one forgive me what happens is people
[1:45:07] just disregard marriage altogether
[1:45:08] entirely
[1:45:10] and just live together
[1:45:12] but we know that you're actually married
[1:45:14] and if you want to say that you're not
[1:45:16] officially on paper then why is it that
[1:45:19] there is actually a law on the land that
[1:45:20] says there is a common law law
[1:45:23] where when you live together you're
[1:45:24] still responsible financially for one
[1:45:27] another and physically and in many
[1:45:30] different ways it's the way it works we
[1:45:32] can deny it all we want but you know
[1:45:34] what's the perversion to the original
[1:45:37] the word of God and that's what I want
[1:45:38] to get to brothers and sisters when when
[1:45:40] we have to say I as a woman and and I
[1:45:44] want to type this spiritually so don't
[1:45:46] don't don't think I'm coming down on on
[1:45:48] the sisters in in the congregation
[1:45:50] because I'm not but what can happen is
[1:45:52] we can say well I need to be critical
[1:45:54] about the thinking that I have about
[1:45:56] what I'm hearing and I need to make a
[1:45:59] decision for myself based on all of the
[1:46:02] factors that I see with my own senses to
[1:46:05] see whether this is actually going to be
[1:46:06] something that I accept and apply in my
[1:46:08] own life or not but that's not what Paul
[1:46:10] is saying here he's saying just be
[1:46:12] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:46:14] according to the word of God you need to
[1:46:15] listen to the word of God for your day
[1:46:17] this was Paul speaking to the church in
[1:46:20] Rome and they needed to listen to what
[1:46:22] he had to say you need to stop thinking
[1:46:23] about the way the Romans have been
[1:46:25] teaching for centuries and you need to
[1:46:27] start listening to the way God has
[1:46:29] actually taken and used me as the
[1:46:31] prophet for the age to show you that you
[1:46:34] need to be transformed you need to have
[1:46:36] a body change but it's only going to
[1:46:39] happen from the inside out it's not
[1:46:41] going to happen from the outside in
[1:46:43] but why renew brothers and sisters we've
[1:46:46] talked about how kind of
[1:46:50] the what and the how
[1:46:52] why I already jumped to it because we
[1:46:55] want the token in our lives don't you
[1:46:57] don't you want the token of the Holy
[1:46:59] Ghost in your life don't you want to
[1:47:01] know for sure that you've got the holy
[1:47:02] ghost in your life brother Branham says
[1:47:04] it's like having a baby
[1:47:06] How could a woman ever have a baby and
[1:47:08] not know that she had a baby
[1:47:11] to me I find that astounding
[1:47:14] because many times people don't know
[1:47:15] whether they've got the Holy Ghost for
[1:47:16] sure
[1:47:17] and you know what I just want to
[1:47:19] encourage you if you have the ability to
[1:47:21] receive the word for your day you've got
[1:47:23] the holy ghost in your life
[1:47:25] that's the identification because if you
[1:47:27] can receive the word for your day if you
[1:47:29] can receive the word for your day you're
[1:47:31] going to live the word for your day
[1:47:33] you're not just gonna say oh I believe
[1:47:35] God sent a prophet and I believe the
[1:47:36] message of the hour and I'm a good
[1:47:38] Christian
[1:47:39] and then go and live whatever else you
[1:47:41] do you're going to live your life
[1:47:42] according to it and when someone brings
[1:47:44] correction when God uses someone to
[1:47:46] bring correction we're going to say hold
[1:47:48] on a second I'm going to recalibrate I'm
[1:47:51] going to go and get on my knees and say
[1:47:52] well I don't think I like what they said
[1:47:54] to me but Lord is that you speaking to
[1:47:57] me we're going to accept the correction
[1:47:59] that God brings to us and we know that
[1:48:01] if we can't accept the correction that
[1:48:03] God brings to us then we're fatherless
[1:48:05] children we don't have a father it's a
[1:48:07] terrible place to be but you know we're
[1:48:09] not living in an age where we need to
[1:48:11] sugarcoat this brothers and sisters we
[1:48:13] need to know that we've got the Holy
[1:48:14] Ghost because one of these days it's not
[1:48:16] going to be the same one of these days
[1:48:18] we're going home
[1:48:20] I hope we can sing that song tonight
[1:48:22] it's going home time
[1:48:24] I I hope so brother Mervin maybe you can
[1:48:27] help us with that but you know brothers
[1:48:29] and sisters it's going home time it's
[1:48:31] not getting comfortable here time
[1:48:33] as much as there's things in this life
[1:48:35] that we like and we appreciate and we
[1:48:37] have to sojourn here and while we're
[1:48:39] here we we do things while we're here to
[1:48:41] to pass the time to fellowship with one
[1:48:44] another and and on and on it goes but we
[1:48:47] don't love this world we don't love the
[1:48:49] things of this world we love the word of
[1:48:51] God and you know what else we love one
[1:48:54] another
[1:48:55] and the love for one another shows that
[1:48:57] we love the word of God
[1:49:00] but why renew
[1:49:01] because full obedience brothers and
[1:49:03] sisters entitles us to the token brother
[1:49:05] Branham says it but oh brother when that
[1:49:08] token is once placed in your heart
[1:49:11] and you know it's the resurrection of
[1:49:13] Jesus Christ I love this not 2000 years
[1:49:16] ago it's the resurrection of Jesus
[1:49:18] Christ in you
[1:49:20] something is happening
[1:49:23] there isn't nothing going to turn you
[1:49:26] you know where you belong
[1:49:29] I think it's so beautiful sometimes this
[1:49:32] can be just so common and and it just
[1:49:34] flows off our our lips I just want to
[1:49:37] pause here and just dwell on this for a
[1:49:39] little bit brothers and sisters when
[1:49:40] when the token is once placed in your
[1:49:43] heart and you know it's the resurrection
[1:49:46] of Christ in you something is happening
[1:49:49] I remember speaking to a brother who was
[1:49:51] talking to another brother who was a
[1:49:53] part of another website thing that came
[1:49:55] out and it stirred a lot of people away
[1:49:57] from the message of the hour and this
[1:49:59] one brother came to try and persuade
[1:50:01] this other brother all about this
[1:50:03] business and and and and to try and
[1:50:05] undermine the the validity of God
[1:50:07] sending a prophet and and you know the
[1:50:09] one brother he told this guy who was
[1:50:11] coming to try and persuade him he said
[1:50:13] you know what you're too late now
[1:50:14] because I already believe you're not
[1:50:17] going to persuade me any other way I
[1:50:20] love how brother Toby said it even if
[1:50:22] brother Branham were to come back from
[1:50:23] the grave come back as being a dead man
[1:50:26] to say that I made a mistake about the
[1:50:27] message of the hour there's people that
[1:50:29] are going to say it's too late I've got
[1:50:31] the token I believe you can't change me
[1:50:35] that's what brother Branham is talking
[1:50:37] about here but oh brother when the token
[1:50:39] is placed in your heart and you know
[1:50:41] it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:50:43] it's not the resurrection of the message
[1:50:45] of the hour it's not the resurrection of
[1:50:47] a prophet it's not the resurrection of a
[1:50:49] prophet's son it's the resurrection of
[1:50:52] Jesus Christ in you something happens
[1:50:55] there isn't nothing going to turn you
[1:50:57] you know where you belong full obedience
[1:51:00] to the whole word of God entitles you to
[1:51:04] the token and nothing else he says
[1:51:06] blessed is he that does all of his
[1:51:08] Commandments
[1:51:10] he might have right to the Tree of Life
[1:51:13] who wants right to the Tree of Life
[1:51:15] today
[1:51:16] I believe every one of us
[1:51:21] speaking about this token
[1:51:24] about being transformed
[1:51:26] but renewing our minds
[1:51:28] we want to renew our minds to the word
[1:51:30] of God brothers and sisters it's got to
[1:51:31] be to the word of God we all have got to
[1:51:34] get this token that we're talking about
[1:51:36] we know the token was I believe first
[1:51:38] mentioned in the Book of Genesis when
[1:51:40] the children of Israel were slaves in
[1:51:42] Goshen
[1:51:43] we've talked about this many times but
[1:51:45] just for the sake of this moment I'll
[1:51:46] bring it again the children of Israel
[1:51:48] are in bondage in Goshen and there's all
[1:51:52] the plagues Moses was sent and and he
[1:51:55] told Pharaoh over and over again let my
[1:51:57] people go and Pharaoh's heart was
[1:52:00] hardened by God it wasn't just Pharaoh
[1:52:02] the word of God says I Harden his heart
[1:52:05] I'll Harden his heart over and over
[1:52:07] again and anyways the last plague that's
[1:52:09] brought is the death plague the death
[1:52:12] angel is going to fly through the land
[1:52:14] and when that Death Angel flies through
[1:52:16] the land it's just gonna be whoever
[1:52:18] doesn't have the token whoever doesn't
[1:52:19] follow the prophet's word to the letter
[1:52:21] is going to die the firstborn of that
[1:52:24] family will be dead and you could
[1:52:26] imagine even the Believers in that day
[1:52:28] were checking and rechecking the
[1:52:31] husbands and the wives the wives were
[1:52:33] probably saying honey have you done it
[1:52:34] right are you sure maybe we should just
[1:52:36] compare what's going on let's just get
[1:52:38] the plans out that the prophet
[1:52:39] distributed to everyone and we'll just
[1:52:40] go and compare it to the house on the
[1:52:42] outside and make sure the blood is
[1:52:44] exactly the right height exactly the
[1:52:45] right place on the lintel and the
[1:52:47] doorpost everything has to be exactly
[1:52:49] the right way because if not our oldest
[1:52:51] son is dead tonight according to the
[1:52:53] word of the prophet
[1:52:56] exactly according to the word of the
[1:52:58] prophet
[1:52:59] full obedience entitles us to the Token
[1:53:01] full obedience to the word of God and I
[1:53:04] love the way brother Branham says this
[1:53:06] brothers and sisters full obedience to
[1:53:07] the full word of God
[1:53:10] we can't just take a part of the word
[1:53:12] and say well the other parts that I
[1:53:14] don't like they're for a different age
[1:53:16] they're for a different culture that was
[1:53:17] for back in Israel's day brother Branham
[1:53:19] said it very clearly the word of God
[1:53:21] means exactly what it says it is not
[1:53:24] something that we need to try and
[1:53:25] interpret because he brings the word of
[1:53:27] God to pass that's how he interprets the
[1:53:30] word of God in our lives
[1:53:34] book of Titus says not by works of
[1:53:36] righteousness which we have done
[1:53:39] but according to his Mercy he saved us
[1:53:43] by the washing of regeneration
[1:53:46] and renewing of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:50] we've talked about the five wise virgins
[1:53:53] and the five unwise virgins in the past
[1:53:55] and it's just a wonderful thing to think
[1:53:57] that you know they were all virgins
[1:53:59] weren't they
[1:54:01] Jesus gave that Parable and they're all
[1:54:03] virgins
[1:54:04] and they all had lamps
[1:54:06] they all slumbered and slept and they
[1:54:09] all had oil
[1:54:11] five of those virgins had more oil than
[1:54:13] the other five that's the difference
[1:54:15] and the five that had more oil they were
[1:54:18] renewing their oil
[1:54:20] they were renewing it but there came a
[1:54:22] point in time where they all slumbered
[1:54:23] and slept maybe they all went to bed
[1:54:26] and some of them had the token with them
[1:54:27] when they went to bed and some of them
[1:54:29] they just experienced everyone else's
[1:54:30] token when they went to bed and thought
[1:54:32] that they had the token
[1:54:34] we want to know where we stand brothers
[1:54:36] and sisters this ain't no time to play
[1:54:37] church this ain't a time to play the
[1:54:39] message this ain't a time to play we
[1:54:41] could leave this building and go in a
[1:54:43] rapture we could see things change very
[1:54:46] quickly in our lives but you know there
[1:54:49] is a renewing of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:51] according to the word and Titus here
[1:54:52] brothers and sisters and I just want to
[1:54:54] encourage us get that renewing get that
[1:54:56] oil make sure that you've got that oil
[1:54:58] lift up your cup we sing that song
[1:55:00] Here's my cup Lord I lift it up oh
[1:55:03] Father just fill it fill my cup until
[1:55:05] there's no more Lord Jesus I don't want
[1:55:07] to leave here with my cup partially full
[1:55:09] and mostly full and a little bit empty I
[1:55:12] want it running over David said my cup
[1:55:15] runneth over we need to make sure that
[1:55:18] our cups are running over with this oil
[1:55:19] brothers and sisters that's why we
[1:55:21] Gather in church isn't it
[1:55:23] that's why we come so that we can get
[1:55:25] our cups full of this oil and this oil
[1:55:27] is the Holy Ghost it's a type of the
[1:55:29] Holy Ghost we need to go out of here
[1:55:31] knowing that we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:55:32] because remember the devil Satan he is
[1:55:36] roaming around as a roaring lion seeing
[1:55:38] whom he can devour and I guarantee you
[1:55:40] he's going after those ones who are
[1:55:42] hanging out with the people that had the
[1:55:43] token he was going after those ones
[1:55:45] first because they're the ones that
[1:55:47] really desire it
[1:55:49] but they're the ones that don't have it
[1:55:50] and he knows it
[1:55:51] we need to be very cautious very careful
[1:55:54] we need to know exactly where we stand
[1:55:56] it's only by grace that we're saved
[1:55:58] through faith in the word of God isn't
[1:56:00] it it's only by his grace I just love
[1:56:02] the special this morning
[1:56:04] it's only by his grace that we're saved
[1:56:06] through faith and not of yourselves it's
[1:56:08] a gift of God
[1:56:10] there's no Apostolic succession because
[1:56:12] we're born in the message of the hour I
[1:56:14] got it I'm safe no we all have to have
[1:56:16] that Upper Room experience we all have
[1:56:18] to die out to ourselves daily every one
[1:56:21] of us brothers and sisters I have I I I
[1:56:24] I don't know it sounds like I'm getting
[1:56:25] pretty heavy with this and I want to
[1:56:27] apologize but I
[1:56:29] I don't want to sound too hard
[1:56:32] but I know it's time
[1:56:34] it's time brothers and sisters
[1:56:36] time is now
[1:56:40] it's not of works
[1:56:44] if it was of works then we'd be able to
[1:56:46] boast wouldn't we
[1:56:48] and you know sadly
[1:56:50] I'll say this sadly I'm sure that every
[1:56:52] one of us can look around the message of
[1:56:54] the hour today and say we can see people
[1:56:56] that have lived their lives and said
[1:56:58] that somehow their Works have actually
[1:56:59] merited them something in the kingdom of
[1:57:01] God and that's not true
[1:57:04] it's entirely false
[1:57:06] our works do nothing for us according to
[1:57:09] the word of God it's only by his grace
[1:57:11] that we're saved brothers and sisters
[1:57:12] and by his grace alone we sing those
[1:57:15] songs and I think we just don't want to
[1:57:16] overlook it we don't want to take it for
[1:57:18] granted it's his grace that gives us the
[1:57:20] ability to hear this word of God we're
[1:57:22] talking about this yesterday it's his
[1:57:23] grace that gives us the ability to be
[1:57:25] healed when we're sick it's his grace
[1:57:27] that gives us the ability to open our
[1:57:29] eyes in the morning and take a breath of
[1:57:31] air it's his grace that gives us the
[1:57:33] ability to have a job to have cognitive
[1:57:35] thinking to have the ability to walk so
[1:57:38] many times we can just take for granted
[1:57:40] his grace oh my I know the word of God
[1:57:43] says don't frustrate his grace we don't
[1:57:45] want to frustrate his grace it's not of
[1:57:47] Works lest any man should boast for we
[1:57:49] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:57:51] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:57:54] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:57:57] them
[1:57:58] my
[1:57:59] it can become really difficult because
[1:58:01] some folks would say well then I don't
[1:58:02] even have a choice how I live my life
[1:58:04] well you do you do have a choice if
[1:58:06] you're called in him before the
[1:58:07] foundation of the world you can take the
[1:58:09] Hard Road or the easy Road I remember
[1:58:11] somebody said I don't know who said it
[1:58:13] but you know when you look at a road a
[1:58:14] road you see the road
[1:58:16] we talked about the highway and and
[1:58:18] there's many lanes on the highway but
[1:58:19] then there's a way of Holiness you know
[1:58:22] there's always a ditch and on a road
[1:58:24] there's always two ditches and you can
[1:58:26] choose to ride in that ditch or you can
[1:58:28] choose to ride in that road or you can
[1:58:30] choose to ride in that way
[1:58:32] one of those things but if we are truly
[1:58:35] Sons and Daughters of God we'll go
[1:58:37] one's going to be a lot more bumpy maybe
[1:58:38] wet and smelly the other one is going to
[1:58:41] be in the midst of a bunch of people and
[1:58:43] confusion and the other one is going to
[1:58:45] be easy
[1:58:47] it will be with his yoke which is easy
[1:58:50] and and his burden will be light but the
[1:58:52] only way we ever get there is by
[1:58:53] complete surrender unto the word of God
[1:58:55] full surrender unto the word of God give
[1:58:58] me a full gut renovation Lord I'm
[1:59:00] willing to take you as the Lord Jesus
[1:59:02] Christ and I want you to just take me
[1:59:04] and flip me inside out you know brothers
[1:59:06] and sisters when they do uh open heart
[1:59:08] surgery we talked about this years ago
[1:59:09] when I was thinking about this while I
[1:59:11] was studying we have to be willing to
[1:59:12] say I'm willing to go for a quadruple
[1:59:15] bypass surgery Lord take my heart right
[1:59:17] out of my chest stop my heart and just
[1:59:20] take it right out of me and create in me
[1:59:22] a Clean Heart Lord Jesus Take take all
[1:59:25] my organs outside of me and just examine
[1:59:27] me set them on the table and just look
[1:59:29] at me from the inside out because I need
[1:59:32] to have that kind of a renovation in my
[1:59:34] life I don't want to have any of the old
[1:59:35] man in there we know that brother
[1:59:37] Branham said the old man's got to die
[1:59:39] every single Speck of the old man's
[1:59:40] gotta go
[1:59:42] you know out of the Amplified Bible
[1:59:43] Romans 12 2 it says do not be conformed
[1:59:46] to this world this age fashioned after
[1:59:50] and adapted to its external superficial
[1:59:55] customs
[1:59:58] I think that's beautiful isn't it
[2:00:01] so many times we can just get clothing
[2:00:03] that's just a little groovy and we can
[2:00:05] maybe get shoes that are just a little
[2:00:07] bit like the world they're fashionable
[2:00:09] and maybe we get close we get whatever
[2:00:12] we get maybe our houses all these
[2:00:14] different things we can get in our lives
[2:00:16] but what are we doing are we fashioning
[2:00:18] and and conforming to the word of God or
[2:00:21] are we actually getting closer to the
[2:00:23] world we need to make sure that our
[2:00:25] trajectory is correct brothers and
[2:00:27] sisters
[2:00:28] do not be conformed to this world this
[2:00:30] age fashioned after and adapted to its
[2:00:33] external superficial Customs but be
[2:00:36] transformed Changed by the entire
[2:00:39] renewal of your mind by its new ideas
[2:00:44] and its new attitude I thought this was
[2:00:48] so beautiful because that's exactly what
[2:00:50] we're talking about with the young
[2:00:51] people we were we were talking about
[2:00:53] that it's our attitude our attitude is
[2:00:55] what changes everything our attitude
[2:00:56] towards our jobs our attitude excuse me
[2:00:59] towards our spouses our attitude towards
[2:01:01] the word of God it will make all the
[2:01:03] difference in our lives
[2:01:05] if we've got a bad attitude it doesn't
[2:01:07] matter we we talked about this when we
[2:01:10] were when we were fellowshipping with
[2:01:11] the young people and I'll just say it
[2:01:12] now it is feel led to we worked for a
[2:01:14] man who was very wealthy very smart and
[2:01:17] what he said is I don't really hire for
[2:01:19] for education I don't really hire for
[2:01:21] credentials per se though they do they
[2:01:24] have to right you can't hire an engineer
[2:01:26] without having the a Pega stamp they
[2:01:29] have to have the certain requirements to
[2:01:31] be able to get there but you can have an
[2:01:32] engineer that's got a real bad attitude
[2:01:34] or you can have an engineer that's got a
[2:01:36] really good attitude and as a business
[2:01:37] owner which one are you going to hire
[2:01:39] you're going to hire the one with a good
[2:01:41] attitude you could have all of the
[2:01:42] credentials but what good is it if you
[2:01:44] can't get along with people
[2:01:47] the attitude counts for everything
[2:01:53] goes on to say I'll just read this here
[2:01:55] but be transformed change by the entire
[2:01:57] renewal of your mind by its new ideas
[2:02:00] and its new attitude so that you may
[2:02:03] prove
[2:02:04] and I love this this is what it says by
[2:02:06] yourselves
[2:02:08] what is the good and acceptable and
[2:02:11] perfect will of God even the thing which
[2:02:14] is good and acceptable and perfect in
[2:02:17] his sight
[2:02:19] for you
[2:02:21] I love the way that this makes it it's
[2:02:23] about you brothers and sisters so that
[2:02:25] you may prove for yourselves
[2:02:28] remember we've talked about Abraham when
[2:02:30] he went up to to sacrifice his son
[2:02:32] waited for the for the thing I apologize
[2:02:34] if this is a repeat I always seem to
[2:02:36] bring this up but to prove for himself
[2:02:38] Abraham had to come to the understanding
[2:02:41] that he knew God as his provider
[2:02:46] God said now I know Abraham that you
[2:02:49] love me
[2:02:50] but he was God he knew that all along
[2:02:52] Abraham is the one that needed to know
[2:02:55] that and I think as as we go forwards
[2:02:58] brothers and sisters we have got to come
[2:03:00] to that place where we're willing to
[2:03:02] take all that we know up to the
[2:03:04] Mountaintop and be willing to sacrifice
[2:03:06] it for the Lord to say I just want to
[2:03:08] give it all to you Lord because I don't
[2:03:10] have anything to bring on my own because
[2:03:11] I know that you're Jehovah Jireh and
[2:03:13] you've brought me this far and if you
[2:03:15] have brought me this far and you haven't
[2:03:17] chosen to destroy me yet
[2:03:19] then you'll be obligated to raise me up
[2:03:21] again after I lay it all down for you
[2:03:23] you'll be obligated to to fix everything
[2:03:25] that I need just like Abraham said I
[2:03:27] know that this is the sun according to
[2:03:29] the promise so if he wants me to
[2:03:30] sacrifice him he's obligated to brace
[2:03:31] him up again because it's through him
[2:03:33] that all of this seed comes forward
[2:03:36] but it's so that you may prove for
[2:03:38] yourselves what is the good acceptable
[2:03:39] perfect will of God who doesn't want to
[2:03:41] know what the good acceptable perfect
[2:03:43] will of God is
[2:03:51] did I cough in your ears I'm sorry
[2:03:55] but I just thought about this you know
[2:03:56] looking at this
[2:04:00] we want to prove it
[2:04:02] don't we
[2:04:04] and be not conformed to this world but
[2:04:06] be transformed by the renewing of your
[2:04:07] mind that you may prove
[2:04:10] what is that good and acceptable and
[2:04:12] perfect will of God
[2:04:14] just wanted to take a quick little look
[2:04:16] this morning at these words and just I
[2:04:18] did take a look at them and you know to
[2:04:22] prove is G 1381 to test literally or
[2:04:24] figuratively by implication to approve
[2:04:27] allow discern examine this is the
[2:04:30] Strong's Concordance of the word proof
[2:04:33] we have to be able to test it literally
[2:04:35] or figuratively the only way we're going
[2:04:37] to do that is by the word of God we need
[2:04:40] to test this experience that we're
[2:04:41] talking about by the word of God if what
[2:04:43] we're hearing if what we believe is
[2:04:45] according to the word of God then we're
[2:04:47] able to say Amen to it but we need to
[2:04:49] allow to discern and examine it and to
[2:04:52] allow the word to discern and examine us
[2:04:56] that's what's going to renew our minds I
[2:04:59] promise brothers and sisters when we go
[2:05:01] on our knees and Die daily when we spend
[2:05:03] time in prayer before the Lord and we
[2:05:06] say Lord what do I need to do to make my
[2:05:10] life better what can I do to be more
[2:05:12] pleasing unto you as my husband what can
[2:05:15] I do
[2:05:17] I promise he will tell you
[2:05:20] but many times it can be very difficult
[2:05:23] answer
[2:05:25] and I'll speak from experienced brothers
[2:05:26] and sisters some of the most difficult
[2:05:29] answers that we could ever imagine in
[2:05:30] our lives are the answers that he'll
[2:05:33] give us
[2:05:34] and we have the choice then to act on
[2:05:37] that
[2:05:38] or to say well that's too hard I don't
[2:05:41] know I can I I don't know how can I do
[2:05:43] that that's that's so difficult Lord how
[2:05:46] many people in the Bible must have
[2:05:48] thought that had those thoughts that is
[2:05:50] difficult how can that be how can it
[2:05:52] ever work the way that you want it to
[2:05:54] work if it's the word of God and it's
[2:05:56] according to the word promise you
[2:05:58] brothers and sisters it will work out
[2:06:00] it will work out exactly but we need to
[2:06:03] allow it to discern and examine
[2:06:06] we need to prove what is good and and
[2:06:09] it's just simple it's G18 and it's good
[2:06:11] and well
[2:06:12] it's good and well it's positive we need
[2:06:14] to prove what is good and acceptable
[2:06:17] g2101 fully agreeable well pleasing it's
[2:06:22] acceptable fully agreeable with the word
[2:06:24] of God and the word of God fully
[2:06:26] agreeable with our lives could you
[2:06:29] imagine being that way I I know most of
[2:06:32] us have probably had times in our lives
[2:06:33] you we can't live in this world without
[2:06:35] actually being contaminated with sin
[2:06:37] it's just impossible isn't it
[2:06:39] and I said it before years ago but you
[2:06:42] know he's been he's given us the no
[2:06:44] stick solution for this world's filth in
[2:06:46] our lives and it's the oil of the Holy
[2:06:47] Ghost many times when you're going to
[2:06:49] cook with something you put a little bit
[2:06:50] of non-stick something in the in the pan
[2:06:52] whether it's a little bit of butter a
[2:06:54] little bit of oil and we've been given
[2:06:55] the oil the Holy Ghost and that's our no
[2:06:57] stick solution the sin will come in our
[2:06:59] lives but it can't stick brothers and
[2:07:01] sisters because he has already paid the
[2:07:03] price for every single sin that's ever
[2:07:04] happened he doesn't look at our lives he
[2:07:07] looks at the sacrifice for our lives and
[2:07:09] the sacrifice for our lives is Jesus
[2:07:11] Christ that one that's already seated
[2:07:13] that we were talking about
[2:07:17] that's got to be fully agreeable and
[2:07:18] well pleasing
[2:07:20] acceptable
[2:07:21] what an amazing place to be and I say
[2:07:24] Lord help me I want to be fully
[2:07:26] agreeable and I want to be not just
[2:07:29] myself fully agreeable with everything
[2:07:31] that you say Lord I want to know that
[2:07:33] you are fully agreeable with me
[2:07:36] and my behavior and my reasoning and my
[2:07:40] thinking and my mind and my heart and my
[2:07:43] soul I want to know that I am well
[2:07:46] pleasing unto you as my husband
[2:07:49] isn't it interesting that we talk about
[2:07:51] it being the bride and the husband and
[2:07:53] how the male men are talking about being
[2:07:56] the bride but yet there's all this other
[2:07:58] business going on in the world the only
[2:08:00] reason that's happening brothers and
[2:08:01] sisters is because we're here
[2:08:03] in our positions
[2:08:05] and as long as we're here in our
[2:08:06] positions unfortunately it's not them
[2:08:09] squeezing us
[2:08:11] it's not that that Spirit of the age
[2:08:14] that's squeezing us I have thought about
[2:08:16] this so much recently it's the other way
[2:08:18] around brothers and sisters because if
[2:08:20] we're saying that it's that Spirit
[2:08:22] that's squeezing us we're saying that
[2:08:23] Spirit stronger than he that is in US
[2:08:27] it's us that's squeezing this age we
[2:08:30] sang that song I think it was on
[2:08:32] Wednesday or last Sunday it's this power
[2:08:35] God's power in his church that's shaking
[2:08:38] this hour brothers and sisters it's not
[2:08:40] this hour that's shaking the church
[2:08:42] don't look for a squeeze to get squeezed
[2:08:44] out of here we're going to squeeze them
[2:08:48] and I'm not saying them about people
[2:08:51] we're talking spiritual we're going to
[2:08:53] squeeze those spirits and as long as we
[2:08:56] preach this as long as we're here as
[2:08:58] long as we have our tokens and we can
[2:09:00] take it out and hold it over our prayers
[2:09:02] brothers and sisters you're shaking the
[2:09:05] powers that are out there in this hour
[2:09:07] you're shaking the spirits in this world
[2:09:09] and you know it's going to be this way
[2:09:11] unfortunately to the very end we are
[2:09:14] either going to shake those Spirits or
[2:09:16] those Spirits are going to come and
[2:09:18] Shake us and the only way we're not
[2:09:20] going to get shaken is to have his mind
[2:09:22] inside of us to make sure that we are
[2:09:25] renewed in our mind and that we can
[2:09:28] prove what is that good and acceptable
[2:09:30] and perfect will of God the next word is
[2:09:33] perfect G 50 46 teleosis complete in
[2:09:38] various applications of Labor growth
[2:09:42] mental and moral character completeness
[2:09:45] of full age man perfect that Strong's
[2:09:49] Concordance I thought it was just you if
[2:09:51] I almost had a shout and fit this
[2:09:53] morning G50 46 teleosis complete in
[2:09:57] various applications we sing that song
[2:10:00] complete complete complete in him
[2:10:05] we are complete in him
[2:10:08] you know what that song
[2:10:11] the fullness of
[2:10:12] the godhead bodily dwelleth in my Lord
[2:10:17] I just want to sing that song now my
[2:10:19] goodness
[2:10:21] doesn't just dwell in our Lord does it
[2:10:24] second Peter 1 Simon Peter a servant and
[2:10:27] an apostle of Jesus Christ maybe turn
[2:10:29] there with me I always get a little
[2:10:31] excited and start reading let's go to
[2:10:32] Second Peter chapter one
[2:10:39] just want to encourage us brothers and
[2:10:40] sisters take inventory
[2:10:42] let's renew our minds let's make sure we
[2:10:44] know exactly where we stand because this
[2:10:46] this world is shaking this world is
[2:10:49] teetering right on the brink of
[2:10:50] something major happening and unless we
[2:10:53] know where we stand unless we know we've
[2:10:55] got that token we will be soon shaken in
[2:10:57] our minds
[2:10:59] second Peter 1 says Simon Peter a
[2:11:02] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[2:11:05] to them that have obtained like Precious
[2:11:08] Faith with us
[2:11:10] through the righteousness of God and our
[2:11:13] Savior Jesus Christ
[2:11:16] I love the way that he introduces
[2:11:18] himself this is the Lord speaking
[2:11:20] through our brother Grace and peace be
[2:11:24] multiplied unto you through the
[2:11:26] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[2:11:30] according as he as his divine power hath
[2:11:34] given unto us all things that pertain
[2:11:36] unto life and godliness
[2:11:38] through the knowledge of him that hath
[2:11:41] called us to glory and virtue
[2:11:45] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[2:11:48] great and precious promises that by
[2:11:51] these ye may be partakers of the divine
[2:11:54] nature having escaped the corruption
[2:11:56] that is in the world through lust
[2:12:01] and looking at this world boy oh boy
[2:12:03] if it's the lust of the flesh or the
[2:12:05] lust of the eyes it doesn't matter is
[2:12:07] lust
[2:12:08] right
[2:12:09] but this is what we want to get to here
[2:12:11] verse 5 and beside this giving all
[2:12:14] diligence brothers and sisters not just
[2:12:16] a little bit not just when we go to
[2:12:18] church but all of our diligence giving
[2:12:21] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[2:12:24] to your virtue knowledge to knowledge
[2:12:26] Temperance to Temperance patience to
[2:12:28] patience godliness to Godliness
[2:12:30] brotherly kindness the brotherly
[2:12:32] kindness charity
[2:12:34] the reason I'm saying all of that I'm
[2:12:36] not going to preach the statue of the
[2:12:37] perfect man we all know that that's what
[2:12:38] it is that brother Branham taught very
[2:12:40] clearly I want to say this for if these
[2:12:43] things be in you and abound they make
[2:12:45] you that she you ye shall neither be
[2:12:48] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[2:12:51] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:53] you'll know exactly where you stand when
[2:12:55] you have this the only way you're going
[2:12:57] to have this though is to get your mind
[2:12:59] renewed brothers and sisters to
[2:13:01] recognize that we need to be living in
[2:13:03] this realm this is the place we need to
[2:13:05] live in not according to this world
[2:13:07] verse 9 says but he that lacketh these
[2:13:10] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[2:13:13] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[2:13:16] from his old sins
[2:13:18] I think this is amazing because this
[2:13:20] isn't talking about a a sinner is it
[2:13:23] because a sinner doesn't believe he has
[2:13:25] sins
[2:13:26] this is someone that was forgiven of his
[2:13:28] sins
[2:13:29] this is someone who Once Upon a Time
[2:13:31] tasted of the Heavenly gift
[2:13:34] but he that lacketh those things these
[2:13:36] blind
[2:13:38] and we know that the word says that
[2:13:39] their their minds will be blinded
[2:13:42] we know that that's that's that's the
[2:13:43] way it is but they can't see far off
[2:13:46] they've forgotten the the prize at the
[2:13:48] end they started to look at the right
[2:13:50] here and right now and the situations
[2:13:52] and the problems in front of their eyes
[2:13:54] and they're not living by that Faith
[2:13:56] sense that he was purged from his old
[2:13:58] sins wherefore the rather Brethren give
[2:14:01] diligence to make your calling an
[2:14:03] election sure
[2:14:04] make sure
[2:14:06] give diligence for if you do these
[2:14:08] things
[2:14:09] you shall never fall
[2:14:12] I just think it's a beautiful scripture
[2:14:13] to think brothers and sisters there is a
[2:14:15] place that we can live where we will
[2:14:17] never fall
[2:14:19] and that's when we're renewing our mind
[2:14:21] where we're actually going on our knees
[2:14:24] and saying Lord renovate me take me and
[2:14:27] break me and bless those broken pieces
[2:14:30] Lord and and I know that you'll bless
[2:14:32] them they'll be beautiful but it's tough
[2:14:34] speech I know it to say Break Me Lord I
[2:14:37] don't want to be broken I don't think
[2:14:39] any one of us want to be broken but if
[2:14:41] it's the Lord's will for us to be broken
[2:14:42] then it's just going to make us better
[2:14:44] it's going to be his will for our lives
[2:14:46] and sometimes it's physical sometimes
[2:14:48] it's mental but we need to do what we
[2:14:50] need to do you know when you're going to
[2:14:52] do a renovation you've got to make some
[2:14:54] mess it gets messy doing a renovation
[2:14:56] brothers and sisters and you know it
[2:14:58] gets dusty it's unpleasant it's on on
[2:15:01] unwelcome but you know that's the way it
[2:15:04] is brother Bradham says when you have a
[2:15:05] new birth it's messy if anybody has ever
[2:15:07] seen a birth happen it's messy you ever
[2:15:10] see a baby cow or horse come into the
[2:15:12] world it's messy it's not pretty but
[2:15:15] that's the way it comes we come by the
[2:15:16] blood that's the only way we can have a
[2:15:18] new birth but he that lacketh these
[2:15:20] things is blind cannot see you far off
[2:15:22] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[2:15:23] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[2:15:25] brother and give diligence to make your
[2:15:27] calling and elections sure for if you do
[2:15:29] these things you shall never fall for so
[2:15:31] an entrance shall be ministered unto you
[2:15:34] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[2:15:38] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[2:15:41] that's what we want to do is just
[2:15:44] abundantly Minister this Everlasting
[2:15:47] Kingdom the only way brothers and
[2:15:50] sisters is by the Holy Ghost in our
[2:15:52] lives
[2:15:53] we could go on to talk about how you get
[2:15:55] the Holy Ghost in our lives and and and
[2:15:57] pray through and I would say this if
[2:15:59] anybody has the desire
[2:16:01] for the Holy Ghost
[2:16:02] he'll give it to you
[2:16:07] all you have to do is say Lord be it
[2:16:08] unto me according to Thy Word
[2:16:10] if I repent and get baptized in the name
[2:16:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:16:15] remission of my sins then I shall
[2:16:18] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we
[2:16:20] know in the Bible it says that you know
[2:16:22] go into all the world and preach the
[2:16:24] gospel to All Creatures baptizing in the
[2:16:26] name of the father and the Son and the
[2:16:28] Holy Ghost it says that in the Bible and
[2:16:30] maybe not exactly like that but it does
[2:16:31] say in the name of the father of the son
[2:16:33] the Holy Ghost
[2:16:34] but that's not the scripture that we
[2:16:35] live by because we know that we've had a
[2:16:37] light shine on that to say what is the
[2:16:39] name of the father and what is the name
[2:16:42] of the son and what is the name of the
[2:16:44] Holy Ghost I could have a checkbook we
[2:16:47] have in this conversation too I could
[2:16:48] have a checkbook and my checkbook says
[2:16:51] Barry Johnson that such and such an
[2:16:53] address and everything is correct on the
[2:16:54] checkbook and I've got money in the bank
[2:16:57] and and I can write the check I can make
[2:16:59] it legible and I can write it out to
[2:17:01] whoever the receiver is for that check
[2:17:03] and everything could be perfect but if I
[2:17:05] wrote
[2:17:06] father
[2:17:07] instead of signing Barry on that check
[2:17:10] the bank would reject it would it not
[2:17:12] yes
[2:17:14] if I wrote sun on that check
[2:17:17] the bank would reject that check they
[2:17:19] would say something's funny going on
[2:17:21] here why what what is that who's a son
[2:17:24] it's supposed to be that signature that
[2:17:26] we have right here
[2:17:27] right on the card that they keep in the
[2:17:29] bank
[2:17:31] or if I said in in the spirit of Barry
[2:17:33] they'd be like man this guy's crazy
[2:17:36] right it would never get cached
[2:17:40] it's no different for us to receive the
[2:17:42] Holy Ghost in our lives
[2:17:43] we've got to be willing to come
[2:17:45] according to the word of God for our day
[2:17:47] that was a word of God for a day but we
[2:17:50] have a word of God for our day and the
[2:17:52] word of God for our day is the name of
[2:17:55] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:17:57] of our sins then we shall receive the
[2:18:00] gift of the Holy Ghost we can't bake a
[2:18:01] cake and substitute one thing for
[2:18:03] another and think that it's going to
[2:18:04] taste good if we took out sugar and put
[2:18:06] in salt
[2:18:08] maybe the cake would bake it would look
[2:18:09] exactly the same but maybe even smelling
[2:18:12] it would taste horrible but one little
[2:18:13] taste of it would just be ridiculous
[2:18:16] you've got to follow the recipe
[2:18:18] and it's so amazing because the devil
[2:18:21] knows that
[2:18:22] and when you look at it it's shocking
[2:18:24] and astounding to think that there's so
[2:18:26] many people out there that are baptized
[2:18:28] in the name of the father Son and Holy
[2:18:29] Ghost who truly believe the word of God
[2:18:31] with all their hearts but what happened
[2:18:33] somewhere along the way through
[2:18:35] tradition maybe just mistaken teaching
[2:18:38] their minds were blinded maybe they were
[2:18:40] never given the ability to see what you
[2:18:42] see and it doesn't give us license to
[2:18:44] come down on people like that to look
[2:18:46] down on them it causes us to sigh and
[2:18:48] cry for the Abominations that are in the
[2:18:51] land because remember that man that
[2:18:53] walked through the city with the ink
[2:18:54] horn who was told to go and set a mark
[2:18:56] on the people I think it's in Ezekiel he
[2:18:58] was told to go and set a mark upon the
[2:19:00] people that that man with the ink horn
[2:19:02] and we know it was an angel setting a
[2:19:04] mark on the people but he wasn't out in
[2:19:06] the Heathen Nations setting marks on the
[2:19:08] people was he he was in the land and you
[2:19:11] know brothers and sisters it's important
[2:19:12] for us to recognize that there is one in
[2:19:14] the land right now setting a mark on the
[2:19:16] people and giving them the token of the
[2:19:19] Holy Ghost it's the ones that are
[2:19:20] sighing and crying for the Abominations
[2:19:22] of the many times we say well if you're
[2:19:23] going to receive the word of God for
[2:19:24] your day that's what the prophet said
[2:19:25] and you can say Amen to the word then
[2:19:27] you have the Holy Ghost and truly indeed
[2:19:29] you do because you will never be able to
[2:19:31] say Amen to the word if you don't have
[2:19:32] the Holy Ghost you can't even call Jesus
[2:19:34] Lord unless you have the Holy Ghost is
[2:19:36] what the word of God says but you know
[2:19:38] brother Branham he brings it out on
[2:19:40] another angle and he says only those who
[2:19:41] are sighing and crying you want to see
[2:19:42] if you've got the holy ghost in your
[2:19:44] life are you sighing and crying for the
[2:19:45] Abominations in the land
[2:19:49] not in the Heathen land not out there we
[2:19:52] can look around and say out there
[2:19:54] but what about right here what about the
[2:19:56] people who actually did come to church
[2:19:57] for a while but then they stopped coming
[2:19:59] for some reason do we know the reason do
[2:20:01] we know where where they are today do we
[2:20:03] know what the problem is where are those
[2:20:05] people are we sighing and crying for
[2:20:06] those people or or is it just easier
[2:20:09] that they're gone
[2:20:10] brothers and sisters we don't ever want
[2:20:12] to have that attitude we want to have
[2:20:13] the attitude where we're sighing and
[2:20:15] crying for the Abominations for our
[2:20:17] brothers and our sisters that maybe they
[2:20:19] just can't come for whatever reason and
[2:20:21] maybe reach out a hand to them
[2:20:23] and see if they'll come
[2:20:27] with the Branham talking about this out
[2:20:30] of the power of transformation I can't
[2:20:32] seem to get out of it I just I think
[2:20:33] it's so amazing we're almost out of time
[2:20:35] here
[2:20:36] apologize
[2:20:39] um are we okay
[2:20:42] brother Branham out of the power and
[2:20:43] transformation he says hi beseech you
[2:20:45] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[2:20:47] that you present your body's a Living
[2:20:48] Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God
[2:20:51] which is your reasonable service
[2:20:54] he says I thought that was so beautiful
[2:20:56] for this group this morning
[2:20:58] what you've done
[2:21:00] did
[2:21:02] now and
[2:21:04] and is a conjunction
[2:21:06] as I understand
[2:21:09] I love how someone with a seventh grade
[2:21:10] education had such a handle on the
[2:21:14] grammar of the English language he says
[2:21:17] and be not conformed to this world
[2:21:19] but be transformed by the renewing of
[2:21:22] your mind that ye may prove
[2:21:24] what is that good and acceptable and
[2:21:27] perfect will of God brother Branham says
[2:21:29] that's what we all want to do is be not
[2:21:32] conformed to this world but be
[2:21:35] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[2:21:38] to do the perfect and acceptable will of
[2:21:42] God
[2:21:44] now that we have been saved as we are
[2:21:47] and that we have been filled with the
[2:21:49] Holy Spirit as we have
[2:21:52] now we want to have the mind that was in
[2:21:55] Christ to be in US
[2:21:58] that we might be transformed from the
[2:22:00] Natural Things of life and be brought in
[2:22:03] to do the perfect will of God
[2:22:06] by transformation of God's spirit by his
[2:22:09] word
[2:22:11] I want to say this this morning brothers
[2:22:12] and sisters when we go to church we hear
[2:22:15] the word of God and it washes us when we
[2:22:17] listen to the message of the hour we
[2:22:19] listen and it washes us it changes us
[2:22:21] and when we read the word of God it
[2:22:23] washes us and it changes us it when we
[2:22:25] go on our knees we're renewing our minds
[2:22:28] all of that is renewing our minds but
[2:22:30] there's a conversation that takes place
[2:22:32] between us and our husband and even
[2:22:35] though he talks according to his word
[2:22:37] he'll talk through a preacher he'll talk
[2:22:39] through the tape to us he'll speak to
[2:22:41] our brother and our sister we'll hear
[2:22:43] him dealing with us and you know he'll
[2:22:46] do it in such a way that only you will
[2:22:48] know
[2:22:49] and you can try to explain it to other
[2:22:51] people and other people will say yeah
[2:22:52] okay maybe I don't know maybe I don't
[2:22:55] know sometimes it can sound really crazy
[2:22:57] when you try to explain how God has been
[2:22:59] dealing with you sometimes it's just in
[2:23:01] Little Things brother Branham talked
[2:23:03] about how nature spoke to him right
[2:23:05] God will deal with us however we need to
[2:23:07] be dealt with the way that he created he
[2:23:09] will speak to us and the key to this
[2:23:11] brothers and sisters I think that was
[2:23:13] just burning within my heart that I had
[2:23:14] to just bring today is that when he
[2:23:16] speaks do we listen do we hear his voice
[2:23:20] for ourselves
[2:23:22] and when we hear his voice for ourselves
[2:23:24] are we willing to act on it I say Lord
[2:23:27] help me help me act on your voice when I
[2:23:31] hear it because you know brothers and
[2:23:32] sisters I'm not going to try and pretend
[2:23:33] to be Almighty and and holy and
[2:23:36] religious because none of us want to be
[2:23:38] that but I'm no better than anyone I'm
[2:23:39] I'm probably the cheapest chiefest of
[2:23:41] Sinners and you know I I look at my life
[2:23:44] and I think about the times I know the
[2:23:45] Lord has spoke to me as a Believer and
[2:23:48] said do this and I haven't done that
[2:23:51] we don't want to do that we want to
[2:23:53] follow the word of God every single time
[2:23:55] he talks to us and if we're willing to
[2:23:57] do that then we know where we stand then
[2:23:59] we know that our mind has been renewed
[2:24:01] and our we can't just have a
[2:24:03] one-and-done renewing of our minds I'm
[2:24:05] sorry it doesn't work that way we could
[2:24:07] say that we've had a one and done
[2:24:08] renewing with our marriage I got married
[2:24:10] 16 years ago 17 years ago 20 years ago
[2:24:14] maybe 50 years ago and I said to my wife
[2:24:16] that I love her then I told her I love
[2:24:18] her she knows that I love her but if I
[2:24:21] don't tell her that I love her on a
[2:24:22] daily basis on a weekly basis on a
[2:24:25] monthly day on a regular basis does she
[2:24:27] know that I love her she's going to
[2:24:28] think that I don't love her anymore
[2:24:30] we've been created that way for a
[2:24:32] purpose he wants to hear us say I love
[2:24:35] you honey he wants to hear our voice
[2:24:38] speak to him
[2:24:40] I just want to encourage us when the
[2:24:42] devil says Nope you've done that you
[2:24:43] can't talk to him he won't listen to you
[2:24:44] tell the Devil he's a liar
[2:24:46] tell the devil you can't even see me the
[2:24:49] way that he created me you can't even
[2:24:51] see me the way he created me Satan I
[2:24:54] can't see me the way he created me but
[2:24:56] he can see me the way he created me and
[2:24:58] he's listening to hear my voice come to
[2:25:01] him the way that he created me and the
[2:25:03] only way that he created you is exactly
[2:25:05] according to his word you can say
[2:25:07] brother Barry I don't understand
[2:25:08] anything about this and you don't have
[2:25:10] to understand anything about this the
[2:25:11] only thing you got to do is believe it
[2:25:13] the only thing you got to do is say Lord
[2:25:14] be it unto me just transform me
[2:25:16] according to your word transform my mind
[2:25:19] renew my mind so that I can prove what
[2:25:23] is that good and acceptable and perfect
[2:25:24] will of God so that you can prove it
[2:25:26] through me Lord and you know what
[2:25:28] something will happen if we can have
[2:25:30] that genuine attitude towards him if we
[2:25:32] have the right attitude the right mental
[2:25:34] attitude to any promise of God
[2:25:38] we'll bring it to pass is what the
[2:25:39] prophet of God says and and let's just
[2:25:41] back up for a second and say that's what
[2:25:43] God Said through the prophet
[2:25:45] God said that through the prophet so
[2:25:47] that we could take that and put it in
[2:25:48] our pocket and say wow man I want to get
[2:25:50] the right mental attitude how do I get
[2:25:52] the right mental attitude you say just
[2:25:54] renew your mind just renew your mind
[2:25:56] according to his word if you're willing
[2:25:58] to renew his mind your mind according to
[2:26:00] his word you're going to have the right
[2:26:01] mental attitude every single time
[2:26:02] initially you might not initially you
[2:26:04] might actually have a problem but the
[2:26:06] Holy Ghost he's going to come around and
[2:26:07] say brother you did that wrong you need
[2:26:09] to go and make that right and if you're
[2:26:11] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost
[2:26:13] you're going to turn around and you're
[2:26:14] going to go and make that right
[2:26:17] but you're Renewing Your Mind brothers
[2:26:18] and sisters that's the life of Jesus
[2:26:20] Christ Living out through us
[2:26:22] I think it's beautiful the way brother
[2:26:24] Branham says it
[2:26:27] I I so much and it's already 12. maybe
[2:26:31] we'll just pick up next week I don't
[2:26:32] want to keep us here we have a service
[2:26:34] tonight brothers and sisters you know
[2:26:36] this world it teaches us to be strong
[2:26:40] but we don't want to be strong
[2:26:42] we want to be weak maybe stand with me
[2:26:45] as we close this morning
[2:26:48] brothers and sisters we can't be strong
[2:26:50] on our own we have no strength
[2:26:53] we know that Paul he had strength in his
[2:26:56] own body in his own mind recognizing
[2:26:59] that he was a part of the message for
[2:27:02] his day he was the messenger for the age
[2:27:05] and Satan was allowed to bring him a
[2:27:08] little bit of buffeting God will allow
[2:27:10] that in our lives just to Humble us a
[2:27:13] bit
[2:27:13] just to get us to that place where we
[2:27:16] recognize oh yeah I forgot it it truly
[2:27:19] is you Lord every single bit of it is
[2:27:22] you and there's nothing that I've got
[2:27:24] second Corinthians chapter 12 says for
[2:27:26] this thing I besought the Lord Thrice
[2:27:28] that it might depart from me Paul
[2:27:30] speaking this Thorn that was given to
[2:27:32] him in the flesh Satan that Messenger to
[2:27:34] come and just rattle his cage a bit and
[2:27:37] he said unto me my grace
[2:27:39] Not Your Grace not someone else's Grace
[2:27:42] not your righteousness but my grace
[2:27:46] is sufficient for thee
[2:27:49] for my strength is made perfect in
[2:27:51] weakness
[2:27:53] Paul the messenger for the age the first
[2:27:55] church age messenger the pattern that
[2:27:57] was set for every other age this is what
[2:28:01] he said most gladly therefore will I
[2:28:04] rather glory in my infirmities
[2:28:07] power of Christ might rest upon me my
[2:28:10] goal my objective my desire brothers and
[2:28:13] sisters is that the power of Christ will
[2:28:15] rest upon you today and not just today
[2:28:18] but tomorrow when the Devil Comes Monday
[2:28:19] morning and and Tuesday morning and
[2:28:22] Wednesday morning and Thursday and
[2:28:24] Friday and every day that ends in why
[2:28:27] that the power of Christ will rest upon
[2:28:29] you so when Satan comes around and tries
[2:28:31] to buff at you you can say yep you're
[2:28:33] only doing it because God's allowed it
[2:28:35] and it's for his his righteousness to be
[2:28:37] expressed in my life you're only going
[2:28:38] to squeeze out what's inside of me and
[2:28:40] the only thing that's inside of me is
[2:28:41] the word of God so go for it
[2:28:44] I'm going to stop I I just trust that
[2:28:47] the power of Christ will rest upon each
[2:28:48] one of us as we go forwards brothers and
[2:28:50] sisters get the token know where you
[2:28:52] stand just renew your mind according to
[2:28:54] his word
[2:28:56] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[2:28:58] love you today and we thank you for your
[2:29:00] goodness to us we thank you for your
[2:29:02] word Lord because we know that it is
[2:29:04] sure we know that this whole entire
[2:29:07] world now is on shifting Sands Lord oh
[2:29:11] Father there's no sure footing in this
[2:29:13] world except for your word father we
[2:29:15] know that there's man already creating
[2:29:17] dens in the rocks oh Father they're
[2:29:20] creating bunkers and storing up food
[2:29:22] provisions and ammunition and all the
[2:29:25] things that they think they need they're
[2:29:26] saving seeds Lord so they can
[2:29:28] potentially pull them out of after a
[2:29:30] holocaust Lord but we know that all of
[2:29:33] it is coming to an end all of it is for

[2:29:53] when we leave this building this morning
[2:29:55] that we would know exactly where we

[2:30:00] Lord Jesus about your grace in our lives
[2:30:03] whether that when the devil would come
[2:30:05] around and try and tempt us that we
[2:30:07] could just know exactly where we stand
[2:30:09] that we could not look to ourselves and
[2:30:11] and not look to anything else except for
[2:30:14] you Lord because you are that perfect
[2:30:16] sacrifice you are the sacrifice just

[2:31:15] bless him abundantly father that he
[2:31:17] would be able to just minister to people
[2:31:19] the way that you have created him
[2:31:21] oh Father we just love you and we thank
[2:31:23] you we just ask now that you would be
[2:31:25] glorified in a few songs Lord Jesus that

[2:31:29] further with some song Lord and as we go
