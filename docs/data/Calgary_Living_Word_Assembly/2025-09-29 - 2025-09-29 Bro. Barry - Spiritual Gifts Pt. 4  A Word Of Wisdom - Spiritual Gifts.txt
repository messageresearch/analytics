Changing [singing] me, [music] changing you. We have come [singing] [music] with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly [music] thankful that we have this word, &gt;&gt; the word of God that he's given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Handed down through the ages. &gt;&gt; Yes. As I was walking up to the pulpit tonight, I just thought, my, we are the recipients of that word. &gt;&gt; To think that we are those people, not because we chose it, [music] because he did. &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, one more time we come to you, Father, with all of our needs, with all of our burdens, Lord, with all of our cares and all of our troubles. Father, there's nowhere else in this world that we would rather go. And Father, we are so thankful that you have your ears open [music] every single time we pray, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to bring the needs before your throne, Lord. We once again thank you for releasing, Lord, the hostages, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; For restoring the brothers back to their families, Lord, &gt;&gt; for restoring the families back to the congregation, Lord [music] Jesus. &gt;&gt; You are a mighty God. Oh, hallelujah. There's no one like you, Father. Lord Jesus, tonight we thank you for watching over the Kikuji [music] family, Lord, at the passing of their mama, Sister Charmaine. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just want to remember brother Dodie and his family and brother Mila and his family and brother Martin, Lord, and Sister Adijah, [music] Father. We just hold them before your throne tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, for working all things to our good, Father. All things work together for the good to those who are called according to your purpose, Lord. And I know that's the very words of Brother Dodie. And we thank you for that, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to remember Sister Mary Carpenter. She needs a touch from you, Lord. And Father, every single need that was made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand, Father, we pray that you would just sovereignly meet the needs once again. Father, we're thankful that we can gather together in your name here. One more time, we just invite you to have the preeminence, Lord, in all that's said and done. &gt;&gt; Just ask all [music] these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians. Once again, if you have your Bibles, I would like to continue on with our discussion on gifts in uh 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Certainly like to welcome brother Harvey back. He's been a world traveler. He's gone to where the penguins live. Certainly welcome our friends, Brother Larry and Sister Karen as well. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; Always wonderful to see you and each one tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing when you come into a a fairly full building on a Wednesday night. That means something. &gt;&gt; So God bless you tonight. 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse one says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant." Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. And there are differences of administrations but the same Lord. &gt;&gt; And there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. For to one is given the spirit sorry one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one in the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will. &gt;&gt; Amen. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many are one body, so also is Christ. &gt;&gt; For by one spirit, we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member but many. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that we can be counted a part of your body. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask that you would impart the words that are spoken tonight, Father, to our souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That when we leave here tonight, we would say that truly our hearts burn within us, Father, as we walk with you along the way. &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful, wonderful communion service on Sunday. Boy, it was just a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just want to uh remind everyone we have the youth service coming up on Friday here at 7:30. We're going to just have a regular service and uh see what the Lord will do. So, if you want to come out, you're certainly welcome to do so. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be at 7:30 and it's going to be uh completely run by the youth. It'll be youth musicians. It'll be uh minister by the youth and then some more youth songs after. And uh yeah, we're certainly excited about that. We'll have a little bit of fellowship after service, I'm sure. So, that will be on Friday night. And we have uh brother Cadre Digs here on the 22nd and 23rd of November. We have the 2025 graduation celebration will be taking place in uh June, I believe it is. Yeah, we have a date June 27th, 2026. It'll be at 6 PM at the Glenmore Inn. And so we would like to just uh we'll send something out about it, but I just wanted to mention it. Um there will be a few people who have graduated already that didn't really celebrate with the body and we want to make sure that we offer that opportunity. So if you would like to uh celebrate your graduation whether it's a post-secary or um a grade 12 grad, we certainly want to celebrate that with you. So we will uh send out more details as they come and uh we'll certainly keep you posted. Are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Has the devil been going about as a roaring lion since our testimony service on Sunday? &gt;&gt; I know he's been coming after me. And I think it's a good thing because that means I'm on the right side. &gt;&gt; I'm not friends with the devil. &gt;&gt; But uh it hasn't been easy. It's amazing to see, you know, uh we can find ourselves in circumstances and situations and wonder why is it like this? And then remember, you know, we had just had a wonderful time with the Lord. The devil's not going to let us stay there. Not for a second, &gt;&gt; but he can't help it. He's not going to be able to stop us. Getting into our scripture tonight out of 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Um, we've talked about it. Uh, this is part four of our discussion on the gifts. And I wanted to start to talk about the actual uh named gifts that are in here from verse 8. Um but verse 7 says, "The manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all." So it's not exclusive to any man. And we know that the word also says that the scripture, the word of God, is of no private interpretation. So, as soon as we have someone saying that they've got an edge on some sort of a revelation in the word of God, does it line up with the word of God first of all? And if it does, then that's good. And then, does it line up with the seventh angel messengers word? And if it doesn't, then there's a problem. &gt;&gt; But it's given to every man to profit with all. And I love that because it's not to to debit us, is it? &gt;&gt; It's to profit us. &gt;&gt; They're to help us. the spiritual gifts are to be a help to us individually and to help us as a body. I think it's a beautiful thing. So out of verse 8 in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, he begins to talk to the Corinthian church, Paul the scribe uh for the Holy Ghost, speaking to the Corinthian church, bringing correction to set the church in order, the first pattern for the church that every other church should follow. For unto one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit. And I just love how he emphasizes this all the way along. It doesn't go off talking about so many gifts that we just forget where the gifts come from and who the inspiration is behind the gifts. Every single time he reminds us it's by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's by the same spirit. It's by the same spirit. But tonight, I want to talk specifically out of verse eight about a word of wisdom. &gt;&gt; And uh I'll just tell you it from a preaching perspective, it's a bit like throwing stones on a pond. You skip the stone and you're only going to get so many skips and then the rock's going to sink. And it's kind of the way I feel like I I I could probably preach on this really if if the Lord inspired us to go that way. And I don't think there'd be anything wrong with it, but this could probably be a year-long study on gifts alone, just talking about these uh when you start to really dig into it. Like just simply uh the word of wisdom. If you talk about wisdom, it's brought up 222 times in the King James version. And uh it's it's pretty neat when you start to really dig into it. But I just wanted to sort of do a highlevel fly over with the gifts is kind of the way I felt led to go with it and not really drill down too far. But, you know, we'll just follow the spirit, the leadership of the Lord, and see what happens with it. So, if we do get hung up somewhere, I hope it's okay. I I hope it's not a a big deal. We'll just trust the Lord, and I'm sure it will be good. But, you know, the very first time wisdom is spoken in the Bible is in Exodus chapter 28. It's the first mention of wisdom in uh in Exodus chapter 28:3. and and the Lord is instructing Moses in how all of the temple worship should take place. And if you ever are wondering if the Lord worries about details or is concerned about the way things are done, just go back and read this Old Testament instruction on on how he instructed Moses that that he wanted the temple worship to happen. Right down to the beginning part of it here in in verse three of Exodus 28. and thou shalt speak unto all that are wisehearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. I just love that, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The wise-hearted people are not just people that came from from birth. They w their parents didn't just eat really good organic pomegranates and and and milk and honey. They didn't just eat all of the best things and and have really really strong genetics so that they were wise. Although I bet people were probably a little bit smarter or wiser back in the day because they didn't have to contend with all the processed foods that we contend with. But we have people that were living their lives and God spoke to them and said that there's some wisehearted people whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. &gt;&gt; I think that's incredible because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, isn't he? Amen. &gt;&gt; If we have wisdom in our lives, it's only because he's poured himself into us. &gt;&gt; He has given us the spirit of wisdom. I love that thought about the spirit of wisdom. When we can solve problems that ordinarily we couldn't solve. We heard it on the testimony service. Uh it's just incredible to see what can happen when there's complex problems and we just have no idea how to solve them. You ever encounter that in your life? Amen. &gt;&gt; If we just go to prayer &gt;&gt; and give God the opportunity, it's no accident that we have a complex problem in our life. &gt;&gt; You know, I've been fellowshipping with a brother for a little while here and we got into a discussion about this. Is there such a thing as a coincidence &gt;&gt; in this world? &gt;&gt; Are there accidents? &gt;&gt; The world would say there is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe even a denominational world would say there's coincidence. Oh, yeah. There's there's coincidences, but as a believer of the Lord, we of this message, full message believing Christian people filled with the Holy Ghost, we don't believe in coincidences. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as accidents. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We didn't just happen into the the the chapel on the corner, the mission on the corner, Brother Brandham says, one day and just suddenly find God because we were seeking God. Man doesn't seek God. God seeks man. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't seek God when he actually stepped out of his first estate. What did he do? He created a religion and went and hid behind it. &gt;&gt; But I love this. I love this scripture here. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt speak unto all that are wisehearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. God cares about the details. &gt;&gt; He really cares about the details. You know, tonight I just want to really kind of drill down a little bit in uh First Kings chapter 3, if you don't mind. Uh talk about the wisest man that ever was. First Kings chapter 3. We know this to be Solomon. Right from the very start though, Solomon kind of stepped out and uh I think it's interesting because he showed that he was a man right from the very first here even though he is chosen first kings 3:1 says, "And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem roundabout." Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord until those days. And Solomon loved the Lord. Isn't that beautiful? Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David, his father only. He sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. If you look at it from a legalistic perspective, there's two things now. He's taken a wife from Egypt and he's burning sacrifices in the high places. Verse four says, "And the king went to Gibian to sacrifice there, and for that was the great high place. A thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar." He really wanted to worship, didn't he? In Gibian, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, "Ask what I shall give thee." Did you ever think about this? Do you ever think about what it'd be like to actually go into a dream and and have a meeting with God? Just to think about that moment. Hey, and Solomon said, "Thou hast showed unto thy servant David, my father, great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee. and thou hast kept him for this great kindness. And thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day. And now, oh Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father, and I am but a little child. I know not how to go out or come in. And thy servant is in the midst of thy people, which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered, nor counted for multitude. Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge this thy so great a people? And this this is the best part, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the speech pleased the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Solomon had asked this thing. And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment. Behold, I have done according to thy words. Lo, I have given thee a wise and understanding heart, &gt;&gt; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. &gt;&gt; What a declaration. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have also given thee, this is the God we serve here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is our God. &gt;&gt; The one that we worshiped tonight. The one that's here with us right now. This is the one And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both riches and honor. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. &gt;&gt; And if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. My, we know that the word says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." Right? &gt;&gt; Children, honor your parents. Why? So that your days might be long upon the earth. &gt;&gt; How better could you honor a father than to just do what he told you to do. &gt;&gt; To do it as he taught you how to do it. &gt;&gt; Just an amazing thing. You know, we we we're looking at this here and and I just want to throw this in because I think it's it's really really good. It's just good for us to to remember. Let's turn back over to 1 Corinthians chapter 2. 1 Corinthians chapter 2. That's second Corinthians. First Corinthians. That's the one talking about words of wisdom. I think it's amazing to see that Solomon just had that desire in his heart and and God gave him the desire to actually be able to fulfill the role that he was in. But then he gave him so much more just because he was willing to surrender his will to the Lord's will. But, you know, in in 1 Corinthians chapter 2, I I just felt led to bring this this verse, you know, that we're we're not following in in in terms of what we're doing. We're looking for the leadership of the spirit in every aspect of our church. And I trust that we're looking for the spirit, the leadership of the spirit, the wisdom of the spirit in every aspect, not just of our church, but of our lives. and not just of our lives, but of our homes and our families and our relationships and and and our jobs and and our education and every single thing that we do. If we are putting the Lord first, he is the same as he was with Solomon to his children today, he's never going to leave us or forsake us. He will always be accountable to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so wonderful. We don't have to look and think, you know, I want to be the wisest because there will be nobody as wise as Solomon is what the word of God said. That's just not going to happen. So, it would be foolish to ask a question like that to be wiser than Solomon or as wise as Solomon. But it would not be foolish to say, "Lord, help me to understand how to have discernment and discretion and wisdom to be able to live in the position that I'm in, that I find myself in." Especially when we find ourselves behind or underneath or in the middle of a really comp complex problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In uh in uh 1 Corinthians chapter 2. And I brethren when I came to you came not with excellency of speech &gt;&gt; or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified. and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. Remember this is the one that was actually laying waste to the church. He was persecuting and murdering people. And he had to come back and actually preach now to the church. &gt;&gt; He he was in fear and in much trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom. Not teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. &gt;&gt; No. But it wasn't of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and in power. Why is that? It's that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, &gt;&gt; but in the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now, as we go forwards tonight, I just want to make sure that we we draw a clear line. There is a wisdom of men &gt;&gt; and there is a wisdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we're following the wisdom of men, we will not see the life, the demonstration of the spirit that we just read about here. And that's where brother Bradom talks about a hybrid religion. If you try and create a hybrid religion, you can and you will maybe in your home, maybe in your church, and it'll look good, it'll sound good, it'll it'll be good for a few years, but then after a while, it will start to show itself. How will it show itself? It cannot reproduce. That's the bottom line with a hybrid religion. &gt;&gt; It's a dead religion. But you could have a whole bunch of people that get together all around man's wisdom and there's going to be I heard brother Bradam say it today. The greatest lie ever told is 99% truth. &gt;&gt; 1% or one word off. Right? &gt;&gt; We don't want a hybrid religion. We want the spirit of wisdom from God. We want the Holy Ghost wisdom in our lives. We want that leadership to be what's going on. And how will we ever know if it's correct? Does it line up with the word of God? &gt;&gt; It will always line up with the word of God. And if it doesn't line up with the word of God, we don't have to make a big fit and a scene and maybe try and go and argue with people. All we need to do is like brother Brandham said, just leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Just leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Set it down. Say, I can't I I don't understand that right now in my life. I just maybe don't see it that way. That's all. But if a brother sees it that way, that's okay. He's still your brother, &gt;&gt; you know, there's 10 virgins, right? Five of them were wise and had oil and five of them were unwise and never had oil. &gt;&gt; But they all slumbered and slept together. &gt;&gt; They all worshiped together. It's not up to us to discern that or or even try and sort it out. It's not our our our issue. The only thing we need to do is make sure that we're following the wisdom of the word, the wisdom of the Lord, that is the inspiration of the spirit. And that's going to cause us to have oil. And as long as we have oil, when that door closes, we're going to be fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Paul, he's doing this. He's bringing this demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. How be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect. Now remember perfect isn't isn't the religious perfect where we have everything perfect in our lives in our homes. We're sinless individuals even though we are the sinless spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. Those ones fit this description of perfect because it's mature. &gt;&gt; They're mature in the word. They're not interested in being fed milk all the time. I need to be pat on the back. If I'm going to be a deacon in the church, then I'll come to church. If I can minister in the church, then I'll come to church. If if I can do this, then that or the other. No. Strong Christians, they just come to church because that's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be pat on the back. &gt;&gt; Amen. How be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor the princes of this world that come to not, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom. I love that. The hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. Now, this hidden wisdom, we said it already, the word of God is of no private interpretation. So, when somebody says, "I've got a revelation," it better line up with the word of God &gt;&gt; or we just leave it alone. like we said a little bit earlier, but there is no hidden wisdom any longer. All of that hidden wisdom has been revealed under the ministry of the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; That's why I think this scripture here, this chapter, I'm going to read the whole chapter. I hope it's okay tonight because it speaks to the age in which we live. So clear. I think it's just amazing. Verse 8 says, "Which none of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." &gt;&gt; Because that sealed the devil's doom, &gt;&gt; didn't it? It sealed his fate. And it sealed ours, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it because it sealed ours, too. Our fate is sealed in God because of that. Verse 9 says, "But as it is written, I hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of a man the things that God hath prepared for them that love him, but God had hath revealed them unto us by his spirit." You know, it just hit me as I was reading this, you know, brothers and sisters, that we talk about this many times. I do many times. I've always thought about it as that next dimension. Brother Brandham talked about going beyond the curtain of time, but it just struck me just now. But what about now? What about now? &gt;&gt; Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of a man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him right now. I think we can put it out there and make it somewhere out in the future. But what about right now? But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. Remember, we're talking about the difference now between the spirit of wisdom of God and the spirit of wisdom of man. The tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. Those two spirits, they're so close &gt;&gt; that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible. So, I think it bears the discussion to talk about it here. But verse 11 says, "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we mustn't think at all that we could actually just resist getting the Holy Ghost and be able to understand these hidden mysteries. To not get the Holy Ghost means that we're going to be striving with the spirit of man. And understanding according to the spirit of man, and there will still be mysteries. There will be a mysterious element to this word of God. Verse 12 says, "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God." Now, remember, every single one of the gifts are to profit every man with all. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; these are freely given to man. So, it's beautiful to think that we could have the Holy Ghost in our life and understand the mysteries, but there's also things that we need to help us on our journeys &gt;&gt; to help other people through us in our lives. Remember, brother Bradom said, he said that eternal life is not living for yourself. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; So, when we've got a gift in our life, what are we doing with it? Are we profiting or is everyone profiting? which things we also speak. Verse 13, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth. We don't teach doctrines. We don't teach the the commandments of men as doctrines. We don't do that. If it's not in the word of God, if the prophet didn't tell us all about it and it's not in the word of God, then we just leave it alone. We don't try and go so far out on a limb and say, you know, that we've done it this way and it's always been that way and we've heard it and we've said it and we keep going with it. No, that's where we get out onto thin ice. &gt;&gt; We're on thin ice. You're going to fall through. It's dangerous. So, we don't want to do that. But verse 13 says, "Which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth." &gt;&gt; Comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God. for they are foolishness unto him. Fundamentalist, right? Holy rollers, cult members, all of the adjectives, all of the things, the descriptions that you could come up with for the people that actually follow the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; But they're foolishness unto men that follow the the spirit of men. For they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things. Yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? Love this last sentence. &gt;&gt; Hey, but we have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; We have that mind. Yes. &gt;&gt; So this word of wisdom tonight, brothers and sisters, that we're talking about, this is for us. &gt;&gt; It's not for the world. It's not for the people that want to call the the move of the spirit of men. It it's it's not for those people. &gt;&gt; Amen. going back to our our discussion in in First Kings, how Solomon he loved the Lord and how he he he lived his life and and he had the discussion with the Lord and he had such a wonderful experience with the Lord, didn't he? &gt;&gt; I think it's so amazing to see this and and to think that God would actually honor his desire and give him so much wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I think it's it's amazing. you know the story. Um, if you go a little further in in Kings, I didn't actually write it down. I was just reading it and and I didn't want to read too much scripture and in a row, but I I was just studying the story today and and how wonderful it is. The very next story, the very first demonstration of Solomon's wisdom is the two women, the two harlots, I believe it was, sleeping in the same house. &gt;&gt; They both had babies. One of the babies died during the night. And when that baby died during the night, the one woman woke up and realized that she had actually suffocated the baby by sleeping with it in the bed. And what happened? She took her baby, the dead one, and gave it to the one with the live baby. And they she swapped the babies. And in the morning, the other woman woke up and realized this dead baby, what's with a dead baby here? This ain't my baby, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And she recognized that's my baby. That's my baby's cry. That's my baby. That's my baby. She stole my baby. They find themselves going before this king now that's had this discussion with God. &gt;&gt; And what did he say? He said, "Bring me a sword. Bring me a sword. Bring out a sword." And then he says, "Now take that sword and divide the live baby in half. Give one half to her and one half to her." What a what a wild thing to say. Amazing to think about the amount of wisdom that's there. But what happened was immediately the true mother came out and said, "No, don't c don't kill the baby. Just give the baby to the other woman." &gt;&gt; The the love of a mother was able to come out and actually demonstrate. And immediately that wisdom kicked in. He knew it. He was able to say, "There it is. That's the mother." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right there. Give that baby to her. &gt;&gt; Just amazing to see the wisdom of God, though, isn't it? &gt;&gt; We have that wisdom in our midst. &gt;&gt; We have that wisdom in our church. And we have that wisdom in our lives. &gt;&gt; I personally believe because of the word it says that every one of these gifts is given to profit every man with all. So there is a measure of each one of those gifts in every one of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know some people have come out with worksheets where you can actually start to test yourself and ask questions and see how many of these different boxes you can check and you can actually lean one way or the other and before you know it, you have the gift of wisdom stronger in your life than you do of discernment or or interpretation of tongues. And like I said before, we're not going to do that. I'm going to say that every single one of us, we have these in our lives. Some might have a stronger amount of others. It's whatever the spirit wants to do, isn't it? Right. &gt;&gt; So, as we yield oursel to the Lord as we go, I'm sure that he will reveal it to us. You know, um, talking about the spirit of wisdom, there is such an amazing book in the Bible about the spirit of wisdom and it's the instruction from the wisest man ever live and ever will live for his son. And that's the book of Proverbs. If you want to just turn over to the book of Proverbs tonight just to read a little bit there. I think it's just amazing because this is what I I read to my boys. I I want them to study this and I've even got a little bit of a challenge with them for them for a specific chapter in here just to learn it, you know, and uh but it's just wonderful to see the wisdom of this man and what would he say to his children. That's why I'm so fascinated with it. What would he say to his son? And and that's what I'm trying to say with to my son. All of them. I just would love nothing more than for them to really be able to get this. But you know, it's it's mentioned 53 times the word wisdom in the book of Proverbs. It is a very prevalent discussion in this book. But verse one of chapter 1 says, "The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, to know wisdom and instruction." to know wisdom and instruction. to perceive the words of understanding, to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity, to give subtlety to the simple, to the young man, knowledge and discretion. And you know, I I believe it with all my heart that we can take this and look at this through the lens of the spirit as we read it. There's the natural element to this and and there very much is. We know brother Brandham said it. There's a compound revelation to every single scripture. Meaning and revelation to every single scripture. But as we read this, I think it's beautiful when we talk about understanding the things of the Lord, understanding the the word of wisdom that we've been given. Because we could just summarize it right here and go home and say that we've been given a word of wisdom right here. This is the ultimate word of wisdom, the word of God. But there's so much more to it. It has to be read. It has to be opened up. You We have to peel back the scroll and and get into it, don't we? Verse five, it says that a wise man will hear and will increase learning. And a man of understanding shall attain to wise counselss. A wise man isn't going to say when someone who is elder brings something to them and says, you know, if you just tried doing it this way, they're not just going to scoff and say, ah, I don't need to hear, you know, whatever. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense, does it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Someone who's filled with the spirit of God is going to be what's considered a wise man here. A wise man will hear and will increase learning, will desire more revelation by the word, will want to feed on the message, will want to read the word of God, will want to participate in a body, will want to go to church, will will want to serve God. Verse six says, to understand a proverb and the interpretation, the words to the wise and their dark sayings. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. But fools despise wisdom and instruction. &gt;&gt; You know, verse 8, N, and 10, I think, is just so good because every one of us as a son or a daughter of God, I I believe that we could say it that way. My daughter, hear the instruction of thy father. My son, hear the instruction of thy father. And forsake not the law of thy mother. For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck. boy and my my son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. And and you know, we can go down a long ways with that, and I don't want to tonight for the sake of time, but I I just think it's a wonderful thing to think that a wise man will hear and increase knowledge. Won't just say, "No, I don't need to learn anymore. I I've heard it all. What else are you going to tell me?" You know, if we turn over to Proverbs chapter 2, verse two, proverbs 2 verse two. Ah, we'll just read verse one. We might as well. He's addressing it to his son again. He says verse one of chapter 2 says, "My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee, so that thou will incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding. Ya, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding, if thou seekest her as silver, and searcheth for her as hid treasures, if we make this desire for wisdom of the Lord, wisdom by the spirit, if we make that desire, just like we make the desire for all of the other things in our life, sorry, If thou seekest her as silver, and searches for her as hid treasures, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Lord giveth wisdom. Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous. Isn't that beautiful? He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. And and that word buckler is is a shield, a protector. He is a buckler for those that walk uprightly. Talking about the wisdom, the word of wisdom, having the word of wisdom in our lives is such a beautiful thing. Excuse me. But if if thou wilt incline thine ear, if thou wilt receive my words, hide my commandments with thee. You know, it's uh it's a scripture, isn't it? Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee. And we know what is sinning. Sinning is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe this word of God. It's not something that's that's out there. So, we incline our ears. I think it's just a wonderful thing. What a gift it is to have even the desire to do it. Isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? Out of the message love, brother Brandham talking about gifts. Talking about the the different gifts in the body. He says, I think love is the greatest force there is in the world. &gt;&gt; There's nothing more powerful than love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember this is a brother, brother Brandham is the one. He had such a tremendous healing campaign, such a tremendous campaign ministry seven times around the world praying for kings and potentates. But listen to his words here. If I had the choice tonight and was a sinner and was standing here before God and he have said now boy I'm going to give you all nine spiritual gifts. I'm going to let you prophesy, give you the spirit of prophecy. I'm going to make you a mighty preacher. Give you the word of wisdom and understanding. I'm going to give you the gift to speak in tongues and interpret. I'm going to give you a gift of healing that you'll have great faith for the sick and I'm going to do all these things for you. I'll give you all of that or I won't let you have any of those, but I'll let you have real love in your heart. &gt;&gt; I'd say, God, give me that love. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; For where there is tongues, they shall cease. &gt;&gt; For where there's prophecy, it will fail. &gt;&gt; Where there's knowledge, it'll vanish. But where there's love, it will endure forever. &gt;&gt; That's what drove the heart of God to send Christ to the earth. &gt;&gt; That love. Hey, and we know that brother Brandham was quoting from 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verse 8 says, Charity never faileth, and that's love. And that's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost never faileth. But where there be prophecies, they shall fail. Where there be tongues, they shall cease. Where there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is mature is come, when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. There's going to be no need to going and looking for milk for the the pat you on the back messages, the ones that are just going to make us feel good so that we can say that we're a body. We're looking for a body change. We're not looking to get comfortable in this body, brothers and sisters. It's going home time. But you know, I can I can see it loud and clear, and I trust you can tonight, too, that that which is perfect is come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fully mature word has come. &gt;&gt; There isn't going to be a maturing of the word. Huh? I think that's amazing to think about. We're at the maximum potential of the word right now. God sent his messenger. He gave him the book and he opened it up. He He revealed all of the hidden mysteries. We have the full potential of this book in our hands right now. All of the word of wisdom in our hands right now. I think this is a wonderful thing. We can get into knowledge. We're not going to tonight. I just want to do a little bit of a comparison right now as we kind of come in for a close tonight if that's okay. You know, we have the word of of wisdom according to the spirit of God, but then we have the word of wisdom according to the spirit of man. And and like I mentioned at the very beginning, Solomon, he actually stepped out and took himself an Egyptian wife. We he was supposed to have an Israeli wife, a bride who was a Hebrew wife, not someone from without. But that's what he did and that's how it started. And unfortunately, it's how it ended in his life. I'm sure we're all familiar with it, but you know, I want to talk about what brother Bradom said about it first before we get into it. Maybe we'll actually let's let's let's read it first out of First Kings 11. First Kings chapter 11. First Kings 11. I apologize. Sometimes I just get nervous. First Kings chapter 11. Verse one, but King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of Pharaoh. Mentioned right off the top. Many strange women along with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, the Ammonites, the the Zidonians, and the Hittites. And you know, I just as I was studying this, I was thinking, you know, if he would have taken a Hebrew wife, would he have taken one of each of those? &gt;&gt; But you know what happens is once we actually step, just one step into a sin, one step into a transgression, it can be so much easier to just take one more step because we've already taken a step. We're already there. That's what the devil says. You're already here. It's not going to be that big of a deal. It's going to be two feet more. Who cares? just go ahead. Right? But before long, we can find ourselves in a position that's not good. What I'm saying is he moved away from the wisdom of God, that word of wisdom that God gave him, and he moved into the wisdom of man, looking at the flesh, the lust of the flesh, right? But King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Zidonians, and Hittites, of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, "Ye shall not go into them, neither shall they come in unto you." So God probably didn't say to Solomon in his dream, "Don't go and do this." But he just took it and actually, I would say, understood that Solomon would understand all of that. &gt;&gt; That would just be ingrained in who Solomon was because David was a man after Solomon's own heart, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; After God's own heart, I mean, not Solomon's heart. Although David had some things in his life that God had to get out of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We all have things in our lives that God has to get out of us. &gt;&gt; But he said says here in verse two, "Ye shall not go you shall not go into them, neither shall they come in unto you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Says here that Solomon clave unto these in love. And he had 700 wives. I just don't even have words. 700 W. The first time I read that, I just about fell off my chair. 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concupines. And his wives turned away his heart. Right from the very start, the very first thing he did, he transgressed the commandment of God. &gt;&gt; And God still honored him in his position &gt;&gt; because he asked the right thing. He had the right words, but he didn't realize that this this thing was going to actually haunt him, did he? He didn't he didn't know that that was going to be the way it would happen. Verse four says, "For it came to pass that when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father." Why was David's heart perfect before the Lord? Because he was quick to repent. &gt;&gt; David was quick to repent. That's why he was a man after God's own heart. And and it's such a sad thing to look at, to think that that would be the case. The man who WAS THE WISEST MAN, NOBODY BEFORE HIM, NOBODY EVER after him to be that wise would actually have that kind of an ending, that kind of a transgression in his life. Now, I wonder I'll throw this out there. Someone might know the quote, and I'm sure you'll flip it to me if you do, and I appreciate it when you do that. Is Solomon going to be there? Whose decision is that? It ain't mine. &gt;&gt; But I wonder that is he going to be there? &gt;&gt; Saul who was an enemy of God. &gt;&gt; He's there. &gt;&gt; Jonah the backslider. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said he wasn't backsliding a bit. &gt;&gt; He was in the will of God. That's what that's what the prophet said out of 1950. The angel on the commission. Brother Brandham, he says, 'Now, let's just get right down to our hearts now, and I want to tell you something, and we want to talk just for a few moments, just heart-to-heart. Don't you like that? &gt;&gt; How many of us would just love to have a meeting like that with a prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nowadays, I would love that. That would be so good. It would be so helpful, wouldn't it? Just to have a real heart-to-he heart with the prophet of God. I know there was a day in my life where I said I would never ever because I know who I am and I don't want him to know. But now let's just get right down to our hearts now. And I want to tell you something and we want to talk for just a few moments just hearttoheart. Now I realize and you realize too and ministers that a man can take a divine gift which is all that we had read about here in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. These are divine gifts that a man can take a divine gift send his soul to hell with it. &gt;&gt; Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that Solomon's going to hell. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that. But what I am saying is that you can have a divine gift. He had a gift of wisdom that God gave him because of the way he asked. God gave it to him. You can have that gift and still be wrong. Still actually be off the mark with it. But he says here that you can have a divine gift and send his soul to hell with it. You know that a gift from God. Now I don't mean just something that you imagine. I mean, if God has really given something and given it to your charge, you've got to use that with the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; How do you use the wisdom of God? &gt;&gt; Only by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Only by the spirit. That's the only way that you'll ever use it. He says, "Now, I've I've never in my life talked to a congregation like this. This this gets my attention when I hear the prophet say things like this. I've never in my life talked to a congregation like this, especially a congregation of healing campaign. But the thing that I want to see, I want it so bad. And that's the reason I'm talking to you the way I am. Now remember, divine gifts can easily get a person into trouble. that God, if he finds someone that he figures that he can entrust a divine gift with, we should reverence with all of our hearts. A man can actually be deceived if he is not living according to the word of God. He goes on to say, "Now you remember how many believes Moses was a divine-ged prophet of God?" He was. Everyone believes that. But Moses with that same divine gift got himself in trouble. And we know how he did. God told him, said, "You go speak to the rock." He already smitten the rock once. Said, "Go speak to the rock." And that rock was Christ. Is that right? And Christ wasn't smitten the second time. We just speak to him now. He was smitten once. and he brought forth the waters of life. And we just speak to the rock now and it brings forth the waters like God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; The rock in the wilderness was a perfect of John 3:16. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those Israelites were perishing and the rock was smitten and brought forth life and water. It's amazing too when you look at it. I don't know how how many people here have actually been there to see that rock. I don't even know if you can in the land of Israel if you can actually see that rock. It's on Mount Si, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But there's pictures of it if you look it up online. And it's tremendous to think that enough water to feed two million people could come gushing out of a rock. But we know just in in light of this quote here, Moses, he actually broke the type because Christ was that rock and he was to be smitten once. And he was told to go and speak to the rock, not to smite it. But what happened was he got under the influence of man's wisdom. But the ram talks about it later in the message. He says that he got his temper. his temper got a hold of him and he actually did that. And you know that he had to pay a price for it as well. He wasn't able to see this promised land that he was leading the people to. &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing that would be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But we know that he comes back and he does what he needs to do according to the word in uh in Revelations. And that day is coming. It's never been closer actually. Um for now though tonight brothers and sisters I just want to remind us that one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom. God will use an individual to have that word of wisdom just at the right time. And we know in another place in the scripture it talks about having a word fitly spoken. And the reason for that is there is a word of wisdom by the spirit that God will use in our life. And sometimes I think it's just beautiful. We were talking about it this weekend, how we can have a conversation about something with an individual and not even know anything about their life and suddenly there will be a whole uh shock and awe thing that happens where they will think that someone told you all about their life and and you will have just been talking by your own heart. You won't even understand what you have said, but they will think that you actually know something about their life. But what is that? That is a word of wisdom. Sometimes it's just maybe what we would call coincidental in the world, right? Where it doesn't really mean anything, but you would still say something that would actually mean something to an individual. And other times it would be something that would come from the pulpit. And it could be as simple as as maybe just an individual shaking someone's hand coming into church saying, you know, how you doing? I've had you on my heart. Did you have a headache this week? It could be something as simple as that. and and them not knowing that you had one, but you're shocked because they know the word of wisdom. It's all about the spirit and how God will operate that. And I just want to encourage us, brothers and sisters, to not be afraid of it, but to actually understand that God chooses to operate according to the gifts of the spirit in the church. &gt;&gt; And uh we're going to get into uh the rest of them. Next one we'll talk about the word of knowledge. It's by the same spirit. So uh I think this beautiful stuff in there because it overlaps as we read in Proverbs. Some of the scriptures in Proverbs talks about getting wisdom and the wisdom will actually lead to knowledge and uh we just trust the Lord. It's certainly wonderful to to be in service for him. But you know just like Solomon, he started out wrong. If it starts out wrong, it can't end up right. It can potentially, but it just takes surrender, complete surrender to the word. I'll call the musicians up tonight. You know, in uh I'm just going to read this scripture again here. And and in light of that quote that brother Bradom said, how we can have a gift in our life and uh a divine gift in fact, but still not actually use it the right way. It's right out of the scripture here. Solomon loved many strange women. And uh you know it can it can take us so far away from where we want to be. And if if you look at the scripture, you can see how some of his wives actually encouraged him. And I think it's it's shocking when you look at it because they didn't actually persuade him away from worship. They just persuaded him to worship their way. So, it's not actually a raging monster. They're probably beautiful women and very, very kind and smart, but they just changed his way of worship. And that's what God told them would happen. &gt;&gt; If you actually follow the women in the land, they're going to change your heart towards me. They'll take you away from me. And and you know, in the day in which we live, there's so many things. women is just one of the things we we all have things if we're not careful by the spirit. If we don't have that word of wisdom in our lives, if we're not surrendering ourselves to the spirit, we will be carried away unto those devices that will change our heart. And I just want to encourage us, we don't have to go there. It doesn't have to be that way. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; we can actually have the right outcome. But the only way that's going to happen is to surrender ourselves fully to the spirit of God. Maybe stand with me as we close tonight. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your word of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your open book, Lord, that you've given to us in the day in which we live. Lord, that we don't have to clamor over mysteries, wondering, asking. Lord Jesus, we can thank you for [music] giving to us the fully revealed word in the day in which we live. And we just ask, Lord, [music] that we could also have that word of wisdom in our lives, Lord, where we would recognize this book [music] to be fully open and that there's no no seals that are still closed. every seal is opened and your prophet declared it when he was here on earth. And we know that that's why you took him home, Lord, because he came and did exactly what you wanted him to do. And because of that, he was able to go on to his reward. And and [music] that's how you operate, Father. As soon as we accomplish that which you have for us on this life, in this life, you take us home, Lord. You you graduate us. And Father, we're so thankful for your way. It's not our way, Lord Jesus, but we trust you. And Lord, we commit all of our ways into your hands tonight. Father, if there's any of us that maybe have strayed, we pray that you would just forgive us, Lord, and allow us to come back, Lord Jesus, to where we left off because you never left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only thing that happens is we [music] stray from you, Father. So Lord, tonight I pray that if we have strayed that you would just allow us to come right back to where we started straying. Father, that we don't wind up in a situation like Solomon where we're so far removed, where we just can't even see our [music] way back. Father, we love you tonight and we thank you and we pray that you would just be with those [music] who couldn't be here tonight, Father. Some traveling and maybe some at home sick or at work. wherever they are. Father, we just thank you for them and we pray that you would just continue to keep your hand upon them. Lord, &gt;&gt; we just ask that you would be with our travelers [music] tonight. Father, that Lord, you would bless them and give them traveling mercies on their way back home. And if it be your will for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord, we'll certainly give you the praise. And Father, we just want to also [music] ask as a body that you would bless the youth meeting on Friday night. Lord, while the world celebrates the devil, Lord Jesus, the youth here, [music] we're going to celebrate you, Father. &gt;&gt; We just pray that you would just pour yourself [music] out through all of the individuals who attend that service. Father, we just love you and thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name [music] we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Lord, I lift your name on high. &gt;&gt; You want want to start [music] it? &gt;&gt; It's not the one. Could we sing maybe 11:22? Lord, I give you my heart. Oh, this is my [music and singing] desire to honor [music] you. Lord, [singing] with all my heart I worship you. [music] All [singing] I [music] have within me, Lord, I give you [music and singing] praise. All [music and singing] that I know is [music and singing] Lord. [music and singing] I give you my heart. I give you my soul. [music and singing] I live [music] for [singing] you. Every breath that [music] I [music] have [singing] with me. Is this your desire tonight? This is [music] my [singing] desire. to [music] [music] all my heart. I [music and singing] worship you. [music] All [singing] I have within [music] I [singing] [music] is &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, [music and singing] I give you my heart. I give you my [music] soul. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] every way. [music] Amen. Can we change the the tempo a little bit? Sing 507. Start with the chorus. Thank God I am free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thankful tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank God [music and singing] I am free. Free free [music] from this world of sin. I see the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. [music] I wonder [music] [music and singing] [music] for a long time [music] I travel down [music and singing] a long Oh, my heart was so heavy. [music and singing] Same. Hallelujah. Jesus, how he's [music] alive today. Oh, what a wonderful [singing] hour. [music] I'm so glad that I found it. He will [music] bring me out. [music] Thank God I am free. [music] [music] Heat. Heat.
