Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight like to read from the book of Revelation Chapter 2 continuing on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages tonight we'd like to read from Revelations chap 2 verse 12 onward talking about the Church in pergamus Revelations 2 verse 12 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou DW dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in antip pass was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit say saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we just ask that Lord Jesus you would reveal Lord our names to us Lord yes Lord father that we would not see ourselves according to our first birth here but Lord that we would get to know ourselves according to the second birth because we know that's the only thing that's going to help us in the day in which we live we love you we thank you we just commit all these words into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a few announcements before we get going here we have brother Dela ad deladon here on Sunday certainly looking forward to service with him we've got a prayer meeting coming up on the 6th that'll be at 7:30 p.m. we have uh brother Mario here brother marot Chua on June the 9th and we have brother Jack Duff here on Wednesday June the 12th we have a worship service on June 23rd at 6 pm sorry June 23rd at 6 pm and then we have brother Cadre digs here on June 26th which is a Wednesday and then we'll be rounding out the month with a youth uh event at our house on June the 30th that will be Sunday afternoon after service God bless you tonight are you happy certainly wonderful weather outside I love the the warmth and the the sunshine that we're feeling and all the birds are back it's a tremendous time of the year here life that we have to to enjoy after a a winter the cold dead winter here anybody had struggles this week I uh I don't know but I know myself I have it's been uh interesting and it's only been a couple days since we had service but the Devil he's not bashful and he loves to try and upset people and uh I just was I just was meditating on uh you know why we must be born again there's a few messages that brother Brandon preaches and uh another one is ye must be born again and and you know that's the critical factor is we just have to be born again we just need to have a new birth and outside of a new birth all the mysteries of the message are irrelevant it's all head knowledge it's going to do us no good we can talk about all the Deep things all we want but it's not going to change our body the only only thing that will change our body is the token and that's the life the literal life of Jesus Christ and that's what's demanded of our day today it's not just coming to church and having Association and being a member actively in an assembly that's not going to do it the only thing that will do it is the literal life of Jesus Christ that's the requirement for the seventh Church age all of the combination of every single other age culminates with this one thing the literal life of Jesus Christ because we know that he came Jesus came sunset Mountain happened a sword was placed back into the hand of man again amen it's not a closed book it's an open booken and we have the opportunity to do something with that book but we know the devil knows all of this and just doesn't believe that we are the ones he believes the word and trembles all of his minions believe the word and tremble but they just don't believe that it could be us and the worst thing that we have to contend with is to think could it could it really be us could could it be me I want to say tonight yes you not some other time not some other place every single human being has the opportunity to come but not every single human being has that seed Gene of God down on the inside of the inside to Quicken when this word of the seventh angel messenger comes upon that seed amen I just had a quote I wanted to bring tonight talking about struggles and and it's out of ye must be born again brother bradam did I send this to you I think I did it was kind of a last minute thing but um I think I actually gave you to the paragraph I'm thinking of one I want to go back one paragraph brother Bram he says Satan is such a cunning enemy he just so moves in so sin is so so what would I say it's so shrewd rude you know it's just cunning just kind of subtle that's the word subtle just so subtle that it just move right in so easy you know it looks just so innocent the first thing you know we just got like a spider web a spider with a web got you there you go he says and we know the more you struggle in a spiderweb when you see a a creature in a spiderweb the more they struggle the more Tangled they get the more Tangled they get the more trapped they are and you can't get out of it brother bandam goes on to say I'm thinking of one thing that's the end of the road which is perhaps not too far off for me I'm not a boy no more and I've got to think of then meeting all the people again my friend was telling me one time they was given a prize and I want this to go real down deep to every one of us one of those little things that he's saying just pause and and consider this think about this it just spoke to me we can get so hung up in our moments of Life can't we the devil wants us to get hung up in our moments of life he wants to pull out the magnifying glass and get right into detail with our lives and especially for us to go into detail with other people's lives and their Det details but brother Bram he says in Vancouver British Columbia they were given a prize for a boy that could ride a bicycle 12 in across for a 100 yards they'd give him a new Schwin bicycle we're all familiar with this story I just thought you know I'm going to read it and all the boys they thought they were fine Riders they'd go downtown for their mama get a basket of groceries and put it under their arm and ride back and never even touch the handlebars so each one knew he was going to win the contest they had a little old boy there that just you know mama's boy like and I I I know brother brandham is doing this description he's describing it and I just can't help but think that this is probably the type of individual that's maybe just a little bit of an oddball just doesn't fit in with everyone else doesn't doesn't want to do all the things that all the other people do and and go to all the places the other people go to just a little bit like brother bam would say a little bit of a boy there that that just you know mama's boy likee and and and none of them cared very much for him so they all got on their their time as their numbers were called they got on this board to ride and each one fell off but little boy rote it right out to the end never made a wobble and so all the boys got around him and said how'd you do it he said I'll tell you boys here's where it was and I think this is so this is to me one of the critical points not that we want to be too busy analyzing other people but what does he say here he said I watched what you all were doing and I seen your mistake see you were looking down like this trying to keep it on the board I just watched the end and held steady that's right sometimes we can get so busy in our moment just worrying about this and worrying about that and and and if we continue to worry we're going to fuss and we're going to Stew and eventually we're going to wobble and then we'll find ourselves falling off our track and we know we can get back isn't that grace of God wonderful because all we got to do is go back to where we got off that's what we were taught brother Brown he says there you are see that's the idea not what's right here but the end and keep steady looking to the Lord Jesus don't get busy looking at me and you and the worst thing of all brothers and sisters don't get busy looking at yourself oh my goodness that can be a really tough one but we have to make sure that we are living our lives true and pure we certainly don't want to be misrepresenting but I think if we can humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord then he will pick us up up and we have the opportunity to go forwards and and he would that every one of us would actually make it right to the very end I just thought that was just for free tonight just uh a little tidbit for free you know what I want to do uh what I've done for the last uh I think at least one or two I'd like to go right to the very back of the book and uh read the last three paragraphs for those people who are tuning in those people who are maybe new to what we're doing here um talking about the exposition of the seven Church ages that was uh put together by William Mary and Bram people think that perhaps this is a cult and people want to potentially follow a man if you just listen to his words you might actually see what his intentions are and so as we enter into this next chapter the pergam and church age I just want to reinforce this I want to emphasize this the last three uh paragraphs do we have them there yeah so we conclude perfect so we conclude the seven Church ages saying only what the spirit said to each age not a new book not not some other author he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches now brother brandham is saying here I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the ages but he has been Faithfully dealing with our hearts that we may turn to him not turn to to William Mary and bradam not turn to Jeffersonville Indiana that we would turn to him that's the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him and we know that's Ephesians chapter 4 not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or an organization I have never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in who in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word now what cult founder would ever say these words point to Jesus Christ I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart amen not get us upset and feel awkward because now we're going to be on the spotlight he's going to be able to see all of our Lives we want to be able to Rejoice with him talking about the pergan church age I think it's a just a beautiful thing you know um verse 17 of uh Revelations chapter 2 here he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh what do they have to overcome the pergami and church age they have to overcome the Deeds of the nicians the people that want to try and conquer the leoty because it's not just one individual and it's not just one anointing even though it is it always is an anointing that falls on an individual but it's many faet multifaceted is what I'm trying to say they have to overcome the Deeds of the nicians the doctrine of the nicians specifically and they also have to overcome the doctrine of balum and that is a very big one that's very vast Doctrine it's not just single-handed it's not very specific and small the doctrine of balum is is very wide reaching but we know we've talked about this in the past I just think it's fascinating and I love the way brother Brandon brings it in this book we're going to get into it in a minute but I just wanted to say this how important it is to remember what was it that balum did he couldn't actually get God to curse the children of Israel because he had already blessed them and we know he tried to pay the prophet the hireling prophet and the hirling prophet said hey I went and ask God and God said nope can't do it I've already blessed them so they're blessed so just let them be blessed so he tried and he tried and the only thing he could do was go around the backside of the children of Israel and then start talking bad about the children of Israel and pointing out all of the little faults and all of the little things all of the humanity on and on and on it it and that's what happened and so before long they actually fell right it was only by that the the doctrine of balum terrible terrible let's begin the paman church age so brother Ram he has Revelations 2 2-17 I guess we'll read it and to the angel of the church and pergamus write these things saith he which hath a sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where an antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate so four very specific things that he's not pleased with that they have to overcome he goes on to say repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it pergamus pergamum the ancient name was situated in Mya I think I said that right I hope so in a district watered by Three Rivers by one of which it communicated to the Sea it was described as the most illustrious City in Asia it was a city of culture with a library second only to that in Alexandria I just can't help but think based on that description right there that it must have been a very modern city and it must have been full of knowledge they must have been very intelligent people to have the second best library and and to have culture civilization right yet it was a city of great sin given over to lenus writes of the worship of esup ASC leas sorry whom they worshiped in the form of a living serpent which was housed and fed in the temple in this beautiful city of irrigated Groves public walks and Parks lived a small group of dedicated believers who were not fooled by the veneer of beauty and aboard the satanic worship that filled the place amazing to think about this in their Temple they would have a beast the form of a living serpent in their church that they would worship but but it doesn't stop there going back I looked up the word lenus and uh you know there's a few definitions for it but it's unrestrained relations and that's edited because we're in a mixed audience unrestrained relations lascivious libertine lwd number two is unrestrained by law or general morality Lawless immoral number three is going Beyond customary or proper bounds or limits disregarding rules Lous rights of worship wow by this escap less and I looked this up and uh this was a man a male masculine who was the god of Medicine of healing of Rejuvenation and of Physicians so this is what they were worshiping this is how they were worshiping in their cultured educated environment and I just can't help but think you know this kind of dovetails with the life that we're living now the the culture and and the education the knowledge that we have and the world in which we live we've got lots of public parks pretty much every city you go to there's public parks and walkways with lots of depending on the time of year green areas and and lots of beauty you can see it and remember brother Bram says it he's said it multiple times thus far in this book that the the words that are spoken are for every age it's not just applicable to one age but here we have the Lous rights of worship of I got to learn this word here whom they worshiped in the form of a living Serpent and was housed and fed in the temple just tremendous the age the pergan age lasted about 300 years from 312 to 606 ad the messenger using our god-given rule for choosing the messenger to each age that is we choose the one whose Ministry most closely approximates that of the first messenger Paul and we unhesitatingly declare the pergan church pergan Messenger to be Martin Martin was born in 315 in hungry however his life work was in France where he labored in and around tours as a bishop he died in 399 this great Saint was the uncle of another wonderful Christian St Patrick of Ireland Martin was converted to Christ while he was following a career as a professional Soldier it was while he was still engaged in this occupation that a most remarkable Miracle occurred it it is recorded that a beggar lay sick in the streets of the town where Martin was posted the winter was cold the the winter cold was more than he could bear for he was poorly clad no one paid any attention to his needs until Martin came by seeing this poor man's plight but not having extra garment he took off his outer cloak cut it in two with his sword and wrapped the cloth around the freezing man he attended him the best he could and went on his way that night the Lord Jesus appeared to him in a vision there he stood like a beggar wrapped in the half of Martin's garment he spoke to him and said Martin though he is only a cuman though he is only a cuman has clothed me with this garment from that time on Martin sought to serve the Lord with all his heart his life became a series of Miracles manifesting the power of God and I know that that is exactly the description of Martin for his day but I just I highlighted that in in in the thought that you know that is literally the life of a Believer today the devil will try and say no you don't have a series of Miracles manifesting the power of God but any True Believer knows it you don't have to look very far and you can say there there there there that's what that song is all about count your blessings how God helps us and deals with us along our way and many times things can seem like wow we did that does it happen because we did it or did God actually make it possible for us to do it after having left the Army and having become a leader in the church he took a very militant stand against idolatry he cut down the Groves broke up the images and pulled down the altars when confronted by the pagans for his deeds he challenged them in much the same manner as Elijah did the prophets of Baal he offered to be tied to a tree on its Underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless God intervened and turned the tree around while it fell the Wy Heathen tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill assured that the natural pull of gravity would cause the tree to fall as to crush him just as the tree began to fall God swung it around an uphill contrary to the all natural laws the fleeing Heathen were crushed as the tree fell on several of them I just kind of gasped when I I read that part there I have it highlighted as well the same manner that Elijah did to the prophets of Baal remember that Mount Carmel Showdown he killed 400 prophets and uh I mean that's pretty serious but he did it on the same basis historians acknowledge that on at least three occasions he raised the dead by faith in jesus' name in one instance he prayed for a dead baby like Elisha he stretched himself upon the babe and prayed it came back to life and health on another occasion he was called to help deliver a brother who is being carried away to his death in a time of great persecution by the time he arrived the poor man was already dead remember they didn't have phones in these days there was there was no sending a quick text or Whatsapp there was no immediate communication they had hanged him upon a tree his body was lifeless and his eyes protruded from the sockets but Martin took him down and when he had prayed the man was restored to life and to his rejoicing family Martin never did fear the enemy regardless of who it was am thus he went to personally face a wicked Emperor who was responsible for the death of many Spirit-filled Saints the emperor would not Grant an audience so Martin went to see a friend of the emperor one damasus a cruel Bishop of Rome but the bishop being a nominal Christian of the false Vine would not intercede Martin went back to the Palace but by now the gates had been locked and they would not allow him to enter he laid down on his face before the Lord and prayed that he would be able to get into the palace he heard a voice bidding him arise when he did so he saw the gates open of their own accord he walked into the court but the Arrogant ruler would not turn his head and speak to him Martin again prayed suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the unhappy Emperor vacated speedily sure the surely the Lord humbles the proud and exalts the lowly such was his adore in serving the lord that the devil was mightily aroused the enemies of Truth hired assassins to kill Martin can you believe this part they came by stealth to his home and as they were about to kill him he stood erect and bear his throat to the sword how many of us would do that tonight there it is go for it h wow as they leaped forward the power of God suddenly hurled them back across the room so overcome were they in that Holy and fearful atmosphere that they crawled upon their hands and knees and begged forgiveness for the attempt on his life too often men are signally used of the Lord they they become lifted up with pride but not so with Martin he ever remained The Humble servant of God one night as he was prep preparing himself to enter the pulpit a beggar came to his study and asked for some clothing Martin referred the beggar to his head Deacon the hottie Deacon commanded him to leave thereupon he went back to see Martin Martin arose and gave the beggar his own fine robe and bade the Deacon bring him another robe which was of lesser quality that night as Martin preached the word the flock of God saw a soft white glow of light around his person tremendous surely this was a great man a true Messenger to that age never desirous of ought and that ought means anything never desired anything but to please God he lived a most consecrated life never could he be induced to preach until he had first prayed and was in such a spiritual frame as to know and deliver the full counsel of God by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven often he would keep the people waiting while he prayed for full Assurance pretty tough to keep on time when you do that just to know about Martin and his mighty Ministry might make one think that the persecution of the Saints had abated not so they were still being destroyed by the devil through the instrumental of the wicked they were burned at the stake they were nailed to logs face down and wild dogs were turned loose upon them so that the wild so that the dogs would tear away the Flesh and bowels leaving the victims to die in terrible torture babes were ripped from expectant mothers and thrown to Hogs people will answer for this woman's breasts were cut away and they were forced to stand erect while each heart throb poured out the blood until they crumpled in death and the tragedy was even greater to think about when one realizes that this was not solely the work of the Heathen but many times it was caused by so-called Christians who felt they did God a favor in Exterminating these loyal soldiers of the Cross who stood for the word and obedience to the Holy Spirit they weren't willing to compromise and go with the the flavor of the day John 16:2 they shall put you out of the synagogues yay the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God a service Mark 24:9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake you see the way these scriptures are the way the scripture is written is you cannot take and make it chronologically ordered because it applies over all of the ages especially when you get into the Book of Revelations the book of symbols going on though brother Bram says by signs and wonders by the power of the spirit Martin was truly Vindicated as the messenger to that age but not only was he gifted by a great minister he himself was forever true to the word of God he fought organization he with stod sin in high places he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of Christian Victory I just think that to me is like a a quote for our fridge another fridge quote maybe we could just see that as us he or she championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of Christian Victory overcoming the devil knowing that he has no power doesn't have to be just Martin a biographer wrote of him on this wise no one ever saw him angry or disturbed or grieving or laughing he was always one and the same and seemed something Beyond mortal wearing on his countenance a sort of celestial Joy never was anything on his lips but Christ never anything in his heart but piety peace and pity often did he weep for the sins even of those his detractors who when he was quiet and absent attacked him with viperous lips and poisoned tongues many hated him for virtues they themselves did not possess and could not imitate and alas his bitterest asants were Bishops I just think this is amazing he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of Christian Victory and knowing that people people were stabbing him in the back slaughtering his character talking bad about him what what was it using using viperous lips with poison tongues what did he do he often wept for them and prayed for them what a tremendous thing it's encouraging Revelations 212 B these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with the two edges the salutation the message to the Third Church age is about to come forth the third scene of this unfolding drama of Christ in the midst of his church is about to be revealed with trumpet-like voice the spirit presents the matchless one he which hath the sharp sword with two edges how vastly different this is excuse me how vastly different is this presentation from the time when pilate introduced the Lamb of God clothed in mocking Robes of purple smitten and Thorn crowd saying behold your king now Regal robed and crowned with Glory stands the Risen Lord Christ the power of God in these words he which hath a sharp sword with two edges lies another revelation of godhead I love this he just goes so well into the godhead in this book in the Ephesian age you will recall he was set forth as the unchanging God in the saman age we saw him as the one true God and beside him there was no other now in this perian age there is but further revelation of his godhead set forth by his association with a sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing a Sunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and isn't that exactly what the second poll was Ephesians 6:17 and take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Revelations 19313 and 15a and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and out of his mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword John 1 1:3 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same word was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him him was not anything made that was made 1 John 5:7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one how do we get separation there I just don't understand that now we can see his association with the word he is the word that is he that is who he is is the word in his name in John 1:1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus and Paul says the very same thing in Hebrews 1 Hebrews 1 1:3 God who had sunre times and diverse manners spake in time past to the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son logos whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom he also made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus was the expressed image of God again in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt amongst us the great spirit God unto which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold was now tabernacled in flesh and dwelt among men expressing the fullness of God to men I just can't help but think as we read this what would it have been like to be with Jesus we know people were uneasy being around William Bram for fear that he would understand their thoughts or be able to discern their heart what would it be like to get the Revelation that he is the son of the Living God and he is Manifest in flesh The Living Word right there in front of you my and to have him call us friend hey John 1:18 no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and you know as I say all of that I have to say this I'm going to I feel like I want to start preaching now but to think that you know once upon a time people could have actually been drawn to Jesus and got to know Jesus and and spoke to Jesus and recognized jesus' voice and and had all of the opportunity to experience Jesus God manifest In the Flesh The Living Word right there you know in our age even though Jesus has been God what did he do he called a prophet to remind us that he is the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters and he is still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart he knows exactly who we are exactly where we're at exactly what we're going through amen and when we have struggles just remember Paul had struggles and he sought God Thrice for those struggles and what did God say to him hey you know what I know that you've got them and and it's just so that you don't get puffed up beyond recognition because of all the Revelation you've got you're going to have that thorn in your flesh in fact your flesh is the thorn in your flesh so get used to it just look at don't look at yourself don't look at other people just look at me this just gets me excited here sorry God who on occasion would manifest his presence by the cloud or Pillar of Fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this God whose heart characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets now became Emmanuel God With Us declaring himself not Jesus the representative of God not Jesus the ambassador of God Emmanuel God With Us that is so powerful the word declare is taken from the Greek root which we often interpret as exis sis which means to thoroughly explain and make clear that is what the Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God he revealed God to us with such perfect clarity that John could say this about him in 1 John 1 1-3 that which was from the beginning which we have heard logos means speech which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us I believe we could all just say those words and say Amen that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ he called him his son just so that we could actually comprehend because a father has a son but if Jesus is the son of the father and he has son Sons my then we got a brother it's tremendous to think you know I don't want to go I'm not going off on a tangent don't don't worry I just think it's amazing to think that God would condescend so far to allow us to be able to see him as a brother he doesn't want to see us doesn't want us to necessarily see him as God Almighty on the throne even though we can't help but understand that and acknowledge that but that he would come in a way that we could comprehend it with our finite Minds just amazing when God was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh he that hath seen me hath seen the father that makes it pretty simple doesn't it now back in Hebrews 1 1:3 we made note that Jesus was the expressed image of God he was God expressing himself in man to man but there is something else to note in these verses especially verses 1 and two God who at sunre times and diverse manner spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son I want you to notice here in the margin of your Bible you will see a correction the word by is not a correct translation it should be in not by it then reads correctly God spake in times past unto the fathers in the prophets by means of the word 1 Samuel 321b for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord that brings out 1 John 5:7 perfectly the spirit and the word are one Jesus revealed the Father the word revealed the father Jesus was the Living Word praise God today he is still that Living Word when Jesus was upon the Earth he said in John 14:10 believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works we know even Nicodemus who had to go to to see him after dark because he couldn't be seen or heard coming to meet the rabbi but even he said we know that these are not works of man that this is the work of God it has to be there's no man that can do this here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works and I've got that highlighted I'm going to read it again because I believe that that is our Victory today here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works he goes on to say that is exactly what we have been teaching all along and when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced I say Lord help me get back to being a a word bride I just want to be a word bride that's all I want to be my the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God and brothers and sisters that's why I say God God's will is his word and if you want his will get his word and take that and apply it in every area of your life and see if he won't bless you that is how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them that is how it was with Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him Jesus both began to do and teach my Doctrine is not my own but the fathers that sent me acts 1:1 John 716 remember now John the Baptist was both the prophet and the messenger of his day he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in Jordan the word of God Jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly Spirit failed the word always comes to the truly spirit filled and what Spirit are we talking about brothers and sisters not the spirit of Calgary Living Word Assembly not the spirit of some other church not not not the spirit of of of some tradition or teaching but the spirit of the Living God the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that Spirit the word always comes to the truly spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy holy ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said in John 1416 to17 a I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now some people would take that and try and make it that it's another comforter it's it's something else but it's nothing other than the spirit of Jesus Christ that he broke apart at Calvary and sent back on every other man who is able to receive it he goes on to say now we know what truth is Thy word is truth John 1717b again in John 8 why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word if we have ears to hear what the spirit sayith to the church brothers and sisters it is something else it's beyond what we can even comprehend in this life did you notice that Jesus said the world could not receive the Holy Ghost my my my my well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the word would come to you amen you would receive it I think this is is just lightning here this is electrified this is incredible because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters as the prophets listen how he says that as if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets what isn't that a a prophetic off isn't that something out there is isn't that for another so no no no this is what the prophet is saying if you have the Holy Spirit like the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it remember what we just read the word always comes to truly spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost and boy oh boy I just love these nuggets I have to read them again I just I'm getting excited here when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one they cannot work apart from one another my goodness John 14:26 but the comforter which is the the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of God John 1613 how be it when he the spirit of Truth word is come he will guide you into all truth Thy word is truth for he shall not speak speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear word of God that shall he speak word and he will show you things to come Spirit bringing the word of Prophecy just going to pause there for a second Spirit bringing the word of Prophecy it's not all on brother bram's shoulders brothers and sisters he couldn't teach everything that he knew and he even said that it was up to other individuals to expound upon this word he didn't have time to do it he came and did the introduction he did his job but what he's saying here is that there's got to be people that will actually get the true spirit that the word will actually come to and what happens when that happens is it's Bingo Revelation wow I was thinking about that when the service was happening when the preacher was preaching something came into my heart and I went and I looked it up and I thought I've never heard this before I've never even thought this before and when I looked it up in the Bible it matched the scripture and when I typed it in to search into the message I saw it came up in the message that's exactly what brother Bram said when you put those two together brothers and sisters Bingo you've got Revelation from God directly from God speaking directly to you when you have his Spirit the word will always come to you I I just love that that gets me that gets me going boy I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth amen and brothers and sisters it's so easy isn't it to say I'm in the truth oh yes I know the truth I've got all the books I've got all the tapes I've been to Jeffersonville I know this Minister I know that Minister and better yet they know me yeah yeah but have you got the spirit because if you don't got the spirit then the word's not coming to you and alls you have is an education you've got knowledge in your head but it's got to go from here to here it's got to make that that Journey 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are not just the instruction of the Lord not just suggestions of the lord they're Commandments of the Lord what Paul taught brothers and sisters is not optional they're Commandments of God Amen or else that scripture is false that's that's out of the King James version right there isn't it 1 Corinthians 14:37 that's actually false scripture if that's not true but how do we just go and take scripture out I remember brother Ken talking about that you know there's one in there that you just don't like it just doesn't work for your flesh so you just want to get in there and you just want to tear it out but when you do that where do you stop once you start tear out this page tear out that half of another page and maybe just a corner of another one all these different places throughout the Bible then you have an incomplete Bible you know sometimes you don't even have to do that all you got to do is buy a different version of the Bible and and we saw that that that go around on what's at but it's so true we've got to be careful the devil is very very subtle am 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet not many people think of themselves to be prophets I know there's some people out there that do even in the message but I know there's a prophetic class of people but there's only one major prophet to this age brothers and sisters If any man think of himself to be a prophet or be spiritual let him acknowledge the things I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord Brother bradam goes on to see now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age right amen as he set the church in order Paul had to say though to those who claim claimed another Revelation verse 36 what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only brother Bram goes on to say the evidence of a spirit filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth word but to receive the truth word and to believe it and Obey it and you know we've heard it said many times obedience is just so much better than sacrifice it's so much better than sacrifice the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth word not looking for signs and wonders but to just simply receive receive the truth receive the word when we hear it we just raise up our hands and say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord I just want to receive the truth the word and the spirit and then I will thereby be able to believe it and Obey it he goes on to say have you noticed in Revelations 2217 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she doesn't put interpretations on the message of the hour we just read that the bride the the believer the true Spirit fill believer will actually follow the word of the messenger for their age they won't say oh I can just do it this way and I can do it that way and I can just make it the other no they'll follow exactly what the messenger said for that age she is a word bride proving she has the spirit boy I just feel like I could preach that's why I'm pausing here I just she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true Christians took the word for their age did you get that last thought I repeat every Church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him and individual hear what the spirit saith to the churches the spirit gives the word how can we get the word without the spirit we just have to have the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters and if we have the Holy Spirit then we'll line up with this word and we'll say Amen to this word and this word will come to us it won't upset us it won't make us uneasy it it won't be the same old same old it'll be a a renewing every single time the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has had its own elect and that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them John 8:47 and he that is of god Hearth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God that's harsh they refused the word Jesus they refused Jesus many people could say that they refused Jesus but I love the way the prophet says that they refuse the word right and his works for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of God Isaiah 54:13 and all thy children shall be taught of God Holy Spirit I'll call the musicians as we close here Jesus said the same thing in John 6:45 being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit filled no other Criterion I love it there's no wiggle room here there's no room for interpreting it and saying well it should be this way or that way this is what the prophet said the prophet was the mouthpiece of God this I would have to say in my own opinion would be God speaking through the prophet to the age of people who would be willing to pick up this book and read it Jesus said the same thing in John 6:45 being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit filled no other Criterion but what are and interpretation and the other gifts they are manifestations that is what the word teaches read it in 1 Corinthians 2:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then Paul names those manifestations now comes this very good question I know that you are all anxious to ask why isn't the manifestation an Evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost because you surely could not manifest the Holy Ghost unless you were truly Spirit-filled now I'm just going to stop there because this gets we need to read a lot more to actually answer it maybe stand with me tonight as we close I just get carried away I can't help it brothers and sisters when the bride will get back to being a word bride I say Lord help me help me be a word bride let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for your word we thank you Lord Jesus that you told your subjects in heaven that you're going to go down one day
