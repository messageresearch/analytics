[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank you. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Amen. God bless you. I don't open just if you want to close it. Yeah. Sorry. I forgot to close in here. God bless each one of you. We're welcome once again. Awesome Lord tonight. Our pastor, I know I think it was our pastor who had it, but just really good news. The Nigerian hostages have been freed, released. So, it comes that close to home. You know, you hear about the Israelis and just the travesty, horrible things that have happened, but it's this close to home. It really hits his heart and it's just wonderful to see the Lord intervene &gt;&gt; and I'm sure they are all rejoicing back in the journey as well. Thank the Lord for his mercy, his grace. Let's start with that song tonight. By his grace I am redeemed. Oh, by his grace I am redeemed. [Music] By his blood I am made free and I now can know him face to face. By his power I have been raised in now in Christ my faith. Oh I will praise the glory of his grace. Oh, by his grace I am redeeing and by his blood I am and I now can know him face to Hey [Music] my [Music] I will praise the glory. kind of me. No one knew how alone I was feeling. [Music] And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Oh, I left it and said my life was fine without you. Well, I was covering up the secret tears. I cried. Oh, then one day someone told me of your mercy. Oh, and the love you showed that day on Calvary. Oh, there you purchase my redemption. Oh, when you broke sin's power, set my spirit free. Oh, I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, how you preious blood I found. And my sins are washed. Oh, they're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. [Applause] Yes, it's true. There's been days when I failed you. Oh Lord, the many times I've gone astray, but I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness. Aren't you glad for that tonight? Oh, and then every time I pray, oh, no one else can ever care for me like you, Lord. Other friends can never be as close to me. I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. Oh, knowing you are everything I ever [Music] love me. Oh, [Applause] how you [Music] [Applause] preious blood are. [Music] Oh, and my sins are washed. Oh, they're all washed away.

And Lord, we can rejoice and say the God, the God that delivered to the hands &gt;&gt; of Abraham, &gt;&gt; Lot, &gt;&gt; and his people. &gt;&gt; When that brotherly love, Lord Jesus, as we heard this morning, drove him to go after his brother. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, &gt;&gt; the God Lord Jesus that spoke to David &gt;&gt; and said, "You can pursue &gt;&gt; and you will overtake &gt;&gt; and without fail recover all." We called upon your name &gt;&gt; and you heard us there Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We give you the glory, honor and praise as saints Lord around the world.

May you have your seats this evening. Just thinking this evening what Jesus said. Just ask a question. Anybody want to be happier tonight? Happier. Well, Jesus said if you do these things, happy are you if you do these things. So I want to be happier. I mean I want the joy of the Lord in my in my heart. And I think part of that would just be starting with happiness. But the Lord promised it. So, I mean, we come to these footwash and communion services are always special. &gt;&gt; I think the Lord's just pleased. And tonight, I'm just so moved by the actual prayer for those Nigerians. &gt;&gt; Just wonderful down from his glory.

Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Not just to exalt him, but to have the desire to exalt him. &gt;&gt; That is incredible. &gt;&gt; One more time, we find ourselves gathered together in his name. What a blessing. Yes, &gt;&gt; we certainly thank the Lord for this opportunity. We just want to one more time remember Sister Charmaine before his throne. Thank the Lord for his will and her life. We want to remember Sister Elaine. We have an unspoken request as well. And if you have a need tonight, maybe just defy gravity, make it known unto him as we go in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, we exalt thee tonight. &gt;&gt; Father, we exalt you above all that we can think, all that we can understand, &gt;&gt; all that we can perceive. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that you are the author &gt;&gt; and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, the only thing that you've called us to do is to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we thank you, Lord. But if we have that ability, it's because you've given it to us. So it makes it so amazing to exalt you, Lord Jesus. Tonight, Father, one more time, we just invite you to have the preeminence in our service, Lord, in our gathering. We know that your word declares where two or three gather together in your name, that Lord, you don't just send a messenger, you're there. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we welcome you here tonight in our midst, Lord. Father, not like the Pharisee did. Lord Jesus, we welcome you tonight with a kiss, Lord. Oh, Father, we anoint you with oil and we desire to wash your feet, Lord, to appreciate you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, as a wife would tend to her husband, Father. We desire to do that tonight. &gt;&gt; We desire to love you, Father. to give you all the praise and glory, Lord, to exalt you greater than anything we could imagine. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we thank you for the needs once again, Lord. Sister Elaine and Sister Charmaine, and the unspoken request, Father. Lord, we know that you know all about them. You have them all in your control. And we thank you, Father, for the solutions. And Lord Jesus, each and every need that was expressed to you tonight by the raising of a hand. Lord, you know the the need behind that hand in the heart, Lord, of your children. And we just invite you, Lord, to sovereignly meet that need. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, sometimes it's just one grain of sand at a time for that mountain to move. &gt;&gt; And other times it's a it's a little landslide. And other times the whole mountain gets picked up and cast into the sea. However you want it done, Father, that's our desire. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We just want to surrender to you tonight fully and completely, Lord Jesus. Mind, body, and spirit, Father. Lord Jesus, Lord, that our souls could just lie open before you tonight, Lord. That you could minister one more time to us. Father, we just ask that you would be glorified in this service, Lord, as we go forwards. Father, we pray that you would just open our eyes a little further, Lord Jesus, as we walk with you along the way. We love you, Father, and we thank you. We just ask all these things. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we exalt thee. [Music] We exalt thee. We exalt thee. [Music] Oh Lord, we exalt me. He exalt me. He exalt thee. Oh Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. Thank you musicians. What a wonderful presence it is tonight. If you have your Bibles, I'd like to read from Luke chap 24. Luke chap 24 verse 13. Thank you everyone for entering in to worship. It really sets an atmosphere. I know as you know as well the Lord is pleased with worship. &gt;&gt; He desires worship. My Luke 24:13. And behold, two of them went the same day to a village called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about three score furongs. That's about seven and a half miles. And they walked together. They talked together, sorry, of all the things which had happened, the the crucifixion, the persecution, the scattering of the sheep. Verse 15. And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. &gt;&gt; But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, "What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?" And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem? And hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?" And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Yay. And concerning, and certain women also of our company, made us astonished, which were early at the suppler. And when they found not his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the suppler, and found it, even so, as the women had said. But him they saw not. &gt;&gt; Then said he unto them, "Oh fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?" And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And we know for sure that he could have done many signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; But what did he do? He pointed them right back to the word. &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say? Because that's who I am. &gt;&gt; And they drew nigh unto the village whether they went. And he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, "Abide with us, for it's toward evening, and the day is far spent." And he went in to tarry with them. He always comes where he's invited. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them, he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they said one to another, my did not our heart burn within us &gt;&gt; while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scripture. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer one more time. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your revealing power, Lord Jesus. It takes revelation from you, Father, to open the eyes of our mind to open the eyes of our heart, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, many times we can see with our eyes, but we do not perceive correctly. Help us, Lord Jesus, to perceive correctly in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; We just commit these words into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Just a couple of comments. As we prepare for a communion service tonight, I just think it's so wonderful to hear the testimony of the brethren that were held captive for three weeks, have been released. What a tremendous thing that is. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Applause] I don't think I don't think that we'll ever be able to give enough praise or glory for that. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing it is to know that that's the God we serve right there. &gt;&gt; There's no need that's too great for him. You know, just thinking about our our little service tonight, I just I just am so encouraged to see everyone that's come out. We we've come not to see one another. We've come to see that God. &gt;&gt; That's who we've come to see. The one that would deliver the captives and set them free according to his word. &gt;&gt; You know, talking about our scripture tonight, these these disciples, they were with Jesus. They they knew who he was. They fellowshipped with him. They went fishing with him. They they they saw mighty signs and wonders with him. They they walked with him. They talked with him. But even though they were on this road to Emmas, they did not recognize that's who was with them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were so caught up in the moment. So caught up in the in the sadness and maybe the sickness, maybe all of what was going on in the day in the city in which they were in, they just had to get out of town. They just had to go clear their minds. And here they were on this road to Emmas. And we know that as Jesus drew near himself, as they spoke about him, it pays to speak about him. &gt;&gt; It's worth it to say his name. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want us saying in the name of Jesus. But we know that's where all power lies. &gt;&gt; Only in the name of Jesus. When we eat and we bless our food, we ought to do it in the name of Jesus. When we ask any petition, we ought to do it in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Many times I've been guilty to say in your name, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; But whose name is that? &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Say the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; He comes where he's invited. But you know, even as these these brothers were were ministering, can you imagine ministering to Jesus, &gt;&gt; walking with him and ministering to him, beginning to preach to him and tell him, give him a lesson about what's gone on. I can't imagine it, &gt;&gt; but here they were doing that. And and they talked about how the the women were first at the supplr in the morning, and they thought that he was the one that would deliver Israel. And as they walked along the way with him, they began to express their hearts to him as he asked them questions. And they he even they even said to him that, you know, they thought that it had seen a vision of angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know in another part in the scripture, I'm not sure which one it is. It might be in John, that they said that when the girls came back, when the sisters came back, they said that they were telling tales. They didn't even believe that Jesus had risen, even though that's what he himself, the word made flesh, told them would happen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And here they were walking with them, not even realizing that's who it was. It's amazing how wonderful he is. &gt;&gt; But there came a time, and that was at the evening time where they drew nigh unto the village where they constrained him. They said, you know, don't don't don't go. Just just come on. We kind of like our fellowship. There's something about this fellowship, isn't there? Why don't you just stay with us? Don't don't go any further. And we know that it was in the evening time that he broke the bread to them. He served them communion. I can only imagine that they recognized it in that moment. In that instant, the way that he broke the bread in that meal before he actually went into his passion, before he had to go through the crucifixion, the story they must have heard, those 12 that were there, that exclusive meeting that they were at, the description they must have had, the way that he did everything would have been so amazing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for some, it might have just been a normal event. He just broke the bread and he just poured the wine and you know he just got a little bit weird and washed their feet. But for others it might have been amazing to think about if this truly is the Messiah and he wants to wash our feet. We know Peter had a problem with that. We'll get into that a little bit later. But I just want to talk about this scripture tonight. how they how they were able to walk along and talk along about Jesus, about what was going on, but not recognize what was taking place right before their eyes. &gt;&gt; I want to talk about recognizing what's taking place right before our eyes. &gt;&gt; If if we're talking about the Jesus that was there with them that could open that could stop their eyes &gt;&gt; first off, &gt;&gt; then he could open their eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're talking about that Jesus, we're talking about the Jesus that could come down on Sunset Mountain with an open book in his hand and put one foot upon the land and one foot upon the sea and declare that there shall be no more time. There's no more mystery. The mystery, our history, all of those mysteries are open now. &gt;&gt; If that same Jesus is here tonight, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; what's our petition? &gt;&gt; What do we have need of? You know, we heard it this morning. Depends on what you think it is. &gt;&gt; And that's the same with our service tonight. That's the same with every single service that we have the opportunity to go to. I just feel I need to go this way, brothers and sisters. It depends on what we think it is. &gt;&gt; Is it just a gathering to get together? Is it just an ordinance that that the prophet of God said that we ought to do, so we just go and do it? Yes, indeed it is. All of that, but more. &gt;&gt; Isn't it more? Isn't it a lot more? We're actually getting together to fellowship with the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; But it depends on what you think it is. &gt;&gt; You can take your side with the priest or or maybe I'll say it this way. We can take our side. You could take your side with tradition &gt;&gt; the way that we've always done it. &gt;&gt; We sing the song this way all the time and we never get out of order. We always sing it that way. We've always done it that way and we'll always do it that way. We we always act a certain way. We never get out of order. Brothers and sisters, the prophet even says it sometimes it's good to get a little bit out of order. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just change it up a little bit. Don't worry. God's never going to let us get out of order scripturally. &gt;&gt; If we filled with the Holy Ghost, we're never going to get too far out of order. We might get a little bit strange according to what people think, but it depends on what you think it is. Is it emotion? I can't help but think when we get in the presence of the king, I'm going to get em when I do, I'm going to get emotional. &gt;&gt; I'm probably liable to not even be able to speak &gt;&gt; probably want to wash his feet with my tears. &gt;&gt; Only thing is I don't have that much hair to do much with. But can you imagine to be able to perceive being in the presence of the King of Kings? Brothers and sisters, depends on what you think. Because if you think according to the scripture, according to the word of God, where two or three are gathered together in his name, he's there in the midst. That means he's here right now. For some people think that he's here right now. Other people think, well, I'll just take the side with the priest, maybe my tradition, and I'll call it maybe the devil. Maybe I won't call it the devil. I'll just say, well, brother Barry, he's just getting a little bit emotional now. It's just his way. He does it once in a while. You know, I'll just shrug my shoulders and say, "There it is again." Or, you know, it depends on what we think about it. Or you can take the side with the believer and call it God. Whichever you believe, that's where your reward will come from. I think it's so beautiful. I want to encourage us. Don't look at the veil. Don't stumble at the veil. Don't look at your brother. Don't look at your sister. Don't look at your father. Don't look at your mother. Even though you should look at all of those, but don't look to them for your experience. Look to Jesus Christ for your experience and allow him to manifest that experience in your life the way that he wants it done. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And your eyes will be opened as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; In 1964, Brother Brandham, when their eyes were open, he says, "I've seen not long ago where they had sunflower seeds they'd had packaged for nearly 4,000 years in Egypt. They took that seed and some of that wheat that was in the garner, I love how he says this, that Joseph put in there." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Some of that wheat that was in the garner that Joseph put in there. &gt;&gt; Wow. all those years. How would he know that? &gt;&gt; Maybe just a little prophetic insight. &gt;&gt; The rest of the world might say, "Wow, that's just that's just not even real. That's not true." But here we have the prophet saying that Joseph put in there. Wow. All those years. And when it was placed in the ground and the sun struck it, it lived. &gt;&gt; That germ of life stayed there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh brother, when we were ordained of God before the foundation of the earth to be sons and daughters of God, when that light strikes it, there's no denomination, no church boundaries. I'm going to say no traditions. There's nothing there's nothing there's no church boundaries. There's no criticism. There's no nothing going to stop it. It's going to live cuz God said it would. Amen. &gt;&gt; They recognize it. &gt;&gt; Her eyes come open and she knew it. She knew it once inside. She knew the scripture. That's the reason she knew him. These disciples after his resurrection didn't know the scripture and that's the reason they didn't know him. &gt;&gt; That's why John, &gt;&gt; a type of the bride, he was commanded to take the book and eat it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; What was that book? It was the book of redemption. This is it right here. &gt;&gt; This book right here. Take that book, John. A type of the bride. And eat it up. &gt;&gt; And you know what'll be so sweet in your mouth? It'll be sweet as honey in your mouth. But it'll make your belly bitter. Your flesh won't like it. Your body won't like it. Your traditions won't like it. All of your ways, carnally speaking, will not like it. But it will be so good for you spiritually. These disciples after his resurrection didn't know the scripture and that's the reason they didn't know him. And that's the way the Pharisees didn't know it. He said, "Search the scriptures. You think you have eternal life and they're the one that tell you who I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the vindication of his being. Then when the promise is a vindicated, their eyes were opened. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; And they knew him. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, tonight I want to encourage us when we come to this communion table and we partake of this supper. When we partake of the bread, when we partake of the wine, remember what we're doing. We're remembering the Lord's body that was broken. We're remembering his blood that was shed for us. And you know, he's not off in some other dimension hoping that we're actually able to receive the word for our day. He's right here. &gt;&gt; Right here tonight. &gt;&gt; Melzdc himself, Jesus Christ, Michael, whoever we want to call him, the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; all the same. That one is here tonight to minister to us &gt;&gt; this bread and this wine. Don't look at the brothers. Don't look at the sisters. Don't look at the pastor. Don't look at anybody. Look away to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say also that same thing that opened eyes closed eyes too. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Those who made fun of it eternally put them back to where they was at the beginning. You see, closed their eyes. Peter's eyes was opened by the same thing. He was looking for it. And I just believe that's the way it is for the believer in the day in which we live. When we're looking for it, we'll see it. When we're looking for him, we will see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that brother Brandham, he brought it out in in uh boy oh boy, I'm drawing a blank now. We can look at nature and we can see God in nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. But many times people get so scientific with this word, they can't see Jesus and they put them off into the past or put them out into the future and just miss what's happening right now. But our eyes, I believe, have been open to what's happened in the day in which we live. Peter's eyes was opened by the same thing. The same thing that closed some eyes open others. And I think it's beautiful in the scripture that we read tonight how the same one was able to close eyes of those who were with him &gt;&gt; but yet open them all at the same time. &gt;&gt; Peter's eyes was opened by the same thing. He was looking for it. Nathaniel's eyes Jesus said he knew them before the foundation of the world that they were to be these messengers. Now, in the face of all of this, in this age that we're living in, what has it done to your eyes? &gt;&gt; What has this message done to our eyes? I think it's just so beautiful. And I I love how Brother Brandham brings it that way. And that's why I'm doing it tonight, brothers and sisters. What has it done to our eyes tonight? What has it done to our eyes 10 years ago is is good, but where are we today? Because 10 years ago, we could have been on so on fire for Christ. And now certain circumstances come along and shake us down and cause our experience to be a little upset. Something is a little bit off. Just because we had an experience 10 years ago, that doesn't necessarily mean that everything is right tonight. I want to encourage us even while we're preaching, while we're talking about this, if there's anything in our life that we feel might hinder us from having the full revelation, having the full benefit of coming to the communion table, even now in our hearts, we can say, "Lord Jesus, just please forgive me. I I just want to be right with you." And you know, the moment that we do that in our hearts, even from our seat, he does it. He does forgive us. It gets put into the sea of his forgetfulness. We don't have to have an altar call. &gt;&gt; He knows where we are. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where we are. And not just our geographical location. He knows our spiritual location. &gt;&gt; Now, in the face of all of this, in the age that we're living in, what has it done to your eyes? Now, that's the question, not what it done to theirs. It's beautiful because we can see what it did to theirs. there. And I I think this is so interesting. This was just revealed to me as we were reading it tonight. You know, in verse 31 of Luke 24, and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight. It's beautiful. Their eyes were open and he they knew him. And they said one to another, "Did not our heart" They didn't say hearts. I've never seen that before and I'm sure maybe we all have seen it before. But it was heart, one heart &gt;&gt; knit together in love, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The unity of the spirit, the bond of peace, our heart. Didn't our heart burn within us as he spoke to us along the way. And you know, I can't help but think that's why we come to church. That's why we gather together in the name of Jesus Christ. So we can walk down the road further and further with him. so he can slowly reveal further and further to us who we are and what it's all about. But I love how brother Brandham says now that's the question, not what it done to theirs. Which side are you on tonight? &gt;&gt; Now you've got to be either associated with the Pharisees or associated with the apostles or the believers. Now it's done something for you. You're just up against it. It's done something. If if you'd been living in that day, what would you have uh done? What does your present state now identify you? Where does it where does it make you think of it? I love how brother Brandham brings this out in the message in many different places. He says, you know, if people talk about it, they say, well, if I was back there in the days of Jesus, well, if I was back there in the days of brother Brandham, he says, who you are today is exactly who you would have been there. &gt;&gt; If we're sitting with a critical spirit today, we would have a critical spirit yesterday &gt;&gt; and we'd have a critical spirit tomorrow. You know, that's the way it is. But if we're on the side of Jehovah tonight, that's exactly where we would have been then. If you'd been living in that day, what would you have done? What does your present state now identify you? Where does it make you think of it? &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, my church, that's what the Pharisees said." See, &gt;&gt; I want to say tonight, brothers and sisters, even now, if we have a different perspective, my desire, my heart's desire is that we would not be in that position of the Pharisee, that we would be able to say, "Be it unto me, Lord, according to your word. Open my eyes. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord Jesus. Let me be like those two that walked with you on the road to Emmas." Maybe my teaching, maybe my tradition, maybe something stopped me up to have my eyes closed. &gt;&gt; It's only because you allowed it to be that way. Oh, but you have the power to open them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the power to leave tonight with our eyes open. We don't have to leave here with our eyes closed. &gt;&gt; He says, "Are you ready to recognize Jesus Christ through the power of his resurrection? Oh my. Are you willing to forsake everything and walk with him? Are you ready to believe him? Taking his light and life to others. What has it done? As he has revealed it in these last days, he promised it. Now you say, brother Brandham, the Messiah was revealed then. I know the scripture said so. Well, that same Messiah is promised to reveal himself today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say, brothers and sisters, let's not just stop with the quote and say, 'Well, this is Brother Brad. I'm preaching in 1964, even though it is. &gt;&gt; He was told to store up food for a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we read this, I want to bring it right up out of history, right out of 1964, bring it up to 2025. Let's let's make him the present tense I am like he is. Let's recognize him for who he is. Well, that same Messiah is promised to reveal himself today. Same thing. Now, Hebrews 13:8, now listen, identifies him to be the same yesterday, today, and forever. John 14:8 said that he that believeth in me, see, the works that I do shall he do also. John 14:9. Here we find he said, "A little while, and the world order, cosmos won't know me anymore." They'll be totally blind. And we know that we live in a day that he's described right there. &gt;&gt; Jesus is a fairy tale for many people. Most people in this world, children growing up don't go to church. Why would you go to church, join a cult, and be brainwashed? Many times that's what people do. There's no desire to raise children in the fear of the Lord, but they'd be totally blind. He says, "They won't see me anymore. Then a little while they won't see me. Yet your eyes will be open for you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; So tonight, brothers and sisters, I just want to encourage us. What do we think about it tonight? &gt;&gt; When we take this communion table, when we partake of the bread, when we take of the wine, what do we think about it? because that makes all the difference. If we come and we do it just out of a duty, it's not going to give us the benefit that we need and and not just want but need. This is one of the three ordinances that was given to us by the prophet by the word. Water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, communion, and footwashing. The only three ordinances that we need to do led by the spirit. And when we do those being led by the spirit, we get the benefit of the spirit in our lives, in our families. And you know, brothers and sisters, as much as we say we know the message of the hour, I'll say this loud and clear. And I'm sure that we'll all be able to say a big hearty amen to it, you know, talk is cheap. Because unless we're doing the three things that God has instructed us to do, we are not applying the token. That's right. &gt;&gt; We can say it all we want, but the devil knows exactly where we stand. And when we come out and we show the devil whose side we're on, when we're willing to actually forsake all and follow him, we are truly applying the token. Applying the token isn't just saying that I believe. I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So now my family is saved because I believe. Even though it is our actions prove who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how can I say that? Jesus said, "You know them by their fruit." &gt;&gt; The lives in which we live demonstrate where we are. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you by experience, there's times in my life where I just couldn't come to a communion service because I wasn't right with the Lord. I didn't feel right. I had a wrong attitude. There's times where I didn't want to come to church because I had a bad attitude. Have you ever felt that? Or am I the only one? I felt that way at times I wouldn't come to church. But you know, brothers and sisters, we've got to fight the feelings. The prophet for our day said our feelings have nothing to do with it. The Holy Ghost is without sensation. We need to go against all of this flesh and come against it and actually push through so that we can actually see the full benefit of the word. Maybe tonight I'm going to stop right there. I'll invite the brothers to come forward. Call the brother Joel and we will begin with the communion service. We'll change the order of the service. Maybe if you want to just stand with me, we'll just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, tonight we just thank you, Lord, that we know that you you have the power to open our eyes and to close our eyes. And Father, tonight based on on that that statement, Father, I just pray that you would close our eyes to the things of the world. &gt;&gt; I pray that for our families, Lord Jesus, that you would help us to close our eyes to the things of the world. &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that you would help us, Lord, to open our eyes to the things of the Lord. that we would desire more of you &gt;&gt; than ever before. &gt;&gt; I just was thinking tonight before the service, Lord, that you know, as we we knew that those hostages were hanging in the balance and Father, as we prayed, we desired more than anything as every day that passed, we desired more and more that they would be released. And then there came a day, Lord, where they were released, &gt;&gt; answering the prayers. We thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, I can't help but think that one of these days the rapture of the church that you have chosen before the foundation of the world is going to be the same way. Oh, Father, we've prayed and prayed and prayed about it and one day it's just going to happen. And Father, I pray that our eyes would be open to that reality that we would be ready, Father, willing and able by your spirit, Father, by the oil in our lamps. We know that the shout has already gone forth that behold the bridegroom cometh. Get up and trim your lamps. It's already happened. Oh, Father. And that voice now is echoing through the bride. &gt;&gt; And one of these days, that door is going to be closed. And it won't be closed by man. It will be closed by you, Father. that church that put you on the outside, Father, you will go in and you will suck with them and you will close that door once and for all. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to be ready for that door to be closed behind us. Now tonight, Father, as we change the order of the service and we look to you, Father, for that body, that ordinance that you gave us, Lord Jesus, for your body that was broken and the blood that was spilled, Father, we pray that you would just, Lord, allow the full revelation, Lord Jesus, the full manifestation of the blessing of partaking in this service manifest in our lives, Lord. Father, we love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, I'd like to turn to First Corinthians. 1 Corinthians chapter 11. Start with verse 23. [Music] For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. [Music] And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Amen. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Shall we bow our hearts before him? Our Lord and King, our master and Savior. You've been everything to us. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and that is why we come together this evening in that all sufficient name, the name above all names, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We come to lift up your name and praise you. Yes, &gt;&gt; we can because we your children chosen from the foundation of the earth to fulfill your ordinance this day &gt;&gt; in an age where you are completely almost forgotten father. &gt;&gt; We are here to affirm once more &gt;&gt; that we know that our lord is alive &gt;&gt; that he's present this moment in this place &gt;&gt; because we have come according to your word. &gt;&gt; So Lord be merciful to us. Oh God, come and touch your children. Oh Lord, come and energize us. Come and quicken us, oh God, into what you're doing today, this day, this time, Father. Help us, oh Lord, to look forward, oh Lord, to the time and season when we've appear in your presence, oh God, to live forever. But now, Father, we came as a people with a testimony, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You called us. We were in a difficult situation. Well, while your bride called on you and here we are today celebrating your victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just want to say Lord, you are good &gt;&gt; all the time and we glorify your name. We exalt your name. We lift up your name, Father. But even as we go forth, oh Lord, we want to bless this bread that is being broken as a representation of your body because you blessed it the first time, oh Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to say forgive our mistakes as we can, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; and help us not to eat damnation onto our souls, but rather to come and receive all the blessings that come with it. &gt;&gt; May there be deliverance. May there be healing, oh Lord. May there be blessings upon blessings, oh Lord. May there be forgiveness of sins. May there be repentance, oh Lord. May there be every aspect of your way that we desire that we need in the body. Father, it's your body. You know it better than we do. Lord, &gt;&gt; so have your will, oh Lord, as we come forward in our feeble effort in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray over the wine, our most precious heavenly father. Once again, Father, this is an opportunity given to us to assemble here this evening for a communion service. Father, once again, we ask you to be part of this meeting. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh Lord, this is one of your ordinances that Lord you told us to do. And this evening, Father, as you said in your word, where two or three are gathered in your name, there you be. Father, tonight we believe that you are here with us dining with you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Father, we want to pray for each and everyone that made it this evening. And Father, in obedience to your word, came here this evening to partake this for this communion service. We ask you, Father, to bless us all together as we partake this. &gt;&gt; Father, this is the blood that is shed on Calvary. The blood that never loses its power. &gt;&gt; Father, as your children are going to file over here, Lord, we receive that blessing. Father, even those that could not make it here, Father, maybe they are working, maybe they are sick in their body, whatever reason, Lord, &gt;&gt; may you feed them as well. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to thank you. This is an opportunity. We might not be able to do this again. And so if we find it today doing this, Lord, we want to thank you. &gt;&gt; And father, we ask you to sanctify it for nourishment. The hands that are going to hold it, Lord, may you sanctify it as well. For in Jesus name that we pray over this wine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just start with folks over here. [Music]
