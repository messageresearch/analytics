Welcome to the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night midweek service for a spiritual recharge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Just want to remember Sister Mary Olerte, the Sarpong family, brother Asher Snow. All of them are afflicted with an illness in their body tonight. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you that we can come to [music] you, Lord. Father, that we can come to you in spirit and in truth, Father, in the day in which we live. Oh, Father, it's no cliche and we don't take it for granted, Lord. The covenant that we live under, Father, the age where you chose to express us, Lord, to be the recipients of your word. and not just the recipients but after receiving your word to literally [music] become your word to this age. Father, we recognize it and we thank you for that calling Lord and that election that you have placed within us. And tonight, Father, is not any different than any other service. We know that you're here, Father. We declared this service to be in your name &gt;&gt; already tonight. And Father, we're so thankful that you're here. And Lord, we just invite you to take your preeminence to walk up and down the aisles tonight, Father, Lord Jesus, up and down the seats tonight, Father, from heart to heart, from tabernacle to tabernacle, Lord, and search us, Father, and try us, Lord. And help us, Father, to find our way one more time, Lord. If there's things in our lives that hinders your spirit, Father, from being welcome, we pray that Lord, you would help us [music] to recognize it, Lord, that we would be able to get rid of it from our lives, Lord. That there wouldn't be a hindrance from your spirit, Lord, where you wouldn't just come, Lord, and and then go again in our lives, Father, but that you would come and seal us once and for all, oh Lord Jesus, that we would, Lord, see you the way that you want to be seen in this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to ask tonight, Lord, that you would forgive us for any sin in our lives, Lord. Any unbelief, Father, we pray that you would forgive us for it. And Lord, any iniquity in our hearts, please take it out of the way, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, let us approach you tonight with a clean heart, Father. Lord, that you could do something with us. As our brother already prayed, [music] it's one thing to come and speak, but it's another thing to be able to listen. We heard it on the weekend. Father, give us ears to hear. Oh, Father, we heard it in the Bible study this morning. Let us lend an ear to you, Father. Oh, Lord Jesus, that we could hear what your spirit has to say. Father, we just want to remember each and every need that was made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand. We commit them sovereignly into your hands, Lord. And we'll be careful to give you the praise for answering our prayers because we know that we won't ask a miss if we ask according to your will. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, that's the way we present our needs tonight, &gt;&gt; not to consume them upon the lust of our lives, Lord. And Father, tonight we pray that you would be glorified [music] in each and every testimony as they come forward. &gt;&gt; Father, we want to pray for Brother Asher Snow tonight, Lord, that you would minister unto him. &gt;&gt; We want to pray for the Sarong family entirely, Lord. Sister Helen, Brother Emanuel, oh Father, Sister Chloe, Brother Benny, and Brother Andy. Lord, we pray that [music] you would just send by their way a healing touch tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; Even now while we speak, we pray for each one, the Sarong, the olares, oh Father, in the snows. Lord, we know that you're more than able and we thank you for just touching them now in the name of Jesus. Father, tonight now as we turn to your word, we pray that you would continue to be worshiped, Father. &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't just end at the song service, Father, that you would just allow us to worship you tonight in spirit and in truth, Father, all the way to the very end. And even as we go home tonight, Father, as we travel, maybe when we lay our head on the pillow, oh, Father, let our last breath be worship to you tonight as we fall asleep. And Lord, let our dreams be worship unto you, Father. Lord, let it be the first word that we speak when we wake up in the morning. Pure worship in spirit and in truth, Lord. Father, you've caused us to be here in this time so that we can worship you, Father. Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank you for that revelation of worship tonight. We just commit this service into your hands now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians one more time for putting your shoulders to the wheel. &gt;&gt; We just want to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 12 again tonight as we continue on with our study about gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. We sure had a busy weekend this weekend and we certainly are thankful to have been able to feast on the word. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse one says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You [snorts] know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. And we know that it's not just saying that Jesus is the Lord but living as Jesus is the Lord. It means surrendering one's entire being, one's entire will is the only way that we can call him Lord. And the only way that happens is by the Holy Ghost in our lives. &gt;&gt; Now, there are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which workketh all in all. And and I just as I'm reading this, I think it's beautiful because it doesn't say now there are diversities of opinions. It doesn't say that. Verse six says, "And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which workketh all in all. But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. For for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit, to another faith by the same spirit, to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit. to another working of miracles. To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally, as he will. Amen. &gt;&gt; For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, so also is Christ. &gt;&gt; For by one spirit, are we all baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member but many. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the many membered body that you have given &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. And we know this many membered body isn't just Lord exclusive to this age. It's not just exclusive to this church assembly here. Oh father, it's to all of the ages. And Father, we thank you that it is exclusive to every single one of the items that we've mentioned, Father. That it is to be operational even in this congregation, Father, according to your prophet. And Lord, we know that's your word. So we just take it the way that you've given it. And Lord, we commit the reading of this word into your hands one more time tonight that you would bless it. Father, break it open to us fresh once again. we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. We're certainly thankful to have brother Dodie and his family here with us tonight. They had quite an episode on the weekend and I didn't realize it until after. They didn't come to service. They were on their way to service here on Sunday and they pulled over on the side of the road and had to call an ambulance for Sister Leia. They I guess encountered food poisoning over the weekend and uh I don't know how many in the family were sick but it sounds like most if not all somehow got food poisoning and that is not a pretty picture. Food poisoning is a very painful event and uh we're certainly thankful that the Lord's answered prayer and that you're able to be here to fellowship with us tonight. So God bless you. We uh just have one announcement tonight. I think it's really good. Um what we've decided to do is start posting the announcements uh just on the chat. So if you want to be able to refer back, you can just look at your chat and scroll back and and see it. And uh if there's something happening that's uh maybe not been announced, we'll try and put it there so there is a point of reference. But all of the things that are happening um are on the calendar as well for reference and that's on the website if you do have any questions. Um certainly thankful to be here tonight. It's been a bit of a different week changing gears in the weather. We now have uh winter upon us. Certainly thankful for today though. It felt like a little bit of a shinook happening. It just wasn't that cold and the snow was starting to melt. But I saw the forecast is calling for more snow and more cold. So, here we go. I think uh I think we're in for it now. But, you know, it's the season for it, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's just the way it is. Uh we have to go through the seasons of life and we have to go through the seasons on earth here as well. We uh certainly enjoyed the services on the weekend with brother Cadre and uh you know there's so many so many points that were so so good. I just really appreciate it and uh appreciate the ministry of the the brother cadre. He's gone through a lot and uh certainly thank the Lord for how he's using him and you know I I believe so much. I just couldn't say amen enough, you know, with the the spirit and the truth that we've been given the Saturday night service and to understand that spiritual revelation of worship is something that is just it's just you can't even put words to it to think about our lives. Even every part of our lives is a revelation of worship. When we catch the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in the age of which we live, when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives, it is not just an anointing. It's literally the life of Jesus living out through us. And and that's where we can say that we do become the word. And and we don't make excuses for our old self. We want to see our old self die. You know, when we start making excuses for the old self, we're saying that he's not powerful enough to actually change this guy. We're saying that our old self is more powerful than almighty God. And brother Brandham said it. We know he said it under anointing and the invisible union of the bride. I always say this, but I'll say it again. Every single speck of the old man has to die. And tonight, I want to say it with conviction to each and every one of us. We've got to see that happen. To make excuses is it's making excuses. And I want to say this, we're we're looking for a copout when we're making excuses. And and you know, brothers and sisters, if we haven't seen that change in our lives, it doesn't mean it won't happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is happening. Every single time we come to church, every single time we gather together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, something happens. We either grow or we shrink, but we do not remain the same. &gt;&gt; And it's so beautiful because it can be just like a little child. a little child when they when they are with their parents and maybe they go and see a great auntie and they haven't seen her for so many years, maybe months or years, and and the last time that she saw them, they were this tall and and they get together and and now they're this tall and and the child probably doesn't feel any taller. And the parents that see them every single week, they're like, "Yeah, that's exactly how they are. They haven't changed that much." But the person that hasn't really seen them says, "Wow, look at the change in your life. you've grown so much. When it happens in our lives, sometimes we don't recognize it because it's so gradual. &gt;&gt; It's not always a thunderbolt experience in our lives, but it doesn't mean it's not happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we got to remember to not get weary with welloing. &gt;&gt; When we come to church on a Wednesday night, for example, and it feels like nothing's happening, Brother Barry's just going to go on about the gifts again. Going to talk about faith some more, read some more quotes. That's just the devil talking. and tell them to get lost and say, "Be it unto me according to your word, Lord. Somehow, some way, you could say something to me if I get out of the way and allow you to move." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom said that these gifts should be in the body and every single sovereign church &gt;&gt; should be these gifts. &gt;&gt; So, that's why I'm so encouraged to talk about them. I just felt so so driven to to really get into them, to dig into them, because we're not seeking signs. What I want to do is help create a level of faith inside of us that we are not afraid of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if we have fear about these gifts, we've got another spirit. &gt;&gt; There's another spirit operating in our life if we're afraid of gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a pretty heavy thing to say, but I think it's 100% true. &gt;&gt; And I would be very interested in having a conversation if somebody sees it differently. I I'm not looking to combat, but what I do want to do is kick the devil out. &gt;&gt; I don't want the devil having any power in the congregation. We only want to see the Lord Jesus Christ reigning supreme in our midst. &gt;&gt; But if there's fear, it's not God &gt;&gt; because his word says that I've not given you the spirit of fear. I've given you the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that we can comprehend these things, &gt;&gt; not be afraid of them. Yes. &gt;&gt; And remember, brother Brandham said, "Where there's scarecrows, what should we do?" Anybody remember what what we should do? He said, "You should go right in behind that scarecrow and start eating because that's where the good food is. That's where the good fruit is." The scarecrow is there to scare us away. But we're not crows, are we? &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about scarecrows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking about the gifts in the body, I just think it's beautiful. They should be in every single sovereign assembly. We've read that quote many times. Not going to read it tonight. Tonight I'm I'm supercharged by Perfect Faith 1963. If you want to just see where this is coming from, just listen to Perfect Faith. We're talking about faith tonight. We've talked about wisdom. We've talked about knowledge. Tonight we're talking about faith. I'm probably not going to dwell too much longer on faith because I do want to get through the gifts. I want to talk about them. But we'll see that these gifts will pop up, I think, in the future uh services as as the Lord leads. I think it's just wonderful as we study these things. And you know, I I just won't be surprised at all when we start seeing these things in our midst. I always wondered about it how you could see some maybe evangelists or some ministers who maybe somehow someway people just get healed when they get around them. Maybe they have a prayer line and and something happens and and people get healed. You know, there's a gift of healing and and that gift of healing is placed in a person's life sovereignly as the Lord wills. It's not up to us to say I I'm not going to say that every one of us should have every one of these gifts in our lives. I think in fact, it's the contrary. We probably just have maybe a portion of or the solid amount of a specific gift in our lives. And and that's just the way it is. They're all members of the body. And that's what makes up the body is the many members. And you know, you can't have a body, we can't have a body without a heart, right? &gt;&gt; We can't have a body without lungs, without a spleen, without a liver. Um, you can go without two kidneys. You can have just one kidney, but you know, we got to have a brain. There's things that we need to have in order to be a complete body or it just doesn't work. I I just thought it was wonderful as we were reading this tonight. You know, it just came to me that there's diversities of gifts, but the same spirit. And there's differences of administrations and there's diversities of operations, but there's no differences of opinion &gt;&gt; when it comes to this because it's the self-same spirit. And how can you tell if if if it is the right spirit? It's going to line up with the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's why I think we don't have to have any fear. here. And I want to encourage us to remember this. We don't have to fear gifts because it is the spirit of God. It will always be according to his word. &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; That's why if we surrender ourselves to the word of God, we've got nothing to fear. &gt;&gt; But now I'll say this. If we're living a double life, if we've just got that thing we're just not willing to get rid of, eventually it's going to come to the surface. We can't escape it. But when it does, what do we do with it? That's the difference between a believer and an unbeliever. A believer is going to say, "I'm sorry. Forgive me, Lord. I know that I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Will you forgive me? It's this thing that I just feel like I can never seem to get over." But the unbeliever or the makebeliever is going to be like, "I'm just fine. What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with me. It's you." But remember, when we start pointing, there's still three fingers pointing right back at us, right? &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we know where we stand. &gt;&gt; If we have the same spirit, it's going to line up exactly with God's word. And and if, like I said, we're not actually lining up with the word of God. If we are a believer, we will line up with the word of God. Tonight, I want to talk about faith and and how faith how vital faith is in the life of a believer. Faith is it's like our spiritual blood &gt;&gt; because without faith it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; Without blood it's impossible to live. &gt;&gt; We can't get oxygen to ourselves without blood. &gt;&gt; We have to have faith. &gt;&gt; It's the substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; I've got a bunch of quotes tonight I'm going to get into that brother Brandham mentions in this in this message and I think it's just so beautiful the way he says it. You know, it's the person of the Holy Ghost that we're talking about. That's that's what faith is. The person of the Holy Ghost because how could any human being ever just believe in God's word? No human being on their own could ever just believe in God's word. It takes more than that to just believe in God's word. People could say they believe in God's word, but when it comes to actually changing how we live our lives, it's a different story altogether to be able to believe and live the word of God. &gt;&gt; But it becomes the person of the Holy Ghost living through us, mighty Jehovah, Jesus Christ. It's not another spirit. And sometimes it's it's kind of presented in a way that it's some other spirit, but it's not another spirit. It's the same self, same spirit as we've read in this scripture. You know, out of perfect faith, brother Brandham, he talks about complete faith and he talks about mature faith. And I believe that that is what exactly what perfect faith, the title of this sermon, is actually speaking about. It's speaking about a faith that is complete because perfection in the Bible talks about completion. That is the definition of mature of of perfect is is complete and and mature faith. So tonight I just want to mention brother Brandham. He speaks about faith in titles of messages 44 times in the message. There's faith included in the title and and I just thought perfect faith fits it. I mean, if we were if I was to take and preach on on faith just in terms of the titles, sermon titles, we would probably have two or three years worth of material to go through. And and I just I don't want to do that. I don't want to keep us stuck on one part of it. There's there's many gifts in the body, and I want to be able to just try and go through and study a bit and and learn and just bring some encouragement to the body. But if you want to maybe just listen to perfect faith in 1963 if you have the time. It's it's pretty good. It's pretty good. You know, brother Brandham in this message he talks about Mark 11:22 to 26. I'm just going to read out of perfect faith here. He says, "Now faith is based, I love this. This is the very first quote. Faith is based on forgiveness. Faith is based on forgiveness. Can you believe that? It's based on forgiveness. That's the foundation of faith &gt;&gt; is forgiveness. So if we got unforgiveness in our lives, if we've got something where someone has hurt us in our lives and we're just holding on to it and we're not willing to forgive that person, do we have faith? I don't think so. We we might have an intellectual faith, but we're not talking about intellectual faith. You'll see what brother Brandham talks about that. We're talking about perfect faith, complete faith, mature faith. He says, "Now faith is based on forgiveness then." And then, as we said this morning, trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us. Who doesn't want to see apostolic times moving among us? Praise. &gt;&gt; Now, some people might say, "Well, that was with brother Brandham back in 1963 and he was a prophet and he held an office and the angel told him with his commission that if you pray and you get the people to believe that not even cancer will stand in the way of your prayers." And that was just for him. If that's what we're thinking, then we've missed the mark. &gt;&gt; We've completely missed the mark because we are the recipients of his message. Amen. &gt;&gt; His message wasn't even his message. &gt;&gt; His message IS GOD'S MESSAGE FOR THE BRIDE TO BRING MATURITY, COMPLETENESS. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, the faith faith is based on forgiveness then. And then, as we said this morning, trying to get the church to a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us. That's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door. We see it, but we want to see more of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to see, we want it such a flow that it'll be a help to us. &gt;&gt; Help us flow out to others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because remember what he said in the message, eternal life is living for others, &gt;&gt; not living for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Mark 11. Faith is based upon forgiveness. Mark chapter 11. Mark 11. Mark 11 22. And Jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, can you imagine? He says, "Have faith in God." Jesus says, "Have faith in God." And then God begins to speak to them. God says, "Have faith in God." &gt;&gt; For verily I say unto you, let's not put this off on a second person of Jesus or a third person of Jesus. Let's put this right back on. The author of these words, we could say, God answering saith unto them, "Have faith in me. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass. He shall have whatever he saith. Therefore, I say unto you, what things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. &gt;&gt; It's so beautiful because that's where we live, right? Verse 25. And when ye stand praying, what? &gt;&gt; Forgive. When you stand praying, it doesn't say exercise faith. It doesn't say do any spiritual work. It says forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you stand praying, forgive. If ye have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. &gt;&gt; Amen. How will he know your trespasses? Because he knows our heart. &gt;&gt; All things are naked before him is his word. &gt;&gt; We can fool ourselves and say, "I've I've dealt with I've put it under the blood." We talked about this years ago. I thought it was so good. Sometimes we do that in our lives. We'll go and we'll actually say, "Lord, forgive me for doing that. I said that about that person." Or, "I did that to that person. Just forgive me, Lord." And and we just put it under the blood. But what we do is we actually we take it and we just put it under the rug. We put it under the rug because Jesus said if you've got a problem with a person, go to that person. &gt;&gt; Just making it right with him, it doesn't make it right. &gt;&gt; And we know that brother Bradam told the story of the woman that wanted Brother Bradom to fix her problem. And and he said, "What do you want?" And she said, "I got this problem and I don't know what to do about it." And he said, "Well, you cheated on your husband. That's your problem. Go tell him that you cheated on him." And she said, "There's no way. Don't you dare tell anybody that." Blah, blah, blah. She got all angry and indifferent. He said, "Good. I'm glad I could help. Have a nice day." And he went next door. And she started lamenting and screaming, "Oh, you didn't fix my problem." Well, it's not up to him to fix the problem in the first place, but he told her how you can fix your problem. Go tell your husband you cheated on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't do that on my Sunday school. All the stuff, right? &gt;&gt; Humanity gets in the way sometimes of our our pleading, our desire to to seek forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That pride, oh my, that pride. But you know, it took a prophet to actually come to the place where he could tell this woman. And you know, that was an example for us in our lives, for us to recognize that, you know, we might think that maybe we're squeaky clean and there's nothing wrong in our lives, but I guarantee you, brothers and sisters, we've all got blind spots. &gt;&gt; Everything before God is naked. Don't let pride get in the way of our forgiveness. &gt;&gt; But it took a prophet of God to tell her, just go tell him because he's got the same thing to tell you. Does he have a secretary? Does she wear this kind of dress? Do they drive this kind of car? Were they parked IN THIS LOCATION? GO ASK THEM. It's based on forgiveness. And what happened when they got it out of the way between them? Then they could go to God and get on with things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. He knows our hearts. We're not going to hide. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 26 says, "But if you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses." And you know, brothers and sisters, I'll say this. There's things that happen in life that can't be taken back. There's things that happen in life that are shattering to people, to human beings. And sometimes people will rather worship that problem than actually say, "Lord, take it from me. &gt;&gt; Take it from me, Lord. How could someone how could someone for example I know we all have problems. We all have situations in our lives. But how could a mother actually go into a courtroom and and forgive a man that actually willfully killed her son? He deliberately killed her son. How could a woman go into a courtroom and actually say, "I forgive you." to the man that actually killed her son. Now, we can back up and say, "Well, there's many different things that I've got in my life, problems in my life, hurts in my life, and you know, I just don't seem to be able to let go of those hurts, and I'm just going to hold on to those hurts because they hurt." And you don't know how bad they hurt me. How bad did Christ get hurt? &gt;&gt; How bad was his hurt? No man has ever been hurt like he's been hurt. &gt;&gt; But yet, he's got forgiveness for us for every single shortcoming and blind spot in our lives. He'll take it and throw it into the sea of his what? &gt;&gt; But we want to hold on to those things in our life because someone really did us wrong. They really hurt us bad. So we've got license now, right? No, we don't. What does that? I'll tell you what does that. Pride does that. &gt;&gt; That's a spirit of pride. &gt;&gt; Just rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and allow that forgiveness to come into your life. Because faith, if we want to see this kind of faith, like gifts in the body faith, like rapturing faith, like bodychanging faith, like we want to see in our lives, then we've got to be willing to forgive every single transgression that comes against us. &gt;&gt; Everyone. Everyone without exception. There's no exceptions. I think it's beautiful, brother Brandham. He says this, "Faith is based on forgiveness." Then my &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say in the message, "Now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith, not just faith of the fathers, even though that's what this message did, right? It turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. We probably still haven't gotten totally into that yet, and I'm going to, Lord willing." What is that? That's actually going right back to the book of Acts. Right back to the book of Acts. the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles. Not the acts of the apostles like the world teaches. It's the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles, fully surrendered vessels. Now, we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith, perfect faith. That's a great thing. Now, faith, we're told in the Bible, faith cometh by hearing. Now, you cannot be saved without faith. Isn't that amazing? You can't be saved without faith. I can't be saved without faith. And faith is something that you have to believe it's there. That really nothing else will declare it's there but faith. That's exactly what drives us to go across the city in the winter to be in service on a Wednesday night to hear the word of God. We can't explain it. You can't necessarily hand it to someone and say, "This is what I'm going to do. You You got to go see for yourself. &gt;&gt; That's faith. That God will do something for me." &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's so beautiful because we've heard it said in the past that it's not always about what God will do for me. Remember, eternal life is living for others. And sometimes going to service might not be for us. It might be for your brother. It might be for your sister &gt;&gt; because they'll see that you're there. And the devil's working hard on them to make them think, "Why are you going to church? Why are you wasting your gas? Why are you going to do this?" Blah, blah, blah. You could be doing so many other different things. You could be doing a business deal where you're actually really making good money, but instead you're going to church again. But your brother, your sister are going to look over and see that you're there, and they're going to say, "Amen. &gt;&gt; There's my brother. There's my sister. We're locked arm in arm marching onto Zion because it's what we do every week. We get together and worship. &gt;&gt; The next quote he says, "Now faith, he that cometh to God must believe that he is." &gt;&gt; We have to believe that he is not was or will be is. It's so beautiful. Brother Brandham talks about it so many times in the message. We can be busy thinking about what he's going to do in the future and looking back to what he's done in the past and a tremendous prophet's life. and first and second pole ministries and all the wonder wonderful signs and wonders that happened but ignoring what he's doing right now &gt;&gt; missing what he's doing right now &gt;&gt; now faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is and it's impossible to please God without faith you cannot please him and if you say you believe God you have never seen him see So then you've got to believe it by faith. &gt;&gt; And if you could see him, it would be no more faith. See, &gt;&gt; isn't that interesting? &gt;&gt; If we could see him, it would be no more faith. &gt;&gt; Because our senses have nothing to do with it. I love how Brother Brandham brings this out because many times we could get into a worship service and we could sense something so tremendous in here, but that's not it. &gt;&gt; It is, but it's not all of it. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's only a little portion of it. We can fall under the anointing of the Holy Spirit falling in a service. We sing, "Holy Spirit, rain down." Guess what? He comes where he's invited. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then if we're not sealed, that anointing is just going to lift and we're going to walk out of the building the same way or even worse than when we came in. &gt;&gt; He says if you've never seen him, see, so then you've got to believe it by faith. And if you could see him, it would no more be faith. See, anything that senses declares is no more faith. &gt;&gt; It's scientific fact. See, it's no more faith. That one actually I had to stop and rewind and play and just press pause and just ponder cuz how many times in our life do we see things? Do we sense things? Do we feel things? Do we even think things that are about our lives? And and we wonder what's going on. I I think it's amazing when we look at this. Anything that senses declares. Now remember, we've got earthly senses. We've been given senses so that we can contact this world. See, taste, feel, smell, and hearing. Right? &gt;&gt; The five outer senses are so that we can contact this world. Now, there's five inner senses, too. Reasoning, consciousness, memory, I can't remember the other ones. &gt;&gt; Affection. One more &gt;&gt; imagination. &gt;&gt; Imagination. Five of them. So that we can contact ourselves and one another. But none of those actually declare faith. Only faith declares faith. &gt;&gt; And that's where we have to say that faith is a person, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost in our lives. &gt;&gt; But if our senses can contact it, then it's just science. I I found that to be real fascinating. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bradomy says, "Now, here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not." See, and and that's where I said a while ago, years ago even, and I think it's really important for us to to remember, brothers and sisters, is that we cannot we need to remember it can be very easy to mistake the message of the hour for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; To say that I understand that God sent a prophet to the age in which we live. I understand there's church age messengers. I understand that there's gifts in the body. I understand I'm a part of the assembly, but not go all the way and surrendering our lives to allowing him to be Lord in our lives like the scripture said that we read about tonight. When we do that, what happens is we we actually confuse the message of the hour with the Holy Ghost in our life. And and it's not actually going to give us the results that we're looking for. But brother Bradomy says, "Now, here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not." See, it's not an emotion. They don't believe it. It's it's not imagination. It's not imagination. It's not an emotion. It's not a sense. It's not a feeling that we get. It's not something that we can tangibly relate to. The only way that we can tangibly relate to faith is by the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's the only way we can tangibly relate to faith. And you know, brothers and sisters, that's why the prophet said the only true evidence of the Holy Ghost in our lives is to be able to say amen to the word for our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To say that I've got a teaching from a seminary. I've got some sort of tradition or something something something other than what the prophet taught is going to not actually lead us in the right direction. But I think this is just a notable quote here. He says, "Now, here's where people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for. I say, Lord, help us to receive what we need for healing. Help us to receive what we're asking for." Because they take faith to be something that it's not. See, now remember, Brother Brandham said earlier in this message that faith is based on something. It's based on forgiveness. And if the devil can get us to keep something in our life that's just not forgiven, guess what? Our faith is paralyzed. &gt;&gt; We've got faith maybe, but it's not what it should be. &gt;&gt; It's a growth that's stunted in our lives. And I I just want you to know my heart tonight. I'm not trying to to throw off on us. I'm not trying to scold us. What I'm trying to do IS KICK THE DEVIL OUT OF us &gt;&gt; because the devil's going to try and maintain a stronghold in our life and say, "You don't know how bad I've been hurt. It doesn't matter how bad we've been hurt. There's forgiveness for it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think that faith will actually take that hurt away. We we have the ability to have freedom and liberty from the hurts in our lives. &gt;&gt; We've all suffered hurts &gt;&gt; in varying degrees. And like I said, sometimes the hurts can never ever be fixed. Never. Naturally speaking, we could go to to years of counseling and a a a human counselor is never going to fix us. Never. They'll tell us how to cope with it. &gt;&gt; But there is one that will fix us. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one that will fix us will teach us to actually take it ourselves &gt;&gt; and not put it in our sea of forgetfulness, but give it to him and let him put it in his sea of forgetfulness. And guess what happens when that happens, brothers and sisters? It starts to leave our imagination and our memory. It starts to fade away. And the devil's going to come back. We've talked about it in the past many times. The devil's going to come and shake that jar of memories and say, "Don't you remember what this person did TO YOU? HOW HOW HURT YOU ARE, how how terrible it was in your life, and you can say, "No, it's dealt with. No, I know I put it under the blood." How do I know? Because I've forgiven that person, and I don't have auntu against that person anymore. When I think about them, I don't have that oy feeling that comes up or used to. Anyways, something new has taken place. And that truly is faith. That truly is the person of Jesus Christ. So, I just want to encourage us if we've got anything that's that's maybe not dealt with, anything that's maybe not forgiven, let's just examine our lives and find that forgiveness. Let him find that forgiveness for us. Let him search us and try us and bring that out of our lives. He'll take it out of our lives. And I can tell you by experience, brothers and sisters, if we're willing to give it to him, if we're willing to surren, if we're willing to take him at his word and just go to that person and submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God, even if that other person has nothing to do with it, if they won't accept it, if they completely reject it, we can stand before God and say, "Lord, I took you at your word. Your word said to do that, and I went and did that, and they wouldn't recognize your word, but I know you do." &gt;&gt; Amen. guarantee you he will come on your scene maybe in a greater way than he would with people on both ends. But when you're dealing with believers, he's going to work on both ends. He's not just going to leave one person out to dry. It doesn't work that way. That's the self-same spirit that we're talking about tonight. &gt;&gt; Now, we have the prophet saying in the next quote here, he says, "Now listen close. See, it's not what you imagine. Faith is not what you imagine." Remember I said if you want a a fun exercise just type in faith is not in the message and see what the hits are. Listen close. He says see it's not what you imagine. It's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else. &gt;&gt; Now it sounds almost contradictory. It almost sounds confusing because wait a second how are we supposed to understand this? The prophet explains it in this message. If we just take the time to listen, he says, "Listen close." It's not what we imagine. It's not our imagination. It's maybe not what we think. And that's what I want to encourage us to tonight, brothers and sisters. It's the person of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost in our lives. It's just as real to you. And I'll say it this way. He is just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just as real as my eyes says. This is a piece of paper. Faith. It's just as real as my eyes says it and my my fingers feel it and and I can hear it with my ears, but it's not like our senses. It sounds very confusing. what I what I believe he's saying. I'm not going to say this is what he means, but my understanding of it is it becomes that completely real to us. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's why we've come tonight because nobody could have talked us. Uh oh, don't go to church tonight. Don't bother wasting your time driving across the city burning your gas. You could just stay home by a nice warm fire, have a cup of coffee or or cocoa by the fire and just just be nice and warm and comfortable in your chair. You don't have to do that. Nobody's going to talk you OUT OF IT. WHY NOT? Because of faith. &gt;&gt; There's faith inside of us. And we can't explain it. We can't I can't dig in my pocket and pull out my faith and show you my faith. But I can show you my works. &gt;&gt; And by my works, you're going to see my faith. &gt;&gt; That's why I think it's so interesting in our lives. You know, many times people say they believe, but their works actually betray them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now listen close. See, it's not what you imagine. It's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else. It's just as real as my eye says. This is a piece of paper. Just as real as to say that is a light. It's just as real as to say I feel my coat. Just as real as I hear that baby talking there or making its noise. See, just that real as music playing. It's just as real as I taste anything in my mouth. It's that real. Only you can't show it to somebody else. &gt;&gt; You have it alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's yours. And that's the way it is, brothers and sisters. It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; It's completely against reason. It's completely unexplainable. But yet it's 100% true in our lives. But I think in our teaching tonight, I just want to get that I want to get that underlined and underpinned in our lives. If we want to see faith according to the word of God, then we've got to be willing to forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we're not, then I don't believe we have real faith according to the word. He says, "You have it alone." Amen. It's yours. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that faith is a revelation and revelations come from God. We heard it so good on this on on Sunday. I believe it was Cain and Abel. &gt;&gt; The revelation that Cain had and the revelation that Abel had. Cain never had the revelation that Abel had. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So beautiful that it was blood. But even God, the God that we serve, the same God, he's so kind and long-suffering, would come and say to Cain, "If you would just do like your brother, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he didn't have faith. He didn't have anything in his heart to mix with that word when it came from God &gt;&gt; to do anything about it. In fact, what happened was it actually brought out his true colors and demonstrated who his father was. Brother Brandham says it's that real only. You can't show it to somebody else. You have it alone. Amen. It's yours. Faith is not is faith is the substance. See, not just a myth. So many people come. He says, "Now these are real deep lessons. These are real deep lessons. And I'll catch the top of it, then you dig down into it." &gt;&gt; I love the way he says this. So it's and and who's he saying that to? I would say this. Anyone that hears his voice, &gt;&gt; anyone that listens to this tape. &gt;&gt; It's not just up to the ministers. It's not just up to the deacons. It's not the song leaders. It's anybody. These are real deep lessons. And I catch the top of it than you dig down into it. See, I think it's just amazing to think that there's more for us to dig down into. Isn't there? Isn't that amazing to think about? There's more for us to dig down into. Verse 26 of Mark 11. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. Amazing scripture to think about because we know that there's a book of records. There's a book of records that's taken place. And uh the book that we are in, I want to encourage us tonight to recognize our book is the book of the life of the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And our names were put in there before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And there is a book of record that's being written by everybody's life. But when it comes to the rapture of the church, those ones with perfect, mature, complete faith, that that book of records, it just disappears &gt;&gt; because we transform into a brand new body. We transform into a brand new realm. We move into that theophony body that Christ gave us that he made for us before the foundation of the world. The character that he has worked out in our lives, molding it to perfect faith, which puts us in the rapture condition gives us the ability to no longer need to look at a judgment scale on earth. There's no name written in a book of the works. The book of life is not pertaining to the bride of Jesus Christ. Brother goes on to say in this message, notice it's something that you possess. It's actually a possession of ours. It's a revelation. This faith is a revelation of a person in our lives. And and he says, notice it's something that you possess, not imagination. If you really have it, it's just as real to you as any other thing that could be. And I want to encourage us tonight to celebrate this, brothers and sisters. If we have this faith in our lives, there's something that constrains us to come to church. There's something that constrains us to pray for one another. There's something that constrains us to want to get together and worship the King of Kings. That is faith. And it's not something that's an imagination if you really have it. It's just as real to you as any other thing could be. And that's why it's so beautiful. There ain't nobody that's ever going to be able to talk a true believer out of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; They're going to say, "Well, you know, you're a heretic the way that you worship. you don't believe in the trinitarian spirit. And we'll say, "Yeah, that's exactly right." Just like Paul said, the way that you call heresy, that's how I worship the King of Kings and Lord of Lords because I've got faith. And without faith, it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; It's something that you possess. It's not imagination if you really have it. It's just as real to you as any other thing that could be. just as real as you know that you're riding in your automobile. And I remember hearing it said many times when I was a young Christian coming to the message church. It's like turning the key over in your car. We have to have a certain level of faith, don't we? To believe that it's going to start. &gt;&gt; Sometimes with some vehicles, we have to have just a little more faith. We have to have just a little more prayer. M maybe trust the Lord a little bit more. But other times we just come out groggy in the morning and it's cold and dark and we just turn the key and it starts and we drive away. That's faith. It's just as real as you know that you're sitting in the church. &gt;&gt; Just as real as you know that you're sitting in the church. &gt;&gt; Just as real as we know that we're here tonight. &gt;&gt; That's what faith is. There's no way that we could ever really do it justice trying to explain what faith is. I know it, but I think it's so good. I just want to say it this way. If somebody asked me, "What's faith in in in the Bible?" One of the gifts of faith in in First Corinthians there, I would simply say this. It's being able to believe the word. &gt;&gt; It's being able to believe the word and saying, "Be it unto me." Just like Mary did to the angel messenger, "Be it unto me according to thy word." If there's a word for this age, I want it. I want it all because it's going to do something for me. That's what faith is. That is a summary from brother Barry about what faith is. But brother Brandham says just as real as you know that you're setting in the church. Just as real as you hear my voice, it is a substance, not an imagination, not an emotion, but something that you have. And it comes to you by hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that only. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It doesn't come by a faith seminar. It doesn't come by a faith retreat. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come by counseling. It doesn't come by doing things other than what the word says. It only comes by hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that only faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That puts it back to where your faith then is not in some individual. This is where it gets tight. This is where it really gets deep. I'm glo glossing over this stuff. But it's really important, brothers and sisters. We can get caught up with believing in the gifts and saying that there's a specific brother somewhere and if he prays for me, then I know I'm going to get my healing because he's got a gift of healing. And outside of that, I don't know, man. If we do that, what we do is we take away the faith that we have in our lives &gt;&gt; and we're putting it in an individual &gt;&gt; because it's not the individual that does the healing, is it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is it? &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's some great evangelists and they've got some great gifts, but who does the healing? &gt;&gt; It's God. &gt;&gt; It's only God. It's only ever been God. Even with William Brandham, WHO DID THE HEALING? HE ALWAYS SAID ON THE STAGE, now don't worry. &gt;&gt; You feel that presence, don't you? &gt;&gt; Right? He would say that because the angel of the Lord himself &gt;&gt; descended with a SHOUT AND STOOD BESIDE HIM RIGHT THERE on stage &gt;&gt; to back up his word. &gt;&gt; Because he had faith. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God. That puts it back to where your faith then is not in some individual. It's not in a man. Brothers and sisters, if you put your faith in a man, what will happen is God will allow that man to fall &gt;&gt; because he will not share his glory with anyone. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's what's h it's totally what's going to happen if we wind up putting all of our faith in a man. That's what will happen. Don't put your faith in Brother Barry, please. I I [laughter] have a hard enough time as it is. But that's the way it works. That's how it is. Faith cometh by hearing. Hearing the word of God. That puts it back to where your faith then is not in some individual. And that's what we want to see. That's what I want to see is for us to have robust faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The kind of faith that puts hair on your chest. Brother Brandham said the kind of faith that actually devils are afraid of &gt;&gt; where they recognize there's something different. We know that. We heard it on Sunday. So good. So good. 12 legions of devils recognized the spirit that was inside Jesus that was backing up Jesus. All of the religious folks in the day couldn't though, could they? They called him Beelzebub. They said he was a devil himself. &gt;&gt; But all the devils, they knew exactly who he was. &gt;&gt; And I think it's exactly the same way with a believer. They don't want nothing to do with a true believer. Listen to adoption. Brother Brandham talks about it in there. He says it very clearly. The devil won't want nothing to do with you if you truly are an adopted son or daughter of God. If you've truly been filled and sealed with his Holy Ghost, he's taken us out and shown to all the world, even the devils, this is my beloved son. My spirit is in him and my seal is set upon him and nobody will be able to change that. He says that puts it back to where your faith then is not in some individual. It's not in a man &gt;&gt; and it's not in an organization. &gt;&gt; We can't say because I belong to the message of the hour because I believe in the message of the hour that I'm saved. If we are a part of the message of the hour and we do believe the message of the hour, then we'll do what the message of the hour said, &gt;&gt; we'll actually go on to the full baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will become sons and daughters, fully adopted sons and daughters of God. That's what he's calling for in the age in which we live. That's what the message is for. To turn the hearts of the children back to the &gt;&gt; faith of the Pentecostal fathers, &gt;&gt; not to just say that I'm a part of an organization, so it's all good. No, we've got some questions for questions and answers. And it's very specifically about what I just mentioned about going on to be fully adopted sons and daughters of God about getting the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. About recognizing where we are and and how it's not an organization. It's not in a group of people. It's in God. That's why I think the message is so good. Don't you think the message is so wonderful? The message that God gave to this age through the vindicated prophet, if we would just listen to the words, all he ever does is puts it back on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He does not say, "Look at me." In fact, when the deity spirit came around before the seals were open in 1962 and tried to actually get brother Brandham to get on board with them baptizing in his name, he said, "You make me an antichrist, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take myself off of the field until you make that right." &gt;&gt; But there's still people, there's still deity spirit swirling around the world. There's still people that baptize in the name of Brandom, Christ Branham. There's still people that do that. There's still people that pray in in in the name of Rosco. There's still people that are are are doing things that are completely outside of what the message of the hour said. If we truly believe the message of the hour, then we'll go all the way into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll say amen to the entirety of the word. But I just love that about the message, how he always points back to God. He says it's not in a group of people, it's in God. because God is the word. See, &gt;&gt; your faith in is God. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful. It's it's such a a hallmark thing that we can see in our lives. If you ever wonder if you're right, just talk to a trinitarian about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Just have that conversation and and see the reaction that you get. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. It's a spiritual battle. It's not human. When you get the reaction you get, I mean, I'm sorry that you get that reaction, but that spirit doesn't like it because that spirit knows that if the person could get the true revelation about the two spirits working within the framework of the Christian church, what will happen? Satan will be powerless before her. &gt;&gt; If if she could get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost, Satan will be powerless before her. Last quote tonight as we close, I'll call the musicians. He says, "Now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith. They didn't have it because they'd had Christ walking with him." You know, I I didn't even get into the scripture that I wanted to bring tonight for this. I apologize. It's Matthew 17. And I don't want to try and keep us late. I'm just going to read this quote, but I I want to encourage us maybe go and read Matthew 17 and just see what what what what Brother Brandham is talking about here. He says, "Now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith. They didn't have it cuz they'd had Christ walking with him. But then afterwards, Christ was in them." And so, you see, it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It has to bring it. &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Barry harps about it because it's the only thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. Without the Holy Ghost in our lives, we're going to tribulation. I promise. &gt;&gt; Tribulation without the Holy Ghost because we already have the mark of the beast. We have Cain's DNA &gt;&gt; through the fall. That's our life. To resist the Holy Ghost, Brother Brandham said, is to accept the mark of the beast. It's already in us. We don't have to look for it. And so, you see, it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit. It has to bring it. It does. Now, you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith. Nope. For they had an epileptic child there. Remember the scripture I mentioned? They had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out of him and they couldn't do it. And the father seen Jesus coming and he said, "We've brought my son to your disciples and and they could not cure him." See, can you imagine how the disciples must have felt? And afterwards the disciples asked Jesus saying why could we not cure him. And Jesus said because of the lack of faith or your unbelief. That's right. Because of your unbelief. Now remember they had power. This is where I think it gets so tricky. This is where it gets real tricky. We need to understand what this means. Remember they had power. Jesus had given them power to heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out devils just a few days before that. They had the power, but not the faith to use the power. Now, there's the Bradom Tabernacle. He says, "Wow, his church, there's the Brandom Tabernacle. They had the power, but maybe not the faith to use the power." And that's what I want to encourage us tonight, brothers and sisters. If we're going to see these gifts, we've got to have the faith to use those gifts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The disciples had power. They had power, but not the faith to use the power. Now, there's the Brandham tabernacle. There's the church. There's the bride. Today, the Holy Spirit is here with power, but you haven't got that faith to move it. See what I mean? It takes faith to move it. In Matthew 17, if you want to check it out, go home and read it. You can see Jesus said, "You know what? After he did it, he just spoke the word. Jesus just spoke the [music] word and the spirit left." We know the kid went into one last fit. [music] But the spirit left that epileptic spirit. Today, we want to treat it with drugs and and therapy and all manner of different things, diet, all these things. we want to treat epilepsy with. But in the Bible, Jesus treated it. Dr. Jesus treated it just with his word. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Let's not let science get in the way of the word. &gt;&gt; Because it can very quickly, very easily get in the way of our faith. We need to have perfect faith. The faith that will change our bodies. Jesus said in here, I could even get into I could probably take another two services on this, brothers [music] and sisters. this part when we want to see that level of faith. Guess what? It's going to take effort. It's not just going to feather fall out of heaven into our laps because how did Jesus say at the end of this scripture? He said, "This kind only goes by fasting and prayer." [music] &gt;&gt; So when our lives are too busy for prayer and too busy for fasting and too busy for fasting and prayer, guess what? Those devils are going to have a place in our lives. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But if we want to see them go, they will go. They have to go. We've seen the formula. We've been given the formula. Read Matthew chapter 17. I want to encourage us to have faith &gt;&gt; and don't doubt. If we don't understand it, don't don't worry. We don't have to understand it. We just have to believe it. That's our commission. Just just believe [music] and all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God will do the rest. He'll reveal it to us. If we've got a burning question, all we've got to do is ask him. And I promise you, he will answer it. He'll answer it maybe through a minister. He'll answer it maybe through listening to a tape. He'll answer it maybe through a revelation, maybe a dream, maybe someone in the world, maybe somehow. Remember, he's God. Don't put him in a box and say, "It's got to be a certain way." If we ask him a question and just allow him to answer it, he will always answer. &gt;&gt; Always. [music] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close tonight. Remember, we're looking for perfect [music] faith. Brother Brandham preached that in 1963. Let's just [music] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. Thank you, Lord, for sending us a vindicated [music] prophet in the age in which we live, Lord, to know that there is a way, Father, even though there's so much error in this world, we don't look at ourselves and pat ourselves on the back and think that we're anything, Lord. We know that we are just like the publican that was praying in the temple that day. And the only thing we can do is hang our heads and say, "Lord, forgive me because I'm a sinner. Every single day of my life, it seems [music] I do something wrong. It seems that I fail." But we know our desire is to succeed. Our desire is to serve you according to your word. And we know that that desire is what will take us through. &gt;&gt; So, Father, tonight, if there's any one of us here tonight, Lord, that has something in our lives that maybe is left undone or that we have never dealt with because it hurts [music] too much. Father, I pray that you would give us strength in the name of Jesus to deal with that hurt, Lord, to deal with that that scar, Father, that problem that could hold us back. And father, maybe it's not holding us back, but the devil likes to try and make us think that perhaps it's not dealt with properly. And sometimes we just need to drive down a stake. We need to go back into that place and look at [music] it and drive down a stake and say, "From this time forwards, this will have no power over me as long as I live." And we know, Father, that you will always come on the scene when you're invited. We just got to be willing to go inside that secret place in our lives that we never want to look at and invite you to come come with us and and examine it and heal us. Father, we just want to commit each one into your hands tonight. Father, you know the reason we we ministered on this tonight. I don't, but I know you do. And Father, I pray that Lord, the word would just find its mark in the heart of your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray, Father, that you would help me as well, Father. Let me have nothing. Oh Lord, I don't claim to be anybody, Father. I know I'm nobody. Oh, Father, but I know somebody and I know you, Lord. And I just thank you for what you've done for each and every one of us tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would keep your hand upon those who aren't here tonight, Father. Some at work, some traveling. Oh, Father, some at home, maybe not feeling well. I pray that, Lord, they're feeling better now than they were at the beginning of this service, Lord. And father, I pray that when they wake up tomorrow, they would just have sweet rest tonight. That they would feel even better tomorrow. In the name of Jesus, we ask it. Lord, your word said that whatever we ask, we shall have it. So tonight, [music] we just declare it in the name of Jesus as a body for each and everyone who's not feeling well tonight. Father, we love you and we thank you, Lord. [music] We pray that you would just keep your hand upon us now as we travel home. Lord, keep us safe on the roads. If it's your will for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord, we will gladly come and worship you in spirit and in truth. We love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. Could we sing 902? I worship you, Almighty God. There's none like you. I worship you almighty God. There is none like you. [music] I worship you. [music and singing] Portraits of peace. That is [music and singing] what I long to do.
