[39:25] exposition of the seven Church ages if
[39:27] you have your Bibles tonight we would
[39:29] like to turn over to Revelations chapter
[39:31] 3 and uh just carry on with the text
[39:36] this is where the seven Church ages are
[39:39] found in Revelations chapter 2 and
[39:42] Revelations chapter 3 and uh it's just
[39:45] wonderful to think that we've been given
[39:47] the ability to understand what these
[39:50] mean even many theologians would uh poke
[39:53] and prod at it but not really have a a
[39:56] solid
[39:58] understanding or definition of it in
[39:59] fact some would even shy away from it
[40:02] because of the lack of Revelation But
[40:05] Here We Are Tonight Revelations
[40:10] 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of

[45:40] tonight we uh last time I believe it was
[45:44] before the new year we uh yeah was it
[45:49] Christmas Christmas e Christmas evening
[45:52] we actually had service yeah it's just
[45:54] been a blur there's been so much going
[45:56] on picking up from where we left off um
[45:59] in the church age book in the leoan
[46:01] church age Malachi verse Malachi chapter
[46:04] 4: 5 and 6 actually we'll just go back a
[46:08] little bit Matthew 7:
[46:12] 10-1
[46:15] um and his disciples asked him saying
[46:18] why then say the scribes that Elias must
[46:20] first come and Jesus answered and said
[46:23] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[46:25] and restore all all things now brother
[46:28] bradam in the leodan church age he
[46:30] begins talking about the leodan church
[46:34] age messenger and this is where he's
[46:37] going with the scriptures here he goes
[46:39] on to say before the coming of Our Lord
[46:42] Elijah must come back for a work of
[46:45] restoration in the church this is what
[46:47] Malachi 4 says behold I will send you
[46:50] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[46:52] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[46:54] and he shall turn the heart of the
[46:56] fathers to the children
[46:57] and the Heart of the children to their
[46:59] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[47:02] with a
[47:03] curse he said there's absolutely no
[47:06] doubt that Elijah must return before the
[47:10] coming of Jesus he has a specific work
[47:13] to accomplish that work is the part of
[47:17] Malachi
[47:18] 4:6 that says he will turn the hearts of
[47:21] the children to their fathers amen this
[47:25] reason the reason that we know this is
[47:28] his specific work to do at that time is
[47:31] because he has already accomplished the
[47:34] part that says he shall turn the hearts
[47:37] of the fathers to the children when the
[47:39] Elijah Ministry was here in John the
[47:42] Baptist I just love this in Luke 1:1
[47:46] 17 and he shall go before him in the
[47:49] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[47:53] hearts of the fathers to the children
[47:55] and the disob obedient to the wisdom of
[47:58] the just to make ready a people prepared
[48:01] for the
[48:03] Lord in the ministry of John the hearts
[48:06] of the fathers were turned to the
[48:08] children we know that because Jesus said
[48:12] so but it does not say that the hearts
[48:15] of the children were turned to the
[48:18] fathers that is yet to take place and
[48:22] isn't it beautiful because it's even now
[48:24] taking place amen the the hearts of the
[48:27] last day children will be turned back to
[48:29] the Pentecostal fathers John got the
[48:33] fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the
[48:35] children into the fold now this Prophet
[48:39] upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls
[48:43] will prepare the children to welcome
[48:45] back Jesus amen Jesus called John the
[48:49] Baptist Elijah Matthew 17:12 but I say
[48:53] unto you that Elias is come already and
[48:56] the knew him not but have done unto him
[48:59] whatsoever they
[49:01] listed the reason that he called John
[49:04] Elijah was because the same spirit that
[49:07] was on
[49:08] Elijah had come back upon John even as
[49:13] that Spirit had come back upon upon
[49:17] Elisha after the reign of King
[49:21] Ahab now once again the spirit will come
[49:23] back upon another man just before Jesus
[49:27] comes he will be a
[49:30] prophet and I know I'd be preaching to
[49:32] the choir tonight to say that you know
[49:34] wasn't it on the Ohio River the foot of
[49:36] Spring Street amen one
[49:39] afternoon this man that he's referring
[49:42] to was baptizing the 17th person and
[49:46] there was a star or a ball of fire or a
[49:49] pillar of fire that came down and
[49:52] hovered and there were hundreds of
[49:53] people around and some said they heard
[49:56] an angel and some maybe said they heard
[49:59] thunder but we know that there was a
[50:02] voice that came out of that amen that
[50:05] said as John the Baptist foran the first
[50:08] coming of the Lord so your ministry will
[50:11] forerun the second coming and it's so
[50:14] beautiful because he's talking about
[50:16] this being a future event but we can
[50:18] look back at that and say that that
[50:20] mystery is history it's already taken
[50:22] place amen we're not looking for that to
[50:25] happen he will be a prophet and how will
[50:29] we know that he is a prophet he will
[50:32] have signs and wonders in his ministry
[50:34] but he will always point back to the
[50:35] word that is the scriptural
[50:37] identification of a prophet amen he will
[50:40] be a prophet he will be Vindicated as
[50:43] such by God since Jesus himself in the
[50:47] flesh won't be here to vindicate him as
[50:50] he did John it will be done by the holy
[50:54] spirit so that this prophet's Ministry
[50:56] his will be attended by great and
[50:59] wonderful
[51:01] manifestation as a prophet every
[51:03] revelation will be Vindicated for every
[51:06] revelation will come to
[51:10] pass and I I know that he has said it
[51:13] and we could say it too is there anyone
[51:15] out there that could say that he was off
[51:17] on any one of the manifestations any one
[51:21] of the discernments any one of the
[51:23] prophecies not one of
[51:25] them wonderful acts of power will be
[51:28] performed at his commands in faith then
[51:32] will be brought forth the message that
[51:36] God has given him in the word to turn
[51:38] the people back to the truth and the
[51:41] true power of God some will listen but
[51:45] the majority will run true to form and
[51:48] reject him we know that there's always a
[51:51] sign first in a prophet's Ministry but
[51:54] there's always a voice that comes behind
[51:56] that sign the sign is there to get the
[51:59] attention of the people he said brother
[52:01] Bosworth said it was just like the bait
[52:03] on the hook to catch a fish you don't
[52:06] show the fish the hook because he may or
[52:09] may not bite it you show him the bait
[52:11] they like the bait so they'll bite it so
[52:14] the same thing with the word of God is
[52:16] what he was referring
[52:18] to signs and wonders lead and then the
[52:23] word and that's where brother Bram they
[52:25] say fell off he went off on his Doctrine
[52:28] when the word actually came the opening
[52:30] of the word it became a problem but he
[52:33] said it some will listen but the
[52:34] majority will run TR to form and reject
[52:37] him since this Prophet messenger of
[52:40] Revelations 10:7 will be the same as
[52:43] Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 who preaches
[52:47] that by the way
[52:49] today outside of the message nobody he
[52:52] will be naturally like Elijah and John
[52:57] both were Men set apart from the
[53:00] accepted religious schools of their day
[53:03] both were men of the Wilderness both
[53:05] acted only when they had thus sayeth the
[53:08] Lord straight from God by
[53:11] Revelation both lashed out against the
[53:14] religious orders and leaders of their
[53:16] day but not only was that so they lashed
[53:20] out against all who were corrupt or or
[53:24] would corrupt others I just sort of
[53:27] chuckled there because I I was just
[53:28] thinking about you know Elijah and the
[53:34] government in his day and and what
[53:37] Elijah that Elijah would be like with
[53:39] the government in his day
[53:42] today is there a government that's not
[53:45] corrupt straight from God by Revelation
[53:48] both lashed out against the religious
[53:49] orders and leaders of their day but not
[53:52] only was that so they lashed out against
[53:55] all who were corrupt corupt or would
[53:57] corrupt others and notice both
[53:59] prophesied much against immoral woman
[54:02] and their ways Elijah cried out against
[54:06] Jezebel and John rebuked herodias
[54:09] Philip's
[54:10] wife though he will not be popular he
[54:13] will be Vindicated by God isn't that
[54:16] wonderful that's I I believe that's the
[54:19] life of a Christian today the true
[54:21] Christian today is not going to be
[54:23] popular when people really know what the
[54:25] true Christian to believes and what they
[54:28] live for they're going to say my you're
[54:31] maybe not going to be popular but boy to
[54:33] be Vindicated by God Amen Hallelujah as
[54:36] Jesus authenticated John and the Holy
[54:40] Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well
[54:44] expect this man will be first of all
[54:48] authenticated by the spirit working in
[54:51] his life in Acts of power that are
[54:55] indisputable and found nowhere else
[54:58] Hallelujah isn't it wonderful to see
[55:01] this to be able to understand this when
[55:04] we look at history if you look at the
[55:06] faith healing movements that swept
[55:09] around the world they all came after
[55:12] him maybe there was some Ministries
[55:15] where the Lord was moving we know the
[55:17] isusa Street Revival happened that was
[55:19] before brother Bram came to his ministry
[55:23] but we know the faith Healing Ministry
[55:26] really took off and and even today
[55:28] there's so many people claiming to have
[55:31] this kind of a Ministry and not really
[55:33] having it because we know the word says
[55:36] that if a man wants to prophesy and he
[55:39] wants to actually show a a spirit of the
[55:42] Lord if if if he's off don't hear that
[55:45] man that's what the word says and many
[55:49] times you'll hear well they're pretty
[55:50] close most of the time but once in a
[55:52] while they're off either they're on or
[55:54] they're off we're we're either inspired
[55:58] by God and we live Godly lives for
[56:01] Christ or we
[56:04] don't I think this is just such a
[56:06] beautiful part of this book my though he
[56:09] will not be popular he will be
[56:11] Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated
[56:13] John and the Holy Ghost authenticated
[56:16] Jesus we can well expect this man will
[56:18] be first of all authenticated by the
[56:21] spirit working in his life in Acts of
[56:24] power that are indisputable and found
[56:27] nowhere else and Jesus himself in
[56:32] returning will authenticate
[56:35] him now that one is an
[56:38] interesting
[56:40] sentence and Jesus himself in returning
[56:44] will authenticate him even as he
[56:48] authenticated
[56:49] John when is that going to happen the
[56:51] reason I'm laboring on this is when is
[56:53] that going to happen what's the timeline
[56:55] like I think it's not like maybe we
[56:57] would read this and just gloss over it
[56:59] and think well when you know the people
[57:01] come riding Out of Heaven on white
[57:02] horses when he comes with the armies of
[57:04] Heaven that's when it's going to be all
[57:06] Vindicated but brothers and sisters I
[57:08] don't think that's the case and I'm sure
[57:10] by the way some are smiling tonight we
[57:12] understand that he's vindicating it even
[57:14] right now tonight he's Vindicated it all
[57:17] the way along after he took his man off
[57:20] of the scene when brother Bram went home
[57:23] and people thought that it was going to
[57:24] be the Rapture right then that was when
[57:26] Jesus now takes all the glory because he
[57:31] won't share his glory with anybody amen
[57:33] and we know that there's a deity spirit
[57:35] I think it even talks about it as we go
[57:37] a little further here but there's
[57:39] there's a group of people yeah he says
[57:41] it in here uh I just get confused I look
[57:43] at a lot of this uh message material but
[57:46] he says it in here there will be even a
[57:47] spirit that will actually try and deify
[57:50] this
[57:51] man and even today there's that spirit's
[57:54] alive and well
[57:56] amen and Jesus himself in returning so
[58:00] when is he going to return brothers and
[58:03] sisters I don't think we're looking for
[58:05] the return we're going to meet with him
[58:06] in the clouds but he's going to go to
[58:08] the clouds from
[58:10] where my even has he authenticated John
[58:13] John witnessed that Jesus was coming and
[58:16] so will this man like John witness that
[58:19] Jesus is
[58:23] coming it's closer than you think amen
[58:26] type it in see how many times he says
[58:29] it Jesus coming and the Very return of
[58:32] Christ will prove that this man indeed
[58:35] was the Forerunner of his second
[58:39] coming this is the final evidence that
[58:41] this indeed is the prophet of Malachi 4
[58:44] for the end of the Gentile period will
[58:47] be Jesus himself appearing you could
[58:52] type in the this is just ignites me you
[58:54] could type in the message the appear
[58:56] appearing the appearing and the coming
[58:58] are two separate things brother bradam
[59:01] says this is the appearing Amen in the
[59:04] message demonstrating the life of Jesus
[59:07] Christ only Christ could discern the
[59:09] hearts of men
[59:12] amen then it will be too late for those
[59:15] who have rejected
[59:19] him I just I just can't help but think
[59:21] brothers and sisters it could be any
[59:22] second now any moment now any day now
[59:25] amen any moment it's never been so close
[59:30] it's no time to get weary in well doing
[59:33] it's time to
[59:35] to to knuckle down and just take
[59:38] inventory and make sure we know where we
[59:40] are and and I say this preaching to
[59:42] myself here my in order to further
[59:46] clarify our presentation of this last
[59:48] day Prophet let us particularly note
[59:51] that the prophet of Matthew
[59:53] 11:12 was John the Baptist who was the
[59:56] one foretold in Malachi 3 Malachi 3:1
[1:00:01] behold I will send my messenger and he
[1:00:05] shall prepare the way before me and the
[1:00:08] Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
[1:00:11] his Temple even the messenger of the
[1:00:14] Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he
[1:00:18] shall come saith the Lord of hosts and
[1:00:21] it shall come to pass when Jesus and it
[1:00:24] came to pass sorry when Jesus had made
[1:00:27] an end of commanding his 12 disciples he
[1:00:29] departed then to teach and to preach in
[1:00:33] their
[1:00:34] cities now when John had heard in the
[1:00:36] prison of the W The Works of Christ he
[1:00:40] sent two of his
[1:00:42] disciples and said unto him art thou he
[1:00:45] that should come or do we look for
[1:00:46] another and we know brother Bram he said
[1:00:48] that that at this point John I was just
[1:00:51] marveling at this John messed with his
[1:00:54] own testimony wondering if this really
[1:00:57] was the one but I I just thought about
[1:01:00] it in my heart and I I just thought how
[1:01:02] could he not question because of the
[1:01:04] natural events he was looking for the
[1:01:07] Great Mighty wonderful Deliverance of
[1:01:09] Israel just like everyone was this is
[1:01:12] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[1:01:14] the sin of the world he knew who he was
[1:01:16] he recognized him but then he found
[1:01:18] himself in
[1:01:19] prison how many times do we find
[1:01:22] ourselves in natural situations is where
[1:01:24] I went to where we wonder really am I
[1:01:26] saved really is this message it am I on
[1:01:28] the right track is this really it's the
[1:01:30] devil brothers and sisters you're on the
[1:01:33] right track don't get weary in well
[1:01:35] doing this is not time to to get tired
[1:01:38] Jesus answered and said unto them go and
[1:01:41] show John again those things which you
[1:01:44] do hear and see now take this and
[1:01:47] parallel it with brother bram's message
[1:01:50] the blind receive their sight not only
[1:01:52] receive their sight but how could a man
[1:01:55] say
[1:01:56] what color of eyes would you
[1:01:58] like you never had eyes from birth but
[1:02:02] I'm telling you God that same one that
[1:02:04] created
[1:02:05] you he's telling me what color eyes do
[1:02:09] you
[1:02:10] want the blind receive their sight and
[1:02:14] eyes the lame walk he even said that
[1:02:17] there will be a restoration of Limbs
[1:02:20] amen the lepers are cleansed and the
[1:02:23] deaf here and the dead are raised up up
[1:02:26] and the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:02:28] them and blessed is he whosoever shall
[1:02:31] not be offended in me and as they
[1:02:33] departed Jesus began to say to the
[1:02:35] multitudes concerning John what went she
[1:02:37] out in the wilderness to see what were
[1:02:40] you expecting a re shaken with the wind
[1:02:43] but what went ye out for to see a man
[1:02:45] clothed in soft
[1:02:47] rment and I just think this is beautiful
[1:02:49] behold they that wear soft clothing are
[1:02:51] in King's houses to show them look it
[1:02:55] this gospel is rugged this gospel is not
[1:02:58] what you think this gospel is not the
[1:03:02] religious order of the day
[1:03:05] amen but what what yel for to see a
[1:03:08] prophet yay I say unto you and more than
[1:03:11] a prophet amen God speaking these words
[1:03:15] to the disciples for this is he of whom
[1:03:18] it is written behold I send my messenger
[1:03:21] before thy face which shall prepare the
[1:03:23] way before thee and I just can't help
[1:03:26] but think he probably could have wanted
[1:03:28] to say
[1:03:30] me verily I say unto you among them that
[1:03:33] are born of women there hath not risen a
[1:03:36] greater than John the Baptist
[1:03:38] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:03:40] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than
[1:03:43] he and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:03:46] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:03:47] suffereth violence and the violent take
[1:03:51] it by force that's Matthew
[1:03:54] 111-12 h
[1:03:56] brother Bram here he says this has
[1:03:58] already taken place this has happened
[1:04:00] it's over this has already taken place
[1:04:03] this has happened it's over but note now
[1:04:07] in Malachi 4 for behold the day cometh
[1:04:09] that shall burn as an oven and all the
[1:04:12] proud yay and all they that do wickedly
[1:04:16] shall be stubble and in the day that
[1:04:19] cometh shall burn them up sayith the
[1:04:22] Lord of hosts that it shall leave them
[1:04:24] neither root nor nor Branch but unto you
[1:04:28] that fear my name shall the son of
[1:04:30] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:04:32] wings amen and ye shall go forth and
[1:04:34] grow up as calves of the stall and you
[1:04:37] shall tread down the wicked for they
[1:04:40] shall be ashes Under The Souls of your
[1:04:42] feet in that day that I shall do this
[1:04:45] sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the
[1:04:47] law of Moses my servant which I
[1:04:49] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[1:04:53] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[1:04:56] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:04:59] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:05:02] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[1:05:04] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:05:05] the children and the Heart of the
[1:05:07] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:05:10] and smite the Earth with a
[1:05:14] curse he says see immediately after the
[1:05:17] coming of this Elijah the Earth will be
[1:05:21] cleansed by fire and the wicked burn to
[1:05:24] ashes of course this did not happen at
[1:05:28] the time of John the Elijah for his day
[1:05:32] the spirit of God that prophesied the
[1:05:35] coming of the messenger in Malachi 3:1
[1:05:38] John was but reiterating his previous
[1:05:42] prophetic statement of Isaiah
[1:05:45] 40:3 made at least three centuries
[1:05:50] previously the voice of him that crith
[1:05:53] in the wilderness prepare ye
[1:05:56] the way of the Lord make straight in the
[1:05:59] desert a highway for our God and you
[1:06:02] know that's where you can look at it and
[1:06:04] say this man was a prophet because he
[1:06:07] absolutely went right back to the
[1:06:09] scripture and just quoted the word when
[1:06:11] they came and said to him who are you
[1:06:13] are you the Messiah are you the one they
[1:06:15] even asked him are you a prophet and he
[1:06:17] said no no no I'm just the voice of one
[1:06:21] amen crying in the wilderness prepare ye
[1:06:23] the way of the Lord he quoted exact
[1:06:26] scripture back to the most religious of
[1:06:28] the day and they still couldn't
[1:06:30] comprehend it
[1:06:33] am now John by the Holy Ghost voiced
[1:06:36] both Isaiah and Malachi in Matthew
[1:06:39] chapter 3 for this is he that was spoken
[1:06:42] of by the prophet isaas saying the voice
[1:06:45] of one crying in the wilderness prepare
[1:06:47] ye the way of the Lord make his paths
[1:06:50] straight so we can see we can well see
[1:06:53] from these scriptures that the prophet
[1:06:55] of Malachi 3 who was John was not the
[1:06:59] prophet of Malachi
[1:07:02] 4 though indeed both John and this last
[1:07:05] day Prophet have upon them the same
[1:07:09] Spirit which was upon
[1:07:12] Elijah now this messenger of Malachi 4
[1:07:16] and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[1:07:20] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:07:24] will turn the heart hearts of the
[1:07:26] children to the
[1:07:27] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[1:07:31] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:07:34] which are the revelations contained in
[1:07:37] the Seven
[1:07:38] Seals it will be these divinely raled
[1:07:42] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:07:45] hearts of the children to the
[1:07:47] Pentecostal fathers exactly so I I think
[1:07:50] this is just a Hallmark um paragraph for
[1:07:53] the message of the hour at summer Rises
[1:07:56] the message of the hour I just love how
[1:07:58] he says in here that it will literally
[1:08:01] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:08:03] Pentecostal fathers this just gets me
[1:08:05] excited when I start to get excited I
[1:08:07] got to loosen up here I I apologize but
[1:08:10] you know I just think it's wonderful
[1:08:12] because we can look at this and say you
[1:08:13] know according to the message we we know
[1:08:15] that it's according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:08:17] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:08:18] the fathers and and that's where we live
[1:08:20] and two this is where it it gets really
[1:08:23] interesting in the message he will
[1:08:25] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:08:27] thunders of Revelations 10 which are the
[1:08:30] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:08:32] who knows those things who talks about
[1:08:35] those things they're mysterious people
[1:08:37] shy away from it that's why people don't
[1:08:39] get into the Book of Revelation they
[1:08:41] don't want nothing to do with it because
[1:08:43] of those things and it will be these
[1:08:45] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:08:47] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:08:48] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:08:50] exactly so I want to say this brothers
[1:08:51] and sisters if this happens to us if we
[1:08:54] really do experience these two things as
[1:08:57] message Believers amen all Mysteries
[1:09:00] aside the ABCs just happen in our lives
[1:09:04] we don't have to be told the ABCs
[1:09:07] because we understand what all of the
[1:09:09] mystery truths actually are in the
[1:09:11] message of the hour brother bradam said
[1:09:14] it how can you do algebra when you can't
[1:09:17] even do your ABCs you cannot read a
[1:09:20] mathematical formula a problem you can't
[1:09:23] read a problem and and be able to Sol it
[1:09:25] if you don't know how to
[1:09:27] read it's such a beautiful thing we can
[1:09:30] say this is wonderful Amen to these
[1:09:32] things but are we saying Amen to these
[1:09:35] things because these mystery truths have
[1:09:37] literally turned our hearts back to the
[1:09:40] faith of the Pentecostal fathers and we
[1:09:43] actually live our lives marching to the
[1:09:46] ABCs of the word of God and of the
[1:09:48] message of the
[1:09:50] hour I want to say this now someone
[1:09:52] might actually want to dispute it a and
[1:09:54] forgive me for it but I want to say that
[1:09:57] if we are not marching to the word of
[1:09:59] God in our lives then I want to say that
[1:10:02] these mystery truths just haven't been
[1:10:04] revealed brothers and sisters when you
[1:10:06] get someone saying I know this and I'm
[1:10:08] preaching this and this is this is
[1:10:10] mysterious truths and all all the
[1:10:13] Mysteries are given to us but we're not
[1:10:16] living it come on right it's not the
[1:10:20] right
[1:10:22] representation it will literally right
[1:10:26] not figuratively and that's what the
[1:10:28] problem is that's what I'm getting at
[1:10:30] because sometimes it's shrouded in
[1:10:32] mystery well it's it's figuratively my
[1:10:35] heart's turned no no the prophet of God
[1:10:37] for the seventh age he said literally
[1:10:40] amen that means the life behind the name
[1:10:43] is what's going to make the demons
[1:10:46] tremble it's not going to be saying I
[1:10:48] know the
[1:10:50] Mysteries but consider this also this
[1:10:54] Prophet messenger will be in his nature
[1:10:58] and manners as were Elijah and John amen
[1:11:01] the people of this Prophet Messengers
[1:11:04] day will be as they were in ahab's day
[1:11:09] my and in John's and since it is only
[1:11:13] the children whose Hearts will be turned
[1:11:17] it is only the children who will listen
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:22] amen it made me chuckle a little bit
[1:11:24] here
[1:11:25] because the children will
[1:11:31] listen I say Lord help me to
[1:11:34] listen in the days of Ahab only 7,000
[1:11:37] true seed Israelites were found in the
[1:11:40] days of John there were also very few
[1:11:44] the masses in both Ages were in the
[1:11:47] fornication of
[1:11:50] idolatry remember we we studied a little
[1:11:53] while ago and and I'm just going through
[1:11:55] another Bible study in this in the
[1:11:57] exposition of the seven Church ages it's
[1:11:58] just it's beautiful it's just
[1:12:00] overlapping and I'm I'm getting so much
[1:12:02] out of it but you you can't have the
[1:12:04] spirit of nianis where the the spiritual
[1:12:08] leaders are looking to conquer the leoty
[1:12:11] without the spirit of balam ism amen
[1:12:14] right there they're together and we know
[1:12:17] both of those are actually terrible
[1:12:19] where if you're not doing it my way if
[1:12:21] you're not doing it the way that I've
[1:12:23] been taught if you're not doing it the
[1:12:24] way my tradition is if you're not doing
[1:12:26] it the way that my pastor used to if
[1:12:27] you're not doing it the way that I think
[1:12:29] then you're doing it
[1:12:31] wrong it's
[1:12:34] wrong that's not the way it's supposed
[1:12:36] to be that's right you know and even
[1:12:39] Elijah he he he actually thought that he
[1:12:41] was the only one right I've been jealous
[1:12:43] for you Lord but he said to him hey you
[1:12:45] know what I've got seven other thousand
[1:12:48] people that have not bowed their knee to
[1:12:50] bail so just
[1:12:52] relax in the days of Ahab
[1:12:55] 7,000 only 7,000 true seed Israelites
[1:12:59] were found the days of John there were
[1:13:01] also very few the masses and both Ages
[1:13:04] were in the fornication of idolatry I
[1:13:07] want to make one more comparison between
[1:13:09] the leodan prophet messenger and John
[1:13:13] the prophet messenger who preceded
[1:13:15] jesus' first coming the people in John's
[1:13:19] day mistook him for
[1:13:22] messiah and this is the record of John
[1:13:26] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[1:13:28] from Jerusalem to ask him who who art
[1:13:30] thou and he
[1:13:32] confessed and denied not but confessed I
[1:13:36] am not the
[1:13:37] Christ that was John 1:1 19-20 now this
[1:13:41] last day Prophet Messenger will have
[1:13:44] such power before the Lord that there
[1:13:46] will be those who mistake him for the
[1:13:49] Lord Jesus yes there will be a spirit in
[1:13:53] the world at the end time
[1:13:55] that will seduce some and make them
[1:13:58] believe this and you know brothers and
[1:14:00] sisters this deity spirit came out and
[1:14:03] really manifested strong in
[1:14:06] 1961 62 right up just before the seals
[1:14:10] just before the seals were opened sunset
[1:14:13] Mountain he went back to Jeffersonville
[1:14:15] just before all that took place this
[1:14:16] deity spirit got to the place where it
[1:14:18] was at it Zenith in and around brother
[1:14:20] bram's message and he said if you don't
[1:14:23] stop baptizing in my name if you don't
[1:14:26] stop trying to make me the Messiah I
[1:14:28] have to take myself off the field
[1:14:30] because you make me an antichrist amen
[1:14:32] because I am not that man I am the one
[1:14:36] that was standing there when he came but
[1:14:38] I am not that man and it's just a
[1:14:41] beautiful thing when I I heard it I I
[1:14:43] realized isn't it wonderful the way God
[1:14:45] does stuff he won't let any fornication
[1:14:48] or idolatry get in the way of his word
[1:14:50] so here we had God's Prophet right when
[1:14:52] all of that stirring around was going on
[1:14:55] it was happening for a reason because
[1:14:57] God was just about to make the greatest
[1:14:59] move that took place since Jesus Christ
[1:15:01] came to the Earth in the flesh these
[1:15:04] mystery seals these
[1:15:07] divinely revealed mystery seals were
[1:15:09] open I I I'm sorry I just get preaching
[1:15:12] I just think it's wonderful to see these
[1:15:14] things am
[1:15:16] interesting there will be a spirit in
[1:15:18] the world at the end time that will
[1:15:20] seduce some and make them believe this
[1:15:23] people will believe that brother Bram
[1:15:26] was the Messiah people will believe that
[1:15:31] everything that he said was anointed
[1:15:33] that everything that he did should be
[1:15:36] followed you know he was a man he came
[1:15:40] to introduce Jesus
[1:15:41] Christ he didn't come to say do every
[1:15:44] single thing that I do say everything
[1:15:45] that I say and do it exactly the way I
[1:15:47] do it and say it the exact way I say it
[1:15:50] he said get to Jesus Christ when he the
[1:15:53] spirit of truth comes he will lead and
[1:15:55] guide you into all truth pointing back
[1:15:58] to the word again amen Matthew 24 24 to
[1:16:02] 26 there shall arise false christs and
[1:16:07] false prophets and show great signs and
[1:16:10] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:16:13] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:16:16] elect he says behold I told you
[1:16:20] before wherefore if they shall say unto
[1:16:22] you behold he is in the desert go not
[1:16:24] forth behold he's in the secret
[1:16:27] Chambers believe him not you know
[1:16:31] remember in another scripture I'm not
[1:16:32] sure which one it is I think it's in
[1:16:34] Matthew um there will be some that will
[1:16:37] go and stand before him in that day and
[1:16:40] say Lord Lord didn't we cast out devils
[1:16:43] in your name and do many mighty wonders
[1:16:46] and signs in your name and and he'll say
[1:16:49] you know what I I never even knew you
[1:16:52] depart from me and it wasn't that there
[1:16:54] wasn't introduction there was Zero
[1:16:57] relationship that's right zero intimacy
[1:17:01] zero willingness to submit to him as
[1:17:04] Lord we want to call him Jesus Christ we
[1:17:07] want to talk about the blood but to
[1:17:09] absolutely surrender everything unto him
[1:17:12] as Lord that's a different story you're
[1:17:15] going a little bit too far there but
[1:17:17] it's just wonderful to see that you know
[1:17:19] we can understand that this spirit's
[1:17:21] going to be there we can also understand
[1:17:23] that we don't have to fall under that
[1:17:25] spirit and that's where brothers and
[1:17:27] sisters when we talk about spirits you
[1:17:28] get the Holy Spirit you don't have to
[1:17:29] worry about any Spirit the devil's got
[1:17:32] no power over you when you got the Holy
[1:17:34] Ghost
[1:17:36] amen and I want to say this too the
[1:17:38] devil's got no power over children of
[1:17:41] Holy Ghost filled parents
[1:17:45] am he says but don't you believe it he
[1:17:49] is not Jesus
[1:17:51] Christ talking about himself the don't
[1:17:55] you believe it this this prophet of
[1:17:57] Malachi 4 is not Jesus
[1:17:59] Christ he is not the Son of God he is
[1:18:04] one of the Brethren
[1:18:07] amen a prophet a messenger a servant of
[1:18:12] God he needs no greater honor bestowed
[1:18:15] upon him than that which John received
[1:18:18] when he was the voice that cried I am
[1:18:21] not he but he is coming after me amen
[1:18:25] yes before we close this section on the
[1:18:27] messenger of the Le oysan age we must
[1:18:31] seriously consider these two
[1:18:34] thoughts first this age will have one
[1:18:38] Prophet
[1:18:40] Messenger right this is so
[1:18:43] important because there's another spirit
[1:18:45] in the
[1:18:46] land and there's people that want to
[1:18:49] have another
[1:18:50] messenger of this age and and that's
[1:18:53] it's it's it's it's it's sad but it's
[1:18:56] evil and it's not evil maybe in a
[1:18:58] malicious way where they want to hurt
[1:19:00] and harm people and Destroy people but
[1:19:02] it's a spiritual battle and it it's evil
[1:19:04] if it's contrary to the word of God
[1:19:06] remember anything contrary to the word
[1:19:07] of God even if it's shrouded in a cloak
[1:19:10] and and and gold and and and very
[1:19:13] religious and and and and super nice and
[1:19:16] Flowery doing really good things for
[1:19:18] other people if it's contrary to the
[1:19:20] word of God it's evil it's either good
[1:19:22] or it's evil there's no Middle Ground
[1:19:25] here in this world in which we live even
[1:19:28] though the devil would like to propagate
[1:19:30] that it's okay to just get a little bit
[1:19:32] gray you can you know move into the gray
[1:19:34] scale just a little bit no that's not
[1:19:36] the way it works it's either good or
[1:19:38] it's bad it's it's Christ or the
[1:19:42] devil he says but don't you believe it
[1:19:45] he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son
[1:19:49] of God he is one of the Brethren a
[1:19:51] prophet a messenger a servant of God he
[1:19:54] needs no great G honor bestowed upon him
[1:19:56] than that which John received when he
[1:19:58] was the voice that cried I am not he but
[1:20:01] he is coming after me before we close
[1:20:03] this section on the messenger of the
[1:20:05] leoan age we must seriously consider
[1:20:07] these two thoughts first this age will
[1:20:09] have one Prophet messenger Revelations
[1:20:12] 10:7 says when he singular shall begin
[1:20:16] to sound there has never been an age
[1:20:20] where God gave his people two Major
[1:20:22] Prophets at one time
[1:20:25] he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone
[1:20:29] he gave
[1:20:30] Moses he alone had the word though
[1:20:34] others prophesied John the Baptist came
[1:20:38] alone now in this last day there is to
[1:20:42] be a prophet not a
[1:20:45] propheus not a propheus although in this
[1:20:48] age there are more women perpetrating to
[1:20:52] give God's revelation than men
[1:20:57] that was back then what is it today
[1:20:59] brothers and sisters you you have female
[1:21:01] clergy all over the place and where does
[1:21:04] that come from what's it based on is it
[1:21:08] based on the word of God the original
[1:21:09] word of God or is it uh is it a
[1:21:12] theological study is it from a a council
[1:21:15] meeting of the Brethren that got
[1:21:18] together and said well it could be a
[1:21:19] good idea cuz I'm getting a lot of
[1:21:21] pressure from my wife at home she really
[1:21:22] has a message and she'd really like to
[1:21:24] preach so maybe it comes to the the the
[1:21:27] council in in in Europe somewhere along
[1:21:29] the way I don't know where it came out
[1:21:31] I'm just making it up but I mean where
[1:21:33] does it come from I think it's beautiful
[1:21:35] the way he said it not a prophetess
[1:21:37] although in this age there are more
[1:21:39] women perpetrating to give God's
[1:21:40] revelation than men and the infallible
[1:21:43] word says that he the prophet will
[1:21:47] reveal the Mysteries to the Endtime
[1:21:49] people and turn the hearts of the
[1:21:51] children back to the fathers
[1:21:55] there are those that say God's people
[1:21:57] are going to come together through a
[1:22:00] collective
[1:22:02] Revelation there are those who say that
[1:22:06] God's people are going to come together
[1:22:08] through a collective
[1:22:10] Revelation I'm I'm I'm I'm just sort of
[1:22:13] laboring on this for a second because I
[1:22:15] think it's interesting we can look at
[1:22:17] what's going on in the denominational
[1:22:19] world and they're crying for change
[1:22:22] they're looking for oil they want to see
[1:22:24] the spirit of God good people want to
[1:22:28] see it people are looking for Revival
[1:22:31] that's really the bottom line they want
[1:22:34] to see Revival they know there's
[1:22:35] something supposed to happen there's
[1:22:37] something supposed to come isn't it
[1:22:38] interesting that people are looking at
[1:22:40] it from that perspective but yet there
[1:22:43] was a prophet in the land that told them
[1:22:45] get back to the word just get back to
[1:22:48] the word and everything will be fine
[1:22:50] there will be a Revival and isn't it
[1:22:52] beautiful to say there is a Revival
[1:22:54] that's taking place in the land today
[1:22:57] but it's not a group Revival it's an
[1:22:59] individual
[1:23:01] Revival but there are those that say
[1:23:03] God's people are going to come together
[1:23:07] through a collective Revelation here we
[1:23:10] have the prophet just like Jeremiah
[1:23:12] crying out to Israel get back in line
[1:23:14] stop worshiping Idols stop sacrificing
[1:23:17] to Idols get back in line the King of
[1:23:20] the North is coming down he's being
[1:23:23] stirred up like a seething Boiling Pot
[1:23:26] and he's going to pour out all over you
[1:23:28] just get back to the word yes he says I
[1:23:32] challenge that
[1:23:33] statement the Vindicated Prophet says
[1:23:36] this it's a bald invalid assumption in
[1:23:40] the face of Revelations
[1:23:42] 10:7 now I do not deny that people will
[1:23:46] prophesy in this last age and their
[1:23:48] Ministries can and will be
[1:23:51] correct I do not deny that there will be
[1:23:55] prophets even in even as in the days of
[1:23:59] Paul when there was one agabus a prophet
[1:24:03] who prophesied of a famine I agree that
[1:24:07] is
[1:24:09] so but I deny I love how this is in
[1:24:14] capitals I learned once with uh
[1:24:18] emails this is
[1:24:21] shouting I but I deny upon the
[1:24:24] infallible evidence of the word that
[1:24:27] there is more than one major prophet
[1:24:30] messenger who will
[1:24:34] reveal
[1:24:35] sorry but I deny upon the infallible
[1:24:38] evidence of the word that there is more
[1:24:41] than one major prophet messenger who
[1:24:43] will reveal the Mysteries as contained
[1:24:46] in the word and who has the ministry to
[1:24:50] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:24:53] fathers
[1:24:57] thus saith the Lord by his unfailing
[1:25:00] words stands and shall stand and be
[1:25:04] Vindicated there is one Prophet
[1:25:07] Messenger to this
[1:25:09] age and you know it doesn't matter how
[1:25:13] many people agree through a collective
[1:25:17] Revelation that there's an
[1:25:20] eighth it doesn't matter how many people
[1:25:23] say it it doesn't does matter how many
[1:25:25] people say it's okay for women to preach
[1:25:28] doesn't matter how many people say it's
[1:25:30] okay to live a homosexual life it
[1:25:33] doesn't matter how many people say it's
[1:25:35] okay to do all these things in the world
[1:25:37] in which we live if it's contrary to the
[1:25:39] word of God it's evil
[1:25:43] Amen on the basis of human behavior
[1:25:46] alone anyone knows that there are many
[1:25:50] people there is even divided opinion on
[1:25:53] lesser points of a major Doctrine which
[1:25:56] they all hold together who then will
[1:25:59] have the power of infallibility which is
[1:26:02] to be restored in this last age for this
[1:26:05] last age is going to go back to
[1:26:08] manifesting the pure word bride that
[1:26:11] means we will have the word once again
[1:26:15] as it was perfectly
[1:26:17] given and perfectly understood in the
[1:26:20] days of Paul and that's where I go back
[1:26:23] to the perfect real realization we can
[1:26:25] have a revelation but then we can have a
[1:26:27] perfect realization of that Revelation
[1:26:29] because the Revelation that we got when
[1:26:31] it goes back to the word of God when it
[1:26:32] goes back to the message of the hour we
[1:26:34] can say that's the perfect realization
[1:26:37] that God has given this to us it's not
[1:26:39] something that the devil gave us it's
[1:26:41] not something that the radio gave us
[1:26:43] it's not something that we just got from
[1:26:45] somewhere this is directly from God
[1:26:47] remember the prophet of God said that
[1:26:49] when God does that for you that's your
[1:26:50] personal property nobody can take it
[1:26:53] from you amen
[1:26:55] I think it must be like the pride of
[1:26:56] ownership in someone that might have
[1:26:58] like a University degree I know we have
[1:27:00] some very educated individuals in the
[1:27:02] congregation here and when you have that
[1:27:04] nobody can take it from you my dad told
[1:27:07] me that you can always fall back on it
[1:27:09] get a degree nobody can ever take it
[1:27:11] from you they can take the degree and
[1:27:13] tear it up but you have it inside of
[1:27:15] you but I didn't
[1:27:17] listen he says I will tell you who will
[1:27:21] have it it will be a prophit
[1:27:24] as thoroughly Vindicated or even more
[1:27:27] thoroughly Vindicated than was any
[1:27:30] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:27:33] this
[1:27:35] day because this man will of necessity
[1:27:38] have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and
[1:27:42] God will show him forth he won't need to
[1:27:45] speak for himself God will speak for him
[1:27:50] by the voice of the sign
[1:27:55] I think that's why every one of us say
[1:27:57] Amen to William Mariam Bram as the
[1:27:59] seventh angel messenger because the the
[1:28:01] voice of that sign you can see the sign
[1:28:04] but there's nobody ever that could do
[1:28:06] what he did and and we know that it
[1:28:09] wasn't who he did there's nobody ever
[1:28:12] had God moved through them the way that
[1:28:14] God moved through William Mary and
[1:28:16] bradam because it was God in William
[1:28:19] Mariam branam amen the second thought
[1:28:22] must be impressed on our heart so the
[1:28:24] first one was there's only one Messenger
[1:28:26] to this age only one the second thought
[1:28:30] that must be impressed on our hearts is
[1:28:32] that the seven Church ages started out
[1:28:34] with the Antichrist Spirit as well as
[1:28:37] the Holy Spirit who has has to be
[1:28:41] blessed forever
[1:28:44] my the two Vines growing together
[1:28:48] hey beloved believe not every Spirit but
[1:28:52] try the spirits whether they are of God
[1:28:56] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:28:57] into the
[1:28:59] world and this is where I say brothers
[1:29:01] and sisters outside of the Holy Ghost In
[1:29:03] Our Lives there's no way that we're
[1:29:04] going to be able to try the spirits the
[1:29:07] only thing that we're going to do is
[1:29:08] have a spirit inside of us if we resist
[1:29:10] the Holy Ghost as people do if we resist
[1:29:14] the Holy Ghost then we're going to have
[1:29:16] uh call it a comrade spirit that will
[1:29:19] actually be controlling us and you know
[1:29:23] it's interesting because
[1:29:24] brother Bram said it and and we probably
[1:29:26] heard the statement before but birds of
[1:29:27] a feather flock together there's a
[1:29:29] reason why we gather together here like
[1:29:31] this because we have similar Spirit but
[1:29:35] when you see someone acting out and not
[1:29:37] acting right according to the word of
[1:29:40] God do they have the Holy Spirit I don't
[1:29:42] know maybe they do or or maybe they just
[1:29:44] have taken a break from it the holy
[1:29:46] spirit's flown up into the tree as
[1:29:48] brother brandham said doesn't mean that
[1:29:50] they're a ranked Sinner and that they're
[1:29:51] lost as lost can be they just need to
[1:29:54] get back in line they need to get back
[1:29:55] to where they left off that's all but
[1:29:58] sometimes when you see people you can
[1:30:00] see that maybe things don't ly up maybe
[1:30:03] there's just something a little bit off
[1:30:05] we've been given the spirit of
[1:30:07] discernment through the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:08] what I'm getting at brothers and sisters
[1:30:10] but it doesn't give us license or
[1:30:12] Liberty license or Liberty to mistreat
[1:30:16] that individual amen what it does is it
[1:30:19] gives us the ability to recognize that
[1:30:21] maybe our brother maybe our sister is in
[1:30:23] the day
[1:30:24] amen and we need to pray for that person
[1:30:28] we need to Mentor that person we need to
[1:30:30] reach out and try and help that
[1:30:33] person not try and kick him not try and
[1:30:37] push him out but many times people do
[1:30:39] that oh well you you know in 1 John 4:1
[1:30:42] we' we've been told to believe not every
[1:30:43] spirit because you know what we're
[1:30:45] supposed to try the spirits
[1:30:47] right no that's not what it's about it's
[1:30:50] to understand exactly where we are
[1:30:52] exactly where we stand to know you know
[1:30:55] brother Bram talked about it how Jesus
[1:30:57] did it he went to the well Jacob's Well
[1:31:01] and sat down sent the disciples away cuz
[1:31:03] he knew it was going on he had one
[1:31:05] purpose to be there and that purpose was
[1:31:07] to talk to someone and to talk to that
[1:31:09] woman a and to actually contact her
[1:31:12] spirit to try her spirit we are the same
[1:31:16] way we've been created the same way if
[1:31:18] we have his mind in us then we are going
[1:31:21] to want to contact people's Spirits
[1:31:23] brother Bram said that I talk to people
[1:31:25] so I can contact their Spirit I'll talk
[1:31:27] to them until I can contact their Spirit
[1:31:28] we do that as human beings it's the way
[1:31:32] it works did you notice it the
[1:31:34] Antichrist spirit is identified with
[1:31:37] false
[1:31:41] prophets religious as all get
[1:31:44] out probably the most religious in fact
[1:31:48] probably knows the most about the
[1:31:51] mysteries about those divinely revealed
[1:31:54] secrets that were contained in the seven
[1:31:57] Thunders probably knows the most about
[1:32:00] the message of the hour right the
[1:32:03] Antichrist spirit is identified with
[1:32:05] false prophets the ages came in with
[1:32:08] false prophets and they will go out with
[1:32:12] false
[1:32:13] prophets now of course there is going to
[1:32:16] be a real false prophet I love how he
[1:32:18] says this here there is going to be a
[1:32:21] man who is completely incarnate as the
[1:32:24] false the false prophet there will be a
[1:32:27] real false prophet he says there has to
[1:32:30] be because the Beast is another
[1:32:34] being I think a human someone might have
[1:32:37] more info on that and I'd certainly like
[1:32:39] to talk about it but there is a beast
[1:32:41] and there is a false prophet both of
[1:32:43] them get plucked up and what in
[1:32:46] Revelations they get thrown in the Lake
[1:32:47] of Fire amen both of them so there has
[1:32:51] to be a real false prophet that's why
[1:32:53] why I'm I'm saying this I think it's
[1:32:55] really good the way he said this there
[1:32:56] is a real false prophet in the grand
[1:32:58] sense of that man mentioned in
[1:33:01] Revelation but as of now before his
[1:33:04] Revelation there are to appear many
[1:33:07] false
[1:33:08] prophets so close that it would deceive
[1:33:10] the very elected if it were possible so
[1:33:12] where are they going to be brothers and
[1:33:14] sisters it ain't going to be in the
[1:33:15] Pentecostal Church Matthew 2423 to 26
[1:33:21] then if any man shall say unto you Lo
[1:33:24] here is Christ or there believe it
[1:33:27] not for there shall arise false christs
[1:33:31] and false prophets and shall shall show
[1:33:35] shall show great signs and
[1:33:40] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:33:42] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:33:44] elect it's not like they're going to be
[1:33:46] ranked
[1:33:46] Sinners they're not going to be not
[1:33:49] actually manifesting
[1:33:52] something why wow they're going to have
[1:33:55] great signs and
[1:33:56] wonders but for those that have the Holy
[1:34:00] Ghost they shall not deceive them those
[1:34:04] people who have the Holy Ghost will be
[1:34:05] the very elect
[1:34:07] amen and and boy I feel like I could
[1:34:09] preach on that right now too because
[1:34:12] there's a holy ghost anointing that many
[1:34:15] people are partakers of in this
[1:34:17] age but there's very few people that
[1:34:19] truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:22] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost
[1:34:24] is going to get them in line with the
[1:34:26] word for their day outside of being in
[1:34:29] line with the word for your day you
[1:34:30] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:32] it really is
[1:34:33] true some people would want to dispute
[1:34:36] that and that's okay but those people
[1:34:39] who have the baptism and the Holy Ghost
[1:34:40] will come according to the word of God
[1:34:41] how will you know if it's a false Christ
[1:34:44] how will you know if it's a false
[1:34:45] prophet they're going to be mostly on
[1:34:47] the word except for that one thing right
[1:34:50] that one or two things they're going to
[1:34:51] be so close but there's just going to be
[1:34:54] something that's going to make you
[1:34:55] scratch your head you'll say my there's
[1:34:57] just something off brother bradam talks
[1:35:00] about the Bell that has a crack in it
[1:35:02] right you know the story he talks about
[1:35:04] if if a bell is rang and it doesn't
[1:35:07] sound true there's something off in that
[1:35:09] Bell sometimes it's like that brothers
[1:35:11] and sisters maybe why you're harping on
[1:35:13] this brother Barry I just want to say it
[1:35:15] we need to know where we
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:18] stand I mean let's let's do this let's
[1:35:21] just just do this I think it's important
[1:35:24] brothers and
[1:35:25] sisters what if we have a
[1:35:29] flock what if we have I'm just going to
[1:35:32] say it a false prophet in the flock and
[1:35:35] what if that false prophet now starts to
[1:35:38] intermingle with the flock and talk to
[1:35:42] Children talk to children in in the
[1:35:45] flock right and the
[1:35:47] children see the brother or the sister
[1:35:50] as a good person but yet nobody actually
[1:35:54] does anything what happens is that
[1:35:57] little tiny bit of residue that can come
[1:36:00] from that person it's a spirit can get
[1:36:02] on that child and now that child can
[1:36:06] have that little residue of a spirit in
[1:36:09] their life and not even know it and the
[1:36:12] thing about it is the way the devil
[1:36:14] works this is the way the devil Works
[1:36:16] he's not going to manifest a religious
[1:36:18] spirit in a child what will happen is
[1:36:20] that child will now turn into a
[1:36:22] rebellious child child amen and parents
[1:36:25] will scratch their head and say why is
[1:36:27] that child acting that way what's going
[1:36:29] on I did everything for them we taught
[1:36:30] them the word we da I'm not saying this
[1:36:33] is exactly the way it happens don't get
[1:36:35] me wrong what I'm saying is it could
[1:36:37] happen this way that's why it's
[1:36:39] important for us to know where we
[1:36:41] stand amen we've got to know we're
[1:36:44] supposed to try the spirits brothers and
[1:36:46] sisters that's the word of God that's
[1:36:48] not brother Barry saying it but how are
[1:36:50] we going to know if someone is on on on
[1:36:53] if someone is in line with the word if
[1:36:56] they're actually a true Prophet or a
[1:36:57] false prophet they're going to be in
[1:36:59] line with the word they're going to be
[1:37:00] exactly in line with the word there's
[1:37:02] not going to be any excuses and if
[1:37:03] they're outside of the word and somebody
[1:37:05] says to them you're not in line with the
[1:37:07] word what's up they're going to say oh
[1:37:09] my I'm so sorry I apologize and come
[1:37:12] maybe before the church and say I
[1:37:13] misquoted that forgive me for it I don't
[1:37:16] want to be wrong with the
[1:37:18] word but when the correction comes if
[1:37:20] they start to puff up and say oh uh uh
[1:37:25] right right you know them by their
[1:37:28] fruits amen when correction comes how do
[1:37:31] we
[1:37:33] behave these false prophets are
[1:37:36] earmarked for us in various other
[1:37:40] scriptures such as the following 2 Peter
[1:37:42] 2:
[1:37:44] 1-2 but there were false prophets also
[1:37:47] among the
[1:37:48] people even as there shall be false
[1:37:51] teachers among you
[1:37:53] who privy shall bring IND damnable
[1:37:57] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:38:00] brought
[1:38:01] them and bring upon themselves Swift
[1:38:05] destruction and many shall follow their
[1:38:09] pernicious Ways by reason of whom the
[1:38:13] way of truth shall be evil spoken
[1:38:19] of why
[1:38:23] I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm
[1:38:25] not going to I'm just going to keep
[1:38:26] reading for the time will come when they
[1:38:28] will not endure sound Doctrine but after
[1:38:30] their own lust they shall Heap to
[1:38:32] themselves
[1:38:33] teachers having itching
[1:38:35] ears and there's never been a time where
[1:38:38] that's possible now brothers and sisters
[1:38:40] you can just click on this pastor and
[1:38:42] this ministry and this pastor and this
[1:38:44] ministry and you can have a whole series
[1:38:47] of pastors and Ministries that you
[1:38:49] follow online heaping to themselves
[1:38:51] teachers having great gifts
[1:38:54] and and and I say that there's anointed
[1:38:56] tremendous Ministries way better than
[1:38:58] brother
[1:38:59] Barry but when they're preaching who are
[1:39:02] they preaching to amen what's what's
[1:39:05] being done what's the purpose of it and
[1:39:08] they shall turn away their ears from the
[1:39:10] truth and shall be turned unto
[1:39:14] fables now the spirit speaketh expressly
[1:39:17] that in the latter times some shall
[1:39:19] depart from the faith giving heed to
[1:39:20] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[1:39:22] so this sounds I'm probably going to
[1:39:24] preach on this brothers and sisters I
[1:39:26] have to this sounds like a wow a
[1:39:29] doctrine of devil it's a raging thing
[1:39:31] it's terrible you know what a doctrine
[1:39:33] of devil is I'll give you an example I
[1:39:34] just feel inspired this is the Lord here
[1:39:37] a doctrine of a devil is one word
[1:39:41] off one word off that's a doctrine of a
[1:39:45] devil isn't it wasn't that Satan that
[1:39:48] old serpent in the devil in the Garden
[1:39:50] of Eden that came and talked to Eve and
[1:39:52] got h just just just misbelieve one word
[1:39:55] thou shalt not surely
[1:39:59] die and and what' she do she became a
[1:40:02] victim of this she was actually turned
[1:40:04] away from the truth and turned to a
[1:40:06] fable what's a fable it's a story that
[1:40:09] you make up in your mind that somebody
[1:40:10] comes up with amen and it's not the word
[1:40:13] of God don't get caught up in a fable we
[1:40:17] want to make sure that we know we're in
[1:40:18] line with the word of God I should call
[1:40:21] the musicians cuz I feel like I could
[1:40:23] really just get started here I love this
[1:40:25] book it's wonderful now the spirit
[1:40:28] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[1:40:30] times some shall depart from the faith
[1:40:32] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:40:34] doctrines of devils 1 Timothy 4:1 now in
[1:40:38] every case you will notice that a false
[1:40:41] prophet is one who is outside the
[1:40:46] word love how he says that in every case
[1:40:48] you will notice that a false prophet is
[1:40:51] one who is outside the word and and
[1:40:54] brothers and sisters that's that's the
[1:40:55] ear mark That's the Hallmark that is
[1:40:57] where we live that's what we believe
[1:40:59] it's what we we we breathe it we eat it
[1:41:03] it's who we are it's the essence of who
[1:41:04] we are is understanding that we follow a
[1:41:07] prophet that pointed to the word of
[1:41:10] God that is the only way we could
[1:41:13] perceive him that we could receive him
[1:41:14] that we could understand him to be a
[1:41:16] prophet right that he pointed get back
[1:41:18] in line get back to the word that's what
[1:41:20] attracted me I I saw the pictures on the
[1:41:23] wall I saw the halo over his head the
[1:41:25] the Sam Houston Coliseum picture the
[1:41:27] pillar of fire I I saw the cloud picture
[1:41:29] I saw all these things when I first was
[1:41:31] brand new Christian and thought
[1:41:34] my they're following a man is man
[1:41:39] worship it's
[1:41:41] cultish but then I learned that you can
[1:41:45] get a hold of these messages and you can
[1:41:47] listen to them for
[1:41:48] yourself so I was given a little MP3
[1:41:51] player maybe stand with me as we close
[1:41:53] my brother-in-law gave it to me of
[1:41:56] 1965 and I listened to it over and over
[1:41:59] and over and over I was so thankful that
[1:42:01] I got that because it it just it just
[1:42:04] did something to me it let me see that
[1:42:05] all he did was point back to the word am
[1:42:08] back to the word and and I I couldn't
[1:42:10] say that he was a false prophet on any
[1:42:12] point because he pointed to
[1:42:15] Christ he simply pointed to the word of
[1:42:18] God so how could he be a false prophet
[1:42:21] anyways God bless you tonight certainly
[1:42:24] enjoy these studies it just is so
[1:42:26] inspiring amen let's just bow in prayer
[1:42:30] Heavenly Father we're so thankful that
[1:42:31] you have given us the ability to try the
[1:42:33] spirits Lord you have given us a
[1:42:36] measuring tape Lord so to speak where we
[1:42:40] can take the things that we see and we
[1:42:43] can measure them with your measure with
[1:42:47] your scale and father we know that when
[1:42:50] we measure things if if they don't fit
[1:42:52] your scale
[1:42:53] we can just leave them alone we know
[1:42:55] that they don't match your word that
[1:42:57] it's not of you because you will never
[1:43:01] deny any portion of your
[1:43:04] word father we thank you that you've
[1:43:06] given us discernment to try the spirits
[1:43:08] to know that Lord when correction comes
[1:43:11] our way that alls we do is get in
[1:43:13] line we know that you said that anyone
[1:43:17] who doesn't receive
[1:43:18] correction is not your
[1:43:21] child and it's not pleasant for the
[1:43:23] present time but what it does is it
[1:43:25] brings to pass the Peaceable fruit of
[1:43:28] righteousness in our lives and I believe
[1:43:31] that's what every one of us wants Lord
[1:43:33] and tonight I pray that Lord you would
[1:43:35] just strengthen and encourage your
[1:43:37] children as we go forwards Lord that we
[1:43:39] would be able to try the spirits yes
[1:43:42] Lord father that we would be able to
[1:43:45] exercise your spirit in our lives Lord
[1:43:49] not for great signs and wonders but Lord
[1:43:51] Jesus more than anything to apply the
[1:43:53] token we know that judgment has been
[1:43:57] declared as thus saith the Lord on this
[1:43:59] land in which we live and we know that
[1:44:02] the Death Angel is coming through the
[1:44:04] land father just like your children in
[1:44:07] Israel and Goan they were given
[1:44:09] instructions through a prophet and that
[1:44:11] Prophet told them what to do and now
[1:44:13] they had the opportunity to apply what
[1:44:16] that Prophet said or not and if they
[1:44:18] didn't do it the way the prophet said
[1:44:20] that meant that Destroyer would kill the
[1:44:23] firstborn of their homes father I pray
[1:44:26] that tonight we would take that
[1:44:28] instruction that you gave to us through
[1:44:30] a prophet you are the same yesterday
[1:44:32] today and forever Lord father help us to
[1:44:35] apply the token to our homes Lord help
[1:44:38] us to apply the token accordingly to our
[1:44:41] own lives Lord help us to understand
[1:44:44] that we are in the breach between Time
[1:44:48] and Eternity right
[1:44:50] now any moment things could change
[1:44:53] father I pray that you would help me
[1:44:54] Lord I don't claim to be perfect father
[1:44:57] I am so far from perfect I just find
[1:44:59] myself where you put me and Lord I pray
[1:45:02] that I could just stay true to you stay
[1:45:04] true to your word and encourage your
[1:45:07] children to go on to experience that
[1:45:09] full measure of your spirit Lord father
[1:45:13] we love you and we thank you tonight and
[1:45:15] we just commit each life now into your
[1:45:17] hands as we go our separate
[1:45:19] ways in jesus' name we pray amen amen
