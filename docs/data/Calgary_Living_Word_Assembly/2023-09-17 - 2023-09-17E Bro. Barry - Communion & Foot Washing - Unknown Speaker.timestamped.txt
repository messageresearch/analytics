[31:26] thank you sister Michelle for a
[31:28] wonderful special
[31:31] I think she actually heard
[31:33] what was on my heart to speak from
[31:36] tonight
[31:37] if you'll turn with me in your Bibles to
[31:39] John Saint John chapter 6.
[31:52] even if we wanted to
[31:55] we could never put ourselves here
[32:01] Saint John chapter 6 we'll start reading
[32:03] with verse 47.
[32:10] it says verily verily I say unto you he
[32:12] that believeth on me
[32:15] have everlasting life amen I am the
[32:19] bread of life
[32:21] your fathers did eat man in the
[32:23] wilderness and are dead
[32:26] here we have Jesus talking in the temple
[32:28] to the most religious people of the day
[32:32] your fathers did eat Manna in the
[32:34] wilderness and are dead
[32:37] this BR this is the bread which cometh
[32:40] down from heaven
[32:41] that a man may eat thereof and not die
[32:46] I am the living bread which came down
[32:49] from heaven If any man eat of this bread
[32:52] he shall live forever
[32:54] and the bread that I will give
[32:57] is my flesh
[32:58] which I will give for the life of the
[33:01] world
[33:03] the Jews therefore strove amongst
[33:05] themselves saying how can this man give
[33:07] his flesh to
[33:09] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[33:11] I say unto you except you eat the Flesh
[33:14] of the son of man and drink his blood ye
[33:16] have no life in you
[33:19] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[33:22] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[33:25] him up at the last day
[33:28] for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood
[33:31] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[33:35] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[33:38] I in him
[33:40] as the living father hath sent me
[33:43] and I live by the father
[33:45] so he that eateth me
[33:47] shall he live by me
[33:51] this is the bread which came down from
[33:53] heaven
[33:55] not as your fathers did eat Manna and
[33:58] are dead
[34:00] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[34:02] forever
[34:04] these things saith he in the synagogue
[34:06] as he taught in Capernaum
[34:09] many therefore of his disciples when
[34:12] they heard this
[34:14] said this is a hard saying
[34:17] who can hear it
[34:19] when Jesus knew in himself that his
[34:21] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[34:25] them do this offend you
[34:28] what and if ye shall see the son of man
[34:32] Ascend up where he was before
[34:35] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[34:38] flesh profiteth nothing
[34:40] the words that I speak unto you they are
[34:43] spirit and they are life
[34:46] but there are some of you that believe
[34:48] not
[34:50] where Jesus knew from the beginning who
[34:52] they were that believed not and who
[34:54] should betray him
[34:56] and he said therefore
[34:59] said I unto you that no man can come
[35:01] unto me except it were given unto him of
[35:05] my father from that time many of his
[35:08] disciples went back and walked with him
[35:11] walked
[35:12] and walked no more with him
[35:16] then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye
[35:19] also go away
[35:21] then Simon Peter answered him Lord to
[35:23] whom shall we go thou Hast the words of
[35:26] eternal life
[35:28] and we believe and are sure that thou
[35:31] art that Christ the son of the Living
[35:34] God
[35:36] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[35:39] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Tonight We
[35:41] Believe
[35:43] Lord and that's why we're here
[35:45] but father we just pray that you would
[35:47] speak to us as we've said already just
[35:49] one more word father just one more time
[35:52] lord just a little bit of inspiration to
[35:54] help us go just a little further down
[35:56] this road
[35:57] and father we'll be careful to give you
[35:59] all the praise we ask that you would
[36:01] just bless the remainder of this service
[36:03] now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[36:06] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[36:10] try not to
[36:12] keep us too long
[36:14] I thought I would try something
[36:15] different and use this microphone here
[36:18] I'm not really used to it
[36:21] I might just grab one of these ones
[36:26] foreign
[36:29] is this okay it's working all right
[36:33] tonight I just want to talk about
[36:34] communion I want to talk about this uh
[36:36] this story a little bit I just think
[36:39] there's so many things in here at the
[36:41] beginning of it he says unto them that
[36:44] he that believeth on me half everlasting
[36:46] life John 6 47 and right at the end of
[36:50] it
[36:51] isn't it interesting verse 69
[36:55] and we believe and are sure that thou
[36:58] art the Christ the son of the Living God
[37:01] is that what we have here who we have
[37:03] here tonight in the midst we have
[37:05] Believers here in the church that
[37:08] believe that he is the Christ the son of
[37:10] the Living God
[37:12] I just I I think it's amazing when we
[37:15] look at this because we know that Jesus
[37:17] wasn't talking about them being a
[37:19] vampire but we know brother Branham
[37:21] brought it out very clearly that that's
[37:22] what they thought oh this man's a
[37:24] vampire obviously it's a terrible thing
[37:27] in in in the Hebrew Customs to deal with
[37:31] blood and to deal with flesh of a dead
[37:33] man I mean how could you eat the Flesh
[37:35] of a man that was alive he would have to
[37:37] be dead and if you touch a dead man you
[37:39] have a cleansing period and then to eat
[37:41] it drink the blood it was just an
[37:42] offense for him to say that to him but
[37:45] he was saying it with intent it was a
[37:47] very intentional saying because I
[37:49] believe tonight he was then he was
[37:52] speaking about tonight he was talking
[37:53] about a time where there could be an
[37:55] observance of his body
[37:58] and you know in the in the message
[37:59] communion brother Branham brings it out
[38:01] in 1965 1212.
[38:05] it's one of the last messages that
[38:07] brother Branham preached it's it's very
[38:09] interesting first he teaches leadership
[38:12] and uh
[38:14] it's interesting because if we can't be
[38:16] led we've said it before then there's no
[38:18] communion
[38:19] if we can't have leadership in our lives
[38:21] of the Holy Ghost there's no communion
[38:23] if we can't follow the word of the Lord
[38:25] for our day then we're not having
[38:27] communion we can think intellectually
[38:30] that we're having communion with the
[38:32] Lord but if we're not following the word
[38:34] then we're following a god of our own
[38:37] imagination and that's not a good place
[38:39] to be
[38:40] But Here We Are Tonight amongst the
[38:42] Believers isn't it wonderful to think
[38:45] that we are truly following the word of
[38:47] God we would fit that verse 69 and we
[38:49] believe and are sure that thou art that
[38:53] Christ the son of the Living God what an
[38:56] amazing thought that is to think that we
[38:58] are sure that he is that one we're
[39:01] staking our lives on it we're staking
[39:03] our families on it we're staking our
[39:06] businesses on it everything that we do
[39:08] in our lives is hinged upon this thought
[39:11] we are sure that he is that one what a
[39:15] tremendous thought that is out of
[39:17] communion uh 65 12 12. brother Bradham
[39:21] says now I do believe that communion or
[39:24] what we call communion now is to talk is
[39:28] the Lord's Supper many times uh people
[39:31] would say that
[39:32] I had heard it before and I thought wow
[39:34] the Lord's Supper that was somewhere in
[39:37] in Jerusalem wasn't it where he had the
[39:39] 12 disciples but that's what we do when
[39:42] we observe communion we're actually
[39:44] taking part in that last supper in the
[39:46] Lord's Supper he goes on to say now we
[39:49] only have three physical Divine orders
[39:52] left to us one of them is communion
[39:56] feet washing water baptism that's the
[39:59] only three things
[40:01] imagine that it's pretty simple isn't it
[40:03] if you think about how the Hebrews were
[40:05] given the law that was not simple that
[40:08] was very complicated and I I wonder if
[40:10] very many of them could keep the law
[40:12] entirely I don't think anyone could keep
[40:15] the law entirely and it was set up that
[40:17] way on purpose people could keep most of
[40:18] the law and and some of them were
[40:21] extraordinary and could keep almost all
[40:24] of it but they still had something
[40:25] inside of their heart that wasn't right
[40:28] but here as Gentiles we've been given
[40:31] three physical Divine orders left to us
[40:32] one of them as communion feet washing
[40:34] water baptism that's the only three
[40:36] things that's the Perfection of the
[40:39] three see
[40:40] and that's the only three orders we have
[40:43] we realize that that was the issue given
[40:47] by Saint Paul in the New Testament now
[40:50] if we would say the communion should
[40:53] just be taking the word
[40:55] I don't believe anyone has a right to
[40:58] take the Lord's Supper until he has
[41:00] taken the word of the Lord into his
[41:03] heart
[41:05] see because I'm going I'll read
[41:07] something for you in a few moments and
[41:09] you'll see now notice then why then
[41:12] would we we would on the same basis we
[41:16] could absolutely justify the Salvation
[41:18] Army they do not believe in any form of
[41:21] water baptism said we don't need it
[41:24] now if we don't need water baptism why
[41:26] are we baptized
[41:28] said the water can't save you but the
[41:30] blood saves you
[41:32] I'll agree with that
[41:34] that's right the blood saves you not the
[41:37] water
[41:38] but we must take the water as an outward
[41:41] emotion of an inwardly work of Grace has
[41:45] been done see
[41:47] so must we on communion
[41:51] many times we have heard it said you can
[41:54] see the church full on Sunday morning
[41:55] but come Sunday night when it's
[41:57] communion time the church is empty I
[41:59] want to say God bless you because the
[42:01] church is almost full tonight and we
[42:03] didn't harp on communion this morning
[42:05] it's wonderful because it's a desire in
[42:07] the heart of the believer to come and
[42:10] follow the ordinances that God has given
[42:12] us
[42:13] so must we on communion it's beautiful
[42:16] because it's truly an outward expression
[42:19] of the inward work we can get baptized
[42:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[42:25] and for the remission of our sins and we
[42:27] can follow that ordinance but sometimes
[42:29] it can be difficult to come to the
[42:31] communion table I want to say brothers
[42:33] and sisters don't let the devil rob you
[42:35] of the blessing of coming to the
[42:36] communion table Satan will say oh you've
[42:39] got this thing in your life maybe
[42:40] there's this thing maybe you shouldn't
[42:42] have done this or you should have
[42:43] tarried you should have gone to that
[42:44] brother or that sister and made that
[42:46] thing right do that go and make that
[42:48] thing right but run to the communion
[42:49] table don't let anything stop you from
[42:52] it there's a major blessing in store and
[42:55] you know it might not even be something
[42:56] that we can tangibly understand maybe
[42:58] there's going to be a severe spiritual
[43:01] attack on your children tomorrow morning
[43:04] when they go to school but because you
[43:06] chose to come to the communion table and
[43:08] partake in the Lord's Supper the body of
[43:11] Jesus Christ following the instructions
[43:13] where all the Jews were offended by him
[43:16] because you chose to follow him you
[43:19] could be fortifying your life fortifying
[43:21] your family fortifying your home
[43:24] that's why we say there's so much more
[43:26] blessing in store for those people that
[43:28] tithe I don't want to pull on tithing I
[43:31] think we'll probably have our Treasurer
[43:33] come and do a presentation about tithing
[43:35] somewhere in the near future but
[43:36] brothers and sisters the blessing isn't
[43:38] about money that's only a small portion
[43:41] the blessing is all about the the
[43:43] blessing of God having Jesus Christ in
[43:45] your life every single place you go when
[43:47] you apply the token to your life
[43:49] Remember full obedience to the entire
[43:53] word of God
[43:54] entitles you to the Token not most of
[43:57] the word of God the entire word of God
[44:00] he goes on to say when we have taken the
[44:02] Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter
[44:06] of spiritual birth into us and his body
[44:09] we live by him by the word we also
[44:13] should symbolize it because it's a
[44:15] commandment
[44:16] repent every one of you be baptized in
[44:18] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[44:19] remission of your sins Paul said I have
[44:21] received of the Lord that which I also
[44:23] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[44:25] the same night in which he was betrayed
[44:27] took bread and break it and gave it to
[44:28] the disciples and said take eat this do
[44:31] in remembrance of me
[44:34] can you imagine what they must have
[44:35] thought when he was telling him that
[44:38] this do in remembrance of me he they
[44:41] must have been thinking truly this guy
[44:43] maybe is a vampire maybe some of the
[44:44] murmuring we heard by these most
[44:46] religious people could be true because
[44:49] he's not stopping with this first he
[44:50] said it in the temple and now we're
[44:52] having supper with him and he's doing it
[44:53] again he's saying take this and eat this
[44:56] this flesh this is a bread is my flesh
[44:59] what
[45:00] this do in remembrance of me for as
[45:03] often as you take this bread you show
[45:06] forth his death till he comes
[45:09] now we find out that in that they had
[45:12] people who come
[45:14] and we have the opportunity tonight
[45:16] brothers and sisters to come to follow
[45:18] the instruction of the Lord to follow
[45:20] the ordinance that he's given one of the
[45:23] three
[45:24] two of the three actually sorry we've
[45:26] all been baptized in the name of the
[45:27] Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of
[45:29] our sins if you haven't I strongly
[45:30] recommend that you do and I I would
[45:32] recommend that you don't come to the
[45:33] Lord's table until you have done that do
[45:36] that first and then come to the Lord's
[45:38] table and that's what we instruct the
[45:39] children to do I think that many parents
[45:42] have sometimes a little bit different
[45:43] view on that and I wouldn't want to step
[45:45] on anybody's toes or or ever Implement
[45:48] my own thoughts on how you should raise
[45:49] your children you do that according to
[45:51] the Holy Ghost leadership in your life
[45:52] that's what I would say but as for us in
[45:55] our home we have told our children you
[45:57] can't come to the communion table until
[45:59] you first are baptized in the name of
[46:01] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[46:03] of your sins then you shall receive the
[46:05] gift of the Holy Ghost and by following
[46:07] the ordinances of the Lord I guarantee
[46:10] you you'll get the Holy Ghost and you
[46:12] know what I would say this if you want
[46:14] to actually follow the ordinance as you
[46:16] potentially already have the Holy Ghost
[46:18] or you wouldn't want to
[46:22] but the Branham goes on to say in
[46:23] communion
[46:25] now when we take this communion
[46:28] it isn't just the thing say I'm coming
[46:31] up here and going to eat some bread and
[46:33] I'll believe I'm a Christian
[46:35] but if you notice
[46:37] the Bible said he that eateth and
[46:39] drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of
[46:43] the blood and the body of the Lord
[46:46] that makes it pretty heavy that makes it
[46:48] really serious it gets really sobering
[46:50] really quickly when you look at that
[46:54] I just love the way brother Bradham says
[46:56] it here and you know I kind of half
[46:57] wanted to play this whole service
[46:59] communion service tonight but I didn't
[47:01] want to take too long so I figured I
[47:03] would just cover some of the highlights
[47:04] but he says you don't want to you don't
[47:07] want to do this you don't want to eat
[47:08] and drink unworthily you'll be guilty of
[47:11] the blood and the body of the Lord he
[47:12] says see you've got to live a life that
[47:15] before the people that before God and
[47:19] the people that shows you are that you
[47:23] are sincere
[47:25] so it's not just coming to the communion
[47:27] table and saying bless God I believe the
[47:30] message of the hour I've been baptized
[47:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I I
[47:33] follow all of the message of the hour
[47:35] and I just come and I take the communion
[47:37] bread and I I drink the communion wine
[47:39] and I go back to my seed and everything
[47:40] is good but yet I'm living a life that's
[47:43] a double standard that's something extra
[47:45] to what the word of God shows don't want
[47:48] to do that
[47:49] we want to be edifying the Lord we want
[47:52] to be living a life worthy of the Gospel
[47:54] so that not just we feel it the people
[47:57] around us who are the closest to us they
[48:01] witness that
[48:02] because it's pretty easy to be polished
[48:05] up I'll say polished up I don't polish
[48:08] up well but I'll say polish that we can
[48:09] be polished up in public when we go to
[48:11] church when we go to work when we go to
[48:13] school oh my but who are we want to be
[48:15] behind closed doors when it's just us
[48:18] and our family or or just us alone who
[48:21] are we in that circumstance that's who
[48:24] we really are that's the real you that's
[48:26] the real me when we're in private
[48:29] brother Branham says you want to show
[48:31] that you are that sincere and you know
[48:34] we know talk is cheap but I want to say
[48:36] this sometimes in our lives we can have
[48:38] circumstances that maybe cause us to act
[48:41] a certain way maybe we've had something
[48:43] happen to us that's really hurt us in
[48:45] our life that can cause us to act a
[48:48] certain way somebody could say something
[48:49] to us a certain way and it will cause us
[48:51] to react a certain way because of a deep
[48:54] down hurt that's inside of us now I
[48:56] don't want to get psychological tonight
[48:57] but I want to say it this way sometimes
[49:00] we have human nature
[49:03] that human nature gets in the way how
[49:05] many times should we forgive one another
[49:09] I think it's Point what is it four four
[49:12] seven or four nine
[49:13] times a minute
[49:15] we broke that down
[49:18] it's it's it's a lot of times so many
[49:21] times that there's no way that we could
[49:23] ever not forgive someone in our lives
[49:25] and that's pretty hard but you know what
[49:27] it takes to do that not human kind we
[49:30] can't do that on our own that takes the
[49:31] spirit of Jesus Christ Living out
[49:33] through us that's the Holy Ghost only
[49:35] that will give us the ability to
[49:37] overcome
[49:38] sometimes we deal with The Human
[49:40] Condition I don't want to act like I'm
[49:42] pretending like it's it's it's Pie in
[49:45] the Sky here we're human beings living
[49:47] in this world and we sometimes we make a
[49:50] mess of things but you know what the
[49:51] believer does the believer goes and
[49:53] makes it right the believer doesn't just
[49:55] let it fester and come to the communion
[49:57] table and say hey I'm a Christian you
[49:58] know everything's fine I'm out there no
[50:00] no no no no when that happens brothers
[50:02] and sisters you're eating and drinking
[50:03] damnation potentially you're doing it
[50:06] unworthily we need to just make it right
[50:10] and then we'll unlock the power of this
[50:12] of showing God that we believe
[50:15] he goes on to say you don't take the
[50:17] Lord's Supper by a tradition
[50:19] if you're doing it by a tradition don't
[50:21] do it by a tradition
[50:22] I don't want to say if you're doing it
[50:24] by a tradition and you've always done it
[50:25] by a tradition don't come up here
[50:27] tonight and do it by a tradition I want
[50:29] to say just throw that tradition out and
[50:31] come up here tonight and do it under
[50:33] maybe a new revelation that you're
[50:35] actually
[50:36] partaking of the Lord's body because
[50:39] I've said it before I'll say it tonight
[50:40] who is actually serving the communion
[50:42] tonight if these brothers here have the
[50:44] Holy Ghost In Their Lives who is
[50:46] actually serving you this Lord's body
[50:48] and when we go to wash feet in the in
[50:50] the foot washing portion of it whose
[50:52] feet are you really washing and who is
[50:55] actually washing your feet
[50:57] it's not just human beings here
[51:00] you don't take the Lord's Supper by a
[51:02] tradition you take it because of it's
[51:04] the love of God in your heart keeping
[51:07] the Commandments of God see that's what
[51:09] you take it for so if you so you don't
[51:13] take it in so if you don't take it in
[51:16] sincerity
[51:17] just it's a tradition well our church
[51:20] observes communion once every Sunday or
[51:22] once every month or twice a year and you
[51:24] go up say well it's my time and then
[51:27] take the communion why it's a stink to
[51:29] God see that's just a tradition even
[51:33] like anything else you've got to be
[51:36] sincere God wants the depths of your
[51:38] heart remember the very God that brought
[51:40] you here on Earth is the one you're
[51:43] serving see
[51:45] you're doing this because he said so
[51:47] because it's his order
[51:49] then we want to come up with deepness of
[51:52] sincerity knowing that by God's grace
[51:55] that we have been saved
[51:58] and we love him and we field his
[52:01] presence anybody feel this presence
[52:03] tonight
[52:04] with the specials that we heard with
[52:07] with the songs that were sung
[52:09] we see that it changed our lives our
[52:13] whole being is changed we're different
[52:16] people we don't live like we used to we
[52:20] don't think like we used to
[52:23] we know that Paul said when I was a
[52:25] child I I thought as a child and I lived
[52:29] like a child and I did childish things
[52:31] but when the spirit of Christ started to
[52:33] take hold in my life and that see Gene
[52:35] of God got watered by the word for my
[52:38] day and started to grow a maturity
[52:41] started to take hold in my life and the
[52:42] things which I once did as a child I no
[52:45] longer did I put them aside because I'm
[52:48] no longer seeing through a glass Darkly
[52:50] but face to face my goodness brothers
[52:53] and sisters that takes it to a whole new
[52:55] level we're not just coming to church to
[52:57] come to church we're coming to church to
[52:59] fellowship with that one that we know is
[53:02] the Christ that that one that we believe
[53:04] and are sure of that is the Christ the
[53:07] son of the Living God my goodness when
[53:09] we can get that Revelation in our hearts
[53:11] it just gives us the ability to worship
[53:13] freely it gives us the ability to push
[53:15] aside the cares of this life and say no
[53:17] there's one thing that I want to do and
[53:19] that is to go to church because that's
[53:20] where my blessing lies that's where the
[53:22] true blessing of the Lord is now some
[53:25] people might argue and say you could
[53:27] just play a tape and I believe that
[53:28] there's a blessing in the tape but we
[53:30] know that there's a five-fold Ministry
[53:31] for the perfecting of the Saints and we
[53:34] can't change the word of God we don't
[53:35] want to try and manipulate that I don't
[53:36] want to go too far with that tonight he
[53:38] goes on to say then when we come to the
[53:41] Lord's table we must come in reverence
[53:44] love and respect
[53:48] reverence love and respect and I say
[53:52] that tonight and I just want to say it
[53:54] this way I think it could be easy to
[53:56] just say we want to come in reverence of
[53:58] the Lord in love for the Lord and
[54:00] respect for the Lord but how will the
[54:02] world know that you love me
[54:06] how will the world know that you love me
[54:09] when you've got love one for another
[54:12] when you've got respect one for another
[54:15] when when you have reverence one for
[54:19] another because you recognize the spirit
[54:21] of Christ in your brother and in your
[54:23] sister and maybe you can actually see it
[54:26] entirely but brothers and sisters the
[54:28] prophet of God said we'll never live
[54:30] above our confession
[54:32] so let's confess that that's our brother
[54:34] and our sister in Christ Jesus and not
[54:37] just someone that we associate with at
[54:38] church
[54:40] but truly the manifested word for our
[54:43] day right here in the young people
[54:45] sitting in the front row right there in
[54:48] the old people sitting in the back row I
[54:50] know you're not that old but
[54:52] you know what I'm saying
[54:55] then when we come to the Lord's table we
[54:57] must come in reverence look love and
[55:00] respect of look where we would have been
[55:03] if it hadn't been for him
[55:07] see look where he would have been he
[55:10] says
[55:11] I think it's just amazing because that's
[55:13] the song we heard
[55:14] isn't that wonderful
[55:17] that's the Lord
[55:19] he goes on to say that's the trouble of
[55:21] us today what I I think I'm saying us me
[55:25] and the church that the Lord God has let
[55:27] me speak to in these last hours that we
[55:29] believe were in the closing time we
[55:31] believe that God has given us a message
[55:33] it's being ordained of God it's proven
[55:36] of God it's been showed of God now we
[55:38] must come to him with reverence and love
[55:40] and with purity of heart and mind and
[55:43] soul we don't come to the Church of of
[55:45] the Living God and just come in as a
[55:48] tradition just drag our carcass in and
[55:49] do our duty and leave it's a stink in
[55:53] the nose of God when we do that
[55:56] but I want to say if that's all you got
[55:58] still come
[56:00] why do I say that I'll say it because
[56:03] you get Washed by the Water of the word
[56:05] and if you don't come to church you're
[56:07] going to keep that stink
[56:09] but you know we need to make sure that
[56:11] we've got the right attitude and I think
[56:12] it's beautiful that we have the prophet
[56:14] of God saying these words because he's
[56:17] wanting us to line up with the word to
[56:19] make sure that we have the right
[56:20] attitude again I'll say it brothers and
[56:22] sisters don't ever let the devil rob you
[56:24] of the blessing of this communion table
[56:25] don't ever let them do it because if
[56:27] something happens in our lives and we
[56:29] say I can't come to the communion table
[56:31] it's not because God's saying stay away
[56:33] from the communion table he said come
[56:35] and eat take eat this is my body do this
[56:38] in remembrance of me he didn't say oh
[56:40] don't eat it because you've got a bad
[56:41] attitude because something happened he
[56:43] said come and do it so we need to do the
[56:45] work we need to do the harder work to
[56:47] make sure that we can come and do it
[56:49] he goes on to say you know the hour will
[56:52] soon arise when the when right Among Us
[56:54] will be the holy spirit will speak out
[56:57] like it did in honest ananias and
[56:59] Sapphira does everybody remember that
[57:01] story I won't go too far into it but the
[57:04] discernment of the Lord was in the
[57:06] people and they were able to discern
[57:08] what these people were doing these
[57:09] people were claiming to be Believers but
[57:11] they just held a little bit back they
[57:12] were just call them a little bit cheap
[57:13] they were a little bit tight with their
[57:15] money they figured you know what I don't
[57:16] have to give it all I can keep a little
[57:18] bit for myself and instead of actually
[57:20] following the leadership of the Lord
[57:21] which was the instruction of the Prophet
[57:23] for the day what they did was they just
[57:24] got a little tight wad with their money
[57:26] and and it cost them both their lives
[57:29] both of them died because they said you
[57:32] know oh we did everything right we did
[57:34] exactly what we're supposed to do
[57:36] and we know they said to him this is the
[57:38] Holy Ghost said to them are you sure you
[57:40] did
[57:40] and again they lied and you know they
[57:45] died for it but brother Branham is
[57:47] saying here there will come another time
[57:48] with ananias and Sapphira it's on the
[57:51] way remember see that hour is arriving
[57:54] see and we are now you just remember
[57:58] that see that God is going to dwell
[58:00] among his people that's what he wants to
[58:03] do now I think it's so beautiful he's
[58:06] talking about this in the communion
[58:08] service talking about coming to this
[58:11] table recognizing this is the spirit of
[58:13] the Living God we're talking about this
[58:15] is the Lord Jesus Christ's body we're
[58:17] talking about it's not just a tradition
[58:19] or something that our parents tell us to
[58:21] do so we do it we've just done it all
[58:23] our lives so we just go and do it this
[58:24] is serious business ananias and Sapphira
[58:27] it was life or death
[58:29] and you know what happened they chose
[58:31] death
[58:33] because they wanted to be deceitful
[58:35] we don't want to be deceitful
[58:37] we know the word of God says to let a
[58:39] man examine himself
[58:40] don't examine your brother and your
[58:42] sister examine himself
[58:44] Dig Down find out if there's something
[58:46] in there and if there is just make it
[58:48] right that's all and you know if you go
[58:51] to make it right and someone won't allow
[58:53] you to make it right that's not on you
[58:54] anymore
[58:55] because you followed the word of God if
[58:57] they choose to actually not forgive then
[58:59] you know who's ever sins you remit
[59:01] they're remitted but whoever sins you
[59:03] retain uh oh
[59:05] someone's gonna keep them
[59:08] goes on to say now we know it's right
[59:10] but see don't do it from an intellectual
[59:12] standpoint
[59:14] if you do you've got a second hand
[59:16] religion see
[59:19] if we're doing it from our minds it's
[59:22] just because someone said to do it
[59:24] but when we can do it from our heart we
[59:26] recognize that's what God said to do and
[59:29] there's a blessing in store a big
[59:30] blessing in store he says if you do you
[59:33] got a second-hand religion see we don't
[59:36] want a second-handed religion something
[59:38] that somebody else has experienced it
[59:40] and we are living off of their testimony
[59:45] we don't want that
[59:47] remember I've said it before we know
[59:49] that brother Branham said that you can
[59:50] have the Holy Ghost every hour of your
[59:53] life and still go to hell how can that
[59:55] possibly be I would say this because you
[59:58] have a second-handed experience because
[1:00:01] you haven't met him for yourself but
[1:00:04] when you truly get the baptism of the
[1:00:06] Holy Ghost what happens is you follow
[1:00:08] the word of God at all costs nothing
[1:00:11] will stand in your way from being
[1:00:13] completely obedient to the word of God
[1:00:16] we don't want to have a second-handed
[1:00:17] experienced brothers and sisters we want
[1:00:19] to have a first-hand relationship with
[1:00:21] the Lord Jesus Christ isn't it wonderful
[1:00:23] to think we we could try and try and try
[1:00:26] maybe we could set a challenge and see
[1:00:29] who in the group here could actually get
[1:00:30] an audience with Justin Trudeau
[1:00:34] maybe it would take a day a week a year
[1:00:36] a month
[1:00:37] 10 years to get an audience maybe never
[1:00:40] I would think probably likely never
[1:00:42] unless we're connected somehow right but
[1:00:45] yet we have a direct line all we have to
[1:00:47] do is actually clear our hearts and come
[1:00:48] sincerely and we can talk to the king of
[1:00:50] the universe the King of Kings and the
[1:00:52] Lord of lords oh my we can focus our
[1:00:55] prayers goodness
[1:00:57] we've been called unto adoption
[1:01:00] for that purpose what a tremendous
[1:01:02] opportunity he is I just want to
[1:01:04] encourage us tonight brothers and
[1:01:05] sisters we want to take this serious we
[1:01:07] don't want it to be a tradition we want
[1:01:09] to make sure that we have full sincerity
[1:01:11] and reverence and love in our hearts
[1:01:14] when we come to this communion table
[1:01:15] maybe stand with me tonight as we change
[1:01:18] the order of the service we'll have the
[1:01:20] communion service then we'll uh
[1:01:24] then we'll actually uh we'll do the
[1:01:26] testimonies and foot washing
[1:01:29] but remember it's just because his grace
[1:01:31] just because he called us before the
[1:01:33] foundation of the world I'll call you
[1:01:35] out brother Joel that's okay
[1:01:42] we'll uh just go to him in prayer
[1:01:46] after we read here
[1:01:48] maybe turn in your Bibles with me to
[1:01:51] First Corinthians
[1:01:55] chapter 11.
[1:02:01] if we could
[1:02:03] when we do the communion we'll sing that
[1:02:05] song marvelous Grace
[1:02:12] verse 23 of First Corinthians chapter
[1:02:15] 11.
[1:02:20] this is Paul here now
[1:02:23] Prophet following up with the words that
[1:02:26] Jesus spoke in the temple that we read
[1:02:28] in John chapter 6.
[1:02:30] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:02:32] which I also delivered unto you that the
[1:02:34] Lord Jesus
[1:02:36] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:02:38] he took bread
[1:02:40] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:02:42] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:02:44] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:02:46] of me
[1:02:48] after the same manner also he took the
[1:02:50] cup
[1:02:51] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:02:54] the New Testament in my blood
[1:02:56] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:02:59] remembrance of me
[1:03:01] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:03:04] drink this cup
[1:03:05] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:03:07] come
[1:03:09] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:03:11] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:03:12] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:03:16] and blood of the Lord
[1:03:18] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:03:21] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:03:23] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:03:26] unworthily Edith and drink his damnation
[1:03:28] to himself
[1:03:30] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:03:33] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:03:36] among you
[1:03:37] and many sleep
[1:03:39] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:03:41] should not be judged but when we are
[1:03:42] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:03:44] we should not be condemned with the
[1:03:46] world
[1:03:48] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:03:50] together to eat Terry one for another
[1:03:54] and if any man hunger let him eat it
[1:03:55] home
[1:03:56] that you come not together unto
[1:03:58] condemnation
[1:03:59] and the rest well I said in order when I
[1:04:02] come
[1:04:04] just take a minute or two and tarry one
[1:04:06] for another and we've said it many times
[1:04:08] if if there's somebody that needs to
[1:04:10] talk to somebody by all means this is
[1:04:12] the time there's no judgment this is
[1:04:15] actually following the word of God I
[1:04:17] think that we would be ecstatic to see
[1:04:18] someone follow the word of God let's
[1:04:20] just take a minute or two and tarry one
[1:04:22] for another
[1:04:23] before we proceed
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:42] foreign
[1:04:52] [Music]
