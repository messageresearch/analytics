We know that we we don't know how many more times we're going to be able to do this. The way the world is, the condition that it's in, the birth pains that it's going through, &gt;&gt; we know that it can't stand very much more. And yet, we have the opportunity to turn our eyes upon Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you each one. Certainly like to welcome the Robson family here from Arizona. God bless you. If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by wave an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you for this day. Thank you for this opportunity one more time to gather together, Lord, in the name above every name. The name that causes demons to tremble. And Father, tonight we don't just gather around your name, but Father, we gather around your life &gt;&gt; because it's the life behind the name &gt;&gt; that makes the demons tremble. &gt;&gt; And we know that it's the life behind the name that gives us the very breath in our lungs, the very spark in our minds, Lord, and the life promise in our soul. So, Father, tonight Lord, as we go forwards in this service, we just want to reverence you, Lord, as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the author and the finisher of our faith. And Lord Jesus, if there's a need in our midst tonight, Father, we pray that you would sovereignly meet it according to your will, which is your word. And Father, we'll be careful to give you the praise. Lord Jesus, we know that your word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. Oh, Father, that it's able to, Lord, move between the joints and the marrow, Lord, to get right between, Lord Jesus, the soul and the spirit. And, Father, to make it right to that place, Lord, that you had before the foundation of the world, created in every one of our hearts, Lord, that space that you made for yourself, Lord. Father, we pray that your word would just discern our hearts tonight, Father. That Lord Jesus, you would go from row to row, from chair to chair, from Lord, seat to seat, from heart to heart, Lord, and discern us tonight, Father. Lord Jesus, we pray that you would speak to us sovereignly now as we go forwards. We thank you for meeting the needs, Lord. Thank you for watching over us. We pray that you would be with all those who are traveling. Lord, we know that the roads are busy this time of year. And Lord, we need your traveling mercies. And we rely upon you. We trust you, Lord. We know that your word says that your angels are encamped about those who fear you. And Lord, we just are so thankful that we can trust you that way. Tonight, Lord, we pray that you would just be glorified now in all that's said and done, Lord, as we go forwards with you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. Certainly good to see everyone once again. We've had some traveling lives and ourabesses. Certainly good to see you. And each one if you have your Bibles tonight, I'd just like to read from two places. Romans chapter 4 and then we'll turn over to Genesis 12. Romans 4 verse 16. Genesis 12 verse 1. Romans 4 verse 16. Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations. before him whom he believed, even God, who quickenth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. And we know that she was 90 years old, 10 years younger. Verse 20, he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. &gt;&gt; And therefore, it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now it was not written for his sake alone. Glory to God. But it was imputed to him. But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification. My goodness. Glory to God. Let's turn over to Genesis 12. Just three verses here. Genesis 12. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, even before he had his name change, Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that cursseeth thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we stand here as willing recipients of this word that we have read tonight, Lord, knowing that we do believe the one that that was that was brutally sacrificed for our offenses, Lord, and was risen again for our justification. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, Father, tonight we pray that you would bless this word as we go forwards, Lord, that you would be glorified in all that's said and done. that you would quicken this word to the hearer, Lord, and to the speaker, Father. Let us be as one, Father. Just one conduit connected to you tonight. &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you all the praise. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Welcome everyone to the house of the Lord and another opportunity just to give him glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just thinking about this here. You know, Abraham, we know full well in Romans chapter 4 that he staggered not at the promise of God's unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God. That man who was called by name, who had a name change, who was a backslider, a prophet who was a backsliding prophet of God, he staggered. He staggered. But you know, the beautiful part is he staggered not at the promise of God &gt;&gt; through unbelief. And I think that's just a real key. It's been such an encouragement for me in my life, and my walk to know that this prophet of God staggered. We all stagger, but let's not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief. &gt;&gt; We know this flesh is going to let us down. We know this flesh is cursed. There's no way this flesh will ever inherit incorruption. And many times I think that we strive to try and act like this flesh somehow someway should be holy. This flesh will never be holy. It's the soul inside of us that's holy. And that soul contains the spirit of God. That is what is holy. And the difference between ourselves and the rest of this world is that we have that spirit within us that says amen to the word of God. But not just with our lips, but with our hearts causing this flesh to live a holy life. Now, this flesh will live a holy life and it will defy all of the sinful gravity that's in this world. Now, I'm not talking about the law of gravity that would hold the planets in orbit. What I am saying is that this flesh has a gravitational pull, spiritually speaking, towards sin, which will cause us to stagger. But that doesn't change the promise of God in our soul. Oh my. Tonight, I want to speak on the covenant. I was just so encouraged by this wedding that we participated in on the weekend, Brother Logan and Sister Neve, and to see how God brought the two souls together. And and we know that we heard brother Menow say it on Sunday. I think it's so good that, you know, a marriage is not a contract. &gt;&gt; It's not a contractual obligation. It's not an obligation. And it's not something that we enter into so that we can actually just benefit something out of it. It's not a document that we take and we hang on our wall. Marriage is a covenant and it is until death do us part. But you know we know the devil creeps in. The devil loves to creep in. The devil loves to try and speak to us in ways that will reason situations in our lives. A and I think it's amazing how we can be the bride of Jesus Christ who are so thankful that he will never ever ever put us away. But sometimes you hear folks talk about how they have the right to put away their wife. And sure enough they do. But doesn't Jesus have the right to put away us? Shouldn't he have the right to put us away, to kick us out the door? If we look at the way things are in our lives, every one of us are are are born in sin shaped and iniquity, come into this world speaking lies. None of us are righteous. We only rely upon his grace. &gt;&gt; There's no holy walk that's going to walk our way out of here into heaven. There's nothing that we can do to merit this grace. Just take a look in Romans. Take a look in Ephesians. It's all by his grace that we're saved through faith. But talking about this covenant, I just I got so encouraged as I I mentioned that, you know, it's such an amazing thing to look at a marriage. And sometimes we can get so so caught up in our own lives. You know, brother Brandham, he talks about it how maybe in our spiritual walk, we can get our eagle eyes filmed over. Sometimes the the life inside of us grows a little bit dim. Maybe that lamp grows a little bit dim. For those people that know about the lamp and and how you can burn a lamp with oil, burn a oil lamp. Sometimes if you don't adjust that wick with a little dial, it can actually start to burn dark and it will actually carbon up and and and cloud that lamp. And that lamp still has the fire burning, but it's not burning bright. And sometimes we just need to actually adjust that wick. We need to clean the lens. We need to make adjustments in our lives. And brother Bradam talk tells a story about the eagle and how sometimes the eagle eye can get filmed over spiritually speaking. Sometimes that can happen in our marriages. Sometimes it can happen in our relationship. Sometimes it can happen in our spiritual walks. We can just get our little eagle eye filmed over and we begin to forget about who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing that is for us to do. I'm just going to start tonight by reading a quote and it's out of 1954. I think I sent it, brother. Did you get it? 1954. The unconditional covenant that God made with the people. The unconditional covenant that God made with the people. Brother Brown, I mean, he just says right at the very beginning of this message, and I'm not going to do a bunch of quotes tonight. I feel like preaching and uh I'm just going to go with the the inspiration. But brother Brandham, he says, "What a promise. Now, in dealing with the Pentecostal people, and if God willing, when coming back, I have found the weak spot of Pentecostal people by God's help." that is you're scared. That's right. That's true. Now, I just couldn't help but think as I was listening to this, you know, this is food that's stored up for a season. This is not just him talking about some people will say it and and if that's as far as the revelation goes, I guess that's the way it needs to be. Excuse me. But I can't help but think when I listen to this, just like reading God's word, I've got to put myself there. And I like to think I understand the Pentecostal people is not just a group of denominational folks, even though that's what brother Brandham would be referring to there. But when we listen to this with revelation, with the the ability to to maybe listen between the lines, listen between the words, I think that brother Bradam could be speaking to a Pentecostal people who have a Pentecostal experience. They're not part of a Pentecostal denomination. We know that he said full well that rapturing faith lies on the tapes. And so I want to try and encourage us tonight, brothers and sisters. Let's try and put ourselves there. How many people are afraid to really speak the commandment of God to understand the covenant of God for fear that maybe someone would hear our words? Maybe somebody would actually think that we're just a little bit fanatical. Maybe we're going to say something that God won't do for us in our life. And the devil will say, "See, I told you. Maybe you've got some secret sin in your life. You're afraid to speak the word. Maybe you're just not sure. So, you're afraid to speak the word." He doesn't say why they're afraid. He just says they're afraid. They're scared. And I can't help but think how many people who live a Pentecostal experience in this message of the hour could be just a little bit afraid of this word. But let's talk about this. This is an unconditional govern covenant that God gave to his people. It's our inalienable right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are already seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus is what the prophet said, the word said. We know the word says that. But he says, "What a promise now in dealing with the Pentecostal people." And if God willing, when I come back, I have found the weak spot of Pentecostal people. I put myself right there by God's help because sometimes I'm scared. Sometimes I have a little bit of fear. It's our human nature. It's this fallible flesh &gt;&gt; by God's help. That's you're scared. That's right. That's true. He says you're just scared to take God at his word. &gt;&gt; And you know, I talked about this a while ago. Many times we can get afraid to take God at his word, to speak the word. But you know, brothers and sisters, it's not up to us to bring it to pass. It's up to God to bring it to pass. It's up to us just to simply believe it and step into it, to speak it, to live it. Don't be scared about it. But he says you're just scared to take God at his word. And you don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; Does everybody here know who we are tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to try and remind us about who we are. &gt;&gt; To recognize our position in Christ and recognize Christ's position in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to try and dupe us out of our position. He wants to make us feel like, well, you said that, you thought that, you went there, you well, you know, on and on and on, stumbling at this flesh, stagger at this flesh, but not at the promise of God through unbelief. &gt;&gt; Because we know that sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Sin is not stumbling and falling in this flesh, brothers and sisters. That's not what it is. If we sin willfully, if we want to go run out to the barroom, if we want to go clubbing, if we want to go and do all of the worldly things, then maybe there's something a little bit wrong with us. But if we believe the word of God and we trip and fall and we land on our face and we get back up and spit the dirt out of our mouths and and wipe it off of our face and we say, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that's within me. Bless his holy name. It doesn't matter whether I fall down and eat the dirt. I get back up again. &gt;&gt; Says you're just scared to take God at his word and you don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; See, if you only realize what position you are in heaven tonight, there'd be something take place here. Uh-huh. See? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; And I just love how he said this if you'd only realize what position you're in heaven tonight. Not this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's take and put ourselves here. &gt;&gt; Maybe the prophet of God is speaking a little bit to us. Maybe God is speaking to us through the prophet &gt;&gt; because that's what the prophet was sent for. &gt;&gt; We we didn't we didn't gather together to to celebrate cunningly devised fables that was put together by a man. We're not just following a man. We're not just getting people to the prophet. If we do that, then we're missing the point. And there's a whole push, I know, to get people to the prophet. And sure enough, we need to witness that God sent a prophet. But let's say what the prophet said. He said, "Get people to Christ." &gt;&gt; We're here to get people to Jesus Christ. He's the one who died. When we read this scripture here, who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification. It was not William, Mary, and Brandham. That was Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can very easily take and make this prophet an idol. &gt;&gt; We can turn this this message that we talk about into idolatry if we're not very careful. &gt;&gt; But we know, brother Adam said it, God said it through the prophet that this message will never be denominated. Never. There's no way that it will ever happen because it's literal life of Jesus Christ living out in his bride. He goes on to say, "The thing of it is many of the people are trying to put these blessings off in the millennium somewhere. Why would we need healing for our bodies in the millennium? Why would we need healing for our minds in the millennium? Why would we need healing for our marriage in the millennium? Why would we need deliverance for our children in the millennium? Why would we need preaching of the word off in the millennium?" We don't need it in the millennium. We need it right now. &gt;&gt; But brother Bradom says it many times. That's what people do in this age. They they put it off into the future and they look back into the past and ignore what he's doing right now, what he's trying to do right now. They might say, "Oh, he's just not preaching deep enough. He could just preach so much deeper. He could preach the seals. He could preach revelation. He could talk about the open book that was in his hand when that mighty angel descended." And the prophet said, "There won't be two of us standing here at the same time." We know that he's already here. Brothers and sisters, let's talk about Jesus in our lives. Let's talk about the deepest thing that we could ever talk about getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the literal life of Jesus Christ. The dynamic power of God coming upon the mechanics of the seed gene of God in the life of the believer. &gt;&gt; The thing of it is many of the people are trying to put these blessings off in the millennium somewhere. The Bible said, "Now you are the sons of God. Now you are the sons of God. When are we going to become the sons of God? When are we going to become the daughters of God? You either are or you're not. &gt;&gt; And the word that we're trying to preach is that you are. And those people who are will be able to take that word and see that it's actually them. They're going to look in the mirror one day and they're going to say, "Hey, mama, that's me. I can see my reflection in that. &gt;&gt; I recognize it now. You are the sons of God." Not, "You will be. You are right now." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil's going to say, "Nope. One day you have to get the Holy Ghost. One day you have to actually do something different. You have to maybe sing a special. Maybe you have to have gone to church 10,000 hours." They say that in in the world, I think they might have moved the goalpost now, but I remember reading a book a while ago and and the guy said in there that you have to do 10,000 hours of whatever it is you want to master. Whatever it is you want to master, you do 10,000 hours, you're a master of it. Maybe you need to have 10,000 hours of coming to church and grinding it out, of worshiping at the beginning and then listening as long as you possibly can without nodding off and then actually a couple songs while you wake up at the end and then you just go home. And I'm saying that because I've done it, brothers and sisters. I'm not saying because anybody is I don't think anybody's sleeping tonight. Praise the Lord. I I love what brother Toby said. Hey, you know what? It looks like people are are falling asleep here. How about we stand up and say shout praise the Lord. I I thought that was so good, Brother Toby. I'm going to use that sometime, but nobody's sleeping. Everyone's in tune tonight. God bless you. I know what it's like to come to church on a Wednesday night where you've got to fight your way across the city, where you've got to load the kids in the car, where everyone has to come home from school and work, and it's not easy to do. So, I'm not throwing off on people who do fall asleep because I know what it's like to come to church on a Wednesday night. And you know, one of the worst things that we have in our climate, the people from Arizona probably don't encounter this, is when you have to come to church on a Wednesday night and it's really cold out. And uh sometimes we have church when it's very cold outside and and maybe even like I I don't even know what the degrees would be in in uh Fahrenheit, but very cold. Very very cold. And and so you come out of the cold and you come into a building where it's warm and because we're cold, we don't want to take our jackets off. I'm just trying to be real and explain that this is a very real thing. And we come in and sit down in church and we start to engage in the service, but we're warm because we're in a warm building. We have our our warm jackets on and we're still trying to warm up and get that chill off. What happens is we start to get really warm and sleepy. It's a human trait. It's a human thing. But praise be the the the Lord God for giving us air conditioning here. &gt;&gt; We have AC to keep the the heat down a little bit. But you know, Brother Bam, he says, "People are trying to put these blessings off in the millennium somewhere." The Bible said, "Now you are the sons of God." Not you will be, you are. Right now, and I just highlighted this part. Right now, we are the sons of God. Right now, we are seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Not tomorrow. This night, tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, if I could encourage us, we are already seated in heavenly places &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Right now, if we have a need for anything, we are already seated in heavenly places. And this is really where I think the rubber meets the road. As Barry likes to say, I just love this part. He says, "When you can think now that you are sitting by a son of God or a daughter of God, I want to just pause there for a second. Take a look at your neighbor. Take a look at the person across from you. Brothers and sisters, you're looking at a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You're not looking at your brother. If you see your brother, then I want to just encourage you, maybe go pray a little bit &gt;&gt; because we don't want to see each other after the flesh. We're not supposed to know any man after the flesh because this flesh will stagger. &gt;&gt; And to think about how we can be misleading if we're just busy looking at the flesh. That's why, brothers and sisters, legalism failed. &gt;&gt; Legalism is the path to hell. Legalism will take our children and push them right out the doors of the church. &gt;&gt; But if we can show them grace, grace, &gt;&gt; it's grace. That's the reason why we're here. Because as parents, we rely on the same grace that we bestow upon our children. &gt;&gt; Because our heavenly father is so kind and loving. &gt;&gt; How could we be brutal dictator of legalism to our children? My but when you can think now that you are sitting by a son of God &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; or a daughter of God. Think about it. If you were sitting beside President Trump &gt;&gt; if you were sitting beside the the the president of France maybe the chancellor of Germany it would be like wow that's that person. &gt;&gt; Oh can I shake their hand? &gt;&gt; Maybe even Carney. Maybe not so much with Trudeau but You know what I'm saying? A very important person. Even if it was Trudeau, it'd be like, man, that's the guy. &gt;&gt; Wow. I'm sitting beside him. But tonight, we're seated in heavenly places beside sons and daughters of the most high God. And I think it's even further than that, brothers and sisters. We're sitting beside the queen of heaven. &gt;&gt; If we call ourselves the bride of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; think about those back in the day of Esther. Woo we &gt;&gt; when all of that unfolded. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; And what happened? &gt;&gt; Hmon he devised he created a device and thought that he was going to forecast it to the Jews. The king said to the queen, "You say the word. &gt;&gt; You have the authority. I'm not going to change my word, but you speak the word &gt;&gt; and I'll back it up. &gt;&gt; Take my signant and you make it happen. And what happened? That enemy was hung by his own gallows. And I just love it because that's exactly what happens to the devil when he comes around and tries to trip us up. He winds up being punished with his own device. If we are willing to just simply take him at his word and stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief, but be strong in faith, knowing that we're Abraham's spiritual seed. &gt;&gt; But when you can think now that you are sitting beside a son or daughter of God, and you are the same as they are, and Christ Jesus is tabernacled in you here on earth, showing his great manifestations of his blessings and power. Now many times people would say well I don't have many manifestations blessings and power. Do you believe this word? &gt;&gt; If you believe this word then you are a living manifestation of his power &gt;&gt; because not everyone can believe this word. You go and talk about this word this word to people in this world and they will scoff at you. they'll start to get all technical and say, "Well, what really happened in the Garden of Eden?" And this guy in his testimony, you know, the first two polls, we heard about it on Sunday, the first and second polls were tremendous, but oh my, start talking about the opening of the word and Malachi 4:5 and 6 and and Revelations 10:7. Oh my, this guy went off on his doctrine. That's what they're going to say. But for some reason, we have the ability to believe this. Why is that? That is alone the greatest manifestation of his power to this age, brothers and sisters, because that shows the definite identification of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has tabernacled you here on earth, showing his great manifestations of his blessings and power, willing that everyone should be saved, everyone should be healed, none should perish. I tell you, if you could really fathom that in your mind, I tell you now, who's speaking here, the Holy Ghost or the prophet? Who's speaking here? Brother Barry, I tell you, if you could really fathom that in your mind, I tell you, you wouldn't have to have any prayer for the sick, it' just be all over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Bradom, he says it I I I just love it. back in the church age book. He said, "You know, if we just caught that revelation, if we really did catch the revelation, we would just take him at his word. We would come to the front. We'd call the elders. We'd be anointed with oil." And what that would be that &gt;&gt; exactly what he's saying here. That would be that. There would be no need for a prayer line or prayer meeting or any of it. He says it'll be all over. But you have to see it first. If you can't see it, you certainly can't understand it. &gt;&gt; And I just want to try and encourage us to see it tonight, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do is try and encourage us to see it. To see these blessings and manifestations of God's power in our life to recognize that this covenant isn't just for Abraham. It's not for Abram. It's not for William, Mary, and Brandham. It's not for the great ministry that might be in the world now, the five-fold ministry. It's for the sons and daughters of God. is for his bride, universal. That's what this unconditional covenant is for. And I just think it's beautiful because when we look at the word covenant, we can see that it is used in the Bible many times. I looked it up and it's 280 times in the Bible, the word covenant. and specifically in the book of Genesis 23 times. I believe it's 23 verses and maybe even a couple more times by multiple uses in different verses. But the word covenant, I looked it up, is H1285 in the uh concordance and it's from 1262 in the sense of cutting like 1254, a compact because made by passing between pieces of flesh, confederacy, confederate, covenant, league, a covenant. I think it's amazing when we look at this because if we turn back over in our Bibles to the book of Genesis, Genesis chapter 15, this chapter in the book of Genesis in my Bible, it says covenant with Abram. Even before he had his name changed, God was dealing with him. But we know uh I'm just going to I'm just going to start with verse 8 of Genesis chapter 15 just for the sake of time. Actually, let's just go back and read from verse one. We still have time. Start with verse one of chapter 15. Sorry. After these things, the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, "Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, to me, thou hast given no seed. And lo, one born in my house is mine heir. And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir, but he that shall come forth out of thine bowels shall be thine heir. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he said unto him, "So shall thy seed be." And he believed in the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he counted it to him for righteousness. And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Chaldas to give thee this land to inherit it. And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? And he said unto him, "Take me a heer of three years old, and a shegoat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon." And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece, one against another. But the birds he divided divided he not. And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and lo, and horror of great darkness fell upon him. And he said unto Abram, "Know of assurityity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years. And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward shall they come out with great substance, and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good old age. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, "Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the Canaanites, the Kennesites, the Komites, and the Hittites, and the Parizzites, and the Refins, sorry, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Gegosites, and the Jebusites. He gave all of that land to them. And we know we've read this so many times. I think it's beautiful, brother Brandham. In this message, if you listen to it, the uh the quote that we just read, the unconditional covenant that God made with the people, Brother Brandham says in here really, really well, just makes it so clear. He talks about that burning furnace and that lamp that passed between the flesh. What that is is a vision of Calvary of the light that passes between the flesh and the animals being torn apart and laid in order in array is actually a type of that flesh being torn apart at Calvary. And we know that covenant was made with Abraham, with Abram. And it had to come to pass exactly according to the word of God. And it's just so beautiful to think that this covenant was given to Abram for his seed to inherit the land. And we know we've talked about this many, many times about the children of Israel coming out of bondage. It talks about it in here how the prophecy they would be in bondage in a strange land 400 years. his seed would be. But we know that they were sent to deliver because they began to cry out. We've talked about all of this, but they were called out to go into a promised land. That promised land is mentioned here. And we know exactly what the dimensions of the land are, the geographical location of it as well, and who the inhabitants of that land really are. And I just think it's amazing when we look at this because we can see this covenant isn't just for Abraham and his natural seed. Tonight, I want to remind us that this covenant is for Abraham's spiritual seed, the royal seed of Abraham. And it's not to go and inhabit a land where there's all kinds of iszites in the land. It's to inhabit the spiritual land that God has given us, his promised land for our age, which is truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That is our promised land for this day. And I can't help but think every time we read in here how many types of enemies there there, there's just as many or more types of enemies in our promised land, the devil trying to keep us from getting through to our rest. We know that there's a rest promise for us. But talking about the covenant in in Genesis, just specifically in Genesis, I believe there's so much that we could talk about with this covenant. I don't know if we'll uh we'll be able to even cover it all tonight. But Noah, we know Noah, he was given a covenant. He was given a token of a covenant in the day in which he lived. And we know that it was first, it was God's word. He told him to build an ark because it's going to rain. And we know that nobody believed because there was no rain in the world at the time. But Noah, he followed the word of the Lord and he actually built the ark. And the ark, I can't help but think, was a manifestation of God's blessing in his day. That was actually man following the word of God in his heart. And what did he do? He created the ark as God instructed him. And that ark is what took him through the destruction. That ark is what took him through the judgment of his day. And after the judgment had passed, God gave him a covenant. He gave him that token. And he said, "I'll put this bow in the sky. You'll see it every time it rains and it will be a reminder to you and to me that I will never again take all the flesh off of the earth by a flood. That will never happen again. And we know today we still see that in the sky when we see a good rain shower and the sun hits it just right. We can all say, "Oh, there's a rainbow." And I think it's beautiful because in the believer's life, there's just something special about it. We recognize that's exactly where it came from. That is a sign from God to his people that he will never again destroy the world with a flood. &gt;&gt; But we know today that token, that covenant was taken and they've tried to pervert it, but we know they're one color off. And they'll never be able to take that token and pervert it because it's in the sky. It's not on a flag or a badge or a pin or a sticker on a a a a store or whatever. they'll never be able to take it and pervert it the way that they would like to. But we know that that was one type of a a token. And you know, the token of the covenant for us in our day, we we know full well, brother Bradom preached, the message, the token. And the token we know is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It is the seal of God in our lives. It's the seal over the womb in our lives, in our souls, where we are sealed until the day of our redemption. And that's where I want to remind us tonight, brothers and sisters, of this unconditional covenant that we have been given, being the heirs of the promise that we have read about in the scripture tonight. Abraham's royal seed, the ones through many, many generations down the road. Remember Abraham, Abram, he was not actually Hebrew. Do we know that? &gt;&gt; He was not Hebrew. &gt;&gt; He was a gentile. And it's interesting because the blessing went from Gentile to Jew, now back to Gentile. &gt;&gt; And we know that it's on its way back to the Jew again. Any moment now, it's going to head right back there. But the token of the covenant in our day is truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And when we get that in our lives, you are sealed until the day of your redemption. It's not when you go to a service and you have a great service and you feel good. You're you're sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It is now and forever. And and I think it's beautiful because even if we wanted to, brothers and sisters, I I could be challenged on this and certainly we could talk about it, but I would believe this with all my heart because the word of God says that you're sealed until the day of your redemption. If we ever get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we can try and get rid of it, but we'll never be able to because we're sealed till the day of our redemption. But I know one thing is full well. I'll back it up with this. If we truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we'll never want to get rid of it. will never want to get rid of it. And I love how Brother Brandham says it in this message here. You know, sometimes people will say, "I've got the liberty of of of God in my life. I'm a believer. I'm a Christian. I can do whatever I want to do. I can maybe have a little drink. I could have maybe a little smoke. I could go to a little rock and roll. I could do all these things and still be a Christian just like you." Brother Bradam says, "Sure enough, you could, but you wouldn't want to." &gt;&gt; If you're truly a Christian, if you're truly baptized with the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't want to do those things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can easily take grace and turn it into a disgrace if we don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that's the differentiating factor. We know uh how important it is, I hope we do, to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's so important. Brother Brandham says you're lost as lost can be without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You will not go in the rapture without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Without the seal of God in your life, you will not make the rapture. &gt;&gt; You're lost as lost can be. And we're here tonight, brothers and sisters, to remind us that is our covenant. That is what we're after. That is the holy grail. That is the pearl of great price is the baptism of the Holy Spirit in our lives. &gt;&gt; You know, talking about this token, brother Brandham preaches the token. And what entitles us to the token, brothers and sisters? Church attendance, the way we cut our hair, our our rims on our car, how shiny they are, the way we dress, our homes, our bank accounts, our portfolios, our churches, our pastors. What is it? &gt;&gt; Obedience. Full obedience, &gt;&gt; full obedience &gt;&gt; to the complete word of God, &gt;&gt; entitles us to the token. &gt;&gt; And the devil can't stop us when we're willing to do that. And you know, brothers and sisters, that doesn't mean that we have to understand the whole word of God. It doesn't mean that we have to understand the whole entire message of the hour. All it means is that we have to be willing to say just like Mary said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." That's all we have to do. And that will entitle us to the token. And I can't I just think it's so beautiful because of the way he does it. When we do that, if we're willing to be genuine and sincere that way, maybe as a young person, maybe as an old person who has never experienced it, however it is, when we're willing to be that sincere, God is willing to come into our lives and begin to reveal these things to us. He will take this book and make it a new book, the Bible I'm talking about. He will take the message and make it understandable to us. We'll listen to a message and think, "I've listened to that message four or five times before, but I never really ever understood it the way I do now. That's the way it is. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve." &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Brandham brings the message uh uh in the message, he he brings the note. He says, "You know, back in the day, the Chinese laundry, they had tokens or or pages, right? They they couldn't speak English, so they could write down maybe two shirts and one pants." And and what they would do when you drop your stuff off, they would take it and they would tear it and they would keep one half with the clothes and they would give the other half to the customer. And the only way you would get your laundry back is if you had the other half of the piece of paper. Because sometimes people would come in, charlatans maybe, and say, "Oh, those are my clothes up there. I forgot my ticket." And and you know how do I know this, brothers and sisters? I used to work at a shoe repair. People did it all the time. Nobody cared about their ticket. So they would come back and say, "Those are my shoes up there." And so you'd be forced with a dilemma. You know what? Those are $400 pair of Allen Edund shoes that had a complete rebuild underneath. Brand new souls and heels. That's $75 worth of work. And I don't think you look like the guy that brought those shoes in. So now if I give you those shoes, I could have the guy that brought those shoes in come back and actually say, "Where's my shoes? Here's my ticket." So, we started to say it. I understand this means a lot to me. Where's your ticket? If you don't have your ticket, you're not going to get your shoes back. So, make sure you don't lose that ticket. Understand? And and sometimes it upset people, but it saved us from a whole lot of hot water, a whole bunch of trouble. And I just can't help but think it's exactly the way Brother Brandham brings it in the message. He talks about it, how it has to be an exact match. And it's just exactly out of Genesis chapter 15. God who himself came down and was torn. He will only match up with himself. That's all. If we don't have the other half of the ticket that Brother Brandham was talking about, which is the spirit of Christ inside of us, we're not going to be a match. Brother Brandham says, "I believe there could be a spirit there." And you know, brothers and sisters, we're going to have a spirit. Whether we want to admit it or not, whether we understand it or not, it doesn't matter. It's just like the literal law of gravity. Take a ball and drop it and say to me that there's no gravity. Why does it fall? It's going to fall. Right? Just like that, there is a spirit realm. And we're either going to have the Holy Spirit in our life or we're going to have another spirit in our life. Brother Brandham calls it the unholy spirit in some places. And we can have another spirit influencing our life. And I want to say this, brothers and sisters, loud and clear. I want to be really crisp with it. The worst kind of spirit that we could ever have bothering us in our lives is a religious spirit. One that will come and sit down at the preaching in a message church saying, "I believe that God sent a prophet, but I don't like that guy's preaching. I just don't like the way he harps about the Holy Ghost." When we get into that sort of thing, I'll tell you what, that is not the Holy Spirit because that Holy Spirit is always going to say amen to that word. It's going to be the other half of that ticket. &gt;&gt; We're going to have an influence one way or another. We're going to serve God or we're going to serve Mammon. &gt;&gt; And there's no way around that. That's the way that God set things in order. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is. But you know, there's a natural seed that's spoke about in Genesis and and that's Ishmamail. We can talk about that. But I I want to say it this way. You know, we can look at it and say there is a a natural seed called Ishmamail. And there is we know that it was clearly labeled in the Bible that that that one will go forward and actually be a great nation with many people and he'll be a wild man. &gt;&gt; And you can look around in the world and you can see the seed of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to say that. That's all I'm going to say. &gt;&gt; But you know, he's a product of man's way. The natural seed is man's way. &gt;&gt; The natural seed is going to say, "I can I can just do it this way. I can serve God this way. &gt;&gt; I can just hybridize my traditions with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I can just say, you know, it's worked for me and my family all these years and and everything is good in our lives. We can just do it this way." Even when the word of God says do it that way. Even when the messenger to this age says do it that way. We can say well you know other people are doing it the other way. There is a natural seed and the spiritual royal seed of Abram Abraham will never deviate from the word of God. They will always line up with the word of God. I just can't help but think looking at this natural seed from Abraham, Abram and his wife at the time produced an Ishmamail. We don't want to produce an ishmill in our lives, brothers and sisters. That's man's way. And and it's interesting because when we look at it, there's a scriptural sort of identification to it. And that's, you know, Romans chapter 7. And and you know, we've talked about it in in Romans chapter 7 many times. I think maybe just for the the sake of it, if we don't mind, we could just turn over there to Romans chapter 7. Romans chapter 7. We'll just read verse 22. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. I want to do good, but evil is present. That's earlier in the chapter. I every time I want to do good, evil is present. Oh my, I I delight in the law of God after the inward man, but I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with my mind, with the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin. That is Ishmael's seed. That is the natural seed, brothers and sisters, that I want to get to tonight. That is what we encounter if we are living that way. But we've said it over and over again, and I'll say it again tonight. Just turn the page. Don't stay in Romans chapter 7 because those are not the ones that recognize their position under this covenant of the royal seed. Turn the page the first verse. There is therefore when &gt;&gt; right now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now we're talking about the spiritual seed. In the last five minutes, there is a spiritual seed that is Ephesians chapter 1, predestinated. They're predestined to be sons of God. Ephesians 1, predestined to be adopted sons of God. Not just sons of God, but adopted sons of God. Taken to the full place of maturity, revealed unto men to say, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him. Look at him." He is actually living out the modernday manifestation of my spirit to the world in which he's living in predestined. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the what? &gt;&gt; The flesh. Don't look at the flesh. Love that song. Don't look at me or you. Keep your eyes on things above. &gt;&gt; He's the lovely one. Where is he coming into plain view, brothers and sisters, by the way? Where does he come into plain view? Is it in a church building? Is it through the lattice work according to that psalm? Is it just in a story book somewhere? He comes into plain view in you. &gt;&gt; He comes into plain view in me. &gt;&gt; And how does that show? How does that manifest? Full obedience to the complete word of God. &gt;&gt; Reveals Jesus Christ himself. Christ, the mystery of God revealed in you. &gt;&gt; That spiritual seed is predestined. And you know, brothers and sisters, it's an everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; It's not just a covenant. It's an everlasting covenant. It's a covenant that's from now until &gt;&gt; until. And you know, I just think the beautiful thing is the disciples when Jesus came and saw them again after his resurrection, he told them, "Follow my instructions and go back to Jerusalem and tar there until you receive power on high." Brother Brandham says it so many times in the message of the hour. We need to tar until &gt;&gt; until. &gt;&gt; How long, brothers and sisters? one day, two days, 10 days, a week, a month, a year until until you receive power from on high. And that's not power where we can produce mighty signs and wonders. No, no. It's where we can recognize that that other half of the ticket matches up with my life. My life matches that ticket perfectly and I can say, "Praise the Lord." because I know that he has called me as his royal seed in the day in which we live. That everlasting covenant is not for someone else. That's for me. Remember what we said tonight, brother Brandham, in this quote, he said, "You're just scared to take God at his word." Don't be afraid, brothers and sisters, to take God at his word. &gt;&gt; I I want to challenge us tonight. I want to challenge myself tonight to say, maybe I can just take God a little further at his word than I ever have before. Maybe I can actually stand in the face of Satan and say, "Yeah, I want to actually take a step of boldness and do something maybe just a little bit different than I have done according to the word of God." Never outside of the word of God, but another step towards this covenant for me in my life, for me in my family, for me in my church. I don't want to be afraid. I don't want to be scared to take God at his word. Even if we find ourselves in the midst of a storm, in the midst of a train wreck in our lives, don't be afraid to take him at his word. Brothers and sisters, that is the where he is the master. He's the master of the wind. He can come into the midst of any storm. That's where he wants us to be in the middle of the storm. That's where he wanted his disciples to be was in the middle of the storm. And he walked right out to them. And when he got there, what happened? They were afraid that he was a spirit. Remember? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when they recognized who it was, oh my, everything changed, didn't it? Let's not be scared to take him at his word. Let's recognize who we are. He said, "You don't know who you are. Because you don't know who you are, you become afraid." I just want to encourage us to remember who we are. Sons and daughters of the most high God. Look around at our brothers and sisters. The ones we're sitting next to, remember they're sons and daughters of God. Oh my. And and you know, right now, brothers and sisters, we're seated together in heavenly places. We're not going to be. Let's not put it off into the millennium. That's what we heard tonight. I'll call the musicians. As we close, let's let's realize it's right now that we are the sons of God seated right there in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And you know, I just think that we have the ability to to maybe see some some more of Jesus in our lives. In in this message, Brother Brandham, he talks about this and it's one of the things he just says in passing talking about how people when they believe and when they don't believe. And and he talks about Satan's unbelief. I just it just really struck me when I was studying this Satan's unbelief because isn't that true? Unbelief is Satan's. &gt;&gt; Let's give it the the designation for the ownership of that. If there's any unbelief in this world, it's Satan's. &gt;&gt; It's not any human beings ever. It's only Satan's. Let's put it back on the rightful owner. But you know, if there is belief, it's someone else's. &gt;&gt; To be able to believe &gt;&gt; is of God. &gt;&gt; It is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the theme song for the prophet of this age was only believe. not only understand or only explain or only live or only whatever it was only believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible &gt;&gt; if we can just believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be looking at it and getting scared. Brothers and sisters, you know, I I just can't help but think maybe as we close, if you stand with me, I'll just throw this one thing out there that just was resounding with me. You know, brother Brandham, he he actually saw these deer in the woods the one time and he actually was in a position where he had just come through speaking to the storm and God was real close to him and really really affected him that day and he saw these deer and he had this conversation with them and and he said, "You know, I could take your life. I could lift up my 270 rifle and put a bullet through your heart. Split your heart and you would die. But he didn't. He said, "I give you life. &gt;&gt; I I want you to live. So go." And he said they just didn't want to leave. They wanted to stand and look at him. &gt;&gt; But we know that God came and said something to him. &gt;&gt; I remember my promise. &gt;&gt; Do you remember yours? Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just can't help but think sometimes, brothers and sisters, our our very Christian walk can sometimes just grow a little bit cold. Maybe we get our eagle eyes filmed over. Maybe we find that we've made mistakes in our lives. Let's just pick up the pieces and go forwards. Let's just get up and go forwards and remember that this is an unconditional covenant. And though Satan would try and say to us, "Hey, you know what? You've sent away your day of grace." You can turn around and say, "No, no. I've accepted this unconditional covenant the day that I believed the full word of God. I accepted the complete word of God. I took it into my heart and I accepted it the way that he gave it to me." And that entitled me to the token. So, I know that I've got the token or I've got the earnest of the token in my life. Either way, Satan can't touch us. &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage us, brothers and sisters, remember your covenant with him. And if you haven't got one, if you've never made one, it's not too late. He's still calling. Any one of these days though, we heard about it on Sunday. Any one of these days, someone's going to get sloppy with a button and something's going to happen. We heard about it this week. There was this one of the strongest earthquakes ever to be recorded. Just this week on one side of the ocean. One of these days, it's going to be on this side of the ocean. Remember your covenant &gt;&gt; and he'll remember his. &gt;&gt; It's an unconditional, everlasting covenant. Brothers and sisters, God bless you tonight. Let's pray. Gracious Lord Jesus, thank you for your word. Thank you for your unfailing love to us, Lord. Thank you for your unconditional covenant to us. There's so many covenants in this world that are conditional, Lord. But you gave us one that's absolutely free and clear of every single condition. when you came as a burning lamp yourself Elohim, that pillar of fire and you passed between the literal flesh of your son as as he died on the cross. Father, what a blessing it is for us to be recipients of that covenant, Lord, to recognize that smoking furnace was death. But Lord Jesus, you conquered it for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, tonight I pray that Lord, if there's anybody that doesn't know you in the power of your resurrection, Father, where they could truly look in the mirror of your word and say, "Mama, that's me." Where they could truly look in the mirror in in in their own eyes and say, "I don't understand it, but you called me. You chose me, and I accept it." Father, if there's anybody that doesn't know you in the power of your resurrection, Father, I pray that tonight, this would be the night, Lord Jesus, that they would make a stand for you. And Lord, that they would be able to make a covenant with you, Father, that they would accept the covenant that you've already given us so free, Lord. And if there's anybody here that maybe has just grown a little cold, Father, that maybe has forgotten about the power of that covenant, that it's an everlasting covenant, then nothing can take it away from us, Lord. Father, I pray that you would just remind us, Lord, that you would allow us to be encouraged, Lord Jesus, to recognize that, Father, there's nothing that can change your covenant with us. Father, we love you tonight. We thank you for your word. We just ask, Lord Jesus, that you would be with Brother Peter Bochi Manu in his absence here, Lord. Father, as he mourns the passing of his brother, that you would, Lord, bring him home safely at the appointed time. That you would, Lord Jesus, bind up the brokenhearted, Father. Lord, that you would be with the family as they mourn. Lord Jesus, and all the rest who are traveling, who are away, Father, we love you and we thank you. We just commit their lives into your hands now. Keep your hand upon us as we go our separate ways. Be with our friends from Arizona, Lord, as they travel. Grant them traveling mercies, we ask. And Lord, if it's your will for us to gather again on Sunday, hallelujah, Father, we will truly come recognizing that you have brought us here once again, Father. &gt;&gt; That it is a day that you have created and we will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; Father, we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name &gt;&gt; we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing 12:35? I speak Jesus. I speak Jesus. I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind. &gt;&gt; I know there is peace within your presence. I see Jesus. I just want to speak the name of Jesus. Every dark condition starts to pray. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. There is hope and there is freedom. I see Jesus. Your name is Your name is Your Sh. I just want to see the name of Jesus. I see.
