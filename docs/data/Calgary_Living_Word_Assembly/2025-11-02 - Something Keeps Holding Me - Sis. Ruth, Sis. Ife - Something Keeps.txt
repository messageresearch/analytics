Description:
The trials of this world
Were getting stronger
The pull I felt
Was more than I could bear
And I was on the verge
Of giving over
The strength within myself
Just wasn't there

Chorus
Something keeps holding me
Every day I see
He's helping me faithfully
To overcome my trials
Guiding me constantly
Giving me victory
He's a reality
Something keeps holding me

Now Satan lays before me 
His temptations
And his desire to steal away my faith
But I have found the source 
Of revelation
The strength I need 
To keep me in this race
