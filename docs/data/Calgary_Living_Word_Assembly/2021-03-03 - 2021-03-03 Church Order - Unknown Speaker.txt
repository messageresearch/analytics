========================================

foreign someone that would just be so encouraging instead of the opposite and that's my heart today brothers and sisters is to encourage let's go further let's try a little harder let's let's see what the Lord has in store for us because I don't think that he wants us to just be the same he wants us to grow not in numbers but in him in our lives he wants us to see the fullness of the Lord manifest in our lives he goes on to say here the church should be open early and the Believers come together on these nights and at least 45 minutes to an hour before the services begin and you know I'm I'm basically just going to cut it off there I'll call the musicians I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up this thought again um just about coming to church early for the purpose of being able to discover these gifts and see these gifts manifest in in our midst an hour before the service begins maybe stand with me if you will tonight he says the church should be open early and the Believers come together on these nights at least 45 minutes to an hour before the services begin we we start service a half hour early for the purpose brothers and sisters of setting that atmosphere cleaning out all the things in our lives putting aside all the cares of this world not having anything hindering his Spirit from moving in our lives and you know I don't know if if what James said in James 2 verse 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yay a man may say thou Hast faith and I have works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works [Music] there comes a point in time brothers and sisters that I'm getting at that that we begin to apply the full word in our lives and you know how it goes I mean you've heard it said before God deals with whoever's speaking it first before they speak it I'm talking about myself I'm just so thankful that he's long-suffering and kind and patient and just knows his children and and doesn't kick them when they're trying to learn how to walk and us as adults grown adults many times we have things in our lives that we just don't seem to be able to get over and seem to overcome and we just seem to continually do the same thing over and over again I'm here to say take courage brothers and sisters don't feel judged and condemned because that's not what this is about this is about exhorting one another even more so as we see that day approaching getting encouraged by the word and believing that one day even though we struggle and struggle and struggle and struggle and seem like we'll never be able to get past ourselves one day we will brothers and sisters one day we will God Will Make A Way for us if we just give him the opportunity don't give up keep pressing on that's that word that brother Bradham heard when he was coming back to his body from Beyond the curtain of time just keep pressing on just keep pressing on that day is so much closer than it ever has been before we're heading that way brothers and sisters don't fall for the scarecrows don't don't get caught up in all the isms in this world don't get caught up at one another and the things let's just put it all aside and just allow Christ to move in our lives allow them to reign in our lives and just see what happens when that Divine love just just goes and and emulates from one another and and you know what brother Branham says when our carnal flesh says to do one thing he says do the opposite and see what happens see what happens if I've stepped on your toes I apologize just do the opposite of what your flesh feels according to what the prophet said and just see what happens and and God will bless you I know he will let's just go to him in prayer gracious Lord Jesus just so thankful tonight Lord for a perfect word Lord that you would send us a prophet that would just reveal these truths to us Lord that we could understand a little bit more about Who We Are a little bit more about our purpose and and why we're here and maybe why we do the things that we do Lord I pray that we could just go forward together as a church and just understand that we are are built on the same Foundation that Paul preached that's the the word that that William Mary and Branham preached and and that's the word that we believe and and we just are so thankful that you've given us years to hear and eyes to see what the spirit said to the church in our day we can look back and see all of the other ages and think about the heroes in those days and and think about all the wondrous Mighty works that you've done the signs and wonders in their lives but father what good is it uh what if it can't be for me what what good is it if we can't see it in our own lives we need to see your life in ours and Lord tonight I believe that you were just speaking to us about just just giving you the channel to move in in our lives giving you the ability to move in our church giving you the ability to just see the Lord Jesus Christ when we look at one another that it just it just pains us to be apart from one another as we go our separate ways but father we know that we're not far away we can pick up a phone we can zoom call we can even go and visit to some extent father we pray that you would just bless your children tonight that you would just strengthen and encourage each one father be with the children as they go to school Lord Jesus be

that Consciousness a god-consciousness that we could go in the spirit that we could live in the spirit that we could pray in the spirit that we could sing in the spirit that we could think in the spirit that that it would just be all about your spirit in our lives Lord Jesus I believe that's the critical key if we could just have such a god Consciousness every moment of every single day that every thought that we have we would take it into captivity and run it through the filter of your word and just ask you what Would You Do Lord father I pray that you would just be with us Lord strengthen us and encourage us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing My Hope Is In The Lord 2802 [Music] I stand In Awe within the presence of the Lord in whom the wisdom of the ages lies

of this life all of the commitments and struggles that we go through we know though they're for a purpose I so appreciated hearing the part that I did of the service on Sunday brother Phil thank you so much that was wonderful look forward to finishing it hopefully this week there's a purpose for everything we know there's a season for everything just wonder if we could sing one more song before we get into the word tonight can we sing the word is working mightily in me I know it's a little bit of a different Tempo and a different speed but I just believe the Lord put this in my heart before we came up and I don't know I just feel I just feel like it I feel like singing it I don't feel like it physically let me tell you amen oh the word is working mightily in me the word is working mightily in me no matter what the circumstance of what I feel or see the word is working mightily in me especially right now the word is working mightily in me the word is working mightily in me no matter what the circumstance of what I feel or see the word is working mightily in me one more time oh the word is working mightily in me the word is working mightily in me foreign no matter what the circumstance of what I feel or see ing mightily Hallelujah let's just go to him in prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that by revelation we can sing these songs that you give us Inspirations Lord Jesus you put a song in our heart today oh Heavenly Father what an honor and a privilege it is to be able to just worship you in spirit and in truth to understand the word for our day Lord Jesus to know that there's no more mystery of god father we just love you and we thank you and we're thankful Lord Jesus that your word is working mightily in us no matter what we feel no matter what we see your purpose is being fulfilled in us even this very moment Lord Jesus what an honor and a privilege it is to be able to sing that song with Revelation to to fly that flag in the face of the devil knowing that no matter what circumstances come our way your word will accomplish its purpose and it will will never return to your Void father we're just so thankful for your word we're thankful for your grace and for your mercy tonight we pray that you would just bless our service in a real special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen hallelujah thank you musicians we'll uh we'll just look at a scripture tonight I like to read Hebrews 10. 23 to 25 and then Malachi over in Malachi chapter 3. verse 16 to 18 and I'll definitely go slow so we can all turn there what a wonderful day today it was right from the beginning watching the sun rise to the ending watching the sunset another day has passed another day full of God's purpose being fulfilled my goodness what an honor and a privilege it is to be here at the End of Time representing the Lord over in Hebrews I guess I should turn there too and stop talking Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23. let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching let's turn over to the Book of Malachi Malachi chapter 3 verse 16. Malachi 3 verse 16. and this year is speaking about you speaking about me speaking about us then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man's Spirit his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word and we thank you for the Revelation that you give us about your word Lord we know that you have a very specific meaning for your word for a very specific people in a very specific age and Lord Jesus we know that all creation is groaning for the manifestations of your children of the sons of God and Father we stand here tonight believing your word believing your message that you sent through your prophet and Lord Jesus we are your representation here today father we pray that you would just bless this word tonight bless the feeble words that come out of my lips Lord let them not be my words but let them be yours father we pray that I could just get out of the way I have nothing to bring on my own but oh Lord when you come when you come by oh Father you make all the difference and we know that you always come where you are invited so tonight we just invite you to take your preeminence because we know you're already here father let me just step down from the pulpit now and just give you my flesh my Badger skin Lord just come and take control now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen God bless you you may have your seats tonight if I had to go by feeling I would have to say that I am I don't know why extremely nervous apprehensive I guess the Lord's doing something here I just want to welcome everyone tonight it's so wonderful to see your faces when we haven't seen one another for so long we have a few announcements I'd like to get into we have a Minister's meeting tomorrow night at 7 30. it's going to be a zoom meeting and we're just going to go over a few things that we're doing in Lethbridge and so on we have the musicians practice on Sunday at 2PM but one thing we would like to do if possible is invited first have the folks who are involved with the sound and the video our our media system if we could actually just press pause with the musicians and maybe not have so much of a musician's practice as a try and streamline everyone on on the new system that we're operating so that we can hopefully make it just a little better for those people who are streaming for the recording for every single aspect of it that way because it's such an important part of our service now I I believe that we really need to try and focus on on that and encouraging everyone to just get on the same page and you know we we talked about it before service brother Phil and I and and his words were basically like this we need to iron out the wrinkles first and then we can actually create a game plan and get everyone reading from the same page and right now we're still trying to iron out the wrinkles and work out the bugs and get the feedback from everyone so our our skin is thick were not insulted by someone saying something isn't working we're actually encouraging it so that we can help help make it better if we don't identify the problems we can't fix them so please don't don't be shy be kind but don't be shy and and just let us know you know it's working well just send a WhatsApp text and uh and we'll work on it we'll try and get it together so all that to say if we could just sort of Step Back From the musician the Musical part of it and just invite everyone who is involved with sound even if it's the peripherals if you're just doing the the loading of the song book or or whatever it is we certainly would like to see all of those folks come and you know there's probably potential for room for a couple other people who maybe want to play or or have another issue that you want to work on if you do in terms of music by all means just sign up but this one is going to be more focused on on the media portion of things Sunday at two o'clock on the 14th brother Mervin is going to be in Lethbridge pray for our brother young peoples we have on the 19th at 7 pm it will be a virtual meeting on the 21st we have a communion service I I only thing I can say is I apologize it's the first communion service in who knows how long a year or so I I don't know maybe I should have thought it out better and I don't know here we are we've got it figured out we're going to have the deacons here we're going to have all the the musicians that we need to have for this the service maybe just a Pianist and and the the sound guy and we're going to have everybody cue in the parking lot in your cars and stream from your mobile device and if you don't want to stream that's fine but if you want to take a part in in that service just come and and park in the parking lot come and queue in the parking lot with you and your family whoever and the deacons will come and get you we're going to be just bringing people through as we can do it to keep the the maximum amount of people of 12 people in the sanctuary it's a terrible thing I I I don't like it not one bit I can't wait for the day where we can just get back to a communion foot Washing Service where at the end of it we can just water all of the praise all of the the blessing with the songs on the hearts of the Believers and just leave here feeling completely washed out like we always used to but we'll trust we'll we'll just take what we can for now and uh so we'll have the people come in with the deacons we'll have them come up on this side the piano side of the sanctuary they will take the bread they'll be handed the bread they'll actually be handed a cup of wine and they can actually walk over and deposit their empty cup in the waste basket and exit through this door here so we'll have them come in from downstairs at the at the front of the church and then come out here and go out it's probably going to be a fairly uh straightforward service I don't know how much we'll have for a service we'll just try it we're just going to try it so I probably won't try and preach a lot but we'll just we'll just try and make it happen that's all I can say the 21st 6 p.m we've got a communion service if you want to partake cue in the parking lot on the 28th brother Toby has graciously accepted taking the service here in Calgary so that I can go down to Lethbridge and take my first service down there I haven't preached in Lethbridge yet we were there for the first service in the hotel and that was a really good time and I believe brother Toby preached there it was a wonderful service and uh anyways I don't know how how many services have we had there there's been quite a few and I haven't been there to preach one all the brothers with the burden on their heart have just put their shoulder to the wheel to make it happen so I'm going to go and put my shoulder to the wheel and see what the Lord will do um certainly thankful for the streaming services we've definitely been working out some stuff here and uh for those people maybe who who aren't aware one of the things that we we were contending with was a fluctuation and Power in the building and it was wreaking havoc I think on our equipment computers were doing strange things they would crash at strange times and I think we found the main source of that problem and it has been fixed so praise the Lord he showed us the problem and gave us a really easy fix for it so Lord willing with the stability of the power things can only get better [Laughter] tonight I want to carry on with uh Church order and just sort of talk about what we've been talking about in terms of church order and I trust that we can get out of here soon but uh you know there's just a few things that I think the Lord wants us to talk about just just make sure that we got in order we've got it nailed down and that's really the direction that's our trajectory you know we've talked about it and uh the profit in our day has given a real clear direction for what the church should be doing to operate and and see the blessing of God to see the apostolic blessing that's really what we want in our lives um I've got a few quotes tonight I'm just gonna read them and preach them and we'll see what happened tonight brother Branham says uh just I just wanted to preface it with this year brother Brad I'm talking about gifts in the church it's it's a quote um out of cod in 1954. closest thing to an Evidence of a Christian and again some people might say well this is pre-seals and uh you know what's the prophet he said now I'm going to I'll give you my estimation of what I think that the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian then anything I know of he says you know what it is it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungering and thirsting for God they just simply day and night they just can't stand it they just got to do something for God have you ever felt a calling in your life this speaks exactly to someone who has that burden to go preach the gospel maybe to sing a special maybe to just go and be in fellowship with other believers they just can't stand being away from our brothers and our sisters there's just something there they just simply day and night they can't stand it they got to do something for God they're full of love and they're just Soul travail they're just travailing all the time the Bible said he that goeth forth sowing in tears will doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him precious sheaves is that right all those things now look if there's if this church if I'd say this morning in this little group of people and I God say now look William Bradham I'm going to make you answer for that group of people what you tell them now do you want them all to shout sure I want them to shout do you want them all to speak with tongues I want every one of them to do you want them all to dance in the spirit I want every one of them to all right well that's very good but what would you rather have them do uh-huh he says this I'd rather have a church that had such a burden on their heart for prayer that they just stayed at this altar and would be here day and night and everything else I love how he says this because it could easily be taken and spun into we need to have all night prayer meetings that's going to do it for us we need to go back to Pentecost and and get Pentecostal and that's going to do it for us we need to have an altar call at the end of every single service and that's going to do it for us no we have to take what the prophet says in context and that's why I went way back now we're getting into what I wanted to say I wanted to make sure we get the context of what he's meaning a church had such a burden in their heart for prayers that they just stayed at this Altar and would be here day and night and everything else and in their house was constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to come to God and making calls at the hospital we can't do that now sadly but making calls at the hospital and visiting the sick and trying to get people to come to church and do right I'd rather have that than all the other put together although the other is right it belongs in the church but if I have to have to have it I'd put that first because if you've got that the other will take place so brothers and sisters I just want to make sure what we preach here in this church is the message of the hour according to what William Branham taught the seventh angel messenger that's what we preach here and and and that's all we're not preaching another doctor and we're not interested in getting into Pentecost and I think that maybe because some people know that I grew up in Pentecost I don't know maybe I'm just going on a rant here but I just want to make sure that you hear my heart's desire you understand really my perspective here I'm not trying to slant this from a Pentecostal perspective we heard what the prophet said we have to have the right motive and objective to to accomplish God's purpose but when we do have that right motive and objective [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us now in most places we find that when these gifts in the people the people does not understand how and when to use these gifts and in doing so they only bring a reproach this is kind of what I wanted to get to tonight here we are just about quarter two [Music] um hope that we're getting somewhere I know it's important to go back and just refresh and and it's been so long since we've talked about this and I'll try to stop babbling and get into it here and and in doing so they only bring a reproach just because they don't understand how to operate these gifts and brother Branham gives us a very clear operation understanding it he says which we believe would just would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful blessing that God has given to the church in these days and and what he's talking about right there brothers and sisters we could say I'll word it this way I'll just read it again in doing so they only bring a reproach which we believe would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful message that God has given to the church in these last days when people don't understand how it's supposed to be and and don't understand what's supposed to take place and what it's supposed to be like it causes confusion and when that happens people get scared it's a scarecrow and they just don't want to go any further it just becomes I'm only going to stay here remember we talked about Joshua and the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and going into the promised land and there was a time where the people had to say nobody has gone there before but God has called us and he's shown us many signs and wonders and he's told us watch the Levites because when they go across give them the proper space follow them make sure that you understand you know we're coming to that place too brothers and sisters nobody else has gone this far brother Branham I would say this and forgive me for saying it if if maybe it sounds contentious brother Branham isn't gone as far as we are going to go and the reason I say that is because he actually went by the way of the Grave brothers and sisters we're not talking about going greater than the office he had the highest Office of the age period I mean the Holy Ghost above him but right we know that the the prophet for the age a major prophet was the highest office and nobody will will go beyond that and there isn't going to be another one but brothers and sisters we have a higher calling for those people who don't go by the way of the grave don't be afraid of it don't worry remember we read earlier that the word will always straighten it out if we have confusion the word will always straighten it out but what I want to get to tonight is what's the word for our day what's the word for us we have the Bible many ages have many people have the Bible but if they don't have the message of the hour they don't have the whole Bible I would say that now that sounds crazy that's her heretic for many people but it's true they didn't even understand water baptism they don't understand what happened in the Garden of Eden I I mean we could those are only two things how many things are there the mystery of God there's so many things that brother Branham straightened out according to scripture not just his opinion we don't want to get into that tonight we want to make sure that we're seeing that blessing that God has given to the church in these days people they they don't understand that according to the word for our day the message of the hour the importance of it I'm just going to use two examples and I'll try and make it quick here as we wrap up because I don't want to keep everyone late tonight people just don't really understand that the message of the hours according to the word entirely and you know that is the word for our day the message of the hour and we we've talked about it many times I'm just going to do it again Noah just going to say it in a different way though he had a word for his day and and how was it that he had a word for his day many of us all of us would say Amen to that right no one had a word for his day but that word that came to Noah it came to Noah it didn't come to his family he didn't come to his church it didn't come through his denomination and then handed down to Noah it was God speaking specifically to Noah and giving Noah a revelation about what he needed to do and what did Noah do Noah went and preached it Noah gave it out Noah took it in and gave it out and what was that word that he gave to the people it was at the end of All Flesh has come before me it's happening the Earth is filled with violence and I will destroy them all go on Noah build an ark here's the instructions for it and to think that the wrath of God was stayed until Noah had his family inside the boat and once he was in the boat then God shut that door and you know the same thing is happening today brothers and sisters don't look for a physical closing of the door because you're going to miss it if you do if you look for a physical closing of the door like the boat it's going to be too late because that door closed for Noah and he sat there how long was it seven days he sat there and we talked about it there was questions are you sure honey daddy is this right you know all the people outside throwing tomatoes and and whatever else and mocking them hahaha it's gonna rain it's gonna rain same thing with us brothers and sisters Believers coming into the church it's not going to be a literal door closing it's actually a spiritual door closing and choosing not to get all the way into Christ is going to close that door one day on our lives but God gave Noah a message to preach and and the people had the opportunity to accept what that Prophet had to say for that day or reject it and and there was only one way that you could accept it and it's the same thing with the message today is to accept it all or to not accept it you can't just accept part of it and think that you're actually getting in the boat right you had to get in the boat if you just tried to hang on to the outside of the boat you perished you had to get in the boat he told told Noah make thee an ark Adam just going back to the beginning just the simple simple stuff here tonight as we close Adam he had a word for his day what was that word God gave it to Adam he gave it directly to Adam and it was of every tree in the garden thou may eat freely but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat thereof Thou shalt surely die God didn't come down and tell everyone in the garden he didn't come down until Eve because it was the very next scripture in in Genesis chapter 2 that he actually split Adam and Eve that he formed the woman it was the very next scripture and Eve once Adam preached that gospel to her she had a choice she could either accept what was preached or decline what was preached and us today brothers and sisters with the message of the hour we have the opportunity to accept all of it in its entirety and to leave one part of it out brothers and sisters it means death it's not going to be well I I don't know I I'll still be fine I'll still be able to make it I'll still be able to find a way to get there maybe but I know I remember hearing brother Ken say this and it's just becoming so real to me uh this last while how if we do go and stand before that white Throne we've talked about it many times I've pondered this for hours if we do make it to that white Throne that's going to be a horrifically frightening place to be no way man we don't want to be there we've been given the ability to have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church why would we want to try and interpret it and make it something other than what the prophet said it was my goodness you've had a choice we have the same thing today God sent a prophet to set things in order in the church in the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the of the fathers back to the children and the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers if we don't actually go all the way into that brothers and sisters we're missing the point we're we're not actually going to be that bride of his own choosing remember there's five wise and five foolish which one are we but the Branham says a few things I think the first thing and I believe these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the Branham Tabernacle for it to prosper in the Lord remember how Moses he said to the children of Israel on the last plague we've got to follow the lord very carefully for this last one here we've got to apply the token to our homes exactly follow my instructions exactly the way God has told me or we're going to see death brother Branham says it here just brings that to mind I think the first thing and and believe that these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the Branham Tabernacle for it to prosper in the Lord I think first that every member or worshiper of the Branham Tabernacle should be in so much in Divine love with each other until their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away do our hearts long for each other when we have to go away to leave each other at the service at night he says I'm a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that was the evidence of the Holy Spirit by this manner will all man know that you are my disciples and what manner that you have love one for the other and that doesn't mean love I have to correct you I've got to spank you you need a gospel spanking no no no no no no exhorting one another even more so as we see the day approaching many times it's taken as oh we need to assemble ourselves even more so as we see the day approaching brothers and sisters that's only the first part of a three-part verse the middle part is exhorting one another even more so as we see the day approaching encouraging one another calling one another talking to one another just encouraging one another exhorting one another he says now the next thing we believe that these worshipers should meet together these gifted people such as tongues and people who gets Revelations and interpretations and so forth these members or these Believers rather should come together at least 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever begun oh my putting this together I'm thinking goodness we have trouble getting here half an hour before 45 minutes to an hour you know one thing I'm learning about is uh just in terms of tithing if we don't give back when we have a gift that gift is going to dry up brothers and sisters in our lives God gives us a gift if we don't use it if we don't actually try and give out from that gift it might be scary it might be tough it might it might cost us financially it might cost us sleep it might cost us friends if we don't give out of that gift it's going to dry out we're gonna maybe not hit the purpose that we're here for but the Branham says 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever begin just for the record I am usually always here at least an hour before service there's the odd time where I'm not but it's very very rare these days and you know as I go into this and talk about it I don't want to talk in a way that sounds like I'm Pious and I'm here early and I don't know where everyone else is let me tell you I'll tell you straight out I I used to be a deacon in this church and uh as a deacon I should be setting the example yeah I'm not saying anything about the new deacons just for the record I'm just talking about me and uh we had a young family we had a business we're busy busy busy busy busy busy nobody as busy as us and you know what happened many times I was late to service just about every time make the service late to service late to service late to service late to service and thanks be to God for a pastor that never ever destroyed me for it he could have he could have crushed me with it with the message of the hour he could have picked it up and used it as a three-sided club and hammered me and Ben Wright but you know I never did never not once many times there would be a suggestion it would be a loving comment it would be encouragement but he never once destroyed me and told me that I was wrong he never did and what happened because of that he encouraged me and you know when I started to look at myself and and step into this role I started to look back on my life and think man man thank you Lord for a pastor that would so be so encouraging in love that would never destroy me even though he could have we come together half an hour early brothers and sisters for a purpose and we can look it up in the message further than this we're talking about gifts and and callings and if people feel like they get Revelations and different things and and they want to see this stuff operate there's a very specific formula for it and I'm all for it I'm very interested in seeing people maybe that feel led to do that if you have that caller desire whatever let's let's do it let's see what can happen but we got to come to church early we need to set that atmosphere if we're going to set an atmosphere correctly then we need to come according to the word for our day if we don't come according to the word for our day are we going to get the true Apostolic blessing that we're looking for and if we're not if we're not going to get the apostolic blessing that we're looking for because we're not taking the entirety of the word and applying it in our lives then what on Earth are we doing brothers and sisters I'm looking back on my life thinking what was I doing but you know what it was it was growing and learning and having the place to get Washed by the Water of the word and not get destroyed but encouraged exhorted even more so as we see the day approaching I can look back now and I just I'm so incredibly thankful for a loving Pastor all this other stuff will follow not lead so when I talk about church order and and and the gifts in the church and all this stuff just be clear we're not looking for that to happen to have a Vindication because we've already got the Vindication we've got the mystery of God revealed to us already through the prophet we have the open Word that's what we're after but just to look at it as we go forward as a church we've had such a crazy time to go through all of this upheaval and and covid and and and stuff as we go forward we want to make sure I don't know maybe it's just me I want to make sure that I have the right direction I have the right motive and and I'm looking for the right purpose for what we're doing here brother Branham says but if I had to have it I'd put that first because if you've got that the other will take place aha see if you've got that if you if you'll just get so hungry for God shouting will take place if you got so hungry for God speaking in tongues will take place if you got so hungry for God you'll just keep on hungering keep yourself now you go to seeing yourself getting indifferent just remember look out there's another Spirit trying to work itself in there we need to make sure that we don't have another Spirit trying to work itself in there if we're getting indifferent or we have an issue or there's a problem or there's something that hasn't been dealt with got to make sure that we don't let that happen because brother Bradham says it right here that's the indifference when that sets in that's another Spirit moving in our lives we have to be able to discern the spirits is what the word says we were talking about a little bit on a chat today you know about fear and and fear it just hit me so hard fear is is like one of the emotions that comes across people and it's a normal human condition to have fear carnally speaking but according to the word it's incorrect because it's a spirit and I quoted a scripture that God hath not given us the spirit of fear out of Timothy he's given us his spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind it just really struck me this morning I I dealt with a major major fear Spirit a couple years ago and I alluded to that a little while ago so much fear that I started to hear that voice saying that you're you're probably better off dead brothers and sisters don't listen to fear fear is an evil spirit so is indifference indifference is an evil spirit but the brown talks about the church age book he says why do people stay sick and and you know why it's because of indifference people get get ill and and they get indifferent we don't want indifference in our lives if we have indifference we need to maybe take a little closer examination maybe we need to talk to someone who is a mentor in our life maybe someone who we trust and try and find out what's going on because indifference is an evil spirit it wants to cause division I don't even know why I'm talking about that just remember he says look out there's another Spirit trying to work itself in there stay right before God humble with travail of Soul just be all that good old-fashioned you know one thing I would say it's interesting we'll probably get into it later on did anybody ever look up stuff shirt in the message stuffed shirt I'll just throw that out there stuffed shirt it's interesting look that up if you have the time or you feel inclined we need to stay humble and and that's really the contrast to it brother Branham talks about it if we're not humble then we become a stuffed shirt and really what it is is is is is the Badger skin this flesh this Tabernacle it just gets another spirit inside it that Puffs it up and it becomes something that's different than the spirit of God tonight we're talking about church order though I want I want to go back to that and and and just kind of remain there for a little while just so we know that uh we know that we're on the right trajectory with what we're doing in the church we need to receive the person of Jesus Christ and that's really the key if we can actually receive the person of Jesus Christ then we'll see success in the word we'll see the word have success in us we'll be able to sing that word song that the word is working mightily I mean it doesn't matter what circumstance is it doesn't matter what I feel or see but we the word is just doing it because I believe I've met the requirements I believe and and that's all it takes gives us the ability to receive the person of Christ out of questions and answers in in 54. he says but it's accepting the person of Jesus Christ and these other things come right on in and they fit together like let every member of this body this morning tonight let this little group of people if we could just pull back the curtains if we could just pull the curtains down along each side and every person in here receive the person of Christ Jesus there wouldn't never be a fuss there would never be an argument there would just be a perfect love yet you would still believe this and believe that because we're humans we would still have our opinion our opinion but we would have just a love there'd be a perfect love yet you'd still believe this and believe that but it'd just be so full of love that that's it now Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them and by the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness it's Galatians 6 22-23 that was just sort of a kind of a preamble into this church order just to to see that really that's the direction we're going brothers and sisters I I feel checked so many times when I get into this stuff I yeah I just have to say this that I feel like a kid and and and there's a bunch of adults that I'm talking to in terms of the message there's so many people that know the message better than me that have been around the message for longer than me etc etc etc and and and and mistakes I'll make mistakes I have made and and so many times I feel really insignificant and that's why I I say tonight I just felt like singing that word and I really do sing that word myself when I start to get down because it doesn't matter what I feel like if God's called me then then he'll look after me he'll make a way for me and somehow someway his children will be blessed I trust it but we just want to make sure that I I guess my heart's desire is if I could ever come across as as maybe Gruff sometimes I can say things that maybe maybe they just rub people the wrong way that's I'm sorry for that I apologize maybe that's my human nature I don't want to do that to people I want to encourage people into the word I want to encourage us to come together if if if I have said anything in a way that maybe is abrasive to people that certainly is not my intent or desire sometimes and I'll I'll probably hear about it after sometimes my wife she just says to me like we say to the children just quiet you know maybe just a little bit less Gruff a little bit softer a little bit Kinder just a little bit tempered and I guess it's my my nature but anyways I I just want to know want to try and say that my heart's desire is for us to grow together in and in the Lord and the Lord in us together it's not to make anybody feel bad or or put anybody out just if you can bear with me and I don't really have I'm not trying to feed us a sandwich tonight and start out with really good happy and then the really sticker and then end with good happy that's not it I'm just being me I'm just trying to talk that's all going into this church order though I just want to try and sort of I'd like to try and wrap it up but I see time always flies and uh you know maybe we'll try and wrap it up tonight we might have another service with it Lord willing we'll see what he wants to do and just go with it just sort of as an introduction tonight uh with this we'll try and catch up to where we left off you know brother Branham says we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessing for the people of this day that's that's what we believe and I truly believe that we all believe everything that we say in here and if there's anything that I do say and and maybe there is a disagreement I certainly would like to talk about it because I don't want to represent anything incorrect according to the message of the hour and I don't want to interject my opinion because my opinion really isn't worth anything the only thing that I want to do is try and uphold the message of the hour before the people that's the only thing that's going to bring the change of our bodies that's it we believe in the Full Gospel and believe that all the signs and wonders that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returned we have seen so many miracles in our midst I know it we've had many many testimony services and they're very powerful they're very important and we'll continue holding them we're not going to stop doing testimony services we believe in those things and we believe that they are to be set in order that the church has its order and each church has its Doctrine and Order and discipline there's a reason why we do things the way we do it's not because we we have an association and we want to try and and and just carry on according to what William Branham did at eighth and Penn in in Jeffersonville Indiana because we we follow the man what what he did was he set a pattern in order for the Church of its day just like Paul said in order a pattern for the Church of its day and and and we want to make sure that we just follow it so that what we can see is that Apostolic blessing in our lives if we take and interpret this word and try and apply it in a different way maybe get a little bit more contemporary in in our services with our music maybe we get a little more contemporary with with the things that we do bring in a coffee bar in the back to try and accommodate people and encourage people and have you know maybe fresh hot baked danishes in the morning on Sundays to attract people that's not what the prophet taught that's not going to bring us an Apostolic blessing it will bring more people it might bring more tithes it might bring a greater attraction here but what are we attracting people to the attraction or are we attracting people to the word we want to make sure that we're attracting people to the word of God because we're going to need the word of God in our lives as we go we need that Apostolic blessing in our lives when we pray for our children to go to school when we pray for our children when they come home when we pray that he will give us traveling mercies to go to Lethbridge or wherever it is we go or whatever it is we do he cares about all of it and we need to make sure that we're setting the right pattern in order when we come to church we're not coming to play Church we're coming to see that Apostolic blessing we're coming to meet with the Lord God Almighty we've said it before just like the the Old Testament priests when they would go into the holiest of holies one time a year if they didn't have it all right in their life they would die and they would have to be hauled out by that rope tied to their ankles do we take it serious when we come to church when we fellowship at church when we come to play music when we come to minister when we come to just partake of the service and pull on the gift are we taking it that serious brothers and sisters I'm not trying to say that we're not but I just want to make sure that we are because it is the same Jesus Christ that was in the holiest of holies that's here tonight and and if we can just understand that if we can have that God Consciousness that it's not even just right here wherever we go in our lives if we have everything in order in our lives wherever we go we're bringing him with us that atmosphere where people will just apologize for swearing around you because they there's just they don't even know why that why did I just apologize why did I apologize for a swear they don't even know that there's an atmosphere around us brother Branham goes on to say that there's no members as joiners our church has no members as joiners we believe that the whole Universal Church of the Living God is our brothers and our sisters and it's a many membered body these are my words now it's a many-membered body the mystical body of Jesus Christ the same people that are here have the same spirit that we would see over there if we would go to another continent we would see The Same Spirit in people over there it's the same spirit all over the place God doesn't have culture it doesn't work to say that I've got a cultural difference from where I was raised and that makes the message any different no no no no no that's not going to work that doesn't fly not in God's economy nope the Holy Spirit has one spirit it's one Spirit we are baptized into his body but it's a many-membered body the mystical body of Jesus Christ and and all people are welcome Branham said that in his church and we say that here all people are welcome all people are always welcome regardless of what denomination they belong to imagine that there's some some people in in the message of the hour that would come in they would probably have different Slants to what we believe and it might make us feel really uncomfortable to see them come through the doors but as brothers and sisters we'll welcome them bring them in they might have an opportunity to hear the word preached in a way that maybe they never have before it might bring them back in off of that limb that they've been taught to go and stand out on we've talked quite thoroughly about justification sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Holy Spirit brother Bradham says we believe that the holy spirit is putting that same vessel into service we know the the story of the cup the analogy of it being picked up cleaned out and then set aside for service I just want to pick up from justification and sanctification and and go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost part of it here we believe that the holy spirit is putting that same vessel into service and that Holy Spirit is not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken in First Corinthians 12 manifest himself through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gifts brothers and sisters every single one of us were born with gifts every single one of us have gifts that God has placed in US purposefully from before the foundation of the world and you know when we go forwards and and we get that that word starts to pour on us like Moses turning to look at that that burning bush that light that Supernatural light flashed upon that seed in his heart in his soul that happens to us when we hear the word being preached when we press play when we come to church when we stream whatever it is we do now when we hear the true word being preached to us it does something to us what it does is it triggers that gift that life that's in us from before the foundation of the world that seed Gene of God cracks open and starts to come to life and grow and the more we listen Faith cometh by hearing by hearing what by hearing the word of God and the more that we feed the more that we learn the more that we hear the greater we grow and and that gift within us actually grows and you know my heart's desire I'm learning brothers and sisters I am learning and I trust that you'll just bear with me I understand it now a little better and that is that when there is a gift in somebody if we don't actually use that gift if that gift doesn't have a way to express itself then that gift will either die or it will go away we have to encourage the gifts there's young people that potentially have gifts of Music we need to encourage those gifts in the assembly and and that's our our hearts desire is to do that there could be gifts and adults to sing there could be gifts in adults to play there could be gifts in adults to build to do things we want to make sure that everybody has the ability to express their gift if there's Gifts of specials whatever it is everyone has a gift that God has placed in them from before the foundation of the world and we want to encourage that we're not looking to see remember we're not looking to see the signs and wonders but there are gifts there's Gifts of tongues there's Gifts of discernment there's Gifts of wisdom there's Gifts of healing there's many different gifts and they're all alive and well in the body brother Bradham says I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance and and that when we are born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that before we are even become adults while we are yet children the gifts that we have of God is in us then and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation brothers and sisters if you could just pause with me there and think about how many times since I've ministered behind this Pulpit that I've said holy spirit I think that sums it up right there there's an importance of having the Holy Spirit not just to be saved but to actually operate the gift there's a purpose for us to be here it's not just to be saved even though it is for God to express his purpose through our lives but it's a many-membered body and and and we tend to one another we help one another through the gifts that God has given us brother Branham says the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to First Corinthians 12. now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and that they should be in every local church and there's some people that would probably say today while that was back in brother branham's era you know back in in the day in the 60s when he was on Earth in his church only and and not today but you know that's that's a lie of the devil that is a lie of the devil the word doesn't change I was having a conversation with someone this week as well talking about the Pentecostal life and how the Pentecostals live and it's just astounding it was astounding for me coming from the Pentecostal Faith to believe to understand the teaching rather that you know once you receive the the ability to speak in tongues then you know you've received the gift of the Holy Ghost and and that the the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to speak in tongues but once I actually came and started to hear the word the open word the revealed word of our day and saw wait a second the word nobody told me brother Branham didn't say it I don't think brother Ken preached it but as I began to feed on the word I saw there was nine spiritual gifts in the Bible and maybe brother Ken preached it he probably did he probably preached it but it caused me to go and read it for myself in the Bible and say I can see in the Bible forget about what brother Branham says forget about what anybody else says the Bible says nine spiritual gifts why are they saying one what is wrong with that that's crazy going on in in this message brother Branham says fanaticism fanaticism although in such we have found throughout the world that there is much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be Apostolic believers and right away as I was going through this it just made me think scarecrows and and anybody who feels inclined look it up in the message I'll just read a couple of quotes about scarecrows what brother Branham says I've I've read them before but I'll just do it again you know 1963 standing in the gap that's how you know a Christian by how he lives so never jump any higher than you live so then just put in there but it's a devil making a scarecrow to keep the real genuine Believers away from the true thing of it but God help us to separate and be able to discern between right and wrong how would we ever do it if it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it would be possible without the Holy Spirit and our lives brothers and sisters without having the person of Jesus Christ come into our lives come into our hearts come into our souls it's got to be all the way in our souls if it's just on our flesh level it ain't gonna work if it's just in our spirit it ain't gonna work it's got to go all the way down right down into that throne room of our hearts but God help us to separate and be able to discern between right and wrong and the word will always straighten that out isn't that wonderful he tells us that it will be potentially a problem if we're not careful the devil is going to set that trap he's going to distract us and get us confused but the word will always straighten it out perseverance in 62 but my sons don't be disturbed now just before his appearing there's going to be all kinds of fanaticism raise up around it always is it's the devil trying to put a scarecrow out see scare you away but remember the Scarecrow is always at the good tree you know I just want to throw this out there I know there's a history to the message of the hour and uh I know there's a lot of people that have seen this history actually forming over the decades from when brother Branham was actually on the scene and sorry in the 60s and the 70s and 80s and 90s all kinds of Faith healing Ministries impersonators exactly like brother Bradham talked about in uh in sirs is this the time of the end but fanaticism and you know I could be wrong about it but I think that I perceive I just perceive that there is a real fear about the operation of gifts around the message of the hour and and maybe I'm wrong 100 wrong whether I am or whether I'm not it's just my perception and and it just is brothers and sisters we don't have to be afraid the spirit of God will always lead us into truth if somebody speaks in tongues it's not going to be the wrong thing because here here's the key to it brother Branham in this message and and another one in other places in in the message if we research it he tells how things are supposed to happen and that's really what I want to get to tonight there's a very specific order for how this stuff is supposed to work and if we don't see it happen to the way it's supposed to work brother Bradham he's got a very clear answer for it then we're supposed to say hey those people who got up and prophesied in front of the whole church and said such and such and so and so and and whatever they need to come and confess before the church and say pray this lying Spirit off of me if it doesn't come to pass it's real simple but what happens is it becomes a big huge scarecrow on one hand people are afraid to operate the gifts to see the gifts because of all of the fanaticism that potentially they've seen and experienced and heard about and on the other hand there's people that have never experienced it or seen it and I can say this myself just speaking about speaking in tongues and interpreting I've seen it as a kid growing up in the church speaking in tongues and interpreting but you know what's amazing is I would see someone speak in tongues and then I would see a woman who is wearing a mini skirt high heels painted face cut hair interpret and for me as a kid it was just like you know whatever it's just church we just go in a church and it's the way they do it I I don't know I'd rather be sleeping that's how I felt but I remember looking around in wanderment seeing this happen and thinking it's all false and and knowing that it was incorrect false vessels brother Branham says that very clearly I'm not trying to talk about that tonight but what I'm saying is that it's scarecrows those things happen the wrong way but the only way that we can say they're happening wrong is because there is a right it's just like having the understanding of the message of the hour many people will say nobody's got it right nobody's got it right what what God's done in this age and doing in this day every single religion out there is wrong but the only way that can be is because there has to be a right it's the law of the contrast there has to be a correct brother Bradham says just remember not out on the old Sour Apples no it's always where the good eating's at so he said Just remember now there will be some raise up saying they're this and some saying they're that and some saying they're so forth and claiming Messiahs and everything else but don't you believe it now the only way to be sure is take what the word says and so I just want to talk about what does the word say for a little bit we know what the Bible says and the scriptures never contradict one another but there's a specific word for our day that God sent to us and how did we get that word we got it through a prophet and many people who who could be streaming in maybe new people might not understand this we understand it it's Elementary to the believer to the message believer the people who have been baptized by the Holy Spirit we get we get it we understand it but there might be people that don't quite understand this we follow the teachings of the New Testament for we believe that Jesus Christ being the Son of God and Paul the Apostle was called and the chosen vessel by election of God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order brother Branham was sent to the Gentile Church in this age to shine a light on what this is my words now I'm not talking about I'm not reading a quote here he was sent to shine a light on what he was sent to shine a light on what Paul preached the word and and only the word you know maybe he had opinions and he would say it I I have this opinion and and and I I I estimate or or anticipate but whenever he said thus saith the Lord look out that's different but he was sent to actually shine a light on what Paul preached for a purpose just just going back to that word he did he had a purpose and that was to call out a bride of his own choosing through his chosen vessel of the day to go beyond the curtain of time and and see those millions of people saying that you know he preached what Paul preached if I have to be judged that I preach what Paul preached and all those people over there you and I brothers and sisters beyond the curtain of time we said we're resting on that we're resting on that that's us brother Brown talks about water baptism we believe in water baptism in the Branham Tabernacle by immersing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic teaching of the Bible we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world the many membered body of Christ the mystical body of Jesus Christ on Earth again the outward expression of that inward work of that that spirit of God coming down into the soul actually going beyond the the flesh level and saying that I just live my life as a good person and going beyond the spirit realm and changing the way that we act and and think and and behave going Way Beyond that we know that brother Branham says somewhere in the message that the the baptism of the holy spirit is without sensation and and the kingdom of God and the word says that it comes without observation I look at brother Logan and say hey he's the same look he's a little older now but he's the same looking guy that was there on the ball river that day when we got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I probably look like the same guy maybe a little fatter a little heavier maybe a little more gray right here but we look like the same people right we don't change the kingdom of God comes without observation we look like the same people we see our family and they say you're the same guy what are you talking about you believe some message you've got a prophet you're joined a cult well no you haven't you've just been saved truly saved says now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church
