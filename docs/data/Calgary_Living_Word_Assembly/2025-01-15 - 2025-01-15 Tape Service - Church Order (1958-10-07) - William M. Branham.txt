vindication like something simple like this an Amish girl brother brand said that didn't even wasn't even a Pentecostal her little brother what happened to her brother anybody you know that he had a club foot or a twisted foot and on the stage his ankle got got healed just like that she jumped out of the piano stool and starts praising the Lord and speaking in tongues and then piano kept playing

we glorify your name we exalt your name father but even as we come as your children as we gathered before you seeking our spiritual food oh God see seeking nourishment seeking strength of you because Lord you are the only source of our strength you are the only source of Life there is none else beside thee there is nowhere else father and because of that father you've not you've you've opened yourself completely through Us in this age and we understand that when we gather together this way in fulfillment of your word father we know that we are not going to listen to the voice of a man we know we are going to listen to your voice yes you've used his vocal court but we believe with all our heart that this is you speaking to us father help us oh Lord to receive it even as you bring it father the same inspiration with which it was spoken oh Lord may we have and receive that same inspiration oh Lord that this word will be the life of this Church Father we love and appreciate you oh God bless us as we go forward father for the remainder of this service have your way in Jesus Christ's name do we pray amen all right so as um the pastor stated already we're going to listen to a tape it's a very short one um about 34 minutes David Church order uh PR in 1958 in Jeffersonville and um for me I just want to say you may have your seats please I just want to say I'm very very excited because I see this as a pread into um sort of the direction in which we are going and like brother BR the words of brother Braham says it makes a strong church and so much as we're not going to do the question and answers but per se today yet this this short tape it's it's a a very important prel that we have to um sort of embrace accept receive with Open Hearts and pray that every direction every correction anything that comes will be useful to us now if May maybe you're new here or anything like that or you're young just understand this that there are so many things that we do different here that it's not done out there that even if you go to other congregations they don't do it that way now we don't just gather to say let's do things different it's not as if some headquarters dictated that this is how things should go no actually we in a congregation that anybody at all who wants to know why we do what we do it can be known because it's just one source that is the Bible amen and and yes it's true many congregations and many um denominations can also lay hold to the same claim and that's because the Bible is a very unique book the author made sure that the only way you can understand him it's by him revealing it to you and so when we we as humans because we are smart and we can read and we take it we end up in a tangent and then another one takes it and end in a different tangent and on and on and on that's why we have so many denominations but God in his wisdom spoke for every age and when he did he also spoke a people to believe so it works both ways and so we believe that God has spoken again in this end time and we are the people he has spoken to that is why we do things the way we do and so as this tape Goes Forth my prayer is that we understand that this is not just a man speaking and that this is God himself speaking to us like brother Braham he say said he said the way we do this is to comp out the cockle birds and get things out of the way that we might all speak the same thing and so that is the idea praise the name of the Lord now there is something else that he says and I just mentioned it because I thought it was very impactful it says that if you see me do anything wrong you are Duty bound to come to me privately now watch this carefully Duty bound so it's not if we like it's not if we feel late if there's something going on you you think it's not consistent with what we believe because I believe this was not speaking just for baham but for everybody who leads who has a leadership role in this congregation we are Dy so it's a moral obligation you're Duty bound to come to me and so this is the idea what I'm saying is if we don't listen to that tape if we don't read that Bible how do we know what somebody is doing whether it's right or wrong this is something that we have to do I I don't want to be speaking too much I I there is something I I I heard this week it says that uh when you eat when you eat it says if you eat if you if you want potassium you eat banana and I say if you want potasium even plantain is better but if you eat that you don't have to know that plantain contains this or that as long as you have eaten that plantain or banana you are getting some potassium in your body as long as you are eating some citrus fruit you are getting some vitamin C in you and as long as you're reading this Bible with open heart and believing you are receiving life and so that is key and the voice we are going to listen today is how God interprets his word to us so in all humility let's give it all our attention and God will bless us all may the Lord bless you Mee of Five Nights at the Tabernacle where by God's grace and by his help I have tried hard by the scriptures to set in order the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ as we believe at the brandham Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say is that the pastor is always in full charge of the Tabernacle in my absence and I only look to the pastor when I return so he is in full charge to change or to do whatsoever he thinks it's best under the leadership of the Holy Spirit while I am aw we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessings for our peoples of this day we believe in the Full Gospel and believe that all of the signs and the Wonders that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returns we believe in those things and believe that they are to be set an order that the church has its order and each church has its doctrines and Order and discipline our church has no members as joiners we believe that the whole Universal Church of the Living God is our brothers and sisters and all people are always welcome regardless of what denomination they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at e and Penn Street in Jeffersonville Indiana we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 for Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the new Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified the unclean habits is gone from the person he's the believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the holy spirit amen which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer it's just as many times as I have taught it like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard justification is picking it up ready for to use it with a purpose in heart that's what God does to The Sinner he's still filthy then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is uh not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gift I believe at the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we're born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that before we're even become adults while we're yet children that gifts that we have of God is inocent and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and and Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to 1 Corinthians 12 now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in ever local church although in such we have found throughout the world that there's much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be uh Apostolic Believers just as they are and other orders and so forth we have Fanatics that's been all along we've had those Through the Ages they had it in the apostolic day and as Paul said there that how that some had come and persuade them away after other doctrines and so forth but in his own teaching he said if an angel from heaven would teach anything else than what he had taught let him be a curse so we as the brandom Tabernacle at eth and Pinn Street year try to follow the teachings of the New Testament for we believe that Jesus Christ being the Son of God and Paul the Apostle was a called and chosen vessel by election of God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order now we believe in water baptism in the brandham Tabernacle by Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic uh teaching of the Bible and may all members of the or comers to the brand Tabernacle who desire such May at any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus May consult the pastor and the they have repented and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as possible even then if he can baptize them immediately this does bring them into the Fellowship of the Believers we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is giving to every man to profit with all now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us now in most places we find that when these gifts in the people the people does not understand how how and when to use these gifts and in doing so they only bring a reproach which we believe would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful blessing that God has given to the church in these days Paul said when there come a stranger Among Us and we've all speak with tongues won't the man go away and say say we were mad but if one would prophesy and make KN the secret of the heart then they would fall down and say truly God is with you now we believe that the spiritual gifts among the Believers is the order of the day we cannot believe that a man can preach under inspiration and then or be an inspired teacher and then Deni the gift of healing or the gift of Prophecy or speaking with tongues or interpretation of tongues or any of these other gifts so therefore here is my belief in God's word the way the Bram Tabernacle at ath and Penn Street here in Jeffersonville should be operated I think the first thing and believe that these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the brandom Tabernacle for it to prosper in the Lord and if at any time these this would be question the person who is in question about it may consult me if they cannot get to the pastor or they could consult the pastor if I'm home off of some of the trips I'll be glad to to help either the Ley or the pastor at any time and the these things are scripturally and I believe it's the order of the church I think first that every member or every worshipper of the brandom Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other until it would their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night I am a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that was the evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man all man will know your my disciples said Jesus when you have love one for the other and we believe that it's a love of God that sent Jesus Christ to the Earth to die for us all God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have everlasting life and the everlasting life here is God's own life because we become Sons and Daughters of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of Abraham and gives us the faith that Abraham had when he believed God before he was even circumcised now the next thing we believe that these worshippers should meet together these gifted people such as tongues and people who gets Revelations and interpretations and so forth these members or these Believers rather should come together at least 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever began the church should be open early and the Believers come together on these nights and at least 45 minutes to an hour before the services began I believe the brandom Tabernacle at all times should have a spirit filled pianist who would come early filled with the Holy Spirit and would play softly very softly Spiritual music such as down at the cross where the Savior died down there for cleansing from sin died there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name something on that order near my God to thee Rock of Ages cleff for me or near The Cross or something on that order softly slowly as he is meditating constantly on the Holy Spirit he or she whichever it may be then I believe that the worshippers coming in should be met and their hang their coats and hats show to their seats with hospitality that only ushers are deacons filled with the Holy Spirit can do and in love to see the Church of the Living God go on these worshippers should not talk one with another and be talking across and making noise in the church they should come together first slip up and silent prayer perhaps at the altar for a few moments no loud praying you interrupt someone else silent prayer you're in worship let that soak in worshiping in your spirit then return to your seat or you do not have to go to the altar just go in and get your seat sit down listen to to the Music close your eyes bow your head and be in silent worshiping God all along then if the spirit should reveal something to another or or someone be filled with the spirit to a place where they would speak with tongues then this person should rise and give the message and everyone must hold their peace until the interpretation comes when the interpretation comes it must not be just quoting of scripture or something that has no meaning it must be a message directed to the church or we think that it would be in the flesh we see so much of that now I believe the the spirit was to speak only for the edifying of the church and now it would be a message something on this order Perhaps Perhaps the people are gathering by this time some sick people has come in perhaps there's a man laying paralyzed or something you've never seen him before but when the interpretation would come would be something in this order when the interpretation of the one who has just spoke would say uh well thus saith the Lord the man who is in our midst has come from a certain certain place and describe the place and would say that he is paralyzed because three or four years ago or whatever it may the case may be he did something evil like left his wife and children and run off from him and he's fell from a trussle or something like that order and got hurt and paralyzing thus sayith the Lord if he will repent of that and will promise to go to his wife and reconcile himself to her then he shall be healed now and returned to his family and then before anyone says anything there must be at least two or more men are peoples in the building who are spiritually solid in gospel Doctrine who has a good discernment of spirit shall rise up and say that it is of the Lord and if this thing doesn't take place then tongues should not be mentioned in the church if the person speaks with tongues Paul said there be no interpreter and so forth let them speak at home or wherever they may be for they only blessing themselves and it's not for edification of the church then this person after speaking in the interpretation and then two or three judges according to St Paul's doctrine of the Bible that it must be judged by two or three judges then let the person and whom it calls upon to go it maybe it might designate a certain person or the pastor or someone to go lay hands on this person and it it's sick or Afflicted and they will be healed then let the pastor or the other person whoever it may be it was designated by the Holy Spirit to go pray the prayer of faith let them go and minister to the person according to what the spirit is said then at that time the person and whatever the Holy Spirit has said it shall take place immediately then just as the Holy Spirit has given then the people could rejoice and be thankful and praise and worship God because God wants to be worship then they must then they must bow their heads and be in prayer again to see if there be another message that the holy spirit will want these gifts to manifest before and then if any time that a person would speak in tongues and interpret and the the judges would send the person to take to do whatever it was said to be done and it doesn't come to pass then the whole group of them shall go to the Altar and there pray God to take that spirit away from them because there's no one would want a spirit like that we would know it would be false and would be of the enemy and not of God because God can only tell truth let that be clearly understood by the church before you start this this new order then perhaps maybe it would be something like this the message would say to a certain brother maybe it say would live by a railroad track or something to have him to move out because there is going to be a wreck on the road or something or anything in that order and let the judges after they give the church permission to speak or to exercise this uh message has just went forth if their judgment is it's of God then watch and see if it comes to pass and if it comes to pass thank God and be very graceful graceful in your heart towards him and give him praise and worship and be humble Above All Things be humble don't never get yourself puffed up to a place where you know more about it than your pastor or the church that you're worshiping in if you get to that place then ID advise each one of you to get another place to worship with because I am asking the pastor never to permit anything outside of the Bible order a way we have seen it here in the church and then we want these gifts to be operated in place and the worshippers if it's carried on correctly according to the word you'll see a mighty wonderful Church an operation for our Lord Jesus Christ now then the next thing shall take place will be that if these people who have that gets out of order uh during these times that a deacon or some uh Usher that's filled with the Holy Ghost and got lots of Grace in their heart shall go to the person reverently fatherly like and shall correct them in this manner or the pastor whoever it may be which would be more essential for the deacons to do so for the pastor at this time while these spiritual services are going on should be in the prayer room or somewhere a Praying these messages then if there's no messages going on no Revelations then the people would be privileged if they desired to raise and give a testimony a testimony only for the glory of God they're not bound to do this but testimonies should be given before the message or any song service starts or anything testimonies in these worship services do you understand church that in doing this you have the whole church in the spirit of worship before the word comes in to be taught then the Holy Spirit gets in the word and manifest God through the word to be a confirmation of your worship now then after this uh time for the pastor to come on if messages are going on say the pastor should come out exactly say 7:30 and or quarter of 8 and if these messages are still going on before the pastor comes to his out of his study or wherever he may to take his place at the platform some brothers should instruct him because the Saints knows that when the pastor comes on the platform it's his time then for the service and that gives plenty ample time for all the manifestations of the gifts to bring the spirit of God into the the congregation and if any unbeliever would happen to be there be disorderly a kindhearted person would go to them such as an urer or a deacon and would tell them if they would they would ask to be kept Reverend or be reverent while the service are is in order because the spirit is in the building and the gifts of God are being made manifest for the edifying of the church and this person must be told in love and not harshly unless it would come to a place where they were drinking or some disobedient or something other that would be interfering with the worship of Lo of the Lord uh which the gifts are then are being manifest then the person should will should be led out to one side to one of the back rooms or somewhere and be talked to and dealt with kindly now while the pastor comes to the platform as the pastor comes to the platform I would suggest as a brandom tabernacle here that the pastor lead the congregation and at least one or two good songs for we have found it so that when too many are trying to operate the in the church it brings on only trouble I would suggest as I did while I was pastoring at the church I led the songs myself and I feel that it would be a good thing if the pastor did so himself and in all prayer meetings where they're gathered together groups of prayer meetings the pastor must be at each one it should never be left to any individual to go lead such meetings for we have found it so that they get off the track on Doctrine and then it call bring it right back into the church and many time bring heresies and so forth which doesn't belong in the Church of the Living God and the pastor should be at all prayer meetings and so forth where congre Gatherings are and the pastors should never take sides in the meeting the saying that one group is this way and one that way the pastors should stand between both of them and go to them and get them reconciled immediately and if he can't get them reconciled let him take a deacon with him and then if the they want you neither Pastor nor Deacon then it should be told to the the church and as Jesus said let them be unto you as a heathen and a Publican and whatever you bind on Earth said Jesus I'll bind in heaven and what you loose on Earth I will loose in heaven now when the pastor comes to the platform let the pastor then lead at least one or two songs and go straight to the word not no time for these long testimony meetings and everybody get up and a word to say that does not prosper in the random Tabernacle if any peop who are listening to this tape and you it has prospered in your church well that's perfectly all right and we are very glad of that that it does prosper in your church but in our CH it does not it only causes confusion I've been pastoring here for 20 some odd years and I have found that it only cost causes confusion if you've got a testimony give it before the in the congregation of the people while the spirits are blessing and so forth are the real way to testify is not in the church is out in Dark Places let your light shine where it's dark go to Road houses and different places and where sin and things is heaping then let your light shine there is the place to do it but however if the Lord has blessed you and give you some great special blessing or something that you have to tell the people do it in time of the other service the pre-service the preliminary or when the spirit is blessing and giving testimonies and Revelations and tongues and interpretations and so forth in the worship of the Saints before the word of God is being brought forth then the pastor after leading this himym shall immediately lead the church in prayer and a congregational prayer himself as he stands at the platform asking the rest of them to Bow their heads in prayer this we have found to be a greater blessing and a more ruy and operating in the church and then the next thing the pastor should do then if they had a real spiritual meeting with the gifts making manifest many secrets of the people's hearts and things which should be done by the gifts in the meeting then the spirit of God is in the meeting and it's very easy then for the pastor to find the spirit of God which is already in the meeting on the word of God as he reads and starts preaching the pastor then preach anything that the Holy Spirit would put on his heart whatever he wishes to do standing there but the congregation is the only they can rejoice as he is preaching of course or say Amen when the word comes forth but as far as getting up and giving uh uh messages and tongues and an interpretation while the Holy Spirit is working through the pastor the scripture condemns that and said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet the pastor then must call this individual down and ask them to be reverent and to keep their place the pastor must be a man that has got a very humble way about him but not too humble for what he could be like the Lord Jesus Christ when he seen wrong going on in the church he platted ropes and ran them out of the church and now the Church of God is the house of judgment and the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder is a high thing in the apostolic church outside of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his message straight to the Altar and the Elder gives it to the people the Saints in their gifts shall have their place first the worship them come together which brings as I said before the spirit of the Lord in the building for the pastor and it makes him much easier for the Holy Spirit to work through him then when a good spiritual meeting has just proceeded his teaching and then the Holy Spirit gets into the word and teaches the word has just been manifested by the gifts and then the aler call is being made then asward and many then will see and know Accord according to the working of the Holy Spirit and the word of God which a pastor places it on that you are the Church of the Living God and as Paul said of old he'll fall down and say truly God is with you now in these things let it be done with reverence and now to the pastor to our brother Neville at this time remember he is the full head of the church brother nebble has a right to exercise any Authority that the Holy Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit would tell him to say in other words in the church he has a right to anything that God would lead him to do he also has a right over his Deacon board he can change the Deacon board the trustees or or pianist or any other office in the church that he desires to change feeling led by the Holy Spirit uh to do so and whatever he does I'll recognize it as he I believe to be a godly man I'll recognize it to be of the Lord and will sanction the same therefore it gives him the authority then to operate the church the the way he feels led to do it now are any office in the church that he desires to to to uh switch uh positions with people well he has the authority to do that which I trust that this will always be lovely and never have to be used now may the Lord bless you all and I trust that this will be uh carried out to the very best of your knowledge and may the Holy Spirit watch over each one of you and may every officer of the church fill his post of Duty knowing this that God is going to hold you responsible for how you help your office in the church each one will have to give an account and to the leoty and the dear gifted Saints that's in our church those who who prophesy or speak with tongues or interpret or have Revelations we are just so happy to have you in the church and we will give you full cooperation in everything that the Holy Spirit shall prove that he has said to you and we love you and we we believe that these gifts are in you and that if you have the right opportunity and the scripturally presentation of it that you will make great workers in our midst and may the Lord bless you all is my sincere prayer Christians since listening to this tape I have a one thing that I seen I left out and that is this that while people are speaking with tongues it must be in the courses of two or three according to the scriptures that is there's only two or three messages to be given in each single service after that according to the scriptures at these course this must be only two or three so may you carry these things out accordingly a way the Holy Spirit has D directed it in his Bible and this is the best of my knowledge the way to do it Paul said let them be by courses two or three when they're speaking the Lord bless you amen am men did he speak to you tonight amen don't you love the Simplicity of the Gospel I'm sitting there and I'm wondering in this short about 30 minutes he's touched on so many things in very simple ways that I just marvel at the way these things come anyway so this is Brother Braham setting the church in order and we all understand that uh I at this point he had been preaching and many people had come in from different denominations and with it comes different ways of doing things and in his own word he says he let it all go he said even he let even brother nille he felt that let it go till a time when he felt the people are more established in the faith and then from that point on he started putting these things in order and so I believe it's very relevant for us as well to just start looking at these things embracing these things and working on how um it could help us because the important thing is this whenever divine order is to establish the presence of God descends right if anything at all that you do once it is done exactly according to what God says he comes down to prove it he did it for Solomon he did it for Moses when the word itself came on earth and the word went to the prophet and it was baptized he came to confirm it at the day of Pentecost when they gathered according to the word of Jesus so every time this divine order is firmly established God comes in our mid to confirm it and so that is what I'm looking that way we listen to these things and look at ways that we could also live by it now elsewhere not in this message but R says take them and remember them as the Commandments of God specifically for you so God HS us responsible for the place we have been placed and then he says I'm looking to you to carry these things out the way that I'm saying them because somebody has to be had around here and so I believe everything and the membership of the church the the deacons and how we come to church early on time and and spend our time not talking to anybody spend our time praying and just being mindful of keeping quiet and not disturbing everybody I think a lot has is covered in this little T and all the other Church order uh tapes actually have some good stuff and for me personally um um one thing that I found very revealing is when he mentions judges because Paul covers it very little like I think in Corinthians Paul talks about it in a very short way and so I read it and I know that all around the world in Christianity many people don't know and then he comes and he brings breaks it down and tells us how it is if you have the gifted meeting and the judges anyway I'm very grateful that's what I want to say I'll invite the musician CU there isn't much more to go on yes so now we all know our duties and our expectations and so we pray that the Lord will be will bless us and help us to sech his church in order so that we can experience that presence that we so long for shall we sing leaning on the Everlasting arm what a
