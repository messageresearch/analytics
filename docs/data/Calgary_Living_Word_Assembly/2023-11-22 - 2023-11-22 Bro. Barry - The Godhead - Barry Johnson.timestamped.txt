[39:37] Mercies in our lives sister

[39:43] lot
[39:44] recently certainly praying for her and
[39:48] just ask the Lord to give you a rest
[39:50] now have a couple of requests we'd like
[39:52] to bring before the church tonight one
[39:54] unspoken request you want to bring a
[39:58] request Carpenters had for a person they
[40:00] know I'm sorry I couldn't get a clear
[40:03] name but I said we would pray amen
[40:06] hallelujah we have another request
[40:07] tonight that we want to remember brother
[40:09] Frank
[40:10] kronite he needs a touch from the
[40:13] Lord request has been given and We Know
[40:16] that heaven is already
[40:20] aware you know the song that we just
[40:22] sang it just hit me when I was walking
[40:24] up that we could replace that word
[40:26] strength with
[40:29] faith and you know his faith starts when
[40:33] we can look and see how feeble we really
[40:36] are his faith starts when our faith
[40:40] ends so tonight let's just unite
[40:43] together in prayer for these requests as
[40:45] we go to the Lord in prayer if you have
[40:48] a need maybe just make it known with an
[40:50] uplift
[40:52] hand gracious Heavenly Father tonight we
[40:54] are so thankful that we can can gather
[40:56] together in Your Name
[40:58] Lord we know that there's so many places
[41:01] so many things that we could be doing
[41:04] but Lord there's something that is in
[41:06] the hearts of your children that
[41:07] constrains us to gather together in your
[41:10] name yes Lord because we know the
[41:12] scripture says where two or three are
[41:14] gathered together in your name you're
[41:16] there in the midst yes Lord so father
[41:19] whether you're here in this building or
[41:21] you're you're in a car somewhere or
[41:23] maybe in a living room father it doesn't
[41:25] matter
[41:26] because the building has no no no no
[41:31] preeminence but it's
[41:33] truly where we gather together in your
[41:36] name and father tonight we're so
[41:39] thankful that we can be here we just
[41:41] want to remember each and every request
[41:42] that was made known father tonight by
[41:45] The Uplift hand father we thank you for
[41:47] the needs in our lives and we know that
[41:49] you're more than able and father I pray
[41:52] that tonight the songs that we sing
[41:54] father wouldn't just be tradition but it
[41:56] would truly be an expression of the the
[41:58] faith in our hearts Lord towards you and
[42:02] father we pray that tonight we could
[42:04] just also remember these other requests
[42:07] Lord the Carpenters requests Lord thank
[42:09] you for saving them from a terrible
[42:11] accident hitting a deer Lord Jesus and
[42:14] helping them to find a solution for
[42:15] their car Lord we pray that you would
[42:17] touch the the person that they have a
[42:19] desire to to bring their their name
[42:21] forward Lord to bring their need we know
[42:23] that you're you're fully aware of it
[42:25] father and we just just commit that need
[42:27] into your hands now Lord we just want to
[42:30] Father we want to remember brother Frank
[42:33] kronite Lord and sister
[42:36] Pamela father the entire family tonight
[42:39] Lord
[42:40] Jesus we know that they're all watching
[42:43] father a man that believes you father
[42:46] and we know that sometimes we we find
[42:49] ourselves in positions that we can't
[42:51] even
[42:52] explain and we know that that's for a
[42:55] purpose that's for the purpose so that
[42:57] we will not try and have our faith our
[43:00] faith means nothing but Lord Jesus when
[43:02] your faith comes on the scene we know
[43:04] there's no devil in hell that can stand
[43:06] in our way and Lord we just pray that
[43:09] your will would be done in brother Frank
[43:11] KRON kite's life tonight Lord father
[43:14] that you would raise him up off that bed
[43:16] Lord that's our desire and father we
[43:19] just pray that that would be yours as
[43:20] well but we know that your Prophet said
[43:22] that we shouldn't pray to change your
[43:24] mind we should pray to change our mind
[43:27] and father we want our mind to be in
[43:29] line with your word because we know that
[43:31] your word is your will and father we
[43:33] don't want to try and make anything
[43:34] happen that you don't want and we want
[43:36] to see everything happen that you want
[43:38] to happen so tonight we just want to
[43:40] commit brother Frank kronite into your
[43:43] hands father sovereignly tonight Lord
[43:46] that your will would be done in his life
[43:48] father that it would come to pass
[43:50] exactly the way that you desire father
[43:53] we pray for each one of his children
[43:55] Lord that their Faith would increase
[43:57] Lord through this trial Lord that they
[43:59] would have the desire to cry out to you
[44:02] Lord in a greater way that they would
[44:04] Lord Jesus want to hear from Heaven
[44:07] father Lord we just pray for sister
[44:10] Pamela father that you would give her
[44:12] the strength Lord Jesus that a husband's
[44:14] wife needs that's going through a trial
[44:16] like this Lord and only the person going
[44:19] through a trial like this would ever
[44:20] know what kind of pressure what kind of
[44:22] pain what kind of fear what kind of
[44:24] anxiety would come over her but father
[44:27] we pray that you would just bear her up
[44:29] tonight on the wings of an eagle oh
[44:32] father that Lord as we heard your
[44:34] Prophet talk about that time that he
[44:36] needed to go and find a juniper tree
[44:39] Lord and how the prophet just painted
[44:41] that picture where you had all those
[44:43] angels but you said not just any Angel
[44:45] but the angel with the soft hands let
[44:48] that angel be the one to go and visit
[44:50] our sister tonight Lord hallelujah
[44:53] father that you would just comfort her
[44:56] amen and we pray that Lord that same
[44:58] Angel would comfort brother Frank Lord
[45:02] Lord Jesus we pray that Lord you would
[45:04] just be with them Father that you would
[45:06] Lord have your will and your way in that
[45:09] circumstance in that
[45:10] situation father tonight we just want to
[45:13] commit this service now into your hands
[45:16] father Lord For Your Glory we pray that
[45:19] Lord Jesus you would stop the words that

[48:00] calendars um once again with the uh
[48:04] Brethren coming from Africa there's
[48:06] brothers that are involved in the
[48:08] scheduling and uh we're just one of the
[48:11] stops along the way and I I was asked if
[48:14] we could make the arrangements to change
[48:16] it to help the other churches the other
[48:18] Brethren and I just said sure we're
[48:21] we're flexible here I I truly want to
[48:24] make it easy for everyone so I hope it's
[48:27] all right with you that I did that but
[48:30] so brother Timothy asong will be here
[48:31] November the 29th which is next
[48:33] Wednesday night are you happy tonight
[48:36] amen um certainly excited about the word
[48:41] and uh I know I feel a little bit
[48:44] nervous and I know when that happens
[48:47] that something's happening there's uh
[48:50] there's something that doesn't want this
[48:52] to happen and we're just going to do it
[48:53] we're going to go for it we're going to
[48:55] trust the Lord amen we're carrying on
[48:58] our study with the uh the exposition of
[49:01] the seven Church ages and uh I just want
[49:05] to read from paragraph
[49:07] 24 kind of pick up where we left off
[49:10] last
[49:13] time brother Bram says the time is at
[49:16] hand and that's right out of verse verse
[49:20] three
[49:22] here I believe it is the time is at
[49:27] hand are you able to bring that up the
[49:30] exposition of the seven Church
[49:32] ages paragraph
[49:40] 24 the ending of verse three he
[49:44] says I'll just read verse three blessed
[49:47] is he that readeth and they that hear
[49:49] the words of this prophecy and keep
[49:51] those things which are written therein
[49:54] for the time is at hand amen and you
[49:57] know brothers and sisters the time is at
[49:59] hand time is
[50:03] here I'm not sure whether the paragraphs
[50:06] in this book they
[50:09] don't all right so if you just type in
[50:11] the time is at hand if you can search it
[50:14] it's right at the very beginning before
[50:15] the
[50:19] salutation I'll just start reading
[50:22] and the time is at hand he says the time
[50:25] was not at hand previously in the wisdom
[50:27] and economy of God this Mighty
[50:31] Revelation though fully known to God
[50:34] could not come forth hither
[50:37] to he says thus we immediately learn a
[50:40] principle the revelation of God for each
[50:43] age can come in that age only and at a
[50:47] specific
[50:49] time isn't it wonderful to think that we
[50:52] are at that specific time Amen to think
[50:54] that that Mighty Revelation is actually
[50:59] here and I know probably tonight I'm not
[51:02] I'm not saying anything we don't already
[51:03] know and uh I just think about what we
[51:06] heard last Wednesday and talking about
[51:08] the seals and the vials and the trumpets
[51:10] and the Thunders and you know there's a
[51:13] lot of depth to that but I believe that
[51:15] there's a lot of depth to this book here
[51:17] that we are reading and uh I personally
[51:21] I wonder how um how he's going to go
[51:26] with uh uh service number two on that
[51:28] because I felt like the end of that
[51:30] service was pretty good pretty
[51:32] Monumental last Wednesday so it's going
[51:34] to be interesting to see but you know
[51:36] brothers and sisters we're talking about
[51:37] the Revelation that we've heard about
[51:39] the last couple of services the
[51:40] revelation of Jesus Christ and that's
[51:42] exactly what the very first words are in
[51:44] the very first chapter and the very
[51:46] first verse of the Book of Revelation
[51:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ and that
[51:52] is the mighty Revelation that we're
[51:53] talking about in this age the revelation
[51:56] of Jesus Christ to the individual
[51:59] personally not a Jesus of another age
[52:02] not a Jesus of the future not a Jesus of
[52:05] the past but the Jesus of right now the
[52:09] Great I Am the I am not the I will be or
[52:13] the I was which many people tend to do
[52:16] and we certainly don't want to do that
[52:18] tonight but this is what we're talking
[52:19] about is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:22] paragraph 25 here or the next paragraph
[52:25] look at the history of Israel the the
[52:27] revelation of God to Moses came only at
[52:30] a specific time of history and even more
[52:33] specifically it came as the people Cried
[52:36] unto God Jesus himself came at the
[52:40] fullness of time he being the complete
[52:43] revelation of the godhead and in this
[52:47] age leodan the revelation of God will
[52:51] come in its due time it will not falter
[52:54] neither will it be
[52:57] premature he says think on this and heed
[53:00] it will for we are at the end time
[53:04] today just beautiful I think it's so
[53:07] wonderful we're going to get into the
[53:09] godhead tonight and uh I don't know if
[53:11] we'll get out of it tonight I don't know
[53:12] if we can ever get out of it but we're
[53:14] going to get into the godhead and I
[53:16] think that's why there's such a uh maybe
[53:18] a pressure or something but the
[53:21] salutation John to the seven churches
[53:24] which are in Asia
[53:25] Grace be unto you and peace from him
[53:28] which is and which was and which is to
[53:32] come and from the seven spirits Spirits
[53:36] which are before his throne and from
[53:39] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[53:42] and the first begotten of the dead and
[53:44] the prince of the kings of the earth
[53:47] unto him that loved us and washed us
[53:50] from our sins in his own blood than you
[53:53] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[53:56] God and his father to him be glory and
[54:00] Dominion forever and ever amen we know
[54:04] that's Revelations 1: 14-6 I didn't want
[54:07] to go into that too far tonight but it's
[54:11] just beautiful when we can read this
[54:12] because remember when we read scriptures
[54:15] like this he is the same yesterday today
[54:18] and forever he doesn't ever change he's
[54:21] is as immutable in his nature as he is
[54:24] in his ways he cannot change he cannot
[54:27] change he cannot change Hebrews 138
[54:30] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:33] and
[54:34] forever the next paragraph the word Asia
[54:37] is actually Asia Minor it's a small
[54:39] parcel of land about the size of Indiana
[54:42] the seven churches there were especially
[54:46] picked from all other churches for their
[54:49] characteristics which same
[54:51] characteristics would be found in the
[54:52] successive ages centuries later
[54:55] the seven spirits Before the Throne is
[54:58] the spirit that was in each of the seven
[55:02] Messengers giving them their Ministries
[55:05] for the age in which each
[55:09] lived now all these
[55:12] Expressions him which is and which was
[55:17] and which is to come and faithful
[55:20] witness and first born among the dead
[55:24] and Prince of the kings of the earth and
[55:27] the Alpha and Omega and the almighty are
[55:32] titles and descriptions of the one and
[55:36] the same person amen who is the Lord
[55:39] Jesus Christ am who washed us from our
[55:43] sins in his own blood now I'm just going
[55:46] to pause there for a second and just
[55:48] mention this and and maybe I don't know
[55:51] I hope nobody gets upset by it but I I
[55:54] watched a movie this week called Paul
[55:57] the Apostle and I think it's the one
[55:59] that came out in in 2000 it's a fairly
[56:02] late movie but you know if you watch
[56:05] that movie it's interesting in there
[56:07] because it depicts how they actually got
[56:10] away from talking about Yahweh talking
[56:13] about Jehovah the Mighty God and and
[56:16] Paul started to actually talk about
[56:18] Jesus and remember he was a Pharisee of
[56:20] Pharisees he had a lot of friends in
[56:23] really high places and how he actually
[56:25] came against them after his experience
[56:28] on the road to Damascus when he actually
[56:31] met Jesus Christ himself I don't want to
[56:34] preach Paul tonight but what I do want
[56:36] to say is it's interesting to think that
[56:40] he was able to start to talk about Jesus
[56:45] Christ as being God back there right at
[56:50] the very beginning of the church ages
[56:53] Paul started to bring the doctrine of
[56:56] Jesus Christ amen it was it was even
[56:59] before John was actually on the aisle of
[57:03] patmas John was was years later on the
[57:06] aisle of patmas Paul was preaching Jesus
[57:09] Christ as being God and boy did it
[57:11] ruffle feathers but you know it Ruffles
[57:14] feathers today too and you know I I I
[57:17] think it's interesting because how how
[57:19] does it ruffle feathers people get
[57:21] really upset when you start to talk
[57:24] about how the only way you're going to
[57:26] get the Holy Ghost the true baptism of
[57:28] the Holy Ghost according to the message
[57:30] given to us by a Vindicated prophet in
[57:32] our day is to actually be baptized in
[57:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[57:37] the remission of your sins according to
[57:38] acts 238 but if we are just going to say
[57:41] no I've only been baptized in titles and
[57:44] that's what I was taught and that's what
[57:45] my father was taught and that's what my
[57:46] grandmother was taught that's what our
[57:48] whole family was taught That's What We
[57:49] believe We believe that all the way
[57:51] along what is that I'll say it this way
[57:54] it's one of those Idols it's one of
[57:56] those Groves that we've planted nice
[57:58] trees around it's one of those high
[58:00] places where we've taken an idea and
[58:03] made it supersede what the word of God
[58:06] says because how can you actually how
[58:10] can you argue with the word of God to
[58:12] get baptized in the name of the father
[58:15] what's the name of the father in the
[58:17] name of the son in the name of the Holy
[58:21] Ghost titles aren't names we're going to
[58:25] get right into that but I just think
[58:26] it's beautiful Paul was bringing this
[58:28] before John went to the aisle of patmas
[58:31] the next paragraph the spirit of God in
[58:33] John Expresses thusly in order to set
[58:36] forth the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[58:41] amen ask someone if they've been
[58:44] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:46] Christ and if they've been baptized in
[58:49] titles it's almost uh a bit of a dispute
[58:54] that that you'll have on your
[58:57] hands people don't like to be challenged
[58:59] on this
[59:01] stuff but what it what was it the spirit
[59:03] of God and John Expresses usly in order
[59:05] to set forth his Supreme deity of Jesus
[59:08] Christ and to reveal the godhead as one
[59:12] God now people who are theologians today
[59:15] are quick to just take and pigeon hole
[59:17] people that say you know the the three
[59:20] are one you're just Oneness but no we're
[59:23] not just Oneness amen we believe that
[59:26] God operates through three
[59:28] manifestations in three offices of the
[59:31] same person one person not
[59:34] three he says today there is a gross
[59:37] error it is that there are three Gods
[59:40] instead of one this Revelation as given
[59:43] to John by Jesus himself corrects that
[59:47] error
[59:49] amen how many times have we had errors
[59:51] in our
[59:53] life I I'm probably the king of Errors
[59:57] myself I have a lot of errors but you
[1:00:00] know what happens when we get an error
[1:00:02] according to the word of God all we have
[1:00:05] to do is just align ourselves with the
[1:00:07] word of God you know it's got nothing to
[1:00:09] do with a personality it's got nothing
[1:00:12] to do with a theological study or
[1:00:14] teaching it's got everything to do with
[1:00:16] the word of
[1:00:17] God but why can't people just align with
[1:00:20] the word of God some people weren't
[1:00:22] actually created to do that
[1:00:25] today there's a gross ER it's that there
[1:00:27] are three Gods instead of one this
[1:00:28] Revelation as given to John by Jesus
[1:00:32] himself corrects that error it's not
[1:00:36] that there are three Gods but one God
[1:00:40] with three offices there is one God with
[1:00:44] three titles Father Son and Holy
[1:00:49] Ghost I'm just going to go slow with
[1:00:51] this I just really want to let this sink
[1:00:53] in he said says this Mighty Revelation
[1:00:56] again we have another Mighty revelation
[1:00:59] we just read the mighty Revelation that
[1:01:02] that we immediately learned the
[1:01:03] principle that the revelation of God for
[1:01:05] each age can only come to that age and
[1:01:07] at a specific time and so now here we
[1:01:09] have a prophet of God writing this book
[1:01:12] preaching this message before he wrote
[1:01:15] this book but preaching this message
[1:01:17] that there's one God with three
[1:01:18] manifestations three different offices
[1:01:21] this Mighty Revelation is what the early
[1:01:23] church had
[1:01:25] and it must be restored in this last day
[1:01:27] amen along with the correct formula of
[1:01:30] water baptism why is that why would we
[1:01:33] have to actually be corrected why would
[1:01:35] we have to have the correct form of
[1:01:37] water baptism because if we're not
[1:01:39] baptizing correctly according to what
[1:01:41] the word of God has set out in Acts 238
[1:01:44] if we're not doing that then we're truly
[1:01:46] not following the formula then we're not
[1:01:48] going to get the Holy Ghost and Satan
[1:01:50] knows that assuredly that we will not
[1:01:52] get the Holy Ghost we will have have an
[1:01:55] anointing we'll have an inspiration
[1:01:58] we'll have all the religious
[1:02:00] motion but if we don't get the Holy
[1:02:02] Ghost we don't have the token remember
[1:02:05] we talked about it we we know this story
[1:02:07] about the children of Israel and and and
[1:02:10] we even heard a testimony about how
[1:02:12] important it is for the father to make
[1:02:14] sure that that token's applied to the
[1:02:16] home the whole family's looking to daddy
[1:02:19] daddy have you put that token up if you
[1:02:21] don't put it up right then the death
[1:02:23] angel is at our door
[1:02:25] we're going to
[1:02:27] die think about the pressure the Daddy
[1:02:29] has we know we can't play we have to
[1:02:32] make sure that we got that token and
[1:02:34] that's what this Mighty Revelation is is
[1:02:36] entitling us to the Token because what
[1:02:38] is it full obedience to what the
[1:02:41] complete word of God entitles us to the
[1:02:44] token and anything else is going to be a
[1:02:47] derivative it's going to be something
[1:02:49] that's just a little bit different a
[1:02:50] little bit off we're not going to have
[1:02:51] the right
[1:02:52] thing and Satan knows that and Satan's
[1:02:56] going to play with that he's going to
[1:02:57] have a Heyday with that we're going to
[1:02:59] think that we've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:01] actually not that's no place to be we
[1:03:04] don't want to be there that that way but
[1:03:06] this Mighty Revelation is is what the
[1:03:08] early church had and it must be restored
[1:03:10] in this last day isn't it wonderful to
[1:03:12] know that we've been given the direction
[1:03:13] we've been given the instruction we've
[1:03:15] been given a Vindicated Prophet someone
[1:03:17] that would actually be showing mankind
[1:03:20] showing the world that God is with him
[1:03:22] and not just to get healed and not just
[1:03:24] to have a wonderful time and say he's a
[1:03:26] great man of God let's let's let's let's
[1:03:28] praise the Lord and have great meetings
[1:03:30] but let's get back to the right formula
[1:03:32] of water baptism let's get right back to
[1:03:34] the middle of the road with the word of
[1:03:36] God let's see the restoration of the
[1:03:39] word for our day amen two Mighty
[1:03:42] Revelations we've read now get that
[1:03:45] correct formula of water baptism then we
[1:03:46] get the token then we could apply that
[1:03:49] token brother bradam says it in the
[1:03:50] token that when we can take that token
[1:03:53] and we can actually hold it over over
[1:03:54] our prayers and we can say I know that
[1:03:57] my flesh I can't hold my flesh over my
[1:03:59] prayers my flesh this this is the Beast
[1:04:02] nature right here this is genetically
[1:04:05] flawed I can't hold that over my prayers
[1:04:07] but oh my I can take the token and know
[1:04:09] that I've got the Holy Ghost and say you
[1:04:11] know what I I don't know anything about
[1:04:13] anything and I just take this token and
[1:04:15] I actually make this what I put over my
[1:04:18] prayers if we want to see whether we've
[1:04:20] got the Holy Ghost are we willing to
[1:04:21] Humble oursel to the word of God that's
[1:04:23] one of the sure signs whether we've got
[1:04:25] the holy ghost or not if we're not
[1:04:27] willing to Humble ourselves to the word
[1:04:29] of God brothers and sisters then I would
[1:04:31] have to say I don't know whether we've
[1:04:32] got the Holy Ghost in our lives but if
[1:04:34] you've got the desire for the holy ghost
[1:04:36] in your life then simply humble yourself
[1:04:38] to the word of God follow the
[1:04:40] instructions of the word of God and you
[1:04:43] will get the token you'll get the Holy
[1:04:45] Ghost in your
[1:04:46] life pram goes on to say now modern
[1:04:48] theologians won't agree with me for here
[1:04:51] is what is written in a great Christian
[1:04:53] magazine that that teaching on the
[1:04:55] Trinity is at the very heart and core of
[1:04:58] the Old Testament it's every wit as much
[1:05:01] at the heart of the and core of the New
[1:05:03] Testament the New Testament is just as
[1:05:06] much opposed as the Old Testament is to
[1:05:10] the thought that there are more Gods
[1:05:14] than one
[1:05:16] yes yet the New Testament with equal
[1:05:19] clearness teaches that the father is God
[1:05:22] and the son is God and the Holy spirit
[1:05:24] is God and that these three are not
[1:05:27] three aspects of the same person but
[1:05:31] three persons standing in a truly
[1:05:34] personal relationship to one
[1:05:36] another there we have the great doctrine
[1:05:39] of the three persons but one
[1:05:42] God they also State God according to the
[1:05:46] Bible is not just one person but he is
[1:05:50] three persons in one God that is the
[1:05:54] great mystery of the
[1:05:57] Trinity I I I had never encountered this
[1:06:00] before in my life until just recently
[1:06:01] this year I actually met someone who is
[1:06:04] a theologian who who really really
[1:06:06] challenged me on
[1:06:08] this I love the way brother badam says
[1:06:11] this I got to stop getting in the middle
[1:06:12] of it here he says they also State God
[1:06:15] according to the Bible is not just one
[1:06:16] person but he's three persons in one God
[1:06:19] that is the great mystery of the Trinity
[1:06:21] he says it sure is how can three persons
[1:06:25] be in one God not only is there no Bible
[1:06:27] for it but it shows even a lack of
[1:06:31] intelligent reasoning yes sir that's
[1:06:34] pretty strong yes sir but I just think
[1:06:37] it's it's beautiful because we could say
[1:06:38] show us anywhere in the Bible show us
[1:06:41] anywhere in the Bible where they
[1:06:43] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:06:44] of the son and of the Holy Ghost there
[1:06:46] was a commission to go and do that but
[1:06:49] show us where that happened the unic
[1:06:51] wasn't baptized in the name of the
[1:06:52] father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:06:54] the Ethiopian unic he was baptized in
[1:06:57] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ three distinct
[1:07:03] persons though identical substance make
[1:07:06] three gods or language has lost its
[1:07:09] meaning
[1:07:10] entirely just listen to these words
[1:07:13] again I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:07:15] and ending saith the Lord which is and
[1:07:18] which was and which is to come the
[1:07:21] almighty this is deity this this is not
[1:07:24] simply a prophet a man this is God and
[1:07:28] it is not a revelation of three Gods but
[1:07:31] of one God the
[1:07:33] almighty
[1:07:36] Hallelujah you know I I heard something
[1:07:39] this last couple weeks I can't even
[1:07:42] remember where exactly when it was I
[1:07:44] heard it but you know the Alpha and
[1:07:46] Omega for those people that don't know
[1:07:48] that's the beginning and the ending of
[1:07:50] the Greek language Alpha is the
[1:07:53] beginning Omega is the ending the A and
[1:07:55] the
[1:07:56] Z there is actually a letter in there
[1:08:00] and it's
[1:08:01] Iota and I think it's just beautiful
[1:08:04] because you know we can't actually
[1:08:07] deviate one iota from the word of God
[1:08:11] right and you know it goes even further
[1:08:14] for the people who are truly the elected
[1:08:16] they can't deviate one iota from the
[1:08:19] word of God through a Vindicated Prophet
[1:08:22] because if we deviate one iota brothers
[1:08:24] and sisters we're going to be out yes
[1:08:26] sir we're not going to actually hit that
[1:08:28] Mark that we're looking to hit yes sir
[1:08:31] so he's the Alpha and the Omega and
[1:08:34] every single thing in between I haven't
[1:08:36] studied it but I just heard that one
[1:08:38] thing
[1:08:40] ioda one iota one little speck one
[1:08:43] little part boy we don't want to be off
[1:08:45] we want to make sure that we know
[1:08:47] exactly where we
[1:08:48] stand goes on to say they didn't believe
[1:08:50] in three gods in the beginning of the
[1:08:52] church you can't find that sort of
[1:08:54] belief amongst the apostles it was after
[1:08:57] the apostolic age that this Theory came
[1:08:59] in and really became an issue and a
[1:09:02] cardinal Doctrine at the nyine
[1:09:05] council the doctrine of godhead caused a
[1:09:08] two-way split at
[1:09:09] NAA and and we know that was in in
[1:09:14] 324
[1:09:16] 325 Ad nian
[1:09:20] Council actually I apologize
[1:09:25] yeah 325 ad I just got a little note
[1:09:28] about it the first Council of NAA 325
[1:09:31] the first ecumenical council of the
[1:09:33] Christian church meeting in ancient NAA
[1:09:37] now is Nick turkey it was called by the
[1:09:42] emperor Constantine 1 an unbaptized
[1:09:46] cuman who presided over the opening
[1:09:49] session and took part in the discussions
[1:09:53] he hoped to General Council of the
[1:09:54] church would solve the problem created
[1:09:57] in the Eastern Church by
[1:10:00] arianism and her a heresy first proposed
[1:10:04] by Aras of Alexandria that affirmed that
[1:10:07] Christ is not Divine but a created being
[1:10:11] Pope Sylvester I did not attend the
[1:10:14] council but was represented by the
[1:10:17] gates so it's definitely there in the
[1:10:20] history we can look it up and and go a
[1:10:22] whole lot further with it I don't really
[1:10:24] intend to I I believe anyone who is
[1:10:26] interested can certainly do that but we
[1:10:30] know that it's actually uh a real thing
[1:10:32] it's out of the history books it's not
[1:10:34] just something that somebody brought we
[1:10:36] can't just say that maybe William Ari
[1:10:38] and brandham brought this idea that
[1:10:40] there was a a nine Council this is
[1:10:42] history that we're talking about
[1:10:45] here we know that it caused a two-way
[1:10:47] split at Nia and from that split there
[1:10:50] came two extreme extremes one actually
[1:10:53] went into polytheism that's three
[1:10:56] believing in three gods and the others
[1:10:58] went into Unitarianism one that's that's
[1:11:03] the one God Oneness of course that was a
[1:11:06] little while and coming about but it did
[1:11:09] and we have it right today but the
[1:11:11] Revelation through John by the spirit to
[1:11:13] the churches was I am the Lord Jesus
[1:11:17] Christ and I am all of it there isn't
[1:11:20] any other God and he put his seal on
[1:11:23] this re reation he sent his Angel and
[1:11:26] signified it unto his servant John it's
[1:11:29] so beautiful and we can say that's
[1:11:31] happened to us in our day it's just a
[1:11:33] wonderful thing you know I just can't
[1:11:36] help but think this is just an exact
[1:11:38] example of the horse riders we heard a
[1:11:41] bit about it last Wednesday the horse
[1:11:44] riders you know it starts out as a
[1:11:46] Doctrine as a discussion and then it
[1:11:48] turns into a manifestation naturally
[1:11:51] speaking it goes into government the
[1:11:53] church is State become one then they
[1:11:55] turn into the horse riders we could go
[1:11:57] into that I don't really want to go too
[1:11:59] far with that but you can see it
[1:12:00] happening here after the apostles had
[1:12:04] left the
[1:12:06] scene uh carrying on it says consider
[1:12:09] this who was the father of
[1:12:11] Jesus such a good discussion Matthew
[1:12:13] 1:18 says she was found with child of
[1:12:16] the Holy Ghost but Jesus himself claimed
[1:12:20] that God was his father God the the
[1:12:23] father and God the Holy Ghost as we
[1:12:26] often express these terms make the
[1:12:29] father and the spirit one indeed they
[1:12:32] are or else Jesus had two
[1:12:35] fathers but notice that Jesus said that
[1:12:38] he and his father were one not two that
[1:12:41] makes one
[1:12:43] God we've got to be able to read between
[1:12:45] the lines when you read the word of God
[1:12:47] we can't just take the word of God and
[1:12:49] read it literally and and feel like it's
[1:12:51] just going to actually make sense like
[1:12:54] we would read a book and and study our
[1:12:56] way into it it won't
[1:12:59] happen the next paragraph since this is
[1:13:01] historically and scripturally true
[1:13:03] people wonder where the three came from
[1:13:06] it became a foundational Doctrine at the
[1:13:08] nyine council 325 ad this Trinity an
[1:13:12] absolutely unscriptural word was based
[1:13:15] upon the many gods of Rome the Romans
[1:13:18] had many gods to whom they prayed they
[1:13:20] also prayed to ancestors as mediators it
[1:13:23] was just a step to give new names to old
[1:13:27] gods so we have saints to make it more
[1:13:30] biblical thus instead of Jupiter Venus
[1:13:32] Mars Etc we have Paul Peter Fatima
[1:13:36] Christopher etc etc they could not make
[1:13:38] up their Pagan religion work out with
[1:13:41] just one God so they split him up into
[1:13:44] three and they made intercessors of the
[1:13:48] Saints as they had made intercessors of
[1:13:51] their ancestors
[1:13:54] I had to pause there and just take a
[1:13:56] look at it and I know that there's
[1:13:58] intercession of the Saints it's in the
[1:14:00] Apostles Creed it's in the nian Creed
[1:14:03] there's Creeds for both of those and we
[1:14:05] know that intercession of the Saints is
[1:14:07] praying to the people who have already
[1:14:09] gone on thinking that they would
[1:14:11] actually be able to do something for us
[1:14:14] and uh it it's it's it's amazing
[1:14:18] actually that
[1:14:21] uh that they do it but it's it's it's
[1:14:24] prevalent I actually looked it up in
[1:14:27] uh I looked it up and it's quite
[1:14:30] prevalent amongst churches today and uh
[1:14:33] it's just in there it's just one of
[1:14:35] those things that's in there it's on
[1:14:36] their website and uh you can see what
[1:14:38] they believe about us you you just want
[1:14:40] to see if a church is trinitarian you
[1:14:42] can just click on that about us and
[1:14:44] you'll see the Apostles Creed in there
[1:14:46] you know they're trinitarian that's
[1:14:48] where they stand that's what they
[1:14:49] believe and you know we could go into a
[1:14:51] circumstance like that brother and
[1:14:53] sisters and we could sit in a church
[1:14:55] like that and we could hear preaching
[1:14:56] that would be anointed preaching in in a
[1:14:59] circumstance or a situation like that
[1:15:01] but you know what could happen in a
[1:15:03] circumstance or situation like that
[1:15:05] Spirits travel on Words and unless
[1:15:08] you're actually feeding at the right
[1:15:10] table unless you actually know right
[1:15:12] where you stand you're going to have
[1:15:14] spirits that are going to get on you and
[1:15:16] get in you and get around you and cause
[1:15:19] tremendous turmoil in your life
[1:15:22] amen we certainly don't want to put
[1:15:24] ourselves in a position like
[1:15:27] that I just think this uh this book is
[1:15:30] amazing we don't want to be having
[1:15:32] intercession of saints we don't want to
[1:15:34] be praying to the people who have gone
[1:15:36] on and who are dead we don't believe in
[1:15:38] spirit spirituality we don't believe in
[1:15:41] any of that stuff we believe in the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost in one God manifesting in our
[1:15:46] lives the next paragraph says ever since
[1:15:49] then the people have failed to realize
[1:15:52] that there is just one God with three
[1:15:54] offices or manifestations they know
[1:15:57] there is one God according to the
[1:15:59] scripture but they try to make it the
[1:16:01] Fantastic theory that God is like a
[1:16:03] bunch of grapes three persons with the
[1:16:06] same Divinity shared equally by all but
[1:16:09] it plainly says here in Revelation that
[1:16:12] Jesus is that which is that which was
[1:16:17] and that which is to come he is the
[1:16:20] Alpha and Omega which means he is the A
[1:16:24] to Z or the all of it amen and I want to
[1:16:28] say everything in between he is
[1:16:31] everything the almighty he is the rose
[1:16:33] of Sharon the lily of the valley the
[1:16:35] Bright Morning Star the righteous Branch
[1:16:37] the Father the Son the Holy Ghost he is
[1:16:40] God almighty God one God Amen one
[1:16:46] God goes on to say and without
[1:16:49] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:16:51] godliness God was was manifest In the
[1:16:54] Flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[1:16:56] angels preached unto Gentiles believed
[1:16:58] on in the world and received up into
[1:17:01] Glory 1 Timothy
[1:17:06] 3:16 it's true without controversy great
[1:17:09] is the mystery of
[1:17:10] godliness isn't it wonderful to hear
[1:17:13] that to look at that amen without
[1:17:15] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:17:17] godliness so just pause there for a
[1:17:18] little bit without controversy brothers
[1:17:21] and sisters great is the mystery of
[1:17:22] godliness in your lives to this world
[1:17:25] around people look at us and think
[1:17:26] what's wrong with you you're you're
[1:17:28] crazy there's something different about
[1:17:30] you why do you behave the way that you
[1:17:32] do and and maybe even Fanatics for
[1:17:35] believing what you
[1:17:38] believe turn over with me to Colossians
[1:17:45] 2 still have a few minutes here
[1:17:47] Colossians chapter
[1:17:51] 2 that a scripture come on my heart as
[1:17:53] we
[1:18:02] were as I was studying this
[1:18:08] here great is the mystery of godliness
[1:18:12] amen Colossians chapter 2 verse
[1:18:18] 1 for I would that ye knew what great
[1:18:22] conflict I have for
[1:18:24] you and for them at
[1:18:27] leoda and for as many as have not seen
[1:18:30] my face in the
[1:18:33] flesh that their hearts might be
[1:18:36] comforted being knit together in love
[1:18:39] and unto all Riches of the full
[1:18:41] Assurance of
[1:18:43] understanding to the acknowledgment of
[1:18:45] the mystery of
[1:18:47] God and of the father and of Christ in
[1:18:52] whom are are HID all the treasures of
[1:18:54] wisdom and
[1:18:56] knowledge and this I say lest any man
[1:18:59] should beguile you with enticing
[1:19:02] words for though I be absent in the
[1:19:04] flesh yet I am with you in the spirit
[1:19:09] joying and beholding your order and the
[1:19:12] steadfastness of your faith in
[1:19:16] Christ as ye have therefore received
[1:19:19] Christ Jesus the
[1:19:21] Lord so walk in him rooted and built up
[1:19:26] in him and established in the faith as
[1:19:29] ye have been taught abounding therein
[1:19:32] with
[1:19:33] Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil
[1:19:37] you through philosophy and vain deceit
[1:19:41] after the tradition of men after the
[1:19:44] rudiments of the world and not after
[1:19:48] Christ for in him dwelleth all the
[1:19:52] fullness of the godhead
[1:19:56] bodily I don't understand how anybody
[1:19:58] could dispute the fact that Jesus Christ
[1:20:01] was
[1:20:02] God especially since it's right there in
[1:20:04] the word
[1:20:06] amen in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:20:10] the godhead bodily in his body in his
[1:20:16] flesh brother Bram says this is what the
[1:20:18] Bible says it doesn't say a thing about
[1:20:22] first
[1:20:23] or second or third person here it said
[1:20:27] God it says God was manifest in flesh
[1:20:31] one God that one God was manifest in
[1:20:35] flesh that ought to settle it God came
[1:20:39] in human form that didn't make him
[1:20:42] another
[1:20:43] God he was God the same
[1:20:48] God it was a revelation then and it's a
[1:20:51] revelation now
[1:20:53] one
[1:20:54] God brothers and sisters if we can see
[1:20:57] this I just want to say this tonight if
[1:20:59] we can see this if we can understand
[1:21:00] this don't take this for granted this is
[1:21:04] this is a a tremendous Revelation th
[1:21:07] this is one of the greatest Revelations
[1:21:09] that we could ever
[1:21:11] get he goes on to say let's go back in
[1:21:13] the Bible and see what he was in the
[1:21:16] beginning according to the Revelation he
[1:21:19] gave of himself the great Jehovah
[1:21:21] appeared to Israel and Pillar of Fire as
[1:21:24] the angel of the Covenant he lived in
[1:21:26] that Pillar of Fire and led Israel daily
[1:21:29] isn't it wonderful how he talks like
[1:21:31] this yes sir how many people have seen
[1:21:33] that Pillar of Fire picture in our
[1:21:36] day as the angel of the Covenant
[1:21:38] Covenant he lived in that Pillar of Fire
[1:21:40] and led Israel daily and at the temple
[1:21:43] he announced his coming with what a
[1:21:45] great cloud and then one day he was
[1:21:48] manifest in a virgin born body that was
[1:21:51] prepared for him I just just can't help
[1:21:53] but think brothers and sisters I want to
[1:21:54] preach here now this is getting me fired
[1:21:56] up when you look at this here he's
[1:21:57] talking about how Israel was led by a
[1:21:59] pillar of Fire by night right in the
[1:22:02] evening time it shall be light you'll
[1:22:04] have a pillar of fire we can see that
[1:22:05] this is the evening time we've had a
[1:22:07] pillar of fire in our day we know that
[1:22:10] first there was a pillar of fire then
[1:22:11] there was a great Cloud that came in
[1:22:14] 1963 that great Cloud announced
[1:22:16] something it wasn't just something
[1:22:18] fantastic that happened on top of a
[1:22:19] mountain in Arizona that could create a
[1:22:21] bunch of of of of pyramid-shaped rocks
[1:22:24] that people could get as paper weights
[1:22:26] brothers and sisters that was something
[1:22:28] that he's talking about right here first
[1:22:30] a pillar of fire then he announced his
[1:22:32] coming with a great Cloud then one day
[1:22:35] he was manifest in a virgin born body
[1:22:37] don't take that and put that off on Mary
[1:22:39] somewhere in past he is the same
[1:22:41] yesterday today and forever brothers and
[1:22:43] sisters if you've taken this word of the
[1:22:45] message of the hour through a Vindicated
[1:22:47] Prophet into your womb you are that
[1:22:49] virgin for today he's Jesus Christ the
[1:22:52] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:22:54] that thing that's born inside of you is
[1:22:57] of the Holy
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:23:00] Ghost yes I then one day he was manifest
[1:23:05] in a virgin born body that was prepared
[1:23:07] for him have you been prepared for him
[1:23:10] the god that tabernacled above the tents
[1:23:12] of Israel now took on himself a tent of
[1:23:15] Flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst
[1:23:19] men but he was the same God Amen don't
[1:23:23] put them off somewhere else brothers and
[1:23:24] sisters bring them right home bring them
[1:23:27] home and say right here he's created
[1:23:29] that little space in this heart for
[1:23:31] himself and when I took that word into
[1:23:34] my womb into that little spot that made
[1:23:36] me a virgin because only a virgin can
[1:23:39] receive that word everyone else in the
[1:23:41] world is going to say it's crazy it's
[1:23:43] fanaticism it's a cult it's some other
[1:23:46] thing but there's only a few people that
[1:23:48] are going to be able to say amen that's
[1:23:50] my word that's coming into my word womb
[1:23:52] I'm going to take that word inside of me
[1:23:55] we know that animals they search out for
[1:23:57] the right genetics before they will
[1:23:59] actually reproduce they want healthy the
[1:24:02] Bride of Jesus Christ is the same
[1:24:04] nothing will satisfy her except for that
[1:24:07] word that pure word of God and when she
[1:24:10] gets that into her womb something
[1:24:11] happens brothers and sisters something
[1:24:14] happens it changes us we become a new
[1:24:16] creature in Christ Jesus
[1:24:19] amen the Bible teaches that God was in
[1:24:22] Christ the body was Jesus in him dwelt
[1:24:27] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:24:30] period I love that nothing can be pler
[1:24:33] than that mystery yes but actual truth
[1:24:36] it can't be pler so if he wasn't three
[1:24:39] people then he can't be three now one
[1:24:42] God and this same God was made
[1:24:46] flesh Jesus said in John 16: 27-28 I
[1:24:50] came from God and I go back to God that
[1:24:52] is exactly what happened he disappeared
[1:24:54] from Earth by way of his death burial
[1:24:56] and resurrection and
[1:24:58] Ascension but then Paul met him on the
[1:25:00] road to
[1:25:01] Damascus oh my I just I'll throw this
[1:25:04] plug in there again brothers and sisters
[1:25:05] if you want to see the visual you got to
[1:25:06] watch that movie it's good it's really
[1:25:08] good when you look at it through the
[1:25:10] filter of the message it's really good
[1:25:12] it's a good show if you're going to
[1:25:14] watch something watch something that
[1:25:15] edifies us the word of
[1:25:18] God nothing can be plainer than that
[1:25:21] mystery yes but actual truth it can't be
[1:25:23] pler so if he wasn't three people then
[1:25:26] he can't be three now one God and the
[1:25:28] same God was made flesh sorry I went
[1:25:31] back too far Jesus said in in John 1627
[1:25:34] and 28 I came from God I go back to God
[1:25:36] that's exactly what happened he
[1:25:37] disappeared from Earth by the way of his
[1:25:39] death burial resurrection and Ascension
[1:25:42] then Paul met him on the road to
[1:25:43] Damascus and he spoke to Paul and said
[1:25:46] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me Paul
[1:25:50] said who art thou Lord M and he said I'm
[1:25:54] Jesus why didn't he say I'm
[1:25:58] God he said I'm Jesus he was a pillar of
[1:26:02] fire yes a blinding light he had turned
[1:26:06] back exactly as he said he would back to
[1:26:09] the same form that he was before he took
[1:26:12] on a tabernacle of Flesh yes sir that's
[1:26:15] exactly how John saw it how do you see
[1:26:18] it tonight brothers and sisters don't
[1:26:21] tell me as we heard on Sunday don't tell
[1:26:22] me you look at brother bradam and you
[1:26:24] see God tabernacled in flesh that was
[1:26:27] elzer he came and he did his job and
[1:26:30] that was to introduce a bride to Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ that's why he was here not so
[1:26:36] that we could worship him not so that we
[1:26:38] could pilgrimage to his place and and
[1:26:41] say that we were followers of voice of
[1:26:44] God and all of that be followers of
[1:26:46] Christ I saw a clip and if anybody's
[1:26:49] interested you might have seen it
[1:26:50] already I don't know but it's a brother
[1:26:51] I I can't even remember his name he
[1:26:53] preaches and he says why it's titled why
[1:26:56] I left the message and he says basically
[1:26:59] in nutshell you never met the message
[1:27:01] you don't have the message if you left
[1:27:03] the message because you're the message
[1:27:06] when you've taken the message that
[1:27:07] William Bram brought it's Jesus Christ
[1:27:10] how could you leave Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ right that's what the message is
[1:27:16] oh my no man hath seen God at any
[1:27:20] time the only begotten son which is in
[1:27:23] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[1:27:25] him amen hallelujah just talking about
[1:27:28] this godhead bodily I just want to pause
[1:27:30] there for a second in him dwelt the
[1:27:33] fullness of the godhead bodily Jesus
[1:27:36] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:27:38] forever the same one today that was
[1:27:40] there then on the road to Damascus that
[1:27:43] was there when Jesus Christ went on the
[1:27:45] cross was there the same one when he was
[1:27:48] Elohim before he even was God before the
[1:27:52] world was ever into existence when he
[1:27:54] was the self-existing one the same one
[1:27:57] who is here tonight dealing with us amen
[1:28:00] all the
[1:28:01] fullness out of the message the Rapture
[1:28:04] brother Bram says I've always preached
[1:28:06] that he was deity not just a man he was
[1:28:10] God manifested In the Flesh God the
[1:28:15] attribute of god of love
[1:28:18] amen isn't it interesting because he
[1:28:21] didn't come and actually Scorn the
[1:28:23] people he came and straightened out the
[1:28:26] religious Pious ones the ones who felt
[1:28:29] like they were something because of
[1:28:30] something they've achieved but the ones
[1:28:32] that he came for were the ones that were
[1:28:34] adulterers or or or prostitutes or
[1:28:37] drunkards all of the people in the world
[1:28:39] that really needed someone to come and
[1:28:41] help them that's who he came for that
[1:28:43] was deity and what did he do he brought
[1:28:46] love to them he was the attribute of god
[1:28:48] of love the great attributes that come
[1:28:51] down display laid here on Earth of God
[1:28:54] Jesus was God's love which built a body
[1:28:57] that Jehovah himself lived in he was the
[1:29:01] fullness of the godhead bodily what God
[1:29:05] was he manifested through that body that
[1:29:09] body had to die so he could wash the
[1:29:12] bride with his blood amen hallelujah it
[1:29:16] couldn't be a separate person if it was
[1:29:18] a separate person there wasn't a perfect
[1:29:20] sacrifice that were lost as lost can be
[1:29:23] God's only provided place of worship
[1:29:25] 1965 God's only provided plan for his
[1:29:28] age his sons in the word
[1:29:31] age
[1:29:33] today his sons in the word age quickened
[1:29:36] by the Spirit light a spark that's lit
[1:29:39] off something to make it alive you
[1:29:42] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:29:44] when that spark goes down into that womb
[1:29:46] and seated now in Heavenly places in
[1:29:48] present
[1:29:50] tense Satan's going going to say no
[1:29:52] you're not look at you're sitting right
[1:29:53] here in this church here and a few
[1:29:55] minutes you're going to go and jump in
[1:29:56] your vehicles and you're going to be
[1:29:57] seated there then you're going to go
[1:29:58] home and you're probably going to sit on
[1:29:59] your couch you're going to be seated
[1:30:00] there we're going to look at this flesh
[1:30:02] and we're going to say yeah I'm seated
[1:30:03] here look at this problem I'm seated in
[1:30:04] the middle of this problem yep but
[1:30:06] that's not what the word says brothers
[1:30:08] and sisters we got to look past all this
[1:30:10] flesh we got to look past all of this
[1:30:12] distraction we've got here on Earth and
[1:30:14] realize the word of God says that we're
[1:30:16] already seated in Heavenly places that
[1:30:18] means that you can't lose brothers and
[1:30:19] sisters what would you do if you
[1:30:21] couldn't fail because you
[1:30:25] can't and seated now in Heavenly places
[1:30:28] in present tense already alive and
[1:30:31] subject to every promise in the word
[1:30:34] then what does that do you being a part
[1:30:37] of God's Gene a part of the word other
[1:30:41] men a part of God's word seated together
[1:30:44] manifest the entire body of Christ
[1:30:49] amen are we manifesting the entire Body
[1:30:52] of Christ
[1:30:53] tonight oh my you know I'll stand here
[1:30:56] and say I don't feel like it but that
[1:30:58] doesn't matter the Vindicated Prophet
[1:31:00] said that I
[1:31:01] am and I'm willing to take his word for
[1:31:04] it amen I had a brother say to me you
[1:31:07] know we were talking about this we're
[1:31:08] having some fellowship about the prophet
[1:31:10] and the Vindication of the prophet and
[1:31:11] how we have ideas and and theories and
[1:31:14] he said it like this to me one day if we
[1:31:16] were to look at this wall and say that
[1:31:17] it's a tan and maybe we just have the
[1:31:19] scientific code name for it and and we
[1:31:22] can look at it and everybody could agree
[1:31:24] that that wall there is 10 with that
[1:31:26] scientific number and the paint code
[1:31:28] that you could get paint matched
[1:31:29] everybody understands what I'm talking
[1:31:30] about right that wall is a specific
[1:31:32] color if the prophet of God said that
[1:31:34] was a purple wall even though every
[1:31:37] sense in my body could see that it's a
[1:31:38] tan colored wall I would call that wall
[1:31:41] purple because that's what the
[1:31:43] Vindicated Prophet said and you know we
[1:31:45] got to be willing to do that brothers
[1:31:46] and sisters we got to go beyond our
[1:31:48] senses our emotions our feelings our
[1:31:51] flesh we got to go Way Beyond all of
[1:31:52] that and just say Amen to the word of
[1:31:55] God because that's the only thing that's
[1:31:57] going to change our
[1:31:59] bodies other men AP part of God's word
[1:32:02] seated together manifest the entire body
[1:32:04] of Christ because there's no leaven
[1:32:06] among you we all know what Lev is we'll
[1:32:08] preach on that one day it's a real good
[1:32:10] study see what he's talking about
[1:32:12] brother Brown no leaven among you just
[1:32:15] the word only seated in Heavenly places
[1:32:18] in the door where he put his name Jes
[1:32:21] Jesus Christ no man will come unto the
[1:32:24] father except by who except by Me Jesus
[1:32:30] speaking there brother randam goes on to
[1:32:32] say no 11 among you that brings the
[1:32:34] entire fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:32:36] among you right so
[1:32:38] beautiful love that the revelation of
[1:32:42] Jesus
[1:32:43] Christ now remember this is the
[1:32:46] Revelation and whosoever heareth it and
[1:32:49] don't keep the sayings of this book his
[1:32:51] part will be taken from The Book of Life
[1:32:54] Jesus is not revealing himself as three
[1:32:58] Gods but one God and three offices oh
[1:33:02] it's going to get rich after a while
[1:33:04] when we get into those Church ages and
[1:33:06] see where they lost
[1:33:09] that caused a great split in I and
[1:33:11] Council both of them went off on two
[1:33:13] deep
[1:33:15] ends and this is where I want to get to
[1:33:17] tonight brothers and sisters and they
[1:33:18] done the same thing in this last days
[1:33:20] again just like the preying Council
[1:33:23] again CU there will be another one just
[1:33:27] as certain as I'm standing here the
[1:33:29] Catholic and Protestant churches will
[1:33:33] unite something together or agree with
[1:33:36] one
[1:33:37] another I I just want to say this I've
[1:33:39] said it in the past and maybe I'll I'll
[1:33:41] send it out I was going to try and play
[1:33:42] it tonight but I won't I'll send it out
[1:33:44] on on the what's happened if you want to
[1:33:46] watch it you can the the the Tony Palmer
[1:33:50] uh encounter and you can see the
[1:33:53] Vindication of the Prophet talking
[1:33:55] because that actually is already
[1:33:57] happened this isn't something that's
[1:33:59] going to be happening in the future
[1:34:00] maybe when the whole world is falling
[1:34:02] apart this world is going to blow up and
[1:34:04] and and then there's going to be a new
[1:34:05] nyine Council the prophet of God said
[1:34:07] there's going to be a new one and it's
[1:34:10] already happened it's already history we
[1:34:14] are so far down the road right now if
[1:34:16] anybody wonders about what's going on in
[1:34:18] in Palestine in Israel and and Gaza take
[1:34:20] a look at the book of of Amos read the
[1:34:22] very beginning of the Book of Amos and
[1:34:24] see what Amos had to say about Gaza
[1:34:27] maybe it was a few thousand years but
[1:34:31] boy it's the word of God we're not
[1:34:34] saying that this is something that we're
[1:34:35] saying and we don't want to see someone
[1:34:37] in a bad spot we're not saying anything
[1:34:39] we're just saying this is the word of
[1:34:40] God and we can recognize the day in
[1:34:41] which we live we live in perilous times
[1:34:44] brothers and sisters but isn't it good
[1:34:45] to know we've got the token there's a
[1:34:48] desire in our hearts when we have an
[1:34:50] issue when we have a problem we always
[1:34:52] want to just line up with the word of
[1:34:54] God our bodies Our flesh our minds are
[1:34:56] always going to take us contrary to the
[1:34:58] word of God but that token inside of us
[1:35:01] is going to say no realign re-calibrate
[1:35:04] that Compass just come back just get
[1:35:06] back on track again brother bam goes on
[1:35:09] to say and theyve done that same thing
[1:35:11] in this last days again just like a
[1:35:13] preene council again because there will
[1:35:15] be another one just as certain as I'm
[1:35:18] standing here the Catholic and
[1:35:19] Protestant churches will Unite something
[1:35:21] together or agree with one another look
[1:35:23] at the Archbishop Mur over there now all
[1:35:26] of its heaping right up together and
[1:35:28] there is not a Triune God teaching in
[1:35:31] the Bible there's one
[1:35:34] God one
[1:35:36] God I was going to get into uh I was
[1:35:39] going to get into a little bit in
[1:35:41] Colossians maybe we'll get there I'll
[1:35:43] just continue reading on in the church
[1:35:44] age book here brother bam says he was
[1:35:46] born the Christ and eight days later
[1:35:49] when he was circumcised he was named
[1:35:52] Jesus even as the angel had told them I
[1:35:56] just think this part is so significant
[1:35:58] this just this just clenches it doesn't
[1:36:00] it I was born of brandom he says when I
[1:36:03] was born they gave me the name of
[1:36:06] William he was Christ but he was given a
[1:36:10] name down here among men and what is
[1:36:13] Christ the scent one right we know that
[1:36:16] that's what that is Christ is a sent one
[1:36:18] he was sent but he had to be given a
[1:36:21] name among men that outward Tabernacle
[1:36:24] men could see was called Jesus he was
[1:36:27] The Lord Of Glory the almighty manifest
[1:36:30] in flesh he is God the Father Son and
[1:36:34] Holy Ghost he is all
[1:36:37] that Father Son and Holy Ghost are just
[1:36:41] titles they are not names that is why we
[1:36:45] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ for that is a name not a title it
[1:36:51] is the name of those
[1:36:53] titles so clear maybe it sounds
[1:36:57] confusing and it's just worth getting
[1:37:00] this and reading it maybe a couple times
[1:37:01] it's the name of those titles the name
[1:37:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ just like you
[1:37:07] take a newborn baby who is a son and you
[1:37:10] name him baby is what it is son is the
[1:37:15] title and you name him John Henry ba
[1:37:19] Brown you don't just baptize in jesus'
[1:37:23] name there are thousands of Jesus
[1:37:27] jesuses in the world and have been even
[1:37:32] before Jesus our savior but there is
[1:37:35] only one of them born the
[1:37:37] Christ Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:41] amen let's turn over to oh we're already
[1:37:44] there yeah
[1:37:46] sorry I I wanted to get into this a
[1:37:48] little
[1:37:49] further amen in uh Colossians and we
[1:37:52] might have to pick this up later I don't
[1:37:54] want to keep us late brother Bram says
[1:37:57] people talk about Jesus being the
[1:37:58] Eternal Son of God now isn't that a
[1:38:01] contradiction who ever heard of a son
[1:38:04] being Eternal sons have Beginnings but
[1:38:07] that which is eternal never had a
[1:38:09] beginning he is the Eternal god Jehovah
[1:38:12] manifested in the
[1:38:14] flesh St John's gospel it says in the
[1:38:17] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:38:18] God the Word was God and the word was
[1:38:21] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:38:24] know that that was Jesus Christ the same
[1:38:27] yesterday today and forever but out of
[1:38:29] Colossians
[1:38:31] 2:8 I just wanted to read this here
[1:38:35] beware lest any man spoil you through
[1:38:38] philosophy and vain deceit after the
[1:38:41] tradition of men after the rudiments of
[1:38:44] the world and not after Christ because
[1:38:47] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:38:50] the godhe head bodily isn't it
[1:38:52] interesting because we can look at verse
[1:38:54] 9 and say for in him dwelleth all the
[1:38:56] fullness of the godhead bodily but the
[1:38:58] verse right before it says something
[1:39:01] really really important beware lest any
[1:39:05] man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:39:09] what and vain deceit after the tradition
[1:39:12] of
[1:39:13] men after the rudiments of the world and
[1:39:16] not after
[1:39:19] Christ the reason he's saying that that
[1:39:21] is because people will do
[1:39:23] it men will come around and spoil you
[1:39:26] through philosophy and they will spoil
[1:39:28] you through vain deceit after the
[1:39:30] tradition of men and after the rudiments
[1:39:33] of the world and not after Christ that's
[1:39:35] why this warning is there right before
[1:39:37] that verse talking about the
[1:39:40] godhead I think it's amazing so I took a
[1:39:43] look at this here philosophy I'll try
[1:39:45] and go quickly here the word philosophy
[1:39:47] just looked it up a little bit is the
[1:39:48] study of fundamental nature of knowledge
[1:39:50] real ity and existence especially when
[1:39:53] considered as an academic
[1:39:55] discipline fine take the word of God and
[1:39:57] make it an academic discipline hey then
[1:39:59] we become the theologians then we might
[1:40:01] as well go to Seminary we might as well
[1:40:03] accept the doctrine that they're going
[1:40:04] to give us it's kind of like going to
[1:40:06] University you know there's a a great
[1:40:08] debate on whether you should send
[1:40:09] children to go to university or not and
[1:40:12] I would I've never gone to University so
[1:40:14] maybe I'm going to get jumped on when I
[1:40:15] leave the building here but I'm going to
[1:40:17] say it anyway cuz I feel led to there's
[1:40:19] something important that's taught in
[1:40:21] universities and it's called critical
[1:40:23] thinking right it's called being able to
[1:40:25] think and reason for yourself and when
[1:40:27] you go to university they teach you a
[1:40:29] way to think and to reason I know that
[1:40:32] much and when that happens you cannot
[1:40:34] take that and apply it to the word of
[1:40:36] God if you try and do that you're going
[1:40:38] to get the wrong results amen the only
[1:40:41] way this word is going to be revealed to
[1:40:43] us is by the
[1:40:46] spirit word of God says
[1:40:49] beware beware that people are going to
[1:40:53] try and spoil you not just going to not
[1:40:56] just going to lead you away or make you
[1:40:58] confused spoil you through philosophy
[1:41:02] the study of fundamental nature of
[1:41:04] knowledge and reality in existence
[1:41:06] especially when considered as an
[1:41:07] academic discipline a particular system
[1:41:10] of philosophical
[1:41:12] thought don't want to get into
[1:41:15] that there's another one that says it's
[1:41:17] the study of a theoretical basis of a
[1:41:20] particular branch of knowledge or
[1:41:22] experience the philosophy of science and
[1:41:25] you know I've seen it where people can
[1:41:27] take and make this particular branch of
[1:41:31] knowledge or experience and and apply it
[1:41:34] to the philosophy of the Bible the
[1:41:36] philosophy of the word and say well it's
[1:41:38] my opinion I I can philosophy
[1:41:41] philos I don't even know the word I can
[1:41:43] make it my own opinion and and we can go
[1:41:45] on and on and on about that vain deceit
[1:41:48] out of strongs it means empty delusion
[1:41:52] Bain deceit you're going to have empty
[1:41:54] delusions and it just made me think
[1:41:56] about Ephesians chapter 4 this I say
[1:41:58] therefore and testifying the Lord that
[1:41:59] ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[1:42:02] walk in the vanity of their mind having
[1:42:04] their understanding darkened being
[1:42:06] alienated from the life of God through
[1:42:08] the ignorance that's in them because of
[1:42:10] the blindness of their heart right who
[1:42:13] being past feeling have given themselves
[1:42:15] over to lasciviousness to work all
[1:42:16] uncleanness with greediness brothers and
[1:42:19] sisters but ye have not so learned of
[1:42:21] Christ if we've heard the message of the
[1:42:24] hour if we have the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:42:26] Lives we have not so learned of Christ
[1:42:28] we're not doing this as a vain
[1:42:31] philosophy or a tradition you know
[1:42:34] tradition just a simple description of
[1:42:36] it is the transmission of Customs or
[1:42:38] beliefs from generation to generation or
[1:42:40] the fact of being passed on in this way
[1:42:42] this is what we believe maybe it's a
[1:42:44] little bit outside of what the prophet
[1:42:46] of God said but you know what we still
[1:42:48] have everything good in our lives we're
[1:42:49] not sick God's not punishing us
[1:42:51] everything is good we got a great job
[1:42:53] all these things are happening in our
[1:42:54] lives don't look at the natural brothers
[1:42:56] and sisters look at where we're going
[1:42:58] are we seated in Heavenly places in
[1:43:00] Christ Jesus because if we are we're
[1:43:01] going to follow the word of God and
[1:43:03] we're not going to deviate not one iota
[1:43:06] off of the message of the hour amen
[1:43:09] sometimes we can just take and and make
[1:43:10] a tradition and just pass it down to our
[1:43:12] children if we're not careful my
[1:43:13] goodness as parents we're going to
[1:43:15] answer for these things we're going to
[1:43:17] answer for these things it's important
[1:43:19] for us to make sure that we know where
[1:43:21] we stand oh my and you know what's it's
[1:43:25] really interesting is I've just really
[1:43:27] had this on my heart is um brother
[1:43:30] brandom said it what did the Catholic
[1:43:31] church say give us a child till when age
[1:43:35] five my goodness all my kids are past
[1:43:38] age five did I do it right I still have
[1:43:42] time I think I still have hope I want to
[1:43:45] make sure that they're not deviating not
[1:43:46] one iota off the word of God off the
[1:43:49] message of the hour amen right we're not
[1:43:51] careful we can get spoiled by these
[1:43:53] things brothers and sisters the
[1:43:55] rudiments of the world is is just simply
[1:43:57] it's the simplest and most basic facts
[1:44:00] about a subject or an activity we can
[1:44:02] say that we're just going to take the
[1:44:03] rudiments of the message we're going to
[1:44:05] take the rudiments of the word of God
[1:44:06] maybe I'm going to leave the message
[1:44:07] aside and just take the rudiments of the
[1:44:09] word and say Jesus only well you're not
[1:44:11] going to have Jesus if you don't come
[1:44:13] according to the word of God through a
[1:44:15] Vindicated Prophet
[1:44:17] amen I'm going to read this this this
[1:44:20] verse here I'll call the
[1:44:21] musicians as we close tonight I'm going
[1:44:24] to I'm going to read this verse out of
[1:44:25] the Amplified Bible it's it's verse 8
[1:44:28] and N of Colossians chapter
[1:44:31] 2 see to it that no one carries you off
[1:44:35] as
[1:44:36] spoil can you imagine that and we know
[1:44:39] that it's Devils that will do it but see
[1:44:41] to it that no one carries you off as
[1:44:43] spoil or makes you yourselves captive by
[1:44:47] his so-called philosophy and
[1:44:49] intellectualism
[1:44:51] and vain deceit idle fantasies and plain
[1:44:56] nonsense following human tradition you
[1:44:59] know there's so much idle fancies and
[1:45:02] and plain nonsense in the world even
[1:45:04] around Christianity we can see it and
[1:45:07] and you know it's interesting to see how
[1:45:10] there's many many movements we know that
[1:45:12] it came after the prophet was in the
[1:45:13] land after thus sayeth the Lord the real
[1:45:16] thus sayith the Lord was in the Land
[1:45:18] There was all these Faith healing minist
[1:45:20] mines now there's tremendous Ministries
[1:45:22] even now today someone can just wave
[1:45:24] their coat and 25 people 50 people 100
[1:45:27] people will just fall over and people
[1:45:29] will say wow that's a great move of
[1:45:31] God but do they actually line up with
[1:45:34] the word are they willing to take thus
[1:45:36] saith the Lord in their lives what's
[1:45:39] happened is they've actually been
[1:45:41] spoiled they've been Carried Away by
[1:45:43] some wind of Doctrine someone's come
[1:45:45] along and given them some kind of
[1:45:47] fantastic yeah see to it that no no one
[1:45:50] carries you off as spoil or makes you
[1:45:52] yourselves captive by his so-called
[1:45:55] philosophy and intellectualism and vain
[1:45:56] deceit idle fancies and plain nonsense
[1:45:59] following human tradition men's ideas of
[1:46:02] the material rather than the spiritual
[1:46:04] world just crude Notions following the
[1:46:07] rudimentary and El Elemental teachings
[1:46:10] of the universe and disregarding the
[1:46:12] teachings of Christ the Messiah I I just
[1:46:16] love reading this through the Amplified
[1:46:18] Bible because I know that just takes me
[1:46:20] right back to the message of the hour
[1:46:22] right back to the message of the hour
[1:46:24] and it doesn't take me off on some
[1:46:26] tangent and I know some folks say the
[1:46:28] the the Amplified is maybe a little
[1:46:30] funny because someone maybe who
[1:46:32] shouldn't be writing it did and I I I
[1:46:35] don't want to bring anything I I don't
[1:46:37] want to bring anything that's going to
[1:46:38] lead us astray brothers and sisters
[1:46:40] follow the word of God follow the
[1:46:41] message of the hour follow the thus
[1:46:43] sayith the Lord for today and we won't
[1:46:46] go wrong we we we just don't want to be
[1:46:48] disregarding the message
[1:46:50] and God only speaks to an age as we read
[1:46:53] earlier on he only speaks to an age
[1:46:56] through a prophet only that tremendous
[1:46:59] Revelation can come at a at a very
[1:47:01] specific time and if we have the ability
[1:47:03] to hear the message of the hour today
[1:47:05] brothers and sisters we have made it we
[1:47:07] have the greatest gift that we could
[1:47:09] ever get the only thing we need to do is
[1:47:10] just beli that's it and then we are
[1:47:13] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:47:15] Jesus maybe stand with me tonight as we
[1:47:18] close we'll continue to speak on this as
[1:47:21] we carry on but I I just think it's so
[1:47:24] beautiful how we can study this book

[1:47:30] Father we thank you for the the mighty
[1:47:33] Revelations that you've given us Lord to

[1:47:40] in us except for your spirit and father
[1:47:44] if there's anything that would Lord come
[1:47:46] against your word if there's anything in
