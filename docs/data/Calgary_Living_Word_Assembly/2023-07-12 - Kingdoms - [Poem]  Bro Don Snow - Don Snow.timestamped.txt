[0:04] thank you
[0:18] I'm glad on Thursday I called the pastor
[0:21] and said I felt led to read a poem
[0:23] because
[0:24] the way I was feeling this morning I
[0:25] wouldn't be standing here but I had
[0:27] already committed so
[0:30] this poem is called kingdoms
[0:34] it's based on the idea of free moral
[0:37] agency
[0:38] and how we can choose daily though we're
[0:40] Sons and Daughters of God
[0:43] which kingdom we give Credence to
[0:46] do we let our crop DNA rule
[0:49] or do we choose to give our Heavenly DNA
[0:52] preeminence
[0:54] for a long time I thought
[0:57] you know what does it mean to give God
[0:58] preeminence
[1:00] and we know
[1:02] Christ is the Living Word and if you
[1:04] truly want to give God preeminence you
[1:07] have a little spark in your heart
[1:10] Let It Grow and flourish that is truly
[1:12] given God preeminence that is the Living
[1:14] Word
[1:16] here we go
[1:18] choose you this day
[1:21] Heaven or Hell
[1:23] two kingdoms stand
[1:25] with differing spells
[1:28] Satan's realm were Shadows creep
[1:31] and God's domain where Faith runs deep
[1:36] in Satan's Eden Up Is Down
[1:39] in chaos reigns with an eerie frown
[1:44] deception flourishes
[1:46] twisted and cruel
[1:48] where wickedness thrives a venomous fuel
[1:53] but in the kingdom of God light does
[1:56] shine a sanctuary of love
[2:00] Oh So Divine
[2:02] where truth prevails
[2:05] Triumph and bold
[2:07] and Mercy's Tale
[2:09] in every heart's told
[2:12] opposing forces these Realms do share
[2:16] a battle on scene
[2:18] Beyond Earthly glare
[2:21] Satan's Temptations so enticingly sowing
[2:26] while God's grace and blessings
[2:29] perfect love honing
[2:32] trials in God's kingdom a blessing to
[2:35] find
[2:36] a pathway of growth
[2:39] to clear the mind
[2:41] each obstacle faced strength is revealed
[2:46] Faith deepened wounds healed and courage
[2:50] unsealed
[2:52] but in Satan's Dominion nothing but
[2:55] despair
[2:57] punishment's cruel
[2:59] burdens too hard to bear
[3:02] Temptations like snares
[3:04] lore Saul souls to fall
[3:07] desperation Echoes In darkness's thrall
[3:12] yet through these dichotomies a lesson
[3:15] we glean
[3:16] that blessing spring from trials
[3:19] unforeseen
[3:21] for in God's plan resilience is found
[3:25] Victory emerges
[3:27] with a triumphant sound
[3:30] for in sorry so let us Choose Wisely the
[3:34] kingdom we embrace
[3:36] through our decisions
[3:38] lay predestinations Chase
[3:44] in God's kingdom trials evoke growth and
[3:47] might
[3:49] while in Satan's grasp nothing but
[3:52] bruising blight
[3:54] Up Is Down and Down is up the great
[3:58] Paradox that fills eternity's little
[4:01] hiccup
[4:03] blessed is the kingdom of God
[4:05] a beacon so true
[4:08] it shall guide us steadfastly in all
[4:11] that we do Lord bless you all
[4:14] [Applause]
