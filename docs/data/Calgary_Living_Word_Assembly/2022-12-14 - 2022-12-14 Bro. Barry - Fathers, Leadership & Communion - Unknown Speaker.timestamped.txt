[23:14] narrow sea further until we cross that
[23:17] narrassey of unbelief there is no way we
[23:20] can reach that love but Heavenly Father
[23:22] we are here Lord Jesus Christ that you
[23:25] take away the spiritual Amnesia from us
[23:28] so that by you by opening our eyes to
[23:32] see who we are father you have called us

[44:43] direction read from uh First Corinthians
[44:46] chapter 11.
[44:48] I have a little thought and
[44:50] just trust the Lord will
[44:52] lead us and guide us
[44:58] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[45:02] we had been taking a
[45:04] a long study about families and just
[45:07] different angles about it and last week
[45:09] we talked about
[45:11] um
[45:12] stumbling blocks
[45:14] Balaam and balak
[45:17] today I want to talk about leadership
[45:21] First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 1.
[45:24] be ye followers of me even as I also am
[45:28] of Christ
[45:30] now I Praise You Brethren that you
[45:33] remember me in all things and keep the
[45:35] ordinances as I delivered them to you
[45:40] but I would have you know that the head
[45:43] of every man is Christ

[45:48] and the head of Christ is God
[45:51] let's just bow in prayer
[45:53] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[45:55] your word
[45:56] we know that it's only three scriptures
[45:59] we've read tonight but Lord Jesus we
[46:01] know
[46:02] that just one word from you could stop
[46:04] the universe Lord one word from you
[46:07] father can create life and father we
[46:10] know there's many words in those three
[46:12] scriptures and we just ask father that
[46:13] you would supernaturally break them open
[46:15] to us that you would speak to us father
[46:17] from your word tonight we just ask that
[46:20] you would allow us father to just draw
[46:22] closer unto you tonight father through

[46:28] name we pray amen God bless you tonight
[46:31] you may be seated
[46:33] you have a praise report I apologize I
[46:36] didn't say it earlier but I just wanted
[46:39] to maybe say it not in a prayer
[46:42] but we're thankful for the Lord sister
[46:44] Lane
[46:45] had come and asked for prayer
[46:47] she's had uh real issues with long covid
[46:51] affecting her lungs and taking her
[46:54] breath and not being able to function
[46:56] normally the way that she used to and
[46:59] you know we're going into 2023 now and
[47:02] that would have been 20 even before
[47:04] covid right is when you got it you got
[47:06] it before the pandemic basically and uh
[47:10] so when was that 19 or early in
[47:15] it was 20. yeah so we're just about a
[47:18] solid two years down the road
[47:20] but sister Lane came up for prayer and
[47:22] she brought a praise report today
[47:25] and uh the doctor said that her lungs
[47:27] are the best they've seen them in 17
[47:30] years
[47:37] that's the Lord we serve that's our God
[47:40] right there
[47:41] makes it so easy to worship when we have
[47:43] those testimonies in our life where we
[47:46] know that he's dealt with us and you
[47:49] know what that does is it just it just
[47:51] drives those roots deeper we know that
[47:54] the the tree gets blown in the storm and
[47:56] and it feels like the tree is going to
[47:58] blow over and snap sometimes and we just
[48:01] don't know if God is hearing our prayers
[48:03] by the way he makes us wait sometimes
[48:07] but in the waiting it creates an Avenue
[48:09] for those roots to go deeper when he
[48:11] does answer because when that happens
[48:13] then it doesn't matter what comes along
[48:15] nobody can talk us out of it because
[48:17] nobody talked us into it he deals with
[48:20] us sovereignly it's sort of such a
[48:21] beautiful thing
[48:22] I just yeah I love praise reports I
[48:26] personally believe that our God he wants
[48:29] more praise reports than he does prayer
[48:31] requests and as Believers I think we
[48:33] have the opportunity to bring him so
[48:35] many praise reports we have just like we
[48:38] have the opportunity to bring specials
[48:40] we can bring praise reports for what the
[48:42] Lord is doing and that's one reason I
[48:44] love that with communion Services
[48:46] because you know the devil don't want us
[48:48] talking about what God's doing for us he
[48:51] wants us to think that he's a dirty old
[48:53] grandpa and he just isn't listening to
[48:54] our prayers but he hears every single
[48:57] word that comes out of our mouth even
[48:59] when it's a thought in our heart
[49:03] just a couple of announcements we have
[49:05] the last prayer meeting of 2022 tomorrow
[49:07] evening at 7 30 at the church
[49:09] for those who can come
[49:11] on
[49:14] service on the 25th I don't know what I
[49:16] was doing there
[49:18] um forgive me the 25th we're going to
[49:20] have service and uh it's because it's
[49:22] Sunday it's not because it's Christmas I
[49:24] don't want to adapt to being uh because
[49:28] it's Christmas Day we're going to have a
[49:30] church service
[49:31] that's for denominations I believe and
[49:33] maybe the Catholic church but we've got
[49:35] service coming up on the 25th and uh we
[49:38] it's going to be a special day we have a
[49:40] baby dedication at the start of the
[49:41] service or maybe at the end and then we
[49:44] have a baptism as well
[49:46] it's going to be a beautiful day
[49:48] we're certainly excited about that we
[49:50] have a communion service on the 31st and
[49:52] we'll just see what the Lord will do
[49:54] there
[49:55] certainly don't want to try and keep
[49:57] everyone until midnight but if you know
[50:01] the spirit of the Lord moves we
[50:03] certainly want to give him the
[50:04] opportunity to do what he wants to do as
[50:05] well
[50:07] um I just wanted to
[50:09] mention it we probably won't be in
[50:12] service after the 31st until probably
[50:14] the 18th realistically we're supposed to
[50:17] return on the 14th from Philippines but
[50:20] we uh we don't know what time we will
[50:22] actually get here I think it's supposed
[50:24] to be about 4 30 in the afternoon but if
[50:26] we get any delays it could be quite late
[50:29] or early we just don't know so likely
[50:32] what I'll do is just not come to service
[50:34] unless we get here in good enough time
[50:37] on the 15th but we will definitely be in
[50:40] service on Wednesday the 18th
[50:42] talk to brother Mervin today
[50:45] um texted brother Mervin he uh had a
[50:48] wonderful wonderful service yesterday
[50:50] already and uh he's got the itinerary
[50:54] booked up he is putting together the
[50:57] services so he's giving us a real nice
[50:59] mix of uh fellowship and a time of rest
[51:03] I really wanted to get that for Lisa and
[51:05] my family so the first week we're going
[51:07] to take a little bit of time and have a
[51:09] little bit of Fellowship I don't think
[51:10] there's going to be very much preaching
[51:11] but boy once that first week is out of
[51:13] the way the itinerary changes and we're
[51:16] going to have some fun preaching it'll
[51:19] certainly be a nice time
[51:20] um I think we're gonna we're gonna see
[51:22] brother Ray Soriano I think that's his
[51:24] name
[51:26] um and another brother I can't remember
[51:27] his name but it's going to be a an
[51:29] interesting time
[51:31] but brother Marvin certainly has his
[51:32] work cut out for him as well but that's
[51:34] you know that's the heart of it you know
[51:36] you want to go and meet the Believers
[51:38] and you want to talk about the things of
[51:40] the Lord you don't want to just go on
[51:41] vacation to get away from Christ and get
[51:43] away from church you want to find
[51:45] Believers and and find people of like
[51:47] Precious Faith so that you can pour from
[51:49] one vessel into the other and find out
[51:51] that the very thing that you've been
[51:53] feeding on back home is exactly what's
[51:55] been inspiring the people on the other
[51:57] side of the globe it's the same spirit
[51:59] it's just a beautiful thing
[52:02] we uh yeah so that uh I think about does
[52:05] it for our announcements tonight God
[52:07] bless you
[52:09] um I just want to talk about leadership
[52:10] again uh probably about the husbands
[52:13] more than the wives continuing on sort
[52:16] of with the the family topics but you
[52:20] know in a nutshell
[52:21] as the husbands as the fathers of the
[52:24] home
[52:24] we are the leaders of the home we are
[52:27] the ones that need to be making sure
[52:31] everything is happening we're
[52:32] responsible for everything the buck
[52:35] stops with us so to speak as the
[52:37] husbands as the fathers and the whole
[52:39] entire family looks to us and we can
[52:41] preach all we want
[52:44] and not live it our family ain't going
[52:46] to live it if our family lives it it's
[52:48] going to be a miracle
[52:49] but if we live it that's a different
[52:52] story that's where the power of Christ
[52:54] begins to manifest in our homes and in
[52:57] our lives and I just felt so inspired to
[53:00] you know maybe continue on with this
[53:02] thought of of leadership and communion
[53:04] you know we have we want that sweet
[53:06] communion with the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:08] every day of Our Lives sometimes maybe
[53:11] more when we come to church but maybe in
[53:13] our prayer or when we read the word but
[53:16] we want that sweet communion but we have
[53:18] got to be able to be led if we can't be
[53:21] led then we can't have communion
[53:24] that's the way the Lord set things out
[53:26] and it's no accident that the prophet
[53:29] for our age the messenger brought
[53:31] leadership first as the second last
[53:34] message that was recorded and then
[53:36] communion
[53:38] leadership brings us into communion with
[53:42] the Lord
[53:43] and as as as Paul said here be followers
[53:47] of me even as I also am of Christ
[53:51] so I've just been pondering this thought
[53:54] how does he follow Christ you know one
[53:57] of the things he says that he dies daily
[53:59] Paul dies daily
[54:01] and and and were instructed to follow
[54:04] him as he follows Christ so are we dying
[54:07] daily
[54:08] we know that he crucifies this flesh
[54:10] another way that he follows Christ
[54:13] my goodness
[54:15] how many wants to crucify the flesh
[54:16] that's a tough one that one
[54:19] but we know going back I guess in one of
[54:22] our other discussions maybe services
[54:24] that every person brother Branham in
[54:26] leadership talks about it how every
[54:27] person has to be led every person that
[54:29] comes into this world is led into this
[54:30] world and Led Out of This World we're
[54:32] led into the world with doctors and
[54:34] nurses midwives however it is with our
[54:36] parents we're brought into this world
[54:37] and we go out of this world with people
[54:39] helping us when we get to the age where
[54:41] we're sick and die maybe it's a
[54:43] traumatic thing whatever it is when we
[54:45] go out of this world when we come into
[54:47] this world we're LED as a child we're
[54:49] led into into the things that we need to
[54:52] learn how to deal with stuff as an adult
[54:54] we're we're still LED we still have
[54:56] employers we still have rules and
[54:58] governments we still have magistrates we
[55:01] still have leadership that we have to
[55:03] abide by
[55:05] what we want to talk about tonight is
[55:07] spiritual leadership we have to have
[55:09] spiritual leadership it's according to
[55:11] the word of God
[55:13] we want that sweet communion with God
[55:15] and many accept that leadership but we
[55:17] know there's no real communion with God
[55:19] if we can't be led
[55:20] and you know I would say it this way
[55:23] it's as simple as following the
[55:24] instruction of the Prophet for the age
[55:27] if we can't follow that instruction then
[55:29] can we really truly have that communion
[55:31] that we're looking for
[55:33] some people don't have the opportunity
[55:35] maybe to to be in in Fellowship I
[55:39] wouldn't judge anyone that way what I
[55:41] would do is Judge the heart of a person
[55:44] because brother badam says the desire in
[55:47] the heart should be to be in Fellowship
[55:49] sometimes the Lord will put us in a
[55:51] position where we just can't go to
[55:53] church and that's the way it works who's
[55:56] going to question God we we know that he
[55:59] has a way of doing things but when we
[56:01] have something in our hearts that wants
[56:05] to actually say well I can take most of
[56:08] that word from the messenger of the age
[56:10] but not all of it I'm just going to
[56:11] press pause there and say maybe that was
[56:13] a cultural thing or maybe that's
[56:15] something that didn't apply to maybe my
[56:18] family my family had a good good success
[56:20] rate in in everything that they did and
[56:22] and their bank account was full and the
[56:24] kids got educated and and everyone still
[56:26] goes to church when they get around to
[56:28] it kind of thing it's not like that we
[56:31] have got to be able to follow follow all
[56:33] of the word of God for our day because
[56:35] Paul said ye followers of me even as I
[56:38] also am of Christ
[56:40] it's got to be the instruction of God we
[56:43] have got to be willing to follow the
[56:45] word of God he he wrote an epistle to
[56:48] the Ephesians chapter 4 and it laid out
[56:51] the pattern
[56:53] there's prophets there's teachers
[56:55] there's evangelists and there's pastors
[56:57] and that's God's Avenue to deal with
[57:00] people what's it for it's for the
[57:01] perfecting of the Saints
[57:03] but when we circumnavigate that and try
[57:05] to do it our own way
[57:07] and say well maybe the prophet said
[57:09] something and and take it and manipulate
[57:11] it to fit something that we we want or
[57:14] or desire that's different it doesn't
[57:16] work that way it won't work and brother
[57:19] Branham said so many different things
[57:22] um I just want to say one thing today
[57:23] I'm going to press pause there I just
[57:26] think it's such a beautiful thought
[57:28] just bear with me of course I
[57:31] I didn't quite
[57:33] get it in my notes but I just think it's
[57:35] so beautiful I read it to my wife on the
[57:38] way to church I didn't drive I wasn't
[57:41] reading and driving
[57:43] my wife drove for me it was a really
[57:45] nice treat
[57:46] um
[57:47] I think it's just a wonderful thing you
[57:50] know in the message I've just been going
[57:51] through 1965 and in the message this day
[57:54] this scripture has been fulfilled
[57:56] brother Brown I'm right at the very end
[57:58] of that message he says something I
[58:00] think is just profound it's just exactly
[58:03] where I I live this is where I think
[58:05] every one of us does but he says this
[58:07] paragraph 256 I've read the scripture
[58:11] with a dozen or more evidences that were
[58:13] living in the last day the generation
[58:15] that will see Jesus Christ return to the
[58:19] Earth
[58:20] and I say to you tonight
[58:22] again
[58:24] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[58:27] your sight
[58:28] not in your ears in your sight
[58:31] he says you and Tucson you in California
[58:33] you and New York on these telephone
[58:35] hookups this day this scripture is
[58:38] fulfilled in your sight
[58:42] what is he saying to us friends what is
[58:45] he saying in there
[58:46] wow
[58:48] the next paragraph the end of it he says
[58:51] let us be glad and make Mary for the
[58:53] marriage of the Lamb is at hand
[58:56] and her bride his bride has made herself
[58:59] ready
[59:01] brothers and sisters be ye followers of
[59:04] me even as I also am a follower of
[59:07] Christ
[59:08] we know that brother Bradham preached
[59:10] what Paul preached
[59:12] and that is kind of where I'm going
[59:14] tonight I won't say it this way I heard
[59:17] someone say it earlier that uh you know
[59:19] brother Branham was actually
[59:23] he was actually Paul for our day
[59:26] and and there's people that would say
[59:29] that's a uh uh the way in which you
[59:32] worship
[59:33] is what I call heresy because that would
[59:36] be a heretic thing to say for most
[59:37] people they would be on the floor to
[59:40] hear people say that but it's true
[59:43] nobody has a Vindicated Ministry
[59:46] to match the pattern that God set out
[59:49] for us do they
[59:50] nobody
[59:52] except for one
[59:54] and we know there isn't going to be
[59:55] another one
[59:57] because the bride hath made herself
[59:59] ready the marriage of the Lamb is at
[1:00:02] hand is what he said let us rejoice and
[1:00:05] be very merry is what brother Branham
[1:00:07] said we know the word says be very glad
[1:00:09] we have the reason to Rejoice brothers
[1:00:11] and sisters to recognize our position in
[1:00:14] Christ in Christ's position in us
[1:00:16] remember we were saying on Sunday if we
[1:00:18] could just step back and take a look at
[1:00:20] the situation of our lives and and and
[1:00:23] and and situations all around like the
[1:00:26] children of Israel when they were stuck
[1:00:28] on one side of the pillar of fire and
[1:00:30] the cloud and and the Egyptians were
[1:00:32] stuck on the other side pharaoh and his
[1:00:34] army but this Pillar of Fire and Cloud
[1:00:36] was right in the middle protecting them
[1:00:40] what did it look like from that Pillar
[1:00:42] of Fire if we could look at our problems
[1:00:44] from the pillar of fire I think it would
[1:00:46] just be a totally different world for us
[1:00:48] we we wouldn't be soon shaken in the
[1:00:51] problems that come our way
[1:00:53] you know brother Branham in this message
[1:00:54] this day this scripture is fulfilled he
[1:00:57] goes through and just talks about the
[1:00:58] the example of a slave and and how when
[1:01:01] you're a slave back in the day of of of
[1:01:04] the Old Testament times there was a Year
[1:01:06] of Jubilee and and when that Year of
[1:01:08] Jubilee happened everyone who is a slave
[1:01:11] anyone who had any debts everything was
[1:01:13] forgiven at that Jubilee trumpet there
[1:01:16] was a time where people had the
[1:01:18] opportunity to make a decision to leave
[1:01:21] their slavery leave their position leave
[1:01:24] everything they had and go right back to
[1:01:25] the beginning to where they were because
[1:01:27] everything was forgiven all the debts
[1:01:29] were forgiven they were no longer a
[1:01:30] slave they didn't want to be a Slave
[1:01:32] but they had a decision to make
[1:01:34] and I know that most people probably
[1:01:36] took it but brother Bradham says some
[1:01:37] people didn't some people stayed a slave
[1:01:39] they remained a slave they decided to
[1:01:41] stay in that position and once that
[1:01:43] happened they were taken down to the
[1:01:44] temple they had a whole board in their
[1:01:46] ear to mark them to say that they will
[1:01:49] not be free that they will be bound to
[1:01:53] that slave master for the rest of their
[1:01:55] lives because they rejected that Jubilee
[1:01:58] trumpet and for some people it might
[1:01:59] have been a lucrative deal for others it
[1:02:02] might not have been a very good decision
[1:02:04] at all
[1:02:05] but you know to decide not to decide
[1:02:09] is making a decision
[1:02:11] by saying that I'm not going to make a
[1:02:13] decision today I'm going to wait we're
[1:02:16] actually deciding
[1:02:17] and you know what we're deciding is to
[1:02:20] not actually hear that voice we're
[1:02:23] actually deciding to put us in the
[1:02:25] position of going down to the temple and
[1:02:27] getting a whole board in our ear and
[1:02:29] brother Branham talks about it from the
[1:02:30] spiritual perspective what it means is
[1:02:32] when that Jubilee trumpet this message
[1:02:34] of the hour brought by the messenger of
[1:02:36] the age according to the pattern God set
[1:02:38] out when that voice comes forward if we
[1:02:40] choose to reject that Jubilee trumpet
[1:02:43] we will get a spiritual whole board in
[1:02:46] our ear and our spiritual ear will no
[1:02:49] longer hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:02:51] the church
[1:02:52] and then we just get stuck with that
[1:02:54] slave master that we have whatever it is
[1:02:56] that afflicts us
[1:02:58] that's where we find ourselves
[1:03:00] the spiritual application is pretty
[1:03:02] heavy brothers and sisters we don't ever
[1:03:04] want to be in that position but it's so
[1:03:06] beautiful when we recognize that we've
[1:03:08] heard that voice and when we've
[1:03:09] responded to that voice when we say Amen
[1:03:12] to that voice we can hear a lot of other
[1:03:14] trumpets and a lot of other uncertain
[1:03:16] sounds in the world but boy when we hear
[1:03:19] the voice of the Vindicated Prophet
[1:03:21] playing
[1:03:23] something happens it stirs something
[1:03:25] inside of us
[1:03:27] my
[1:03:29] but we get a decision time
[1:03:31] when we accept it our spiritual
[1:03:33] awareness sharpens
[1:03:35] we become aware of things that we
[1:03:37] weren't aware of in the past we see
[1:03:40] things differently than we did in the
[1:03:42] past when we actually receive that
[1:03:45] Jubilee trumpet and we recognize that
[1:03:48] we're free
[1:03:49] my goodness for me one of the things and
[1:03:52] it sounds so silly brothers and sisters
[1:03:53] but I'm just going to be honest I've got
[1:03:55] to be one of the simplest things for me
[1:03:57] was to say I'm Free as a believer I'm
[1:04:00] free I don't ever have to worry ever
[1:04:02] again in this life about drinking and
[1:04:05] driving
[1:04:06] ever
[1:04:09] I don't ever have to have that fear what
[1:04:11] a stupid thing to even think but it's
[1:04:14] real
[1:04:16] by accepting that Jubilee trumpet it did
[1:04:19] something for me it created an awareness
[1:04:22] it gave me a sharpened awareness of this
[1:04:26] spiritual life and how it affects us and
[1:04:29] you know by saying amen by going to
[1:04:31] church by reading the word by listening
[1:04:33] to the message of the hour all of it
[1:04:35] works to our benefit it helps us
[1:04:39] but if we reject the word if we reject
[1:04:41] the message of the hour then we have a
[1:04:43] situation where it dulls our spiritual
[1:04:45] hearing and it doesn't stir us and it
[1:04:47] will come to the place where it will not
[1:04:49] stir us any more
[1:04:51] last week we talked about Balaam and
[1:04:53] balak and and looking at the negative
[1:04:55] and that was the the motive of of balak
[1:04:58] he wanted to get Balaam the prophet a
[1:05:01] true God Prophet to go and bless God's
[1:05:03] or curse God's people who are already
[1:05:05] blessed and and we know that his tactic
[1:05:08] was to take him and multiple times Go
[1:05:11] and show him the hinder Parts Go and
[1:05:12] show them the negative things The Faults
[1:05:15] and failures of those people who were
[1:05:17] blessed people
[1:05:20] but we know that you just cannot curse
[1:05:23] what God's blessed isn't that a
[1:05:24] beautiful thing
[1:05:26] it doesn't matter what people do it
[1:05:28] doesn't matter what people say you can't
[1:05:30] curse what God has blessed
[1:05:33] and I just I just wanted to take us back
[1:05:36] there and remind us that you know First
[1:05:38] Corinthians 15 says be not deceived evil
[1:05:41] Communications corrupt good manners
[1:05:44] if we're listening to that evil stuff
[1:05:47] brothers and sisters if we're listening
[1:05:48] to a balach trying to get us to look at
[1:05:52] the hinder parts of people because don't
[1:05:54] don't don't don't mistake it when we
[1:05:56] hear that going on when that starts to
[1:05:58] happen what that is is a balak spirit
[1:06:01] The Same Spirit that was in that King is
[1:06:04] the Same Spirit that's speaking to us
[1:06:06] through somebody else to try and get us
[1:06:08] to look at the negative parts of another
[1:06:10] person maybe it's a husband maybe it's a
[1:06:12] wife maybe it's a brother maybe it's a
[1:06:14] sister maybe it's a pastor or evangelist
[1:06:17] whoever it is don't listen to it
[1:06:20] just be followers of me even as I also
[1:06:23] have a Christ
[1:06:25] and you know this is so beautiful
[1:06:26] because in my Bible the footnote is
[1:06:28] Ephesians 5 1.
[1:06:30] it goes directly into families
[1:06:34] don't allow ourselves to get caught up
[1:06:35] in that
[1:06:37] life is too short
[1:06:39] God is too good we know that God has a
[1:06:42] very specific pattern set out every
[1:06:44] single age he has given his pattern
[1:06:48] I'm going to read a quote here it's out
[1:06:50] of the first seal I believe brother
[1:06:52] Branham says he come in the first stage
[1:06:53] the Ephesian age revealed sent the
[1:06:55] messenger notice what happens as we go
[1:06:58] along here is the plan of it the first
[1:07:00] thing happens there is an announcement
[1:07:02] in the heavens first what happens a seal
[1:07:05] is opened what's that a mystery is
[1:07:07] unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds
[1:07:10] then a trumpet sounds it declares a war
[1:07:12] a plague Falls and a church age open see
[1:07:17] what is the war part the angel of the
[1:07:21] church catches the mystery of God not
[1:07:23] fully yet revealed but when he does he
[1:07:25] catches this mystery of God and then he
[1:07:27] goes forth to the people after the
[1:07:30] mystery has been given to him
[1:07:32] just like Amos 3 7.
[1:07:34] that's me speaking
[1:07:36] The Amos 3 7 part
[1:07:38] Goes Forth to the people what does he do
[1:07:42] out there he begins to Proclaim that
[1:07:45] message and what does it start a war a
[1:07:48] spiritual war and then God takes his
[1:07:50] messenger with the elect of that age and
[1:07:52] lays them away asleep and then he drops
[1:07:55] a plague upon them who rejected it a
[1:07:57] temporary judgment outside of the first
[1:07:59] seal tonight brothers and sisters I'm
[1:08:02] reading that because I want to talk
[1:08:03] about Paul setting an example excuse me
[1:08:07] he was the first messenger the Ephesian
[1:08:10] Church age he was the one that came and
[1:08:13] set the pattern for the church
[1:08:16] he's the one be followers of me even as
[1:08:19] I also am of Christ we want to be hidden
[1:08:23] away in Christ
[1:08:25] be followers of me even as I also am of
[1:08:27] Christ now I Praise You Brethren that
[1:08:29] you remember me in all things and keep
[1:08:31] the ordinances as I delivered them to
[1:08:35] you don't try and change them don't try
[1:08:37] and manipulate them don't try and make
[1:08:40] them fit our lifestyles or our
[1:08:41] Traditions just follow the ordinances
[1:08:44] that he's given us
[1:08:46] and remember we were talking about this
[1:08:48] how those millions of people on the
[1:08:52] other side of the curtain of time when
[1:08:54] brother Bradham went over there and he
[1:08:56] asked the question to that voice will
[1:08:58] Paul have to be judged the voice said
[1:09:01] yes he will and with his people he will
[1:09:03] come forward and be judged and he said
[1:09:06] amen that's good because I actually
[1:09:08] preached what Paul preached and and
[1:09:10] those millions of people on the other
[1:09:12] side the curtain of time beyond the
[1:09:14] curtain of time they all said we are
[1:09:17] counting on that and you know brothers
[1:09:20] and sisters supernaturally speaking
[1:09:22] every one of us was over there at that
[1:09:24] time that wasn't just a bunch of people
[1:09:26] that have just passed on and the other
[1:09:27] people are stuck in in another dimension
[1:09:30] don't think of it that way think of it
[1:09:31] in terms of this being the supernatural
[1:09:34] God and all of those people were you and
[1:09:36] I all of the Believers of all of the
[1:09:39] ages but I would have you know that the
[1:09:42] head of every man is Christ and the head
[1:09:43] of the woman is the man the head of
[1:09:45] Christ is God as husbands in the home if
[1:09:48] we want to see our families follow
[1:09:50] Christ then we don't tell them what to
[1:09:52] do we show them what to do that's the
[1:09:54] way it works brothers and sisters if we
[1:09:56] want to see spiritual success in our
[1:09:58] lives we have got to be the leaders the
[1:10:00] brothers who plan to get married if you
[1:10:03] want to find the right wife the right
[1:10:04] wife is going to have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:06] don't think that she's going to get the
[1:10:07] Holy Ghost she better have the Holy
[1:10:09] Ghost and that wife is going to be
[1:10:11] looking for a strong leader with the
[1:10:13] Holy Ghost
[1:10:15] she's going to be looking for someone
[1:10:17] that lives by I am a follower of Paul
[1:10:20] even as Paul was also a follower of
[1:10:23] Christ
[1:10:24] that's the way it's got to work
[1:10:26] otherwise we could find ourselves in a
[1:10:28] real difficult situation where maybe
[1:10:30] that person that we decided to get
[1:10:33] married to just didn't have the Holy
[1:10:34] Ghost they were just in church and they
[1:10:36] were just a church member and for
[1:10:38] whatever reason they just hadn't gone
[1:10:39] all the way and boy when that happens
[1:10:41] there's no guarantees that person's
[1:10:43] going to go on to get the true baptism
[1:10:45] of the Holy Ghost and that is going to
[1:10:47] be a thorn in the soul not just the
[1:10:50] flesh that's going to be a problem but
[1:10:53] thanks be to God we have a pattern we
[1:10:55] have a an instruction about this what we
[1:10:57] can do about it
[1:10:59] you know the the the world every single
[1:11:02] age every single messenger brought their
[1:11:05] message for that age and the world has
[1:11:07] been given a very specific pattern to
[1:11:09] follow and every single age has had the
[1:11:12] opportunity to be faced with the word
[1:11:14] now maybe not every single individual I
[1:11:17] wouldn't go so far as to say that but
[1:11:18] who knows
[1:11:20] that's up to God there could be people
[1:11:21] that live on a deserted island in the
[1:11:24] middle of the ocean somewhere that maybe
[1:11:26] didn't hear this message of Paul
[1:11:28] I don't know we're not going to go there
[1:11:30] and worry about that I would just simply
[1:11:32] say that according to election everyone
[1:11:34] who is required to was given the
[1:11:37] opportunity to be faced with the word
[1:11:39] for their day and it's no different in
[1:11:42] our day we have been given that
[1:11:44] opportunity to be faced with the word
[1:11:46] and that's why we're here tonight
[1:11:47] because something inside us constrained
[1:11:50] us to say Amen to that word when we
[1:11:52] heard it
[1:11:54] well you know in the Bible there's an
[1:11:55] example the Rich Young Ruler Mark 10
[1:11:58] verse 17 and when he was gone forth into
[1:12:00] the way there came one running and
[1:12:02] kneeled to him and asked him good Master
[1:12:05] what shall I do that I may inherit
[1:12:08] eternal life and Jesus saith unto him
[1:12:10] why call us thou me good there is none
[1:12:12] good but one that is God thou knowest
[1:12:14] the Commandments do not commit adultery
[1:12:17] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[1:12:19] fall false witness defraud not honor thy
[1:12:22] father and thy mother and he answered
[1:12:24] and said unto him master all these have
[1:12:26] I observed from my youth
[1:12:29] and we know that Jesus beholding him
[1:12:31] loved him
[1:12:33] and said unto him one thing thou lackest
[1:12:35] go thy way sell whatever thou Hast and
[1:12:38] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:12:40] treasure in heaven come take up the
[1:12:42] cross and follow me
[1:12:44] decision time
[1:12:47] he was faced with the word for his day
[1:12:51] and he had that opportunity to make the
[1:12:53] decision and it's amazing to think that
[1:12:57] he had the opportunity to accept that
[1:12:59] word for his day but he chose to reject
[1:13:02] it and I believe he chose sorrowfully to
[1:13:05] reject it he didn't reject it and say oh
[1:13:07] right oh you're crazy you're a Madman he
[1:13:10] he said there's something about this guy
[1:13:11] and he really knows the scriptures he's
[1:13:13] like the teachers but they say he's
[1:13:14] ignorant and unlearned so how could we
[1:13:16] follow him because he doesn't come
[1:13:18] according to the pattern that we're
[1:13:19] taught
[1:13:20] who is this guy
[1:13:22] it's astounding
[1:13:24] but he was given the opportunity and he
[1:13:27] stalled on it
[1:13:29] and we know that that did something for
[1:13:31] him that wasn't good
[1:13:33] but he was given that opportunity to
[1:13:35] make that decision and every one of us
[1:13:37] has the opportunity to make the decision
[1:13:38] and what's the decision for our day to
[1:13:40] accept the word for our day what's the
[1:13:42] word for our day the word for our day is
[1:13:43] Christ brothers and sisters we've read
[1:13:44] it we started with that quote brother
[1:13:46] Branham said this day this scripture has
[1:13:49] been fulfilled in your sight
[1:13:51] the coming of the Lord
[1:13:54] my goodness but the whole world is
[1:13:56] looking for something different they
[1:13:57] think it's going to be a great
[1:13:59] magnificent uh rolling back of the sky
[1:14:01] and and and God's going to descend and
[1:14:04] and everything is going to be like the
[1:14:05] children of Israel thought maybe he
[1:14:07] would come you know it's not going to be
[1:14:09] that way brothers and sisters it's the
[1:14:10] word coming of the Lord and he's already
[1:14:13] come that word coming of the Lord
[1:14:14] happened in 1963.
[1:14:17] and here we are now
[1:14:20] we know in Luke 16 is the the follow-up
[1:14:23] to the story that we just read and and
[1:14:26] verse 19 says there was a certain rich
[1:14:28] man which was clothed in purple fine
[1:14:30] linen and fared sumptuously every day
[1:14:33] didn't have any problems in his life
[1:14:35] right
[1:14:36] verse 20 and there was a beggar there
[1:14:39] was a certain beggar named Lazarus which
[1:14:40] was laid at his gate full of sores and
[1:14:43] Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which
[1:14:45] fell from the rich man's table moreover
[1:14:47] the dogs came and licked his sores
[1:14:50] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:14:52] and was carried by the angels and to
[1:14:54] Abraham's bosom and the rich man also
[1:14:56] died and was buried
[1:14:58] and in hell he lifted up his eyes being
[1:15:01] in torments and see if Abraham afar off
[1:15:04] and Lazarus and his bosom and he cried
[1:15:06] and said Father Abraham have mercy on me
[1:15:08] and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip
[1:15:11] of his finger in water and cool my
[1:15:13] tongue for I am tormented in this Flame
[1:15:16] but Abraham said Son remember that thou
[1:15:18] in thy lifetime receive this thy good
[1:15:21] things
[1:15:22] and likewise Lazarus Lazarus evil things
[1:15:26] but now he is comforted and thou art
[1:15:29] tormented
[1:15:31] and beside all this between us and you
[1:15:34] there is a great Gulf fixed that they
[1:15:37] which would pass from hence to you
[1:15:39] cannot neither can they pass to us
[1:15:42] that they would come from thence
[1:15:45] isn't it interesting to look at this
[1:15:47] story here and to think that here we
[1:15:50] have this this rich young man he was
[1:15:53] faced with the word for his day and he
[1:15:56] chose to stall in making a decision
[1:15:58] about it he chose to hold back and be
[1:16:00] reserved and maybe not really follow
[1:16:02] through with what the instructions were
[1:16:05] for his day and and by the stalling by
[1:16:08] the the resistance maybe but call it
[1:16:11] this way by the distraction that he had
[1:16:13] of what Jesus named was his problem he
[1:16:16] told him what his problem was his
[1:16:18] distraction was all of his wealth all of
[1:16:20] the goods that he had in his house maybe
[1:16:22] his family's business maybe he had a
[1:16:25] great degree and and created a business
[1:16:27] maybe he was a doctor maybe he was a
[1:16:29] lawyer whatever he was he he was a Rich
[1:16:31] Young Ruler he was he was a mover and a
[1:16:34] Shaker he had it going on but Jesus told
[1:16:36] him what his problem was and he wasn't
[1:16:38] willing to accept God's direction for
[1:16:41] his day and because of that distraction
[1:16:43] that he had because of that resistance
[1:16:45] to act on that word for his day
[1:16:49] here he finds himself in hell
[1:16:51] he finds himself in in Hades in this
[1:16:55] place where he's in torment
[1:16:59] and we know that he has this
[1:17:01] conversation with Abraham
[1:17:03] and Abraham says to him son remember
[1:17:05] that thou in thy lifetime receive this
[1:17:07] thy good things you had it pretty good
[1:17:10] but you had that one time that one day
[1:17:13] that one moment where you chose to
[1:17:15] actually
[1:17:16] resist the holy ghost in your day you
[1:17:18] chose to to resist the action of going
[1:17:22] forwards and following the word for your
[1:17:24] day and that caused you to lift up your
[1:17:27] eyes and hell now you're here and what
[1:17:29] do you want to have happen you had your
[1:17:31] chance brothers and sisters don't miss
[1:17:34] our chance
[1:17:35] make sure that when we hear that voice
[1:17:37] that word for our day that we act on it
[1:17:40] there can't be any distraction if
[1:17:43] there's a distraction we could find
[1:17:44] ourselves there
[1:17:46] we know the next verse 27 he says then
[1:17:49] he said I pray thee therefore father
[1:17:51] that thou would Ascend him to my
[1:17:53] father's house
[1:17:55] for I have five Brethren that he may
[1:17:56] testify unto them lest they also come
[1:17:58] into this place of dormant he had a
[1:18:01] genuine now he was serious right now he
[1:18:04] wants to act on this now he wants to do
[1:18:06] something about it Abraham saith unto
[1:18:08] him they have Moses and the prophets let
[1:18:11] them hear them
[1:18:13] there's a not going to be a supernatural
[1:18:16] sign it's not going to be a great sign
[1:18:17] and wonder a ghost coming back from the
[1:18:20] dead to say you better watch out because
[1:18:21] you don't want to go to that place no
[1:18:23] God's pattern is the prophets God's
[1:18:26] pattern is his word God's pattern is to
[1:18:28] speak to man through a man according to
[1:18:31] his word Amos 3 7 we said right that's
[1:18:34] God's way of doing it not not some
[1:18:37] Supernatural thing
[1:18:40] and he said unto him if they hear not
[1:18:42] Moses or the prophets
[1:18:44] if if if their spiritual ears are poked
[1:18:47] and they just can't hear what the spirit
[1:18:48] saith unto the church
[1:18:51] if they won't hear Moses and the
[1:18:53] prophets neither will they be persuaded
[1:18:55] the one rose from the dead can you
[1:18:57] imagine that
[1:18:59] they won't even be persuaded because
[1:19:01] they see a dead man come to life again a
[1:19:03] ghost come back and say watch out beware
[1:19:05] you're going to come to the pit it's
[1:19:07] gonna be hot you're not going to like it
[1:19:09] they won't even be persuaded by that
[1:19:11] it's it's it's it's it's it's the human
[1:19:14] nature and what it is is where that ear
[1:19:16] gets pierced brothers and sisters
[1:19:18] there's no going back from that
[1:19:20] we can cross the line brother Branham
[1:19:22] says that we can come to a place where
[1:19:24] we cross a line where we cannot come
[1:19:26] back from it and and that's a terrible
[1:19:29] place to be I trust that none of us are
[1:19:31] anywhere near that position tonight
[1:19:35] how did Paul follow Christ be ye
[1:19:38] followers of me as I also am a follower
[1:19:41] of Christ
[1:19:42] and we know that he was a Pharisee of
[1:19:44] Pharisees wasn't he he was the Hebrew of
[1:19:47] Hebrews he was the stock of Israel
[1:19:50] wasn't he
[1:19:51] he he started out in his his his days
[1:19:55] under gamalia and we know that he knew
[1:19:59] exactly what he was talking about when
[1:20:01] it came to the word there wasn't nobody
[1:20:02] that was going to school him about the
[1:20:04] word he was going to school anyone about
[1:20:06] the word but what it did was it caused
[1:20:09] him to come to the place where these
[1:20:11] people now coming up under this
[1:20:12] Insurrection under this this lunatic
[1:20:15] they called Jesus what he did was he
[1:20:18] said no no it's outside of the pattern
[1:20:20] now we're going to actually persecute
[1:20:21] this we're going to crush this because
[1:20:23] he was such a staunch believer of it so
[1:20:25] what did he do he went and made his Mark
[1:20:27] by persecuting the church that's what he
[1:20:30] did these people who were believers who
[1:20:32] were followers of the word for their day
[1:20:33] when they recognized there was error in
[1:20:36] the law and and there was love in and
[1:20:40] and life in Jesus Christ he wanted to
[1:20:42] crush those people
[1:20:44] but there was a time where he met that
[1:20:46] Pillar of Fire for himself and and he
[1:20:49] actually heard that voice he had that
[1:20:51] conversation himself he met we could say
[1:20:54] this way the word for his day
[1:20:56] he thought he had met the word for his
[1:20:58] day but he hadn't met that word for his
[1:21:01] day
[1:21:01] though all that he learned we know that
[1:21:05] he counted it as dung after this
[1:21:07] experience
[1:21:09] but at on the way to persecute the
[1:21:11] church he finds himself in a situation
[1:21:13] where he meets the word for his day and
[1:21:16] what happened to him we know that his
[1:21:18] sight was gone the way he saw things was
[1:21:21] changed forever he did not see things
[1:21:23] anymore the same way that light struck
[1:21:26] him down and we know that from that
[1:21:28] moment on he recognized I'm no longer a
[1:21:30] leader
[1:21:31] but I need to be led
[1:21:33] can you imagine that he recognized that
[1:21:36] God knows exactly how to get our
[1:21:38] attention so that we will be led if we
[1:21:41] are true Sons and Daughters of God we
[1:21:44] have the ability to accept it in in good
[1:21:47] time but if we are a son and daughter of
[1:21:49] God then he will make sure that we're
[1:21:51] looked after and it might even be to the
[1:21:54] point where he takes us off the scene
[1:21:55] brother Bradham talks about that
[1:21:57] Minister I don't know if he's a pastor
[1:21:59] but he is a minister and and he just got
[1:22:01] fed up with the carnality the situation
[1:22:03] whatever it was in his life and he went
[1:22:05] and got a box of beer and just decided
[1:22:08] to pull a trigger and get after it and
[1:22:10] and sure God let him he went and did it
[1:22:12] but then next week brother Branham said
[1:22:14] he found him in a hospital bed dying and
[1:22:17] and God took him home God won't allow
[1:22:19] anyone of his elect to be lost
[1:22:22] but here we have Paul the messenger the
[1:22:25] the pattern maker the one that all of
[1:22:28] the ages follow after the one that we're
[1:22:30] instructed to follow after he met the
[1:22:33] pillar of fire for himself on the road
[1:22:35] to lay waste to the church he was going
[1:22:37] after him this was going to be a great
[1:22:39] Onslaught for him a great Victory a
[1:22:41] feather in his cap if you will but we
[1:22:43] know that that word blinded him so that
[1:22:47] he had to be led himself he could no
[1:22:49] longer be that leader he could no longer
[1:22:51] do what he did what it was was a change
[1:22:54] in dispensations wasn't it brother
[1:22:56] Branham talks about it in the message I
[1:22:58] believe it's the Rapture he says that
[1:23:00] we're building a house and dispensations
[1:23:03] change they overlap and when they change
[1:23:06] you've got to know when they change
[1:23:08] you've got to be perceptive you got to
[1:23:10] be able to hear what the spirit saith
[1:23:12] unto the church
[1:23:14] but he was able to follow that
[1:23:15] leadership of the Lord into the house
[1:23:17] and he sat there and he didn't eat or
[1:23:19] drink for a couple days didn't he he sat
[1:23:22] there and he just wondered what happened
[1:23:23] to him he knows that he he knows the
[1:23:26] voice that voice he'd heard that voice
[1:23:27] his whole life but now he met that voice
[1:23:30] in person and now he can't see things
[1:23:33] the way that he used to see things but
[1:23:35] God showed him that he needed leadership
[1:23:37] and he showed him that he too needed to
[1:23:39] be prayed for that he needed leadership
[1:23:42] and after he was prayed for what
[1:23:44] happened to him
[1:23:46] he went out he didn't go out and say
[1:23:48] look at how God has has done for me look
[1:23:51] at how good God is I am now this
[1:23:54] messenger of the age he didn't go out
[1:23:55] and start beating his chest he didn't
[1:23:57] get puffed up with Revelation he got a
[1:23:59] thorn in his flesh that's what he got
[1:24:01] and and he said he sought God three
[1:24:04] times for that thorn in his flesh and
[1:24:05] God said hey you know what because of
[1:24:07] the abundance of Revelation that I'm
[1:24:09] giving you I'm giving you this thorn in
[1:24:10] your flesh so you don't get puffed up
[1:24:12] above all of this Revelation that you've
[1:24:15] been given
[1:24:16] but we have him in a situation where he
[1:24:19] goes out and he says my goodness I still
[1:24:22] remember all of the training that I had
[1:24:24] about the word and the Book of Moses and
[1:24:26] everything and how does all of this come
[1:24:29] together what is this
[1:24:31] and what does the word say he went out
[1:24:33] into Arabia
[1:24:34] he went for a few years to get all of
[1:24:38] that old Paul all Saul baked out of him
[1:24:41] and what did he do he didn't go and say
[1:24:44] I had this great lightning bulk
[1:24:45] experience Everybody follow me be
[1:24:47] followers of me as I am of Christ he
[1:24:49] went out and searched the word for
[1:24:51] himself he went and found the reality of
[1:24:54] Christ in the word for himself it became
[1:24:57] his own possession at that point and
[1:24:59] that's when he came and said hey be ye
[1:25:02] followers of me as I also am of Christ
[1:25:05] and we know that was a terrible thing
[1:25:07] for the church that was such a trial my
[1:25:09] goodness could you imagine if somebody
[1:25:11] wanted to come into our assembly and
[1:25:13] take an AK-47 and just start shooting
[1:25:16] people up and then suddenly come back
[1:25:18] and say you know what God has changed me
[1:25:20] I got struck down on the road to
[1:25:22] Damascus now I love you all
[1:25:25] forgive me for sinning against you how
[1:25:27] would that work oh my
[1:25:30] there's people that knew Stephen
[1:25:32] people were close to Stephen and they
[1:25:35] had to forgive him
[1:25:38] my goodness
[1:25:41] how does Paul follow Christ Galatians 2
[1:25:43] 20 I am crucified with Christ
[1:25:46] nevertheless I live
[1:25:49] yet not I
[1:25:51] but Christ liveth in me
[1:25:54] and the life which I now live in the
[1:25:57] flesh
[1:25:59] not in the spirit
[1:26:01] otherwise he would have said the spirit
[1:26:03] I think it's important to make sure that
[1:26:06] we get that
[1:26:07] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[1:26:12] Son of God Who Loved Me
[1:26:15] and gave himself for me
[1:26:19] brothers and sisters
[1:26:21] we've got to crucify this flesh
[1:26:25] we got to crucify this flesh that's the
[1:26:27] only way we're going to see the statue
[1:26:29] of the perfect man live out through us
[1:26:30] remember brother Branham said it very
[1:26:32] clearly that we are not even converted
[1:26:34] until we get the Holy Ghost we have not
[1:26:36] received the new birth in our lives
[1:26:38] until we receive the Holy Ghost so why
[1:26:41] brother Barry do you keep harping about
[1:26:43] the Holy Ghost because we want to see
[1:26:45] people get to Christ that's why we're
[1:26:47] here and to encourage those who are
[1:26:52] he's still calling people
[1:26:54] we need to still be evangelizing we need
[1:26:57] to still be encouraging people to get
[1:26:58] into Christ
[1:27:00] be followers of me even as I also am of
[1:27:03] Christ
[1:27:05] you know if anyone could have claimed
[1:27:07] perfection
[1:27:09] Philippians chapter 3 Paul speaking here
[1:27:13] finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord
[1:27:16] to write the same things to you to me
[1:27:19] indeed is not Grievous but for you it is
[1:27:21] safe
[1:27:22] beware of dogs beware of evil workers
[1:27:25] Beware of the concision
[1:27:29] for we are the circumcision which
[1:27:32] worship God in the spirit and rejoice in
[1:27:34] Christ Jesus and have no confidence in
[1:27:36] the flesh
[1:27:38] can't trust your feelings
[1:27:40] we can't trust our emotions
[1:27:43] kind of any confidence in the flesh in
[1:27:45] the way we see things here it's got to
[1:27:47] be a spiritual Revelation to us that's
[1:27:49] why we have discernment brothers and
[1:27:51] sisters in order to have discernment
[1:27:53] we've got to be in tune with the spirit
[1:27:54] we got to crucify this flesh we got to
[1:27:56] Die daily
[1:27:57] and if we do that then we can actually
[1:28:00] see God live out through us
[1:28:03] though I might have confidence in the
[1:28:05] flesh
[1:28:06] if any other man thinketh that he hath
[1:28:08] whereof he might Trust In the Flesh
[1:28:12] I more
[1:28:14] talking about the flesh talking about
[1:28:15] reasoning and Consciousness and memory
[1:28:17] and being able to learn
[1:28:21] privilege verse 5 Philippians 3 here
[1:28:25] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[1:28:26] of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew
[1:28:29] of Hebrews as touching Allah the
[1:28:31] Pharisee
[1:28:32] concerning Zeal persecuting the church
[1:28:35] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:28:37] the law blameless
[1:28:39] doing the service of God
[1:28:42] but what things were gained to me those
[1:28:45] counted law those I counted lost for
[1:28:47] Christ
[1:28:49] and I count all things but the loss for
[1:28:52] the Excellency of the knowledge of
[1:28:54] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:28:56] suffered the loss of all things
[1:28:59] and do count them but done that I may
[1:29:02] win Christ
[1:29:04] could we suffer the loss of all things
[1:29:06] in our lives today
[1:29:09] to win
[1:29:11] to be able to actually get that
[1:29:14] just like he said
[1:29:17] and be found in him not having my own
[1:29:19] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:29:22] that which is through the Faith of
[1:29:24] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:29:27] by faith
[1:29:29] remember it's by faith that we're saved
[1:29:32] through Grace not of Works lest any man
[1:29:35] should boast
[1:29:37] we know there's a lot of people who are
[1:29:38] really good in this world they do a lot
[1:29:40] of good things and they live a really
[1:29:42] good life
[1:29:43] and I I think I would be lost if it was
[1:29:46] a Works based gospel it's Grace that we
[1:29:49] live under
[1:29:50] but understanding that something causes
[1:29:53] us to respond to the word in our lives
[1:29:55] and we want to be followers of of Paul
[1:29:58] even as he was a follower of Christ and
[1:30:01] remember every time we say that we could
[1:30:03] say we want to be a follower of brother
[1:30:05] Branham even as he was a follower of
[1:30:07] Christ and we know that's a heretical
[1:30:11] heretic perspective but that's the way
[1:30:14] we worship isn't it
[1:30:16] the way in which you call heresy
[1:30:19] that's the way we worship
[1:30:21] he goes on to say that I may know him
[1:30:23] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:30:25] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[1:30:27] made conformable unto his death if by
[1:30:30] any means I might attain unto the
[1:30:32] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[1:30:35] had already attained either were already
[1:30:37] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[1:30:42] apprehend that for which also I am
[1:30:46] apprehended of Christ
[1:30:48] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:30:50] apprehended and I think that's the key
[1:30:52] for us to follow Christ as he followed
[1:30:55] Christ to follow him as he followed
[1:30:57] Christ is to recognize that we have not
[1:30:59] apprehended we won't apprehend until we
[1:31:01] have a new body
[1:31:03] but there's something inside of us that
[1:31:05] we have apprehended we've recognized was
[1:31:07] already there
[1:31:09] brother and I count not myself to have
[1:31:11] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:31:13] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:31:15] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:31:18] which are before
[1:31:20] excuse me
[1:31:22] not looking at the hinder Parts not
[1:31:25] looking at the things in the past that
[1:31:27] have hurt us and and brought us down but
[1:31:30] recognizing verse 14 follow Paul as he
[1:31:34] followed Christ I pressed toward the
[1:31:36] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:31:38] of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore
[1:31:41] as many be perfect be thus minded
[1:31:45] and if anything ye be otherwise minded
[1:31:47] God shall reveal this unto you
[1:31:51] it's just a wonderful thing here to say
[1:31:53] he is saying let us therefore as many as
[1:31:56] be perfect be thus minded we know that
[1:31:59] Jesus said be therefore perfect even as
[1:32:01] my Father in Heaven is perfect in this
[1:32:03] flesh people confuse that and say but I
[1:32:05] Fall In My Flesh I Stumble in my flesh I
[1:32:08] have thoughts in my flesh I things
[1:32:10] happen in my flesh how could I ever be
[1:32:12] perfect in My Flesh will never be
[1:32:14] perfect in our flesh that's why this
[1:32:15] flesh can never ever see Glory this
[1:32:18] flesh will never in inherit
[1:32:21] in corruption this flesh is the
[1:32:24] incorruption and remember we talked
[1:32:26] about Paul getting that thorn in his
[1:32:28] flesh we all have thorns in our flesh
[1:32:30] that we say you know and and I know I
[1:32:32] had in my life many times things where I
[1:32:34] I thought Lord why can't you just take
[1:32:36] this away from me and and I found that
[1:32:38] verse and and thought that's so
[1:32:40] comforting to recognize that you know he
[1:32:42] gave Paul the messenger of the eggs the
[1:32:44] first one the pattern Setter he gave him
[1:32:47] the sword in his flesh
[1:32:49] and we've heard varying discussion I'm
[1:32:51] sure about what that actually was but I
[1:32:54] heard something recently that just I
[1:32:55] thought was so good it just covers it
[1:32:57] all what it was was flesh
[1:32:59] the hybrid condition
[1:33:00] the thorn in our flesh is our flesh as
[1:33:03] long as we're in this flesh we've got a
[1:33:05] thorn and we're going to have it and
[1:33:06] that doesn't change the fact that we
[1:33:08] already have a body waiting because when
[1:33:10] this Tabernacle be becomes dissolved we
[1:33:14] already have one waiting for us in glory
[1:33:16] even though we struggle in this body
[1:33:19] there's something in that space that
[1:33:21] teeny spot in our heart that doesn't
[1:33:22] struggle we recognize and what it is
[1:33:24] being perfect brothers and sisters is
[1:33:26] saying Amen to the word for our day
[1:33:28] taking it according to the messenger for
[1:33:31] our age let us therefore as many be
[1:33:34] perfect be thus minded let's not think
[1:33:36] about all of the negative garbage in
[1:33:38] this world politics ain't going to get
[1:33:40] us anywhere worrying about the economic
[1:33:43] problems in this world is only going to
[1:33:45] Doom us it's going to bring us down but
[1:33:47] when we start to set our mind on
[1:33:49] Heavenly things then things will change
[1:33:51] in our lives we have an opportunity to
[1:33:53] set an atmosphere wherever we go
[1:33:55] brother Branham and God's provide away
[1:33:57] 1953 he says we're bound to sin
[1:34:02] now you will sin
[1:34:05] you're bound to sin because you just
[1:34:07] can't help it
[1:34:09] but not willful sin
[1:34:11] not willful sin
[1:34:13] not going out and getting a box of beer
[1:34:15] and saying I'm just going to go and get
[1:34:16] a box of beer and I could do that
[1:34:18] because I'm a big boy and nobody will
[1:34:19] ever know I could drive to a different
[1:34:21] town they won't know me there I could
[1:34:23] wear a mask and I could wear a hoodie
[1:34:25] and sunglasses and a hat really low and
[1:34:27] they will not be able to tell who it is
[1:34:29] I could just go and do that no no no no
[1:34:32] not that kind of sin
[1:34:34] the things that trip us up in our lives
[1:34:36] the the things that really we just
[1:34:38] struggle with habits remember we talked
[1:34:40] about habits before brother Branham said
[1:34:42] their Spirits they're just spirits that
[1:34:44] are coming around trying to oppress us
[1:34:46] they don't possess us because the Holy
[1:34:48] Ghost possesses us we're his and let's
[1:34:52] just get that right tonight we are his
[1:34:54] and and the devil can't touch us he
[1:34:57] can't take us the only thing he can do
[1:34:58] is come around and try and poke us and
[1:35:00] when he pokes us we feel like we fall
[1:35:02] those thoughts that come into our mind
[1:35:04] those aren't our thoughts and they're
[1:35:06] not God's thoughts they're the devil's
[1:35:08] thoughts but he wants us to think there
[1:35:11] are thoughts they're not our thoughts
[1:35:14] brother Bradham says now you will sin
[1:35:16] you're bound to sin because you just
[1:35:17] can't help it but not willful sin he
[1:35:19] that sins willfully after he receives
[1:35:21] the knowledge of the truth see they
[1:35:23] remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but
[1:35:26] every day you're bound to sin and we
[1:35:28] know that what brother Branham is
[1:35:29] talking about is out of Hebrews there
[1:35:30] Hebrews chapter 6 I believe it is and
[1:35:33] what that's talking about is unbelief
[1:35:34] and saying that the message of the hour
[1:35:37] just isn't uh completely right there's
[1:35:39] something just a little bit funny with
[1:35:40] it I just can't accept all of it that's
[1:35:42] what he's talking about that's willful
[1:35:44] sin saying I just can't accept it the
[1:35:46] way that God's given it and he says
[1:35:48] you're bound to be backsliding
[1:35:50] consistently constantly so it takes
[1:35:54] constant prayer to God
[1:35:58] Paul said I Die daily
[1:36:01] and if Paul had to Die daily how much
[1:36:04] more am I going am I going to have to
[1:36:07] stay there Dead all the time if Paul had
[1:36:11] to Die daily to stay right with God
[1:36:14] this just is if it's for nobody else
[1:36:17] it's for me I'm sorry it's a selfish
[1:36:19] thing tonight it's just incredible for
[1:36:21] me to think you know this is so powerful
[1:36:23] I believe this is a key to unlock the
[1:36:26] power of the Christian church in the age
[1:36:28] in which we live in we have all of the
[1:36:30] truth for our day but how does it apply
[1:36:32] in our lives brothers and sisters the
[1:36:34] battles fought on our knees brothers and
[1:36:36] sisters the leadership is fought on our
[1:36:38] knees when we have a problem in our life
[1:36:40] in our home the victory is going to be
[1:36:43] one on our knees our position is really
[1:36:45] on our knees before Christ
[1:36:48] brother Adam goes on to say and so we'll
[1:36:50] all have to do that just die out to
[1:36:53] ourselves and that's getting God's way
[1:36:57] now there's only two ways of anything
[1:36:58] that's the right way and the wrong way
[1:37:02] and them ways are your ways and God's
[1:37:04] way
[1:37:05] and you can't be in your way and God's
[1:37:08] way at the same time you've got to
[1:37:11] forget your own way
[1:37:13] to get in God's way
[1:37:15] and you got to get out of your own way
[1:37:18] to get in God's way for as long as
[1:37:20] you're in your own way you're out of his
[1:37:23] way
[1:37:25] I just think it's incredible to think
[1:37:27] about this as long as we're in our own
[1:37:30] way we're out of his way
[1:37:33] so forsake your way forsake your
[1:37:35] thoughts
[1:37:36] forsake everything and just rely one
[1:37:40] thing on thus saith the Lord that's all
[1:37:44] then you'll know you're right
[1:37:46] and you know brothers and sisters I just
[1:37:48] gonna throw this in here this is Brother
[1:37:50] Barry speaking here but we know that
[1:37:51] brother Bradham said it in the church
[1:37:52] age book and that's why the devil wants
[1:37:54] to Discount this church age book I
[1:37:56] believe it with all my heart because of
[1:37:57] that one Clause there's lots in there
[1:37:59] but just one this one here bugs him I
[1:38:01] believe it a tremendous way it rattles
[1:38:04] hell because the prophet for our day
[1:38:07] said rather God through the prophet for
[1:38:10] our day said to the church she has thus
[1:38:13] saith in mind and thus saith the Lord
[1:38:15] and the mind of Christ to know what to
[1:38:17] do with that word it's not something
[1:38:19] that's going to come we have it
[1:38:21] if we've got his Spirit within us who
[1:38:23] who is living in US
[1:38:25] Paul said I Die daily so that I die so
[1:38:28] that he can live
[1:38:31] whether Brandon goes on to say he says
[1:38:33] the on on thus saith the Lord that's all
[1:38:35] then you know you're right
[1:38:37] though you can't see it none of the
[1:38:39] senses will say it's right every one of
[1:38:41] them will say it's wrong
[1:38:43] but you know it's right because God said
[1:38:45] so that's what makes it right
[1:38:49] now his provided way now that's his
[1:38:52] provided way has been his word it is his
[1:38:56] word God's provided way for the human to
[1:38:59] live is not by your senses it's by his
[1:39:03] word
[1:39:05] this is this is pretty strong stuff here
[1:39:08] when we look at it because of course
[1:39:10] we're supposed to live according to our
[1:39:11] senses but
[1:39:13] it ain't what the prophets said it ain't
[1:39:15] what the messengers have said it's not
[1:39:17] what the word says
[1:39:19] Revelations chapter four part one
[1:39:22] it behooves us as Sons and Daughters of
[1:39:24] God to check up on ourselves every hour
[1:39:27] of the day
[1:39:28] Paul said I died daily
[1:39:31] yet I live
[1:39:33] not I but Christ lives in me see
[1:39:37] be checked up
[1:39:38] because you don't know what hour you're
[1:39:40] going to be someone to answer on high
[1:39:43] we don't know what hour
[1:39:45] just like Lazarus was carried away by
[1:39:48] the angels we don't know what hour that
[1:39:50] could happen
[1:39:51] could be any hour could be before we
[1:39:52] finish service here
[1:39:54] could be on the way home tonight could
[1:39:56] be in our bed while we're sleeping we
[1:39:57] could go to sleep tonight and think that
[1:39:59] maybe we could have spent 15 minutes in
[1:40:01] prayer before we went to sleep but
[1:40:03] instead we just lied down and and
[1:40:05] started to think about things and we
[1:40:07] just wound up going to sleep and never
[1:40:09] wake up
[1:40:10] we don't know we need to Die daily but I
[1:40:13] just have found this thought so amazing
[1:40:16] and I probably will stick on it a little
[1:40:17] bit I think there's a lot here be
[1:40:19] followers of me even as I also am of
[1:40:21] Christ you know First Corinthians 15 I
[1:40:24] protest by your rejoicing which I have
[1:40:27] Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily Paul
[1:40:32] is saying I Die daily I crucify the
[1:40:35] flesh I Lay My Life down Before the
[1:40:38] Throne of God
[1:40:39] brothers and sisters tonight the little
[1:40:42] word of encouragement that I wanted to
[1:40:43] bring I'll call up the musicians I I I
[1:40:46] just wanted to say it I think it's so
[1:40:49] important for us to recognize that our
[1:40:51] prayer counts
[1:40:52] our prayer counts for so much more than
[1:40:55] what Satan wants us to believe our
[1:40:58] spiritual success tomorrow
[1:41:01] depends on our prayer today amen
[1:41:04] amen and you know it's such an amazing
[1:41:06] thought because I I have always thought
[1:41:08] we need to have a scripture and and be
[1:41:11] able to have the ability to pray for a
[1:41:13] situation where we have the situation
[1:41:15] and yes that's true to a degree but our
[1:41:17] strength in our lives our true strength
[1:41:20] for overcoming
[1:41:22] tomorrow
[1:41:23] and the next day and the next day
[1:41:26] our strength is depending on us right
[1:41:28] now today
[1:41:29] and then next week is depending on
[1:41:32] tomorrow
[1:41:33] it doesn't work the way that we think we
[1:41:36] can just pray in the moment and God will
[1:41:37] just snap happen a solution our way and
[1:41:40] sometimes he will but more often than
[1:41:42] not brothers and sisters the success for
[1:41:45] us in our lives is depending on what
[1:41:47] we're doing right now it's depending on
[1:41:49] what we did yesterday and what we did
[1:41:51] before the day before that and what we
[1:41:53] did the day before that and you know
[1:41:54] what we were either going the way that
[1:41:56] God has given us or we were going our
[1:41:58] own way and if we were going our own way
[1:42:00] then we weren't in God's way
[1:42:02] and you know what happens is we open the
[1:42:04] door for the goats
[1:42:06] brother Branham talks about that that
[1:42:08] song that that brother Kelly sang that
[1:42:10] he preached and they said you know we we
[1:42:13] don't understand how the goats got in
[1:42:15] but what happened was they let down the
[1:42:17] bar they let down the bars and the Sheep
[1:42:19] got out and the goats got in and we know
[1:42:22] that's not a good situation because
[1:42:23] that's a type of the devil that's the
[1:42:25] type of spirits getting in and as
[1:42:27] spiritual leaders of our home we don't
[1:42:29] want to let the bars down we don't want
[1:42:31] to let the goats in our home
[1:42:32] Satan's not going to come in the way
[1:42:34] that we think he comes in he'll come in
[1:42:37] as a very flowery package but then he'll
[1:42:40] actually present himself as a bomb of
[1:42:42] some terrible disease or something that
[1:42:45] we're not expecting it's not the way it
[1:42:47] works
[1:42:48] we it doesn't happen the way we think is
[1:42:50] what I mean to say but you know how do
[1:42:52] we overcome in the moment brothers and
[1:42:53] sisters the more that we choose to Die
[1:42:55] daily that's how we overcome
[1:42:57] if we're followers of Christ as Paul is
[1:43:00] a follower of Christ he said he dies
[1:43:03] daily he said he crucified the flesh if
[1:43:05] we are willing to do that in our own
[1:43:07] lives then we will see success happen in
[1:43:09] our lives and and we were having a
[1:43:11] conversation about it you know how can
[1:43:13] we see the rubber meet the road in our
[1:43:15] lives when we have that great Temptation
[1:43:17] in our lives that comes around because
[1:43:19] every one of us has the thorn of the
[1:43:21] flesh we all suffer from many different
[1:43:23] things which is probably much more alike
[1:43:25] than we really want to actually
[1:43:27] understand but we're all created the
[1:43:29] same we're all created the same way we
[1:43:32] all came into this world through sin
[1:43:35] speaking lies having iniquity every one
[1:43:39] of us the same way
[1:43:41] but the more we choose to Die daily the
[1:43:43] greater our strength will become because
[1:43:45] he is strong in our weakness that's the
[1:43:48] song We sang tonight isn't it his
[1:43:50] strength is made perfect in our weakness
[1:43:52] not in our strength of our flesh and our
[1:43:55] understanding of knowing what to do but
[1:43:57] what happens brothers and sisters when
[1:43:59] we are looking for that delivering power
[1:44:01] the beautiful part about it this is why
[1:44:04] it's so good and I wanted to get here
[1:44:06] tonight I'm so glad that I can and I
[1:44:08] didn't talk too long but the the power
[1:44:10] the the the key the critical moment that
[1:44:13] I wanted to try and get across to us
[1:44:14] when we want to overcome these things
[1:44:16] these thorns in our flesh the Temptation
[1:44:19] the tempters that come around the Devils
[1:44:21] that come around and try and get us
[1:44:22] maybe in our temper maybe in lust maybe
[1:44:25] in whatever it is when they come around
[1:44:27] if we fortify ourselves in the word
[1:44:30] brothers and sisters we'll find
[1:44:31] ourselves in a situation where we'll say
[1:44:34] my goodness didn't that didn't that bug
[1:44:37] me before I thought that that used to
[1:44:39] bug me a year ago or six months ago we
[1:44:42] won't even be bothered by it and we'll
[1:44:44] Marvel that we were at one point it will
[1:44:47] just Dawn on us that that used to be a
[1:44:50] problem in our lives it won't be a
[1:44:51] struggle that we're trying to apply the
[1:44:53] word and find a solution and and calling
[1:44:55] someone to confess my faults because I
[1:44:57] know I've got this thing I got to deal
[1:44:59] with no way the battle spot on our knees
[1:45:02] and that fortifies us with the word and
[1:45:04] when we're fortified with the word what
[1:45:06] happens is the things that we thought we
[1:45:09] desired in this flesh we don't desire
[1:45:12] anymore
[1:45:13] those desires just vaporize they
[1:45:15] disappear and we get delivered from
[1:45:18] those Temptations those spirits that
[1:45:20] come around and and try and get us so
[1:45:22] many different ways but it all comes
[1:45:24] down to our willingness to follow Christ
[1:45:27] as Paul followed Christ and and that is
[1:45:30] dying daily getting on our knees and
[1:45:32] spending time in the word spending time
[1:45:34] in prayer prayer I think is the greatest
[1:45:36] weapon that we could ever have
[1:45:39] I know brother Branham says it I don't
[1:45:40] know if I have that quote tonight but I
[1:45:42] just believe brothers and sisters if
[1:45:44] we're willing to actually just lay down
[1:45:46] our lives in prayer we're willing to see
[1:45:50] God move in our lives in a greater way
[1:45:52] and if we've got struggles trials issues
[1:45:54] problems we can actually deal with them
[1:45:57] in a spiritual Manner and that's the
[1:45:59] only manner as a believer that we want
[1:46:01] to deal with things we don't want to uh
[1:46:03] Earthly solution a fleshly solution to a
[1:46:06] spiritual problem that's the worst thing
[1:46:07] that could ever happen we can be taught
[1:46:09] how to live with Spirits in our lives
[1:46:12] but who wants to coddle a spirit we can
[1:46:15] get rid of it in the name of Jesus
[1:46:16] Christ
[1:46:18] God bless you tonight if you'll stand
[1:46:19] with me
[1:46:22] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:46:24] tonight I pray that somehow some way we
[1:46:27] could have encouraged your children Lord
[1:46:29] maybe to just
[1:46:31] spend more time in prayer with you
[1:46:33] father to just maybe examine the word
[1:46:35] and see how Paul followed you
[1:46:38] after you revealed yourself to him Lord
[1:46:41] father I pray that tonight we would just
[1:46:44] be encouraged to recognize that there is
[1:46:46] overcoming power Lord Jesus and we can
[1:46:49] continually feed upon your word and as
[1:46:51] we can feed on your word we become the
[1:46:54] word and Lord Jesus there's no trick of
[1:46:56] the devil that can actually get us to
[1:46:58] stumble and fall
[1:47:00] we just thank you for your goodness to
[1:47:03] us Lord and we just ask tonight that
[1:47:05] Lord you would just take us a little
[1:47:07] higher in you and that you would just
[1:47:09] Reveal Your Word a little further to us
[1:47:12] and through US Lord Jesus and if it Be
[1:47:14] Your Will for us to gather again on
[1:47:16] Sunday
[1:47:16] we'll just be careful to give you all
[1:47:18] the praise
[1:47:19] father we love you and we thank you
[1:47:22] we just ask all these things now in
[1:47:24] Jesus Christ name we pray
[1:47:26] amen
