you the address if you don't have it last but not least I wanted to make sure I welcome brother Jeremy and sister Emily before we go to prayer this morning we just have a couple of things we'd like to thank the Lord for brother Aiden has a phrase report that he's happy to be in church this morning we're certainly happy to have you brother God bless you [Applause] brother Aiden got coveted and was struggling he had pneumonia and he's had a real hard time as of late and certainly good to see him here and you know it happened as soon as they made the decision to step forward and begin to play music with the rest of the brothers and sisters here I know the devil hates stringed instruments because remember David he cast out Devils with it didn't he absolutely did is that the Brennan's there God bless you [Applause] certainly thankful to have brother Andrew and sister Grace back in service [Applause] whether Andrew has been struggling in his body with gout uh it's been a real struggle it's certainly good to see the hand of the Lord in his life sometimes we have Miracles that are instant and sometimes we have healings that take some time but it's always the Lord's will for us to be healed in our bodies just a couple of requests that we would like to remember sister Tina who is in the hospital and uh sister funmi ajala for a safe return from Nigeria this week for the Frank Cronkite and if you have a need this morning maybe just make it known with an uplift hand as we go to him and Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to be able to present ourselves before you Lord together together the little licks of fire father that you have placed in your children that Holy Ghost spirit father to know that that is what makes up that Pillar of Fire Lord Jesus it's your very life and father we're so thankful that we can gather together this way freely Lord we don't know how many more days we'll have to do it father we don't want to ever take it for granted this could be the very last service that we are ever able to gather this way because we're so thankful Lord for your grace and your mercy to us lord well this morning we thank you for all of the praise reports Lord for the healing in the bodies Lord Jesus we know that healing is the children's bread father you didn't take those stripes so that we could be healed in the Millennium father so that we could be healed here on this side of Eternity and we thank you for your healing touch Lord father we thank you for touching brother Aiden Lord thank you for touching brother Andrew Lord Jesus thank you for touching each one who's suffering with a cold even right now father Lord we know that there's no devil that can stand in the way of your word father and this morning we just declare your word father you said by my stripes you are healed and we just claim that in the name of Jesus Christ as our own promise father Lord Jesus for anyone else who has a need that they've made known with an uplift hand we pray that you would just honor it father according to their faith this morning Lord Jesus and father we just want to remember sister Tina Lord in the hospital in the Foothills Hospital alone once again father Lord she needs a touch from you and she's decided to not have a surgeon intervene but to allow you to be the great physician father and Lord we just ask that you would come on the scene Lord Jesus father that you would be the the great physician in her life Lord father that there would be a testimony through our dear sister to the doctors to the medical system in the Foothills Hospital of your grace Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we ask for a safe return for sister funmi and Chala Lord that you would bring her back safely from Nigeria father this week thank you for bringing sister Grace home from Sweden this week father Lord we know that your hand is upon us everywhere we go and Lord Jesus that your angels are encamped about those who fear you and father we just acknowledge that and we thank you for your hand of protection in our lives Lord Jesus this morning as we go forwards Lord we pray that you would just take complete control father Lord that you would speak to us that you would speak the words you want spoken father and stop those that you don't and we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory we love you and we thank you Lord and we just ask all of these things in the name above every name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians we have a baptism this morning after service so we'll try not to keep us too long um certainly thankful for the desire in the heart of a believer to get baptized and I believe it's even more special to see the the life of a child recognize their position where there's a promise and it's for them so sister Shayla Livesey has desire to be identified in a watery grave this morning not literally but just to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that certainly is our pleasure to proceed with that if you'll turn with me in your Bibles today to Romans chapter 12. I'd like to take just a little bit of a a different thought but continue building on that which we have been talking about in the past certainly thankful for brother Gilbert taking the service last Sunday while we were in Saskatoon he's at uh brother Sig Clark's this morning taking the service there we'll just start with verse one of Hebrews or sorry Romans chapter 12. I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's just battle one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just ask that you would break this bread of life open to us fresh once again Lord we can bring the word and we can gather together and unite together in one mind and one Accord but father it takes your spirit to to bring it to our remembrance father it takes your spirit to Quicken it to our souls so father we just ask that together we could just walk with you along the way and that you would just open our eyes to this word we just love you father and we thank you for your goodness to us we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated sorry I'm dealing with a cold here a little bit myself and there's many people in the church that are dealing with it also and it's just the way it is I was commenting this week that it's amazing how we can now we can be sick we can have a cold or an illness and it's not illegal for us to be out it's not against the law it's kind of a strange thought once upon a time I would uh I would go to work and you know I had a business and people that would get sick I would say so what let's get to work you know if you have a cold that's okay we can still work but covet kind of changed everyone's perspective on that and uh I think we have a little more grace one for another when we are sick I know it's totally softened my perspective on it we have to have Grace one for another and if someone's not feeling well then we trust that the Lord will make them feel well just to have sister Tina on my heart and I just wanted to take a moment to just give a praise report sister Tina is dealing with the exact same condition that my mom is dealing with and originally sister Tina needed to get a pacemaker and she really didn't want to get one she wanted to trust the Lord to heal her heart and uh so she wound up getting a pacemaker and it changed her heartbeat and it allowed it to work properly but my understanding is that she has a leaky valve in her heart and it causes a problem when her heart pumps even though the timing is corrected with the pacemaker and what happens is um if it doesn't get corrected it becomes a real problem and it can actually cost you your life but uh the doctors can operate on it and uh in my mom's case the doctors had said that they could do that but because she has muscular dystrophy they said that she would go under the anesthetic and because of the weakness of her body she would not be able to come off of the anesthetic she would not recover from that type of a surgery and so I'm not sure where sister Tina is physically if she would be able to do that or not but I just want to say you know when we went in I went with my mom last week to the um the cardiologist and she had uh what's your a cardiogram before we met with the doctor the nurse did that and took all the measurements and checked her heart to see how it was and uh you know they had told her the only thing we can do is manage it with medication we can't do anything more humanly and it'll just take a miracle from God and so we've prayed for my mom I thank you everyone who has prayed the doctor said when he came in let's start with the good news and I had said to my mom maybe we'll get a good report today you never know and uh so the doctor said let's start with the good news and he said you know we We unexpectedly see an improvement in your heart this year over last year my mom and I we just looked at each other and we just said praise the lord we know what's going on we know that it's just tremendous so if he'll do it for my mom I know he'll do it for sister Tina and I know he'll do it for anyone who comes according to the same faith and you know I believe as a body of Believers we have the ability to intercede and just pray one for another I want to say that the Lord has been doing things for me in my life that I can't even explain to you I just know it's God it's God level stuff and it's just amazing how he's been dealing with me in the past few weeks um you know even the last few years but just these last few weeks has been really profound in my life and I am certainly thankful he is a living God and he just wants to bless us not not with a financial blessing he just want to bless us and give us a big fat home and all of that I'm not talking about that he wants to bless us with our our rights our rightful rights the ownership of this book the ability to recognize who we are according to the message of the hour it's so tremendous so we just give all the praise and all the glory to God for that praise report for my mom thank you all for your prayers I know she would appreciate saying thank you to everyone and we certainly want to remember sister Tina and her situation is that for sister Charmaine yeah God bless you Sister jarmeen brother Peter just pointed out that sister Charmaine walked in here today with her cane and not a walker that's God amen I saw the cane there and I said well sister Jermaine's always had a cane but that's not true she's also had a walker that's tremendous God bless you Sister just a couple of announcements before we get into the word today we've got the the worship service coming on the 25th we're not going to preach it's not a preaching service it's a worship service so if you feel encouraged and you just want to come and sing and maybe you want to bring a special maybe you want to read a poem whatever you want to do you're welcome to do it and do it unto the Lord and I'm sure it will be a blessing we had a prayer meeting on Thursday night and I can tell you it was probably one of the sweetest prayer meetings we've had there's something going on in the body of Believers here brothers and sisters there is a real Unity that's forming and it comes out in prayer and sometimes that's the only place it comes out but my goodness what a tremendous meeting it was on Thursday God bless you everyone who came it was a real blessing remember the potluck after service and uh let's go I want to talk today about being transformed we've been talking about it before how this whole world is into this trans thing and I don't want to bring that to the pulpit I've been almost embarrassed thinking about it you know I just want to be real clear God bless you Sister Amber I didn't see you here um I just want to be real clear that I don't want to try and promote Satan's agenda if anybody thinks that's what I'm doing I just want to make it real cut and dried clear I'm not interested in trying to promote Satan's agenda what I'm trying to do is show the contrast between the darkness and the light and you know there's some people that might get upset by even a little bit of the discussion about it but you know these are real events this is the real world that we're living in this whole world is trying to change their bodies on the outside and they don't even know why they think that maybe because they were born a certain way or whatever it is you know what it is it's instruction they're trying to bring it into the curriculum into the schools for the youngest of children to think that they can be whatever they want to be you know once upon a time our parents taught us you could be whatever you want to be you could be a doctor a lawyer an astronaut but nowadays what are they saying you can be whatever gender you want to be talk about being whatever you want to be it's like the absolute perversion but you know I don't want to I don't wanna dwell on that just for the record what I want to dwell on is the fact that they're behaving that way for a purpose is because there is a transformation that we are instructed to do according to the word of God there's a promise for this age and that's why we gather together this way because we recognize this promise for our day and this promise is that there will be a body change but it's not going to be from the outside in it's going to be from the inside out and the only way that's going to happen is if we just follow up on the word we know brother Branham came and fulfilled Revelations 10 1-7 and that's fantastic it's great that's what gives us the ability to step up on the platform and recognize that someone needs to take that book and eat it and if we're not willing to take that book and eat it we're not going to have a body change it's that simple God's power to transform is what I want to take from today it's a message preached in 1965. brother Branham talks about it two different sermons God's power to transform God has the power to transform brothers and sisters and he also has the power of God's transformation God's power of transformation and and both services are just tremendous and you know sort of the high level flyover is just that Satan has come and perverted Mankind and more than that Satan has come into this world and perverted the word of God in mankind through the fall in the garden but you know even through all of that God has the ability to help us to get up out of our chairs from that that that perverted state that we were in Once Upon a Time in our lives where we were all crippled up to this word and we couldn't even really move on our own but once upon a time we heard the voice of a Vindicated prophet and and it spoke to our very Soul it it it it it it it it touched that sea Gene of God inside of us and caused us to come to life that that seed broke forth and we're able to read this word we're able to hear this word you know brother badame talks about it when he reads the Bible in this message how every time he reads it there's something new every single time there's something new that comes to him it's not the same old word the same old same old the devil is going to tell us it's the same old same old you've read that Bible you don't need to read it anymore but you know what it's not us reading that word it's the spirit of God quickening that word to us while we read it that's what makes the difference that's why we don't want to read the word of God like a newspaper we don't want to just go from paragraph to paragraph and and do my 365 a day reading of the Bible and and have the Bible app and say that I've just checked check check I've read it all I've gone through it all of course we need to read the book but we need to read the book with the spirit of God we need to read the book with the Holy Ghost in our lives so it will Quicken it and every time we read it there will be something new is God hiding himself in Simplicity but then he doesn't stay hidden does he he reveals himself in the same brother says through every generation now for pretty near about 2 800 years or better this word of God has been read by men priests and so forth and never does it grow old I've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time I read it I find something new that I looked over the first time because it's inspired it is God in letter form see excuse me it's the attributes of God speaking forth and it's placed on paper many times man said well now man wrote this Bible no I just love that no period the Bible says itself that God wrote the Bible it is the word of God there isn't 66 different authors of the Bible there's one author of The Bible and there's a bunch of different scribes a bunch of different people that were chosen to actually put pen to paper and it never can fail Jesus said heavens and earth will fail pass away but my words shall never fail and it cannot fail and being God because it's part of him that sort of God's power to transform I apologize I'm going to cough a bit foreign I just think it's beautiful we have the ability to recognize what what day and hour we live in we can see this whole world acting the way it is it's it's Madness going on all around us and as I said I just want to underline it I want to highlight it I want to make it bold I'm not trying to promote Satan's agenda here I'm trying to promote the word of God for our day and we need to recognize what's going on this is all because of the anointing that's on the Bride of Jesus Christ because when the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go I just think it's so important for us to to recognize our position when we recognize that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ that we are fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God when we have gone to that place of adoption of being born again when we truly receive the new birth then when you speak brothers and sisters it's not you speaking it's deity himself it's the Lord Jesus Christ speaking and our words have power and we've said it in the past and I think it's so beautiful we can really realize that when we talk positive we're speaking truth we're speaking life we're creating but when we speak negative we're also doing the same and you know we've talked about it like one step forward and ten steps backwards we can have one or two steps forwards of positive but if we start chirping about something or someone murmuring about our position in in our lives not recognizing that God's allowed us to be there or we wouldn't be there don't think for a second we just slip into a position and it's just a big accident God's allowed us to get there so he can see what we'll do and even more than that he wants us to see what we'll do remember when Abraham went to the top of the mountain and God said to him when he was going to sacrifice his son Isaac he said now I know now I know that you love me God knew that he loved him he's God it was no surprise to God but Abraham didn't know the level of love that he had for his God wanted Abraham to see that level of love that's why he had that challenge could you imagine him explaining that to his wife we've waited 25 years for this son everybody said we're crazy we're putting together everything the more time went on the more crazy we sounded you're never going to have a baby you're old on and on and on they finally get the promised child he's now of age and he has to go now his God has told him that he needs to take him up and sacrifice him foreign will go over well in my home I would have to just take my son and say you know what God's given me Revelation we're going to go and and serve God and just see what happens but it was so that Abraham could understand it and that's why we have trials in our life it's so we can grow so we can learn so we can know him as our God and you know without that without trials how would we ever know that he's a deliverer how would we ever know that he's a Healer how would we ever know that he is the breasted one how would we ever know that we could draw strength from him when we need it thank you boy I thank you all for your prayers I know some were praying for me and uh certainly makes a difference I feel the prayers I trust you do as well you know there was a time where this word was transformed it's paragraph 37. now this word transformed I looked up in the dictionary yesterday when I almost lost track of the time that I was to be up here when I was looking for a text and I found this word or this text rather scripture and in the dictionary it says that it's something that's changed it's to be changed transformed made different than what it was it's been its character and everything has been changed in it to transform I thought about looking at my own definition but I I just landed here and I thought you know this is probably the best way to go it's just what the prophet said and just just take it the way that he said it it's to be changed transformed made different than what it was and so many people in this world are changing trying to make themselves different than what it was trying to make themselves better than what it was and not just in a Physical Realm brothers and sisters there's people Gathering Together under the banner the name of Jesus Christ that are trying to make themselves better and they're not realizing that they're not making themselves better because they're coming according to a tradition or a denomination and we know that where the denomination puts the period after God the spirit moves on and you know the last move the great last move that happened was the Pentecostal movement wasn't it there's people that would say well there was the Jesus only movement and that's true but the Pentecostal movement was the outpouring of the spirit there's no question about that the Azusa Street Revival but they had to take it and say just like every other Revival that there's only one true evidence and we've got it so now we need to quickly gather it and protect it and put a period behind it and as soon as they did that and said the initial evidence is just speaking in tongues the spirit of God moved on you're not going to put God in a box you're not going to do that he's going to do what he's going to do because he's God but we know that everything had to happen exactly the way it did for a purpose so that we could actually hear it in the day in which we live there had to be a time that we were given an opportunity for us to hear this word brother Branham says in in paragraph 38 and and I thinking this morning in Genesis 1 this world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the Earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden he says that is transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power brothers and sisters if you've ever been in that state where you're without form and your Void outside of the The Fellowship of the word for your day if you've ever experienced what it means to have the spirit of God move upon the face of your deep when you don't know where you're going to go if you were to die you know that's one of the biggest things that we see even in amongst the message of the hour is people are afraid people are afraid to die why would we be afraid to die what will we what do we have to fear because Paul said to die is to gain I keep saying this and I'm sorry I don't mean to make people feel uncomfortable but brothers and sisters this is the reality every one of us need to go one way or the other we're going to go by the way of the Grave we're going to go by the way of the sky in this message brother Branham talks about uh sister shakarian right at the beginning of this message if you want to listen to it and he talks about it he says that we're all going to have to go that way and if you take the words of the Prophet you say that's the absolute and that means none of us are actually going to go in a Rapture we're all going to go by the way of the grave I'm not here to debate it either way but what I am here to say is make sure you know where you stand make sure you know that when the pressure comes and stands on you like that pop can that you're going to withstand that pressure you're not going to crush under it outside of being filled and sealed you'll be crushed will be crushed and we know we know it we know it you can't pretend it we can pretend it all the way all the way along but when we get to that hospital bed brother Brown tells that story remember that woman she was in the hospital bed she was about to die and her body and her soul and her spirit were starting to separate that moment before death was happening and she started to freak out she started to cry out she started to say you deceived me to her pastor and wanted her pastors say quick give her another hypo she's starting to get crazy she's starting to speak the truth and he knew it but she knew it also she was deceived brothers and sisters don't let ourselves get to that place we got to know that we know that we know where we stand but you know when that happens Satan's powerless before you you know if you ever have somebody who is a bully and they come and they bully you around as long as you cower from it they're going to try and do that but if you stand your ground one time and you say I'm not going to be afraid of you anymore you're going to change their demeanor their whole entire perspective of the situation is going to change and you know we hear ministers say it uh brother Branham said it there was that that vision of the devil he was just a tiny little guy and what happened every time that he would step forward he would say boo and every time he would say boo he would get a little bigger and before long he was the big monster sometimes we need to step forwards and say Boo back devil and not because we just want to say boo back because we want to have this chest bumping thing with the devil we want to say hey I know exactly where I stand and I don't have any power on my own oh my but according to the message of the hour under this Pillar of Fire Satan you've got no power you're powerless before me because I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I recognize my position we've got to know where we stand brothers and sisters this is not an hour for being wishy-washy it's not an hour for just playing church it's not an hour to just say that I'm a part of a group and I know that everything is going to be okay because it's just what I believe you've got to know Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever for your own personal savior the random talks about this nothing but a complete chaos and I know in my life I can speak this I was in complete chaos I mean this world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden that is transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power we have the ability to actually have that transforming power in our lives brothers and sisters our scripture this morning verse two of Romans chapter 12. I keep wanting to say Hebrews Romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed to this world don't let the world have influence on you brothers and sisters don't worry about what Hollywood's doing don't worry about what what trends are don't worry about letting worldliness creep into the church letting it creep into our homes brothers and sisters it's a time to not get shaky we don't want to be wishy-washy I said it already you know we heard it on the weekend in Saskatoon what a tremendous bunch of services but you know what faith lies in the church and if it doesn't get preached it lays dormant maybe we've seen people go on in our lives and because God has taken them home it doesn't mean we don't have faith it doesn't mean that the prayer of the faith hasn't saved the sick it's because God has said it's time for that person to come home and that's that but you know when we're dealing with prayer when we're dealing with faith we just need to trust God and say not my will but thy will be done and remember brothers and sisters what's his will his will is his word as well as his word he always answers our prayers you know in this message brother Branham talks about it he takes the time to just really really spell it out how how God is the sort of the attributes of God and you know he can speak and and he can write and and I think it's almost amusing how you hear some people say that you'll never hear the audible voice of God I don't know about that I I don't know about that maybe we wouldn't with a microphone that we could pick up and put it on tape but you know we can hear all what is it 1200 messages of God who was it that was speaking there was that not the audible voice of God you can hear the audible voice of God but he can also write and you know we we know that he spoke to Moses on the back side of the desert when he was looking after his father-in-law's sheep he spoke to Moses lip to ear as a friend we know that he wrote the Ten Commandments with his finger twice God did that he can read he can write and he can speak and we know that he actually came and and went Babylon was was was in trouble he came and he wrote on the wall he wrote on the wall and and what did he say meanie Meeny take care who parison you've been naughty you haven't been a very good boy you've been found guilty in the balance and today your kingdom will be ended you know that's God but I want to go further with that brothers and sisters in our age we've had it happen again and and I don't know if we've heard it said very much but in our age he came into the Branham Tabernacle and did the same thing brother Brown took the time to write out the seven Church ages with the cycle of the moon we've all seen the picture and if you haven't we can show it to you it's in the the seven Church age book but brother Brown wrote it out on the Blackboard but then he says in the message of the hour I think don't quote me on this but I think he said about for three to four hundred people sitting there witnessed it the hand of God comes and writes it out on the black back wall exactly what the prophet for our day wrote on the Blackboard he's the same yesterday today and forever he can read he can write you don't want to put him in a box and say that he can or can't do anything he's God he can do anything absolutely anything you know what he's looking to do today brothers and sisters mankind has been given a perversion mankind has been given a state of of humanity a state of physical being a state of mental being where all of it has been perverted and we could say that no not mine or no not me my life is good but you know we have brother Branham say it you know the the genetically modified foods it's a perversion right it's twisting of the foods it it the way that foods have become so processed it's changed our bodies it's changed our minds there's no way that we could deny that look at all the poisons in the world I can't remember what you call it somebody might know it one of the one of the most I would say difficult things for this age for the scientists to figure out is how they can get rid of some of these chemicals that they've created brother Branham talks about them how on their own these chemicals these atoms are fine they're in nature they're just there but boy when you take them and you step into God's laboratory and you start to bring these atoms together and you create things you can make chemicals they don't break down and they have them in clothing one of the biggest things is they have it in fire retardant for airports all around the world it's leaching into the atmosphere into the environment we have it in in T-Fal non-stick spray non-stick pens it's one of the biggest ones when it first came out these chemicals man has created has caused a perversion to our health excuse me bye but you know we've been given I would say an antidote for it as terrible as this looks some of these chemicals some of this perversion that we deal with it'll never be fixed by mankind it's going to take a complete renovation of this world it's going to take what brother Branham says hundreds of miles of deep Earth to flip upside down to completely just redo this whole entire world to go back to that Garden of Eden state you know we've been given this instruction in our day to not be conformed to this world but to be transformed how do we get transformed brothers and sisters not by an outward appearance sometimes we can get transformed and we can we can go and buy some nice new clothing and we can say look there's been a transformation to that person and sure enough there has been if they're not used to wearing that kind of clothing but it's an outward expression and what we need to do is actually have the inward expression that's what needs to come out because we know that God said to his disciples he said to the Pharisees and the Sadducees that's not what goes into the mouth that defiles the man it's what comes out of his mouth because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and you know where the The Treasure of the heart is that's where your mouth will be that's what we'll be talking about we'll be expressing what's on the inside of us and and if we're not conformed to this world but we're transformed by the renewing of our mind we're going to be focused on the word of God and that's going to be what we want to focus on that's what we're going to be wanting to talk about we're going to want a fellowship around the word of God in our lives it's not going to be what the latest sports forecasts are it's not going to be what what's happening in politics it's not going to be all these different things in the world it's going to be what about the word of God where are we truly at today remember the children of Israel they sat in in bondage for 30 years over the promise and I don't know for the the message Believers of our day are we going to stand in the wilderness in bondage here for any extra days are we going to go into overtime Lord help us Amen brother I say that I say that too Lord help us we don't want to do that let's not be conformed to this world brothers and sisters but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove not that he may prove that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and what is his will his will is his word when his word is on your lips it's in your heart you're going to prove what is acceptable will is brothers and sisters we've been given this instruction to not be conformed to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and I know that's why we come to church that's why we believe the message of the hour we feed on the word we teach our children we we live and we breathe this message of the hour into the world around us we're Fanatics people will say that we're cult level but for anyone that would want to just dare take a look at the message of the hour listen to what this prophet of God spoke he said if you can't take my word for it take God's word for it just take the word of God over my word how many false prophets in this world have ever said those words I bet you're not one of them because they know they would put themselves into subjection with the word of God at that point and what does a false prophet Anointed with brothers and sisters it's not the spirit of God we know that it's the spirit of the devil it's that that poison that polluting that happened in the Garden of Eden that's what it is it's an anointing an anointed one brother Brandon preaches that message false anointed ones at the end time there's people who will be Christ's anointed ones but they'll be false ones it's true but I bet not one of them will say just take the word of God over my word take the word of God over my word you know second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16 where Four Hands fourth no we no man after the flesh maybe go ahead turn there turn with me to Second Corinthians chapter five let's just dwell on this for a minute or two I think it'll be real good still got lots of time is everybody okay this morning God bless you brother Jerry Sister Mary good to have you here they're traveling back from up north my understanding is they got to see the buses as well certainly tremendous to know that they're still fellowshipping with the church I believe they're streaming too God bless you second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more if we look at the man through the flesh brothers and sisters we're going to be disappointed don't look at a man after the flesh don't look at me after the flesh I will surely disappoint you children don't even look at your parents after the flesh look at your parents according to the word of God if you look at your parents according to the flesh they're going to disappoint you you're going to start to see Humanity you're going to start to see things that maybe they don't line up maybe just a simple example if you get to be 50 like me you'll tell your children's stories that you've already told them and they'll be like Daddy haven't you said that to us already you've already told us that story John he's gonna say it again yep I'm gonna tell you again it's human it's Humanity if we look at the flesh we're going to be disappointed there's faults and there's failures and and if we do that brothers and sisters it's not good but no no man after the flesh is what the word of God says don't look at our brothers don't look at our sisters after the flesh look for the word of God in our brothers and our sisters look at our parents and say are they leading us according to the word of God is what's being preached at church what's being preached at home that has to be a congruent message henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now know we him no more don't want to look at even Christ after the flesh because we know that he's not in the flesh anymore right he died he rose again and he was given a glorified body he went up into heaven and sat down on the right hand of the father and that's where he is right now but I can say we can take this and and and spin it another way it's it's it's an amazing thought and we know that brother Bradham said the message of the hour is going to be so close that it would deceive the very elected that it would be razor thin razor blade thin how many people know how thin a razor blade is a straight razor it's it's a foil and it's super flexible very very thin I don't know what the exact measurement of it is but that's how close it will be brothers and sisters the two Vines they grow together all the way along in this message here brother Branham talks about how he is on his way back to Jeffersonville to preach the trail of the serpent the the the serpent from the beginning to the serpent at the end and we know it wasn't time for that to be preached or he would have gone there and preached it was going to be so close that it would deceive the very elected and you know when questions and answers brother Branham he says that we brought it a little while ago someone says are you are you supposed to look like Jesus are you what Jesus looks like are you deity are you God the question and and he said you know what brother or sister ever who it is you're so very very close but so very very far it's so close to being absolutely correct but it's so close to being absolutely Antichrist and and that's the way it is brothers and sisters when you have God's spirit in you who truly are you we know the prophet said I've got to decrease so that he could increase where do we stand with that are we looking to increase are we looking to get a greater stature in this life and and create a an Empire are we looking to die out so we could see Christ lived through our lives but if we look at the man doesn't matter who it is we're going to be disappointed somewhere along the way we're going to be disappointed we're going to see the hinder parts and we know that was the deal with balak and and Balaam balak wanted to hire Balaam to come and curse God's people and and he went and asked God and God said no you're not going to do it I've already blessed them and you can't curse what God's blessed too bad and so he he begged him and pleaded with them excuse me he even took him and showed him gave him a great celebration and and brought them to the the celebration to see from the hinder Parts come and look at the back side of them those good polished Believers for their day come and see the way that they behave see the way they treat their wives see the way they treat their children see the way they behave in and out of church see the hinder parts and he did it three times and we know that it didn't work out good for him but in the end they were able to come up with something else a deviation they cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel we know it's something that God never forgave them we don't want to be looking at the men if we start looking at the man we can actually be stumbled in our own flesh and you know brothers and sisters the worst thing that can happen is if we do that and then we start to talk about it what we do is we cast stumbling blocks in front of other people and you know sadly we'll be answering for that one day that's the way it goes and I say Lord forgive me because I've done it I'm guilty I'm not saying this is something that someone's doing and I'm trying to preach down at anybody I'm saying Lord help me this is something I've experienced in my life if we look at the man we will be disappointed but brother Branham says it how many times in the message of the hour don't look at the man Look Away to Jesus Look Away to Calvary Look Away to the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the one he's the only one verse 17. in second Corinthians chapter 5. therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature he's been transformed he's a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters when we get the new birth then All Things become new and we're not looking at a progression State we're on a walk and we're gonna we're gonna get saved and we're going to get the new birth and then we're going to get baptized and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not converted until we get the Holy Ghost Jesus asked Peter do you love me he said feed my sheep but right now you're not converted but when you are converted you'll have the power to do that you'll be just fine we've got to be converted completely I think that uh just sort of to this point brothers and sisters this is a totally separate quote and uh you don't have to bring it up God if you want to we've got a little bit of time I guess it's on 1964-0802 future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride we can recognize our position talking about our position as husband as wife as the Bride of Jesus Christ paragraph 267. it says and if you are the bride the Bride is a part of the husband and if the only place that you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of the husband he has in Brackets that word you are we need to recognize what part of that word what part of our husband we really are or you can't recognize being the bride many people recognize that the prophet said it's the bride Age and and where the Bride of Jesus Christ but can we recognize what our part is in that word what is our part of being the bride I think it's beautiful how many sees that he says CeCe you have to recognize your position your position if you're the bride brothers and sisters is that you have Satan under your feet he's got no power over you he's going to come around and he's going to be a squatter I don't know if we do we talk about squatter on Wednesday he's going to be a squatter he's going to try and exert squatter's rights he's going to come around and try and squat in our our home in our service he's going to try and squat anywhere that he can on our health he's going to try and squat everywhere that he can and say that I've been here this long because I've been here this long I have right to this position brothers and sisters he's got no right to the position of the Bride of Jesus Christ because to him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my Throne that's the promise for the laodicean age that is exactly where Satan desired to go he was going to exalt himself above all of those above the clouds to sit on the sides of the north to exalt himself to be like the most high brothers and sisters that was a perversion of the most high because you if you do accept this word you understand your position then you are the most high because you have his Spirit living inside of you you can't have his spirit inside of you and not be him can you I'm sorry it's true though we'll go on to read 268 he says you can't recognize somebody else's you've got to recognize your own position don't look it man look in the mirror you can't recognize somebody else's what if Moses would have come with Noah's message and what if Noah was a part of it but it wouldn't have worked what if if Jesus would have come with Moses message it wouldn't have worked see it was a different age it was a different prophecy a different part of the word had to be fulfilled there day was in another day of the week not Tuesdays work can be done on Wednesday and Wednesday has got to be done on Wednesday see Saturday has to be Saturday's work see and brothers and sisters today is our day don't look to tomorrow don't look to yesterday today right now even in this service is our day brothers and sisters if you've got a need in your heart he is here he is more than able to meet it don't let Satan have any squatters rights in your life and think well I just haven't had God Made Real to me say be it unto me according to Thy word make yourself real to me be God if you are God just be God to me let me see you in the power of your Resurrection I'm tired of just coming to church I'm tired of just living a life and thinking that one day I'm gonna get there just bring it to me and allow me to see it and I guarantee it brothers and sisters he will show you beyond your wildest imagination it will turn into a Garden of Eden setting in your mind your world won't change don't look around to people this is why we can't look at people I came to church for the first little while and I was oh my I was amongst angel I can say it I know brother Branham talks about it but I can truly say it I was amongst Angels everyone was so sweet and kind and tender and encouraging and you know what a little bit of time goes by and before long somebody steps on your toes and you're like man did anybody see that you see what that guy did goodness sakes and before long something else happens and then something else happens and then you have to wonder is this even real but then you got to go back to that time and say well I said God be unto me according to Thy word and it's got nothing to do with the rest of the people it's only about you and God and if you want it to be that kind of a relationship he will have that kind of a relationship and you know Naturally Speaking when you've got that kind of a relationship in the world your husband your wife you know nobody can ever get between you there's zero perversion it doesn't matter what comes your way Satan wants to come around and deform us he wants to try and deform Us in this message he talks about how he would go up through the fields it's uh it's going back to the Gods uh the first message we're talking about God's power of transformation I believe it is paragraph 67 some years ago on patrol going up through the corn fields I would think of there was a limb had blown off a tree you ever see anything like this in nature there was a limb that blown off a tree and had fell over on a stalk of corn and the stock was trying its best to get up straight like it was supposed to be but it was deformed because that something had happened and the stick was laying over it I just can't help but think brothers and sisters he's not telling this just because he's telling a story he's talking about people it's people that are stalks of corn and in nature sometimes something will happen and it will hurt that stalk of corn there will be a branch that'll hit it and it'll cause that stalk of corn to become deformed and I'm not talking physically maybe somebody's had a tree hit them what I'm talking about is emotionally physically in our Spirits in our innermost beings we can become damaged we can become so hurt that we become deformed because we don't recognize that God's in complete control and we become deformed and the worst thing that can happen is we start to look at people and when we look at people and we look from a deformed perspective then other people become deformed and that's what I was just talking about we got to take a step backwards and say whoa this is God's has allowed this for a purpose and and I'm having a relationship with God here what is he trying to show me through this situation what is he trying to show me through this circumstance because you know when we truly have had that relationship with God doesn't matter what the deformation the devil tries to bring to us we're still going to believe the word of God and that's what brother Branham gets to in the God's power to transform that's the message God's power to transform we got to look for the word brothers and sisters they don't want to be caught up looking at one another we want to look at the word in other people's lives and I just I don't know if I just said it but I want to say it now you know in one way or another we've all been deformed this is the world that we live in whether we've eaten some of those chemicals contaminated Foods maybe we've seen something that we shouldn't have seen maybe we've read something we should never have read maybe we've heard something that we can never unhear maybe all of these things happen to us that's the world that we live in and it causes us to become deformed in one way or another but you know we have to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and if we are willing to come according to the scripture for our day he will make us a new creature but we have to be in Christ Jesus in order to become that new creature we can't do it on our own we can't just go to church and expect it just church attendance is going to do it for us dropping a tithe in the offering bucket that's not going to do it for us we have to have that personal relationship that real intimate place where we know him as our husband and he knows us as our wife we've got to be able to have that otherwise we'll remain deformed and you know when we are deformed if we don't actually get help for it we will become further deformed because we're already in a state of deformation if you think of the stock of corn and it's already maybe leaned over and trying to grow up around the branch that fell on its shoulder and it's struggling now there's really no resiliency when another Branch comes along and falls on it or another something happens to it in in the humans lives it's the same thing if we're already not over something and and not giving it over to God is what I mean because there's many things in our lives we'll never get over let's just be clear about that we can never tell someone you just need to get over it it doesn't work that way there's things that happen in life that you cannot get over but we know that God will take us through it I've experienced things in my life that I'll never get over some things are embarrassing some things are hurtful some things are just things that happen and you got to wonder why but then you step back and know that God's in complete control but we can't let them deform us from what the word of God says that we need to be his will is his word and we're told to be transformed by the renewing of our mind to say be it unto me according to your word for my day you know maybe we haven't had something dramatic happen to us maybe something terrible hasn't hasn't happened in our lives but we've still been born in sin right through relationship with our parents born in sin shaped in iniquity knowing that we should do something and haven't and knowing that we shouldn't do something and have born in sin shaped and iniquity and we come into this world speaking lies human beings this hybrid condition it wants to lie it's just the way it is so whether we realize it or not we have been put in a position where we will either be transformed by the anointing for the word by the word in our day will either be transformed by it by the renewing of our minds will become a new creature in Christ Jesus or we will become deformed by the poison that's put upon this age because we know to reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of the beast that's really what it is it's cut and dried brother brownie talks about this in this message he talks about the creeper in in the next paragraph oh my my voice is going he talks about the creeper and we're not talking about a video game here those people who know you know God's power to transform 1965. and we find a wild creeper in the field I just think it's so good the way he does these two comparisons because one of them is the branch falling on a stalk of corn and the other one is really soft and subtle and that's what we're getting to here then we find a wild creeper in the field which many of you men here and maybe some of you women if you come from Kentucky the woman uses the hoe they're the same as the man get out in the field with a hole we call it the gooseneck hole and chop The Creepers out for if you didn't get those Creepers out where the corn was in the row like this then that creeper would reach over and grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself gradually around gradually so easily and slyly that you would excuse me hardly tell it was rapping and finally get stronger and stronger and it pulls that corn till it's deformed pulls it against itself wraps it around its own Vine deforming it what it was to something else yet it's corn but it's deformed corn again brothers and sisters people's lives Satan is soft he's the most subtle beast of the field and he'll creep in ever so gently and he'll just be a tiny little weed in our lives just a teeny little thing and if we don't deal with it when it's a teeny little thing my goodness it'll turn into a big thing for those people who don't really understand and you want to have the visual if you do come to our place today take a look at our garden when you drive in the driveway we've got all of the rows planted nicely and we got a whole bunch of tender little weeds we've been picking them but you know what they keep coming and if you don't do something with them the weeds are going to take over and the plants that you've planted will get choked out well here brother Brandon was talking about something further these are vines that they live off the life of other things and the only way they can survive is to actually grow and wrap around and grow and wrap around I think some of the folks maybe from the West Coast would be able to identify with the blackberries those those are vines that creep and they grow like that some of the people from the South would understand the the vines that grow those Vines they'll grow all the way up a telephone pole and across the wires the guide wires they'll choke everything and anything out and that's what Satan wants to do in our lives and you know don't be deceived brothers and sisters he won't necessarily use a monster looking thing to creep in our lives and choke The Life of Christ out of us he might use something like an angel of Light he might use a really good job or a really good career something that will just absolutely choke The Life of Christ out of us because we're so busy to spend time in prayer we're so busy to go to church we're so busy to do all the things that we know we should do these creepers will choke the life right out of us if we're not careful but they start so gentle so tender so slyly he says here we have to be very careful paragraph 69 and we are all still in the image of God but some are so deformed as sons of God just to be clear I'm not just making this up this is what the prophet said and we are all still in the image of God but some are so deformed as sons of God that walk contrary to his word and to the way that he had us and provided for us to walk so I don't know if anybody here today fits this description I have lived it I have been there as the Son of God and I have had those creepers wrapped around me I have nowhere to go no way to go nowhere to look but up and and God knows exactly where we need to get to and if we find ourselves there brothers and sisters there's a way we just need to be conformed we need to be transformed I mean not conformed having this Vine wrapped around us is getting us to conform we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind brother Adam says he he had provided he had us and provided for us to walk setting something the world twists us out of the way pulls Us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God just exactly that row of seeds in the garden right in that straight narrow strip to be planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God sin has done this evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of God come and deformed us and caused us to maybe have an emotional hurt maybe have something very confusing maybe have an unanswered prayer maybe something in our life we just don't understand but we have to trust God and if we're willing to do that I know I promise you he will reveal the truth to you my my desire today brothers and sisters is not to say that we're all deformed is to say that this world is under the influence of being transformed on the outside and the reason it is is because the Sons and Daughters of God are the ones that creation is groaning for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God there's an anointing on this age brothers and sisters for us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds by this word for our day and every single time we accept this word into our spirit womb we are a virgin to this word it doesn't matter how many times you feel like you've sinned doesn't matter how many evil thoughts have come into your mind that Satan has tried to pollute you with it's just the devil you don't have evil thoughts Satan gives you evil thoughts and if you choose to act on them that shows kind of where we stand but you know the more that we take this word of God in our lives the more that we take his thoughts into our mind the more we will have strength to withstand those evil thoughts and it doesn't matter how many evil thoughts we've had doesn't matter how many sins we've had doesn't matter how many attributes of sin we've had we can be transformed by the renewing of our mind if we just simply allow the Lord to be Lord in our lives we know many people they claim Jesus Christ and they claim the blood but they don't want the Lord to be Lord over their lives because he rules then when he speaks they listen when he says I want this to be this way I want women to wear dresses I don't want them to wear clothing that pertains to a man when he says these things I don't want them to cut their hair I want them to keep their hair long because it's their covering when he says that he wants a dad to be a dad in the home when he wants a mom to be the mom in the home all these different things that he says he expects to follow but Satan's going to come around and be the deformer he's going to come around and try and and spray poison on the word of God just like he did from the very beginning In the Garden of Eden and we know how did he do that by reasoning right Eve was with her husband in the garden God had created man in his own image male and female created he them and then he needed someone to toil till the soil right he he he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth he created man to be a living Soul at that point and it went further than that he actually took the bride out of the side of Adam he created Eve now she was a woman given to him to give him company to to be a help meet for him and there she was in the garden and Satan knew it he just waited for his moment and what did he do he came in and he sprayed his poison his deformer poison and what did he say you know what Thou shalt not surely die he said one word off of the truth he brought the truth to her with one deformation of the truth right one bit of poison in there and you know one bit of poison is enough and it's all it will take brothers and sisters to get us off the word of God it will it will cause destruction is to be one word off that's what caused the entire fall and what happened was she acted on that thought she acted on that perverted thinking that Satan brought to her and it caused the fall but you know there is a power to transform and I don't want to dwell on the deformer and the poison that he brings but I just want to remind us that we're living in Satan's Eden he's had 6 000 years God created the Garden of Eden we don't know how long it took we've had discussions about it was it six thousand years the the creation because a day is is the same as a year in in God's world was it six thousand years to create the Garden of Eden and and so God created his bride in Adam's Bride In the Garden of Eden and and here we have his bride fall but then he gave Satan six thousand years and said go on just make your Garden of Eden go ahead and do it and then I'll take my bride out of your garden that's fine and and she will be a virgin to my word she will not turn my word down when she hears it and Satan probably chuckled and said yeah right I'll get her to curse you to your face she'll have cancer she'll be all deformed she'll have tree branches on her stalks she'll be so deformed she'll never ever ever but here we are hey brothers and sisters here we are today you know we've all had deformation in our life but the power of transformation can take us Beyond it it can allow us to to not not just forget about it but to overcome it he's not going to deliver us to our trials but he'll find a way through the trial to bring us through it to Deliver Us from it you know paragraph 70. brother Branham says the deformer I know this seems to be rather strange to speak of it in this way but to deform but that's what he was he deformed or perverted pervert means to be changed over made something different and deform is the same thing and it's been brought over and deformed and made in another way yet it's still the same seed but it's deformed and I love the way brother Branham said it in the paragraph earlier that we read he said sons of God that are deformed brothers and sisters it's not it's not a bad thing to admit that I have had something happen in my life I've had a hurt I've had a misunderstanding you know brother Bradham he tells a story I can't remember what message it is even I think it's around this this era in 1965. but brother Bradham tells the vision of how he saw the people locked in behind the bars and they were groaning and trying to get out and and brother Branham he saw was it Roy borders he was in there and he said brother borders brother borders I I hope you can get out of there what's wrong with you what's wrong brother borders and he said brother Branham this is the house of hell and he saw those people and he said I just stood back and I just watched those people for a while because I thought maybe they'd get out I wanted to see what would happen and he saw that they were trapped behind those bars and and you know I I think it's amazing to think about excuse me those bars we heard talked about on the weekend those bars were bars of misunderstandings bars of misunderstandings people misunderstanding the word of God people misunderstanding one another and to think there was a time where the Prophet heard those words deliver those people and what did he say House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ set those people free and you know brothers and sisters I want to say that today if we've got bars of misunderstanding in our lives let's let's break those bars down in the name of Jesus Christ let's not let those bars rule us and be a ceiling over us or keep us from going forwards we've got to be able to get through those bars of of misunderstanding brother Branham he talks about it how Sons and Daughters of God can be disformed and and it's not a bad thing it's just a thing you know nature the way God created it we were talking about yesterday I was on the phone with my brother and the way nature is is neither good or bad it just is one animal eats another animal it's sad from a human compassionate perspective but that's just the way God created it one animal is there for another animal's food but the devil has perverted it Satan has perverted it he's taken this world that we live in and made it his Eden and you know it's not going to get any brighter the forecast is that it's going to get a whole lot darker and a whole lot stormier and that's why brothers and sisters we need to know exactly where we stand this is not a time to be wishy-washy with church it's not a time to not know where we stand with the message of the hour whether God sent a prophet or whether he didn't you know I say it to people if God were to send a prophet today if you were to send a prophet to Earth today would you want to hear that message would you want to hear what he had to say because a prophet is a messenger from God and and most people say yeah I would but I just can't do that or I just can't do the other thing and and it's too bad really because we know a Noah's day they were told it's going to rain but what did they say scientifically we can prove it ain't gonna rain we know it's not going to rain Noah you're crazy you got sunburned your crazy old crank up there beating on the wood on the hill building that boat I just keep going back to this and I apologize brothers and sisters but I do think it's really this clear and this simple that it is that way unless we get in the boat we're not going to make it and the boat is the message of the hour don't be conformed to this world brothers and sisters but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and the renewing of your mind to what the renewing of your mind to this message of the hour that God did send a prophet and he had a message that he loves you not that you have to know all these Mysteries this is something that I think needs to be spoken real clearly is all of these Mysteries they're not going to save you understanding the seals they're not going to save you understanding the seven unknown Thunders they're not going to save you there's people that want to take and make all of this understanding all of this knowledge all of this learning to be the saving Factor that's not going to save you having a relationship with Jesus Christ is what's going to save you the only thing you've got to do is recognize him as your savior today that he died and rose again so that you could be saved so that you could go and sit with him in his throne and if you're willing to do that then all the rest of this will just become clear to you you'll just understand what this means but brothers and sisters therefore If any man be in Christ how do you get into Christ you get into his word because he is his word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new and it's a very true statement brothers and sisters if you get into Christ Jesus just one time everything changes in your life you are not the same person that you once were it is impossible and you know I just think I want to encourage us today brothers and sisters don't listen to the devil he's a liar and anytime you want to know whether it's the devil or not compared to the word whatever it is you're thinking whatever the the thoughts are that are coming to you whatever someone is saying to you just to see if it lines up with the word or not and if it doesn't then just leave it alone but I want to encourage us with this Romans 8 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but they walk after the spirit we don't walk after this flesh we're not conforming to this world we're not looking to see if we can be like Hollywood we're not looking to see if we can be like the music or the video games or all of these influencing social media things brothers and sisters all of that is going to burn that will take us down but if we can focus on the word of God for our day we will recognize that we're not walking after this flesh but we're walking after the spirit of God and the spirit of God is what's going to take us to that place where we know that there's no condemnation so if I were to walk out of here today and get hit by a bus and and my soul would fly out of my body and I would go I would go to heaven I wouldn't have to go to the morgue and risk going to hell risk going to Hades risk going to the grave and not know where I'm going to be and and what's going to happen but that's what happens to people who don't know who haven't made it right with God why I don't know why I'm doing this it's it's it's the way it is brothers and sisters we need to know where we stand and when we do we have no fear and why is that because our goal is to get charity isn't it the Capstone Ministries to have charity and charity is love and love love casts out all fear so if we see someone in fear it's sad but we can say you know what something ain't right there according to the message of the hour according to the word for our day when someone's deathly afraid something wrong you know brother Bosworth on his Deathbed brother Brown and went and had the conversation with him and said oh my how do you feel they said I feel great and he said but you're dying they said no I'm not I'm more alive right now than I ever was and I'm seeing Believers all over the place I'm seeing the promise of my life come to pass I'm not afraid to die I just think it's such a beautiful thing maybe maybe I'm gonna go and have a situation but I just said I don't know why I'm talking like this I think it's so bizarre but we just need to know where we stand don't we this is a world where it's just crazy it's upside down and I just want to encourage us what are we looking at we were talking about this with the young people and it was such a beautiful conversation I'm sorry that I had to get so tired and go to bed the young people stayed till very late and I think it's tremendous it's a wonderful thing you know some parents might get upset by that but I want to say this the young people are going to do something and what would you rather have them do hang out with Believers or go and find their own entertainment somewhere I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a living witness you don't want them to go and find their entertainment out there brothers and sisters get them with Believers get them with believers do all you can to get them with Believers as parents it's our responsibility to make sure that our children are fellowshipping with believers but what are we looking at that's the key we were talking about it with the young people and I I think it's beautiful because it applies to the adults too not just the young people and I know we're talking about young adults but the key takeaway from our conversation is our attitude is everything our attitude is absolutely everything and we know that brother Branham says it that a right mental attitude towards any one of the Divine promises in the word will actually bring it to pass having the right mental attitude towards the word of God brothers and sisters will make all the difference but if we've got the attitude where maybe it's indifference maybe it's sin maybe it's different things in our lives Traditions or whatever our attitude is going to make all the difference but there's a promise for our age let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 15. as we close today I'll call the musicians because we have the baptismal I don't want to go too long here still have a little bit here I think it's just wonderful this word of God that we have our attitude makes all the difference brothers and sisters First Corinthians 15 verse 51. behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed there is going to be a body change and whether we go by the way of the grave there will be a body waiting for us because we know that if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there is a body already waiting for us and if we're not present in this body that means that we're present with God right behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed did you just think about that word Incorruptible for a second what that means there's no power over death there's no no power of death over us there's no deformation there's no poison from Satan in our lives when when that Trump sounds and the dead in Christ rise brothers and sisters that's a perfect body verse 53 for this corruptable this flesh this corruptable must put on in corruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that it is written death is swallowed up in Victory together and we'll be able to say it oh my something doesn't want me to speak these words here ah but I'm gonna choke them out oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ been with me this morning brothers and sisters there is a deformer and that's what this world is Satan's Eden there is a deformer marching through the land but there is also a Transformer [Music] there is a Transformer and you know that is Christ Our Hope of Glory we just have a prayer request here I'm going to stop because I don't think I have any more voice apologize um the neighbor

Father Lord Jesus this morning we thank you for your word we thank you Lord Jesus that even though there has been a deformer there is a Transformer father you've given us the ability to be transformed

that this family somehow through this this tragedy father would be able to come to know you in the power of your Resurrection father that Lord if they could believe then they and their family could be
