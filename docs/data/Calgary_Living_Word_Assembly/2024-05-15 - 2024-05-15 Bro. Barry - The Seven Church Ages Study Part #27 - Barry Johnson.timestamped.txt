[33:20] 2: 8- 11 as we continue our study with
[33:23] the exposition of the seven Church
[33:26] ages the Church
[33:29] age and then I'd like to turn over to
[33:31] First John chap
[33:34] 3 and I'll apologize in advance I'm
[33:37] probably going to have a lot of coughs
[33:39] here tonight but it's just the devil
[33:41] trying to get in the
[33:43] way and the more he tries the more we're
[33:46] GNA
[33:52] push excuse me Revelations chapter
[33:56] 2 verse 8
[33:59] sman Church age and unto the angel of
[34:01] the church in Smyrna write these things
[34:05] saith the first and the
[34:08] last which was dead and is alive I Know
[34:12] Thy works and thy tribulation and
[34:15] poverty but Thou Art
[34:17] rich and I know the blasphemy of them
[34:20] them which say they are Jews and are not
[34:23] but are the synagogue of Satan fear none
[34:27] of those things which Thou shalt suffer
[34:30] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[34:33] into prison that you may be tried and ye
[34:37] may have tribulation 10 days be thou
[34:40] faithful unto death and I will give thee
[34:44] a Crown of
[34:45] Life he that hath an ear let him hear
[34:49] what the spirit saith unto the
[34:51] churches he that overcometh shall not be
[34:54] hurt of the second death
[34:57] tremendous tremendous
[34:59] scripture now if you turn over to 1 John
[35:02] chapter 3 I don't know if we'll get this
[35:05] far tonight in the book Lord willing we
[35:08] will but I want to read the next few
[35:12] paragraphs uh probably towards the
[35:14] latter part of the
[35:15] service with this scripture in
[35:18] mind 1 John chapter 3 verse
[35:23] one it says behold what manner of love
[35:27] the father hath bestowed upon
[35:30] who that we should be called the sons of
[35:33] God
[35:34] Amen therefore the world knoweth us
[35:37] not because it knew him
[35:42] not verse two is just enough goodness
[35:47] beloved now are we the sons of
[35:51] God and it does not yet appear what we
[35:55] shall
[35:56] be but we know know that when he shall
[36:00] appear we shall be like
[36:03] him for we shall see him as he is let's
[36:08] just bow one more time Heavenly Father
[36:11] tonight Lord I pray that you would just
[36:13] break this scripture open to us father
[36:16] Lord not through theological teaching
[36:19] but through Revelation by your spirit
[36:21] Lord Jesus father that when we leave
[36:24] this building tonight perhaps we could
[36:26] look at one another we could look at
[36:28] ourselves even father and begin to see

[38:00] study of worship in the near future Lord
[38:02] willing and uh you know what we've got
[38:04] every single reason to Shout to the Lord
[38:07] every single reason and uh so anyways
[38:10] we're going to do that Lord willing on
[38:12] June
[38:14] 23rd we've got brother Cadre Diggs
[38:16] coming June
[38:17] 26th on the Wednesday I love it we've
[38:21] got brother Jack Duff coming Wednesday
[38:23] July the
[38:24] 12th and uh you know we'll just see what
[38:28] the Lord will do I know uh some folks
[38:32] maybe don't like it or get a little
[38:34] uneasy when there's too much Ministry
[38:35] coming through but you know when we're
[38:37] preaching the word for our day I think
[38:40] it's a real encouragement right God gave
[38:42] us a five-fold Ministry and that
[38:44] five-fold Ministry is what's supposed to
[38:46] perfect the Saints that's how God is
[38:48] going to create a Rapture in the people
[38:52] it's not going to be one Ministry and
[38:54] it's not going to be one tradition or
[38:56] one teaching or one Theory it's just
[38:59] going to be the the way God has out
[39:01] outlined so um I do believe though just
[39:05] for the record so in case anybody's
[39:07] wondering I'm going to pump the brakes
[39:09] if somebody else calls and says they are
[39:12] going to be in town I'm going to say
[39:14] common Fellowship but I think we're full
[39:17] we're not going to be having another
[39:19] Minister um now best laid plans right
[39:22] we'll see and we haven't talked about
[39:25] July July is already booking up in I
[39:27] think there's going to be a real good
[39:28] month in there we've got a real good old
[39:30] friend coming in the middle of July and
[39:32] I'm real excited about that so uh we'll
[39:35] see what happens you know uh I just
[39:38] think it's beautiful where we're picking
[39:41] up is paragraph 145 in uh in the red
[39:45] book here the exposition of the seven
[39:47] Church age talking about the saman
[39:49] church age you know uh where we left off
[39:52] last week I'll just pick up this
[39:53] paragraph here brother bradam says now
[39:55] before we leave this subject I want to
[39:57] make myself very clear on what the
[39:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is according
[40:02] to the word Now isn't that good we
[40:05] wouldn't want to have it according to
[40:06] any other thought any other Theory any
[40:09] other tradition we would only want it to
[40:11] be exactly according to the word
[40:13] wouldn't we it is not according to me
[40:16] and it's not according to you it's got
[40:19] to be according to thus sayith the Lord
[40:21] or we are falsely LED amen and we know
[40:25] that there's been many many false
[40:27] leaders that have gone out and tried to
[40:29] create a theory or an idea on what the
[40:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost is and I'm not
[40:33] even talking about denominations I'm
[40:35] just going to say around the message try
[40:37] to spin the message into a
[40:39] denominational teaching if you don't
[40:41] believe it the way we believe it then
[40:42] you're out that's not the spirit of
[40:44] Christ not at
[40:46] all it has to be thus saith the Lord and
[40:48] how is it thus sayith the lord it's
[40:50] exactly according to his
[40:51] word because we know that the prophet
[40:54] God in the prophet said that she has
[40:58] thus sayeth the Lord and the mind of
[41:02] Christ to know what to do with it and
[41:05] that's exactly in line with the word the
[41:07] word says let this mind that was in
[41:09] Christ be in
[41:11] who we don't have to fear paragraph 146
[41:15] it says to begin with you will notice
[41:17] that in my meetings when I have finished
[41:19] preaching an Evangelistic service or
[41:21] some teaching message I cast The Net to
[41:24] invite a response from the people I ask
[41:26] them to come forward and receive the
[41:28] Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon
[41:31] hearing me say this believe that I am
[41:32] inviting people to come forward to be
[41:34] baptized with the Holy Ghost because
[41:36] they are already born again so when I
[41:39] invite those who are Spirit-filled to
[41:41] come and deal with those who have
[41:43] answered the invitation to receive the
[41:45] spirit these dear ones surge forward and
[41:48] deal with the people in such a manner as
[41:50] to encourage them to yield to God and
[41:52] believe to speak in tongues this has
[41:55] caused a great deal of confusion and I
[41:57] want to tell you exactly what I mean
[42:01] now let's put it in the second gear and
[42:05] drop the
[42:06] clutch I mean for The Sinner to come
[42:09] forward and be born
[42:11] again which is to be baptized into the
[42:14] body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which
[42:19] is exactly what took place at Pentecost
[42:21] when the church was launched in other
[42:24] words to be born of the spirit is to be
[42:27] truly baptized with the Holy
[42:30] Ghost this is where it gets contentious
[42:32] for some because they want to have some
[42:34] kind of work some kind of ladder that
[42:36] they can climb some kind of Stairway or
[42:38] road map you can do and follow the
[42:41] leadership with prayers and and it's
[42:43] teaching of men teaching for doctrines
[42:45] the Commandments of men that's what that
[42:46] is this is what the prophet said this is
[42:48] what God Said through the prophet it is
[42:50] one and the same if we don't have the
[42:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and
[42:55] sisters I want to say this tonight we're
[42:56] not going to go in the Rapture that's
[42:58] the way it's going to work that's
[43:00] exactly according to the word of God
[43:02] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:03] we're not sealed but if we get the
[43:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost then we're
[43:06] sealed until the day of our
[43:11] Redemption paragraph 147 now I realize
[43:14] that this is going to be confusing for a
[43:15] moment here as most people know that I
[43:18] was ordained a Baptist preacher and I
[43:20] have steadfastly declared that Baptists
[43:23] have missed it for saying you received
[43:25] the Holy Ghost when you believe it's so
[43:29] treacherous because it's so close so
[43:34] close so
[43:36] close they've missed it for saying you
[43:39] receive the Holy Ghost when you believe
[43:42] for that is not so you receive him since
[43:46] you believe and just as usual once again
[43:48] we're going to go right back to the
[43:49] scripture to find the identification in
[43:51] that not just what brother brandham
[43:53] dreamt up not something that floated
[43:54] down out of Heaven some sort of teaching
[43:56] that he got out of a book somewhere from
[43:58] some other author this is the only
[44:00] author the only inspiration that drove
[44:03] this man and that's what captured my
[44:05] attention it just drew me in Acts 19:
[44:10] 2-6 and he said unto them have ye
[44:12] received the Holy Ghost since you
[44:15] believed not when you believed not
[44:17] because you believed since you believed
[44:20] and they said unto him we have not so
[44:21] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[44:23] Ghost and he said unto them unto what
[44:25] then were ye baptized and they said unto
[44:27] John's baptism then said Paul John
[44:30] verily baptized with the baptism of
[44:32] repentance saying unto the people that
[44:34] they should believe on him which should
[44:36] come after him that is on Jesus Christ
[44:39] when they heard this they were baptized
[44:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus and when
[44:43] Paul had laid his hands upon them the
[44:45] Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake
[44:48] with tongues and
[44:49] prophesied excuse
[44:54] me note they did not get
[44:57] baptized in water
[45:00] yet but because they were baptized with
[45:03] the Holy Ghost they actually came in
[45:06] accordance with the word of God and were
[45:08] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:11] Christ paragraph 148 he says there it is
[45:14] Paul asked have you received since not
[45:17] when you believed and there is a great
[45:20] difference there for it is after we
[45:23] believe that we receive Ephesians 1:13
[45:27] is an exact word repeat of what happened
[45:29] in Ephesus according to Acts 19
[45:32] Ephesians 1:13 in whom ye also trusted
[45:36] after that ye heard the word of Truth
[45:39] The Gospel of your salvation in whom
[45:42] also after that ye believed not when ye
[45:47] believed ye were sealed with that Holy
[45:50] Spirit of
[45:52] promise now here is my point too many of
[45:55] our modernists and even our
[45:57] fundamentalists so-called believe unto
[46:01] salvation at a certain specific
[46:04] time which in many cases is called
[46:07] making a decision and that has been
[46:10] called receiving Christ or being born
[46:14] again now to receive Christ is to
[46:17] receive his
[46:19] Spirit not just say I receive Christ and
[46:24] you know what the identification is
[46:25] you're going to go out and you're going
[46:26] to live the the word that's it's that
[46:28] simple we're going to say I'm going to
[46:31] live the word and and if we were to say
[46:33] that on our own no one would ever do it
[46:36] and in fact that's what causes a great
[46:37] Falling Away amongst the young people
[46:39] let's be honest that's what they do they
[46:42] say I'm going to I'm going to accept
[46:44] Christ I'm going to make a stand for him
[46:45] and I'm going to go and live and and
[46:47] they know the scriptures because they've
[46:49] heard them at home but for some reason
[46:51] they can't go and live those scriptures
[46:53] and the only reason is there's no human
[46:55] that's going to live this
[46:58] scripture No human at all the only
[47:01] person the only way you could ever live
[47:03] this scripture is to let him live it
[47:05] through
[47:06] you and when he comes to town look out
[47:09] brothers and sisters that's when this
[47:10] flesh gets in line that's when we become
[47:12] subject to it that's when we can pray
[47:14] Lord you know what if you're going to
[47:15] preach tonight and you're going to take
[47:17] the hide office if you're going to bring
[47:19] correction to us then amen because I
[47:21] want to be corrected I don't want to be
[47:23] corrected according to what brother
[47:24] Barry would bring I don't want to be
[47:26] corrected Accord to what some other
[47:27] Theologian might try and bring I want to
[47:29] be corrected according to the word of
[47:31] God I want the word of God to reign
[47:34] supreme in my life and when that happens
[47:37] look
[47:38] out Satan doesn't know what to do with
[47:41] us so let's carry on here now here is my
[47:45] point he says too many of our modernists
[47:47] even our fundamentalists so-called
[47:49] believe on a Salvation at a certain
[47:50] specific time in which many cases it's
[47:52] called making a decision and that has
[47:54] been called receiving Christ or being
[47:56] born again now to receive Christ is to
[47:58] receive his Spirit to receive his spirit
[48:00] is to be born again to receive his
[48:02] spirit is to be baptized with the Holy
[48:05] Ghost
[48:06] amen these folks believe that is
[48:09] wonderful but they stop there brothers
[48:12] and sisters don't stop keep going say
[48:15] Lord be it unto me if I need correction
[48:18] then correct me as a little child I want
[48:21] to be subject to your correction amen he
[48:25] says you receive the Holy Ghost after
[48:27] you believe it has always been that way
[48:29] and always will be the very first word
[48:32] of direction to the people was by Peter
[48:34] at Pentecost and he said repent and be
[48:37] baptized every one of you in the name of
[48:39] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[48:41] and you shall receive the gift of the
[48:43] Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you
[48:46] and to your children and all that are
[48:47] AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God
[48:50] shall call acts
[48:52] 23839 these directions came as a direct
[48:55] answer from Peter
[48:57] relative to what had actually happened
[48:59] at Pentecost it's the same pattern the
[49:02] same direction it's nothing different
[49:05] what came to pass was that God according
[49:06] to Joel was SP pouring out the promised
[49:10] Holy Spirit upon All Flesh and it's so
[49:14] beautiful because that Spirit poured out
[49:16] on All Flesh causes All Flesh to
[49:19] manifest what life is inside of it he
[49:22] was not poured out before that time or
[49:24] given before that time that was it but
[49:27] this was to come from now on by
[49:30] repenting being baptized in the name of
[49:33] the Lord Jesus Christ and then God was
[49:36] Duty bound to fill the ones who
[49:40] came isn't it interesting that we can
[49:43] cause God to be Duty bound Hallelujah
[49:47] the only way that we can do that is by
[49:48] his word if we're willing to come
[49:50] according to his word then he's willing
[49:52] to say whoa they've actually pushed
[49:55] aside everything they' for Aken all and
[49:58] taken
[50:02] me this was it but this was to come from
[50:05] now on by repenting being baptized in
[50:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[50:09] God was Duty bound to fill the ones who
[50:11] came Peter or any of the Apostles never
[50:13] said he must be born again and then
[50:15] filled with the
[50:17] spirit that this is the pattern of
[50:20] experience relative to receiving the
[50:22] Holy Spirit note carefully the very next
[50:25] time that the Spirit fell upon the
[50:29] people excuse me then Philip went down
[50:33] to the city of Samaria and preached
[50:35] Christ unto
[50:37] them and the people with one Accord gave
[50:40] heed unto those things which Philip
[50:43] spake hearing and seeing the Miracles
[50:46] which he did for unclean spirits crying
[50:50] with a loud voice came out of many that
[50:53] were possessed with them and many taken
[50:55] with palsies and and that were lame were
[50:58] healed and there was great joy in that
[51:00] City but there was a certain man called
[51:02] Simon which Before Time in the same city
[51:05] used sorcery and bewitched the people of
[51:08] Samaria giving out that himself was some
[51:12] great
[51:12] one to whom they all gave heed from the
[51:16] least to the greatest saying this man is
[51:19] the great power of God and to him they
[51:23] had regard because of that long time he
[51:25] had Bewitched them with
[51:28] sorceries but but when they believed
[51:32] Phillip preaching the things concerning
[51:34] the kingdom of God and in the name of
[51:36] Jesus Christ they were baptized both men
[51:40] and women it's beautiful it doesn't say
[51:41] they were baptized in the name of the
[51:43] father and of the son and of the Holy
[51:45] Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ why
[51:47] wouldn't it say that why wouldn't it say
[51:48] titles there I wonder then Simon himself
[51:52] believed also and when he was baptized
[51:54] he continued with Phillip and wondered
[51:57] beholding the Miracles and signs which
[51:59] were done now when the apostles which
[52:01] were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[52:03] received the word of God they sent unto
[52:06] them Peter and John who when they C were
[52:10] come down prayed for them that they
[52:12] might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet
[52:15] he was Fallen upon none of them only
[52:18] they were baptized in the name of the
[52:21] Lord
[52:23] Jesus then they laid hands on them and
[52:26] they Reed received the Holy
[52:28] Ghost that's acts 85-1
[52:31] 17 according to verse 12 they believed
[52:34] the
[52:35] word they were then baptized in the name
[52:37] of the Lord Jesus but according to verse
[52:39] 16 in spite of all that they had still
[52:42] not received the Holy Spirit it was only
[52:45] after believing and being baptized
[52:47] correctly that they received the Holy
[52:50] Ghost that is the exact pattern set
[52:53] forth by Peter in Acts 23839
[52:56] another scripture that cast a wondrous
[52:58] light on this is found in Galatians 3:
[53:00] 13- 14 Christ hath redeemed us from the
[53:04] curse of the law being made a curse for
[53:07] us for it is written cursed is everyone
[53:10] that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing
[53:12] of Abraham might come on the
[53:15] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that in
[53:18] order that we might receive the promise
[53:20] of the spirit through
[53:23] faith Now by no means can it be said the
[53:25] blessing of Abraham is the
[53:28] rebirth and that the promise of the
[53:30] spirit is the baptism with the Holy
[53:32] Ghost as two separate events I love this
[53:37] for the scripture reads thus Jesus died
[53:39] on the cross and by means of that death
[53:41] and Resurrection The Blessing of Abraham
[53:44] came on the Gentiles leaving the Jews
[53:48] this transpired in order that the spirit
[53:50] might become available to the
[53:52] Gentiles to understand what I have just
[53:55] said is to clear up Why students have
[53:58] never found Paul saying at any time be
[54:01] born again and then be spirit filled
[54:05] they have inferred it is there many
[54:09] times I think there's a lot of
[54:10] inferences around the word of God isn't
[54:13] there they have inferred it is there and
[54:16] they have put their own meanings to make
[54:19] it say it but scripture does not say
[54:22] that that's in capitals isn't it yeah
[54:26] scripture does not say that Jesus never
[54:30] said it either look at John 7:37 to39
[54:33] and read it now with understanding in
[54:36] the last day that great day of the feast
[54:38] Jesus stood and said If any man thirst
[54:41] let him come unto me and
[54:42] drink he that believeth on me as the
[54:44] scripture hath said out of his belly
[54:47] shall flow flow rivers of Living
[54:50] Water but this spake he of the spirit
[54:55] which they that believe on him should
[54:57] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[55:00] given because that Jesus was not yet
[55:05] glorified now it says here distinctly
[55:07] and emphatically that the believer upon
[55:10] drinking by coming unto Jesus in faith
[55:13] would have rivers of Living Waters
[55:15] pouring out of him and it places this
[55:17] experience at Pentecost now keep this
[55:21] thought in mind we read keep sorry now
[55:24] keeping this thought in mind we read in
[55:26] John four if thou knewest the gift of
[55:28] God and who it is that saith to thee
[55:31] give me to drink thou would have asked
[55:34] him and he would have given thee living
[55:36] water but who so drinketh of the water
[55:39] that I shall give him shall never thirst
[55:42] but the water that I shall give him
[55:46] shall be in him a well of water
[55:49] springing up into everlasting life isn't
[55:53] it interesting how brother bradam talks
[55:55] about the artisian in Wells and if
[55:57] you've ever seen one before it's just an
[55:59] amazing thing to witness how it just
[56:02] continually bubbles out of the ground it
[56:04] just bubbles bubbles bubbles and it's
[56:06] the sweetest cleanest water that you'll
[56:08] ever see paragraph 156 the same living
[56:12] water is mentioned but this time it is
[56:14] not called a river it's called an
[56:16] artisian well there is where the people
[56:19] make their mistake because it's called a
[56:22] well and a river they think that in one
[56:25] place it is eternal life given by the
[56:27] spirit and in the next place where it is
[56:29] called a river implying a great
[56:32] dynamism it has to be the spirit now
[56:35] given as an enduement of power not so it
[56:40] is one and the same it is the spirit
[56:45] that gives life and power and that came
[56:48] at
[56:50] Pentecost what is it that caused this
[56:52] misunderstanding the answer is
[56:55] experience amen this is so good and Rich
[56:58] Brothers and Sisters I think it's so
[56:59] important especially when it's weaved in
[57:01] and through the message of the hour
[57:03] because we can have prayers we can have
[57:06] situations where people have needs great
[57:08] needs in their lives and we pray for
[57:10] them and God answers those prayers every
[57:12] single time God answers prayers
[57:14] sometimes he doesn't answer the prayers
[57:15] the way we want them to be answered
[57:16] naturally speaking and that can cause
[57:19] great confusion because we're not
[57:20] experiencing according to the word of
[57:22] God maybe what we think we should
[57:24] because we believe
[57:26] but that doesn't change whether people
[57:28] believe or not and that's the evidence
[57:30] of having the Holy Ghost in our lives
[57:32] but we cannot base our experience in the
[57:35] word our experience with the Holy Ghost
[57:37] in our lives on whether we have
[57:39] experience or not the experience will
[57:43] follow brother Ram says what is it the
[57:45] cause the misunderstanding the the
[57:47] answer is experience we have gone by
[57:50] experience and not the word away with
[57:54] experience as your measuring line amen
[57:57] there is only one Plum line one rod and
[58:00] that is the word now watch carefully and
[58:03] get this Peter said repent and be
[58:05] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[58:08] the remission of sin and ye shall
[58:10] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul
[58:13] said have ye received the Holy Ghost
[58:15] since ye
[58:16] believed this is the whole of our
[58:19] problem right here people repent of
[58:21] their sins and they get baptized in
[58:22] water but they don't go
[58:24] on and and but they don't go on and
[58:29] receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto
[58:33] receiving the spirit believe on Jesus
[58:36] Believing on Jesus is the step in the
[58:39] right direction which is toward the Holy
[58:41] Ghost but the people stop there they go
[58:45] as far as water and then stop they
[58:47] believe and then stop the Bible does not
[58:51] say that you receive when you believe it
[58:55] is have received the Holy Ghost since
[58:58] you believed the exact and literal
[59:01] translation is did ye having previously
[59:04] believed received the Holy
[59:07] Ghost I love this I want to say
[59:11] Amen the people believe and then stop
[59:14] you don't receive the Holy Ghost when
[59:15] you believe unto him having repented you
[59:19] go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you
[59:23] see it that is what is wrong with our
[59:26] fundamentalists they have no power for
[59:29] they stop short of
[59:31] Pentecost now brothers and sisters this
[59:33] is where I think it gets real good and
[59:35] Rich and I saying I keep saying it I
[59:38] just can't help it but you know uh maybe
[59:40] on Sunday we'll bring some quotes that
[59:41] speak to this Pentecost is not a
[59:44] denomination we all would say Amen to
[59:46] that it's an
[59:49] experience now I want to say this how
[59:52] many people are not afraid to get
[59:54] Pentecostal because they've had an
[59:57] experience how many people are not
[59:59] afraid to grab the tambourine and go up
[1:00:01] and down the banks of the sea knowing
[1:00:04] that God has destroyed their enemy
[1:00:06] behind them the enemy has no more power
[1:00:09] over that person because they believed
[1:00:12] unto receiving and since they've
[1:00:15] received the Holy Ghost in their life
[1:00:17] there's nothing going to stop them
[1:00:18] doesn't matter what anybody says doesn't
[1:00:20] matter what anybody preaches they have a
[1:00:22] personal relationship with the king of
[1:00:25] kings and Lord of Lords brothers and
[1:00:27] sisters don't be afraid Pentecost is an
[1:00:30] experience and because you have an
[1:00:32] experience it doesn't mean that you are
[1:00:34] in a
[1:00:35] denomination in fact it's the other way
[1:00:37] when you get
[1:00:39] denominationally
[1:00:41] cold look
[1:00:44] out brother bradam says if you got no
[1:00:47] emotion in your religion you better bury
[1:00:50] it don't be afraid to shout amen blessed
[1:00:54] be the name of the Lord the devil's
[1:00:56] going to come around and say no don't
[1:00:58] stand up no you're going to stand out if
[1:00:59] you stand up don't do that no don't
[1:01:02] raise your hands no don't shout don't do
[1:01:04] it they're going to think you're crazy
[1:01:06] they're going to think you're a
[1:01:07] fundamentalist don't do that take a look
[1:01:10] at Pentecost the day of Pentecost they
[1:01:12] stumbled out of the building that they
[1:01:14] were hiding in because they were
[1:01:16] afraid like drunk people like
[1:01:20] drunks how many of us behave like drunks
[1:01:23] hey he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:24] forever brothers and sisters
[1:01:26] he's not going to be different today
[1:01:28] than he was then we're different today
[1:01:31] we've been taught that we need to sit
[1:01:32] still we have to have church order but
[1:01:35] when God's speaking to us say amen and
[1:01:38] the more you say Amen the more he's
[1:01:40] going to
[1:01:43] speak this just gets me going this just
[1:01:45] gets me excited because it's the truth I
[1:01:47] I just believe it with all my heart
[1:01:49] brothers and sisters don't just go as
[1:01:50] far as water and stop keep going Amen
[1:01:55] brother
[1:01:58] he goes on to say oh I wonder if I'll
[1:02:01] have a voice at the end of this I just
[1:02:03] want to pour it out I just want to lose
[1:02:05] it whatever that's fine they'll give me
[1:02:07] something for Sunday they are like the
[1:02:10] children of Israel who came out of Egypt
[1:02:12] and stop short of the promised land oh
[1:02:15] no help us there's Giants over there
[1:02:18] yeah I can taste that honey it's so
[1:02:20] sweet but I'll never get to it because
[1:02:23] there's Giants there and and those
[1:02:25] pomegranates are so so sweet and so big
[1:02:30] and so
[1:02:31] juicy oh but the the Giants own those
[1:02:35] and the figs have you ever seen such
[1:02:38] good figs you could smell them blocks
[1:02:40] away those figs are so good but we can
[1:02:44] never do it but there was two there was
[1:02:48] two that were of another Spirit brothers
[1:02:50] and
[1:02:51] sisters and those two were the only ones
[1:02:54] and remember the ones that were SA and
[1:02:56] we can't do it we're the Valiant ones
[1:02:59] they were the teachers and the preachers
[1:03:01] of the bunch they were the ones that
[1:03:03] should have been saying it and it should
[1:03:05] have been the other two saying no I
[1:03:07] don't know it's a little bit weird maybe
[1:03:09] we won't be able to do it but there was
[1:03:11] only two that were able to say you know
[1:03:13] what it doesn't matter what we see with
[1:03:15] our eyes it doesn't matter what we hear
[1:03:16] with our ears doesn't matter what we
[1:03:18] feel with our feelings those
[1:03:21] those they're grasshoppers in our sight
[1:03:24] because we've got God with us they are
[1:03:27] like the children of Israel who came out
[1:03:28] of Egypt and stopped short of the
[1:03:30] promised land now those children of
[1:03:32] Israel left Egypt about two million
[1:03:34] strong they all journeyed together all
[1:03:37] saw same miracles of god all partook of
[1:03:39] the same mana and water from the smitten
[1:03:43] Rock and followed the same Cloud by day
[1:03:46] and the pillar of Fire by night but were
[1:03:48] only two reached the promised land only
[1:03:51] two were true or real believers
[1:03:56] my
[1:03:57] goodness while I was studying this out I
[1:03:59] was thinking you know what was the
[1:04:00] difference between those two and and all
[1:04:03] the rest of them and we know it was the
[1:04:05] spirit but how did it manifest that's
[1:04:07] what I want to get to and you know what
[1:04:09] came to my mind immediately I believe it
[1:04:11] was the Lord speaking to me it was the
[1:04:12] murmurings murmur murmurings murmuring
[1:04:15] against God murmuring against Moses
[1:04:17] murmuring about the conditions murmuring
[1:04:19] murmuring murmuring problems issues blah
[1:04:22] blah blah blah blah murmurings are we
[1:04:24] murmuring brothers and and sisters
[1:04:26] because if we are it's the same spirit
[1:04:28] that was afflicting those people yes sir
[1:04:31] because if God's in control God's in
[1:04:33] control no if he's not in control even
[1:04:35] just a little bit he's not
[1:04:39] God the devil gets in our way he wants
[1:04:42] us to murmur he wants us to start
[1:04:44] murmuring and remember we're not
[1:04:46] murmuring about our brother and our
[1:04:47] sister and our pastor and our deacons
[1:04:49] and whatever we're not murmuring about
[1:04:51] them when we're murmuring we're
[1:04:52] murmuring about God we need to be very
[1:04:54] cautious
[1:04:57] that is correct because the word tells
[1:04:59] us that the rest died because of
[1:05:01] unbelief and because of unbelief they
[1:05:03] could not enter into Hebrews
[1:05:06] 3:19 then since that is so and only to
[1:05:11] entered then the rest were not true
[1:05:14] believers what made the difference two
[1:05:18] stayed with the word we're talking about
[1:05:21] this today on the phone and I thought it
[1:05:22] was so good people say oh you're just
[1:05:24] parting the prophet I say
[1:05:26] amen hallelujah if there's anything to
[1:05:28] say brothers and sisters say what the
[1:05:30] prophet said stay with what he said and
[1:05:34] actually apply that in our homes and our
[1:05:36] lives because that's what Joshua and
[1:05:38] Caleb did isn't
[1:05:41] it stayed with the
[1:05:43] word when the hearts of the 10 spies
[1:05:46] failed at kades barnea Joshua and Caleb
[1:05:49] did not stagger for they believed the
[1:05:51] word and said we are more than able to
[1:05:54] take the land they saw the same
[1:05:56] circumstances they saw the same Giants
[1:05:59] they saw all the pitfalls they saw all
[1:06:01] the problems and
[1:06:02] weapons but they were willing to take
[1:06:05] the word over top of the circumstances
[1:06:07] over top of the situations brothers and
[1:06:09] sisters look at the
[1:06:11] word keep your eyes on
[1:06:14] Jesus they knew that they could because
[1:06:18] God had said so I have given you the
[1:06:22] land after all those Israelites saw all
[1:06:25] the power and goodness and deliverance
[1:06:27] of
[1:06:28] God they did not enter into rest which
[1:06:32] is a type of Holy Ghost so you can see
[1:06:35] right now that very few will ever
[1:06:38] believe all the way to receiving the
[1:06:40] spirit of God I think brothers and
[1:06:42] sisters if we have been able to receive
[1:06:44] the spirit of God I I really believe
[1:06:46] this with all my heart there should be
[1:06:47] no problem just worshiping God just I
[1:06:50] mean really worshiping God not caring
[1:06:52] about who's around not caring about
[1:06:54] what's happening after words I'm going
[1:06:56] to really go off on worship in the
[1:06:58] future here but I'm serious there should
[1:07:00] be nothing inhibiting us from worshiping
[1:07:03] him because we're coming to a day we've
[1:07:04] said it before where that's all we've
[1:07:06] got that's all we're going to do we're
[1:07:09] going to go worship God
[1:07:11] forever now the devil's going to say oh
[1:07:13] man that's going to be boring sitting on
[1:07:15] a cloud just worshiping God just going
[1:07:18] to church every single minute of every
[1:07:20] single day that's what the devil's going
[1:07:22] to teach us but you know what there was
[1:07:24] a time where the morning Stars sang
[1:07:26] together right and the sons of God they
[1:07:29] shouted for joy and I think as we get
[1:07:32] closer and closer those sons of God are
[1:07:35] beginning to manifest as we read tonight
[1:07:37] behold what manner of love the father
[1:07:38] hath bestowed upon us brothers and
[1:07:40] sisters that we should be called what
[1:07:42] the sons of God oh my like Adam we
[1:07:45] should be called the same category as
[1:07:47] Adam was when he was created and placed
[1:07:49] in the garden remember what the prophet
[1:07:51] said remember God said to you the
[1:07:52] prophet all that Adam lost right has
[1:07:55] been restored for those people that have
[1:07:58] this spirit that we're talking about
[1:07:59] tonight I think it's so beautiful they
[1:08:01] knew that they could because God had
[1:08:03] said I have given you the land after all
[1:08:05] those Israelites saw the power and
[1:08:07] goodness and deliverance of God they did
[1:08:08] not enter into rest which is a type of
[1:08:10] the Holy Ghost so you can see right now
[1:08:12] that very few people will believe all
[1:08:14] the way to receiving of the spirit of
[1:08:16] God all right we have come this far now
[1:08:18] I want to go further so do I and when I
[1:08:21] do I know I'm going to cause some
[1:08:23] emotions to rise but but that is
[1:08:25] something I am not responsible for I am
[1:08:28] responsible to God and his word and the
[1:08:31] people of God has sent me to I have to
[1:08:33] be faithful in all he gives me to say
[1:08:35] John 637 and44 all the father hath given
[1:08:40] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[1:08:42] to me I shall in no wise cast out no man
[1:08:46] can come unto me come to me except the
[1:08:48] father draw him and I will raise him up
[1:08:52] at the last day John 1:12 to13
[1:08:56] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:08:58] he power to become the sons of God even
[1:09:01] to them that believe on his name which
[1:09:03] were born not of blood nor the will of
[1:09:05] the flesh nor of the will of man oh my
[1:09:08] but of God Ephesians 1 14 to 5 according
[1:09:13] as he hath chosen Us in him before the
[1:09:14] foundation of the world that we should
[1:09:16] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:09:19] love if that's the way we are brothers
[1:09:21] and sisters then what have we got to
[1:09:23] fear having destinated us unto the
[1:09:26] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:09:29] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:09:32] of his
[1:09:33] will beautiful now without getting too
[1:09:36] involved in the subject of sovereignty
[1:09:38] of God for that would take a book in
[1:09:40] itself let me point out here that
[1:09:43] according to these verses Jesus Christ
[1:09:45] is choosing his own bride just the same
[1:09:47] as men chose their Brides today the
[1:09:50] bride today does not simply decide she's
[1:09:53] going to take a certain man for a
[1:09:55] husband
[1:09:58] no sir it is the groom whom decides and
[1:10:02] chooses a certain woman for his bride ye
[1:10:05] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[1:10:07] John
[1:10:08] 1516 now according to the word of God
[1:10:10] the bride was chosen before the
[1:10:12] foundation of the world this choosing of
[1:10:15] the bride was purposed in himself
[1:10:17] Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9911 it says
[1:10:20] the purpose that the purpose of God
[1:10:23] according to election might stand and
[1:10:25] you can't read it any other way the
[1:10:28] heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God
[1:10:30] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[1:10:34] and that purpose was in himself and
[1:10:36] being Eternal was decreed before the
[1:10:39] foundation of the
[1:10:41] world watch carefully now and see this
[1:10:45] before there was ever a speck of
[1:10:48] Stardust before God was God God is an
[1:10:51] object of adoration and no one was there
[1:10:55] to worship him so he was at that time
[1:10:59] only potentially God and he was known
[1:11:02] only as eternal
[1:11:05] spirit the bride was already in his mind
[1:11:10] Hallelujah we sing that song when he was
[1:11:13] on the cross I was on his mind I want to
[1:11:16] say there's probably a whole bunch of
[1:11:19] unwise virgins that sing that song and
[1:11:21] that's as far back as they go because
[1:11:23] they can't go any further back but
[1:11:25] there's a bunch of people also that can
[1:11:27] say Amen to this to recognize that
[1:11:30] before the world ever was before there
[1:11:32] even was a speck of Stardust we were in
[1:11:35] his
[1:11:37] mind
[1:11:38] my he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:11:42] the bride was already in his mind yes
[1:11:44] she was she was existing in his thoughts
[1:11:46] and what about those thoughts of
[1:11:49] God they are Eternal are they not the
[1:11:53] Eternal thoughts of God now I just can't
[1:11:56] help but stop here for a second and just
[1:11:58] throw off a little bit on the devil did
[1:12:00] you ever think not not in terms of how
[1:12:03] powerful he is and how he's created
[1:12:04] coequal with God and how he was the the
[1:12:07] the morning the son H I'm going to say
[1:12:10] it wrong how he was there at the right
[1:12:11] hand of God in God's glory how even has
[1:12:15] access to the throne right now to accuse
[1:12:17] the Brethren this one Satan who every
[1:12:20] one of us are going to look upon by the
[1:12:21] way on the side of the pit and say
[1:12:23] you're the one that troubled the Nations
[1:12:27] you he was not Eternal he's not an
[1:12:30] eternal being and he desires to be an
[1:12:33] eternal being but he will never ever
[1:12:35] have the position that you have tonight
[1:12:37] brothers and
[1:12:39] sisters that's why he's howling because
[1:12:42] he can't touch it he cannot touch you if
[1:12:45] you are Eternal if you are in God's
[1:12:48] thoughts before there was ever start us
[1:12:50] oh my Satan doesn't even have a chance
[1:12:52] it's not even fair what our position is
[1:12:56] the Eternal thoughts of God look at that
[1:12:58] in the mirror in the morning and say
[1:13:00] that the Eternal thoughts of God right
[1:13:02] there the Eternal thoughts of God let me
[1:13:05] ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:13:08] if you can see this you will see many
[1:13:11] things God is unchangeable in both
[1:13:13] Essence and
[1:13:16] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:13:19] that already God is infinite in his
[1:13:21] inabilities and so therefore he as God
[1:13:23] must be omniscient if he is omniscient
[1:13:27] then he is not now learning nor is he
[1:13:30] taking counsel even with himself nor is
[1:13:33] he at any time adding to his
[1:13:35] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[1:13:38] then he is not omniscient the best way
[1:13:40] we could say that is sometime he will be
[1:13:43] but that is not scriptural he is
[1:13:46] omniscient he has never had a new
[1:13:48] thought about anything because all of
[1:13:50] his thoughts he has always had and
[1:13:53] always will have and knows the end from
[1:13:56] the beginning because he's
[1:13:59] God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:14:03] they are real and the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ is his real Eternal thoughts
[1:14:09] being manifest to this
[1:14:12] age they are not simply like a man with
[1:14:15] a blueprint he has drawn up which one
[1:14:17] day will be translated into substance
[1:14:19] and form but they are already real and
[1:14:22] eternal and part of God
[1:14:25] see how this works God always had his
[1:14:28] thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts
[1:14:31] was yet unexpressed Psalms 139:15 to16
[1:14:35] will give you a little idea of this my
[1:14:37] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:14:39] was made in secret and curiously wrought
[1:14:42] in the lowest parts of the earth Thine
[1:14:44] Eyes did see my substance yet being
[1:14:47] unperfect and in thy book were all my
[1:14:51] members written which in continuance
[1:14:54] were fashion
[1:14:55] when as yet there was none of
[1:14:57] them that as I said was not written
[1:15:01] about Adam but it gives you the idea a
[1:15:03] knowledge that the thought was there in
[1:15:06] his
[1:15:08] mind and that thought was eternal and he
[1:15:12] had and had to be
[1:15:14] expressed so when Adam was formed in the
[1:15:17] dust of the earth and his spiritual
[1:15:19] being created by God then Adam became
[1:15:22] God's thought expressed
[1:15:26] those Eternal thoughts were now
[1:15:29] manifested just want to pause there it's
[1:15:31] so beautiful we are those Eternal
[1:15:35] thoughts of God being manifested
[1:15:37] brothers and sisters don't ever discount
[1:15:40] who you are when the devil tries to make
[1:15:42] you feel like you messed up because you
[1:15:44] did mess up you said that you did that
[1:15:46] you went there you looked at whatever it
[1:15:48] is it doesn't matter because you are an
[1:15:51] eternal thought of God and the devil
[1:15:53] can't change that and he only
[1:15:55] he was an eternal thought of God but he
[1:15:57] was a thought of God that was to be
[1:16:02] destroyed and I'll say it this way I
[1:16:04] said was but is a thought of God to be
[1:16:08] destroyed my goodness isn't this Rich
[1:16:12] all right down through the centuries we
[1:16:15] could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a
[1:16:18] John the Baptist and each one of these
[1:16:19] were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in
[1:16:22] its season then we come to Jesus the
[1:16:25] logos he was the perfect and complete
[1:16:28] thought
[1:16:30] expressed and he became known as the
[1:16:33] word that is what he is and forever will
[1:16:38] be now it says that he hath
[1:16:43] chosen in him chosen Us in him Jesus
[1:16:48] before the foundation of the world that
[1:16:50] means that we were right there with him
[1:16:53] in the mind and thoughts of God before
[1:16:56] the foundation of the world that gives
[1:16:58] an eternal quality to the elect you
[1:17:02] can't get away from that
[1:17:04] Hallelujah
[1:17:05] why it just causes such a humility man
[1:17:09] doesn't make us say I've got better
[1:17:10] thoughts I've got better thinking I've
[1:17:12] got better reasoning I've got better
[1:17:14] better better anything what I've got is
[1:17:16] nothing because it's all him he's done
[1:17:19] it all from the very
[1:17:22] beginning let me inject a here even our
[1:17:25] natural birth is based upon election the
[1:17:28] female ovaries produce many many eggs
[1:17:31] but why is it that a certain time a
[1:17:33] certain eggs come down egg comes down
[1:17:37] and not another one and then amongst the
[1:17:38] male sperm down and not another sorry
[1:17:42] and then yeah okay sorry and then
[1:17:44] amongst the male sperm for no known
[1:17:46] reason a certain germ attaches itself to
[1:17:49] the egg while the others that could have
[1:17:51] just as easily attached themselves or
[1:17:54] had better opport opportunity to do so
[1:17:56] did not do so and
[1:17:59] perished there is an intelligence behind
[1:18:01] all
[1:18:03] this otherwise what determines whether
[1:18:06] the baby is a boy girl blonde brunette
[1:18:09] light or dark type of eyes
[1:18:12] Etc with these thoughts in mind think
[1:18:14] about Joshua and
[1:18:16] Caleb did not Jesus say in John 4 6:49
[1:18:20] your fathers did eat Manor in the
[1:18:22] wilderness and are dead those parents
[1:18:24] that died were necessary as the
[1:18:27] forefathers of the people to whom Jesus
[1:18:30] was speaking they perished yet they were
[1:18:34] in the election of God naturally as
[1:18:35] Joshua and Caleb were
[1:18:39] spiritually there's people that are
[1:18:42] naturally in
[1:18:43] election to not be saved that's why
[1:18:46] brothers and sisters if we were to look
[1:18:48] around and see the people and be able to
[1:18:50] identify which ones are and which ones
[1:18:52] aren't and and we as human beings we
[1:18:54] don't have that ability by the way that
[1:18:57] is not our ability that's not our job
[1:19:00] that's God's job and that's his ability
[1:19:02] amen it's our job and our ability to
[1:19:04] treat everyone as though they are to
[1:19:07] show everyone Christ in this age so that
[1:19:10] all that are his will come they will be
[1:19:13] able to witness Jesus Christ alive on
[1:19:18] Earth it's amazing when you think about
[1:19:20] this they perished yet they were in the
[1:19:23] election of God naturally as Joshua and
[1:19:25] Caleb were spiritually but go on these
[1:19:27] elect were not only Eternal thoughts of
[1:19:29] God which were ex were to be expressed
[1:19:31] in the flesh in their due season but
[1:19:33] these same elect are called by another
[1:19:36] name Romans 4:16 therefore it is a faith
[1:19:40] that it might be of grace to the end the
[1:19:43] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:19:47] remember we talked about this not seeds
[1:19:49] it's not plural not to that only which
[1:19:52] is of the law but to that also which is
[1:19:55] of the faith of Abraham who is the
[1:19:58] father of us all now how many of us
[1:20:01] could say Abraham is our father none of
[1:20:04] us we're not talking about natural we're
[1:20:06] talking spiritual here brothers and
[1:20:09] sisters now this is Romans 9:7 to13
[1:20:13] neither because they are the Seed of
[1:20:15] Abraham are they all children but in
[1:20:17] Isaac shall thy seed be called because
[1:20:20] we know that Abraham he had two sons
[1:20:21] didn't he now we're going to get into it
[1:20:23] that's it that is they which are the
[1:20:26] children of the flesh these are not the
[1:20:30] children of God remember those who live
[1:20:32] after the flesh do what they die after
[1:20:34] the Flesh and if we walk not after the
[1:20:37] flesh but of the spirit
[1:20:40] right but the children of the promise
[1:20:42] are counted for the seed for This Is The
[1:20:44] Word of Promise at this time will I come
[1:20:47] and Sarah shall also have a son and not
[1:20:50] only this but when Rebecca had also
[1:20:51] conceived by one even our father Isaac
[1:20:55] for the children being not yet born
[1:20:58] neither having done any good or evil
[1:21:01] this eliminates Works brothers and
[1:21:02] sisters right here in this one scripture
[1:21:04] neither having done good or evil that
[1:21:07] the purpose of God according to election
[1:21:09] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:21:12] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[1:21:15] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[1:21:17] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[1:21:21] and remember when Brother D David Dean
[1:21:23] har was here he said that that older
[1:21:24] one's got to die that old man has got to
[1:21:27] die so that the younger can actually
[1:21:29] rise up and live out through us that
[1:21:31] younger one being the spirit of Christ
[1:21:33] of course Galatians 3:16 to
[1:21:36] 29 16 and 29 sorry now to Abraham and
[1:21:40] his seed were the promises made he saith
[1:21:44] not and to the seeds as of many but as
[1:21:46] of one and to thy seed which is Christ
[1:21:50] and if ye be Christ then ye are
[1:21:52] Abraham's seed and HS according to the
[1:21:56] promise my we made it this is where I
[1:22:00] wanted to get to tonight the cresendo is
[1:22:04] that how you say
[1:22:06] it you know brothers and sisters I just
[1:22:08] got a little quote I'm going to throw in
[1:22:11] here if we want to know that we
[1:22:14] know that we know some of the stuff that
[1:22:17] we've talked about tonight it can sound
[1:22:19] really almost frightening because some
[1:22:21] people are called and some people aren't
[1:22:24] and and all of the talk about you get
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost since you believed and
[1:22:28] and is there a time between when you
[1:22:30] believe that you actually get the Holy
[1:22:32] Ghost in your life you know brothers and
[1:22:33] sisters if you don't know whether you
[1:22:35] got the holy ghost in your life and you
[1:22:36] want the holy ghost in your life all you
[1:22:38] got to do is ask God but he's not just
[1:22:40] going to say you can just have the Holy
[1:22:42] Ghost just no problem willy-nilly have
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost and everyone can just
[1:22:46] have the Holy Ghost you want the Holy
[1:22:47] Ghost we'll just give the Holy Ghost
[1:22:48] even though that's what he does but he
[1:22:50] doesn't do it willy-nilly he only gives
[1:22:52] it to the elect but the elect brothers
[1:22:54] and sisters are going to behave like
[1:22:56] buddy Robinson remember the story of
[1:22:58] Buddy Robinson brother Bram tells a
[1:23:01] story this is out a spiritual Amnesia
[1:23:02] you don't have to look it up I'm just
[1:23:03] going to read it for time sake he says
[1:23:05] like buddy Robinson said one time in a
[1:23:07] cornfield he said Lord if you don't give
[1:23:09] me the Holy Ghost when you come back
[1:23:11] you'll find a pile of bones laying right
[1:23:13] here he was dead Earnest and you're not
[1:23:17] going to get anything from God until you
[1:23:20] get desperate enough brothers and
[1:23:22] sisters this is not a DAT to play Church
[1:23:24] we have got to know where we
[1:23:27] stand paragraph 173 according to Romans
[1:23:29] 4:16 we find that God has given a sure
[1:23:32] promise to all of Abraham's seed Paul
[1:23:35] puts himself and all the Believers under
[1:23:37] that designation because he says Abraham
[1:23:41] who is the father of us
[1:23:43] all then he goes on not to not only
[1:23:46] narrow down his definition but rather to
[1:23:49] finalize it I love that for in Galatians
[1:23:52] 3 he identified the seed singular with
[1:23:56] Jesus and counted the seed children as
[1:23:59] children of promise and promise as
[1:24:03] having to do with election or the
[1:24:05] choosing of God and that is exactly what
[1:24:08] we have been
[1:24:10] saying these who are the Royal seed are
[1:24:14] the elect of God are the predestinated
[1:24:17] forn of God and were in the mind of God
[1:24:21] and his thoughts I just love this in
[1:24:24] very plain language the true bride of
[1:24:26] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:24:28] though not expressed until each came
[1:24:31] forth in the designated decreed
[1:24:36] season as each member came forth it
[1:24:40] became expressed and took its place in
[1:24:43] the body thus this bride this bride this
[1:24:48] one right here tonight is the bride this
[1:24:52] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:24:57] bride and though she is feminine in
[1:24:59] designation she is also called the body
[1:25:03] of
[1:25:04] Christ I just think that's so beautiful
[1:25:06] I've got this underlined
[1:25:10] highlighted it's very apparent that she
[1:25:13] ought to be called that for she was
[1:25:16] predestinated in
[1:25:19] him came from the same Source was
[1:25:22] eternal with him and as is now
[1:25:24] manifesting
[1:25:26] God can you believe that not manifesting
[1:25:30] the church not manifesting Mom and Dad's
[1:25:34] religion not manifesting what I've just
[1:25:37] learned or went to a theological School
[1:25:39] manifesting
[1:25:44] God that to me is just about more than
[1:25:49] one can
[1:25:51] bear my
[1:25:59] oh
[1:26:01] my it's very apparent that she ought to
[1:26:04] be called that for she was predestinated
[1:26:06] in him came from the same
[1:26:08] Source yes was eternal with him and is
[1:26:12] now manifesting God in a many membered
[1:26:14] body whereas once God was manifested in
[1:26:17] one member even our Lord Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ now then here we are coming to a
[1:26:25] conclusion and even tonight brothers and
[1:26:30] sisters as the Eternal logos God was
[1:26:33] manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[1:26:38] all the fullness of the godhead
[1:26:42] bodily let's turn over to Colossians 2:9
[1:26:45] we still have a couple minutes
[1:26:47] here I think it's real important to
[1:26:53] just preach the
[1:27:04] word Colossians
[1:27:09] 2:9 not what the prophet said not what
[1:27:13] some Minister said what God Said
[1:27:17] Colossians 2 verse
[1:27:21] 9 for in him in who
[1:27:26] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:27:31] bodily amen let's just go back to verse
[1:27:34] eight beware lest any man spoil you
[1:27:36] through philosophy and vain deceit the
[1:27:39] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[1:27:42] of
[1:27:43] men beware lest any man spoil you
[1:27:45] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[1:27:48] the tradition of men after the rudiments
[1:27:52] of the world and not after Christ
[1:27:54] and remember one word off one word off
[1:27:58] is exactly what he's talking about here
[1:28:01] one word for in him dwelleth all the
[1:28:04] fullness of the godhead bodily and what
[1:28:07] and ye are complete in him which is the
[1:28:10] head of all principality and power my
[1:28:13] goodness now then here we are coming to
[1:28:16] a conclusion as the Eternal logos God
[1:28:18] was manifest in the Sun and Jesus
[1:28:22] dwelt in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:28:25] the godhead bodily and that Eternal one
[1:28:28] was the father manifest in flesh and
[1:28:32] thereby
[1:28:36] gained amen and thereby gained the title
[1:28:40] of
[1:28:42] son even so brothers and sisters even so
[1:28:46] we Eternal in his thoughts in our
[1:28:51] turn became the many membered spoken
[1:28:55] word seed manifest in
[1:28:59] flesh I'll call the musicians as we
[1:29:01] close remember when Jesus was on Earth
[1:29:04] Satan came to him and tempted him and
[1:29:09] tried him but what did Jesus do he stuck
[1:29:11] with the
[1:29:12] word the devil said isn't it written and
[1:29:15] he said get behind me Satan for it's
[1:29:19] also written amen he did it three times
[1:29:22] and after he actually stood is ground
[1:29:24] according to the word Satan fled Jesus
[1:29:27] never fled we don't need to flee alls we
[1:29:30] need to do is submit ourselves therefore
[1:29:33] unto God and resist the devil brothers
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:36] sisters sometimes submitting ourselves
[1:29:38] therefore unto God isn't just going on
[1:29:41] our knees in prayer and submitting
[1:29:42] ourselves therefore unto God maybe it's
[1:29:44] actually coming according to the word of
[1:29:46] God and making that thing right that's
[1:29:49] wrong submitting ourselves therefore
[1:29:51] unto God then we can resist the devil
[1:29:54] and he's got to flee but if we've got
[1:29:56] that thing the devil knows it and so
[1:29:59] does God and the the Lord can't even
[1:30:01] help us he's going to say you know what
[1:30:03] I gave you my direction my word but if
[1:30:04] you're not willing to do
[1:30:06] it then uh the Tormentor come in your
[1:30:11] way I just love this though he goes on
[1:30:13] to say and those Eternal thoughts now
[1:30:15] manifest In the Flesh are the sons of
[1:30:17] God even as we are so called behold what
[1:30:22] manner of love Brothers and sisters
[1:30:24] maybe stand with me as we close tonight
[1:30:26] what manner of love the father hath
[1:30:28] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:30:29] called the sons of
[1:30:32] God we did not become seed by the
[1:30:35] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[1:30:41] reborn Hallelujah for only the elect can
[1:30:45] be
[1:30:46] reborn because we were seed is the
[1:30:50] reason we could be
[1:30:52] quickened in nonseed there is nothing to
[1:30:56] Quicken now we'll pick up from here next
[1:30:59] time he says hold this carefully in mind
[1:31:02] but brothers and sisters I want to say
[1:31:04] this I think it's important and I might
[1:31:06] cause some stir but maybe we need some
[1:31:10] stir remember what he says here because
[1:31:13] we were seed is the reason we could be
[1:31:15] quickened the word quickened means life
[1:31:19] we've got life there's something that's
[1:31:22] bubbling up inside of us when we're
[1:31:24] little kids in Sunday school we sing
[1:31:26] that song it's bubbling it's bubbling
[1:31:28] it's bubbling in my soul can we do that
[1:31:31] as adults or are we too shy to say that
[1:31:33] oh no I can't do that oh and maybe do
[1:31:35] the actions now brother Barry's getting
[1:31:37] a little crazy I know I'm getting some
[1:31:39] funny looks it's late on a Wednesday but
[1:31:41] brothers and sisters is it bubbling in
[1:31:43] our
[1:31:45] souls if we are Sons and Daughters it
[1:31:49] ought to be amen if it's not is it his
[1:31:56] spirit because we were seed is the
[1:31:58] reason we could be quickened now some
[1:32:00] people will say brother Barry I've been
[1:32:02] Quicken to the word I can say amen God
[1:32:04] sent a prophet sure enough but is the
[1:32:07] life that the prophet brought to
[1:32:08] represent living now in you and through
[1:32:11] you because if it's not then you've
[1:32:13] missed the point of the message of the
[1:32:15] hour the message of the hour was to call
[1:32:17] out that elect seed to God to take a
[1:32:20] bride of his own choosing because we
[1:32:22] were seed is the reason we could be
[1:32:24] quickened in nonseed there is nothing to
[1:32:26] Quicken hold this in mind hold this
[1:32:28] carefully in mind he says hold this
[1:32:30] carefully in mind that in nonseed there
[1:32:33] is nothing to Quicken so if we come to
[1:32:35] church and it's just yeah whatever I
[1:32:38] want to say brothers and sisters are we
[1:32:41] seed that might be really sharp but I
[1:32:43] think this is the day and age in which
[1:32:45] we need to be sharp I can only imagine
[1:32:47] that just before it was time to get into
[1:32:49] the ark Noah wasn't saying oh please can
[1:32:53] we write handwritten notes to everyone
[1:32:56] and say would you please come to the
[1:32:58] invitation to the ark because it's going
[1:33:00] to rain and God is actually going to
[1:33:02] destroy all flesh All Flesh is full of
[1:33:06] violence in the world the whole entire
[1:33:07] world everything that's breathing in his
[1:33:10] lungs is going to die it's going to
[1:33:12] perish he wasn't doing that he was
[1:33:13] crying out he was saying get in the boat
[1:33:17] brothers and sisters it's just about to
[1:33:19] rain fire and it's going to be one way
[1:33:21] or the other either it's going to be an
[1:33:23] atomic b or it's going to be an
[1:33:24] antichrist Spirit that's going to crush
[1:33:26] the world one way or another just get in
[1:33:28] the
[1:33:29] boat but I recognize it that not
[1:33:32] everyone can let's just pray for those
[1:33:36] those ones that are just waiting to get
[1:33:37] in the boat because there's still some
[1:33:39] elected seed or we wouldn't be here
[1:33:41] right now let's just bow in prayer
[1:33:44] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love
[1:33:46] you and we thank you for your word thank
[1:33:48] you Lord Jesus that there are seed on
[1:33:51] the Earth today that can be quickened
[1:33:53] father by by your word and we know it
[1:33:55] doesn't mean to just simply say that you
[1:33:57] sent a prophet and to say that we know
[1:34:00] the the words the prophet said oh Father
[1:34:02] it's because we've got that life that
[1:34:04] the prophet represented inside of us
[1:34:07] Lord Jesus we followed the instructions
[1:34:09] and it made the way for the introduction
[1:34:11] of the bridegroom the Heavenly
[1:34:13] bridegroom to the Earthly bride and
