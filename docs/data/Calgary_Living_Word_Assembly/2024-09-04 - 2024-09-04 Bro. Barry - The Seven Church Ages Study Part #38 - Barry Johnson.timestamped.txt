[57:02] 2 talking about the pergami and church
[57:08] age starting with verse 12 of
[57:10] Revelations chapter
[57:13] 2 and to the angel of the church in
[57:16] pergamus write these things saith he
[57:20] which hath a sharp sword with two
[57:23] edges I Know Thy works and where thou

[57:29] is and thou holdest fast my name and
[57:33] Hast not denied my faith even in those
[57:36] days where in an toass was my faithful
[57:39] martyr who was slain among you where
[57:41] Satan
[57:43] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[57:46] thee because thou Hast there them that
[57:49] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[57:52] baac to cast a stumbling block before
[57:55] the children of Israel to eat things
[57:58] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[58:01] fornication so hast thou also them that
[58:05] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[58:09] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[58:14] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[58:16] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[58:20] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit

[59:25] that that we have brother toes OD denoo
[59:31] he'll be taking the service on Sunday
[59:33] and uh we're excited about that as well
[59:36] and uh I'm exceptionally excited to hear
[59:39] what the Lord's placed on his heart as
[59:41] he has requested that we study ahead in
[59:44] the message how can I overcome as I
[59:46] posted in the WhatsApp chat group I had
[59:50] ministered from that a while back and uh
[59:52] there's just so many nuggets in that
[59:54] message that are are so pertinent to us
[59:57] in our day because I believe every one
[59:59] of us wants to know how to
[1:00:01] overcome we're excited about Sunday pray
[1:00:04] for brother toes and uh I'm sure the
[1:00:07] Lord will bless us we have the youth
[1:00:10] service coming up on the 15th after
[1:00:12] service we'll have that at our place um
[1:00:15] on behalf of brother Joel and Sister
[1:00:16] Crystal who are not able to take it this
[1:00:19] month we also have a communion service
[1:00:22] coming up on the 22nd and I do apologize
[1:00:24] I Mis announced that before
[1:00:26] but we had agreed to do the services at
[1:00:29] 5:30 instead of 6:00 p.m. so that we
[1:00:32] have time to actually do everything and
[1:00:35] uh not feel pressured but we can get
[1:00:37] home at a decent time I know it's a very
[1:00:40] difficult time this month uh with all
[1:00:42] the children going back to school
[1:00:44] everything in our lives is changing and
[1:00:47] it takes a little while to get used to
[1:00:49] the routine so um we're going to have
[1:00:51] that service at 5:30 p.m. and we'll
[1:00:53] trust the Lord will bless it are you
[1:00:56] happy this
[1:00:57] evening certainly a wonderful song
[1:01:00] service when the atmosphere gets set
[1:01:02] like that it's just a a wonderful
[1:01:05] thing last week we read we read from the
[1:01:09] scripture um we
[1:01:12] read we read out of the church age book
[1:01:15] rather the
[1:01:17] scripture verse 15 out of Revelations
[1:01:20] chapter 2 and tonight uh we'll go uh
[1:01:25] dive into to the doctrine of balum verse
[1:01:27] 15 talks about the doctrine of the niaes
[1:01:30] and uh verse 14 actually is about the
[1:01:35] doctrine of balum and I think it's
[1:01:36] interesting we pointed out last week how
[1:01:39] those two are actually reversed in the
[1:01:42] church age book compared to the way they
[1:01:44] are in the scripture and I believe it's
[1:01:46] for a purpose brother brandham is
[1:01:47] pointing out the doctrine of the nicotin
[1:01:51] is the the lordship over man man over
[1:01:54] man the the Bishops that were set up and
[1:01:58] created which is exactly against the
[1:02:00] word of God and how men can actually
[1:02:04] decide who should be doing what
[1:02:06] according to the will of God and uh it's
[1:02:09] just a beautiful thing to see how the
[1:02:11] prophet brought that out but I think
[1:02:14] there's something really fascinating and
[1:02:16] uh I pointed it out last week as well I
[1:02:19] believe the Lord showed us that and that
[1:02:20] is that you cannot have the spirit of
[1:02:24] nanism without having the spirit of
[1:02:27] balum the doctrine of balum being there
[1:02:30] as well and the doctrine of balum we
[1:02:32] heard about that the doctrine of balum
[1:02:35] is uh the doctrine that teaches people
[1:02:38] to cast stumbling blocks before other
[1:02:41] people now some would say the scripture
[1:02:43] says that was to cast a stumbling block
[1:02:45] before the children of Israel but we
[1:02:46] know that's applicable in our day as
[1:02:48] well and uh it's a very important thing
[1:02:51] I'm just going to start with the
[1:02:52] beginning here of the doctrine of balum
[1:02:55] out of the uh exposition of the seven
[1:02:58] Church ages Revelations
[1:03:00] 2:14 brother Bram uh sorry the scripture
[1:03:02] says Thou Hast them there that hold the
[1:03:05] doctrine of balum who taught balac to
[1:03:06] cast a stumbling block before the
[1:03:08] children of Israel to eat things
[1:03:10] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[1:03:12] fornication Lord willing will get a good
[1:03:14] portion of this the way through this um
[1:03:18] it's it's very rich paragraph 194
[1:03:21] brother banam says now you just can't
[1:03:23] have a nickan setup in the church
[1:03:26] and not have this other Doctrine come
[1:03:28] into you see if you take away the word
[1:03:31] of God and the moving of the spirit as a
[1:03:34] means of worship they that worship me
[1:03:37] must worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:03:42] then you will have to give the people
[1:03:43] another form of worship as a substitute
[1:03:47] and a substitute spells bism and brother
[1:03:51] Brown I he goes on to say it here but
[1:03:52] I'm just going to throw it out there
[1:03:53] just because I think it's really
[1:03:54] important to sort of highlight and
[1:03:56] underline these things and and what the
[1:03:58] spirit of
[1:04:05] bmismart any sort of hybrid and I want
[1:04:08] to say any sort of tradition any sort of
[1:04:11] way that we want to worship God that's
[1:04:14] different than the message of the hour
[1:04:16] I'm going to say it tonight it's bism
[1:04:18] and we need to call it what it is the
[1:04:21] devil wants us to dance around it and
[1:04:22] say well you know that's just their
[1:04:24] tradition and that's just their way and
[1:04:26] we've always done it this way and we
[1:04:27] don't want to offend anyone but you know
[1:04:29] what the word of God is quick and
[1:04:31] Powerful it's sharper than any two-edged
[1:04:33] sword and it needs to do what it needs
[1:04:35] to do it's given to us to perfect us and
[1:04:38] it takes a five-fold Ministry to bring
[1:04:40] that Perfection but we don't want to
[1:04:42] make any excuses for the doctrine of
[1:04:44] balum we don't want to make any excuses
[1:04:46] for a nician Doctrine either he goes on
[1:04:49] to say if we're going to understand what
[1:04:51] the doctrine of balum is in the New
[1:04:52] Testament Church we had better go back
[1:04:54] and see what it was in the Old Testament
[1:04:56] Church and apply it to that third age
[1:05:00] and then bring it up to the present I've
[1:05:03] got that highlighted here bring it up to
[1:05:05] the present I love how he does that he
[1:05:07] doesn't just keep it back there in
[1:05:09] history it's not just in the Old
[1:05:10] Testament it's not just in the New
[1:05:12] Testament it's in this Testament it's in
[1:05:14] the present Testament paragraph
[1:05:17] 196 oh sorry the story is found in
[1:05:19] Numbers chapter 22 through 2 uh there's
[1:05:23] a lot of reading in there I thought
[1:05:25] maybe we should dive into it maybe we
[1:05:26] will sometime get into preaching about
[1:05:28] it but if you want to see it it's in
[1:05:30] numbers CH 22 through to 2 well worth
[1:05:33] the read if you're interested in what
[1:05:35] the doctrine of balum is um brother bam
[1:05:38] goes on to say now we know that Israel
[1:05:40] was the chosen people of God they were
[1:05:42] the Pentecostals of their day they had
[1:05:45] signs and wonders right they had taken
[1:05:47] Refuge under the blood they had all been
[1:05:49] baptized in the Red Sea and they had
[1:05:51] come up out of the waters singing in the
[1:05:53] spirit and dancing under the energy of
[1:05:55] the Holy Ghost while Miriam the
[1:05:58] prophetes played her
[1:06:00] tambourine well after a certain time of
[1:06:03] journeying these children of Israel came
[1:06:04] to Moab you remember who Moab was he was
[1:06:08] the son of lot by one of his own
[1:06:11] daughters and lot in turn was a nephew
[1:06:13] of Abraham so Israel and Moab were
[1:06:16] related I want you to see that he says
[1:06:19] who wants you to see that the
[1:06:23] prophet brother Vil
[1:06:25] of the Holy Ghost who wants you to see
[1:06:28] that the moabites knew the truth whether
[1:06:31] they lived up to it or not they were
[1:06:35] related so Israel came up to the borders
[1:06:37] of Moab and sent Messengers to the king
[1:06:40] saying we are brothers let us pass
[1:06:42] through your land if your people if our
[1:06:44] people or animals eat or drink anything
[1:06:46] we will gladly pay for it but King balac
[1:06:49] got very excited I love it why did he
[1:06:52] get excited because he was an insecure
[1:06:54] King
[1:06:56] he knew what was right but he wasn't
[1:06:58] doing it the head of that nickan
[1:07:02] Bunch was not about to let the church
[1:07:04] come through with its signs and wonders
[1:07:06] and diverse manifestations of the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost with their faces shining with the
[1:07:12] glory of God it was too risky why was it
[1:07:17] risky why would that be risky why would
[1:07:20] it be risky for God to shine in people's
[1:07:24] face as he might lose some of his crowd
[1:07:27] some people might actually get attracted
[1:07:30] to that some people might actually get
[1:07:32] the Holy Ghost and want to go forwards
[1:07:35] with that so BAC refused to let Israel
[1:07:38] pass through because he was an insecure
[1:07:40] King he knew he was doing wrong in fact
[1:07:43] so great was his fear of them that he
[1:07:45] went to a hling prophet called balum and
[1:07:48] asked him to mediate between him and God
[1:07:51] and petition the almighty to curse
[1:07:54] Israel and to render them
[1:07:57] impotent can you imagine that there's no
[1:08:00] different today brothers and sisters
[1:08:01] remember he said he wanted to bring it
[1:08:02] up to the present there no different
[1:08:04] today the spirits still do this exact
[1:08:08] same thing try to get people rendered
[1:08:12] impotent and what that means it's not so
[1:08:14] they can't have children it's not so
[1:08:16] they can't actually live their lives and
[1:08:18] be functioning normal citizens in this
[1:08:21] world it's so they don't see the power
[1:08:23] of God it's so that that spirit can
[1:08:25] creep into the framework of the
[1:08:27] Christian Church get into people's lives
[1:08:29] and and show them the way to go but give
[1:08:32] them the opportunity to to maybe step
[1:08:34] aside and say well I just want to do it
[1:08:35] my way the word of God will never give
[1:08:37] us the ability to
[1:08:39] compromise but the devil will come in
[1:08:41] and try and get God's people to be
[1:08:44] rendered impotent to be
[1:08:48] powerless anyways paragraph 199 and
[1:08:50] balum being eager to take part in the
[1:08:53] political Affairs and become a great man
[1:08:56] was only too glad to do so but seeing
[1:08:58] that he had to approach and receive an
[1:09:01] audience from God to get the people
[1:09:03] cursed as he could not do it by himself
[1:09:06] he went to ask God if he could have his
[1:09:08] permission to go just it's it's hard to
[1:09:11] even comprehend this really now isn't
[1:09:14] that just like the
[1:09:16] nicians huh the nicians we have with us
[1:09:19] today they curse everyone that won't go
[1:09:23] their way you ever heard of that you
[1:09:25] ever heard of anybody in the message say
[1:09:27] that if you don't do it my way you're
[1:09:29] going to
[1:09:30] hell
[1:09:32] anybody that's a spirit that we're
[1:09:34] talking about here and it's alive and
[1:09:36] well and it is not afraid to jump into
[1:09:38] the message groups and tell people if
[1:09:40] you don't do it my way then you're not
[1:09:42] going to be saved nickan Spirit the
[1:09:46] doctrine of the
[1:09:47] nicians when balum asked God for
[1:09:49] permission to go God turned him down my
[1:09:53] that's stung so Bayo is insisted
[1:09:56] promising him even greater rewards and
[1:09:58] honor so balam went back to God now one
[1:10:02] answer from God should have been
[1:10:05] enough not for self-willed balum when
[1:10:08] God saw his
[1:10:11] perversity he told them to get up and go
[1:10:14] you're GNA do it anyway go for
[1:10:17] it quickly he saddled the donkey and
[1:10:20] away he went he should have realized
[1:10:23] that this was simply God's permissive
[1:10:25] will and he wouldn't be able to curse
[1:10:28] them if he went 20 times and tried 20
[1:10:31] times he was a prophet should he not
[1:10:35] know how like balum are people today oh
[1:10:40] I want to do this and I believe that God
[1:10:43] will bless me when I do it he might but
[1:10:46] it doesn't mean he say will just because
[1:10:49] we get a blessing in our life doesn't
[1:10:50] mean it's God's will no it's got to be
[1:10:54] according to the word
[1:10:56] how like balam are people today they
[1:10:59] believe in three gods and get baptized
[1:11:01] in three titles instead of the name and
[1:11:04] yet God will send the spirit upon them
[1:11:07] as he did upon balum and they will go on
[1:11:11] believing that they are exactly right
[1:11:14] and here they are actually perfect
[1:11:19] bites see the doctrine of balum go ahead
[1:11:22] anyway do it your way they said well God
[1:11:25] has blessed us it must be all right I
[1:11:29] know he's blessed you I don't deny that
[1:11:33] but it's the same organizational route
[1:11:36] that balum took its Defiance to God's
[1:11:39] word its false teaching now I want to
[1:11:43] say here tonight we can say while
[1:11:45] brother Barry he's just talking about
[1:11:47] the trinitarian doctrine and he is we
[1:11:50] know that very clearly but with the
[1:11:52] spirit of God we can read between the
[1:11:53] lines and say that and
[1:11:56] anything else but what the word of God
[1:11:59] for our day says is exactly the same
[1:12:02] thing because we can be baptized in the
[1:12:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and still
[1:12:07] get into the permissive will of God and
[1:12:10] still be blessed and still think that
[1:12:13] everything is
[1:12:15] okay but God won't leave us
[1:12:17] there he'll even let a donkey squish our
[1:12:20] leg up against the wall to get our
[1:12:22] attention and if that don't get our
[1:12:24] attention then he'll even let the donkey
[1:12:26] tell us what's your problem man there's
[1:12:28] something wrong with you don't you see
[1:12:30] the angel of the Lord is standing in
[1:12:32] front of you with his sword drawn to
[1:12:34] kill
[1:12:36] you my so balum went wildly down the
[1:12:40] road until an angel from God stood in
[1:12:42] his way but that Prophet Bishop Cardinal
[1:12:44] chairman president and general overseer
[1:12:46] was so blinded to the spiritual things
[1:12:49] by the thought of honor and glory and
[1:12:52] money that he could not see the angel
[1:12:54] stand ING with a drawn
[1:12:56] sword there he stood to block the Mad
[1:12:59] Prophet the little donkey saw him and
[1:13:02] dodged back and forth until he finally
[1:13:04] crushed balam's foot against the stone
[1:13:06] wall the ass stopped and would not go on
[1:13:10] he could not so balum jumped off and
[1:13:13] began beating him isn't that just the
[1:13:15] way we are as humans we become mad
[1:13:18] sometimes I've been there you have been
[1:13:19] there you ever experienced it you're
[1:13:21] just beating your head against the wall
[1:13:23] thinking you everything is right and
[1:13:25] it's wrong and the wronger it gets the
[1:13:27] harder you push balum jumped off and
[1:13:30] began beating him the donkey then began
[1:13:32] to talk to Bam God let that donkey speak
[1:13:36] in a tongue that donkey was no hybrid he
[1:13:39] was the original seed he said to the
[1:13:42] blinded Prophet am I not your donkey and
[1:13:45] haven't I carried you Faithfully bam
[1:13:48] replied yes yes you are my donkey and
[1:13:52] you have carried me Faithfully until now
[1:13:53] talking to a donkey and if I can't get
[1:13:56] you going I'm going to kill you whoa
[1:13:58] what's this talking to a donkey that's
[1:14:02] funny I thought I heard the donkey
[1:14:03] talking and I was answering it back God
[1:14:06] has always spoken in a tongue he spoke
[1:14:09] at belshazzar's feast and then at
[1:14:11] Pentecost he's doing it again today it's
[1:14:14] a warning of soon coming
[1:14:17] judgment then the angel was made visible
[1:14:20] to balum he told balum that except for
[1:14:23] the Donkey he'd be
[1:14:26] dead even now for tempting God but when
[1:14:30] balam promised to go back he was sent on
[1:14:34] with the admonition to say only what God
[1:14:37] gave him and I can only imagine that guy
[1:14:40] he wanted to say everything that God
[1:14:41] said he wasn't interested in trying to
[1:14:43] make excuses for nobody not at that
[1:14:46] point but he had a little bit of a
[1:14:48] different walk didn't he his foot was
[1:14:50] hurt so balum went down and set up seven
[1:14:53] altars for the clean Beast of sacrifice
[1:14:56] he killed a ram signifying the coming of
[1:14:58] the Messiah he knew what to do to
[1:15:01] approach unto God he had the mechanics
[1:15:04] just right but not the
[1:15:07] Dynamics same as now can't you see it
[1:15:12] nicolaes there was Israel down there in
[1:15:14] the valley offering the same sacrifice
[1:15:16] doing the same things but only one had
[1:15:19] the signs
[1:15:20] following only one had God in their
[1:15:23] midst four form won't get you
[1:15:26] anywhere it can't take the place of
[1:15:30] spirit
[1:15:32] manifestation sometimes we can do
[1:15:35] that it's very important to not not
[1:15:38] worry so much about Forum brothers and
[1:15:41] sisters worry about the Dynamics worry
[1:15:44] about the Holy
[1:15:45] Spirit brother Ram says that is what
[1:15:47] happened at NAA they put over balam's
[1:15:51] Doctrine not the doctrine of
[1:15:53] God and they stumbled y they fell they
[1:15:57] became dead
[1:15:58] men these are hard
[1:16:00] words after the sacrifice was made balum
[1:16:03] was ready to prophesy but God tied his
[1:16:06] tongue up and he could not curse them he
[1:16:08] blessed them Balo was very angry but
[1:16:12] there was nothing Bam could do about the
[1:16:15] prophecy it had been spoken by the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost so baac took balum to go down into
[1:16:21] the valley and look upon their back
[1:16:22] parts to see if there wasn't possibly
[1:16:25] some way that he could curse them the
[1:16:27] tactics that BAC used are the same
[1:16:31] tactics they use today who uses
[1:16:34] today who's
[1:16:36] they the big denominations look down at
[1:16:40] the little groups and anything they find
[1:16:43] amongst them to make out a scandal they
[1:16:46] bring it out and shout it if the moderns
[1:16:49] live in sin no one says anything about
[1:16:53] it but let one of the elect get into
[1:16:55] trouble and every paper blasted across
[1:16:58] the
[1:17:00] country yes Israel had her back carnal
[1:17:04] Parts they had their side that wasn't
[1:17:08] praiseworthy but in spite of their
[1:17:10] imperfections by the purpose of God that
[1:17:13] works through election by grace and not
[1:17:17] by works by grace and not by works they
[1:17:22] had the cloud by day and the Pillar of
[1:17:25] Fire by night they had the smitten Rock
[1:17:28] the Brazen Serpent and the signs and
[1:17:31] wonders they were Vindicated not in
[1:17:35] themselves but in God
[1:17:38] Amen God didn't have any respect for
[1:17:41] those nicians with their phds llds and
[1:17:45] DDS and all their fine
[1:17:47] organizations and the best that man
[1:17:50] could boast but he did have respect unto
[1:17:53] Israel for they had the word Vindicated
[1:17:57] amongst them certainly Israel didn't
[1:18:00] look too polished up just having come
[1:18:02] out of Egypt in Precious flight but she
[1:18:07] was blessed people
[1:18:09] anyway all she had ever known for over
[1:18:12] 300 years was hurting flocks tending
[1:18:14] fields and slaving away in fear of death
[1:18:18] under the
[1:18:19] Egyptians but she was free now she was a
[1:18:23] blessed people through the sovereignty
[1:18:25] of God certainly Moab looked down on her
[1:18:30] all the other nations did too isn't that
[1:18:33] interesting that Moab looked down on
[1:18:34] here we got the prophet saying that Moab
[1:18:36] looked down on her without recognizing
[1:18:38] the roots of where Moab came from
[1:18:42] goodness sakes organization always looks
[1:18:45] down on the unorganized and either will
[1:18:48] by determination bring them into
[1:18:51] organization or destroy them when they
[1:18:54] won't come
[1:18:55] if you're not seeing it my way then
[1:18:57] you're not seeing it at
[1:18:58] all and it goes further than that we
[1:19:01] know that that's just the beginning of
[1:19:02] it we read all about it last night or
[1:19:05] the sorry last
[1:19:07] service the spirit of the nicians
[1:19:10] they'll think they're God doing God a
[1:19:11] service by actually killing people in
[1:19:13] the name of the Lord which is just
[1:19:17] shocking but it's coming
[1:19:19] again paragraph
[1:19:22] 2113 now someone might ask me brother br
[1:19:25] what makes you think that Moab was
[1:19:26] organized while Israel was not where did
[1:19:29] you get that idea I get it right here in
[1:19:31] the Bible as usual so beautiful isn't it
[1:19:35] I don't get it from some textbook
[1:19:36] somewhere else from some theology from
[1:19:38] some Seminary I I get it I get it right
[1:19:41] here in the Bible it's all typed out
[1:19:44] here everything written in the Old
[1:19:46] Testament that is in the story form is
[1:19:49] written for our admonition so that we
[1:19:51] can learn from it here it is right in
[1:19:54] numbers
[1:19:56] 23:9 from the top of the Rocks I see him
[1:20:00] and from the hills I Behold Him Lo the
[1:20:04] people shall dwell alone and shall not
[1:20:07] be reckoned among the
[1:20:09] Nations he says There It Is God looking
[1:20:12] down from the top of the Rocks not in
[1:20:15] some Valley looking for their bad points
[1:20:17] and condemning them God seeing them the
[1:20:21] way he wanted to see them from the
[1:20:24] height of love and mercy while I was
[1:20:27] studying this I just had to highlight
[1:20:31] that and underline that and and note
[1:20:33] that brothers and sisters let us look
[1:20:36] upon one another from the height of love
[1:20:39] and
[1:20:40] mercy not look down on one another not
[1:20:43] look at at hinder Parts not not try and
[1:20:46] find fault and failure in one another
[1:20:49] let's look at one another from the
[1:20:51] height of love and mercy it's just so
[1:20:53] wonderful
[1:20:55] God looks at them the way that he wanted
[1:20:58] them to be the way that he created them
[1:21:00] to be and we know that he does that with
[1:21:02] us also they dwelt alone and they
[1:21:05] weren't organized they didn't have a
[1:21:07] king they had a prophet and the prophet
[1:21:11] had God in him by the spirit and the
[1:21:14] word came to the prophet and the word
[1:21:17] went to the people they didn't belong to
[1:21:20] the UN they didn't Belong To The World
[1:21:22] Council of churches to the Baptist
[1:21:25] Presbyterians Assembly of God or any
[1:21:27] other group they didn't need to belong
[1:21:30] isn't that wonderful to think that they
[1:21:31] didn't need to belong we don't need to
[1:21:33] belong here tonight either they didn't
[1:21:35] need to belong they were joined to God
[1:21:38] they didn't need counsel from any
[1:21:41] councel they had thus saith the Lord in
[1:21:44] their midst Hallelujah and we already
[1:21:47] covered that and pick up your pen and WR
[1:21:49] but I just have to say it she has the
[1:21:52] mind of the Lord she already has thus
[1:21:54] sayith the Lord and the mind of Christ
[1:21:57] to know what to do with
[1:21:59] it so we have thus sayith the Lord in
[1:22:02] our midst
[1:22:04] Hallelujah now in spite of the fact that
[1:22:07] balum knew the proper approach to God
[1:22:09] and can bring forth a revelation from
[1:22:12] the Lord by means of a special enduement
[1:22:15] of power he was still for all of that
[1:22:19] Bishop in the false
[1:22:21] group for what he did now in order to
[1:22:25] win the favor what did for what did he
[1:22:28] do now in order to win favor with BAC he
[1:22:32] formulated a plan wherein God would be
[1:22:35] forced to deal with Israel in
[1:22:39] death just as Satan knew that he could
[1:22:43] beguile Eve
[1:22:48] because just as s sorry just as Satan
[1:22:51] knew that he could beguile Eve caused
[1:22:53] her to fall all in fleshly sin thus
[1:22:57] causing God to pass his pronounced
[1:22:59] sentence of death against sin so balum
[1:23:03] knew that if he could get Israel to sin
[1:23:06] God would have to deal with them in
[1:23:08] death isn't that shocking to think about
[1:23:12] that another human being would actually
[1:23:14] be operating on the same level the
[1:23:16] serpent was under the same exact
[1:23:18] anointing to manipulate
[1:23:21] God so he planned a way to get them to
[1:23:24] come over and join in sin he sent out
[1:23:28] invitations to come to the Feast of Bal
[1:23:30] peor come over and worship with us now
[1:23:34] Israel no doubt had seen Feast of the
[1:23:37] Egyptians so they did not feel it was
[1:23:40] too wrong to go and just look on and
[1:23:42] perhaps eat with the people what could
[1:23:44] be wrong with it you're just
[1:23:45] fellowshipping with them right what's
[1:23:48] wrong with Fellowship anyway we're
[1:23:51] supposed to love them aren't we or how
[1:23:53] can we win them
[1:23:55] being friendly never heard anyone or so
[1:23:59] they thought but when those sexy motish
[1:24:03] women began to dance and undress while
[1:24:06] they Whirled around doing their rock and
[1:24:08] roll and twist the lust rose up in the
[1:24:12] Israelites and they were drawn into
[1:24:15] adultery and God in Wrath slw
[1:24:19] 42,000 of them it's just got me thinking
[1:24:23] while I was studying this you know how
[1:24:26] God created man and woman and how he
[1:24:29] separated the two and how there was the
[1:24:31] fall we all know about this men are
[1:24:34] wired a certain way and when they see a
[1:24:38] woman dressed a certain way it causes a
[1:24:42] reaction whether the man wants it or not
[1:24:44] it causes a reaction because we are in
[1:24:47] this flesh this is the DNA that we have
[1:24:50] when we talk about spiritual DNA it is a
[1:24:53] spiritual thing flesh has to perish but
[1:24:56] this flesh always gets a reaction that's
[1:24:59] why it's vital to follow the
[1:25:01] instructions of the Vindicated Prophet
[1:25:04] for the woman to recognize to not wear
[1:25:06] clothing pertaining to a man garments
[1:25:08] that pertain to a man to not wear
[1:25:10] clothing that makes a woman look like a
[1:25:13] skin down weener exact quote of the
[1:25:15] Prophet because when that happens if a
[1:25:17] man looks upon the woman what happens is
[1:25:20] there's a reaction now a Son of God is
[1:25:22] going to take that reaction and say I
[1:25:24] understand what's happening and push it
[1:25:26] aside and fight it but he has to fight
[1:25:29] it it's not something that just
[1:25:31] automatically happens and there's no no
[1:25:34] issue no problem and we know the world
[1:25:36] is set up today I've heard it even to
[1:25:39] say that it's the man's problem if the
[1:25:41] man looks it's his
[1:25:44] fault that's not the way that God
[1:25:46] created it that's not the way it works
[1:25:49] God created man to look upon a woman and
[1:25:52] to love her because she is is actually a
[1:25:54] part of him I'm going off on a tangent
[1:25:57] and I don't want to do that tonight but
[1:25:59] remember the way that baac got balam to
[1:26:03] curse them was to look upon the women
[1:26:06] and to lust after them and to fall in
[1:26:09] adultery to fall in fornication and God
[1:26:12] slew 42,000 of them and that is what
[1:26:16] Constantine and his successors did at
[1:26:18] NAA and after NAA they invited the
[1:26:22] people of God to the con vention and
[1:26:25] when the church sat down to eat and Rose
[1:26:27] up to play partaking of church form
[1:26:31] ceremonies and Pagan feasts named after
[1:26:34] Christian rights she was trapped she had
[1:26:38] committed
[1:26:39] fornication and God walked out my and
[1:26:44] when man turns from the word of God and
[1:26:46] joins a church instead of receiving the
[1:26:48] holy spirit that man dies dead that is
[1:26:53] what he is
[1:26:55] don't join a
[1:26:56] church don't join into
[1:26:59] organization and get taken up with
[1:27:02] Creeds and tradition or anything that
[1:27:05] takes the place of the word and the
[1:27:07] spirit or you're dead it's all over
[1:27:10] you're dead eternally separated from God
[1:27:14] and and how does this apply in our day
[1:27:15] brothers and sisters it applies by us
[1:27:18] interpreting this message of the hour
[1:27:21] and putting our own spin on it taking it
[1:27:23] and making it fit our lives and say we
[1:27:27] can just do it this way we can worship
[1:27:29] God this way remember we said at the
[1:27:31] start of this the doctrine of balum is
[1:27:33] to actually make a substitute for this
[1:27:36] word of God any substitute is the
[1:27:39] doctrine of
[1:27:41] balum that is what's happened in every
[1:27:43] age since he says God delivers the
[1:27:45] people they come out by the blood
[1:27:47] Sanctified by the word walk through the
[1:27:49] waters of baptism and get filled with
[1:27:51] the spirit but after a while the first
[1:27:53] love cools off and someone gets the idea
[1:27:57] that they ought to organize in order to
[1:27:59] preserve themselves and make a name for
[1:28:02] themselves and they organize themselves
[1:28:04] right back into the second generation
[1:28:06] and sometimes even before
[1:28:09] then he's talking about the second
[1:28:11] generation of
[1:28:12] people parents children grandchildren
[1:28:16] parents first generation children second
[1:28:19] generation second generation getting
[1:28:21] away from the word of God they no longer
[1:28:23] have the spirit of God just a form of
[1:28:25] worship we just go to church we just go
[1:28:28] to church we just sing songs we play
[1:28:31] music we just worship that's not what
[1:28:34] it's about at all it's about recognizing
[1:28:36] when we gather together this way we're
[1:28:38] meeting the King of Kings the Lord of
[1:28:42] lords and I I said it before I thought
[1:28:44] it was so beautiful the Lord I believe
[1:28:45] just gave it to me we're practicing the
[1:28:47] biggest special of our lives every time
[1:28:49] we have the opportunity to sing because
[1:28:51] we're coming to a place when we step
[1:28:53] over there that's all we're going to do
[1:28:54] is worship we're not preaching we're not
[1:28:56] reading the word we're not going to be
[1:28:58] reading the message of the hour we're
[1:28:59] going to be praising
[1:29:01] God
[1:29:03] right I just think this is shocking in
[1:29:06] here though in order to preserve
[1:29:09] themselves and make a name for
[1:29:10] themselves and they organized themselves
[1:29:13] right back in the second generation and
[1:29:16] sometimes even before then they no
[1:29:18] longer have the spirit of God just a
[1:29:20] form of worship
[1:29:23] bism they are dead they have hybridized
[1:29:26] themselves with a Creed and form and
[1:29:30] there is no life in them remember
[1:29:33] brother brandham says that if your
[1:29:35] worship if your religion doesn't have
[1:29:37] emotion it's dead and you might as well
[1:29:40] bury it and get something else get one
[1:29:42] with life so balum got Israel to commit
[1:29:46] fornication do you know that physical
[1:29:50] fornication is the very same spirit that
[1:29:54] lies in organized
[1:29:57] religion I have this highlighted here he
[1:29:59] says it again just like Paul said right
[1:30:01] just like Paul repeated himself if an
[1:30:04] angel from heaven preaches any other
[1:30:07] gospel than that which has already been
[1:30:10] preached let him be accursed again I say
[1:30:13] unto you he says it twice here we have
[1:30:16] brother Bram saying do you know that
[1:30:19] physical fornication is the very same
[1:30:21] spirit that lies in organized religion I
[1:30:25] said the spirit of fornication is the
[1:30:29] spirit of
[1:30:31] organization and all fornicators will
[1:30:33] have their place in the Lake of Fire
[1:30:35] that is what God thinks of organization
[1:30:37] yes sir the wh and her daughters will be
[1:30:41] in the Lake of
[1:30:42] Fire strong words we would never wish
[1:30:45] that upon anyone even our worst enemies
[1:30:48] this is the spirit of God Discerning
[1:30:50] right from
[1:30:52] wrong denomination are not of God they
[1:30:55] never have been and never will be it's a
[1:30:59] wrong spirit that separates the people
[1:31:01] of God into a hierarch hierarchy and Ley
[1:31:05] and it is therefore a wrong spirit that
[1:31:09] separates the people from the people
[1:31:12] that's what organization and
[1:31:14] denominations do in organizing they
[1:31:17] separate themselves from the word of God
[1:31:20] and bring themselves into spiritual
[1:31:22] adultery
[1:31:24] my now notice that Constantine gave
[1:31:27] special feasts unto the
[1:31:29] people they were the old Pagan feasts
[1:31:31] with the new names taken from the church
[1:31:34] or in some cases Christian rights were
[1:31:36] taken and abused with Pagan
[1:31:40] ceremonies he took the worship of the
[1:31:42] son God and changed it to the Son of God
[1:31:45] instead of celebrating on December 21st
[1:31:47] which is the winter
[1:31:49] solstice which
[1:31:51] is when they used to celebrate the feast
[1:31:54] to the son God they put it up to
[1:31:57] December 25th and called it the son of
[1:32:00] God's
[1:32:01] birthday but we know that he was born in
[1:32:04] April when life comes forth not in
[1:32:08] December and they took the feast to
[1:32:11] aarte and called it the Easter
[1:32:14] celebration where in the Christian is
[1:32:16] supposed to celebrate the death and
[1:32:17] resurrection of the Lord actually it was
[1:32:21] a pagan Feast to aarte and we know that
[1:32:23] both of them now are just commercial
[1:32:26] times in the
[1:32:28] world they placed altars in the church
[1:32:31] they put
[1:32:32] images they put in images they gave the
[1:32:35] people what they call the Apostles Creed
[1:32:39] though you can't find it in the Bible
[1:32:41] they taught the people ancestor worship
[1:32:43] thereby making the Roman Catholic Church
[1:32:46] the
[1:32:49] greatest spiritistic Church in the world
[1:32:52] every foul bird was in that cage and you
[1:32:55] have the Protestants with their
[1:32:57] organizations doing the same
[1:33:00] thing they ate things sacrificed to
[1:33:03] Idols now I don't say this really means
[1:33:06] they were literally eating Meats
[1:33:08] sacrificed to
[1:33:10] Idols for though the Council of
[1:33:13] Jerusalem had spoken against such Paul
[1:33:16] did not make much of it as he said the
[1:33:19] idols were nothing it was just a matter
[1:33:22] of conscience and except where it
[1:33:24] offended the weaker brother and then it
[1:33:26] was not allowed furthermore this
[1:33:29] Revelation has to do with Gentiles and
[1:33:32] not Jews as these are Gentile churches I
[1:33:35] see this in the same light as I see the
[1:33:38] words of the Lord except you eat my
[1:33:41] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:33:43] life in you man shall not live by bread
[1:33:46] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:33:48] out of the mouth of God you can see that
[1:33:50] eating is actually partaking in a
[1:33:52] spiritual sense
[1:33:54] so when these people were bowing to the
[1:33:56] images lighting candles using pagan
[1:34:01] holidays confessing their sins to men
[1:34:04] all of which belongs to the devil's
[1:34:07] religion that is strong they were
[1:34:11] partakers with the devil and not of the
[1:34:16] Lord they were in
[1:34:18] idolatry whether they admitted it or
[1:34:21] not they can talk all they want that the
[1:34:24] altars and the incense are only to
[1:34:27] remind them of the prayers of the Lord
[1:34:30] or whatever they think it means and they
[1:34:33] can say that when they pray before the
[1:34:36] image it is just for the sake of
[1:34:40] emphasis and that when they confess it
[1:34:43] to the priest it is really to God they
[1:34:47] are doing it in their
[1:34:49] hearts and when they say the priest
[1:34:51] forgives them
[1:34:53] it is just that he is doing it in the
[1:34:56] name of the Lord they can say what they
[1:35:00] want but they are partaking in the
[1:35:03] well-known Babylonian satanic religion
[1:35:07] and have joined themselves to idols and
[1:35:10] committed spiritual fornication which
[1:35:13] means
[1:35:14] death they are
[1:35:17] dead that's really
[1:35:19] hard because we know
[1:35:22] people we all know
[1:35:25] people that's what the prophet
[1:35:28] said it's what God Said through the
[1:35:30] prophet paragraph 226 so the church and
[1:35:33] the state were married the church joined
[1:35:35] up with Idols with the power of the
[1:35:38] state behind them they felt that now the
[1:35:41] kingdom of God had come and God's will
[1:35:45] had been enforced upon the Earth no
[1:35:48] wonder the Roman Catholic Church is not
[1:35:50] looking for the return of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:53] they not
[1:35:54] millennialist they have their Millennium
[1:35:57] right here the pope is reigning right
[1:36:00] now and God is reigning in him this is
[1:36:03] really harsh but it's
[1:36:06] true so when he comes according to them
[1:36:10] it has to be when the new heavens and
[1:36:13] the new Earth are prepared but they are
[1:36:16] wrong that Pope is the head of the false
[1:36:19] church and they are going to be huh and
[1:36:22] there there is going to be a millennium
[1:36:25] but while that is going on he won't be
[1:36:27] in it he will be somewhere
[1:36:30] else the warning repent or else I will
[1:36:35] come unto thee quickly and will fight
[1:36:37] against them with the sword of my mouth
[1:36:40] Revelations
[1:36:42] 2:16 what else can he say can God
[1:36:45] overlook the sin of those who have borne
[1:36:48] his name in vain there is only one way
[1:36:51] to receive Grace in The Hour of sin
[1:36:55] repent confess you are wrong come to God
[1:36:59] for
[1:37:00] forgiveness and for the spirit of
[1:37:03] God this is a command from God to
[1:37:06] disobey his death for he says I will
[1:37:10] make war with you with the sword of my
[1:37:13] mouth the Beast made war with the Saints
[1:37:17] but God will make war with the Beast
[1:37:21] those who fought the word will will one
[1:37:23] day find the word fighting
[1:37:26] them and that's even true today there's
[1:37:29] people that fight this word this message
[1:37:31] of the hour it is a serious thing to
[1:37:34] take from or add to the word of God for
[1:37:37] those who changed it and did with it as
[1:37:41] it suited them what will their end be
[1:37:44] but death and
[1:37:45] destruction but still the grace of God
[1:37:48] Cries Out repent aren't you thankful for
[1:37:51] the grace of God tonight oh how sweet
[1:37:54] are the thoughts of repentance nothing
[1:37:57] in my hands I bring simply to thy cross
[1:38:00] I cling I bring my sorrow I Repent that
[1:38:03] I am what I am and what I have done now
[1:38:07] it is the blood nothing but the blood of
[1:38:10] Jesus what will it be repentance or by
[1:38:14] the sword of death it's up to you my
[1:38:18] I'll call the musicians tonight I don't
[1:38:20] want to keep us late I know we're uh
[1:38:23] we're changing gears with our lives as
[1:38:25] we begin the school
[1:38:28] year I could go on but I just think it'd
[1:38:32] be better to maybe sing a few songs
[1:38:33] before we
[1:38:35] dismiss I just think it's fascinating
[1:38:37] this uh this word the exposition of the
[1:38:40] seven Church ages I've been so thrilled
[1:38:43] with it the Lord's just so wonderful and
[1:38:46] I know there's probably many different
[1:38:49] ways we can study it and uh probably
[1:38:51] different times we will but we we know
[1:38:53] that this is a summary of the message of
[1:38:55] the hour right here in this book maybe
[1:38:58] stand with me as we close
[1:39:02] tonight you can't have the doctrine of
[1:39:04] the
[1:39:05] nicians and not see the doctrine of
[1:39:08] bmismart
[1:39:24] and we're so thankful that you sent us a
[1:39:26] prophet Lord Jesus and we don't say that
[1:39:28] the prophet's word is your word what we
[1:39:30] do say is that that Prophet quoted your
[1:39:33] word and that Prophet points back to
[1:39:36] your word and that Prophet tied up all
[1:39:39] the loose ends in your word and all of
[1:39:42] the answers to those questions are found
[1:39:45] in your word they're not they're not
[1:39:47] from an outside Source they don't come
[1:39:49] from afar they're not some man's
[1:39:52] teaching they're your teaching Lord you
[1:39:55] the spirit of Truth and and we know
[1:39:57] that's the reason why the world rages
[1:40:00] against being baptized in your name
[1:40:03] because if someone can be baptized in
[1:40:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:40:08] the remission of their sins they can
[1:40:09] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:12] and when that Spirit comes in that
[1:40:14] Spirit your spirit your very life will
[1:40:17] lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:40:19] according to your word but the devil
[1:40:21] hates that thought because because once
[1:40:23] somebody is released from the bonds of
[1:40:25] Sin from a religious spirit we know the
[1:40:30] devil can't touch him so father tonight
[1:40:32] we pray that Lord we could just live our
[1:40:35] lives from the height of Grace and of
[1:40:38] love as we read about tonight Lord Jesus
[1:40:41] the way that you look upon us father
[1:40:43] help us to look upon one another help us
[1:40:45] to look upon ourselves Lord
[1:40:48] Jesus and father let it be repentance in
[1:40:51] our hearts Lord not the sword
[1:40:54] don't let us fall on the sword Lord
[1:40:56] Jesus but let us repent unto you we love
[1:40:59] you and we thank you we just want to
[1:41:01] commit each life into your hands For
[1:41:02] Your Glory now as we go our separate
[1:41:04] ways we just ask all these things in
[1:41:07] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] amen sing sing this
[1:41:15] song I hear the Savior
