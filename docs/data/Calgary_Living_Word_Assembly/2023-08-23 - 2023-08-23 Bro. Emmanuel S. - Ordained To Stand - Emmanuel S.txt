minutes we can get and I intend not to take too much time today so with the help of God um I'm not sure if the clicker is there I have all the quotes here though but they are always helpful praise the name of the Lord all right so we'll go into the scripture um there are quite a few uh prayer requests here um first of all sister Marion has a praise report I think she brought a prayer request for her mom and her testimonies that the mom is feeling well right now so may the name of the Lord be praised um yes I got a text from Brother Berry thank you my brother I got a text from Brother Berry and uh he sends his regards and apparently the time where he could just fly under the radar is done so they are putting him to work in Saskatoon he might be the pulpit by now yes but he sent around a request for a brother Caleb from Bible Believers assembly in New York I think he's a minister there and he's been diagnosed with the brain tumor and I think it is to be operated tomorrow morning and so let's pray for the large will to be done especially that like the wife says that this could be benign which is the best case scenario that we could wish for in such a situation yeah again we remember Zach brother Berry's nephew and the family as well so if you have any requests uplifted hand and let's go before him our precious Heavenly Father we thank you this evening for the privilege of gathering in your name we just want to lift up your name and praise you because every opportunity you give us oh Lord is an opportunity at eternal life Lord and so we just want to worship you father we don't know how many times how many more times will have these privileges oh Lord so father we just don't want to take any one of them for granted we invite your presence here this evening father that you come and bless your people who have assembled here father from the speaker to The Listener we all need you father we desire more of you we want to let go of our Humanity oh Lord that we could enter into the spirit and we receive of you but otherwise otherwise our Catherine will be in vain Lord we pray in Jesus Christ name that you bless your word for us oh Lord we pray that father you'll be with our pastor who is in Saskatoon father that you anoint him as well for your purpose days Saskatchewan our Lord bless Every Soul here and even whoever will be join us online further let your will be dying in our lives for that we just want to mention Marian and her Thanksgiving before you just as she brought the request she's here with Thanksgiving and I will believe that is what you desire so father may you continue to work on the mom oh Lord oh may you bless the mom and may you bless Marion as well who probably will be traveling very soon father Let Your Presence be with her as she goes and father order her path right that all that will be done will be pleasing to you merciful father we take the time to remember Zach pastor's nephew father may you be with him oh Lord may you be with the entire family oh Lord may you through this adversity show them that there is a living God who wants us prayer father manifest yourself oh God and let's hear this testimony and glorify you precious Lord we've mentioned brother Caleb in Bible Believers assembly in New York father we may never have met him but you know him and that is the goodness of you that that we we serve a living God who knows it all father visit the brother or Lord we know that you you understand why this had to happen father but in all things oh God make it oh lord for to your glory father that is what we desire for and we believe that it is your purpose oh Lord that this should happen father so father glorify yourself in whatever situation we we get in further right now father we submit the rest of the service into your hands we pray that you bless us Lord help me Father you know all my weaknesses father let's put that aside and let you take control in Jesus Christ name do we pray amen thank you very much uh let's go to Revelations 13. Revelations 13. um so Revelations 13 8. maybe I'll just read seven and eight all right Revelations 13 7 it says and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was giving him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated Hallelujah and so just before I care my I got this text from a friend and he's talking about all the disasters that are happening and like in the Pacific there is fire and then in the Atlantic there's rain like you have Maui and Kelowna and other parts of BC and Yellow knife and people are displaced and thousands are moved and then you go to the Atlantic and rain and floods and hurricane and Southern California there's an earthquake and so ah matters every time I think of these things or when these things happen I always think Lord be with the Believers there but it's always a confirmation of the fact that the word of God is true that the only shelter is in the Lord Jesus Christ that outside of that there is no hope anyway and so what we see an increase in the birth pains praise the name of the Lord aren't you glad that we have a shelter Hallelujah anyway it's great to worship a living God it has to come before him in sincerity just to come before him in humility just think of his greatness and his goodness and maybe our littleness before him and yet he cares for us and I I believe when you allow yourself without any inhibition and you contemplate on most of these things you end up really giving him back our gratitude because that is what it is there is nobody that we could go to and demand why didn't God do this or that and yet he cares for us he cares for every detail of our life praise the name of the Lord I know it sounds strange to begin with someone this way but that is what it is that he really cares Hallelujah and so every time we contemplate on him like this he responds He makes himself known when we are able to seal out the world and focus on him you will always meet him you will always see him why because he loves Fellowship praise the name of the Lord and that is how I want to start that the lord loves Fellowship I'm talking about ordained to stand or then to stand in this end time and the scripture says that the Lord laughs he dwells in the Praises of his people praise the name of the Lord and so even when they are not coming out of your lips even as you are meditating on him he still draws near praise the name of the Lord now I'm starting with this quote from says we will see Jesus all right says we will see Jesus brother Ram says the very word god means object of worship so God likes to be worshiped by his children that we can be free and not bound down in Yorks but we can exercise our faith in him and believe it and not be ashamed to tell the world about it that Jesus Christ raised from the dead lives and Reigns in our hearts and we are not ashamed of it doesn't make our face red to testify of the glory of Jesus Christ for he is worthy of all praise don't you believe that Hallelujah and so worship and tells far more than just singing in church right if you're looking through it exercising our faith believing him testifying not ashamed to to to talk about him all of that is part of worship and I believe everything we do in life that is consistent with scripture is part of worship praise the name of the Lord and so when you walk with people oh this is I believe in brother this is a sister we are all believers and they live a life as if they never had what the word said about what is going on what do you do you take a stand and you let it be known that for you that word means everything and when you do that what are you doing you are worshiping the Lord praise the name of the Lord halleluia every time we live according to our scriptural expectations what we are saying is the word means more to us than everything else when you live when you think when you say when you do and all is according to scripture you are worshiping but the other side of it is that when you know when they go on scriptural then you are also acknowledging the source of that influence and that influences not from God and so these are the things that we have to know because the devil is also actively seeking worship from us and that is precisely what I'm going to talk about today praise the name of the Lord now in Isaiah 14 the scripture says in Acts 14 13 it says for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the Stars praise the name of the Lord and that is the devil speaking right there but Abraham picks this up in the message uh the God of this evil age and then he says okay and then he says it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took two thirds two-thirds of the stars of Heaven ascended himself above those stars and preached them and deceived two-thirds of them you see it all right notice that's his ambition now it you see that it says it was Satan's ambition now he says that's his ambition now when we say ambition it's a strong desire and oftentimes you work to achieve it and the devil has not yet achieved that why worship entails um how would I say willingly and knowingly giving that worship but every time he has achieved worship it has been through deception and so he's never had true worship praise the name of the Lord and so that is now if you watch this it says for God it says he loves to be worshiped but for Satan says it's his ambition Hallelujah and so those are the differences that it's never a true worship Hallelujah and so we found out that the devil though has always thought our worship now I'm just sort of going on along those lines now in the handwriting on the wall program says everything that Satan has here on Earth is something that is perverted from God now even if you watch the previous uh code when it says it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped it's not the worship so much but to be worshiped like God that is the desire to be like God and so if God is worshiped then then they the devil the devil will also like to be worshiped not sure why I'm going this way um anyway I'll keep going the way I can okay yeah it's happening thank you yes this is everything Satan has on Earth it's something that is prevented from God God creates and Satan makes an imitation to race there is churches today on Earth great churches that's controlled by the devil it's a progression from the true church and so that is where we are now that if God has something if you see something genuine understand that the devil also has a counterfeit or sometimes in a lot of times the devil tries to present his counterfeit to us even before we meet the reality and so whatever you meet the basis of understanding and knowing what it is whether it's God seeking your worship or is the devil seeking your worship is to know how scriptural it is praise the name of the Lord and so angels of which the devil is part of were created by God and the express purpose was for worship Angels were created to be worshiped to worship God what happens the devil was able to prevent that worship and once he prevented that worship he diverted it into himself and so the Isaiah 14 that we read the scripture says that he raised his throne above the Stars now if you go into the Book of Genesis apart from the first uh chapter when the stars were created every reference to stars in Genesis is a reference to the descendants of Abraham Alleluia every reference is a reference to the descendants of Genesis and why am I saying all that the devil had two thirst of the angels and yet he was not satisfied he wanted more and so he raises thrown above the Earth all that is worshiped and that is uh the stress of Heaven now in Daniel and that is what we have there it says shine as the brightness of the firmament and did that turned many to righteousness as the Stars forever now I'm bringing these scriptures just to draw our attention who the focus of the devil's Pursuit is and that is you and I because everybody here who sees himself as a as a Seed of Abraham anybody here who has desired to see somebody see the light anybody who knows his day and his message anybody who is praying for somebody else to be saved is part of this group Hallelujah and this special group is what they want from the people from which the devil is seeking worship now it's easy for us to say well maybe we're not going to give it but it's not that easy it's easy to say that but it's not easy to do it why the devil will not come and say hey I'm a devil can you worship me yeah but it has happened before but that's not that the approach is always very deceptive and so that is where we have to Be watchful praise the name of the Lord because he's desperate for your worship and until he gets that he doesn't have true worship Hallelujah because we are the people giving willingly giving through worship Hallelujah now how does that happen every time the things that are very important to you those are the things that the devil will use and so that's why we have to be careful in our work in life we have to be careful in the things that we treasure and the things that we show to Value because there is where the devil will try to attack and I'm always a little unease when I use the word attack because yes that is what it is but it doesn't come out like that because a lot of times when you hear attack you're thinking of something active but no this is very subtle this is very smooth and still he desires that worship the Bible speaks of uh Lord's wife he says remember Lord's wife right while she was living what are the things that she treasure all her life was back there in Sodom her house was in flames her friends were inflamed her sons-in-laws were in Flames every property that she had in life was inflamed and all she did was turned once to look at it and that was all her Escape ended right there what am I saying when God calls you out of the bondage of sin what you realize is that you have to abandon every achievement that you get in the bondage of sin it's not worth hanging onto it it'll be a drug on you eventually if you're not careful that is what won't do you praise the name of the Lord now last time I stood here we're talking about Exodus 21 and in Exodus 21 we're talking about the Year of Jubilee and the fact that when uh uh you go into slavery and you are married you're going to slavery when you hear the Jubilee trumpet you are going out with your wife now when you go into slavery and your master gives you a wife when you hear the Jubilee trumpet you're going by your wife's teeth with your master now what happens if you have had children with your wife they also stay with the master now can you imagine the difficulty of the choice of either going free or staying a slave with all that you have now a lot of times most of us those are the choices that we face and that is what the devil does and so watch what he gives you in bondage because it will be a drag on you and if you are not careful that is how it is going to tie you down praise the name of the Lord now if we are not able to esteem the Lord and his Provisions above everything else we are not even free to begin with because freedom is when you've taken the word of God above everything else above logic because it doesn't make sense therefore for all that you have done the things that even you know are wrong to get to a point to say I'm forgiven how do you get there to say I'm forgiven unless the word of God means more to you than every logic then every reason praise the name of the Lord and so anyway the other side of it is if we assume God's riches above everything else then he rewards you Hallelujah and so I'm going to Mark 10 and I'm reading this to you I'm reading from 29. he says and Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto you there is no man that has left left house or Brethren or sisters or fathers or mothers or wife or children or lands for my sake and the Gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and Brethren and mothers mothers is plural and children and lands with persecutions I'm glad I underlined that in the world to come and in the world to come eternal life praise the name of the Lord now with persecutions a lot of times we ignore it but it's part of the scripture it's part of the life it's part of the Gospel it's part of the call you cannot give any great thing in Scripture we just don't have an adversity attach to it actually is the adversity that brings out the goodness of God now we can talk of Israel they hear the gospel they believe it they all come under the blood in Goshen and then they walk out in Freedom and then they go on and then they get to a place they get to the Red Sea now man is not made to walk on sin and man is not work to walk on dry land through sea so that initial was a bigger problem than everything but on top of that your Pharaoh's Army coming behind and imagine you have a process of a promise of God you are taking stuff and this is what you face where is the god right so it becomes very difficult that we have to understand this and this is something that I've just I'm looking at that that seed that sea was necessary for Israel why God had already done something to them from the moment they believed the word God had done something to them they cannot be drowned there is no record of anybody drowning no not once so they cannot be drawn but how would you know it unless you are face with a C but why the sea was necessary is this a just God wants to pass Israel through the sea and then pass their enemies and show them what he has made of them so they passed through it God delivers them the enemy passes through them the devil cannot deliver them what happened to the Hebrew children is it not the same they have to go into the fire the Lord permitted it you could have doubt the fire before they go in but he permitted for them to go in and then through that he destroys their enemies with the same fire Daniel wasn't that the same he had to go in first and then the enemies were put in to prove that yes this is what it is but I've changed you praise the name of the Lord when you receive God he changes you he has strengthens you he gives you the anointing to face the adversity at hand praise the name of the Living God and so this is what we are we are going on and so when I read this scripture what I thought was that there cannot be a better investment than this because the reward is twofold fresh right here on Earth a hundredfold and then eternal life praise the name of the Lord I say don't be worrying well doing don't despair when you do what even if you are not acknowledged glorify God because you did it for the sake of the Lord praise the name of the Lord and you see it's a God who will not ignore his word he will stand by it and he'll confirm it Hallelujah now um let's read a little further um I'll go to Second Thessalonians 2. a very popular scripture that we all know it says let no man deceive You by enemies for that they shall not come except they come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition who opposite and the soldiers himself above all that is called God all that is worshiped so that he as God seated in the temple of God showing himself that he is God this is the devil Desiring worship why would the devil sit in the temple and show himself as God of course the obvious we all know first of all he desires your worship otherwise he could also get a sample but no he wants to show himself that he is God he desires your worship that's why he's coming after but the second factor is the deception because if he comes as the devil he will never be accepted but you see I thank God so much that he raised a standard for his children Hallelujah so God in his fort by his foreign against the devil and all his devices not some not proud all the question is will the children take the standard will we adopt the standard praise the name of the Lord we know the devil has gone even before the Lord Jesus Christ to seek worship Hallelujah so nothing stops him from seeking your worship praise the name of the Lord and these are things that we have to always have in mind scared of you now he's not even scared of God just that he's been defeated Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord now you know he's seeking your worship Julio gave it to him are you going to give it to him that's the next question that we have to follow praise the name of the Lord now I will go on to something that brother Brown said about Saint Martin and I'm saying all of this to show you that there is a desperation in the Kingdom of the devil there's a desperation for worship he was created to worship he failed in his duty and now he decides to worship but now Saint Martin I think two outstanding things that Abraham says about Saint Martin that I thought it really caught my attention the first thing was Rebrand says he's a prophet now I've never heard him say that for all the reformers from the second to the sixth age before but the next thing he says is that since Jesus Christ he's not found a greater man dancing Martin and so that sort of got me really interested but then in the anointed ones at the end time anointed once at the end time he says this about Saint Martin he says I want to show you how deceiving the devil is one day he was sitting in a study talking about Saint Martin now upcoming a mighty Angel crowned on his head golden shoes on lays around his garments of gold and said Martin do you know me he said I'm your lord and savior I'm the one that saved you worship me Martin but that Prophet knowing there was a little something strange there he kept looking at him he said Martin I'm your savior Jesus Christ worship me don't you know me Martin Martin kept looking at him the scripture running through his mind he said Satan get away from me he said you got a crown on your head and the word of God says his sins will crown him at the End of the Age praise the name of the Lord now you can read this and think oh yeah as long as you know the scripture you are fine no you have to know the scripture for your day the reason is this in Revelations 14 the son of man has a crown of gold where he had been crowned already so you could read that and look and say oh yeah I've seen it in the Bible it's not enough praise the name of the Lord understand the scripture that is fulfilling in your day that is what matters praise the name of the Lord and so anyway now in the time of our Lord Jesus Christ we all know that the Sadducees were worshiping the Pharisees were worshiping and if you ask them they'll tell you they are worshiping God by the god they are worshiping was manifested in flesh and right in their midst and they were zealously persecuting him they were opposing him so the question is who were they worshiping now I'm I'm not going to try to answer but I know you know the answer but the god that claimed to be worshiping was right in front of them and when it comes to singing they could probably sing better than the apostles they had better buildings they were better dressed the high press was in the temple with them and yet they missed the gods that they claim to be worshiping think of it because asses happened then it's not very different from today and so you just take the scripture use it praise the name of the Lord because if all these denominations were not worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ even though they were more religious think of it what they were doing praise the name of the Lord now the devil had majority of the religious groups and yet he was not satisfied after he gets the chosen of God and that is why brother Brahm says something here in this position of the seven churches the pardonian church as he said but the devil is not content he hasn't achieved worship of himself yet except in an indirect way why indirect because it's true misrepresentation his post as God to deceive people and get worship our even when it's not true representation is true creation and so then it's not true worship and so he's still looking for it and he's looking for it from you and I now the scripture we research all World worship all will worship ah will bow down it means the man will worship and the women will worship it means the African would worship and the Caucasian will worship it means the Pentecostal will worship and the Cadillac will worship and the message believe I will worship but in all that the devil is not satisfied so the battle is for your worship and you are I are the target but as Jesus said to Peter once when he said uh the devil has such a 50 you like wheat but I said I have prayed for you halleluia and I believe today that what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for us is even more than what he did for Peter because what he's done for us is he secured our destiny Hallelujah from the Lamb's Book of Life where Abraham says for the gospel is delivered is good news and this morning or if you love me I'll say this evening the Holy Spirit through the word is bringing you the good news that from before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah all the Devils out of hell can't erase it out of there God's word has done spockets just as sure as it are just as sure to happen as God wrote it in there before the foundation of the world Amen how glorious our heavenly father is in his infinite love and his Mercy to do this for us praise the name of the Lord and so in a world where the devil has practically taken over through all the devices his seeking attention and when he gets attention he's seeking worship it could be through music it's a true fasciness through Sports through entertainment through the last whatever it is that he can when he's dominated everything God first made an exception Hallelujah and he made that exception from before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and not just that he's declared to us today praise the name of the Lord that we were elected to overcome Hallelujah that we were chosen not to be deceived praise the name of the Lord and he says God's word has done spoken Hallelujah now in the message power transformation says that God speaks into existence Hallelujah and so when you hear him the God who speaks into existence when you hear him say the things that he said to us hallelujah then you have to understand that it must of necessity come to pass you and I were spoken not to fall you and I were spoken in Victory praise the name of the Lord the Almighty has spoken Hallelujah and so it shall be even as he has declared and I like it when brother says nothing can stop it [Laughter] but Abraham says God's word has dance pockets now there was a time in the Bible and I often like to reference this that there was a time in the Bible when God called an 80 year young man Called Moses now this man was a measurer he had killed somebody in the most powerful country on Earth at that time and he was on the Run and then God's word comes to him now when God was God's word came to him it said Moses you are going back to that country think of it but you are not going to sneak in no you are actually going to go boldly to the Palace you are going before pharaoh and not just that you are going to tell him that the source of your riches the source of the two million cheap or free labor that you have the people that used to build Ramses and all these big cities and all these great projects they have a God he desires worship and so I'm taking all of them to go and worship him that's what you're going to do and yet Moses obeyed why oh thank God for a a religious mother praise the name of the Lord the word was in him already but look at this that when God spoke these words God did not have any doubt God has never doubted his own word and so when he spoke to him he said when you go after you've brought them out he said when you bring them out so God knew that he was going and he was going to bring them out and that nothing was going to stand in the way so he says when you bring them out let them worship me here on this mountain not because God had faith in his word as he spoke to Moses that same Faith came on Moses and so Moses also had absolutely no doubt that he was going in and he was coming out praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah and so that is that when God speaks it it has to happen brother sister he has spoken about us he spoke about a bride we are here Hallelujah now many instances speaks about an event in California where he went to preach and he preached hard and after he finished a brother put his hands around him and prayed for him and so as he tried to pray for brother Abraham he spoke in French you've all heard of it and so a man who has never spoken in French spoken French and just for us to know that it was God there happens to be adaptation three people of very varied backgrounds who didn't know each other one was the French translator in the White House the other was a French translator for the United Nations the other was just a French person and then they all had it and not just that if somebody is praying what makes it come to your mind to take a pen and paper and translate it but three different people right at that instant translated it and when they presented it as exactly word by word and but Abraham kept the original copy and that is what I want to read to you here he says oh this is because that has chosen the Narrow Path the Hardaway thou has walked in your own chosen that has picked the correct and precise decision it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass that tremendous victory in love divine now every time brother Abraham mentions this and it speaks about thou has worked in your own chosen he points out that he could have chosen a different path so God does not ignore his word the free moral agency is an early level of life and that is why we need to always constantly keep talking and keep strengthening ourselves and keep encouraging ourselves and keep on because you every step of the way your free moral agency so we have to get used to choosing God's way Hallelujah and so it's his own chosen then he says it is my way and that's what I want us to understand when you listen to this message it is God's way when you believe and leave this message it is God's way Hallelujah and especially for you and I he sent a messenger to tell us that it is his way why we are his choice praise the name of the Lord so yes it is the harder way it is the narrow way it is the proven way but it is the Vindicated way and it is God's word hallelujah and so when the Devil comes in like a flood well we have been ordained to stand where is everybody's bowing to the devil in the world whether they know it or not we have been called to stand Hallelujah and this is what I want us to focus on I can mentioned at time that the Lord Jesus Christ is with the disciples and a big campaign is over and then Jesus speaks to them says let us go over to the other side Hallelujah let us go over to the other side and so they're going and then the winds come and the storm comes and the waves come and this little Versace all over and then fear sets in that is human reaction but the truth of the matter is the Lord has already spoken praise the name of the Lord it was not a prediction it was not a suggestion when God speaks it has to happen that is why I'm saying he has spoken about us praise the name of the Lord so it's for us still we have three more Legacy but we for us to step into our calling Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Malachi 4 spoke about us Revelations 10 1 7 spoke about us Luke 17 30 speaks about us it is still speaking what am I saying you are here as the Fulfillment of the spoken word praise the name of the Lord that's why I take the Liberty to mention these things Hallelujah let's keep focused Hallelujah the Rapture is already spoken the marriage supplies already spoken the Millennium is already spoken the white strong judgment is already spoken New Jerusalem is already spoken praise the name of the Lord and so nothing's going to change it we can debate it oh yeah the Rapture is not in the Bible and all that the word is not all right God has already spoken our faith only makes it inherited but that is not needed for it to happen the only necessary condition is God has already spoken now I want to share this quote we're just from the Lamb's Book of Life says the same time that Christ that God said Christ will be slain he wrote your name with his and says hallelujah there you are the day I read this I thought isn't that a way to frustrate the devil Hallelujah because you see when he says he wrote your name with his his that is God's that is the Lord Jesus Christ isn't he the Rock of Ages his friend is a movable he's unchangeable but remember it's not that just that it's in eternity praise the name of the Lord so in the circle of Eternity there is a blip called time but just before that God makes sure that his own will not be lost he writes your name with his at the beginning and then he writes your name with his at the end so regardless of what happens in between we know your future is secured and we have the added benefit that he sends the prophet to tell us so now we recognize who we are Hallelujah you know um we went to uh I think Sunday evening at home we the children brought this book know that they ten years ago when but I can took all of us to rafter six that that result it was a nice time and there were some good stories there but um so we watched and we're looking at the children and how much they've grown and all that but for me one of the greatest tourists from after six was the zipline um well when they were doing it I was on frame ground so I I could see things right but I there are people who went on there which if if they had been given the possibility Midway through they would have gone back they would have easily given their money and just gone back but they didn't allow them so they kept going because it was scary and it was wobbly and all that but you see for the guides they were not bothered they were not worried because they knew that they hold the entire thing has been tested Hallelujah and it has been uncut and so though it will be wobbly in the middle it's bound to end Hallelujah I understand the brother and sister the Lord has anchored and secured our future praise the name of the Lord so the moment God speaks your name or the moment you recognize yourself in the scripture you understand that the bride is part of the written word and when we recognize our position and we take it now for the bride the only position is in the Lord Jesus Christ now what is the position of the devil in reference to the Lord Jesus Christ under his feet so whatever the position you have in the Lord Jesus Christ if you recognize it and you take it the devil is under your feet and that is what he hates that's why he'll do everything possible to distract you from recognizing Who You Are and that's what God has also taken it upon himself to manifest in this time to tell you that you are his praise the name of the Lord so regardless of what Miracles regardless of what Vindication yes we love the Miracles they are part of the scripture without the supernatural the scripture is just anything else and so yes the Supernatural is part of the scripture but our joy the source of our joy the course of our joy it's not all the Vindication that we can see in terms of Miracles it's in the fact that there is a word written about us and that word is written in eternity and so there's nothing the devil can do in time to undo what was written in eternity praise the name of the Lord before the foundation of the world halleluia now if there is a man in Scripture that I always like to liken to the devil it is human in the Book of Esther for me he he represents the essence of everything that the devil is and time wouldn't permit us to go through it all hey man was a man who had the worship of everybody apart from one person now if you have the worship of everybody in the Kingdom shouldn't you be satisfied no not hey man and that's the situation of the devil and so he'll fight it and we'll fight it until it ends he himself and we know that there was end praise the name of the Lord and so Mordecai wouldn't worship not because he dislikes him and no not because he wants to challenge the Lord no not because he wants to disobey no but because he understood that he has a role to play in the plan of God for that moment and brother sister we have a role to play praise the name of the Lord we have been called to be his bride we have been called to be his representative we have been called to be his ambassadors we have been called to be his lips and hands and feet right here on Earth right now we have a role to play and when we recognize to around Europe you recognize how important it is then everything else will lose its value and you focus on who you are that's why the program says when the right remembers uh recognizes who she is then the Rapture will happen Hallelujah and so he recognized his position in the grand scheme of things and you see God always reserves a people for himself as a witness Hallelujah and we are that people tonight yes Hallelujah so in a world where people are busy worshiping riches where these people are busy seeking power worshiping fashion and lust and seeking popularity you are called to take a stand but you are not just called to take it and you were ordained for that Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord now because we're ordained for that when you take your position when you take a stand as a young man at school and you'll be going very soon when you take a stand you become annoying to the devil you become an irritant to the devil but it's all right continue take the stand face the obstacle because there is a testimony right at the corner listen the God you are taking the Stanford will never leave you he'll never leave you yes we have a fast food mentality we want Justice now that is not God's way but if you are patient and if we stand on the scripture then God will always prove himself faithful to you Hallelujah and so it's up to our position and take it and use it Hallelujah because every time that the devil sees you it reminds him that he has failed right that's why the fight of Mordecai did to himan it reminded him of his ambition and the fact that he has failed and so he kept at it and kept at it until it destroyed him Hallelujah so our position right now is not because we are wise it's not because we are smart it's not because we have put in so much effort it's not none of that but it's because God has done pockets to use brother Abraham's language yes so it's something that is already atone for hallelujah it's something that's already paid for it's a finished work praise the name of the Lord and the worst for the devil right now in this age is that we know it we recognize it because God has taken it upon himself to declare it to us praise the name of the Lord I'm reading this oh how did it go that far all right I'll just read it for you this is the infallible proof of Resurrection program says and when God wants thought of how he would make the Plan of Redemption and how he'll redeem months by far knowledge knowing that someone desire it and some will be redeemed he thought of the plan and then he spoke the word it was already a finished work in heaven when God spoke it hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and so I I had little references to Daniel and to the Hebrews remember we all know that Hallelujah we all know that and so I'll just keep going that all these were just how would I say a shadow of our reality all of that spoke of us today praise the name of the Lord and so that is what we have to understand that when we see them and they're making laws because that's what they did to Daniel and so when we see them and they are making laws and they're doing this and and and it's all targeting us there used to be a time when people had real opinion and they could express whether good or bad it's not there anymore there used to be a time where you could meet a person and you see the person you see how they're dressed you hear their voice you can say fair and you will be right to then I have to teach around and say how would you want to be called and sometimes some will say they like one person is standing there and they are plural and you better not complain so understand that these things are targeting us it was to get us to to violate the loss of our God is to get us to disobey God what they don't realize is that the relationship between God and his bride is a relationship of love it's a relationship of trust praise the name of the Lord It's a relationship it's the product of a finished work Hallelujah it has already been spoken and we are stepping into it praise the name of the Lord and so this is what I came to say hallelujah praise the name of the Lord there will it's not going to get any better as we see it now the laws they come one by one and so it's as if you you don't really see it body keeps on and on and on and then very soon we find ourselves completely isolated we'll find ourselves completely surrendered but we have a word for that is the name of the Lord the Lord says when it comes to that it says look up for your Redemption is not Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord now the other thing I just want to bring to attention as I'm getting ready to close is that God has called you and I and he has entrusted us with his own weapons of warfare and it is designed to overcome the conditions of today now we all know the devil had the opportunity to to to tempt the Lord Jesus Christ our Lord came in flesh he was tempted so the word point he's given us which is the revealed word of the hour that weapon is tried and it's already proven it's already defeated the devil and that's what is handed to us factors do we recognize the value of what we have because if we recognize it we will constantly and continuously use it I liked the brother making that reference that there is probably a problem there in the church it says read the message Hallelujah because the answers are there if God calls you and you find your place whatever problem you have the answer is right there at that position already just assuming your position in the day in in Jesus places the devil under you which means it places lust under you he places All the gossip under you he places lies under you he places cheating under you it places all every device under you all we need to accept that this is us so we go beyond confessing it and actually live it praise the name of the Lord and so uh okay the evening messenger brother says here we are end time red light down flashing coming of the Lord is Satan yes sir listen the end time message should meet end time conditions where they've got off the message ought to bring it back where they go off what brings it back the message Believers will say Amen where their lives well he said that but let's no no he says the message ought to bring it back praise the name of the Lord always end time message means end time condition praise the name of the Lord and so there's an anointing on the message for the conditions of today Hallelujah and it's ensure that the bride overcomes the professions of today Hallelujah now that anointing on the message will not lose its power that anointing will not fail the revealed word of Malachi 4 will fulfill the purpose for which it was sent because it's God's word and God speaks into existence Hallelujah and so first of all it was sent to Equippers to overcome loudisha second it is to prepare us for the rapture and it shall not fail Hallelujah I'll call the musicians as I read this last quote because understand it when you recognize your position what the devil does is to get you to look at yourself instead of the word but we have nothing to do with it the Lord already Blaze the path and invited us into reach look at something the word was spoken about him before he was born he has so many weaknesses he has short for us he'll fall in love with the wrong woman and say what he's not supposed to say it didn't stop him from fulfilling the purpose for which he was called it was you see when God speaks and we say oh man was too weak or this and so man failed it means God has failed and God does not fail God does not repent God does not change his mind and so what God has said he will watch over it to fulfill it so you and I are then to stand today praise the name of the Lord let me just read this last one and then we are done and God never did deal with Israel oh yes I like this because it appears that Abraham sort of took out the gloves a little bit God never did deal with Israel until she come to her Homeland hear me that says the Lord God will not deal with his chair till she comes back to the Homeland the message of the hour Hallelujah where is the Homeland the message of the hour praise the name of the Lord and they say come back to the original get away from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian ideas your Pentecostal assemblies Oneness threateness fiveness whatever it is Church of God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church of Christ all Antichrist movements such a comment will not be easily come to dance in Canada like your condemning all these denominations who Do You Think You Are I'm the chosen of the Lord is the name of the Lord and I realize this strikes the world all wrong all of the devil oh my there's Godly men in every one of them there's godly people in every one of their movements but the organization in itself is not of God and God will never bless us he never has done it praise the name of the Lord hallelujah let's stand on our feet [Music] and we think I'm God in Jesus a bit of a quicker pace [Music] upon lies
