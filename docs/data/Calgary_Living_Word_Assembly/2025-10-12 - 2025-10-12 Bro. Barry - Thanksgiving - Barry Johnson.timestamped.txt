[36:35] &gt;&gt; Happy Thanksgiving to each and everyone.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; We are serving a living God.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; He always obeys his promise. Winter time
[36:43] he brings snow. Here we are.
[36:47] He said he's going to send rainbow to
[36:49] remind us every time we see rainbow.
[36:51] That is the God that we serve.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for prayer. Our
[36:56] precious heavenly father,
[36:59] covenant keeping God. You never change
[37:03] what you said. But we change
[37:06] &gt;&gt; when you haven't done it. We don't have
[37:08] faith. We don't have patience to wait
[37:11] upon you. But whatever you said you
[37:14] would do, you always do it.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; We want to thank you. That gives us an
[37:18] assurance that we are serving a living
[37:21] God.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we are in your
[37:23] presence again.
[37:25] We've come from all walks of life. We've
[37:28] come with all manners of thanksgiving to
[37:32] give to you this morning. We've also
[37:35] come with all manners of situations,
[37:39] whether good or bad, to come and bring
[37:42] it to you this morning. And it is my
[37:44] prayer that this morning, Father, you
[37:47] move from person to person this morning.
[37:49] You move from pew to pew this morning,
[37:52] Lord. Those that came with thanksgiving,
[37:55] would you receive it this morning? Those
[37:58] that came to ask you to do something for
[38:00] them, would you do it for them this
[38:03] morning? Father,
[38:05] we want to thank you once again, Lord,
[38:08] that this morning we've been able to
[38:09] drive from our homes to come into your
[38:12] house to have a fellowship with you this
[38:15] morning. I pray that Lord Jesus this
[38:18] morning, you come to speak to us
[38:21] individually.
[38:24] Come talk to us according to our needs
[38:27] and according to our faith. This morning
[38:30] once again, our pastor has liberted to
[38:33] bring your word. Lord,
[38:35] may that word that you have given to him
[38:39] find a resting place in our souls, in
[38:41] our hearts this morning. Father, this
[38:44] morning we want to commit each and
[38:46] everyone that is not even here this
[38:48] morning into your hands.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Those that have traveled, Father, may
[38:53] you be with them. May you grant them
[38:55] travel mercy when they are going and may
[38:57] you bring them back when they are
[38:59] coming.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; When we all come together, we shall be
[39:02] careful to give you thanks. Father, this
[39:04] morning we are also bringing our tithes
[39:06] and offering to your house. We ask you
[39:08] to bless it, sanctify it for in Jesus
[39:11] name that this morning we pray. Amen.
[39:13] Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing we for uh sorry above
[39:20] all powers number 1094.
[39:24] Above all powers,
[39:29] above all kings,
[39:34] above all nature
[39:37] and all created things.
[39:43] of all wisdom
[39:47] and all the ways of man.
[39:54] You were here before the world began.
[40:02] Crucified
[40:04] [Music]
[40:07] behind the storm.
[40:10] We live
[40:12] to die.
[40:15] rejected and alone
[40:18] like a rose
[40:21] trampled on the ground.
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:26] You took my fall
[40:30] and thought of me.
[40:35] My home
[40:39] above all king,
[40:43] above all,
[40:46] [Music]
[40:48] above all,
[40:51] the world is the approach.
[40:55] [Music]
[41:00] My treasures are
[41:07] the way to
[41:12] [Music]
[41:15] cross.
[41:20] Maybe I sle.
[41:25] [Music]
[41:35] All the ground
[41:40] [Music]
[41:50] crucified for you.
[41:56] [Music]
[42:01] You live
[42:03] down
[42:06] rejected
[42:07] alone by the cross.
[42:12] Travel on the ground.
[42:17] You touch
[42:21] when you thought of me.
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anybody take your seats? We have
[42:31] two s uh two specials today. Brother Don
[42:34] can come up as we just sing that uh
[42:36] chorus once again. And then sister
[42:38] Michelle's going to sing as well. So as
[42:40] we just sing this verse, brother Don can
[42:41] come up. You were crucified.
[42:47] Oh, laid behind the storm.
[42:51] You lay to die.
[42:56] Rejected and low
[42:59] like a rose
[43:03] trembled on the ground.
[43:06] [Applause]
[43:08] You took my
[43:12] and you thought of me.
[43:21] Amen. Lord bless you all this morning.
[43:24] Since it's Thanksgiving weekend, it's I
[43:28] just started thinking about all the
[43:29] things that I'm thankful for.
[43:32] And it all boiled down to one
[43:35] main thing. I'm so thankful for be born
[43:38] again and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[43:42] This is called When the Lord Takes His
[43:44] Place.
[43:46] I was sitting at the table with my Bible
[43:50] open wide.
[43:53] Life was full of motions, but no real
[43:56] peace inside. Then the still small voice
[44:00] came softly said,
[44:03] "Son, it's time to see. I can't be Lord
[44:06] of all till I'm Lord inside of thee."
[44:11] It wasn't in the thunder,
[44:14] nor a far off mountain flame, but in a
[44:17] whispered moment the Savior called my
[44:20] name. He said, "I've walked beside you
[44:24] amidst the storms and witnessed your
[44:26] best, but I can only move through hands
[44:29] and hearts that give me rest."
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] So I bowed my head in reverence,
[44:36] laid my burdens at his feet,
[44:40] and I told him, "Take the whole thing,
[44:42] Lord. My heart, my work,
[44:46] &gt;&gt; my seat."
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Then he turned the smallest action,
[44:52] disobedience in prayer
[44:55] into peace that filled my spirit like
[44:58] fresh heaven in the air.
[45:01] I thought of brother Brham in that
[45:02] canyon, calm and still.
[45:06] When the voice said, "Pick up a rock,
[45:09] son, and cast it where I will." He
[45:12] didn't question reasons. He didn't
[45:14] argue. He didn't doubt.
[45:17] He tossed that little stone. And God
[45:19] himself broke out. The skies rolled back
[45:23] in glory. The judge descended near. A
[45:26] ring of holy cloud appeared. And the
[45:29] devil stood in fear. I learned right
[45:32] there the secret.
[45:34] What true face meant to be.
[45:37] When a man moves by God's own leading he
[45:40] parts the sea for thee. It ain't in
[45:43] mighty thunderings nor shouting loud and
[45:46] strong. It's in the quiet yielding
[45:49] where our will no more belongs. For
[45:52] every promise written,
[45:54] he's waiting on our yes. One step in
[45:58] faith from mortal man brings heaven's
[46:00] righteousness.
[46:02] I see him in the morning when my job
[46:04] comes into view. And each moment and
[46:07] decision he's revealing what to do. For
[46:10] when a heart turns heavenward and gives
[46:13] him room to reign, the simple acts of
[46:16] daily life shine forth like golden
[46:18] green.
[46:20] Shortly when he comes in glory in that
[46:23] great eternal light, I know I'll know
[46:26] him by his presence that already ruled
[46:29] my night.
[46:31] For the Lord took his position, not
[46:34] afar, but close and near, when no man
[46:37] obeyed the whisper, and the word was
[46:40] made clear. Or bless you all.
[46:43] [Applause]
[47:10] God bless you. Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Singing, but I just want to praise the
[47:15] Lord this morning
[47:17] with a very thankful heart for all his
[47:19] blessings
[47:21] and for all he's done for us.

[52:55] All of my days.
[52:58] Oh, I want to praise

[53:04] [Music]
[53:07] love.

[54:32] I have.
[54:34] Oh, nothing compares to the proise I
[54:39] have. Oh, in you.
[54:46] Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, and holy, holy,
[54:52] holy
[54:54] are you, Lord.
[54:57] [Applause]
[55:01] Singing,
[55:02] "Holy, holy,
[55:06] holy
[55:07] are you, Lord.
[55:15] Holy elders and angels
[55:20] found
[55:23] the redeemer
[55:25] worship you now.
[55:30] Holy, holy,
[55:33] holy
[55:35] are you Lord.
[55:38] Amen. As we ask brother Barry to come
[55:40] forward. Let's sing that again. Singing
[55:44] holy, holy,
[55:47] holy
[55:48] are you Lord.
[55:55] Oh sing.
[55:58] Holy, holy,
[56:00] holy
[56:02] are you Lord.
[56:10] Holy elders and angels.
[56:17] All the redeemed
[56:19] we worship you now.
[56:25] Holy, holy,
[56:28] holy
[56:30] are you Lord. Let's see him one more
[56:33] time.
[56:36] Oh, singing
[56:38] holy, holy,
[56:41] holy
[56:43] are you.
[56:46] [Music]
[56:50] Oh, sing.
[56:52] Holy, holy,
[56:55] holy
[56:57] are you.
[57:05] We are
[57:12] the redee.
[57:13] We worship you now.
[57:19] Holy, holy,
[57:22] holy
[57:26] Lord.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[57:30] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Certainly an honor and a privilege to
[57:35] gather together one more time in his
[57:38] name.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; The way that he's ordained for this age,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; the age in which we live. We just have
[57:46] one request this morning that we'd like
[57:48] to bring before the throne
[57:51] and that is for the hostages that are in
[57:54] Nigeria.
[57:56] There's trickles of information that are
[57:58] coming and I'm sure it's not enough
[58:02] for the families and those people
[58:03] affected, but we certainly stand with
[58:06] them and we trust the Lord is in
[58:07] control.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Just want to remember them today in
[58:11] prayer and all the people affected by it
[58:14] as well. If you have a need this
[58:15] morning, maybe just make it known unto
[58:18] him by the way of an uplift hand as we
[58:19] go to him in prayer.
[58:22] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this
[58:24] morning, we thank you, Lord, for all
[58:26] that you've done for us.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, for all that
[58:31] you're going to do. We know that there's
[58:34] many promises that still lie in store
[58:36] for us, Lord, and we thank you for them.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, we thank you for what
[58:42] you're doing right now. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Even in this service, Lord Jesus, in our
[58:47] lives, Father, in our homes,
[58:50] &gt;&gt; we know that you're in complete control.
[58:51] And we thank you for that, Lord.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we just want to
[58:56] ask, Lord, that we could continue to
[58:58] thank you for delivering those folks who
[59:01] are held captive, Lord Jesus.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[59:05] &gt;&gt; by those people in Nigeria. We know that
[59:08] you said yourself that Lord Jesus, you
[59:11] will set the captives free.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; That you will truly deliver those who
[59:17] are in bondage.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to thank you
[59:20] now. We've asked you before and we just
[59:22] want to thank you now. We want to
[59:24] confess, Lord Jesus,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; the full complete deliverance of these
[59:28] people.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the one thing that we do
[59:32] desire isn't retribution.
[59:34] We desire that the people who have done
[59:36] this, Lord, could perhaps come to know
[59:38] you in the power of your resurrection
[59:41] through this, Lord.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Father, we just know that the the
[59:45] believers are always persecuted in every
[59:48] single age. It's no different today. But
[59:51] Lord, we know that you are greater than
[59:53] any persecutor could ever be on this
[59:55] earth. For we wrestle not against flesh
[59:58] and blood, Lord Jesus. It's it's a
[1:00:00] spiritual battle and we know that you've
[1:00:02] already won it and we declare that in
[1:00:05] Jesus name.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And father this morning we just want to
[1:00:08] ask Lord that you would minister to each
[1:00:10] and every need that was made known unto
[1:00:13] you
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; by the way of an uplift hand. Father
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; we know that you're more than able to
[1:00:18] meet the needs in the hearts of your
[1:00:19] children.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever the need is, whatever the
[1:00:23] circumstance, whatever the situation,
[1:00:26] you are our tower of refuge, Lord. And
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're more than
[1:00:31] able to deliver us from evil. You're
[1:00:34] able to bind up the brokenhearted, Lord.
[1:00:37] There's nothing too great for you. We
[1:00:39] just commit the needs into your hands
[1:00:41] now for your glory, Lord. And as we turn
[1:00:44] our eyes to your word, Father, we just
[1:00:46] pray that you would break it fresh to us
[1:00:49] once again, Lord. We love you, Father,
[1:00:51] and we thank you for your goodness to
[1:00:53] us, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:00:56] pray.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[1:01:02] God bless you this morning. If you have
[1:01:03] your Bibles, I would just like to read a
[1:01:06] couple scriptures out of Exodus chapter
[1:01:08] 12. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Might sound like a
[1:01:13] strange scripture for a Thanksgiving
[1:01:15] service, but I believe we have lots to
[1:01:19] be thankful for in the day in which we
[1:01:20] live.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Exodus 12 verse 12.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] says, "For I will pass through the land
[1:01:38] of Egypt this night and will smite all
[1:01:42] the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both
[1:01:44] man and beast,
[1:01:48] and against all the gods of Egypt.
[1:01:52] And I will execute judgment.
[1:01:55] I am the Lord."
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] And the blood shall be to you for a
[1:02:02] token upon the houses where ye are.
[1:02:08] And when I see the blood,
[1:02:11] I will pass over you.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; And the plague shall not be upon you to
[1:02:17] destroy you.
[1:02:19] And when I smite when I smite the land
[1:02:22] of Egypt, sorry. And this day shall be
[1:02:24] unto you for a memorial, and ye shall
[1:02:28] keep it a feast to the Lord throughout
[1:02:31] your generations.
[1:02:33] Ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance
[1:02:37] forever.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[1:02:42] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:02:43] your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; it's not just a word for the land of
[1:02:48] Egypt and the children of Israel, but
[1:02:50] it's very much applicable for us in the
[1:02:52] day in which we live.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that you would just
[1:02:56] help us, Lord, by your word to by your
[1:03:00] spirit, Father, to take this word and
[1:03:01] bring it to life once again, Father.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; That it would be by your spirit
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; that we're gathered together.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. You
[1:03:14] may be seated.
[1:03:16] Certainly like to welcome all of our
[1:03:18] visitors.
[1:03:19] Brother Bon Bonav
[1:03:23] Benu and family.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Did I say that right?
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I apologize.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And uh Sister Haley's parents are with
[1:03:33] us again. God richly bless you.
[1:03:35] Certainly thankful that you're with us.
[1:03:41] It's amazing how uh how it works. It
[1:03:44] seems the many people in the church go
[1:03:47] away for a holiday and uh come to church
[1:03:51] thinking I wonder how many people are
[1:03:52] going to be there and you can see the
[1:03:54] church is almost you know full again.
[1:03:57] It's amazing how the Lord does things.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Are you happy today?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Today we uh we just want to get into
[1:04:06] talking about a little bit of
[1:04:07] thanksgiving. It's a Thanksgiving
[1:04:09] weekend and we have a lot to be thanks
[1:04:12] thank thankful for during this season I
[1:04:15] believe. And uh I just was looking at
[1:04:19] this and you know I trust it's okay that
[1:04:22] we could look at it from the perspective
[1:04:23] of Exodus 12. I know this is the the
[1:04:27] Passover meal and we know this is
[1:04:29] actually a type of the communion and I
[1:04:31] don't want to go that far with it to try
[1:04:34] and make the two the same because
[1:04:35] they're not. But I think there's
[1:04:37] something interesting in our scripture
[1:04:38] here that I just felt led to to get into
[1:04:42] a little bit, you know, and uh you know,
[1:04:45] looking at the very first scripture that
[1:04:46] we read in in Exodus 12, I will pass
[1:04:49] through the land of Egypt this night.
[1:04:51] This is truly the Lord Jesus speaking.
[1:04:53] This isn't just uh another angel. It's
[1:04:56] not some other third person or second
[1:04:58] person of of a holy trinity. It it's not
[1:05:01] just a messenger. This is actually God
[1:05:05] himself. I will pass through the land of
[1:05:07] Egypt this night and will smite the
[1:05:09] firstborn. And we know that this this is
[1:05:12] actually the destroyer. It's been called
[1:05:13] the destroyer angel. And you know,
[1:05:16] anybody that receives the word of God
[1:05:19] has no fear of this angel. Anybody that
[1:05:21] applied the word in in the way it was
[1:05:24] given in the way they lived in that day.
[1:05:26] Anybody who just accepted the word of
[1:05:28] the prophet the way the prophet gave it
[1:05:30] to them without interpreting it and
[1:05:32] saying that I've got something that I
[1:05:34] need to try and mingle with it my own
[1:05:36] way. Those ones had no fear.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to worry because they
[1:05:42] came under the blood. And I think it's
[1:05:45] beautiful how the next scripture it
[1:05:47] says, "And the blood shall be to you a
[1:05:50] token."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a token to him.
[1:05:55] It was given as a token to you.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; They were given something that they
[1:06:01] could actually stake their salvation on.
[1:06:05] They were given something that they
[1:06:06] could stake their security on.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; And it was following the word of the v
[1:06:12] already now vindicated prophet in the
[1:06:14] day in which they lived, wasn't it?
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; They saw all the plagues that happened
[1:06:19] when Moses first came back. They said,
[1:06:21] "Who are you? And where do you come
[1:06:23] from? We know you. You're a murderer.
[1:06:26] You're a traitor. Your parents threw you
[1:06:28] away. Instead of giving you to the
[1:06:30] crocodiles like all the rest of us, we
[1:06:32] had to give away our firstborn.
[1:06:35] All of our children were given to the
[1:06:36] crocodiles. But you, you're a special
[1:06:38] boy. You were actually saved for some
[1:06:42] reason. And now you go and murder
[1:06:43] someone and run away and hide and come
[1:06:46] back and think you're going to find
[1:06:47] favor with us. Can you imagine the
[1:06:49] amount of of stigma that must have been
[1:06:51] in that man's life? All those meal time
[1:06:54] conversations, the families talking
[1:06:56] about this guy coming back saying, "Thus
[1:06:59] sayaith the Lord." He He sent me here to
[1:07:01] actually bring you out.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; I know I might have been a little bit of
[1:07:05] a skeptic
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; based on everything I heard. But it
[1:07:08] doesn't change the fact that God chooses
[1:07:10] a man
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; and gives him a message.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And now we're not talking about
[1:07:14] individual men and and pastors and
[1:07:16] preachers. We're talking about very
[1:07:18] specific age messengers.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. prophets of God because any
[1:07:24] man could have a message from God. In
[1:07:27] fact, we all should have a message from
[1:07:30] God. We all should be able to hear the
[1:07:33] voice of God in our own lives.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; But talking about this here, if we have
[1:07:39] the blood, if we take the prophet's word
[1:07:42] and apply the blood the way that we're
[1:07:44] supposed to, you know, everyone could
[1:07:46] have had blood. Just to be clear, some
[1:07:49] people could have had blood and put it
[1:07:50] in a little cup
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; on the step. We talked about this in the
[1:07:54] past. You know, it's probably pretty
[1:07:56] warm and moist there. They're very close
[1:07:57] to the ocean, right? The Mediterranean
[1:08:00] Sea. And and and the Nile River is
[1:08:03] probably quite humid. And to have a
[1:08:04] little bit of blood and and to put it on
[1:08:06] the side of the building, it might have
[1:08:07] attracted a lot of flies.
[1:08:10] It might have not been a very clean
[1:08:12] thing. In fact, I think in the land of
[1:08:14] Egypt, a little bit of blood on open
[1:08:15] display was probably sacriiggious
[1:08:19] according to the Egyptians.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; It probably was something that wasn't a
[1:08:24] very nice thing according to the
[1:08:26] traditions of the day.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; But that didn't change the fact that was
[1:08:29] thus saith the Lord by God through his
[1:08:32] prophet to his people.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And now the people had the opportunity
[1:08:36] to decide that I'm going to follow that
[1:08:38] prophet's word to the letter. Why?
[1:08:41] because my children's life they they
[1:08:44] they depend on it.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; The firstborn in the land depends on it.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Now we could look at it this way. Who
[1:08:51] would be the firstborn in the land? Is
[1:08:53] it just children?
[1:08:55] It's a very broad statement, isn't it?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Because there's many adults who are
[1:08:59] firstborn.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; There could be fathers. There could be
[1:09:03] mothers. There could be aunts and uncles
[1:09:04] and grandparents. There could be a lot
[1:09:07] of firstborn in the land. It's not just
[1:09:09] a family with a husband and a wife and
[1:09:11] their first little baby is the one
[1:09:13] that's going to go. No, no, no. That's
[1:09:14] what Pharaoh did. God's judgment was
[1:09:17] executing firstborn judgment.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And it was upon every single one in the
[1:09:22] land.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; But for those people that took the word
[1:09:27] of the prophet to the letter,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; they weren't willing to mingle with it.
[1:09:31] They weren't willing to compromise with
[1:09:32] it. They weren't willing to say, "I I I
[1:09:34] know that God had a good man and he used
[1:09:36] him in a mighty way, but I'm just going
[1:09:38] to do just a little bit of my own thing
[1:09:40] because it's good. I still have a job.
[1:09:42] Everything's happening in my life. I'm
[1:09:43] healthy. It's okay. I'll still make it
[1:09:45] to heaven."
[1:09:47] True, you will still make it to heaven.
[1:09:49] But you might have to go through a
[1:09:51] little bit of hell first,
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; unfortunately. But the people who have
[1:09:55] the ability to hear the voice of the
[1:09:57] vindicated prophet can apply that word
[1:09:59] the way that it was given. They don't
[1:10:01] have to worry about that.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I think it's so wonderful how he brought
[1:10:06] the message. William Brham brought the
[1:10:08] message according to God as he gave it
[1:10:10] to him and said, "Why would God want to
[1:10:12] take a bride? Why would a man want to
[1:10:15] take a bride that he's going to marry
[1:10:17] and then judge?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Why would we want to take a bride and
[1:10:22] then get her married, put that wedding
[1:10:24] band of unmmerited grace upon her
[1:10:27] finger, and then judge her?"
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:30] Thank you.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; he said, "I don't want to take a wife
[1:10:37] that I'm going to judge. I want a bride
[1:10:39] of my own choosing."
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And just that revelation alone, I think,
[1:10:46] gives us enough
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Enough revelation to just be so
[1:10:50] thankful.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Just so thankful. You know, brothers and
[1:10:53] sisters, this weekend as we as we
[1:10:55] celebrate, as we observe, as we
[1:10:57] participate in the the Thanksgiving
[1:11:00] weekend, some of us it might be just the
[1:11:02] Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. Some of
[1:11:04] us it we might not do anything because
[1:11:07] we're we're we're US citizens and we're
[1:11:09] just going to wait specifically until
[1:11:12] the fourth the fourth weekend in
[1:11:14] November, which is the the US
[1:11:17] Thanksgiving. And that's okay. Whatever.
[1:11:19] The fact of the matter is there is a
[1:11:21] Thanksgiving. And there's a time in
[1:11:22] North America where we give thanks. We
[1:11:24] know that this is a celebration that
[1:11:25] goes around the world. And some people
[1:11:27] would say that it goes back many
[1:11:28] generations in many different ways. And
[1:11:30] truly it does.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; But while I want to speak about it today
[1:11:34] specifically through the lens of our
[1:11:37] vindicated prophet,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; the thanksgiving in North America. Now,
[1:11:43] there's some Canadians here and there's
[1:11:44] some US citizens here. I'm sure there's
[1:11:46] probably other citizens here. But you
[1:11:49] know, we're all believers here, aren't
[1:11:50] we? Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; I trust we are.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; But I just think it's so beautiful. You
[1:11:55] know, the blood shall be a token for
[1:11:58] you. It shall be to you for a token upon
[1:12:03] the houses where ye are.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And when I see the blood,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I will pass over you.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And the plague shall not be upon you to
[1:12:14] destroy you
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; when I smite the land of Egypt.
[1:12:19] I can't help but think that we're living
[1:12:20] in the land of Egypt right now, aren't
[1:12:22] we?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; We're living in the land of Goan. We've
[1:12:25] got task masters. We have to go to work.
[1:12:28] We We live under the curse
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; whether we want to or not. I know
[1:12:31] there's some people that would
[1:12:33] potentially act in such a way that the
[1:12:35] everything is so good in their life.
[1:12:37] There's no curse. We all live under the
[1:12:39] bondage of the curse. We're stuck. We're
[1:12:41] bound by gravity. One of these days,
[1:12:43] gravity is going to give way though to a
[1:12:45] brand new body.
[1:12:48] But we still live in this world. We
[1:12:50] don't need to be of this world though
[1:12:52] just because we're in the world.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; You know, verse 14 says, "And this day
[1:12:57] shall be unto you for a memorial." And
[1:13:00] and I just can't help but think it's a
[1:13:02] little bit like us giving thanks, isn't
[1:13:05] it? This day shall be unto you for a
[1:13:09] memorial. Even till today, the Jews
[1:13:11] celebrate Passover.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because some people
[1:13:16] followed the word of a vindicated
[1:13:18] prophet.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And the Jews are very very diligent at
[1:13:21] observing this. So much so that when
[1:13:24] they observe Passover, they will
[1:13:26] actually have an extra chair at the
[1:13:28] table.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Because they believe that Messiah is
[1:13:32] coming. And one of these days Messiah is
[1:13:35] going to take that chair right there and
[1:13:37] they're going to say to him, "Friend,
[1:13:38] how did you get those wounds in your
[1:13:40] hands?" And he's going to say, "In the
[1:13:42] house of my friends. those ones that
[1:13:44] claim to be my friends. They're the
[1:13:46] ones.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And we know a whole nation is going to
[1:13:48] be saved in an hour,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; in a day,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; but until then, this was given as a
[1:13:55] memorial. And I just think it's so
[1:13:57] beautiful when we look at this
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving. I want to try and
[1:14:01] encourage us, brothers and sisters, as
[1:14:03] we carve into our meals and and sit down
[1:14:05] and and participate in our fellowship
[1:14:08] and our our friendship and our families,
[1:14:11] let's think about what we have to be
[1:14:12] thankful for. And I just so appreciate
[1:14:14] how brother Don said it this morning. We
[1:14:16] have got the Holy Ghost, the baptism of
[1:14:19] the Holy Ghost. One day we're going to
[1:14:20] look back from eternity and we're going
[1:14:23] to say, "Thank God I saw that token. I
[1:14:27] was able to see that token myself
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; because of that token. He saw the blood
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:14:36] and forever."
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And you know, we can say, "Well, the
[1:14:39] plagues, there's plagues. We we could
[1:14:40] see plagues. There was there was the
[1:14:43] Corona virus and all of that. And I'm
[1:14:45] not claiming to be a scientist by any
[1:14:47] means. We know that there's plagues.
[1:14:48] They're still alive. The black plague is
[1:14:50] still here on Earth. It's not gone.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; All of these things are around. But I
[1:14:55] don't think those are the things that we
[1:14:56] need to worry about. Some people are
[1:14:58] just deathly afraid of COVID. And if you
[1:15:00] are, I want to say to you this morning,
[1:15:02] there is a deliverance.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Not from COVID necessarily. Sure, there
[1:15:06] is. God will heal our flesh. But there's
[1:15:08] a deliverance from that fear is what I
[1:15:10] want to say. Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; If we're afraid of dying, why are we
[1:15:15] afraid of dying? I want to say that loud
[1:15:16] and clear. Why do we have a fear of
[1:15:18] death? Because you know what? If you
[1:15:21] have this token, if you have this
[1:15:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you cannot
[1:15:25] experience death.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; This flesh will perish.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; It has to perish.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; But death has no hold. Now
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; if death has any hold then Calvary was a
[1:15:40] false
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; what happened at Calvary
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; right
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ God in flesh came down
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; and bore our shame took our iniquities
[1:15:55] to the grave
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; he delivered us
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; yes he did
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; we don't need to live in fear
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; but you know I want to say this. Don't
[1:16:06] be afraid of a plague that can come on
[1:16:08] the earth.
[1:16:10] Don't be afraid of
[1:16:13] the plague of maybe black death or the
[1:16:15] next crazy thing that's going to
[1:16:17] outbreak around the world and they're
[1:16:19] going to shut the world down. Don't
[1:16:20] think that's not going to happen. It'll
[1:16:21] happen again for sure.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; They've proven they can do it. They've
[1:16:24] got full control over all the economy
[1:16:26] now. Everything is in full control of
[1:16:28] the peace system.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; But I want to say this. Do be afraid of
[1:16:34] complacency.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Do be afraid of not actually seeing that
[1:16:40] token in your own life.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Because if you can't see that token, can
[1:16:45] he see the blood?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; I'm saying it that way because it's that
[1:16:50] important.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be afraid of of all of
[1:16:54] the fleshly things in this world. Like
[1:16:56] we could die or get sick or maybe some
[1:16:58] of these things could happen to us. What
[1:17:00] we do need to be afraid of is just
[1:17:02] getting lackluster.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Getting complacent,
[1:17:07] letting things slip in our life,
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; just getting comfortable here. Don't get
[1:17:12] comfortable here, brothers and sisters.
[1:17:13] We don't want to get comfortable in this
[1:17:14] world. This world is not our home. You
[1:17:17] know, it was the pilgrims that settled
[1:17:19] in the US and we know that this world is
[1:17:21] not our home. We're just pilgrims
[1:17:23] passing through.
[1:17:27] But the pilgrims who came and settled. I
[1:17:30] just wonder I wonder I know if you look
[1:17:32] up history I'm just saying it just the
[1:17:34] way that brother Barry does these
[1:17:35] things. I look at things in a different
[1:17:37] way I guess. But I wonder if the
[1:17:39] pilgrims look back to Exodus chapter 12
[1:17:42] when they actually had a feast of
[1:17:45] thanksgiving. The very first feast of
[1:17:48] thanksgiving for those people that don't
[1:17:49] know was after their very first year of
[1:17:52] being landed in the United States. It
[1:17:54] wasn't the United States then. It was
[1:17:56] the new world. It was North America. But
[1:17:58] they they they got together with the
[1:18:00] natives. And we know that they struggled
[1:18:02] so hard. And isn't it wonderful to think
[1:18:04] how incredibly kind those natives were
[1:18:07] to those people who arrived because if
[1:18:10] it wasn't for those natives, those
[1:18:11] people probably would have perished.
[1:18:13] Those natives taught them how to
[1:18:15] cultivate food, how to grow, to plant,
[1:18:18] how to harvest, how to maybe hunt the
[1:18:20] game that was in the land, how to maybe
[1:18:23] treat things with with with with herbs
[1:18:25] and stuff when they were sick. Most of
[1:18:27] those people actually passed away
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; according to the record. The first group
[1:18:31] of people that landed in uh in
[1:18:33] Massachusetts, it wasn't that at the
[1:18:35] time. It was it was it was just the new
[1:18:38] world. But, you know, it's interesting.
[1:18:41] It just makes me think, did those people
[1:18:43] when they decided after their first year
[1:18:44] when most of those people died in that
[1:18:46] first terrible winter,
[1:18:48] should we have a feast of celebration,
[1:18:51] should we just be thankful for what God
[1:18:53] has done for us?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I believe there was 102, 105 people.
[1:18:58] There wasn't very many people that came.
[1:19:00] That sounds like a lot, but it's not
[1:19:01] really a lot. But from those people, it
[1:19:05] says in the in the history, there was
[1:19:06] like 34 of them, I think, that were
[1:19:09] actual believers looking for a religious
[1:19:12] freedom. And all the rest of them were
[1:19:14] workers. They were skilled trades. They
[1:19:15] were laborers. Some were indentured
[1:19:17] slaves. It says indentured servants is
[1:19:20] the word they use. They don't use
[1:19:21] slaves. But it's interesting to look at
[1:19:24] it and and think about where this this
[1:19:26] feast of Thanksgiving, the the the
[1:19:28] weekend of Thanksgiving began.
[1:19:32] It was with the pilgrims in
[1:19:33] Massachusetts in a place called uh
[1:19:35] Plymouth. And when we were there, it was
[1:19:38] kind of interesting. We actually got to
[1:19:39] see the sign pointing to Plymouth. And I
[1:19:41] thought, man, I wonder if that's where
[1:19:43] Plymouth Rock actually is. We went out
[1:19:45] to Cape Cod and you know, we didn't
[1:19:47] actually get there, but I I just thought
[1:19:49] it was really neat to see. I'd heard
[1:19:51] about it all my life. And you know,
[1:19:52] that's where the new world began. And to
[1:19:55] think that the whole entire purpose was
[1:19:56] so that God could raise a prophet to
[1:19:58] this age. Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; To this world, God could get a
[1:20:02] vindicated prophet just from that
[1:20:04] original boatload of people.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But where did the the tradition come
[1:20:08] from? We know they were God-fearing
[1:20:10] people. So, I can't help but think they
[1:20:12] had some sort of reference, some sort of
[1:20:14] navigation back to the word of God in
[1:20:16] the day in which they lived. And if you
[1:20:18] look at the if you look at the pictures,
[1:20:20] if you type in, you know, original
[1:20:21] Thanksgiving pictures, it shows pictures
[1:20:24] of the Puritans and the pilgrims and,
[1:20:26] you know, different folks who were
[1:20:28] around at that time, but they're all
[1:20:30] dressed in dresses. Pretty interesting
[1:20:32] to see. There's no cleavage.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; There's pretty much no legs,
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; you know, there's there's there's a
[1:20:38] different appearance to the people. And
[1:20:40] and what are they doing when they're
[1:20:41] sitting down and they're actually going
[1:20:43] around the table? They're giving thanks.
[1:20:45] What are they doing? They're actually in
[1:20:46] prayer. They look like they're reverent.
[1:20:49] They're they're they're giving thanks.
[1:20:51] Someone is standing and you can see
[1:20:53] they've got their heart hand over their
[1:20:54] heart and they're looking up and it's
[1:20:56] like they're offering a prayer to God
[1:20:58] for thanksgiving for what he has done
[1:21:00] for them. They have an opportunity now
[1:21:02] for freedom of religion and and freedom
[1:21:04] of employment, the ability to actually
[1:21:07] own land and and be free. I just wonder
[1:21:10] how how much further down the road are
[1:21:12] we to think that all of this
[1:21:16] came from that. And some people might
[1:21:19] say, "Well, Brother Barry, there was the
[1:21:21] Canadians." And sure enough, there was.
[1:21:23] There was Champlain and and and all of
[1:21:25] that. There was the original settlement
[1:21:27] in Quebec, which is what is Quebec now.
[1:21:30] And you know, that actually happened
[1:21:31] before Plymouth Rock. That happened
[1:21:33] before the before the pilgrims landed
[1:21:36] there. the French were actually
[1:21:38] happening in Quebec. I'm not trying to
[1:21:41] give us a history lesson. I just think
[1:21:42] it's interesting to look at all of this
[1:21:45] to to see what's gone on. All of these
[1:21:47] people helped create this environment
[1:21:50] that we live in.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And a lot of them fought with their
[1:21:53] lives
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; for this cause for us to have
[1:21:57] specifically this ability to have
[1:22:00] freedom of religion.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we get down, we get tired,
[1:22:06] we maybe get frustrated, we get whatever
[1:22:08] the adjective is in our life and we just
[1:22:10] don't want to go to church, we just
[1:22:11] don't want to worship, we just don't
[1:22:13] want to whatever. But we have this
[1:22:16] freedom. H how could we just neglect
[1:22:20] such a great salvation that we've been
[1:22:22] given in the day in which we live?
[1:22:25] You know, I I I think about this is a an
[1:22:29] interesting thing. In Exodus, they were
[1:22:31] given the instructions by God through
[1:22:32] their prophet to actually create a
[1:22:35] memorial. That day, the Passover day was
[1:22:38] was to be a memorial. And you know there
[1:22:41] was a place in the US a time and place
[1:22:44] in the US where there was a presidential
[1:22:47] pro pl pro proclamation a presidential
[1:22:50] proclamation and it was officially
[1:22:52] declared a national holiday by President
[1:22:55] Abraham Lincoln in 1863
[1:22:58] to actually celebrate Thanksgiving and I
[1:23:01] believe it's the fourth the fourth
[1:23:02] weekend in uh November in the US
[1:23:07] and you know it was given in in Canada
[1:23:10] On January 31st, 1957, much later, the
[1:23:13] Governor General of Canada, Vincent
[1:23:16] Massie, he issued a proclamation
[1:23:18] stating, "A day of general thanksgiving
[1:23:22] to Almighty God."
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; For the bountiful harvest, which Canada
[1:23:28] has been blessed
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; to be observed on the second Monday in
[1:23:32] October. And we know that in even the
[1:23:35] prophet in in the day in which we live,
[1:23:37] he said that Canada would be a leader of
[1:23:39] nations.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And I remember vividly this is just from
[1:23:43] the hip. I wish that I would have
[1:23:45] prepared this a little more. But you
[1:23:46] know to this point about what what he
[1:23:49] declared there about Canada being a
[1:23:51] bountiful harvest. You know the prophet
[1:23:54] he declared that Canada would be a
[1:23:55] leader of nations. This was actually
[1:23:57] something that happened in the time in
[1:23:58] which we lived. It was on, I believe,
[1:24:00] was it MLAN's magazine or Time magazine?
[1:24:03] Brother Ken actually showed it. It was
[1:24:05] actually a headline, Canada, leader of
[1:24:07] nations.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; I remember thinking that's just amazing
[1:24:11] to see. Such a little thing. It doesn't
[1:24:13] change anything to do with salvation,
[1:24:15] but alls it does is just say, "Yep,
[1:24:17] that's my prophet.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; That's my prophet." You know,
[1:24:21] association association it does have uh
[1:24:26] it does have importance. There is a very
[1:24:29] very important reason to have an
[1:24:31] association with the prophet. We'll get
[1:24:33] into that a little bit later. But, you
[1:24:34] know, out out of the the the Bible, the
[1:24:37] most important thing that we have to
[1:24:39] refer to and and the Bible Thanksgiving
[1:24:42] is H8426.
[1:24:44] It's pronounced ta. And you know, it
[1:24:47] comes from a root word. I'm not going to
[1:24:49] get into it because it actually you can
[1:24:51] look it up if you get into the the
[1:24:52] lexicon or or the concordance. But
[1:24:56] thanksgiving, it comes from Oh, it comes
[1:24:58] from 3034
[1:25:00] if you look it up. I didn't bring it up,
[1:25:02] but that word is pronounced yada. yada.
[1:25:07] And it made me think, is that where is
[1:25:09] that where you hear that that saying in
[1:25:12] the world when you have someone that's
[1:25:13] talking and and you might have somebody
[1:25:16] maybe a teenager who's got a little chip
[1:25:18] on their shoulder and they hear mom or
[1:25:20] dad saying something to them and and
[1:25:21] they just don't want to hear it and you
[1:25:23] hear them going yada yada yada.
[1:25:26] Is that what that means? I wonder. I
[1:25:30] wonder. I I want to look it up a little
[1:25:32] further. But the word we're looking at
[1:25:33] thanksgiving pronounced taa is properly
[1:25:36] an extension of the hand that is by
[1:25:38] implication of vowel or usually
[1:25:42] adoration
[1:25:44] specifically a choir of worshippers
[1:25:48] confession sacrifice of praise
[1:25:51] thanksgiving offering
[1:25:54] thanksgiving in the Bible that is the
[1:25:56] definition of it I thought that was so
[1:25:58] good
[1:25:59] you know we have been given given this
[1:26:02] uh this ordinance and I say that we've
[1:26:07] been given this ordinance because it is
[1:26:09] very applicable to a communion table
[1:26:12] when we look at what the magnitude of
[1:26:14] the communion table actually is because
[1:26:17] you know brothers and sisters it's good
[1:26:18] to look back it's good to have a little
[1:26:20] bit of a a history lesson but I also
[1:26:22] think it's very important to make it
[1:26:24] relevant for today and to realize that
[1:26:26] this this token is truly the baptism of
[1:26:29] the Holy Ghost in the day in which we
[1:26:32] But, you know, it's interesting to see
[1:26:34] the way God does things through history
[1:26:36] and and he brings it up and and makes it
[1:26:39] relevant. So, let's just turn over to
[1:26:42] Matthew chap 26 verse 28.
[1:26:47] Matthew chap 26
[1:26:50] verse 28.
[1:27:06] Maybe start with let's just go to 26 26
[1:27:10] 26
[1:27:12] that's interesting. Exodus 12:12 Matthew
[1:27:15] 26 26
[1:27:18] and as they were eating Jesus took bread
[1:27:20] and blessed it and he broke it and gave
[1:27:23] it to the disciples
[1:27:25] and said take eat. this is my body.
[1:27:29] And he took the cup and gave thanks and
[1:27:31] gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye all
[1:27:35] of it.
[1:27:37] For this is my blood of the new
[1:27:39] testament which is shed for many for the
[1:27:43] remission of sins.
[1:27:46] But I say unto you, I will not drink
[1:27:48] henceforth of this of this fruit of the
[1:27:52] vine until the day when I drink it new
[1:27:55] with you in my father's kingdom.
[1:27:59] And I love verse 30 here. When they had
[1:28:02] sung a hymn, they went out into the
[1:28:05] Mount of Olives.
[1:28:08] Something about singing a hymn. Even
[1:28:09] Jesus was interested in singing hymns.
[1:28:13] But that's not what I want to dwell on
[1:28:14] today. I want to talk about this uh
[1:28:16] verse 28. For this is my blood of the
[1:28:20] new testament which is shed for many for
[1:28:22] the remission of sins. He had not yet
[1:28:25] died yet on Calvary in the natural. But
[1:28:29] we know that lamb was slain before the
[1:28:31] foundation of the world is what the
[1:28:32] Bible says. But because that happened in
[1:28:36] the heavens, it had to actually happen
[1:28:38] on earth. There had to be a literal
[1:28:41] manifestation of that taking place.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; But looking at this scripture here, I
[1:28:46] think it's interesting. This cup, Jesus
[1:28:50] sitting down with the disciples
[1:28:52] as they were eating,
[1:28:55] Jesus took bread and blessed it, and
[1:28:57] then he gave them the wine. The the
[1:28:59] feast. It's interesting to see that
[1:29:02] that's how he desired to express this.
[1:29:06] We know that we have another scripture
[1:29:08] that we read and we're not going to get
[1:29:09] into that today for communion table. But
[1:29:11] this this one in particular I think is
[1:29:13] just interesting to look at how Jesus
[1:29:16] expresses the mind of God to the world.
[1:29:19] And as he does that, he takes and shows
[1:29:22] them the importance of having food. And
[1:29:24] it goes right back to Exodus. It's no
[1:29:26] different than that to remember this.
[1:29:28] And you know, brothers and sisters, the
[1:29:30] church in the day in which we live, we
[1:29:32] only have three ordinances that we are
[1:29:33] given to live by. We we remember those,
[1:29:36] I'm sure. But for the sake of of
[1:29:39] stirring up our pure minds by way of
[1:29:40] remembrance, I just want to want to
[1:29:42] bring it out to the the surface this
[1:29:44] morning. And that is baptism in Jesus'
[1:29:46] name, communion, and footwashing. That's
[1:29:49] what we live by. That's how believers in
[1:29:51] this day follow the message of the hour.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; But it's interesting how many people
[1:29:56] will actually claim to believe the
[1:29:58] messenger for the age. They'll say, "God
[1:30:00] sent a prophet," but yet
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; they can't come to a communion table,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Or they're not interested in coming to a
[1:30:08] footwashing. They say, "That's crazy.
[1:30:10] That was for a different time. That's a
[1:30:12] different culture. Why would I wash
[1:30:13] someone's foot?"
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We know that the word says that if we
[1:30:17] can't humble ourselves,
[1:30:22] that's what footwashing is all about.
[1:30:24] If God himself can come down and
[1:30:27] manifest in flesh and make himself a
[1:30:29] footwash flunky and wash all of his
[1:30:31] disciples feet
[1:30:35] and we can't do it ourselves.
[1:30:38] He's not going to judge us for other
[1:30:40] people's actions, is he?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; If we're willing to judge ourselves
[1:30:45] here, if we truly do judge ourselves
[1:30:47] here, then we will simply follow the
[1:30:49] commission that he's given us.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; There's no excuses for it. There's no
[1:30:53] way that we going to we're going to be
[1:30:55] able to go and stand before him. If we
[1:30:57] don't judge oursel properly, we won't do
[1:30:59] all that he has commissioned us to do.
[1:31:01] And that will be how how he said you'll
[1:31:03] know them by their fruits.
[1:31:06] That's how you'll know them because they
[1:31:08] won't follow my word. They won't follow
[1:31:10] the instruction for their day. But not
[1:31:13] everyone can. And it's not up to us to
[1:31:15] get upset or worried about it. It's only
[1:31:17] up to us to pray for those people.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. to have a desire for them to
[1:31:21] actually be able to follow the word for
[1:31:23] their day.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You know, if if people back in the day
[1:31:27] of of of the children of Israel in
[1:31:29] Egypt, if they actually took the blood
[1:31:32] from their lamb and went over and
[1:31:35] applied it to their neighbor's house,
[1:31:37] that blood would maybe be in the exact
[1:31:40] right location. Maybe it would be the
[1:31:42] exact right blood, but it wouldn't be
[1:31:44] from their own sacrifice.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It had to be from their own lamb.
[1:31:49] And we know that God even made a
[1:31:50] provision for it for those people who
[1:31:52] maybe didn't have a family and and
[1:31:54] didn't have many people in their home.
[1:31:56] And if they killed the lamb, it would
[1:31:57] just be too much. He said, "Get
[1:31:58] together.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Have some fellowship.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Remember what's going on. Talk about the
[1:32:04] things of the Lord. Have this solemn
[1:32:06] feast, but apply the blood the way that
[1:32:08] I've instructed you." Right?
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And everyone who got together under that
[1:32:12] roof could identify with that scripture,
[1:32:14] could identify with that sacrifice. And
[1:32:17] as they did that, that death angel
[1:32:20] passed over them.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, that death angel was truly
[1:32:24] the word of God for the day in which
[1:32:26] they lived, wasn't it?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; The same thing that judged the entire
[1:32:30] world in the days of Noah
[1:32:34] is the same thing that saved Noah.
[1:32:37] Some people might say, "Well, it was the
[1:32:39] ark, brother Barry." But you know, he
[1:32:41] built an ark and he sat in it for seven
[1:32:44] days. Did it save him?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The ark never saved him. The water saved
[1:32:48] him because it caused the ark to float.
[1:32:51] Remember, when the enemy comes in like a
[1:32:53] flood, the spirit of God raises a
[1:32:56] standard
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; against that flood of the enemy. And
[1:32:59] we're not talking about floods of water
[1:33:01] in the day in which we live. We're
[1:33:03] talking about the onslaught of the devil
[1:33:05] in the day in which we live through
[1:33:07] fashion, through through whatever it is,
[1:33:09] critical thinking, all of these things
[1:33:11] where people are are choosing sides, the
[1:33:14] polarization now people are for Charlie
[1:33:16] Kirk, people are against Charlie Kirk,
[1:33:18] all these different things, these
[1:33:19] political agendas, all this stuff is a
[1:33:23] distraction by the devil. That's where
[1:33:25] we need to fear, brothers and sisters.
[1:33:27] If there's anything to fear,
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; the devil is just getting us distracted
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; or at least trying to.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I remember saying it one time before and
[1:33:38] and I was having a conversation the
[1:33:39] other day about it how I got in trouble
[1:33:41] for saying from the pulpit, and I'm not
[1:33:43] going to back up on it. I'm going to
[1:33:45] actually double down on it.
[1:33:48] I got in trouble for saying that a son
[1:33:50] of God, a daughter of God, has got no
[1:33:52] place being out there protesting in any
[1:33:54] one of these protests.
[1:33:56] Why would we be doing that?
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; If we're going to do something, we ought
[1:34:00] to get a drum and a soap box and go and
[1:34:02] stand on a corner and sing about Jesus
[1:34:05] Christ.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Put on a sandwich board and said, "I'm a
[1:34:12] fool for Christ." on the front and on
[1:34:14] the back say, "Whose fool are you?"
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. But to get involved in in
[1:34:19] a protest where we're going to go and
[1:34:21] jump on board with some movement that's
[1:34:24] happening in this world, the only thing
[1:34:26] we're doing is get involved in a
[1:34:28] movement that's happening in this world.
[1:34:30] And whose movement is that if it's in
[1:34:32] this world?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, it's either of God or
[1:34:38] it's of Satan.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it's not preaching this
[1:34:42] word of God or that God sent a prophet
[1:34:45] to this world, it's of Satan.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And it can be so flowery. It can be so
[1:34:53] eloquent.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt for a second that both Cain
[1:34:56] and Abel went to the same church.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; They both worshiped.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; They both knew who God was.
[1:35:08] And no doubt Cain had an even more
[1:35:11] eloquent
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; movement.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; He had a more eloquent
[1:35:17] thing happening. His his his altar was
[1:35:20] so beautiful.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; But Abel, he just had what? What did
[1:35:27] Abel have by revelation? What did he do?
[1:35:30] We know that he went and he took a lamb
[1:35:31] and he chopped its neck. Brother
[1:35:34] Brandham says, "With a rock." And we
[1:35:36] know that as he did that, Cain must have
[1:35:37] been like, "Oh, oh, you're terrible.
[1:35:40] Look at the mess you're making all over
[1:35:42] the place. What are you doing?" Because
[1:35:44] he never had a revelation.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And you know, back in the day, the
[1:35:49] people in in in Egypt, they must have
[1:35:52] been saying, "What are you doing? You're
[1:35:54] putting blood on the doors, the
[1:35:56] doorpost, and the lentils. You're
[1:35:58] bringing flies." Anybody here deal with
[1:36:00] flies? Now that we're on the acorage, we
[1:36:03] deal with flies.
[1:36:05] I'll tell you what, I'd probably have a
[1:36:07] real hard time taking blood and putting
[1:36:10] it on the doorpost of our door of our
[1:36:12] front door.
[1:36:15] My wife would be saying, "What are you
[1:36:16] doing?
[1:36:18] We have a hard enough time with flies."
[1:36:20] But I just can't help but imagine back
[1:36:22] in that day that would have been so
[1:36:23] terrible.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You'd be bringing flies all over the
[1:36:26] place. Come on. Haven't we had enough
[1:36:28] flies?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Right. Now you want to go and apply
[1:36:33] blood and bring more flies. It sounds
[1:36:35] crazy, but you know the people who truly
[1:36:38] are in line with the word for their day,
[1:36:41] they do sound crazy.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; They're not normal people.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; But you know, saying that I can actually
[1:36:49] have Jesus Christ in my life and I'm
[1:36:51] going to get to Jesus Christ, but I'm
[1:36:53] just going to circumvent his prophet.
[1:36:56] Guess what?
[1:36:58] You can have Jesus Christ, but it's
[1:37:00] going to take you some work to get there
[1:37:03] because you're saying, "I'm gonna do it
[1:37:05] the way that I want to do it." Instead
[1:37:08] of saying, "I accept the way that you've
[1:37:11] done it."
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is the way of the
[1:37:16] word. God is the same yesterday, today,
[1:37:19] and forever. Yeah. Hebrews 13:8. We know
[1:37:21] that.
[1:37:23] You know, Brother Brad, I'm in in a
[1:37:24] message. Boy, I got it mixed up here.
[1:37:26] And the token, I looked it up. I thought
[1:37:29] it was so good. In the message, the
[1:37:31] token, I I type things up. The way I
[1:37:33] study is I'll I'll I'll study something
[1:37:35] and and then I'll see, well, what
[1:37:36] message says it the most. And and I just
[1:37:40] chuckled as I was doing this because it
[1:37:41] goes right to the token. I don't know
[1:37:44] how many times he says it in the token,
[1:37:46] but he says it a lot. I think the most
[1:37:48] out of any time.
[1:37:51] And what did I look up? It was
[1:37:52] Thanksgiving.
[1:37:54] Thanksgiving is what I looked up. But
[1:37:56] brother Brandham in this in this message
[1:37:58] right at the very beginning in his
[1:37:59] prayer and he in part of his prayer here
[1:38:01] he says and we pray this will be a night
[1:38:04] that will be long remembered because
[1:38:07] your presence being with us as we stand
[1:38:11] tonight at this thanksgiving closing of
[1:38:14] the great celebration across the nation
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; of how good you were to our forefathers.
[1:38:20] It's wonderful to look back and think
[1:38:22] about that. How good you were to our
[1:38:25] forefathers.
[1:38:27] We turn our heads to thank you, Lord. As
[1:38:31] he says this, I can't help but think
[1:38:33] about those those those 10 lepers.
[1:38:36] Leprosy being a sign of unbelief, the
[1:38:39] unbeliever. And
[1:38:42] Jesus said to that one that turned
[1:38:43] around to thank him, that turned his
[1:38:45] head to thank him.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Weren't there 10? Yes, it was.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing it must have
[1:38:51] been for that one to realize and sad at
[1:38:54] the same time because no doubt some of
[1:38:56] them were his friends. He says, "You how
[1:38:59] good you were to our forefathers. We too
[1:39:02] turn our heads to thank you, Lord, for
[1:39:05] what you've done for us. Now we pray
[1:39:07] that you'll grant all these things that
[1:39:08] we ask for. We ask them in Jesus' name
[1:39:12] and for his honor."
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] Sounds simple, but I think that prayer
[1:39:18] there, just the ending of that prayer is
[1:39:20] so relevant.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; When we pray, how do we pray? Are we
[1:39:23] asking asking it in the name of Jesus
[1:39:27] for his honor?
[1:39:30] If we're doing that, I think we're on
[1:39:32] the right track.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say today, brothers and
[1:39:35] sisters, is that clock working?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I'm like, yeah, they said that at the
[1:39:42] beginning. I was just joking. I knew it
[1:39:45] wasn't working. So, because the clock's
[1:39:47] not working, I don't even know what time
[1:39:48] it is.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Feels like we just started. I'm five
[1:39:53] minutes into the service. Is that right?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; What are we thankful for today, brothers
[1:39:59] and sisters?
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; What What are we truly thankful for? We
[1:40:02] had a little conversation last night and
[1:40:04] that was with the family. What truly
[1:40:06] What are we thankful for? What is it
[1:40:08] that really we're thankful for?
[1:40:11] Some people are thankful for simple
[1:40:14] little things. Simple what we might
[1:40:17] think are simple little things, but we
[1:40:19] don't know the background behind their
[1:40:20] thanksgiving.
[1:40:22] Someone might be thankful for one thing
[1:40:24] and someone might be thankful for
[1:40:25] something totally different. And and and
[1:40:27] carnal things are nice, but brothers and
[1:40:29] sisters, I don't want us to talk about
[1:40:31] carnality today. We're in the presence
[1:40:34] of God.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; What are we thankful for? when we are
[1:40:38] standing maybe before him and we're able
[1:40:41] to shake his hand for real. The time is
[1:40:44] coming where we're going to see Jesus
[1:40:45] Christ in his corporal body.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if we have that
[1:40:49] opportunity the very first time we meet
[1:40:51] him? He says, "I'm so glad you're here.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; I knew you before the foundation of the
[1:40:57] world. Enter ye into the joy of the
[1:40:59] Lord." And by the way, what are you the
[1:41:01] most thankful for? What will we say? I
[1:41:05] doubt we're going to be saying, "I'm so
[1:41:07] thankful that I got new tires on my
[1:41:09] car."
[1:41:10] I doubt that we're going to say, "I got
[1:41:13] a new job."
[1:41:15] I doubt that we're going to say, "This
[1:41:17] happened to me or that or the other."
[1:41:21] We're going to say, we're certainly
[1:41:22] thankful that we were given the token.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; We were given the ability to overcome
[1:41:26] ourselves so that we could actually be
[1:41:29] here today because we're going to
[1:41:31] realize really what the important things
[1:41:33] are.
[1:41:35] But you know, brothers and sisters, I'm
[1:41:37] not discounting new tires on the car. We
[1:41:38] need them. We live in a place where, you
[1:41:40] know what, winter tires are very
[1:41:42] important. And and sometimes you can
[1:41:44] drive without winter tires. It can just
[1:41:46] be all seasons. But new tires certainly
[1:41:49] work better than old tires. I'll tell
[1:41:51] you by experience. If you ever need to
[1:41:53] stop in the winter time, you'll know
[1:41:55] what I mean.
[1:41:58] But we don't want to discount the needs
[1:42:00] that we have in our lives.
[1:42:02] And I want to say this, I think it's
[1:42:04] important. He knows that we have needs.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; He's allowed the needs to be there in
[1:42:09] our lives so that he can provide those
[1:42:11] needs because that's his word, which is
[1:42:13] actually his will.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I will supply all of your needs
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; according to my riches
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[1:42:26] But seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; and all of his righteousness, and then
[1:42:32] I'll add all these other things unto
[1:42:34] you.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; We just need to make sure that we're
[1:42:37] actually getting things in the exact
[1:42:39] right order. God is a God of order.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in it just being
[1:42:46] willy-nilly, is he? He wants it to be
[1:42:49] exactly the way that he has given it.
[1:42:52] And I think it's so beautiful the way
[1:42:53] that he gave the instruction to the
[1:42:55] children of Israel when they were in Gan
[1:42:57] in in Exodus, the scripture that we
[1:42:59] read, Exodus 12:12, you know, they were
[1:43:02] given a sign. They had to take that
[1:43:04] blood and apply it the way they were
[1:43:05] supposed to, the way the prophets said,
[1:43:07] which was God's instructions.
[1:43:10] And if they did, they didn't have to
[1:43:12] worry about any plague coming around.
[1:43:13] They didn't have to worry about the
[1:43:14] devil coming around taking their
[1:43:15] children. They don't have to worry about
[1:43:18] problems in their marriage because they
[1:43:20] know that they have a baseline and that
[1:43:22] is that token. They can always go back
[1:43:23] to that token. When things get tough,
[1:43:25] they can go back to that token. They can
[1:43:27] look at that token. We know that God
[1:43:29] gave them a basic example and that was a
[1:43:31] brass serpent, wasn't it?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; It was the serpent wrapped around the
[1:43:35] pole. And and we know that even medicine
[1:43:37] today uses that. But why is that?
[1:43:39] Because when the plague came in into the
[1:43:41] camp of the children of Israel, because
[1:43:43] they were disobedient and the snake
[1:43:45] would bite them, alls they had to do was
[1:43:48] look at that pole, that brass serpent.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And alls we have to do today is look at
[1:43:52] that token. The token wasn't given for
[1:43:54] him. The token was given for us.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; So I want to say if we can see that
[1:44:01] token in our lives, we've got every
[1:44:02] single reason to rejoice with
[1:44:04] thanksgiving in our heart. Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; So, what are we thankful for today,
[1:44:08] brothers and sisters? If you can't see
[1:44:10] the token, I suggest that you get to a
[1:44:12] place where you can see the token.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Because the death angel is passing
[1:44:16] through the land.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; But it's not as we suppose. We said it
[1:44:20] before. The death angel is only
[1:44:22] interested in getting us distracted,
[1:44:23] getting us from getting that token.
[1:44:25] That's all the death angel wants us to
[1:44:27] do. Get get us from getting the token
[1:44:29] and get our children distracted from
[1:44:31] getting the token. That's all the death
[1:44:32] angel's interested in. Of course, if he
[1:44:34] could harm us, he will. But it's not a
[1:44:36] death angel the way it was in Exodus
[1:44:39] 12:12 in the land of Goan. It's a death
[1:44:42] angel spiritually.
[1:44:45] So, what are we thankful for today?
[1:44:49] You know, brother Bradam, in this
[1:44:50] message, the token further on paragraph
[1:44:53] 115, he says, just like Thanksgiving
[1:44:55] Day, many people today never thought
[1:44:58] tens of thousands of times of thousands
[1:45:02] and millions of America eat dinner today
[1:45:05] in a Thanksgiving celebration with a
[1:45:08] turkey on the table and never as much as
[1:45:11] offered a blessing,
[1:45:14] returned thanks.
[1:45:16] Just made me think about it. I remember
[1:45:18] living in the world in in days like that
[1:45:19] and the food would be done and everyone
[1:45:21] would just dig in,
[1:45:24] just dig right in to that food, even
[1:45:26] maybe before everything was served,
[1:45:28] they'd be already munching down stuff.
[1:45:31] And it always did feel a little bit
[1:45:32] funny to me in the world, but you know,
[1:45:34] there's a lot of people that do that.
[1:45:36] And and why? Because they feel like
[1:45:38] they're entitled to it.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; there's a lot of people that believe
[1:45:42] they're absolutely entitled to that
[1:45:44] food. And you know, one day that's going
[1:45:47] to change,
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; But here he says, and and never as much
[1:45:54] as offered a blessing, return thanks.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; But they wouldn't have this without
[1:46:00] having it on the same table where they
[1:46:03] had a turkey, a court of whiskey, and a
[1:46:06] lot of beer sitting around the table.
[1:46:08] It's become a tradition, and I've
[1:46:10] witnessed it. It's become a tradition.
[1:46:12] He says, "You say that's ridiculous.
[1:46:14] That's not even Americanism. Well, it
[1:46:16] very much is. It's even Canadianism
[1:46:20] speaking from experience.
[1:46:22] But here's the prophet of God, the
[1:46:24] seventh angel messenger, God speaking to
[1:46:26] this age through his man.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; I'll turn it right back into your lap.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; To come to the altar with a driedyed
[1:46:36] confession is a tradition.
[1:46:42] He says you should die there to your
[1:46:43] sacrifice
[1:46:46] as you identify yourself
[1:46:49] that you are dead.
[1:46:51] I was talking to someone yesterday about
[1:46:53] a new birth experience.
[1:46:56] You know, brothers and sisters, don't
[1:46:58] doubt this for a second. A birth is
[1:47:00] messy.
[1:47:03] And if you've never had a new birth in
[1:47:05] your life,
[1:47:07] you don't know what it means. If you've
[1:47:09] never seen a birth, you don't know what
[1:47:11] it means. But animals have children,
[1:47:14] they have a birth happens through an
[1:47:16] animal, it's messy.
[1:47:18] When humans give birth, it's messy. And
[1:47:22] brother Brandham, he says it, whether
[1:47:23] it's in a pig pen or at an altar, it's
[1:47:26] messy.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; A birth is a mess.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; But you know, we're not interested in
[1:47:31] what other people think, are we?
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Because if it's truly a new birth, it's
[1:47:35] only about what he thinks. Right?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; But if we're busy thinking about what
[1:47:40] other people think, I'll tell you what,
[1:47:42] we're not having a new birth.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; We're having an intellectual
[1:47:46] stimulation.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you today, don't come
[1:47:51] to church for an intellectual
[1:47:52] stimulation.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; That's not what this church is about.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about it today. As a
[1:47:59] pastor, as a preacher, you you really
[1:48:01] start to wonder sometimes the devil
[1:48:03] works hard.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; He goes about as a roaring lion.
[1:48:07] you're not worthy. What are you doing?
[1:48:09] Blah blah blah. Give up. Go home.
[1:48:11] There's somebody else. All of that junk.
[1:48:13] It happens in your mind. The devil
[1:48:15] bombards when it's time to prepare for a
[1:48:18] service. But you know what? I just think
[1:48:21] it's so beautiful to think, where did I
[1:48:24] come from?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; How was I raised? And I could tell you
[1:48:27] without a shadow of a doubt, that's
[1:48:29] where I was able to say, "Beat it,
[1:48:31] Satan." Because I know that I know that
[1:48:34] I know that I met the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:48:37] And how did I do it? I came to an
[1:48:38] ordinary Wednesday night service where
[1:48:41] my pastor was preaching the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; July 27th, 2005. So I was able to say,
[1:48:48] you know what, I'm not actually off
[1:48:50] track preaching the Holy Ghost. This is
[1:48:53] what we need for the day in which we
[1:48:55] live. And that's why my pastor taught me
[1:48:57] that. Amen.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; So, there came a revelation one day
[1:49:01] where I had to go and have an outward
[1:49:03] expression of the true inward work that
[1:49:06] happened to me. And brother Logan can
[1:49:08] testify to it. There's a witness right
[1:49:11] there. It was cold. It was September. It
[1:49:14] was the Bow River. We went to a watery
[1:49:17] grave and washed the old men downstream.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I wonder how far down they are now,
[1:49:23] brother. Maybe Hudson's Bay somewhere
[1:49:25] out there.
[1:49:27] But it happened.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And for me, it was interesting because I
[1:49:31] was able to say, you know, I know that
[1:49:34] I'm not too far off base.
[1:49:37] The devil wants me to think that I'm I'm
[1:49:39] actually crazy. Maybe I shouldn't be
[1:49:41] doing this,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; but I know God put me here.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And as long as he wants me here, I'll be
[1:49:46] here.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; And as soon as he don't want me here,
[1:49:49] he's got something better for me. So,
[1:49:50] it's okay. But you know what I want to
[1:49:53] do is make sure as long as I'm here that
[1:49:55] I'm preaching the truth. And the truth
[1:49:57] for our day is that we need to see the
[1:50:00] token.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; If you can't see the token in your life,
[1:50:05] I would say be afraid.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Let's let's be afraid of one thing,
[1:50:10] brothers and sisters, and that is that
[1:50:12] we don't have the token.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; But you know what that fear is going to
[1:50:16] do? That's a healthy fear. That fear is
[1:50:19] going to drive us to the altar where we
[1:50:21] do have that new birth.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; This message of the hour is about
[1:50:25] getting us saved.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; This message of the hour is about
[1:50:28] getting us to Jesus Christ. And that's
[1:50:30] the purpose of the message of the hour.
[1:50:32] If we've made it anything else, then
[1:50:34] we've got it wrong.
[1:50:37] Boy,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; it's pretty quiet.
[1:50:42] But brothers and sisters, this is about
[1:50:44] getting the token for the day in which
[1:50:45] we live. Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:50:49] Christ for the remission of our sins so
[1:50:51] that we can get the Holy Ghost. Because
[1:50:53] if we're baptized in the name of the
[1:50:55] Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and
[1:50:56] we say, "Oh, sure. I believe that God
[1:50:58] sent a prophet." Oh, yes. It's
[1:51:00] wonderful. He's a mighty man of God.
[1:51:02] He's got a tremendous ministry, but I've
[1:51:03] already been baptized. Have you? The
[1:51:06] prophet said, "You haven't."
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; And I want to say it this way. God
[1:51:10] through the prophet said, "You haven't
[1:51:12] even been baptized yet." If you're only
[1:51:14] baptized in titles, you have to be
[1:51:15] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:18] Christ because that is the formula that
[1:51:20] he gave.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And if you are, you will receive the
[1:51:26] gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful because I
[1:51:30] always say this and I'm going to say it
[1:51:32] again. I think it's important to
[1:51:33] remember that there's some people that
[1:51:35] will receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:37] Ghost based on their confession because
[1:51:38] God knows their heart. He gives them the
[1:51:41] Holy Ghost before they even get water
[1:51:43] baptized.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; It happens. But if it's truly the
[1:51:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost, guess what?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; They will come exactly according to the
[1:51:52] word of God. Acts 2:38 will take place
[1:51:55] in their life.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; They won't say, "No, I'm good, man. I I
[1:52:00] I've been baptized in titles. It's
[1:52:01] fine."
[1:52:03] That won't ever happen. That trinitarian
[1:52:05] spirit, it can't stand before the spirit
[1:52:07] of the Lord.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why people get
[1:52:10] so aggressive when you start talking
[1:52:11] about this very specific thing because
[1:52:14] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:52:15] the Bible is just simply knowledge.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; And I'm not even going to apologize for
[1:52:20] that. There's no need to apologize for
[1:52:21] that. We're not into apologetics here.
[1:52:24] We're into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:26] here.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:52:28] token for our day. And it gives us every
[1:52:30] single reason to rejoice.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he says this though. I
[1:52:34] think it's so good. I'll turn it right
[1:52:35] back into your lap. To come to the altar
[1:52:38] with a dried eyed confession is a
[1:52:40] tradition. You should die there to your
[1:52:43] sacrifice as you identify yourself that
[1:52:47] you are dead.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Buried in Christ. The word world
[1:52:52] is dead behind you. And you come to the
[1:52:56] place I'll say it where you don't want
[1:52:59] to fellowship with the world. those old
[1:53:01] names and numbers that you were
[1:53:03] associating with in the world. When you
[1:53:05] truly repent, repent means to change
[1:53:08] your mind, you actually want nothing to
[1:53:11] do with that old self.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:15] But when we truly want to come to church
[1:53:18] and actually have the polished image and
[1:53:20] everything is good, you know, I'm I'm
[1:53:22] I'm conforming,
[1:53:24] everything is fine, but I still have the
[1:53:27] old friends numbers and they're still
[1:53:28] going to call me. And you know, if they
[1:53:30] you if you're still connected that way,
[1:53:33] you're not going to overcome. You won't.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Satan will still bring you down.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; He'll still bring you down. You can go
[1:53:42] to them and testify that I've been saved
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; and they're not going to want nothing to
[1:53:46] do with you.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; But what they're going to do is try and
[1:53:49] encourage you to come out and party.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Just just come to the party for a little
[1:53:53] while. Don't worry about it.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have to drink. You don't have
[1:53:56] to smoke. You don't have to do anything.
[1:53:58] But, you know, just get under the beat
[1:53:59] of that music. The devil knows exactly
[1:54:02] what it takes. And as that music starts
[1:54:04] to happen, then we start to get into the
[1:54:05] groove of it. You get in the spirit,
[1:54:07] right? Brother Brandham says it in the
[1:54:09] church age book. We ought to be just as
[1:54:11] exuberant as them, man. Those people
[1:54:12] will dance in the spirit. Don't take
[1:54:14] very much. And I'm I'm guilty of it. I
[1:54:17] could be walking through a store and
[1:54:19] I'll hear a song from the old me and
[1:54:20] I'll just start going like this and I
[1:54:22] think, "Oh Lord,
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; it's bad."
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "You don't
[1:54:30] have to worry about anything. If if the
[1:54:32] Holy Ghost doesn't get your children,
[1:54:34] rock and roll will."
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:38] We need to be careful as parents to make
[1:54:41] sure that we are the Holy Ghost for our
[1:54:43] children.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; But he says that you should die there to
[1:54:48] your sacrifice as you identify yourself
[1:54:50] that you are dead. How do we identify
[1:54:52] ourselves as dead? Do away with the old
[1:54:54] man. Get rid of all the old stuff. Throw
[1:54:58] out the trash.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Get rid of all of it. Don't go and
[1:55:03] associate with all the people who are
[1:55:04] broken. How are you ever going to grow
[1:55:08] if you stay with broken people?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; How many people get healed
[1:55:14] and want to stay in the hospital?
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; How many people do that?
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; When they get healed, they run.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; They don't like hospital food.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; They don't like hospital bathrooms. They
[1:55:28] don't like the nasty viruses that live
[1:55:30] in hospitals.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; They want to go home.
[1:55:35] There is a place of rest.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; And it's not in a broken place.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; We need to die there to our sacrifice.
[1:55:45] Having a dry-eyed confession, brothers
[1:55:47] and sisters, I'm sorry. It maybe I'm not
[1:55:49] sorry. It's not real. We need to have a
[1:55:52] real baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; a real experience in our lives where we
[1:55:57] can say that I know right there that I
[1:56:00] met the conditions that God requires for
[1:56:02] me in my life. And because of that, I
[1:56:04] can go back to it every single time the
[1:56:06] devil comes in like a flood.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Because just because we get saved, don't
[1:56:10] think the devil ain't coming in like a
[1:56:11] flood. He's coming in harder like a
[1:56:13] flood once we truly get saved.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; But what's going to happen is those
[1:56:17] things that were holding us back,
[1:56:19] holding us with all the sick people,
[1:56:21] with all the situations in our lives
[1:56:23] seemingly overpowering us, overwhelming
[1:56:26] us will start to fade away. And one day
[1:56:28] we'll scratch our head and say, "Wasn't
[1:56:30] I tempted by that before? I used to have
[1:56:32] that used to be a problem for me. And
[1:56:34] then you can really have thanksgiving in
[1:56:36] your heart and say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:56:37] When you come to church, something is
[1:56:39] going to be excited inside of you to be
[1:56:41] in church so that you can worship.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; We got to die to our die to our our
[1:56:49] tradition. I want to say it that way. We
[1:56:51] have to die there to our sacrifice. We
[1:56:53] have to identify ourselves. You know,
[1:56:55] there's people that maybe say they don't
[1:56:57] like the blood and all of that. They
[1:56:59] don't like the the teareyed confession
[1:57:01] and all of that. The children of Israel
[1:57:03] when they had to go in and actually
[1:57:04] bring a sacrifice once a year maybe for
[1:57:07] their family. It was the way that God
[1:57:08] ordained for them in the day in which
[1:57:10] they lived. They had to go and put their
[1:57:11] hands right on the head. Right on the
[1:57:14] head of that animal while the high
[1:57:16] priest actually slit the throat of that
[1:57:18] animal. Why did they have to do that?
[1:57:21] It's a death. It's not a birth. It's a
[1:57:23] death. But why did they have to do that?
[1:57:25] Because a a a death is a sign that there
[1:57:29] is going to be a life. That that blood
[1:57:31] that was coming out of that animal was
[1:57:33] that token in the day in which they
[1:57:35] lived.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; But you know, there could have been
[1:57:39] people that said, "I just don't like
[1:57:41] blood. I just don't like being there. I
[1:57:42] can't watch it. I can't touch it. I
[1:57:44] don't want to be there." And it was
[1:57:46] still outside of God's word. You could
[1:57:48] give the lamb to the priest and say, "Go
[1:57:50] ahead. I identified with it. I've got my
[1:57:52] name tag is around its neck." You know,
[1:57:53] you can undo it before you cut its
[1:57:55] throat and set it down and say, "This is
[1:57:57] the Johnson sacrifice." And proclaim it
[1:57:59] to the church. This is the Johnson
[1:58:01] sacrifice.
[1:58:02] Now, I'm going to slit its throat. No,
[1:58:05] it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't matter.
[1:58:08] It would be a stench in the nostril of
[1:58:09] God because he said, "You have to
[1:58:12] identify with your sacrifice."
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; And we have to identify with our
[1:58:17] sacrifice, brothers and sisters. There's
[1:58:19] no getting around it. Saying that we can
[1:58:20] have a dry-eyed confession and and a
[1:58:22] dry-eyed experience. I've got the
[1:58:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but I'm just
[1:58:25] going to never give God worship and I'm
[1:58:27] just going to be stoic and cold and I'm
[1:58:30] going to say it's my tradition. I'm
[1:58:31] never going to be able to have tears.
[1:58:33] There's never an emotion in my life when
[1:58:35] I come to church. The spirit of God
[1:58:36] never moves me, but I'm truly baptized
[1:58:38] with the Holy Ghost. Really? Has he
[1:58:42] saved you?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; If he has, you're going to give worship.
[1:58:48] Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; It's just the devil that wants to get in
[1:58:51] our life and say that I've got this
[1:58:53] thing. I've got this thing. I've got
[1:58:54] this thing. I've got an excuse. I've got
[1:58:56] a reason. Don't worry. I'm saved.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Someone else ain't going to worry. But I
[1:59:01] think you should.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; We should worry if we're not saved.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; We need to be buried in Christ
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and the world dead behind us. Not
[1:59:11] dragging it around and saying, "I'm
[1:59:13] trying to help other people." Those
[1:59:15] other people are going to take you down.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, they will.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I've heard it said, I'm not a lifeguard,
[1:59:21] but I've heard it said, there's probably
[1:59:22] people that know, smarter people than
[1:59:25] me, but when there's a drowning man,
[1:59:26] when you want to rescue that man, you
[1:59:28] can't actually grab him and then drag
[1:59:30] him by swimming. If you do, he's
[1:59:32] probably going to take you down because
[1:59:34] that man is in full panic mode.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; What he's going to do is take you down.
[1:59:38] I've heard it said that you've got to
[1:59:40] you got to knock him. You got to shock
[1:59:42] him to the place where he can no longer
[1:59:44] fight and you can rescue him.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I believe this word of God
[1:59:49] needs to do that to us.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; We've got to see that old man knocked
[1:59:52] out
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; otherwise he's going to drag us down.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He says you've got to be buried buried
[2:00:00] in Christ. The world is dead behind you
[2:00:03] and and you're to walk in a new life
[2:00:06] with Jesus Christ. not just be conformed
[2:00:08] to this message of the hour, but be
[2:00:10] transformed by this message of the hour.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And you're to walk in a new life with
[2:00:17] Christ Jesus in his resurrection. Last
[2:00:21] week we talked about the power of his
[2:00:22] resurrection. This is the power of his
[2:00:24] resurrection where the old man dies and
[2:00:27] there's a new man that comes to life
[2:00:29] inside of us. And people say to you,
[2:00:31] "What's wrong with you? Why don't you
[2:00:33] want to come out and party? What's wrong
[2:00:34] with you? Why don't you want to go and
[2:00:36] do this? What? Why? What's wrong? And
[2:00:40] all you can say is, you know what? I I I
[2:00:42] I I can't even explain it myself. It's
[2:00:45] something totally new to me. But you
[2:00:46] know what happens is eventually you get
[2:00:48] bored. You get tired of hearing people
[2:00:50] say, "Why? Why? Why?" You begin to want
[2:00:53] to hang out with people who say, "Praise
[2:00:55] the Lord. How long have you been saved?
[2:00:58] What's your testimony? How did you get
[2:01:00] the Holy Ghost? When did you hear about
[2:01:02] this message? What's God doing for you?"
[2:01:04] in your life right now today.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Because iron sharpens iron, doesn't it?
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Who would want to go back and live in a
[2:01:15] hospital? Who would want to do that?
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; You're to walk in a new life with Jesus
[2:01:21] Christ
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; in his resurrection, loving his word and
[2:01:26] taking his word. Watch him. This is so
[2:01:28] beautiful, brothers and sisters. Watch
[2:01:31] him. We don't need to do it. Watch him
[2:01:35] identifying himself in his word. And I
[2:01:39] want to say this, brother Barry's words,
[2:01:41] just inserting it into this quote. Watch
[2:01:44] him. Watch him identifying himself in
[2:01:47] his word in you.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; That's the new birth experience.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; That's where you can say somehow
[2:01:55] someway, I know that I am a new creature
[2:01:59] in Christ Jesus.
[2:02:01] something has taken place in my heart
[2:02:03] and I'm not the same person that I used
[2:02:05] to be.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; But he's identifying himself in his word
[2:02:09] as giving you the identification that
[2:02:11] you've passed from death unto life. What
[2:02:12] a time that we're living in. Yes, sir.
[2:02:17] What a time we're living in today. Yes,
[2:02:19] sir. That's out of the token.
[2:02:22] You know, brothers and sisters, don't
[2:02:23] get me wrong. Reflecting is not bad.
[2:02:27] Reflecting is important,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture that I read
[2:02:34] and uh I think it's in Isaiah.
[2:02:40] I think I might have read at the prayer
[2:02:41] meeting, but there's coming a time where
[2:02:45] it says in the word that we will think
[2:02:47] about how God actually saved us and
[2:02:50] delivered us, but there's going to come
[2:02:52] a place where we will remember those no
[2:02:55] more. But that means that we will
[2:02:59] actually have a time in our life where
[2:03:01] we are actually delivered and we do
[2:03:04] actually remember. I had a conversation
[2:03:06] with someone once and they asked me,
[2:03:08] "Will you be able to remember? Do you
[2:03:09] think we'll be able to remember the old
[2:03:11] selves when we're over there?" And I
[2:03:12] think we will.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; I think we will. There's going to come a
[2:03:16] time though where it won't matter
[2:03:18] anymore. where there's a new heaven and
[2:03:20] there's a new earth and a brand new way
[2:03:22] to live, a brand new way to think, a
[2:03:24] brand new way to exist. It's just not
[2:03:27] going to be relevant to think back to
[2:03:28] all these times. But I do believe we
[2:03:30] will have a very strong understanding
[2:03:33] and consciousness. We know the prophet
[2:03:35] said there will come a day where we'll
[2:03:36] understand everything. All of those
[2:03:39] hidden mysteries, all of those things
[2:03:40] that just happened throughout history
[2:03:42] where people just disappeared and
[2:03:44] there's no explanation. All those
[2:03:45] different things. He said, "All history
[2:03:47] will understand one day,
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; but reflecting isn't a bad thing."
[2:03:53] And I just want to make sure that I say
[2:03:54] that it's not bad to reflect. And I
[2:03:56] think it's important to reflect,
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; but it's very important to not actually
[2:04:01] remain reflecting.
[2:04:04] Sometimes we can do that and it can be
[2:04:06] to our detriment.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can reflect to a place
[2:04:10] where maybe we just can't get past in
[2:04:12] our life. Maybe we hurt someone really
[2:04:16] bad.
[2:04:18] If you've ever experienced that, you'll
[2:04:19] know what I mean. Sometimes you just
[2:04:22] seem to not be able to get over that and
[2:04:24] to reflect on that. If you do that,
[2:04:26] you'll never get past that. Sometimes
[2:04:28] someone has done something to us. And if
[2:04:32] we reflect on that all the time, we'll
[2:04:35] never get past it. We can remain stuck
[2:04:38] there in that reflection. And who wants
[2:04:41] to live in a reflection?
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; To me, that would be just like living in
[2:04:45] a hospital, maybe even worse, because a
[2:04:48] reflection is simply
[2:04:50] an illusion.
[2:04:52] It's it's a it's an example of what's
[2:04:54] actually taking place. We're not
[2:04:56] actually living in the moment. We're
[2:04:58] living in a memory in in something other
[2:05:00] than what's taking place. Remaining in a
[2:05:03] state of time that's in the past is
[2:05:06] going to actually hinder us. it will not
[2:05:10] deliver us.
[2:05:12] Just like me, for example, if I said
[2:05:14] that I I continually say that I hung out
[2:05:16] with drunks and I hung out with smokers
[2:05:18] and parters, and I know I I mention it a
[2:05:21] lot of times, but I do it for the
[2:05:22] purpose to bring glory to God because I
[2:05:25] know where he's brought me from. But if
[2:05:27] I continually talked about that over and
[2:05:29] over and over and over, and it was just
[2:05:30] anytime there was an opportunity to just
[2:05:32] tell someone that that's who I was, you
[2:05:35] know what would happen? My thinking
[2:05:36] would actually take me back there.
[2:05:38] Right?
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Before long, I would actually not be
[2:05:42] living the life that I'm living. I would
[2:05:44] be dwelling in that memory.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, I ain't never
[2:05:48] going back.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; No way am I going back down into that
[2:05:52] rat hole. No way.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; But remembering is important. Reflecting
[2:05:58] in our lives is important. But sometimes
[2:06:01] you can see people that remain stuck
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; in a reflection.
[2:06:07] and and what a what a terrible place to
[2:06:09] be. And I'm not saying that it's
[2:06:11] impossible for me to go there. I think
[2:06:13] every single human is subject to that.
[2:06:16] That's human nature. But we have been
[2:06:18] given a delivering power in the day in
[2:06:21] which we live. And that's truly the
[2:06:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost where we don't
[2:06:24] need to stay reflecting. We don't have
[2:06:27] to stay living in a reflection. A
[2:06:30] reflection is just a negative of what
[2:06:32] the positive actually is.
[2:06:38] But you know there's there's a a point
[2:06:40] where we need to actually reflect.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; We do need to reflect. Are we okay for
[2:06:45] time?
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; My clock says 11:46. So
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; to be absolutely fair, I think we have
[2:06:52] 14 minutes exactly
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving weekend.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Unless it was a long weekend. Yeah.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; And then we have the caveat. Hey,
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; right. where we can just let our hair
[2:07:04] down and just be in the presence of the
[2:07:05] Lord and
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and just feast spiritually while we have
[2:07:08] the opportunity.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Where else would I be?
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to drag us too long, but
[2:07:12] you know, brothers and sisters, brother
[2:07:14] Brandham, he talks about the Holy Ghost
[2:07:16] in the day in which we live in this
[2:07:18] message, the token, paragraph 127, he
[2:07:20] says, "Talk about a Thanksgiving day." I
[2:07:22] tell you, not a tradition.
[2:07:26] I tell you, not a tradition. Not at all.
[2:07:30] We got too many traditions now.
[2:07:34] My, this was in 1963.
[2:07:36] How many traditions do we have now?
[2:07:40] What we need today is a refreshing.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; A baptism of the Holy Spirit back in the
[2:07:47] church,
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; not a celebration, but a filling,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; but a filling.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, my true heart's
[2:07:55] desire is that every one of us would
[2:07:57] have that filling.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every one of us would have that
[2:08:01] token that we can see
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; that we can see God is identifying
[2:08:07] himself in our lives.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; not a tradition,
[2:08:17] not a celebration, but a filling. He
[2:08:20] says, "Then that ought to be our
[2:08:21] Thanksgiving Day celebration, as we
[2:08:23] would call it." Hey, we can give thanks
[2:08:26] every single week, twice a week, and
[2:08:29] maybe sometimes three times a week. That
[2:08:32] could be pushing our luck, though. Hey,
[2:08:34] sometimes if we have an extra service,
[2:08:36] it's tough. It's amazing to see what
[2:08:39] happens. The church is full on a Sunday,
[2:08:41] but you come communion service and it's
[2:08:43] half. Why is that,
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; We need a filling. Amen.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Then that ought to be our Thanksgiving
[2:08:52] Day celebration, as we would call it. It
[2:08:55] ought to be the Holy Spirit coming into
[2:08:57] our lives. If we could eat a turkey like
[2:09:01] our forefathers ate,
[2:09:06] we ought to receive the Holy Ghost,
[2:09:10] right? We ought to receive the Holy
[2:09:12] Ghost like the forefathers had. Amen.
[2:09:15] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Not a tradition, but a commandment from
[2:09:19] God. We should receive it. You know,
[2:09:20] there was times where people would
[2:09:22] actually have the baptism of the Holy
[2:09:24] Ghost. We saw it here. We saw it here.
[2:09:26] I'm going to say it this way. Asbury.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; What What state is that in?
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; North Carolina.
[2:09:34] Asbury in the US. We know it was just
[2:09:36] last year, wasn't it? They had this
[2:09:38] great outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:39] There was all these people. And what
[2:09:41] happened? And it caused the people in
[2:09:42] that university to not want to go home.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; They wanted to stay in the presence that
[2:09:47] was happening there. There was the Holy
[2:09:49] Spirit was taking place in their midst.
[2:09:52] And I'll tell you brothers and sisters,
[2:09:54] don't think because we belong to the
[2:09:55] message of the hour that it wasn't the
[2:09:57] Holy Ghost that was outpouring there.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; It's the same anointing. Brother
[2:10:02] Brandham said it in the day in which we
[2:10:03] live. It's the same anointing. It's just
[2:10:05] a different vessel.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Here we are with the open book,
[2:10:10] the full message of the hour.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Oren we to be excited about the word of
[2:10:15] God in which we live.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But if you say all night prayer
[2:10:20] meeting,
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; not a sound. I hear crickets.
[2:10:27] Why?
[2:10:28] Because it's the age in which we live
[2:10:30] in.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; We read about this on Wednesday. It's
[2:10:34] the pressures of this life. Why can't we
[2:10:37] pray the way we want to pray?
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Wednesday. It was during the
[2:10:41] prayer meeting. Why can't we pray the
[2:10:43] way we want to pray? It's in questions
[2:10:44] and answers in in Cood. Does anybody
[2:10:46] here ever feel like you can't pray the
[2:10:48] way the way you want to pray? You can be
[2:10:50] honest. Raise your hand. I'll tell you,
[2:10:52] I got both of my hands up because most
[2:10:54] of the times it feels like I can't pray
[2:10:56] the way I want to pray. I want to pray,
[2:10:58] but I just feel like, you know what,
[2:10:59] brother Bradom, he says it in the church
[2:11:01] in that in that book, Conduct, Order,
[2:11:02] and Doctrine. I have three sets left,
[2:11:04] four sets left at the back if you want a
[2:11:07] set. But he says it in there in
[2:11:09] questions and answers. Why? Someone's
[2:11:11] asked the question, why don't we pray
[2:11:13] the way we would want to pray? The
[2:11:14] reason is the revival's over.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; The world revival's over. It's the
[2:11:19] pressure you and I've heard ministers
[2:11:21] say it this way. You probably have heard
[2:11:23] too. Because the spirit of Christ is
[2:11:26] lifting off of the Gentiles and going
[2:11:29] back to the Jews. that's taking place
[2:11:31] right now in the age which we live in.
[2:11:33] Brothers and sisters, the revival's
[2:11:35] over, but there's still a bride's
[2:11:36] revival,
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; isn't there still a bride's revival?
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; But if we could eat a a a juicy turkey
[2:11:43] like the forefathers, how oughten we to
[2:11:46] worship
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; the way the forefathers did? Can't we
[2:11:48] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[2:11:50] way the forefathers did? Why would it be
[2:11:52] different for us in the day in which we
[2:11:54] live now and say that I'm a Canadian,
[2:11:56] Brother Barry. I've got this history and
[2:11:58] this tradition and this is the way that
[2:11:59] we do things. I've always done it this
[2:12:01] way. What? Why would we do that? What
[2:12:05] what we're doing is saying that it's not
[2:12:06] the same Holy Ghost. That's what we're
[2:12:08] saying.
[2:12:11] This is out of the token. But, you know,
[2:12:13] association matters. As we heard this
[2:12:15] summer, there was such a real nice
[2:12:19] gathering of brethren that came through
[2:12:20] this year. Just beautiful. And and I
[2:12:23] just can't get away from this thought
[2:12:25] about how association matters. And
[2:12:27] remember when brother Danny Delmundo was
[2:12:29] here, he talked about the the daughters
[2:12:32] as of Zofhiad,
[2:12:34] Numbers 27. What was their claim to
[2:12:38] fame? They never had brothers. There was
[2:12:39] no way they were going to receive an
[2:12:41] inheritance in their land because there
[2:12:43] was no male. There was no seed raised up
[2:12:45] with the the male portion, no boy with
[2:12:48] the the family name. But what did they
[2:12:50] do? They went to the prophet of God and
[2:12:52] they said, "Listen,
[2:12:53] listen.
[2:12:55] We have one claim to fame and that's not
[2:12:57] ours. It's not even our claim.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; It was daddy's claim
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; and that's that he was not in the
[2:13:04] company of them that gathered themselves
[2:13:06] together against the Lord."
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Wait a second. Didn't they gather
[2:13:12] themselves together against Moses?
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Wasn't it against Moses?
[2:13:19] It was totally against the prophet. It
[2:13:21] was against Moses.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; But it says here that they never
[2:13:24] gathered themselves together against the
[2:13:26] Lord.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because the word of God
[2:13:30] says, "Touch not my anointed.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Neither do my prophets no harm."
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; But their claim was that he was not in
[2:13:39] the company of them that gathered
[2:13:40] themselves together against the Lord in
[2:13:42] the company of Kora. Now I'm saying this
[2:13:44] out of the context of this that
[2:13:46] association matters.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Right? It does.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; It very much matters.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Very much matters.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And this is where when we want to say
[2:13:56] that, yeah, I've got Jesus Christ. He's
[2:13:58] right there. I can see. And you know,
[2:14:00] the world says it that there's many
[2:14:01] roads lead to home, right? And sure
[2:14:04] enough, through the denominational
[2:14:06] realms, there are many roads that will
[2:14:07] lead people potentially to eternal life.
[2:14:10] But for the bride of Jesus Christ, which
[2:14:12] is the true church, the one that he
[2:14:14] calls his own, that one will only come
[2:14:18] through the token of their day.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that it's going to
[2:14:23] happen.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; And I think it's a it's maybe a fearful
[2:14:27] thing for people that just choose to
[2:14:28] say, "I'm never going to subscribe to
[2:14:31] that guy called William Marryiam Brham."
[2:14:33] It would be a fearful thing because what
[2:14:36] if it's true?
[2:14:39] What if it's true?
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Are we willing to just wait and see?
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, I ain't willing to
[2:14:46] wait and see.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; But I know that I I just know that it it
[2:14:50] does something to me. It's done
[2:14:51] something for me. And and I could never
[2:14:53] walk away from it. I could never let it
[2:14:54] go. In fact, I could preach about it all
[2:14:56] day long. But, you know, we need to make
[2:14:58] sure that we understand association
[2:15:00] matters.
[2:15:02] If we're going to associate with people
[2:15:04] that want to chatter, chatter, chatter,
[2:15:06] negative, negative, negative, guess
[2:15:08] what? It matters.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; And it matters a whole lot more than
[2:15:13] maybe we think if we're still doing it.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; We haven't got the revelation that it
[2:15:19] matters. But I'm telling you today, it
[2:15:22] matters a lot.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; It matters a lot. We know in this day,
[2:15:25] the ground opened up and swallowed all
[2:15:27] those people. Moses said, "Whoever's for
[2:15:28] God, come and stand with me." and anyone
[2:15:31] else. Hey, take your chances. And we
[2:15:34] know the earth opened up and swallowed
[2:15:36] them up. But, you know, I I don't want
[2:15:38] to dwell too much about that. I just
[2:15:39] want to say that those those daughters,
[2:15:41] they associated themselves with their
[2:15:44] daddy. Their daddy did not associate
[2:15:47] himself
[2:15:48] with unbelief.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; He just simply maybe said to them, "You
[2:15:53] know what, honeys? Maybe you don't
[2:15:56] understand it. Maybe you can't explain
[2:15:57] it. I can't even explain it to you
[2:15:59] entirely. But what that does is it
[2:16:01] causes there to be a space for faith. It
[2:16:05] takes faith to believe the word of God.
[2:16:07] In fact, it's impossible to please God
[2:16:09] without faith.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; So, if we're going to try and explain it
[2:16:13] all away, then there's no room for
[2:16:14] faith. And I'll guarantee you, we're not
[2:16:16] pleasing God.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Because we become scientists of the
[2:16:20] word. Scientist of the devil is what the
[2:16:23] prophet said.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Let's not get too far on that. But you
[2:16:27] know talking about association and how
[2:16:29] it matters. Brother Bradam he says
[2:16:33] now tonight why don't you accept
[2:16:37] not that natural life which has to go
[2:16:41] back with the dead substance of the
[2:16:43] earth. But why don't you accept the
[2:16:45] eternal life where he gave something,
[2:16:48] raised it up, his own son, that you
[2:16:51] could be conformed unto his own image
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; by the renewing of your spirit. And we
[2:16:57] know the word of God says by the
[2:16:59] renewing of your mind to take away yours
[2:17:03] and to receive his.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Which is the token that you have life.
[2:17:10] And you know, brothers and sisters, I
[2:17:11] know from experience that the devil's
[2:17:13] going to say to you, "But I don't I just
[2:17:15] don't want to give this up." And and I
[2:17:16] don't know, that's a little bit weird. I
[2:17:18] just don't think that I can possibly go
[2:17:20] there. I guarantee you that he is life
[2:17:23] and joy.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you if you ever taste of
[2:17:27] that heavenly gift, you will never want
[2:17:30] to go back.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; You will never want to go back. That's
[2:17:33] why it says in Hebrews chapter 6, for
[2:17:36] it's impossible for those who were once
[2:17:37] enlightened. It's impossible for those
[2:17:39] who've been enlightened to ever go back.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; They can't.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; But he says to take away yours and
[2:17:48] receive his, which is the token that you
[2:17:50] have life, and he'll pass over you and
[2:17:52] will raise you up at the day of
[2:17:55] resurrection. This would be a real
[2:17:58] thanksgiving. This would show your
[2:18:00] gratefulness to God who made a way for
[2:18:02] you and placed eternal life before you
[2:18:05] upon his own table and is inviting you
[2:18:08] to it tonight.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's still calling?
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "How could you turn it away?
[2:18:17] How could you sit at the table and be
[2:18:18] grateful for natural foods in a
[2:18:20] tradition that our pilgrim fathers did
[2:18:22] on a Thanksgiving day? Why not now when
[2:18:25] it's made so clear to you tonight by
[2:18:28] this simple little way of preaching it?
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Why don't you accept it now?
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; And say, "I want that kind of life,
[2:18:36] Brother Brandham."
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; I'll accept that.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus died for me.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; And maybe I've joined church. I've had a
[2:18:46] creed.
[2:18:49] but really to see the life of Christ
[2:18:52] just pulsating in me.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, that's the token.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; That's the life. That's the blood that
[2:19:01] we talked about from Exodus 12:12. That
[2:19:03] truly is the blood that will cause the
[2:19:05] death angel to pass over. Satan will
[2:19:07] have no hold over us. Now, don't get me
[2:19:11] wrong. I'm not calling the death angel
[2:19:12] from Exodus 12:12 because it says, "I
[2:19:14] will pass over you." I'm not saying that
[2:19:15] he was Satan. I'm not saying that. What
[2:19:18] I am saying is that the devil is going
[2:19:20] about as a roaring lion seeking whom he
[2:19:23] may devour.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that token, guess
[2:19:26] what?
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; He can devour.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; He has full authority to to devour. If
[2:19:32] we don't have that token and that's why
[2:19:34] the prophet said that we need to be the
[2:19:35] token for our children. I'm always going
[2:19:37] to say that. We've got to
[2:19:40] Why don't you accept it now and say, "I
[2:19:43] want that kind of life, brother
[2:19:45] Brandham.
[2:19:46] I'll accept that Jesus died for me.
[2:19:50] And maybe I've joined church. I've had a
[2:19:53] creed. But really to see the life of
[2:19:56] Christ just pulsating in me till the
[2:19:58] world is dead and he living his life in
[2:20:02] me like he lived it here on earth.
[2:20:06] I don't see it, brother Brandham. And I
[2:20:09] want to have it. I want to be sure.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; I want to say it this morning. How many
[2:20:14] people want to be sure? How many of us
[2:20:16] want to have it?
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; You know, it's good to reflect and and
[2:20:24] it's good to understand that there is an
[2:20:26] importance with identification
[2:20:30] having association
[2:20:32] like those daughters we talked about
[2:20:35] from numbers.
[2:20:37] I I think it's wonderful to think how
[2:20:39] brother Brady says that if we were to
[2:20:41] leave here this world if we left this
[2:20:43] world before next Thanksgiving again the
[2:20:46] day of thanksgiving that every day in
[2:20:48] our life shall be a thanksgiving.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; That the world still lives that we are
[2:20:54] identified with him in death, burial and
[2:20:58] resurrection.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; You know association matters. It matters
[2:21:05] so much. It took me a long time to
[2:21:08] actually get here, but I know it. I can
[2:21:10] see it.
[2:21:12] I know some people are saying, "Yeah,
[2:21:14] Brother Barry, it's taken so long for
[2:21:16] you to get here. Would you just get
[2:21:17] there?"
[2:21:20] But I'm talking about in my life, in my
[2:21:21] Christian walk. It's taken me a while to
[2:21:24] get here. And I've been here for a
[2:21:26] while. Don't get me wrong. It's not a
[2:21:27] new revelation.
[2:21:29] But you know, we're talking about
[2:21:31] association and how important it is. The
[2:21:34] people in in Kora's day, they were
[2:21:36] swallowed up by the world. And and it's
[2:21:38] going to be the same thing in the day in
[2:21:40] which we live. If we're not actually
[2:21:42] willing to actually follow the word of
[2:21:44] God according to what he has given us
[2:21:46] through his prophet, then we will be
[2:21:47] swallowed up by the world. Our children
[2:21:49] will be swallowed up by the world. Our
[2:21:50] families will be swallowed up by the
[2:21:52] world. We'll still be alive and well. We
[2:21:54] might not be sick. We might not even be
[2:21:56] living in a hospital. We might not have
[2:21:58] tremendous vices in our lives. We might
[2:22:00] be productive members of society, but
[2:22:02] we're going to be spiritually void.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; We'll be completely controlled by the
[2:22:07] devil when he comes around and says, "I
[2:22:10] want you to do this." We'll be like, "I
[2:22:13] don't want to do it." Okay, let's do it.
[2:22:16] That's what will happen. But when we're
[2:22:18] saved, when the devil comes around, he
[2:22:19] still says the same thing. I want you to
[2:22:22] do it. You're going to be like, "Buzz
[2:22:24] off. What was I doing? Maybe reading the
[2:22:27] newspaper. He'll snap the paper and
[2:22:29] continue reading. He'll come and do it
[2:22:30] again. You'll be like, "Get lost."
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; He'll come and do it again. He'll be
[2:22:33] like, "Oh my, in the name of Jesus, I
[2:22:36] rebuke you, Satan.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Beat it."
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; And then he'll be gone.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; There's overcoming power. That's the
[2:22:44] difference.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; But this association that we're talking
[2:22:48] about, there's no shortcuts to Jesus
[2:22:51] Christ in the day in which we live. to
[2:22:52] say that we believe God sent a prophet.
[2:22:54] He's a good man, but I'm just not going
[2:22:56] to actually follow his way. I'm going to
[2:22:57] go my way and say that I can get to
[2:23:00] Jesus just the same way. Sure enough,
[2:23:01] you can, but that's tribulation
[2:23:03] material.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he talks about this
[2:23:06] this scripture here, how association
[2:23:08] matters. It's very important. Matthewap
[2:23:11] 10:40.
[2:23:14] Matthew chap 10:40. Very, very familiar
[2:23:17] scripture. I'm sure it is for those
[2:23:19] people who believe the message. He said,
[2:23:21] "He that receiveth you receiveth me, and
[2:23:23] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[2:23:25] sent me." And we know that's Jesus
[2:23:27] speaking. And everyone can say,
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; All of Christianity, all the
[2:23:34] denominations, they all relate to that
[2:23:36] right there. They say, "Amen." Because I
[2:23:38] receive you. Oh my. But here's where it
[2:23:41] gets down to brass tax.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; This is where the rubber meets the road.
[2:23:44] Verse 41. He that receiveth a prophet in
[2:23:47] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[2:23:49] prophet's reward.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't want a prophet's reward
[2:23:54] today?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; And he that receiveth a righteous man in
[2:23:57] the name of a righteous man shall
[2:23:59] receive a righteous man's reward. And
[2:24:01] whosoever shall give drink unto one of
[2:24:04] these little ones a cup of cold water.
[2:24:08] Now listen to what he says here. He
[2:24:09] doesn't say in the name of a prophet. He
[2:24:11] doesn't say it in the name of Jesus. He
[2:24:13] says, "In the name of a disciple,
[2:24:17] verily I say unto you, he shall in no
[2:24:19] wise lose his reward."
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Who's a disciple of Jesus today?
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; The whole room should put their hands
[2:24:26] up. Yeah. Amen. We're disciples of
[2:24:28] Jesus. So, if anybody gives us a cup of
[2:24:31] cold water in the name of any one of us,
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; look at this God that we serve.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; We've got every reason to rejoice. Hey,
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; isn't that beautiful? But this part that
[2:24:42] I wanted to get to, he that receiveth a
[2:24:44] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[2:24:45] receive a prophet's reward.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Association matters.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Association is very, very important.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Saying that we believe the word of God,
[2:24:57] but I just don't believe this prophet
[2:24:58] all the way.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; What's a prophet's reward? Again, if
[2:25:06] you're interested, I know we have
[2:25:08] questions and answers, excuse me, on the
[2:25:10] apps, but sometimes the books are good.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; there's four sets in the back. What's a
[2:25:16] prophet's reward? It's a question that's
[2:25:18] asked directly. There's a whole bunch of
[2:25:21] section in there that's about
[2:25:22] scriptures. What does this scripture
[2:25:24] mean? What does that scripture mean?
[2:25:26] What does the other scripture mean? It's
[2:25:28] not all just questions and answers. But
[2:25:30] here we have this one. What's a
[2:25:32] prophet's reward? And I'm sure everybody
[2:25:34] knows what a prophet's reward is. I know
[2:25:36] that uh I I I I I hung on this for a
[2:25:39] long time and I do believe it's a part
[2:25:40] of it. I haven't given up on it. I
[2:25:43] haven't. But I always take what the
[2:25:46] prophet said above what I think.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Always. And you know, I I I I stuck with
[2:25:51] this where brother Bradom was over on
[2:25:53] the other side and and he had his horse
[2:25:56] nighing on his shoulder. Remember when
[2:25:58] he went beyond the curtain of time and
[2:26:00] he saw his dog Fritz and that one that
[2:26:03] was killed by that man, poisoned by that
[2:26:05] man, and you know, he heard that voice
[2:26:07] say that all you ever loved and all that
[2:26:10] ever loved you is going to be here.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; That's that's your prophet's reward.
[2:26:13] That's what you get. And and I can't
[2:26:15] help but think that's the same for the
[2:26:16] believers.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; But I could be wrong with that. I don't
[2:26:20] know. Is it going to matter whether my
[2:26:22] dead hamster's there from when I was six
[2:26:24] years old and I loved him so much and I
[2:26:26] had to realize what it meant that the
[2:26:28] things you love in this world, they have
[2:26:29] to die. Is that going to be there? I
[2:26:32] don't know. My dog chick, will she be
[2:26:35] there? I don't know. Is it going to
[2:26:37] matter? I don't know.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; But what does matter?
[2:26:42] The prophet's reward. He that receiveth
[2:26:44] a prophet, the name of the prophet shall
[2:26:46] receive a prophet's reward. So what's
[2:26:47] the prophet's reward? Brother Brandham
[2:26:50] says it exactly, clearly, concisely,
[2:26:53] precisely. He says to be a friend of the
[2:26:56] prophet,
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; that's the prophet's reward.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean? Going to have
[2:27:04] your pet dog there, your hamster, your
[2:27:06] gerbal, your goldfish, whatever. Is that
[2:27:09] going to be the what what we're looking
[2:27:10] for? I don't think so. Brother Bradomy
[2:27:13] says it this way. He says to be a friend
[2:27:15] of the prophet, you you might need it
[2:27:17] someday. Amen.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; You might need it someday. And what does
[2:27:22] that mean? Even if you step back and
[2:27:25] think about it, he goes on to say, "Do
[2:27:27] you remember the Shounomite woman?"
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; In the context of this question, who was
[2:27:34] the Shounomite woman? She was the one
[2:27:36] that was praying that God would send her
[2:27:38] Elijah
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; because she was going out to fix her
[2:27:41] last meal. Remember?
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; That was it. two sticks, put them
[2:27:47] together.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "Hey, you
[2:27:51] know what?" He came out of his place and
[2:27:53] he said to her, "Why don't you actually
[2:27:55] fix me some some food? I'm I'm I'm
[2:27:58] pretty hungry. I've been fasting for
[2:27:59] days since this brook slowly dried up
[2:28:02] and I got no more food. Why don't you
[2:28:04] fix me a cake first?"
[2:28:06] And she had the opportunity to accept
[2:28:08] that level. I'm going to put my life and
[2:28:11] my son's life into the hands of this man
[2:28:13] now, this prophet here. I'm going to say
[2:28:16] his life is more important than ours.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; What he says is more important. I'm
[2:28:20] going to stake our very existence
[2:28:23] on his word.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; How many mamas would do that?
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; She baked him a cake. And what happened?
[2:28:32] We know that she was blessed abundantly.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; But I want to take it out of there,
[2:28:36] brothers and sisters. I don't want it to
[2:28:37] be that far back. 2,000 years, 3,000
[2:28:40] years, 1500 years, whatever, 1,700
[2:28:42] years. I don't want to be there because
[2:28:44] it's good to talk about. It's good to
[2:28:46] reflect on. But association matters
[2:28:48] because she associated herself with that
[2:28:50] prophet's word. She received a prophet's
[2:28:53] reward. She was a friend of the prophet.
[2:28:55] Remember the other woman? She had a son.
[2:28:57] She had a husband. She didn't even have
[2:29:00] a son. She just had a husband. But
[2:29:01] what'd she say? You know what? This man
[2:29:03] of God, he keeps coming by. Let's just
[2:29:05] build him a little shed on the side of
[2:29:06] our house. Let's hard jointed together.
[2:29:08] Give him a bed, a place to rest. Give
[2:29:10] him some fresh water. give him a candle,
[2:29:12] maybe a chair and a desk to study by and
[2:29:15] a window to look out. Let's look after
[2:29:16] this guy. And what happened? She was
[2:29:18] able to receive her son.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; We know that that was a direct result of
[2:29:24] that. And then one day her son actually
[2:29:27] had a headache and died. What'd she do?
[2:29:29] She saddled an ass
[2:29:32] and she rode. She said, "I ain't letting
[2:29:34] anybody get in the way." And she went
[2:29:36] right directly to that prophet again.
[2:29:38] Why? because she was friends.
[2:29:42] Friends with that prophet
[2:29:47] to be a friend of the prophet
[2:29:49] is the answer.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; You might need it someday.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; You know, talking about the Shounomite
[2:29:56] woman of the days of old, what about the
[2:29:58] Shounomite woman of our generation?
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; This is where it gets good, brothers and
[2:30:04] sisters. I think it's really really good
[2:30:06] because this Shounomite woman in the day
[2:30:08] in which we live, she never even heard
[2:30:10] of William Mary and Brham, had she?
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; But yet somehow she was able to have a
[2:30:15] plane stop out of the air,
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; land in an airport in her city,
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; with a prophet,
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; have the plane held, put him up
[2:30:28] overnight, and have something tell him
[2:30:30] to walk.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:35] But the beautiful thing is she was able
[2:30:38] to recognize him.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; How do you explain that? That's the
[2:30:42] spirit of God.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; How can we explain salvation to that one
[2:30:46] thief that was on the cross? He all he's
[2:30:49] going to say is, "I met Christ. I met
[2:30:51] this guy
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; that one day
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; on Calvary."
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; And I think it's got to be the same way
[2:30:57] for us. We have to say that one day when
[2:30:59] I recognize the power of Calvary in my
[2:31:01] own life.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; But that Shounomite woman praying for
[2:31:07] her son who was dying of a social
[2:31:09] disease was able to call Elijah on the
[2:31:12] scene.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; She did.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Association matters.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz one day you might need it.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray to Jesus
[2:31:24] and Jesus is going to say, "I gave you
[2:31:26] the way.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; I gave you the truth and I gave you the
[2:31:29] life." Now, don't don't take what I'm
[2:31:31] saying and say that I'm saying we should
[2:31:32] pray to a prophet because that is
[2:31:34] blasphemous.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; That is antichrist. The only one we pray
[2:31:39] to is Jesus Christ.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; But we're never going to access him the
[2:31:44] way we want to without him, without
[2:31:47] going through the message of the hour.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. Amen.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; But this woman, she was able to she was
[2:31:56] able to access Jesus Christ without
[2:31:59] knowing about the message of the hour.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; It's pretty amazing.
[2:32:05] But I think it's just exactly what her
[2:32:07] prayer was. Send me my Elijah. Where is
[2:32:11] my Elijah?
[2:32:13] And how much more ought we to be having
[2:32:16] thanksgiving knowing that he has sent
[2:32:17] us, not only sent us, but we can
[2:32:19] recognize Elijah in the day in which we
[2:32:22] live. Even Elisha who followed him,
[2:32:24] Elisha, when he went to the waters and
[2:32:27] he had the mantle, what did he do? He
[2:32:29] took the mantle and he smoked the waters
[2:32:31] and he said, "What? Where is the God of
[2:32:35] Elijah?"
[2:32:41] Hebrews 13:8. Brothers and sisters,
[2:32:44] as we close, I can see I'm over time.
[2:32:48] I'll call the musicians.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; You know, I just believe that as we go
[2:32:56] forwards, every single day, this world
[2:32:58] is changing so swiftly. We see so many
[2:33:02] different behaviors taking place.
[2:33:05] The enemy is coming in like a flood. We
[2:33:08] can see it everywhere.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; There's legislation that's already
[2:33:11] tabled, already in parliament,
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; working towards changing the way that we
[2:33:16] function as a church.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; It's actually in Parliament right now,
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; working on being passed as a law.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; And what that is is to destroy the
[2:33:27] charter,
[2:33:29] the charter of the what is it? the the
[2:33:32] society to be able to have the the the
[2:33:35] charitable organization is what it is to
[2:33:38] eliminate those statuses. If you
[2:33:40] actually have anything to do about
[2:33:42] coming against the LGBTQ movement, if
[2:33:46] you have any of that hate speech, then
[2:33:47] they're working on actually destroying
[2:33:49] it, saying that you're not a valid uh
[2:33:52] organization anymore. And that's the
[2:33:55] beginning of the end where they will
[2:33:57] close the doors of these churches,
[2:33:58] brothers and sisters. Because we ain't
[2:34:00] never going to, as long as I'm here
[2:34:01] anyways, we ain't never going to say
[2:34:04] that's right.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; We're going to say that's wrong because
[2:34:07] that's the word of God.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; It is absolutely abomination before the
[2:34:13] eyes of the Lord.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; But you know, we're in a time of
[2:34:18] decision and every single day is just a
[2:34:21] series of decisions, isn't it?
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; It is. That's all we we do is make
[2:34:26] decisions in our lives every day. We
[2:34:28] make a decision to live or die.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we do. We make a decision to
[2:34:33] live or die. And that's naturally and
[2:34:36] spiritually.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; In a time of decision, brother Brandham,
[2:34:40] he says, maybe stand with me as we close
[2:34:42] today. He says, "Don't care if this one
[2:34:44] walks or that one walks. I'm going to
[2:34:46] walk anyhow.
[2:34:48] I don't care whether this one if what
[2:34:50] they say. I I they can call me anything
[2:34:53] they want to. So, I'm going anyhow. Why?
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; The life is in the blood.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; The same exact blood.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; That was shed on Calvary. The life is in
[2:35:04] the blood. The same exact blood that was
[2:35:06] shed before the foundation of the world
[2:35:08] that we talked about as a type in the
[2:35:11] book of Exodus today. The very same
[2:35:13] blood. The life is in the blood.
[2:35:17] And the life is in the church. The
[2:35:20] Christian that's born again by the
[2:35:22] spirit of God. Amen.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; That's where the life is. The life is
[2:35:25] not inside this building.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; But even though we're inside this
[2:35:29] building, that life is inside this
[2:35:31] building. But as soon as we all leave,
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; we take his life with us.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; They can call me anything they want to.
[2:35:41] I'm going anyhow. Why? The life is in
[2:35:42] the blood. And the life is in the
[2:35:44] church. And the Christian that's born
[2:35:46] again by the spirit of God. That's the
[2:35:48] spirit of life. Blood relation to
[2:35:51] Christ. The spirit of Christ in the
[2:35:53] blood of Christ leading a child of
[2:35:55] Christ. The seed of Abraham. The royal
[2:35:58] seed of Abraham. That's what the royal
[2:35:59] seed of Abraham is. Somebody who has
[2:36:01] that life inside of them. That's why
[2:36:03] they move peculiar peculiarly.
[2:36:07] That's why the world thinks so strange
[2:36:10] of them. And that's why it feels like we
[2:36:14] don't ever want to go there because
[2:36:15] that's just a little bit fanatical.
[2:36:17] That's just a little bit weird. We'll
[2:36:18] never be comfortable in this life. I can
[2:36:20] tell you, you will never be more
[2:36:21] comfortable in this life.
[2:36:23] Not because this world feels
[2:36:25] comfortable, but because you have that
[2:36:27] blessed assurance.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; That you know that you know that you
[2:36:30] know if your time has come to actually
[2:36:33] cross over, if your number is picked, if
[2:36:36] your flower is clipped, if you're going
[2:36:38] to go, you know that you're not going to
[2:36:41] actually perish. He says, "And remember
[2:36:43] Rebecca hardly knowing what she was
[2:36:45] doing. And yet she watered the same
[2:36:47] animal, the camel that was to take her
[2:36:49] to the bridegroom to her husband, her
[2:36:51] lover. And always a beast burdened in
[2:36:54] the Bible represents power like the
[2:36:56] beast come up out of the sea. In
[2:36:58] Revelation, it was a power that raised
[2:37:00] up among people.
[2:37:03] And this beast being watered. Rebecca
[2:37:06] watering the same beast that she rode on
[2:37:11] that taken her away from her place here
[2:37:14] to her new home is a type of the church
[2:37:19] today.
[2:37:20] Watering and blessing the same Holy
[2:37:24] Spirit that's going to lift it up and
[2:37:28] take it to its new home. Remember
[2:37:31] brothers and sisters, the blessing,
[2:37:33] blessings fall at the end of the
[2:37:35] service.
[2:37:37] That's where hearts are changed. The
[2:37:39] word has gone forth and we have the
[2:37:42] opportunity to water that word with our
[2:37:44] praise.
[2:37:46] Remember the prayer lines, they didn't
[2:37:47] start at the front of the services with
[2:37:49] brother Brandham. Why is that? We know
[2:37:52] why. It's always at the end. But we have
[2:37:55] the opportunity to water that Holy
[2:37:58] Spirit. That Holy Spirit that's going to
[2:38:00] lift it up and take it to its new home.
[2:38:03] The church that's praising and blessing
[2:38:05] and watering with thanksgiving to the
[2:38:08] Holy Ghost who has brought the word to
[2:38:11] you.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; We have the opportunity to water that
[2:38:16] same Holy Ghost today.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you, brothers and
[2:38:20] sisters. I trust you have a wonderful
[2:38:22] weekend of thanksgiving.
[2:38:25] And as we fellowship around our tables,
[2:38:29] I just want to encourage us to remember
[2:38:32] remember Christ. Remember the true
[2:38:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; And because of that, we have every
[2:38:38] single reason to be thankful.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you today.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[2:38:45] your goodness to us.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we
[2:38:50] have your word, Lord, that we've been
[2:38:52] given the ability to receive it in its
[2:38:54] fullness.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that through that it
[2:38:59] begins to live out through us.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; We don't want to make excuses for it.
[2:39:04] And Father, if we've ever made excuses
[2:39:06] for it, we pray that you would forgive
[2:39:07] us.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Lord Jesus, this morning I
[2:39:11] just want to ask, Father, if there's
[2:39:12] anybody here, Lord, that is struggling
[2:39:16] in their mind, in their heart, Father,
[2:39:17] that just hasn't been able to come to
[2:39:19] that place where they can know you in
[2:39:21] the power of your resurrection. Father,
[2:39:24] I pray that in the name of Jesus, you
[2:39:26] would set them free according to your
[2:39:28] word. Father, that they would be able to
[2:39:30] step out of that that bondage that
[2:39:32] they've been held under and realize that
[2:39:35] they truly are a a son or a daughter of
[2:39:38] the most high God.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that a a season of of
[2:39:42] thanksgiving would begin to take place
[2:39:45] in their life, Father, where they would
[2:39:46] just, Lord Jesus, be able to look to you
[2:39:50] and recognize what you've done all the
[2:39:52] way along in their lives. Oh father,
[2:39:54] when we come to that place of a new
[2:39:56] birth, we can see your hand in our lives
[2:39:58] from the very beginning all the way up.
[2:40:01] So many things happen in our lives that
[2:40:03] we just can never explain. And Lord,
[2:40:05] once we get saved, we can do it. We can
[2:40:07] say that was you
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; truly your hand in our lives. You have
[2:40:11] kept us by your goodness and your mercy.
[2:40:14] And we thank you for it, Lord. Thank you
[2:40:16] for your word and the ability to receive
[2:40:19] it in the day in which we live now.
[2:40:21] Father, we pray that you would just go
[2:40:23] with us, Lord, as we go our separate
[2:40:24] ways. But before we do, Lord, we pray
[2:40:26] that you would just receive some worship
[2:40:29] from our hearts, Lord. That it would be
[2:40:31] truly from your throne back to you, Lord
[2:40:33] Jesus, the throne room of our hearts.
[2:40:36] Father, we pray that you would be with
[2:40:37] those who couldn't be here today,
[2:40:39] wherever they are, whatever they're
[2:40:41] doing, Lord, we just ask that you would
[2:40:43] bless them abundantly, Father, above all
[2:40:46] they could ask or think. And if it's
