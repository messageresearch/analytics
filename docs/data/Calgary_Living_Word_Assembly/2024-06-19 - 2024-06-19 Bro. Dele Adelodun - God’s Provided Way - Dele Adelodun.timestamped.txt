[51:18] to greet the rest of the
[51:20] numbers so the Lord bless you we are
[51:23] happy to be here tonight amen and we

[51:29] Justice family brother Justice family
[51:32] was has been our landlord since 2015 and
[51:36] they are so glad to retain the title
[51:39] amen but along the line you know last
[51:41] week we passed by here quietly because
[51:44] we had services in and mon but our
[51:47] flight was routed to KAG so we spend the
[51:50] night with brob and there it was such a
[51:53] wonderful time so God bless all of you
[51:56] amen
[51:57] tonight if the Lord will be our help
[52:00] which I trust he will I want to speak uh
[52:05] just to encourage you on a subject I
[52:08] called God's provided
[52:10] way God's provided way I took
[52:14] inspiration for this
[52:16] subject where the O
[52:19] is ah okay God bless you I bring
[52:23] greetings from brother and the Saints
[52:26] amen I had privilege to be in service
[52:29] not too long and they told me when you
[52:32] come here greet our people so I'm
[52:34] greeting their
[52:36] people all right so I took inspiration
[52:40] for this subject on and experience uh
[52:43] the prophet shared with us in the
[52:45] message you must be born
[52:48] again uh in this message he and the
[52:51] brother who then wasn't a message
[52:55] believer uh they call him brother Marion
[52:58] Lee uh they were good friends even
[53:01] though he wasn't a Believer but they
[53:04] have good
[53:06] attraction uh in the sense that anytime
[53:09] they have an opportunity to be together
[53:12] they want to talk about the things of
[53:14] God so the that is to say mind what you
[53:18] talk about when you have when you meet
[53:20] with people amen the prophet said if the
[53:23] love of God is in our heart we won't
[53:25] talk a whole day with people people
[53:27] without chipping in the love of God so
[53:30] brother Lee and brother Braham find good
[53:33] comfort in spending time together
[53:36] especially around the world and the
[53:39] prophet we always tell brother Lee that
[53:42] if you really want to be born again it
[53:44] goes with repentance and water baptism
[53:47] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[53:50] remission of your sins then you will
[53:52] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[53:55] brotherly believe that it should repent
[53:57] but he doesn't see anything much about
[53:59] water
[54:00] baptism so and the prophet will say it's
[54:03] essential to your Christian experience
[54:06] if you want your sins remitted and uh
[54:09] you shouldn't go into water just like
[54:12] that you must go by Divine prescription
[54:15] if he says do it in the name Jesus
[54:17] Christ you won't get any better until
[54:20] you do it like that amen so brother Lee
[54:23] we argue that and but some for some
[54:26] reason they still got along fine so on a
[54:29] particular day they were staying in the
[54:31] same house passing the night in the same
[54:34] room that day and because brother Lee
[54:37] was a seed of God yes at God's Own
[54:41] appointed time he will find a way to
[54:43] register the message if somebody is a
[54:46] seed of God you don't make too much
[54:48] trouble about him when God is ready for
[54:51] him he will bring him home so what God
[54:54] did was to give Lee a dream
[54:57] dream and in that dream God was dealing
[55:00] with Lee the way his mind runs Lee was a
[55:03] building contractor so he gave him a
[55:06] message of building
[55:08] contraction God is not really far from
[55:11] hor he can deal with us explain his will
[55:14] to us by the simple simple daily things
[55:17] that we do so he came to Lee by way of a
[55:21] dream and you know Lee saw himself
[55:23] having conversation with a man who who
[55:26] wanted to build a house so he gave him
[55:29] the building contract that you know help
[55:32] me build my house but you see this man
[55:35] when he came he had his own idea of what
[55:38] he want build so he came with his
[55:41] blueprint he wasn't going to rely on the
[55:43] sensus of Lee he had what he wanted in
[55:47] mind he knew what he wanted so he gave
[55:50] Lee the design and he said I'm going on
[55:53] vacation to Florida get my house ready
[55:56] before before I returned and they sealed
[55:59] the transaction so while Lee was
[56:03] building according to Lee he saw some
[56:06] structur some things maybe like window
[56:09] like doors or like pillars that ought
[56:12] not to be where he put
[56:14] them and by his own personal judgment he
[56:18] changed them he removed certain things
[56:21] he haded certain things he changed the
[56:24] position of certain things and in his
[56:26] own mindset he had the house
[56:29] ready so when the man came uh Lee have
[56:33] you finished my house very well but you
[56:36] see unfortunately for Lee the man wasn't
[56:40] going to judge the uh the blueprint by
[56:45] Le's
[56:46] achievement that is very critical he was
[56:50] going to judge Le's achievement by the
[56:54] blueprint so as as far as the man is
[56:57] concerned the wisdom the understanding
[57:00] the idea of lead does not matter right
[57:03] it is what he wanted that he
[57:06] wanted and uh he said please bring my
[57:10] blueprint and as he was looking at the
[57:12] blueprint and Le achievement he said
[57:15] where is this pillar that I put here he
[57:18] said according to the building
[57:19] Convention of
[57:21] albera no pillar is always puted there
[57:24] so I removed it how about my window here
[57:27] according to the new contemporary Design
[57:30] Technology no window gets there I
[57:33] removed it and the Lee told him you say
[57:36] you've built a house but you've not
[57:37] built my house if you care for me to pay
[57:41] and accept this transaction you must
[57:43] tear it down and build it all over again
[57:47] then before Lee had a chance to respond
[57:49] he came out of the dream and he became
[57:52] very frantic and anxious and straight
[57:56] away he ran to brother Braham and he
[57:58] said this is the dream I had what do you
[58:01] think I should do brother Braham said
[58:03] very simple is how you see there's a
[58:05] creek running down
[58:07] there let's just go settle it once and
[58:10] for all all God is telling you by that
[58:13] is that you must do things correctly
[58:17] God's provided
[58:19] [Music]
[58:21] way amen and God's uh God's position
[58:25] Remain the same even till
[58:27] now if you want a blessing if you want
[58:30] God's
[58:31] approval you must come his provided way
[58:35] from the scriptures that we read There
[58:38] are two ways that were presented to
[58:41] us he said one is the path of life
[58:45] that's according to Psalms chapter 16 it
[58:48] said but no man ever discovers this way
[58:51] by his or herself you have got to be
[58:54] shown
[58:56] thou will show me the path of life I
[58:59] want you to underline it amen all right
[59:01] then the other way we read in Proverbs
[59:03] chapter 16 it's a way that you don't
[59:06] need anybody to show
[59:11] you I will prove to you why you don't
[59:13] need anybody to show you very soon but
[59:16] you see it's a way that you are so
[59:19] convinced of how be it your conviction
[59:23] is presumptuous
[59:26] the Bible said it's a way that seeth
[59:28] right to the one who wants to walk in
[59:32] it but by the highest by the Judgment of
[59:36] the one who can see the end from the
[59:39] beginning that way will lead to death
[59:43] but the man who wanted the
[59:45] way does not know how he going to fall
[59:48] how he going to end but it looks
[59:50] attractive for him to
[59:53] embrace so we have before us tonight the
[59:56] path of life and we also have the way of
[59:59] death and choices must be
[1:00:04] made all of us one way or the other will
[1:00:07] walk in one of the ways there's no
[1:00:10] neutral ground and according to the
[1:00:15] scriptures in the book of Isaiah these
[1:00:18] two ways don't
[1:00:20] me can never meet and will never ever
[1:00:24] meet there are two parallel lines he
[1:00:27] said your ways are not my ways your
[1:00:30] thoughts are not my thoughts the
[1:00:32] scripture even offered an impression of
[1:00:34] the distance that they are
[1:00:36] apart as the heaven is so high above the
[1:00:39] Earth so are these ways wide apart so if
[1:00:42] you choose to walk in the two ways at
[1:00:45] the same time your legs aren't long
[1:00:47] enough that's right to be planted to
[1:00:50] plant one here and to plant one there
[1:00:52] amen so that means you've got to choose
[1:00:54] one amen and when you choose one you are
[1:00:57] forsaken the other when you choose the
[1:01:00] other you are forsaken this one one
[1:01:03] leads to death one leads to
[1:01:08] life but I have something to say here if
[1:01:12] the Lord leave you leave you to
[1:01:15] choices do you know you would rather
[1:01:18] choose the one that leads to
[1:01:22] death it is not in man to choose
[1:01:25] correctly
[1:01:30] ah all right now these two ways are in
[1:01:34] you and
[1:01:35] I it is not like albata highway or an
[1:01:39] Highway they are in Earth in horse they
[1:01:43] came into you both by your
[1:01:47] election and by your natural
[1:01:51] birth when an elect is
[1:01:54] born is born with the two ways inside of
[1:01:58] him but the two ways are not active at
[1:02:01] the same
[1:02:02] time the prophet said within the
[1:02:05] construction of your heart where you
[1:02:06] have the
[1:02:08] soul you have a dark
[1:02:11] PCH that envelopes your whole heart if
[1:02:14] you are a seed of God then you have a
[1:02:17] little light like the size of a
[1:02:20] button also in
[1:02:23] there but the first one that takes over
[1:02:27] your life is the one imposed upon you by
[1:02:30] your natural birth which is the
[1:02:33] darkness and that is why the prophet in
[1:02:36] the message thinking side thinking man's
[1:02:38] filter he said you and I we are born
[1:02:42] without a fighting
[1:02:46] chance and because we are born with a
[1:02:49] nature imposed on us by our natural
[1:02:52] birth because our natural birth formula
[1:02:55] was not God's Divine
[1:02:58] prescription are you with me church it
[1:03:01] was Satan's
[1:03:04] idea and that is why till tomorrow God
[1:03:07] will never accept it he permitted it but
[1:03:11] he never accepted it amen I hope I'm not
[1:03:14] confusing you
[1:03:17] amen and that is why when God came in
[1:03:20] flesh he made a demand he said you must
[1:03:24] underline that word you must be born
[1:03:28] again the use of the word again is to
[1:03:31] show to you that he recognizes that you
[1:03:33] have already been
[1:03:34] born but because he rejected that
[1:03:38] birth that is why he placed the
[1:03:41] compulsion on you to be born again amen
[1:03:45] amen are you with me now because that
[1:03:48] natural
[1:03:50] birth was God's way was Satan's way of
[1:03:54] injecting his nature into
[1:03:57] Mankind and that was why the first
[1:04:00] person born by that birth was called
[1:04:04] Cain amen can in the dispensation of
[1:04:08] Innocence without any
[1:04:11] influence that has gone before him
[1:04:14] committed murder so you will ask
[1:04:17] yourself who taught him right because he
[1:04:19] never saw an
[1:04:21] example to know how to
[1:04:23] kill he became angry
[1:04:27] he became envious and he also became a
[1:04:31] liar and he became defiant in lying all
[1:04:35] those things you will find in
[1:04:39] Genesis and also even when he was shown
[1:04:42] the way of right there was nothing in
[1:04:45] him to repent and make his way right
[1:04:48] everything was there in that
[1:04:51] chapter and all these things took place
[1:04:54] in the dispensation of
[1:04:57] Innocence meaning in the dispensation
[1:05:00] when there is not be an influence that
[1:05:03] went in advance to the contrary so that
[1:05:06] he could say I did what this fellow
[1:05:09] did so how then did can't come about it
[1:05:13] it was in
[1:05:15] him that way was in him and that is why
[1:05:19] the prophet said we were the Bible said
[1:05:21] we were shaped in iniquity we came to
[1:05:24] the world speaking
[1:05:26] lies nobody thought us their
[1:05:29] lies it was in nth in
[1:05:34] us and the way seems so
[1:05:39] right but before you can turn to the
[1:05:41] path of Life somebody needs to instruct
[1:05:46] you you see why the Bible said thou will
[1:05:48] show me the path of Life somebody preach
[1:05:53] to you amen somebody maybe give you a
[1:05:56] thr somebody maybe invited you to church
[1:06:00] and you heard the words of life and
[1:06:03] something connected with your heart and
[1:06:06] you begin to Hunger for More the Bible
[1:06:09] said it is the the prophet said it is
[1:06:11] the little button of life that is
[1:06:14] hungering to come to
[1:06:17] life are you following so these two ways
[1:06:20] are in you and high if God leaves you to
[1:06:23] make these choices like you did in the
[1:06:25] beginning you will choose the way of
[1:06:27] death and that was why after the fall of
[1:06:30] Genesis chapter 3 when God has achieved
[1:06:34] his aim by free moral agency he no
[1:06:37] longer wants you to exercise your right
[1:06:40] of Choosing by yourself again
[1:06:43] amen you didn't catch that in the Garden
[1:06:47] of Eden he gave men free moral agency
[1:06:51] meaning the ability to make your choices
[1:06:54] without being interfered with
[1:06:56] is that right so but the prophet in the
[1:07:00] in the message marriage and divorce told
[1:07:02] us that God had a reason to give man
[1:07:05] such a blanket ability you know why
[1:07:08] because this ability is not
[1:07:10] complementary with your
[1:07:12] makeup the Bible called you a
[1:07:15] sheep a sheep cannot lead isil herself
[1:07:19] it's meant to be led but here it's
[1:07:21] somebody giving you the ability to
[1:07:23] direct yourself then then that ability
[1:07:26] must be a
[1:07:28] suspect and God has a suspicious
[1:07:31] activity for it that is why in the
[1:07:34] message marriage and divorce the prophet
[1:07:36] said he gave man that right of choosing
[1:07:39] knowing that by that he will
[1:07:41] fall God needed the fall of mankind it
[1:07:46] is not a
[1:07:47] sacrilege listen to me the prophet you
[1:07:50] say when the world talk about Genesis 3
[1:07:52] it is okay but when Believers talk about
[1:07:55] it you must must talk about it with a
[1:07:56] level of Grace and higher understanding
[1:08:00] because that's the essence of the open
[1:08:02] word that's the essence of the reveal
[1:08:05] word when the prophet was talking about
[1:08:07] Genesis 3 he said and when Satan has
[1:08:10] brought to
[1:08:12] pass that which was necessary to the
[1:08:15] purpose of
[1:08:17] God MH you people are English people you
[1:08:21] don't understand grammar better than I
[1:08:23] do so you can DEC you can analyze that
[1:08:27] he said Satan brought to pass what was
[1:08:30] necessary to the purpose of God so the
[1:08:33] fall was
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:38] necessary
[1:08:40] amen God engineered the fall and you can
[1:08:45] coach me on that because he has a
[1:08:48] purpose by it to
[1:08:50] achieve the prophet said in eternity
[1:08:54] when God was was not even God in the
[1:08:56] sense of being object of worship he had
[1:08:59] a desire to be God but he doesn't just
[1:09:02] want to be God Alone he also want to be
[1:09:05] known Beyond being God and if you want
[1:09:09] to know him Beyond being God he wants
[1:09:11] you to enjoy his attributes he has an
[1:09:14] attribute to heal to redeem to save to
[1:09:19] deliver but you see there's a problem
[1:09:21] here amen healing will not be necessary
[1:09:24] if nobody ever get get sick Deliverance
[1:09:27] is not necessary if nobody's in bondage
[1:09:30] salvation is not necessary if nobody is
[1:09:34] lost amen and Redemption is not
[1:09:36] necessary if nothing is out of place but
[1:09:40] there was perfection in the Garden of
[1:09:42] Eden such that these attributes will
[1:09:45] never be
[1:09:47] necessary so you know what God did God
[1:09:50] upset his own program they say Satan
[1:09:53] upset God's program it's impossible
[1:09:57] POS Hallelujah did you hear me it is God
[1:10:02] giv him you see the devil is not in this
[1:10:05] picture at all and I hope you see that
[1:10:07] in your life also amen Satan can do
[1:10:11] nothing if the Lord does not give him
[1:10:14] permission you see brother said the
[1:10:17] Holiness of God the purity of God cannot
[1:10:21] make him do certain
[1:10:23] things so he created a being to fill
[1:10:26] that void for him he must do it so that
[1:10:30] God can advance his own program amen so
[1:10:33] you can see that Satan will find out at
[1:10:35] the end of this old business that God
[1:10:38] was only using him he will dump him like
[1:10:40] a
[1:10:46] trash so this was the reason he gave the
[1:10:50] man the right of choice he made the
[1:10:52] woman in a manner to bring the the four
[1:10:56] that's what the word taught I'm saying
[1:10:58] woman I'm not talking of you redeemed
[1:11:00] sisters all right but then he created a
[1:11:04] being called The
[1:11:05] Serpent now the reason he created that
[1:11:08] being to be a bridge between human an
[1:11:11] animal was because he has an assignment
[1:11:14] for
[1:11:15] him and in the message serent seed
[1:11:17] brother Braham said God did not just
[1:11:19] created that animal as animal he created
[1:11:22] him with the principles of the under
[1:11:24] with the understanding of the principles
[1:11:27] of life you see an hanimal understood
[1:11:30] the principles of life he knows how to
[1:11:33] bring life in a perverted way so when
[1:11:36] the devil came into the garden he saw a
[1:11:39] willing tool waiting for him that was
[1:11:41] why he never went into lion he came to
[1:11:44] the
[1:11:44] serpent amen and that is what made
[1:11:47] serpent a beast because he caned himself
[1:11:51] in fullness into serpent all right just
[1:11:54] as the full fullness of God came in the
[1:11:56] body called Christ the fullness of the
[1:11:59] devil came into the body called serpent
[1:12:02] there will be one more Beast again
[1:12:03] coming that is when this office of the
[1:12:06] Pope will have Satan fully incarnated in
[1:12:10] him that is what will make him a beast
[1:12:13] right now is a false prophet but when it
[1:12:15] becomes Satan incarnated he will become
[1:12:18] a beast that's what the word said amen
[1:12:21] all right so the devil cannot himself
[1:12:23] inside him in order to inject to
[1:12:26] reproduce himself vicariously that was
[1:12:29] why Cain was full blooded son of Serpent
[1:12:34] and the Bible called him the son of the
[1:12:36] wicked one and that was why he needed no
[1:12:39] toor to teach him everything about
[1:12:43] wickedness all right but this is where
[1:12:45] I'm going when he created serpent that
[1:12:48] way and he created woman that way don't
[1:12:52] forget Adam proceeded from God he was
[1:12:56] like a scoop out of the life of God
[1:12:58] himself amen that is why the first
[1:13:01] appearance of Adam in the garden was a
[1:13:03] spirit form then God made a flesh and
[1:13:06] put a spirit form in there all right so
[1:13:09] that makes Adam a complete Son of God
[1:13:12] because God took a portion out of
[1:13:13] himself in that formula in that shape he
[1:13:16] can never be deceived he can never be
[1:13:19] flooded it can never
[1:13:22] fall but the fall was necessary
[1:13:25] am so you know what God did God gave him
[1:13:29] the right ability to choose without
[1:13:32] Divine interference that is the meaning
[1:13:35] of free moral agency God said I will not
[1:13:37] interfere you choose you know why the
[1:13:40] prophet said God knew that by that by
[1:13:42] that Adam will fall that was where when
[1:13:45] the fall took place and Adam has not
[1:13:48] gotten involved you can see that nothing
[1:13:50] happened on the
[1:13:52] earth it's only the woman the had
[1:13:55] problem but when Adam had to make his
[1:13:59] own
[1:14:00] choice that was the reason God gave him
[1:14:03] knowing that he would rather choose the
[1:14:05] woman than anything else in order to
[1:14:08] also you know for you know be a prophecy
[1:14:11] to other types of the scripture in the
[1:14:12] front that was why God gave him that
[1:14:15] right of choosing so that he could join
[1:14:18] in the fall and the attributes of God
[1:14:21] will become necessary now this is where
[1:14:24] I'm now coming to since God achieved
[1:14:28] that it does not expect you and I to use
[1:14:31] our free moral agency ability by
[1:14:38] ourselves he expects you to hand that
[1:14:41] over to
[1:14:42] him amen that is why when the prophet
[1:14:45] was preaching does God change his mind
[1:14:48] about his word he said I recognize you
[1:14:52] he said you must submit yourself to the
[1:14:55] word and the will of God the word of God
[1:14:59] is the Bible the will of God is the
[1:15:02] message of the hour because the message
[1:15:06] is what declares the will of God in
[1:15:08] every dispensation such that when you
[1:15:11] follow that will of God you are
[1:15:13] automatically fulfilling the entire
[1:15:15] Bible
[1:15:17] ah Hallelujah he said we must submit
[1:15:20] ourself to it and he said I recognize
[1:15:23] you can say that but God said said he
[1:15:25] will give me the desire of my heart then
[1:15:28] he came back and he said and you let
[1:15:30] your desire be the word of
[1:15:32] God never your own will so the choice of
[1:15:37] a believer in any situation is what God
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:44] says this is the only way to walk in the
[1:15:47] will of
[1:15:49] God are you following me all right let
[1:15:53] me make it easy for you
[1:15:56] there are three
[1:15:58] exoduses in the Bible or at least that
[1:16:01] the prophet pointed our attention to
[1:16:04] from the scriptures he said the first
[1:16:06] one was when God was taking a nation out
[1:16:11] of the Nations Pastor do you mind me
[1:16:13] removing my
[1:16:17] jacket you must have poet
[1:16:21] maners all right thank
[1:16:23] you it said the first one was when it
[1:16:26] was taking a nation out of a nation that
[1:16:29] was Israel coming out of Egypt the
[1:16:33] second one was when it was taken a
[1:16:36] church out of religion and that was why
[1:16:40] when Christ came and never identifi with
[1:16:42] any religion denomination you have it
[1:16:46] then as you have it now what you call
[1:16:49] Pharisees sades send scribes theod and
[1:16:52] so forth they were all denominated
[1:16:55] SE of their day but you see when our
[1:16:57] Lord came he never identify with any but
[1:17:00] he called the church out of them all
[1:17:03] right and this last one he is calling
[1:17:06] the bride out of the
[1:17:09] church amen but you see the first Exodus
[1:17:13] is the plan in
[1:17:15] Exodus this last one is the Harvest of
[1:17:18] all
[1:17:19] Exodus and the last day is always
[1:17:22] vindicating the first day so such that
[1:17:25] when if you are not in the F you can
[1:17:28] have an idea of what to place in the F
[1:17:30] when you see what is going on now are
[1:17:33] you following me because the first is
[1:17:35] the planting
[1:17:37] season and if you plant a seed in the uh
[1:17:41] planting time you don't rip one seed in
[1:17:44] the Harvest amen they told us that if
[1:17:47] you plant corn or maze if you are
[1:17:49] familiar with that just one seed can
[1:17:52] give you two cups and on each cup you
[1:17:54] you can have about 612 seats so meaning
[1:17:58] that a seat can give you
[1:18:00] 1,224 seats in your harvest season you
[1:18:05] get much more than you plant at the time
[1:18:08] of harvest so whatever you saw you are
[1:18:11] seen in the first Exodus expect much
[1:18:15] more now so nothing is actually out of
[1:18:18] cater the clock is scking right the
[1:18:21] program is going as it should and the
[1:18:24] Bible remains perfect Hallelujah so if
[1:18:26] you have one Kora one Dayan one abam in
[1:18:30] the first Exodus you will have several
[1:18:33] hundreds of them in this last Exodus
[1:18:37] nothing has changed amen Kora is the
[1:18:40] make believing group who would follow
[1:18:42] the message who would even Escape some
[1:18:44] things they escape the death of the
[1:18:47] first born they escape the Red Sea they
[1:18:49] drank water from the rock they enjoyed
[1:18:52] manner but they were not designed to go
[1:18:54] true so at some point they must have
[1:18:57] problem with the message of that hour
[1:19:00] and they must attack the message of the
[1:19:02] hour and then they must be swallowed and
[1:19:06] consumed ahuh all right so those things
[1:19:10] you will say it in the last days so I
[1:19:13] want to point something out from the
[1:19:15] first Exodus to give you an
[1:19:18] understanding of this
[1:19:21] way when God was ready to take Israel
[1:19:24] out in the first
[1:19:26] Exodus I want the church to know that
[1:19:29] there are many ways that led out of
[1:19:32] Egypt and will take them to Canaan
[1:19:34] that's
[1:19:36] right yeah it's in your
[1:19:38] Bible I'm not preaching a
[1:19:41] saege even the Bible spoke of a
[1:19:43] particular Highway he call it the way of
[1:19:46] the Philistines and the Bible even said
[1:19:48] is a shorter
[1:19:50] route from Egypt to Canaan is in your
[1:19:54] Bible yes sir he said but God did not
[1:19:57] want them to be intimidated with Wars as
[1:20:00] if they never had Wars along their
[1:20:02] Journey amen so he didn't choose that
[1:20:05] way Moses had gone out of Egypt before
[1:20:09] and he went to the lands of
[1:20:11] Jetro the midianites it didn't have to
[1:20:15] cross through the Red Sea and I want to
[1:20:17] tell you even till today listen to me
[1:20:20] church you can travel from Israel to
[1:20:24] Egypt eypt I have done that before and
[1:20:27] you travel on the borderlines of the Red
[1:20:30] Sea and do not have to cross the Red Sea
[1:20:33] and yet you will get to
[1:20:35] Egypt till
[1:20:37] today
[1:20:39] uhuh but when God was ready to lead this
[1:20:43] people the first thing he
[1:20:48] did was to appoint a
[1:20:51] leader listen to me CH in ex Exodus chap
[1:20:55] 23 he said behold you see this Pillar of
[1:20:59] Fire had been walking with Moses All
[1:21:01] Along that's right you know he met him
[1:21:04] in the burning bush he commissioned him
[1:21:07] and he never left him everything Moses
[1:21:09] ever did he was gued by the pillar of
[1:21:12] fire but the Exodus people didn't know
[1:21:15] that fact so when the journey was ready
[1:21:18] to start God gave the Exodus people the
[1:21:23] Consciousness am
[1:21:25] that there is a
[1:21:27] leader for this
[1:21:29] journey I hope you are still having that
[1:21:33] Consciousness that the message of the
[1:21:36] hour is not the idea of a
[1:21:39] kentan it came from the Throne of
[1:21:43] God Apostle Paul said that which I
[1:21:46] receive from the Lord the same might
[1:21:48] deliver to the church and Paul was so
[1:21:52] bold of his receiving until he said if
[1:21:55] it is we or an
[1:21:57] angel that will speak contrary to these
[1:22:00] things that I have given unto you let
[1:22:04] him be a
[1:22:06] cur those were profound statements the
[1:22:10] Gentiles must know how to follow the
[1:22:12] prophet amen if you want to follow the
[1:22:16] revealed World brother Braham say you
[1:22:18] got no touch coming Hallelujah God
[1:22:20] doesn't need your idea he doesn't need
[1:22:22] your theory it doesn't need your
[1:22:25] suggestion it's a full C menuall that
[1:22:29] does not need a
[1:22:31] recooking there were seven dreams that
[1:22:34] became Vision because they were
[1:22:37] interpreted before the seals were opened
[1:22:41] sister Willard cins was among those who
[1:22:43] gave the dreams in her own dream he saw
[1:22:46] brother Brown serving a
[1:22:48] food amen and it looked awkward for the
[1:22:51] pastor to be serving when the sisters
[1:22:54] were
[1:22:55] there you get what I'm saying but that
[1:22:58] kind of food cannot be served by any
[1:23:00] other person than William Bram himself
[1:23:04] amen and sister will Collins said when
[1:23:07] everybody ate that food the testimony is
[1:23:11] that this is the sweetest the best food
[1:23:14] we have ever eaten if something is
[1:23:17] already in sweetest and the best it
[1:23:19] doesn't need a
[1:23:22] reconstitution uh-huh ites doesn't need
[1:23:25] a recooking you don't need to hard orate
[1:23:28] from the ingredient it means all you
[1:23:31] need to do is to warm it and save
[1:23:36] it we must never lose that Consciousness
[1:23:40] am you see the way you follow the
[1:23:42] message is the way the prophet himself
[1:23:44] followed the message do you realize that
[1:23:47] the message Revelation came to the
[1:23:50] prophet
[1:23:51] progressively and it said when this
[1:23:53] truth came out out they came out better
[1:23:55] than my personal understanding so he
[1:23:58] himself had to drop his own
[1:24:00] understanding in order to follow the
[1:24:03] light if you are not ready for that you
[1:24:05] become a broken sister and the broken
[1:24:08] sister is a water that does not flow a
[1:24:11] broken system can only retain Purity for
[1:24:14] a little while after while because there
[1:24:16] is no flowing effect it's going to
[1:24:19] become stagnated and undesirable things
[1:24:22] will start developing but if there's a
[1:24:24] good life in there it will
[1:24:27] die hallu so God told that church behold
[1:24:33] I send my angel before
[1:24:36] you that angel was not Moses H that
[1:24:40] angel was the pillar of
[1:24:44] fire Exodus
[1:24:46] 23 now from the instruction he gave him
[1:24:49] there he said Beware of
[1:24:52] him amen don't Chen him don't query him
[1:24:57] don't suggest to him he knows what he's
[1:25:00] doing he can carry you through if you
[1:25:03] are too sophisticated for him you better
[1:25:05] fall
[1:25:08] out because it's dangerous to be a rebel
[1:25:13] behind the pillar of
[1:25:18] fire now but there's a challenge here
[1:25:21] friends this Angel this Captain this
[1:25:25] leader is not
[1:25:27] visible amen so you are going to follow
[1:25:30] an invisible
[1:25:32] leader how would you know his
[1:25:35] direction are you catching
[1:25:37] it till till today even when brother
[1:25:40] brah was here pillow of fire was
[1:25:42] invisible until God in his Mercy in
[1:25:45] order to shut and humiliate the critic
[1:25:48] allow the picture to be
[1:25:50] taken all you will hear the prophet said
[1:25:53] is that for somebody came to the prayer
[1:25:55] line he said do you feel so sweet do you
[1:25:58] have such an unusual sweet feeling and
[1:26:00] the person will say yes it said is the
[1:26:02] effect of that angel he not 2 feet he
[1:26:05] not more than 2T away from you that's
[1:26:07] why you are feeling that way if that
[1:26:10] looks like an un story to the people
[1:26:13] amen that was why God one
[1:26:17] day by the uncute UN gentlemanly
[1:26:20] behavior of Reverend best God gave us
[1:26:23] the picture
[1:26:25] so that the people will realize that
[1:26:26] brother Braham wasn't making up
[1:26:28] stories it was a
[1:26:31] reality are you here Brethren so this
[1:26:34] angel will go before you he said Beware
[1:26:37] of
[1:26:39] him but the men to be careful of they
[1:26:42] don't know nobody could see him this is
[1:26:46] where Moses came into the
[1:26:50] picture Moses was so
[1:26:52] humanized the leadership of the pillar
[1:26:55] of
[1:26:57] fire amen if that was what took place in
[1:27:00] the first Exodus I'm happy to tell you
[1:27:03] it took place in the Third
[1:27:04] Exodus the prophet in the message Mighty
[1:27:08] God unveiled before us he said for 33
[1:27:11] years I veiled the pillar of fire
[1:27:15] interpreting the word to you don't have
[1:27:18] problem with me there's a quotation I'm
[1:27:20] reading so if you have problem with that
[1:27:23] have problem with the quotation
[1:27:25] he said I veiled the pillar of fire
[1:27:28] interpreting the words to you because
[1:27:31] you cannot stand the effect of the
[1:27:34] pillar of fire even brother brah said I
[1:27:37] never get used to its
[1:27:41] presence and since man in the beginning
[1:27:43] and said God don't talk to us directly
[1:27:46] let Moses talk to us and we shall Leen
[1:27:50] so God is still using the principle amen
[1:27:53] he got a MOS for the toughest Exodus he
[1:27:56] got a William Brown for the third
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:01] one so it's not William Brown's fault to
[1:28:03] tell you if you stay by these things to
[1:28:06] charge you to stay by it because he
[1:28:09] wasn't giving us the word of himself he
[1:28:11] said I was not the one that appeared at
[1:28:14] Ohio
[1:28:15] River I wasn't the pillar of fire but I
[1:28:18] was the person
[1:28:20] nearest somebody must be closer than any
[1:28:25] of us to the pillar of fire somebody
[1:28:29] must understand his words when God
[1:28:32] speaks he Thunders bow bow bow you can't
[1:28:35] make it out there must be somebody to
[1:28:38] decode the noise and the sound and give
[1:28:41] us what it
[1:28:43] says in 1964 it thundered three times
[1:28:47] all the bread and fr Suman and the rest
[1:28:49] of them had Thunder and they went to ask
[1:28:53] brother br dog and the rest of them they
[1:28:56] said what did he say he said I need to
[1:28:58] ask him if he wants me to tell you and
[1:29:02] God told him go tell them and he said it
[1:29:04] is Judgment striking the west coast and
[1:29:07] the next day Alaska almost sank beneath
[1:29:10] the ocean amen so you can't decode his
[1:29:14] language you can't see him and yet he's
[1:29:17] our captain for the
[1:29:19] journey so this is a reason he gave
[1:29:23] Moses this is is the reason he gave Paul
[1:29:26] this is the reason he gave William
[1:29:27] Braham Hallelujah so you must know why
[1:29:30] and who these people are to
[1:29:32] us so whatever the pillar of fire says
[1:29:36] Moses was to tell the people
[1:29:39] unadulterated so he not going to inject
[1:29:41] his thought or his ideas and that is the
[1:29:44] way they are to be guided into the
[1:29:46] promised land and the Bible said and the
[1:29:50] Lord LED
[1:29:52] them by way of the Red
[1:29:57] Sea doesn't that strike something to you
[1:30:00] of all the ways that are available it is
[1:30:03] the Red Sea it lets them
[1:30:07] by so when we get to the Red Sea what
[1:30:11] then so it is safe to say that this
[1:30:14] captain that we must not query or
[1:30:17] challenge but must follow him led us to
[1:30:21] a dead
[1:30:22] end you you see it's so easy to relax
[1:30:26] because you knew what happened you are
[1:30:28] reading in retrospect but picture it in
[1:30:31] yourself if you were there that
[1:30:34] day
[1:30:36] amen you that's the way to appreciate it
[1:30:40] he was leading
[1:30:41] them if it were Moses of old Moses would
[1:30:45] have been the first person to challenge
[1:30:47] it but the burning bush has made a
[1:30:51] difference because Moses before the
[1:30:53] burning Bush was so excited about
[1:30:55] serving the lord but he doesn't always
[1:30:58] care for God's
[1:30:59] timing if ISS that God was too slow or
[1:31:03] God was too callous and he took the
[1:31:05] matter up by himself and all his labor
[1:31:09] achieved one
[1:31:11] Egyptian when you take it upon yourself
[1:31:13] you will achieve only one Egyptian and
[1:31:16] you guess what you won't even be able to
[1:31:18] wait to defend your Victory you will run
[1:31:21] away when Moses ran away for 40 years
[1:31:24] who was taking care of the people he was
[1:31:26] so concerned much more than God about
[1:31:30] am you can't be ahead of
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:34] God you can't be ahead of God just calm
[1:31:39] down with God nothing will ever get out
[1:31:42] of K Hall Glory H only
[1:31:46] believe all things are possible brother
[1:31:49] brah it is only said it is only
[1:31:51] impatience that we shall possess life
[1:31:57] so he was leading them he was leading
[1:32:00] them and they got to the
[1:32:03] rting there are two things you must
[1:32:07] understand if you choose to walk in your
[1:32:09] own way you must be ready to take care
[1:32:12] of your
[1:32:16] life you must be ready to offer yourself
[1:32:19] personal
[1:32:20] Security provide for your needs fight
[1:32:23] your
[1:32:24] B and do everything if you can handle it
[1:32:28] go your
[1:32:30] way but if you cannot you must go his
[1:32:33] provided way because it is only on in
[1:32:37] God's Own Way that God will be
[1:32:41] obligated to take you and your condition
[1:32:44] as his
[1:32:47] responsibility that is my encouragement
[1:32:49] to you tonight no matter how seemingly
[1:32:54] yeah the path you want to pursue is
[1:32:56] right don't ever take a step without
[1:33:00] consulting
[1:33:02] God the ways of God many times can look
[1:33:05] so hard but friends God has a purpose
[1:33:10] for
[1:33:12] everything and that is the only way you
[1:33:14] can ever come out right
[1:33:17] Hallelujah God's way God's mind God's
[1:33:22] original formula doesn't expire in God's
[1:33:25] economy
[1:33:27] Hallelujah are you with me the prophet
[1:33:29] said God has never had a new thought
[1:33:33] about
[1:33:34] anything it's original thought before it
[1:33:38] starts doing anything on the earth
[1:33:41] remains his only thought
[1:33:44] hallah so civilization and
[1:33:47] modernity will never sweep us away from
[1:33:51] God's Divine
[1:33:52] instruction the important thing I'm
[1:33:54] passing across to you tonight is that
[1:33:56] God has his own way for anything to be
[1:34:00] done
[1:34:01] am amen and this is why it took time
[1:34:06] hallelujah amen is it possible to put a
[1:34:09] scripture on the
[1:34:11] board I think Deuteronomy 30:1 19 can
[1:34:14] you please put it on the board for
[1:34:19] me please if they can put it on the
[1:34:21] board Deuteronomy 30: 19
[1:34:24] all right now let's watch something here
[1:34:27] he said I call Heaven and Earth to
[1:34:29] record to record this day against you
[1:34:33] that I have set before you life and
[1:34:36] death blessing and cursing
[1:34:39] stop leave it leave
[1:34:42] it that line before this Ione represent
[1:34:46] free moral
[1:34:48] agency God set it if it does not
[1:34:52] interfere with your choice
[1:34:54] he has given you your right of way to
[1:34:57] choose but do you know what God knew and
[1:35:00] still knows that you can never choose
[1:35:02] correctly you will choose curse you will
[1:35:05] choose death this is why he came to
[1:35:08] whisper with another life therefore
[1:35:11] choose
[1:35:14] life that both thou and thy seed may
[1:35:17] live when he began to guide and instruct
[1:35:20] you on what to do that is no more free
[1:35:24] agency that is God
[1:35:30] interfering you know why because
[1:35:34] relative to God he has his own way that
[1:35:38] he wants everything to be done amen if
[1:35:40] you want to get married he has his own
[1:35:43] way amen if you want to have a church he
[1:35:45] has his own way am you want to raise a
[1:35:47] family he has his own way even into your
[1:35:51] hner court your bedroom he has his own
[1:35:53] way way everything about our life the
[1:35:57] reason God spoke about it is because he
[1:35:59] wants to be personally
[1:36:01] obligated for your life he wants you to
[1:36:05] come to a point you can say Lord I
[1:36:07] followed your way then take care of the
[1:36:11] business are you with me wouldn't that
[1:36:13] be an easy way to push it to
[1:36:17] him
[1:36:20] amen so when they were following him
[1:36:24] they got to the Red
[1:36:26] Sea and it became a dead
[1:36:30] end K dayon and her must have had a long
[1:36:33] a field day so Moses are you sure you
[1:36:36] are seeing
[1:36:37] somebody if you really saw God say will
[1:36:40] God lead a man to dead end what's going
[1:36:42] on here nothing is going on that's the
[1:36:47] path that God chose we sing it in only
[1:36:50] believe he say your Shepherd selected
[1:36:53] the path that you must thread the path
[1:36:56] that is Select for you sometimes does
[1:36:59] not necessarily mean
[1:37:01] pleasantries it could come with
[1:37:03] challenges but guess what your anchor
[1:37:06] will be this Lord you led me
[1:37:14] here are you with me Bren I didn't come
[1:37:18] here by myself I was following your
[1:37:21] leadership you told me to do this am
[1:37:23] then you see your
[1:37:26] it so friends while they were
[1:37:32] there before you know it they saw a lot
[1:37:35] of dust
[1:37:36] Rising Hey by the time the dust set with
[1:37:39] them it was the Pharaoh and Egyptian
[1:37:42] Army so the Pharaoh's Army
[1:37:46] behind Red Sea in front on this side
[1:37:50] there were valleys and on this side
[1:37:52] there were Hills
[1:37:54] so none of these sides is an
[1:37:59] option we can safely say they came to a
[1:38:02] dead end or a close
[1:38:04] up but don't forget how they got there
[1:38:08] they got there following God's
[1:38:11] leadership Hallelujah God's part led to
[1:38:14] a close up God's part led to a dead end
[1:38:18] it LEDs to a situation that as a
[1:38:21] Believer you don't know what to do you
[1:38:25] say can God do that he still does
[1:38:28] that that is why he sent me to preach it
[1:38:30] to you are you in the dead end tonight
[1:38:34] are you in a suffocating
[1:38:36] experience youve seem to turn here you
[1:38:39] turn you turn there seem to be no way
[1:38:42] hey you have your replica in the word
[1:38:46] hallelujah Apostle Paul said the life of
[1:38:49] Abraham was an allegory or an allegory
[1:38:52] meaning a life been lived that is a
[1:38:54] forel of the life in the future amen so
[1:38:57] this dead end situation might be the
[1:38:59] forel of somebody tonight
[1:39:01] amen who seemingly is in a closeup you
[1:39:04] don't know where to turn amen stand
[1:39:08] still come
[1:39:10] now if your
[1:39:13] prophecy you know in the message
[1:39:16] identification the prophet said the
[1:39:18] challenge we do have sometimes about
[1:39:21] having faith is that we don't look into
[1:39:23] to the scripture well enough to see our
[1:39:27] character to see our experience to see
[1:39:30] our situation he said watch when that
[1:39:33] woman that we can call aunti Juma you
[1:39:36] understand we don't know her real name
[1:39:38] but the prophet say she's old enough to
[1:39:40] be called an auntie he said let us call
[1:39:42] her aunti Jima he said what gave her a
[1:39:46] miracle she was praying and at the point
[1:39:50] she started looking at the scripture to
[1:39:52] see if this my scenario had ever played
[1:39:56] out before knowing King Solomon said
[1:39:58] there is nothing new Under the Sun
[1:40:01] whatever is happening now has happened
[1:40:03] before and if there's a tomorrow it will
[1:40:05] recall again are you following and by
[1:40:09] the inspiration leadership grace of God
[1:40:12] she saw the shite woman said yes she too
[1:40:15] was Barren God gave her a baby I was
[1:40:17] Barren God give me a baby and This
[1:40:19] shamad Woman's son was some stroke or
[1:40:22] something and he died and my own son is
[1:40:25] social disease stroke and he's going to
[1:40:27] die anyway he said but then but then the
[1:40:31] sh woman got her son B then they said
[1:40:35] but wait a minute for this picture to be
[1:40:38] perfect there must be an
[1:40:40] [Applause]
[1:40:43] Elijah and tell you what this woman
[1:40:47] wasn't a message believer hallelujah
[1:40:50] look at her read your message see just
[1:40:53] unlock the principle of the scripture
[1:40:57] she said there must be an Elijah for
[1:40:59] this picture to be perfect so that the
[1:41:02] outcome could be certain then she just
[1:41:05] scamed on her seat without even prayer
[1:41:09] Lord where is your
[1:41:12] Elijah and the Lord who knew where
[1:41:14] Elijah
[1:41:17] was it's too late it's too late to tell
[1:41:20] me brother BR isn't the Elijah of this
[1:41:22] hour
[1:41:24] even the testimony of somebody who never
[1:41:26] saw the message said he was
[1:41:29] Elijah he said Lord where is your Elijah
[1:41:33] and the one who knew where Elijah Was
[1:41:34] Elijah was in a
[1:41:36] plane flying to somewhere in that plane
[1:41:40] a lot of important dignitaries might
[1:41:41] have been there some of them have been
[1:41:43] going for very important meetings that
[1:41:46] they cannot afford to miss some time of
[1:41:49] punctuality or anything but as far as
[1:41:52] God was concerned
[1:41:53] their matter did not
[1:41:56] matter are you with me Church their
[1:41:59] matter did not matter because
[1:42:03] somebody identify the in the scripture
[1:42:08] if you start identifying your character
[1:42:11] your situation in the scripture is going
[1:42:14] to elevate your faith to a level that
[1:42:17] you will just block it and it will
[1:42:20] happen and God unpluged the knot
[1:42:23] and the plane did p p p p alarm alarm
[1:42:26] alarm and the pilot said we have to do a
[1:42:29] falce landing and guess where the for
[1:42:31] landed right in Tennessee the city of
[1:42:34] that sister that wasn't a coincidence
[1:42:37] that was The Guiding of God even brother
[1:42:40] Brown didn't know why the plane landed
[1:42:43] he thought that since they have 4 hours
[1:42:45] to fix the plane he could go and post
[1:42:48] some letters and God said I didn't bring
[1:42:50] you here to do letter post keep moving
[1:42:55] the spirit told
[1:42:56] brother and he had to keep moving and
[1:42:59] the Lord went to tell that lady before
[1:43:01] day break Elijah you ask why he's coming
[1:43:04] and guess what he showed her the picture
[1:43:06] of Elijah to the dressing to the pouch
[1:43:09] he was going to carry so that the
[1:43:11] identity will not be mistaken and this
[1:43:14] woman was so convinced she went to stand
[1:43:16] outside our gate waiting for Elijah and
[1:43:20] here came Elijah walking back
[1:43:23] not knowing where he was going and
[1:43:26] Auntie Jama said good morning
[1:43:29] person said good morning huny he said
[1:43:32] you are supposed to be coming
[1:43:35] here
[1:43:39] hallelujah so you go read the rest of
[1:43:42] the story so I can save your time you
[1:43:45] knew that that woman got her son back
[1:43:47] anyway God bless you so what I'm saying
[1:43:51] is that all the situations that happen
[1:43:53] in the scripture they are forel of our
[1:43:56] whole life we to whom the end of the
[1:43:59] world has come we the completion of the
[1:44:02] entire story Paul said they without
[1:44:05] horse he was actually refering to
[1:44:09] horse we are the horse he was referring
[1:44:12] to all of them without horse is not
[1:44:16] complete in that
[1:44:18] number so whatever your situation is you
[1:44:22] might be in a close
[1:44:23] you might be in a suffocating experience
[1:44:26] life breath might be going out of you
[1:44:29] don't give up
[1:44:32] yet this is why God sent me to bring
[1:44:34] this message to give you hope that as it
[1:44:38] was then so shall it be now help will
[1:44:41] certainly come for you all you need to
[1:44:45] check is how did I get here if you got
[1:44:48] here by the leading of God stand still
[1:44:52] and you will see the salvation of the
[1:44:53] [Applause]
[1:44:56] Lord many times when we find ourself in
[1:44:59] closeups like this Satan plays on our
[1:45:02] mind even the people judge us
[1:45:05] incorrectly amen see he must have done
[1:45:08] something
[1:45:10] wrong and Satan will also be walking out
[1:45:13] at your heart pounding check yourself
[1:45:17] you see maybe it's this maybe it's that
[1:45:20] don't accept that lie
[1:45:23] it is not every closeup conditions that
[1:45:26] are occasioned by our actions Amen in
[1:45:29] the
[1:45:30] contrary they J they judged job
[1:45:33] incorrectly and for about 38 chapters of
[1:45:36] the Bible the friends we are preaching
[1:45:39] their ignorance because when the
[1:45:42] foundation of your gospel is wrong all
[1:45:44] the structure you built will be HS
[1:45:47] out and that was where when God came
[1:45:50] down after about 38 chapters of pounding
[1:45:53] when God came down he told those friends
[1:45:55] he said you have not represented me well
[1:45:58] amen your sermon was malicious you were
[1:46:01] preaching from the angle that job was a
[1:46:03] secret sinner tell you what that guy did
[1:46:06] not commit no
[1:46:09] sin Hallelujah his problem happened
[1:46:13] right from the
[1:46:14] church amen swallow it
[1:46:17] Brothers you say you say I came to
[1:46:20] church for solution and it was from
[1:46:23] Church Jo pked his problem amen amen you
[1:46:27] don't know that he got his problem from
[1:46:30] the
[1:46:31] church the Bible said when the sons of
[1:46:33] God presented them themselves what do
[1:46:35] you think that was Fellowship
[1:46:38] service God only counts male
[1:46:41] numbers there might have been sisters in
[1:46:43] the church that day oh yes and children
[1:46:46] if you see God's population counting it
[1:46:48] will say 10,000 men besides women and
[1:46:52] children that's
[1:46:54] right so it's possible in that service
[1:46:56] there were sisters there were children
[1:46:57] and everything amen and Satan also came
[1:47:01] to service is here tonight how can the
[1:47:05] devil be in the G of God's people you
[1:47:08] said Rise Up from little petty
[1:47:11] theologist the devil is
[1:47:13] here but you see you can put him in a in
[1:47:17] a state of
[1:47:18] inaction by your own attitude by the
[1:47:22] atmosphere you
[1:47:25] create it was in the church God saw the
[1:47:29] devil he was looking at his own people
[1:47:31] then he started quick he saw that he
[1:47:33] said where are you coming from where did
[1:47:36] the conversation take place it took
[1:47:37] place in the church that's why when you
[1:47:40] are sleeping and dozing away you must
[1:47:42] know that that's not the angel
[1:47:43] inspiration of the Lord somebody is
[1:47:46] responsible for that when you are in
[1:47:49] service you have your mind is somewhere
[1:47:51] else uhhuh somebody's remoting you but
[1:47:55] you can put him in a state of inaction
[1:47:58] Hallelujah in a chain of circumstance
[1:48:01] beginning from here by the right
[1:48:03] atmosphere but the right attitude what
[1:48:06] he will be
[1:48:07] here because it was in the church God
[1:48:10] and Satan had Conversation Over job so
[1:48:14] the problem of job started from the
[1:48:16] church
[1:48:18] MH is it so okay okay don't be scared
[1:48:23] because in the church that day God said
[1:48:25] have you considered my servant Jo I
[1:48:27] don't know who is going to tell who is
[1:48:30] who God is going to single have you
[1:48:32] consider my daughter or my
[1:48:34] son but you see when God chest out for
[1:48:37] you like that he is betting with his own
[1:48:41] life you know what he knows what he has
[1:48:44] placed in
[1:48:45] there amen your flesh May Fail but God
[1:48:50] in you can never will never
[1:48:53] [Applause]
[1:49:00] but the friends misunderstood it so
[1:49:03] people can misunderstand your condition
[1:49:05] but see you must have an anchor that is
[1:49:08] why you must know how you arrived at
[1:49:10] where you
[1:49:11] are if you arrive there following the
[1:49:14] leading of the Lord you ain't got
[1:49:16] nothing to fear stand still you will see
[1:49:20] the salvation of God even if if the
[1:49:23] situation presented itself GL Hallelujah
[1:49:26] like that of Lazarus sisters that it
[1:49:30] looks so obvious that it makes God
[1:49:35] indefensible do you know Mar and Mary
[1:49:37] God put them on the spot where they
[1:49:40] couldn't defend God because the facts
[1:49:43] the the exhibits the devil was
[1:49:45] presenting were clear and they look
[1:49:48] through how can a pastor forsook a
[1:49:51] church member in the hour of his need
[1:49:54] you will feel forsaken sometimes it will
[1:49:57] look as if sometimes God will turn away
[1:49:59] the attention of the brothers and the
[1:50:01] sisters they won't even ask of you and
[1:50:04] you have you are going through a
[1:50:06] terrible time and Pastor is not even
[1:50:08] checking on you raising a prayer request
[1:50:10] on you sometimes God allow those things
[1:50:15] Amen to prove
[1:50:18] you are you listening to
[1:50:20] me it might be God
[1:50:23] on The Proven block Lazarus was sick
[1:50:26] they called Pastor
[1:50:28] Jesus he was still just in Vancouver
[1:50:31] here one and a half hour
[1:50:33] slight before you know it the condition
[1:50:37] was getting was he in Toronto he got out
[1:50:40] of Toronto is in New York from New York
[1:50:43] is in the
[1:50:45] Caribbean he was so far away until when
[1:50:48] Lazarus
[1:50:50] died for him to travel down will take
[1:50:54] him for days journey coming back when
[1:50:57] barrier must have taken place and
[1:50:59] Corruption must have
[1:51:00] started so you could say Pastor Jesus
[1:51:03] was not there for that family and that
[1:51:06] family was important to him they housed
[1:51:09] him they clothed him they fed
[1:51:13] him all they could do for a Ministry
[1:51:15] they did for
[1:51:16] him but it didn't show any sign of
[1:51:21] reciprocation to even
[1:51:23] come for that man in the hour of his
[1:51:25] need he wasn't there for them but I tell
[1:51:28] you friends he came for this late and it
[1:51:29] wasn't
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:34] late for you to know Jesus did it
[1:51:38] deliberately when they say he was there
[1:51:40] he said I am glad for your sakes I was
[1:51:42] not
[1:51:44] there because if when he was sick he was
[1:51:47] there and he healed him they would say
[1:51:50] he wasn't actually sick he pretended so
[1:51:53] that they can show up the reputation of
[1:51:56] Christ they can help you know repair His
[1:51:59] Image if he got there the day he died
[1:52:02] they would say he fainted he didn't
[1:52:04] actually
[1:52:05] die so he made sure he died they buried
[1:52:09] him they attended to him when he was
[1:52:11] sick the death certificate of Lazarus
[1:52:14] was in their
[1:52:17] custody and they had the photographs of
[1:52:19] the barrier so the case was clear
[1:52:23] yes even when he came he met an hostile
[1:52:27] audience but look at Mary and
[1:52:32] Mar all the
[1:52:34] tensions all the manipulations they were
[1:52:37] trying to place on them due to them
[1:52:40] never walked because they had an anle
[1:52:43] they had a Capstone Revelation that we
[1:52:46] might not be able to defend or explain
[1:52:48] the action of our pastor but as far as
[1:52:51] this Lord Jesus is concerned it can
[1:52:54] never be wrong you must come to that in
[1:52:57] your life that Christ can never be wrong
[1:53:01] that whatever he does is
[1:53:05] Right beyond all Revelation have that as
[1:53:08] a cstone revelation because there have
[1:53:10] been many things that will happen in
[1:53:11] your life that you can't explain and you
[1:53:14] can't defend
[1:53:15] Christ amen thank you Lord so if you in
[1:53:19] a suffocating experience tonight there
[1:53:22] is your
[1:53:23] picture but this is it as I wind down
[1:53:27] you know what happened because they
[1:53:29] followed God's provided way God took
[1:53:33] personal
[1:53:35] responsibility for their
[1:53:37] safety the Bible said the pillar of fire
[1:53:40] removed from the front so Moses take
[1:53:43] charge of the front and he came to stand
[1:53:46] between them and the evading hery in the
[1:53:50] message Redemption a Redemption uh in a
[1:53:54] Redemption by
[1:53:56] power the prophet said what was God
[1:54:00] doing he said this Exodus people had
[1:54:04] tasted Redemption by Blood which is the
[1:54:07] blood of the Passover for their soul
[1:54:10] salvation he said God wanted them to
[1:54:12] taste it also by power because if he can
[1:54:16] save your soul it can heal your body it
[1:54:20] can change your situation calv has it
[1:54:22] all complete those were the things God
[1:54:25] wanted to
[1:54:28] demonstrate so it stood
[1:54:30] there and it became their go between
[1:54:34] tonight is your go between it stands
[1:54:37] between you and every Death Angel there
[1:54:40] is no circumstance there's no challenge
[1:54:43] there's no problem the Lord allowed to
[1:54:45] come on your way that is designed to
[1:54:47] consume you they are only there to prove
[1:54:50] you to prove your sunship and your
[1:54:54] daughter of God they can never change
[1:54:56] you from a Believer to unbeliever they
[1:54:59] can never consume you but it has come so
[1:55:02] that you can have a greater
[1:55:04] testimony God is taking you to Higher
[1:55:06] Ground and you need character to manage
[1:55:09] achievements amen
[1:55:11] amen amen amen so it's your go between
[1:55:15] tonight am and brother Braham said you
[1:55:17] know what the devil was trying to do he
[1:55:19] was trying to cut short the life of the
[1:55:22] Exodus people prematurely he said but
[1:55:25] there can never be a premature death for
[1:55:29] God's believing children he said now you
[1:55:32] may run into it but God doesn't offer
[1:55:35] you
[1:55:36] that so it's to there and he said Moses
[1:55:40] stand there Moses when he saw these
[1:55:43] people under inspiration he said these
[1:55:45] Egyptians you saw today after today you
[1:55:47] see it
[1:55:48] noal but that wasn't Moses speaking that
[1:55:52] was what Moses yielded himself to
[1:55:55] because when Moses came back to himself
[1:55:57] he was crying the man Moses was crying
[1:56:01] but the one who was in Moses
[1:56:05] spoke you seeing the difference all
[1:56:08] right now they didn't go any other route
[1:56:11] than the path the angel LED this is why
[1:56:14] God will take personal responsibility
[1:56:17] how many ones got to be personally
[1:56:19] responsible for them aha we must go
[1:56:22] provided with a this is what I'm saying
[1:56:24] tonight so it's still there and while he
[1:56:27] still there you know what God was
[1:56:30] doing he was doing a
[1:56:33] calculation I ask this all the time how
[1:56:35] many understands physics very well how
[1:56:37] many people are good in physics
[1:56:39] here God bless you my brother is good in
[1:56:42] physics amen he's a good physic who else
[1:56:45] is good in physics I'm sure one of you
[1:56:47] here will be good in physics just raise
[1:56:49] your hand God bless you you see I'm LED
[1:56:52] I said one of them there and who else is
[1:56:55] good in
[1:56:56] physics okay at least we have our sister
[1:56:58] and we have our brother if others are
[1:57:01] shy it to hold
[1:57:02] off all right when God was there
[1:57:06] standing between the hary and his people
[1:57:10] he was doing a
[1:57:12] calculation and that calculation I want
[1:57:15] them to help us do
[1:57:17] tonight it was calculating I don't know
[1:57:20] maybe the distance the speed the
[1:57:23] velocity the time and what have
[1:57:27] you that it will take 2 million
[1:57:32] people without a constant
[1:57:35] step their pace is irregular don't
[1:57:38] forget that some are weak some were
[1:57:41] strong some were being dragged along
[1:57:43] some were being
[1:57:45] pushed some even feel they couldn't make
[1:57:48] it but Moses said we are not going to
[1:57:50] leave anybody
[1:57:52] they P
[1:57:54] everybody so we are dealing with people
[1:57:57] without regular Pace or steps so there's
[1:58:01] no constant Factor here to use you can
[1:58:04] appeal to Google tonight I give you the
[1:58:06] chance but what I want you to do for us
[1:58:09] is to give us the time it will take for
[1:58:14] this two million people to cross the Red
[1:58:18] Sea such that by the time they last
[1:58:22] person is coming out the host of Egypt
[1:58:26] entirely will be in the middle of the
[1:58:28] Red Sea for their water
[1:58:31] baptism can you please help us undo
[1:58:35] that okay sister say she can't do how
[1:58:38] about you brother you a man can you do
[1:58:41] that for
[1:58:43] us on the
[1:58:47] average no you just tell us the
[1:58:52] you don't
[1:58:53] know we we we don't understand the
[1:58:55] formula but just tell
[1:58:58] us find the aage and tell
[1:59:02] us I'm asking that for you to appreciate
[1:59:05] what God himself
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:07] did are you catching it so when he was
[1:59:13] ready finishing his calculation he told
[1:59:16] Moses tell the people to go
[1:59:19] forward and they were going and they
[1:59:22] were going and they were going when it
[1:59:25] got them into a place that he knew that
[1:59:29] by the time the last person will be
[1:59:31] coming out this host don't forget the
[1:59:34] host were driving
[1:59:36] chariots they were not going to walk so
[1:59:39] their pace is going to be faster and
[1:59:41] probably
[1:59:42] uniform because if they all determined
[1:59:45] to do 100 kilm per hour it is 100
[1:59:48] average for everybody you understand so
[1:59:52] when he finished his own calculation he
[1:59:54] told the Egyptian Army to come inside he
[1:59:56] made way for them so at some point in
[1:59:59] that walk they will have met themselves
[2:00:02] in the sea are you catching it but the
[2:00:06] Bible said at a point Pharaoh was trying
[2:00:10] to run
[2:00:12] faster with his army and God said you
[2:00:15] cannot forr my
[2:00:18] calculation the speed I allocated for
[2:00:20] you to help me achieve my him is 40 km/
[2:00:23] hour so but they were trying to run 100
[2:00:26] so God put speed
[2:00:29] limitter so however had the throttle is
[2:00:33] pressed 40
[2:00:36] km you can run ahead of
[2:00:39] God and it so happened that when the
[2:00:43] last man was coming out the host of
[2:00:47] Egypt were already in the middle of the
[2:00:49] sea and sister mam and the rest pick
[2:00:52] tambourine and the Revival and the
[2:00:54] fellowship
[2:00:55] again and God said excuse me excuse me
[2:00:59] before you continue Moses close what you
[2:01:03] opened and Moses said did I not tell you
[2:01:06] people that this Egyptian you see today
[2:01:09] after now you see them
[2:01:10] [Applause]
[2:01:14] no why did God fight for Israel King
[2:01:19] David in the Book of Psalms said God
[2:01:21] fought for Israel why did God fight for
[2:01:23] Israel because they followed his
[2:01:28] provided if you want God to fight your
[2:01:30] battles if you want God to meet your
[2:01:33] needs if you want God to settle you go
[2:01:37] his provided way even when something
[2:01:40] becomes a
[2:01:41] snare God will come true for
[2:01:45] you God's will remains
[2:01:47] unchangeable and God will never repent
[2:01:49] of it do not be like David I close with
[2:01:53] this
[2:01:56] line David saw the Philistines put the
[2:01:59] Ark of God's covenant listen to me for
[2:02:03] those of us who are always looking at
[2:02:05] the
[2:02:06] world say if it works for them it could
[2:02:08] work for us there's nothing like that am
[2:02:12] I want the Believers to know that you
[2:02:14] are under a different
[2:02:16] Covenant you must know it as a
[2:02:20] revelation this is why what the word
[2:02:23] will do and get by with you won't get by
[2:02:26] with it
[2:02:27] Hallelujah there is no two ways about
[2:02:31] it God told Israel the Ark of Covenant
[2:02:35] must always be where on the shoulders of
[2:02:37] the
[2:02:39] levite but when the Philistines took
[2:02:42] it you remember in the Battle of uh uh
[2:02:47] they came against
[2:02:49] Eli and the hack of the Covenant was was
[2:02:52] taken and the two sons of Eli were
[2:02:54] killed according to prophecy amen when
[2:02:59] that Ark got to the land of Philistines
[2:03:01] they went to put it by the side of their
[2:03:02] God in the house of their hidol and God
[2:03:06] said light and darkness won't live
[2:03:08] together he made the dragon to be
[2:03:11] worshiping him they said it's a
[2:03:13] coincidence the other day he broke his
[2:03:15] scattered the dragon then they knew they
[2:03:17] had a break problem they went to consult
[2:03:20] the divers what is the reason for this
[2:03:23] they said is the hack causing your
[2:03:24] problem he said make golden M of this
[2:03:27] and that for you to know it's the one
[2:03:29] causing your problem put the AR on a new
[2:03:32] card it was by prophecy to the
[2:03:35] Philistines through their divers and God
[2:03:38] wasn't
[2:03:40] annoyed read your Bible put it on the
[2:03:43] new card and make a golden mice
[2:03:45] according to the five divisions of
[2:03:47] philistine make five and leave the ark
[2:03:50] to be going by itself if the cat goes
[2:03:53] this way is your problem if it goes this
[2:03:55] way then it's a coincidence and the ACT
[2:03:59] went the way to reveal it was their
[2:04:01] problem the Ark of the Covenant of God
[2:04:04] rode on a new cart and it landed safely
[2:04:08] back to Israel amen this was what David
[2:04:12] thought he could also do yes when he was
[2:04:15] to bring the Ark of God home he was
[2:04:18] appealing to the Pentecostal styles
[2:04:22] amen he didn't realize that he is under
[2:04:25] a different Covenant Believers you are
[2:04:28] under a different
[2:04:30] convenant God gave us the message and
[2:04:34] that is what we must follow the theme of
[2:04:37] our campaign is Jesus Christ the same
[2:04:39] yesterday today and
[2:04:42] forever the Divine instructions of this
[2:04:45] message will never change the conduct
[2:04:48] the order the doctr will never change
[2:04:51] until we is our Lord Christ so don't get
[2:04:54] bored of this
[2:04:55] manner because this is what will take
[2:04:57] you into
[2:04:58] Rapture David put it on a new cat
[2:05:01] instead of the shoulders of the levite
[2:05:03] following the example of the Philistines
[2:05:06] what did it cost it caused
[2:05:09] death and it took another 20 years
[2:05:12] before they could bring the heart and
[2:05:14] David said we didn't do it according to
[2:05:17] the word of the Lord and when they now
[2:05:19] did it according to the word of the Lord
[2:05:22] it came safely God has revealed his way
[2:05:25] to us and that is by the message of the
[2:05:27] hour he sent to us a prophet with the
[2:05:31] pillar of fire with the blood of
[2:05:33] atonement we have the pillar of cloud by
[2:05:36] day we have the pillar of Fire by night
[2:05:39] we have his messenger so we will have
[2:05:41] his word am amen and we will have the
[2:05:44] blood
[2:05:45] cover Amen in our day that is the light
[2:05:50] Hallelujah walk in it
[2:05:52] don't be tired stay safe with the
[2:05:54] message and it will Le you a nice saely
[2:05:57] God bless
[2:06:17] you God bless you
[2:06:19] brother thank you brother enoy that did
[2:06:22] you enjoy that
[2:06:23] tonight God bless you tonight maybe
[2:06:25] stand with me as we
[2:06:29] close I was thinking
[2:06:32] boy he ended so
[2:06:36] soon felt like we could have gone for a
[2:06:39] while longer what a tremendous uh
[2:06:42] message tonight brothers and sisters so
[2:06:45] many thoughts so many notes out of it
[2:06:47] but I just think it's so beautiful we
[2:06:49] need to remember God has a Ed way and
[2:06:53] he's given us a manifestation of his way
[2:06:57] the way that he promised he would do it
[2:06:59] that he would send his word to a
[2:07:02] prophet and uh he just doesn't change
[2:07:04] his way and you know one of the biggest
[2:07:08] things I think I got tonight is that we
[2:07:11] need to be able to identify our
[2:07:14] character in the
[2:07:16] scripture isn't that beautiful there's
[2:07:18] nothing new Under the Sun we have
[2:07:21] problem problems we have situations but
[2:07:24] what we need to remember is that God is
[2:07:26] obligated to his people just as much as
[2:07:30] he's obligated to his word because if
[2:07:32] his people are called by his name if
[2:07:35] they call upon him and identify look you
[2:07:40] brought me here
[2:07:41] Lord he is obligated to his people what
[2:07:45] a tremendous thought and you know we
[2:07:46] could say that's brother Dall talking to
[2:07:48] us that way but that's God talking to us
[2:07:52] God wants us to remember that he is
[2:07:55] obligated to his people and if we're
[2:07:57] willing to Humble ourselves in his sight
[2:08:01] to his word then he will bless us what a
[2:08:05] tremendous message
[2:08:07] tonight you know I just uh I just want
[2:08:10] to sing a couple of songs here
[2:08:15] um How Great Is Our God maybe we could
[2:08:18] sing that as we close here
