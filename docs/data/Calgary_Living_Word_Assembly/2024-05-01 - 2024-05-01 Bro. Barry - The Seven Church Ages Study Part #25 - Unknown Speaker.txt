just like to thank everyone for the special tonight that was was tremendous thank you musicians for your service to the king if you have your Bibles tonight i' just like to read from the book of Revelation amen continuing on with our study and the exposition of the seven Church ages the uh chapter on smna we'll read from Revelations chapter 2 not very many verses start with verse eight of Revelations chapter two and unto the angel of the church in smna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of those which say they are Jews and are not but are are are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for this word Lord thank you for the admonition to every age right at the end father you say he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we know there's many churches but there's only one mystical body of Jesus Christ and father tonight we just declare this that Lord Jesus he that hath an ear each one let them hear what your spirit has to say to us we just commit all these words now the rest of this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I certainly am excited about this study in the Book of Revelation the exposition of the seven Church ages we know that that's what it's from in Revelations uh two and three there's all of the different Church ages that are spoken to and uh it gets real good when you get into the end of Revelations chapter 3 because we know that John who was on the aisle of Patmos for the testimony of Jesus Christ he's given a further Revelation and he's invited to come up a little bit higher um Lord willing will get there eventually tonight we just have a few announcements I wanted to make make I just wanted to remind everyone that we have the prayer meeting tomorrow night the first Thursday of the month we have a communion service coming up on the 26th of May and that will be at 5:30 p.m. not 6 o'clock it will be at 5:30 to uh help expedite the service and tomorrow night we'll have the service at 7:30 just sort of the regular time uh we have the Men's breakfast coming up May 18th at 10:00 a.m. at our house for those who can come we have brother Dela adelon he will be here June the 2nd brother Jack Duff will be here Wednesday July the 17th and yes brother Maran uh sister Marian and brother tiabo I apologize will be flying to Kenya this Saturday already for the marriage for the wedding hallelujah amen it's hard to believe that's already upon us we certainly will be praying for you continue to pray for you that God will lead you and guide you in your positions as husband and wife certainly uh a little sad that I'm not going to be able to be there to see the marriage but we will actually have a little bit of a a gathering at our house for the uh reception we'll have the the Canadian reception here uh in Canada so we're certainly looking forward to your return as husband and wife God richly bless you brother tiabo and sister Maran you happy tonight amen I certainly have thoroughly enjoyed this um study in the exposition of the seven Church ages amen and uh you know last week we got into some real interesting things the hybrid religion how brother Bram talks about the mule and the donkey and uh how there's one that can actually be um continued on they can actually recreate themselves and the other one cannot and we know a hybrid religion cannot the spirit itself is void from a hybrid religion and brother Branham uses that comparison naturally and uh it's it's amazing to see it because uh there is no bringing forth of the spirit even if there is a Revival as soon as we go and mix man's Thoughts with that Revival the spirit becomes void from that Gathering and uh we know that people will continue on but like be gets like every seed will bring forth after its own kind and uh if you preach a Methodist Doctrine you're going to breed Methodist children and if you preach a Baptist Doctrine if you preach a Pentecostal Doctrine and I'll go even so far as to say if you just preach a message Doctrine you're going to preach message children but what we want to preach continually is the baptism of the Holy Ghost get into Christ Jesus that is the admonition he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to every single Church age and every single Church age had a portion of elect Believers it's not just from the leoan church age where the elect will come from it's going to be very interesting to meet polycarp to shake his hand and say how did that go how how could you possibly have done that and gone through that and all of his disciples and all of the Believers from all the ages it's so wonderful but we talked about the hybrid religion last time and uh you know one of the things that I think is just so important to to make sure that we we we we maybe just emphasize just say it again uh because it's so important is brother bradam talks about how that the the synagogue of Satan under that heading the synagogue of Satan part of the scripture that we've read last week we covered this how they were liars and since they were Liars they could not make any claim or they could make any claim that they wished they could just say whatever they want to because they're liars and that's how people are when they are liars they can say whatever they want and really there's no way you can actually prove it and you know it's a terrible thing but it's a true thing uh many people in this world actually are and not even religious but you know it becomes so hurtful for people people who do Gather in the name of Jesus Christ around a religious gathering and and they do let down the bars and they get a little bit honest and and they do actually maybe expose themselves to trusting other people that believe that that they're in the same nature the same Vein The Same Spirit of Christ and then they find out not very long after they've actually told things about themselves that they were actually speaking to Liars they were speaking to people that don't actually have their best interest at heart and are willing to go and actually maybe talk about them behind their backs it's not a very good feeling but that happens in the world and we trust that doesn't happen in the Church of the Living God brother bam goes on to say this in paragraph 42 they could say what they wanted as though it were fact and then stick to it and in this case they could be I'm just going to get rid of that a little bit they could be lying with a very powerful thought in mind was it not so that the early church was almost if not entirely composed of Jews making them the original members of his body the twel apostles were Jews and the LA later apostles were either Jews or pelites thus for men to swear they were Jews would give them a preeminence and a claim to originality tell a lie stick to it never mind fact or history just just say it and keep saying it to the people and soon the people will receive it I just think that's so good because we don't have to dwell in lies but that's what that hybrid religion is built on WE rely on fact we rely on the truth of the Living God the truth of the word the revealed word through a Vindicated Prophet get the baptism of the Holy Spirit get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he the spirit of truth the life of Jesus Christ that begins to live through us will begin to express himself to us and through us and I think it's such a beautiful thing if you listen to the Token in 1963 brother bradam talks about the chemical life of the blood and how that needs to be on display we need to show the chemical blood we need to be able to show when the death angel is going to pass over our house when disease and problems are going to come our way we need to be able to point to those those those doorposts and that lentil that we have a that chemical blood but that's not it many people stop right there and and that is that that that call it that legalistic perspective where you get stuck in a position and you think that you've gone far enough you have not gone far enough you've got to see the life inside that blood not the chemical the life of that blood has to begin to live out through our lives and when that happens then Satan knows he can't touch us but until that happens the Devil he's got a Punch coming and he's going to go right for our knows he's not very kind but carrying on with what we were talking about last week in paragraph 77 this is uh maybe I'll just go back to 76 here they have a name that they live but are dead tongues isn't the evidence of Revival it is the evidence of death this one just about blew me away when I got into this tongues proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the Jews was over and that a new era had begun that's why they were so upset they said these people are stumbling around like drunk people and you know it's beautiful because brother Ram really expresses it how you know in in in the book of Acts we know the story the day of Pentecost when it was fully come the the licks of fire the clothing tongues over their heads and they spoke in many different languages all the languages of the people around they weren't speaking in an unknown tongue that nobody knew they were speaking in something that was interpreted and we know that's the evidence of the true evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost when someone is speaking in tongues under the baptism of the Holy Ghost not that that is the true evidence I forgive me for saying it the way I did but when somebody does truly speak in tongues there will be an interpretation there will be an understanding of what they're saying it won't just be someone speaking in a different language and then they'll just phase back in and suddenly be speaking in English again and many times that's what you see when you start talking to religious folks they'll be talking to you and then all of a sudden oh they'll just shoot off in an unknown tongue and then they'll phase back and and just be speaking in English again but there's no interpretation of that and we know that Paul talks about that expressly but you know the speaking in tongues was not something that was actually adding to the Jews religion it was proclaiming that it was over that they chose a murderer and a robber and a liar just like Cain they chose barabus over Jesus Christ the Messiah and that was because we needed to come in we needed to actually see this gospel it's an amazing thing the way God does it brother Bron goes on to say tongues today is ringing down the curtain on the Gentile Church ages and the gospel is going back to the Jews people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat my the truth is that it is writing the Finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms the kingdom of God is being ushered in wake up people of God wake up now this is where I kind of find it hard sometimes when you get into the truth because we believe this to be the truth the absolute truth I don't think there's anything in here that I dispute I don't need to go and fact check every single step of the way I believe that this was a Vindicated Prophet that was sent to us for a purpose and that purpose was so that we could actually attain to rapturing Faith the faith that will actually change these bodies where the not just chemical life of the blood is something that we can point to and talk about but that literal life is something that preaches out to the world around us and even those who love us even to ourselves we step back after situations and wonder what just happened there that is not normal for me I don't know why I did that but then something says yeah you do you know exactly why because it wasn't you it was me amen but in paragraph 77 brother bradam says if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pulpit without a call from God they have styled themselves the Fishers of Men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 410 to13 that God gave the church has failed so they're taking over now I just want to pause here tonight and and talk about this let's turn over to the book of Ephesians let's read that scripture we're all very familiar with it I'm sure but for those who aren't I think it Bears the necessity to to make sure that we're pointing to this and and saying that this is not something that's really that far for and out there and maybe in some crazy denominational circles this is right close to home brothers and sisters the prophet was prophesying as he was writing these words Ephesians chap 4: 11 it's verse uh sorry 10 to 13 verse 10 of Ephesians chapter 4 it says he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things now we know exactly who that is there's no question about who that is that is God the Lord Jesus Christ verse 11 says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ not the bodies not the churches not the bride not the brides but the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and and what's that going to be what will that look like in our lives that will be when that literal blood I say literal I'll say literal life of the blood is pumping through our veins and we're no longer ourselves and that rapturing faith has actually taken hold in our lives and we no longer have the little disputings that we have going on we come into the unity of the faith and we understand that this is God's work and he's going to do it however he's going to do it but how is he going to do it he's going to do it with Apostles and he's going to do it with prophets and he's going to do it with evangelists and pastors and teachers amen but there's some people that will sing the song Ephesians 4 is not enough now brothers and sisters that's around the message that's Dangerous Waters that's right because we had one Vindicated Prophet for this age that was the major prophet that fulfilled the scripture there's not two there's no Apostolic succession the rapturing faith lies on the tapes that's good but that rapturing faith that lies on the tapes needs to be expounded upon the prophet even said so some of you young ministers take this and expound upon it I don't have the time to do that amen but how can we actually be perfected if we take this out and we say that Ephesians 4 is not enough oh we don't need to you know what if we do that then we can start tearing out other pages in The Bible we could say you know what I I I could have multiple wives I could put my wife away for whatever you know how it goes you could start to do whatever you want to do we don't want to do that we want to take the word of God we want to take the absolute and say yes indeed it is for the perfecting of the Saints it's not just playing a tape put them back in the Pulpit God took him out of the pulpit why did he take him out of the pulpit so that he could have an anointed Ministry so that there could be men who preach this gospel under the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen now rapturing faith lies on a tapes but what are we supposed to to do leave it there we're supposed to eat the book we're supposed to consume those tapes we're supposed to listen to them we're supposed to feed upon them we need those tapes we need the books we need to feed on the message of the hour so that not that we can say that we just feed on the message of the hour so that we can become the message of the hour that's the purpose of the tapes brothers and sisters amen Ephesians 4 isend enough that is the perfecting of the Saints so going back to this I just want to read this again they have styled themselves the Fishers of Men the founders of the move of God and say that the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4:10 to13 that God gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy called the gains sayings of Kora and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth to say that you know once upon a time things were absolutely wonderful and it's our duty to Proclaim that and it's important to do that amen because there's a Vindication behind it but it's not for the purpose of continually pointing backwards it's for promoting going forwards with that Spirit they are blindly going on preaching experence for truth may God have pity on them may their eyes be open before it's too late now brothers and sisters I'm not throwing off on anyone I want us all to get into Christ that's my desire just get the Holy Ghost in our lives and you know I I I saw a poster that I thought that it was really good not all people that were that are wandering that are Wanderers are lost it's a very true statement we can't put anybody in or put anybody out but if someone is actually preaching the word of God separately from what the word of God says then we can identify what that is it's a very important thing and you know what if we have a brother or a sister we need to be able to say brother or sister what you're saying isn't according to the word of God if he's a true brother or sister he'll say oh I'm sorry that I said it that way I never meant it that way I would always want to come in line with the word of God then get angry and say no no no no no no what I'm saying is is right I got a further Revelation there's no further Revelation than what the Vindicated Prophet for our age brought brothers and sisters every revelation will fall under that Revelation or it's a wrong Revelation he goes on to say oh listen to me when did The Prestige of money social leadership business ability or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for Spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of God and when in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit alone then we are fighting against God and not for him now I want this on record right here I'm not speaking against the elders in the church no sir and that Elder can be as poor as any man was ever poor or be the richest man in the world as long as he is an elder in heart and deed that's why we can't just look at someone and judge them and I would recommend not looking at anybody and judging them let God judge them just love everyone and see what God will do he says I would not hesitate to ordain any man that has the real spiritual qualifications as an elder or Deacon regardless of his finances or social position but when you see a social or financial structure come into the church that divides the folks in any way that is not of God right it is another sign of the time in this physically rich but spiritually impoverished leodan age in which we are now living so he just takes it right out of the samni age and brings it right up to home right to the leoan age but it's beautiful because we're not in the leoan age we're in the bride age now oh my paragraph 80 I Know Thy poverty did you notice that their poverty is linked up with the synagogue of Satan in that same verse yes it is the rich powerful organization that has the wealth and always pushes out the little people that serve God when the spirit moves out in the hearts of men who is it that leaves the building on the property the little flock always loses out to the big organization and where do the people go then go they worship in homes old store buildings and basements just as they did when they went to the catacombs these people were poor in this world's good certainly but they were rich in spirit I know they're blasphemy now it isn't the thought here that these Liars were blaspheming God though that goes without saying but they are blaspheming the true church it is always thus the Jews of Jerusalem blasphemed the church at the beginning the Gentile polytheist did likewise if anyone is going to be evil spoken of it will always be the true seed Amen in Nero's Day the Christians were blamed for every Calamity even for the burning of Rome we heard that when we went through Rome we went through through the the Vatican City and uh did the tour and the guy that we were with were in a semi-private tour and he explained that in great detail how Nero watched the city burn and played his violin and was drunk and was just reviling in the moment and then what did he do he blamed the whole city burning on the Christians which caused everyone to be in an uproar and it persecuted the church hard after that in communist countries the little flock is always the first first to be exterminated though actually insignificant in size though the Christians are fine loyal people who do only good they will always be persecuted to the end that they might be physically destroyed the reason this is so is because they are a rebuke to the Godless like a sore thumb they stand out before the wicked and though the righteous intend no harm to the wicked Wicked but want to do only good invariably they find they are embroiled as was John the Baptist with Herod for John did not want to harm either Herod or his wife but to save them from the wrath of God right now I think it's important just to say that it doesn't give us license because we hear that to go and just point our finger in people's noses and say that you're a sinner you need to repent and try and belittle people belittling people will not attract them to the gospel yes sir in ourselves in piety will not attract people to the gospel but just living the life of Jesus Christ will attract the people's attention to our lives people will say oh I'm sorry for swearing we know we've said this many times sorry I swear I didn't mean to do that and you'll be like why why you saying sorry like what difference does it make to you and they'll say well there's something different about you yeah there is you don't even have to say a word and they know it the spirit inside of them is recognizing the spirit inside of you right it's because we're a rebuke to society people who are believers are a rebuke to the Godless uh this was not only thoroughly misunderstood and absolutely withstood but John was put to death because of it and for all the good the people of God do they are still put to public shame and to death surely there must be some Sinister force behind a people who would be so void of conscience that they would return evil to those who did good to them yes there is such a force it's Satan the answer lies in the next verse in Revelations 2:10 fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life every time the Lord uses those words fear not there is an engagement at hand which will involve Great danger and suffering and deprivation now he does not say in a blunt Curt manner tribulation is coming that would frighten one but like a mother who is about to turn out the light says gently to her child lest he be frightened now don't be afraid for the light will go out and it will be dark but remember that I am here with you amen so he says don't be afraid of man or what he can do to you I am with you and my grace is sufficient for you amen when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even in death are you defeated you are more than conquerors the great Apostle Paul knew from experience the reality of those words and he wrote in Romans 8:35 to39 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword for it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord I just think it's so beautiful I just want to encourage us tonight if you have the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church than this applies amen nothing absolutely nothing is going to be able to separate you from the love of God because you have his spirit in you and that's the reason why you can hear what the spirit saith unto the church it's such a consolation you know one day we're going to look back and think about all of the struggles and all of the trials remember brother brother Gary Walker when he was here and he said the words that he wanted to hear that that he believes we will hear that we'll say with our voice when we get over there we'll look at all of the struggles and all of the trials in our life and we'll say it was worth it all once we're over there just for one second it was worth it all he goes on in paragraph 85 here he says no we are not to fear his love casts out all fear so I just want to encourage us tonight brothers and sisters if we have fear there's a spirit that's attacking you and his love will cast out that fear sometimes we just need to actually confess that we're afraid we need to say those words the word says to confess your faults one to another that's why we have prayer meetings come to a prayer meeting we can pray one for another we can actually Express the desires the prayers that we have in our hearts and when our brothers and sisters hear it we can pray one for another and what does the word say then we'll be healed it's beautiful we don't have to fear his love casts out all fear now notice what he says the devil will cast some of you into prison that you might be tried the Jews were doing that right then the Pagan priests were doing that right then the governors who tried to Cur Curry favor with the public because the people liked the arena hurled the Christians by the thousands to their death destroying them by lions and Gladiators what has the devil to do with this why blame him ah yes but it is the devil's hatred behind it all he is behind it all for he hates God and what God has set his heart on Satan is bound to try and Destroy but watch here is some illumination if Satan is behind the Jews who are hailing Christians into court then the Jews are not of God's religion but the Devils that's sharp their Gathering is also of the synagogue of Satan and if the Roman Catholic Church killed the multitudes of Believers in the Dark Ages yes and in all ages then they are of the devil and belong to Satan also and if you think this is shocking just wait until the prophecy of Revelations 13 is fulfilled it is strikingly true that the United States of America is in that chapter the very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it started with 13 colonies it's flagged has 13 stars and 13 stripes and there is her Destiny in the 13th chapter and I think it's interesting too I could be wrong with this um but just to throw it out there how many provinces and territories are there in Canada I believe there's the same number in this image that is mentioned in this chapter will be found all the wickedness of the Beast that was before for it as the Beast Rose at the Ning Council so the image will come out of the World Council of churches with all ungodly and satanic power to vent the anger of the devil upon the True Vine of God it will be a Repeat Performance of all diabolical cunning and cruelty those who fight the humble of God and scoff and Destroy let them do it and do it they will and all in the name of God and religion but they lie right they are not of God they are of their father the devil they by their deeds against any people expose themselves for what they are Cain exposed exactly who he was by the nature that he expressed and it's no different for us brothers and sisters today the nature that we express we said it on Sunday just put a little pressure just see what happens add some pressure and you'll see who's on the inside they'll come out brother Ram says let them organize and repudiate the little flock they but further reveal to all that they are of the devil they are the false Vine the vine that murders their hatred proves who they are the nickan Antichrist Church is who they are they shall be cast into prison yes they that hailed into court and falsely accused and tried and imprisoned and of course it is all done in the name of religion and decency and outraged innocency I all done for a good cause he says that makes me think of the Supreme Court's ruling on prayer and Bible reading in the schools who is behind it Satan is it's just another angry Outburst against God Thou shalt have tribulation 10 days here is a prophecy and with it is a means of determining the lifespan of the saman age di Dian the cruelest of all Emperors launched a terror campaign against the Saints of God that except for the mercy of God would have wiped out all believers it was the bloodiest in history and lasted 10 years the 10 days of Revelations 210b from 302 to 3:12 be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful unto death until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yay Millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like Antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall the faith that we daily use to Triumph in Christ is the same faith that upholds the polycarp and all martyrs the Supreme faith will give us Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour amen blessed be God forever I think it's so beautiful brothers and sisters there is coming a day however when that Grace is Gone when that Grace lifts off and then people will actually give their own lives with without that anointing and it will not be pretty but that's why we get the Holy Ghost that's why we keep preaching get the Holy Ghost while we can he's here we just have to get the Holy Ghost and I will give thee a crown of life since not even a cup of cold water given in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward how great shall the reward to him how great shall be the reward to him who gives his life as a martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crown with the crown one in a race 1 Corinthians 9 9 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain a crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One Crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are Incorruptible they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plotts of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their lives for God either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the Crown of Life we know that the world has a saying that says he who dies with the most toys wins if we're worrying about this world about achievements about all of the successes that we can get in this world and putting Christ to be second and third on our list of priorities then we're going to fulfill that first part but if we are striving to actually submit ourselves therefore unto God every single day brothers and sisters there is a crown of life waiting for each one of us paragraph 93 all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and have an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints and we know that the word of God says to lay up Treasures in Heaven amen where neither moth nor rust can corrupt nothing Earthly can get through neither can thieves break through and steal those those Treasures are laid up in heaven reserved undefiled for us in our own names and I think it's so beautiful because it starts with our ability to hear the word but then one day there's going to be that that great long gigantic enormous marriage supper table and there's going to be a place setting with each and every one of our names and nobody can change that all of the all of the reward will be there it'll start and it'll just be a wonderful time won't it the reward for overcoming Revelations 2 verse 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death now once again the spirit is talking to all ages this message is to comfort us today even as it has comforted our Brethren over all the ages I think it's just so beautiful how brother Bram continually brings this out that the the words that we're reading about the church ages that's not just exclusive to that age it's about every age and he says to us that the second death will not hurt us we all know that the second death is the Lake of Fire Revelations 20:14 and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death I think this is a beautiful part brothers and sisters where he goes into a real detailed explanation we're going to do it about how there is no Eternal death there's only eternal life amen there's only one form of Eternal and that is Zoey God's own life brother bam goes on to say in paragraph 95 of course that means that all those who were therein were cast into the Lake of Fire now then I want to bring out something here for you it no doubt will cause some people to comment on my strange Doctrine no doubt but I stand here on the authority of the word of God and deny that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns there eternally in the first place hell or the Lake of Fire or whatever you want to call it is not Eternal and I think it's beautiful I'm just going to pause there and say it because it doesn't say Eternal in the word of God does it there's no word that says Eternal linked to hell or the Lake of Fire how can it be if it had a beginning in Matthew 25:41 it says that Everlasting the key word Everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels now if it was prepared then it wasn't without a beginning if it had a beginning then it can't be Eternal of course you might stumble over the idea of the word Everlasting but that word means from ages to the ages and has different meanings attached to it in 1st Samuel 3:13-14 God told Samuel that he was going to judge the house of Eli forever and that they would offer no more sacrifices forever as his priests and in First Kings 2:27 Solomon thrust out the last descendants of Eli from the priesthood that was four generations or so later now you can see that Everlasting does not compare with what is eternal or that which had no beginning or end here in this case the word Everlasting means to the vanishing point that is what happened they vanished look at the word destruction over in 2 Thessalonians 1:19 who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction in the Greek destruction positively means Annihilation and the word destruction does not mean destroying the words have meanings brothers and sisters now destroying means something going on and in Decay so what can Everlasting annihilation mean it doesn't mean to keep on annihilating or that would make the word destroying instead of Destruction it means to destroy to the ending point end it you might wonder now when you can use that word Eternal and not use it the way we have been taught that is easy when it applies to God it means to be without beginning or end and ever enduring and never ceasing and when you talk of eternal life you have that in mind which is the life of God Amen 1 John 51-12 this is the record that God has given us eternal life and that life is in his son he that hath the son hath life that's why we can't go about taking Jesus and saying that he wasn't God soon as we start doing that we don't have the son paragraph 99 now then only sons of God have life eternal the kind that never had a beginning but always was that is right if you have something in you you have something in you right now that is eternal without beginning or end it is the spirit of God it is a part of God himself it is the life of God am so beautiful now if a sinner is going to hell and then suffer the same as you were going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the same kind of life you have already doesn't that just make sense right yeah well then there might be those who say eternal life signifies the welfare of the children of God it is their welfare and enjoyment that is ex it that is at stake on the other hand The Sinner goes on to his punishment so that we can reduce the second death to a matter of punishment and place eternal life means heaven and eternal punishment means hell he says you would be surprised surprised at the men who have been exalted as theologians that believe that but do you know what that does it makes eternal life a matter of geography instead of a person it makes eternal life a matter of geography instead of a person eternal life is God the Lord Jesus Christ how anyone could believe believe such a thing that eternal life is a matter of place is more than I know it makes me stagger to think of it brothers and sisters I want to say it this way people believe that because of tradition teaching for tradition the doctrines of men yes that's what it is but it is staggering to think about once you have actually been able to hear about the truth but you know this is some of the stuff that I had to fight through when I came around to the message of the hour I had to think my goodness I didn't even think that I had ever thought about hell being Eternal or or or Eternal punishment I always thought Everlasting and eternal were the same but they're not but they're taught to be interchangeable the words have meaning and they're a very important thing paragraph 102 no sir there is only one kind of eternal life God has it if we have God we have eternal life in and through him so beautiful so you see that word Eternal or Everlasting can be applied in various ways but when it applies to God he being what he is it has one meaning it is the duration of God you can't apply it like that to any other thing isn't that beautiful you could just totally eliminate every other thing and just say it only applies to God Eternal only applies to God God is the only eternal my God Alone is eternal and because he lives we live with him sorry this just makes me want to preach once I get into this like this it's so good amen so rich paragraph 104 now don't let anyone say that I don't believe in a lake of fire and in punishment I do and I I'll tell you my own perspective is you know the devil will say well if there's no eternal hell then you could sin potentially and just be in annihilated you just live your life eat drink and be merry and then potentially you go get punished for a little while and then you just annihilate it it's over you're gone right listen to what he says here now don't let anyone tell you I don't believe in a lake of fire and in punishment I do I don't know how long it will last but it will eventually be removed in Revelations 21:8 it says that those Sinners mentioned will have their part in the Lake of Fire but the true interpretation of the word is not part but it is time they will have their time in the Lake of Fire see there you have it so the wicked shall be cast into hell Hades or the grave and Hell into the Lake of Fire separated from God what a terrible thing that will be it will be just can't even imagine it but with the righteous it shall not be so they don't have to fear they have been redeemed by God they are in his bosom they are the Overcomers and who is he that overcometh he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ am Hallelujah why will this Overcomer this believer escape and go into the Realms of eternal life and Bliss because Jesus isn't this beautiful God came in Jesus and paid a price to Ransom us from sin he filled the gap of separation and we who were a far off are now made nigh by by the blood Oh my he did it we can't do it we can only accept that he did it and if we're willing to accept it on the basis that he presents it then he did it amen and they will never come into condemnation they will never be in that Lake of Fire they can never be lost for he will lose none of them not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus is not even where brother Bram is right now when he was over on on this side and he went beyond the curtain of time and he said to them I want to see Jesus and they said you can't see him now it's not like that my oh my when that day comes brothers and sisters not one of their redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus is and I just think it's beautiful because we could even go so far as to say it this way this is where it gets a little bit weird but you know it's not weird to the believer because anywhere the believer is today is where Jesus is am and that's just a fact paragraph 109 do you believe do you know why that is I will illustrate it for you I have a little boy Joseph he is a part of me no matter what happens if I Were a Rich Man the most I could do would be to disinherit him the worst sorry the worst I could do would be to disinherit him but there is nothing that I can ever do to deny him I can't because he's a part of me here let's take a blood test let's match his blood with mine it'll prove that Joseph is my son he is mine it's the blood test that shows whether you belong to God or not and like we've said brothers and sisters I just can't get this out of my my mind just like out of the token brother preaches it it's not the chemical blood it's not the substance of the blood it's not just speaking the blood it's living the blood it's letting that life of the blood come forward in our lives brother Bram goes on to say I can't help thinking of the time that I used to ride Herd on I used to ride Herd on purebred herfords in Colorado we used to have to bring those cattle for government inspection if we wanted to feed them on the government range but they would not allow one single animal that did not have the blood tag on the ear the tag signified that it was pure bread the Rangers looked them over the Rangers that looked them over did not look at the brand they just looked at the tag to see that the blood was the blood was the right blood Hallelujah if it's the right blood it's got to be right amen you know God looked down and declared the soul that sinth shall die it is separated from me it can't approach unto me we know that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God that meant that all died all were separated and one day a time would come when even that bit of life would be snuffed out and it would be all over but God In Love took an animal and took its life in the place of the sinner's life amen and we know brothers and sisters that that started in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve disbelieved the word of God Adam followed his wife's disbelief she was deceived he followed her God handed out the curses and he banished them from the garden banished them from the tree of life because they chose to feed on the tree of knowledge of good and evil we know the trees one was God one was Jesus one was the devil they were all there in the garden trees were people but here we have the situation what did God do he took them and showed them there is going to be a covering for you and it's not going to be your religious covering that you think that you have the leaves that they took and covered themselves with he said it's going to be an animal covering and he took and slew the first sacrifice himself and WRA them with those skins and we know the prophet of God talked about how it must have been for them walking out of the garden those first steps marching out of the garden with the wet bloody hides of those skins slapping against their thighs as they walked out knowing that every single time they have transgressed the laws of God now they have to rely on the sacrifice of an animal and we know that all the way down through the Old Testament that sacrifice happened and that's what the temple was actually built for that brother Nester was preaching on we're going to get into that but not tonight night it just it's so amazing to look at it but God In Love took an animal and took its life in the place of the sinner's life amen I'll call the musicians as we close here paragraph 112 we'll pick up from here next week Lord willing amen paragraph 112 in the Old Testament The Sinner brought a lamb he placed his hand on the lamb while the priest cut the Lamb's throat he felt the bleeding and heard the bleeding he he felt the bleeding and he heard the bleeding the animal crying for his life as it fell out of him he felt the body stiffen in death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood Ascend to God he knew that the lamb had taken his place but he knew that that Lamb's life had been forfeited for his amen but the life of that lamb was an animal life and it could not come back on the sinner making him clean so he left with the same desire to sin he would go out with sin in his mind and come back and offer a sacrifice for the same thing a year later stand with me tonight as we close but the New Testament in the New Testament it is not so our dying lamb is the Son of God who gave his blood a ransom for many by faith we walk up and place our hands upon that lamb we see him with the bloody wounds the lacerated back the cruel Thorns tearing his brow we feel his pain and hear him cry my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and what happened the life that left that broken blood cell came back upon the repentant one the life that was in him came back upon us and we go back with no more desire to sin and we now possess a hatred for the works and lust of the flesh let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just are so thankful for your gift of love that you gave us Lord so many people had to live under the animal sacrifice throughout so many ages Lord and father tonight we can read these words and recognize that you came and You Paid It All once and for all and then you sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and you did it for our sake Lord amen you did it so that we wouldn't even have to try and do anything the only thing that we have to do in the day in which we live is just believe help us Lord father we believe but help thou our unbelief father Lord Jesus help us to have a hatred for the old ways of the old man help us not to dig up the old man help us not to look back lord Jesus like Lot's wife but help us father to take the free gift that you've offered us and Run Run To You Lord we love you and we thank you Father for this life that you've given us through your own blood that you shed for us at Calvary and Lord we pray that we could just be a witness to this dying world all around us father be with those who couldn't be here tonight Lord wherever they are whatever they're doing father we pray that you would just restore their strength father that you would just lift them up on the wings of an eagle father and Lord Jesus each and every one of us father I pray the same prayer that you would just give us strength father give us Joy give us love father that we would go forwards Lord Jesus with the Heavenly Dove we love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen he became me amen he became me so that I might become him by Grace he became me so that I might become him by grace [Music] he became me so that I might become by Grace amen
