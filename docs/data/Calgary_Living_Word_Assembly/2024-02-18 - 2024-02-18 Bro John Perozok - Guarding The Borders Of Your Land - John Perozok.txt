we really enjoyed that and God bless you guys and we headed to our hotel and not long after we arrived uh we got a call saying there's a package for us and someone had brought us fruit and snacks and

and you're the one that we look to Lord You're the the one that we can just if we can just turn our eyes on you Lord in this moment Lord look full in your wonderful face all the things Lord that's not a light that if we look at the sun it might blind us but if we look into you Lord all the things of the world grow dim Lord and and if we look and we keep on looking Lord the promises of God come to pass sometimes we have to hold on to it and keep looking but they come Lord Jesus Lord we come Lord be merciful heal the sick The Afflicted Lord Lord You've atoned for these things at Calvary and Lord we we know that our personal property our inheritance Lord we we're starting to walk in that more and more recognizing the place that we stand in the Holy Ghost Lord I pray we could come and explore the land a little bit more and find where we need to overcome find where we need to guard ourselves find where we can just buckle up a little more Lord be with us now may the Holy Spirit take the word and you'd pack the message get me out of the way Lord I can't but you can and pray take this speaker the hearer every single one Lord here in Jesus name amen well God bless you thank you to the Musicians the specials and brother Fen the sister that sang that's one of my that song where would I be I I I've loved that song in the last month or two where would we be if it wasn't for the grace of God Isaiah if we can turn to Isaiah chapter 60 we'll just read a couple different scriptures Isaiah second Timothy and then maybe we'll just sit and I'll I'll I'll read something from the Psalms and we'll start but Isaiah chapter 60 and I'll title this this morning guarding the borders of your land guarding the borders of it's your land so let's guard the borders that are around it I'll take some thoughts it's it's I've different things I've spoken and maybe this is coming together from different things that I've spoken in the last while and even some experiences we went through last year and we're in a great battle we're in a battle of where there's crisises around us more than ever before there's people that struggle there's people that strive the the Mind battles that we have even are greater than ever before and I believe that our mind is our inheritance even our bodies Our inheritance there's places that God's laid out in this great Promised Land There are our inheritance we want to overcome every part of it and we want to guard the borders of it keep all the Devils back no matter what would come amen amen Isaiah chapter 60 whe the brandom would take this and parts of this or maybe all of this in the message Shalom arise verse one Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee Hallelujah for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising now I believe Jesus would say that I am the light of the world but then he would say ye are the light of the world Amen because if if his light is gone and he's not just gone he's he's in at the sitting at the right hand of the throne there's a place that light still has to be and that's in you and it's in me Hallelujah second Timothy 1 verse 7 a familiar scripture but I I think an ever important scripture in the day that we live in second Timothy 1 this is the great battle that we face in our day for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind God bless you you can have your seats guarding the borders of your land uh this scripture jumped out of me in Psalms CH 37:3 and it says trust in the Lord and do good amen so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily shalt thou be fed and this morning by God's grace I'd like to take this thought looking some pulling some thoughts brother Brandon would maybe bring from the adoption message or Paradox or or even Shalom and maybe some from the greatest battle ever fought but looking at as we come into the land that God's given us in this message of the hour there's places to overcome and there's a place that we begin to learn to walk in and we recognize that the battle that we're in is not so much natural anymore but it's spiritual and I'll leave it and we'll just begin but brother brother Joshua would say brother I keep saying brother bradam and then I I read someone else but in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them when God gives you something oh it's it's it's yours which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you amen as I said unto Moses then he begins to lay out the borders from the Wilderness and this Lebanon which we even see today missiles coming from Lebanon and these from this from the from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea going down Unto the Sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life where when you're in the land as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will will not fail thee amen nor forsake thee Hallelujah be strong and of a good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou very strong or strong and very courageous this book of the law and I'll drop down this book of the law mostly because I lost my place this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success the only time in the King James version of the Bible that the word success is mentioned here's the secret to your success you're looking for observe and meditate on the word of God have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be doubt dismayed no matter what we're up against no matter what crisis we're facing no matter what trial something that we up against that we we don't know what to do be not dismayed look up a little higher now today we live in a realm of five senses we know this well see taste feel smell hear and we bump into all these solid objects we have bump into things that smell we we we have to be able to see in this three-dimensional World in this place of time and space and matter we have to God gave us these senses to contact this realm now the children of Israel lived in this realm and they left Egypt naturally they went through a Wilderness naturally they came to Kadesh they even rejected the word for a while they went around the Wilderness then they came to a Promised Land naturally and they set out to overcome naturally we don't do that we live in a spiritual land we live as much as we live in a natural world we are learning and God is teaching us day by day by day to look to the Unseen to realize what we're faced with we ought to look for the spiritual context where's my spiritual battle where's the what's the atmosphere I'm faced with as much as we want to be healthy wealthy and wise in this world that's not the point it's good we have to have our jobs we have to have all these things laid out but there's something greater there's something greater God is focused on something deeper than just our fleshly Comforts go our Leo deia is focused on fleshly comfort Comforts but God is forming sometimes by allowing fleshly suffering a spiritual character something on the inside and I I recognize we're all in different places in our walks so I want to say this no matter what stage you're in whether the the promised land types the Holy Ghost they had to come out of Egypt and they had to go into the Holy Ghost through justification through baptism in the sea and in the cloud and they walked through the Wilderness they were Sanctified they stepped into the promised land and they were striving for finding their place the adoption but we're all in different places I want to say though tonight or I'm used to speaking in the night I want to say this morning you are predestinated unto right all the way to adoption so no matter where you're at and where you find yourself a young person you say I haven't been baptized or I haven't been filled or I'm still struggling or I don't even know if I believe any of this but if there's something on the inside if there's a little seed if there's a little twinge a little something that begins to speak to you and pull to you give way to that and it will bring you all the way to the land and it'll bring you all the way to your place you're predestinated not just to live a halfway life you're predestinated to adoption now we can say these words adoption and that sounds big and strange but it's finding your place it's finding that place where I'm overcoming I'm in my land and I've pushed back the enemies and I'm here and God is using me in this spot and God can say hear ye him it's not it's a big thing and yet maybe we make it too mysterious in our minds but God is focused on building a spiritual character now in this natural world that we live in we often focus on what we wear and how we look and getting our finances in order and getting our health in order and and focused on what we eat and what we intake and all of these different things and we even protect oursel we if we're if you're if you're if you're riding in a car you put your seat Bel on if you're if you're driving down the road or if you're you're going out you want to look your best you want to look the part and wherever you're going you want to do all of these things to protect yourself to look the part to to take care of your natural flesh but as much as we live we're only going to get older we're only going to have more ailments and sickness and trials and struggles and hurts and all of these things and eventually no matter how many times we're even healed divinely there'll be a day we'll pass to the other side that's just the laws of God but there's something that God's more focused on as much as the children of Israel had natural battles they had to take fleshly swords and Spears and all these things to fight and as long as there wasn't sin in the camp they never lost a man we're focused a different way God's perfecting not so much our natural bodies anymore not so much training for physical War but our spirit realm yes amen this body will be changed in the moment and the twinkling of an eye when the spirit is right because the soul was right it comes from the inside of the inside and it works its way out until this natural body that we spend too much time worried about changes in a moment so what we ought to focus on is God this land is a land of love and joy and peace and longsuffering and meekness and gentleness it's not so much a land of physical wealth and jobs and these things where am I focused and where it comes into my land where where what this natural world is affecting my love and joy and peace and anxiety and push it out push out the intakes build up the walls again guard yourself amen the children of Israel fought natural battles the bride fights spiritual battles we wrestle not against Ephesians 6 vers2 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God hallelujah so we have temptations lusts Prides these different things there's three great temptations that are given to any human the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life you can even follow that through the Temptations that Jesus went in the wilderness now these are the things that come at us these fleshly things these Temptations in our eyes and the pride of life the way that we can feel about ourselves and the the the motives and intent sometimes the Unseen hidden part sometimes you could we we might look the part and we might look as humble as we can but where's our heart what what's our motive what was my intent behind that what why do I want that what God cleanse us completely cleanse us truly God is working on a we have physical promises for physical healing he said the righteous will never be left begging bread or forsaken we we're taken care of naturally but God's truly focused truly focused on developing a spiritual character that's fit to rule the only thing that will take with us to the other side is our character and I don't want to say this in the wrong way but I'll add this and the souls that we bring with us those that are connected with us because we had a part in influencing them to make a choice that was eternal but truly what the only thing we take is our character amen brother brandham adoption number two and The Possession the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land but a spiritual land for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people called out elected chosen set aside all the world is dead on the outside we're led by the spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God not just by what we see not just our circumstances not our sickness not our symptoms not our family condition we're looking to something else not by man but by spirit and then he says all in love all bundled up the whole thing is bundled up now I want to get this to you that a man that is in Christ with the Holy Spirit can bear with a man when he's wrong long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always POS positive he's a different person this is a man walking in the land this is a man that I'm not but I want to be I want to be that kind of man we want to be that kind of woman that kind of child that kind of I want to read this again I want to get this to you that a man that's in Christ with the Holy Ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong doesn't mean he accepts the wrong doesn't just pet it either but but he can bear with the man longsuffering he can go a mile with that man and try to work with him to to to to help his Soul bear with a man when he's wrong long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person now I can't do this in my humanity and neither can you but we have a great God we have a great God so our land is a spiritual land now the land the promised land was not a type of Heaven brother brandham would lay this out the reason was there was a lot of fighting there they won't be fighting in heaven the land that we had to go to there they had to fight for every inch of ground the soles of their feet was possession but they had to go fight that amalekite and perizzite and and and and and hittite and Amorite they had to push back anxiety we have to and doubt and fear and cancer and sickness and all of these doubts and fears these are different names of enemies that are pushing back on our borders of the land but the reason it didn't type heaven was there was fighting there yeah so I'll say this if you want peace today you'll have to fight for it and if you want your joy back today you'll have to fight for it it's an odd concept I just want to relax and have no stress and I want to have peace no no no you have to get into Christ but then begin to turn your eyes to the word of God not to the Comforts of this day and you'll find perfect peace brother Brandon would talk about perfect Faith the Bible talk perfect love or brother Brandon and there's also perfect peace laid out in the B I want to live in all three perfect love perfect peace but if you want it you'll have to fight for it we'll have to pick up our sword and and begin to lay out and say I want that that's mine that's my inheritance amen now how do we get into that land brother Brandon would talk if you want to know how to get into Christ Jesus you'll have to turn to 1 Corinthians 12 for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body it's not a denomination we know these things it's not just a feeling or a sensation or or tongues or all of these things it's to be baptized in the body of Christ it isn't good enough to just listen to the tapes it isn't good enough just to come to church and hear a preacher it isn't good enough just to be raised in the message you have to be born again by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body our possession our land that God give us to live in the Holy Ghost now we have different needs that can come this morning and I'll dwell in and there's different things that we've seen last year that just have led me or brought me to some of these thoughts I guess and different things I guess as you study too but we can have health conditions we can have Financial conditions we can have great family needs it seems that there's crisis at all levels more and more and more we can have a battle in our mind and perhaps that's the greatest battle of our day even mental health conditions and different things that come now the the greatest battle ever fought is in our mind so if something goes there we shouldn't be surprised but that's where the battle is fought so when weakness comes and When Trials come and even when it's just you can't even you wouldn't even know it to look at someone but they're going through a raging battle or we are crowd of people and you can be going through a mind battle like nothing else you're not insane you're not crazy you're not different you're you're just human the devil has every right to send every thought he sends your way he's on base he's allowed whatever wacky thought you get perverse wild negative down this that the other fearful he has every right God allowed him to it and you have every right to kick him out again and say that's my land he has every right to do we shouldn't think it's strange we're we're just human he has every right to see what sticks he doesn't know even what you thought for sure B until he sees your reaction which way you choose which way you go kick him out again oh learn to smile through your fears that song would say learn to smile through your fears no matter what the devil throws push him back again we're not made to be a punching bag for the devil where he just comes and beats and beats and we just take it for an hour and no we're Christians we're Christians we're coming into the land we're learning that this is a spiritual battle not just the natural battle and we're learning how to fight I I believe that now I want say this I believe that our mind is a part of our Christian inheritance as a part of the land of the Holy Ghost I believe that we can have apart from fear we can have a sound mind Timothy would say that's our inheritance in our mind so many things build up there's complexes they take a while to tear down but they can be torn down complexes fears anxieties lusts depressions condemnation I believe that a name of a devil of today is called condemnation God uses conviction to bring you to him the devil sends out a devil named condemnation to slow you down and to feel like you're worthless and you're nothing it's a devil that heavy oppressive feeling of gross worthless that is only a devil if we could see into the spirit realm it's something hanging over you telling you things that are lies it's not real tempers different things Satan spends a lot of time flinging thoughts at us just to see what will stick and stay and what will mature into something else now the reason why it's important to guard our borders at the edges is because when you let a little Amorite in and it grows up for a while it becomes a great big ugly sin in short you take go to the go to your nearest jail picked the worst guy there the worst girl there it what they did whatever horrific thing was done started with a thought somewhere and it probably looked Innocent but they dwelt on it and they worked worshiped it and they went a little farther and a little sin will take you farther and then farther the maturing of a thought can be an ugly thing but what about the maturing of the thoughts of God we're facing a year with Darkness and Light brother bradam would say the new year but what about the light let the light shine in our lives let those little thoughts let the meditations of my mind and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God let it be that I would turn my eyes turn my mind when the negative comes I turn to the positive begin to let that grow what happens when you have a fully adopted son of God not some man in a jail cell but a fully adopted son of God speaking the word of God oh my our mind is our inheritance now brother brandham says You must first find the will of God before you can do the will of God you must know what the will of God is in the matter then don't turn it loose perseverance so our mind is it the will of God to have a sound mind that's it's a good question CU if it is in the word we can stand on it first 2 Timothy 1:7 I'll move through these quick for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Romans 8:15 you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry ABA father 1 Corinthians 10:13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man you're not the only one but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able but with Will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear It 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought Hall every thought amen oh but I just have this one little thought that I dwell every thought greatest battle ever fought Satan's Army brings diseases and God's Army is commissioned to cast them out amen that covers the mind the soul the disease of the soul the spirit every part of our body not just our physical body but all the way through we can have a sinick soul full of unbelief the chiefest of devils brother Brandon would say the worst devil was unbelief the one that would directly combat with faith every part of our bod Satan's Army brings diseases God's Army is commissioned to cast them out again there you are every time Satan throws anything Onto You God's Army is to cast them out God's method is to cast out the devil cast down reasoning cast down superstitions cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin you're above it amen resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in Heavenly places with every devil under your foot now I'll slow down in for a moment but brother Brandon would say in Satan's Eden but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind in these scriptures I've got written here that would Enlighten you to know how to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemies so that you can block everything before it gets to you that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can amen it's not so much if if if I was a boxer and I wouldn't maybe make a very good one but if I was a boxer the best technique would not be to learn how to take as many hits as you could and be able to keep getting up it'd be learn how to duck how to block how to stop it so that it wouldn't hold your strength back so that you could come with as much strength as you'd always have when you're coming in for that punch brother Brandon was saying this the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you in another place he would say it's not how long you can make the battle link linger kick him out immediately amen when that first thought comes cast it down right there amen don't let it linger it only gets harder to kick out that's right so we have to learn but we learn our own Humanity we have to learn how we're wired and the way that God made us in our own wonderful way and sometimes our worst enemy well it is ourself we learn that's my weakness there's my strength that doesn't bother me so much but that bothers me and this area bothers me and this sometimes when this happens and then this and then that I go into this downward spiral of anxiety or fear or depression or it's something that'll start and then we go down down and but if we can learn that moment that trigger that something and say I want to keep the punches off of me now we can look I want to make a statement I hope this is okay we could look to psychology but I want to say this the greatest thing that we ever need is the Bible now I want to make that clear how I could say this brother brandham gave us the best psychology lessons we could ask for what do you mean by that have you ever had a scientist or psychologist or someone tell us that the spirit realm included memory imagination conscience affections and reasons psychology goes down their path brother Bram went to the word of God and by divine inspiration brought what we needed to overcome in the mental Realms today I believe that now he was I I'll say the greatest psychologist because I I would say I would want to take someone that's of the word of God and of the Lord now what he laid out was not just psychology what he laid out was this is the channels of influence that we can be overcome or or or taken by in the message of the greatest battle ever fought and he laid out these Spirit realm things these channels and these inlets now some some ideas some scientists they might have good ideas and that's fine but where ultimate truth lies will go back to the prophet and the message in the Bible and he laid out these things in the Bible so we don't have to look to these other places so much there can be a place for medical help even there can be a place for God to use doctors at all levels I do believe that I do believe that but truth comes from this when a devil's cast out we're good to go when a devil comes now there could be a place where God uses different channels don't get me wrong but God's laid out these truths in the message of the hour by a prophet that said your memory your imagination your conscience your affections your reasons is the realm that psychological realm that Satan will even try to get to how do we keep him out how do we keep him out the battles that we Face they go beyond just our Physical Realm but they're going into our spirit realm more and more and they're trying to get to the soul that's the goal now let us look for a few minutes this great sinful day that we're now living in I don't believe still Satan's Eden there was ever a day that I've ever read in history there's been greater days of persecution with the children of God was put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like we're living in now it's the most cunning deceitful day and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toe than in any age amen yes now our borders are important the place that when Israel had their land they were given these borders from from the Great River to the river Euphrates and the or for the river Euphrates I think it was the Great River but Genesis chapter 15 18 would say in the same day that the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land he gave the border from the river of Egypt I believe the Nile unto the Great River the river Euphrates in Exodus 23:31 and I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines and from the desert unto the river for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and you shall drive them out from before thee and he began to talk about this land there's other scriptures that he would lay out the borders of the land from this River to the sea to the different places this is your land now to go outside of it I'm not there with you that that's not that's not but but to be in the land now part of it was even Egypt the Egyptian border and then the Euphrates which was kind of in and around Babylon and I'll say many times we're in between what feels like the world and the world the world and babyon and we're surrounded by these things that are pressing in on us all the time on all levels on all fronts Even in our spirit realm the thoughts and things that come at us but we're given our land peace is Our Land Joy Is Our Land the Holy Ghost is Our Land now now the fog of War and the press that we feel the darkness that comes we we we the enemy will try to do one of two things it feels like often and brother Ed would say this back home but either he'll either get us so I I'll say condemned and beaten up but he'll get us so slowed down and stopped and too afraid to move or he'll get us moving too fast too quick and that we get out of position and that we run run ahead running so fast that we're running tripping over oursel there's a place in the middle how many's ever had that where you're pushed you realize oh I got out of the will of God I got moving too fast I didn't pray I didn't do my part or I got so condemned and so fear and so everything that that I couldn't move at all and that wasn't right either one way or another he's trying to knock us off balance brother Brandon would say just following down this thought God says this church of the leodan age is wretched I believe this is leodan in church age that word comes from two Greek words which means endure and trial and it has nothing to do with the trials of a true Christian for the trials that God describes that come to a true Christian that God describes a Christian in trial as blessed but this is wretched it's a different kind of trial his attitude is one of Joy the Christian whereas this description is wretched and miserable the leoan age how strange he says in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of Plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there's so much more to be had when all the inventions to do our work and so much should give us pleasure suddenly he says we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation now I don't know when this book was released in 1965 that the words mental illness have the same impact in weight that they do in 2024 but a prophet is a prophet and he used those words I'll say even in a prophetic form because in 1965 life was pretty easy still comparatively but the world was to get so dark and this message was to get only more true and more dialed into the truth he would say this suddenly in this age there's mental illness there's God's Prophet telling us a little bit of what we need to know for that realm he would say mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol and now we faced some of these things I can think of just different things other places the things that are faced in the crisis and the trial among Christians that want to serve God the Battle Is Real but God's more real yet this yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it's more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its science and knowledge and science but it's fighting a losing battle on all all fields for the human mind and soul and not and spirit cannot keep a breath cannot comprehend or keep a breast with all the changes that have come upon the Earth in one generation we've gone all the way from the horse and buggy to the space age and now we've gone all the way from a space age to even they call it space Warfare where there was a missile shot way above an outer space above Israel from Yemen and the first time that something had happened all the way to Ai and all these things that we can't stay on top of it boasts about it in we are proud and boastful about it but inside is a Dark Void C that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics so if we see it it's not strange it's all in the message it boasts but it cannot back up this age it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has a multitude an amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my God to the wicked but I'm so glad in Isaiah chapter 9:6 it says unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace our Prince of Peace amen oh he's the dissolver all doubts this is another realm that we we often don't recognize that other realm until we're right in the middle of it but we're fighting a spiritual battle but we've got a sword we've got a spear we've got faith we've got our helmet of salvation we've got what we need to take to overcome so let's take the word of God all the things that we've been taught all of our lives and begin to pick up the sword and say I want to go slay a giant and I want to go take my land I want to guard my borders I don't want to go and now we'll turn it around the message Shalom he says let's turn it back around gross darkness is upon the people but what about the light he says gross Darkness would be upon the people but there would be light Rise and Shine for the light has come How can there be Darkness and Light he says it's got to be separated and the only one thing that separates it manifested separates it it presses it to the other side now when you've got a dark room and the lights are out and if we blacked out all the windows as soon as you turn on a light that Darkness has to start to scatter it is not powerful enough for the smallest candle light it is not powerful enough the the gates of hell are not powerful enough for just that little bit of God's light that would shine in your heart and begin to send out and press the darkness back it presses it back to the other side I say to the church brother Brandon would say that's what the that's what's taking place darkness is separating itself from the light now to the elected Church in this Dark Hour which we could stay on that for hours he says but you understand what that I trust have said enough to understand what that means gross Darkness upon the people now I say to the church he says Shalom God's peace every true Hebrew when he meets another one Shalom good morning God be with you God's peace go with you it's a good morning it's a breaking day Christ is appearing among us and then he would he would say in that in those messages we're facing the new year with Darkness and Light but there's light now the land that were in in I hope this is okay am the land that we're in that we're possessing is a land of it is a land as much as there's fighting and fighting for your peace it's a land of rest it was the land of Sabbath you could say Shabbat it was a land of rest it was the type that we have of rest in the Holy Ghost because we're living out the antitype now it's not just a day it's not just a holy day it's a land of rest in the Holy Ghost now that word shalom means peace and I I love the meaning of the word Shalom it means peace completeness think about the mental battles and mind and even Health even physical health what is it when you're complete that you're at peace there's nothing lacking you're healed you're whole it says Shalom peace completeness welfare Health it's a common semetic root with the meaning peace and in these different languages it was an important term in the Old Testament this is just from kind of a dictionary type thing and has maintained its place in different places in Israel today people greet the newcomer and each other with the words M Shalom or what is your peace how are you doing how are you doing they ask about the peace or well-being of one's family now I would ask who is your peace this morning the word Shalom is derived from the the root derived from a root meaning wholeness oh that's a beautiful word made perfect now the word even in the new test often that we'd have we must come to Perfection what that means is not sinless Perfection it means completeness maturity a place of wholeness a place that we're there to be complete sound shalam a version of the word Shalom to be complete sound Gideon would would come and be hiding from the from the Philistines maybe it was and he would be hiding under that wine press making whatever he was all doing threshing wheat is what he was doing all of that situation would happen when that that angel would meet him and they would touch the sacrifice that whole interaction he'd be sent out to go fight and he would call that place even though he'd need a fleece even though he'd need another fleece even though he'd need a dream even though all of these things would come and he would seem to have a lot of fear that starting place he would called Jehovah Shalom God sent him out Jehovah Shalom now the earliest references to Jerusalem the name Jerusalem are found in the ancient Egyptian texts from such and such BC their names their name appears as Ral and the Egyptian it goes on there's there in an Egyptian vessel in Jerusalem sent a letter of allegiance to Pharaoh so and so from Jerusalem it was the other word another word for Jerusalem these older times now it's possible it would say that the name had a compound name derived from proper name I I'm I'm reading this too quick but Jerusalem Jerusalem it's derived iived from that word shalom jerus shalom Jerusalem brother brandham would say brother I'll take what a prophet says in thirst notice Jerusalem the word Jerusalem is from above the Bible said the mother of us all Christ is our mother we realize that God as our mother we're born of him the word simply means peace Jerusalem Shalom or Shalom which means jerus then he says Jerusalem who was the king mzc he was the king of Salem the king of peace king of Shalom he was the king of this city who's that City tonight or this morning Solomon I'll just point out a couple of things but Solomon David couldn't build the city that that great Tabernacle that he was supposed to build but Solomon could Solomon's name was even derived Solomon peaceful the builder of the temple it was it was very much derived from the Solomon's name is said to have derived from Shalom translated as P shomon Solomon he could build the city David couldn't he was the right kind of man he was a peaceful man a man that could come brother bradam would say shalom peace don't be weary Jesus is here amen his great light has come to us and we're thankful for it yes his word the great mystery here he is today manifesting himself doing the same thing as he did then just the same doing the very same thing we're creatures of time he's God of Eternity we're trying to press oursel to make oursel do something oh this has got to be done remember he knows all about it it's going to happen it's going to happen anyhow we try to get in our own Humanity what we need to do in different things that come get into Christ let him lead the way our own self will make the biggest mess out of any situation but when God comes and leads us to the path leads us to the answer leads us to uh to whatever would be uncovered or whatever would need to be done now God can move brother brandham Ephesian Church age have you ever studied the history of revivals now a Revival signifies a move of God in power and every time God moves Satan is there to move also he says it never fails in the days of the great Welsh Revival he said says in the days of the great Welsh Revival and most people don't know us the insane asylums filled up quickly and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God to try to turn your eyes to the symptoms the struggles he says to take your eyes away from God it's written that in Wesley's day the people would do the most peculiar things that were definitely of Satan to try to mock the goodness and power of God in Luther's day it was said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested Ed the Roman Catholic church but the miracle lay in the fact that he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the Fanatics who are often filled and guided by wrong Spirits oh my if you have been aware of this last day Ministry you'll have noted the same invasion of false and wicked Spirits it has to be that way I hope and trust you're spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it when it comes let God move it's not he pointed it out years ago it happened in the Welsh Revival it happened all around but now as the Press comes let's keep moving forward and look to what God can have for freedom amen the battles we're seeing should not be a surprise but we're meant to fight for our peace to fight for our land I'm going to drop down to a thought but now I'm going to drop in on the thought that I've had the borders the place that we have to protect now the Bible would say this in Proverbs I'm dropping down I probably past some scriptures that I've given but Proverbs chapter 25 verse 28 a a really interesting scripture I'll just say maybe I get interested by things but it says something that is quite striking now we know that we have a soul then a spirit then a body and and and so the spirit realm is that that mind realm it's the channel that passes through the word of God has to come through our flesh and then we we begin to receive it through our memory or different through the channels you could say you want to open channels for God and close channels for the devil and then the Soul now Proverbs chapter 25: 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls so I'll say no Borders or a city now a city a city in the Old Testament or in old times if a city didn't have great big walls it wasn't much of a city cuz anyone could walk in and they could take it over they said that when when cities were built there was people a Jour journalist or something talking about when cities were built that was when actually men were not only ever fighting only for war all the time but because walls started to be built they could focus on like arts and culture and all these other intellectual things because they weren't all day every day training for someone to come out of the bushes into their City when the walls were put up they could relax a little bit and they could focus and come to a higher level of human if you want to say it that way walls are so important in the in in in history they would talk walls have traditionally been built for defense privacy to protect the people from a certain region or influence even protect perceived danger posed by Outsiders walls of different cultures serve this primary purpose all serve this primary purpose but were constructed in various ways different diverse materials the oldest walls found in existence so far are those of the Temple of the gockley temple Tempe in Ura Southeast turkey dating back 11,500 years they say but they're wrong City walls we only we know the world's not that old city walls which become common for per purposes of Defense are first seen around the walls of the city of Jericho they say this is history even now in the West Bank around the 10th C Century BCE in the Sumerian city they go on in history walls they even talk about um they talk about uh the credit of transforming the city they would talk about even and Nebuchadnezzar and different things the impressive walls um walls are so important when when a city was built you needed a good set of walls Jericho's walls were thick and they were big and there was walls that you could race chariots around I think it was in Babylon walls were key and I'll say in our land the borders and the border security that we put up is key to what comes in and out some things are good to come in the word of God the promises of God but he that that's without the Bible says he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that's broken down and Without Walls brother brandom greatest battle ever fought when the great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and the battle to rage uh paragraph 68 and that Battlegrounds begins in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it begin because decisions are made from the mind the head never started with some organization mechanical Affair will go on but you've got to make your choice it meets you this morning the walls that we construct the walls that we have what breaches our walls what do we find in our Christian walk that comes against us and in our spirit realm it leeches in it sneaks through a crack in the wall or it it comes through a spot that would that would allow the enemy to come in I believe in in Daniel's time I believe it was uh I can't remember which king it was but the handwriting was put on the wall and then the enemies had come and they actually stopped the flow of the river that was going underneath the wall and they slipped under the wall and they took over Babylon at the time or the mes and Persians whatever it was with that handwriting that story they stopped it up and they slipped under the walls where's that place that we have to keep guarded walls they all have that that walls as noted have always served the same basic purpose this is just history or something and and at the same time have always shared the same weakness anyone who really wants to get around a wall will find a way to tunnel under go over or walk around one the Great Wall of China was initially useless in stopping the NAD nomadic Calvary of this area only became a formidable structure it is today many centuries lat later but they could walk around it basically if I understand it right although there there was a wall in ER that was easily breached by the elamites by simply walking around it and Hadrian's Wall did little to stop illegal immigration as im as evidenced by such and such walls are as good as we allow them to be the walls that we put up even in terms of every wall around the city of say Jerusalem there was different Gates the Sheep gate the Water Gate these different Gates these were the entry and exit places see taste feel smell hear memory imagination conscience these were the places that things could come in and things could go out and the choice that you make allowed what was your border security now I'll say this we get so concerned about our natural diet what we eat and what we don't eat what we're allergic to what we're not allergic to what will be good the supplements all the things if we spent the same amount of time on our spiritual diets on what we allow in and what we don't allow in and what we feeds us and what doesn't what we learn is we're allergic to and it causes a sinful reaction or or something wrong reaction if we had that same attention to our spiritual diet oh what a different people we ought to be our our bodily exercise bodily things profit a bit that's good but there's something that's deeper because we're not in a natural battle we're in a spiritual battle what we eat what we avoid eating what gives us a spiritual stomach ache what what leads us to be a deeper stronger Christian let's close up the gates and look for the holes in our walls yes now the Berlin Wall I don't know I I wasn't old enough to quite remember it but the Berlin Wall came down in something like 1991 and it was a symbol of the Cold War and it was in Germany it separated East from West and it was kind of the Soviet Union controlled the one side and the American whatever group controlled the other side and it was this symbol of the communism of the day on that side and Western democracy on the other side and you know we could go into all that but that doesn't matter a whole lot other than to say this a wall in the middle of a city is really useless a wall around a city is great but a wall in the middle of the city kept families apart kept friends apart kept kin apart kept the natural connections that were supposed to be made in the confines of a city apart because of this ugly wall and we can have them in our minds as well we want walls around our minds but we don't want the complexes and fears and walls in our minds that stop us from living in Liberty stop us from living in peace stop us from our family or negative thoughts or things that come there was that time that wall came down it was it was a strange series of events but there was a time where that wall was breached and even at there was a New Year's concert that was sung in that place and some guy was up in a crane singing Looking For Freedom and the song was saying but he couldn't find it but I can say this morning that wall can come down in your mind in your heart whatever would be that something that holds you back that you bump up against that fear that temper anxiety whatever ever would be you can say that wall is coming down the president of the United States tried to tell the president of Russia Mr gorbachov tear down the wall but but we can say House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ to the walls that hold us back we have no place to to be beaten down by the devil this is my land am I have a I have a right to live above anxiety and and fear and torment I have a right to live in a place of perfect peace with God I have a right to be sane and sound I have a right to overcome all sin all fear and every part of us hallelujah oh there's Freedom hereen the reality is now I'll just change gears the reality is though many times we find ourselves with broken walls on the outside or maybe a wall built up on the inside but that's not the end all we need to do is begin to rebuild the walls Nehemiah and erra were a part of building the Tabernacle or Temple and building the walls of Jerusalem again and it was a whole process they had to fight for it there was a whole study you could take in and Nehemiah and all the different things that were done but they had to rebuild the walls to make it a city again to make it a viable place to inhabit to make it a good mind to stay in again to make it a good mind to think in again to make it a good body to live in again to have joy and peace and that bright clear look in your eyes that Christian look in your eyes David I hope I'm not jumping around too much but David had a great sin he had let something come in the walls of his mind and he looked and he saw Beth Sheeba and he had done something wrong and Nathan comes and presents the case and and David prays this prayer in Psalms chapter 51 amen and he says something that's fascinating at the end that I don't know if I ever noticed until I'd started to look at these things I hadn't until I started to look at these things but a while ago but he he would say we know this prayer well have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity there's a man needing to rebuild the walls cleanse me from my sin I acknowledge my transgressions my sin is ever before oh just confess it if it's wrong just confess it I acknowledge it my sin is ever before me against thee and thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight verse 10 create in me a clean heart oh God renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation uphold thee me with thy free spirit verse 17 the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a broken and a contrite heart oh God thou Wilt not despise then he changes gears and an anointing must have struck him because he says this in that same chapter do good and thy good pleasure unto Zion build thou the walls of Jerusalem he says at the end of that prayer as he's winding down the prayer he says now do good and and thy great pleasure unto Zion build these walls back up again he says build thou the walls of Jerusalem I've had something torn down created in me a clean heart but now I need to rebuild I need something that'll be real and I need something that'll build up again a great wall oh I want that may that be our thing build thou the walls of Jerusalem amen now brother brandham there's your battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger it's stopping it right now build the walls set them up put at border security and he says God let none of them miss it it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door listens to your conscience affections reasons paragraph 111 greatest battle ever fought but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that he can't battle against that we know that that's true now how many remembers we'll turn to Isaiah just for the back Isaiah 26 verse one to three but how many remembers that song keep your mind State on me and I'll give you perfect peace how many knows that's a verse in Isaiah I'll keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee now it says that in verse three it says Thou wil keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in me but there's two verses in front that are beautiful that build the picture it says this Isaiah chapter 26 verse one in that day shall this song Be Sung in the land of Judah we have a strong City salvation will God appoint for walls and bullworks open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth maner in so point the walls the bullworks thou Wilt keep him in perfect peace because a city that's broken down without walls is like a man that has no rule over his Spirit but when a man has rule over his spirit it's like a city with walls and bullworks and it's a place where God can dwell because God wants to dwell in Zion God wants to dwell in us where his habitation it's a place that God can be comfortable and rest and we can rest with him Revelations 21 says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth who is that Jerusalem I'll ask who is that city of God where's that city that is and and I'll ask this who is the city and who's the walls of of your mind who's the walls who are the borders of your land who when you put the borders down and God said from this River to that River and and it's a land that we inhabit all the feet that we' every soul that we' I'm not saying it well but where the souls of our feet would tread would be our land and we begin to walk in love and in joy and in peace and in healing and in total victory over sin and in a place of perfect peace and perfect love perfect faith I know these are far off I I in some ways I need these I don't I want to live higher and higher and higher but we're striving predestinated to the adoption these are what we're predestinated to live in so we're aiming for it we're looking to it we're walking towards it now these borders these walls who's the city and and and who are the walls where can that be Revelations 21:1 it says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband how many knows that Zion types the bride that's us I believe I can say Jerusalem there's our part is there we we're represented there if I could say it that way and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God now I'll also say she is him so we're all together in this beautiful something that we have in this city but I can't keep my borders well you can't keep your borders well we're only human amen we can in our own best efforts we can try to protect ourselves and try to keep ourselves in the right thought and the right mindset and we can try to to fight and push and strive so often but so often we fall flat on our face and we let the wrong thing in or we're deceived or it comes underneath or we didn't notice it flying over top or or somehow it gets in any thought there Devil's allowed to fire any thought he he wants that that God allows him to at you that's his right but don't let it build a nesten how do I hold these borders how do I hold these walls I see that David said build the walls of Jerusalem I see that there's a place where from the sea to the river and all these things that are they're my land I see that these things are my land even a sound mind is my land but how do I keep the walls how do I keep the walls I wonder this will be our closing scripture if we could turn to the book of Zechariah I wonder if we could all turn to Zechariah 2: 1 how do I have walls that will hold back the enemy how do I stand there and say that I this is this is what I this is this is my land and it'll go no further where do I find the strength where do I find that something that will hold me and keep me and and and and and and let me walk in a place of freedom and liberty I Zechariah Chapter 2 now these walls are so important but this is fascinating Z Zechariah 2 vers1 I lifted up mine eyes again and looked and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand then said I with goest thou and he said unto me to measure Jerusalem to see what the breadth thereof and the length there I want to see what the borders of Jerusalem are he sent him out to measure the borders of Jerusalem and and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another Angel went out to meet him and said unto him run speak to this young man saying Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns Without Walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein for I saeth the Lord I will be unto her a wall of fire round about and I'll be the glory in the midst of her I'll say who is the walls of your mind it's not just so much the walls that we put up and the the best efforts that we can put it but he says I'll be a wall of fire around you and I'll be the glory in the midst of there oh this is where I want to live every day if I can live there stay there let the glory of God come and let Shalom come and rest and rain and he'll be that wall of fire oh there's nothing that can get through a pillar of fire blocking the way there's nothing that can come when when he's our helmet of salvation and peace oh God let us come and drive every doubt and fear back and every sickness and unbelief and whatever would come this is my mind this is my Mountain this is my land I want to live in it oh my you can say I'll just take this this way my place I say I can I found my place in the land this is my place in the land I found it I'm I'm the song leader I'm whatever I but but but your brother and sister have a place to find too your brother and sister have their place too so let's bind our faith together and not just fight for our place but go help our brothers and sisters fight for their place in the land you look at what you could say could I have faith to help someone else you can absolutely send your faith on the Battlefront with a little slingshot of Faith out you can do it what did hadti rright do she sent her her faith out she spoke the word and her faith wasn't just good enough for herself it was good enough for her two boys thy and thy house shall be saved look at what jeras did jus' daughter was dead you say faith comes by hearing amen but she was dead she couldn't even hear to believe I'll say is your son or daughter spiritually dead what what did jaras do he brought the need to Jesus anyway and Jesus could reach Beyond a dead situation and he could send Faith out on the Battlefront that's a part of your land you and your children will be saved what did that Aunt jamaa lady do that Aunt Jima lady had her her baby dying dead in a coma or dying and she applied Faith what's your need what's your cry oh we'll leave it for the moment but go look at Leviticus 25 and you'll see the law of a kinsman redeemer and what it was there was seven sabbaths seven sabbaths of Jubilee and on the 50th year they were free and those things but you could be sold into slavery and if you had the money you could buy yourself out of slavery or in the 50th year you could go free but it also says if your brother was sold into slavery and you were a near Kinsman a brother an uncle a near Kinsman how many's are part of the family of God today how many he's part of the family we're nearkin to each other he says if your brother is sold into slavery and you have the money to redeem him you can pay for his freedom you could appropriate the faith to add to his yes he had to accept his freedom or he'd be drilled through there's different parts to it but you can appropriate your faith for situations that are just beyond not just you eternal life is living for others dying for others going forward for others no matter what the crisis circumstance trial whatever we're facing up against today whatever when we say okay this is great but I leave Monday morning and it's going to be a battle amen let's go it's going to be a battle let's take Faith with us if it's for someone else I'm going to take it if it's for me I have the walls of my mind all covered by by fire I have the walls of my property my inheritance my borders are set my border security is better than any American border security I have the Lord Jesus Christ with me amen we're going and we're going forward we'll wind down with this Shalom maybe a couple quotes now the future he holds it 163 how do I know when he's coming when is he coming I don't know but he'll be here that's right when will he do thus and thus when will the curse go off the earth when will these blessed reflection of God love of God's love of trees standing there and Shining out in Flowers and Things when will they Immortal grow I don't know but they will when will all the reflection of men's Hearts Desiring to live in hospitals and doctors and operations crying in grief when will it all cease to a glorious reign with Jesus to A Thousand Years of Shalom when will it I don't know he said it would be there I don't know how he's going to do it but his spoken word will be a Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings and he says this he says and that healing part will not be a physical healing as you think as saying somebody's got a sickness and it'll be taken away from them that's what he's doing now in tight but the whole creature will be changed oh in Mother's Day in the message Mother's Day he says he talks about reaching in on that marriage supper of the Lamb reaching in in his fingers into your mind and just untangling all the knots of why did this happen and why did that happen and why could this but he'll just reach in and begin to take away all fear and all those tensions and things that we hold why would this have been and why did that be it'll be peace and clear on that day all tears wiped away from your eyes oh then this Mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump into youth amen how will it be I don't know but it will be there oh the message look 63428 paragraph 298 what are you looking at this morning what are you looking at did you stop and look in this hideous hectic day that we're living in what are you looking for if we can turn our eyes now to the one place that holds salvation look unto me all ye ends of the Earth and be ye saved sayeth the Lord if we can look we can live if we can look we can live the troubling of the water in Bethesda they kept looking and they kept looking and what maybe the first day wasn't their day but then their day came and sister hadri might have said that's nothing but the truth many times amen but there was a day Hallelujah was a day that was her day oh don't look at what you see how bad I'm crippled how sick I am what the doctor said now I'm going to change that don't look at what you see how bad they're crippled how sick they are or what the doctor said about them don't look at that look at the Unseen what God said before you feel any different before they look any different before the pain leaves before the hand moves before the eye can see one sight yet make ready for it's going to come it's going to come oh he says in your bosom it's going to come in your heart when God sets on the control Power now I get religious no matter how long it takes you keep on looking Gesa went out to look for that rain that they had no rain for three and a half years as we'd wi down they had no rain for three year three and a half years there was a curse on the land how many we've I wouldn't want to have no spiritual rain for three and a half years but we can live in those places of dry dry dry sometimes it's not even it's just a trial God even allows but there's a day when the rain is supposed to come there's a day when rain when day will break again there's the Night Comes but the morning comes also as much as there's Darkness there it only gets darkest until there's light and it only maybe you could say get the driest and then the rain's going to come too the spiritual rain of God but Elijah went up the mountain after that Mount Carmel show down and he sent gahaz up even higher whatever it would be to look keep looking and he would say do you see any sign of rain I God told me there'll be rain God told me I'll say God told us there'd be freedom God told us there'd be peace do you see any sign of it you see any he said I don't I I don't see he said go look again he said go look again he went back and looked and he looked and he saw he didn't see anything and so he went back and and Elijah said well go up there and look another time and he looked it says he looked seven times and then he went and looked on that seventh time and he saw a cloud the size of a man's hand and what if if if if Elijah would have been full of Doubt all he would have been like go that's it that's all after all this time that's it but he knew that was God he took God took the first move towards him and he took the first move right back towards God and what did he say he said I hear the sound of an abundance of rain oh he saw something now we've had Messengers that have gone out and looked we had a Paul went out and arenius went out these different Messengers have gone out take you to this day for a moment have went out and looked and they went and Paul had to go out and look and it wasn't the time yet for the this great reain that was to come and he went back and irenius went out and looked and these different ones went out Martin and Luther and all these ones went out and looked but there was a day when a messenger went forth and looked he stepped out and looked and what did he see oh he saw cloud in the sky that that said that there was an abundance of rain coming oh what we're looking for today I want to see the coming of the Lord in my flesh I want to see the coming of the Lord in my brother's flesh I want to see God move in ways he's never moved we're in the time and we're in the season Gesa went out he looked he saw the size of a man's hand I can say can can we can we say do we want to see an evidence that God's moving among us we can raise our hand you can look at it gravity would hold that hand down but if you just hold that hand up and say I've got needs I've got circumstances but I believe God I I see the size of a man's hand that's that's coming there's the faith that I need to say that little Grand feeling that comes up and says am I believe God I believe his word amen I believe that he's with us today musicians can come no matter how long it is keep on looking Hallelujah if the musicians would come if we can focus ourselves to the plan of God to what God wants for us and what God promised for us and let nothing else no matter how long it is go back and look again no matter how long it takes no matter how ugly it looks go back and look again God made the promise God made the word he said these things I didn't say it he said it I didn't say that I'm the Lord God that Health all thy diseases he said it I didn't say that that if the sun will make you free you shall be free indeed he said it that that that you have the power of over fear and of a sound mind he said it so I believe it and I believe it this morning oh God bless you may we all stand Hallelujah Turn Your Eyes On Jesus Oh Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
