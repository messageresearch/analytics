[22:16] from worshiping the Lord. You may have
[22:17] your seats tonight. I'm rejoicing night
[22:20] and day. Aren't you? Well, I'm rejoicing
[22:24] night and day as I walk the narrow way
[22:29] for the hand of God. In all my life, I
[22:33] see.
[22:35] Oh, for the reason of my bliss. Yes, the
[22:39] secret. All is this, that the comforter
[22:44] abides in me, the Holy Ghost himself.
[22:47] Oh, he abides.
[22:51] He abides.
[22:54] Oh, hallelu. He abides in me.
[23:00] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[23:04] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[23:08] abides in me.
[23:12] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[23:16] had no peace within till I heard how
[23:20] Jesus died on the tree.
[23:25] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[23:28] came a peace so sweet. Now the comfort
[23:33] abides in me.
[23:37] Oh he abides.
[23:40] He abides.
[23:43] Oh halleluah. He abides in me.
[23:49] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[23:53] walk this narrow way for the comforter
[23:57] abides in me.
[24:01] Oh, he is with me everywhere
[24:05] and he knows my every care. I'm as happy
[24:09] as a bird and just as free
[24:14] for the spirit has control. Jesus
[24:18] satisfies my soul since that comforter
[24:22] abides in me.
[24:26] Oh, he abides.
[24:29] He abides.
[24:32] Oh, hallelujah. He abides in me.
[24:38] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[24:42] walk this narrow way for the comfort of
[24:48] me.
[24:50] There's no thirsting for the things of
[24:54] this world. They've taken wings. Long
[24:57] ago I gave them up and instantly.
[25:02] All my night was turned to day. All my
[25:07] burdens rolled away now. The comforter
[25:11] abides in me.
[25:14] Oh yes, he abides.
[25:18] He abides.
[25:21] Oh hallelu, he abides in me.
[25:27] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[25:31] walk this narrow way. For the comfort
[25:35] abides in me. Oh yes, he abides.
[25:43] He abides.
[25:45] Oh hallelu, he abides in me.
[25:51] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[25:56] walk this narrow way. For the comforter
[26:00] abides in me.
[26:05] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. He
[26:07] abides in us. Blessed be his name. Based

[31:05] oh
[31:06] Lord.
[31:09] Lord, I give you my heart. Lord, I give
[31:14] you my soul.
[31:17] I live for you alone.
[31:22] Every breath that I take,
[31:26] every moment I'm awake,
[31:29] [Applause]
[31:31] Lord, have your way. Give me, Lord, I
[31:35] give. Lord, I give you my heart. Lord, I
[31:40] give you my soul.
[31:44] I live for you alone.
[31:49] Every breath that I take,
[31:53] every moment I'm awake,
[31:57] oh Lord, have your way in me. Stand with
[32:03] me if you would as we call our pastor.
[32:08] Let's start with a chorus.
[32:11] And I stand
[32:13] I stand
[32:16] in all of you.
[32:19] I stand
[32:21] I stand
[32:23] in all of you.
[32:26] Holy God to whom
[32:31] all praise is due. Lord, I stand in awe
[32:38] of you. Why do we tell our husband how
[32:40] we feel about him? Lord, you're
[32:42] beautiful beyond
[32:45] description.
[32:47] Lord, you're too marvelous
[32:52] for words.
[32:54] You're too wonderful for comprehension
[32:59] [Applause]
[33:02] like nothing ever seen or heard?
[33:08] Who can grasp your infinite wisdom?
[33:15] Who can fathom the depths of your love?
[33:22] For you are beautiful beyond
[33:26] description.
[33:28] Oh majesty

[33:35] Oh Lord and I stand. I stand

[33:43] My
[33:50] holy God
[33:52] to
[33:53] all praise is due. I stand in awe of
[34:01] you.
[34:03] Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[34:06] the house of the Lord. It's wonderful to
[34:09] be together in his presence. We know
[34:11] he's already here according to his word.
[34:14] And we know that he said that if you
[34:16] abide in me and my words abide in you,
[34:20] then ask what you will. If we have a
[34:23] need tonight, I believe he is more than
[34:25] able and and willing. He wants to give
[34:29] us our desires.
[34:31] And you know, brothers and sisters, we
[34:33] have planned these meetings for this
[34:35] weekend for a year. We've had a year of
[34:39] anticipation. And we've had a year of
[34:41] prayer, a year of setting aside this
[34:44] time to see what the Lord will do. I
[34:48] believe we're under great expectation
[34:50] this weekend. And we know that he is
[34:52] more than able. If you have a need
[34:55] tonight, if you have a desire in your
[34:57] heart, maybe not even just tonight, but
[35:00] from this weekend, commit it to the Lord
[35:03] tonight
[35:04] and just see if he won't come on the
[35:07] scene and meet your need. We know that
[35:09] he said in the book of Mal in Malachi to
[35:12] just prove him in these things. Just try
[35:15] him and see if he won't come on the
[35:17] scene. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[35:21] Gracious heavenly father, we're so
[35:24] honored, Lord, that we can still gather
[35:26] together this way that you've provided
[35:28] for us on this side of eternity. Lord,
[35:32] Father, I know the story that we talk
[35:34] about so many times where Gahiza was
[35:37] beside himself because of the enemy that
[35:39] was coming in, Lord, and he didn't know
[35:42] what to do. But because he was with your
[35:44] prophet and he had your word with him,
[35:47] the prophet was able to say, "Lord
[35:49] Jesus, just open his eyes." And Father,
[35:52] tonight I pray that you would just open
[35:54] our eyes, Lord. As this world grows so
[35:57] dim and evil around us, Father, we know
[36:00] that Lord, your word grows stronger and
[36:02] brighter in our lives, Father, your very
[36:05] life manifesting through your bride.
[36:08] Father, tonight we just want to ask,
[36:10] Lord, that you would come on the scene
[36:12] sovereignly, Lord, this weekend and that
[36:14] you would meet the needs in the hearts
[36:16] of your children because you said so,
[36:18] Lord.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, Father, we're so
[36:21] thankful that we could be here called
[36:23] according to your word to be here at the
[36:26] end of the Gentile dispensation to be
[36:29] the ones, Lord, that you have chosen,
[36:31] Lord, to manifest your life through.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Father, we don't take that lightly.
[36:37] Lord, we thank you that we can be those
[36:40] ones. It doesn't make us anything,
[36:42] Father. If anything, it humbles us
[36:43] because we recognize it's all your
[36:46] grace.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; We're just able to recognize it. And
[36:49] father that causes a reaction. Oh Lord
[36:52] Jesus, we can't sit still. We have to
[36:55] give you praise.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that desire. Lord,
[36:59] we just ask, Father, according to your
[37:01] word, that Lord Jesus, we know your word
[37:03] abides in us. And Father, we in you. And
[37:06] Lord, we just ask that you would
[37:08] sovereignly meet the needs in your
[37:09] hearts of your children tonight, Lord.
[37:11] Father, maybe in this service, maybe
[37:13] tomorrow, maybe over the course of the
[37:15] weekend, maybe through the the the
[37:17] conglomeration of the services, Lord,
[37:19] that something would be spoken, Lord.
[37:21] Something would happen that would
[37:22] trigger another level of your life in
[37:25] each and every one of our lives, Lord,
[37:27] that we would recognize who we are as
[37:29] our brothers already prayed. Because we
[37:31] know when that happens that truly the
[37:33] devil will be defeated. We know he's
[37:36] already defeated, but we need to
[37:37] recognize that for ourselves in our
[37:39] lives, Lord, for the battles that we
[37:41] fight. Father, one more time, we just
[37:43] want to ask that you would be with the
[37:45] Kirk family, Lord, in the United States.
[37:48] Lord,
[37:50] &gt;&gt; we know it's not right, but it's the age
[37:52] in which we live. And Father, we just
[37:55] are so thankful that you are more than
[37:57] able to to comfort the brokenhearted,
[37:59] Lord Jesus, in their time of need.
[38:02] Father, as we turn to you now, we just
[38:05] invite you, Father, to have the
[38:06] preeminence that you desire. Oh, Father,
[38:09] that we have been desiring, Lord, for a
[38:11] year now. That tonight, you would just
[38:14] speak to our hearts, Lord, that which we
[38:16] have need of. Father, we just want to
[38:19] ask that you would be glorified now and
[38:21] all that's said and done as we turn to
[38:22] your word, the highest part of the
[38:24] service. Father, we commit it now into
[38:26] your hands for your glory. In Jesus
[38:29] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[38:33] Amen. So thankful to have brother Andrew
[38:36] Glover here tonight. I think it was
[38:38] probably about three years ago I met him
[38:41] in in North Carolina and uh I heard he
[38:44] was an evangelist and I thought you know
[38:46] we just something said to me invite him
[38:49] here and uh it has not been a
[38:51] disappointment.
[38:53] He now resides in Black Rockck Arkansas
[38:56] just outside of Black Rockck. His home
[38:57] church is brother Matt Morose, I believe
[39:00] his last name is. And uh that's his
[39:02] pastor there in Arkansas. And Lord
[39:05] willing, one day maybe we'll go visit
[39:06] him there. But our brother's here, we're
[39:09] certainly happy to have him here.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; He is a vessel that the Lord can use to
[39:14] speak through. So if you go to pulling
[39:16] on the word, there's no telling what
[39:19] could happen here tonight.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; And uh I just want to sing that song. It
[39:24] just was on my heart. Come and dine as
[39:26] we invite brother Andrew to come
[39:28] tonight. We've had a full seven age
[39:31] chorus meal. It's wellaged. It's
[39:34] perfectly aged for us. Jesus has a table
[39:39] spread where the saints of God are fed.
[39:42] He invites his chosen people come and
[39:46] die.
[39:48] With his mana he does feed and supplies
[39:53] our every need. Oh sweetness up with
[39:57] Jesus all the time.
[40:00] Come and die the master call. Come and
[40:04] die
[40:08] at Jesus table all the time.
[40:13] He fed the multitude. He turned the
[40:16] water into wine.
[40:20] To the hungry calling out
[40:26] his disciples came to land. Thus made
[40:31] Christ command for the master called to
[40:34] them. Oh come he's still calling.
[40:38] They found their heart's desire. bread
[40:41] and fish upon the fire. Thus he
[40:45] satisfies the hungry every time.
[40:50] Come and find the master call and come
[40:53] and die.
[40:56] You make feast at Jesus table all the
[41:00] time.
[41:03] Let the multitude
[41:05] turn the water into wine.
[41:09] To the hungry calling out come and die.
[41:16] Soon the lamb will take his bride to be
[41:19] ever at his side. All the host of heaven
[41:24] will assemble me. They're there right
[41:26] now tonight. Amen.
[41:29] Hallelujah.
[41:30] all the saints his father's life and
[41:34] with Jesus we will feast eternally
[41:40] [Music]
[41:54] turn
[41:59] to the hungry. Call it now. Come and all
[42:03] this. Just sing it one more time. Oh,
[42:05] come and die.
[42:07] Call it come and die.
[42:10] Oh, you may feast at Jesus table all the
[42:14] time.
[42:17] He who fed multitude
[42:20] turn the water into wine.
[42:24] To the hungry calleth now. come and die.
[42:30] Amen. How many's come tonight to dine?
[42:33] Amen. There's one thing we know. The
[42:34] prophet of God told us what the gospel
[42:36] is. He said, you know, some make it a
[42:38] funeral procession. He said, then
[42:40] there's others that make it a frolic. He
[42:41] said, but the gospel is not a funeral
[42:43] procession. He said, it's not a frolic.
[42:45] He said, the gospel is a feast. And
[42:47] amen, I believe that's what we're doing
[42:48] here tonight is we're feeding on the
[42:50] unfailing realities of God. And Amen. I
[42:53] believe as we're feeding, we're getting
[42:54] stronger and stronger. And amen, the
[42:56] hold of the world is getting weaker and
[42:58] weaker. Amen. I I believe I believe it.
[43:01] Uh like this, we're just going to eat
[43:02] our way right out of this body into a
[43:04] new body. Amen. And we're going to be
[43:06] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[43:08] of an eye. Aren't you looking forward to
[43:10] that? Amen. There's nothing else in this
[43:12] world to look forward to. Amen. Outside
[43:14] of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:16] And amen. We want to say God bless you
[43:18] all tonight. It is a real honor to be
[43:20] here with you once again and good to see
[43:22] everyone out. We Amen. appreciate you
[43:23] making these efforts for these meetings
[43:25] and coming out on a Friday evening. I
[43:27] know there's a lot of things going on in
[43:28] the world, but amen, there's nothing
[43:30] more special to a believer than setting
[43:32] themselves aside and amen coming into
[43:34] the presence of the Lord. And amen, we
[43:36] want to just say it's a real honor to be
[43:38] here once again. We thank you, brother
[43:39] Barry, for this opportunity, invitation
[43:41] to come. And amen, to be here with
[43:43] brother Barry and his family and the
[43:44] assembly once again. Amen. I tell you,
[43:47] times like these are special. Amen.
[43:49] because they're they're more than just
[43:50] services, but they're uh they're
[43:52] festivals or their feast together in his
[43:54] presence. Amen. And we thank the Lord
[43:56] for that tonight. We want to bring you
[43:58] greetings from our church there at home
[43:59] by the Matt Morris and the saints at
[44:01] Grace Tabernacle there in Black Rockck,
[44:02] Arkansas send their greetings to you all
[44:04] tonight. So, we definitely want to do
[44:06] that. And maybe before we open the word,
[44:07] we could just bow our hearts. Amen. For
[44:09] a word of prayer. Amen. We've come
[44:11] tonight to start these meetings. Amen.
[44:13] We feel the the charge of expectation
[44:17] &gt;&gt; and intens anticipation. Amen. In the
[44:19] sanctuary tonight, I wonder how many
[44:21] would just say, "Lord, come by my way
[44:23] tonight and move me aside. Move my
[44:25] thoughts aside. And Lord, I don't want
[44:27] to hear from a man. I want to hear from
[44:29] you." I wonder how many would just join
[44:31] with me tonight in that realm of faith
[44:33] and believing God as we approach him
[44:35] tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your
[44:38] believers have gathered here on this
[44:39] Friday evening, Father, Lord, to the
[44:41] world it would be foolish, Lord, it
[44:43] would be silly, Father. Lord, together
[44:45] in the house of God on a Friday evening,
[44:48] but Lord, your word said where the
[44:50] carcass is there, the eagles will be
[44:51] gathered together. And Lord, your same
[44:54] anointing moved upon Apostle Paul one
[44:56] day, and he said to forsake not the
[44:58] assembling of yourselves together. And
[45:00] Lord, he would even say that much more
[45:02] as we see the day approaching. Now Lord,
[45:04] we've not come here for just another
[45:06] service, Lord. We've not gathered here
[45:08] this weekend for just another set of
[45:10] meetings, Father. But Lord, we've
[45:12] gathered here for another Emmas road
[45:14] walk, Lord. We've gathered here to hear
[45:16] from our theophanes, Lord. Father, we've
[45:19] not come to be seen or to be heard, but
[45:21] oh God, we've come to worship you, Lord,
[45:23] to break out of the sensebound realm
[45:25] into that realm where all things are
[45:27] possible. And Lord, you see every
[45:28] believer that's here, every hand that
[45:30] has been raised, oh God. And Lord,
[45:32] behind that hand, there is a need. And
[45:34] I, Lord, as a man, have no way to
[45:36] minister to each and every need of your
[45:38] children. But Lord, I have confidence in
[45:40] your great anointing that if you will
[45:42] fill this room, Lord, with your shakina
[45:44] glory. And Lord, I'll get myself out of
[45:46] the way and become an instrument into
[45:48] your hand, Lord, that Father, you'll
[45:50] move throughout the congregation of
[45:52] believers. And Lord, you'll heal the
[45:53] sick bodies.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you'll fill the empty vessels,
[45:57] oh God. You'll break the chains of the
[45:59] enemy that would hold the children of
[46:01] God. Lord, I pray if there be one
[46:03] believer's faith that is paralyzed here
[46:05] tonight, Father, Lord, I pray there
[46:07] would come a resurrection to that faith
[46:08] tonight. And Lord, I pray that you would
[46:10] forgive us of our failures, Lord.
[46:12] Forgive us of our shortcomings. And
[46:14] Lord, as we endeavor to look into your
[46:15] word, may you send the spirit of wisdom
[46:17] and revelation into the building. And
[46:19] Lord, we'll be sure to give thee all the
[46:21] praise, all the honor, and all the glory
[46:23] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[46:26] Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And all
[46:29] the believers says, "Amen." Amen. And
[46:31] amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[46:33] we want to invite you uh in the
[46:35] scripture to the book of Job, the 19th
[46:37] chapter. We're going to look here in Job
[46:39] chapter 19. And then we're also going to
[46:41] look in the book of Proverbs 29 and also
[46:43] 1 Peter chapter 1. Amen. We have just a
[46:46] few places we want to read here tonight.
[46:48] Amen. Beginning in Job chapter 19
[46:51] and verse number uh 23. This is not a
[46:54] unfamiliar scripture to the believers.
[46:56] In Job chapter 29 or chapter 19 rather
[47:00] in verse 23 uh Job here is writing and
[47:03] he says oh that my words were now
[47:05] written. Oh that they were printed in a
[47:08] book that they were graven with an iron
[47:10] pen and led in the rock forever. For I
[47:14] know that my redeemer liveth. I I love
[47:17] Job's authority there. For I know that
[47:20] my redeemer liveth. One translation says
[47:22] my redeemer and my vindicator. I know
[47:25] that my redeemer liveth and that he
[47:27] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[47:31] earth. And now watch this. And though
[47:33] after my then after my skin worms
[47:36] destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
[47:40] I see God,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; whom I shall see for myself, and mine
[47:44] eyes shall behold and not another. Look
[47:47] here, though my reigns be consumed
[47:50] within me. Also in the book of Proverbs,
[47:52] the 29th chapter, Proverbs 29.
[47:56] It's a it's a very very familiar
[47:58] scripture. It's probably uh it's
[48:00] probably one of my favorite scriptures
[48:01] in the Bible. Proverbs 29:18.
[48:04] Uh the Bible here speaking Solomon
[48:06] writing in Proverbs 29:18. And he says,
[48:09] "Now where there is no vision, the
[48:13] people perish." Yes.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Now that word vision where there is no
[48:16] revelation of God and his word. So where
[48:20] there is no revelation where there is no
[48:22] revelation of God no revelation of his
[48:24] word the people perish. But he that
[48:27] keepeth the law happy is he.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And one other place in first Peter
[48:34] chapter 1. 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse
[48:37] number eight. Amen. 1 Peter chapter 1
[48:41] and verse number eight. uh Peter here
[48:44] writing in the New Testament.
[48:46] He says, "Whoming whom having not seen
[48:49] yet love in whom though now ye see him
[48:52] not yet believing ye rejoice with the
[48:56] joy unspeakable and full of glory. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Receive in the end of your faith, even
[49:02] the salvation of your souls, of which
[49:05] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[49:07] searched diligently, who prophesied of
[49:10] the grace that should come unto you.
[49:13] Now, how many knows the prophet of God
[49:15] said you're a prophetic class of people.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; So, if you're a prophetic class of
[49:19] people following a prophetic word, that
[49:22] means that you have to have a prophetic
[49:24] grace.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; So, this is not any kind of grace. This
[49:27] is a prophesied grace. Look at verse 11.
[49:30] Searching what or what manner of time
[49:32] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[49:35] did signify when it testified beforehand
[49:39] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[49:41] that should follow. And whom unto whom
[49:44] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[49:47] but unto us they did minister these
[49:50] things. You imagine ministering
[49:52] something and you couldn't even
[49:53] understand it. They ministered these
[49:55] things, but it was not revealed unto
[49:57] them, which are now reported unto you by
[49:59] them that have preached the gospel unto
[50:02] you with the Holy Ghost, sent down from
[50:05] heaven, which things the angels desire
[50:09] to look into. Wherefore gird up the
[50:12] loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
[50:15] to the end for the grace that is to be
[50:17] brought unto you at the revelation of
[50:21] Jesus Christ. Amen. We ask the Lord this
[50:23] evening to bless the reading of his word
[50:25] as you can have your seats here this
[50:26] evening. If the Lord would help me
[50:28] tonight and I would uh take a title to
[50:30] speak to you here on something for a few
[50:32] moments. I want to title it this
[50:33] tonight. We have a vindicated forecast.
[50:37] Amen. We have a vindicated forecast. I
[50:40] want to maybe share with you here first
[50:42] Peter chapter 1 and verse number 13 from
[50:45] the amplified Bible. It says, "So
[50:47] prepare your minds for action. Be
[50:50] completely sober in spirit. steadfast,
[50:53] self-disciplined, spiritually and
[50:55] morally alert. Amen. I like that.
[50:57] Spiritually and morally alert. Fix your
[51:00] hope completely on the grace of God that
[51:03] is coming to you when Jesus Christ is
[51:07] revealed. Amen. I I believe tonight that
[51:09] we can say with a 100% assurance in our
[51:12] hearts that Jesus Christ has been
[51:15] revealed in this generation. Now uh I
[51:18] just want to read a quote and it's a bit
[51:19] lengthy but if you'll just give me a few
[51:21] moments here in 1955 and my redeemer
[51:23] liveth brother said I think of Job. He's
[51:26] the one that we're reading of a few
[51:27] moments ago. He said Job looked forward
[51:30] to this morning when he was old. He was
[51:33] stricken in age and his flesh was simply
[51:35] falling from his body from sores. His
[51:38] heart amen was broken in grief and every
[51:41] mortal part of his being amen was
[51:44] withering away. I want you to notice
[51:46] this. Every part of his being was
[51:48] withering away. He was at his wit's end.
[51:50] Everything was gone seemingly. Amen. His
[51:53] body was gone. His property was gone.
[51:55] Amen. His children was gone. All that he
[51:58] had was gone. He said, "But then God in
[52:01] his mercy come down to Job." Amen. And
[52:04] he give him another sense. Isn't that
[52:06] something? Amen. That here's Job at his
[52:08] end of mortality. Amen. But then God,
[52:11] the immortal God, the infinite God,
[52:14] Amen, would come down to Job and would
[52:16] give him another sense that he could
[52:18] open his eyes and he could see. Amen.
[52:21] The day that there would be a body he
[52:24] would receive. Now look here. Job had
[52:26] more than just I hope so. Amen. I have a
[52:29] feeling there will be. He said, but Job
[52:31] had a positive. He he said, I know that
[52:34] my redeemer liveth. The positive side of
[52:36] it. Amen. No more in the negative. It's
[52:40] all positive. And if today we only have
[52:42] a cross on top of the church, amen.
[52:44] Amen. To show that if that that we
[52:46] believe in Christ's death and burial and
[52:48] resurrection, if we only have a few dead
[52:51] bodies laying underneath the church that
[52:53] some of the saintly people were buried
[52:55] in. Amen. We only have that as a hope.
[52:58] Amen. Then we are among all men most
[53:00] miserable. He said, "But today, amen. We
[53:04] don't have the dead bodies." Amen. that
[53:06] we have the resurrected spirit of the
[53:08] Lord Jesus Christ that he has rose from
[53:11] the dead triumphant. It's not no more I
[53:14] guess so. Amen. You could look at a
[53:16] cross and guess. You could you could
[53:18] look at a body laying in the ground and
[53:20] say I guess. But when the vision that
[53:22] struck Job has ever become a reality,
[53:26] amen, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[53:28] by the Holy Spirit in the heart, then
[53:31] you can say, "I know my redeemer
[53:34] liveth." I I find it amazing that Job
[53:36] here actually 4,000 years, Amen. before
[53:40] the coming of the son of God. Amen. Job
[53:42] by vision saw the resurrection. And I
[53:45] love it. He did not just see the
[53:47] resurrection by vision. Amen. But he
[53:50] received an assurance. Amen. By the
[53:53] vision he was going to be there. Amen.
[53:56] He did not just see the Lord raised, but
[53:58] he received Amen. an assurance by the
[54:01] vision that he was going to be there. I
[54:05] I'll say it like this. I believe that
[54:06] Job, amen, received a vindicated
[54:09] forecast, amen, of the future. Now, when
[54:12] you look there at that word forecast, it
[54:14] means a prophecy or an estimate. It is a
[54:17] prediction of a future happening, amen,
[54:19] or condition. It means to predict. Amen.
[54:22] Or to estimate a future event or trend.
[54:25] It is to indicate as likely to occur.
[54:28] Amen. I love what the prophet of God
[54:30] will say. Amen. He'll say, "A vision is
[54:32] the forecast of future events." Amen. It
[54:36] foretells the thing. Amen. Before it
[54:39] happens, he said, "Now man cannot just
[54:41] be hands laid on him or shook up and
[54:44] give a gift." Amen. He is born with that
[54:46] gift. It is born in him when he's born.
[54:50] Amen. Before he's born. Another place
[54:52] you'll say a vision is the word of God.
[54:54] Amen. It's something foretold. Amen. a
[54:57] forecast of an event. He said, "And a
[55:00] vision the prophets had and Jesus had
[55:02] and Paul had." Amen. All of them tell of
[55:04] this day. Amen. Was a forecast of what
[55:07] would happen. And here we see the
[55:10] forecast. Amen. Being made manifest and
[55:13] that people don't even recognize it.
[55:16] Now, I find it amazing when brother
[55:17] Brandon preaches the seven church ages.
[55:20] Remember, he lays out all seven church
[55:22] ages. He said, "Now the forecast, Amen,
[55:25] of what God is going to do for the
[55:27] churches, Amen, and through the
[55:29] churches." So when a prophet was
[55:30] preaching, Amen. the revelation of the
[55:32] seven church ages, he was preaching a
[55:35] forecast, amen, of what God was going to
[55:38] do for the churches, amen, and through
[55:40] the churches. When you when you read in
[55:42] the Old Testament, you will hear these
[55:43] words, "Thus sayaith the Lord." How many
[55:45] loves those words? Amen. Thus sayaith
[55:47] the Lord. He said it's recorded more
[55:49] than 2,000 times. He said, "So then the
[55:52] Bible is thus saith the Lord." Amen. By
[55:56] the prophets, he said, "They took Christ
[55:58] spirit upon themselves and they forecast
[56:01] the events, amen, that would come to
[56:03] pass." So here they are thousands of
[56:05] years ago, amen, but by vision they're
[56:08] able to forecast, amen, things that are
[56:10] going to happen, amen, in the day that
[56:12] you're living in. He said, "Now they
[56:14] actually, the readers would read it and
[56:17] they would think that the prophets,
[56:19] Amen, was actually speaking of
[56:21] themselves." He said, "But many times
[56:23] they were actually speaking of you."
[56:25] Amen. Now, how did this Bible, Amen, how
[56:28] did this prophecy get to us? The Bible
[56:31] said that the prophecy came not at old
[56:33] time, amen, by the will of man, but holy
[56:36] men of God spake. Amen. As they were
[56:39] moved by the Holy Ghost. Amen. I love
[56:41] that word moved. Amen. Because it don't
[56:44] mean moved outwardly. Amen. It means
[56:46] they were moved inwardly. Amen. They
[56:48] were not moved by what was happening
[56:50] around them. Amen. To write unto you of
[56:53] the things that would happen in the age
[56:56] you're living in. But rather there was
[56:57] something on the inside of them that was
[57:00] moving them that was causing them to
[57:02] prophesy. Amen. Of the day you're living
[57:04] in. I I say it's beautiful prophecy.
[57:07] Amen. Brother said if it's the true word
[57:09] of God, amen, it cannot fail. Amen.
[57:13] Glory. That ought to make you put your
[57:14] shouting shoes on. Amen. Amen. If it's
[57:17] true prophecy, Amen. It cannot fail.
[57:20] Now, amen. When you start thinking about
[57:22] forecast, your mind automatically goes,
[57:24] Amen. Amen. To the weather forecast,
[57:26] right? Amen. How many knows that there
[57:28] is actually a natural forecast, amen, as
[57:31] well as a spiritual forecast. Amen. I
[57:34] find it amazing that that in the Bible,
[57:36] in Matthew 16 as well as Luke 12, Amen.
[57:39] The Bible actually speaks of the weather
[57:41] forecast. And when it speaks of it, it
[57:44] says this. Amen. That you are able to
[57:46] discern, Amen. the face of the skies.
[57:49] Amen. But you cannot discern the signs
[57:52] of the times. Amen. I love it because,
[57:54] Amen. When the Bible speaks of that
[57:56] weather forecast, Amen. It's speaking of
[57:59] people who have the ability to discern
[58:01] the forecast of the weather. Amen. But
[58:04] they lack spiritual discernment. So they
[58:07] can tell you when it's going to rain.
[58:09] They can tell you when the sun is going
[58:10] to shine. They can tell you when all
[58:12] these things are going to happen. Amen.
[58:14] But they have forsaken the greatest
[58:16] discernment they need. Amen. And that is
[58:18] spiritual discernment. And let me tell
[58:20] you tonight as the elected overcomers.
[58:23] How many overcomers have I got here?
[58:24] Amen. Do you realize you did not choose
[58:26] to be an overcomer? But if you are an
[58:29] overcomer, God chose you. Amen. by
[58:32] election from before the foundation of
[58:34] the world to be an overcomer in the age.
[58:37] Amen. That he would positionally place
[58:39] you in. Listen church. God did not just
[58:42] send a prophet, amen, to say that this
[58:44] age was going to be wretched and
[58:46] miserable and poor and blind and naked.
[58:49] He did not just forecast the conditions
[58:51] of this age, but he also forecasted that
[58:54] there would be some overcomers who would
[58:56] overcome this age and they would sit
[58:59] with him in his throne. Amen. I say as
[59:01] the elected overcomers in this age,
[59:04] Amen. We must have spiritual
[59:06] discernment. Amen. It's not an option. I
[59:09] love what Paul would say. He would say,
[59:11] "The natural man receiveth not the
[59:13] things, Amen, of the spirit of God."
[59:16] Amen. For they are foolish unto him, and
[59:18] neither can he know them because they
[59:21] are spiritually discerned. I love that
[59:24] word spiritually. It means by the aid of
[59:27] the Holy Ghost. Amen. That word discern,
[59:30] it means to examine. Amen. It means to
[59:33] estimate. It means to scrutinize.
[59:36] It means to determine. Amen. The
[59:39] excellence or the defects of any person
[59:42] or thing. Brother said, "We have an
[59:44] order from God." Amen. Is for the
[59:46] discerning of spirit. Amen. Trying the
[59:49] spirit. Now, I'll say this. We are to
[59:51] discern the spirit. Amen. By the spirit.
[59:55] Amen. I don't know, brothers in the
[59:56] sound booth, if you can put it back in
[59:57] my ear monitor the way it was when I
[59:59] come out. It was good. And just leave it
[1:00:01] there. Amen. We are to discern by the
[1:00:03] spirit. Now, we're not to discern by the
[1:00:05] flesh. We're not discern by what group
[1:00:07] somebody comes out of. We are to discern
[1:00:10] by the spirit because behind everything
[1:00:13] there is an excellency or there is a
[1:00:16] defect. Now, I love it because John
[1:00:18] would say, "Beloved, Amen. believe not
[1:00:20] every spirit. Amen. But try the spirits
[1:00:24] whether they are of God because many
[1:00:26] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:00:28] world. Paul would write to Timothy and
[1:00:31] he would say having a form of godliness.
[1:00:34] Amen. But denying the power thereof he
[1:00:37] said from such turn away. Brother Bram
[1:00:39] comes along and said Paul promised in
[1:00:41] the last days by the Holy Spirit that
[1:00:44] the church would fall away. Millions of
[1:00:46] them listen there will come a fallen
[1:00:49] away. Amen. So Paul was prophesying,
[1:00:52] amen, by the vindicated word that there
[1:00:54] was going to be a fallen away. He said
[1:00:57] there'll be despisers of those that are
[1:00:59] good. He said not the right discernment.
[1:01:02] Oh, you say that's communist. No, that's
[1:01:04] so-called Christians. He says, now watch
[1:01:06] the next verse. They will have a form of
[1:01:09] godliness. Amen. But will deny the power
[1:01:12] thereof. Amen. See, there is no
[1:01:15] spiritual discernment. Because when you
[1:01:17] got spiritual discernment and the Holy
[1:01:20] Ghost is upon you, you have spiritual
[1:01:22] discernment. And it says amen to every
[1:01:26] promise of God. I say I say tonight,
[1:01:28] folks, it is time to forget man-made
[1:01:31] theology. It is time to forget religion.
[1:01:34] It is time to forget the ideas of
[1:01:35] theology. Amen. And cry out to God.
[1:01:38] Amen. For the spiritual power. Amen. And
[1:01:41] for the spiritual discernment. Amen.
[1:01:43] We're not just living in another age,
[1:01:45] church. We are living in the fulfillment
[1:01:47] of the vindicated forecast that has been
[1:01:50] given of this age. Amen. You all know in
[1:01:52] Luke 17:30 that Jesus stood there and he
[1:01:55] said as it was in the days of Sodom.
[1:01:57] Amen. So shall it be in the coming of
[1:02:00] the son of man. Brother Ram come along
[1:02:02] and said the police amen and the
[1:02:04] homicides and all that. Amen. Is just on
[1:02:06] the go all the time. Amen. Breaking up
[1:02:09] boys living together. Husband and wife
[1:02:11] women living the same way. He said
[1:02:13] perverted. Amen. Their minds are filthy
[1:02:15] minds. Amen. Because they don't have
[1:02:18] spiritual discernment. Amen. All is a
[1:02:21] lust. How many knows that's right?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; How are you awake? How many knows that's
[1:02:26] what the world you're living in? All is
[1:02:28] a lust. All is a field. Amen. And they
[1:02:30] cannot satisfy themselves even with one
[1:02:32] another. He said they don't even marry.
[1:02:34] They just take up and go out until
[1:02:36] they're perverted. Amen. But Jesus said
[1:02:38] that it would be in the last days. Now
[1:02:41] watch this. Jesus spoke that. Amen. all
[1:02:44] the way back in Luke 17. He said, "The
[1:02:46] signs and the conditions of Sodom and
[1:02:48] Gomorrah will return." He said that back
[1:02:51] in Luke 17 and many theologians looked
[1:02:54] at it and they probed at it and they
[1:02:56] tried to figure it out. But God would
[1:02:58] send a prophet on the scene and he would
[1:03:00] say, "Now Jesus said this there." He
[1:03:03] said, "But here it is." In other words,
[1:03:06] it's not coming. Amen. You're living in
[1:03:08] the condition of it. Amen. I'll say,
[1:03:10] "Thank God for spiritual discernment."
[1:03:12] Amen. Spiritual discernment is not
[1:03:14] guessing something is right and guessing
[1:03:17] something is wrong but it is knowing
[1:03:19] what is right and it is knowing what is
[1:03:22] wrong. And it takes spiritual
[1:03:23] discernment to know amen what truth is.
[1:03:27] I love what Jesus said. He said you
[1:03:29] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:03:31] make you free. Brother said if you could
[1:03:33] see God's word and still don't think
[1:03:36] it's the truth then there's something
[1:03:38] wrong with your spiritual discernment.
[1:03:40] Any man could read a newspaper if he's
[1:03:43] got any spiritual discernment about him
[1:03:45] at all and can see that we're at the
[1:03:47] end. Amen. The hour is here. There is
[1:03:50] nothing left for us. Amen. But the
[1:03:52] coming of the Lord Jesus, he said some
[1:03:54] people go out and say, "Oh, that might
[1:03:56] be a thousand years from today." He
[1:03:58] said, "I don't believe that." He said,
[1:04:01] "I believe this generation will see the
[1:04:04] coming of the Lord Jesus. If this
[1:04:06] generation doesn't do it, now watch
[1:04:09] this. I want to preach to the young
[1:04:11] people that they'll be looking for it in
[1:04:13] their generation. Listen, he said, I
[1:04:16] want to preach to the young people that
[1:04:18] they'll be looking for it in their
[1:04:20] generation. In other words, I want to
[1:04:22] preach the forecast because this is not
[1:04:25] the ideas of a man. This is the hour
[1:04:28] when God is fulfilling his word. He
[1:04:31] said, I want to build Amen. I'll say it
[1:04:33] like this. I want to build a spiritual
[1:04:35] expectation. Amen. I want to give a
[1:04:37] spiritual forecast. Amen. To the young
[1:04:40] people. How many knows that Paul
[1:04:41] prophesied and said, "We shall not all
[1:04:44] sleep,
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; but we shall all be changed." He said,
[1:04:47] "In the moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:04:49] eye, remember that?" Do you realize
[1:04:51] tonight there's not one Corinthian
[1:04:53] alive. Amen. There's not one
[1:04:55] Thessalonian alive. Amen. But somebody
[1:04:58] has got to fulfill that scripture. Amen.
[1:05:01] So God through a prophet forecasted he
[1:05:04] prophesied there would be a rapture. But
[1:05:07] he did not prophesy that there would be
[1:05:09] a rapture and everybody would be dead at
[1:05:11] the time of the rapture. He said some
[1:05:13] are going to go by the way of the grave
[1:05:15] but there's going to be some alive and
[1:05:18] remain. And I want to say to you
[1:05:19] tonight, God made a promise all the way
[1:05:22] back there to the Corinthians and the
[1:05:23] Thessalonians. But here you are tonight.
[1:05:26] And I believe I'm looking at the people
[1:05:29] who will fulfill, Amen, the promise of
[1:05:31] God that was prophesied years ago.
[1:05:34] Listen, I don't think it's time to let
[1:05:35] the prophecy become stale. I don't think
[1:05:37] it's time to let the message become
[1:05:39] stale. Amen. I think it's time to keep
[1:05:41] the expectation, amen, of the
[1:05:43] fulfillment of the prophecy of God,
[1:05:46] amen, fresh in our hearts. Amen. Brother
[1:05:49] tell us in the last days, he said, I
[1:05:51] love this term. He said, "God promised
[1:05:53] prophets." Amen. Now, you all know in
[1:05:56] Exodus 23:20, the Bible said, "Behold, I
[1:05:58] send an angel before thee." Amen. To
[1:06:00] keep thee in the way, and to bring thee
[1:06:03] into the place which I have prepared. In
[1:06:06] Malachi 4:5 and 6, he said, "Behold, I
[1:06:09] will send you, Amen, a lie to the
[1:06:11] prophets before the coming of the great
[1:06:13] and dreadful day of the Lord." Amen.
[1:06:15] Now, watch this. Watch the forecast,
[1:06:17] okay? And he shall turn the heart of the
[1:06:20] fathers to the children, and the heart
[1:06:22] of the children to their fathers. Amen.
[1:06:25] Lest I would come and smite the earth
[1:06:27] with a curse. Amen. Now watch this. In
[1:06:30] Ephesians 4, he gave some apostles and
[1:06:33] some prophets and some evangelists and
[1:06:35] some pastors and some teachers. Now
[1:06:37] listen, that's not the forecast, church.
[1:06:40] That's a part of it. But the forecast
[1:06:42] said, "For the perfecting of the saints,
[1:06:44] for the work of the ministry, for the
[1:06:46] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[1:06:49] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:06:51] of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto
[1:06:54] a perfect man, unto the measure of the
[1:06:56] stature of the fullness of Christ, that
[1:06:59] we henceforth be no more children, amen,
[1:07:01] tossed to and fro, and carried about
[1:07:04] with every wind of doctrine." Amen. But
[1:07:06] look in verse 15. but speaking the truth
[1:07:09] in love may grow up into him in all
[1:07:12] things which is the head even Christ.
[1:07:15] Amen. So there is going to be winds of
[1:07:17] doctrine. There was going to be winds of
[1:07:19] confusion. But the same forecast that
[1:07:22] said there was going to be winds of
[1:07:24] doctrine. There was going to be
[1:07:25] deception of man. It also forecasted
[1:07:28] that there was going to be a people who
[1:07:30] was going to be positionally placed by
[1:07:32] the ministry of the hour that they were
[1:07:34] living in. And they were not going to be
[1:07:36] carried about with every wind of
[1:07:37] doctrine, but they were going to have a
[1:07:39] solid place, amen, to stand upon on the
[1:07:42] word of God. Amen. If a man comes and he
[1:07:45] has a great gift. He said, no matter if
[1:07:47] he belongs to our denomination, don't
[1:07:49] judge him by what denomination he come
[1:07:50] from. Don't judge him how he dresses,
[1:07:53] but you want to see what is he trying to
[1:07:54] do with that gift,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; what purpose he has. If he's trying to
[1:07:59] take his influence and build himself a
[1:08:02] great name out of it, he said I would
[1:08:04] have discernment enough, amen, to know
[1:08:06] it was wrong. He said, "Now, no matter
[1:08:08] how great a teacher he is, how powerful
[1:08:10] he is, how intellectual he is, or how
[1:08:13] his gift operates, if he isn't trying to
[1:08:16] achieve something for the benefit of the
[1:08:18] body of Christ, then your own spiritual
[1:08:21] discernment would tell you that it's
[1:08:23] wrong. No matter how accurate, no matter
[1:08:26] how perfect, how it's been, if it's
[1:08:28] wrong, if it isn't used for the body of
[1:08:32] Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, how many knows
[1:08:34] that there was a Moses, amen, that
[1:08:36] brought Israel out of Egypt? But then
[1:08:38] there was a Joshua who took him into the
[1:08:41] promised land. And I love it because the
[1:08:43] prophet of God will call Joshua, he'll
[1:08:45] say Joshua the new leader. He'll say he
[1:08:48] positionally placed, Amen. I love this.
[1:08:50] the tribes of Israel. And he divided the
[1:08:53] land of inheritance. Amen. Now, how did
[1:08:56] he do it? He did not do it by his
[1:08:58] personality, saints. He did not do it by
[1:09:00] how well that he could rehearse the
[1:09:02] quotes of Moses under the children of
[1:09:04] Israel. But he positionistly placed them
[1:09:07] by spiritual discernment. Then they
[1:09:10] said, then watch. He said, then they
[1:09:12] remained in their place and they became
[1:09:15] the cream of the crop. Amen. I love it
[1:09:18] because spiritual discernment, amen, is
[1:09:20] more than a goosebump. It's more than an
[1:09:22] eerie feeling. It's more than an emotion
[1:09:25] or a sensation. But spiritual
[1:09:27] discernment is spiritual revelation of
[1:09:30] God. And Jesus said, "Flesh and blood
[1:09:32] has not revealed this unto you." Hey,
[1:09:35] but my father which is in heaven said,
[1:09:37] "Now watch." Amen. And see where the
[1:09:39] gates of hell is against. It ain't
[1:09:41] against the denomination. It ain't
[1:09:43] against a religion. Amen. It's against
[1:09:45] the spiritual revelation of Christ being
[1:09:49] here now, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:52] forever. Oh, but I love it. He said,
[1:09:55] that's where the church is missing it
[1:09:57] today. It's that spiritual discernment
[1:09:59] to see what God's a doing.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; So, we're not just looking at what God
[1:10:05] has done. We're not just looking at what
[1:10:08] God will do. Amen. They look way over
[1:10:10] the top for something here that's going
[1:10:12] on right before them. and it'll be
[1:10:14] passed before you know it. Now, I love
[1:10:17] it because brother Ram will establish in
[1:10:19] the message. He'll establish many
[1:10:20] beautiful what I call spiritual
[1:10:22] principles. Amen. Amen. He'll call them
[1:10:24] like this. How many knows this one?
[1:10:26] Amen. We get what we expect. Amen. We
[1:10:29] get what we expect. Amen. Here's one I
[1:10:32] like. Amen. I don't. He said, "Now,
[1:10:34] don't you miss it." He said, "Man now is
[1:10:36] like he's always been. He's praising God
[1:10:39] for what he's done. He's looking forward
[1:10:42] to what he will do. and he is ignoring
[1:10:45] what he done and is doing. He praises
[1:10:48] God for what he has done. He looks
[1:10:50] forward to what he's going to do, but he
[1:10:52] ignores what God is doing. Now listen,
[1:10:55] and there he misses the whole thing. So
[1:10:58] if you cannot discern by the spirit of
[1:11:01] God the hour that you're living in and
[1:11:04] the promises that God has made for that
[1:11:06] hour, then you're going to miss the
[1:11:08] manifestation of God in the hour you're
[1:11:11] living in. He said, "Now may he in his
[1:11:13] power come through this audience of
[1:11:15] people wherever you are and with his
[1:11:18] spiritual discernment, Amen, show you
[1:11:21] that he is the word." Amen. I want to
[1:11:23] make an announcement to you tonight,
[1:11:25] church. We're not looking for a
[1:11:27] forecast. We're not looking for a
[1:11:29] vision. As a matter of fact, we're
[1:11:31] looking at a vision. Amen. We have a
[1:11:34] vision. Where there is no vision, the
[1:11:37] people perish. I love that word vision
[1:11:39] because it means oracle. It means
[1:11:42] prophecy. Amen. It's a divine
[1:11:44] communication. So where there is no
[1:11:46] divine communication, the people will
[1:11:50] perish. Brother Ram comes along and he
[1:11:52] says, "Now what is the seer? What is a
[1:11:54] vision?" It's another dimension. See,
[1:11:57] it's outside. Amen. The five, it's a six
[1:12:01] sense. Again, he'll say, "What is a
[1:12:03] vision?" Someone has asked me many
[1:12:05] times, "Brother Brandon, are you
[1:12:06] impressed to say certain things or do
[1:12:08] you just think it in your mind?" He
[1:12:10] said, "No, sir. I see it. It's just
[1:12:12] there. It's like I'm looking at you just
[1:12:15] the same as you are. Only you know
[1:12:17] you're standing here. Yet you may be 40
[1:12:19] years back in somebody's life. Amen.
[1:12:22] Seeing what taking place. You even see
[1:12:24] the way they're dressed and positionally
[1:12:27] and everything. He said, "Then I have to
[1:12:29] talk." Now watch this. What is a vision?
[1:12:31] He said, "A vision is God." Are you with
[1:12:34] me? A vision is God by a word of
[1:12:37] knowledge dropping to the person to
[1:12:40] foresee or foresee something with
[1:12:43] something. Amen. Tells something that
[1:12:45] has been or something that will be. So
[1:12:48] when someone has a vision, they are
[1:12:51] actually seeing what has been and
[1:12:53] they're seeing what has been or they're
[1:12:56] seeing what will be. Listen church, a
[1:12:58] vision is not seeing what is. You can
[1:13:00] see what is right now. But if you're
[1:13:03] going to see beyond, oh God, if you're
[1:13:05] going to see beyond what is, you're
[1:13:08] going to have to have a vision to see
[1:13:10] what's coming in the future or to see
[1:13:12] what's behind you. Listen, the church of
[1:13:15] the living God is not going backwards.
[1:13:17] Amen. She does not go back. Amen. She
[1:13:20] has one direction and that direction is
[1:13:22] onward and upward.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're in the middle of
[1:13:26] something, when you're in a trial, when
[1:13:28] you're in a situation, Amen. That's when
[1:13:30] you need a vision. Amen. When you're
[1:13:32] sick, amen, that's when you need a
[1:13:34] vision. When you're discouraged, amen,
[1:13:37] that's when you need a vision. When you
[1:13:39] don't know the future, and when
[1:13:41] everything looks like it's falling
[1:13:42] apart, amen, that's the time you need a
[1:13:45] vision. Oh, but as I read earlier, I
[1:13:47] love it. Amen. God in his mercy. Are
[1:13:49] y'all with me tonight? Amen. Job is
[1:13:52] sitting on the ash heap, saints. He's on
[1:13:55] the ash heap. His children are gone. His
[1:13:58] house is gone. His livestock is gone.
[1:14:00] Everything is gone.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Every mortal
[1:14:05] part of him is withering away." He said,
[1:14:08] "Now watch. But God in his mercy gave
[1:14:12] Job another sense."
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Now, now I love this because another
[1:14:17] sense is the sixth sense.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Another sense is the super sense.
[1:14:22] Hebrews 11:1, now faith is the substance
[1:14:25] of things hoped for. Amen. It's the
[1:14:27] evidence of things not seen. In
[1:14:30] Galatians 2:19, I love what Paul says.
[1:14:32] He said, "For I through the law am dead
[1:14:35] to the law that I might live unto God."
[1:14:38] Now, now watch this. Paul is alive, but
[1:14:41] he's dead. He said, "I am crucified with
[1:14:44] Christ. Now, nevertheless, I live, yet
[1:14:47] not I, but Christ liveth in me." He
[1:14:50] said, "And the life which I now live,"
[1:14:52] now listen. I live in the flesh. Now,
[1:14:55] come on, church. When Paul got saved, he
[1:14:57] did not get a new flesh. He did not
[1:14:59] become an angel. He remained Paul in the
[1:15:03] same flesh that killed Christians. In
[1:15:05] the same flesh that crucified people for
[1:15:08] believing in the name of God. But I love
[1:15:10] what he says. He said, "But I now live
[1:15:12] in the flesh. I live by the faith of the
[1:15:15] son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:15:19] for me." Can I say it to you like this?
[1:15:21] I believe what Paul is saying. Amen. is
[1:15:24] in one sense I am dead but in another
[1:15:27] sense I'm alive. In one sense I'm dead
[1:15:30] but in another sense I am alive.
[1:15:33] Somebody say in one sense
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I am dead.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; I am dead.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; But in another sense
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I'm alive. Amen. I love that phrase. In
[1:15:43] one sense but in another sense. You know
[1:15:45] what that refers to? It refers to the
[1:15:48] different ways that we perceive amen.
[1:15:51] The world through our five senses. Now,
[1:15:53] the best example I know of, brother Ram
[1:15:56] gives it to us in the message, he said,
[1:15:57] "Now, like today, if some of you ladies
[1:15:59] were at home and the express agent would
[1:16:02] come by, he would say, "How do you do,
[1:16:03] Miss John Doe?" You would say, "Yes."
[1:16:06] Well, I have something here for you. And
[1:16:08] you would look at it. Now, you would
[1:16:09] look at it. Are you with me? You would
[1:16:11] look at it and it's a great big box of
[1:16:13] rattlesnakes. Well, what a present.
[1:16:15] Amen. There's your name tacked on them.
[1:16:18] Now, look here. These are yours. Brother
[1:16:20] Bradam says, "Are they?" Amen. Are they?
[1:16:24] He said, 'Well, in one sense, they're
[1:16:26] yours, but in another sense, they're
[1:16:28] not. Amen. In one sense, by sight, you
[1:16:32] can see your name on them, but in
[1:16:34] another sense, they're not yours. Now,
[1:16:37] you say, "I don't want them." Well,
[1:16:39] they're yours because your name's on
[1:16:41] them. He said, "Well, that's one way
[1:16:43] it's yours, but it still isn't yours
[1:16:46] until you sign for it. And if you don't
[1:16:48] sign for it, then he will have to take
[1:16:51] it back.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. They're yours as long
[1:16:56] as you can see your name on them. Amen.
[1:16:58] But if you can receive another sense,
[1:17:01] Amen. If the spiritual discernment will
[1:17:04] take over and you know what's in that
[1:17:06] box, then by that discernment, you're
[1:17:09] able to discern. Amen. The defect that's
[1:17:11] behind what the devil's trying to get
[1:17:13] you to sign for. Hey, I'll say it like
[1:17:15] this. Amen, brother Brandham. Now, now
[1:17:17] discernment, right? Amen. Is to discern,
[1:17:20] Amen. the excellency or the defect. I
[1:17:23] love it. In 1963, he says, "Now, Brother
[1:17:26] Brandham, could Jesus look like you or
[1:17:28] you be Jesus or something like that?"
[1:17:30] Well, one sense of the word, that's
[1:17:32] exactly the truth, but another sense of
[1:17:35] the word is an antichrist. Amen. So, in
[1:17:37] one sense of the word, it was the truth,
[1:17:40] but in another sense of the word, it's
[1:17:42] an antichrist. He said, "Now that's the
[1:17:44] difference between right and wrong to
[1:17:47] make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:49] Christ would be an antichrist." See, for
[1:17:52] that the person of the Lord Jesus is
[1:17:54] sitting at the right hand of the majesty
[1:17:56] on high and will come again in great
[1:17:59] power and glory. But for his life,
[1:18:02] listen, but for his life that was in
[1:18:04] him. Amen. Being upon me and upon you
[1:18:08] who have him, it's exactly the truth
[1:18:10] because you become Christ. Amen. So
[1:18:13] Jesus was more than just a man. Amen. He
[1:18:16] was a God man. The prophet of God said
[1:18:19] he was man in one sense. He was God in
[1:18:22] another sense. He was man in flesh but
[1:18:25] in spirit he was God. Now I love this
[1:18:27] because we've taken it from our Lord
[1:18:29] Jesus and we brought it down to our
[1:18:31] prophet. Amen. But let's bring it on
[1:18:32] down to the believer. He said if man he
[1:18:35] is in one sense a miniature creator if
[1:18:38] he is a child of God because the spirit
[1:18:41] of God is in him who controls him and
[1:18:45] who operates him. He said we are carnal
[1:18:48] and that part must perish but then
[1:18:50] inside we are a spirit man. There's a
[1:18:54] soul on the inside. He said and that's
[1:18:57] faith in God's word. Church of the
[1:18:59] living God. You got a soul on the inside
[1:19:02] of you. And that soul is not an emotion.
[1:19:05] That soul is not a feeling. That soul is
[1:19:07] not a good day or a bad day. That soul
[1:19:10] is faith in God's forecast.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That soul on the inside of
[1:19:17] you is faith in God's word. He said,
[1:19:20] "Then we bring our outside body under
[1:19:23] subjection to the word by faith." How do
[1:19:27] we bring this outside body under the
[1:19:30] subjection to the word by faith? He says
[1:19:33] by accepting,
[1:19:35] glory to God,
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; by accepting what God said. Now, I love
[1:19:40] this because that word sense, it's an
[1:19:43] ability to understand or to recognize,
[1:19:47] to value, or react to something. I find
[1:19:50] it amazing because as we as we look
[1:19:52] here, you all know we have five outer
[1:19:54] senses, right? We have see, taste, feel,
[1:19:57] smell, and hear. And then we have five
[1:20:00] inner senses, which is imagination.
[1:20:02] Amen. Conscience, memory, reason, and
[1:20:04] affection. Now, I love this because the
[1:20:06] prophet of God said those five inner and
[1:20:08] outer senses, they were not given you to
[1:20:10] guide you. He said, but they were given
[1:20:13] for earthly contact. Now, listen. The
[1:20:16] body, the flesh is controlled by five
[1:20:18] outer senses. Right? Yeah.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; The spirit, the inside man is controlled
[1:20:24] by five inner senses. But underneath
[1:20:26] that flesh and underneath that spirit,
[1:20:29] there's a soul. And brother said, it's
[1:20:31] controlled by one or two, either faith
[1:20:33] or unbelief.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch this. Faith then is the
[1:20:37] six sense. It's the only direct and
[1:20:41] positive sense. And if you're possessed
[1:20:43] with faith, he said, "Faith is just as
[1:20:46] much reality
[1:20:48] to you as sad is. Whatever your senses
[1:20:51] yield to will dominate you." I love this
[1:20:54] because he said, "See, Amen. the six
[1:20:57] sense only belongs to the Christian." He
[1:21:00] said, "And you cannot have this six
[1:21:02] sense until you become a Christian is
[1:21:05] the only way you can ever have any more
[1:21:08] than the five natural senses for the
[1:21:10] natural person." He said, "The sixth
[1:21:12] sense is better known to the Christian
[1:21:15] as faith. It's the one that governs and
[1:21:18] guides you, and it is superior to all
[1:21:21] the other senses." Listen, the six
[1:21:23] sense, I love this. Amen. The sixth
[1:21:25] sense cannot lie. Don't that make you
[1:21:28] feel good? Amen. The sixth sense cannot
[1:21:30] lie. He said, "And the super sense, I
[1:21:33] love this. Is the Holy Spirit, the faith
[1:21:36] of God, Amen, that dwells in you. And if
[1:21:39] you'll let the five senses be yielded to
[1:21:41] the six sense, it'll guide you and bring
[1:21:44] all the other five senses under the
[1:21:46] control of the super sense. For it's so
[1:21:48] far above the natural sense. Listen, it
[1:21:51] makes you believe things that you cannot
[1:21:53] see. It makes you act where you do not
[1:21:56] think the five senses would ever think
[1:21:58] about. He said, now listen, the devil
[1:22:00] can get into these five senses and he
[1:22:02] can lie to you, but he cannot touch that
[1:22:05] super sense. Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; The devil can get into your five outer
[1:22:11] and inner senses and lie to you through
[1:22:13] those senses, but he cannot get into
[1:22:16] that super sense. It's far beyond his
[1:22:18] reach. He said that comes from God.
[1:22:21] Amen. I love this because he said, "See,
[1:22:24] Amen. It's that sixth sense." He said,
[1:22:26] "It will deliver that word to you and
[1:22:29] will make you walk contrary to any other
[1:22:33] thing there is but God's word." He said,
[1:22:36] "Oh, I'm talking about the six sense."
[1:22:38] He said, "Casting down reasonings, you
[1:22:40] walk by that six sense." Amen. You talk
[1:22:43] by that six sense. You live by that six
[1:22:46] sense. He said, "You die by that six
[1:22:48] sense. And you rise by that six sense."
[1:22:51] Are y'all hearing me? Amen. You don't
[1:22:53] just walk and live and talk and go to
[1:22:56] church and die by that six sense. Amen.
[1:22:58] But there is a connection, amen, between
[1:23:01] lifting power and that six sense. He
[1:23:04] said, "See, in a natural man's senses
[1:23:06] are all right if they can be brought
[1:23:07] into submission to the six sense." He
[1:23:10] said, "But if it reads and says it's not
[1:23:12] all the word of God, or it was, it's
[1:23:14] something. It was one time, but it isn't
[1:23:16] now." He said, "Then that six sense
[1:23:18] comes in and says he's the same
[1:23:20] yesterday, today, and forever." Amen. I
[1:23:24] love this. The six sense, I hope this is
[1:23:25] okay. Amen. The six sense has come upon
[1:23:28] the human being to make them deny
[1:23:31] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:23:33] God. Amen. What is the word of God,
[1:23:35] saints? The word of God, Amen, is the
[1:23:38] forecast. Amen. He said, see, than that
[1:23:41] super sense, it's a greater sense. It's
[1:23:43] a power that stirs and drives. It's
[1:23:46] something that makes you do things that
[1:23:48] you never thought you would do. Amen.
[1:23:51] It's a six sense. Amen. And it's the
[1:23:53] super sense. I love this. And it only
[1:23:56] feeds on the word of God. Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] The only thing the six sense feeds on,
[1:24:03] Amen, is not emotion, it's not feelings
[1:24:06] or sensation, but the six sense feeds on
[1:24:09] the word of God. Now, I love it because
[1:24:11] brother Brown will automatically turn
[1:24:12] and he'll begin to rehearse to you the
[1:24:14] testimony of how there were two women
[1:24:16] who come through a prayer line one time
[1:24:18] and he said one come through, she had a
[1:24:20] gorder on her neck. He said the other
[1:24:22] come through and she had a stomach
[1:24:24] trouble. He said they now they walked
[1:24:25] through the same prayer line. Remember
[1:24:27] that?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; They both walked through the same prayer
[1:24:30] line. He said, "And both of them were
[1:24:32] confessed." Amen. By the spirit of the
[1:24:34] Lord that they were healed. He said one
[1:24:36] walked out with the gorder and the other
[1:24:39] walked out with the stomach trouble. Do
[1:24:41] you all realize it was two weeks? Are
[1:24:43] you with me?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; It was two weeks went by and she still
[1:24:47] had the gorder and one still had the
[1:24:49] stomach trouble. But I want you to catch
[1:24:52] something. Amen. But their faith had
[1:24:54] already taken a hold. They could still
[1:24:57] see the gorder. She could still feel the
[1:25:00] stomach trouble. She could still feel
[1:25:03] all the symptoms. But there was a
[1:25:04] greater sense that had moved into her
[1:25:07] soul. And it was a superior sense. It
[1:25:10] was a s Oh, glory. It was a sense of
[1:25:12] faith that had come in her. Listen,
[1:25:14] church. He said, and they come through
[1:25:16] there. And he said one morning, he said
[1:25:18] she got up and her kid went to school.
[1:25:20] And he said unconsciously. Amen. She
[1:25:22] finished the breakfast. Amen. And then
[1:25:24] she said, "Well, I kept that down." She
[1:25:26] said, "I'm going to give it the acid
[1:25:28] test and she went over and she drank a
[1:25:30] cup of coffee." He said, "And it stayed
[1:25:32] down." Brother Paul, he said she be to
[1:25:35] shout and she began to rejoice and she
[1:25:37] was healed. And she took off running up
[1:25:40] the street. Amen. To her friend's house
[1:25:42] and she went in there and that woman was
[1:25:44] shaking the sheets. She said, "What are
[1:25:46] you doing?" She said, "Oh my." She said,
[1:25:48] "I woke up this morning and I looked in
[1:25:50] the mirror and the gorder was completely
[1:25:52] calm." She said, "I'm trying to find it.
[1:25:55] I'm trying to find the gorder." Oh, I
[1:25:57] love a prophet. He said, "Now, what was
[1:25:59] it?" He said, "They were standing in the
[1:26:01] meeting. They were hearing the same word
[1:26:04] preached. They come to the same prayer
[1:26:06] line." He said, "The sixth sense was
[1:26:08] catching it. And then the six sense, are
[1:26:10] y'all hearing me? the six sense and the
[1:26:14] Holy Spirit was standing side by side.
[1:26:17] Hallelujah. He said the Holy Spirit was
[1:26:20] speaking and the six sense was saying
[1:26:23] amen. Oh, I say thank God that when I
[1:26:27] don't feel like back in the word, when I
[1:26:29] don't feel like amening, when I don't
[1:26:31] feel like worshiping, when I don't feel
[1:26:32] like praising God, I say thank God that
[1:26:35] God in his mercy would come down and
[1:26:38] would give me another sense. It's beyond
[1:26:40] the way I think. It's beyond the things
[1:26:43] I can see. It's beyond the things I can
[1:26:45] hear. I have broke out into a realm of
[1:26:47] faith. It's not a natural realm. It's
[1:26:50] not an educational realm. It's a
[1:26:52] supernatural realm where the only thing
[1:26:54] controlling is the faith of God.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking about another
[1:27:00] sense, church. I'm talking about you can
[1:27:03] be in the darkest trial of your life and
[1:27:06] let that sick sense begin to speak over
[1:27:08] you.
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:12] My goodness.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; See, look what happened. The Holy Spirit
[1:27:16] was speaking.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And the sixth sense
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; was amening.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Church of the living God.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you why some of y'all are
[1:27:28] still here tonight? It's cuz sometimes
[1:27:30] your five senses, they don't amen,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; but the six sense does.
[1:27:36] Sometimes you don't feel like going to
[1:27:38] church.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; You don't feel like reading your Bible.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You don't feel like praying. You don't
[1:27:45] feel like worshiping. Amen. But there's
[1:27:47] another sense on the inside of you that
[1:27:50] is predicting your future.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I love it because because in 2
[1:27:56] Corinthians 4:7, I love what Paul says.
[1:27:58] You all know it. He said, "Now we have
[1:28:01] this treasure in earth and vessels,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; that the excellency of the power may be
[1:28:08] of God and not of us." Now, we have this
[1:28:12] excellency. We have this treasure in
[1:28:15] earth and vessels. How many earthn
[1:28:17] vessels have I got here tonight?
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Six of you.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; We don't have no angels.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Contrary to popular belief, that's
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; We got earth and vessels. But I can take
[1:28:28] the word of God
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and by the word of God, I can
[1:28:32] spiritually discern what's on the inside
[1:28:34] of those earth and vessels.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; See, I can see what's on the inside of
[1:28:39] those earthn vessels is the power of
[1:28:42] God.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Now, now I say this, I love verse eight
[1:28:45] because it says this. It says, you know,
[1:28:47] we are troubled on every side. Anybody?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Anybody testify that?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; We are troubled on every side
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; yet not distressed. Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this. We are perplexed,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; but not in despair.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I love verse 9. We are persecuted,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; but we are not forsaken.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We are cast down,
[1:29:11] but we're not destroyed. Somebody say,
[1:29:13] "Oh, bless God. I'm not troubled." Well,
[1:29:14] the Bible said you are. The Bible Come
[1:29:17] on, church. The Bible said you're
[1:29:19] troubled on every side. You say, "Bless
[1:29:22] God. Amen. I'm too spiritual." No. Let's
[1:29:24] say what the Bible says. The Bible said
[1:29:26] from the preacher, amen, to the deacon
[1:29:28] to the lay member, we're troubled on
[1:29:30] every side, but yet we're not
[1:29:32] distressed.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what it is? It's the
[1:29:36] excellency of the power of God.
[1:29:38] Hallelujah. It's the excellency of the
[1:29:41] power of God. It's another sense.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can I read it to you like
[1:29:46] I'm really seeing it? Amen. In one
[1:29:48] sense, we are troubled on every side,
[1:29:50] but in another sense, we're not
[1:29:52] distressed.
[1:29:54] Hey, glory to God. In one sense, we are
[1:29:57] perplexed, but in another sense, we are
[1:30:00] not in despair. In one sense, we are
[1:30:03] persecuted.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; But in another sense, we are not
[1:30:08] forsaken.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; In one sense, church, we are cast down,
[1:30:13] but in another sense, we are not
[1:30:15] destroyed.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; My then what are you talking about? I'm
[1:30:18] talking about a vision has come to the
[1:30:20] church. I'm talking about a vindicated
[1:30:22] word has come into your heart to confess
[1:30:25] the f to confess the father. Amen. Of
[1:30:28] your life is the word of God.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Now, now I just got to say what Paul
[1:30:33] said. Paul said, "A vision is an oracle
[1:30:35] of God."
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I love what Peter says. He says, "If any
[1:30:39] man speaks, then let him speak as the
[1:30:42] oracles of God. And if any man minister,
[1:30:46] he said, 'Now let him do it as of the
[1:30:48] ability which God giveth. Now I love
[1:30:51] this because the prophet of God is going
[1:30:53] to say something beautiful. He's going
[1:30:55] to say, "Oh God, take the clay, the
[1:30:57] voice of mortal beings, and speak, Lord,
[1:31:01] the oracles of God." I love what he says
[1:31:03] here. He said, "Blessed Father, we are
[1:31:05] indeed grateful to thee for this time of
[1:31:07] fellowship together around the word and
[1:31:09] these holy oracles of God. And may as we
[1:31:12] partake of them by the reading and the
[1:31:15] hearing, may the Holy Spirit inspire
[1:31:17] them to our hearts.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; That when we leave today, we would say
[1:31:23] like those from Emmas, it was good for
[1:31:26] us to be here.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our hearts burned within us
[1:31:31] because he talked to us in that way.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love this because in the
[1:31:36] message the church choosing law for
[1:31:37] grace, he said, "But Joshua, he took the
[1:31:40] oracles of God." Now watch this. And he
[1:31:44] marched over into the promised land.
[1:31:47] Listen. He said, "And I want you to get
[1:31:49] built up now in this holy oracles of God
[1:31:52] in the faith. The faith of this hour,
[1:31:55] the faith, it's going to take more faith
[1:31:57] than ever was in any age for this has to
[1:32:00] be rapturing faith." So then our vision,
[1:32:03] church, amen, is not a Pentecostal
[1:32:06] preacher, amen, coming among the church
[1:32:08] with a gift trying to tell you about
[1:32:10] your future. Our vision is the oracles
[1:32:13] of God. It's the spiritual forecast. Can
[1:32:16] I just get it out there? It's the
[1:32:18] message of the hour.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Now, I say this to you. How can you have
[1:32:23] a weather forecast without a weatherman?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And how can you have a message without a
[1:32:30] messenger? That's right.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; And how can you have a prophecy without
[1:32:34] a prophet? I love what Amos says. He
[1:32:36] says, "Surely the Lord God will do
[1:32:39] nothing but he revealth his secrets unto
[1:32:42] his servants, the prophets." Now, I love
[1:32:44] this because the prophet said, "See,
[1:32:46] they had understanding through the word
[1:32:49] of the Lord." Amen. By the prophet, he
[1:32:51] said, "Do you see the prophet is a
[1:32:53] special man? He foresees way off. He
[1:32:56] sees the thing that is coming. He sees
[1:32:58] the cup of God's wrath full before it is
[1:33:02] filled. And he can say, "Thus sayaith
[1:33:04] the Lord." Listen, he ain't looking at
[1:33:06] what's going on here. He's looking
[1:33:09] yonder and he's saying it's coming. He
[1:33:12] can go so high. He said the world will
[1:33:14] be dark. He's up high enough the sun's
[1:33:17] shining out, but he sees the shade that
[1:33:20] is coming. And he's saying what he's
[1:33:22] looking at. Now listen. He's saying it
[1:33:24] ain't here yet.
[1:33:28] It ain't here yet, but it'll sure be
[1:33:31] here.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the prophet's looking off and
[1:33:34] he's seeing something. He's talking
[1:33:37] about what he's looking at. He is
[1:33:39] thinking about here and what you look
[1:33:41] like now. No, he's looking at what's
[1:33:44] going to be. Come on, church. Amen. How
[1:33:46] would you feel if your pastor preached
[1:33:48] to you the way you come to church
[1:33:50] looking?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Somebody might as
[1:33:55] well preach.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You come to church looking like I
[1:33:59] just got to preach. You come to church
[1:34:01] looking like the world's sitting on your
[1:34:02] shoulders.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it takes brother Paul 30
[1:34:05] minutes to get one peep out of you.
[1:34:07] Amen. Because because you're going
[1:34:09] through something and we get that. Amen.
[1:34:11] But do you know why now? Now you imagine
[1:34:13] what kind of services you'd have if your
[1:34:15] pastor preached at you looking at the
[1:34:16] things you're going through.
[1:34:18] Wow.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; He got up and said, "Man, it's just bad
[1:34:20] and it ain't getting no easier and
[1:34:21] everything's getting harder and trials
[1:34:23] are getting harder and pressures are
[1:34:24] getting harder and I know. Let's just
[1:34:26] have an open mic service and pass the
[1:34:28] mic around and you tell me what you're
[1:34:29] going through and I'll tell you what I'm
[1:34:31] and and before long it'd be so heavy in
[1:34:33] here. You could hardly breathe.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; But see, if you're going to if you're
[1:34:36] going to make it, you got to look at
[1:34:38] something beyond what's happening now."
[1:34:40] He said, "See, and when he speaks that,
[1:34:43] if it's in the word of the Lord, it's
[1:34:45] already been spoke." Listen. And there's
[1:34:47] nothing in the world can stop it.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The vision is coming
[1:34:53] from the word of God. And if it's coming
[1:34:56] from the word of God, there's nothing
[1:34:58] can stop it. He said, see, when God
[1:35:00] sends himself to an age, Amen. I love
[1:35:02] this. When God sends his message to an
[1:35:04] age, do you all realize that message
[1:35:07] becomes the leadership of that age? He
[1:35:09] said, now watch. Only the elect, Amen,
[1:35:12] will follow that message. Now, Amen. I
[1:35:14] just got to hurry here. But I find it
[1:35:16] amazing. Amen. That when you start
[1:35:18] looking at forecast, Amen. A forecast is
[1:35:21] usually it's usually Amen. coming to you
[1:35:24] in a paper form or a radio form.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of you already know that
[1:35:31] there's there is there is pillars in
[1:35:33] this message?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Mighty men of God that have carried this
[1:35:36] message and preached it
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; and the way they heard it was on the
[1:35:39] radio.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. How many of
[1:35:42] you all know that there are men of God
[1:35:44] in this message, Amen, that the way they
[1:35:46] command this message was they found it
[1:35:48] in a book form?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a man over in West
[1:35:52] Virginia, brother, he's gone on to Glory
[1:35:54] now, Brother McKim, he told me one time,
[1:35:55] he said, "Brother Andrew," he said, "I
[1:35:57] got the message." He said, "How I got it
[1:35:58] was I was working at the post office and
[1:36:00] he said, there was a trash bucket there
[1:36:02] and he said, one day I saw a man walk by
[1:36:04] and he took something and threw it in
[1:36:06] the trash can and he kept on walking."
[1:36:08] He said, "I followed him." And he said,
[1:36:10] "I reached in the trash can and pulled
[1:36:12] out what he threw in there." And he
[1:36:13] said, "It was the seven church ages
[1:36:15] book." He said, "One man's trash was
[1:36:17] another man's treasure."
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now watch. But but our
[1:36:21] spiritual forecast has come to us in
[1:36:24] book and tape form. How many can agree?
[1:36:26] Amen. When you look there then, Amen. I
[1:36:28] find it amazing. Amen. Because the
[1:36:30] spiritual forecast is broadcast. You
[1:36:32] know, brother Re said the message will
[1:36:34] be broadcast. Amen. Look at this word
[1:36:36] broadcast. It means to transmit. Amen. A
[1:36:39] program or some information by radio or
[1:36:42] television. I love this. To broadcast,
[1:36:44] brother Barry. It means to scatter
[1:36:46] seeds. It means to tell something to
[1:36:48] many people to make it widely known.
[1:36:52] Now, I got to keep breaking it down
[1:36:53] because another word for broadcast is
[1:36:56] sow. So, a forecast is broadcast, which
[1:37:00] means you're scattering seeds. And while
[1:37:02] you're scattering those seeds, Amen.
[1:37:04] you're sewing those seeds. Amen. That's
[1:37:07] why Jesus said, "Behold, a swer went
[1:37:09] forth to sow." Jesus would also say,
[1:37:12] "And the seed is the word of God." I
[1:37:15] love this inspoken word is the original
[1:37:17] seed. He said, "Now, of course, the
[1:37:19] messenger of Malachi 4, he will plant
[1:37:22] the seed of the entire Bible." Amen.
[1:37:25] Plum from the serpent to the messenger
[1:37:27] in the former reign. Now, I love this.
[1:37:29] He said, "Now, the book is different.
[1:37:30] It's a the Bible is a different book
[1:37:32] from any other sacred book. There is no
[1:37:34] book like the Bible because the Bible is
[1:37:37] God in word form. He said, "Now see this
[1:37:41] book of prophecy, it is foretelling the
[1:37:43] future events." Do you all realize
[1:37:45] church? He said, "I'm doing the best I
[1:37:47] can. I'm going to this corner sewing
[1:37:50] seed and over here sew a few seed and
[1:37:52] over here throw sew a few seed." I know.
[1:37:55] He says, I know the fouls of the air are
[1:37:58] going to gather many of them up and some
[1:38:00] of them choke and so forth, but there
[1:38:02] might be a few in there come up too.
[1:38:04] Hallelujah. There's going to be some
[1:38:07] that's going to be gathered by the
[1:38:08] fouls. There's some that's going to be
[1:38:10] choked by the cares of the world. He
[1:38:12] said, "Oh, but then there's some good
[1:38:14] ground." Amen. So, let's just sew the
[1:38:16] seed. Amen. That's the main thing. Amen.
[1:38:19] Now, you all know the prophet said three
[1:38:21] seeds have been sown, right? He said,
[1:38:24] "There's a denominational seed that's
[1:38:26] been swn by Billy Graham." He said,
[1:38:27] "There's a Pentecostal seed and it's
[1:38:30] been sown by or Roberts." He said, "But
[1:38:32] then the messenger of Malachi 4 is going
[1:38:34] to sew the unadulterated, the
[1:38:37] undiluted." Amen. The perfect word. He's
[1:38:40] going to sew the word seed. Now listen,
[1:38:44] that's going to be the difference then
[1:38:46] in a leadyan age and a bride age.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Brother Ram taught
[1:38:52] that. And let me tell you what he said.
[1:38:54] He said, "The Leodysian age, church age,
[1:38:57] is the Pentecostal organization, which
[1:39:00] all goes right straight into the mark of
[1:39:03] the beast." But thank God, between the
[1:39:06] coming of the son of God and the coming
[1:39:09] of the son of David, there was a Luke
[1:39:11] 17:30 forecast that there would be a
[1:39:14] return of the son of man. And the return
[1:39:17] of the son of man would be a shout,
[1:39:19] which would be 1 Thessalonians 4. And
[1:39:22] with that shout, a prophet would
[1:39:23] identify, amen, that the shout is the
[1:39:26] message. Hallelujah. And what's the
[1:39:28] message doing? It's calling you out.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah. It's calling you out. He
[1:39:34] said, now see, Amen. Watch this. A
[1:39:36] prophet stands on the scene and he says,
[1:39:38] I believe there's something coming. He
[1:39:40] said, there's a double portion of the
[1:39:41] church. He said, I feel that down in my
[1:39:43] heart. 1958, a prophet stand there. He
[1:39:47] says, now my ministry is changing. He
[1:39:49] said, there's something coming. Amen.
[1:39:51] That's great and wonderful. But now
[1:39:53] watch in 1962 he changes brother Mvin
[1:39:56] from saying that there's something
[1:39:58] coming to he says now see my ministry is
[1:40:02] to declare him he is here.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; It's coming.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; It's coming.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; It's coming. It's coming. But it takes a
[1:40:13] forecast.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yeah,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; anybody can look at the weather map
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; and say a storm is coming.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; But it takes a weatherman
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; to say there's the storm and it's moving
[1:40:30] that way and it's coming that way
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and it's going out that way and it's
[1:40:34] going to hit right here. Church of the
[1:40:36] living God.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; He said if the great Holy Spirit the
[1:40:38] unseen now if the senses of faith will
[1:40:40] declare him to me. He's brought the
[1:40:42] senses of faith and his word has brought
[1:40:45] it so close in this last days
[1:40:48] till he's got the picture of it there.
[1:40:50] He said, "Now listen now. He's here. I
[1:40:53] know he's here. My faith says he's
[1:40:56] here."
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then then I can say to you
[1:40:59] tonight, we're not looking for signs.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; We're not seeking signs.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; We are recognizing
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; the signs.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; That God has sent among the church. I I
[1:41:09] I pray this is okay. Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He said in Jeremiah 10:2, "Thus sayith
[1:41:13] the Lord, learn not the way of the
[1:41:14] heathen, and be not dismayed at the
[1:41:16] signs of the heaven, for the heathen are
[1:41:19] dismayed at them." Now listen here.
[1:41:21] Dismayed comes from the word
[1:41:23] discouraged. What is it? The unbeliever
[1:41:25] is discouraged with what? The signs of
[1:41:27] heaven. He said, "It just makes an
[1:41:29] unbeliever pout and angry. He don't know
[1:41:31] what to think about it." He said, "But
[1:41:32] to the believer,
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; it's a vindication of the truth of God's
[1:41:38] word that speaks of the coming sign.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; It vindicates God's word to be the
[1:41:43] truth." He said, "Now the unbeliever,
[1:41:45] he's worried. He's dismayed. He's
[1:41:47] discouraged." Oh, such an outfit. He
[1:41:48] will say, "You don't mean you belong to
[1:41:50] a thing like that." See, he's
[1:41:51] discouraged with it. But to the
[1:41:53] believer,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. To the believer, he
[1:41:58] said, "Oh, it's honey in the rock. It's
[1:42:01] a vindication. What does Revelation 10:9
[1:42:04] say? It shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:42:07] honey. Amen. Can I say to you tonight,
[1:42:09] church, we are not looking for a move of
[1:42:12] God. We have a move of God. The move of
[1:42:15] God is on for the bride. He said, then
[1:42:18] never let the message become common.
[1:42:20] Now, I want to say this to you, and I I
[1:42:21] want to say it very plainly and very and
[1:42:23] in and closing that. I don't want to
[1:42:24] hold you too long. I know it's Friday
[1:42:26] night, but I want you to catch this. He
[1:42:27] said, "Oh, the spiritual union of Christ
[1:42:30] and his church." Now, when the flesh is
[1:42:33] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:42:35] flesh, it's manifested, vindicated, just
[1:42:39] what the Bible said would happen in this
[1:42:42] day. It's happening.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He prophesied of it all
[1:42:47] the way back in the Old Testament that
[1:42:49] there would be a time that God would be
[1:42:51] manifested in the flesh. And he was in
[1:42:55] the flesh of Jesus. But he's not in a
[1:42:57] grave tonight in Jerusalem. He's not in
[1:43:00] a tomb in Jeffersonville. But there was
[1:43:02] a forecast that the same God that was in
[1:43:05] Jesus. The same God that was in the
[1:43:07] upper room has come down in this last
[1:43:10] day and has become veiled in the flesh
[1:43:13] of his bride. Oh, he said we're near the
[1:43:15] coming of Jesus to be united with the
[1:43:18] church where the word becomes the word.
[1:43:20] Call the heart, the spirit searching the
[1:43:22] hearts. Now I'll say it very beautiful
[1:43:24] because what Pentecostal said was going
[1:43:26] to happen.
[1:43:29] A prophet stood on the platform and he
[1:43:31] said it's happening. In other words,
[1:43:34] it's happening right before you. And he
[1:43:36] says in the name of the Lord that's by
[1:43:38] the original word. Now I love this
[1:43:40] because because I want you to see
[1:43:42] tonight how how powerful you are all the
[1:43:46] way back in the book of Isaiah. Isaiah
[1:43:48] prophesies in Isaiah 64 and verse4 and
[1:43:51] he says now for since the beginning of
[1:43:53] the world men have not heard nor
[1:43:56] perceived by the ear neither hath the
[1:43:58] eyes seen oh God beside thee what he
[1:44:03] hath prepared for him that waiteth for
[1:44:06] him. Now do you realize that was a
[1:44:08] prophecy in Isaiah 64. But if you come
[1:44:11] here to to second to 1 Corinthians 2 and
[1:44:13] verse 9, Paul's going to say, "As it is
[1:44:16] written,
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; I hath not seen
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; nor ear heard, neither have it entered
[1:44:21] in the heart of man, the things which
[1:44:23] God hath prepared for them that love
[1:44:25] him." Now watch back there. They were
[1:44:28] saying, "It's coming." Paul rehearses
[1:44:30] that prophecy. But then in verse 10, he
[1:44:33] says, "But God hath revealed them unto
[1:44:36] us by his spirit. For the spirit
[1:44:38] searches all things, yay, the deep
[1:44:41] things of God. I love this in the
[1:44:43] Amplified Bible. But is just as it is
[1:44:45] written in scripture, things which the
[1:44:47] eye has not seen, the ear has not heard,
[1:44:49] which have not entered the heart of man.
[1:44:51] All that God has prepared for those who
[1:44:53] love him. Listen, who hold him in
[1:44:56] affectionate reverence, who obey him,
[1:44:59] are you ready for this? And who
[1:45:01] gratefully recognize the benefits that
[1:45:04] he has bestowed. So in other words, the
[1:45:06] prophet of God is saying, "Give us
[1:45:08] freedom, Lord, in the spirit that your
[1:45:10] worship and children might get the
[1:45:11] privilege tonight to enjoy the deep rich
[1:45:15] blessings of the Holy Ghost." He said,
[1:45:17] "May they have uncction and strength and
[1:45:19] power to bring to their congregation,
[1:45:21] the waiting sheep, the food that God has
[1:45:25] in store for his people." He says, "We
[1:45:27] are grateful for these takes exaltations
[1:45:29] from the spirit. They tell us and warn
[1:45:31] us." He said, "We don't know just what
[1:45:32] he has in store for us, but we do know
[1:45:34] that there must be something that he's
[1:45:37] going to bring forth." Look, in 1961,
[1:45:40] there is a people who knows and feels
[1:45:42] and is waiting. They feel the charge.
[1:45:45] They have the hunger. They have the pull
[1:45:47] that God is going to bring something
[1:45:49] forth. He said, "Now listen, maybe his
[1:45:51] question on your mind. He'll speak it
[1:45:52] through here. He might speak to the
[1:45:54] message this morning. He might speak it
[1:45:56] tonight at the service." He's somewhere
[1:45:58] along today. He's trying to look like
[1:46:00] warn someone to catch the word. Come on,
[1:46:04] church. He's trying to get you, Amen, to
[1:46:07] catch the word. I love what Paul says.
[1:46:09] He says, "Who hath believed our report?"
[1:46:11] Do you know another word for report?
[1:46:14] Do you know what Paul said? He said, "We
[1:46:16] now have the mind of Christ." He said,
[1:46:19] "What was once in God's mind is now in
[1:46:22] the body of Christ." Who is the body of
[1:46:25] Christ? You are the body of Christ.
[1:46:29] Amen. He said, "Now watch. I got a
[1:46:31] question for you. How did what was in
[1:46:33] God's mind get into God's body." Can I
[1:46:36] say it like this? By the preaching or
[1:46:39] the transmitting of the vision or the
[1:46:41] forecast. He said, "Now, we are only
[1:46:44] transmitters that transmits the voice of
[1:46:46] God." Amen. Through our agency of men to
[1:46:49] the hearer. He said, "A vision is the
[1:46:51] same way. I know nothing to say to the
[1:46:53] church at this time concerning a vision.
[1:46:55] But if the Holy Spirit would show first
[1:46:57] me a vision, then I will transmit that
[1:47:00] vision to the one that it's directed to.
[1:47:04] Folks, this is not a universal vision.
[1:47:06] This is not a universal forecast. This
[1:47:09] is not a group broadcast. This is a
[1:47:11] predestinated sovereignty of almighty
[1:47:14] God. This is the fulfillment of the
[1:47:17] prophecy of grace when the revelation
[1:47:19] would be revealed. Glory to God. When
[1:47:21] the revelation would be revealed, there
[1:47:23] would be a grace on standby to deliver
[1:47:27] that revelation into the heart of the
[1:47:29] ones who is going to manifest it.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Oh church, don't you see who you are
[1:47:34] tonight? You're not just church members.
[1:47:37] You are the manifestation of the
[1:47:40] forecast of almighty God.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; It was not me. The vision was not me. I
[1:47:48] it was God gave the vision.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I acted as a transmitter. Look to bring
[1:47:55] forth. Are you ready for this? The
[1:47:58] message of the vision to the people.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, then I can say to you tonight, it's
[1:48:05] the message
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; of the hour
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; that transforms you. Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "How could you a drunkard a few
[1:48:12] weeks ago or a few months ago and a
[1:48:13] gentleman this afternoon? How could you
[1:48:15] a street harlot a few weeks ago and a
[1:48:16] lady this afternoon
[1:48:19] by the transforming power of God being
[1:48:22] transmitted by the Holy Ghost into your
[1:48:24] heart changed your nature and changed
[1:48:28] your making. Are you ready for this? It
[1:48:31] made you another person."
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet of God said?
[1:48:36] He said God in his mercy gave you
[1:48:38] another sense.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; He said and then the new birth activates
[1:48:42] that super sense.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; That six sense
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; church of the living God.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; That six sense coming from the mercy of
[1:48:52] God
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; into the soul of a believer quickened by
[1:48:55] the power of God has made you another
[1:48:58] person.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. You might not have felt
[1:49:02] it. I don't know about that. But it's
[1:49:04] here anyhow. Whether you feel it or not,
[1:49:07] let's give God thanks for it. It's here
[1:49:09] anyhow.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, I say to you tonight, and I say
[1:49:13] this in closing, Amen. Amen. The
[1:49:16] forecast says your present conditions
[1:49:18] cannot hinder your future.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; The forecast says your present
[1:49:27] conditions
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; cannot hinder your future.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Can I say this to you?
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You have the forecast in you. Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You have the forecast in you. Brother
[1:49:41] said, look, he said, there's an old
[1:49:42] blind woman speaking of Anna in the
[1:49:43] corner by the name of Anna who served
[1:49:45] the Lord day and night. She was, now
[1:49:46] listen, she also was predicting and
[1:49:50] saying the Messiah is coming. Now, are
[1:49:53] you with me?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Blind Anna,
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; saying
[1:49:59] I see
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; blind Anna.
[1:50:05] saying, "I see the Messiah coming."
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Reb said, "Yet she was blind."
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Blind Anna
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; said, "I see the Messiah coming, yet
[1:50:23] she's blind." He said, "Now listen, but
[1:50:26] that little life that was in her,
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; that little life that was in her that
[1:50:33] was predicting, glory to God."
[1:50:35] Hallelujah. It was predicting he's
[1:50:38] coming, he's coming, it'll be here. Then
[1:50:41] that same life, that like come in the
[1:50:43] building. He said, "See, it was for
[1:50:45] ordained to lie." Can I say it to you?
[1:50:47] She had a seed in her church.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, she did. And the seed that she had
[1:50:52] in her was predicting
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; the future.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Her present conditions
[1:51:00] could not stop the future
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; fulfillment.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Can I say to you tonight as the
[1:51:06] musicians come, maybe you're like Job.
[1:51:09] Maybe you're sitting on the ash heap
[1:51:10] tonight. Everything's gone wrong. You're
[1:51:13] at your wits end. Everything possibly
[1:51:17] that could go wrong has gone wrong. and
[1:51:20] you're sitting there and you're looking
[1:51:21] around and you're saying, "Lord, I don't
[1:51:23] know. Can I tell you tonight, God has
[1:51:26] come down in this meeting?"
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or not.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or not, he has come
[1:51:38] down.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And he is here to impart into you
[1:51:42] another sense.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; It's his mercy
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; to give you another sense. Beyond what
[1:51:50] you see,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; beyond what you can reason,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; beyond what you can remember,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; beyond what you feel,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; beyond what you hear.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:52:03] it's beyond feelings, folks.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; See, it's another dimension.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; It's a six sense.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; It's a vision.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; And it's been spoken over your life
[1:52:18] tonight. Won't you won't you stand to
[1:52:19] your feet with us this
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; evenus?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Brother said it beautiful.
[1:52:26] He said now the forecast paraphrasing
[1:52:30] he will show you things to come.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; He said oh there's been many fanatics
[1:52:34] went out but it's only the devil trying
[1:52:35] to put a blinder. He said oh yeah
[1:52:38] there's a there's a real genuine Holy
[1:52:40] Spirit. He said oh it's the devil's
[1:52:42] business to put out those things. He did
[1:52:44] it before the coming of Jesus. He said,
[1:52:46] ' But there was coming a real Jesus, and
[1:52:48] the real Jesus arrived on the scene.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; No matter how many fanatics come in the
[1:52:54] first place and tried to do this and do
[1:52:56] that to impersonate, it only was a
[1:52:58] signpost that the real genuine Jesus was
[1:53:02] coming.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Then when he come, they recognized him.
[1:53:08] He said many of them who were waiting,
[1:53:09] they recognized him. And today, we've
[1:53:12] had a lot of fanaticism out under the
[1:53:13] name of this, that, and the other. But
[1:53:15] it's only been a signpost to point that
[1:53:18] real the Lord Jesus and the real Holy
[1:53:21] Ghost revival would be here soon. We've
[1:53:24] lived in it. We're in it now.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; You're sinning in it this afternoon.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; It's all around you.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; See, isn't that something? We were
[1:53:40] looking for revival,
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; but a prophet come on the scene. Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And so the revival you're looking for,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; you're sitting in it
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; right now.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; It's all around you.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; But I don't feel it. Well, this is not a
[1:53:58] feeling revival.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't sense it. This is not a
[1:54:02] sense revival.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; This is another sense revival.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; This is a faith revival. Yes.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; This is a revival that's built on the
[1:54:12] foundation of a vindicated vision.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, the Holy Spirit, when
[1:54:16] he has come, he will lead and guide you
[1:54:17] into all truth. He will show you things
[1:54:19] that is to come." He said, "Now listen,
[1:54:22] when that real genuine faith has caught
[1:54:23] the vision, it can keep silent and rest
[1:54:26] calmly because it knows it's going to
[1:54:29] happen. Don't forget that
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; faith will rest with perfect
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; assurance."
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I don't know what you're
[1:54:38] going through tonight, but I got a word
[1:54:40] for you from the word of the Lord.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; God in his mercies come down and give
[1:54:44] you another sense.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; And if you'll allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:54:48] activate that faith in your heart,
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; it'll cause you to look beyond the way
[1:54:52] you feel right now.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; It'll cause you to look beyond the
[1:54:55] problems and the cons and the concerns
[1:54:57] and the situ. It'll cause you to look
[1:54:59] beyond all of that.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; And it'll cause you to look upward and
[1:55:03] onward.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; And it'll cause you to confess like Job
[1:55:06] did.
[1:55:07] I know my redeemer lives.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; My condition right now says there's no
[1:55:13] way I'll see him.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; But in my flesh,
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; I shall see God.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Well, no way I can make it in
[1:55:24] your flesh right now, but in my soul,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; I have another sense
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; and a vision has been spoke over it.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And you know what it says?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; I've already seen you there. Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; So, what are you going to believe
[1:55:39] tonight?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; You going to believe a man's idea?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; You going to believe what your five
[1:55:44] outer senses are telling you or your
[1:55:45] five inner senses?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I say there's a bride on the earth
[1:55:49] tonight
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; who's living
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; by another sense.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; How many say, "Lord, impart that sense
[1:55:55] into my heart."
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, realign my heart.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe I can't feel it. Maybe I can't
[1:56:02] memorize it. Maybe I can't think about
[1:56:04] it. Maybe I can't remember it. That
[1:56:05] don't matter Lord in your mercy
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; the same as you did Job
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; right here on this ash heap
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; give me that other sense
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; see that other sense will cause you to
[1:56:18] see your kids coming back to church
[1:56:20] before they actually come
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; you know that
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; that other sense will make you testify
[1:56:26] I'm healed before one symptom changes
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; that other sense will make you testify
[1:56:34] he's in control
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; when everything around you is falling
[1:56:38] apart.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; See, because it's a vindicated vision.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; It's a vindicated forecast.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you bow your hearts with us
[1:56:46] tonight?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; How many say, Lord, I thank you for that
[1:56:50] other sense.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray you give me the grace
[1:56:54] tonight to live by that other sense.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to live by the outer
[1:56:59] senses.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to live by the inner
[1:57:02] senses.
[1:57:04] Lord, they can lie to me.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; But there is a super sense
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; and it's the faith of God sense
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; and that sense cannot lie.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; It catches the word of God.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; It delivers the word of God.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I bring this congregation
[1:57:22] of believers into your presence.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Father, your word has gone forth in the
[1:57:27] sanctuary tonight.
[1:57:29] And Lord, I know that as human beings,
[1:57:31] as believers of like precious faith,
[1:57:34] Lord, as Christians, Lord, we're facing
[1:57:37] so many things, Lord. Father, situations
[1:57:40] and things that seem hopeless and
[1:57:42] helpless, Father.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; But Lord, there is a revelation anchored
[1:57:46] in the depths of our soul tonight.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; That Lord, though all hell sail,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; it will not prevail. Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, though we be at our wits end,
[1:57:57] Lord,
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Father, though we would set on the ash
[1:58:00] heap as Job did, Lord, though we would
[1:58:03] sit there, dear God, burdened in our
[1:58:05] hearts, sometimes empty in our spirits,
[1:58:08] Lord, though we would look at our mortal
[1:58:11] bodies, we would look at the mortal
[1:58:13] conditions, Lord, and Father, everything
[1:58:16] would seem to be fading and be gone. But
[1:58:19] Lord, I'm so thankful that underneath
[1:58:20] that flesh.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; And Lord, underneath that spirit,
[1:58:24] there's a soul.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; And Lord, that soul cries out. I know my
[1:58:28] redeemer liveth.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; I know I'm a part of this word.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; I know I have a theophony.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; I know I'm going in the rapture.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; I know my children are going to be
[1:58:39] saved.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; I know my body is going to be healed.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; I know that God is going to give me the
[1:58:45] Holy Ghost. I know I'm going to be a
[1:58:47] partaker of that great resurrection.
[1:58:50] Father, it's gone beyond the control of
[1:58:52] flesh realm, beyond the control of
[1:58:54] spirit realm, Lord, over into the soul
[1:58:57] realm. Now, Father, I pray tonight, dear
[1:59:00] God, that your anointing would sweep
[1:59:01] across this building.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, we've not come here this weekend
[1:59:05] for just another meeting, as we've
[1:59:06] already said. But Lord God, we've come
[1:59:09] here to be transformed by the renewing
[1:59:11] of our minds. Father, I pray tonight,
[1:59:13] dear God, on the first night of this
[1:59:15] meeting, Lord, Father, if the believers
[1:59:17] can catch the word, dear God, if they
[1:59:20] can catch the reality that you've come
[1:59:22] down in your mercy, and Lord God, you've
[1:59:25] given them another sense, then Lord,
[1:59:27] they can have a meeting right here this
[1:59:29] weekend. No matter what's going wrong,
[1:59:32] no matter the doctor's report, no matter
[1:59:34] the lies, the indifferences, the voices
[1:59:36] of confusion, no matter what the devil
[1:59:38] throw against this people, if in their
[1:59:41] soul resides the revelation that I have
[1:59:44] been given another sense, and it's a
[1:59:46] perfect sense, and it's a super sense,
[1:59:49] and it's a superior sense, it's a
[1:59:52] guiding sense, it's a governing sense,
[1:59:55] then Lord, I'm going to break out of
[1:59:56] this earthbound sense. I'm going to
[1:59:58] break out of this earthbound realm. I'm
[2:00:00] going to climb up into that realm where
[2:00:02] all things are possible. Father, I'm
[2:00:04] tired of this earthbound realm. I'm
[2:00:06] tired of this chatter, chatter, chatter.
[2:00:08] I'm tired of the confusions, Lord. I'm
[2:00:10] tired of the mind battles, dear God. I'm
[2:00:13] tired of the devil waring against me.
[2:00:15] I'm ready to draw my sword and break out
[2:00:18] in that realm to believe you, Lord, to
[2:00:20] believe your word, to believe what
[2:00:23] you've spoken. Father, may you come in
[2:00:25] this meeting this weekend. Lord, may the
[2:00:28] believers set themselves aside, Lord.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Father, lift the pressure off of their
[2:00:32] hearts. Lift the pressure off of their
[2:00:34] lives, dear God.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, give them the liberty to enjoy
[2:00:38] these meetings, Lord.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Give them the liberty to enjoy your
[2:00:41] presence.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, give them the liberty to know that
[2:00:44] this is not a burden, Father. It's a
[2:00:47] blessing. Lord,
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; your presence, Lord,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; means heaven to us.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. strengthen every job in this
[2:00:56] building tonight, Lord.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; we pray.
[2:01:06] Amen. You love him tonight.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You ready for a meeting?
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; You're ready for the power of the Holy
[2:01:13] Spirit.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:01:15] till tomorrow night.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; I don't think you got to wait till
[2:01:18] Sunday morning.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I believe if there's another sense in
[2:01:21] your heart right now, You can begin to
[2:01:25] declare the word of God.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; You can begin to confess the promises of
[2:01:29] God.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not just the speaking of
[2:01:31] clothes, friends.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; This is not just the rehearsing of
[2:01:35] scriptures.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; This is the word
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; in action
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; in your flesh.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you tonight?
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; You are part of the forecast.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; God is your vindicator
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; and God is your redeemer. Brother Barry,
[2:01:50] would you come tonight? Amen. I believe
[2:01:52] and I believe he's in the building
[2:01:53] tonight. Don't you?
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God rich bless you.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:06:31] Amen. I have so much to say, I'm not
[2:06:34] going to say very much. It's 9:30. It's
[2:06:37] Friday night, though. And where else
[2:06:39] would we be? What else could we be doing
[2:06:42] in this world that we live in?
[2:06:46] Just two thoughts that I'm going to say
[2:06:48] tonight
[2:06:49] is that our present conditions
[2:06:53] not just won't but cannot
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; cannot dictate our future
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; if we truly are sons and daughters of
[2:07:04] God.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; We need to let that sixth sense guide
[2:07:08] us. Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; I just think it's a wonderful thing. You
[2:07:12] know, one thing really struck me tonight
[2:07:15] is that we literally being able to say
[2:07:19] amen to this word because it's what we
[2:07:21] live. It's who we it's the essence of
[2:07:24] our lives.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to catch the vision,
[2:07:27] brothers and sisters. There's people in
[2:07:29] this world in this message that are
[2:07:31] saying, "Catch the vision." But I want
[2:07:33] to say this. What we were hearing
[2:07:35] tonight is catch this. You are the
[2:07:38] vision.
[2:07:39] You are the literal manifestation of the
[2:07:42] word for the day in which we live.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; What a glorious word.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; My
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; can we sing the move is on.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Sing a couple songs, three songs
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; and then we'll dismiss. I know we have
[2:07:57] to go. If you have to go, the move is
[2:07:59] on. You're welcome to leave. God richly
[2:08:02] bless you. We've got service tomorrow
[2:08:03] night at 6:00 and uh regular service
[2:08:07] time. Regular service time, Sunday
[2:08:09] morning, 10:00. The move is on, my Lord,
[2:08:14] the move is on.
[2:08:17] The move is on, my Lord, the move on.
[2:08:22] Oh, I can hear the rustle in the mberry
[2:08:28] tree. And I know, I know, I know the
[2:08:31] moon is on.
[2:08:34] Move on, brother. Move on sister. This
[2:08:40] is the day. Hallelujah.
[2:08:45] Oh move closer. Where the streams are
[2:08:50] going
[2:08:52] on, brother. Move on. The move is on.
[2:08:58] Lord, the move is on.
[2:09:01] The move is on. My Lord is on.
[2:09:07] You hear the rustle in the mberry trees
[2:09:13] and I know I know I know the move is on.
[2:09:18] So move on brother. Move on sister. This
[2:09:25] is the day. Hallelujah.
[2:09:29] [Applause]
[2:09:31] closer where the streams are blowing
[2:09:36] on brother.
[2:09:40] Hallelujah.
[2:09:42] Hallelujah. Can we sing faithful one?
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Faithful one.
[2:09:50] Oh faithful
[2:09:53] one, so unchanging,
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:10:02] aless
[2:10:04] one. You're my rock
[2:10:09] of peace.
[2:10:12] Lord
[2:10:14] of all,
[2:10:16] I depend on you.
[2:10:24] I call out to you.
[2:10:30] Again and again
[2:10:35] I call out to you
[2:10:41] again and again.
[2:10:46] You are my rock.
[2:10:50] [Music]
[2:10:54] [Applause]
[2:10:57] You lift me up
[2:11:03] when I fall down.
[2:11:07] Oh, all through the storm.
[2:11:12] Your love
[2:11:16] is
[2:11:18] the anchor.
[2:11:24] My hope is in you.
[2:11:30] You are my rock.
[2:11:33] You are my rock.
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:44] You lift me up
[2:11:50] when I fall down.
[2:11:54] All through the snow,
[2:11:59] your love
[2:12:03] is
[2:12:05] the end.
[2:12:10] My heart
[2:12:12] is in
[2:12:16] the
[2:12:19] I feel the pull. Do you feel the pull?
[2:12:22] Did you feel the pull tonight?
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; A pull from your theophony. Not a pull
[2:12:26] from a man. Not a pull from a ministry,
[2:12:30] but a pull from that vision that was
[2:12:33] forecast. That vision that was
[2:12:36] prophesied.
[2:12:37] My
[2:12:40] at night I lay in bed and I begin to
[2:12:46] cry.
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:51] And my mind just fails to know exactly
[2:12:59] why.
[2:13:02] You can't explain it.
[2:13:06] With tongue or pain, the spirit is
[2:13:11] growing deep within.
[2:13:15] It must be God right here in my soul.
[2:13:21] Cuz I feel the P.
[2:13:27] I feel the
[2:13:31] [Applause]
[2:13:33] I hear the call.
[2:13:40] And God's spirit is moving me to give my
[2:13:47] all.
[2:13:51] He speaks to me
[2:13:57] and I agree.
[2:14:04] Please come and take control.
[2:14:09] I heal the Lord.
[2:14:15] I went to hear the word
[2:14:20] and with each line and phrase.
[2:14:25] Was he calling you tonight?
[2:14:29] calling me to give a higher praise.
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:14:42] Call to the deep. It's like
[2:14:49] holy.
[2:14:52] Oh, I know for sure.
[2:14:56] [Applause]
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] Hear the
[2:15:07] [Music]
[2:15:10] I hear the
[2:15:16] Lord. Your spirit
[2:15:19] moving
[2:15:21] me to give my all
[2:15:30] to me. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:15:34] And I
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:41] Lord, please come and take control.
[2:15:47] I feel
[2:15:52] Let's just bow. Gracious heavenly
[2:15:54] father, Lord Jesus, we thank you.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, one more time
[2:16:01] for coming by our way.
[2:16:04] Oh father for sending your servant Lord
[2:16:07] with a a burden on his heart Lord Jesus.
[2:16:11] Father for this very night we know that
[2:16:14] this very night was no accident. This
[2:16:16] was a night that was ordained before the
[2:16:18] foundation of the world to Lord Jesus
[2:16:21] have some seed sown and some seed
[2:16:24] germinate and some seed grow and other
[2:16:27] seed to mature.
[2:16:29] Oh, Father, it's no accident that we're
[2:16:31] here tonight listening to the words that
[2:16:33] were spoken. Help us, Lord, to take
[2:16:36] those words into our soul and Lord
[2:16:39] Jesus, process them not by our emotions
[2:16:42] and not by our senses, even on the inner
[2:16:45] senses, Lord, but let us, Lord Jesus,
[2:16:48] surrender all of our senses to that
[2:16:50] sixth sense.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; And take the words that were spoken
[2:16:54] tonight and run them through that sixth
[2:16:56] sense and see if they're not real.
[2:17:00] Father, we thank you, Lord, that you
[2:17:02] prophesied through your your prophet
[2:17:05] that there would be a time that there
[2:17:07] would be a day where the word would
[2:17:09] become flesh and the flesh would become
[2:17:12] word. Oh, Father, we're so thankful that
[2:17:15] there's some people in this world that
[2:17:16] can recognize the position of that word
[2:17:19] tonight.
[2:17:21] Lord, we just ask that you would go with
[2:17:22] us now as we go our separate ways.
[2:17:24] Father, we pray that you would restore
[2:17:27] the strength to Brother Andrew. Lord,
[2:17:29] and Father, if it be your will for us to
[2:17:31] gather again tomorrow night, Lord Jesus,
[2:17:33] help us, Father, to to bring that vision
[2:17:36] to the house of the Lord. Oh, Father,
[2:17:39] let us bring your presence with us,
[2:17:41] Lord. Father, there might be someone
[2:17:43] seeking your presence and let them feel
[2:17:45] it, Father, like they never have before.
[2:17:48] Lord, we love you and we thank you. We
[2:17:50] just want to commit each life into your
[2:17:51] hand now as we go our separate ways.
[2:17:54] Father, we know many people are missing
[2:17:56] tonight. And Father, we pray that you
[2:17:58] would just be with them wherever they
[2:17:59] are, whatever they're doing. Father, and
[2:18:02] Lord, we just, Father, we thank you for
[2:18:05] your goodness and your mercy to us. We
[2:18:08] just ask all these things now in Jesus
[2:18:10] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Can
[2:18:15] we sing that song? I love you, Lord, for
[2:18:18] your mercy never fails me.
[2:18:22] As we dismiss tonight, I love you, Lord,
[2:18:28] for your mercy
[2:18:30] never fails me.
[2:18:34] All my days
[2:18:37] I've been held in your hands.
[2:18:42] From the moment that I wake up
[2:18:46] until I lay my head,
[2:18:50] I will sing of the goodness
[2:18:54] of God.
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:19:00] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:19:07] And all my life you have been so so
[2:19:12] good.
[2:19:15] With every breath that I have made,
[2:19:21] I will sing of the goodness
[2:19:25] of God.
[2:19:28] I love your voice.
[2:19:32] You have led me through the fire
[2:19:37] in darkest night.
[2:19:40] You are close like no other.
[2:19:45] I know you as a father.
[2:19:49] I know you as a friend.
[2:19:53] I have lived in the goodness
[2:19:57] of God.
[2:20:02] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:20:10] And all my life you have been so so
[2:20:15] good.
[2:20:17] With every breath that I am able,
[2:20:23] I will sing of the goodness
[2:20:27] of God.
[2:20:32] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:20:35] running after me.
[2:20:39] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:20:43] running after me. With my life laid
[2:20:47] down, I've surrendered now. I give you
[2:20:51] everything.
[2:20:54] Your goodness is running after.
[2:20:58] Amen. God bless you tonight. All my
[2:21:01] life.
[2:21:04] All my life.
