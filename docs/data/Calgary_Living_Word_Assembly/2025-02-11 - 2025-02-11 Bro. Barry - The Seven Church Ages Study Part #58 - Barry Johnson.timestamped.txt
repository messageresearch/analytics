[36:21] do with
[36:23] it tonight we're going to carry on in
[36:25] our discussion in the Leo Ian Church age
[36:29] out of the exposition of the seven
[36:30] Church ages before we do that just a few
[36:33] announcements we have brother Cadre here

[36:40] Saturday we have a breakfast Saturday

[36:50] questions about that then we have uh
[36:53] regular service on Sunday with brother
[36:55] Cadre and we will have the youth at our

[37:01] excited for what the Lord will do there

[37:07] canceled the regular Wednesday evening
[37:09] service for the men's meeting the annual

[37:17] Wednesday will be the men's meeting and

[37:23] 12th 13th 14th basically the middle of
[37:26] September we have brother Andrew Glover
[37:28] coming here um I think I forgot to
[37:31] mention this on Sunday I can't remember
[37:32] whether I did or not but uh I had a note
[37:35] from brother mvin that the tax receipts
[37:37] for qualified donations received in 2024
[37:41] by
[37:43] clwa will be issued on the week of
[37:45] February the
[37:46] 17th so if you're looking for a tax
[37:49] receipt that will be coming and uh we
[37:52] certainly are thankful that we're able
[37:54] to donate that way
[37:57] are you happy
[37:59] tonight picking up from where we left
[38:01] off last week I uh I just think it's
[38:04] wonderful to look at this it's not
[38:06] wonderful to look at what necessarily we
[38:09] were studying but it's wonderful to look
[38:10] at our position as Believers brother
[38:13] Bram talks about the condition in this
[38:15] age how there's more money there's more
[38:17] convenience there's more ease of
[38:20] living but there's way less quality of
[38:23] life there's way more stress there's way
[38:26] more anxiety there's way more fear
[38:29] there's way more illness there's way
[38:31] more problems than there should be and
[38:35] brother Bram he says it's without a
[38:37] known reason inside is a Dark Void
[38:42] Cavern that is crying out in torment and
[38:45] without a reason men's hearts are
[38:47] failing for
[38:48] fear and the world is so darkened that
[38:52] this age could well be called the age of
[38:56] neurotics if it boasts but it cannot
[38:59] come back can it cannot back it up it
[39:02] cries peace and there is no peace it
[39:06] cries that it has a great amplitude of
[39:09] all things but it keeps burning with
[39:11] desire like an unsatisfied fire there is
[39:15] no peace saith my God to the wicked
[39:19] Isaiah
[39:22] 57:21 they are
[39:24] miserable that means that they are
[39:26] object to be pied pied they scorn pity
[39:31] they are full of
[39:33] Pride they vaunt what they
[39:36] have but what they have will not stand
[39:39] the test of time they have built upon
[39:42] quicksand rather than the rock of
[39:45] revelation of God's word it's
[39:48] interesting that he calls it quicksand
[39:50] because it's almost like fast food isn't
[39:52] it if you've ever looked at the way
[39:54] services are in uh different churches
[39:57] and you know we certainly don't want to
[39:59] compare ourselves but I've heard it said
[40:01] many times that some services are mostly
[40:04] shows with 15 minutes of of discussion
[40:07] on some
[40:10] scripture but uh he says that they're
[40:13] built on quicksand not the revelation of
[40:15] God's word soon cometh the earthquake
[40:18] soon there will come the storms of the
[40:21] wrath of God in judgment then comes
[40:24] sudden destruction and in spite of all
[40:26] their carnal preparation creation they
[40:28] will still be unprepared for what comes
[40:31] upon the
[40:32] Earth they are those who in spite of all
[40:35] their worldly efforts are actually
[40:38] opposing themselves and don't know it
[40:42] objects of pity are they
[40:45] indeed pity the poor people who are LED
[40:48] in this last day ecumenical move for
[40:52] they call it the move of God when it is
[40:54] of Satan pity those who do not know the
[40:57] curse of
[40:59] organization pity those who have so many
[41:02] beautiful churches such lovely
[41:04] parsonages such grandly trained choirs
[41:08] such a show of wealth and such a sedate
[41:11] and reverent form of worship pity them
[41:15] don't envy
[41:16] them back to the old store buildings
[41:19] back to the dimly lit rooms back to the
[41:22] sellers back to less of the world and
[41:26] more of God
[41:28] pity those who make their great claims
[41:30] and talk about their
[41:31] gifts feel for them as objects of pity
[41:34] for soon they will be objects of
[41:38] Wrath he talks about they are
[41:42] poor now of course that means
[41:44] spiritually poor and we talked about it
[41:47] a little bit earlier last time about how
[41:49] brother bradam mentioned bankruptcy
[41:52] they're bankrupt and you know we can
[41:55] look at that financially but but he's
[41:57] talking spiritually spiritually bankrupt
[42:01] many many people are spiritually
[42:03] bankrupt they simply come to church on
[42:06] the weekends maybe the middle of the
[42:07] week and that's all they do there's no
[42:10] prayer meetings there's no time spent in
[42:13] the word there's
[42:15] no
[42:16] dedication to a one-on-one relationship
[42:19] with the Lord Jesus Christ and if we're
[42:21] not investing that way in our lives then
[42:24] what we're doing is bankrupting
[42:26] ourselves spiritually we become
[42:29] spiritually poor brother Bram says they
[42:31] are poor now of course that means
[42:33] spiritually poor the sign of this age as
[42:36] it closes is bigger and better churches
[42:39] with more and more people with more and
[42:41] more manifestation of what is supposed
[42:44] to be denominations of the Holy Ghost
[42:48] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost sorry
[42:50] but the filled altars and gifts of the
[42:53] Spirit in
[42:54] operation the remarkable attendance is
[42:57] not the answer from God for those who
[42:59] come to the altars very seldom stay to
[43:02] go on with God and after the great
[43:05] campaigns are finished where are all
[43:08] those who came down the aisles they
[43:11] heard a man they listened to an appeal
[43:14] they came into the net but were not fish
[43:17] and turtle likee they crawled back to
[43:19] their own
[43:21] Waters then there is all this talk about
[43:25] glossia
[43:27] it is supposed to be the evidence of the
[43:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are
[43:31] thinking that we are in the midst of a
[43:33] great Revival the Revival is over the
[43:36] Vindicated Prophet for our age we can
[43:39] look back at Luther and say he he could
[43:41] potentially have declared it maybe
[43:43] Wesley maybe Paul but here we have the
[43:46] prophet in our age saying the Revival is
[43:50] over America had her last chance in
[43:54] 1957 now the T of go are God's sign of
[43:59] impending
[44:00] disaster even as they were when they
[44:03] appeared upon the wall at belshazzar's
[44:06] feast and remember there was nobody
[44:09] there to interpret those words the king
[44:12] couldn't understand them although they
[44:14] were there all of the host in the room
[44:17] couldn't understand them although all of
[44:19] them were there there was only one that
[44:22] could understand those words and that
[44:23] was the Vindicated prophet in that day
[44:28] don't you know that many are going to
[44:30] come in the last day and sayl
[44:33] Lord have we not done many wonderful
[44:35] Works in thy name even to the casting
[44:37] out of
[44:38] devils and he will say depart from me ye
[44:42] that work iniquity I never knew you
[44:45] there was no intimacy there was no
[44:47] relationship you knew what to do and
[44:49] never did it and you knew what not to do
[44:51] but yet you still did
[44:53] it I never knew you Jesus said they were
[44:57] workers of iniquity yet you get a man
[45:00] that can come and pray for the sick get
[45:03] oil and blood appearing in the
[45:06] congregation prophecy coming forth and
[45:09] all manner of the
[45:11] Supernatural and the people will gather
[45:13] around him and swear that he is of the
[45:17] Lord even though he is actually making a
[45:22] money racket of religion and living in
[45:25] sin
[45:27] now I just want to be clear about this
[45:30] there's some people who are very good
[45:32] people that would probably fit the
[45:33] description that we just read but what
[45:36] is
[45:37] sin let's be clear it's not
[45:40] necessarily uh living immorally it's not
[45:44] necessarily not going to church or or
[45:47] doing things in the flesh that's not
[45:50] necessarily Sin Sin according to the
[45:52] prophet is
[45:54] unbelief unbelieving the word of a vind
[45:57] ated
[45:58] Prophet would become
[46:00] sin the only reason they have is the
[46:05] absolutely unbiblical answer of well he
[46:09] gets results so he must be of God how
[46:12] terrible how actually poor this age is
[46:16] in the spirit of God and the poor
[46:19] poverty-stricken ones don't even know
[46:24] it it truly is a blessing to know it
[46:28] isn't it it really is it's something
[46:30] that God has given us it's a
[46:34] gift you are blind and naked now this is
[46:37] really
[46:37] desperate how can anyone be blind and
[46:40] naked and not know it yet it says that
[46:43] they are blind and naked and can't
[46:46] perceive
[46:47] it the answer is they are spiritually
[46:51] blind and spiritually
[46:54] naked do you remember when Elisha
[46:57] and gazi were surrounded by the army of
[47:00] the
[47:02] syrians you know remember that
[47:06] story of Elisha and his servant Elisha
[47:09] was resting the prophet was at rest he
[47:11] knew he was in
[47:12] control but the servant opened the
[47:15] window to take in some sunlight maybe
[47:17] first thing in the morning and he looked
[47:18] around and he saw the enemy the syrians
[47:20] were everywhere they were surrounded
[47:23] they were under siege and what happened
[47:26] he panicked
[47:27] but the prophet turned and said to
[47:31] himl open the boy's eyes let him see
[47:34] there's way more for us than there is
[47:37] against
[47:39] us even the servant of the Lord was
[47:43] blind but it took the words of the
[47:45] Prophet to open his eyes it's so
[47:48] powerful brother bradam says you recall
[47:51] that Elisha smote them Blind by the
[47:53] power of God Elisha didn't hide in the
[47:56] house
[47:57] he went right out to meet him and said
[47:59] who you looking for what's up the man
[48:02] they were looking for was bold and
[48:05] courageous in the face of his enemy he
[48:08] had no fear he knew God was in complete
[48:10] control it was through the power of God
[48:13] yet their eyes were wide open and they
[48:16] could see where they were
[48:18] going I I remember preaching on this
[48:20] story it uh it's a powerful story when
[48:23] you think about it because these were
[48:25] trained soldiers
[48:27] but they were blind but their eyes were
[48:30] open they were able to lead them and
[48:33] they took them right back into captivity
[48:36] and we know that the the the captors
[48:38] they wanted to do something to them and
[48:40] came and asked the prophet and the
[48:42] prophet said no no no we we actually
[48:44] prepare a table in the midst of our
[48:46] enemies we don't destroy them feed them
[48:49] treat them nicely and what happened
[48:51] because of that he actually changed
[48:53] turned the behavior of the syrians they
[48:56] became allies out of it but brother bami
[49:00] says here the blindness was peculiar and
[49:02] that they could see certain
[49:05] things but other certain things such as
[49:08] Elisha and the servant and the camp of
[49:11] Israel they could not see what this Army
[49:15] could not see did not Avail for them
[49:18] what they did not see brought on their
[49:22] captivity brothers and sisters today
[49:25] tonight what we cannot see can bring on
[49:28] on our own
[49:30] captivity we're not just reading this
[49:32] book about some other people out there
[49:35] we're comparing ourselves to this book
[49:37] here there's things that can be
[49:39] happening in our lives that we can't see
[49:41] and we need to pray and ask God to show
[49:43] us help us to see the things that could
[49:47] create our own
[49:49] captivity now what does this mean to us
[49:52] it means exactly what it meant back
[49:54] there in the Earthly Ministry of Jesus
[49:57] he tried to teach them truth but they
[49:59] would not listen why wouldn't they
[50:02] listen because of tradition because of
[50:04] Pride they had been doing it for many
[50:07] years and and they had heard it all they
[50:09] I mean they didn't realize though there
[50:11] was actually a corner being turned even
[50:13] in the day in which they lived John 9:40
[50:16] to
[50:17] 41 and some of the Pharisees the most
[50:20] religious of the day which were with him
[50:22] heard these words and said unto himare
[50:24] we blind also
[50:26] you're telling us this stuff but you're
[50:29] are we
[50:30] blind Jesus said unto them if you were
[50:32] blind you should have no sin but because
[50:36] you can see he says but now ye say we
[50:39] see Therefore your sin remaineth because
[50:43] the word was made flesh and standing
[50:45] right in front of
[50:48] them the attitude of this AG is exactly
[50:51] what it was then people have it all they
[50:56] know it all
[50:57] they cannot be taught I say Lord let us
[51:01] not have it all let us have a hunger and
[51:04] a thirst to cry out for what we don't
[51:07] have and that is more
[51:09] revelation we have got to have more
[51:12] Revelation in our lives brothers and
[51:13] sisters and I want to say this I think
[51:15] it's so important it's not about the
[51:17] Mysteries it's not about the seals it's
[51:20] not about the Deep doctrines it's about
[51:22] the
[51:23] ABCs it's about being able to do the
[51:25] ABCs because if we can get the
[51:27] foundation down pat all of the algebra
[51:30] will
[51:31] follow it will just happen it will open
[51:34] our eyes to the things that will lead us
[51:36] into captivity
[51:39] otherwise people have it all they know
[51:41] it all they cannot be taught you know
[51:44] what they say about people that can't be
[51:46] taught it means they're
[51:47] dead and and sometimes people are well
[51:50] alive but dead inside because they can't
[51:53] be taught if a point of truth from the
[51:56] word comes up and a man tries to explain
[51:59] his view to one with an opposing view
[52:02] The Listener is not at all listening
[52:05] that he might learn but is listening
[52:08] only to refute what is being said I just
[52:13] can't help but think how we can so
[52:16] easily look around and say well I've got
[52:18] this quote and I've got that quote and
[52:21] what about the other quote and and and
[52:23] it just turns into this why are we doing
[52:26] that brothers and sisters we're brothers
[52:29] and sisters there's no need for
[52:32] that says now I want to ask a fair
[52:35] question can scripture fight
[52:37] scripture does the bible contradict the
[52:40] Bible can there be two doctrines of
[52:42] Truth in the word that say the opposite
[52:46] or oppose the
[52:48] other I love it it's in it is in
[52:51] capitals there too it says no it cannot
[52:53] be
[52:54] so yet how many of God's people have
[52:58] their eyes open to that
[53:00] truth not even
[53:03] 1% as far as I
[53:05] know have learned that all scripture is
[53:08] given by God and all is profitable for
[53:11] Doctrine reproof correction
[53:16] Etc you know if we have an error in our
[53:20] life and God chooses to use a child a
[53:23] little we little child to say a word of
[53:26] Correction ction in our life would we be
[53:28] willing to accept it if it lines up with
[53:29] the word or would we say I've been doing
[53:32] this for so many years what has the
[53:34] child got to say to
[53:35] me where do we stand tonight brothers
[53:38] and sisters we don't want to be These
[53:40] Guys these people in here that he's
[53:42] talking about if all scripture is thusly
[53:45] given then every verse will dovetail if
[53:48] given a
[53:49] chance but how many believe in
[53:52] predestination unto election and
[53:54] reprobation unto destruction that that
[53:56] is a very strong sentence it's a very
[54:00] difficult
[54:01] question because when we do that when we
[54:04] just say Amen to that we we take control
[54:06] completely out of our hands and place it
[54:08] in God's hands and and and then you get
[54:10] the the opposition that would say well
[54:12] how could you be a free moral agent if
[54:14] if that's the way it is the ones who are
[54:16] vessels onto destruction will go onto
[54:18] destruction the ones who aren't will go
[54:20] onto the word that's how it
[54:22] works those who don't will they listen
[54:25] no they will not yet both are in the
[54:28] word and nothing will change it but to
[54:31] learn about it and reconcile the truth
[54:35] of those doctrines with other truths
[54:38] that excuse me that seem to oppose they
[54:41] will not take the time but they stop
[54:44] their
[54:45] ears and Nash with their
[54:48] teeth and brother bam he says it here he
[54:50] says they lose out at the end of this
[54:53] age a prophet will come but will be
[54:56] blind to all that he is doing and saying
[54:59] they are so sure they are right and in
[55:02] their blindness they will lose it all I
[55:04] just want to pause here for a second and
[55:06] just say this brothers and sisters we
[55:08] are talking about a word for our day
[55:12] yeah we're not talking about a word for
[55:16] 1965 brother brandham is talking about a
[55:18] prophet that will come who's the prophet
[55:21] in the land
[55:23] today who is that Prophet that he's
[55:26] talking about today once upon a time it
[55:29] was William Maryam Bram but he said very
[55:31] clearly the prophet in the land today is
[55:35] the Holy
[55:36] Ghost so we need to make sure that we're
[55:39] actually reading this the right way
[55:42] we're able to read between the lines and
[55:44] catch what the spirit's saying to the
[55:48] church we can be so right in the
[55:53] message and Miss what the Holy Ghost is
[55:56] actually trying to teach
[55:58] us he's never going to teach us
[56:00] different than the word he's never going
[56:02] to teach us different than the message
[56:05] but how do you get so many different
[56:07] disputings and upsets in and around the
[56:10] message it's because we don't want to
[56:14] actually grow and learn we we have an
[56:16] idea that we've been there and we've
[56:18] done that but it's not about quotes
[56:21] versus quotes I'm right you're wrong my
[56:24] quotes bigger or better or longer
[56:26] shorter it's not about quotes it's about
[56:28] the Holy Ghost leadership in our lives
[56:30] and that's what makes people funny they
[56:32] don't like to let go and let God control
[56:34] their
[56:36] lives we have to be very
[56:38] careful he says they are so sure they're
[56:42] right and in their blindness they will
[56:45] lose it all now God says that they are
[56:48] naked as well as blind I cannot imagine
[56:51] anything as tragic as a man who is blind
[56:54] and naked and doesn't know it
[56:57] there's only one answer he's out of his
[57:00] mind he is already deep in Oblivion his
[57:04] faculties are gone spiritual Amnesia has
[57:07] set in what else can it mean can it mean
[57:11] that the Holy Spirit has taken his leave
[57:13] of this last day church can it mean that
[57:16] men have put God out of their minds to
[57:18] such an extent that it's happening even
[57:21] as stated in Romans 1: 128 and even as
[57:24] they did not like to retain God in their
[57:28] knowledge God gave them over to a
[57:31] reprobate mind to do those things which
[57:35] are not
[57:37] convenient now we can look at that
[57:39] scripture and say that that is you know
[57:42] that's that's perversion to the Max and
[57:44] sure enough this world is dealing with
[57:45] perversion to the max but you know when
[57:48] God calls and God calls and God calls
[57:51] and we just dilly dally and refuse the
[57:55] call eventually he'll give us over to a
[57:57] reprobate
[58:00] mind it surely appears that something
[58:03] like that has happened he says here is a
[58:06] people who say that they are of God and
[58:09] know God and have his Holy Spirit and
[58:11] yet they are naked and blind and don't
[58:13] know it so it's amazing the way he says
[58:18] this here because he's not talking about
[58:19] rank sinners in the world he's talking
[58:22] about people who believe their Holy
[58:23] Ghost filled people
[58:26] he says they are already deceived they
[58:30] have the wrong
[58:32] Spirit the elect cannot be deceived but
[58:36] it is evident that these others
[58:39] are these are they who have become blind
[58:44] because they refuse the word of God
[58:46] these are they who have stripped
[58:48] themselves naked by leaving God's care
[58:51] and protection and sought to build their
[58:53] own way of salvation their own Tower of
[58:57] Babel by organization and we know that
[59:01] Nimrod he built that Tower of Babel the
[59:05] idea behind that was to actually be able
[59:07] to survive another flood in case God
[59:10] decided to destroy the world they could
[59:13] just crawl up the top and go to heaven
[59:15] and they would be safe but it's
[59:18] beautiful how he talks about it here
[59:20] about that Tower of Babel by religion we
[59:23] can we can have a denomination of one
[59:26] remember brother Ken preaching that we
[59:28] we can have our own convictions my
[59:30] convictions a and have my own
[59:33] denomination by having my own
[59:35] convictions a and nobody who is a
[59:38] Believer is going to do that anyone who
[59:40] is a Believer is just going to
[59:41] completely surrender to the
[59:47] word my oh how lovely and beautifully
[59:50] dressed they appear in their own eyes as
[59:53] they formed their General assemblies and
[59:56] their counsels Etc but now God is
[59:59] stripping it all away and they are naked
[1:00:02] for these
[1:00:03] organizations have but led them into the
[1:00:06] camp of the Antichrist into the field of
[1:00:08] tears right up to the binding and
[1:00:13] burning objects of
[1:00:15] pity indeed they are yes pity them warn
[1:00:20] them beseech them and still they go
[1:00:24] their way headlong to destruction
[1:00:28] wrathfully turning away any and all
[1:00:31] attempts to save them as brands from the
[1:00:35] burning miserable indeed they are and
[1:00:39] yet not know
[1:00:41] it callous and Beyond hope they glory in
[1:00:46] what is actually their shame defiant
[1:00:49] against the word yet one day they shall
[1:00:53] be judged by it and pay the price of its
[1:00:56] awful
[1:00:58] indictments the final Council of the
[1:01:02] ages when I got into this I just thought
[1:01:04] that's such a powerful statement isn't
[1:01:06] it the final Council of the ages all of
[1:01:09] the seven Church ages here's here's the
[1:01:12] sum of it this is the final counsel take
[1:01:14] it or leave it my Revelations
[1:01:19] 318-19 I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:01:22] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:01:24] rich and white rment
[1:01:26] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:01:29] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:01:31] anoint thine eyes with isav that thou
[1:01:34] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke
[1:01:37] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[1:01:40] repent it's so beautiful because first
[1:01:43] he pronounces the judgment to this
[1:01:45] church but then he brings the actual
[1:01:49] remedy I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:01:54] tried in the fire it's a beautiful thing
[1:01:56] brother brandham talks about it we're
[1:01:57] getting into it here the councel of God
[1:02:00] is tur it is to the point he directs
[1:02:05] this last day Church to one hope that
[1:02:08] hope is
[1:02:10] himself he says come to me and buy it is
[1:02:14] evident from this phase phrase bu of me
[1:02:18] that the leodan church is not at all
[1:02:21] dealing with Jesus for the spiritual
[1:02:24] products of the kingdom of God
[1:02:26] their
[1:02:27] transaction
[1:02:29] transactions cannot be spiritual they
[1:02:32] may think that they are spiritual but
[1:02:35] how can they be the works in their midst
[1:02:38] are definitely not as Paul would say in
[1:02:41] Philippians 213 for it is God which
[1:02:44] worketh in you both to Will and to do of
[1:02:48] his good
[1:02:50] pleasure thus what about all these
[1:02:52] churches schools hospitals missionary
[1:02:56] Ventures
[1:02:57] Etc God is not in them as long as they
[1:03:02] are denominational seed and spirit and
[1:03:06] not the seed and spirit of
[1:03:09] God
[1:03:11] wow buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:03:15] that you may be rich now these people
[1:03:19] had plenty of gold but it was the wrong
[1:03:22] kind I say brothers and sisters let us
[1:03:25] not be grinding to get that kind of gold
[1:03:30] don't let it be the wrong kind of gold
[1:03:33] brother Bram he says it was that gold
[1:03:36] that brought men's lives and destroyed
[1:03:40] them it was the gold that warped and
[1:03:45] twisted human
[1:03:47] character for its love was the root of
[1:03:51] all
[1:03:53] evil it's a treacherous thing
[1:03:58] now we have a a good scripture here
[1:04:00] Revelations 18
[1:04:03] 1-14 and after these things I saw
[1:04:06] another Angel come down from heaven
[1:04:08] having great power and the Earth was
[1:04:11] lighted with his glory and he cried
[1:04:14] mightily with a strong voice saying
[1:04:17] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[1:04:20] and has become a h the habitation of
[1:04:23] devils and the hold of every foul owl
[1:04:26] spirit and a cage of every unclean and
[1:04:29] hateful bird for all nations have drunk
[1:04:32] of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:04:34] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[1:04:37] have committed fornication with her and
[1:04:40] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[1:04:43] Rich through the abundance of her
[1:04:46] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[1:04:48] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[1:04:51] people that ye be not partakers of her
[1:04:54] sins and that ye receive not of her
[1:04:58] plagues for her sins have reached unto
[1:05:01] heaven and God hath remembered her
[1:05:04] iniquities reward her even as she
[1:05:07] rewarded you and double unto
[1:05:11] her double according to her works in the
[1:05:15] cup which she hath filled fill to her
[1:05:18] double how much she hath glorified
[1:05:21] herself and lived deliciously so much
[1:05:24] torment and sorrow give her for she
[1:05:27] saith in her heart I sit as a queen and
[1:05:30] am no Widow and shall see no
[1:05:33] sorrow therefore shall her plagues come
[1:05:36] in one day death and mourning and famine
[1:05:40] and she shall be utterly burned with
[1:05:42] fire for strong is the Lord God who
[1:05:45] judgeth her and the kings of the earth
[1:05:48] who have committed fornication and live
[1:05:50] deliciously with her shall bewail her
[1:05:52] and lament for her when they shall see
[1:05:55] the the smoke of her burning standing
[1:05:58] AAR off for the fear of her torment
[1:06:01] saying alas alas that great City Babylon
[1:06:06] that Mighty City for in one hour is thy
[1:06:08] judgment
[1:06:10] come and the merchants of the Earth
[1:06:12] shall weep and mourn over her for no man
[1:06:16] buyeth her merchandise anymore the
[1:06:19] merchandise of gold and silver and
[1:06:22] precious stones and of pearls and fine
[1:06:25] linen and purple and silk and Scarlet
[1:06:28] and all thine wood and all manner of
[1:06:31] vessels of Ivory and all manner of
[1:06:34] vessels of most precious wood and of
[1:06:36] brass and iron and marble and cinnamon
[1:06:39] and odors and ointments and frankincense
[1:06:42] and wine and oil and fine flour wheat
[1:06:44] and beasts and sheep and horses and
[1:06:47] chariots and slaves and Souls of
[1:06:51] men and the fruits that thy Soul lusted
[1:06:54] after are departed from thee and all
[1:06:58] these things which were dainty and
[1:07:01] goodly are departed from thee and thou
[1:07:04] shalt find them no more at
[1:07:09] all I think it says it all but all of
[1:07:13] this world is going to disappear all of
[1:07:16] the world in which we know all in the
[1:07:19] world of the world that this church
[1:07:23] knows will be totally changing
[1:07:27] brother bam says this is exactly the
[1:07:28] organized churches of the last
[1:07:31] day not just the Roman Catholic church
[1:07:35] every single church that's not a part of
[1:07:38] this ministry not my Ministry the
[1:07:41] ministry of the Holy Ghost under the
[1:07:43] message of the hour every single other
[1:07:46] Church pays homage to Rome whether
[1:07:49] directly or indirectly they fit that
[1:07:52] description this is exactly the
[1:07:54] organized Church churches of the last
[1:07:56] day for it says in verse 4 come out of
[1:07:59] her my people the Rapture has not yet
[1:08:04] taken place so if you look at this
[1:08:07] scripture and you see all of this
[1:08:09] happening I can't help but think here we
[1:08:11] have the prophet of God saying there's
[1:08:13] something really significant that's
[1:08:14] going to take place and the Rapture
[1:08:17] hasn't gone
[1:08:19] yet but we have an instruction to come
[1:08:21] out of her my people the bride is not
[1:08:25] yet gone when these terrible conditions
[1:08:28] in this Rich false Church
[1:08:31] exist but there is a gold of God so
[1:08:35] beautiful 1 Peter 1:7 says that the
[1:08:37] trial of your faith being much more
[1:08:40] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:08:43] remember the devil is coming after our
[1:08:46] faith he he he really likes to upset us
[1:08:50] in all the other areas but really he
[1:08:52] just wants to steal our faith he wants
[1:08:53] to get us at a place where we say
[1:08:55] there's no God God's not even listening
[1:08:57] does he even care that's what he wants
[1:08:59] to do if he can get us to that place
[1:09:01] he's got us but we'll never be able to
[1:09:04] lose our faith just just like job we'll
[1:09:08] find ourselves potentially on the Heap
[1:09:10] of an of of our sacrifice and we won't
[1:09:13] move we'll say that sacrifice is still
[1:09:15] there as long as I can see that
[1:09:17] sacrifice I know that I am justified and
[1:09:20] what's our sacrifice today brothers and
[1:09:22] sisters it's not a church it's not an
[1:09:24] association it's not our family it's not
[1:09:27] tenure there none of that our sacrifice
[1:09:30] is Jesus Christ and when we can say that
[1:09:33] we've met him personally he is our
[1:09:36] sacrifice it doesn't matter how hard the
[1:09:38] devil tries to shake us he'll never
[1:09:40] touch our
[1:09:43] faith the trial of your faith is much
[1:09:46] more precious than that of gold that
[1:09:49] perisheth I just wonder you know I I
[1:09:52] look back to when I had a business and
[1:09:54] and how caught up in the business I got
[1:09:57] brothers and sisters I never want to
[1:09:58] take for granted what it means to be in
[1:10:00] a in a position where I'm not working
[1:10:02] full-time at a job I remember what it's
[1:10:05] like to be caught up trying to actually
[1:10:08] capture that gold but you know one day
[1:10:11] we'll look back on our lives and think
[1:10:13] maybe why did I get so fussed in that
[1:10:15] situation or why did I get so upset over
[1:10:18] that and it's over the money it's trying
[1:10:20] to survive it's human nature but we have
[1:10:23] the encouragement to remember remember
[1:10:25] that our faith is the most important
[1:10:29] Paramount thing that we can ever have on
[1:10:32] this earth and the faith that we're
[1:10:34] talking about brothers and sisters is
[1:10:35] not something we're taught in Sunday
[1:10:36] school it's not something we're taught
[1:10:37] from the pulpit it's the faith of Jesus
[1:10:40] Christ that comes inside of us it's not
[1:10:43] our faith it's the Faith of Christ not
[1:10:47] the faith in Christ We Believe In Christ
[1:10:49] many people have faith in Christ it's
[1:10:50] the Faith of Christ Living out through
[1:10:53] US brother bam goes on to say the gold
[1:10:56] of God is a Christlike character
[1:11:00] produced in the fiery furnace of a
[1:11:03] flowery bed of
[1:11:05] ease no no that Christlike character is
[1:11:10] produced in the fiery furnace of
[1:11:14] Affliction he says that's the right kind
[1:11:17] of
[1:11:18] gold if we're getting Trials of our
[1:11:21] faith brothers and sisters he's working
[1:11:24] out the character
[1:11:25] that he wants to see in our
[1:11:28] lives we're not going to get that kind
[1:11:30] of character without a
[1:11:34] trial but what kind of gold does the
[1:11:36] church have today it has but the worldly
[1:11:39] gold that will perish it's Rich it's
[1:11:43] complacent it has made affluence the
[1:11:46] major Criterion of
[1:11:49] spirituality God's blessing me I've got
[1:11:52] my my money rolling in so hey God's
[1:11:54] blessing in me that's not necessarily
[1:11:56] God's
[1:11:57] blessing the evidence of God's blessing
[1:12:01] and the correctness of Doctrine
[1:12:03] Etc is now based upon how rich how many
[1:12:07] Rich folks are involved in it you had
[1:12:10] better become you had better come before
[1:12:13] it's too late saeth the Lord and buy of
[1:12:17] me gold tried in the fire and then you
[1:12:21] will be truly Rich he says this are we
[1:12:24] getting it listen to me naked physically
[1:12:29] we came into the world but naked
[1:12:31] spiritually we will not leave
[1:12:35] it I think that we should read this
[1:12:37] again brothers and sisters maybe when
[1:12:39] you go home read this part again
[1:12:41] remember even though we come in naked
[1:12:43] we're not going out naked we're going
[1:12:46] out with a token in our
[1:12:49] lives he says oh no we are going to take
[1:12:53] something with us what that something is
[1:12:56] is all we can take with us nothing less
[1:13:00] and nothing
[1:13:01] more so brothers and sisters remember
[1:13:05] the key to seeing whether you're
[1:13:07] actually doing right in the sight of the
[1:13:09] Lord are you growing spiritually are we
[1:13:12] growing spiritually he's interested in
[1:13:14] spiritual growth maybe character
[1:13:16] development there's maybe a few
[1:13:17] different ways you could say it I I
[1:13:19] would say it this way the life of the
[1:13:21] Holy Ghost living out through us there's
[1:13:23] many different ways we could describe it
[1:13:24] brother Adam he says so we had better be
[1:13:27] real careful now to see that we take
[1:13:30] something that will make us right before
[1:13:34] God so then what will we take with us we
[1:13:38] take our
[1:13:39] character brother that's what we take
[1:13:42] with us and we've all heard it said
[1:13:44] before probably you never see a
[1:13:47] U-Haul behind a hearse in a funeral
[1:13:51] procession full of people's furniture
[1:13:54] and money and special things that they
[1:13:56] worked so hard and fought so miserably
[1:13:59] to get in their
[1:14:00] lives that doesn't go with them it all
[1:14:03] just gets given away it all becomes
[1:14:05] other people's things that's the way of
[1:14:08] the
[1:14:09] world the only thing that we're going to
[1:14:11] take with us is our character and
[1:14:13] remember death doesn't change our
[1:14:15] character we don't become a different
[1:14:17] person because we die we're the same
[1:14:20] person all we do is breathe out in this
[1:14:23] Dimension and breathe in in that
[1:14:25] Dimension and there's two different
[1:14:27] versions of it one is fiery flames of
[1:14:29] torment and the other one is in Paradise
[1:14:33] it's one or the other there's nothing in
[1:14:35] between and who we are here is who is
[1:14:37] going to be there and I think about
[1:14:40] myself brothers and sisters many times
[1:14:41] and I think Lord I've got a long ways to
[1:14:43] go please have mercy on me today I I I I
[1:14:48] I I I think I got a lot of character
[1:14:51] developing to happen in my life
[1:14:55] but amen let it happen that's what we if
[1:14:58] it's what we need then we want it
[1:15:02] right he goes on to say now what kind of
[1:15:04] character will take will you take with
[1:15:06] you will it be like his whose character
[1:15:10] was molded by suffering in the fiery
[1:15:12] furnace of Affliction or will it be in
[1:15:15] the softness of this characterless
[1:15:17] leodan people oh my when it starts
[1:15:20] getting tough I run when it starts
[1:15:23] getting hard I repel back I withdraw I I
[1:15:26] oh I can't take it when it starts
[1:15:28] getting difficult no that's not the life
[1:15:32] of a Believer that's not the the faith
[1:15:35] of God inside the believer that's the
[1:15:39] leoan people it's up to each one of us
[1:15:43] for in that day every man will bear his
[1:15:46] own
[1:15:46] burden now I say that the city of leoda
[1:15:50] was a wealthy City it minted gold coins
[1:15:53] with inscriptions on both sides gold
[1:15:56] coins characterize the age a flourishing
[1:15:59] Commerce existed because of it today the
[1:16:04] two-headed gold coin is with us we buy
[1:16:08] it ourselves out and we buy ourselves in
[1:16:13] in the church we attempt to accomplish
[1:16:15] the same we buy ourselves out of sin and
[1:16:19] buy ourselves into heaven or so we
[1:16:22] say but God does not say that
[1:16:25] the church owns such phenomenal wealth
[1:16:28] that at any given time she can take over
[1:16:31] the entire world's system of Commerce
[1:16:33] can you imagine that that's a lot of
[1:16:37] money and indeed a leader in the world
[1:16:40] Council of churches has openly
[1:16:41] prophesied that the church in the
[1:16:44] foreseeable future should could and will
[1:16:47] do just that but their golden Tower of
[1:16:50] Babel shall fall only the gold tried in
[1:16:54] the fight
[1:16:55] shall endure the gold that's tried in
[1:16:58] the fire is Christ's character living
[1:17:00] out through the believer that's the
[1:17:03] character that's the gold brothers and
[1:17:05] sisters the fruit of the
[1:17:07] spirit and that is what the church has
[1:17:10] constantly done Through the Ages she's
[1:17:12] left the word of God taken her own
[1:17:14] Creeds and dogmas she has organized and
[1:17:17] joined herself to the world thus she is
[1:17:20] naked and God is judging her loudness
[1:17:23] the only way she can get out of this
[1:17:25] dread situation is by obeying the Lord
[1:17:28] to come back to his word of Revelations
[1:17:32] 184 come out of her my people be ye not
[1:17:37] unequally yolked together with
[1:17:40] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[1:17:42] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[1:17:45] what communion hath light with darkness
[1:17:48] and what Concord hath Christ with bile
[1:17:52] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:17:55] an Infidel and what agreement hath the
[1:17:58] temple of God with
[1:17:59] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:18:03] Living God as God hath said I will dwell
[1:18:07] in them and walk in them and I will be
[1:18:12] their God and they shall be my people I
[1:18:17] think many times we take this scripture
[1:18:20] and we put it off into the
[1:18:23] Millennium I don't think it's just a
[1:18:25] millennium brothers and sisters he goes
[1:18:26] on to say wherefore come out from among
[1:18:28] them and be ye separate saith the Lord
[1:18:31] touch not the unclean thing and I will
[1:18:34] receive you and I will be a father unto
[1:18:36] you and ye shall be my sons and
[1:18:39] daughters sayith the Lord Almighty 2
[1:18:42] Corinthians 6:14
[1:18:45] to18 there is a price to pay for those
[1:18:47] garments and that is the price of
[1:18:52] separation and anoint thine eyes with I
[1:18:55] have that thou mightest see I just feel
[1:18:58] led to go back to that separation bit
[1:19:00] it's not going and associating with the
[1:19:02] world brothers and sisters my dad used
[1:19:04] to tell me all the time your friends
[1:19:05] will either build you up or break you
[1:19:08] down there's no middle ground and we all
[1:19:10] know the worldly description you know if
[1:19:12] you want to to dictate where you're
[1:19:15] going to be financially speaking just
[1:19:18] take your five closest people and add up
[1:19:20] their salaries and then do the the
[1:19:24] average of them and that's pretty much
[1:19:25] where you're going to be you are who
[1:19:27] your people are if you're associating
[1:19:30] with unbelievers you're draining
[1:19:32] yourself you got to guard yourself you
[1:19:35] want to make sure that you're actually
[1:19:38] associating with people who are going to
[1:19:40] be building you up and encouraging
[1:19:44] you sorry about that that was for free
[1:19:47] and anoint thine eyes with iav that thou
[1:19:49] mayest see he does not say that you have
[1:19:52] to buy this isav oh oh no there is no
[1:19:56] price tag on
[1:19:58] the Holy
[1:20:00] Spirit brothers and sisters if we ever
[1:20:03] need a dose of isav in this day it is
[1:20:07] today we need that isav now more than
[1:20:11] ever the devil is so subtle so
[1:20:14] cunning he's everywhere you look in the
[1:20:17] age in which we live Galatians 3:2
[1:20:20] receive ye the Spirit by The Works of
[1:20:23] the law or by the hearing of
[1:20:27] faith I just love this I have this
[1:20:29] highlighted I've got it starred this
[1:20:31] next paragraph says it all brothers and
[1:20:34] sisters without the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:36] Ghost you can never have your eyes open
[1:20:39] to a true spiritual revelation of the
[1:20:41] word
[1:20:43] period so what is it what else is there
[1:20:45] to talk about there's people that don't
[1:20:47] have the Holy Ghost we need to get the
[1:20:49] Holy Ghost as Believers in the age in
[1:20:51] which we live and if we've got the Holy
[1:20:53] Ghost just say Amen
[1:20:55] we don't want to get upset for those
[1:20:56] that need to get the Holy Ghost without
[1:20:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will
[1:21:00] never have your eyes open to a true
[1:21:03] spiritual revelation of the word a man
[1:21:07] without the spirit is blind to God and
[1:21:11] His
[1:21:14] truth so powerful it's it's the most
[1:21:18] important thing brothers and sisters we
[1:21:19] can read the Bible we can read the
[1:21:21] message we can listen we can talk about
[1:21:23] it we can and fellowship around it but
[1:21:26] without Revelation by the spirit we're
[1:21:28] just like everyone else we have to have
[1:21:31] Revelation by the spirit God Opening Our
[1:21:35] Eyes to this word and not just this word
[1:21:38] but the word for our day so
[1:21:41] vital when I think of this isav opening
[1:21:44] people's eyes I can't help but recall
[1:21:47] when I was a little boy in Kentucky my
[1:21:50] brother and I slept in the Attic on a
[1:21:51] straw pallet the cracks in the house
[1:21:54] house would let the drafts blow through
[1:21:57] sometimes in the winter it would get so
[1:21:59] cold we would wake up in the morning
[1:22:01] with such colds in our eyes that our
[1:22:04] eyes would be shut tight with
[1:22:07] inflammation we would cry out to mother
[1:22:10] and up she would come with some hot
[1:22:12] grease and rub our eyes until the
[1:22:15] hardened matter was gone and then we
[1:22:18] could
[1:22:19] see you know there have been some awful
[1:22:22] cold drafts blowing on the church in
[1:22:25] this
[1:22:26] generation and I'm afraid her eyes have
[1:22:30] sort of frozen shut and she is blind to
[1:22:34] what God has for
[1:22:37] her she needs some hot oil of the spirit
[1:22:41] of God to open her
[1:22:44] eyes unless she receives the spirit of
[1:22:49] God she will go on substituting program
[1:22:52] for power and and Creed for
[1:22:56] word she counts numbers for success
[1:23:00] rather than to look for
[1:23:03] fruit the doctors of theology have shut
[1:23:07] the door to Faith and forbade all to
[1:23:10] enter the the days of Miracles has
[1:23:13] passed the apostolic age is over we know
[1:23:16] we could go on and on about it he says
[1:23:18] they never go in nor let anyone else go
[1:23:21] in if I can't get in then how could you
[1:23:25] possibly go further than me in my
[1:23:27] spiritual
[1:23:29] Revelation it's terrible their theology
[1:23:32] comes out of a textbook on psychology
[1:23:34] written by some unbeliever there is a
[1:23:37] textbook on psychology one we all need
[1:23:40] it is the Bible I love this part I love
[1:23:44] this part it is written by God and
[1:23:48] contains God's
[1:23:51] psychology not man's psychology not
[1:23:54] Psych ology from the Tree of knowledge
[1:23:55] of Good and Evil Brothers and Sisters it
[1:23:58] goes beyond our understanding and our
[1:24:00] own comprehension if we get the Holy
[1:24:02] Ghost in our lives he the spirit of
[1:24:04] truth will lead us and guide us into all
[1:24:06] truth he will Deliver Us from every
[1:24:07] single disease every single Affliction
[1:24:09] in our
[1:24:10] lives the book of psychology is going to
[1:24:13] teach us how to live it live with it
[1:24:15] we're going to understand what it's
[1:24:17] called we're going to understand what
[1:24:19] the attributes of it are and then we're
[1:24:21] going to learn how to actually maybe get
[1:24:23] some medic ation to live with it in a
[1:24:26] psychological aspect understand it who
[1:24:28] wants to do that what we want to do is
[1:24:31] be delivered by the Holy
[1:24:38] Ghost I just think it's so important I'm
[1:24:40] going to pause here for a second
[1:24:41] brothers and sisters God has a
[1:24:44] psychology I'm not saying that the
[1:24:47] understanding of psychology is
[1:24:51] wrong but if we're willing to substitute
[1:24:53] faith in God for worldly
[1:24:57] psychology according to the word that's
[1:24:59] going to be wrong that's going to ground
[1:25:01] out the power of the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:25:04] Lives brother brami says you don't need
[1:25:06] any doctor to explain it to
[1:25:09] you receive ye the Holy
[1:25:12] Spirit and let him do the
[1:25:16] explaining he wrote the book and he can
[1:25:20] tell you what's in it and what it means
[1:25:24] isn't that such a simple
[1:25:26] statement but so powerful and
[1:25:30] profound we don't need theologians to
[1:25:32] teach us we need Jesus Christ the same
[1:25:36] yesterday today and
[1:25:38] forever so that our eyes can be open too
[1:25:41] 1 Corinthians 29-16 but as it is written
[1:25:45] I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither
[1:25:48] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:25:50] things which God hath prepared for them
[1:25:52] that love him but God hath revealed them
[1:25:55] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[1:25:59] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[1:26:01] of God for what man knoweth the things
[1:26:04] of man save the spirit of man which is
[1:26:06] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[1:26:09] no man but the spirit of God now we have
[1:26:14] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:26:17] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:26:20] know the things that are freely given to
[1:26:23] us of God which things also we speak not
[1:26:28] in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but
[1:26:32] which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[1:26:36] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[1:26:38] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:26:40] the spirit of God for they are
[1:26:42] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:26:45] them because they are spiritually
[1:26:49] discerned so beautiful but he that is
[1:26:52] spiritual judgeth all all
[1:26:55] things yet he himself is judged of no
[1:26:58] man for who hath known the mind of the
[1:27:01] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:27:05] have the mind of
[1:27:08] Christ
[1:27:12] my I just think that scripture is so
[1:27:14] beautiful it's tremendous we have not re
[1:27:18] receive the spirit of the world but the
[1:27:21] spirit which is of god that we may know
[1:27:24] the things that are freely given to us
[1:27:27] of God that we should understand what
[1:27:30] we're talking about here that we should
[1:27:32] understand the word of God we should
[1:27:35] understand what it means to truly get
[1:27:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now if all
[1:27:40] the things that the spirit is crying out
[1:27:42] against are true of this age we need
[1:27:46] someone to come on the scene as did John
[1:27:48] the Baptist and challenged the church as
[1:27:51] never
[1:27:52] before and that is exactly what is
[1:27:54] coming to our age and and we know we can
[1:27:57] say that is exactly what has come to our
[1:28:00] age that is history another John the
[1:28:03] Baptist is coming and has come and he
[1:28:07] will cry out exactly as did the first
[1:28:10] 4Runner get back in line with the word
[1:28:13] get back to the word but he will also go
[1:28:15] further with it and say I I'm not here
[1:28:18] to actually declare my Ministry what I'm
[1:28:20] here doing is just standing here when he
[1:28:23] comes I am here to declare not the first
[1:28:26] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but to
[1:28:28] prepare the way for the second coming of
[1:28:31] the Lord Jesus Christ my one crying in
[1:28:34] the wilderness we know that he
[1:28:38] will sorry another John the Baptist is
[1:28:41] coming and he will cry out exactly as
[1:28:42] did the first Forerunner we know that he
[1:28:44] will because of what the next verse says
[1:28:47] Revelations 319 as many as I love I
[1:28:50] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[1:28:52] and repent how is he going to rebuke and
[1:28:54] chasen there's going to be someone to
[1:28:57] actually speak the
[1:28:59] word this is the same message that John
[1:29:01] had as he cried out in the religious
[1:29:03] Wilderness of Pharisees Sadducees and
[1:29:06] Heathen
[1:29:07] repent there was no other course then
[1:29:10] there was no other course now there's no
[1:29:12] other way to get back to God then and
[1:29:15] there was no other way now it is repent
[1:29:19] period change your mind period turn
[1:29:22] around period repent
[1:29:24] for why will you
[1:29:27] die I just love that I I I wonder is
[1:29:30] that sort of how John was talking to the
[1:29:32] Sadducees and the Pharisees then and the
[1:29:34] heathens is that what he was saying just
[1:29:37] straight up let us examine the first
[1:29:40] phrase as many as I love in the Greek
[1:29:44] the emphasis is
[1:29:45] upon the
[1:29:48] what the personal pronoun it's beautiful
[1:29:52] hey back in 1965 the Vindicated prophet
[1:29:55] of God was using
[1:29:57] pronouns the correct
[1:30:00] ones the personal pronoun
[1:30:03] I he does not say that many would feel
[1:30:07] he should say as many as love me no sir
[1:30:12] we must never try to make Jesus the
[1:30:14] object of human love in this verse no it
[1:30:19] is the many that are the
[1:30:24] it is the many that are the loved ones
[1:30:26] of God it is his love in question not
[1:30:31] ours so once again we find ourselves
[1:30:33] gloring in his salvation his purpose and
[1:30:37] his plan and we are confirmed even more
[1:30:41] strongly in the truth of the doctrine of
[1:30:43] the sovereignty of God even as he said
[1:30:46] in Romans 9:13 Jacob have I loved does
[1:30:50] it now obtain that since he loved only
[1:30:54] the many is he therefore in a state of
[1:30:58] complacency awaiting the love of those
[1:31:01] who have not drawn nigh him by no means
[1:31:05] is this so for he declared also in
[1:31:09] Romans 9:13 Esau have I loved and in
[1:31:12] verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for
[1:31:16] the children not being born neither
[1:31:19] having done any good or evil that the
[1:31:22] purpose of God
[1:31:24] according to election might stand not of
[1:31:28] works but of him that calleth that was a
[1:31:31] mouthful the last paragraph
[1:31:34] there in a nutshell I'll just say it
[1:31:36] this way he's not waiting for people to
[1:31:39] love him he's not waiting for people to
[1:31:41] love him to exude his love back because
[1:31:44] you love me I love you that's not at all
[1:31:47] what that verse says and that's what
[1:31:49] brother Bram was saying there he says
[1:31:51] this love is elective love
[1:31:54] it's his love for his
[1:31:58] elect and his love for them is apart
[1:32:01] from Human Merit there's nothing we
[1:32:03] could
[1:32:04] do to get us more or get us less isn't
[1:32:08] that wonderful there's nothing we could
[1:32:11] do to get more or less of his love apart
[1:32:14] from Human Merit for it says the purpose
[1:32:17] of God stands an election which is
[1:32:19] exactly opposite to the works or
[1:32:22] anything man has as in
[1:32:25] himself because before the children were
[1:32:27] born he had already said Jacob have I
[1:32:30] loved and Esau have I
[1:32:33] hated and now he says to his own as many
[1:32:36] as I love I rebuke and chasen to rebuke
[1:32:38] is to reprove to reprove is to expose
[1:32:42] with a view of Correction chasen does
[1:32:46] not mean punish it means discipline
[1:32:51] because the subject's amendment
[1:32:54] is in
[1:32:56] mind we want to correct our children
[1:32:59] maybe they're riding a bike they're a
[1:33:01] toddler on a on a three-wheel or a
[1:33:03] tricycle and we want to correct them
[1:33:05] because they're going the wrong
[1:33:06] direction we're not going to push them
[1:33:08] off their tricycle we're simply going to
[1:33:11] grab a hold of them and try and steer
[1:33:13] them the right way with love they're are
[1:33:17] children we're not going to slap them
[1:33:19] off the tricycle and say you're going
[1:33:21] the wrong way but that's the way that
[1:33:23] devil sometimes tries to make us feel
[1:33:25] that God wants to do to us in our lives
[1:33:28] I think it's so beautiful that he would
[1:33:30] say it this way that's not what he wants
[1:33:31] to
[1:33:32] do Hebrews
[1:33:34] 125
[1:33:36] to1 and ye have for and ye have
[1:33:40] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:33:42] unto you as unto children my son despise
[1:33:45] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:33:48] faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:33:52] him for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:33:55] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[1:33:58] he
[1:33:59] receiveth if ye endure chastening God
[1:34:02] deal with you dealth with you as with
[1:34:05] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:34:08] chasteneth
[1:34:10] not but if you be without chastisement
[1:34:13] whereof all are partakers then ye are
[1:34:16] bastards and not sons that means you
[1:34:18] don't have a
[1:34:20] father that means you don't have a
[1:34:23] father that means he is not your father
[1:34:26] that's what that means and that is a
[1:34:29] terrible thing if you be without
[1:34:31] correction if you be without
[1:34:33] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:34:36] all of his children are partakers of
[1:34:38] Correction all of
[1:34:39] them then you are bastards and not Sons
[1:34:43] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:34:45] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:34:47] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:34:50] be in subjection unto the father of
[1:34:52] spirits and live
[1:34:54] for they verily for a few days chastened
[1:34:57] us after their own
[1:35:00] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[1:35:03] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[1:35:05] no chastening for this present seeth to
[1:35:09] be joyous but
[1:35:11] Grievious nevertheless afterward it yith
[1:35:16] the Peaceable fruit of
[1:35:18] righteousness unto them which are
[1:35:21] exercised thereby all call up the
[1:35:24] musicians as we close tonight the
[1:35:26] Peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:35:30] brothers and sisters the character of
[1:35:32] Jesus Christ Living out through
[1:35:35] US
[1:35:36] Temperance meekness Faith
[1:35:41] goodness
[1:35:42] gentleness
[1:35:45] longsuffering
[1:35:47] peace joy and love the characteristics
[1:35:51] of Jesus Christ Living out through us us
[1:35:54] the Peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:35:56] unfortunately it doesn't come without
[1:35:59] going through the The Valleys it doesn't
[1:36:01] come without going through great trials
[1:36:03] in our lives maybe stand with me as we
[1:36:07] close I just think it's a wonderful
[1:36:09] thing brothers and sisters no chastening
[1:36:11] for this present seeth to be joyous and
[1:36:13] it's
[1:36:15] not but
[1:36:16] Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:36:19] yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of
[1:36:21] righteousness unto them which are
[1:36:23] exercise thereby that Peaceable fruit of
[1:36:26] righteousness is coming our way when we
[1:36:28] go through trials we're not going
[1:36:30] through trials to actually destroy us to
[1:36:34] wreck us to steal our faith to lose our
[1:36:36] faith we're going through trials to
[1:36:39] actually allow us to grow to mature to
[1:36:42] see his character come out in us I think
[1:36:45] it's just a beautiful thing we want to
[1:36:47] see that Peaceable fruit of
[1:36:49] righteousness God bless you tonight as
[1:36:51] we close let's just bow in prayer
