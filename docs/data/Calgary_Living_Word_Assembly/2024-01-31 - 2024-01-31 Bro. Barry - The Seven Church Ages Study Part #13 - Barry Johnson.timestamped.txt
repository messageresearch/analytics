[44:56] hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[44:58] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[45:02] seated just a couple of announcements
[45:04] we've got Jim night coming up um Friday
[45:08] night we got a prayer meeting February
[45:11] the 15th that'll be at 7:30 here in the
[45:14] church um we have a youth event for
[45:18] February
[45:19] uh I'm not sure what the date is now we
[45:22] got a Youth Event coming up this month
[45:24] and I'll have to get back to you on that
[45:25] it on the 18th but I have that date
[45:27] wrong so forgive me uh we have the
[45:30] annual General men's meeting at the
[45:31] church in the basement here February
[45:34] 29th that'll be at 7:30 I believe that's
[45:37] a Thursday as well and uh just a good
[45:40] time to get together with all the
[45:42] brothers talk about church business are
[45:44] you happy
[45:46] tonight last week we uh finished off
[45:49] talking about the golden lampstands and
[45:52] you know about the vine and how the Vine
[45:56] doesn't bear
[45:57] fruit the branches are what bears the
[46:01] fruit and brother brandham goes into
[46:03] talking about very clearly how you get
[46:07] many times a grafted Affair you get uh
[46:11] branches that are grafted in to the
[46:13] church and uh I would say the church
[46:16] Universal the mystical body of Jesus
[46:19] Christ you get branches that are grafted
[46:22] in and they live off the life they even
[46:25] thrive
[46:26] off of the life and they bear different
[46:30] fruit and many times you have to scratch
[46:33] your head and wonder how how come is
[46:35] that the case but here we have a
[46:37] dispensational prophet that brings the
[46:39] answer to that they haven't actually
[46:42] been borne into it because when they've
[46:45] been borne into it what happens is the
[46:47] inside of the branch it has the same
[46:50] trunk as the original tree and even
[46:54] though it can live off the life when it
[46:56] brings forth fruit when that Branch
[46:58] brings forth fruit it matches the
[47:01] original tree it doesn't bring forth a
[47:03] different
[47:04] fruit I think it's just so amazing when
[47:07] we look at this brother brandham says
[47:09] but if the vine ever brings forth
[47:11] another branch of itself that Branch
[47:13] will be exactly like the vine itself
[47:16] it's not going to be bearing different
[47:18] fruit and saying well I believe many
[47:21] people
[47:22] believe and uh it doesn't actually line
[47:25] up with the word and you know brother
[47:26] Brown talks about that in in the message
[47:28] tonight we'll get into it I think it's
[47:30] just it's astounding when we realize
[47:32] that many people will claim to believe
[47:34] the message but have their own belief
[47:36] structure based around the message and
[47:39] because of that they don't have the same
[47:41] fruit that the original tree has and and
[47:44] it's terrible but that's true it's very
[47:47] true and it's so good that we had a
[47:50] prophet imagine if we didn't have a
[47:51] prophet in our day a dispensational
[47:54] prophet a major prophet that God would
[47:55] would send to the the Earth to say you
[47:58] know what everyone has their own way and
[48:00] all the churches are wrong most people
[48:02] if you talk to them if they have been a
[48:03] Christian for any while in their life if
[48:06] they were really honest they would say
[48:07] they're all kind of corrupt it's all
[48:09] about business and operations and and
[48:13] image it's all about looking good but
[48:16] not actually seeing the manifestation of
[48:18] the fruit of the spirit in their lives
[48:21] and that really is the bottom line
[48:23] that's what brother brandham brought
[48:24] we've got to be able to actually
[48:25] manifest the fruit of the spirit that's
[48:27] the fruit we're talking about we're not
[48:29] talking about oranges or apples or pears
[48:31] or nectarines or tangelos or anything
[48:34] like that we have got to have the fruit
[48:35] of the spirit if if we can say that we
[48:38] love God but yet we don't love our
[48:41] brother there's something wrong with our
[48:43] experience it's bearing a different
[48:45] fruit I if if we can come to church and
[48:48] and and maybe worship freely and and and
[48:51] say Amen to the word of God but then go
[48:53] and slander a brother or a sister
[48:56] there's something wrong with that fruit
[48:57] that's another Branch that's grafted in
[49:00] it's thriving off the life but it's not
[49:02] bearing the right fruit if we come to
[49:04] church and we worship and everything is
[49:07] is Grand it's fantastic we have a a
[49:09] tremendous tenure of going to church but
[49:12] we have a terrible family life there's
[49:14] something wrong with that Branch it's
[49:18] thriving off the
[49:19] life but what did a family say what does
[49:22] the wife say what do the children say
[49:24] who's daddy is he the same person that
[49:26] he is in church whose mommy are they the
[49:29] same people that everybody sees we've
[49:32] got to have the fruit of the spirit in
[49:33] our lives when we do we'll actually live
[49:35] it we won't even have to preach we won't
[49:38] even have to say a word the people
[49:40] around us in the world will say what is
[49:41] that about you do you serve God do you
[49:45] do you have a a religion what is the
[49:48] problem why do you act so different
[49:49] people will know
[49:51] it denominations which are not M
[49:54] directed cannot be born of God for it is
[49:57] the spirit not man that gives life you
[50:01] know brother Ram goes on to talk about
[50:03] it uh I I
[50:04] probably I won't go too far into
[50:09] that we'll just get into uh no longer
[50:12] the priest Revelations 1: 13 it's on
[50:16] page 50 of the exposition of the seven
[50:18] Church
[50:19] ages Revelations 1:13 says and in the
[50:23] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[50:25] unto the son of man clothed with a
[50:28] garment down to the foot and gir about
[50:31] the paps with a golden
[50:34] girdle there he stands one like unto the
[50:38] son of man as the jewel is beautified by
[50:41] the mounting of the ring so he is
[50:44] glorified in the midst of the
[50:47] churches isn't that just beautiful he is
[50:50] glorified in the midst of our church
[50:53] tonight right here
[50:57] he says it's the Lord's day for John
[50:58] sees him standing not as a priest but as
[51:01] the coming judge the golden girdle is no
[51:05] longer Girt around the waist where the
[51:07] priest must wear it as he ministers to
[51:10] God in the holiest place but it is now
[51:13] around his shoulders for he is not now
[51:17] the priest but the
[51:20] judge and you know brothers and sisters
[51:22] we have been given such a tremendous
[51:24] opportunity it just was was weighing so
[51:26] heavy with me today I uh I just was
[51:29] thinking about it what it will be like
[51:31] after the the Rapture of the church what
[51:34] the world will be like here after the
[51:36] Rapture of the church and and we have
[51:39] the opportunity right now to actually
[51:41] look judgment right in the face to look
[51:43] face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:46] to give ourselves on that altar right
[51:48] now and we have that opportunity and to
[51:51] have No Reservations about it but if we
[51:54] hold back if we have any reservations
[51:57] about it if we're not willing to just go
[51:59] all the way into Christ and get that
[52:01] Holy Spirit then you know what's
[52:02] happening is he is already judging that
[52:06] judge is already there his eyes are
[52:09] already as a flame of fire even though
[52:12] it hasn't actually come to pass
[52:14] naturally speaking it's already happened
[52:17] in the Lord's
[52:18] day now has John 5:22 come to pass for
[52:23] the father judgeth no man but hath
[52:25] committed all judgment unto the
[52:29] son his service has been rendered the
[52:32] priest her hood is over the days of the
[52:36] prophecy are finished he stands girded
[52:39] as the judge I just can't help but think
[52:42] about how far down the road we are from
[52:44] when this book was even published
[52:46] 1965 how close are we to seeing that
[52:50] that being that's being described here
[52:52] that judge the white wigged one we'll
[52:54] get into to that in a little bit the
[52:56] Sevenfold Glory of his person his head
[52:59] and his hair were white like wool as
[53:01] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[53:04] flame of fire and his feet like unto
[53:07] fine brass as if they burned in a
[53:09] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[53:11] many Waters and he had in his right hand
[53:14] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[53:16] sharp two-edged sword and his
[53:19] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[53:22] its strength that's Revelations 4 14- 16
[53:26] 1
[53:27] 14-6 How Deeply moving and inspiring was
[53:31] the appearing of Jesus to John who is in
[53:34] exile for the cause of the word and
[53:38] behold the Living Word now stands before
[53:42] him what an Illuminating vision for
[53:46] every descriptive attribute has a
[53:49] significance what a revelation of his
[53:51] glorious
[53:53] being I think it's so great the way
[53:55] brother bradam says that every
[53:58] single Des descriptive attribute has a
[54:02] significance and so he goes into it and
[54:05] and they're numbered one his hair as
[54:07] white as snow John first notices and
[54:10] mentions the whiteness of his hair it
[54:13] was white and bright as snow this was
[54:17] not because of his age oh
[54:20] no the brilliantly white hair does not
[54:23] signify age but experience maturity and
[54:28] wisdom and you know the Bible talks
[54:31] about the Hy head and how it has that
[54:34] that that person has experience and
[54:37] wisdom and here we have God choosing to
[54:40] manifest himself to identify himself in
[54:43] this format it's for a specific purpose
[54:47] it it shows it signifies The Experience
[54:51] maturity and the wisdom the Eternal one
[54:53] does not age amen what is time to God
[54:57] time means little to God but wisdom
[54:59] means
[55:02] much it as it is as when Solomon called
[55:07] to God for wisdom to judge the people of
[55:09] Israel now he is coming the judge of all
[55:13] the Earth he will be crowned with wisdom
[55:17] that is what the white and glistening
[55:19] hair
[55:21] signifies now he goes into Daniel
[55:24] chapter 7:
[55:26] 9-14 I beheld till the Thrones were cast
[55:29] down and the Ancient of Days did sit
[55:33] whose garment was white as snow and the
[55:35] hair of his head like the pure wool his
[55:39] throne was like a fiery flame and his
[55:41] wheels as burning
[55:44] fire a fiery stream issued and came
[55:47] forth from before him and a thousand
[55:50] thousands ministered unto him and 10,000
[55:54] times 10,000 thousand stood before him
[55:57] the Judgment was set and the books were
[56:00] open I beheld then because of the voice
[56:03] of the great words which the horn spake
[56:06] I beheld even till the Beast was slain
[56:10] and its body destroyed and given to the
[56:12] Burning
[56:14] Flame as concerning the rest of the
[56:16] beasts they had their Dominion taken
[56:18] away yet their lives were prolonged for
[56:21] a season and a
[56:23] time I saw in the night visions and
[56:26] behold one like the son of man came with
[56:29] the clouds of heaven and came to the
[56:32] Ancient of Days and they brought him
[56:35] near before me and there was given him
[56:38] dominion and glory and a kingdom that
[56:42] all people Nations and languages should
[56:45] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[56:49] Dominion which shall not pass away and
[56:52] his kingdom that which
[56:56] shall not be destroyed
[56:58] amen he says there it is Daniel saw him
[57:02] with that white
[57:04] hair he was the judge opening the books
[57:07] and judging out of them Daniel saw him
[57:11] coming in the clouds that is exactly
[57:14] what John
[57:15] saw and isn't it beautiful because it's
[57:17] exactly what the disciples saw in the
[57:20] book of Acts when they told them the two
[57:23] men standing there in white apparel what
[57:25] what are you doing here don't stand here
[57:26] and look up he's gone but they saw Jesus
[57:30] raise up into clouds they both saw him
[57:34] exactly the same they saw the judge with
[57:37] his judgment girdle over his shoulders
[57:40] standing pure and holy full of wisdom
[57:43] fully qualified to judge the world in
[57:46] righteousness hallelujah
[57:49] amen even the world understands this
[57:53] symbology this always
[57:55] got me this always kind of surprised me
[57:57] when I heard this it just makes perfect
[57:59] sense it's a little bit like the
[58:00] original sin in the Garden of Eden what
[58:04] happened there but this here even the
[58:06] world understands this symbology for in
[58:07] ancient times the judge would appear in
[58:09] convene Court dressed in a white wig and
[58:12] a long robe that signified his complete
[58:15] Authority head to foot robe to meet out
[58:20] Justice two his eyes as fire than of it
[58:26] those eyes that were once dimmed with
[58:29] tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that
[58:32] wept with compassion at the grave of
[58:36] Lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil
[58:40] of the murderers who hanged him on the
[58:43] cross but in sorrow cried father forgive
[58:47] them amen now those eyes are a flame of
[58:52] fire amen the eyes of of the judge who
[58:56] will recompense those who rejected
[59:00] him and it's so amazing to think about
[59:03] brothers and sisters it's not even those
[59:05] who actually maybe did something
[59:08] terrible to him throughout the ages just
[59:11] those who rejected him that's who he's
[59:13] going to
[59:16] recompense all of the human emotions he
[59:19] manifested the most when he appeared as
[59:22] the son of man was this one
[59:25] he wept
[59:26] often you ever get into the presence of
[59:28] God Amen you ever find yourself
[59:32] weeping and just know there's something
[59:35] special going on it's something that you
[59:36] can't even control amen hallelujah it's
[59:39] such a beautiful place to be but you
[59:41] know you can look at this and say this
[59:43] is the identification this is one
[59:45] attribute that Jesus had when he was
[59:47] here he wept often yet behind that
[59:50] weeping and that sorrow there was still
[59:53] God
[59:55] you remember brother bradam in that
[59:56] story The Woman said you put too much on
[59:58] Jesus and he said' whatat are you
[1:00:00] talking about and she said Jesus isn't
[1:00:03] God how could he cry at the grave of
[1:00:06] Lazarus and how on Earth could God not
[1:00:09] be man and God all in one it goes beyond
[1:00:13] our human comprehension to try and even
[1:00:15] understand it we just have to believe
[1:00:18] it but if God could create the universe
[1:00:21] he could come and stand in the form of a
[1:00:22] man amen there's no question about that
[1:00:26] and I think it's so beautiful because he
[1:00:27] could even do it in the form of an Angel
[1:00:29] because the word of God says that we
[1:00:30] entertain Angels sometimes
[1:00:33] unawares sometimes we don't even know
[1:00:35] who it is we're talking to and we could
[1:00:36] be talking to an angel yes amen it's a
[1:00:39] beautiful thing yet behind that weeping
[1:00:42] and the sorrow there was still God those
[1:00:44] same eyes saw Visions they looked deep
[1:00:46] within the hearts of men and read their
[1:00:49] very thoughts and knew all their various
[1:00:53] ways
[1:00:55] blazing out of mortal eyes was God who
[1:00:58] cried to those who knew him not for what
[1:01:02] he was I think it's beautiful when we
[1:01:05] can look at this and say you know he he
[1:01:07] he he had the ability to look deep into
[1:01:09] the hearts of men and you know we even
[1:01:11] had a prophet here that was able to look
[1:01:13] deep within the hearts of men but I want
[1:01:16] to say this when we have someone in
[1:01:19] involved in the five-fold ministry and
[1:01:21] and they begin to preach and an
[1:01:22] anointing comes down they have the
[1:01:24] ability to see into the hearts of men
[1:01:27] and maybe not like the prophet did or
[1:01:29] even like Jesus did but sometimes
[1:01:31] they'll start preaching about something
[1:01:33] and they'll wonder why am I preaching
[1:01:34] about this and someone in the audience
[1:01:36] or the congregation will be saying wow
[1:01:38] something is going on maybe somebody
[1:01:40] talked about something we've we've gone
[1:01:42] on and on about this brothers and
[1:01:43] sisters that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:46] amen yes same God Hebrews 138 Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:01:53] forever Jesus Christ that white wed one
[1:01:56] Jesus Christ the one with fire in his
[1:01:58] eyes Jesus Christ with feet as brass as
[1:02:02] fine brass representing judgment John
[1:02:06] 8:24 says if ye believe not that I am he
[1:02:10] ye shall die in your
[1:02:12] sins
[1:02:14] my John 10:37 to 38 if I do not the
[1:02:18] works of my father believe me not but if
[1:02:20] I do the works of my father though ye
[1:02:22] believe not me believe the
[1:02:27] works that's where brothers and sisters
[1:02:29] when we have the fruit of the spirit we
[1:02:30] can preach all we want but we either
[1:02:34] have the fruit or we don't have the
[1:02:35] fruit we either have the works that
[1:02:37] prove who we are or we don't have the
[1:02:40] works paragraph 51 like Jeremiah of old
[1:02:44] he was the weeping prophet for men
[1:02:47] receive not the word of God and thrust
[1:02:50] aside the
[1:02:52] Revelation and we know that that whole
[1:02:54] entire city was just decimated destroyed
[1:02:59] by the king of the north but they were
[1:03:01] warned over and over and over if you
[1:03:03] read the book of Jeremiah over and over
[1:03:06] he kept coming back excuse me he kept
[1:03:08] crying to them crying out to them just
[1:03:10] repent repent repent and they just
[1:03:12] wouldn't they didn't like him they
[1:03:14] didn't think that he was maybe polished
[1:03:17] enough for them he didn't fit into their
[1:03:20] their
[1:03:21] clicks paragraph 52 those fiery flaming
[1:03:25] eyes of the judge are even now recording
[1:03:29] the lives of All Flesh running to and
[1:03:33] fro throughout the Earth there is
[1:03:36] nothing he does not
[1:03:37] know isn't it wonderful to think that
[1:03:40] brothers and sisters every time I hear
[1:03:43] that now I just sigh and say Amen Lord
[1:03:46] you know my heart just like
[1:03:49] Peter Peter and John all of them Lord
[1:03:52] you know our hearts Do You Love Me Oh
[1:03:56] Lord you know my heart I I I fail you
[1:03:59] all the time but you know my heart I I
[1:04:01] want to serve you with all my heart my
[1:04:02] desire is there he knows the desires in
[1:04:06] the heart and what each one intends to
[1:04:09] do amen there's nothing hidden that
[1:04:12] shall not be revealed for all things are
[1:04:15] naked before him with whom we have to do
[1:04:19] think of it he knows even now what
[1:04:22] you're thinking amen
[1:04:24] I just love that because you know where
[1:04:28] we are right now isn't necessarily where
[1:04:31] we're going to be down the road and it
[1:04:33] might not necessarily be where we were
[1:04:35] in the past but right now is really what
[1:04:37] counts brothers and sisters amen it's
[1:04:40] the Difference Maker in our lives
[1:04:42] because we only have this moment and
[1:04:44] then when we go forwards second hand
[1:04:46] goes a little further then we've got
[1:04:48] that moment and every single time it's a
[1:04:51] moment that's why God came and
[1:04:53] identified him self with Moses as the I
[1:04:55] am because every single second he's
[1:04:58] present and it's the same way for us
[1:05:01] tonight he knows our very thoughts he
[1:05:03] knows what we're going to do he knows
[1:05:05] how we're going to
[1:05:06] act and it's such a beautiful thing I
[1:05:09] remember when I first heard that there
[1:05:10] was a prophet in the Land There was a
[1:05:13] prophet in the land and he had the
[1:05:14] ability to discern the hearts of uh
[1:05:16] thoughts in the heart of men and I I
[1:05:19] said it very clearly I don't even know
[1:05:20] if I said it out loud but in my mind I
[1:05:23] was shouting it I ain't never going to
[1:05:24] that church I'm never going to go there
[1:05:27] because I don't want anybody to know
[1:05:28] what I've done I've not been a good
[1:05:30] person I've been a bad person in many
[1:05:33] different ways and you know I I thought
[1:05:35] that I have to hide myself and isn't it
[1:05:37] interesting because it's exactly the way
[1:05:40] Adam and Eve were in the garden they
[1:05:42] wanted to try and hide themselves they
[1:05:43] didn't want to expose thems to to God
[1:05:46] where everything before him was naked
[1:05:49] right but now the desire of my heart is
[1:05:52] to throw myself at the
[1:05:54] Lord search me and try me let me be a
[1:05:59] new creature in Christ Jesus I don't
[1:06:01] want to be the old man I don't want to
[1:06:02] be afraid I I want to know my Lord when
[1:06:06] he comes around I want to be thankful
[1:06:08] that he's around I want to invite him
[1:06:10] around thank like we talked about on
[1:06:12] Sunday there should be nothing that we
[1:06:13] could do out in the world that we
[1:06:15] wouldn't do in here right nothing that
[1:06:18] we would be embarrassed to bring into
[1:06:19] this building you know I could bring a
[1:06:21] rifle in here I wouldn't be embarrassed
[1:06:23] about that I like to hunt but I could
[1:06:24] bring it in here I could bring my
[1:06:25] hunting gear I'm sure brother Sam could
[1:06:27] do that we could bring our fishing gear
[1:06:29] we wouldn't be embarrassed about that
[1:06:31] but what about other things that we do
[1:06:32] in our lives would be embarrassed to
[1:06:34] bring those into the church and to the
[1:06:35] congregation of the Lord if we are then
[1:06:38] why are we doing
[1:06:39] them amen leave him
[1:06:41] alone and we can hide it hide it from
[1:06:45] church but we're not hiding it from God
[1:06:46] because he knows he knows exactly where
[1:06:48] we are he knows the desires of the heart
[1:06:52] and what each one intends to do there's
[1:06:54] nothing hidden that shall not be
[1:06:56] revealed for all things are naked before
[1:06:59] him with whom we have to do think of it
[1:07:01] he knows even now what you're thinking
[1:07:04] probably brother Barry you better quit
[1:07:05] harping on that but you know it's not
[1:07:07] just me I'll tell you that it's not just
[1:07:09] me it's the Lord yes there he stands as
[1:07:13] judge with flaming eyes to meet out
[1:07:16] judgment the day of Mercy is over oh
[1:07:20] that men would repent and seek his face
[1:07:22] in righteousness while they is yet time
[1:07:25] that they might make his bosom their
[1:07:27] pillow a the world dissolves in
[1:07:32] fire I was listening to a brother
[1:07:34] preaching about love and I just thought
[1:07:36] that's so fitting wouldn't we want to
[1:07:38] lay our head on his bosom wouldn't we
[1:07:41] just want to love on him wouldn't we
[1:07:43] just want him to love on
[1:07:45] us do we do that with our spouses are we
[1:07:48] able to if we aren't why aren't we
[1:07:52] because really our relationship with
[1:07:53] with our spouse is an example of our
[1:07:55] relationship with
[1:07:57] Christ it's a direct Earthly example of
[1:08:01] our relationship with God Almighty
[1:08:04] husband and wife remember in Ephesians
[1:08:07] he spoke about that being a mystery and
[1:08:10] he talks about husbands and wives loving
[1:08:12] your loving your your wives and and
[1:08:14] reverencing your husbands and and on and
[1:08:16] on and on but right at the very end he
[1:08:18] says I'm saying all this to say to you
[1:08:20] I'm not speaking about this I'm speaking
[1:08:21] about the mystery of God and his
[1:08:26] bride he knows exactly where we are but
[1:08:29] one thing about it there should be the
[1:08:31] desire in our heart just to love on him
[1:08:34] and we I know it for sure we all want
[1:08:36] him to love on us but are we willing to
[1:08:37] love on
[1:08:39] him that's what he's looking
[1:08:42] for brothers if you ever get married
[1:08:44] you're going to want to have a wife
[1:08:46] that's going to want to love on you and
[1:08:48] and it's going to be a direct example of
[1:08:51] what God is looking for you as a husband
[1:08:55] because the husband is the one that
[1:08:56] actually sanctifies the
[1:08:58] house and if the husband isn't in love
[1:09:01] with the Lord loving on the Lord then
[1:09:03] look
[1:09:05] out three the feet of brass and his feet
[1:09:09] like unto fine brass as if they burned
[1:09:12] in a furnace brass is noted for its
[1:09:15] remarkable hardness there is nothing
[1:09:18] that is known that you can put with it
[1:09:21] to temper
[1:09:22] it you know I I thought about this and
[1:09:25] and so I just considered it for a little
[1:09:28] bit and I've worked a little bit with
[1:09:29] metal and for those people that have
[1:09:31] worked with metal you'll understand what
[1:09:32] I'm talking about but you know what it
[1:09:34] means to temper it it doesn't mean to
[1:09:36] quench it necessarily you can actually
[1:09:38] change the Metallurgy of metal you can
[1:09:40] change the chemical composition of metal
[1:09:42] and make metal different actual uh I
[1:09:45] don't think they're elements but Alloys
[1:09:47] I would say and I'm not claiming to be
[1:09:49] an expert about it but I know this much
[1:09:51] you can take metal that's just a regular
[1:09:53] call it a tul steel a high-speed steel
[1:09:56] which is a very strong metal it has
[1:09:59] metallic composition it's an alloy so
[1:10:01] it's made up of different Metals but you
[1:10:03] can take it and actually heat it up get
[1:10:06] it just to the right temperature just a
[1:10:08] really good Cherry orange and then
[1:10:10] quench it and the way you quench it is
[1:10:12] in oil sometimes people will do it in
[1:10:14] water it it can go too quickly and and
[1:10:16] make the metal crack but if you quench
[1:10:18] it properly in oil you can make that
[1:10:20] metal so hard on what they call the Rock
[1:10:23] scale you can make it so hard you could
[1:10:26] take that metal and drop it on a
[1:10:28] concrete floor and it would shatter like
[1:10:30] glass that's how hard and brittle that
[1:10:32] metal would be but just a few moments
[1:10:34] earlier before you did that you could
[1:10:36] drop it on the floor and it would just
[1:10:37] make a clanging sound and it would just
[1:10:39] vibrate and land and maybe have a
[1:10:41] scratch or a dent on it but what I'm
[1:10:43] saying is when you temper that metal you
[1:10:47] you you actually take it from that
[1:10:48] really uh I think it's called martinz I
[1:10:51] I could Martin Zite Maybe but you take
[1:10:54] that metal once it's been hardened to
[1:10:56] its absolute hardest point and then you
[1:10:59] take it and you put it in an oven for a
[1:11:01] few different Cycles you'll put it in
[1:11:02] the oven at a certain temperature for a
[1:11:04] certain amount of time and then pull it
[1:11:06] out and let it cool down and then put it
[1:11:08] back in the oven and get it up to
[1:11:09] temperature for a certain amount of time
[1:11:11] and pull it out and let it cool down and
[1:11:12] what happens is every time you do that
[1:11:14] it softens the metal in a controlled
[1:11:17] state but it still gives you the ability
[1:11:19] to keep it really really hard that's
[1:11:21] your metal lesson for tonight but but
[1:11:23] what I'm saying is brother Bram talks
[1:11:25] about there's nothing that you can put
[1:11:27] with brass to temper it you cannot take
[1:11:29] away the hardness of brass it's there
[1:11:33] that way for a very specific purpose and
[1:11:35] I love the way he goes into the Brazen
[1:11:37] altar in a little bit here we'll get
[1:11:39] into that but there is nothing that is
[1:11:41] known that you can put to temper it but
[1:11:45] the this brass that describes his feet
[1:11:47] is more remarkable yet in that it has
[1:11:51] stood the test of the fiery furnace
[1:11:54] maybe it's been tested to see if it
[1:11:56] could actually come down from being so
[1:11:58] hard but it's not going to be that
[1:12:00] judgment is going to remain the same
[1:12:02] exactly according to his
[1:12:04] word his feet is more remarkable yet in
[1:12:07] that it stood the test in the fiery
[1:12:09] furnace a test that no other one has
[1:12:12] gone through and that is exactly right
[1:12:15] for brass signifies Divine judgment a
[1:12:19] judgment that God decreed and brought to
[1:12:22] pass in John 3:14 to19 and as Moses
[1:12:27] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[1:12:29] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:12:34] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:12:36] not perish but have eternal life for God
[1:12:41] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:12:43] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:12:46] him should not perish but have
[1:12:49] everlasting life for God sent not his
[1:12:52] son into the world to to condemn the
[1:12:55] world but that the world through him
[1:12:57] might be
[1:12:59] saved he that believeth on him is not
[1:13:01] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:13:04] condemned already because he hath not
[1:13:06] believed in the name of the only
[1:13:08] begotten Son of God and this is the
[1:13:12] condemnation that light is come into the
[1:13:15] world and Men love Darkness rather than
[1:13:18] light because their deeds were
[1:13:22] evil
[1:13:25] numbers 21
[1:13:27] 8-9 and the Lord said unto Moses make
[1:13:29] thee a fiery Serpent and set it on a
[1:13:31] pole and it shall come to pass that
[1:13:33] everyone that is bitten when he lookth
[1:13:35] upon it shall live and Moses made a
[1:13:38] serpent of brass and put it upon a pole
[1:13:40] and it came to pass that if a serpent
[1:13:43] had bitten any man when he h had beheld
[1:13:47] the serpent of brass he
[1:13:50] lived now we know that Israel had sinned
[1:13:54] Israel had sinned a terrible sin and God
[1:13:57] was fed up with them and so what did he
[1:13:59] do he sent fiery serpents through the
[1:14:01] camp through the two million people to
[1:14:05] let them know I'm done with you acting
[1:14:07] the way you are behaving like you're
[1:14:09] religious but just doing whatever you
[1:14:11] want to do just doing a tradition so now
[1:14:13] you're going to deal with the fiery
[1:14:15] serpents and you know isn't that kind of
[1:14:17] a type of the way things are for us in
[1:14:18] our day we have fiery serpents we've got
[1:14:21] tormentors devils and once in a while
[1:14:24] God will say you know what it's time to
[1:14:25] put a little pressure on it's time to
[1:14:27] actually get you looking back at me not
[1:14:31] looking at all of the things in the
[1:14:32] world Hallelujah Israel had sinned and
[1:14:35] God gave them away he made a provision
[1:14:38] for them he gave them the plague and you
[1:14:40] know what Aaron and Moses they followed
[1:14:43] the word of the Lord and they were able
[1:14:45] to stay the plague because they followed
[1:14:47] the word of the Lord the prophet for
[1:14:48] their day followed the word of the Lord
[1:14:50] and then they gave the message that
[1:14:52] message to the people who had sinned who
[1:14:55] were out of control who were busy doing
[1:14:57] their own things with their own thoughts
[1:14:59] gave them the instruction just follow
[1:15:03] the prophet's word and you'll live just
[1:15:05] look at that fiery Serpent and and know
[1:15:09] that he's not going to kill you if you
[1:15:11] look at that brass serpent on the
[1:15:13] pole what a tremendous thing that is to
[1:15:16] know that there was a provision made for
[1:15:18] them there was a way that God gave them
[1:15:20] so that they could live and you know we
[1:15:22] have the ability in our day to look away
[1:15:24] to Jesus and when we say we look away to
[1:15:27] Jesus the only way we can do it is
[1:15:29] through this message of the hour because
[1:15:32] many people claim they're looking away
[1:15:33] to Jesus but they'll still go out to the
[1:15:35] bar and have a drink and say
[1:15:36] everything's fine I'm saved everything
[1:15:39] is great there's no issue with us but
[1:15:42] what kind of example are they
[1:15:45] setting Israel had sinned brother Bram
[1:15:48] says paragraph 55 sin had to be judged
[1:15:52] so God commanded Moses to place a Brazen
[1:15:55] serpent on a pole and he who looked was
[1:15:59] saved from the penalty of his
[1:16:02] sin the Brazen serpent on the pole
[1:16:05] symbolized Sin from the Garden of
[1:16:08] Eden where the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:16:12] causing her to
[1:16:13] sin brass speaks of judgment as it is
[1:16:18] seen in the Brazen altar where the
[1:16:20] penalty for sin was met in the sacrifice
[1:16:24] upon the altar do you have that slide
[1:16:27] brother
[1:16:32] Logan and I didn't bring the pointer but
[1:16:35] it doesn't
[1:16:38] matter the line the dotted line is the
[1:16:42] temple in the
[1:16:44] wilderness that's the outer court and
[1:16:47] then we have the walls of the temple
[1:16:48] here the straight lines that is the
[1:16:52] Tabernacle and over here is the Brazen
[1:16:55] altar this uh brass looking thing here
[1:16:58] on the right and that's in the outer
[1:16:59] court and that is where the people came
[1:17:03] and actually gave their sacrifice
[1:17:05] offered their sacrifice on that altar
[1:17:07] the Brazen altar made of brass
[1:17:10] signifying judgment that's what brother
[1:17:12] bradam is talking about here that Brazen
[1:17:14] altar where the penalty for sin was met
[1:17:17] in the sacrifice upon the altar many
[1:17:20] times we talk about the Altar and I know
[1:17:23] as a child I often thought that the
[1:17:25] altar was like right here the stairs at
[1:17:27] the front of the building when we speak
[1:17:29] about altar in this context that's it
[1:17:32] there there was burning coals and the
[1:17:34] Flesh of the animal the insides the
[1:17:36] outsides there's very specific
[1:17:38] directions in in the Book of Leviticus I
[1:17:41] believe it is where God shows says
[1:17:43] exactly what's going to happen with this
[1:17:45] sacrifice but that was the sin altar
[1:17:48] that's where our sins were laid down and
[1:17:50] we have the opportunity obviously to to
[1:17:53] lay our sins down on our own Brazen
[1:17:54] altar of judgment with the Lord when we
[1:17:57] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:17:59] right brothers and sisters where the
[1:18:01] penalty of sin was met for the sacrifice
[1:18:03] upon the altar when God judged Israel
[1:18:06] for her sins in the Days of Elijah he
[1:18:09] withheld the rain and the fiery Heavens
[1:18:12] became as brass thank you brother Logan
[1:18:16] now in this illustration we see that the
[1:18:19] serpent upon the pole represents sin
[1:18:24] already
[1:18:26] judged for It's Made of brass showing
[1:18:29] Divine judgment had already fallen upon
[1:18:34] sin then whoever looked at the serpent
[1:18:37] on the pole accepting the significance
[1:18:41] of it was made whole for this was the
[1:18:45] work or salvation of the
[1:18:49] Lord now I just as I was studying it and
[1:18:52] and as I'm talking talking about it I
[1:18:53] just can't help but think you know the
[1:18:55] people who were living in sin who were
[1:18:58] committing sin because it wasn't I don't
[1:19:01] think it was just random people that got
[1:19:02] bit by snakes it was people that were
[1:19:05] actually sinning right it was the people
[1:19:07] that weren't living right a and the
[1:19:09] snakes came and they actually bit them
[1:19:12] and and when they got bit because who
[1:19:14] can live in this world without sinning
[1:19:16] but when they got bit I can imagine they
[1:19:19] had a very Hardy look at that serpent on
[1:19:22] the pole
[1:19:23] would you think they didn't look at it
[1:19:25] just with a sideways glance it it
[1:19:27] wouldn't have been just a you know just
[1:19:29] a quick glance and look away and do
[1:19:32] their own thing they would have been
[1:19:33] very very intently looking at that brass
[1:19:36] pole they would have been looking to see
[1:19:38] where that was they might even have
[1:19:40] brought binoculars or glasses with them
[1:19:42] to make sure that they would be able to
[1:19:44] see it very Crystal Clear they wouldn't
[1:19:47] be looking at two different things at
[1:19:49] the same
[1:19:51] time
[1:19:53] I just can't help but think it's just a
[1:19:55] beautiful
[1:19:56] thing we have the ability to look at it
[1:19:59] the serpent on the pole is a type of
[1:20:02] what Jesus came into the Earth to
[1:20:04] accomplish amen he was made flesh in
[1:20:08] order to take upon himself the judgments
[1:20:10] of God for
[1:20:12] sin the
[1:20:14] foundation of the altar of sacrifice was
[1:20:18] solid
[1:20:19] brass typifying the lamb slain from
[1:20:22] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:25] judgment had already passed upon
[1:20:29] him when as yet there were no
[1:20:33] Sinners I just think that's
[1:20:35] beautiful we can look at this and say
[1:20:38] yeah praise God I'm saved before the
[1:20:41] foundation of the world I'm saved if we
[1:20:43] truly catch that Revelation then we're
[1:20:44] going to live our lives according to the
[1:20:46] word of God Amen we're not going to be
[1:20:48] doing double standards we're not going
[1:20:50] to be living one way in church and then
[1:20:52] running out in the world and doing
[1:20:53] something else it's going to be the same
[1:20:55] same it's not going to be a different
[1:20:58] thing but you know what that judgment
[1:21:00] it's already passed brothers and sisters
[1:21:02] we have reason to Rejoice we have reason
[1:21:04] to praise it was already passed upon Him
[1:21:08] Upon Jesus when he was yet there were no
[1:21:12] Sinners salvation being entirely of the
[1:21:15] Lord he trod The Wine Press of the
[1:21:17] fierceness of the wrath of God
[1:21:20] Alone his vestures were died Crimson
[1:21:24] with his own blood the fiery furnace of
[1:21:27] the just judgment and wrath of God was
[1:21:30] his
[1:21:30] portion he
[1:21:32] suffered the just for the unjust Thou
[1:21:36] Art Worthy oh Lamb of God for thou Hast
[1:21:39] redeemed Us by thine own
[1:21:42] blood Isaiah 535 and6 he was wounded for
[1:21:45] our
[1:21:46] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:21:49] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:21:52] was upon on him and by his stripes we
[1:21:54] are healed amen and the Lord hath laid
[1:21:58] upon him the iniquity of us
[1:22:01] all I think that's so beautiful brothers
[1:22:04] and sisters we could just take that and
[1:22:05] know that every time we ask the Lord to
[1:22:08] just take the iniquity out of the way
[1:22:10] he's already done it and he's just
[1:22:12] waiting for us to come to him in in
[1:22:15] acknowledgment with what he's already
[1:22:17] done that is such a beautiful
[1:22:21] thing he suffered as no man ever
[1:22:23] suffered even before the cross he had
[1:22:27] shed great drops of sweat like blood
[1:22:30] from his body as in the intense Agony of
[1:22:32] the ordeal
[1:22:34] ahead the very blood separated in his
[1:22:38] veins can you imagine
[1:22:41] that and being in agony he prayed more
[1:22:44] earnestly and his sweat was as it were
[1:22:48] great drops of blood falling down to the
[1:22:50] ground Luke 224
[1:22:54] 44 I'll never forget the first time I
[1:22:56] heard brother Ken preach this he said
[1:22:59] that the very first blood that touched
[1:23:02] the Earth was in The Garden of
[1:23:04] Gethsemane where he laid down his own
[1:23:07] will where he laid down his life that
[1:23:10] was where Redemption started on Earth
[1:23:12] the Earthly manifestation of it I
[1:23:15] thought my goodness how could I ever
[1:23:17] pray that
[1:23:19] much paragraph 59 but someday those feet
[1:23:22] of brass will stand upon the Earth and
[1:23:25] you know brothers and sisters that's not
[1:23:27] the second coming of the
[1:23:28] Lord that's not the second coming of the
[1:23:31] Lord that's going to be after we meet
[1:23:35] him in the air because the second coming
[1:23:37] of the lord we meet with him in the
[1:23:39] clouds first the dead in Christ rise and
[1:23:42] we together meet them and then we meet
[1:23:45] him in the sky but someday those feet of
[1:23:48] brass will stand upon the earth and the
[1:23:50] judge of all the Earth he shall be with
[1:23:53] equity and Perfection he will judge
[1:23:56] Mankind and there will be no evading
[1:24:00] that judgment no turning of that
[1:24:03] Justice there will be no tempering of it
[1:24:07] remember tempering it's not quenching in
[1:24:10] in the oil it's not putting it out
[1:24:13] tempering is actually changing the
[1:24:14] hardness of it there's going to be no
[1:24:16] changing the hardness of his judgment
[1:24:18] when that time
[1:24:20] comes he that is unjust will be unjust
[1:24:23] still he that is filthy will be filthy
[1:24:25] still the unchanging one will not change
[1:24:28] then for he will he never has and never
[1:24:32] will those feet of brass will crush the
[1:24:35] enemy they will destroy the Antichrist
[1:24:39] the Beast and the image and all that is
[1:24:42] vile in his sight he will destroy the
[1:24:45] church systems that have taken his name
[1:24:48] only to corrupt its Brilliance and crush
[1:24:52] them along with the
[1:24:55] Antichrist I just thought man this was
[1:24:57] written in 1965
[1:25:00] hey isn't it interesting how all the
[1:25:04] Wicked the atheists the agnostics the
[1:25:08] modness the Liberals will all be there
[1:25:12] death hell and the grave will be there
[1:25:16] yes they will for when he comes the
[1:25:19] books will be open that is when even the
[1:25:22] lukewarm church and the five foolish
[1:25:25] virgins will
[1:25:27] appear he will separate the sheep from
[1:25:29] the goats when he comes he will take
[1:25:32] over the kingdom for it is his and with
[1:25:35] him will be the thousands times 10
[1:25:39] thousands and you know brothers and
[1:25:41] sisters when we talk about this we don't
[1:25:42] have to have any fear any children that
[1:25:45] might be listening might be afraid
[1:25:47] thinking that there's going to be
[1:25:48] something fearful in that time and it
[1:25:50] will be but you know we're not going to
[1:25:51] be in in front of that Throne we're
[1:25:53] going to be in that Throne we're going
[1:25:55] to be with him in his throne there's no
[1:25:59] fear of standing before that Throne
[1:26:01] unless you choose not to accept this
[1:26:03] message of the hour the way that it's
[1:26:04] given to us if we choose to actually
[1:26:07] just negate it in any way then we may
[1:26:11] find ourselves Standing There Brother
[1:26:13] Bron goes on to say his bride who come
[1:26:15] to minister to him glory
[1:26:18] oh it's now or never repent before it's
[1:26:22] too late wake up from amongst the dead
[1:26:26] and seek God to
[1:26:29] what to be filled with his Spirit or you
[1:26:34] will miss eternal life do it now while
[1:26:37] there's
[1:26:38] time isn't it wonderful we still have
[1:26:41] time yes we have the ability to be
[1:26:44] filled with his Spirit without his
[1:26:45] Spirit we're not going to be there we
[1:26:48] won't be in that Throne just by saying
[1:26:50] we've got the message of the hour won't
[1:26:52] put us in that Throne brothers and
[1:26:53] sisters we've got to be filled with his
[1:26:55] spirit and when we're filled with his
[1:26:57] Spirit we become a new creature in
[1:26:58] Christ Jesus and we live our lives
[1:27:02] differently do it now while there's time
[1:27:05] he goes on to number four his voice was
[1:27:08] as the sound of many Waters now what do
[1:27:11] the waters represent in Revelation 17:15
[1:27:14] the waters which thou s are peoples and
[1:27:18] multitudes and Nations and
[1:27:20] tongues his voice
[1:27:23] was as the sound of multitude speaking
[1:27:25] what is it it is the Judgment for these
[1:27:29] are the voices of the multitudes of
[1:27:31] witnesses who by the Holy Spirit All
[1:27:34] Through the Ages have testified to
[1:27:36] Christ and preached his gospel it will
[1:27:40] be the voice of every man rising in
[1:27:43] judgment Against The Sinner who will not
[1:27:45] take warning the voices of the seven
[1:27:48] Messengers will be heard loud and clear
[1:27:52] amen and I just can't help but think as
[1:27:54] we study this those voices are being
[1:27:57] heard loud and clear amen those faithful
[1:28:00] preachers who preached the saving power
[1:28:02] of Jesus who preached water baptism in
[1:28:06] jesus' name who preached the infilling
[1:28:09] and power of the Holy Ghost who stood
[1:28:12] with the word more than they stood with
[1:28:14] their own lives all of them were the
[1:28:17] voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] down Through the Ages
[1:28:23] John 17:20 neither pray I for these
[1:28:26] alone but for them also which Shall
[1:28:29] Believe on me through their word isn't
[1:28:32] that beautiful Jesus prayed for us in
[1:28:35] the garden he prayed for us when he
[1:28:38] prayed for his disciples there he prayed
[1:28:41] for everyone all that believe on him
[1:28:45] through their word through our
[1:28:50] testimony have you ever ever thought how
[1:28:52] terrifying it is to a man drifting
[1:28:54] helplessly toward a
[1:28:57] cataract think of it now as think now of
[1:29:02] that Roar as he approaches his sure and
[1:29:06] certain
[1:29:07] doom and just
[1:29:09] exactly like that day sorry and just
[1:29:14] exactly like that is coming the day of
[1:29:17] judgment when the Roar of the multitude
[1:29:19] of
[1:29:20] voices condemns you you for not having
[1:29:23] paid heed air it was too
[1:29:28] late take heed this very hour for at
[1:29:32] this moment your thoughts are being
[1:29:34] recorded in
[1:29:36] Heaven There your thoughts speak louder
[1:29:39] than your
[1:29:40] words like the Pharisee who claimed so
[1:29:44] much with his
[1:29:46] mouth but not listening to the
[1:29:48] Lord his heart became corrupt and Evil
[1:29:52] until it was too
[1:29:54] late even now this could be your last
[1:29:58] call to hear the
[1:30:00] word and receive it unto eternal
[1:30:03] life it will be too late when you
[1:30:06] approach the Roar of the many voices of
[1:30:09] judgment and
[1:30:10] doom that's why I just was thinking
[1:30:12] tonight you know how when we come to
[1:30:15] service those people that just craved to
[1:30:20] worship God in in spirit and in truth
[1:30:24] freely and were
[1:30:26] restricted they were persecuted for it
[1:30:29] and we have full complete Liberty to do
[1:30:31] it the way that he has given in our day
[1:30:34] and for us to not give all all we've got
[1:30:36] our very best they're the ones their
[1:30:39] voices are going to be saying you
[1:30:40] actually could have worshiped you could
[1:30:41] have done that and you didn't but you
[1:30:44] believed what's wrong why wouldn't you
[1:30:47] do
[1:30:48] it it's amazing to think about
[1:30:55] even now this could be your last call to
[1:30:57] hear the word and receive it unto
[1:30:59] eternal life it'll be too late when you
[1:31:02] approach that the Roar of the many
[1:31:05] voices of judgment and doom but have you
[1:31:07] ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the
[1:31:09] sound of water can
[1:31:11] be i' like to fish I'd like to find a
[1:31:15] spot where the water is whispering in
[1:31:18] ripples do you ever do that you ever
[1:31:20] just go out in the woods and find a
[1:31:21] stream
[1:31:22] and just lay back and have a little nap
[1:31:24] beside it just listening to the water
[1:31:27] it's it's a wonderful thing if you've
[1:31:28] never done it I highly recommend it get
[1:31:30] in a beautiful day and just go and and
[1:31:33] and and enjoy it it's interesting how
[1:31:35] brother Brandon brings this comparison
[1:31:37] hey the Roar of the voices of the people
[1:31:40] the Roar of the Cataract the Roar of the
[1:31:43] Doom if you've ever been to a place
[1:31:45] where there's waterfalls it's very
[1:31:46] terrifying thing it's very loud and
[1:31:49] distracting but when you get into a
[1:31:51] place where where it's really slow and
[1:31:53] and just Rippling it's so calm and
[1:31:54] soothing it's a beautiful thing brother
[1:31:57] bradam says I can just lay back and hear
[1:31:59] it speaking peace and joy and
[1:32:01] contentment to my heart we're all real
[1:32:04] familiar with the artisian well that
[1:32:06] brother bam talks about how it just
[1:32:08] keeps bubbling up the water just keeps
[1:32:09] coming out of the ground it's bubbling
[1:32:11] it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soul
[1:32:13] that's kind of like a Believer right and
[1:32:16] he says why why are you so happy why do
[1:32:18] you keep bubbling and he's he's
[1:32:20] imagining that it's saying back to him
[1:32:22] you know it's just coming from the
[1:32:23] inside I just can't stop it it's just
[1:32:25] who I am nothing's going to stop it from
[1:32:27] coming forward I can't contain it it's
[1:32:31] beautiful he says I can just lie back
[1:32:33] and hear it speak peace and joy and
[1:32:35] contentment to my heart how glad I am to
[1:32:37] be anchored in the Haven of Rest where
[1:32:40] the voice of the Lord speaks peace as
[1:32:42] the word of waters of Separation hath
[1:32:45] declared how thankful we should be to
[1:32:48] hear his voice of love and care and
[1:32:51] guide idance and
[1:32:53] protection you know brothers and sisters
[1:32:55] it's just something that's been on my
[1:32:56] heart and I I really want to talk about
[1:32:59] it going into the future here but we we
[1:33:01] we talk about the voice of the Lord the
[1:33:04] voice of the Lord and many times we can
[1:33:07] say the voice of the Lord is the voice
[1:33:09] of the Vindicated prophet and that's
[1:33:10] true because he had thus sayith the Lord
[1:33:13] but what about the voice of the Lord in
[1:33:16] you because if you don't have the voice
[1:33:18] of the Lord in you then you don't have
[1:33:21] the Lord now that might be real tough
[1:33:24] and strong maybe it's it's wrong and and
[1:33:27] erroneous and I would certainly be
[1:33:29] interested in a conversation but we have
[1:33:31] got to have a personal relationship with
[1:33:33] him and brother bradam says it I know he
[1:33:35] says it that we've got to be willing to
[1:33:36] talk to him and go on our knees and
[1:33:38] spend time in prayer but then we've got
[1:33:40] to be just as willing to sit back and
[1:33:43] listen what are we listening for
[1:33:46] listening for his voice and if we can't
[1:33:48] hear his voice then we need to work on
[1:33:50] tuning things out in our life quieting
[1:33:52] things down maybe go and get by a brook
[1:33:54] a stream maybe go and sit on a mountain
[1:33:57] or in a valley whatever we need to do
[1:33:59] but get quiet enough to allow him to
[1:34:02] speak to us and I know brothers and
[1:34:04] sisters that he speaks to us all the
[1:34:06] time we just need to get quiet enough to
[1:34:08] hear it that's
[1:34:14] all brother Brown goes on to say some
[1:34:17] someday we will hear that same sweet
[1:34:20] voice speak
[1:34:22] not in judgment but in welcome to us
[1:34:26] whose sins have been remitted by his
[1:34:28] blood whose lives have been
[1:34:31] Spirit-filled and whose walk was in the
[1:34:35] word what could be more precious than to
[1:34:38] hear the multitudes of welcoming voices
[1:34:41] and be surrounded by those multitudes
[1:34:43] who have believed unto eternal life oh
[1:34:46] there is nothing like it I pray that you
[1:34:48] will hear his voice and Harden not not
[1:34:51] your heart but receive him as your
[1:34:56] king
[1:34:58] oh if you would only see it it was the
[1:35:01] waters that destroyed the world but it
[1:35:04] was the same Waters that saved
[1:35:06] Noah and also saved the whole earth for
[1:35:10] Noah yes listen to his voice the voice
[1:35:14] of his servants as it calls to
[1:35:17] repentance and
[1:35:20] life five
[1:35:22] in his right hand were Seven
[1:35:25] Stars I just want to go back and just uh
[1:35:29] mention this because I think it's
[1:35:31] important
[1:35:35] uh here with
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:46] me maybe I won't be able to find it
[1:35:49] yeah and no
[1:35:54] sorry in his right
[1:35:56] hand were seven
[1:35:58] stars and he had in his right hand Seven
[1:36:01] Stars now of course we already know from
[1:36:04] verse
[1:36:05] 20 what the Seven Stars actually are and
[1:36:08] the Mystery of the Seven Stars are the
[1:36:10] Angels messengers of the seven
[1:36:13] churches now we couldn't make a mistake
[1:36:16] here on any account as he interprets us
[1:36:20] interprets it for us
[1:36:21] these Seven Stars Are The Messengers to
[1:36:24] the seven successive Church ages they
[1:36:27] are not called by name they are just set
[1:36:31] forth as seven one to each age from the
[1:36:34] Ephesian age on down to this leodan age
[1:36:37] each messenger brought the message of
[1:36:39] Truth to the people never failing to
[1:36:41] keep it the word of God to that
[1:36:45] particular Church age each one held to
[1:36:48] it they were steadfast in their loyalty
[1:36:51] to the original light
[1:36:53] amen and it's wonderful to think that
[1:36:56] we're steadfast as
[1:36:58] well as each age pulled away from God
[1:37:02] his faithful messenger turned that age
[1:37:05] back to the
[1:37:06] word their strength was from the Lord or
[1:37:09] they never could have stemmed the tide
[1:37:12] they were safe in his care for nothing
[1:37:15] could pluck them out of his hand and
[1:37:17] neither could anything separate them
[1:37:19] from the love of God Let It Be sickness
[1:37:22] Peril nakedness famine sword life or
[1:37:26] death they were truly yielded to him and
[1:37:30] kept by his
[1:37:33] omnipotence they were not concerned
[1:37:35] about the persecution that came their
[1:37:37] way pain and derision was but caused to
[1:37:42] give glory to God that they were counted
[1:37:45] worthy to suffer for
[1:37:47] him and in thankfulness for his
[1:37:52] salvation they burned with the light of
[1:37:55] his life and reflected his
[1:37:59] love and reflected his
[1:38:02] patience and reflected his
[1:38:05] meekness and reflected his
[1:38:08] Temperance and reflected his
[1:38:11] gentleness and reflected his
[1:38:14] faithfulness and God backed them up with
[1:38:18] wonders signs and
[1:38:22] Miracles they were accused of being
[1:38:24] Fanatics and holy
[1:38:26] rollers they were denounced by
[1:38:29] organizations and held in
[1:38:31] mockery but they kept true to the
[1:38:35] word now it's not hard to stand up and
[1:38:39] be true to a Creed it is easy for the
[1:38:43] Devil is right behind all that but it is
[1:38:47] something else to be true to God's word
[1:38:50] and to to go back to what the word
[1:38:52] originally produced at
[1:38:55] Pentecost brothers and sisters tonight I
[1:38:57] just want to say to us it is something
[1:39:00] else to go back it's something else to
[1:39:03] be true to God's word yes but we've got
[1:39:07] to be true not only to the printed word
[1:39:09] of
[1:39:10] God and the message of the
[1:39:15] hour we got to be true to that word in
[1:39:17] our heart amen and if that word in our
[1:39:21] heart is truly the word of God then it
[1:39:24] will line up with the word in print and
[1:39:27] it will line up with the message in
[1:39:29] print yes sir because the spirit and the
[1:39:32] bride will all be saying the same thing
[1:39:35] the spirit the prophet and the bride
[1:39:37] will all be speaking the same language
[1:39:39] it won't be different language it won't
[1:39:42] be something for a different age it'll
[1:39:43] be the same same
[1:39:46] same I think it's just so beautiful and
[1:39:49] in thankfulness for his salvation they
[1:39:51] burned with the light of his life and
[1:39:54] reflected his love patience meekness
[1:39:56] Temperance gentleness faithfulness and
[1:39:59] God backed them up with wonders signs
[1:40:02] and
[1:40:03] miracles and they were accused of being
[1:40:06] Fanatics holy rulers they were denounced
[1:40:08] by organizations and held in mockery but
[1:40:11] they kept true to the word amen now it's
[1:40:13] not hard to stand up and keep true to a
[1:40:16] Creed it's easy for the Devil is right
[1:40:20] behind all that
[1:40:23] but it is something else to be true to
[1:40:25] God's word and to go back to what the
[1:40:28] word originally produced at
[1:40:31] Pentecost and I believe with all my
[1:40:33] heart that all of us want to see that in
[1:40:36] our lives in our homes in our church
[1:40:40] when we see the devil come in like a
[1:40:42] flood we want to be able to stand as
[1:40:44] that standard against that enemy and and
[1:40:47] just withstand that flood and rebuke the
[1:40:49] devil and not have condemnation in our
[1:40:51] heart if we've got condemnation in our
[1:40:53] heart we can't have confidence towards
[1:40:55] God can
[1:40:56] we we have to say oh my I'm going to
[1:40:58] have to go and have a prayer meeting
[1:40:59] first before I can rebuke that devil but
[1:41:01] what about if you need that prayer right
[1:41:03] now what about that we have to be on our
[1:41:07] guard brothers and sisters the devil is
[1:41:10] going about as a roaring
[1:41:12] lion not long ago a man said to me that
[1:41:16] the Roman Catholic church had to be the
[1:41:17] true church as it had been true to what
[1:41:20] it believed over all the years and kept
[1:41:23] growing and not
[1:41:26] changing I can't help but think it can
[1:41:28] be real easy for us as message Believers
[1:41:30] to do the same thing it's the way we've
[1:41:32] done it all these years and everything
[1:41:33] is fine God blesses me I've got a good
[1:41:35] job I got a good career we got a good
[1:41:37] family we're healthy everything is fine
[1:41:40] is it if it's not in line with the word
[1:41:43] brothers and sisters we need to get in
[1:41:44] line with the
[1:41:46] word it's not just the Catholic
[1:41:49] Church brother br says that isn't so at
[1:41:52] all any church with the government
[1:41:53] behind it and with its own Creed which
[1:41:56] isn't the word at all and with no
[1:41:59] manifested Ministry to cause the devil
[1:42:02] to get aroused could surely carry on
[1:42:05] that was not a
[1:42:08] Criterion maybe I should call them
[1:42:10] musicians but when you think of that
[1:42:13] little group whose members were saw
[1:42:15] aunder fed to Lions persecuted and
[1:42:19] driven from excuse me Pillar To Post and
[1:42:23] yet stayed true to the word now
[1:42:26] definitely that would have to be
[1:42:28] God how they survived their Battle of
[1:42:31] faith and carried on
[1:42:34] still that is a
[1:42:39] miracle and yet sometimes people can
[1:42:42] maybe have someone say something to them
[1:42:44] and they'll get upset and leave
[1:42:47] church what are we going to say when we
[1:42:49] get to meet those voices
[1:42:51] of our brothers and sisters on the other
[1:42:56] side and this Comfort is not for the
[1:42:59] seven Church AG Messengers only brothers
