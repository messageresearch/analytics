[31:40] loving Master
[31:42] as we call upon the Lord

[31:50] we just want to shut ourselves in so
[31:54] that you can commune with us father
[31:57] Lord Jesus
[31:58] [Music]
[31:59] we just want to say thank you Father
[32:03] for we are a privileged people
[32:07] in the midst of all the confusions
[32:11] father Lord Jesus you have revealed unto
[32:13] us the mysteries of your will
[32:17] we are privileged people because you
[32:19] have opened our eyes of understanding
[32:22] where we can go right into your mind
[32:26] and know what you had before the
[32:29] foundation of the world and even what
[32:32] your will is because we know who you are
[32:35] now Lord Jesus we come as your children
[32:39] and Heavenly Father

[53:37] just have a little bit of a different
[53:40] format tonight I met a man named Kashi
[53:46] a little while ago
[53:48] do a little bit of a business
[53:49] transaction and uh
[53:52] my friend told me that he has a bit of
[53:55] an issue and that problem is he has a 14
[53:58] year old son with autism with severe
[54:01] autism
[54:03] our friend
[54:04] is a believer
[54:07] and I don't know if he's been introduced
[54:10] to the message of the hour
[54:12] but through our interactions
[54:14] I think he was able to see something
[54:18] and so he called me and asked me
[54:20] if we would pray for his son tonight
[54:24] and uh
[54:25] I said to him absolutely we would
[54:30] sounds to me like his son is 14 years
[54:33] old his name is Isaiah
[54:37] and they've had autism in their home
[54:39] with their son for 13 years
[54:45] it's a severe sickness
[54:48] it's an illness and we know brother
[54:51] Branham called it a devil
[54:54] because she and I have had that
[54:56] discussion and he believes it as well
[54:59] but what I found surprising even was
[55:02] that he said to me he hasn't found
[55:03] anybody willing to pray for his son
[55:06] prayer of faith so I said tonight we
[55:09] will gather together we'll call the
[55:11] Elders we'll anoint the boy with oil
[55:14] and we'll invite the god
[55:18] the god that we worship to come on the
[55:21] scene
[55:22] and Touch This Boy's Life In The Name of
[55:24] Jesus Christ
[55:26] because we know we have been given
[55:28] healing for this side of Eternity it's
[55:30] not for another side we're going to have
[55:33] theophany bodies there he gave us
[55:35] healing for this time he took 39 stripes
[55:38] for us here
[55:40] so we can be healed in our bodies
[55:43] so I want to invite them to come forward
[55:46] with Isaiah brother Kashi
[55:48] you're welcome brother certainly an
[55:51] honor to have you here your wife
[55:54] and I'd like to invite everyone to pray
[55:56] with us tonight
[55:57] I'd like everyone to not take this
[55:59] lightly
[56:01] like everyone to close your eyes when we
[56:03] pray
[56:04] we know brother Branham said it very
[56:05] clearly that when devils are cast out
[56:08] they look for a place to go
[56:11] this isn't a joke we know that we're not
[56:14] we're not trying to show for anyone
[56:17] we've got a family with a son that
[56:20] hasn't been able to sleep properly for
[56:22] 14 years
[56:24] we want to see Deliverance in the name
[56:26] of Jesus Christ and more than anything
[56:28] that they would be able to be living
[56:30] Witnesses of this message of the hour

[56:36] their way

[1:09:46] let's open our Bibles to Second Peter 1
[1:09:50] 19. to 21.
[1:09:53] and
[1:09:55] I have a little bit of a subject here I
[1:09:57] know I might have preach it somewhere
[1:09:59] but
[1:10:00] I believe it's just timely that uh
[1:10:04] we have all these needs and
[1:10:07] we need to be directed properly
[1:10:09] amen and we know the word of God is the
[1:10:13] absolute
[1:10:14] and
[1:10:16] that means
[1:10:18] is the final the final of all things
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:22] so
[1:10:26] let's read second Peter 1 19 to 21 and
[1:10:29] I'll let you
[1:10:30] have your seats after
[1:10:33] verse 19 second Peter verse 1 we have
[1:10:38] or chapter 1 verse 19 to 21 we have also
[1:10:41] a more sure word of Prophecy
[1:10:44] where antu ye do well the eat a kid as
[1:10:49] and to a light that shine it in a dark
[1:10:53] place
[1:10:54] until the day Dawn and the day star
[1:10:56] arise in your hearts
[1:10:58] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[1:11:02] the scripture is of any private
[1:11:04] interpretation
[1:11:06] amen for the prophecy came not in all
[1:11:08] time by the will of man but holy men of
[1:11:11] God spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost let us bow in prayer
[1:11:16] oh Lord Jesus
[1:11:18] we just want you Lord to
[1:11:20] Lord to be in this service oh Lord from
[1:11:24] the beginning to the end of God as we
[1:11:26] surrender ourselves and to especially
[1:11:28] myself Lord I want you to speak through
[1:11:30] me Lord I will just reflect what your
[1:11:33] word say what your message say Lord not
[1:11:36] by my own interpretation because I
[1:11:39] cannot interpret your word online it
[1:11:41] only can come through prophets as you
[1:11:44] have declared it oh Lord Jesus we just
[1:11:47] want to surrender our Will O Lord we
[1:11:50] know we're needy we know it's timely we
[1:11:53] know it's a
[1:11:54] it's the end time we believe all the
[1:11:57] signs are before us they are manifesting
[1:12:00] every side every corner of this world
[1:12:03] because it is prophesied in your word
[1:12:06] therefore we just have to check what
[1:12:08] time we are living in and we know that
[1:12:11] we're living at the end time that's why
[1:12:13] we have to be prepared as the bride that
[1:12:16] made herself ready the bride being a
[1:12:19] newly wedded wife Lord we want to go to
[1:12:24] the rapture we want to go in glory With
[1:12:27] You O Lord Jesus Through the preaching
[1:12:29] and teaching of your word oh Lord may as
[1:12:32] we break your bread Lord may your word
[1:12:36] manifest and be understood and that we
[1:12:40] will understand it by with all of our
[1:12:42] hearts oh Lord Jesus through the through
[1:12:44] the preaching and teaching of your word
[1:12:46] may you be in the service from the
[1:12:48] beginning to the end all this we asked
[1:12:50] the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:53] you may be seated
[1:12:56] so we don't have much time but I'll try
[1:13:00] if we can finish I have 46 slides but
[1:13:03] maybe we always
[1:13:05] remind uh the the congregation basically
[1:13:10] when we preach because we are people of
[1:13:13] we we typically we're forgetful you can
[1:13:17] say we are always we need to be reminded
[1:13:20] always amen so no one can say that he
[1:13:24] he remembers everything and we cannot
[1:13:27] preach anything new here amen because
[1:13:29] praise the lord we were given the word
[1:13:31] we were given the message which will
[1:13:34] point us to the word amen and we're just
[1:13:37] waiting for some of the manifestations
[1:13:39] but most of them are already manifested
[1:13:41] they already revealed in US revealed
[1:13:44] through the preaching of the word
[1:13:47] through through the prophet of this age
[1:13:49] where only there are things there are
[1:13:52] that will come in the future but then
[1:13:55] it's good for us so that we can we know
[1:13:57] what will happen in the future he's the
[1:14:00] Alpha and Omega and the in between
[1:14:02] it doesn't say anything but it is said
[1:14:05] it's also him but where is he he now
[1:14:07] it's in you and me amen so that's why
[1:14:10] the word is the absolute the title of it
[1:14:13] is uh it's a strong word absolute is a
[1:14:17] strong word
[1:14:18] amen the word of God or you can say the
[1:14:20] Bible is the absolute and that's the
[1:14:23] message that we believe
[1:14:25] that it's about the word of God it's not
[1:14:28] of any private interpretation let's see
[1:14:31] let's break on this one we have also a
[1:14:35] more sure word of Prophecy it's not only
[1:14:38] your brothers and sister it's more sure
[1:14:41] it means it's it will happen
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:46] and we if we do take him
[1:14:49] it's just like unto a light that shineth
[1:14:52] in a dark place we know that light and
[1:14:54] darkness cannot coexist
[1:14:56] darkness is there but put a light on on
[1:14:59] that Darkness if for example in a room
[1:15:02] when you put a light what will happen to
[1:15:03] that Darkness it will just go away they
[1:15:05] cannot coexist amen and we are the light
[1:15:08] of this world amen
[1:15:11] brothers and you can see here knowing
[1:15:14] this first that no Prophecy of the
[1:15:18] scripture
[1:15:19] is of any private interpretation we
[1:15:23] cannot interpret it brothers and sisters
[1:15:25] that's why we need the prophet to
[1:15:27] interpret it because why the word comes
[1:15:30] through prophets only
[1:15:32] right for the prophecy came not in all
[1:15:35] time by the will of man
[1:15:37] but holy men of God spake as they were
[1:15:40] moved by whom the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:43] who is the Holy Ghost
[1:15:45] amen but it's the dynamic that will
[1:15:49] point to the mechanics mechanics is the
[1:15:51] word but dynamic mean this is the spark
[1:15:53] that will make the the car run
[1:15:56] you have a Mercedes so you have a a very
[1:15:59] high class so okay uh
[1:16:03] I saw this morning or this afternoon
[1:16:06] going home it's very good but then that
[1:16:09] one is just
[1:16:10] uh you know it's just a just a mechanics
[1:16:14] without the spark right
[1:16:17] it will not work at all you even though
[1:16:21] it has gasoline it has all the good uh
[1:16:24] uh good engine right everything is there
[1:16:28] but without that spark it will not run
[1:16:31] right so we need that spark we we don't
[1:16:33] we don't only need the word we need also
[1:16:36] the spark which is the Dynamics which is
[1:16:38] the holy spirit amen
[1:16:40] so
[1:16:42] just a
[1:16:43] H this is very familiar we always put
[1:16:46] this because this is a teaching and
[1:16:47] preaching
[1:16:48] Bible teaching
[1:16:50] it's treacherous
[1:16:52] because you're like walking on thin ice
[1:16:55] we call it
[1:16:57] at this point at this time it might be
[1:16:59] good to to bring the church to what I
[1:17:01] think to a complete understanding
[1:17:04] positionally of what we are in Christ
[1:17:06] Jesus we beat our pastor has been
[1:17:09] preaching on the positions of each and
[1:17:11] everyone right everyone uh
[1:17:14] everyone is a child for sure you can be
[1:17:17] a husband you can be a wife you can be a
[1:17:20] son and a daughter but everyone is a son
[1:17:22] and a daughter amen if you are of course
[1:17:25] we have a we have the same father you
[1:17:28] can say right which is the Jesus Christ
[1:17:31] himself but then the thing is uh
[1:17:34] teaching itself Bible teaching it will
[1:17:37] positionally place us amen of what we
[1:17:41] are in Christ Jesus
[1:17:44] knowing who we are knowing what we are
[1:17:47] and not to preempt or or or to be ahead
[1:17:51] it's always we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:54] Christ
[1:17:55] and what's the bread of Jesus Christ he
[1:17:57] will be married
[1:17:59] to us right because he's the bridegroom
[1:18:01] and we are the bride and we will be
[1:18:03] going to the marriage supper not to the
[1:18:05] wedding
[1:18:06] right because the relationship between a
[1:18:09] husband and a wife is about marriage and
[1:18:11] it started here we're having Union right
[1:18:14] now when we go there
[1:18:15] right in the in the marriage supper not
[1:18:18] the wedding the wedding is happening
[1:18:20] right now right okay we continue now
[1:18:24] preaching usually catches The Sinner
[1:18:26] brings him under condemnation by the
[1:18:28] word but teaching places the man
[1:18:31] positionally what he is
[1:18:34] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:18:37] faith until positionally we know what we
[1:18:40] are you see positioning is so important
[1:18:42] even the the visions of Royal Branham
[1:18:46] until every place is in order then he
[1:18:48] cannot say you are healed or that will
[1:18:50] happen he needs to check all the details
[1:18:53] amen so it's the same for us every place
[1:18:56] must be in order before the word of God
[1:19:00] can can manifest amen and and you can
[1:19:04] see here
[1:19:06] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:19:09] faith faith cannot even come until
[1:19:12] you're positionally knowing who you are
[1:19:15] and what you are amen so there will be a
[1:19:18] series of uh things that we will discuss
[1:19:21] here
[1:19:22] absolute the word of God is the absolute
[1:19:24] what
[1:19:25] does um where your uh merriam-web's
[1:19:28] Webster dictionary say about the meaning
[1:19:30] of absolute when it when it comes to
[1:19:33] powers or rights
[1:19:35] it's not subject to any limitation
[1:19:38] so it's Unlimited
[1:19:39] right absolute means unlimited it's
[1:19:42] unconditional we know the love of God is
[1:19:45] unconditional
[1:19:46] right our election is unconditional he
[1:19:48] elected us before the foundation that's
[1:19:50] it amen we don't need to question it
[1:19:53] amen when it comes to a ruler
[1:19:57] when you this when we say the the king
[1:20:00] uh for example in the Kingdom he has
[1:20:05] unrestricted power
[1:20:06] his word is the absolute the king's word
[1:20:09] is the absolute because it's the ruler
[1:20:11] of of that Nation or or Kingdom amen
[1:20:14] when it comes to the law
[1:20:17] it is final
[1:20:19] so if you if you have a case in the
[1:20:22] lower court
[1:20:24] right you can go to the Supreme Court to
[1:20:27] to to get an appeal or or but once once
[1:20:31] that uh case is already settled and
[1:20:34] there's a verdict on the Supreme Court
[1:20:36] then no one can uh can overrule that uh
[1:20:39] that verdict except the Supreme Court
[1:20:42] itself amen so when it comes to God it's
[1:20:46] the Ultimate Reality absolute means
[1:20:49] Ultimate Reality which is God Amen the
[1:20:52] other other uh meanings or definitions
[1:20:56] absolute means perfect
[1:20:59] it's pure positive unquestionable it's
[1:21:03] fundamental it's ultimate it's complete
[1:21:05] I'm so happy listening to the song
[1:21:07] service complete we are completing him
[1:21:09] it's a Finnish work amen because the
[1:21:12] word of God is the absolute it's a
[1:21:14] Finnish work it's a Plan of Redemption
[1:21:16] that is already done we're just playing
[1:21:18] our part it's a it's a drama amen so
[1:21:23] when it comes to the Perfection if the
[1:21:26] word of God is perfect if God is perfect
[1:21:28] then if we worship Him are we adding
[1:21:31] something to him
[1:21:33] it is already perfect
[1:21:36] no you cannot add anything to him
[1:21:38] because it's already perfect
[1:21:40] but he requires our worship we know that
[1:21:43] because he's happy but is that actually
[1:21:45] for him or for us when we worship
[1:21:49] we have to think about that because he
[1:21:50] is already perfect
[1:21:52] right are we adding something to him are
[1:21:55] we adding stature to God because we
[1:21:58] worship him because we serve in this
[1:22:01] church we are musicians we are ministers
[1:22:04] we are uh everything right anything that
[1:22:07] whatever position we have
[1:22:09] we're not adding anything to God but
[1:22:11] actually we're adding to ourselves
[1:22:13] because we need perfection
[1:22:15] amen we are the one that needs
[1:22:17] Perfection it's not God because he is
[1:22:19] already perfect from the beginning
[1:22:21] amen so
[1:22:24] facts about the Bible because we're
[1:22:26] we're talking about the Bible here
[1:22:28] that's why it's better to know the facts
[1:22:30] of the Bible so the Holy Bible is a
[1:22:32] collection of 66 books amen Sunday
[1:22:35] school right and it is composed of 39
[1:22:38] books in the Old Testament
[1:22:40] 27 books in the New Testament and it's
[1:22:43] written by 40 different authors
[1:22:46] and it's ridden over a period of about
[1:22:49] 2000 years
[1:22:50] So Pro Branham is saying from Genesis to
[1:22:53] to island of Patmos Moses to uh to to
[1:22:57] John it's about 1600 years right about
[1:23:00] 2000 years and it tells us about the
[1:23:03] past present and future that's why he's
[1:23:05] the Alpha and the Omega and we are in
[1:23:07] the in between
[1:23:08] right because we're the one uh
[1:23:10] continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:23:12] here on Earth because he already left
[1:23:14] the sin and even the prophet of God
[1:23:16] already left the sin so where is the
[1:23:18] word right now
[1:23:19] amen amen it's in you and me my brothers
[1:23:22] and sisters that's why the word is the
[1:23:24] absolute and we are taught very well we
[1:23:26] are instructed that we have to go back
[1:23:29] to the word go back to the absolute
[1:23:31] which is the word
[1:23:32] amen because the scripture is also
[1:23:36] saying if you have something to to think
[1:23:39] about search the scriptures that's a
[1:23:42] commandment to us this is the Lord Jesus
[1:23:45] Christ saying that's why I put it in red
[1:23:47] right the red letter search the
[1:23:50] scriptures foreign
[1:23:54] and they are they with testify of me so
[1:23:56] what is the scripture then it's a it's a
[1:23:59] testimony of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:24:01] revelation of Jesus Christ amen even in
[1:24:04] second Timothy 3 16 17
[1:24:06] all scripture he didn't say some
[1:24:09] scripture right it's all amen it's given
[1:24:13] by inspiration of God and it's what is
[1:24:16] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[1:24:20] correction for instruction in
[1:24:22] righteousness so when we are corrected
[1:24:25] from the pulpit according to the word of
[1:24:27] God don't don't be offended
[1:24:30] right because that is the word of God
[1:24:33] and if you are not corrected it's just
[1:24:36] like you're a bastard child the
[1:24:39] scripture is saying right we need he
[1:24:42] spare the rad spoil the child we need
[1:24:45] and and even in I think it's Psalms 23
[1:24:48] thy stuff is my comfort
[1:24:50] or direct is my comfort it means uh we
[1:24:54] can spare the rod right
[1:24:56] so it's good for us it's for correction
[1:25:00] that the man of God
[1:25:02] who's that you and me may be perfect
[1:25:04] totally
[1:25:06] Perfection amen totally furnished and to
[1:25:09] all good work so it means by the
[1:25:10] preaching of the word we will be made
[1:25:12] perfect
[1:25:13] amen so we're so thankful on that
[1:25:16] because we are practicing here Burberry
[1:25:19] is giving everyone who has the gift to
[1:25:22] to uh to preach because we need the
[1:25:25] fivefold ministry
[1:25:27] to be perfected
[1:25:29] Ephesians 4 11 it's very important you
[1:25:32] cannot be perfected by one man and not
[1:25:34] even even the five men you cannot be
[1:25:36] perfected because all those five men
[1:25:38] needs to preach the full word of God
[1:25:41] amen individually amen with different uh
[1:25:44] administrations of gifts amen
[1:25:47] and it's so important that uh we we we
[1:25:50] would know that having a nerd shall pass
[1:25:53] away but my word shall not pass away
[1:25:56] Matthew 24 35. so I think brother uh
[1:26:00] brother Toby talked about this you
[1:26:02] cannot place your trust
[1:26:05] here even on Earth on Heaven even and
[1:26:09] Earth because this will all pass away
[1:26:12] so where will you place your your trust
[1:26:14] even in Eden it's not a safe place why
[1:26:18] because there is a serpent there
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:22] we thought that they are perfect in in
[1:26:25] the Garden of Eden right but then there
[1:26:28] is a serpent there that deceived the
[1:26:32] deceived Eve but you know brothers and
[1:26:34] sisters
[1:26:35] the the Commandment of God was given to
[1:26:38] him I I have a second topic here which
[1:26:40] is the original sin I know brother bear
[1:26:43] is always saying okay we will talk about
[1:26:45] that but then the thing is I I have some
[1:26:48] preparation already there and I preach
[1:26:50] it in let's Bridge so it's the second
[1:26:51] part of this this is just the foundation
[1:26:54] uh of what I wanted to preach but uh
[1:26:57] it's just to to place us properly if we
[1:27:01] know that the word is the absolute then
[1:27:04] we know
[1:27:05] what is the original sin you cannot just
[1:27:07] preach the the uh the word or the Bible
[1:27:10] being the absolute without knowing the
[1:27:12] original sin amen but anyway
[1:27:15] so where will you put your trust Heaven
[1:27:17] and Earth shall pass away but my word
[1:27:20] shall not pass away so we have to make
[1:27:23] sure that we are in line with the word
[1:27:25] everything that we do
[1:27:27] amen even though we think even or our
[1:27:29] motives and objectives are very good if
[1:27:32] they are not in line with the word then
[1:27:34] we are doing things in vain
[1:27:37] amen Matthew 4 4.
[1:27:40] but he answered and said it is written
[1:27:43] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:27:46] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:27:47] mouth of God this Matthew 4 is the
[1:27:50] temptation of Jesus Christ with the last
[1:27:52] of the flesh last of the eye spread of
[1:27:54] life right so you can see here the first
[1:27:57] temptation is uh because after 40 days
[1:28:00] of fasting
[1:28:02] is is hungry so what's the first
[1:28:05] temptation
[1:28:08] if you uh
[1:28:10] he said if uh it is written Manchester
[1:28:13] vibrate alone but actually the the the
[1:28:17] Temptation is turn these stones to bread
[1:28:20] because he's very hungry right but then
[1:28:23] he said it is written man shall not live
[1:28:25] by bread alone but what by every word
[1:28:29] not some word but by every word that
[1:28:32] proceeded out of the mouth of God Amen
[1:28:35] and uh I'll I'll hurry Hebrew Hebrews 1
[1:28:39] 1 God who at some three times and in
[1:28:42] diverse manners speak in time past unto
[1:28:45] the fathers by the prophets so you can
[1:28:48] see there is a pattern God speaks to or
[1:28:52] spoke to prophets and even is doing now
[1:28:55] because the thing is for us we might not
[1:28:57] be Major Prophets but we if we have
[1:28:59] dusted the Lord which is according to
[1:29:01] the word then you're talking about the
[1:29:03] word of God then you have that prophetic
[1:29:06] Ministry you might not be God but the
[1:29:08] word of God is in you amen because you
[1:29:10] are just repeating you are just
[1:29:12] reflecting what the word of God is
[1:29:14] saying amen so that's why
[1:29:17] in times past unto the fathers by the
[1:29:20] prophets amen and that's a very
[1:29:23] important one and in Galatians 1 8-12
[1:29:27] it's Paul speaking here but though we
[1:29:30] are an angel from heaven preach any
[1:29:32] other gospel unto you than that which we
[1:29:34] have preached unto you let him be
[1:29:35] accursed
[1:29:36] so you can see here
[1:29:39] but though we we he's saying including
[1:29:41] him
[1:29:42] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:29:46] gospel so he cannot even preach any
[1:29:48] other gospel that he already preached
[1:29:51] so that's why even the message of the
[1:29:53] hour if it's already preach and it's in
[1:29:54] line with the word you cannot change
[1:29:55] that
[1:29:57] right even an angel from heaven
[1:30:00] he will be accursed
[1:30:02] we have to be careful that's why
[1:30:04] handling of the word of God is very
[1:30:07] important that's why you can see when
[1:30:09] when the sword of the King was given to
[1:30:12] Branham in uh in uh Sabino Canyon that's
[1:30:16] the time he was able to handle the word
[1:30:18] he's ready right at that time that's why
[1:30:20] he was given the sword the sword of the
[1:30:22] king what is the two-edged sword it's
[1:30:24] the word
[1:30:25] amen now it can be handled by man
[1:30:28] right handled means he can reflect it he
[1:30:31] can preach it 100
[1:30:34] no hips no ends no buts it's only the
[1:30:38] word of God Amen that's why the prophet
[1:30:41] of this age brother Branham we know that
[1:30:43] he preached the word and his messages go
[1:30:46] back to the word go back to the full
[1:30:49] word amen not some Theologian uh uh some
[1:30:54] theology amen because theology is the
[1:30:56] one that's the reason why we have a lot
[1:30:58] of denominations
[1:31:00] one but I can already preached a
[1:31:03] denomination can be a denomination of
[1:31:05] yourself
[1:31:06] because it's not according to your to
[1:31:08] the word of God Amen
[1:31:11] verse 9 as we said before
[1:31:14] so say I now again he repeated you see
[1:31:18] verse 9 here
[1:31:20] just to warn us right if any man preach
[1:31:23] any other gospel unto you then ye have
[1:31:26] received let him be accursed it means
[1:31:29] it's so important that we we are
[1:31:31] grounded we are rooted with the word for
[1:31:34] do I now persuade man or God
[1:31:37] this is Paul speaking or do I seek to
[1:31:39] please man or if yet please make if I
[1:31:42] yet please man I should not be the
[1:31:44] servant of Christ
[1:31:45] he needs to please Christ we need to
[1:31:49] please Christ amen but I certify you
[1:31:52] Brethren that the gospel which was
[1:31:54] preached of me is not after man for I
[1:31:57] neither recipient of man neither was I
[1:32:00] taught it but by the revelation of Jesus
[1:32:03] Christ it's so important we cannot over
[1:32:05] emphasize the importance of Revelation
[1:32:07] Brian Branham is saying there are two
[1:32:08] things that you cannot over emphasize
[1:32:09] you you cannot overdo prayer
[1:32:12] right prayer is a must we have to do it
[1:32:15] it changes things and you cannot over
[1:32:17] emphasize the importance of Revelation
[1:32:19] Revelation means unfolding it's
[1:32:22] revealing it's uh removing all the all
[1:32:26] the uncertainties amen when it when the
[1:32:28] word of God is revealed to us then
[1:32:30] there's no more issue I think I I don't
[1:32:33] know if I appreciate it
[1:32:35] about Revelation right I think Brian can
[1:32:38] also preach it he put something and then
[1:32:40] he covered it then he asked us what is
[1:32:42] it of course you can guess but until it
[1:32:45] is removed unveiled you would not know
[1:32:47] what it is
[1:32:48] and if it is unveiled little by little
[1:32:51] you will know oh it might be for example
[1:32:52] if if I will put it in my pocket okay
[1:32:54] what what's in my pocket you'll say oh
[1:32:56] it's a it it's in the wall it's in your
[1:32:59] wall it's in your pocket maybe it's a
[1:33:01] wallet but then when I remove it oh
[1:33:04] partially I will say oh it's a cell
[1:33:06] phone but would you know what the model
[1:33:08] and make it is no until I remove it
[1:33:10] until you scrutinize it so it's the same
[1:33:12] as the word until until it's totally
[1:33:14] unveiled and revealed and you have
[1:33:17] you can touch it and I can touch it by
[1:33:19] by you and me amen that all the fruits
[1:33:23] all the uh all the manifestations of the
[1:33:26] word of God although we're not yet
[1:33:28] perfect but we will reach that
[1:33:30] Perfection amen and we can handle it
[1:33:32] amen and that's the full revelation of
[1:33:35] Jesus Christ amen
[1:33:36] Hebrews 39
[1:33:39] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:33:40] forever very familiar scripture
[1:33:42] right that's because he cannot change
[1:33:44] God cannot change his ultimate is
[1:33:47] already perfect so he cannot uh he
[1:33:50] cannot give certain things and then he
[1:33:52] will change again right it's uh it's
[1:33:55] infinite he's absolute amen and John 1 1
[1:33:59] and 14 in the beginning was the word and
[1:34:01] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:34:03] God and he became flesh and dual Among
[1:34:05] Us very popular scripture that the word
[1:34:09] is God that's why he is the absolute
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:16] Matthew 11 25. at that time Jesus
[1:34:19] answered and said I thank thee O Lord O
[1:34:22] Father O Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:34:24] because thou has hid these things from
[1:34:26] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[1:34:28] unto babes
[1:34:29] if we are babes then we want to learn
[1:34:33] right if we are already uh puffed up and
[1:34:37] we already made up our mind then we put
[1:34:40] a period on things we should not put
[1:34:42] anything with the period we should it's
[1:34:45] it's continuous unfolding
[1:34:47] but the the full revelation we know that
[1:34:50] is already in the message of the hour
[1:34:51] even brother Branham has a for the
[1:34:53] Revelation further unfolding but for us
[1:34:55] we are we have the the progressive
[1:34:58] revelation on the message of the hour
[1:35:01] right we cannot go beyond the revelation
[1:35:03] of the message of the hour because the
[1:35:05] message of the hour is Christ in us the
[1:35:07] hope of glory that's the completeness
[1:35:09] the perfect the Perfection which we need
[1:35:11] for the Rapture amen our progressive
[1:35:14] revelation lies in when we study the
[1:35:18] message of the hour and we found oh
[1:35:19] brother Branham said it's at a later
[1:35:22] stage amen although before the seals and
[1:35:25] after the seals and everything is is a
[1:35:27] complete Revelation First full second
[1:35:29] pull third pull everything is a complete
[1:35:31] thing that's why when we're studying the
[1:35:33] message we should see the whole picture
[1:35:35] amen not not
[1:35:37] take one coat and run away with it right
[1:35:40] right no right it's the same as
[1:35:42] scripture every scripture must the other
[1:35:44] scripture amen every judge every detail
[1:35:47] must come to pass
[1:35:49] if it's not for us it will still come to
[1:35:51] pass but we will see it like like like
[1:35:53] when uh when this message is already
[1:35:56] gone or the gospel is already gone then
[1:35:57] it will go to the Jews but we are
[1:35:59] already out in glory but that will still
[1:36:01] be fulfilled amen but it's not for us
[1:36:03] it's for them but but for us we see what
[1:36:06] will happen in the future
[1:36:07] amen so you can see here
[1:36:11] Psalms 132 it's a very important
[1:36:13] scripture here because the thing is
[1:36:15] every time we pray we pray in Jesus name
[1:36:19] but then
[1:36:20] positioning let's let's start with
[1:36:22] positioning I will worship toward the
[1:36:25] Holy Temple
[1:36:26] and praise
[1:36:28] thy name
[1:36:30] for thy loving kindness
[1:36:32] and for thy Truth for thou has magnified
[1:36:36] Thy word above all thy name
[1:36:39] so which is higher the word or the name
[1:36:42] right so because the word is the
[1:36:44] absolute if we we think about the dire
[1:36:47] house magnified your word above all your
[1:36:51] name
[1:36:51] so it means even though we pray there's
[1:36:54] no salvation other than Jesus name we
[1:36:56] know that but then the thing is Jesus is
[1:36:58] the word right and the name of our God
[1:37:02] is the Lord Jesus Christ complete and
[1:37:04] he's the word amen that's why all these
[1:37:07] scriptures are very important to put
[1:37:09] them together so that we will understand
[1:37:11] and will be positionally placed amen
[1:37:14] amen amen the next one is uh it's a
[1:37:16] warning it's almost the it's the last
[1:37:20] chapter of Revelation and it says for I
[1:37:23] testify unto every man that hear it the
[1:37:25] words of the prophecy of this book If
[1:37:27] any man shall add unto these things God
[1:37:30] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[1:37:32] written in the book so you cannot add
[1:37:35] and then the next one is you can take
[1:37:38] away from the words of the book of this
[1:37:40] prophecy otherwise God shall take away
[1:37:42] his part out of the book of life and out
[1:37:45] of the holy city and from the things
[1:37:47] which are written in this book so you
[1:37:49] see it's a warning
[1:37:51] before it ended right so you shall not
[1:37:54] ever add or take away any word that is
[1:37:57] written here
[1:37:58] right because it's absolute you cannot
[1:38:01] take away you cannot add amen
[1:38:05] first Peter
[1:38:07] 1 23 being born again not of corruptable
[1:38:11] sin but of incorruptible
[1:38:15] how can that be by the word of God which
[1:38:18] leave it and abideth forever amen
[1:38:22] and if we check the Amos 6 Amos 367
[1:38:25] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[1:38:28] the people be not afraid
[1:38:30] shall there be evil in a city and the
[1:38:33] Lord had not done it
[1:38:35] then this is the one surely the Lord God
[1:38:38] will do nothing but he revealed his
[1:38:40] secret unto his servants the prophets so
[1:38:42] there is always a warning in the time of
[1:38:45] Noah one twenty years he preached he's
[1:38:47] building the ark he's warning warning
[1:38:49] them repent with your sin and then go
[1:38:52] into the ark but no one
[1:38:54] no one listen except his family amen
[1:38:57] there is always a warning but then after
[1:38:59] that there is a judgment there was a
[1:39:01] flood so there is a pattern there's
[1:39:04] always a warning and then there will be
[1:39:06] a judgment amen and in Malachi 456 we we
[1:39:10] were told that Elijah the prophet
[1:39:13] will be sent again before the coming of
[1:39:16] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:39:19] for what to turn the heart of the
[1:39:21] children to their fathers that's our
[1:39:24] scope that's our portion amen because he
[1:39:27] did about this already did the first
[1:39:29] part which is the heart turning the
[1:39:31] heart of the fathers to the children
[1:39:33] that's John the Baptist but brother
[1:39:35] Branham he turned the heart of the
[1:39:37] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:39:39] and smite the Earth with a curse amen
[1:39:41] so
[1:39:43] that's God
[1:39:45] change his mind
[1:39:48] so uh paragraph 178 here caused the word
[1:39:52] of the Lord comes to prophets only
[1:39:54] never to theologians
[1:39:57] it is to prophets amen and the Lord said
[1:40:01] he did nothing in this unchanging world
[1:40:03] we just talked about until first he
[1:40:06] shows His prophets
[1:40:08] and the end time and and the end time
[1:40:10] them Seven Seals that the Bible has
[1:40:12] sealed up the Sevenfold mysteries of all
[1:40:14] Christ
[1:40:15] has to be rebuilt first and it can only
[1:40:18] be brought to a prophet
[1:40:21] we've been looking for that for years
[1:40:22] and we believe that his spirit is Among
[1:40:24] Us now amen
[1:40:26] are we happy brothers and sisters that
[1:40:29] uh
[1:40:30] we have received such a message it's not
[1:40:33] by our own uh intellect or by our by our
[1:40:36] righteousness no it's by selection amen
[1:40:39] never in this world that I would know
[1:40:42] that uh I will be elected because I'm
[1:40:44] just a sinner saved by his grace amen
[1:40:46] who can say that oh I'm righteous I'm
[1:40:48] I'm born in the message that's why I I'm
[1:40:50] like this no one everyone needs
[1:40:53] experience amen
[1:40:54] so that's why what I what I've said is
[1:40:56] uh
[1:40:57] uh I this this topic are always they
[1:41:02] always go hand in hand because the thing
[1:41:04] is we know the original sin right the
[1:41:07] original sin is unbelief in the word of
[1:41:09] God but then the thing is unbelief in
[1:41:11] the word of God so it means uh Salvation
[1:41:14] is belief in the word of God right but
[1:41:18] if you're not believing the word of God
[1:41:19] then you're committing a sin but then
[1:41:22] the thing is let's let's tackle together
[1:41:25] I have only eight minutes or maybe I
[1:41:27] don't know if we can extend a little bit
[1:41:29] 10 minutes just uh yeah there's so many
[1:41:33] good nuggets here that uh some has
[1:41:37] already seen this but most I think in
[1:41:40] Calgary they haven't that's why it's so
[1:41:42] good too
[1:41:43] to preach the original sin and to answer
[1:41:46] these five questions
[1:41:48] why do we need salvation
[1:41:51] right that's the first question
[1:41:53] what really happened in the Garden of
[1:41:55] Eden
[1:41:57] right so that what is the original sin
[1:42:01] how can we be saved why God required
[1:42:04] blood and why virgin birth
[1:42:06] why can't we be saved by Good Works
[1:42:08] let's answer this hopefully in 10 to 15
[1:42:12] minutes we can answer them there's a lot
[1:42:16] why do we need salvation
[1:42:18] because the scripture say says or said
[1:42:22] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:42:24] the glory of God
[1:42:26] why because
[1:42:28] we were shapen in iniquity
[1:42:30] and in sin did my mother conceived me
[1:42:35] and in job 41 man that is born of a
[1:42:38] woman is so few days and full of trouble
[1:42:40] so you can see here because we were
[1:42:43] conceived in sin because we were
[1:42:46] conceived out of lust we were not like
[1:42:49] Jesus Christ who was born of a virgin
[1:42:52] without any Union of a man and a woman
[1:42:55] amen so why do we need salvation then
[1:42:58] because the Bible tells us that from the
[1:43:02] time of our conception we all were born
[1:43:05] sinners amen
[1:43:07] I think we will agree on that amen what
[1:43:10] really happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:43:12] the setting here Genesis 2 8-9
[1:43:16] if we will read it and I will explain it
[1:43:19] it's kind of interesting because when we
[1:43:21] just read it's just like a magazine then
[1:43:23] it needs to be revealed to us right and
[1:43:26] the Lord got Genesis 2 8 9. this is the
[1:43:29] setting in the in in the garden and the
[1:43:31] Lord God planted the garden Eastward in
[1:43:35] Eden and there he put the man whom he
[1:43:37] had formed
[1:43:38] and out of the ground
[1:43:41] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[1:43:43] that is Pleasant to the sight and good
[1:43:45] for food
[1:43:46] semicolon
[1:43:48] the tree of life also in the midst of
[1:43:52] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[1:43:54] good ideal if you're just reading this
[1:43:57] verse 9 how many trees do you see types
[1:44:00] of trees
[1:44:02] two three
[1:44:04] if typically they they see that they
[1:44:07] only see two trees but if you if you
[1:44:10] scrutinize it by teaching with
[1:44:13] Revelation the first one is every tree
[1:44:16] that is Pleasant to the site and good
[1:44:18] for food
[1:44:19] these are the natural trees
[1:44:21] that includes Apple
[1:44:23] apricot whatever fruit
[1:44:26] that that bear fruit
[1:44:29] but the second one you see the tree of
[1:44:31] life also in the midst of the garden and
[1:44:34] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:44:36] so so many are preaching there are only
[1:44:38] two trees but actually when you see that
[1:44:39] there are three trees three types of
[1:44:42] trees the natural
[1:44:44] right the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:44:46] Evil and
[1:44:48] uh three of life amen and you can see
[1:44:51] it's one garden guardian of Eden but
[1:44:54] out
[1:44:55] of that Garden there are all types of
[1:44:57] trees including apples apricots Etc
[1:45:00] that's the natural but the tree of
[1:45:02] knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree
[1:45:03] of life you can say they are spiritual
[1:45:05] trees
[1:45:07] amen so that's the setting so
[1:45:11] let's go further
[1:45:15] what are trees
[1:45:17] in numbers 24 5-6 how goodly are they
[1:45:21] then so Jacob and daita Bernanke also
[1:45:23] Israel as the valleys are they spread
[1:45:26] forth as Gardens by the Riverside as the
[1:45:29] Trees of line alos
[1:45:32] which the Lord had planted in a cedar
[1:45:35] trees beside the waters so you can see
[1:45:37] trees here they are symbolic of persons
[1:45:40] we are the fruits of our parents amen
[1:45:43] the union of our parents and the Tree of
[1:45:46] Life is the person of life which is
[1:45:48] Jesus Christ himself
[1:45:50] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:45:52] Evil is also a person too
[1:45:54] which is Satan which is symbolic of that
[1:45:57] right so three three types amen the the
[1:46:00] natural
[1:46:01] tree of life and three of knowledge of
[1:46:03] Good and Evil now the Commandment of God
[1:46:06] we're talking about original sin here so
[1:46:08] that at least we can nail it down what
[1:46:10] is really the original sin how come it
[1:46:14] it is uh explained by barbaranam that
[1:46:17] way and it's in the scripture he's a
[1:46:19] prophet therefore he gave us the how how
[1:46:22] to uh it's a mystery you can say that
[1:46:25] it's already revealed for us it's not
[1:46:26] mystery because we just accepted it
[1:46:29] because it's written in the Bible amen
[1:46:31] so Genesis 2 16-17 what is the this is
[1:46:34] the Commandment to man to Adam because
[1:46:37] you will see the sequence here if it's
[1:46:39] not yet there he she's still inside Adam
[1:46:43] okay so the Commandment was given to
[1:46:46] Adam
[1:46:47] and the Lord God commanded the man which
[1:46:49] is Adam right he has a masculine and
[1:46:53] feminine uh spirit right so he's both
[1:46:57] Adam Adam means Eve is inside saying of
[1:47:00] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[1:47:02] freely eat
[1:47:04] but of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:47:06] Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the
[1:47:09] day that thou eat is thereof thou shall
[1:47:11] surely they
[1:47:13] so the thing is
[1:47:15] in this natural setting here the
[1:47:17] Commandment was given to Adam
[1:47:20] so was there a fall
[1:47:23] when the Commandment was given
[1:47:26] there's no fall yet when did the Fall
[1:47:28] start when Eve was taken out
[1:47:31] of Adam so spiritually for us that's the
[1:47:34] reason why we need to be in one with
[1:47:36] Christ
[1:47:38] because when you're outside Christ then
[1:47:41] you can be deceived
[1:47:42] that's why the Oneness
[1:47:44] I my father are one very good preaching
[1:47:47] oh if you will tie it together so
[1:47:49] beautiful brothers and sisters if you
[1:47:51] are one with Christ
[1:47:53] you are part of him you are the word
[1:47:55] made flesh he's the word made flesh
[1:47:57] today it's what the scripture say that's
[1:48:00] also the bride we are one with him is
[1:48:02] one with us then if we are one how can
[1:48:04] we be deceived same for Eve he she
[1:48:08] cannot be deceived if she is inside Adam
[1:48:10] that's the reason why we have to be one
[1:48:13] with Christ that's that's what we are
[1:48:15] doing now we need to have a union
[1:48:17] right with Jesus Christ right now Christ
[1:48:20] in us the hope of glory what is Glory
[1:48:23] the hope of rapture
[1:48:25] right and I I want to to check the the
[1:48:28] meaning of Glory we've been talking me
[1:48:30] and my wife about about the meaning of
[1:48:32] Glory it says here uh
[1:48:36] bear with me here it's so beautiful that
[1:48:39] the
[1:48:40] that the
[1:48:42] it's so good to to meaning okay
[1:48:45] it's actually it's from Strong's g1391
[1:48:49] it's in Greek g1391 and the
[1:48:51] pronunciation is doxa that's the meaning
[1:48:54] of Glory you know the meaning of it the
[1:48:57] the definition in the fourth one it's a
[1:48:59] most glorious condition
[1:49:01] it's the most exalted state
[1:49:05] that with God the Father in heaven to
[1:49:08] which Christ was raised after he had
[1:49:12] achieved his work on Earth so after he
[1:49:14] achieved his work on Earth he went to
[1:49:16] Glory he's with the Lord God he's in a
[1:49:19] very exalted place for us
[1:49:22] the second definition here it's a
[1:49:25] glorious condition of blessedness in
[1:49:29] which is appointed and promised that
[1:49:31] true Christians shall enter after their
[1:49:35] saviors return from heaven so that's
[1:49:37] where we're going
[1:49:39] that's why the thing is when Christ is
[1:49:41] in us it is the hope of glory because
[1:49:45] the word is in us then all the hope is
[1:49:48] in there the hope of rapture because the
[1:49:50] Rapture is a person amen am in that
[1:49:53] person is in us then we we have the hope
[1:49:55] of glory is the hope it's not
[1:49:58] hope so but it will happen amen because
[1:50:01] it's already prophesied in the world
[1:50:03] because the word is absolute amen so
[1:50:05] that's why you can see we cannot go out
[1:50:08] of the word
[1:50:09] because uh if we go if if we go how the
[1:50:13] how the deception came
[1:50:16] the sir The Serpent and its deception is
[1:50:18] in Genesis 3 1-4
[1:50:20] in at this time Eve is already out of
[1:50:24] the of the body of Adam right he so she
[1:50:28] was given to Adam as a wife amen you can
[1:50:30] see that that is in Genesis 2 and in
[1:50:33] Genesis 3 that started the the deception
[1:50:36] amen now the serpent
[1:50:39] was more subtle than any beast of the
[1:50:42] field which the Lord God had made and he
[1:50:44] said unto the woman yay had God said ye
[1:50:47] shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:50:49] garden
[1:50:50] you see he's using the word but mixing
[1:50:53] it it is trying to twist it amen
[1:50:56] but the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:50:59] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[1:51:01] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:51:03] which is in the midst of the garden
[1:51:05] which is the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:51:07] and Evil you shall not eat of it neither
[1:51:09] shall ye touch it lest she die and the
[1:51:12] serpent said unto the woman you shall
[1:51:14] not surely die so you see here
[1:51:17] the the Commandment said You shall
[1:51:21] surely die
[1:51:24] you see here for in the day that thou it
[1:51:27] is their Hall thereof Thou shalt surely
[1:51:30] die that's the word right that's the
[1:51:31] Commandment but then the serpent said
[1:51:34] you shall not surely die so it's it's
[1:51:36] not even a sentence it's just one word
[1:51:39] off that's why it's so dangerous 99 99.9
[1:51:43] percent doubt
[1:51:45] or yeah doubt or unbelief
[1:51:48] and you have only 0.01 or you can say
[1:51:51] 99.9 truth and .01 doubt it will be an
[1:51:56] unbelief in total because it must be
[1:51:59] perfect the whole thing
[1:52:01] and this this is very powerful actually
[1:52:04] not is to make it negative right what
[1:52:08] whatever is the positive that's why it's
[1:52:10] a very powerful word but it's only one
[1:52:13] word it's not even a sentence and then
[1:52:16] this cause everything even sickness and
[1:52:18] everything amen
[1:52:19] so let's go eating of the fruit
[1:52:26] Genesis 3 5-7
[1:52:29] for God that know that in the day you
[1:52:32] eat thereof then your eye shall be
[1:52:34] opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing
[1:52:37] Good and Evil
[1:52:38] and when the woman saw
[1:52:41] this is the woman as a human being right
[1:52:43] because that's not how it is because
[1:52:46] she's looking at the natural but for us
[1:52:48] we are asked to look at the spiritual
[1:52:50] that's why she was deceived because
[1:52:52] she's out of Adam right she's not one
[1:52:55] with the word and when the woman saw
[1:52:57] that the tree was good for food and that
[1:53:00] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[1:53:02] to this to be decide to make one wise
[1:53:05] she took off the fruit thereof and did
[1:53:07] it and gave also unto her husband with
[1:53:10] her and he did it
[1:53:12] and the eyes of them both were opened
[1:53:15] and they knew that they were naked and
[1:53:17] they sued feed leaves together and made
[1:53:20] themselves aprons so what does nakedness
[1:53:24] has to do with eating of a fruit if it's
[1:53:26] really a natural fruit amen so let's
[1:53:29] explain further
[1:53:32] what and who was the serpent
[1:53:34] what what was the serpent and who was
[1:53:36] the serpent in Genesis 3 when he's more
[1:53:39] subtle than any Beast
[1:53:41] of the field which the Lord God had made
[1:53:44] and he said unto the woman yay had God
[1:53:46] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[1:53:48] the garden
[1:53:49] and then Revelations 12 9 it will tell
[1:53:52] us who this
[1:53:54] serpent is
[1:53:56] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[1:53:59] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[1:54:02] which deceive it the whole world he was
[1:54:04] cast out into the Earth and his angels
[1:54:07] were cast out of him so
[1:54:09] you can see who's this serpent he's the
[1:54:12] devil is Satan is the old serpent as per
[1:54:15] the scripture subtle
[1:54:17] means through
[1:54:20] crafty Sly and sensible but then the
[1:54:22] thing he is a beast
[1:54:25] this means what
[1:54:27] has legs
[1:54:28] and and the message is saying is it's
[1:54:30] upright so but then the thing is when
[1:54:33] when we check the
[1:54:35] uh
[1:54:37] the Judgment later on he crawled right
[1:54:40] so it means it was not a beast
[1:54:41] afterwards after the curse but before
[1:54:43] the curse he was a beast but let's let's
[1:54:46] read this so that this week you can have
[1:54:48] what was the fruit that they ate that
[1:54:51] opened their eyes
[1:54:52] Genesis 3 6 7 and when the when the
[1:54:55] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:54:57] food and that it was pleasant to the
[1:54:58] eyes and a tree to be decided to make
[1:55:01] one why she took off the fruit thereof
[1:55:03] and did it
[1:55:05] and gave also to her husband with her
[1:55:07] and he did it and the eyes of them
[1:55:09] both were open and they knew that they
[1:55:11] were naked and they sued feed leaves
[1:55:14] together and they themselves
[1:55:16] made aprons so eating of the fruit in
[1:55:19] proverbs 30 20.
[1:55:21] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[1:55:25] she eat it and wiped her mouth and said
[1:55:28] I have done no wickedness so this has
[1:55:31] something to do with eating
[1:55:32] so it's about the act itself eating and
[1:55:36] adultery are tied right hand and end so
[1:55:39] it's actually the ACT is adultery but uh
[1:55:42] let's tackle about the the actual thing
[1:55:44] there because that's just the result of
[1:55:47] of what uh what happened right it's just
[1:55:50] the result of the act and they heard the
[1:55:52] voice of the Lord uh so this is the the
[1:55:55] punishment or you can say uh
[1:55:57] uh start of the of the Judgment result
[1:56:01] of that after the ACT uh then they heard
[1:56:05] the voice of the Lord in Genesis 3 8 11.
[1:56:08] God walking in the garden the call of
[1:56:09] the day and Adam and his wife hid
[1:56:11] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[1:56:13] God amongst the Trees of the garden and
[1:56:15] the Lord God called unto Adam and said
[1:56:16] unto him where art thou he's not looking
[1:56:19] at him physically like it has been
[1:56:22] preached because he cannot see him
[1:56:23] anymore because there is already a veil
[1:56:26] between him and God because of the sin
[1:56:28] they fell and he said I heard thy voice
[1:56:31] in the garden I was afraid because I was
[1:56:33] naked and I hid myself and he said who
[1:56:36] told that that was naked
[1:56:40] does not eat so it means eating of the
[1:56:43] tree will make you naked we will uh
[1:56:48] it's
[1:56:50] you you can say that these are the
[1:56:52] mystery that uh that we require so that
[1:56:55] we can accept why why we need to be
[1:56:58] saved why we need a virgin birth amen
[1:57:01] because this one is a not of adultery
[1:57:05] basically
[1:57:06] so curse on The Serpent and the man said
[1:57:09] the woman whom thou gave us to be with
[1:57:12] me she gave me of the tree and I did it
[1:57:14] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:57:15] what is this that house has done and the
[1:57:17] woman said the serpent beguiled me and I
[1:57:19] did it
[1:57:21] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:57:23] because thou has done this Thou Art
[1:57:25] curse above all cattle and above every
[1:57:27] beast of the field
[1:57:29] shall thou go and thou shalt
[1:57:33] and thus shall thou eat all the days of
[1:57:35] thy life so this one you can see the
[1:57:38] blaming game right so you can see uh the
[1:57:42] the woman blamed the serpent the man
[1:57:45] blamed the woman the woman blamed the
[1:57:47] serpent amen so you can see after that
[1:57:51] there was enmity
[1:58:01] in Genesis 3 15
[1:58:04] you can see there was enmity between the
[1:58:06] serpency then woman's hit you can see
[1:58:09] there and I will put enmity between thee
[1:58:11] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:58:14] her seed and it shall bruise thy head
[1:58:15] and thou shall Bruce his heel so you can
[1:58:18] see here there are two seeds the woman
[1:58:20] had the seed
[1:58:21] and the serpent had the seed it's
[1:58:24] so the woman said is able and the
[1:58:26] serpent seed is Cain amen
[1:58:30] so and there there is always warring
[1:58:33] twins in the scripture you can see Cain
[1:58:36] and Abel ESO and Jacob Ishmael and Isaac
[1:58:39] Moses and Pharaoh Jesus and Judas
[1:58:41] there's always a wiring twins in the
[1:58:43] scripture amen
[1:58:45] let's check the curse on the woman here
[1:58:47] and to the woman he said I will greatly
[1:58:48] multiply the sorrow and their conception
[1:58:50] in sorrow that shall bring forth
[1:58:52] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:58:54] husband and he shall rule over thee
[1:58:56] so the woman's womb was cursed not her
[1:58:59] mouth
[1:59:00] so it means
[1:59:01] why it's not the mouth if they eat right
[1:59:04] she brought four twins Abel and uh in in
[1:59:10] science now it is called hetero super
[1:59:12] recondation which means you can you can
[1:59:15] have twins of different fathers
[1:59:18] right it's already proven imagine this
[1:59:20] is in 50s or 60s when Barbara was saying
[1:59:23] and now with the new technology it's
[1:59:24] even possible you can see it in Google
[1:59:26] there's so many so it's just true amen
[1:59:30] and you can see here
[1:59:33] for uh First Timothy 2 11 to 15 man
[1:59:36] shall rule over the woman because it's
[1:59:38] the woman that was deceived
[1:59:40] and was in transgression it's not the
[1:59:42] man actually Adam knew what's going on
[1:59:45] and because of his love for Eve then he
[1:59:48] took but partook also and and and took
[1:59:51] the three also which is the fruit which
[1:59:54] is the act amen
[1:59:55] and curse on Adam you can see and Anto
[1:59:58] Adam he said because thou has hearkened
[2:00:01] and to the voice of thy wife and has
[2:00:03] eaten of the tree of which I commanded
[2:00:05] thee thou shall not eat of it cursed is
[2:00:08] the ground for thy sake in sorrow shall
[2:00:11] thou eat of it all the days of Life
[2:00:13] thorns and Thorns also and Diesel shall
[2:00:16] it bring forth to thee and thou shall
[2:00:18] eat the herb of the field
[2:00:20] in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat
[2:00:23] bread till thou return unto the ground
[2:00:24] for out of it was thou taken for does
[2:00:27] that for dust Thou Art and unto that
[2:00:29] shall thou return so you see all the
[2:00:31] curse that's why man needs to work and
[2:00:34] women they workers in conception because
[2:00:37] of this curse
[2:00:39] oops
[2:00:40] uh
[2:00:43] okay it's already 9 12. it's very fast
[2:00:47] okay Eve was the mother of all living
[2:00:50] but no scriptures say that Adam is the
[2:00:53] father of all living
[2:00:55] amen and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[2:00:59] because she was the mother of all living
[2:01:00] there is no scripture that says Adam is
[2:01:03] the father of all living because the
[2:01:05] serpent is or or Kane is not the Adam's
[2:01:10] son they might not accept it but we can
[2:01:12] prove it by scripture Genesis 3 21 and
[2:01:15] to Adam also and to his wife did the
[2:01:17] Lord God make coats of skin and clothe
[2:01:19] them God killed an animal to clothe Adam
[2:01:22] and Eve to cover their nakedness
[2:01:24] this replaced the Fig leaves that dried
[2:01:27] up which they provided for their own
[2:01:28] covering so covering brother random
[2:01:31] saying it's man's religion cannot
[2:01:32] provide the covering we need the shed
[2:01:34] blood of an innocent animal for his
[2:01:37] Fallen children amen but this also is
[2:01:39] not enough
[2:01:40] to to rupture us we need the perfect
[2:01:43] sacrifice because animals they don't
[2:01:45] have souls amen we need we need we need
[2:01:48] God to to do it himself because
[2:01:51] Redemption comes through through uh
[2:01:53] through the perfect sacrifice which is
[2:01:55] Jesus Christ himself amen so you can see
[2:01:58] here Genesis 4 1-2
[2:02:01] first knowing and then two children
[2:02:03] conceived twins but of different fathers
[2:02:06] that's the hetero super recommendation
[2:02:09] that I'm talking about and Adam knew
[2:02:12] even verse 20 you can see
[2:02:14] his wife and she conceived and Burke
[2:02:16] came
[2:02:16] and said I have gotten a man from the
[2:02:18] Lord and she again bear his brother Abel
[2:02:21] and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain
[2:02:23] was a killer of the ground so that's the
[2:02:26] first knowing meaning First Union and
[2:02:28] that the First Union Yes came and yes
[2:02:30] Abel but the second one you see and Adam
[2:02:34] knew his wife again in 425 and she bear
[2:02:36] a son and called his name Seth
[2:02:38] for God said he had appointed me another
[2:02:40] seed instead of Abel whom came slow so
[2:02:43] you can see his
[2:02:45] in the first knowing there are two
[2:02:47] children conceived which are twins of
[2:02:49] different fathers amen so that's uh the
[2:02:52] serpent first and then Adam so they they
[2:02:54] are of different uh different uh fathers
[2:02:58] basically amen
[2:03:00] so was Kane a sign of Adam so these are
[2:03:03] the scriptures I mentioned Luke 3 37 38.
[2:03:07] Enos
[2:03:14] Seth and Adam you cannot find Cain in
[2:03:17] here in Luke 3 37 38 I'm just trying to
[2:03:21] make it fast June what Jude 1 14 and
[2:03:24] Enoch also the seventh from Adam
[2:03:27] prophesied of this saying behold the
[2:03:29] Lord cometh with ten thousands of his
[2:03:30] Saints if you if you will check one to
[2:03:32] seven the first is Adam second Seth
[2:03:34] there's no King there otherwise Enoch
[2:03:37] will be the eight if there is a cane
[2:03:39] right so you can see the scripture will
[2:03:41] tell us that that Cain is not a son of
[2:03:46] Adam so also in first Chronicles 1 1-4
[2:03:50] Adam said
[2:03:53] can you find Cain
[2:03:56] no by scripture you cannot find it
[2:03:58] that's why the thing is even the
[2:04:01] even the hermeneutics who who study the
[2:04:04] the Bible theologically they would they
[2:04:07] would know but then the thing is the
[2:04:09] denominations they don't accept this
[2:04:11] amen that uh for us Adam was not the
[2:04:15] father of all living because Cain was
[2:04:17] not his son amen that's a
[2:04:19] it's and you can see the
[2:04:21] this lean Gates also Adam said Enos
[2:04:25] Kanan mahalil Jared Enoch you will not
[2:04:27] find Adam and then Cain
[2:04:29] right because the birthright is always
[2:04:32] the the oldest if if Kane is the oldest
[2:04:36] then he should be the one here not not
[2:04:38] Seth right so that's the scripture
[2:04:44] uh you let's uh
[2:04:47] okay I'm uh oh wow okay a few more
[2:04:52] so you can see here what God doesn't
[2:04:55] want is mixing up seeds
[2:04:58] he wants
[2:04:59] he wants a pure Son of God that's why
[2:05:03] for us we cannot be perfect right but
[2:05:06] then the thing is we because of his
[2:05:09] blood we were made perfect he cannot see
[2:05:11] our sin anymore
[2:05:12] but you can see Genesis 6 1 2 here uh
[2:05:15] and it came to pass when men began to
[2:05:17] multiply on the face of the Earth and
[2:05:19] daughters were born unto them that the
[2:05:20] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[2:05:22] that they were fair and they took them
[2:05:24] wives of all which they choose so you
[2:05:27] see there is a mixing of seeds here the
[2:05:29] sons of God saw the daughters of men so
[2:05:32] the sons of God are Adam's Lee needs up
[2:05:34] to Noah because Noah is the last uh pure
[2:05:38] uh Son of God basically it's a pure
[2:05:41] breed but then the daughters of man are
[2:05:43] Cain's lineage they intermingled that's
[2:05:46] why God was so angry and then he sent
[2:05:48] the flood God hates I breathing that
[2:05:51] that's why he destroyed man through the
[2:05:53] flood amen So High breathing this one is
[2:05:56] very technical and medical which is the
[2:06:00] truth you you will see we have different
[2:06:03] blood types I think I preached before
[2:06:04] but without any diagram we have o a b a
[2:06:08] b so you can see here
[2:06:11] if if the parent one is a b and AV so he
[2:06:14] can be either blood type a b or a B this
[2:06:17] is based on Red Cross okay I think we
[2:06:20] will believe that because Red Cross is
[2:06:22] is
[2:06:23] believable you can say yeah so these are
[2:06:27] the the most common is o
[2:06:29] so and so on and so forth you can see oh
[2:06:31] oh so the thing is if Adam Adam came
[2:06:35] from Eve
[2:06:36] right so they should have a same blood
[2:06:38] type
[2:06:40] right
[2:06:41] but then the thing is where did this
[2:06:43] bloody blood types came from from us
[2:06:47] with different blood types we cannot
[2:06:49] even check where we came from now
[2:06:52] because of mixing up seeds right so in
[2:06:56] fact we have the serpent seed in us
[2:06:58] that's why we need to be born again
[2:07:01] spiritually right
[2:07:03] because we insane we were conceived and
[2:07:06] you can see that that uh
[2:07:09] if if for example because the most
[2:07:11] common is O if Adam is O then Eve is O
[2:07:14] then all the Suns would be oh but then
[2:07:17] the thing is we're not all type of uh
[2:07:19] people right we have different types of
[2:07:22] blood so so what's the original sin then
[2:07:27] just to to wrap up
[2:07:29] the original sin first the Commandment
[2:07:32] is don't eat the fruit of the tree of
[2:07:34] knowledge of Good and Evil correct
[2:07:37] but what is the action of the man and
[2:07:39] the woman
[2:07:40] they eat the fruit of the tree of
[2:07:42] knowledge of Good and Evil
[2:07:44] so what is the original sin then so the
[2:07:48] first commandment is don't eat of this
[2:07:50] fruit at first did they eat right away
[2:07:52] or did Adam eat the fruit right away no
[2:07:56] so it means they believe the word
[2:07:58] the word of God but then come come Eve
[2:08:01] coming out of Adam and then the serpent
[2:08:04] coming
[2:08:05] deceiving Eve
[2:08:08] right he this he was able to deceive Eve
[2:08:11] at first Eve when the serpent is not
[2:08:15] there
[2:08:16] she believed the word completely
[2:08:18] because in fact there is no other person
[2:08:20] there so the one that com uh that told
[2:08:23] Eve what the Commandment original
[2:08:25] commandment is that you should not eat
[2:08:27] of this tree is Adam because there is no
[2:08:30] other person there so she knows the
[2:08:32] Commandment that thou shall not eat and
[2:08:34] when the serpent is not there
[2:08:36] they believe but then come The Serpent
[2:08:39] and then he was able to deceive Eve so
[2:08:42] but in order to deceive Eve he
[2:08:45] has to take away the word of of God
[2:08:49] through Adam that they cannot eat that
[2:08:52] fruit
[2:08:53] so upon removing or not believing that
[2:08:57] word of Adam then she was able to
[2:08:59] partake
[2:09:00] the fruit
[2:09:02] so what did Eve do on the word of God
[2:09:06] then or or or of of the word of the
[2:09:08] Commandment she didn't believe the word
[2:09:10] and then she partook of the tree she
[2:09:12] believed the serpent so that's why
[2:09:14] Barbara Branham is saying it's unbelief
[2:09:16] in the word of God that's the original
[2:09:18] sin
[2:09:19] right because
[2:09:21] Disobedience many people or many
[2:09:24] denominations will say the original sin
[2:09:25] is Disobedience because they didn't
[2:09:28] they didn't follow the Commandment of
[2:09:30] God but actually they they didn't
[2:09:33] believe First the word and then they
[2:09:35] disobeyed so it's just a hairline
[2:09:38] uh reaction or you can say uh result of
[2:09:43] unbelieving the word that's why brother
[2:09:45] Branham is saying and belief in the word
[2:09:47] of God is the original sin he said
[2:09:50] drinking adultery and all these things
[2:09:52] are not the original sin they are just
[2:09:55] the product of your unbelief that's why
[2:09:57] you're doing it
[2:09:58] amen so it's just to position it that's
[2:10:01] why we we are we are commanded
[2:10:04] instructed to go back to the world go
[2:10:06] back to the absolute go back to the
[2:10:08] original word because the original sin
[2:10:10] is unbelief in the word of God
[2:10:13] that's the only way you can take out or
[2:10:16] you the only way you will be able to
[2:10:19] disobey if you have unbelief
[2:10:22] right I think a a good example is if
[2:10:25] I'll tell miles miles don't eat
[2:10:27] chocolate because your your teeth will
[2:10:29] will rot
[2:10:32] and then she he believes me right you
[2:10:34] will just believe me and then come
[2:10:36] Daniel sorry Daniel and then Daniel will
[2:10:37] say
[2:10:39] uh I I have a lot of chocolates I'll
[2:10:41] give it to you and then they say no no
[2:10:43] my my dad said my my teeth will rot no
[2:10:47] no no you see my teeth they're not
[2:10:49] rotten I have a lot of chocolate I ate
[2:10:50] it
[2:10:51] so then miles took the chocolate and
[2:10:54] then eat it but then the thing is what
[2:10:56] did Miles before before Daniel come came
[2:11:00] what what uh what is his belief he
[2:11:04] believed on my word that he will not eat
[2:11:06] any chocolate there is no deceiver at
[2:11:08] all but then come Daniel and then no you
[2:11:10] will let your teeth will be good look at
[2:11:13] mine and then the only way uh miles will
[2:11:17] disobey my or or will not believe by
[2:11:19] word or or the only way he will disobey
[2:11:22] my uh my commandment to him if he will
[2:11:25] not believe my word he will take
[2:11:27] Daniel's word
[2:11:28] right so
[2:11:30] I hope I explained it it might be
[2:11:32] difficult
[2:11:33] it's a bit uh yeah so okay two more
[2:11:37] few more slides how can we be saved then
[2:11:39] every person that is born of the Union
[2:11:42] of a mom mother and a father must have a
[2:11:45] new birth
[2:11:47] because in sin we are conceived
[2:11:50] and how can we be saved by being born
[2:11:52] again
[2:11:53] and being born again means you will have
[2:11:55] the the the the Holy Ghost in us right
[2:11:58] so it means uh it's accepting Jesus
[2:12:01] Christ as our Lord and personal Savior
[2:12:03] and New Birth means is the revelation of
[2:12:06] Jesus Christ personally to us
[2:12:08] that's the message amen and uh
[2:12:12] because of the unbelief we yeah okay why
[2:12:17] why God requires blood for salvation
[2:12:19] because almost all things
[2:12:22] are by the law perched with blood and
[2:12:25] without shedding of blood there's no
[2:12:26] remission so something has to die
[2:12:29] so that we can live and we eat we need
[2:12:33] to eat food to live right but every time
[2:12:35] that we eat something has to die so that
[2:12:37] we can live we want steak a cow needs to
[2:12:40] die we live by that substance amen even
[2:12:43] the potato the potato plant has to die
[2:12:45] so that you can get the potato we will
[2:12:47] only be saved have eternal life by the
[2:12:49] shedding of the blood of the Lamb that
[2:12:52] is the death of Jesus Christ Hebrews 10
[2:12:54] 9-10 amen so okay white virgin birth
[2:12:59] oh sorry
[2:13:05] so why do we need virgin birth
[2:13:09] okay
[2:13:10] okay sorry
[2:13:12] uh page 43 brother
[2:13:17] why do we need virgin birth why is it
[2:13:19] required for Redemption because any man
[2:13:22] that is born through the union of a man
[2:13:24] and a woman is conceived in sin because
[2:13:25] of lust that's why the only perfect
[2:13:28] sacrifice is Virgin birth amen the
[2:13:31] Redeemer or savior must not be born out
[2:13:33] of last or out of sex that is the reason
[2:13:36] why Jesus Christ was born through Virgin
[2:13:38] Birth by the spoken word of God
[2:13:40] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost
[2:13:41] Immaculate Conception God himself
[2:13:43] created the blood cell amen
[2:13:46] and why can't we be saved by Good Works
[2:13:51] it's not by own by our own righteousness
[2:13:53] it's not self-righteousness but by his
[2:13:55] grace alone for by Grace we are saved
[2:13:58] through faith and that not of ourselves
[2:13:59] it is the gift of God not of Works lest
[2:14:03] any man should boast amen okay last
[2:14:07] last slide
[2:14:09] you see here we cannot help being what
[2:14:12] we are
[2:14:13] because we're born in sin right even if
[2:14:16] you're a sinner you're not responsible
[2:14:18] for being a sinner because we were born
[2:14:20] a child doesn't know that he or she has
[2:14:24] a sin but she's born out of lust that's
[2:14:27] why she's born a sinner right you're
[2:14:30] responsible for remaining a sinner
[2:14:33] right why there is a way prepared for
[2:14:36] you but to be a sinner you was born that
[2:14:39] way
[2:14:40] God doesn't send you to hell for being a
[2:14:42] sinner
[2:14:43] God sends you to hell because you won't
[2:14:46] repent and take Christ as your savior
[2:14:50] you refuse to take the right Road you
[2:14:52] send yourself to torment you send your
[2:14:54] own soul to its Eternal destination upon
[2:14:56] the free moral agency of your own
[2:14:58] convictions God does not send anyone to
[2:15:01] hell he never did and he never will men
[2:15:04] send themselves to hell
[2:15:06] it's their own choosing
[2:15:09] they refuse to accept the way of
[2:15:11] salvation
[2:15:13] he is long-suffering he doesn't want any
[2:15:15] to perish never wanted it so you see
[2:15:19] if we have the absolute which is the
[2:15:21] word of God then we don't need to worry
[2:15:23] at all
[2:15:24] and even the election
[2:15:26] it's already prophesied that's why when
[2:15:28] we pray we pray not to change God's mind
[2:15:33] we pray that God will change our mind
[2:15:35] and if we are praying and if we have
[2:15:38] God's mind then we will ask what the
[2:15:40] promises are I'll call the musicians
[2:15:42] right so so the thing there is it's very
[2:15:44] important to be positionally placed
[2:15:47] knowing what we are and who we are then
[2:15:50] we're already healed of our spiritual
[2:15:52] amnesia
[2:15:54] right because we know where we're going
[2:15:57] right we know our past we know the
[2:15:59] future and we are living in presence so
[2:16:01] we're just whatever happens we know
[2:16:03] we're
[2:16:04] will will be in glory
[2:16:06] right and because of because of the
[2:16:09] instructions through prophets because
[2:16:11] the word comes through prophets and we
[2:16:13] believe that and we're so thankful
[2:16:15] that we are able to understand it we see
[2:16:18] it the light doesn't mean anything if we
[2:16:21] don't have the eyes to see that's why we
[2:16:22] were given the prophetic eye which is
[2:16:24] Eagle anointing flying eagle anointing
[2:16:27] that we can soar High
[2:16:28] amen and then we can see the whole the
[2:16:31] end from the beginning we're so thankful
[2:16:33] brothers and sisters and this message
[2:16:35] brothers and sisters is is for rapture
[2:16:38] it's for Glory it's not for salvation
[2:16:41] only because there are other people
[2:16:43] other classes of people that will be
[2:16:45] saved right because they do good things
[2:16:47] to to the bride right but that's not us
[2:16:50] for us this message is for rapture
[2:16:54] I explained it before it's just like a
[2:16:57] magnifying glass that if you cannot read
[2:17:00] then you will just have to magnify and
[2:17:03] and like a microscope but you didn't
[2:17:05] change what is written there you cannot
[2:17:08] read it because it's maybe the the
[2:17:09] letters are small but then the message
[2:17:11] was given so that we can magnify it and
[2:17:13] then oh that's what it is right and also
[2:17:16] it's like a compass that will point to
[2:17:18] the North Star the North Star is always
[2:17:20] the word the North Star doesn't move
[2:17:22] other stars will move depends on the
[2:17:24] rotation of the world right of the
[2:17:28] universe but then the North Star
[2:17:29] the word the the compass which is the
[2:17:32] holy spirit will always points us to the
[2:17:34] word the message is like that if we will
[2:17:37] place it that way we would know that the
[2:17:39] word is the absolute and the word of God
[2:17:41] comes through the prophets and they will
[2:17:43] have that said the Lord they cannot say
[2:17:44] anything based on their own opinions
[2:17:47] amen that's why when this was revealed
[2:17:50] to us we we cannot have but just thank
[2:17:53] the Lord how come we open our eyes
[2:17:57] not many people understands that
[2:18:00] understand that and uh we were given
[2:18:03] that knowledge
[2:18:04] to know what it is amen and and knowing
[2:18:08] that we are the bride sinless spotless
[2:18:10] bride of Jesus Christ never seen in the
[2:18:13] first place we're so thankful Amen
