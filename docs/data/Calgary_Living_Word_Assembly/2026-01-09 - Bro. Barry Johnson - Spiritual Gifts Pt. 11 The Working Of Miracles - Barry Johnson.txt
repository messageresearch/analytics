Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together once again in his [music] name. &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for this day. We know this day is the day that you have made. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, we will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that if there's a trial and there's a tribulation, it's because you have allowed it in our lives. And it's for a purpose, Lord. And help us to recognize that, Lord Jesus, [music] that there's no accidents, there's no mishaps, Lord Jesus. Everything happens [music] for a purpose according to your will. And tonight, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that we can gather [music] here as our brother prayed. Lord, we do not take it for granted, Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't know how many days we have here on this side of eternity where we have this kind of freedom, Lord Jesus. [music] And Father, if it were ever taken away from us, would we ever look back and wonder, did we have more to give you? &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this opportunity, Lord. And father, we just invite you to have your will and your way in this service, Lord, in our hearts and our minds, Lord. [music] Help us to see less of ourselves, Lord, and more of you tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just want to remember each and every request that was made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand, Father, by faith, [music] Lord Jesus, by defying gravity, Lord, to say, "Be it unto me according to the promises contained in your word, which is your will." Father, tonight we just want to continue to uphold the Natarak family before you, Lord. It's just [music] a difficult situation, Lord. And I know, Father, there's questions in their hearts wondering why it has to be this [music] way. Father, that boy never did anything on this side wrong. But Lord, we know many times we don't have to ask why. &gt;&gt; We just trust you, Lord, that you're in control. &gt;&gt; And we know one day the disciples asked you, "Why was that boy blind? And father, they wondered, was it because of sin &gt;&gt; in his life? Was it because of sin in his parents' [music] life? And you corrected them and you told them that it was so that your power could be manifested &gt;&gt; on this side, Lord. So that we could recognize that you are more than a man, &gt;&gt; that you are more than a prophet. And Father, tonight you are the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And we claim that, Lord. Father, many times it seems so difficult to even understand, but Lord, you never called us to understand. &gt;&gt; You asked us to believe &gt;&gt; and we do, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and Lord Jesus, at the same time, help thou our unbelief, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight we pray that you would bless the Natarak family, Lord. Make yourself so real to Zach Natarak tonight. We ask, oh, Father, and thereby the rest of the family. strengthen them and encourage them, we ask, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight as we turn to your word, we just ask, Father, that you would be glorified in all that's said and done. &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you the thanks. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all of these things in Jesus Christ's name we [music] pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you musicians. God bless you [music] once again for your service in the house of the Lord. But if you have your Bibles tonight, I would like to continue on with our discussion, our study from uh Corinthians about the gifts. 1 Corinthians chapter 12. I was looking back on the notes and it seems it's been quite a while since we spoke on the on the gifts and uh certainly excited to get back into it again. It's been a real blessing for me and I hope it has for you and uh we just trust the Lord will have his way as we go through this little study here. In 1 Corinthians 12 verse one says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant that you know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. To one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom. To another the word of knowledge by the same spirit. To another faith by the same spirit. To another the gifts of healing by the same spirit. To another the working of miracles. To another prophecy. to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been made have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member but many. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we can gather together tonight as many members of your body. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would just express to us your word which is your will tonight one more time. Father, in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Just a few announcements tonight. Um, we have the prayer meeting tomorrow night at 7:30. If you uh have the desire, we certainly welcome you to come. Just wanted to remind us we have brother Maxwell Bang Jr. here on January the 24th at 6 PM. January the 25th will be a Sunday service at 10:00 a.m. So that's a Saturday night service and a Sunday morning service. We're certainly excited to see him. He is over in Ireland right now and uh he'll be coming back here soon. We have the uh January youth meeting I believe. Is it the 25th? It's changed a bit but I think I got that right for a change. And we have the uh youth service as well on January the 30th. Are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm certainly thankful to be back &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord. And I just want to want to say something before we get going too far. And that is [snorts] I hope you know my heart. My heart's desire is that I really appreciate each and everyone especially the service in the house of the Lord. And uh on Sunday it seems that I said some stuff under I'll say it under anointing because it wasn't even really my vocabulary. But I I mentioned about the ensemble and uh by no means would I ever want to criticize anyone for their efforts to bring forth a special or to actually play an instrument in the house of the Lord. And I can tell you for sure there's been times in my life where as in even in the pastor role where I've thought that doesn't sound right or that that sounds different or something needs to be done about that. But the Lord said to me, "No, what you need to do is sit down and pray about it. You don't need to say a word about it to anybody." And uh I've done that in the past and I've seen circumstances change. So I just want to say that if if anything that I said did offend anybody, I truly sincerely apologize for the offense because I certainly would never want to do that. But at the same time, I want to explain that when we're under the anointing of preaching, things can be said. And sometimes they have they have a meaning. And uh you know, one of the things that I also mentioned was speeding. And I'll tell you, if it wasn't for anyone else, it was for me. It was for me because you know what I've done constantly, continually, I'm not going to lie about it. And maybe someone can prosecute me for even saying this on film, but I have driven continually um 10 kilometers over, 20 km over. Sometimes I like to step my foot on the gas pedal and feel some acceleration. I'm not going to lie about that, especially when going up a hill. But, you know, when the Lord speaks, we have the opportunity to listen or not. &gt;&gt; And and I don't know exactly what that was addressing pertaining specifically to the the word ensemble. Just to be clear, we had those musicians playing the stringed instruments in our living room the night before and they were practicing this and it was amazing. I have video of it. [laughter] I I would no way ever criticize. I actually took it seriously to heart when I'll just be honest with you. My wife said to me, "Do you know what you said? I'm so thankful for a wife that supports me in the ministry because it really checked me. It made me think, why would I even say that word? That's not my vocabulary. And that triggered something in me. It made me think maybe I ought to go and look it up. And so I did that. And you know, it doesn't speak. I thought that it would speak about an orchestra or stringed instruments because I really felt checked about this, but it doesn't say anything about that. It talks about musicians in general. It talks about acting. I could read the description. You could look it up. I just want you to know my heart. I would never ever ever directly throw off on anyone individually. If I had an issue, I would come to you directly and speak to you just like the word says because that's the direction of the word. So, um, honestly, I don't understand it sometimes, but we just want to trust the Lord and hope that the the the leadership of the Lord is actually what's coming through and it's not the humanity of a man. &gt;&gt; So, just so you know, my heart, I uh greatly appreciate the music and especially that, you know, I I'll just have to say a little more about it. that stringed uh stringed instrument, call it ensemble, call it special, whatever we want to call it. On Sunday, it was beautiful because uh we were talking about it in our living room. The first time I saw two violins playing was up at Brother Eugene's church in a service. Um we haven't had violins here for uh I think forever until the Livies came. But the first time I I heard that two violins playing together, it was the special. It was a special and and the two violins began playing and they kind of went back and forth with their music. But something happened about halfway through that special and both violins became one sound. &gt;&gt; And that's what happened here on Sunday, I believe. &gt;&gt; It was tremendous. &gt;&gt; It was really, really good. I have no criticism about the string special that happened here on Sunday. So, just want to be absolutely crystal clear about that. That's my heart. We're talking about spiritual gifts and uh you know it's out of the scripture in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. My heart's desire with this has been for the duration of it up until now to remind us that they are supposed to be in the church. Brother Bham said that every local church ought to see these gifts in their midst and uh we mustn't be afraid of them. And if we are afraid of them, I would say why are we afraid of them? Typically what happens is the the the preaching of men, the the doctrines of men become commandments. And uh what can happen over time is traditions can take over and we wind up being led by the ideology of men. And you know a denominational spirit is a very subtle spirit. &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm preaching about it. Why I felt led to go down this road because these gifts are supposed to be in the body. &gt;&gt; We oughtn't to be afraid of them. There's no reason for us to be afraid of them other than perhaps some sort of teaching somewhere along the way that said this is wrong. Now, speaking in tongues, Brother Brandham would say, is not wrong. &gt;&gt; The way the Pentecostal church did it after the Isuza Street revival, it became something that became denominated. And instead of it being an an actual experience of Pentecost in the life of a given believer, what it became is a denomination. Brother Brandham talks about it over and over and over again through the message of the hour when I first came in. My background is Pentecost, the Pentecostal uh movement. Uh, so I actually started to take offense to it when I came in and around the message to hear how he talked about it. But it just became so clear when I was able to mature a little bit and understand that he wasn't talking about the individuals. He was talking about the anointed spirit behind the individuals, those people that would rather actually follow the leadership of a man instead of following the leadership of the Holy Ghost. And that can happen around the message of the hour. And that's why I'm talking about this. People can say flat out there can be no tongues because if we speak in tonesues then it's going to be incorrect. And you know what some people might believe that with all their heart and that's okay but the word of God says that it is supposed to happen and William Brham said it as well. But talking about the spiritual gifts we have the gift of knowledge. There's nine of them. Gift of knowledge, gift of wisdom, gift of faith, gift of healing, gift of working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, diverse kinds of tongues and interpretation of tongues, the nine spiritual gifts which are given to every man to profit with all. Now, I think it's beautiful when we look at this. Um, I I get a little blurry in where I remember things from because of the amount of interaction that I do. I I'm pretty social in terms of of fellowshipping around the word and a lot of it is online but uh just listening to the message and and so on and so forth. I heard it recently that you know the gifts in the church aren't actually necessarily individually given to a person so that they can bless their life. Their gift is for the others in the congregation. &gt;&gt; If I have a gift of discernment, it ain't for me. It's for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you have a gift of healing, it ain't for you. &gt;&gt; It's for someone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we have the gift of speaking in tongues, it's not for us. It's for somebody else. Because brother Bradom says very clearly according to the first church age messenger, Paul the Apostle, that if someone's going to speak in tonesues, there needs to be an interpretation of that speaking in tonesues. And it's not going to be blah blah blah quoting quoting the prophet. It's not going to be blah blah blah. It's going to be very specifically don't, brother Emanuel and Sister Helen, don't drive home the way that you normally drive home tonight. Drive home an alternate route because there's going to be a terrible accident. Thus saith the Lord. It will be a very specific directive by the Holy Ghost. It won't just be repeating a scripture. It won't just be quoting the prophet. It will be a very specific thing. We We don't need to be afraid of it. We've got direction. Paul the Apostle set the church in order all through the ages. They got mixed up and off the rails. And then the apostle or the prophet in the day in which we live, William Mary Brandham, came and put everyone right back in order, not with his own order, right back to Paul's order, to the original order. It's so beautiful. We have that direction in our our church in our lives. You know, where we left off last time was with the gifts of healing, I believe. And uh I just want to read one quote here out of 1964. Looking unto Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I take every spirit in here under my control." The most powerful words I think that could ever be spoken by a human being on this side of eternity. Isn't it? I take every spirit in here under my control to declare the word of God. &gt;&gt; But who could actually say those words, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Many people can say them. And and we know, brother Brandham, he gives the example. It's so beautiful how he gives examples, right? He talks about the policeman standing out there on the street with a a 400 horsepower car coming down the road. And that policeman could go out and stand in front of that car and and show him his uniform and raise his hand up and that car can be revving down this the road and and not stop because who cares? It's a policeman. Brother Bradam says that's the way it is with a man. But if that man now takes out a badge and holds up that badge, that badge signals authority behind that man. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing with us and our voice, our words. If we take the token and hold it up with the authority of the Holy Ghost in us, it's a different story. &gt;&gt; Bam says, "I take every spirit in here under my control to declare the word of God." Here is a picture tonight like St. John the 4th chapter. A man and a woman meet together, I suppose, for the first time. I don't know you. You probably know me by papers and hearsay, but I don't know you. You know that we're strangers to each other. Like our Lord met a woman one time at the well. A man and a woman meeting talking. But if I come like one of some of our brethren would say, "God gave me a gift of healing." You know what the gift of healing is? Faith in healing. Faith in healing. See, you just release your faith to pray for somebody. That's all a gift of healing is. &gt;&gt; Every minister should have it. &gt;&gt; Every minister should have it. &gt;&gt; Everybody see should have a gift of healing. This is I believe profound. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; Don't you believe how profound this is? Everyone, everybody see should have a gift of healing. &gt;&gt; The power that heals you is on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You just have to let it work its way out. &gt;&gt; And that's why we gather together, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful when we think about this or talk about this? We just have to kind of find a venue, don't we? To just let that Holy Spirit work its way out. And I can only imagine what it would be like to be a musician. What it would be like to have a a way to express that that Holy Ghost that you have in your life to to let it work its way out. And you know, brothers and sisters, my heart's truest heart desire for the musicians is play from your heart. Let that Holy Spirit work his way out in your gift as you play. &gt;&gt; And any other way is going to be incorrect. And I believe that is the that's the gist of maybe what was being said on Sunday. If we're playing to perform, it's not going to achieve what we want. We want to let the Holy Ghost out through the music that we play, through the songs that we sing, through the worship that we have, so that the word of God can actually work his way out of us as well. I think it's so beautiful. The power that heals you is on the inside of you. The Holy Spirit, you just have to let it work its way out. &gt;&gt; That's all. Just like the life that's in the tree. You don't have to pour the apples in the tree to make it bear apples. &gt;&gt; It's just planted in the ground and it drinks and pushes out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why we come to church, ain't it? &gt;&gt; So that we can drink and push out. So that we can eat and push out. And remember, part of it, unfortunately, Brother Brandham says it is that the wind has to blow and the trees need to stretch. And as they blow in the wind and the storm and they stretch back and forth, those roots that are holding it in, sometimes they're just barely holding on into the ground. But what happens is that ground softens up and as it drinks in, that tree drinks in and pushes out. It doesn't just push out the branches. It pushes roots deeper from [clears throat] those storms that stretch the ground underneath it. But it's already there. It just needs to drink in and push out. He says, "Well, that's the way you do the Holy Spirit. It's on the inside of you. You just drink from the inexhaustible fountain of Jesus Christ and it pushes out the fruits of the spirit." See, that's all we have to do is just drink from that inexhaustible fountain. And remember, one little spoonful of the ocean contains the entire ocean's elements. &gt;&gt; If we have one little spoonful, one tiny little measure of the Holy Ghost in our life, brothers and sisters, that's all we ever need. &gt;&gt; When that Holy Ghost spirit touches that seed gene of God, there is going to be a spark of life that takes place that we will not even be able to control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's such a beautiful thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if there's any gifts in the body, any gifts from the spirit, they all come from God. &gt;&gt; I think it's just a beautiful thought. The gifts, the gifts when they when they're there in our lives, we don't just get them one day. We have them always. &gt;&gt; We're born with the gifts. &gt;&gt; And it's such an amazing thing to think about, isn't it? The gifts that we have. Every single gift comes from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those genes were inside us before the foundation of the world. to have those gifts. And and you know, everybody in the world has gifts whether they recognize it or not. Everyone has gifts in their life. And some of the gifts are actually for good and some are for bad. &gt;&gt; Because we know that power without character is what? &gt;&gt; It's satanic. &gt;&gt; And satanic isn't necessarily like we said the pentagram and the candles and all the worship that way. It's not that. It's actually one word off of the word of God is satanic. Let's be clear. We don't have to be a a a devil worshipper to be satanic. If we're not willing to follow the word of God, if we're going to resist the Holy Ghost, we're satanic. &gt;&gt; But the gifts that we have in our life, they're either anointed and and offered back to the Lord or they're offered back to Satan. They didn't come from Satan, but they're offered to Satan. and and they're going to be expressed one way or the other. But to think about the gift that he gives us, the spirit that anoints the gift. So if we have the Holy Spirit anointing our gift, we're going to see the right results with those gifts. But like we said earlier, the gifts that we have in our lives, they're for the entire body. They're to profit every man with all. They're not for ourselves. We're not supposed to take our gifts and hoard them for ourselves. We're supposed to actually offer them as a sweet savor unto the Lord. And I think it's so beautiful because many times that's not just coming to church and giving our our our gifts as a sacrifice. It's it's actually giving our gifts to the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not letting the right hand know what the left hand is doing &gt;&gt; because it's irrelevant whether it gets advertised or not. What's important is that he knows. &gt;&gt; He knows whether we're hoarding our gifts or not. And you know, we could get right into that that story and one day we might with the the gifts maybe when we start to wrap it up. But to take talk about the talent, the gifts of the talent, you know, it's it's a discussion about money and many times it's used about money and sure enough it applies that way. But I believe it also applies about the gifts, the talents that God has put in our lives. Are we just going to take those talents and and bury them and say, "I've got the talents and hoard them for myself, or am I going to actually go out there and multiply the talents? Am I going to teach someone something about what I know how to do? Am I going to encourage someone to do something with what I know how to do? There's a lot that we can do with the gifts that we have in our lives, but these gifts are for the entire body. And we rely on each other. I heard a brother say this and it just really really struck me. You know, the gifts in the body causes us to live in a symbiotic relationship, &gt;&gt; doesn't it? We live in a symbiotic relationship with the gifts because the gifts, someone might have one gift, someone might have another gift, but we rely on the body for those gifts. &gt;&gt; And how can we be an island and just live outside of a body, but still claim, I got the Holy Ghost and I believe the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. HOW DOES THAT WORK? &gt;&gt; I just don't understand it myself. But you know, it's so beautiful that we understand that we have these gifts in the body and they're for every one of us &gt;&gt; to profit for every one of us to do better, to increase. It's so beautiful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's to profit with all. &gt;&gt; So I was looking at this word with all G4851. It's pronounced sum furrow and it's to bear together. These gifts are so that we can bear together. Not bear apart. Not bear apart, but bear together. And and you know this this verse seven out of chapter 12 out of the Amplified Bible talking about this bear together with all says, "But to each one is given the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, the evidence, the spiritual illumination of the spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. for good and profit. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not talking about going out and turning a prophet turning a $100 into a thousand and a thousand into 10,000 and a h 100,000 and a million. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about spiritual profit, seeing our children serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Being able to see our children's children serve the Lord. being able to have a place, a sanctuary, a body of believers that we can see working together in this symbiotic relationship. I think it's beautiful though, the spiritual illumination of the spirit. Who doesn't want to see the spiritual elimination of the spirit? I think we all do. Tonight we're talking about the working of miracles. And uh you know, I just started thinking about this and uh I hope it's okay. Tonight I started thinking about how there's so many people in the Bible and and how they actually really brought miracles. There are so many miracles that happened. And we know that if there is a miracle that takes place in the Bible or in our lives that it's truly the Lord doing it. It's not us doing it. We know the book of Acts, the the Bibles are written the Acts of the Apostles. But we know we've one of the things that brother Brandham said, one of the mysteries that he clarified was it's not the acts of the apostles, it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles. &gt;&gt; That just makes me think uh what are the acts of the Holy Ghost in Brother Barry? &gt;&gt; What are the acts of the Holy Ghost in in Calvary Living Word Assembly? What what are the acts of the Holy Ghost in in the bride body here on earth? you know, uh, one of them is probably working in of in of miracles, but I just started thinking about it in the Bible and and and and the people, the characters. And, uh, you know, Moses is one that comes to light in in my mind. And so, I started thinking about Moses. And, you know, talk about a life of miracles. Hey, he was called as a miracle before he even came to earth. The people were calling for a deliverer. And once they called for a deliverer enough 30 years overtime, the promise was for 400 years. And we know they went 430. In some places it says, I believe even 440. But he went the the children of Israel went over time and they started to call for a deliverer. And God sent them a deliverer. And we know that after he had been raised, he he came as a complete miracle as a baby. It it's interesting to look at his life because we Pharaoh recognized there was a prophecy. The sinners in the world recognized the prophetic utterance, right? And the reason he did or how I'm saying that is because he said, "Hey, if there is a deliverer here, potentially a baby boy, anything two years and under, kill him. &gt;&gt; Feed them all to the crocodiles. Stab them with a knife. Kill those babies. Get rid of them." Pharaoh believed &gt;&gt; the prophecy, but Moses was a miracle, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; Because even through that prophetic utterance and and the actions of the sinner Pharaoh in the land, what happened was miraculously this baby was saved. And and what happened is this baby wasn't just saved. This baby went to the house of the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the enemy saved this baby. And the enemy said, "This baby has to have a nursing mama somewhere. Where is she? Get her. Bring her to the palace and get her to nurse this baby." It's amazing to think about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This guy's full of miracles in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once upon a time, he was out on the back side of the desert. Just to fast forward, we know that he killed a man. He had to run away. He he was out there. But what happened was that pillar of fire came down and and rested in a bush. That pillar of fire came and visited this guy. Another miracle. &gt;&gt; And we know that God in that pillar of fire said, "I'm just going to wait and see. As soon as I catch his attention, when God caught his attention, then he spoke to him out of that burning bush." So many miracles in this guy's life. Just amazing. And you know, I'm going to say this now, but we're going to keep saying it tonight. One of these days, we're going to say, "Moses, what was it like all of the miracles?" And he's going to say, "Well, you know, we'll get to that. But what was it like for you &gt;&gt; to live IN THAT TIME COMING OUT OF Leadyia into that little tiny space where there's SUPPOSED TO BE NO LIGHT IN THE BRIGHT AGE? WHAT WAS IT LIKE to live with all of the devils poured out of hell upon the earth? you were able to overcome all of that. How did YOU DO THAT? HOW DID THOSE MIRACLES happen in your life? It makes me think, brothers and sisters, the devil doesn't want us to see miracles in our life. How many times are there miracles in our life? How many times do we go to sleep and the devil's desiring to take our life this night? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the angel of the Lord says, "Nope, &gt;&gt; not yet." How many times does the devil desire to give us a virus? &gt;&gt; But the angel of the Lord says, "Nope. &gt;&gt; Not this one." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times a car accident? How many times a financial ruin? HOW MANY TIMES A DIVORCE? HOW MANY TIMES A A CHILD separated from their parents? But the angel of the Lord says, "Nope, not this family. Nope, not this one. Not this car." It's amazing to think about. &gt;&gt; We're talking about us in parallel while we talk about these heroes of the Bible. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the internet in their those days, did they? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They never had all of the temptation of the senses in those days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But here we are. &gt;&gt; Somehow someway we have the desire to come to church on a Wednesday night. That's got to say something to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look at at Moses and how he lived his life. And you know when God finally got his attention from that burning bush and told him, "Moses, you're going to actually turn around and you're going to go right back down and you're going to go into Egypt and you're going to take over. It's going to be a one-man invasion of Egypt." Can you imagine what must have gone through his head? He knew the inner workings of the palace. He knew the inner workings of Pharaoh and his armies. But yet here he is now, the old man with a stick in his hand and a wife and a baby heading down to Egypt. He's going to go take over. Brother Brandham says it that way. Where you going, Moses? Where you going with that stick in your hand, Moses? He's going down to take over. A one-man invasion of the greatest army on earth, the greatest nation on the planet. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he gets down there and then, you know, we could talk about every one, but I'm just going to I'm just going to cruise over them because there's lots more to talk about tonight. But think about all the plagues, all of those working of miracles that he did rather that God did through him. &gt;&gt; And what happened was he just listened to the voice of the Lord. And even when God was calling him, isn't it interesting when God was telling him, "You're going to go down there and you're going to do all this stuff. You're going to just do what I say." Even when he was having the conversation, the initial introduction, the the burning bush, he said, "But but but but I stutter. But but but how could I ever do this? But I'm not an eloquent man. But I I I have this. But I have that. All of the other all of my flesh. Look at my imperfections." And God said to him, "You know what? Just go do what I say. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're going to be just fine. &gt;&gt; Get Aaron to speak for you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You be God and let Aaron be your prophet. &gt;&gt; Just do what I say. Go forwards and let me work out the details. &gt;&gt; It's just so amazing to look at. &gt;&gt; Just one example &gt;&gt; of working of miracles, but such tremendous miracles. &gt;&gt; If we just follow the Lord, what kind of miracles could he work out in our lives? and and what kind of miracles does he continually work out in our lives? &gt;&gt; Because I am in no way saying that he doesn't or that he hasn't. I'm saying that he has. And many times we don't even acknowledge it because we don't even recognize it. We just get up in the morning and we've got breath in our lungs and blood in our veins and we're able to get up and and shuffle our way to go make a coffee in the morning and and wake up to the world, &gt;&gt; right? BUT GETTING OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING, brothers and sisters, is a little bit miraculous if you really want my honest opinion about it. There's a lot of people that would love to be able to just get out of bed in the morning, but just can't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet, we do. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; I just think that we need to make room for that Holy Spirit to just work his way out. Don't you just let him work his way out in our lives? you know, Joshua, Joshua in his calling, the the calling for Joshua. Miraculous, isn't it? He went and saw all of the the miracles before. So, he knew the God that they were serving, the God that they were following. And his commission after Moses was taken out of the way is, you know what? Everywhere the soul of your foot will tread is your possession. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, when you look at this, if you studied a little bit in the message, for those that know, you can just go right back to the book of uh or not the book, but the the study of adoption, right? The the adoption series. That's exactly where Brother Brandham goes with it. And I think it's just such a tremendous study. If you haven't done it, I highly recommend looking at the adoption series. It's such an amazing calling because it's exactly the commission for us in our lives. Everywhere the soul of our foot treads in this Bible, everywhere the soul of our foot treads in the message is, excuse me, it's ours. &gt;&gt; 100% ours. &gt;&gt; The devil wants us to put it off and say, "Well, that was in the 60s and that was the commission of the prophet. It was a prophetic office, etc., etc., etc." But that's not true. &gt;&gt; It was food stored up for a purpose. It was food stored up for a people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua, he had a calling. Every place the sole of your foot. There shall not be any man able to stand. And we talked about this when we studied this. Don't don't think about it. Just Joshua going into the promised land. It's the same promise for uh Israel today though. &gt;&gt; Exactly the same promise. It's still fully in force. Their minds were blinded for our sake. And even till this day their minds are blinded to to the word of the Lord of Jesus talking about Jesus. But you know Joshua was told there shall not be any man able to stand against you if you follow my word if you follow my will. And remember right after they got into the land they actually took out Jericho. And as they were going forwards something happened. 16 men lost their lives. And brother Brandham says it very clearly in the adoption series. He said, "Wait a minute. The promise wasn't that, you know, we're going to win most of the battles and there might be some casualties along the way." No, no. The promise was that everywhere the soul of your foot treads is yours and not one man shall be able to stand before you as long as you are in this promised land. &gt;&gt; So when that happened, Achen, he wanted the garment. He wanted to look like the world. He saw the riches. He went after the wedge of gold, didn't he? He took it home and he hid both of them. And 16 men lost their lives. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Joshua said, "Wait a second. Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Let's call a fast. &gt;&gt; We've got to search through our camp. There's sin in the land. Something's wrong." &gt;&gt; And I think we ought to maybe take heed to that once in a while and think about it. When we have problems that rise up in our lives, perhaps maybe it's not just someone else's problem. &gt;&gt; Perhaps, brothers and sisters, it's our problem. &gt;&gt; As a body of believers, &gt;&gt; if we all want to see the profit of the gifts in the body, perhaps we all want to offer the profit of the unity in the body to come together in prayer and maybe fasting. We know there was a time where there was someone that had an autistic child. The disciples were already given full power to go and cast out devils and raise the dead and heal the sick and so on and so forth. And they did. But one man brought their child and said, "You know what? Your your your disciples, they can't help my child." And Jesus said, "Oh, he of little faith. You know what? Your child is well." &gt;&gt; Just like that. He didn't preach a sermon. He didn't do anything. and and they the man came and and and was amazed that that happened. And the disciples came to him afterwards and said, "Rabbi, why is it that that happened?" And he said, "Because of your faith." &gt;&gt; Because of your faith. But this kind only goes out one way. &gt;&gt; One way. And that's by extra effort. So if we have a problem in the body, brothers and sisters, are we willing TO COME TOGETHER AS A BODY AND GIVE EXTRA effort &gt;&gt; or are we busy? &gt;&gt; We're just busy. You know, we got a job, we got a career, we've got all these different things and you know, Wednesdays and Sundays, that's what we do. And you know, it's pretty good. Most people only go Sundays. So where are we at? What are we doing? I I think it really behooves us to think about that. If there's a problem, maybe we should come together as a body and look at it &gt;&gt; like Joshua did. &gt;&gt; Let's call a fast &gt;&gt; and not let the devil have the ability to run roughshot over one of our brothers or sisters. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But Joshua, he was given these these commandments just so beautiful. We know the story of Joshua very well. There shall not be any man able to stand. Be strong and of a good courage. Don't be afraid when these things come your way. They're going to come. The enemy is going to come rushing in just like a flood. But what's going to happen? The spirit of God is going to raise a standard against that devil. &gt;&gt; And he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And and when we go over to the other side, we're going to be able to quote that scripture and we're going to be able to understand that that standard isn't William Marryiam Brham. &gt;&gt; That standard is you, brothers and sisters. That standard is that spirit, that holy spirit that's within each and every one of us when we just give it room to work its way out. And the only way we can work give it room to work its way out is to live a holy life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to actually worship. We've got to be able to worship. We'll get into that maybe a little bit later. But tonight, I want to talk about the the the oh my the working of miracles and how incredible it is to look at all of these believers in the Bible. And I believe they're there not just to look back at as a as a historical account from a biblical perspective. They're there for a purpose to show us that this is how God operates. The way that we think he should operate is exactly opposite to the way he thinks. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily all the time, but I'm saying that for a purpose. I want to draw a contrast because he says that your ways are are not my ways. &gt;&gt; Neither are your thoughts my thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they're maybe not opposite, but they're not the same. He sees things in a different light. And it's so beautiful if we can just recognize that we just need to be strong and of a good courage, just like this man Joshua, the calling that he had. I got into a scripture today in Judges, you know, going a little further in in talking about the working of miracles. And there was a man in the book of Judges. There's a few of them and a woman, not just a man, not just men, but the story of Gideon out of Judges 6:13, it says, "And Gideon said unto him, when the angel of the Lord came to him, oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?" &gt;&gt; One day we're going to get into the study of the book of Judges. It's a question, a literal question that came in and we're going to we're going to get into it. But it it's interesting that Gideon would have an angel of the Lord come and visit him and he would actually address the angel in such a way. He said, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?" &gt;&gt; What did they do? They didn't listen to the last prophet. That's what happened. &gt;&gt; That could summarize the whole book of Judges. They did not take heed to Joshua's last sermon. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But then to be able to say to the Lord, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, then why is all this befallen us?" I wonder if Gideon actually heard Joshua's last address. I don't know. I don't know if anybody does. Does anybody know that? Was he there? Did he hear what the prophet said, that prophetic utterance? Did they actually write it down? Did they have books and tapes that they could listen to so that they knew? Did the parents teach what Joshua actually said to the parent the the children? Did the parents teach the children the way they should go with it? Here he is asking this question and it's a fair question. If we have the God of heaven, if there is a mighty Jehovah, then why has all this befallen us? Why are we slaves now to the enemies? I thought we're in the promised land. For some reason, he knew that this shouldn't be this way. So why was he asking it? I think it's interesting. He goes on to say, "And where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?" So clearly he understood. &gt;&gt; Someone taught him that there was a Lord, that there was miracles, that there was something different than what he was experiencing. But now the Lord hath forsaken us. Can you imagine saying that to the angel of the Lord and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites? And if you go on in the story, I think it's so beautiful because he he talks about how he he lays out the the fleece. We know the story all too well. And and he does it one way and then he does it the other way and says if it you know if this is the way it should be then it'll it'll be this way and that's exactly the way it was. And we know many times people put out spiritual fleces in in their own lives. And sometimes it's worthwhile to do that just to see where we stand. But to think about Gideon and how he actually went forward and was so successful, how he did a mighty work. The Lord did a mighty work through Gideon to help the people of Israel. But still, they couldn't actually get out of that rut they were in. There was this this this rut that they got themselves into, and they just couldn't get out of it. But God &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy will just not leave his children forsaken. He will not leave them neither will he forsake them. And all through this you hear about the different stories of people. Shamgar Shamgar brother Brandham talks about this guy. He's mentioned once in the scripture. But here this guy is living his life doing the best that he can in the circumstances that he's given. And here he brother Brandham talks about he hears the Philistines marching down the road once again. They're coming in to pillage the harvest. All of their hard work that will keep them through the winter. Now, the Philistines are coming in and they're going to take it. They're going to steal all of their provisions, all of their proender for the next winter. &gt;&gt; But Shamgar, brother Brandham tells the story so good. He he starts thinking about it as he hears them coming and something happens. And this guy, he just simply accepts the way the word says it. And he grabs an ox goat, which is not a very big thing. It's about this big. And what does he do? He knocks out 600 Philistines. Says, "Not this time." &gt;&gt; Talk about the working of miracles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just pushing aside all of our reasoning and understanding and saying, "Lord, just be it unto me according to your word. Your word says this. Now, I claim it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't want to live this way. I don't want to experience the things that I'm having to experience. I believe there's more." And you know what? If we ask him with all sincerity about that in our lives, if there is more, if there's a deep calling, there's got to be a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; Show me, Lord, what you want from me and I will do it. &gt;&gt; If we're willing to do that, he will show us. Don't think for a second he won't show us. He will. Samson. We know that Samson, the story of Samson in in the book of Judges, a thousand Philistines. He's out marching in the desert one day, touring along, doing his thing, and gets cornered by a thousand Philistine soldiers. &gt;&gt; Could you even visualize it? Could you even imagine what that would be like with shields and helmets up to an inch thick, Brother Brandham talks about, and spears, maybe bows and arrows, swords, and here you are just out in the desert. And what happens is you look down and you see the jawbone of a mule, something that's sunbleached. Has anybody here ever picked up old bones? Old sunbleleached bones? If you've ever done it, if you've never done it, if you pick them up, sometimes they'll break. picking them up. If you take them and you hit them against something, they'll probably shatter. &gt;&gt; But to think about a jawbone of a mule smashing one inch thick brass helmets &gt;&gt; of Philistines. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The working of miracles. &gt;&gt; This is the same God that we serve. &gt;&gt; This was not Phil. This was not Samson. This was not Shamgar. This was not Moses. This was the God of all of those men. And that's the God that we serve tonight. And that same God is right here in our midst because we declared this meeting to be in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To think about this. A thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a mule smashing inch thick brass helmets &gt;&gt; dealing with all of those people. Could you I just one day I hope I can see what that actually looked like. Maybe there's a jumbotron somewhere where we could say, "Lord, could you just show us what what did that actually look like? A thousand soldiers taken out with the jawbone of a mule. How how could that poss? It just doesn't even make sense. You can't even rationally think about that. But you know the beautiful part about it? This is the God we serve, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HE DID ALL of that and THEN HE SAID, "I THIRST. &gt;&gt; I'M THIRSTY." &gt;&gt; And what did God do? gave him a drink. &gt;&gt; He knows our every need. &gt;&gt; He's concerned about our condition. &gt;&gt; He's not just going to leave us or forsake us. But, you know, that was just a few from from the Old Testament that I wanted to bring out and and it looks like we're still good for a little bit of time, but let's get into the New Testament and talk about the working of miracles. It's for a purpose. It's so that we can see that God wants to express himself to the church &gt;&gt; and through the church. So, we shouldn't be afraid of miracles. We shouldn't be afraid of of the gift of healing. We shouldn't be afraid of knowledge or wisdom in our lives, the speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues. These are the nine spiritual gifts. We should be just fine seeing them in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like asking the Lord to answer our prayer AND THEN BEING SURPRISED THAT HE ANSWERED IT. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES HE SAY? WE SHOULD BE MORE SURPRISED WHEN HE DOESN'T ANSWER our prayer than when he does. talk about the New Testament. It opens up in in Canaan of Galilee. The first miracle mentioned in the New Testament, John 2:1, this beginning of miracles did Jesus in Canaa of Galilee and manifested forth his glory. manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that we're not just looking back historically, brothers and sisters. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. This very same Jesus, &gt;&gt; this Jesus is the one that was there with Samson. &gt;&gt; This Jesus was there when he said, "Lord, I know I sinned against you. Just one more time, let me stand for you. One more time, let me stand for your word. One more time, let me bring glory unto your name. And pushed over the pillars of the temple. And we know that's one of the most famous stories of this Samson. The same Jesus was there with him. &gt;&gt; Amazing to think about that, isn't it? And we know that in that story, in that one story, that one action, he took out more Philistines than he did in all of his life. &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that same Jesus that's here tonight, that same Jesus that was there in Canaan of Galilee, that same Jesus that was there with Moses in the burning bush, he was with Abraham, he was with Sarah, that same Jesus is here tonight. &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2, that same Jesus. &gt;&gt; And now I isn't it beautiful how he just changes the masks. Brother Brandham in this age, he talks about Morphe &gt;&gt; and Kinosis &gt;&gt; and Morphe. He just changes his mask. The same actor in the play, but just has a different mask. He goes from being Elohim, the self-existing one, to becoming God and to going from God to becoming Jehovah &gt;&gt; to the people and then going from Jehovah into Jesus &gt;&gt; and Jesus into the Holy Ghost. But Peter on the day of Pentecost with the Holy Ghost and Morphe. Acts 2 22. Ye men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and by wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know. Peter was the one that was anointed to preach that sermon after they came out of the upper room. And we know, brothers and sisters, they stumbled like they were drunk. They literally thought they were drunk. So I think if we are in the presence of the Lord and and we might act a little bit differently, don't look around, just look up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what anyone is doing. Don't worry about what's actually taking place. Just worship God and see if he won't move in our lives in our midst. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 6, someone else, the working of miracles. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about all these people, brothers and sisters, not so that we can think about them and the ideology of how wonderful it must have been to be them and and truly it must be. But what about you? THIS IS THE same God we're talking about. This is the same message we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take Steven's name out of there. And William full of faith and power. And Henry full of faith and power. And Paul full of faith and power. And Stella full of faith and power. And Rosanna full of faith and power. Every one of us full of faith and power. did great wonders and miracles amongst the people. &gt;&gt; We know that in the end times, the message that we have, the word for our day is the people will know their gods and they shall do great exploits. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our commission, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; to be that manifestation of the Holy Ghost. That little tiny venue where he can just work his way out in our life, where he can work his way out in our life, in our jobs, where he can work his way out in our life, in our homes, in our marriages. He can work his way out in our services. If there was one place, brothers and sisters, where he ought to be able to work his way out, it is right here, right now in the house of the Lord. It's such a wonderful thing. Paul and Barnabas in Acts 15:12, then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. So, where are you tonight? Where are we tonight, brothers and sisters? Maybe we haven't seen great miracles, mighty signs, and wonders. Maybe we have a gift of wisdom. And it's a quiet gift. &gt;&gt; And when we hear conversations, we can actually pick up on nuances. &gt;&gt; And we've often wondered, why did I think that thought from that conversation? Don't don't underestimate that gift. We're not necessarily talking about seeing the mighty signs and wonders. We're talking about all the nine spiritual gifts. All of them are in the in this body, Calgary Living Word Assembly, to profit all of us with all. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. So tonight as we time just starts going right when you start having fun. My goodness. You know, I want to talk about you. That's what I want to talk about tonight. I want to encourage us tonight. &gt;&gt; And you know, as I was going through and studying this, even as I preach it now, it's encouraging me. Galatians chapter 3 to think about the miracles, the working of miracles. It's not just for a historical account. He is either the same yesterday, today, and forever. Or he's not. &gt;&gt; There's no middle ground. There's no saying, "Well, sometimes maybe if I get enough faith, IT'S IRRELEVANT. WHAT WE GOT, it's all about him." HE IS that one. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Whether we can believe it or understand it is irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Amen. Galatians 3:5, "He therefore that ministerth to you, the spirit, &gt;&gt; and workketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith." &gt;&gt; So going back to what brother Brandham said earlier, when we want to talk about healing in our bodies, I believe seeing healing in our bodies, it is a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is miraculous when we can see that. But you know, brother Bradom talks about the greatest miracle of all. And we know what that is. That's that a sinner can be a saint. &gt;&gt; That's that someone who is completely lost without hope with no direction, drifting a drift in life suddenly can hear the word of God and go from being a skunk in this world to being a saved son of God and recognizing his position in the kingdom of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And how does that come? Does it come by the law? Does it come by legalism? &gt;&gt; Does it come by everything being just exactly according to the message of the hour and the word of God? And if it's not, then we're a sinner. Or is it coming and just being our our imperfect selves and saying, "Just be it unto me according to thy word, Lord." Do we have the the publicans approach or or the Pharisees approach? Where who do we stand? Where do we stand, brothers and sisters, when we come to church to worship? Are are we saying, "I'm so glad I'm not like those people out there. Oh my, I'm so thankful that I can come and worship you." Or do we say, "I recognize my imperfection, and that's the way YOU MADE ME. AND I JUST WANT TO WORSHIP YOU WITH ALL THAT I AM. AND I DON'T CARE WHO'S LOOKING AT ME. I DON'T CARE WHO HEARS ME. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE GLORY THAT YOU REQUIRE OF ME." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I think when we get to that level, that's where we're going to see these gifts really manifest in our lives. When we can just let our hair down and be imperfect. It doesn't matter about what man thinks. It only matters about what God sees. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's a beautiful thing when we talk about this the the working of miracles and to see the progression of miracles in the Bible, isn't it? Just to maybe do a little summary of what we've talked about tonight. We know that. But even before God was an object of worship because that's what he was. One of the things that William Brandham brought out that nobody else is talking about in this world is that God, he wasn't always God. He was a self-existing one. He was Elohim. But he desired certain things. He had attributes that he wanted to express. So he created himself into a form of God so that he could actually be worshiped. We know he created the whole heavens. He created the whole earth. He created the whole universe. Did it take six days? Did it take 6,000 years? Who knows? We can't explain it. We just simply said that he said it and he said that it was good when he did it. &gt;&gt; But the progression of of the miracles in the Bible to think that God would be able to do that is miraculous. &gt;&gt; He could become an object of worship. He could create angels. He could create THIS UNIVERSE. HE COULD PUT everything in orbit in this universe to be just so perfectly balanced. &gt;&gt; Then it came to the place where he wanted to express himself to a people. &gt;&gt; But first, he had to have an environment for those people to be in. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning, God, &gt;&gt; he said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when did that happen? How long did it happen? How long did it take for it to come to pass? We don't know. We can't say. But in the beginning, God and then Adam and then prophet and then Jesus and then disciples. Remember, servants, but then friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The progression of the working of miracles, then the gentile church, then the bride, and then now the wife. Where are we tonight, brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; Some of us are still actually a bride. Some of us are still actually in that engagement phase. And some of us are a seasoned wife, &gt;&gt; but we're all just waiting for the marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about. We're still just ripening in the sun. That's all we're called to do is just ripen in the sun. But let's recognize that these gifts are for us while we're here. &gt;&gt; They're not for us when we get over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about it. Sometimes people say that healing is going to be in the millennium. We're not going to need healing in the millennium. We're going TO HAVE A NEW BODY IN THE MILLENNIUM. &gt;&gt; WE NEED HEALING NOW. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BOY, &gt;&gt; you know, talking about the biblical refer references of the of of miracles in uh there's two two versions that I wanted to talk about. One is the Old Testament and one is in the New Testament. And uh one in the Old Testament is uh it's it's in the sense of con conspicuousness [snorts] a miracle by implication a token or omen miracle sign and wonder and you know out of the New Testament it's it's of a presumed derivative of base of 459 an indication especially ceremonially ceremonially or supernaturally I love how it changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament ceremonial or supernaturally a miracle sign token or a wonder and and you know we have the token in our life when we have the Holy Ghost in our life when we followed the word for our day when we recognize that we need to be baptized according to Acts 2:38. The promise is unto you. &gt;&gt; The promise is unto me. The promise is unto us, even as many that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God should call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we have the desire to be baptized in water, then surely to goodness, there's a promise of that baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And when we have that baptism of the Holy Ghost, brothers and sisters, let's not hinder that spirit, excuse me, from moving in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. out of the Sardisian church age in 1960. Maybe I'll call the musicians as we close here. Out of the Sardisian church age in 1960, it's message 1209. Paul was the one who constrained them to be rebaptized if they hadn't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Come and be baptized over again in order to receive the Holy Ghost. Acts 19:5. He was also the one that laid hands on the people and gifts and set the church in order with the working of miracles, divine healing, gifts of tongues, interpretation of tongues. Is that right, brothers and sisters? This is what we've been called back to. this original church. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I really wanted to get into preaching tonight and I don't think I did, but you know, through the restoration of the church, I'll say it that way. The restoration of the church, being brought back to that original Pentecostal church, it is exactly the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is exactly what was prophesied for the day in which we live. that prophetic utterance out of Malachi 4:5 and 6, he'll do two things. And that one thing that we can rejoice about is that he has turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; And what that is is believing that he is the same yesterday, today. He's not a historical god and he's not a futuristic god. Even though he's both of those, but he's more God in the present than he's either one of those. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when Moses said, "Who should I tell them sent me?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Tell them I am." &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; And he's here tonight, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I am is here tonight. &gt;&gt; He was also the one that laid hands on the people and gifts and set the church in order with the working of miracles, divine healing, gifts of tongues, interpretation of tongues. Is that right? 1 Corinthians 12. See what Paul said? 1 Corinthians 12 and you'll find it. He set in the church. God set in the church these great gifts and Paul set them in order &gt;&gt; and put them in order so they could work for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we see them happening, brothers and sisters, they're not going to be working for the glory of the devil. &gt;&gt; They can't. Not in the church of the living God. They're going to be working for the glory of God. [music] If these gifts manifest, rather when these gifts manifest, [music] they're working for the glory of God. We don't need to be afraid. Paul said that then if any man no matter what denomination he belongs to tries to tell you that the days of speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, divine healing and miracles and the witness of the Holy Ghost as the baptism, let him be accursed. And we know that the scripture says that if [music] an angel, any man or an angel comes and tells you anything other than what we've already [music] said, let him be a curse. But brother Bradam makes it so crystal clear that if anybody says that any one of these [music] gifts are not in operation, let him be accursed. It's like taking a magnifying glass to the word of God. It's reading exactly between the lines. This is what we've been called back to in the day in which we live. It's so beautiful. For the same spirit that was upon Paul will be the same spirit that was sent to the next church age. the same to the next church age and [music] the same on down unto the end of the church age. The same spirit, the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. May stand with me as we close. Brothers and sisters, I [music] just want to say, expect the miraculous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Expect the miraculous. &gt;&gt; And and more to that, you are the miraculous. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you have the ability to believe this word. &gt;&gt; And out of eight 8 and a2 billion people in this earth right now, so few people have the ability to believe [music] it. And then they'll say that you're a fanatic and a holy ruler. We just believe what Paul believed. We just believe [music] what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; Expect the miraculous. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you. We thank you for your word, Lord. We thank you that you can, Lord Jesus, manifest yourself to us [music] and through us, Lord. Father, we pray that tonight, Lord, you would help us to just surrender ourselves more to you because we know that's the only way that can happen. And Father, maybe some of us have had our eagle eyes filmed over. And if we have, Lord, we pray that you would [music] just, Lord Jesus, send us some of that bomb in Gilead. Father, let us not go seeking a remedy from the the the gods of Baal. Oh, Father, let us seek that that bomb that you have provided for us, Lord Jesus. Just like your prophet talked about that grease that could be applied. Help us to take that bomb of your Holy Spirit and put it on our spiritual eyes, Lord. Father, that we would recognize the words that we're speaking, the words that we're hearing, Father, [music] that they're more than life to us because they're your words, Lord. Father, we pray that you would just bless each one tonight who's made the effort to fight their way through their lives to get to service, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, that they could bring their lick of fire together to worship you, Lord. Bless them abundantly, Father, above all they could ask or think. Father, we pray that you would be with those who couldn't be here tonight. Father, wherever they are, whatever they're doing or going through, Father, we pray that you would just bless them with a special measure of your grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we know you're not bound by time or space. [music] So, we just ask that you would bless them abundantly. Father, even those that might just stream it later, that tune in afterwards, Father, bless them as well. We know that you are that kind of God. And we thank you for that, Lord. Lord Jesus, now we pray that you would just be glorified with a couple of songs before we go back to our lives, Lord. And as we do go back to our lives, Father, as we do travel, help us to consider the many mighty miracles that you do in our lives, Lord. So many times maybe we don't even recognize them, Father. Help us to give you the praise and glory and honor that you desire. [music] Help us to perceive it, Lord Jesus. How many times you help us in our lives along the way. And Father, as we as we go through our week, Lord, let us pray without ceasing. Let us thank you, Father, for the good work that you've done in our lives, Lord. And if it's your will for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord, we will bring a song of praise, Lord. [music] We'll bring a shout in our heart, Lord Jesus. We'll bring that little lick of fire that you have placed inside us, Father, and just allow it to work its way out, Father. Lord Jesus, giving you glory. We love you, Father, and we thank you for the many gifts that you have placed in the body. We just ask all these things now. [music] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we [music] sing that song? All in all. All in all. You are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I seek. You are my all in [singing] all. Seeking you as a precious jewel. I want the Holy Ghost [singing] to rule. You are my all in [music and singing] all. Jesus, [singing and music] lamb of God, worthy [singing] your name. Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name. [music] Taking my sin, taking [singing and music] my sin, my cross, my shame. Rising again. I bless [music] your name. Lord, you are my all.

[music] Jesus [music] lamb of God [music] worthy is your name. Taking my sin. [music] Amen. Thank you Lord. Taking my sin, my [singing] cross, my shame. Rising again. I bless [music] your name. Lord, you are my all. [singing] [music] When I fall down, [singing] you lift [music] me up. When I am dry, fill my cup. [music] You are my all. [singing] [music] Hallelujah [singing] Jesus. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus, Lamb of [music and singing] God, worthy is [music and singing] your name. Let's sing that chorus. Just our voice tonight.

Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can we sing? You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory and the honor and the praise. &gt;&gt; You deserve the [singing and music] glory and the [singing and music] honor. That's why we're here tonight. We lift our hands [singing and music] to worship. As we praise your holy name, [music and singing] you deserve the glory. Head each knee tonight, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; and the honor. [music] Lord, we [singing] lift our hands [music] to worship you as we praise [singing] your holy name. You are [music] great. You do [music and singing] great. There is [singing] no one [music] else like you. There [music and singing] is no one else like you. You are great. [music and singing] [singing] [music] like you. There [singing] is [music] no one else like [music and singing] you. &gt;&gt; Can we sing? How great is our God? How great is our God? The splendor of the King that's right here [music] tonight. the splend of my king. Oh, in majesty. Let all the earth rejoice. [singing] All the earth rejoice.
