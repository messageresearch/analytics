some notes on it are you happy to be here tonight certainly thankful to be in the presence of the Lord the body of believer I just had uh one prayer request that I wanted to bring and it was for the Saints in Jamaica there was a prayer request that went out thank you brother Emanuel prayer request that went out on uh one of the threads it was for the Saints in Jamaica that hurricane was on a collision course a category 5 hurricane for a an island with zero protection and the Hand of the Lord changed the direction of that hurricane so we can take the request and turn it into praise tonight if you have a need maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that we can gather together one more time in Your Name Lord Jesus father Lord knowing that this is the way that you've ordained for us in our day and Lord there's some people that are are are afraid to actually accept the way that you have ordained there's some people that want to try and find their own way and there's others Lord Jesus that just accept it the way that you've given it father and Lord we thank you for the way that you've given it Lord Jesus father we thank you for the desire to serve you we don't take that for granted father and Lord Jesus tonight we just want to thank you for directing that storm Lord Jesus oh Father we know there was a time where you came down and you met with Abram and father you told him that you were about to bring destruction to those cities and that man he interceded for the the Believers in that City and father we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever and in a a country Lord Lord probably not much different than our own father in in terms of sinful nature father for the sake of the Believers you would change the course of that storm father of that judgment we thank you for that Lord Jesus we pray that Lord the Saints there would just be encouraged father and each one who has taken of their time to pray Lord we pray that you would just allow them to be encouraged also now tonight father as a body of Believers here we just want to commit each need made known unto you tonight by way of an uplift hand father that you would meet that need sovereignly father that you would Lord just allow your blessing to fall in that life and father those needs that maybe weren't made known unto you tonight T Lord we pray that you would just allow them Father to be met as well we know that you are a living God and we thank you for revealing yourself to us in this day Lord we just ask now that you would take us by the hand Lord Jesus and lead us into your Promised Land father as we walk through your word tonight we pray that you would just break it open to us fresh once again Lord Jesus we just invite you to come down just like in the beginning Lord in the cool of the evening and just fellowship with us father as we walk with you a little further along the way we love you Lord and we thank you and we just Commit This service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I want to carry on with our study and the exposition of the seven Church ages I want to read from Revelations chapter 2 chapter 2 verse2 amen we're in the pergami and church age and the word tonight is to the the church in pergamus Revelations 2:12 it says and to the angel of the church in pergamus WR these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and H has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught bailo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen let's just turn over to St John chapter 15 many verses in here I'd like to read but for time's sake we'll just read verse 7 amen of St John chapter 15 very familiar scripture but I believe the more we read it the more it becomes revealed to us if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what what you will and it shall be done unto you amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father tonight Lord Jesus my desire is that Lord your words would abide in us and father we know that your will is your word and father the Bible in entirely is your word and the message of the hour Lord Jesus is a is a an expounding of your word a magnification of your word a tying up of all the Loose Ends the Mysteries being revealed in your word but father we know there's something in this word that we've read tonight father that says not word but words a plurality and father tonight I pray that your words would be in the mouths and hearts of all of your children here tonight father that Lord Jesus you would have control of Our Lives that you would have control of our minds Lord that you would have control of our mouths Lord Jesus that you would have control of our arms and our feet Lord Jesus father that we could surrender ourselves entirely unto you father Lord Jesus that you would abide within we just commit each life into your hands now we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated welcome welcome certainly excited to be here tonight um we uh just have a few announcements before we go we're going to leave tonight we're flying to um Ohio we leave after service directly after service so if we don't stop and uh chat please don't take it personally we just have a timeline we need to keep to catch our flight so excuse me we will leave uh actually early tomorrow morning the flight is at 12:30 um and we return turn on Wednesday the 10th and I think it's in the evening or late afternoon but we'll see what the Lord has in store uh we have a prayer meeting coming up on the 4th and uh we have brother Toby o Den noo he will take the service on the 10th on the 7eventh sorry brother Emanuel will be taking the service on the 10th in our stad and uh if we get back in time we'll certainly be here that will be next Wednesday but uh we'll see what the Lord has in store as we've mentioned and then on the 14th we have brother toono OD denovo we're certainly excited to be in service with him and on the 21st we have the youth uh event at the Clon at the Clawson residence after service so uh quickly just getting into our scripture tonight I think it's just a beautiful thing if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you and you know when we have his spirit in US brothers and sisters we can ask whatever we will and we'll never ask a Miss we don't need to worry about asking incorrectly and that's why it's so important to have his Spirit leading and guiding us we want to make sure that uh we actually have his Spirit that's the only Spirit that's the only thing that will help us in the day in which we live I just wanted to ask did Sister Amy make it to service tonight you're here God bless you Sister Sister Amy is here from Halifax and uh she's living in Calgary now and wanted to be in service so God bless you Sister I'm so glad you could make it to fellowship with us tonight I trust you feel right at home um I I got uh looking at the uh the placemark where we left off last time and I just thought my goodness this is so rich it's so good I have just about all of the pages highlighted in my book here and I just I think it's such a wonderful thing this part where we stopped in the pergami and church age is probably I would say one of the most profound parts of the message of the hour brother Brandon preached the uh seals uh sorry he preached the church ages in 1960 and uh you know I don't think he changed a lot there was some grammar isation that happened there was some probably editing and and polishing maybe but the same thoughts apply in the exposition of the seven Church ages that was released in 1965 I think it was the book was it was being published all the way up until then but released in 1965 and uh you know some would say that brother L Veil uh it was his book and others would say well he did a bunch of it and and brother bradam did a bunch of it but this was the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to a Vindicated Prophet that's what this book was and I think that's what we all believe and if it's not I truly hope it is what we will believe because uh this isn't uh about a Teaching Ministry we know that Jesus said go ye into all the world world and preach the gospel not teach the gospel Teaching Ministry brother bradam says it an adoption is what actually positionally places Us in the promised land it gives us the ability to go from being saved to recognizing who we are there's no doing away with the Teaching Ministry but the Teaching Ministry is not what we're after we're after the Vindicated prophet's message the tying up of all the Loose Ends and that's really what I'm getting at the five-fold ministry is a vital component it's the only way in the day which we live for the Saints to be perfected just playing tapes is not enough Ephesians 4 is enough where we left off last time uh in my book is Page 188 uh paragraph 55 of the pgam and church age I'm just going to go back a little bit and and try and refresh it's been so long since we were uh doing this I trust that we could just sort of pick up and and capture the thought tonight brother bradam he said now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God it's such a beautiful thing it just it just it just dovetails it just meshes it's just a hand to a glove for what we've been studying I just love it Lamentations 3:37 is is who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not he says there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God and the word amen they are one but we know that's the trick of the devil to get right in the middle middle of the church right into the framework of the Christian church and try and defile it and cause it to become lukewarm and Powerless simply by changing that one thought separation of those well maybe the word isn't exactly inspired by God maybe it's not exactly God in print form maybe it's just not exactly when we start to do that brothers and sisters what we do is we fall for the trick of the devil the Trap Of The Devil to try and separate them as soon as we do that then we find ourselves in that position we don't want to be there carrying on 57 now then this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled life I think that's just I don't know my he said that his word was life John 663b but that is exactly what he is I am the way the truth and the life John 14:6 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his Romans 89b there it is he is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word amen so when a spirit born spirit filled man I'm going to say or woman in faith takes the word in his heart and places it upon his lips or her lips why that is the same as deity speaking amen but if you take the trick of the devil and you start to dissect and say well the word maybe it's not all the way God maybe that interpretation maybe this maybe that that's why I say brothers and sisters why would anybody want to try and accept a different version of the Bible than what the Vindicated Prophet taught from some people do they truly want to do something different than that it doesn't make any sense God tied up all the loose ends in the Bible through the King James version so if we can have faith in that that God sent a prophet we could have faith that God sent that Prophet with a word fitly spoken for our day so we could take that King James version bring it into our our our lives and take it by faith when we take that by faith and we begin to speak that word we have a Vindicated Prophet speaking these words but it goes further than that that's God speaking through that Prophet to a people saying why that's the same as me speaking and what that speaks to brothers and sisters this is where it gets real good this speaks to adoption you're not just becoming a child you're not just becoming a son or a daughter you always were but you're just coming into your position now where you have not only the checkbook but you have all of the bank account to back it up and whatever you say goes that is such a powerful thought when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that's the same as deity speaking I think that's so beautiful if we are willing to just simply follow the word of God follow the word of God given to us by a Vindicated Prophet every single letter of it not be willing to try and dissect it and just kick out the devil when he comes around and tries to get us to dissect it and say well I think it should be this way I want to do it that way whatever the tradition is the other way when we're willing to push all of that aside and say just be it unto me just like Mary according to Thy word Angel messenger said this is the instruction hey I'll take that instruction and I'll take it by faith amen and I'll begin to live it by faith then when I speak God speaks amen but you know we're not going to do it with our spirit when he's talking about Spirit born and spirit filled there's many spirits in the world and there's a lot of religious spirits in the world and when we try to use a religious spirit to speak the word of God and activate God by faith brothers and sisters we're not going to get the right results but remember It's Tricky because Satan can impersonate any gift H and Satan's really religious he's the most religious of them all isn't he fundamental is what we heard last Wednesday fundamentalist Cain his son was fundamental he knew how to worship he went to the same church but he didn't have the right Spirit he could never have the right spirit because he was of his father the devil but boy when we're willing to just say Amen to the word and and and become Holy Spirit born holy spirit filled according to the message of the hour in our day brothers and sisters just go forwards you're going to push back all the devils in front of you Satan doesn't even have a foothold to stand on when a person comes to that place am brother Bram says it here every Mountain has to go I just love the next sentence Satan cannot stand before that man not just brother Barry saying it Satan cannot stand before that woman Satan cannot stand before that child when you take a little child that's willing to take the word that God gave to this age through a Vindicated Prophet where that little child says Amen to that word gets that inspiration gets baptized receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit still lives in the flesh still makes mistakes still gets in trouble by parents still gets scolded but that doesn't change the fact that they take the entire word and make that their absolute in their life and sometimes even preach to Mommy and Daddy when that child speaks brothers and sisters it's the same as God speaking and you know what Satan cannot stand before that child Satan cannot stand before that husband or that wife ever who it is Satan cannot stand before that man isn't that wonderful to think about brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost when you speak God speaks if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages can you believe that and right today when the church returns to the word in faith doesn't return to to to a Creed doesn't return to a Dogma doesn't return to an assembly doesn't return to a tradition when the when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in our midst again it's the word first brothers and sisters let everything else go second third forth first is the word first is the word now we're going to begin one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasp the pen to write see this is real good now at this point at this particular point when we read this when we hear this we've got the opportunity to say Amen that man was inspired by the Holy Ghost himself Jesus Christ what some people would consider to be one part of the Trinity one of those people it was either God or it was just a man and right here when you read these words when you hear these words spoken you've got that that that opportunity to accept it or to reject it right amen one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and right I know every one of us here believes this with all their heart don't get me wrong this just gets me excited because I think it's so good there could be somebody that's never heard this before and I think it's important for them to to realize it he says as I grasp the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church and I just think goodness sakes if there was a prophet in the land wouldn't you want to hear what that message is wow his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you he could have just said I got it I got that message and you know be the odd person I'll led into my inner circle a and we'll have a club it'll just be the exclusive ones we we'll be the the exclusive Brethren I'm sorry if somebody is the exclusive Brethren there is actually a denomination called that but you know I I heard a brother say that one time I I was raised in the exclusive breth and I said well isn't that us is isn't that what who who we are I thought we were says I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the brother there's nobody exclusive and a prophet of God wants to bring it to his bride he doesn't want to keep it for himself he wants to Simply do the introduction just like Ellie eer did with Isaac and Rebecca so he brings it here's what I'm trying to say to you now this is in yeah italicized go back a little bit can you go back a little bit yes so you can see that it goes into a italicized words it's for a reason and that reason is somebody else is being quoted here this is not just William Mary and bradam saying these words this is not this is where it changes gears brothers and sisters this is where it makes my hair stand up on end when I look at this here is what I am trying to say to you to me that says volumes right there here's what I am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit yielding tree tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so now we go on with this in the italicized words knowing that this is not just William Mary and Bram speaking here this is the Holy Ghost speaking to his bride through William Mary and bradam now there's a group of people that will say Amen to this word I accept it unequivocally all of it and there's other people that will say well I'll take some of it and I'll leave some of it and and brother Bram talks about those people a little further down when we get going in here but isn't it wonderful to think that this is not just a speaking this this is not just some strange random Spirit coming around and maybe just anointing him with a little bit of religiosity uh this is the Holy Ghost this is God himself in spirit form coming down and ministering this so that we could hear it I I think this is just fascinating paragraph 61 he says whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into fruit now I just want to come back and read St John 15 verse 5 maybe four maybe three let's start with St John 15 verse one if you don't mind are you able to bring that up brother Logan just for time sake we'll just bring it up here St John chapter 15 verse one what does he say Here I Am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I you as I read this brothers and sisters I hope my desire is that we would just want to abide in him and that he would abide in us the more that we would just abide in him that we would just keep falling in love with him over and over again not just sometimes it's just one and done that we would recognize this the word that we're speaking here he's talking about the tree yielding fruit after his kind going right back to the scripture saying that abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing the same bringeth forth much fruit and much fruit isn't just bringing forth fruit that we can eat and fruit maybe of the spirit that we can look around and see we got goodness and gentleness and meekness and and and and joy and longsuffering not just that brothers and sisters that we could actually see those seeds in the fruit and those seeds would actually burst and come to life when this word hits that seed it's just beautiful whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone amen brothers and sisters I still haven't done that graphic yet we still show it as the Pyramid of the stature of the perfect man but it it comes to a flat spot and then there's a space between and then there's another pyramid on top of that you know where we're at brothers and sisters I want to say this again tonight we're at one pyramid The Headstone is nearing it's not separation there I remember there's no you've heard it too there's no Mor between those two brother bradam says it I believe the Lord says it through brother bradam you look at the pyramid they made those stones so clean and so tight together there's no mortar between them you can't even fit a razor blade between those stones it's for a purpose but the pyramid wasn't capped off brother Bram talks about it in the message and the spoken word is the Original Seed if you listen to that part where he talks about pick up your pen and write he speaks about this in that message very clearly amen my that headstone brothers and sisters I believe has come down that's that's my own personal belief and I think maybe some might not believe it but something really different happened at sunset Mountain it wasn't just a an opportunity to snap a picture to say something Supernatural happen in the sky over Arizona sometime that was the headstone coming down go brother Bram goes on to say here and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him it's just so beautiful they and the bride will be so much like him they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one and this is really my heart brothers and sisters where I'm going just maybe with Ministry and everything this next sentence they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God Amen how many very manifestations of the word of the Living God do we have here tonight I I believe every single one represented here that believes that God sent a prophet that believes in this book that we're reading here that believes in this word is truly the literal manifestation of the word of the living Living God denominations cannot produce this is what this word says here denominations cannot produce this because it's wrong seed now they can have a lot of manifestation but don't look for manifestation we covered that already in this book he said away with manifestation away with experience making the plum line of our Christian experience that whether we've got the Holy Ghost in our life or not whether we see many signs and wonders whether our bank account are full whether all these different things are happening in our lives don't look at those look at your ability to say Amen to the word when it's preached because it shouldn't matter who preaches it if it's truth something inside you is going to be going amen and and we heard it we heard it uh through the fivefold ministry I believe it was four or five ministers that have come through here recently isn't it you know what the the resounding theme is say Amen to the word every time you say Amen to the word you're not amening the Minister you're amening God you're saying be it unto me according to Thy word and when we do that God blesses us denominations can't produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word they'll they'll mix it up a little bit they'll try and separate God they'll say the word is you know maybe it's just not the pure interpretation or you know Jesus maybe wasn't exactly God he was you know he he he didn't receive the spirit until a certain point and you know in another point in his life in his ministry the spirit left him so he maybe wasn't truly God you know no he was God Jesus Christ was God and he came down and and experienced the full measure of all of the pain in flesh and he did that so that he could pay the price for us so that we could be the recipients of this word in our day I just can't help but go back to it they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God just like Jesus was the very manifestation of the word of the Living God we're going to be the same way brothers and sisters he says they will produce their Creeds their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelize brings forth a hybrid product what happens when you have a hybrid product it can't reproduce the word it can reproduce itself again you can have a hybridization that will create high hybridized people hybridized Believers with hybridized worship and and they'll have hybridized experiences hybridization will be the theme and that's what will happen and everyone will be doing it but just because everyone's doing something does that make it correct it doesn't it's got to be according to the plum line the word of God you know they've even tried mongrelize in the message people have tried to bring in Psychology we'll try and hybridize the way to to make a man love his wife better and to make a wife love her husband better and to to to maybe raise children God's way to do things differently try and hybridize it with the message of the hour there ain't no hybridization with the message of the hour brothers and sisters and you know what interesting because you can take water and and oil or oil and vinegar everyone here knows about emulsification I think that's what you call it you can take it and Shake It Up and mix it up and it will actually get really mixed up there'll be lots of little bubbles you could even take a a hand mixer and just really crank on it and make it foamy frothy it'll look like it's all one but take it and just set it there for a little while give it some time and just see what happens to it because it will not mix you cannot mix it is that right brother to be so you cannot mix it he's a chemist he knows but you don't have to be a to do that you just have to make salad dressing sometime in your kitchen try and mix oil and water it doesn't work try and mix something in with the message it's been tried in the message the other thing that's happened that's so apparent we're all familiar with it is legalization to say that we do this this way and we do that that way and you're not doing it that way so we need to scold you and remind you you need to do it there our way or you're out no right get people to Christ and let Christ show them what needs to happen from the inside outen legalization it's mongrelize with the word trying to make it something else what happens in time you just leave it like that that that oil and the and the water or the oil and the vinegar in time it will actually show but you can't separate them God said don't try and separate the the wheat from the tears or or you'll mess up the wheat just let them all grow together and the word will do the separating that's why I think it's so good and I just love it whenever I hear people get upset or maybe fussy about preaching about the Holy Ghost I'm just going to preach it more because that's the only way brothers and sisters anything other than the Holy Ghost is going to be destruction in the age in which we live just like in Noah's day the only way was to get in the boat and they had how many years of that 25 years of getting the boat the old old bald fella he must have had sunstroke beating on the wood up there isn't that what the prophet said and they mocked him they laughed at him everyone in his church o only people that went in was his family and that might have been just because they felt guilty for him they felt sorry for the old guy who knows brother Bram in in this book here anyways in paragraph 62 he says the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that's why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God and we know I I think that we could take a whole entire Sermon Just on that couple of sentences right there brothers and sisters he was given a bride to reproduce himself but he was given a bride to reproduce himself with the spoken word being the Original Seed and she wanted to choose to actually go with what the devil said the devil said no no no you can do an act and you can make it happen yourself you don't have to wait for God to do it after you speak it you can just make it happen yourself you can actually be independent you can be a strong woman and and just do it your way and she took that to her husband and he realized what had already happened and the only salvation for her was for him to step out of his position as an eternal being at that point and he saved his wife but we know that Adam he was given that bride to reproduce himself and that's is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by hybridization and she caused him to die brothers and sisters in our day we're not going to die we can go and and and hybridize right and and sometimes when we hybridize religion hybridize the word hybridize our ideas in our church and and mix it and mongrelize it and make it our our way we've got a church and that's vibrant look at all the people that come and and we get more and more people and we make it so amazing because we get results people want to come and attend but if it's not according to the word it's a hybridization and what it's going to do is cause death we're going to have a church full of people that are going to say and brother Barry the rapture's gone I've been trying to text my friends and they're just gone where did you lead us to and I'll have to say destruction because we just hybridized we we made it good and we made it fun and we made it whatever it's supposed to be to keep everyone excited and coming brothers and sisters this isn't supposed to to to make us comfortable and excited to come this is supposed to correct us to bring correction to our lives so that we will actually be coming into our positions but then when we get in our positions Satan cannot stand before you but until that time he's going to do every sing single thing he can I heard somebody say and I thought it was so good this was a denominational Minister he said that the closer we get to Christ the closer we get to Christ the more sinful we are going to feel the more sinful we are going to feel the closer we get to Christ and you know I I thought it was so good because our feelings have nothing to do with it do they if we're going on a Feeling then brothers and sisters we're over it's just about done isn't it but you know we don't go by feeling we simply go by word God said it sounds like a cliche do you believe it if you do then that settles it nobody can take that away from us but the closer we get to God the closer we get to that headstone the more inadequate I believe in this flesh and these bodies we're going to feel but the more we're going to be able to say Amen to that word because that's the only thing we're going to have we're going to recognize this flesh is nothing this flesh can't stand the word of God the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God isn't that beautiful he was a spoken seed word of God and we know that he was a spoken seed word of God in Isaiah we know that he was a spoken seed word of God In the Garden of Eden we know that he was a spoken seed word of God in multiple places even right up to Mary when Gabriel the Angel messenger for that age brought her that word saying that you will have a son the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like was Adam but before he could marry her she had she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die and and this makes me real real sad this gives me a burden this makes me sigh and cry for the Abominations that we see in and around the message of the hour because there's so many people they're just on the edges they're just on the edges you can see in their lives they're not willing to apply the full word of the message of the hour it's only just a fringe event for them and and it's so sad because it's no different than this if we doubt the word of God given to us in this age by a Vindicated Prophet then brothers and sisters it's no different than every single other age if we doubt that word we will die from a little group of the true seed of the word not of a mongrelization not of a tradition not of a Creed or a Dogma the true seed of the word God isn't this just about made me do uh uh I don't know a backflip this just got me so excited and I like how brother bradam describes just having a shouting fit running around a tree just drop all your stuff and just start running around a tree because you can see it when when you can see this I think it just does something to a an individual God will present Christ with a beloved bride it's not us presenting Christ with a beloved bride amen God presents Christ with him his beloved bride all we do is say Amen to the word but God does it all if we struggle if we have faults and failures if we have things in our lives that don't add up and we just can't explain they frustrate us brothers and sisters don't look at those things look at the word of God God will present Christ with his beloved bride and if you're a beloved bride you'll just simply follow the word and if you have the ability to follow the word doesn't matter what you see in your way doesn't matter what you feel doesn't matter what you've experienced doesn't matter what you're going to experience if you have the ability to receive the word then you are that bride that God is going to present to Christ I think it's just so beautiful God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word not a virgin of his flesh not a virgin of of the church not a virgin of all of our different traditions and teachings just simply a virgin of the word just able to say be it unto me according to Thy word just like Mary I can't explain it or understand it but I believe it just be it unto me according to Thy word that's the difference she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas and I I just think sometimes we can carry man-made Creeds or dogmas a and we can drag them around with us and what happens when we do that is we try and hybridize what we're doing is we're shaking up that oil and that water or that oil and that vinegar we're trying to mix those two together and they don't work brothers and sisters and and my passion my true passion is to say that if we try and do that what happens is in the end we're going to turn people away from Christ because it's only going to be a matter of time where they're seeing us Shake It Up and we've got so much excitement and so much energy so on fire for Christ but one day they're going to see that little vial completely separated and they're going to say there's something wrong with that but when it's all him when it's all oil when all the water and all the vinegar just evaporates out brothers and sisters and it's all oil you can shake it you can mix it you can stir it you can do whatever you want and it will always remain the same won't it there's no no accident why the word talks about oil the way it did why the prophet came and actually showed that blessing to that woman with the sick son who who had no food no oil had no money in her life and the prophet was able to say go and get some vessels because I got a blessing coming your way God's got a blessing for you sister and what was it it was oil we know brother brandham says the oil and the wine out of the Book of Revelation oil represents the holy spirit and wine represents the stimulation of this Revelation my goodness from a little group of the true seed word of God God will present Christ with a beloved bride that's you she is a virgin of his word that's you she is a virgin because she knows no man man-made Creeds or dogmas that's You by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin that's a heavy statement right there but remember God is doing this God is going to present Christ with a bride it's not going to be man presenting Christ The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest my goodness God was made manifest remember he's the same yesterday today and forever there's people out there that say that you could never be God and you know what we don't go and make ourselves God he made us God I am said I am amen he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin brothers and sisters if you are a virgin to his word he will come just like he did there and fulfill his Word of Promise not a man's Word of Promise his Word of Promise in you the Virgin it was an it was an angel that brought her the message did you ever think of that it's just so beautiful it was an angel messenger that brought her the message that thing that's going to grow inside of you is going to be none other than Jesus Christ only because the power of the highest overshadowed you and oh my the power of the highest will overshadow you it will overshadow each and every one of us if we're willing to Just Surrender ourselves to him it was an angel that brought her the message and that is where she had that moment like we talked about a little earlier where we could say either this is a man talking or this is God talking she had that moment in her mind how should I answer him how should I actually address this fellow that I see before me and she said you know just be it unto me according to Thy word I I can't explain it but hey Amen to the word and what happened she got pregnant yes right but the Angel's message was the word of God it wasn't something else and this is where I think it's so incredibly Rich if we could just take the time to look at the message of the hour sometimes I think even as Believers of the message of the hour it's good for us to go back and just read these words just see what it says Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her Isaiah 9 and6 I thought I had that here yes I do for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and we know that that is exactly what the wedding ceremony is all about where the the bride takes the veil and gives it to the groom and the groom takes it and puts that Veil upon his shoulder what that shows is he's taking sole responsibility for every single aspect of her life now everything that happens in her life he is responsible for if she's good if she's bad everything in between everything about her now is his responsibility and that's the same way for us brothers and sisters that's why that's in here right here we have God speaking this it's still italis words Isaiah 9 and6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her if you have accepted his word to you then you are that her and he's accepted all of the responsibility thank you Lord the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials we know that because if she is actually Spirit born and Spirit-filled when she speaks the word is not going to be her speaking the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our heads this is where I think it's so important I've been preaching his will is his word if we've got his word then we have his will it's important for us to recognize that we're not just going to go and launch out on our own and say I'm just going to go and do this I'm going to go and do that we're going to actually consult with our husband before we do it aren't we but we're never going to ask for something that's a Miss we're never going to ask for something that's out of line because we know what his word is we know what his will is as wives we're never going to come to our husbands with really wacky ideas that we know our husbands will just never go for something that's just absolutely a absurd that doesn't fit our family we're not going to do that we're going to come to our husband with something that he's interested in that he wants to do something that would be an encouragement to him that's what we're going to do I think it's the same way with our heavenly father Amen brother Bram goes on to quote the Holy Ghost notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 519 I I think it's just so beautiful isn't it we don't want to do anything without being in harmony with our husband without being in harmony with the Lord we know that when we do that many times we can find ourselves in what we call the permissive will of God we haven't actually taken the time to ask the Lord he's allowed things to get bumpy for us so that we'll actually just step back and correct our ction and then go forward brother bradam said just go back to where you got off if we ever find ourselves in that situation that's all we have to do it's a very simple thing but usually what happens is that thing called pride gets in the way we don't want to Humble ourselves we want to say oh no no no no everything's good it's all going to be fine and it will be fine if you're truly a son and daughter of God it'll just get a little more bumpy until you actually do go back to where you got off that's all but notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride I would never say just go and do something because you have the word of God in you you got it in your pocket you can just go and do whatever you want to do I would never say that I would never ever imply that what I would say and imply is that if you've taken the time to study the word of God and to study the message of the hour you know that you want to actually have that tight-knit relationship with your heavenly father and you're never going to go and do something a Miss because you always want to have that that closeness that that relationship you're going to do exactly what the word says here this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride she he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it but isn't that the way the devil is he's the king of doubts oh my that's what God's telling me because remember he speaks to us I say Lord help me he speaks to me and brothers and sisters he should speak to you and I want to say tonight if he doesn't speak to you if you can't say for sure that God speaks to you I want to pray that God will make himself so known to you that you'll be able to say amen God speaks to me too because this harmony is supposed to exist between him and his bride today that's what he said here I'm not just making this up he shows her his word of of life she receives it she never doubts it so doubt your doubts when the Devil comes around and says Oh Brother Barry he should never be that Pastor there doubt your doubts right when you have a song leader worshiping and you don't like the way he worships doubt your doubts when you can't see that God is moving in your midst in your life and you're in the midst of a storm doubt your doubts every time you have a doubt brothers and sisters it's the devil it's not God she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death and brothers and sisters when we come to that place in our lives and I believe every single one of that true virgin word born Spirit born spirit filled bride virgin bride of Jesus Christ when she comes to that position in her life of full adoption Authority and power recognizing exactly where she stands and who she is she will be there and not be afraid of death just like the Saints in the old old old Dark Ages where they said you know what like polycarp you don't even have to bind my hands just go ahead and light the fire just spark it up because I know where I'm going and I know who's in control and you can't kill me I I I can only go when he says it's time to go but if we can come to that place where we're not fearing death understanding that nothing can harm us us Satan will be powerless before you because you know how it is when you got a bully if a bully can come around and bully you and make you scared that bully is going to come around and bully you and try and make you scared he's going to try and eat your lunch he's going to try and take your lunch money he's going to try and do whatever he can over and over again to try and make you scared but when you square up your shoulders and you say nope I'm not doing this anymore I'm a son or a daughter of the most high God and I know where I stand I don't have any strength on my own but you know what when he comes to town he's got all Heaven behind him and you know what one word from him and actually that will change everything with you when we can come to that place brothers and sisters there's nothing the devil can do to us I just think it's so beautiful so beautiful so incredibly beautiful my she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and you know what some people they have to be planted that's the way it is that's the law of reproduction that's that's God's chosen way and it's not easy it's not easy for a moment but if that seed be planted the water will raise it up again and I think it's beautiful because it's the washing of the Water by the word that word will raise it up up again there's coming a day I was just thinking about it today when I was listening when I was meditating trying to just get get focused on this brothers and sisters I was just thinking there's coming a day where that General Resurrection is going to happen and and that General Resurrection I personally believe this as well is going to happen through the voice of the Bride she's going to recognize her position and when she does she's going to say come forth and you know what's going to happen all the graves are going to turn loose everything is going to change she is going to do it and he's going to do it through her it's not going to be her choosing now it's time to do it we're we're probably running out of time we won't be able to get into it but if you want to study up for the next time we talk about it you know there was a time in Joshua's day where they said Joshua you must have lost your commission because everything is kind of stalled and you're not really doing anything extraordinary now we need to go and get our land we need to go and actually conquer the land maybe God's done with you we know that Joshua he waited for the land the the timing of God he waited for the instruction of the Lord he didn't just go forwards boldly trying to do things on his own this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it and never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary I I just think this is so fantastic brothers and sisters I I for me this is probably one of my all-time favorite positions in the message of the hour here is the secret of this the Holy Spirit comes down and ministers to his prophet and says pick up your pen whatever you're doing I want you to pick up your pen I've got a message for the Believers in the coming days and I want them to know this I want them to hear this I want them to read these words and actually understand this I want them to comprehend what my mind is for them the secret is this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word just like a husband and a wife when you see a really mature relationship Believers together the wife does what the husband wants and doesn't argue doesn't fuss doesn't stew there's no real issues she knows what the husband wants done with his word now this really got me here she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose I think this is so beautiful for a long time I thought that she has the mind of Christ and and she is just able to speak the word what's the third poll isn't it after all it's the third poll we should be able to speak the word I I want to speak the word for this need and it should just come to pass right because we have the third poll and what happens when it doesn't come to pass brothers and sisters then we have a a disappointing time and we say well maybe that word just isn't with me maybe I'm just not that bright maybe maybe maybe what happens is the floodgates of doubts start to roll into the life of the believer but don't listen to those doubts don't look at it that way what I believe the Lord showed me is something really important here she performs what not the command of her word she performs the command of the word that's what she does she performs the command of the word the word is his will she commands the word she does she performs the command of the word I just had this jump off the page at me the command of the word not the command of the Bride many times I think we could do it though I'm guilty I want to say I've got the mind of Christ in me I've got thus sayeth the Lord we got to be careful because we can start waving our own little wand thinking that we're going to try and make it happen that's not way the way God wants it to to happen that's not the way he's saying it in the word here she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord not everyone can do this brothers and sisters not everyone can perform the command of the word clearly otherwise this building would be full otherwise all of the message churches all around the world would be full otherwise everyone who is a Christian around the world would believe the message of the hour not everyone can perform the command of the word but those who can Will those who can will say Amen to the word because they're a virgin not to their own thinking they're a virgin to his word they're not letting any man-made Creeds or any dogmas or any Traditions capture them and drag them down what they're willing to do is shake them all off and say just be it unto me according to Thy word maybe I don't understand it maybe this is all new to me and I I've never heard it this way or maybe I've heard it this way but I've just never been able to receive it I don't know but just like Mary said just be it unto me according to Thy word and what happened she actually got pregnated and brothers and sisters the only way we're getting out of here is to have an impregnation by the spirit in our lives we have to have that without that we are just church members boy oh boy she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose many times in our lives we'll have prayers brothers and sisters we're going to have a a a service coming up and and we're going to start going through very specific prayer requests because I think it's so easy to forget we have a prayer request we pray and then we plant that seed and and you know what it gets watered and sometimes we forget about those requests but they get answered and you know what they always get answered God never ever doesn't answer a request it's either the way we want it to or not the way we want it to but he always answers but the thing I think is so good I I don't know if anybody ever saw it one time there was a a video that was put out I don't know who put it out exactly but there was a video that was put out of of this very thought where there's someone that can go and plant a seed a farmer can plant a seed and when you plant the seed you need to know how many days it takes for that seed to germinate it's important to know that so that you can have a realistic expectation but sometimes you'll have a seed and you won't know how many days it is until that seed germinates and and you plant that seed in the ground and you water that seed and you you give it sunshine you give it warmth and you water that seed and you give it sunshine you give it warmth and you continually go through that cycle and hope that that seed will start to germinate and if you don't see it germinate in the time frame you think about sometimes what we do is be be desirous to go and dig up that seed and see is it living is there life there but if we do that we kill that seed we need to leave that seed we need to plant that seed and we need to trust by faith that that seed is actually going to grow and you know what it will we just have to have patience we just have to remember that even a seed is such a perfect example because the seed is created to be in God's timeline isn't it I don't know maybe there's smarter people here but I don't think you could actually maybe you could create genetically a seed that would germinate faster but it's still got to go through the process of being planted rotting dying out and then actually resurrecting again it all has to happen according to God's law but sometimes when the seed is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest but it's not actually in the time frame in which we think it should we need to be patient and give God the opportunity to bring it to manifest brothers and sisters it will come to full Harvest serving its purpose according to what the word says here tonight I'll call the musicians I I'm I I I want to continue on with this I'll pick it up we'll come come back to the very beginning of this I think maybe not the very beginning but uh maybe a couple paragraphs back when we get back together again I think this is just so good it's so important I I don't think we could ever ever ever o overestimate the importance of this portion of the word because it has to do with us the bride those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise isn't that beautiful they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word we can't fulfill his word we can't grow and dig up that seed and and pour more water on it and give it more heat and maybe more light and make that seed do anything more than it's supposed to do according to the law of God it's going to do what it's going to do in his time but I just love how he says this here he did not complete all his Works while in his Earth Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work what she left for this specific time brothers and sisters this is just so rich maybe stand with me as we close tonight am just remember brothers and sisters if I could just impress upon us one thing she performs the command of the word not the command of her word the command of the word his word we need to know where we stand and we need to make sure that we're speaking his word when we do that all Heaven is there to back us up and we just need to allow our praise to water that seed that gets planted through a prayer and when we do that God will come around and he will bring it to a full Harvest God richly bless you tonight let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you Lord Jesus for a Vindicated Prophet that you could speak to this age through Lord for the magnetic recording device that you could Lord distribute his voice knowing that you were speaking through him that you were showing the sign of the time lord discerning people's hearts so that you could give us this word Lord Jesus not so you could perform for man Lord Jesus we thank you for your word thank you that you have a bride that she is a virgin unto you Lord Jesus and father that virgin bride just says Amen to that word to this word that we heard tonight father I pray that Lord you would just continue watching over us continue revealing yourself to us and through us Lord Jesus giving us the ability to to hear more of your word Lord Jesus to see more of your word father Lord I pray that we would just be drawn so much towards you father that we would become in your very image Lord Jesus so that we could be United with you father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word pray for each life here tonight those who couldn't make it Lord father I pray for the services while we're away that you would just bless the prayer meeting Lord those seeds that get planted there we thank you for the many times of planting and the many many harvests Lord Jesus that you grant to us through your grace and your mercy thank you Lord father we pray that you would Grant to us traveling mercies while we go father that you would bless our time away as well that you would bless the service on Sunday and bring us back safely again at the appointed time lord father we love you and we thank you you we just want to commit all things into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] amen Holy
