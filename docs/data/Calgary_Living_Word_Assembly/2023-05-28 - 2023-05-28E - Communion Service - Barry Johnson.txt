Jesus we're so thankful that we can sing this song by Revelation Lord Jesus that we recognize it was just for me father just for me you went to Calvary father we know that when you were talking to those thieves on the cross even just that one Thief father you had us on your mind father Lord we can't even comprehend what that means but we know that that's what your word says father before the foundation of the world we were on your mind father we thank you that this is a personal thing tonight father we just asked that you would bless this service in a special way father bless each one who's been able to come out father and Lord even those who couldn't come for whatever reason Lord we pray that you would just Minister unto them even now father Lord we just ask that you would have your will and your way in this service father and most of all father that you would receive all the praise and all the glory and all the honor father Lord as we partake of your body father as we wash one another's feet Lord as we speak the testimonies of what you've done for us Lord in our lives we just pray that you would receive the glory let's you would be glorified father in every aspect of this service we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen welcome tonight God bless you to the house of the Lord for another communion service thank you musicians if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from First Corinthians chapter 10 starting with verse verse 13. actually 12. First Corinthians 10 verse 12. when you get there Say Amen still hear pages I just don't want to rush I think it's important for us to take the time not be in a hurry we know that the Spirit of the Lord is timid and if we get nervous it's not a good thing start with verse 12. First Corinthians chapter 10. it says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that year Abel but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it he's not going to give you a complete deliverance he's going to take that temptation and use it to deliver verse 14 wherefore my dearly beloved Flee for idolatry I speak as to wise men judge ye what I say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread behold Israel after the flesh are they not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar what say I them that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to Idols is anything but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for your goodness thank you for the Discerning of spirits Lord and the ability to have the the spirit of Truth father come and minister to us the the words of Life father Lord we just ask that you would speak the words you want spoken tonight and stop those which you don't we ask that you would bless this word now as we go forwards father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen bless you tonight you may be seated I will not keep us long in terms of a a preaching service basically brothers and sisters I think it's a beautiful scripture here if you go back maybe on your spare time and just read from the beginning of chapter 10 verse 1 it talks about them going through the Wilderness and how there was a cloud a pillar of cloud that delivered them and you know it's no different for us in our day we have a pillar of cloud that has given us deliverance and given us guidance today and I I just think it's a beautiful scripture here we could summarize the whole thing right now with verse 21 you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you can't be a double-minded man you can't live in the world and come to church and partake of the communion table because we know we're going to read it a little bit later if we do that we eat and drink unworthily that means we eat and drink damnation unto ourselves you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils we cannot be double agents you know uh brother Phil mcgowby he preached a service a while back before he left some may know him some may not he moved to Africa but he preached a service about Discerning the Lord's body and you know if we can recognize who the Lord is today where the Lord's Temple is today if we recognize really what we're talking about when we talk about Discerning the Lord's body it's not Discerning that this bread and wine that we eat is is the Lord's body even though it is it's an example of the Lord's body that was broken for us the Lord's body is our brothers and our sisters it's not just the Gentile church it's not just the church the mystical Body of Christ it is all of that but brothers and sisters it's our brothers and our sisters our husbands our wives our parents our our children it's all of the bodies of Believers they're all a part of that body and you know we will never be able to drink of this cup and eat of this bread worthily if we don't discern the Lord's body and recognize whose feet we are going to wash tonight and I've said it before the last time probably we had communion service and maybe even the time before that you know when uh when Abram had his name change and he went and had the slaughter of the Kings he he saved his nephew who was a a penny in the economy of God even though he was a silver dollar he still ran to the ends of the Earth brother Branham said to to save his his nephew and and the reason he did that is he was Discerning the Lord's body he recognized that he was a part of the economy of God and he wasn't allowed allowing him to just go and be consumed by what was happening he did everything within his power to go and save him but it was only after the slaughtering of the Kings it was only after the battle and after the Deliverance that who came to serve him communion it was Melchizedek tonight brothers and sisters I want to remind us I want to encourage us when you come to the communion table don't think about brother Peter or brother Emmanuel or brother Toby standing here with you or brother Barry standing behind the Paw think about Melchizedek himself being here that one who serves communion because that's really what we're doing we're Discerning the Lord's body and we know that Melchizedek was a type of the Lord out of communion in 1965 brother Branham says now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred I just think it's such a maybe a simple statement a couple of simple quotes is all I'm going to bring tonight and this scripture here we can't serve God and Mammon we can't live in the world and then run to church and actually serve God we've got to be willing to give our all to be able to discern the Lord's body and if we don't do that brothers and sisters we're eating and drinking unworthily we'll be bringing damnation unto ourselves but when we're willing to actually just lay ourselves down on the Altar and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word let let your word come inside of me and just give me that new birth Change Me From the Inside Out not the outside in like we said this morning from the inside out if you will do that Lord then I know that I can come to the table worthily and I believe honestly brothers and sisters that's why every one of us have come here and I know that I'm hearing a lot of Amen so that means you agree I'm preaching to the choir tonight but I don't want to say a lot tonight I don't want to take a bunch of time just a couple of quotes like I said I want to give us a chance to have some testimonies I know I talked about having a testimony service at one point but uh you know it's a smaller crowd so I feel like we could do a testimony service and get away with it and the reason I like the testimony Services because it's good to talk about what God is currently doing in our midst it's good to understand what the Lord is doing for us right now today not not sometime in the future and not sometime in the past we can all look back in our lives and say we've seen many great signs and wonders many tremendous miracles in our lives but what's he doing for us today Satan wants us to forget about what's happening today he brother Bradham said it many times that you know he it's the biggest trick of the devil is to get man looking forward to what God is going to do and looking back to what he's already done but ignoring what he's doing right now and that's why I think it's so vital for us to remember what he's doing right now to talk about what he's doing right now it could be just enough encouragement to push one of your brothers or sisters right over the edge with a little bit of extra Faith to say hey if God will do it for my brother God will do it for my sister he'll do it for me I know he will because I believe like they believe at a community in 1965 1212 brother Branham says now we're fixing to observe something that's really sacred I was called on a few days ago to some very fine Christian gentleman that's never had this and he understood that we take in communion literally they take it what they call spiritual communion and which as far as communion I'd say all right because communicate is to talk to see and that brother give me this scripture said brother Branham don't you think now now reason I'm saying this is it's all right brother Perry he says sure see the reason that I'm saying this is so that you would understand what you're doing we have to understand what we're doing brothers and sisters this isn't just a tradition that we come and do because our parents do it it's not just a tradition that we come and do because even brother Branham said come and do it this is not just a tradition that we do because everybody comes to do it we do this because we love the Lord because we understand that he gave us instruction to do this and do this with a clean heart and isn't it wonderful that we have this as Believers even sometimes in our lives maybe we think my goodness I don't know if I can do that I don't know if I can go to the communion table because I just don't have something right in my heart the reason we have that is so that we'll go make that right because the believer is coming to this communion table the believer is not going to not come to this communion table and that's just maybe my view but I just believe it with all my heart the believer is coming to the communion table we won't pass up the community tale because that's an instruction of the Lord he says see that reason I'm saying this is so that you would understand what you're doing you don't if you walk into anything blindly you don't know where what you're doing you can't have even confidence if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand what you are doing and why you're doing it he said now if we take the word of God isn't that God that we're taking said exactly right sir it's true but we read here that they actually Paul taught taking the literal Lord's Supper this do in remembrance of me said Jesus as oft as ye take it in remembrance of me you show forth the Lord's death till he comes see now we are able to take it when we understand that we are partaking of the Lord's body literally partaking of the Lord's body Discerning that this is the instruction of the Lord we're following the instructions of the lord it's not some tradition that we're after here I just can't express it enough I just think it's such a a wonderful thing and you know to say that maybe I don't have something right in my heart so I'm just not going to go to church and I'm not going to partake of the communion table you're actually disobeying God by not taking the communion because we're supposed to take the communion table we're supposed to discern the Lord's body we're supposed to make sure that our lives are correct and if they're not correct just make them correct that's all we need to do we don't want to walk around with a ball and chain you know what that is that's a devil that's a Tormentor something is holding us back from doing what the Lord instructs us to do but once again I know I'm preaching to the choir because everyone's here to partake of the Lord's body if you're here tonight Brothers and Sisters You've Got reason to celebrate I believe you've got reason to shout because something inside you constrains you to come and follow the leadership of the Lord to partake of one of the last three instructions that were given to the church brother Branham says there's three physical Divine orders left to the church out of this the message communion 1965 he says now we only have three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is communion Discerning the Lord's body the other one is foot washing we know the word of God says happy are ye if you do these things happy are you if you can humble yourself before your brother before your sister you don't have so much pride then I don't have to go and deal with someone's stinky feet you know I say that not not because anybody has any stinky feet it's more of a personal thing for me because I used to be a cobbler and I used to deal with shoes extensively but you know brothers and sisters for me that was something I had to get over that was a real hurdle for me to think seriously wash someone's feet man that's weird but it says it in the Bible because it says it in the Bible I say hey man I'm in I'm all in let's do it let's do this if it's in the Bible I want to do it the prophet of God said we have only three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is communion feet washing and water baptism that's the only three things that's the Perfection of three so if you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins you're coming to the Lord's table to partake of the communion the the body of the Lord to discern the Lord's body and you're willing to actually go on and have the foot washing then you have followed all of the instructions of the Lord these are not the instructions of the Prophet even though the prophet brought these instructions this is instruction of the Lord through the prophet to the church and if we're willing to follow the prophet's instructions we're willing to follow the lord because everything that he's saying here this is a beautiful part brothers and sisters everything he's saying here is in the word of God he's not bringing anything new he goes on to say see and that's the only three orders we have we realize that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament now if we would say the communion should just be taking the word I don't believe anyone has the right to take the Lord's Supper until he's taken the word of the Lord into his heart see because I'll I'll read something for you in a few moments and you'll see we have got to be willing to take the whole entire word of God into our hearts to follow those three instructions and you know whether we have the Holy Ghost or not I would say this much don't worry about whether you have the Holy Ghost or not worry about whether you followed the instructions or not if you followed the instructions or not with a genuine heart then you're eligible to partake of the Lord's Supper it's that simple you don't have to qualify in any other way just have to have a pure heart you have to be genuine you have to be willing to follow the instruction of the Lord so tonight I'm just going to stop there I'm not going to go on because I don't want to keep us late I know that we could have a lot of testimonies and I just want to be able to open it up for the testimonies what I do want to do is two things brothers and sisters I want to encourage you to just continue walking continue pressing on and never ever let anything get between you and that communion table because if anything gets between you and that communion table I want to tell you what it is it's the devil it's just a devil that's all it is if something gets between you and that communion table and no nobody wants to let a devil get between us and the word so just keep pressing on and don't be discouraged so tonight if you'll turn with me I'll just change the order of the service we'll go right into the communion portion then we'll have testimonies and then we'll go to foot washing if you don't mind so if you uh don't mind just flip the page First Corinthians chapter 11. maybe stand with me as we read this portion here this is the instruction for the Lord's table verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shoo the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come remember brother Branham said here now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred we're going to partake of the Lord's body brothers and sisters if if there's anything in our lives if there's anything in our hearts just take a moment and ask the Lord to show you and if there's anything that we can do even now in this moment if there's someone we need to talk to we'll take the time you can make it right you don't have to come to the table unworthily let's just take a moment or two and just tarry one for another and allow this word to wash us before we partake dear heavenly father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for this opportunity Lord one more time father to come before you Lord to recognize that this is something sacred that's just for me it's not for the masses it's only because you chose me in you before the foundation of the world father tonight I pray that this would be every one of our prayer Lord you chose us in you and this is about me and it's about you you and I it's a personal relationship father and tonight we just ask that you would bless each one who takes you at your word father who follows the instruction that you have given to us in our day through the Vindicated prophet father we pray that we could just take this word Lord as we read it that it would go right down into our very Soul father that it would make our our mouth sweet as honey father that it would just make our bellies bitter father exactly according to your word and we just ask that we could come before this table tonight father worthily and if there's any one father that has something that might be a little bit off father I pray that you would just Lord allow it to their ignorance father and just allow every one of us to be worthy as we come before this table help us to recre just to remember father to recognize to acknowledge how sacred this moment really is and we'll be careful to give you all the praise father my prayer is that no one would eat or drink tonight unworthily we just asked that we could commit the next part of this service into your hands father in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I'll just invite the brothers to come and take the wine and pray over it and the bread and pray over it foreign [Music] Hearts before him a great privilege to come into your presence this evening come with a heart of humility and a desire to fulfill your word of God we thank you oh God that we can come to express to you our love by The Obedience to your commandment father you say that if we love you we should obey your Commandments and here we are father you have given us the spirit to the strength to understand to know and to come father this way father as we come Lord we come just as we are we pray oh Lord that damnation will never be the part of any person who is coming here in Jesus Christ Name Lord you hate sin but you are the only one who forgives sin you are the only one we can turn to and so we pray that father you'll be merciful and Restless father our desire is that every blessing in this behind portion like the brother prayed O Lord we desire healing from this we desire complete Clarity from this we desire discernment from this we deserve strength oh Lord the strength that will make a person go on 40 50 days without eating further we decide the strength that will lead us all the way to the Rapture Lord let your will be done oh God help us to only believe and live this word for your honor and Glory we appreciate you master even for this privilege now in Jesus Christ name amen dear father Lord we come before you Lord Jesus Christ as Lord you beat us come Lord Jesus Christ he said come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy lady Lord Jesus and you promise to give us rest Lord between this father in in obedience Lord Jesus Christ to your commandment Lord as your servant said their lord Jesus father those three ordinances Lord Jesus all two of them being done tonight Lord Jesus we know their father Lord that it takes the spirit of God to give us lot of desire to even be here in the first place Lord Jesus as you have brought us here Lord may you look beyond our fault Lord Jesus may you see I need dear Lord Jesus may we lord as we partake of this Lord Jesus not just father Lord do this Lord Jesus as an ordinance but may we receive the cleansing Lord Jesus Christ father that will require a lord to stand before you blameless Lord Jesus each and every day their lord Jesus we know their
