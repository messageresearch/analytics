Certainly honored and privileged to gather together in his name one more time. Just like to welcome our visitors from Edmonton, brother Mark Anthony Nalleog and brother Demar and brother Norbert and family. God richly bless you all. We trust you feel right at home tonight. If you have a need on your heart, may we just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand. We just have one unspoken request that we'd like to bring. Let's just bow. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, tonight we're so thankful that we can gather together in your name, Lord. We're so thankful that we can, Lord Jesus, have a provided place where we can worship you, Lord. And we know that you have given us a natural building, Lord Jesus, that we can worship you in spirit and in truth, Father, according to the word for our day. Lord Jesus, tonight, I pray that you would just be glorified in the remainder of this service. Lord, we're so honored and privileged to be able to worship you, Father, on this side of eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we recognize what you've done for us, and we thank you for it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Tonight, Father, we just want to remember each and every need that was made known by the way, an uplift hand tonight, Father, that you would just meet the request sovereignly in each one of our lives, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to also remember the unspoken request, Lord. We know that you're more than able to meet every single need, every single desire, Lord, every single situation, Lord, that we'll encounter in our lives. Nothing is too complex for you. And Lord, we just commit all of our needs into your hands tonight. And Lord, we'll be careful to give you all the praise. Now, heavenly father, as we change the order of the service and we turn to your word, we pray that you would just help us to get out of the way, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and allow you to speak through our brother Danny. We thank you for sending him our way as our brother already prayed. Lord, we know that he has a thought that you've placed in his heart. Father, help us to receive that word tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We just ask that you would be with all those who couldn't gather tonight, Lord, wherever they are, whatever they're doing. Father, bless them abundantly, we ask. &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm sure we all know brother Danny Delmundo from uh Manila, Philippines. We had a privilege of fellowshipping with him back in March. Brother Mvin and I went there and uh attended the Asian ministers conference and it was a wonderful time of fellowship and just so thankful to have brother Danny as a friend and uh a brother in Christ. So, we know how it goes. If we go to pull and he'll go to preaching and the Lord will speak to us. And we know we don't just have to have a need that we make known by the way of an uplift hand. We can have a need in our heart and God can minister to it sovereignly through the preaching of the word. Maybe we could just sing that song into the chamber. Be free, Holy Spirit. Just the chorus tonight. into the chamber. Be free. Holy Spirit, speak to me gently. [Music] I worship my [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. Not many have entered into that inner chamber. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But once we get there, there's no turning back. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so addictive to be there and to dwell and to to stay. There's no light like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so we certainly appreciate the presence of the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once again appreciate uh uh brother Perry for having me once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And of course the Pineda family was was a family. Amen. So and uh the brethren from Edmonton who made their way to be here certainly appreciate each and every one of you and of course each and every one of us that have come here. Amen. Uh we have come here for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and for his word. And uh I believe he's our preacher this evening. Brother Danny has nothing to preach except the Lord. Amen. Uh would open our mouth and uh so we can do our everything. We we can we can prepare. Amen. But unless the Lord bless it. Amen. Uh there's nothing to it. But we have come here under expectation. So we believe that the Lord will uh uh will will say something to us. So without further ado, we would like to go straight to the reading of the word. Amen. Uh let's read in the book of Matthew. Uh just want to leave you a simple thought this evening. Amen. So God bless you our precious musicians. Amen. In chapter 21 verse one we will read uh down to 11. It says here, "And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Beth Fagi unto the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tithe, and cult with her. loose them and bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them, and straightway he will send them. All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye, the daughter of Zion, behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek and sitting upon an ass, and he called the fo of an ass. And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him there on. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees and stroed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried, saying, "Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest." And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multi multitude said, "This is Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. Amen. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Dear heavenly father, we thank you this evening. We invite your presence to uh uh to dwell once again. And uh Lord uh uh as we feel you, we as we worship you, we we believe and we're so confident Lord &gt;&gt; that you are pleased with the people that have come here under expectation, oh God. And uh uh may you have liberty this evening to speak before your people. Amen. Take me out of the way and have your own way, Lord, this evening. Amen. And as we commit every portion of the service in Jesus Christ's wonderful name and everybody say amen this evening. God bless you. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. So uh it's a wonderful opportunity to be back here once again. Uh uh so of course this is the the first church where I visited uh the first time I landed in Canada. So this this is always the the route. Amen. That I have to uh to pass through. But anyway, as the Lord leads, Amen. Uh so we appreciate sending your pastor and brother Merlin last March and they've been a blessing to the uh Asian conference and of course to our uh anniversary meeting uh but very uh been a blessing to to many. Amen. Not only our congregation, not only our family. Amen. But uh wherever uh uh we went and they went uh uh the Lord has used him and used them so mightily for the glory of the Lord. Amen. And we always desire uh to have them both go back, amen, to the Philippines. And uh uh so we just want to be a blessing everywhere we go. And that is also my desire this evening. Amen. And uh before I go on, I just want to uh to give you amen uh a little oh not not a little but a great testimony. Amen. Because last March, Amen. Just I remember uh in the morning when uh brother Barry was uh about to minister he was looking for my son Genesis and uh along with brother Mahim they were and uh so but Genesis is in charge of our technical team and he's so busy and uh he was not there but in the evening uh when I requested uh uh brother Barry to pray for my family Uh amen. Uh so the prayer because my my son Genesis uh yeah he's he's been he's been he'd been diagnosed with uh uh congenital heart disease when he was young 3 months old and uh uh 3 years old uh he had this surgery and then uh a long story but we have to make it short. uh after the first surgery he had to undergo another surgery for the following year just to prepare him for a open heart surgery and to have the total correction of his heart but because life was hard so forth and so on and we were not able to do it a year after the second year and we were able to do it the third year so he he was already 6 years old then so the doctors Amen were surprised how come because the they they put him, you know, uh uh what you call this a synthetic artificial vein just to help him uh have some, you know, uh oxygen for his body. But it was he was growing and it will not grow. So at the at the end at the end of the year, the the oxygen could no longer be enough because that vein is not growing. So that's why you know the doctors the surgeons they're saying do you love your do you love your son you know everything we love him but what shall we do so second year and then third year that was the time when Genesis had his uh open heart surgery but they were all wondering how he was able to make it for three years and upon checking amen so that's why we call Genesis a mira miracle boy because when they look uh they found out that uh that an extra vein grew [Laughter] &gt;&gt; and that sustained him &gt;&gt; for extra two years. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then all along and then uh okay fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast forward they get married a very faithful uh uh wife sister Micah very very very faithful and uh of course Lisa sister Lisa uh uh met them and uh uh uh she's very uh lovely sister and so uh they've been praying they've been married for six years and about seven years. And so last March only uh when we were uh being prayed for by your pastor, brother uh brother Barry, of course, others were also praying. Amen. And God is so faithful. &gt;&gt; Just last week, just last week, I was in North Carolina and my son called me, "Papa, can you check?" because I asked him to uh bring my car in the in the shop because after the mission trip in the mountain, we passed through rivers and so forth and so on, you know, I had uh my my my car had some problem. So he he brought it to the to the shop and while I was in North Carolina, uh it was middle of the evening. It was middle of the day over there and papa, would you look at it? So, we had a video call and then I look at it. I thought it was it it was a receipt or an estimate costing of how much I'm going to pay for the car. And I read there five weeks. I said, "Why too long? It's too long. Why five weeks?" I said, "Look at it closely, Papa." And when I look, Amen. Ma is five weeks pregnant. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, but but they need to be back because it, uh, it, you know, they just got so excited and they had to be back. Uh, but everything is, uh, is good. And so that's why they were supposed to go to Hong Kong because I was supposed to speak in a uh, anniversary meeting also in Hong Kong, but my my schedule conf uh uh had a a conflict and I cannot make it on the 7th. So my my kids will be coming. faith, my youngest, and and uh another sister, sister Charmaine and uh Micah and Genesis. So when I knew that, I said, "Forget it." Amen. Because uh you know, you have to take care of that. And so uh they have to postpone their uh going to Hong Kong because of that. So God is so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then after 7 years. Hallelujah. So with that I am so encouraged and uh I said if this is the only thing that I will say to brother Barry, Amen. I will be happy. Amen. Because it's a it's really a big testimony uh not only to my family, my whole congregation. They're really praying for this couple. Amen. And uh uh now it's here. Amen. So now going back to the scripture, amen, that we have just read. Amen. Uh would like to title this uh let me use that verse in verse two. Go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied an occult with her. loose them and bring them unto me. If any man say ought unto you, ye shall say the Lord had need of them and straightway he will send them. Amen. So I would like to get a title from that uh point being loosed for the master's use. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Being used or being loose for the master's use. So if we're going to look at it, you know, this is an actual story, but everything in the scripture, Amen. Uh uh they have uh prophetic implications. Uh especially uh brother Bham said, you know, when you when you read the scripture, you need to see yourself. You need to find yourself if you can't find it because we are we are actually uh a fulfillment of a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because uh when when when he was entering into the uh into the city, he said in in verse 8, a very great multitude spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees and stroed them in the way. Amen. So they have they have done something in recognition of what they have witnessed. Amen. So uh uh first and foremost we have to see referring to Zechariah 9:9 because in verse four uh he said all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. saying, tell ye the daughter of Zion, behold thy king, cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass. And he called the pole of an ass. Amen. So he came to the city and remember he said thy king. So he's very specific. He's not king for everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's only a king. Thy king. It's very personal. Thy king. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight, if he is thy king tonight, our king tonight. Amen. He's our lord of lords. He's king of kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has come to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's very specific and God is very accurate as the word of God is so accurate. Amen. So he come in a very specific time and he comes to a very specific group of people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So those who recognize immediately they refer to the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why in verse 5, so when they see that he entered into the city and then they they uh uh uh and you look at the the illustration, the the the situation. Amen. He was riding on an ass. Suddenly the people who are word based in their faith. Amen. They they suddenly turned to their scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they look and say uh uh it says uh they said in verse tell ye the daughter of Zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and called the polanas referring to Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; So it says in Zechariah 9:9, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold thy king." Amen. Cometh unto thee. He is just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon an ass, and a cult the f of an ass. Amen. So it is a complete replica. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the vision must be complete. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know Jesus could have entered the city and he could have bypassed that because he knew the place where it is and everybody amen knew where you know the disciples knew where they were coming. Amen. Uh uh so but Jesus uh he said you know just like Paul said I am always obedient to the heavenly vision. So even him he himself he did not in any way divide from any word that had been spoken of him. So every dot every period everything that was prophesied on him amen he only fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the the so the previous prophecy in Zechariah chapter 9 is no longer a prophecy now but it is a fulfillment. Amen. It's already a fulfillment and is part becoming a history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now they they said now this he said uh in in in the message uh what is the attraction on the mountain? He said God then what was he doing? referring to the same scripture. What is that attraction up there on the hill? It's God making history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God fulfilling prophecy. And that always causes an attraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It brings all the critics up. So when the pro prophecy is being fulfilled, Amen. the the the predestinated seed, the first thing that they have to do is to look on the scripture and find out this must be that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the unpredestion but just to watch what's going on. Amen. And and they could also be it brings all critics up. The vultures. Amen. and the eagles also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we we we know where we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they come together to find out what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So coming for curiosity. Some coming to find fault, others coming to criticize. There's all kinds gathered. As we said this morning, believers make believers and unbelievers. What's on the mountain? Prophecy is being fulfilled. Now we'll see what takes place. So when a prophecy is being fulfilled, Amen. it creates an attraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh but of course although this message is prophetic, we don't force the prophecy to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just walking into the fulfillment of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we uh uh because uh let me read another scripture in Habacook chapter 2:3. I believe we read this before. For the vision is shut for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it t for it because it will surely come, it will not tar. Amen. So we are a product of a prophecy. And the the uh uh the disciple said there is a bride. Amen. That is going to perfect. It's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because we believe, amen, that we are part of this prophecy. Amen. So then we are fulfilling something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're fulfilling something here in the day and age that we are living in that if there is a bride perfect before him, &gt;&gt; I am part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the age where we stop justifying our weaknesses. Amen. This is the the age that you know that that that perfection is is still uh h a future event. Brother Bayham said there is only one prophecy. There is only one thing, amen, that we are waiting for and that is the body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. The coming of the Lord where we're going to meet him. So it must be there must be a situation of the bride in this day and age. Amen. That we should not be looking on all our weaknesses. We should not be looking on things of the past. Amen. But we should be claiming. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we are part of the bride and at this day and age, amen, that that the time and and and eternity is blending together. I must take my position. I must be a walking fulfilled prophecy in this day. Amen. Hallelujah. Not to claim anything that we are not. Amen. But we are claiming what Jesus has already fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now you see there when he come in verse 8 let me read in Matthew 21:8 and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and stroed them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed Christ saying hosana to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana in the highest. So it created an attraction and then look at this. So all those people that have been caught with that fulfillment of prophecy. So this is a mixed multitude. All right. So those who knew it was a fulfillment of a prophecy and they were part Amen. of somebody who will respond positively. Look what they did. A great multitude spread their garments in the way. They knew this is not a simple event. This is something special. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're witnessing something. Amen. And so now, so they said uh uh they spread their garments. Others cut down branches from the trees and stroed them in the way. So when you realize that the word is being fulfilled, &gt;&gt; you know you have something to do. &gt;&gt; You know you have to react on it. &gt;&gt; You're not just watching. &gt;&gt; You must be a part of it. &gt;&gt; You must be involved. If there is a burden, we must carry the burden &gt;&gt; with it because now this is we're waiting for this. Amen. So, and now they they have nothing to do. They didn't have to go home. But what they had they all the you know they they they throw their garments because they saw this is thy king. Amen. Sitting upon an ass. Amen. And so because they realized that that was their king sitting upon an ass in due respect. Amen. So they threw their garments in that way. The the the ass where the the the king was riding on top of her. Amen. Could not step on the ground on the dirt. Amen. Hallelujah. Now remember, Amen. that ass was a beast and beast means power, &gt;&gt; right? So if beast means power, so Jesus the king was riding in that tower. So remember Rebecca, he fed that camel, that beast, and that beast brought her to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the parable of the good Samaritan, Amen. the good Samaritan. Amen. He rode in a beast. Amen. So he uh uh uh he he he he he rode on that beast. And that's why we see that Samaritan, Amen. is is is not in an ordinary person, but it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself. It's not somebody who is good because that Samaritan came where that backsliden person was. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he came down and so that's the same thing. So that's why uh uh you know uh uh this is the the power that the Lord Jesus Christ is riding on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So today where he is riding on that eagle beast flying eagle beast. So but but 2,000 years ago let's focus on this on this event. Amen. He was riding in that beast of power the uh uh the ass. And then when he entered and so know uh uh that's why uh brother Banham said you know uh brother Banham he asked they asked will the bride have a ministry before the rapture. Amen. And uh brother Banham's answer was very clear and he said sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what's going on right now. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour. The bride of Christ. She's consist of apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. Is that right? That's the bride of Christ. She's got a ministry, great ministry. It's the ministry of the hour. It will be so humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the ministry of the bride. So if we're going to look at it, I'm just making an illust illustration as they will they throw the garments and then others they have no you know something to throw and they they did not go home. Whatever is available within their reach. Amen. They pick branches and throw it so that they have they can they they will be able to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they recognize who was riding on that beast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know if you look if you could imagine perhaps that beast that Jesus was riding on as he stepped on that uh garments and branches of trees leaves and everything maybe he is appreciating the people maybe he's saying in his heart thank you thank you he's so proud because he was the one stepping into those garments and branches of trees. Amen. But you know that's the same thing with the ministry &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes uh uh you know uh uh people forget Amen. that the real ministry Amen. There is humility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it takes humility to be an effective minister of the gospel. And uh we're so glad we have a a a a minister here that can really be bird the burden. Amen. And with such a humility uh we really appreciate ministries like that. So you see it it's the same thing. No where people are only used by the Lord and we should be proud of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember King David when uh when he sent or he did not send uh those three warriors. They just heard what David said. Oh, how I wish I could drink of that water out of Bethlehem. Amen. But he knew the situation. He could not go there because it was uh surrounded by by the Philistines. But you see what happened to uh those warriors. Amen. They were able they fought. They they traveled long. They traveled back and then just to give something for the king. Amen. Because they recognized their king. Amen. They did service. But look at David's humility. He was so humbled by the service that his warriors did. And he recognized that what they did, Amen, he did not deserve such kind of service. And so he took it. He recognized what they did, but he poured it. Amen. So Lord, this is not for me. This kind of service is not for me. This is for you. &gt;&gt; They have jeopardized their lives, Lord. Amen. So I believe with that kind of condition when the Lord comes, Amen. He will be looking for a ministry. This a prophecy. The bride will have a ministry. But it's a ministry that is so humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now looking back, he said now uh uh so we're saying those people they did not have to go home but they have to do what they can do right at that very moment. And this is what we're saying. Amen. When we have the opportunity to do something for God, when we have the opportunity to do something for God's people, amen, we don't miss that opportunity. Hallelujah. They didn't have to go home and take chance. Amen. And and and and take the best what is available in their home. No, because that time, that opportunity will may not come again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If they run uh to go home and get something, maybe precious, maybe something expensive. Amen. when they get there, Jesus has passed on already. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's the same thing. Amen. We cannot say, "Oh, I'm too old for that." We cannot say, "I'm too young for that." Amen. When the opportunity comes, Amen. When we hear the word of God, Amen. We should respond right away because we might miss the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now he said uh and they said and when he was come in Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this? People were moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the word is fulfilled people are being moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we will move depending on the seed that we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In order when we when we are being moved Amen. by something that is so positive. Amen. When that deep call, Amen. Hallelujah. As being called, Amen. And that deep that seed deep inside will always respond to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so he said, who is this? Amen. And when he was coming to Jerusalem, all the city, all the city was moved. But not all the people in the city were predestinated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Not everybody here in Calgary are predestinated seeds of the Lord. Amen. And you should be glad you have responded to the call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are being moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're being touched. Amen. Amen. Not not we're not the only people who have heard this message especially today. Amen. It's all over in social media, in YouTube, in in in in Facebook. You can hear this message. Amen. But how come you respond positively? Because there is something in you. Amen. That have responded to that deep call. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all the city was moved. &gt;&gt; And Bar said others criticize. Others are just curious why they are there. Amen. Others try to find fault. Amen. But there are people, amen, who did something in recognition of what is going on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so when there's opportunity, we have to do what's uh uh what what is best. Now he said in what is the attraction of the mountain? Paragraph 47. Now in the book of Zechariah chapter 9 he said rejoice greatly. Of course he mentioned the many scripture. Now what was the matter with those scribes? What was the matter with those priests? What was the matter with those religious people? This was written for 187 years before it happened by a vindicated prophet and was already put into writings and called the Bible the scrolls of the Old Testament. Why couldn't say they see that this this prophecy being fulfilled? The same reason they can see it today. &gt;&gt; So history is just repeating itself. They have taken the word of God and made it of none effect to the people. Amen. By teaching for traditions for doctrine the traditions of men. Amen. So when we hear the message of the hour because because the word of God has a quickening power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It quickens the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So regardless of seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when the sun shines, &gt;&gt; it shine to both seed. &gt;&gt; When the rain comes, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the word of God has a quickening power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know but there is no change of specy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The wheat will remain wheat. &gt;&gt; Even if it is being tied. Amen. Being being irritated by the uh uh uh uh uh but that that other plants you know that tears. Hallelujah. It will remain wheat. But both of them will come to life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I in the parable wait until the end. Are we in the end, brothers and sisters? Hallelujah. So that's why because we're in this part of the age and we're living in the end time in the last part of the end time. Everything is in its full maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the bride is matured. &gt;&gt; It's maturing. It's in the process probably. But we are in that stage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why the quickening power of God, Amen, quickens not only the predestinated seed. In that way they will respond according to the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so that's why now they had taken the word of God and made it of none effect the people by teaching for traditions for uh the traditions of men. And if scribe, preachers, ministers, spiritual man, so-called anointed ones would only read the Bible, they wouldn't be wondering what's taking place. They would know what it is. God fulfilling his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Why do the denominations could not recognize Malachi 4? Amen. Revelation 10. Amen. It's being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But they are being quickened also by the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. so that this message will be rejected. &gt;&gt; They were moved. Amen. And and look when when they were moved, even when Jesus was arrested, when he was just right there. Amen. He they they maltreated him, blindfolded him, insulted him. And look, they also speak. Amen. And they and they and they uh they called the Lord king. Look at him king of the Jews. And they bowed their heads. &gt;&gt; They put him a crown of thorns. &gt;&gt; They say the same words. King of kings. Hallelujah. But there is something in them. Hallelujah. That is not genuine. But but those who are predestinated, they know. Amen. So when they were moved, Amen. How? Look at how they moved. Amen. They they blindfolded him, insulted him. Amen. mocked him, pulled his beard, and while he was blindfold said, "Tell us who we are, and we will believe you." Amen. They he they he knew he knew them, &gt;&gt; but they did not get what they were asking for &gt;&gt; because they had the wrong approach because they were moving differently because they had different uh spirits in them. And here those people that read the scripture day by day watch him come riding and and cry who is this God fulfilling his word to the people that should have known what it was but they didn't know it. When God fulfills his word it always causes an attraction always does causes an attraction for it is the unusual. So unusual when he fulfills his word to the modern trend of the day because the modern trend of the day don't believe in it they have their own way. Hallelujah. So now uh the Bible said in 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 21, for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of men, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So now when he came, look, when he came in in in in uh in the in in in the next uh let's go back in verse six, he said, "Now the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them." Of course, this is what the the pure called disciples. The disciples went as and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult. And this is I like this portion. Brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him there on. Now remember I'm showing you things here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Jesus rode only in one beast. But the instruction was loose them. Amen. The other was old, the other one was young. Amen. I hope you can see two generations here. Amen. So now brought the ass and the cult and put them their clothes and they set him there on. So let's go back to the question. He said, would the bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture? So it will be so humble. And in paragraph 76 now God fortified his army. Now it has something to do with garments. Now clothing covering. He said God fortified his army. What? With himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the form of prophets, apostles, teachers, pastors. What did he do? What was God doing? Listen. Did you ever think what that offices of the church is? It is God's dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm looking on that. So I'm looking at this sin in the scriptures as prophetic in the sense that everything that have happened now we're seeing some symbolical things being manifested in our day. Amen. for we don't know how long th those bees were being tied there but when the time came that the master will be using them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we don't know people they're just out there being tired of word the world being tired of their job being tired of everything. But if they are predestinated seed of God their time will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be running from the ministry. Brother Barry, brother Murvvin. Amen. We might have been on the same ship. Amen. We're tied with something. I was tied with my profession. I was tied with with something. My wife didn't want to marry a a minister because she was a daughter of a pastor, one of the pioneers of the message ministry in the Philippines. Amen. And she grew up in the message. Amen. And she grew up you know that you know all of them their lives all the people all the believer were watching them. Amen. As if they're being tied to something. We have to do this. We have to do that. We cannot do that. We cannot. Amen. They're be and at that time the ministry was so strong. Amen. When I first attended the message church Amen. I thought it was forbidden to laugh. because everybody looks serious. &gt;&gt; Amen. And my father-in-law, he he was so conservative. Amen. And and and so I thought how Amen. So So my wife was being tied with this principle. And so that why she said in her heart, I will not marry a minister. Amen. And when I came to the message, I am not interested because I was tied with my profession. I'm receiving one promotion to the other. Amen. And then we were telling I was telling at that time, Amen. Not not to brag, but I was a master teacher not only in the local school, but I was a master teacher in the whole division. Amen. I belong to the core group. Amen. Of uh uh teachers, training teachers. Amen. We're we're uh discovering new uh uh uh uh new trend, new skills, amen, of how to teach so that you know the the the students will not be bored of learning. Amen. And so you see but I was tied with those things. Amen. But time came. Amen. Time came. Lose them. Amen. I we were loose. So you see now here it comes now they are God's dress the pipled ministry they are God's dress &gt;&gt; and God fortified Amen his army through the pipled ministry &gt;&gt; amen and look at that the the disciples the two disciples being sent they they put their clothes their garments on top of that beast amen they clothe that beast so that Jesus will ride on that are you seeing something. Amen. So the pipel ministry, Amen. If you go on on Revelation chapter 19, the bride is dressed &gt;&gt; with a wedding garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. How is the bride being being uh h uh uh worn that kind of garment through the preaching of the word &gt;&gt; through the pipel ministry. That is our covering. Amen. Hallelujah. Adam in his pollen condition tried to cover their nakedness but it was not enough &gt;&gt; because of his his pollen condition. He knew that they had to be covered because it was already shameful for them to stand before God. Amen. But because of his spoiling condition, he was not able to make a garment to find a garment suitable for the their condition. But what God did, Amen. God removed that. Amen. And killed to sacrifice and and and and taken all those and uh uh uh skins and clothing them with with bloody coats of skins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now it's the same thing. So God has to train the Lord trained his disciples. Amen. And so in that way these disciples know how to dress the bride. &gt;&gt; They put their garments said now. Amen. They put on their garments to that beast. And look how what is that? It's God's dress. Not only God's dress look inside dress. Amen. The pipel ministry is God's dress inside dress. That's why I say I like this portion because you know uh we have you know inside dress and the inside is what touches the skin. It's the closest. Amen. Inside dress. What does that mean? The word is the flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Amen. And so if the body is the Lord Jesus Christ and the pipled ministry is God's dress and inside dress that means it is the one that embraces the skin. It is the one that embraces the reality of the word. Amen. They are the ones that have personal experiences with the word so that they when they preach the gospel when they preach the message of the hour their preaching is not only coming from their head but it is coming from their heart because it is their own experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So that's why this ministry because of their personal experiences they are able to dress the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as Morci dress Esther &gt;&gt; so that she knows how to conduct herself before the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, amen, it's God's dress inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a seer for see before Satan ever gets to it. Dan told it. What is it? God dress up in his church. These offices is God's dress wear. Glory. When you see those offices, pastors, teachers, evangelists, what is that? That is God's dress wear. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the ministry is a covering. The ministry is a protection for the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the offices is God's dress where when you see those offices, pastors, teachers, evangelists, what is that? That is God's dressear, God's presence, God's spirit working through man. Amen. Working through man, not any gadget. And if that office denies of this word, then it's not God dressing. &gt;&gt; No, not that. That's the wolf in sheep's clothing. Watch that fellow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So the pipel ministry has a great portion in fortifying the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So these are vindicated ministry of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And who is this? They ask who is this? Amen. Now, so you see when he come to Jerusalem, when he came to Jerusalem, uh you just try to imagine that he was entering into the city and he knew what will happen to him. We came here. I came here with all my excitement. Not because I'm a big or great preacher whatsoever. But I have come here with an excitement, with an anticipation that I'm meeting the people of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. By just meeting you, shaking your hand, hugging you brothers. Amen. And uh so it's something it's something that is so special because on the other side of the world and then you come here and then you come to realize we believe the same thing. We we stand on the same on the same principle. Amen. It's something that is a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Appreciate brother uh uh Demar and uh uh you know they have come here the the the brothers from Edmonton they have come here they traveled. What's that? It's not it's not because of brother Danny. Of course that's part of it. I'm stepping on the garment before it touches the the dirt. Amen. I thank God for that. Amen. We are privileged because of that. Amen. But on top of it, amen. You have come here because you're under anticipation because we want to hear the word of the Lord. Not the word of brother Danny, but the preaching of the word. We come here because we are so positive that when we go out of that door, Amen. We will not be the same again. &gt;&gt; We are better than yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so much positive. That's why we are we have come here probably. We have come here. Amen. We heard the pastor said, "Amen. Is there any unspoken prayer request? You have come here because you have something in your heart that that before the the meeting ends, God will answer the prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. And he knew he will be arrested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew he will suffer. He knew he will not only be weep with those bitterness, with those cruelties, &gt;&gt; so much hatred. But he came anyhow. He came anyhow. &gt;&gt; It's because of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know sometimes when we when we feel there is some kind of a danger sometimes it's better for us let us not go. Amen. But he did not forbid himself coming through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew how hard it will be. He knew he will die. He knew he will be crucified. Hallelujah. But it's because of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he said now he said they were under uh anticipation. Uh now he said now of course knowing what he was to be there and loved him the way they did. They were waiting for him. There were crowd that was probably pushing shoing from one gate to the other. One watching out in every way for they knew that one of the hours he would appear. They were watching. Oh, that's what's the matter today. The people who are looking for him coming is under great anticipation and expectations. We can feel it. The pressure and they're seeking watching every move and every sign comparing it with the scriptures. And when they seen all these things that was predicted of him right up to the end, they knew the end was nigh. They wanted to be there. So they watched. Part of the crowds was for him in the minority. Some were against him. Most of them 90% was against him. And that's about the way it is today in the religious crowds. When it really come down to the word and Christ, there's about 1% that would believe it. The other part would pay attention to it. No matter that was done, what was done? They would pass off some kind of a joke or throw Islam about it. Just about the same. Time things don't change very much. History just repeats itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go back to this two. As I said, Jesus was only riding for one. Why did he said loose them, saying unto them, go into the village, verse two, over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied and called with her. loose them and bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, the Lord had need of them, and straightway he will send them. And this is what I want to leave with you this evening. I see two generations here, amen, being present at that time. And this is a prophetic presentation that a part was fulfilled 2,000 years ago and the other part is being fulfilled today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that young ass 2,000 years ago, that young beast 2,000 years ago was just following. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just following where. Amen. Maybe when they were both tied. Amen. was asking, "Mama, you know, I'm see I I I see some other kids out there. They're just playing, jumping, you know." Amen. Why are we here being tied? Amen. But the answer would say, "Just answer. Our time will come. Our time will come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the day came. Hallelujah. So now when the when when that was fulfilled and let me put it this way this is the se the subtitle of my message being loosed for the master's use my subtitle is riding his trail again he said now in the message on the wings of a snow white dove he said why me an old man suffered all my life why did he heal me now I believe I'll ride this trail again &gt;&gt; amen I got to bring a message. And I say to my father tonight as junior seen in in a dream the other night of the wings of this dove moving in these windows here. Lord, your servants reporting for service. Amen. I'm ready. You know the prophets when Isaiah said, Amen. Behold, a virgin shall conceive. It was spoken by the prophet by a God's prophet but that was not his word. Amen. He was only a microphone like brother Brandham Amen referred to himself and he said so it's the same thing when he said I'll ride this trail again. I don't take it that he will rose from the dead and once again will go around the whole world and preach this message once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the eye here is not actually amen. It's the voice of the Lord. Amen. It's William Marian Branham in the flesh. But he only spoken what the word said. &gt;&gt; Amen. what the spirit said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I said I'll ride this trail again. It's not brother Benham per se. It's not brother Benham as a person. It's God riding the trail once again. Through whom? Through the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So that's why that young ass mean he was loose also but he was not used then. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's in symbolic form. Amen. 2,000 years have passed. And then in that prophetic principle, in that symbolic standard, we now see that once again there is a beast today, that young beast before is a matured beast today in the form of the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he, the Lord is riding once again. Amen. In this last day and age, amen, with the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now he said go. Amen. And so loose them. So that's why uh uh we see uh you see now he said in in the message who do you say this is your king comes to you upon the fall of banas and he slowly and meek that's how he come so remember there is always a transfer of ministry during the time of Moses Joshua came amen during the time of Elijah Elisha came all right so during our time the prophet of God is no longer here but the pipled ministry is present dressing the bride, &gt;&gt; fulfilling uh the uh uh continuing the ministry of Malachi 4. Hallelujah. Amen. Because it's God. It's the message of the Lord. Amen. And so here uh uh we see that what have happened before just like in Malachi 4. Amen. We have the Elijah before. Amen. So Luke in in 2 Kings chapter 2 10-14 in verse 10, he said, "Thou has asked a hard thing." So Elishah asked something. Elijah, what Elisha, what do you want? Amen. And Elisha said, I want a double portion of what you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and he said, "Thou has asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it shall not be so." This is very clear. If thou shalt see me go, Elijah, the original Elijah said, you have asked a hard thing, but if you shall see me taken up, &gt;&gt; if thou shalt see me go, Hallelujah. Our generation probably we have not sinned personally, brother Brandham. We have heard the message of God through him. Hallelujah. And now you know look looking back and now little by little one by one those who have personally walked with the prophet is now one by one coming off the scene. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a new generation coming in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we see that at that that the time the day and age that we are living in there is a transition. All right. We still believe the prophet because God has used him so mightily. But we have to accept the fact that the prophet is no longer on the scene. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is already a pipled ministry now. And that was Elijah said to Elisha, "If thou see me being taken out of the scene." So Elijah was watching the life of the prophet. Elisha was able to see when he was being taken by the flaming chariot. Hallelujah. This generation, hallelujah, have seen the fading h you know, we're not forgetting the man. We're not forgetting how humble he had presented the message of the hour. But we have to accept the fact that we're living in another in in in this generation. Amen. And this is the generation, hallelujah, that the baton had been passed to somebody else. And that is through the pipel ministry. Hallelujah. So he is riding the trail again through the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he said nevertheless he said shall but if not it shall not be so. Amen. And so later on he took up also look the mantle of Elijah. &gt;&gt; The garment of Elijah. &gt;&gt; There's nothing special to that. Amen. But that's a representation of something. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the water and said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" And when he also had smitten, the waters departed heighter and tighter. And Elisha went over. Amen. So he took the mantle. He took the garment. What did the Bible ministry took? Amen. Have taken the message of the hour. This is the mantle. Hallelujah. And when we and when when we we hit the water, when we spread the gospel of the hour, we say, "Where is the God of William Marian Brana?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not looking for the person. We will see him on the other side. He will present us. His gener is his generation. He said, "Will also Paul?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when when the boy said, "Yes." &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul will present his people in his generation. Well, I'm sure of that now because I preach what Paul preached. We're resting on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that means Amen. The the the mantle, the baton. Amen. The message of the hour still here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the message that that is what we are after. Amen. So that's why in in God commissioning Moses, Amen. Brother Bana made mention also Amen. Now notice then he said nevertheless if you see me go you'll have what you ask. So he walked on I can see him keeping his eye on that prophet. Amen. Oh I can hear him something. Oh Elijah look over this way. So he's always he was always watching. So it's the same thing. We are always watching. We appreciate the prophet. We appreciate we love the testimonies but we should have our own testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just like that uh uh baby of uh uh coming baby of Micah and Genesis. Amen. We have come into that in into that situation. Amen. The we're coming into brother Benham said after uh after God was pleased Amen. with with Haiti right I stopped because this is part of my preaching tomorrow. But anyway, there's no tomorrow. We don't know. So we said, so Haiti right was there. Amen. And he said, God was so pleased because you said the right thing. Amen. And said, say what you want and it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. And right said, I don't know what to say. Can you say it for me? But we are in another age. &gt;&gt; Haty have watched the prophet so much that she believed. Amen. Oh, brother Brennham, that's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; While others were saying, "Oh, it's too good to be true." But that innocent woman said, "Brother Brham, that's nothing but the truth, Brother Brenham." Amen. And so God was pleased. The Holy Spirit was pleased. And the voice was heard &gt;&gt; by Brother Benham. Tell that woman, tell her what she wants, and it will come to pass. Say it, &gt;&gt; Brother Benham. Can you say it for me? No, that's not the instruction. Say it. And brother Benham even gave him a suggestion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But she asked the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. She spoke for the salvation of her two sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and down low. Amen. In that statement, brother Benham said, "We are entering into that spear now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the bride now? Amen. We are in that. We are given we should have we are we are now we should be living the prophecy now the prophecy that was given by the prophet spoken by the prophet that the bride amen will will be in her rightful position. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can claim what is being promised for her day. Amen. This is the time that we are living in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because we're watching the life of the prophet, we're watching the the life being made manifest by this message of the hour. God has given us so much confidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you see the representation of that. It's no longer the prophet speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's the bride speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Benham, can you say it for me? Amen. We will come. We have come to the time. Amen. And brother, even you are alone, sister. Even if you are just right there. Amen. Remember that the Holy Spirit is omniresent because he knows, Amen. what's going on all over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows what's going on. He knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; But you have to have confidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That the voice is in you. &gt;&gt; The voice is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now, that's why he's saying now, Amen. after 2,000 years ago. Amen. That Amen. And and look at the picture. Look at that picture. Amen. Behind that ass. Amen. That was being being uh uh used by the Lord 2,000 years ago. That young ass was just following just like Elijah. Elisha always following Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, a good leader should be a good follower. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's just looking like there following following. And when his time came and the time is now, &gt;&gt; the beast that was young 2,000 years ago is the same beast today. &gt;&gt; Where the bride, Amen, who is the bride and the king is riding his trail again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this generation, it's Christ in the bride. It's Christ being made manifest. Hallelujah. Remember this. Amen. I preached this uh bread team last Wednesday. Amen. He said when John heard the voice, Amen. He said John Amen. Uh uh when he and then when he looked he he he said uh and when I turned he said he heard the voice, right? He heard the voice and then John said I turned to see the voice. &gt;&gt; That's right. Can you see the voice? &gt;&gt; You hear the voice? &gt;&gt; Amen. But he John turned to see the voice. &gt;&gt; Now check your Bible. What did John saw when he turned to see the voice? He saw the seven golden candlesticks. &gt;&gt; What is that? The church, the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So where is the voice? In the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So people will be you know they they they will love Amen. They they we appreciate the word we testify. Amen. You know but people the bride John types the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we preach the word when we share the message of the hour the bride will attract the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. That when they turn to see the voice they will see the bride. That's me. That's like me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Because the voice is in the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're looking for a person, looking for a true witness of the word, looking for somebody. Brother said, "Sometimes we are good in debating this message, but we're not leaving it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now that's the condition. So our time, Amen. our time has come. Amen. And and and and now is that's why you see these two generation. Amen. the two generation now the the again the the the the fold that was young at that time is no longer young in this day and age it's already matured and we are representing it because the power that is in the bride now as we approach the conclusion now he said in Ephesians chapter 4 8 and 9 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. Now we we connect that to 2 Corinthians 3:17. Now the Lord is that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is &gt;&gt; there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bam said in the church ages they have bound the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because of their creeds and dogmas. &gt;&gt; The spirit cannot move. &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit cannot move. But the time came, hallelujah, through the ministry. Amen. Through the prophecy that the Holy Spirit was being released. Amen. When the seals were broken, Amen. the power of God had been released as well. &gt;&gt; But remember, Amen. when he open up every seal. Amen. Amen. The uh the the horse rider is also coming out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he opened the first seal, Amen. The white horse came out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's one riding on it. So, as as we are receiving the full revelation, Amen. We're also receiving the full manifestation of the word of God, but the full power of hell is also coming out. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is war. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But you see where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Remember you know that I like that illustration of brother Brennan you know when he uh came down when his spirit when he you know in the flesh the spirit separated and he went down to the lower parts. Amen. To the souls that were in prison. Amen. And what a very nice illustration. He knocked every every door and he was introducing himself. Amen. My blood is still fresh up there at the &gt;&gt; in Calvary. Hallelujah. Amen. And he went down and all the saints. Amen. That's why I say the first revival happened in hell. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of God came down. Amen. And where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he unlock all the doors. And that's why all the saints in the Old Testament were being released. Amen. Hallelujah. Uh uh from Adam, Amen. All these saints, Amen. in the Old Testament, they have seen the fulfillment of the prophecy. They were only preaching a prophecy. Amen. Because no one uh uh had been forgiven during the Old Testament &gt;&gt; because the blood of bulls and goats cannot forgive sin. &gt;&gt; It can only cover sin. So the sins were there. So they had to offer year by year and they had to repeat it again. But there's no bornagain experience. Amen. But where the spirit of God there is liberty. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the the spirit of God came down, Amen. in the pits of hell, &gt;&gt; there was liberty. &gt;&gt; There was rejoicing. They could not hold them anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so graves were open and they were seen by many because where the spirit of there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And so that's why everything was loose. Amen. And everybody Amen. came out. Amen. And so uh uh uh when the in his resurrection there were also spirits amen that were casted out amen even from from Mary brother Benham said amen. So in John 8:36 and this is my last verse now if the son therefore shall make you free shall be free &gt;&gt; indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So lose them. So sometimes if you see there are many implications there. Sometimes we're waiting for God to use us. But there's virtue in waiting. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That young ass, he just kept on following. Never overtook. I'm stronger. I have more revelated. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm the third generation message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Peter and John. Amen. John because John was younger and Peter was older. He was senior. But they have heard the news. Amen. That the tomb was opened and the body of Jesus wasn't there anymore. Amen. They ran together. But John was young. So he went ahead. Amen. But with due respect, he could have entered directly. But he waited for this Peter. Peter, &gt;&gt; he let Peter come first. Amen. He could have taken the first revelation. Amen. But he asked the older one, "Come in, Peter." Hallelujah. So that young ass, he just kept on following following. But when his generation came when our time comes that the Lord will use us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if we're not a minister, said the the pipled ministry, it composes the bride as a hood. We all have our participation. We're not just visitors here. We bear the burden together. &gt;&gt; We're part of the team. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, there was um an illustration one time. Amen. There was an ass or a horse that was tied in a uh in a in a post and probably uh there was about 4 m of rope that he was tied with. And so every time every morning so he he he wake up and he's tied in that post. So he walk but he cannot go farther than four meters. So what he does he go around that's the only circle he goes around every day of his life. So when he goes at the he close to the to the post then he go back again. Amen. But he cannot go farther from the 4 m rope. That's how far he can go because he's tied all his life. And that's the only limitation he had. That's the only thing that he could see. Amen. because that's how he grew up with that circle. That's how far he goes. Amen. But one day, somebody is watching and he pitted the the horse and he cut secretly the rope. Amen. So one morning that horse stood up and he made he made a a mark already. So that's why all his life he was going through those marks and it's just automatic you know so in uh in the afternoon he goes back amen and he go that circle and because he used he is being used to that distance only and he was used to just walking through that circle that mark that he made all his life. He could not go farther because he didn't realize the rope was cut already. Amen. &gt;&gt; But maybe one day his lead and he went farther from 4 mters and he looked. Amen. He was farther than the daily circle. Amen. And he stood up and he went farther. Amen. And he went farther and farther and he said, "I'm free." All his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe all his life we're just sitting in the pew. Amen. We're just hearing things. Amen. Repeatedly. Repeat. And we're just, you know, sometimes we we we are challenged. We are faced with something. Amen. And and we cannot overcome it. And then we fall. Amen. And then we go up again. Amen. And then we realize, Amen. But when we when we have that personal experience of the Holy Spirit when the spirit of God is there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Now you have an experience. Amen. Before Amen. I used to hear I used to share the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that was the first thing that I have learned. That was the first thing that I have accepted. So every time I share no matter what kind of discussion I always go back to the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. When I learned about the mystery of the new birth, I found out what's what's reality. Amen. About the original sin. Oh, everywhere I go. Amen. Because I grew up as a Catholic. I came directly from Catholic to the message of the hour. Amen. So everywhere I go, it's not an apple. It's not an apple. Amen. But later on, I go further. Amen. The first seal is being open. Second seal is being open. I go further and farther. And now say, I'll pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing. Hallelujah. In our daily life, in our daily living, sometimes we're being tired. Sometimes we do the same thing again. Sometimes we fall on the same challenges again. But let me announce, let me declare to you that we're free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes our experiences before, oh, I was this before, I cannot go away from it. You're so tired. You're so bound with it. You always blame yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're free. &gt;&gt; We're being justified. &gt;&gt; As if you have not done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; We We're free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes people, oh, I have something with this brother. I have something with this brother, with this sister. We're being tied with it. And that will fall. Amen. in that kindness and and if we're not be careful, it will fall down to bitterness, hatred. You will be bound again. But where the spirit of God is, there's liberty. &gt;&gt; We're free. We we can rejoice. &gt;&gt; We can always worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're children of freedom &gt;&gt; because where the spirit of God is, there is liberty &gt;&gt; all our lives. Amen. We've been tied to something. We're bound. We're being bound by the religious I was telling uh uh uh your pastor, brother Barry, I I'm still here and there is already island in the Philippines in Romelon Island where I conducted mystery exposition in 2018. I received a a a message through messenger and said, "Pastor Danny, I hope you remember us." Amen. Uh would you help us? Amen. Because uh uh uh uh uh uh time have come. Amen. Uh and I I even forgot them because when I shared this message in 2018 in that island, so many said, "Where are you from? Where was the last time I met you? I forgive me, but I may be old." Amen. And Honestly, I've forgotten already. And he said, "Oh, you conducted this exposition here in the island and it's three hours from Manila by land and then you you take two hour and a half, you go to the island of Brlon. It's a separate island. It's a beautiful island also like Palawan." Amen. So, we have the best marbles there, RMLon, right? Amen. So, you see, I went there and said, "Oh, I see." Because two 2018 I conducted uh mystery expo there and I had a very nice feeling because the the ministers they said after the the two days presentation uh they said uh pastor Danny you know we really appreciate because we have not seen the book of revelation presented that way before but they have a very strong organization and they have a very influential bishop that they were under in amen and so that leader probably prevented me from coming back. So I forgot. Amen. But two weeks ago, Amen. He said, "Pastor Danny, dur even during pandemic, we we we we we stream some of your services and we're so enlightened." Brother Danny, please go back help us because we are ready to come out of the denomination. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; two pastors. Hallelujah. Amen. and just sew the seed. &gt;&gt; I still believe in predestination. It's not our doing, it's God's doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now I see. Amen. Where there is the spirit of God is there is always liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. They want to be used and they want to be put used of by the master. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes we can be more in uh uh instrumental if we can just yield ourselves. Brother said we need to be flexible. &gt;&gt; We need to be like you know to be plant and you know because God wants us to be used for his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So would you this evening amen declare I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free. &gt;&gt; You're free. Whatever you have you know. Amen. There must be something you must be you might you might have a sickness. Amen. You might have something in you. I don't know but God knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that God can use us more &gt;&gt; so that he can ride his trail again. &gt;&gt; Let us all stand up as I call on our musician. Amen. And if our song leader can can help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing that song. Thank God &gt;&gt; I'm free. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank God I am free. Would you bow our heads your head this evening? Amen. This dear heavenly father. &gt;&gt; You're so good to us Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. These things Lord God because you're you're we're looking through the eyes of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're seeing things and this Bible is becoming far becoming more a new Bible to us. Lord, you know who we are. &gt;&gt; You know what we are standing for. You know what we are doing, Lord. Amen. But deep inside, we want to be useful for your glory. But Lord, if there is anything that my ma that my brother, my sister is going through, whatever he or she is being tied up, Lord, may you cut that robe. Hallelujah. Oh Lord Jesus, we want freedom for your glory. May you use this church. May you use our pastor over here. All the elders, everyone that are gifted, the musicians, the singers, everyone, Lord God, every part of this congregation. May we serve you with full liberty and freedom. &gt;&gt; We're free, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're free. Sometimes we just don't realize how free we are. Sometimes we we just take for granted what you have done for us. Sometimes Lord, it is our own perception, our own prerogative, our own prejudice, Lord, that keeps us from doing more for your glory. Oh Lord, may everything Lord Jesus, may you break every chain, Father. &gt;&gt; Whatever is preventing us that we can be more useful for your glory. Lord God, may we declare this afternoon, Lord. &gt;&gt; That we are free and we are thankful. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, may you once again, Hallelujah. Amen. As the prophet said, you will ride this trail again, Lord. use us &gt;&gt; in any way, &gt;&gt; whether it's small or big. Lord, make full use of us. We're willing, Lord. We're willing. Thank you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's thank the Lord. And let's sing this song. God bless you. Pray for brother Danny. Amen. Hallelujah.
