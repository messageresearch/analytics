[57:06] know we have choices we can make choices
[57:09] and uh the choices that we make declare
[57:13] who we are amen but the interesting part
[57:15] about that is sometimes we just make bad
[57:18] choices as
[57:20] humans but we know the Lord is always
[57:22] forgiving he's always willing to help us
[57:25] and and uh yeah we're just certainly
[57:27] thankful for the the ministry brother
[57:30] Cadre he's been a real blessing to the
[57:31] assembly here over the years and
[57:34] certainly enjoyed having him here we uh
[57:37] just have a few announcements we've got

[58:35] anyways um if I seem nervous about it if
[58:38] I seem uneasy about it I do feel uneasy
[58:40] about it but I I just have to go like I
[58:43] said with the leadership of the Lord so
[58:45] we'll trust something will be a blessing
[58:47] to someone somehow in lie of me being
[58:50] here we have Sunday March the 2nd
[58:53] brother John panicker is going to take
[58:55] the service
[58:56] Wednesday March the 5th we're going to

[59:05] 12:26 it's an hour and 50ish minutes so
[59:10] uh prepare for a long
[59:11] service no I wouldn't do that I wouldn't
[59:15] do that at all we'll just play maybe
[59:16] half an hour of it uh on top of the
[59:18] service maybe we'll just find a a good
[59:21] spot to stop it and then we'll pick up
[59:23] and do it again once I return uh I do
[59:26] plan to get into church order preaching
[59:28] on it but for now we'll just uh we'll
[59:31] just say what the prophet said and uh
[59:33] let him say it and we'll get into
[59:35] talking about a little bit later so uh
[59:37] the second we have brother John panicker
[59:40] uh the fifth which is Wednesday we have
[59:43] uh the church order and then on the 7th
[59:46] we have the prayer meeting and then
[59:48] Sunday March the 9th brother Toby is
[59:51] going to take the service for us so we
[59:53] certainly thank the brothers for
[59:54] stepping in and putting their shoulders
[59:56] to the wheel and ministering What the
[59:58] Lord Has put on their hearts we have uh
[1:00:02] yeah a tremendous uh blessing of gifts
[1:00:06] in the body musically and ministerially
[1:00:10] if that's even a word I I just think
[1:00:12] it's wonderful to see so many brothers
[1:00:14] with a desire to minister so pray for
[1:00:17] our brothers if you could pray for me
[1:00:19] that the Lord will just settle it in my
[1:00:21] heart what uh the purpose is for going
[1:00:24] and uh we certainly will'll thank the
[1:00:28] Lord for his Tender
[1:00:30] Mercies last week we uh left
[1:00:33] off uh in the church age book in the
[1:00:36] leoan church
[1:00:37] age talking about elective love I'm just
[1:00:40] going to pick up from that that
[1:00:42] paragraph right after Romans
[1:00:44] 9911 and brother bradam well maybe I'll
[1:00:48] just read Romans 9:11 here it says for
[1:00:50] the children not being born neither
[1:00:52] having done any good or evil that the
[1:00:55] purpose of God according to election
[1:00:57] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:01:02] calleth now brother Bram in here he says
[1:01:05] this love is elective love it is his
[1:01:09] love for his elect and his love for them
[1:01:13] is apart from Human Merit so there's
[1:01:16] nothing that we can do to make him love
[1:01:18] us more or to make him love us
[1:01:21] less it's elective love am that's just
[1:01:26] so
[1:01:27] powerful and his love for them is apart
[1:01:29] from Human Merit for it is for it says
[1:01:32] that the purpose of God stands in
[1:01:36] election which is exactly opposite to
[1:01:40] works or anything man has in
[1:01:43] himself because before the children were
[1:01:46] born he had already said Jacob have I
[1:01:50] loved but Esau have I
[1:01:53] hated and now he says to own as many as
[1:01:56] I love I rebuke and
[1:02:00] chasen to rebuke is to
[1:02:04] reprove to reprove is to expose with a
[1:02:08] view to
[1:02:10] correction chasen does not mean
[1:02:14] punish it means discipline because the
[1:02:17] subject's amendment is in mind this is
[1:02:21] exactly what we find in Hebrews I think
[1:02:25] it's so amazing when we read this
[1:02:27] because if you look at it what what he's
[1:02:31] trying to express here is that God isn't
[1:02:34] looking to just slap us around like a
[1:02:37] dictator he's looking to correct us to
[1:02:40] go the right
[1:02:41] way but many times in a denominational
[1:02:45] spin the devil will creep in to the
[1:02:47] framework of the Christian church and
[1:02:50] cause it to become lukewarm formal and
[1:02:52] Powerless because it feels like we can
[1:02:53] never really succeed his love is
[1:02:57] elective if we're elected then we're
[1:02:59] elected period we can't make ourselves
[1:03:02] elected and we can't make ourselves Not
[1:03:05] Elected it's such an amazing thought but
[1:03:08] we will always choose the right way if
[1:03:10] we are elected amen amen we will always
[1:03:14] do that and the right way is going to be
[1:03:16] according to God's word but I just love
[1:03:19] this thought because it doesn't mean
[1:03:20] that you know if we leave service
[1:03:22] tonight and we go and sin We Fall Down
[1:03:25] down we have a problem in our life he's
[1:03:28] not going to take us and crush us and
[1:03:31] force us to love
[1:03:33] him he's going to love us and through
[1:03:37] that we're going to love him now I'm not
[1:03:39] saying God is not a just God he ain't a
[1:03:42] Doty old grandpa that's just going to
[1:03:44] sit up in heaven in another dimension
[1:03:46] and say it's okay you don't have to
[1:03:48] worry about it have some candy no no
[1:03:50] he's going to say I'm going to judge you
[1:03:52] according to my word and because you're
[1:03:54] elected you're going to behave according
[1:03:55] to my word and if you don't behave
[1:03:57] according to my word then are you
[1:03:59] elected that's really the age in which
[1:04:01] we're living in and that's where we get
[1:04:03] to tonight I think it's really powerful
[1:04:05] it's such a wonderful thing and you know
[1:04:09] I think that this church age book what
[1:04:10] it does for me I just have to tell you
[1:04:12] my heart is it shows me what it means to
[1:04:15] be
[1:04:16] redeemed the entirety of this book from
[1:04:18] the beginning up until where we're at
[1:04:20] right now it just shows redeemed
[1:04:22] redeemed redeemed redeemed and when we
[1:04:25] get that Revelation about being redeemed
[1:04:27] we understand that he is our Heavenly
[1:04:30] lover amen he does not want to abuse us
[1:04:33] he doesn't want to mistreat us he
[1:04:35] doesn't want to punish us he just wants
[1:04:38] to correct us so we'll go the right way
[1:04:41] am what a loving
[1:04:44] father Hebrews
[1:04:47] 125-1 and ye have forgotten the exort
[1:04:49] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[1:04:52] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:04:56] my son despise not thou the chastening
[1:04:59] of the Lord nor faint when thou art
[1:05:02] rebuked of
[1:05:04] him I just want to throw this out there
[1:05:08] just for the sake of discussion how do
[1:05:10] we become chastened or rebuked by the
[1:05:14] Lord how does that happen now I'm not
[1:05:17] going to answer it I want to let that
[1:05:19] linger I want us to think about that
[1:05:21] when the chastening of the Lord or the
[1:05:23] rebuking of the Lord comes how does that
[1:05:28] happen for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:05:31] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[1:05:35] he
[1:05:36] receiveth and if you endure chastening
[1:05:39] if you're willing to actually endure it
[1:05:42] God deal with you as with the son for
[1:05:45] what son is he whom the father
[1:05:48] chasteneth not but if ye be without
[1:05:53] chastisement whereof all are part
[1:05:55] partakers then ye are bastards and not
[1:05:58] sons that means you have no father
[1:06:01] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:06:03] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:06:06] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:06:08] be in subjection unto the father of
[1:06:10] spirits and live for they verily for a
[1:06:14] few days chasen us after our own
[1:06:16] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[1:06:20] might be partakers of his Holiness yes
[1:06:24] now no chastening for the present seeth
[1:06:26] to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless
[1:06:30] afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of
[1:06:34] Love Of Joy Of Peace of longsuffering
[1:06:38] gentleness goodness Faith meekness and
[1:06:40] Temperance yes the fruit of the spirit
[1:06:44] the Peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:06:47] unto them which are exercised
[1:06:51] thereby herein is now set forth the love
[1:06:54] of God
[1:06:56] he desired in love a family of his
[1:07:00] own a family of Sons Sons like himself
[1:07:05] yes therefore before him lies all
[1:07:08] mankind as one lump of
[1:07:11] clay now out of that same
[1:07:13] lump he will now make vessels unto honor
[1:07:18] and unto
[1:07:19] dishonor the choosing will be his own
[1:07:23] choosing amen
[1:07:25] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:07:28] spirit will be trained to conform to His
[1:07:32] Image in their
[1:07:34] walk isn't that
[1:07:36] beautiful and you know brothers and
[1:07:38] sisters he's not saying that it's going
[1:07:39] to be that we're not going to maybe walk
[1:07:42] with a bounce in our step or we're going
[1:07:43] to change the way we walk it's not that
[1:07:45] at all it's that we're going to walk
[1:07:47] according to the word of God in our
[1:07:48] lives we're going to conduct ourselves
[1:07:50] according to the word of God in our
[1:07:52] lives whether it's in school whether
[1:07:54] it's at home whe whether it's at work
[1:07:56] whether it's in church that's what we're
[1:07:58] going to do that's the walk he's talking
[1:08:00] about he reproves with all longsuffering
[1:08:03] and gentleness and mercy he chastens
[1:08:06] with nail scarred hands amen can you
[1:08:10] imagine what it's going to be like to
[1:08:11] shake the hand of
[1:08:15] Jesus sometimes I shake hands and I'll
[1:08:18] use my second hand just to give a little
[1:08:19] extra
[1:08:20] love can you imagine what that would be
[1:08:23] like to hold that hand and to feel it to
[1:08:26] look at it and to think that that's
[1:08:28] actually the
[1:08:29] hands that that that corrected me why he
[1:08:34] chastens with nail scarred hands
[1:08:36] sometimes this Potter must take the
[1:08:38] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[1:08:41] break it down in order that he may
[1:08:45] rebuild it exactly as he desires
[1:08:49] it but it is love that is his love
[1:08:54] another way of his love
[1:08:56] there is not there cannot
[1:08:59] be so I just can say this when we go
[1:09:02] through the trial it's his
[1:09:04] love it's that elected love amen that we
[1:09:08] read about there he says oh little flock
[1:09:11] do not fear this age is fast closing as
[1:09:14] it does those tears will be bound
[1:09:16] together and as a threefold cord is not
[1:09:20] easily broken that's out of Proverbs
[1:09:22] they will have a tremendous threefold
[1:09:24] strength
[1:09:26] of political physical and
[1:09:29] spiritual satanical power yes and they
[1:09:34] will seek to destroy the bride of
[1:09:37] Christ she will suffer but she will
[1:09:40] endure amen fear not those things that
[1:09:43] are coming upon the Earth for he John
[1:09:47] 13:1 having loved his own which were in
[1:09:49] the world he loved them unto the end am
[1:09:53] and we know we read that just before for
[1:09:55] the communion service amen he loved them
[1:09:58] unto the end yes be zealous and repent
[1:10:02] now this false church has Zeal make no
[1:10:05] mistake about that her Zeal has
[1:10:09] literally been that of the Jews the Zeal
[1:10:12] of thine house hath eaten me up John
[1:10:16] 2:17 but it is a wrong
[1:10:20] Zeal for it is the house of their own
[1:10:23] building it is for their own Creeds
[1:10:27] dogmas
[1:10:28] organizations their own righteousness I
[1:10:31] say Lord let there not be any
[1:10:33] righteousness of my own be found in me
[1:10:35] but let it be yours because we know that
[1:10:38] ourselves are but filthy rags before him
[1:10:43] our own
[1:10:45] righteousness he says they have put the
[1:10:47] word out for their own
[1:10:50] ideas their own
[1:10:52] ideas they deposed the whole Holy Ghost
[1:10:56] and made men into
[1:10:58] leaders that's why the Holy Ghost leads
[1:11:00] the church that's why every church is
[1:11:03] Sovereign they have put aside eternal
[1:11:05] life as a person and make it good works
[1:11:10] or even Church
[1:11:12] Conformity rather than good works how
[1:11:14] many people have actually seen churches
[1:11:16] in the message that make Church
[1:11:18] Conformity rather than good works my but
[1:11:22] God is calling for another Zeal isn't
[1:11:24] that beautiful
[1:11:25] it is the Zeal to cry I am
[1:11:30] wrong now who is going to say that he's
[1:11:34] wrong what is it that all these
[1:11:37] denominations are based upon the claim
[1:11:40] to
[1:11:40] originality and that of God the claim
[1:11:44] that they are
[1:11:46] right now they all cannot be right in
[1:11:50] fact not one of them is right they are
[1:11:53] Whited selers full of Dead Man's Bones
[1:11:57] they have no life they have no
[1:12:00] Vindication God has never made himself
[1:12:03] known in any
[1:12:04] organization they say they are right
[1:12:07] because they are the ones that are
[1:12:10] saying it but saying it doesn't make it
[1:12:13] so and it doesn't matter how many people
[1:12:15] say it right it doesn't make it
[1:12:21] right they need the Vindicated thus say
[1:12:25] the Lord of God and they don't have
[1:12:30] it I was just going over this and I was
[1:12:32] thinking isn't it amazing to think that
[1:12:35] there was a thus sayith the Lord given
[1:12:36] to the world but it was thoroughly
[1:12:39] rejected there was a thus sayith the
[1:12:41] Lord given to Israel in Jerusalem but
[1:12:44] they thoroughly rejected it and you know
[1:12:46] the thus sayith the Lord even came when
[1:12:49] their city was under siege and they
[1:12:52] rejected
[1:12:53] it the thus sayith the Lord in that day
[1:12:56] said hey if you just go out and
[1:12:57] surrender yourself humble yourself in
[1:13:00] the sight of the Lord to the king out
[1:13:02] there and what will happen is you'll be
[1:13:04] a slave for the rest of your life but
[1:13:06] you'll
[1:13:07] live but they couldn't do it they would
[1:13:12] not
[1:13:14] my I think it's amazing it's it's human
[1:13:18] nature outside of the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:13:20] Lives that's us right that's right
[1:13:23] outside of the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:13:25] that Is Us full of Dead Man's Bones we
[1:13:28] have no life we have no Vindication God
[1:13:31] has never made himself known to us
[1:13:33] because we have our own organization I
[1:13:35] so thank the the the ministry of brother
[1:13:38] Ken bringing that thought it will never
[1:13:40] leave me that we can be a denomination
[1:13:42] of one I can have my views and my ideas
[1:13:46] about this message of the hour and
[1:13:47] nobody can change me because I can say
[1:13:49] that I feel
[1:13:50] led but if we feel led it's going to be
[1:13:53] according to the word it will not be
[1:13:55] outside of the word so when we see
[1:13:57] someone saying I feel led and it's
[1:13:59] contrary to the
[1:14:00] word guess
[1:14:03] what I want to say this I believe that
[1:14:06] it's the
[1:14:07] Lord chastening the Lord reproving amen
[1:14:11] because sometimes we can get Wayward
[1:14:14] sometimes we can go astray every one of
[1:14:16] us all of us have gone astray but it's
[1:14:20] the Lord that does it for us they say
[1:14:22] they are right because they are the one
[1:14:24] saying it but saying it doesn't make it
[1:14:26] so they need the Vindicated thus saith
[1:14:29] the Lord of God and they don't have it
[1:14:31] now let me say this here I don't believe
[1:14:33] that God is calling only to the false
[1:14:35] Church to repent
[1:14:38] right in this verse he's calling to his
[1:14:41] elect amen they have some repenting to
[1:14:44] do
[1:14:45] too many of his children are still in
[1:14:48] those false churches they are those of
[1:14:53] whom it speaks in Ephesians 5:4 14 awake
[1:14:56] thou that sleepest and arise from the
[1:14:57] dead and Christ shall give thee light we
[1:15:00] talked many times about the five wise
[1:15:02] and the five unwise virgins all of them
[1:15:05] were virgins all of them had oil all of
[1:15:07] them slumbered and
[1:15:10] slept but only five of them half of them
[1:15:13] had enough oil and we know the oil
[1:15:16] typifies the Holy Ghost amen that's why
[1:15:19] we come to church so we could just get
[1:15:21] that little tiny filling every time just
[1:15:23] a little more Lord just a little more
[1:15:25] Lord just a little more Lord here's my
[1:15:27] cup I lift it up fill my cup Lord I just
[1:15:29] need a little more there's a desire to
[1:15:32] have enough oil cuz without enough oil
[1:15:34] our lamps will go out and we know what
[1:15:37] happens amen when that judgment call
[1:15:40] comes forward Behold The Bride
[1:15:42] bridegrooms come enter in amen some of
[1:15:46] the people are going to be saying but I
[1:15:48] just don't have enough oil and it's
[1:15:50] going to be so sad because there's an
[1:15:52] abundance of oil oh my
[1:15:56] there's a fountain open in the House of
[1:16:00] David brother BR he goes on to say to be
[1:16:03] asleep is not to be dead isn't that
[1:16:07] beautiful these are sleeping amongst the
[1:16:10] dead they are out there in the dead
[1:16:12] denominations they are floating along
[1:16:15] with them God cries wake up repent of
[1:16:18] your
[1:16:19] Folly here they are lending their
[1:16:21] influence giving their time and their
[1:16:24] money Act actually their very lives to
[1:16:27] these Antichrist organizations and all
[1:16:30] the while thinking it's
[1:16:32] right they need to repent they must
[1:16:35] repent they need to have a change of
[1:16:37] mind and turn toward the truth but you
[1:16:41] know it's it's interesting because I
[1:16:43] just every time I hear that I just can't
[1:16:45] help but think of that that story of the
[1:16:48] truth that would set him free standing
[1:16:51] right in front of pilate and pilate
[1:16:54] saying what is truth right exactly man
[1:16:58] I'm a leader I'm a boss I can tell
[1:17:00] people to come I can tell people to go I
[1:17:01] got it all we've got it all going on I'm
[1:17:04] rich increased with Goods I have need of
[1:17:06] nothing I have the power to take your
[1:17:08] life or to set you
[1:17:11] free but I can't see
[1:17:13] truth my some people are
[1:17:16] blind amen the rain falls on the just
[1:17:20] and the unjust just exactly
[1:17:23] alike my they need to repent they must
[1:17:26] repent they need to have a change of
[1:17:27] mind and turn towards the truth yes this
[1:17:31] is the age that most needs to repent but
[1:17:34] will
[1:17:35] it will it bring back the word will it
[1:17:39] again enthrone the holy spirit in men's
[1:17:42] lives will it again rever Jesus as the
[1:17:47] only savior I say not for the next verse
[1:17:51] reveals the astounding and shocking
[1:17:53] truth of the close of this age
[1:17:57] Revelations 3:20 to 22 behold I stand at
[1:18:00] the door and knock If any man hear my
[1:18:03] voice and open the door I will come into
[1:18:05] him and will Su with him and he with me
[1:18:09] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:18:12] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:18:15] overcame and am set down with my father
[1:18:18] in his
[1:18:19] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:18:22] what the spirit saith unto the
[1:18:26] churches now there's a great deal of
[1:18:28] confusion over this
[1:18:32] verse because so many personal workers
[1:18:35] use it in personal
[1:18:37] evangelism as though Jesus were at the
[1:18:40] hearts door of every sinner knocking for
[1:18:44] admission it would then be said that if
[1:18:46] the sinner opened the door the Lord
[1:18:49] would come
[1:18:50] in but this verse is not talking to
[1:18:53] individual sinners
[1:18:55] this whole message has a summation as
[1:18:59] does every message in every age in verse
[1:19:02] 22 it says he that hath an ear let him
[1:19:05] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:19:08] churches so this is the message to the
[1:19:11] Church of the last age it is the
[1:19:14] condition of the leodan church as its
[1:19:17] end near it is not a personal message to
[1:19:20] one person it is to this it is the
[1:19:23] spirit telling us us where Jesus is
[1:19:27] Christ has left the
[1:19:29] church that's such a strong statement my
[1:19:33] it is not the logical result or end if
[1:19:37] the word is put aside for creed sorry is
[1:19:41] this not The Logical result or end if
[1:19:45] the word is put aside for Creed the Holy
[1:19:49] Spirit deposed for popes Bishops
[1:19:53] presidents coun C ilor
[1:19:57] Etc and the savior is set aside for a
[1:20:00] Works
[1:20:02] program or church
[1:20:04] joining or some type of Conformity to a
[1:20:07] church
[1:20:08] system what more can be done against him
[1:20:11] this is
[1:20:13] apostasy this is the falling
[1:20:16] away it's so strange because if you look
[1:20:19] at the way he's describing the church
[1:20:22] they're not falling away they're
[1:20:24] Gathering together and and and doing
[1:20:26] great Mighty works even in his
[1:20:30] name but we know we just read that he's
[1:20:33] left the church
[1:20:35] my this is the open door to
[1:20:39] Antichrist for if one came in his
[1:20:42] father's name Jesus and was not received
[1:20:44] but rejected then there will come
[1:20:47] another with his own
[1:20:49] name liar in Brackets liar a Pretender
[1:20:56] in
[1:20:57] Brackets and him they will receive John
[1:21:00] 5:34 the man of sin that son of
[1:21:03] predition will take
[1:21:05] over you know brothers and sisters
[1:21:07] that's not just in the church as a whole
[1:21:10] that's in men's
[1:21:11] Hearts Matthew 24 mentions signs in the
[1:21:15] heavens concerning the last day just
[1:21:17] before Jesus comes I wonder if you
[1:21:19] noticed such a sign recently fulfilled
[1:21:22] as to portray the very truth we have
[1:21:24] been discussing that truth is that Jesus
[1:21:28] has been steadily pushed aside until the
[1:21:31] last age he has pushed outside the
[1:21:35] church recall that in the first age it
[1:21:37] was almost a full orbit Church of Truth
[1:21:41] yet there was a little error called the
[1:21:44] Deeds of the
[1:21:45] nicians that kept the circle from being
[1:21:47] full and remember when you have the the
[1:21:49] nians the Conquering the the Ley niiko
[1:21:53] leans when you have that you also have
[1:22:23] bmismart the church shines in the
[1:22:26] reflected Light of
[1:22:28] Christ but he is the
[1:22:31] sun isn't it beautiful that in
[1:22:34] 1965 brother bradam preached it is the
[1:22:37] rising of the Sun not s n s o n amen
[1:22:44] because there comes a time where the
[1:22:46] Church of the Living God is no longer
[1:22:48] going to reflect
[1:22:50] God oh my they're going to be God
[1:22:55] H the literal manifestation of God back
[1:22:58] on Earth again the church is the moon
[1:23:01] thus this orb of light is the Moon it
[1:23:03] had decreased from almost a full moon in
[1:23:07] the first age to a sliver in the fourth
[1:23:09] age but the fifth age it began to grow
[1:23:12] in the sixth age it took a great step of
[1:23:14] growth forward in part of the seventh
[1:23:17] age it was still growing when suddenly
[1:23:19] it stopped short and waned almost to
[1:23:23] nothingness so that instead of light it
[1:23:26] was Blackness of apostasy and at the end
[1:23:28] of the age it had ceased to shine for
[1:23:31] Darkness had taken
[1:23:33] over Christ was now outside the church
[1:23:36] here is the sign in the
[1:23:40] sky the last eclipse of the moon was a
[1:23:43] total
[1:23:44] eclipse it waned to a total darkness in
[1:23:48] seven stages in the seventh stage the
[1:23:52] total darkness came as the the pope of
[1:23:55] Rome Paul v 6 went to Palestine to make
[1:23:58] a holy tour of
[1:24:00] Jerusalem he was the first pope to ever
[1:24:02] go to Jerusalem the pope is named Paul I
[1:24:05] 6 Paul was the first messenger and this
[1:24:10] man goes by that
[1:24:12] name excuse me notice it is the sixth or
[1:24:16] the number of a
[1:24:18] man this is more than a coincidence and
[1:24:21] he went to Jerusalem the moon or the
[1:24:24] Church went into total darkness this is
[1:24:28] it this is the end this generation shall
[1:24:32] not pass away until all be fulfilled
[1:24:35] even so Lord Jesus come
[1:24:41] quickly now we can see why there were
[1:24:44] two Vines one true one
[1:24:48] false now we can see why Abraham had two
[1:24:52] sons one after the flesh that persecuted
[1:24:57] Isaac and one after the
[1:25:00] promise now we can see that how that
[1:25:04] sorry now we can see how that out of the
[1:25:06] same parents two boys came forth as
[1:25:08] twins one knowing and loving the things
[1:25:11] of God and the other knowing much of the
[1:25:15] same truth but not of the same spirit
[1:25:19] and hence persecuted the child that was
[1:25:21] elect
[1:25:25] God did not reprobate for the sake of
[1:25:31] reprobation he reprobated for the sake
[1:25:34] of the
[1:25:36] elect
[1:25:38] elect cannot persecute
[1:25:43] elect elect cannot harm
[1:25:51] elect
[1:25:53] just I mean I'm just going to pause
[1:25:56] there you know where this is going you
[1:25:58] know what I'm thinking you it's what we
[1:26:02] he sent it to us for a purpose brothers
[1:26:04] and sisters when we see
[1:26:07] persecution
[1:26:09] deliberate character assassination going
[1:26:12] on you've got to
[1:26:15] wonder it is the reprobates that
[1:26:17] persecute and destroy the
[1:26:20] elect oh those reprobates are relig
[1:26:25] they are
[1:26:27] smart they are of the cane line the
[1:26:31] serpent
[1:26:34] seed and we would never want to put that
[1:26:36] label on
[1:26:38] anyone I don't believe the elect would
[1:26:40] ever want to put that label on
[1:26:43] anyone
[1:26:44] personally just my thoughts just my
[1:26:47] heart I believe the reprobates would be
[1:26:50] the ones putting that label on people
[1:26:52] yes sir because I believe the elect
[1:26:54] would that everyone would be
[1:26:57] saved that everyone would have the
[1:26:59] desire to come to the knowledge of the
[1:27:01] truth just like the spirit of
[1:27:04] Christ the elect cannot persecute elect
[1:27:07] elect cannot harm elect it is the
[1:27:09] reprobates that persecute and destroy
[1:27:12] the elect oh those reprobates are
[1:27:15] religious they are
[1:27:17] smart they are of the can line the
[1:27:20] serpent seed they build their bables
[1:27:24] they build their cities they build their
[1:27:26] Empires and all the while calling on God
[1:27:32] they hate the true seed and they will do
[1:27:34] all they can even in the name of the
[1:27:37] Lord to destroy God's elect
[1:27:41] ones but they're
[1:27:45] needed they're needed why are they
[1:27:48] needed what is the chaff to the
[1:27:51] wheat no chaff no wheat
[1:27:55] right
[1:27:57] right so brothers and sisters I'm just
[1:28:00] the way the prophet has put this
[1:28:01] together the way the Holy Ghost did
[1:28:02] through the prophet what he's talking
[1:28:04] about is those reprobates are not out
[1:28:07] there in the
[1:28:11] denominations he immediately draws a
[1:28:13] parallel with
[1:28:15] chaff with the wheat so where's that
[1:28:19] chaff but at the end what happens to the
[1:28:22] chaff it is burned with fire on
[1:28:24] quenchable and the wheat where is it it
[1:28:27] is gathered into the Garner it is where
[1:28:30] he is just like the story of Joseph
[1:28:34] where were his
[1:28:35] Brethren his Brethren came to the Palace
[1:28:38] but he said hey wait a second I need a
[1:28:41] moment and he sent his wife away she was
[1:28:44] actually not even where there when he
[1:28:46] revealed himself to his Brethren it's
[1:28:49] the same thing today it' be the same
[1:28:51] thing in Israel when he reveals himself
[1:28:53] to them he goes on to say oh elect of
[1:28:56] God beware study closely be
[1:29:01] careful work out your salvation with
[1:29:04] fear and trembling amen rely upon God
[1:29:09] and be strong in his
[1:29:12] might your adversary the devil is even
[1:29:15] now going about like a roaring lion
[1:29:19] seeking whom he may
[1:29:21] devour I just think it's so beautiful to
[1:29:24] have that kind of a warning to have that
[1:29:26] kind of a an encouragement oh elect of
[1:29:29] God beware study closely be
[1:29:33] careful work out your own salvation with
[1:29:36] fear and
[1:29:37] trembling don't want to just say hey I
[1:29:39] got it I'm good I come to church just to
[1:29:43] put my shoulder to the wheel and say
[1:29:44] amen and then I go home we're ever
[1:29:47] learning but we are coming to the
[1:29:49] knowledge of the
[1:29:52] truth it's such a beautiful thing
[1:29:54] thing brother Bram he says watch unto
[1:29:57] prayer and be steadfast This is the End
[1:29:59] Time both the true and the false Vine
[1:30:02] are coming into
[1:30:04] maturity but before the wheat matures
[1:30:07] those ripened tears must be bound for
[1:30:09] the burning see they are all joining the
[1:30:12] World Council of churches that is The
[1:30:15] Binding soon the garnering of the wheat
[1:30:18] will come but right now the two Spirits
[1:30:22] are at work in two
[1:30:24] Vines come out from among the tears
[1:30:27] start to overcome that you may be
[1:30:30] considered praiseworthy for your lord to
[1:30:35] and fit to Reign and Rule with
[1:30:38] him I think it's beautiful as I was
[1:30:40] studying this you know I uh I just got
[1:30:44] into the thought he says here that
[1:30:49] uh
[1:30:51] my soon the garnering of the wheat will
[1:30:54] will come this is in 1965 he was saying
[1:30:57] this I can't help but think the
[1:30:59] garnering of the wheat is already
[1:31:02] happening he said that he would send his
[1:31:04] angels we're going to get into it a
[1:31:05] little bit here he would send his angels
[1:31:07] to actually do the separating should
[1:31:09] should the should the people when they
[1:31:12] see things going on should they go and
[1:31:14] tear up tear up the tears but we know
[1:31:16] Jesus said if you do that then you'll
[1:31:18] root up the wheed as well just let them
[1:31:20] all grow and the angels will come and do
[1:31:23] the separ operating and you know
[1:31:24] brothers and sisters the angels are not
[1:31:26] just angels with wings that are going to
[1:31:28] fly down from heaven and and do the
[1:31:30] reaping they're actual messenger angels
[1:31:33] that bring the word of God through seven
[1:31:36] ages and they're the ones that gather
[1:31:39] the wheat into the Garner the ones who
[1:31:41] can receive the word because we're
[1:31:42] talking about spiritual matters here
[1:31:44] we're not talking about filling a Garner
[1:31:45] full of
[1:31:47] people we're talking about people being
[1:31:49] able to have an ear to hear what the
[1:31:51] messenger what the angel what the Reaper
[1:31:54] has to say to that age Revelations 3:21
[1:31:58] the Overcomer Throne to him that
[1:32:00] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:32:02] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:32:05] am set down with my father in his throne
[1:32:08] now what are we to
[1:32:10] overcome it's a great
[1:32:12] question that is a a norm that is the
[1:32:15] normal question to ask here but that is
[1:32:19] not the actual thought of this verse for
[1:32:22] it's not so much
[1:32:24] what we are to
[1:32:26] overcome but how we are to
[1:32:28] overcome and I just remember so vividly
[1:32:31] brother Ken boy are preaching services
[1:32:33] on this it is not what we are to
[1:32:35] overcome because we have all manner of
[1:32:38] things to overcome but it's how we
[1:32:40] overcome it and I think it's so
[1:32:42] beautiful because we don't have to be
[1:32:43] left hanging I'm not going to say it I'm
[1:32:45] going to let the prophet say it but I
[1:32:46] just can't help get excited about it cuz
[1:32:48] it's so true it's not what we are to
[1:32:49] overcome but how we do it now this is
[1:32:52] logical for for it does matter much what
[1:32:56] we are to overcome
[1:32:58] as for does it matter how how much what
[1:33:02] we are to overcome as long as we know
[1:33:04] how we can overcome a quick look at
[1:33:08] those scriptures which in involve the
[1:33:11] Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the
[1:33:13] truth of this proposition in Matthew 4
[1:33:16] where in Jesus is tempted of the devil
[1:33:19] he overcame the personal Temptations of
[1:33:22] Satan by the word and by the word
[1:33:28] only in each of the three major trials
[1:33:30] that corresponded exactly to the
[1:33:32] Temptation Of The Garden of
[1:33:35] Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:33:39] the eye and the pride of life Jesus
[1:33:42] overcame by the
[1:33:45] word eve fell to the personal Temptation
[1:33:49] Of
[1:33:50] Satan by failing to use the word
[1:33:55] Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the
[1:34:00] word but Jesus overcame by the word amen
[1:34:04] and right now let me say that this is
[1:34:07] the only way to be an overcomer
[1:34:11] amen it is the only way that you can
[1:34:16] know if you are overcoming
[1:34:20] amen because that word Can't Fail amen
[1:34:25] amen I have this highlighted here this
[1:34:28] sentence here and right now let me say
[1:34:30] that this is the only way to be an
[1:34:31] overcomer it also is the only way that
[1:34:34] you can know if you are overcoming
[1:34:37] because that word Can't Fail now notice
[1:34:40] again how Jesus overcame the World
[1:34:42] Systems of religion my how time flies
[1:34:47] when he was repeatedly badgered by the
[1:34:50] theologians of his day he constantly
[1:34:53] applied the
[1:34:54] word he spake only what the father gave
[1:34:57] him to
[1:34:58] speak there was not a time when the
[1:35:01] world was not utterly confused by his
[1:35:03] wisdom for it was the wisdom of
[1:35:07] God in his own personal life contending
[1:35:10] with himself he overcame by obedience to
[1:35:13] the word of God in Hebrews 5:
[1:35:17] 7-9 now notice again how Jesus overcame
[1:35:21] the world's systems of religion
[1:35:25] sorry
[1:35:26] sorry who in the days of his flesh when
[1:35:29] he had offered up prayers and
[1:35:30] supplication with strong crying and
[1:35:32] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:35:35] from death and was heard in that he
[1:35:39] feared though he were a son yet learned
[1:35:43] he obedience by the things which he
[1:35:46] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:35:50] became the author of Eternal
[1:35:52] salvation unto all them that obeyed him
[1:35:56] what was he obedient to the word of God
[1:35:59] I think this is beautiful here I'm
[1:36:01] probably going to preach on this one day
[1:36:02] here don't be surprised when you see me
[1:36:05] do that I'm going to put a nice good
[1:36:07] star right there and maybe right
[1:36:11] there what is perfect brothers and
[1:36:14] sisters it's not being perfect in my
[1:36:17] hair it's not being perfect in my looks
[1:36:20] it's not being perfect in my finances
[1:36:22] it's not being perfect in my church
[1:36:24] attendance it's not being perfect in My
[1:36:26] Worship it's not being perfect in
[1:36:29] Pitch it's not being perfect in how we
[1:36:33] play the word of God says to make a
[1:36:35] Joyful
[1:36:36] Noise and it's certainly not perfect is
[1:36:39] not in our image of
[1:36:42] ourselves if that's what we've got then
[1:36:44] we've got this completely wrong the
[1:36:46] Perfection is the word of God in our
[1:36:49] lives when we're willing to allow
[1:36:51] ourselves to fully humble ourselves to
[1:36:53] the word of God there we're talking
[1:36:55] about perfection that's the only
[1:36:57] Perfection that we can do we have no
[1:37:00] Perfection on our own aside from
[1:37:02] humbling ourselves to his Perfection one
[1:37:06] day we'll get into that what was he
[1:37:08] obedient to the word of God now then
[1:37:11] there will not be one person who will
[1:37:13] sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:16] Christ unless he has been speaking that
[1:37:21] word
[1:37:25] no living that
[1:37:31] word it's all about living the word
[1:37:33] brothers and sisters and and I would say
[1:37:35] yay not us living but him Living Through
[1:37:37] Me amen the Lord Jesus Christ Living
[1:37:41] that word when that happens when we rise
[1:37:43] up and we actually come against that
[1:37:44] word uhoh he tells us and what do we do
[1:37:47] humble ourselves in the sight of the
[1:37:49] Lord
[1:37:50] amen it's got to be him that's what he
[1:37:53] is obedient to the word of God now then
[1:37:56] there will not be one person who will
[1:37:57] sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:59] Christ unless he has been living that
[1:38:01] word your prayers your fastings your
[1:38:06] repentances and I'm going to say visions
[1:38:08] and
[1:38:09] dreams no matter what you present to God
[1:38:13] none of that will gain you privilege of
[1:38:16] sitting in that Throne amen it will be
[1:38:20] granted only to the word
[1:38:24] bride and what's the word bride the one
[1:38:27] that's willing to Humble herself in the
[1:38:29] sight of the Lord how do you humble
[1:38:30] yourself in the sight of the Lord you
[1:38:31] say Lord I take your word even if it
[1:38:34] takes my hide off take it off I don't
[1:38:36] want it it's got to be your word yes sir
[1:38:40] so beautiful it will only be granted to
[1:38:42] the word bride oh my brother bradam says
[1:38:44] it in uh in uh is it the rising of the
[1:38:47] sun there's been many churches churches
[1:38:49] and Brides brides but there's got to be
[1:38:51] one there's got to to be one and that's
[1:38:54] going to be a word Bride As The Throne
[1:38:57] of the king is shared with the queen
[1:38:59] because she is United to him so only
[1:39:04] they who are of that word even as he is
[1:39:08] of that word will share that
[1:39:12] Throne remember we have shown clearly
[1:39:15] All Through the Ages that even as Adam
[1:39:18] and Eve fell because they left the word
[1:39:21] so the Ephesian age fell by turning
[1:39:24] slightly from the word until with every
[1:39:28] age continuing to turn away we have a
[1:39:32] final repudiation of the word by the
[1:39:35] World Church
[1:39:37] system this Leo Dean age ends in a
[1:39:40] blackout of the
[1:39:43] word and I mean how much further does it
[1:39:46] have to
[1:39:48] go how much farther does it have to go
[1:39:50] brothers and
[1:39:51] sisters I'm going to say it and maybe
[1:39:54] get myself in trouble for it but I'm
[1:39:55] going to say it because it's true and
[1:39:57] it's against the word of God there are
[1:40:00] lesbian ministers lesbian
[1:40:03] pastors how much farther does it need to
[1:40:07] go my and because everyone's doing it
[1:40:11] it's okay it's against the
[1:40:16] word this leoan age ends in a blackout
[1:40:20] of the word thereby causing a departure
[1:40:23] from the Lord from the
[1:40:26] midst and you know brothers and sisters
[1:40:28] maybe I just used to call it a
[1:40:31] gross maybe depiction of it the epitome
[1:40:36] of it but one word off is just as
[1:40:39] bad to be clear we can have all the
[1:40:43] perversion in the world but one word off
[1:40:46] guilty of the least is guilty of the
[1:40:47] whole I say Lord don't let me be
[1:40:52] guilty he stands outside calling to his
[1:40:55] own who follow him by obedience to the
[1:40:59] word that's how we follow him I have
[1:41:02] that part highlighted too by obedience
[1:41:04] to the word that's how we follow him
[1:41:08] after a short and Powerful demonstration
[1:41:11] of the spirit this little haunted and
[1:41:13] persecuted group will go to be with
[1:41:15] Jesus you know many times I thought
[1:41:17] about this and how we could look back
[1:41:19] and see in history how there was the
[1:41:21] maybe the SS groups and how they
[1:41:23] persecuted the Jews and they really did
[1:41:25] persecute the Jews I am not disputing
[1:41:26] that for a second but what I am getting
[1:41:28] at what what I think the Lord was
[1:41:30] showing me as I was studying this here
[1:41:31] is maybe this persecution isn't
[1:41:33] necessarily going to be to the slaughter
[1:41:35] of the Bride of Jesus Christ because the
[1:41:38] prophet said very clearly that he does
[1:41:40] not have to let her go through the
[1:41:42] tribulation to be judged to be righteous
[1:41:45] enough to be his bride if she is his
[1:41:47] bride he has already seen her wash
[1:41:50] herself and she's already judged herself
[1:41:52] so that she doesn't need to be judged
[1:41:55] again so what I'm getting at is perhaps
[1:41:58] this persecution I'm just saying this
[1:42:00] perhaps this persecution is simply a
[1:42:02] word persecution against the Bride of
[1:42:05] Jesus Christ but what is going to be a
[1:42:07] powerful demonstration by the spirit
[1:42:09] brothers and sisters what can be more
[1:42:11] powerful than being able to stand upon
[1:42:13] this word in the midst of a perverse
[1:42:15] generation like we live in
[1:42:19] yes don't look for signs and wonders
[1:42:22] look for the ability to stick with this
[1:42:24] word that's my point with this this
[1:42:27] little hunted and persecuted
[1:42:29] group will go to be with Jesus
[1:42:32] my consummation of the Gentile ages this
[1:42:36] age is the last of the seven Church ages
[1:42:40] what began in the first or Ephesian age
[1:42:43] must and will come to full fruition and
[1:42:46] harvest in the last or leodan age the
[1:42:51] two fines the two Vines
[1:42:53] will yield their
[1:42:55] fruit the two spirits will terminate
[1:42:58] their
[1:42:59] manifestation in each of their final
[1:43:03] destinations the sewing the watering the
[1:43:06] growing is all over summer is ended the
[1:43:09] sickle is now thrust in to the
[1:43:13] Harvest in verses 15 to 18 this is
[1:43:16] revelations
[1:43:18] 35-18 in Revelation uh yeah 3 15 to
[1:43:24] 18 uh in which we have just studied lies
[1:43:27] the true picture of the ripened false
[1:43:29] fine false Spirit false church
[1:43:33] people I Know Thy works that thou art
[1:43:37] neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold
[1:43:41] or hot yes right so then because Thou
[1:43:44] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[1:43:46] will spew thee out of my
[1:43:49] mouth because thou sayest I am rich
[1:43:53] and increased with goods and have need
[1:43:55] of nothing and knowest not that thou art
[1:43:59] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:44:01] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[1:44:04] me character tried in the fiery furnace
[1:44:08] of Affliction is what we read earlier I
[1:44:11] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:44:13] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:44:15] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:44:19] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:44:21] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:44:25] isav that thou mayest see I'll call the
[1:44:27] musicians so I don't keep us here
[1:44:30] because boy I've got some highlighting
[1:44:33] coming up some good stuff in here
[1:44:36] hallelujah brother bramy says here no
[1:44:38] words ever spelled out a more bitter
[1:44:42] denunciation and no proud and arrogant
[1:44:45] religious people ever deserved it
[1:44:48] more yet in verse
[1:44:50] 21 to him that overcometh
[1:44:53] will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:44:56] throne even as I also overcame and am
[1:45:01] set down with my father in his throne we
[1:45:03] find the True Vine true Spirit true
[1:45:07] church people exalted to the very Throne
[1:45:11] of God with the highest compliment ever
[1:45:15] paid to a humble steadfast steadfast
[1:45:19] spiritual group in the words of John the
[1:45:22] Baptist
[1:45:23] who so accurately set forth the church
[1:45:26] in relationship to the true and false
[1:45:29] church now comes to pass in Matthew
[1:45:32] 3:11-12 I indeed baptize you with water
[1:45:37] unto repentance maybe stand with me as
[1:45:39] we read this but he that cometh after me
[1:45:43] is mightier than I who shoes I am not
[1:45:48] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[1:45:50] the Holy Ghost and with fire
[1:45:54] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[1:45:56] thoroughly Purge his floor and gather
[1:45:59] his wheat into the Garner but he will
[1:46:01] burn up the chaff with unquenchable
[1:46:05] fire you know brother Bram in his
[1:46:07] ministry he came and he was told as John
[1:46:11] the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:46:13] first
[1:46:14] coming your ministry will forerun the
[1:46:17] second coming I believe it's no accident
[1:46:20] that we would read a scripture like this
[1:46:21] in here I I indeed baptize you with
[1:46:24] water and repentance unto repentance and
[1:46:27] isn't that what brother bradam did
[1:46:29] brought back true water baptism into the
[1:46:32] church in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:46:35] Christ for the remittance of
[1:46:38] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:46:41] the Holy
[1:46:42] ghosten I think it's just
