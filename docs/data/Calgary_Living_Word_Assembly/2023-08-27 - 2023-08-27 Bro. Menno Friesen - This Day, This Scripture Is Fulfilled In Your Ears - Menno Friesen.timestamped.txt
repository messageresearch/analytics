[54:45] from death into life
[54:47] art is written he that heareth my word
[54:50] and believeth on him that sent me
[54:52] has already passed from death into life
[54:55] and shall not even come unto the
[54:57] condemnation
[54:58] our blessed we are this morning Lord and
[55:01] we're grateful to be in this presence in
[55:04] your presence
[55:05] make us mindful of the hour that we're
[55:07] in the time the season
[55:10] and that we would understand clearly by
[55:13] revelation
[55:14] the hour that we're now facing and
[55:16] living in
[55:18] for the greatest joy of all immortality
[55:22] we thank you for the years and the
[55:24] thinking now as we look down through the
[55:26] history and here we are at the
[55:29] consummation of time itself
[55:32] just at the brink now before the
[55:35] Millennium to setium
[55:37] oh how Hearts trembled with joy to think
[55:39] that you've been mindful of us and
[55:42] called us out of sin to walk with you
[55:45] take these songs that were sung this
[55:47] morning into worship the song leader and
[55:49] the musicians and all the the saints
[55:52] that have worshiped you this way father
[55:55] blessed brother Barry this morning where
[55:57] you sat Lord
[55:59] I'm grateful Lord is standing here in
[56:02] his place I pray that you would guide my
[56:05] mouth and my lips that I might say those
[56:07] things that are pleasing to you father
[56:09] thank you now for your grace would you
[56:11] bless us around your word we ask it in
[56:13] Jesus Christ's name amen amen thank you
[56:17] God bless you you can be seated
[56:19] thank you to the music
[56:22] and uh I'm glad to be in this house this
[56:25] morning
[56:26] I kind of uh
[56:28] not do this too much anymore I'm kind of
[56:30] slowing down a little bit and and maybe
[56:33] quite a bit but brother uh
[56:36] uh Barry sent his greetings
[56:39] he preached Wednesday night in the
[56:41] Tabernacle in Saskatoon and and went out
[56:44] uh fishing of course and I certainly
[56:48] I was kind of planning to go with him
[56:50] but uh but we kind of had a special time
[56:54] so
[56:56] but he did send his greeting he says say
[56:58] hello to the church Sunday morning
[57:00] oh I say hello to you and God bless you
[57:02] and of course the reason we're we're
[57:04] really you know not just for here but uh
[57:06] you know with Shelley's kind of a
[57:09] special birthday I don't know if
[57:10] anyone's special but uh you know it kind
[57:13] of has taken us down a memory lane and
[57:15] you know how this family every once in a
[57:17] while we get to places where we we kind
[57:19] of uh walk back and say you know how far
[57:22] we've come and and every once in a while
[57:25] it's kind of like to not that we measure
[57:27] or compare but I I do believe hindsight
[57:31] is only to see how far we've come and uh
[57:34] it makes us hard makes our makes us glad
[57:37] yet sad but what would we be Joy of if
[57:40] there'd be no uh you know the negative
[57:43] it takes the two together I've uh in all
[57:46] of life if you ever noticed there's no
[57:47] such of things just all joy just all
[57:49] Victory just thought for our victories
[57:52] born out of a great trial and uh
[57:55] to be an overcomer you've got a whole
[57:57] lot to overcome
[57:59] and to be a special Overcomer of course
[58:02] the man won that that overcomes all
[58:04] things for Christ it takes much much
[58:06] anti-force and we know that the whole
[58:08] world is kind of like sometimes we feel
[58:10] like the whole world is against us
[58:12] and it isn't rightfully saying because
[58:15] this is something that's happened in us
[58:17] the love of the world has left us we're
[58:19] in a world we just don't feel at home
[58:23] I don't mean that we that that I'm
[58:25] complaining I thank the Lord for the the
[58:28] good years and the grace but uh this
[58:30] world is not a home we're just passing
[58:32] through
[58:33] our Treasures are laid up and just think
[58:36] no matter what you what treasure you
[58:37] have today I know there's no greater
[58:40] pressure that I know of than have a home
[58:43] a wife a family where there's real
[58:46] genuine Holy Ghost love and where
[58:48] they're born again with the spirit of
[58:50] God you couldn't get it much better than
[58:51] that and uh but even that is just a
[58:54] foretaste of Glory Divine it's just the
[58:56] time where we're kind of uh working
[58:58] through and before you know it all of a
[59:01] sudden you look at your your years they
[59:02] said where did they go
[59:05] the morning before I came here I was I
[59:07] was uh we're getting ready and I was a
[59:09] little ready before Irene and I just
[59:11] took a little walk around the yard and
[59:12] walked out to the front and and the
[59:14] driving looked down the beautiful
[59:16] morning and
[59:18] and uh yes you know kind of dropped her
[59:20] and said just think minnow you're 81
[59:23] years old
[59:25] oh my goodness I always kept thinking
[59:27] well one day I'll be 50 and then I'll be
[59:29] 60 and I'll be 70. and all of a sudden
[59:31] it's stuck right up and here I'm into
[59:33] the 80s and I'm thinking Lord
[59:35] um and that is just a little down
[59:38] payment of Glory divine
[59:40] they just think of just just a little
[59:42] part some go early and uh I can't help
[59:45] but think this morning brother Kim uh
[59:48] you know I never we we try to run along
[59:50] mom and I and Irene and I would say
[59:52] wonder why God took him and uh coming
[59:55] especially since Sally was 60 years old
[59:57] down thinking what Glory that would have
[59:59] been but but who's there to question the
[1:00:02] mind of God
[1:00:04] I don't I don't question I don't
[1:00:06] understand it
[1:00:07] but then if I understood it I wouldn't
[1:00:09] need Faith but I do believe that to all
[1:00:12] things there's a purpose and a reason
[1:00:13] behind it the the steps of the righteous
[1:00:17] are ordered of the Lord
[1:00:19] I want my steps to be ordered of the
[1:00:21] Lord whether we like it or think not
[1:00:24] even the times when we think we maybe
[1:00:26] we've been out of the place and you know
[1:00:29] the old song we used to sing when one
[1:00:31] time I looked back and I saw only if one
[1:00:33] foot one set of footprints
[1:00:35] I said Lord I thought you said you'd
[1:00:38] never leave me
[1:00:39] what am I doing walking alone I said
[1:00:41] that's not you walking he said that's me
[1:00:42] carrying you during that time there's a
[1:00:45] many Good Times there's been single
[1:00:46] Prince behind me
[1:00:48] a great many times in fact this morning
[1:00:50] is one of them
[1:00:51] it always is that way and I want to
[1:00:54] thank uh you know the the folks
[1:00:56] especially for giving Shelly such a
[1:00:59] great time and and just the boys are all
[1:01:02] here this morning the family's all here
[1:01:03] good to see you and we we love the
[1:01:07] family
[1:01:08] but of all the things
[1:01:10] this is an international family when I
[1:01:13] look at here you're from every race
[1:01:14] Kindred people in tongue kind of a good
[1:01:17] representation of the elect lady around
[1:01:19] the world
[1:01:21] they come from the east and west
[1:01:24] they come from the land so far
[1:01:27] to Feast with our King
[1:01:30] to dine as his guest how blessed these
[1:01:32] pilgrims are
[1:01:35] and just by way of just I'm not sure I'm
[1:01:39] going to read a scripture and try to
[1:01:41] take a few thoughts from the scripture
[1:01:42] but I'd just like to talk to you a
[1:01:45] little bit this morning concerning these
[1:01:47] this glorious age what I do believe
[1:01:49] we're in I am not I'm not a master and
[1:01:52] teachers of these things but some of the
[1:01:54] things that that has unfolded in this
[1:01:57] age where we can sincerely say
[1:02:00] from the bottom of our heart that this
[1:02:02] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[1:02:06] ears
[1:02:08] there are so many of the scriptures that
[1:02:10] have all folded together here at the end
[1:02:13] and you know how when the prophet was
[1:02:15] here he talked concerning the the
[1:02:17] history and the six thousand years but
[1:02:19] when he got to the last he said you know
[1:02:21] how Jesus's Life Ministry for 30 years
[1:02:24] he was just there and he was he was
[1:02:28] Christ the same one but he's a carpenter
[1:02:30] he worked a normal job he just went
[1:02:32] through not much different now but for
[1:02:34] about three and a half years and
[1:02:35] suddenly said scriptures just begin to
[1:02:37] fulfill just begin to fulfill
[1:02:40] our short three and a half year Ministry
[1:02:42] really
[1:02:44] and he and he lived for that 33 and a
[1:02:48] half years
[1:02:49] expressing most of what the prophets had
[1:02:52] spoken concerning his first coming
[1:02:57] and they prophesied and spoke with hope
[1:02:59] and in a matter of three and a half
[1:03:01] years
[1:03:03] all of those scriptures begin to fit
[1:03:05] together quickly
[1:03:07] but it blinded the eyes of the people
[1:03:09] but opened the eyes to some there's
[1:03:12] always that way and I'm I'm looking at
[1:03:14] the scripture and the the time that
[1:03:16] we're in these things that's happened we
[1:03:18] have we have thought of course and I'm
[1:03:20] I'm confessing I'm I'm in the age
[1:03:22] bracket now where uh we had expected the
[1:03:26] Lord to come a long time ago in physical
[1:03:28] rapture
[1:03:30] uh well I I never thought I'd get to see
[1:03:33] great grandchildren
[1:03:35] my goodness I didn't even think our
[1:03:37] children would go to school be quite
[1:03:39] honest when we first when I was I was 20
[1:03:42] years older 19 years old when when uh
[1:03:45] the Lord saved me and my wife and and so
[1:03:48] I know when we heard the message first
[1:03:50] time we get to hear the prophet speak we
[1:03:52] we realized once he was who he was as a
[1:03:55] prophet we knew it would be long until
[1:03:57] we'd be gone
[1:03:58] but you know he's never in a hurry but
[1:04:01] he's never late
[1:04:03] I don't believe he's in a hurry I think
[1:04:05] of all the precious Saints on the Earth
[1:04:07] right now you know this message
[1:04:10] after the Testament died after the angel
[1:04:14] died it became more powerful than when
[1:04:17] he was living
[1:04:18] men got behind the message and printed
[1:04:21] it and sent it out to around the world
[1:04:22] into every country everywhere and it had
[1:04:24] Revival after Revival not just a natural
[1:04:27] talk about stirring up but talk about
[1:04:29] calling out an elect lady out of every
[1:04:32] tongue and Kindred people this morning
[1:04:34] we could say they're they're from
[1:04:35] everywhere now
[1:04:36] where it's closing off now you're seeing
[1:04:39] even the brothers that been on the
[1:04:41] mission field now they come back and say
[1:04:42] it's there now but now all kinds of
[1:04:44] doctrines are starting to weave in and
[1:04:45] trying to assure us all that but one of
[1:04:48] these mornings it'll be the last one
[1:04:50] they'll be sealing and there's a ceiling
[1:04:52] going on right now and I I know that we
[1:04:54] know that but we're we're waiting now
[1:04:57] with all that lays within us I believe
[1:05:00] we're waiting now not because I'm old
[1:05:02] I might still go by the way the grave
[1:05:05] I don't know that we don't know that but
[1:05:07] I've seen a lot younger people go by the
[1:05:09] way the grave and I know this if we live
[1:05:11] through this day we'll outlive a many a
[1:05:13] 15 year old child
[1:05:15] 15 year old boy or girl
[1:05:18] but there's one thing sure eventually
[1:05:20] one time one day every scripture must be
[1:05:23] fulfilled it must be fulfilled and here
[1:05:26] we are enjoying the part that we
[1:05:29] recognize that we're in now living
[1:05:31] Epistles rid of all men I'm glad to be
[1:05:34] read as being a part of the word of God
[1:05:36] I want to take in just a little time and
[1:05:39] you know every time we uh I've always
[1:05:41] believed this when we get together we
[1:05:43] love to polish the jewels and turn over
[1:05:47] the gold and and go through all the the
[1:05:50] as brother Bob said we're we're
[1:05:51] Prospectors we we go to dig in a little
[1:05:54] bit further and then we blow a little
[1:05:55] bit and then we siphon a little bit and
[1:05:58] then we blow again and and we maybe go
[1:06:01] through the waters and the trials and
[1:06:02] the test but but every time we gather we
[1:06:05] we find we're coming be purified a
[1:06:08] little more
[1:06:09] he loves to let his children go through
[1:06:11] trials and said oh lord I can't make
[1:06:13] this one he said that's all that's good
[1:06:15] that's good I'm going to take you
[1:06:16] through it
[1:06:17] I'm going to get victory in you
[1:06:20] for his whole purpose is I know there's
[1:06:23] been in many times when in your life
[1:06:24] probably where you've sat there and
[1:06:26] maybe prayed at night and and before the
[1:06:28] morning said Lord I don't know how am I
[1:06:29] going to make this one
[1:06:32] those are the times he really enjoys he
[1:06:34] said that's good then I'll do it for you
[1:06:36] then I'll do it in you
[1:06:38] born that day you'll know when I think
[1:06:40] of the prophet he said now watching this
[1:06:42] they said in that day this day
[1:06:44] and that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:06:46] father
[1:06:47] and the father is in me I and you and
[1:06:50] you and me the prophet said this is the
[1:06:53] day that it becomes the divine
[1:06:55] revelation to the elect lady that that
[1:06:58] is the truth that God had resolved all
[1:07:01] the mystery of God unfolded not two or
[1:07:04] three beings but one true Living God
[1:07:06] manifested in different manifestations
[1:07:08] so much more that you can't you can't
[1:07:10] even put them all together
[1:07:12] but he's everything but his father son
[1:07:14] Holy Ghost he's the first he's Alpha
[1:07:17] he's the Omega he's all those things but
[1:07:19] he changed his form to hide himself to
[1:07:22] some and reveal himself to others
[1:07:24] look at this day when everybody's
[1:07:26] worshiping Jesus Christ so to say
[1:07:29] he comes as Son of God
[1:07:32] he turns the turns the message around
[1:07:34] and prophesies that he'll come as son of
[1:07:35] man
[1:07:37] and while he comes the son of man
[1:07:39] Prophet they go right on saying oh we
[1:07:41] believe in Jesus we believe in Jesus
[1:07:43] Jesus is the word
[1:07:45] and when he come inside of man prophecy
[1:07:47] and begin to fulfill the scripture
[1:07:49] they said all away with him away with
[1:07:51] him we'll we'll stay with Jesus oh we
[1:07:54] love Jesus
[1:07:55] but Jesus is the word
[1:07:58] he is Son of Man Son of God Son of David
[1:08:02] but he's all the same
[1:08:03] but just a short little space of time
[1:08:07] well actually like the prophet said
[1:08:09] about three and a half years Thirty did
[1:08:10] you know said it's his Minister was 33
[1:08:12] and a half years
[1:08:14] when brother Brown from the time that he
[1:08:15] started his ministry time he finished
[1:08:17] was 33 and a half years
[1:08:19] just right about
[1:08:20] fulfilling exactly the scripture not the
[1:08:23] man and I like that about the prophet he
[1:08:25] said it's not me I'm not the one that
[1:08:27] does these things
[1:08:28] it's Christ in me the hope of glory
[1:08:31] amen I've got to little let's read a
[1:08:33] little scripture in the Book of Luke
[1:08:36] and because I've been on that uh I'm
[1:08:38] good to yeah stand with me if you would
[1:08:40] please
[1:08:41] I'm going to just be on a little part
[1:08:43] that blessed me some time ago I was
[1:08:46] reading a part of the message and I you
[1:08:48] know how you you've got most of the
[1:08:50] messages underlined so heavily but but
[1:08:52] then every once in a while a new thing
[1:08:55] you missed a little partner you
[1:08:56] underline it again say oh that sounds
[1:08:58] good and dumb I'm going to polish one of
[1:09:00] those nuggets this morning that I that I
[1:09:02] just enjoyed again when I read it and
[1:09:05] it's found here in this scripture which
[1:09:07] is very familiar I'm sure Luke the
[1:09:09] fourth chapter
[1:09:10] and let's start about the 14th verse
[1:09:14] and uh this is a familiar
[1:09:17] scripture but I think anytime you read
[1:09:20] the word of God you're in the will of
[1:09:21] God
[1:09:23] I do believe that I'm going to read the
[1:09:25] 14th verse and we'll just drop in around
[1:09:27] the 14th verse of Luke the fourth
[1:09:30] chapter
[1:09:31] and Jesus returned in the power of the
[1:09:33] spirit into Galilee
[1:09:36] and they went out of Fame of him through
[1:09:38] all the reasons round about and he
[1:09:40] taught in their synagogues being
[1:09:42] glorified of all
[1:09:44] and he came to Nazareth
[1:09:46] where he was brought up
[1:09:48] that's usually the place where you're
[1:09:50] not very popular
[1:09:52] you'll find in a little reading as we go
[1:09:54] down
[1:09:55] and as this custom was he went into the
[1:09:57] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:10:00] up to read
[1:10:02] and that was delivered unto him the book
[1:10:03] of Isaiah
[1:10:05] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:10:07] the place where it was written
[1:10:10] brother Brown says in one place said he
[1:10:12] found the place where it was written of
[1:10:14] him
[1:10:16] he was going to declare him
[1:10:18] and he opened the book and he's found
[1:10:20] the place where it was written
[1:10:23] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:10:25] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:10:28] the gospel to the poor
[1:10:30] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:10:32] to preach Deliverance
[1:10:34] to the captives
[1:10:36] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:10:39] and a set of Liberty them that are
[1:10:42] bruised
[1:10:43] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:10:45] Lord
[1:10:46] and he closed the book
[1:10:49] and we always wondered at the time of
[1:10:51] course we didn't know
[1:10:52] but how the prophet so beautifully
[1:10:54] brought it he closed the book why did he
[1:10:55] close it there
[1:10:58] that was the last part of his Earthly
[1:11:00] Ministry at that time
[1:11:02] the rest of it if we're going to read
[1:11:04] Isaiah the last part in a little bit and
[1:11:06] he closed the book and he gave it again
[1:11:08] to the minister and sat down in the eyes
[1:11:11] of all them that were in the synagogue
[1:11:13] were fastened on him
[1:11:15] and they began to say unto them this day
[1:11:18] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:11:21] and all bore him witnessed and wondered
[1:11:24] at the gracious words was proceeded out
[1:11:27] of his mouth and they said it's not this
[1:11:30] Joseph's son
[1:11:32] and he said unto them ye will well
[1:11:34] surely say
[1:11:35] unto me this proverb physician heal
[1:11:37] thyself
[1:11:39] whatsoever We Have Heard done in
[1:11:41] Capernaum do also hear in thy own
[1:11:44] country
[1:11:46] let me just hold your finger here for a
[1:11:48] minute did you know brother Branham when
[1:11:50] he came
[1:11:51] to the latter part of the third pool of
[1:11:53] his ministry
[1:11:55] he said in the Tabernacle said I'm not
[1:11:57] going to have any more discernment in my
[1:11:59] own Tabernacle
[1:12:01] he said it's the hardest place
[1:12:04] so much unbelief
[1:12:06] because they knew him personally
[1:12:10] they knew him personally
[1:12:12] how much easier it is to take take
[1:12:14] something from somebody that would be a
[1:12:16] little hearted that you don't really
[1:12:17] know
[1:12:18] but when you really know them
[1:12:20] said well I know he's just this and he's
[1:12:22] human and I know that and they were
[1:12:24] seeing the human part they already said
[1:12:27] physician heal thyself
[1:12:29] didn't know he was the Healer
[1:12:32] and he said verily I say unto you no
[1:12:34] prophet
[1:12:35] is accepted in his own country
[1:12:38] and that what brother Brown said
[1:12:40] he said just think this morning he said
[1:12:43] when I went down
[1:12:45] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:12:47] he said I come walking I came driving he
[1:12:50] didn't I drove by the church this
[1:12:51] morning
[1:12:52] and he said I saw license place from
[1:12:55] everywhere
[1:12:58] from Mexico to Canada all through the
[1:13:01] United States
[1:13:02] and he said as I drove by and saw the
[1:13:04] little church something said what is the
[1:13:06] attraction
[1:13:09] why is not all Jeffersonville out
[1:13:12] he said hardly want to cross the street
[1:13:14] would cross the streets
[1:13:17] why does he do that
[1:13:19] that's his choice
[1:13:21] he has ways because it's only known
[1:13:24] listen God is only known by revelation
[1:13:28] not by human inspiration
[1:13:30] or by Humanity
[1:13:32] he is only known by revelation
[1:13:35] Isaiah to you no Prophet is accept in
[1:13:37] his own country but I tell you of the
[1:13:38] truth many widows were in the in Israel
[1:13:41] during days of Elias
[1:13:44] when the heavens were shut up three
[1:13:46] years and six months with Great Famine
[1:13:49] was throughout all the land but unto
[1:13:51] none of them was Isaiah's sent
[1:13:54] save unto Sarepta the city of sidon unto
[1:13:58] a woman that was a widow and many lepers
[1:14:01] were in Israel in the time of Isaiah the
[1:14:04] prophet and none of them was cleansed
[1:14:07] same name the Syrian and all they in the
[1:14:11] synagogue when they heard these things
[1:14:13] were filled with Wrath
[1:14:17] and Rose up and thrust him out of the
[1:14:19] city
[1:14:20] and led him to the bow of the Hill
[1:14:22] wherein the city was built that they
[1:14:25] might cast him down headlong but he
[1:14:27] passing through the midst of them went
[1:14:30] his way
[1:14:32] I want to turn into back to Isaiah 61.
[1:14:36] which of course is what all of us I'm
[1:14:38] sure you know this so but let's read
[1:14:40] that familiar scripture as well Isaiah
[1:14:42] 61.
[1:14:44] and one and the spirit of God is upon me
[1:14:47] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[1:14:49] preach Good Tidings to the meek and he
[1:14:53] had sent me to bind up the broken heart
[1:14:55] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[1:14:57] to open the prisons of them that are
[1:14:59] bound
[1:15:00] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:15:03] Lord now that's where Jesus stopped
[1:15:04] reading and the day of Vengeance of our
[1:15:08] God and to comfort all that mourn
[1:15:11] to appoint unto them that more in Zion
[1:15:14] to give unto them Beauty for Ashes and
[1:15:17] oil of joy for mourning and garments of
[1:15:21] praise for the spirit of heaviness
[1:15:24] that they might be called Trees of
[1:15:26] Righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:15:28] that he might be glorified
[1:15:31] let's just pray one more time father we
[1:15:33] thank you for this glorious planting of
[1:15:36] the Lord
[1:15:37] the Glorious water that Reigns upon the
[1:15:39] planting of your word bringing forth
[1:15:42] Sons and Daughters of God immortality
[1:15:45] bless the word reading of your word now
[1:15:47] and the few things that we we polish
[1:15:49] from there Lord to increase our faith
[1:15:51] this morning raise us just a little
[1:15:53] higher make us love you more and see how
[1:15:56] you've you've led us by your spirit and
[1:16:00] opened our understanding that we might
[1:16:02] know the day and the time we're in thank
[1:16:04] you for your word bless it now to our
[1:16:06] hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:09] you can be seated if you would
[1:16:14] this scripture always means a little to
[1:16:17] me and I'll give you a little testimony
[1:16:18] because
[1:16:19] all of our our lives are born out of
[1:16:22] testimony things we go through in 1965
[1:16:25] when um I was a man of 23 years of age
[1:16:29] married with the two children for sure
[1:16:32] was it three Shelly was born I know that
[1:16:33] there was three or two
[1:16:38] my wife's the truth okay I believe it
[1:16:41] jelly and Connie you know I get those
[1:16:42] days dicks make up but I know when
[1:16:45] they're born if you really sit down okay
[1:16:46] I know the date not quite that bad but
[1:16:49] but I was 23 years old and we had heard
[1:16:52] that brother Brown was going to preach
[1:16:54] the message called marriage and divorce
[1:16:56] and at that time it was quite a quite an
[1:16:58] important message because you remember
[1:16:59] now folks not all of you Generations
[1:17:02] that your younger generation you were
[1:17:04] all born after all these Mysteries were
[1:17:06] revealed but where we were born we were
[1:17:09] hearing them one at a time
[1:17:10] we were growing with it every time we
[1:17:13] heard a message from 61 62 63 we grew
[1:17:16] and we grew with them so when a great
[1:17:18] message like marriage divorced at that
[1:17:19] time was a great message because the
[1:17:22] question wasn't every pastor's mind and
[1:17:24] every congregation was looking for
[1:17:26] answers and I myself I remember so
[1:17:29] clearly not having understood the deeper
[1:17:31] things because I was just a young
[1:17:33] Christian at the time and we were
[1:17:35] sitting there with five of us Brothers
[1:17:36] we we jumped in our car we we put a
[1:17:39] pulled our money together you know we
[1:17:40] didn't have money to stay in a motel we
[1:17:42] were just poor folks living our Rich
[1:17:44] folks world and uh and I had a car and I
[1:17:48] bought a newer car and the uh the other
[1:17:50] brother said look you take your car and
[1:17:51] we'll pay the fuel and away we go so we
[1:17:54] jumped in the car and drove 36 hours
[1:17:56] straight through stopped for fuel and
[1:17:59] washrooms and washed claimed our face a
[1:18:01] little bit same clothes uh slept in them
[1:18:04] in the car and went all the way to
[1:18:05] Jeffersonville Indiana never been there
[1:18:07] before it's one of those Adventures
[1:18:09] never been across the border period and
[1:18:11] uh we found our way Maps were around and
[1:18:14] they were poor we got stuck in
[1:18:15] Minneapolis and middle of the night and
[1:18:18] uh 12 o'clock in the morning we're right
[1:18:20] downtown Minneapolis lost because the
[1:18:22] detour that took us there and uh and
[1:18:25] we're sitting there now what to do and
[1:18:26] we pulled over it and a policeman pulled
[1:18:28] over
[1:18:29] and come to our concert uh you fellas
[1:18:33] lost
[1:18:34] you've seen our Saskatchewan plate he
[1:18:36] said yes I was driving I said yes I said
[1:18:40] I think we must have taken the wrong
[1:18:41] road he said follow me
[1:18:43] so I said uh I'll lead you out you
[1:18:46] wanted to go to back on 94 right yes 94.
[1:18:48] so he got back in the car and away he
[1:18:51] went led us all the way through
[1:18:52] Minneapolis down Highway 12 where
[1:18:55] detoured in the back into and finally
[1:18:57] blinked and said when I blinked my
[1:18:58] lights and said you just keep going
[1:19:00] straight so away we went
[1:19:02] we got to Jeffersonville
[1:19:04] you don't mind if I
[1:19:06] just relax myself a bit
[1:19:09] we got to Jeffersonville and we were we
[1:19:10] said now the first thing all we know
[1:19:12] that there's a place called New Albany
[1:19:13] there's a place called Jeffersonville
[1:19:15] because we heard brother Adam on the
[1:19:16] tapes so we said let's find the place in
[1:19:18] New Albany New Albany and sounded
[1:19:20] familiar so we found the place of New
[1:19:22] Albany and and we went in there and got
[1:19:25] a room and is uh in the middle of the
[1:19:27] afternoon and uh
[1:19:29] and we had we'd had a little bite to eat
[1:19:32] and said uh well before we uh you know
[1:19:35] uh close for the night uh let's go find
[1:19:38] the the place on 8th and Penn uh the
[1:19:40] brown Tabernacle so uh we got the map
[1:19:44] and one was navigating I was driving and
[1:19:46] we found the place also here this Eighth
[1:19:48] Street and then Penn we got down there
[1:19:50] and there's cars everywhere
[1:19:52] uh you couldn't even get close to the
[1:19:54] building
[1:19:56] and we thought the service doesn't start
[1:19:57] till tomorrow and that wasn't even at
[1:19:59] the church it was at a high school and
[1:20:01] uh so we went in and uh well we went to
[1:20:05] find out and uh one of the brothers went
[1:20:07] in and said the place was full it said
[1:20:09] the Deacon said there's no room there's
[1:20:10] no room there's not even standing room
[1:20:13] and all we felt so bad so here brother
[1:20:14] Branham had come the Wednesday night and
[1:20:16] was speaking to the congregation and uh
[1:20:19] so finally the deacons had just a minute
[1:20:21] said I'll go in so he went in and has
[1:20:24] anybody ever been in the Brahm
[1:20:25] Tabernacle all right for quite a few
[1:20:27] well they got the two doors you know how
[1:20:29] it is the two doors there the two side
[1:20:31] doors and uh they had little like this
[1:20:34] and have a look always going that that
[1:20:36] way and uh they're about about a five or
[1:20:38] six seated Highway like that and uh so
[1:20:42] the Deacon said I'll tell you what
[1:20:44] uh I'll set five chairs in the in the
[1:20:47] aisle way and you come on in and sit
[1:20:50] down and then when the service uh
[1:20:53] closing time comes
[1:20:54] that you have to get up and leave first
[1:20:57] because we can't block the action
[1:20:59] they said oh that's good that's good
[1:21:01] we'll go in and you know what you know
[1:21:04] we were we had the same clothes and
[1:21:06] there was wrinkled as can be
[1:21:08] and uh I don't know four Trail wasn't in
[1:21:10] those days I don't think it was before I
[1:21:12] I don't know but they were wrinkled
[1:21:13] we've been sleeping and we'd been
[1:21:15] driving never changed shirts or nothing
[1:21:16] like that
[1:21:17] but frankly we didn't care uh we we were
[1:21:20] we weren't going to leave
[1:21:22] were those meetings there and uh we we
[1:21:26] went in we just sat down and brother
[1:21:28] Brown was standing already behind the
[1:21:29] pulpit the song service was over and uh
[1:21:32] he took a text
[1:21:33] and his text was running from the
[1:21:36] presence of the Lord how many heard the
[1:21:39] message I don't know you've heard it
[1:21:41] um I my My Confession publicly is that's
[1:21:44] the end of my running I didn't run after
[1:21:47] that message but I had already quit
[1:21:48] running before that but it was a
[1:21:49] confirmation
[1:21:51] and uh I think I I sat there and I cried
[1:21:53] right through the message just the
[1:21:54] anointing that was on his servant and
[1:21:58] the respect that we had for this servant
[1:22:01] of God
[1:22:02] but during these meetings he preached
[1:22:04] marriage and divorces but he preached
[1:22:06] one night this day is this scripture
[1:22:09] fulfilling the Earth and he took this
[1:22:11] scripture
[1:22:12] and it began to declare
[1:22:15] what was happening in this age
[1:22:18] and begin to unfold the scripture you
[1:22:21] know Jesus here when uh when he was
[1:22:24] preaching he started he opened the Bible
[1:22:26] says he opened the book and he began to
[1:22:28] read the place and uh says precious
[1:22:31] words came out of his mouth let me just
[1:22:33] let me show you what what I was talking
[1:22:34] about one of the Nuggets that I turned
[1:22:35] over and the little message called why
[1:22:37] the people are so tossed about
[1:22:39] and brother Ram talks a little about the
[1:22:41] anointing and he said um you know he
[1:22:45] makes it like this now some people get
[1:22:46] the wrong impression of what the
[1:22:49] anointing is
[1:22:51] did you ever think of that
[1:22:53] when was the greatest anointing ever
[1:22:55] given to anyone
[1:22:57] and what did they do when they had that
[1:22:59] anointing
[1:23:02] and here's the here's the Nugget the
[1:23:04] greatest anointing that was ever given
[1:23:07] to anyone was Jesus Christ
[1:23:09] we have the measure we have the spirit
[1:23:12] by measure
[1:23:13] but he has it without measure
[1:23:16] and one day when he entered into the
[1:23:18] temple he picked up the scroll and read
[1:23:19] the spirit of God is upon me
[1:23:23] for he hath anointed me now he's
[1:23:25] preaching that personal now Jesus is
[1:23:27] standing there before these great
[1:23:30] teachers of the law and of the word
[1:23:32] the spirit of God is upon me
[1:23:36] for he hath anointed me to preach the
[1:23:38] acceptable year and bind up the
[1:23:40] Brokenhearted heal the sick and give
[1:23:42] sight to the poor and now you would
[1:23:44] think if such an anointing was in him
[1:23:47] he had prophesied 800 years before this
[1:23:51] I just think it was this morning if you
[1:23:52] knew that a prophecy 800 years have been
[1:23:55] prophesied beforehand and this morning
[1:23:57] that scripture was going to become alive
[1:24:02] they've been laying there for all those
[1:24:04] years under the anointing of God's word
[1:24:06] God never changes his mind about his
[1:24:07] word he's never late he's right on time
[1:24:10] and Jesus opened the Bible and began to
[1:24:13] speak concerning himself and said this
[1:24:15] day is this scripture now here it is 2
[1:24:18] 000 years later here's the prophet
[1:24:19] standing and he's beginning to point and
[1:24:21] take the same scripture said and this
[1:24:23] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[1:24:26] eyes
[1:24:27] a brother I came alive we all came alive
[1:24:29] said oh what a glorious day to be living
[1:24:33] in to recognize that the word of God is
[1:24:35] being fulfilled this day
[1:24:37] what was what laid dormant for all these
[1:24:40] two thousand years in the six Church
[1:24:42] ages now in the seventh we're not only
[1:24:44] in the last of the church age but we're
[1:24:45] past the first poll the second poll and
[1:24:47] going into the third poll now this was
[1:24:49] the third poll 1965.
[1:24:52] and he said if and he continues to
[1:24:54] polish this nugget like this and he said
[1:24:56] and now we would think it's such an
[1:24:58] anointing such a prophecy of 800 years
[1:25:00] before that that it would come and here
[1:25:02] would be the type of the anointing and
[1:25:04] full blessing and anointing of the Lord
[1:25:06] upon him
[1:25:07] we would want to take and run all over
[1:25:09] the building scream and holler
[1:25:11] foreign
[1:25:13] we would probably have to confess that a
[1:25:15] little bit wouldn't we
[1:25:18] I don't think anybody's ever again
[1:25:20] screaming or hollering or not or
[1:25:22] shouting
[1:25:23] in fact it feels good when somebody
[1:25:25] shouts and says Amen to the word of God
[1:25:28] brother Brian said that's good that you
[1:25:30] know a good hearty amen
[1:25:32] is more powerful than anything you could
[1:25:34] say to the word of God because he is the
[1:25:36] god of the amen you know that
[1:25:39] So when you say Amen to the word of God
[1:25:41] you're not saying Amen to the preacher
[1:25:43] if I read the scripture here this
[1:25:44] morning as I did and you said amen
[1:25:46] you're a Manning the god of the amen
[1:25:50] now you could get excited you can run a
[1:25:52] shout and that's all good too
[1:25:55] you know sometimes we think oh we got to
[1:25:57] kick the devil we got to do that it's
[1:25:58] all good too
[1:26:00] but that's not here he is the fullness
[1:26:02] of the godhead bodily let's just see
[1:26:04] what he did
[1:26:06] now they've got a pretty good example of
[1:26:07] what he how he acted when this fullness
[1:26:10] of the scripture was upon him and he
[1:26:12] said now this morning you are seeing
[1:26:15] what Isaiah prophesied way back there
[1:26:17] 800 years ago
[1:26:19] and I am the Fulfillment and to begin to
[1:26:21] no doubt he begin to elaborate about
[1:26:23] Isaiah and the Virgin shall conceive it
[1:26:25] all and that's why they said they got
[1:26:27] angry they got angry about something as
[1:26:29] he kept speaking because he was telling
[1:26:31] them that the word is living now and I
[1:26:34] am the expression of that word
[1:26:38] foreign
[1:26:40] all over the building screaming
[1:26:42] hollering
[1:26:43] but the Bible said he laid down the
[1:26:46] scroll
[1:26:47] sat down
[1:26:48] and precious words proceeded from his
[1:26:52] mouth
[1:26:53] that's what done
[1:26:55] that's what he'd done under the
[1:26:57] anointing
[1:26:59] the anointing is not emotion
[1:27:03] said oh that was so anointed I got so
[1:27:05] emotional well that's just a follow-up
[1:27:07] of the anointing
[1:27:09] the anointing is not emotion emotion is
[1:27:12] what follows the anointing
[1:27:16] that oh we shout and we prayed that's
[1:27:18] wonderful but that's just the anointing
[1:27:20] of the emotion that's just the emotion
[1:27:22] that follows the anointing but listen to
[1:27:23] what he said over here
[1:27:25] that's not what's done under the
[1:27:26] anointing the anointing is not emotion
[1:27:30] here it is the anointing is supreme
[1:27:33] power in control
[1:27:37] let's just take a little time of that
[1:27:39] let's Digest
[1:27:40] the anointing of God is supreme power in
[1:27:45] control
[1:27:50] knowing exactly what and how
[1:27:54] to use the word
[1:27:56] the anointing is the supreme power of
[1:27:59] God that's the reason why you would hear
[1:28:01] prophets many times when they should
[1:28:02] have or felt like speaking they spake
[1:28:04] not
[1:28:06] when they did not feel like speaking
[1:28:08] they spoke
[1:28:09] when they did not know what to say they
[1:28:11] let God say it that's why Jesus was
[1:28:14] being the fullest about the godhead
[1:28:16] bodily
[1:28:17] didn't call for justice or or judgment
[1:28:21] he couldn't finish the last part and the
[1:28:24] judgments of the hand of the Lord
[1:28:25] because he was there as a supreme
[1:28:26] sacrifice
[1:28:28] his ministry
[1:28:30] that same Ministry was to resume again
[1:28:33] six or two thousand years later and come
[1:28:36] to fulfillment
[1:28:37] and to comfort them that mourn look at
[1:28:41] the age that we're in now there's only
[1:28:43] one real group of people that knows how
[1:28:45] to mourn truly over sin of this age
[1:28:48] even brother Ram said to talking about
[1:28:50] people he said what's the evidence of
[1:28:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:53] what I said them that sigh and cry
[1:28:56] for the Abominations done in the cities
[1:28:58] now that's just not crying not just
[1:29:00] weeping and emotional that's a
[1:29:02] revelation you knowing the Abomination
[1:29:04] that this world is an adulterous
[1:29:07] unclean situation is fit for judgment
[1:29:12] think of how horrible it is to think
[1:29:14] that this age
[1:29:15] even before this this service could be
[1:29:18] finished
[1:29:19] the dead in Christ could have risen this
[1:29:21] morning
[1:29:23] we are there now
[1:29:26] that made me Irene and I were talking a
[1:29:28] little bit coming in and said just think
[1:29:30] we just talked about Ken a little bit
[1:29:32] and said you know
[1:29:33] I got I never take the picture off my
[1:29:36] fridge I got his face all the time to me
[1:29:38] he's still living
[1:29:41] he's living more than we are living
[1:29:45] so are all the saints I look at my mom
[1:29:47] and dad many of the Saints you know you
[1:29:48] go we all love pictures don't we
[1:29:52] you don't usually the first one you see
[1:29:53] is yourself
[1:29:56] oh how skinny I was back there oh look
[1:29:59] at black hair
[1:30:03] then I said oh I'm so glad I'm going
[1:30:05] back to that
[1:30:06] that's the third thing we're saying
[1:30:09] I'm glad to go back the anointing is the
[1:30:12] supreme power
[1:30:14] of God in control
[1:30:16] knowing exactly what to do
[1:30:20] it is so precious
[1:30:22] I've taken you know you've had
[1:30:26] you've had many things in in life and
[1:30:28] and one of things come to my mind where
[1:30:30] brother Graham talks about
[1:30:34] the anointing and he's in the prayer
[1:30:36] line and of course always we we love
[1:30:39] those parts but let me tell you
[1:30:40] something just by way of strength and
[1:30:43] comfort
[1:30:44] do you know practically everyone that
[1:30:46] went to the prayer lines during the time
[1:30:48] when brother Brown was alive are dead by
[1:30:49] now
[1:30:52] do you see why he made said about Divine
[1:30:55] Healing as being not uh
[1:30:59] the main part
[1:31:02] is that because you're going to have to
[1:31:04] die anyhow
[1:31:07] see
[1:31:08] we we don't measure things by by signs
[1:31:12] and wonders and miracles necessarily
[1:31:13] because of all the people that were
[1:31:16] healed and delivered and miraculously
[1:31:18] Supernatural delivered raised from the
[1:31:20] dead
[1:31:21] brother Edwin way I knew him personally
[1:31:23] had much fellowship with him after he
[1:31:25] died right there in the Tabernacle later
[1:31:27] on he became his wife became a good
[1:31:29] friend of ours and we went to frequently
[1:31:31] visit her before they passed away before
[1:31:34] she passed away and Edwin Wade
[1:31:36] died just like anyone else Lazarus died
[1:31:39] like anyone else all of them are passed
[1:31:42] away we are a living generation and
[1:31:43] we're all passing away but to have
[1:31:46] eternal life
[1:31:47] you can never pass away that's why it's
[1:31:50] a primary thing you know
[1:31:53] when the disciples over there in Luke
[1:31:55] the 10th chapter they they were excited
[1:31:57] when Jesus sent them out with the power
[1:31:59] and the anointing on them now to heal
[1:32:01] the sick cast out devil and they had the
[1:32:03] anointing on them now watch the
[1:32:05] anointing it was they they when they
[1:32:07] come back oh why they Rejoice they said
[1:32:10] and they come back with shouting with
[1:32:12] emotions and they're excited he said oh
[1:32:14] the devils are subject to us
[1:32:17] and Jesus said I seem Satan like
[1:32:21] lightning fall from Heaven what
[1:32:24] he should have shouted and danced he
[1:32:26] said oh oh the devil was subject oh
[1:32:28] that's wonderful
[1:32:31] when you have eternal life all hell is
[1:32:34] subject to you
[1:32:36] there is nothing can separate you from
[1:32:38] God when you have eternal life if you're
[1:32:40] born of the spirit of God there's
[1:32:41] nothing can separate us there's no
[1:32:43] famine what if God chose you to go
[1:32:45] through that trial and even give your
[1:32:46] life
[1:32:47] it can't separate you from God
[1:32:50] but you could be healed and and
[1:32:52] delivered and go back and again be
[1:32:54] delivered again and still die
[1:32:56] so you see that's why he said I don't
[1:32:58] make it a primary it's brother Adam says
[1:33:00] it's not not the one the main thing that
[1:33:02] we preach it's just a part of the
[1:33:04] promise
[1:33:06] your healing's been around all through
[1:33:07] every Covenant first and second covening
[1:33:11] but the covenants changed in Deliverance
[1:33:14] from the blood of animals of bulls and
[1:33:15] goats but healing was even there the
[1:33:17] same way we'll look at look at the brass
[1:33:19] servant got to the place to where God
[1:33:21] said just put a uh the serpent on a on a
[1:33:24] pole and and every time you look at it
[1:33:27] look and live he said don't have to say
[1:33:28] a word
[1:33:30] sometimes I think well we got to get
[1:33:31] hands laid on that's good
[1:33:35] but you ever notice when the prophet
[1:33:36] comes toward the end he said you know
[1:33:38] I've waited for the time I might be a
[1:33:41] little bit doctored here but Barry can
[1:33:42] straighten it out if I'm out of the way
[1:33:45] but I'm pretty confident right because I
[1:33:47] heard the prophet say it and I know it's
[1:33:48] in line
[1:33:50] he said you know I have longs
[1:33:53] for the time
[1:33:56] well I would see the people just say God
[1:33:58] said it I believe it
[1:34:01] he looked at the he looked at the three
[1:34:04] class of people the Jews the Samaritans
[1:34:06] and the Gentiles
[1:34:08] and he told us
[1:34:10] how the Jews like to have hands laid on
[1:34:14] see Samaritans Jews wisdom then
[1:34:16] knowledge but the Gentiles when he come
[1:34:19] to the last part here's one Gentile that
[1:34:22] caught the true Revelation that made our
[1:34:24] lord Jesus say something that he said
[1:34:26] about no one else
[1:34:29] when the Centurion
[1:34:31] servant was sick and you know the story
[1:34:34] real well
[1:34:36] he simply asked for one thing
[1:34:38] Lord
[1:34:39] I Know I Know Who You Are
[1:34:43] I know what you are
[1:34:46] you just speak the word he probably had
[1:34:50] a message on the spoken words original
[1:34:51] seat already
[1:34:53] he said you just speak the word that's
[1:34:54] the way it's going to be
[1:34:57] and Jesus turned and said I have not
[1:35:00] found some kind of faith that kind of
[1:35:02] faith in all of Israel
[1:35:04] brother Adam said I have waited just for
[1:35:06] the for the church to see but I said we
[1:35:08] Americans I talked about his own Nation
[1:35:10] we are part of Americans he said we want
[1:35:11] hands laid on and you know what it's
[1:35:13] scriptural can't condemn it at all and
[1:35:14] we never want to start condemning
[1:35:16] anything like that
[1:35:17] but greater see that just hears the word
[1:35:20] and say God you said it I believe it
[1:35:22] that settlement
[1:35:23] well I didn't feel any different what's
[1:35:25] that got to do with it
[1:35:27] said I didn't feel it I believe it I
[1:35:30] think of the woman one time when Jesus
[1:35:32] was was uh in whose house was he in
[1:35:34] again
[1:35:35] when he was uh when he's called to the
[1:35:38] supper
[1:35:41] and the woman the adulterous woman there
[1:35:44] sat Jesus on washed
[1:35:47] unanited
[1:35:49] with dirty feet
[1:35:52] and she walked in and started washing
[1:35:54] Jesus feet
[1:35:56] dramatized a little bit said the scribes
[1:35:59] oh oh if he knew
[1:36:02] if he knew who she is
[1:36:05] and you know the truth it was she was
[1:36:07] the only one that knew who he really was
[1:36:10] they didn't know and she was the worst
[1:36:12] she was an adulterous woman
[1:36:14] we don't glorify adultery
[1:36:17] there will be no adulterers in the
[1:36:18] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:36:20] but she had more Revelation than all
[1:36:22] those put together
[1:36:24] and she was and he knew that she knew
[1:36:26] who he was
[1:36:27] in that little bit
[1:36:30] because the father no doubted showed him
[1:36:32] away who would come he said for the son
[1:36:34] can do nothing
[1:36:35] but what he sees the father do first and
[1:36:37] anything there's a real Christian that's
[1:36:39] scripture and when you look at this
[1:36:41] these these promises the the scripture
[1:36:43] when brother Bram then preached when I
[1:36:45] was sitting there that night
[1:36:48] and he preached
[1:36:49] this day
[1:36:51] is this scripture
[1:36:53] fulfilling your ears
[1:36:55] my spiritual understanding began to
[1:36:58] change so tremendously it became so real
[1:36:59] to all of us that were there
[1:37:01] we realized that for the first time
[1:37:04] we were sitting in the presence of God
[1:37:07] in the time of dispensational change
[1:37:10] they begin to take us to that place and
[1:37:12] said now remember church when this
[1:37:14] message is finished
[1:37:16] there will never be another rise up
[1:37:18] always said you'll see protractive
[1:37:20] meetings
[1:37:22] you'll hear all kinds of these all kinds
[1:37:24] of things prophesied even now that's
[1:37:25] happening but remember don't get
[1:37:27] Israel's anointing
[1:37:29] don't get that mixed up with a bride's
[1:37:31] anointing
[1:37:33] because the bride's anointing has been
[1:37:35] centered around one thing speak the word
[1:37:36] on
[1:37:38] I do believe there's people on the Earth
[1:37:39] right now that hear the word and take
[1:37:42] God in his word and that settles it
[1:37:43] there The Emotions Don't even pay any
[1:37:45] attention to emotion be whatever your RB
[1:37:47] is
[1:37:48] never feel condemned to say drive one
[1:37:50] person you know sometimes somebody feels
[1:37:52] like getting up shouting getting up and
[1:37:53] running that's fine that's just the
[1:37:55] anointing
[1:37:57] but Jesus never Jesus knew who he was he
[1:38:00] didn't have to do anything to prove
[1:38:02] anything neither do you when you're a
[1:38:04] Son of God you don't have to prove
[1:38:05] anything
[1:38:06] just speak God's word and stay right
[1:38:09] with it and you will because you're
[1:38:10] anointed to do it
[1:38:11] you're anointed to stay right with the
[1:38:13] word
[1:38:16] a little part here if I can just change
[1:38:18] this part just a little nuggets here I
[1:38:21] want to just
[1:38:22] the beautiful type of today he said
[1:38:24] unworthy
[1:38:25] worthy of death
[1:38:27] when we see him
[1:38:29] sometimes the question comes up among
[1:38:31] people and pastors we we deal with
[1:38:33] people that
[1:38:35] uh but they asked brother Brahms can a
[1:38:36] Christian sin they said oh yes
[1:38:39] he said a sinner can't sin
[1:38:42] oh I thought he committed adultery he
[1:38:45] steals he Elijah cheats that's what he
[1:38:47] is
[1:38:48] that's what she is so they don't sin
[1:38:51] they are a sinner
[1:38:52] but when you're born of the spirit of
[1:38:54] God you can sin disbelieve it's not one
[1:38:56] of the the only real Sin is the unbelief
[1:39:00] the only real thing is when you're if
[1:39:01] you're a Believer to say and you read
[1:39:02] something they shall lay hands on the
[1:39:04] sick and they shall recover oh well I
[1:39:06] wonder if that'll work
[1:39:09] what if I what if I just believe the
[1:39:10] word yeah oh but could that
[1:39:13] then when that's the real Sin
[1:39:17] the real truth of it is when you see God
[1:39:19] say something say Lord God that's
[1:39:21] nothing but the truth
[1:39:24] I'm not even without seeing me but
[1:39:25] that's one thing through it's the truth
[1:39:27] I might not have faith to make it all
[1:39:28] live
[1:39:30] I've been there many times I've not had
[1:39:31] the faith to make it all live
[1:39:33] but I sure wouldn't understand the way
[1:39:34] of someone that's got that faith if
[1:39:36] somebody's got that Faith sitting right
[1:39:37] next to me said oh amen stay right with
[1:39:40] it
[1:39:41] stay right with it
[1:39:42] but here's a little question brother
[1:39:44] Brian says you don't talk about what to
[1:39:47] do when we sin that's a good one
[1:39:51] we got to do all kinds of things but I
[1:39:53] like the way the prophet said it and
[1:39:55] I'll read it for you he said uh oh a
[1:39:58] beautiful type he's just talking about
[1:39:59] Abraham and Sarah how Sarah had just
[1:40:01] just did exactly that
[1:40:04] God told Abraham
[1:40:07] you're going to have that son
[1:40:08] and she just kind of went
[1:40:11] you know behind the curtain
[1:40:13] me an old woman
[1:40:14] you know she I don't think oh she didn't
[1:40:16] say oh he's a liar she didn't do that
[1:40:18] she just couldn't like
[1:40:21] but he knew
[1:40:22] what she had in her heart I said why did
[1:40:25] Sarah laugh
[1:40:27] is ain't your heart for God
[1:40:29] now the prophet said
[1:40:32] now let's be honest sometimes we went
[1:40:34] like
[1:40:36] no and I wouldn't say oh the prophet's
[1:40:38] wrong there oh no
[1:40:39] but is it for me I don't know
[1:40:44] it's written for the believer
[1:40:49] you know the unbeliever has no part in
[1:40:50] that it's written to a believer
[1:40:53] and when she did that the prophet said
[1:40:55] she laughed said right there God should
[1:40:57] have taken her life
[1:41:00] and friends we know that
[1:41:02] but for the grace of God which is not
[1:41:05] just a hit and miss thing
[1:41:08] Grace is our merited favor given to
[1:41:11] unmerited people
[1:41:13] without payment if we had one thing to
[1:41:16] do with being saved
[1:41:18] then we have a part in it
[1:41:20] but we don't
[1:41:22] every part that God's done in life is by
[1:41:25] the grace of God has done forth
[1:41:27] and he goes on to say and God could have
[1:41:29] taken or should have taken her life
[1:41:30] right there saying a beautiful type of
[1:41:31] us today unworthy worthy of death
[1:41:35] when we sin but God cannot kill us
[1:41:40] now now listen I'm not trying to comfort
[1:41:42] you in your sin if you do wrong
[1:41:45] don't stay wrong
[1:41:48] I think the answer is so beautiful
[1:41:50] you know uh we are not here to we are
[1:41:54] not here to condemn the people
[1:41:57] we're here to build up you in the Most
[1:41:59] Holy Faith
[1:42:01] Now call Sin what sin call black black
[1:42:03] white white
[1:42:05] but that's not to condemn it's to
[1:42:07] deliver
[1:42:08] to make free
[1:42:10] to get you out of the place
[1:42:12] so don't stay there
[1:42:16] just because your sin and backslide
[1:42:17] doesn't mean you're not a Christian
[1:42:19] July I repented on my sins I've been a
[1:42:22] Christian I was baptized anything but
[1:42:23] I've slid away
[1:42:24] you're still a Christian but you're away
[1:42:26] from the word get back to God
[1:42:29] with Factor's word quickly make it right
[1:42:32] listen how he says what a beautiful type
[1:42:33] he said we're worthy of death but God
[1:42:35] cannot kill us because he would if he
[1:42:37] would we are part of Christ
[1:42:40] it's our Grace because we are in the
[1:42:42] union with Christ isn't that wonderful
[1:42:43] tonight Union with Christ
[1:42:48] so therefore our sins when we do them we
[1:42:51] ought to quickly confess them that
[1:42:53] they're wrong because God would take our
[1:42:55] life but the blood answers in our place
[1:42:58] amen
[1:43:00] let me let me raise a little higher
[1:43:02] level and the token
[1:43:05] for it's not the chemistry of the blood
[1:43:06] or even the blood alone for you to claim
[1:43:08] the blood without the token
[1:43:11] when brother Brown preached the token
[1:43:12] message he said no longer does the old
[1:43:14] Covenant stand
[1:43:16] it's been risen higher now now to go in
[1:43:19] it takes the token life
[1:43:22] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:43:25] the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost
[1:43:26] himself is being impersonated
[1:43:29] impersonated in people in bodies that'll
[1:43:32] literally walk off the earth that God
[1:43:33] did in Jesus Christ
[1:43:36] just think of it
[1:43:38] as you're sitting here I trust every one
[1:43:40] of you but that's up to you between you
[1:43:42] and God
[1:43:44] but it's been ordained to live in this
[1:43:46] age to see the Fulfillment where this
[1:43:49] day one of these days when we lose
[1:43:51] gravitation we're going to scream said
[1:43:54] this day is this scripture fulfilling
[1:43:55] all yours
[1:43:58] I was a young lad it you know after we
[1:44:00] came back from Jeffersonville
[1:44:02] and you know how somebody said brother
[1:44:05] man what kind of Revival did you have
[1:44:06] during those times
[1:44:08] they were tremendous revivals in this
[1:44:10] the Revival is not not more of God just
[1:44:13] stirring up of God
[1:44:14] oh we had a great Revival that's good
[1:44:17] you had stirred up
[1:44:19] right and brother bam says what does the
[1:44:20] stirring up do washes the trash to shore
[1:44:24] is that when it's comets no more water
[1:44:26] in it then when it's six foot tall
[1:44:28] but it just washes the trash the
[1:44:30] unbelief the feelings oh I had this
[1:44:31] against I felt this funny about
[1:44:33] so-and-so oh the pastor he said this and
[1:44:35] and I I just I've been battling and you
[1:44:38] got to go to a little Revival for a
[1:44:40] second oh my the pastor looks different
[1:44:42] this morning
[1:44:44] everything he got on my skin but but uh
[1:44:48] oh I've been revived he looks good now
[1:44:52] and it's the same person
[1:44:55] attitude
[1:44:56] attitude
[1:44:58] brother said what kind of Revival did
[1:45:00] you had
[1:45:00] I said you know all about praying when I
[1:45:03] remember my mom and dad they were
[1:45:05] Christians in Pentecostal ranks
[1:45:07] I remember prayer meeting after prayer
[1:45:09] meeting there was nice when they would
[1:45:11] pray into the middle of the night I
[1:45:13] remember going going home already
[1:45:15] falling asleep I was eight to ten years
[1:45:17] old in that just a young lad and we were
[1:45:20] at my uncles and the ones in the village
[1:45:23] we were raised in a small village but
[1:45:25] there's a Revival moving there
[1:45:27] and they prayed they did not afford what
[1:45:30] they were praying for
[1:45:31] but they knew there was something
[1:45:33] something on its way
[1:45:35] and they prayed and they fasted
[1:45:40] they prayed and they believed and they
[1:45:42] fasted and signs and miracles wonders
[1:45:45] were in our home all the time
[1:45:48] because they didn't have anything they
[1:45:50] couldn't just go to the bank they
[1:45:51] couldn't destroy this they had they
[1:45:53] lived off of the land off what we had
[1:45:55] cows chickens pigs hogs
[1:45:59] you know almost everything made your own
[1:46:01] butter
[1:46:02] that'll do everything on our own
[1:46:05] but they they there's no hospitals or
[1:46:07] doctors to go to if you couldn't you
[1:46:09] can't get a get on a train to go there
[1:46:10] and find a way to the to the train depot
[1:46:13] and when the cars come and started
[1:46:15] coming back in the late 40s and early
[1:46:17] 50s
[1:46:18] but but they prayed
[1:46:21] and sometimes when we look back said oh
[1:46:23] the People Prayed and brother Brian said
[1:46:25] what were they praying for he said the
[1:46:26] anointing of God was beginning to press
[1:46:28] on the earth there was a move coming
[1:46:31] he started preparing the people the
[1:46:33] people started getting ready they
[1:46:34] started praying they started praying and
[1:46:36] I remember I remember my uncle one time
[1:46:38] and he'd been part of the Revival and
[1:46:40] then they they did like you know we've
[1:46:43] done some of you people here you got up
[1:46:45] to see the focuses got moved away you
[1:46:46] know that's all right that's a plug for
[1:46:49] you
[1:46:51] go wherever the Holy Spirit leads I
[1:46:54] would say that
[1:46:56] and my uncle and aunt had moved away
[1:46:58] after the Pentecostal Revival died
[1:47:00] before they heard anything about the
[1:47:01] message and they'd moved to British
[1:47:04] Columbia and the whole family moved with
[1:47:05] him
[1:47:07] got married over there married into the
[1:47:09] sinful Sinners they all went backs and
[1:47:12] went away but the mom and dad kept going
[1:47:13] to Pentecostal church but they they had
[1:47:16] not seen
[1:47:17] what they'd longed to hear
[1:47:20] and when the message came by our way in
[1:47:22] greeked all there and my dad and we had
[1:47:24] heard the first great Revelation that
[1:47:26] struck us was that this was a prophet of
[1:47:28] God and water baptism in the name
[1:47:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:32] it shall be light about the evening time
[1:47:35] in the Waterway is the light today
[1:47:37] buried in the precious name of Jesus
[1:47:39] Christ when that Revelation struck my
[1:47:42] dad's heart
[1:47:43] and struck our hearts now I'm gonna go
[1:47:45] through the details
[1:47:47] my dad after a while he said you know
[1:47:49] what I'd like to go visit my
[1:47:50] brother-in-law and my sister
[1:47:53] so Mom and Dad packed up the car and
[1:47:55] drove all the way to Vancouver uh Suri
[1:47:58] where they lived
[1:47:59] and uh first night they got together and
[1:48:01] they were all happy and talking about
[1:48:03] old times in your old village and how's
[1:48:04] the village the house of people said and
[1:48:06] then my towards it was the evening war
[1:48:09] on my dad said uh John said I I want to
[1:48:11] tell you something you remember that
[1:48:12] baptism we used to talk about
[1:48:15] they used to pray it was always
[1:48:16] independent oh there's a baptism coming
[1:48:18] there's a baptism coming oh it's going
[1:48:20] to be oh it's a great Revival some said
[1:48:22] is this spiritual is it natural
[1:48:24] oh we don't know but there's a baptism
[1:48:26] coming
[1:48:29] and my dad said you know and he took the
[1:48:31] scripture Acts
[1:48:33] and went back to Matthew 28 19 and said
[1:48:37] baptizing the name of the father son
[1:48:39] Holy Ghost and so Dad explained said you
[1:48:41] know what that what the truth of it is
[1:48:43] it's being baptized in the name not the
[1:48:46] titles but in the name
[1:48:48] of the Father Son and Holy Spirit which
[1:48:50] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:53] and by Uncle John said
[1:48:55] that's the truth
[1:48:58] he said that's what we've been waiting
[1:48:59] for all those prayers led to that well
[1:49:03] you know what it didn't take very long
[1:49:04] everyone head for the water
[1:49:06] they were so critical you're out there
[1:49:08] in the village everybody sorry choose to
[1:49:09] hear the message and the baptism said
[1:49:11] why I said those people said as soon as
[1:49:13] they see a puddle in they go
[1:49:16] it's a bit like if you open uh eunuch
[1:49:18] you know he's out there and uh traveling
[1:49:20] right along and said uh here's water
[1:49:22] Wonder me to be baptized didn't wait
[1:49:24] till they got home he's on his way home
[1:49:26] but it struck him he said oh that's what
[1:49:29] the prophet's talking about not about
[1:49:30] himself he's talking about Christ
[1:49:32] he said well here's water what hinders
[1:49:34] me to be after I said if thou believer
[1:49:35] said I believe
[1:49:36] in the water he went
[1:49:39] and it was the light today
[1:49:41] you can't start Beyond you've got to
[1:49:44] start right there at that baptism and
[1:49:46] when that strikes you the reality of
[1:49:47] that then you're gone
[1:49:50] he's not going to give you any more than
[1:49:51] what
[1:49:52] what you've already believed
[1:49:54] I got to come to a close here but let me
[1:49:56] just finish this
[1:49:59] so therefore when we sin when we want to
[1:50:02] we ought to quickly confess it that
[1:50:04] they're wrong because God will take our
[1:50:05] life but the blood answers and stands in
[1:50:07] our place and God just can't cross the
[1:50:09] blood oh I like that see he just can't
[1:50:12] do it because it's a promise that he
[1:50:14] wouldn't do it so he can't break his own
[1:50:16] promise here's what I love and I I let
[1:50:19] me leave you with this in your mouth and
[1:50:21] and you just turn this over into your
[1:50:22] heart always when you think about it he
[1:50:24] can't break his promise
[1:50:26] he promised it through the blood
[1:50:28] whatsoever whosoever believeth hath
[1:50:31] eternal life and you cannot break the
[1:50:32] promise so we find out that Abram
[1:50:37] in obedience left his home left his land
[1:50:40] and separated from everything all his
[1:50:42] Earthly possessions to travel in a
[1:50:44] strange rat surge soldierning through
[1:50:46] the land a type of the church we're
[1:50:48] asked to forsake everything
[1:50:50] that's in this world in order to follow
[1:50:53] him
[1:50:55] I live in a house and I drive a car no
[1:50:57] that's not worth talking about
[1:51:00] they said brother Ash brother Brian will
[1:51:02] Christians work he said you know because
[1:51:05] it kind of got well we're waiting for
[1:51:06] the Rapture so why work
[1:51:09] you'd be surprised how many strange
[1:51:10] doctrines has been there under the water
[1:51:13] of this message for the last 50 years
[1:51:15] people would sell all the ham and said
[1:51:17] get raised Jesus come and said no sense
[1:51:18] let's spend our money quickly I know
[1:51:20] Great Men wonderful people I've seen
[1:51:23] them take their pensions spend it all
[1:51:24] said well we won't be past 77 oh the
[1:51:27] Lord will come before 77.
[1:51:30] but he didn't say that
[1:51:32] in fact said the only way you'll know is
[1:51:34] when you see your Dead begin to appear
[1:51:36] you'll know then
[1:51:38] but he can't
[1:51:39] because it's a promise that he won't do
[1:51:41] it so he can't break his own promise
[1:51:44] so it's God himself as it were has got
[1:51:48] himself sewed up
[1:51:51] God has actually put himself at a spot
[1:51:55] that he can't cross
[1:51:57] because he said so
[1:51:59] that I cannot step over top the blood
[1:52:02] that I laid down
[1:52:03] or their sins I love this see it breaks
[1:52:07] if he did
[1:52:08] if he could if if you're born of the
[1:52:11] spirit of God said well I repented but
[1:52:12] if you're filled with the spirit of God
[1:52:14] and you're a member you're part of the
[1:52:16] body of Christ
[1:52:17] God cannot step over that blood
[1:52:21] do you realize he could even take your
[1:52:22] life out of the way
[1:52:24] so he won't lose you
[1:52:26] well sure Paul and the Ephesians of
[1:52:28] Corinthians that she even told us how to
[1:52:30] deal with it sometimes an unrepentive
[1:52:33] spirit will write get on a person
[1:52:35] so much so they're just bitter and won't
[1:52:37] repent
[1:52:38] yet they're a seed of God might lose
[1:52:40] their Joy won't listen to the correction
[1:52:42] of the of the word and the passion of
[1:52:44] the church even the way you tell the
[1:52:46] whole church the congregation that turn
[1:52:48] him loose but he said if that man's born
[1:52:50] of God
[1:52:51] it's the seed of God
[1:52:53] he'll either come back or God will take
[1:52:55] him off the Earth
[1:52:58] and if you pray and nothing happens she
[1:53:00] says there was nothing there
[1:53:04] you can't be more than what it is if the
[1:53:06] seed lays there God can't break his
[1:53:08] promise he won't do it
[1:53:10] so he can't break his own promise so
[1:53:12] God's got himself as the word showed up
[1:53:14] he can't break his promise he promised
[1:53:17] it through the blood
[1:53:19] whosoever believeth and hath eternal
[1:53:21] life he cannot break that promise
[1:53:24] oh I like that I love that when I see
[1:53:27] the blood I'll pass over you
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:31] this day
[1:53:33] is this scripture
[1:53:35] fulfilled
[1:53:37] how they got angry because he no doubt
[1:53:40] you know how it is
[1:53:42] you know how many angry people got I
[1:53:44] remember when we first heard this
[1:53:46] message people would get so angry
[1:53:48] was telling the truth on such simple
[1:53:50] things as for one not to cut her hair
[1:53:54] oh my you know why that's a law
[1:53:59] that was a simple scripture
[1:54:02] I remember my mother coming to this
[1:54:04] church wearing a hat all the ladies wore
[1:54:06] hats
[1:54:08] one day the pastor
[1:54:10] took the message from the prophet and he
[1:54:13] went to the scripture in Corinthians
[1:54:14] began to teach the truth
[1:54:16] well that was the end of the hatch
[1:54:19] they had a hat say last word
[1:54:21] sure
[1:54:23] walked in
[1:54:25] and began to let the hair grow
[1:54:27] so it's all so simple that's it
[1:54:30] it's all that simple
[1:54:36] no it's obedience to the word
[1:54:40] amen its obedience to the word
[1:54:43] I love that
[1:54:46] we're we're in our most glorious age I
[1:54:50] know that you're you're if you're in
[1:54:52] this message you're walking you
[1:54:54] understand the one little thing brother
[1:54:56] bam says and blesses me always and and
[1:54:58] all of us it's something that we keep
[1:55:00] thinking about and we are we're born
[1:55:02] into a kingdom
[1:55:04] that all of these benefits
[1:55:07] are there that we can we can hardly we
[1:55:09] could hardly attain unto them
[1:55:11] we know that so many times we live under
[1:55:13] the how we feel underprivileged we could
[1:55:16] have so much more of the joy but
[1:55:18] remember but but Mark this
[1:55:20] you are in a world
[1:55:22] that all that it sees is just this life
[1:55:26] and everything you go wherever you go
[1:55:28] every day you bump into these
[1:55:30] unbelieving Spirits wherever you go and
[1:55:32] and don't think it's strange when they
[1:55:33] try to get on you
[1:55:37] the devil you know and and we don't feel
[1:55:39] we don't think it's strange at all when
[1:55:41] you go to work and you're you may be
[1:55:42] down there welding or maybe
[1:55:44] restoring something or pulling out it
[1:55:46] might be a mechanic or get all dirty or
[1:55:48] your sister's work in the house and by
[1:55:50] the end of the day you look a mess
[1:55:54] I said oh I guess I'm a mess now
[1:55:56] what can I do
[1:55:58] you ever hear of water
[1:56:00] yeah okay
[1:56:03] one good bath one good shot oh I feel
[1:56:05] like a new person
[1:56:07] that's it that's in Christ you might get
[1:56:09] dragged down you that's the reason why
[1:56:11] when you go to work it's good to be
[1:56:13] prayed up
[1:56:14] but sometimes you're not prayed up
[1:56:17] sometimes you go go go and you're not
[1:56:19] prayed up
[1:56:20] and all how that's Satan tries to get to
[1:56:23] you but remember that's his job
[1:56:26] he's got all the time there is
[1:56:28] he's never going to leave now if you say
[1:56:32] God said I'll never leave you but that's
[1:56:34] different
[1:56:35] because I'll be in you
[1:56:37] but now Satan's not in you just because
[1:56:39] he gives your thought and runs flies
[1:56:41] over top of you and says some thought
[1:56:42] that doesn't make it you
[1:56:44] just don't speak it
[1:56:47] he comes over and some things and even
[1:56:49] sometimes it maybe should be spoken but
[1:56:52] you better speak it rightly
[1:56:54] in prayer first of all you all brother
[1:56:57] by him said if you get something against
[1:56:58] Somebody Pray up first
[1:57:00] go with the right attitude and
[1:57:02] straighten it out so we're we're
[1:57:05] we're trying to to increase and to lead
[1:57:09] them ever higher in Christ not to get
[1:57:11] away from it
[1:57:13] but brother Brian said you know
[1:57:14] sometimes we think about our life and
[1:57:16] and if you're like like I am and I know
[1:57:18] it but it's a little I closed you with
[1:57:20] this and I honestly will
[1:57:22] did you ever think I said when you leave
[1:57:23] here
[1:57:26] I'd say if you would go into the gas
[1:57:27] chamber and they or they'd throw you in
[1:57:29] the bottom of a whale or the bottom of
[1:57:30] the sea whatever it might be when your
[1:57:32] spirit leaves
[1:57:35] you water fire nothing can hold it
[1:57:40] it moves right through the building it's
[1:57:42] like a vapor
[1:57:43] I just love this part because
[1:57:46] you know brother bam says sometimes your
[1:57:48] loved ones
[1:57:50] yeah you ever notice how you talk about
[1:57:51] someone also and you feel there's a
[1:57:54] Nearness of something
[1:57:55] I've been there where we've talked about
[1:57:57] maybe got a conversation about mom and
[1:57:59] dads remember how mom used to pray and I
[1:58:02] remember you know we'd talk about her
[1:58:03] and say how we'd come in from the work
[1:58:05] and and Mama would come out of the
[1:58:07] bedroom and middle of the day all eyes
[1:58:10] were all tear stained and you could tell
[1:58:11] she'd had a real priority you know and
[1:58:13] we didn't know but she's praying for us
[1:58:16] we were just living our life but there's
[1:58:18] a prayer Warrior
[1:58:20] when we talk about it now oh it means so
[1:58:23] much more I said oh I'd love to hug you
[1:58:25] right now and say oh mama thanks for
[1:58:27] praying
[1:58:28] not that God wouldn't have done it
[1:58:31] but God uses the body
[1:58:34] that you know pray one for the other
[1:58:38] and even the spirit and but this is
[1:58:39] about the spirit world he says a little
[1:58:41] message called yeah again why do are the
[1:58:44] people so tossed about he said now when
[1:58:45] your spirit goes here when you leave
[1:58:47] here you die it becomes it hangs it it's
[1:58:49] alive it can't die it's got eternal life
[1:58:53] it can't perish then when you die and
[1:58:56] your loved ones are Weeping and then
[1:58:57] they they think you're dead you're not
[1:58:59] dead you're still
[1:59:01] up here
[1:59:03] the old body has faded away and it's put
[1:59:05] down on the ground and all the atoms
[1:59:08] that was once there it's all broken but
[1:59:10] gone back to Cosmic light and petroleum
[1:59:12] whatever it was gone back into the Earth
[1:59:14] and someday
[1:59:16] here's where we that's where we and this
[1:59:18] day let me let me not re change what the
[1:59:20] prophet said but
[1:59:22] and someday
[1:59:23] the great king of these spirits will
[1:59:25] come Jesus coming from glory in his body
[1:59:28] in his holy body and he'll turn those
[1:59:31] turn loose the power of God and every
[1:59:34] person that's in him their bodies them
[1:59:37] atoms will start going again
[1:59:41] they'll start coming together Cosmic
[1:59:43] light will start making them up in a
[1:59:45] moment's time every person that's in
[1:59:46] Christ will be changed and made young
[1:59:48] and man and a young woman again
[1:59:51] standing on the earth think of it never
[1:59:54] to get old
[1:59:56] never to get sick
[1:59:58] never to have a heartache or worry
[2:00:01] what have we got to worry about
[2:00:04] we just walk in the light
[2:00:08] or the light is gone don't don't worry
[2:00:11] isn't he wonderful
[2:00:14] I like that
[2:00:16] just even you our loved ones sometimes
[2:00:19] you you talk you know they're they're
[2:00:21] Spears here
[2:00:22] just hanging waiting to pick up one day
[2:00:25] is a given order
[2:00:27] and all those if you're if you're burned
[2:00:30] and your ashes nothing left
[2:00:32] where were you to begin with
[2:00:35] sometimes you talk about the conception
[2:00:37] of life be it animal be it human rights
[2:00:40] but how miraculous one germ and one egg
[2:00:44] and just just melt together and and
[2:00:47] something starts growing where'd it come
[2:00:50] from
[2:00:51] a spoken word
[2:00:54] is the Original Seed he said let there
[2:00:56] be light
[2:00:58] when he looked down on his Earth he saw
[2:01:00] it was it was uh void and undone but he
[2:01:04] knew that he had a seed under all that
[2:01:07] Darkness
[2:01:09] and one day he looked down and said let
[2:01:11] there be
[2:01:12] and the sun began that to be light and
[2:01:14] the sun began to shine and just as soon
[2:01:17] as the sun began to shine the seeds
[2:01:18] begin to quiver
[2:01:20] on the Earth
[2:01:22] they had to come up because there's
[2:01:23] moisture there but now took the S took
[2:01:26] the s-o-n
[2:01:28] to draw the seed back to him
[2:01:30] Come All Ye Saints of light Proclaim

[2:04:15] knowing now we've run this race
[2:04:20] the age is far spent
[2:04:23] where you see everything now humanly
[2:04:25] speaking
[2:04:26] where would we turn Lord
[2:04:28] all nations are breaking up
[2:04:31] unclean spirits everywhere
[2:04:34] it's affected every part of our life our
[2:04:37] schools where our children from the
[2:04:39] smallest School
[2:04:41] to the to the to the Capitol
[2:04:44] our churches are overridden the
[2:04:47] religious word is overridden with
[2:04:48] unbelieving spirits and unclean spirits
[2:04:52] there's just no place to turn Lord just
[2:04:54] upward
[2:04:56] oh I'm so glad Lord you give us Grace to
[2:04:59] walk in a light
[2:05:00] shines all around us but day in by night

[2:05:09] all man ever grow all these precious
[2:05:12] singers and the players and the the
[2:05:13] workers the laborers the prayer warriors
[2:05:16] Lord I pray that you'd bless them and
[2:05:18] strengthen them
[2:05:19] May the weak say I am strong
[2:05:23] the strong say I am weak
[2:05:25] where perfect strengths come in perfect
[2:05:28] weakness as your servant Paul one time
[2:05:31] cried out to you Lord
[2:05:33] heal my eyes
[2:05:35] try shall be shot thee Paul said
[2:05:38] and you told him said Paul don't ask
[2:05:41] again my grace is sufficient

[2:05:47] you know how to keep us in that place
[2:05:49] where we appreciate you
[2:05:51] you know how to give us just enough
[2:05:53] trials and tests to take out our
[2:05:56] personality or Humanity
[2:05:58] so that me Christ would be seen always
[2:06:01] in all things in our homes husbands and
[2:06:05] wives to our children
[2:06:07] our children to
[2:06:08] the their children and the and the

[2:06:13] to save the whole world no Lord
[2:06:16] just let us be a light
[2:06:19] that wherever the sea Lays
[2:06:21] when we cross in our spirit crosses it
[2:06:23] it could be quickened
[2:06:25] that our life within us would Quicken
[2:06:28] the seed as we testify to people maybe
[2:06:30] at work or play
[2:06:33] not as we go about trying to bowl over
[2:06:35] everything Lord that's not it
[2:06:37] but to lead them into the righteousness
