from Manitoba I believe that's brother Danny fair is your pastor God bless you Sister welcome brother Dave mile from St Thomas Ontario bless you brother and each and everyone on a Wednesday evening it's a struggle to get to church brother William it's good to see you brother we just have one request we wanted to bring before Before the Throne tonight sister Beth Panetta I understand that's brother mervin's sister and she's been diagnosed with cancer of the uterus and I'm sure we've all seen the request go forth on the on the chat and we just want to hold sister Beth Panetta Before the Throne tonight and uh we know as the quote was listed with the request that prayer is the most powerful weapon placed in the hands of men there's not an atomic bomb there's not a hydrogen bomb that can compare with the power that lays in the heart of a Believer with a genuine prayer so much so that prayer the prayer of a Believer can change the very Heart Of God change the the mind of God that is powerful if you have a need tonight maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness and your tender Mercy to each and every one of us thank you Lord Jesus that you gave us each one a trial father and and many times trials all along the way father we thank you that those trials don't remain trials that we don't stay down that we don't remain in the valley that as long as we're alive those trials in the hearts of your children the lives of your children they turn into testimonies and those testimonies turn turn into songs Lord Jesus thank you Father for what you've done for each and every one of us Lord father tonight we know that you are more than able and father we know the request is very specific from brother mvin tonight Lord is that this sister Beth doesn't doesn't know you in the power of your Resurrection the way that our brother knows you but father if she could just come to know you in the power of your Resurrection Lord Jesus through this trial that Lord perhaps it would turn into a testimony and that testimony would turn into her own song Father Lord whatever your desire is Lord let it be done father if it's healing in the body Let It Be father according to your word and father if it's for the saving of her soul Let It Be Lord Jesus we know that you have given us the token so we can apply it to our very home Lord to our families Lord Jesus and many times we can't explain it we don't understand it but we trust you father because we believe Hallelujah and we know that you never asked us to understand it you never asked us to explain it you only ever asked us to believe it and father tonight we stand here declaring our belief in your word father our belief that you are the great I am that you are the same Pillar of Fire that led Israel out of bondage and into the Promise Land you are the same Pillar of Fire that's with us tonight amen and father we just want to commit this need into your your hand for your glory Lord and let it become a testimony that becomes a song Father we love you and we thank you Father Lord Jesus now we just ask that you would have your will and your way in our service that you would just grant brother Joel a a fresh coal off the altar Lord and father not so much just a fresh coal for brother Joel but give us Hearts to receive you tonight father that we would take the word that's spoken and consider it diligently in our own hearts father we love you we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I just wanted to do announcements but I'm not going to bother let's just get right into the word tonight can we sing that song In The Presence of Jehovah whose presence we are in hearts are mended oh in the presence [Music] of je God Al mightyy he's my prince of peace [Applause] [Music] [Music] heart in [Music] the let's sing it once more in the presence [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the [Music] [Applause] of and hearts are [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen God bless you all you may be seated for a moment amen and so I'm brother Joel from Quebec and so I'm French and I hope you don't hold that against me tonight and you can bear with my franglish amen I'll do the best I can I'm so happy to be here you know brother Eugene he uh he invited me to preach up there in Edmonton for like a year and uh finally he convinced me to come and I knew right away I wanted to come down and spend some time with B A Barry uh because uh we've been starting a new church it's been 9 months now and so I'm a businessman that God has called to be a pastor right then you see where this is going so I thought I need to spend sometime with brother Barry and really try to get as many wisdom out of him as possible as to what's coming and uh and so when when I met him the first time it was back in 2022 in the middle of a snowstorm I remember we drove up there to Red Deer and uh with me and him to meet brother Eugene for lunch and um and so I I really wanted you know to spend a little bit of time with him I didn't thought I'd get to preach and that was not the goal of the but he's been gracious and uh amen I reallyu want to be uh you know in honor and respect Che this pulpit and anyways each time we step in here it's a sacred Duty amen and so pray for us we've been uh starting a new church you know I was born and raised in that message um but I was born and raised in the in the tape church right in in the typ of church uh without Ministry and so when I when God called me to preach it was fairly hard because if you stand in a church where the pastor has doesn't have the right to preach the pastor himself it looks like a dead end right and um and so it was a tough road ahead and uh a lot of praying and considering the will of God because you always want to stay in honor and uh and I believe you know if you leave a church against something you're you're displeasing God right Christians were not called to fight against they're called to fight for fight for truth and uh and so at one point God laid a burden on my heart you know for the lost souls and for the backsliders which are many and and that burden be became so heavy that I had you know to to go to another city and and start a church and uh the Lord has been blessing what amazes me is you know I'm 36 years old and and uh some backsliders that have been in that condition for 40 years which means I've never met I don't even know exist they crossed the doors of the church there was that gentleman you know he crosses the door so I go to greet him and I tell him hi sir do you have a Bible cuz we can give you one right and he says I know the message my friend I'm like oh yeah wow like from where what you know and that brother had been under the the Thunders movement and had been backsliding for 40 years and he shows up one morning you know what amazes me is that those words that Jesus spoke on this rock I I will build my church they've become a reality for me I mean I believe in Outreach I believe in testifying but at the end of the day God does the calling and uh when someone you don't even know shows up and falls in falls in love with God again you know and and never leaves this is just amazing it's wonderful to see the grace of God and um and and that leap of faith you know stepping in the outside world living the church where you've been born and raised and and what comes with it and and to see the Lord bless it in such a way is truly amazing right and so we've been in that you know that part-time facility for 9 months and the Lord has blessed us and the church has voted unanimously to move to a permanent location So within a month or two we have some renovations to do and stuff but soon enough we'll be in our you know all this own little Church of our own and um just pray for for us pray for us because you know the area I'm in there are hundreds of backsliders you know people who came in contact with the word but got scared at the the abuse of the church and and got that's scared at you know these these doctrines and these different man-made things and left back for the world but God wants to send them amen amen none of them will be lost amen and so pray for us that the Lord you know keeps um blessing us in our church is called The Church of the open door and uh and I truly believe that a door that God open that Jesus opens no one can close amen and so there is still an Open Door you see our churches they're not supposed to be lodges and clubs the doors are still open am God is still calling if it was over we would be gone amen so we have to have that heart for the people when Jesus came you know physically on Earth he went to the tax collectors and the prostitutes and and zakus you know the chief of the Publican the head of the publicans and all these people and fisherm and that's where he went he went went to these broken people in need of a savior true and sometimes I feel that has been lost in in our in our circles we Feast on the word you know and but we have to remember that a church is a hospital that's right and so you need doctors you need nurses you need janitors you need front desk and when that hospital is properly functioning then God can start sending his patience he wants to build his church he wants to do it but sometimes you know we open the doors of our churches and it's just a whole bunch of doctors giving themselves high five and patting themselves on the back you know we're all doctors and we made it and we're the bride and something's missing a properly functioning hospital it's got to have patients in there God wants to take care of his people and he's using people to take care of people amen amen amen I hope you came with a big bowl tonight you came ready let's stand up for a word of prayer let's pray father we thank you for your presence among usah Lord we can feel your presence right and I personally thank you God for this wonderful special song that was sung that bless my heart so much thank you for the gifts you place in the body Lord and for the love you've gave the people the desire to serve and Lord take me out of the way tonight I myself have nothing to say but come Lord we want to hear from you come tonight take control of this meeting that anything that be said or done may it be For Your Glory I ask in Jes Jesus name amen so let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 9 you know I remember I told my daughter something one time and she said I get it Daddy and I knew she didn't really get it right any parents ever felt like that you tell your kids something and they say I get it but you know they don't really get it but you can't really say anything because they really think they do and so you just you know have to deal with it and and I thought to myself you know she'll get more as she grows up and amen and uh I I feel like these next verses we're going to read uh we think we get it but we don't you know we read them and we say oh I get it but if we'd really get it it would changed the whole course of our lives and so let's read 1 Corinthians chapter 9 together is that thing working yes it is do you not know that those who run in a race all run but one receives the price run in such a way that you may obtain it and everyone who competes for the price is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a perishable Crown but we for an imperishable Crown therefore I run thus not with uncertainty thus I fight not as one who beats the air but I discipline my body and bring it unto subjection lest when I have preached to others I myself should become disqualified let's turn to Romans chapter 12 and we will read first verse one and this is really a a verse I've been circling back to in the past couple years and Paul says in Romans 12 chapter 1 chapter 12 verse1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as as Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and and what caught my attention in that verse is the fact that we would think that to lay our bodies down as Living Sacrifice would be an extraordinary service like something incredible but Paul says this is your reasonable service amen amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and tonight my topic is all right a timeout a timeout now I'm sure you all know what a timeout is right let's say in sports if for example the Calgary Flames are losing a game and we all know they do and and now the coach towards the end of the game will say okay time out and so a timeout is is a time where the the clock still runs but the game is stopped right they take a time out to assess what's what's going on and what's happening and why they losing the game and take time to reflect for a couple minutes on what's Happening and that's what I want us to do because tonight I want to talk about the Christian Life and throughout the night we will take some timeouts and we will take time to think of our own Christian lives that's what we'll do and so for a moment I want to speak on how to live your life for Christ how to live your life for Christ because there are three powers that motivates Our Lives as human beings not only our Christian life but everything we do in life is motivated by one of these three powers which are passion Duty or tradition either or it's either passion or Duty or tradition and so before we get into the spiritual side of things I I want us to use some real life examples to really understand what I'm talking about and so I would like to see the hands raised of everybody who loves talking on the phone the ones who really love you know to pick up the phone and talk yeah one two you see normally we get between zero and five hands only pretty much nobody loves talking on phone right yet take a young man about 20 years old that falls in love with a young woman he with a young girl and and that young man will spend countless hours on the phone with his girlfriend talking and when they have nothing else to say they will still stay on the phone and listen to each other's breath true true yet we all hate to talk on the phone right and then that exact same young man tell him he has to call the government you know to put something straight with his tax report or something he has to call right it's it's his duty to call as as a citizen try to give him that phone and have him calling he always puts it back to tomorrow like it's going to be tomorrow it's going to be tomorrow it's hard to take up the phone when it's a duty to do it and that same young man you know on on New Year's Eve or something will pick up that phone without even thinking and call Grandma and say happy New Year grandma that call is easy but it's not lasting for hours right it's easy it's tradition he's been doing it for 20 something years it's an easy call but it's a short call there's not much to say right there's no passion in there it's tradition and that honestly reminds me of some bedtime prayers you know they're easy they're short not much to say and so in our lives we do are motivated by any of these three powers think of you know a a new Mama she's got this brand new baby it's it's 6 months old or three months old she hasn't sleep she hasn't sleep for 5 days in a row and then she finally falls asleep and half an hour in the baby does just that little sound like just that little bitty sound and she wakes up like that and runs to that baby despite her being so tired she runs there to see if that baby is okay meanwhile the next morning that he's got an alarm set to go to work he has to wake up and so he snoozes that alarm like three times and crawls out of bed and goes to work why is that it's because mama is motivated by Passion by love for a baby but daddy is motivated by Duty I have to put bread on the table that is my duty you see the difference H if I tell you I want to go to Ukraine to be a missionary you'd say wow that brother is really passionate right and if we' compare that with Jehovah Witnesses for example knocking on doors right and they have to do it it's a duty that's hard that's really hard and then the tradition of going to church for a good old Catholic going to church you know at Easter or in Christmas and you see that you can operate your religion at three different levels depending on what motivates you each individual operates in or within these three levels depending what he's doing we all we all operate under those three forces we do and so the way we approach anything most most likely influence our success and our achievements you see I play sport I play hockey but I don't have the dedication nor the body of an athlet an athlete right it's just I might have the talent raw talent I might be pretty good at it but the passion that would drive me to make the sacrifices to get there is not there and I want you to notice how Paul says I don't run just for fun I don't fight like I Spar like I show up I show off but but I I fight you see my eyes on the price notice Paul uses sport to make a point here and and these these athletes you know their eyes on are on a corruptible price and they put their body through pain and they make sacrifices to win the race and get the price and Paul says I discipline my body and bring it unto subjection and now I want to say that tonight I believe there is only one way to live the Christian Life and it is to be passionate about it am I believe it's the only way but maybe someone in here tonight would say I've never been driven by passion in my Christian Life you know I've never talked to the Lord for hours straight till I have nothing more to say and then still hang on to listen to the Breath of God I did it for my girlfriend but I never done such a thing for the Lord right my friend passion birs in love and so when you truly love something or someone you are passionate and now we tend to think as human beings that if someone is good at something then he must be passionate right good in sport passionate in sport good Christian my that brother is such a good Christian he must be passionate about it but that's not true amen that not that's not true for sport that's not true for your Christian Life you see I realized that listening to an interview of a tennis player a French tennis player his name is Bernard tomik he came up to the 17th best player in the world only 16 ahead of him he was really good here's what he says don't play tennis do something you love and enjoy because it's a tough tough life my position I'm trapped I have to do it tennis chose me it is never something it is something I never fell in love with here's one of the greatest tennis player in the world yet he has no passion whatsoever and I have to tell you my friends tonight that it makes me think of so many message Believers especially the ones born in the church they feel exactly like that I'm trapped I have to do it the message chose me I was born in the church but I never fell in love with it there's no passion right H the message chose me I'm trapped you see brother Braham says you start out with truly Born Again Believers and then the next Generation comes along and they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and that they are now Baptist methodists Etc I want to give you a little hint here each time you read the word Etc in the in the message from now on replace it with the message it works every time you see that that that way of singing the message this didn't existed when brother brandham was alive he couldn't put it that on tape and so he said Etc instead to make sure that everything that would follow and fit that category would be included you just put the message in there and it fits pretty much every time they have taken a denominational name in our in our now Baptist Methodist message that is exactly what they are too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not of the will of man to be saved but these folks are coming together now by the will of men they don't say I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion passion that's the the motivator the the passion to know his his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and that become a little bit formal passion leaves and the church becomes formal now most people most Christian can point to a place in their lives where they were passionate about their Christian lives you see in the last couple years I've talked with a lot of folks especially elders and I found out a strange pattern and that that pattern is we talk a lot a lot about the past like we used to you know we used to we used to pray all night we used used to have big fellowships in our house we used to have all night prayer meeting we used to bring new people to church quite often we used to we used to we used to past Miracles past revivals past all night prayer meetings now I'm not pointing any fingers here I don't even know you but I know one thing our enemy is the same we all fight the same enemy so I believe we're all in the same boat and if we're honest most of us can point back to a place where in our lives we were more passionate about our Christian Life that we are today right we can point and if we have less it means we lost that we lost it amen and so I studied and I really wanted to understand what made it run out and um I found out that it's Satan full time job to make sure we lose our passion you see because Revelation 3r chapter verse 15-7 says I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot H you know the rest hey and now if you drink a hot coffee you know that a hot coffee is hot about that long then it's lukewarm like hot 2° less we call it lukewarm warm and so that hot coffee it's got to be hot 2° less and we don't and we won't even drink it CU it's lukewarm and that cold coffee it's got to be cold really cold so you got this little hot here this little cold here and just about all of that in between is lukewarm and so there are different kinds of lukewarm right but if you are less hot Less on fire for God than you used to be then chances are you lukewarm now there are many reasons I found why our passion dries out and we want to look at a few of them uh we won't study them in details but I just want to put them out there so you know we can meditate on those things and for the rest of the week so let me mention some and the first one is mistakes failure Fe and mistakes you see when I became a Christian I was this defying everywhere I was doing all I could for the kingdom but then I made some mistakes and stopped when God fills you with fire when he fills you with the Holy Ghost you just burn for God you do but Satan will make sure you make some mistakes and when you make them oh Mr critics he comes out of the closet H he comes right at you and make sure you know how bad the mistakes you made were right he does it why does he do it to put your fire down right right fire will push you to work for the kingdom but failure mistakes and critics will tune you down Satan would come and tell you you've done enough now like you've done enough mistakes just sit down and relax cool down a little and so the mistake we make they often kill our passion for the Christian life but I feel it should be the opposite because Jesus said to whom it is forgiven much shall love much and so if I make a lot of mistake but I truly believe that I am forgiven then it should spark even more love in my heart towards God and more more fire in my life that's how it should go just to know that he's gracious through it all but Satan will make sure what you feel is condemnation so that you cool down a little bit and become a bench warmer right failures and mistakes and so here is our first time out of the night did my mistakes and failures Kill My Fire for Christ did I do something I didn't forgive myself yet I stopped just sat on my chair because of my failures the pace of life let's try to get it the pace of Life man our lives are so fast right you know brother says in in the message that he says that we live in a crazy age busy doing nothing and and I often think to myself if he said it in 1960 there was there was no no cell phones in 1960 there was no internet you had to go to the mailbox to mail a letter man what would he say tonight we are often subjected to our lives instead of living it we have no time to stop we have no time to think sometimes right our lives are so fast that we can't even think and so with the kids lesson in the sports and the house and the groceries and and the work and and and and and we sometime give God what we have left and our lives they burn us out but I want to say this tonight tiredness is the result when passion leaves tiredness is the result when passion leaves you know these bikers doing that big event the tour of fr you know most of them about halfway through they start asking themselves what have I got myself into and right there they get so tired that they can't even continue because when passion leaves tiredness sets sin amen that's how it goes and so when you I mean some people can wake up at 5: and I'm one of them wake up at 5:00 to go fishing I mean the alarm clock is at 5: but at 4:30 they're up but they can't wake up at 9:00 to go to work they have to snooze at alarm clock over and over again amen why is that because they are not passionate about their work that's why the moment you start wondering why am I doing all this that question question Sparks tness you've lost passion and so here's my question for you tonight is the life we live so busy and exhausting that we've lost our passion for the Christian Life is it going so fast that all we have is 5 minutes at night or 5 minutes in the morning we've lost passion for it because we're going too fast did that sink in the moment right because we all do yes amen that's the age we live in true Idols my passions you know I believe in a Christian having a Passion I do I love fishing I really love it amen it's my passion but when your Earthly passion for whatever even good things even gardening right even painting I'm not talking about Sin now I'm talking about good things but when your Earthly passion for whatever is greater than your passion for your Christian Life your passion has become an idol in your life and for me a good way to measure it take the measure of my own life is this if I have a really bad day at work or if I'm really stressed out and I come back home and I need some relief I need some time what do I do if I need a breather do I turn the pages of this good old book and read the verses there or do I go on my phone and scroll on Facebook on YouTube or whatever right where you turn to when you need a breather there's a good chance that is an idol in your life and so there are so many sneaky ways the devil uses to dry our passion for God Amen so many sneaky ways he will use whatever passion we have that is the right passion right but he will turn it into an idol in our life something we turn to for Comfort instead of him amen and so here's my question let let time out for a moment then my passions become idols and my life think about that thing you love the most what is it is it Christ is it your Bible or is it something else you see Satan is a specialist to fill our lives with useless thing now I didn't say bad things I didn't say unlawful things Paul says all things are lawful but there are things that burn us out depression burnout anxiety that's the sickness of the century but the Christian he hasn't be he hasn't been created to burn out amen he has been created to burn up that's right so if you're feeling a little burned out tonight right now you sit in church you feel tired and burned out just know that God wants you to burn up amen take courage because tonight tonight we are here to encounter fire right we don't have to wait till tomorrow morning amen we can catch fire tonight Hallelujah last but not least the scars my heartbreaks and my scars take a family for example that loses a member to sickness to cancer and they end up saying why God why I came to church every Sunday you I was faithful we prayed about it why that heartbreak kills your passion it does that's why God wants to heal our hearts because broken hearts cannot be passionate imagine someone spiritually abused in church you know they can come to church they can and they do out of fear in fact they will do it because they're afraid of hell right someone abused spiritually is afraid of hell so they will come to church but they can't be passionate about their Christian Life someone would tell you but brother I have so many scars I have so many scars anybody here feeling that he has so many scars I do I do but I want to tell you this and I wondered at one point you know I was thinking about it when Jesus died on the cross and resurrected why wasn't he perfect like why wouldn't wouldn't you resurrect God in a perfect way without the scars without any blemish and the reason is that the scars are perfect because the are proof of a perfect power to resurrect a perfect power for healing without scars we have no proof you see the world out there they don't have scars their bruises are bleeding still because the only thing that heals right is the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that heals and he heals it completely but he leaves a scar so you can come to someone and say what you're going through that depression that suicidal thought I went through the same look at my scar there's a way out that's what the scars are for out there no scars only bleeding bruises with you know Band-Aids on it they put Band-Aids a beer drug pornography whatever they put Band-Aids on their scars but you can come to them and say look at my scars they're not bleeding anymore put your hand in my scar it's not even hurting anymore I'm Healed and when your scars are healed you are are on fire you have passion but maybe your scars aren't healed maybe your heartbreaks are still fresh and that's why you lost passion here's the question did the trials of Life get the best of my passion do these heartbreaks these battles these trials did they get the best of my passion am I stuck in that sick condition that is sickness my brother right when we say heal we always think about cancer right but he said I've come to heal heal the broken hearts that's what he said he wants to heal your heart tonight he wants to do it and if you let him do it that fire will spark inside you like you can't even imagine amen amen so what happens when you lose your passion cuz if we can all point back to a point in life where we had more passion where we were burning with fire it means that something happens when you lose passion right and so what happens is you go from Passion from Passion you go down one step into duty that's what happens if you lose passion you go from Passion to Judy oh I used to love to go to church I would get there early I couldn't wait for the doors to open to get there and oh I would read my Bible and you dwell on them verses and think about them all day and and nowadays you know I go to church once a week I know it's my duty as a as a Christian H I read my Bible once a day because brother bam said a Christian reads its Bible every day that's Judy there's no passion in there I noticed that everything we do from a Judy standpoint is really hard life is hard when you do something you don't feel like doing but you do it because you know you have to do it oh life is hard it's really hard and so if you ever have a hard time getting out of bed next Sunday to come to church please be honest with yourself and realize that you've lost passion that it has become a duty to come to church on Sunday it has but now you know do something hard for a long period of time you know some of the brothers they go work in a shop or somewhere and they do their time like they count the days till they retire that's what they do man that's hard waking up each morning to go do your time without passion whatsoever but do it long enough and it gets easier am it gets easier but that's not good news right because what happens is when when you operate out of Judy long enough right Judy is here you go down one more step into tradition right that's right right it gets easier because you're getting used to it it becomes an Abit it becomes a tradition and that's not good news that really isn't all right that's not good news you know why because your faith is bound by your tradition right that's what the prophet says he says give your fate a chance turn it loose unbridle it let it work you've got it all bound down with Traditions turn it loose cut it Loose you see when you come to church by tradition your Fai is bound and that is why you can be in church for 30 years be a look like a faithful you know attendee a faithful Christian and all that and come forward and ask for prayer for healing or anything and it seems you can't receive a thing from God it is because you come by tradition right now in church when you speak that kind of message people think oh it's really good for Brother John do it's really good for amen for sister so and so right right that's the way we approach it but we can't do that with this stopping and I want to prove you tonight that out of three people in the church doing the exact same thing right they can be operating out of three different motivations right right we sing and we lift up our hands and one person just lift up holy hands out of love and and out of passion and the person sting sitting next to that lady that that sister is doing it you know because she wants she really wants to be a good Christian she really wants to honor God and and she knows she should lift our hands and that is Duty that's not out of love that's out of Duty and then there's that third sister you know she's been coming to church for 30 years some services are better than the other you know oh I like when this sing my favorite song they haven't sang it in a long time she comes out of tradition and you know she's caught up in the moment and she sings with her lips and her arms raised but when you look at it from the outside they're doing the exact same thing that's why you have to take that mirror for yourself and look inside your heart to see to see which one of these three powers you are motivated by in your Christian walk and so let me give different names to these three powers why uh when they are related to religion right because we use them at work in sports we use these three powers everywhere but when related to religion I've named them you know passion I called it through Christianity I told you earlier I believe there's only one way to serve God and it's to be passionate about our Christian lives you see passion true Christianity is a personal relationship with Christ so the person motivated by Passion is just simply in love with his maker right and he's on fire and that Christian doesn't care what you think he's going to lift his hands anyhow amen it's something between him and God but then when passion leaves you find yourself falling into the performance gospel and the person in that category tries to do enough to go to heaven if you look inside you might have to admit that to yourself it's not something we consciously do but you kind of have to go to church right because you're Christian and so you want to be a good Christian let me tell you something there's no such a thing as a good Christian amen you're either a Christian or you're not a Christian Christian means like Christ that's what it means and so sometimes you do it without even realizing it but you start doing things out of Duty right I because you want you want to go to heaven or you you fear going to hell or you want to be good enough right it's a work-based Salvation you see it's a duty for a man to provide for his family and that's why you got to perform at work when it's related to duty it's related to performing you got to better your situation you got to win at the game of life so your bus comes and r RWS your work and says well done buddy here's a raise two bucks an hour you see it's your duty to provide so you got to perform and you find the same attitude in church from those who live according to the performance gospel they have to perform in church they have to have an office they have to do something they have to clap louder whatever it it represents for them but they feel like they have to do something and then you will find you know in a typical church and I'm sure there's none of them here tonight but you find in a typical church people in love I mean in love with their Traditions right and I call them Pharisees I don't mean to offend anyone but this is a Pharisee spirit it's true these people they are looking for respect and honor yes sir and they care about their traditions in fact they love them and that's why they fall under the category of appearance gospel the appearance the honor and the respect and the way things look right Matthew chapter 15 and G and then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but Jesus answered unto them why do ye transgress the Commandments of God by your Traditions right and so Jesus fired right back he said your Traditions are what transgressed my Commandments and and you know Pharisees they want people to follow the tradition so what they do is they put heavy burden on people this is what they do on their fellow church members they put heavy burden Matthews Chapter 23 verse4 for they bind heavy burden Jesus speaking for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on man's shoulder this is what they do in a Church they put heavy burden on their fellow brothers and sisters and then verse 5 says but all their work they do to be seen of men there goes your appearance gospel why do they do it it's not even now it's not even about you know being good enough to go in heaven no it's about look at me I'm the best Christian in the house that's what it's about and so one is motivated by love that's true Christianity one is motivated by fear that's Judy gospel fear of missing out fear of not being good enough and one is motivated by Pride help us Lord and every time you see someone looking to put a heavy burden on someone else the sad thing is you also find someone who's willing to take on the burden and try to perform and do it well as a duty because they want to be good enough and they want to make it in the Rapture and they want to be as good as the Pharisees and these guys are perfect right read your Bible they would respect every Iota everything and so that person falling under the fear category it has to live up to the Pharisees expectation this appearance gospel so each time you find a Pharisee trying to put down a heavy burden on someone you sadly find someone ready to take on that burden and do it the best they can to be good enough because they want to make the Rapture h and the reason this is so bad is it all comes down to what you put on your altar that's right and I've been thinking about it all week this week you see Behavior manage management managing behavior is what Pharisees do they put you in a system where we control what you do what you can do when you do it and how you can do it we just control your behavior to make you look like a Christian and I've been meditating a lot this week about the way they worshiped in the altar the way it was done in the Old Testament you know and in the Old Testament what's astonishing is that when your offering was accepted by God God would send fire to burn that offering you knew right away if your offering was accepted or not God sent his fire as as a sign of respect and approval of your offering right this is how you knew God accepted it am and and often in our churches we find ourselves out of fire it seems we're there we sing we clap you know we we shout amen yet it seems like we're burned out it seems like we're you know tired it seems like we're we're in a state of depression or anxiety but the question I have to ask tonight is when you Worship in church what is on your Alt alter we want fire we want fire God wants to send his fire the prophet said he wants to send his holy ghost in the church more than the church wants to receive it so it's not on him it's on us but if we got three gospels true Christianity performance and appearance gospel then it means that we got three three different sacrifices on the altar we got the sacrifice of self- Pride self-righteousness we we put our behaviors on the altar often like if I had a good week and I was a good Christian and I prayed and I read my Bible and stuff I come to church and I feel like I can worship brother you putting your good behavior on the altar no wonder there's no fire coming down amen this is filthy rags for this is what it is right stop putting be your good behavior on the altar we have a perfect lamb for the altar we do and if you come empty-handed with an with the perfect Lamb on the altar the fire comes down every time Hallelujah we don't even have to inspect the lamb we don't even have to kill the lamb we don't even even have to do nothing except place that lamb on our altar of worship and fire comes down every time but you're there in church and you you sing a special so that everybody looks at you or or you you lift your your hands and you clap because you you need to do it in order to be good enough Christian and you wonder why you do all that and I still burn out and have no fire because God doesn't accept your worship he doesn't accept your sacrifice it's filthy rags for him he provided himself a perfect sacrifice brother on your worst day right you are a Christian you don't have to wait till you're good enough to come to the altar you have to come knowing you're nothing but the sacrifice is what is perfect even in the Old Testament they never inspected The Sinner they always inspected the lamb we need to stop stop trying to manage our behaviors and put something we're not on the altar you're nothing I'm nothing Paul said when I tried to good bad comes out that's what happens welcome to the club am amen but when I come to church I come knowing I'm nothing but I accept a perfect sacrifice I place that sacrifice on my Altar and then fire comes down and when I get out of church I don't I'm not burn burnout anymore I come out burning with fire amen hallelujah so here's my question which gospel is yours something drove you here tonight something did what is it did you have to come do we have to go to church do we have to dress the way we dress is that a Salvation issue do we have to sing do we have to clap what about it a lot of wom wearing dress will go to hell can I take it one step further yes a lot of women wearing Pence will be in heaven if you do it because you want to be good enough sister you should wear Pence but if you're married to Jesus Christ and you're so in love with your husband that you want to please him and you want to look beautiful for him that's worth all the gold there is in the world Amen but as soon as you step you know in the you get in the church there is Mr Pharisee he's the first one want to get to you before Christ does sometimes and he's there with his book of compliance and he wants you to comply to a whole bunch of rules and I mean you want to go to heaven right you want to be a Christian you wouldn't cross these doors if it wasn't so and so you start putting your works on your altar stop it yes amen come at you are amen now my time is out I want to speak to the young people I want to speak to the young people I was born in a mage church and so we we've been saying you know passion Judy tradition when when in fact you know if you're born in a miss church it's actually the opposite because when you are young you have no choice even like your parents go so you go and you know maybe there's Sunday school maybe we give you chocolate that when it's Easter whatever a gift a Christmas you you do drawings and stuff and it's just a tradition on Sunday we go to church but then when you're 16 you get your own car and so you get to make your own decisions kind of you had to go before it was just a tradition but now you have a choice will you go to church or will you stay home right and so it becomes a duty to go you know you should go and so you try to wake up on Sunday morning and and you try to be there before the song service ends you know because it's a duty you have to do it at least once every two weeks or something it's a duty but you need to meet God face to face amen man that life is hard buddy don't stay in that Duty Zone this is hard meet Christ face to face right that'll make come into church amazing right incredible amen now I went hard on Judy the past half hour or so and I can almost hear some of you say I thought you know we Christians had judies is the brother saying we don't have duties as Christians you know when I spoke about that topic to my wife she said it's a good thing to have a sense of Duty is it true here am I like going against Judy yet it seems that we have judies I searched post of Judy you know in the message and 132 quotes came up 132 and so there's something about Judy I just want to read one quick you see I thought it would be a blessing for you and you people who have little churches here who's struggling my advice would be for you to stand at your post of Duty just as loyal as you can to the cause of Christ and back up your minister and everything that's going on for the cause of Christ and do that and God will bless you amen that's good so we need a balance right amen and so we've talked about passion disregarding Judy but let's go back to the first verse we we read which was first Corinthians chapter 9 but let's start a little bit um ahead to verse 16 instead of verse 24 to get a little bit more of more context about what Paul is addressing here so let's start at verse 16 together Paul says for though I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glory of for the necessity is laid upon me yes a woe unto me if I preach not the gospel now if this is not Judy I don't know what it is this is straight up Judy right it is but then he goes on verse 17 for if I do this thing willingly I have a reward you'd rather do it with passion that's where the reward lays but if against my will a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me what is my reward then verily that when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge that I abuse not my power in the gospel for though I be free from all men yet I have made myself servant unto all that I might gain the more listen to that carefully right how he's acting about preaching the gospel For unto the Jew I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jew to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without the law of God but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that are without law to the weak I became became I as weak that I might gain the weak I am made all things to all men that I might by all means save some that is not JY brother right amen that is not dudy if Paul did accomplish his duty without passion he could have stand on a on a corner of the Street on Sunday morning for an hour and kind of preach the gospel you know it's my duty I have to do it so let me take you know an hour a week and preach the gospel but he starts by saying it's a duty but then he shows us how he goes about this Duty he does it with passion to the weak as weak to the Jews as Jews he he says I am made all all things to all men that I might by all means save some and I do this for the gospel's sake that I might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in the race run all but one receiveth the price you see there we're back he shows us how he is going about his duty with passion amen he said my duty is to run but my passion drives me to sacrifice and to run like someone who wants to win the prize he could just run you know he could just fight like someone who beats the air but that's not what he does so run that ye may obtain and every man that St striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we and Incorruptible therefore I therefore so run not has uncertainly so fight I not as one that Beth the air but I keep my body and bring it unto subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away now let me end with this quot baham says that's the only way you can do the right kind of a job for the Lord is put everything you got right to the for Forefront for Christ all your strength all your soul all your heart all your mind everything that you've got when you're doing anything do it right or don't do it at all see just leave it alone if you're going to be a Christian put everything that you've got to Christ that's your time your talent your everything everything now without passion this is impossible to live without passion you will put some of your time right some of your strength some you will put some some of your heart some of your mind that's what you'll put but to come and to put all you've got you need passion my brother you see Paul says in Colossians 3 and whatsoever you do in works or deeds do all in the name of the Lord Jesus and a bit further in verse 23 says when whatsoever you do do it hardly as to the Lord and not unto men and the only way to do what the scripture tells us is fire that is the only way we need our hearts set on fire we need our fire in our souls you know when Moses met fire there was no more question then he was going to take over a oneman Invasion amen God's here tonight to meet us face to face you see there is a way back to fire there is a way back to fire we need to repent from our Idols say oh Lord I have a passion for sport for painting for gardening for whatever but I'm sorry that I turned to this passion for Comfort instead of you I made these things I Idol in my life forgive me Lord my life is going so fast so fast Lord there are so many things to do in my life then often you get what I have left in a day I'm so sorry Lord I want to put you first come and fill me with the Holy Ghost and Fire Lord I feel burnt out lately I don't want to be burnt out Lord I want to burn the burn for you I want to come out of this meeting filled ignited ready to do all thing heartily he has unto you Lord whether it be go to work raise the kid you know washing the dishes read my Bible whatever Lord if I do it for you then my life will be a Living Sacrifice you see what is amazing for Christians is that people out there they need to find passion for their work passion for the the home passion for the wife passion for the kids passion passion passion we Christians have been handed a key right amen have been handed a key if we do everything has to the Lords amen then we will have passion going about everything amen if we are passionate about our Christian life amen you see if I do everything if I wash dishes as unto you Lord then my actions will be acts of worship to you am then my life will be a living sacrif rice if I give part of my heart my life is not a Living Sacrifice that's right if I give part of my time my life is not a Living Sacrifice I need to give it all amen and then Paul says this is your reasonable service oh church God is here tonight let us not stay in that lukewarm condition let's catch fire again let's put the perfect sacrifice on the Altar and let's worship amen if you'd like to say God I want to put you first I want a closer relationship I want to live for you raise your hand as we pray musicians could come up amen let's pray oh Jesus our hands are empty Lord we have nothing to put on the altar nothing that would be of worth but you provided a perfect sacrifice Lord see our empty ends that are raised as we surrender to you Lord we come asking for forgiveness we come asking for mercy and we know we are forgiven let that forgiveness spark even more love in our hearts let our worship be through and sincere come with your fire lord if someone is burned out tonight give him strength if someone needs passion Lord fill their hearts with fire reignite love Lord restore to us the joy of our salvation and renew thy Spirit within us this is our prayer tonight and we pray it in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ amen I give myself away you know that song I give myself away no do you have the lyrics for this one we could raise As we sing I give myself away okay oh Lord I give myself away so you can me I give myself away oh I give myself away so you can me oh here I am here I I stand Lord my life is [Applause] [Music] your oh I give myself away [Applause] Lord I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away Lord I give myself away so you can take

Lord I give myself I give myself so give myself [Applause] give myself away so you can use me amen did you hear from your theophany tonight we came we asked to hear from God and I believe we did we heard directly from the throne this wasn't just of a man you know there's a lot of things that I heard tonight that we all heard tonight and I just think there's one thing that I heard that just stands out above it all to me and it's simply this is that Christians are not designed Christians are not intended they're not made to burn out yes come on they're made to burn up hallu and if we're burning out something's wrong and I think we heard loud and clear if we're burning out we need to take a look at what's on our altar right because he provided one sacrifice and that was enough for every single man every single time every single place I think it's just amazing God bless you brother thank you for your service tonight I I I don't know I so many points tonight please uh remember the prayer meeting tomorrow night at 7:30 at the church we uh I I I I I think this is one of those Services where I'll go back and listen again and again so many points in there so many nuggets that we can take and and use in our lives it all comes down to our altar though what's on our altar my my my my can we just sing that song Lord You're Beautiful as we close tonight maybe we could just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're so thankful for the word that you gave to us father and Lord we know that many times we fail in our lives and father we come from different walks and different backgrounds and different things but Lord Jesus I pray that tonight if anything has ever altered our ability to walk with you that father you would forgive us for it and that Lord Jesus maybe if we're not even aware of it that Lord you would bring it to our remembrance and that we could quickly make it right we know that you have provided a way for us and father there's only one provided way in this age and that's truly with you and father tonight I believe that's the desire of every single Christian is to take you by the hand Lord to have you take us by the hand and to have that intimate relationship where you can live out through US Lord Jesus where your fire is present in our lives father we thank you for the word tonight we pray that that you would be with brother Joel and his family Lord Jesus we pray that you would watch over the open door Tabernacle in Three Rivers Quebec Lord Jesus that you would continue to watch over that work Lord that you would give him a continual Revival in his life Lord and in his church father we pray that you would Grant him traveling mercies and when he goes home father that he would have a spring in his step Lord because he knows that he was encouraging to your people we love you we thank you we ask that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways watch over the prayer
