take a couple minutes and bring the rest of the chairs back up tonight is a Monumental service because it's the end of this Behavior as far as we can tell we can get rid of the tables we can get rid

for the grace that God has shown us and it's a it's certainly a blessing to be here tonight why don't while you're standing why don't we just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we want to give you thanks again this evening Lord for another opportunity Lord Lord we realize father that the laws of the land have uh have put us in such a place Lord that we are we've had to be in obedience to them Lord and we are as children of God we know that we are not above the laws except the time comes when they tell us what we can't preach and so tonight Lord Jesus we want to respect that as much as we can and Lord we realize that the law that you hold is not constrained by walls and buildings lord it's not constrained by glass we know that this word that with that in is abiding within us is powerful Lord and Lord It's sharper than a two-edged sword Lord is not bound by man's Traditions or man's ideas father it's not even Bound by these walls Lord for we know that across the across the the internet Lord the digital world Lord our voices are being proclaimed and Lord we know that there is a voice that is being proclaimed for the voice of the bride and the voice of the Prophet are saying the same thing in this age Lord there's a bride that's being made ready father and tonight Lord we come for that purpose oh God we just ask that you would wash Us Again by the water of the word take the hearer Lord take the speaker take each one Lord present those that are online Lord break the bread of life to us Lord may we once again may we say it's been good to sit at your feet father we give you thanks we give you praise and glory for all things in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen and God bless you you may have your seats I just wanna take a moment and bring greetings from the Tabernacle back home my brother erno texted me this afternoon he said make sure and greet the saints that are here and and uh brother Blair sister Rebecca good to see you I think there's more just about as much visitors as there is home Folk and uh I'll tell you what Sunday is going to be a happy day Sunday is going to be a happy day and we've all I think we've all been subjected long I say this we've all been subjected long enough and uh I'll just be as much as you're looking forward to it we're going to be looking forward to it too and we we've got to I guess we're just a little behind you you guys are ahead of us I don't know I think uh what's BC like brother Blair communistic to the Core yeah we'll so are the rest of us you know I can say that freely I can say that freely because a prophet of God said in 1956 or 1957 he said that communism has honeycombed the United States oh it's it's flogged it's portrayed like we're like we're all just Free People we're all free people but it's not at all there's a spirit that has come up underneath and it's absolutely its grip has taken a hold and for all these years it has suddenly gone this way in that way but I'll tell you what a prophet told us it was there then now look you're seeing with your eyes the force that's coming up underneath that little spirit that was a uh maybe I'll say it like this like was was the white horse rider you know better than this but I want to portray it just this way in a moment you know how he come with his little doctrine that we're just Free People we're just free it's all good it's all good you just go ahead and live your life and we can have the Canadian dream we can have the America but just wait a little while pretty soon he begins to show his other face and now you're going to do what we're going to tell you to do and it won't be long this is Brother Brown's talked about that he talked about that red horse rider he said watch he said his sword was bloody red and he said it will be that way again you see that Spirit hasn't died but neither listen church that Spirit hasn't died but then neither has Christ there is a people that are anointed to rise up above all that she's not going to be here he's going to take her home and we're I just believe we're part of that people tonight and and I I'm thankful to be part of the body of Christ I say the body of Christ everywhere but uh but here in Saskatchewan and uh in in Alberta BC isn't it good to know that wherever we go that God's got people and that that same spirit is what binds us together it's it's this word that we hold so dear to our hearts so real to us and uh God bless you good to be here again this evening and I know ordered you know brother Barry told me this he I felt like giving him a expressing my love to him Brother Bear he met me at the door we were talking and he said I both fell down because I know I saw him here last time without a tie on so I even diligently asked my wife do

you Lord Hallelujah God bless you thank you sister Becky thank you brother Kevin thank you to the Musicians God bless you all you got your Bibles you'd stand with me this evening turn over to the book of First Kings chapter 18. I was sitting in my truck the other day and and just waiting on the Lord and you know how sweet he is sometimes he just comes right down in there and begins to unveil himself and you know one little scripture ties to another and you're busy writing you're busy writing and I thought well that must be what he wants me to speak here and uh so I I put it all down and you know I I couldn't feel that same way this afternoon and so I don't know what he's got in mind uh but I feel that this subject tonight or this thought tonight will be a blessing for you kind of led me this way First Kings chapter 18. and I want to start reading it verse 41. First Kings 18 and 41 and it says Elijah Sunday Ahab get the up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain so Ahab went to eat and to drink and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and he said to his servant go up now look towards the sea and he went up and looked and he said there's nothing and he said go again seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there Arise at the little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain an Ahab Road and went to Jezreel and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezebel God bless you you can have your seats if I could uh if I could put a title on on my little thought this this evening would be the abundance of rain you know Elijah had been in a time uh this had been an hour in his time this has been an hour in their country this has been an hour that a people of God had actually been in a a a not just a spiritual drove but they had been in a natural drought and the reason that they'd been in a natural was was the fact that that uh you know they had turned their backs on God they had they had had a word of God come to them they had a prophet in the land but the but the world around them had been so enticing and to be so let me say this way the enemy had been so seducing he had been he had been so he had so seductively brought them in until the place brother Brown said this the scripture says this they begin to lust after the flesh pots the land they were living in had so much to offer and and Ahab in his rule you know uh we recognize Ahab as an as a backslidden Believer brother Branham called him he was he actually knew right he was actually raised up in in truth and yet he got his eyes off the truth and he began to he began to uh he began to be allured until finally he married a jezebel a woman that was actually a priestess of the Roman gods and and here he is he allowed that into his home and he's become a he's become a king and the whole Kingdom has has spiraled down oh how what it should tell us about leadership in this hour look at our Nations right now look at our countries that we're living in look at the very situation that's going on here here we're sitting tonight and and we could call it the same way tonight how you're hungry to see this building full of Believers again how you desired to see the the chairs put out and the and the building full and everyone rejoicing and and worshiping the very God that that we believe that is alive today and and is ever present and yet here we are with the same desires they were in a natural drought and here we are spiritually feeling like somehow we've had a drought and we need to get back to where we were that's how we feel tonight we we believe that the word is here we believe we've got the word we believe but we feel like something's missing that that we want to see everything restored the way it was before this all transpired and we we realize that that they had been in a backslidden condition they had the nation had come to a backslidden place and and they got to the place where all they could talk about was was what God used to be and the things he used to do and how he used to be in and oh my listen remember Church they were in a drought literally the people around them were dying the Rivers had dried up the Brooks had dried up the streams had dried up cattle had died listen we're just experiencing a heat wave right now like we've never experienced for a long time 36 37 degrees I'll tell you what if this kept on for one month two months those crops would burn up and you wouldn't you wouldn't think much of it now but come fall and your grocery prices Skyrocket you would be complaining too pretty soon it would be down on your table you'd be realizing that there's a cost to everything and here they got into the place where there was where everything their sustenance around them had dried up and died and and what was God doing they had already heard Elijah's message they'd already heard the truth they'd already heard it and because they rejected it now here comes the wrath of God upon them and God's God's God's come what's he doing he's pushing him to a place of a showdown listen every one of us is going to be put in this place tonight every one of us is getting is going to be pushed to a place where you better know where you stand in Christ you better know that the god that you're serving is not just a letter or a dead letter or a gospel that Grandpa preached or daddy preached her or Mommy believed but that the god that you serve is a living God that that he's just as much God right now as he has ever been God or ever will be God listen he hasn't forgot us he hasn't he hasn't just deemed us as unimportant but His Eye Is on the Sparrow and he's watching us daily remember when when Elijah after this great Showdown remember Elijah was he end up in the wilderness out there and he's all troubled and and oh God I'm the only one I'm the only one and I've been zealous for for the kingdom of God and God rebukes him says no Elijah you're not the only one There's 7 000 others that have never bowed their knee to bail they've they've never kissed his finger they believe the same message that you preach and they're standing faithful on it listen there is a widow woman they're not in that drought there was a widow woman that God fed daily we're going to promise church that regardless of our situation regardless of where we're at I don't I don't know about you I don't want to be caught just talking about a god of the past I don't want to just tell everybody about the God of the past but I want to talk about the God of today I want to talk about what God is doing now I want to give God glory for for what he's doing in my life today for for for keeping us and we heard testimony again brother Paul you brought it up he's Jesus Christ the same cancer means no more to him today than it ever did tuberculosis means no more kovid means means no nothing means any more to God I am the Lord your God that healeth all your diseases and forgives all your iniquities I'll tell you what David said blessed is the man and whom the Lord impute is not his iniquities there is a people on Earth that God doesn't impute sin and iniquity to I want to be that person that's standing there that day listen they've been standing there here's a prophet of God that stood there in that hour he walked right up into the face of the king and said not even do will fall till I call for it you talk about a power that's in God's people listen Church you talk about this is before the holy ghost ever fell this is before the holy ghost ever fell that same God that was there in Elijah that day is the same God you forgive me but there's nobody for 30 feet so I can just preach over here that same God I don't know about you I have a terrible time being massed up and being cornered up I feel like I'm a dog on a chain when I get like this so you just forgive me but listen that same God that was in Elijah thou walked boldly into the face of Ahab and said not even do is going to fall until I call for it is the same God that is now walking in the midst not just in the midst of his people he's walking in his people in the darkest hour that has ever been how blessed are we tonight to know this God is leading his guiding he's given us a sure a sure Foundation to walk on Hallelujah what an hour there's their kingdom was spiritually dying and and I just want to lay this as a background tonight I would say this way they had spiritually dried up and were dead the joy of the Lord was gone their thoughts towards God had been skewed they had to entertain the things of the world that too many there had been too many voices that they'd heeded too many voices and it had stolen their Joy listen church we get caught in these same things there's voices voices voices and voices but there's only one voice there's only one voice that we need to hear and that is the voice of God to this age I don't care about what John Gormley you guys probably don't even get him here he's some talk show host I don't care what he has to say I don't care what they preach I don't care about 540 radio or 650 radio or enlightened radio or whatever other radios you want to listen to It's all lying vanities there's one voice there's one truth and all other voices are meant to distract you they're meant to take away or you just feed on that for a little while Church you just feed on that stuff for a little while you'll find yourself just as Barren and as dry spiritually as Israel was that day not a blade of grass not a flower not nothing was growing why because they had turned their they turned their ears and their hearts from the one true living God you do the same and you'll find you sit here tonight in a message Church totally dried up spiritually and wondering where is that God of Elijah hallelujah oh God be merciful listen the word that was sent is powerful it's Sharp God sent it for a purpose he said did not it was a rebuke Ahab but listen it was life to that little widow woman the same God the same word the same voice it was a rebuke to Ahab but it was life to a little widow woman both of them starving Hallelujah when God speaks once if God ever says anything it can never be changed it's the end of it brother Brown says this he says it says Oh my he says he says I'm going to tell you something that's going to choke you I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man that's fully surrendered to God is omnipotent omnipotent what is the word omnipotent means a power without bounds or authority without bounds here's Elijah walking into the face of a man here's a man a man born in sin shaped a a man that had a temper a man that had problems in his life here's a man walking into the face of another man and saying not even do is going to fall kill I call for it if some if if I said that to you would say who Do You Think You Are but he had thus saith the Lord he had thus saith the Lord a man's voice God in a man you don't believe in a man that's fully surrendered to God oh Church of God how we ought to be so surrendered tonight did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever you say you don't doubt it'll come to pass you can have what you said now listen what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together through omnipotence some things got to shake whosoever you would say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he promised it he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass what's the Holy Spirit been trying to get to us for the last 50 years Church you say well brother Dwayne you haven't even served in God 50 years you're right I haven't even been serving God 50 years but that same voice that same word that came back in 1947 1949 what is the holy spirit been trying to get to the church to his little elect lady that you and him are one and the same it's not just God that you know we get so tied up on the godhead thinking oh yeah father son Holy Ghost that's a trinity Doctrine but listen there's such a reality to this they are one the father and the son are one but Jesus said that we also are one like him and that's what Satan has been trying to keep from us that you are actually the very spirit being of God manifested now in a many-membered body that makes you the omnipotence of God being manifested now oh how powerful are the words we speak tonight no wonder Satan wants you to discourage you no wonder he wants to get you distracted because if we can ever get surrendered to God what is going to stand in the way of this little elect lady not nothing not no devil in hell not no not no seducing Spirit not no Antichrist Spirit not nothing is going to stand in her way Hallelujah whatever you say would that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing he promised it he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because what two omnipotents have met listen he's not talking about himself he's not talking about Elijah of old he's not talking about some prophet of gone days not a Daniel not an Ezekiel not a Jeremiah he's not talking about just a preacher he is literally talking about you and Christ are one and if he can recognize what we are that's why we're here to let the word wash us that if we can recognize what we are by the grace of God listen we're nothing on our own but by the grace of God Jesus could say I come from God I go to God this little bride is saying I come from God this world's not my home I'm going back to God what is God we want to make him one like our finger but he's a many-membered being his spirit is just how do you contain God if he's God now in this flesh listen church if that God is living in this flesh is there not enough power in this flesh to step into another another dimension another world in the moment in the twinkling of an eye he's promised it's gonna happen Hallelujah I'm so thankful for the word that's coming this hour that same word in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and we want to say and that was Jesus yes it was but he was the firstborn of many brothers is what the scripture says what is that that's a supernatural being in a fleshly body a God man in a fleshly body what about you what about me same God men in a fleshly body have taken on the very name Jesus Jesus and there's no other name in heaven there's no other name on Earth there's no other name anywheres every knee will bow to that name and someday not to us but to the lamb that was slain and tonight we can bow our knees in glory and honor and praise to know that he I was there then and now he placed me here now that I might reflect him in this age for what for one purpose that this world this world here in Calgary would know Jesus Christ lives Hallelujah God's got people right now a church I feel good tonight God's got people right now in the 20th century that literally are manifesting God to this present world and they're blind and they're and they can't know it they don't know it they can't see it there he is just like he was then walking amongst them and they knew him not you and I are walking amongst them in this world and they can't recognize that there goes Christ there goes Christ but blessed are your eyes they see all my praise God how are we to treat one another church but we're if our eyes are open to this how are we to treat one another I want our words to be to each other oh God help us tonight oh I need you Lord I need you praise the Lord Elijah come back with purpose Elijah was sent back into ahab's present with purpose he had already called the drought on the land but now God told him you go back what was he doing now I want us to stop and think for a minute because we can find a parallel in this to the very things that's happened in our in our own day here's Elijah has walked back into an into a nation of God's people that is absolutely turned their back on him and Elijah's message has not only brought Redemption for for a little widow woman but it's actually brought a curse upon the whole nation same message and now God tells him go back go back I'm going to bring my word to a showdown the word that I have there present in that hour is going to stand good for The Showdown so here comes Elijah he he walks right back up into aab's presence he says gather the people together gather the people together we're going to find out if this word listen Church it's coming it's coming this word that you've been washing yourself with this word that you've been feeding on you've taken the book and you've eaten the book and the book is becoming life in you this very word that you're feeding on tonight is going to be the very word that's going to stand up right in the face of it all and it will overcome it does overcome it has overcome but one day it's going to give you a body change the final thing to overcome is going to be what I want to say this right now gravity holds us here this whole this being is caught in this Dimension but there's one thing coming that's there's not going to be it's no more is it going to be held in this demand we're going to cross dimensions I'll tell you what it makes me think of this now this forgive me if this sounds terrible but you think of the perversion of this world they've got cross dressers what are they doing men trying to be women women trying to be men but here we are as sons of God in this hour we come from a different dimension standing here on this Earth we've crossed Dimensions do you realize right now Time and Eternity is Blended it's Blended you are coming from an eternal an eternal Dimension and living in a in in a in a Time Dimension but your spirit man is calling something is calling your your theophan he's drawing you and you're actually rising up in the presence of God here the spirit of God has told you come up a little higher and you're moving you say well I don't see it brother Dwayne you are because if you're the same person as you were three years ago you got a problem if you're the same person you worked a month ago you got a problem he's called us to come up higher so every day we need to be moving on moving on moving on praise God Elijah come back to put things my goodness I won't need these things pretty soon I'm thankful for that Elijah had come back to put things in order and isn't that just what God did to this age to the to the very last age he brought in Elijah on the scene for what for one purpose to bring things back into order what for because there was a people that God was going to Rapture there was a people that God was dealing with he'd come for his own people so here comes Elijah and if you go back and read the story we're not going to do it tonight but you go back and read the story you'll find out Elijah calls a showdown and the word always brings a showdown in our in our lives church every time you watch Daily the word is bringing a showdown in your life absolutely you're going to be faced with something tomorrow that the word the holy spirit is going to say you got a choice to make what are you going to make I wouldn't do that son I wouldn't do that daughter that little still small voice is going to cause you to make a decision I believe this that we're sons of God led by the spirit of God therefore that God will give us the ability to make the right decisions I just believe that but Elijah had come on the scene and now there was going to be a showdown he gathered he said he says call in all the prophets of Baal call in all call in all the prophets that sit at Jezebel's table you know there was a god called Prophet standing there and he was calling for all the what we call him the prophets of Baal were one one group of prophets but there was another group of prophets that were the prophets to Israel that sat at Jezebel's table simply because she fed them and therefore they didn't have the courage to speak truth God will judge them thus he said call him in call them in let's put God to the test let's put God's word to test now that's a good thing for us tonight Calgary Living Word let's put God to the test God don't mind being tested listen this great God we serve he don't mind being tested you got a problem go to God you go tell them about your problem but don't stand there and boohoo about it and don't stand there and weep and complain about it and don't stand listen that widow woman I'm sure she wasn't boohooing she was simply trusting God in all of the all of the drought in all of the trial and all the struggle watching her own children waning away her own little son waning away she was still trusting God I believe that we have the same opportunity tonight God gives us the opportunity tonight to trust him I'll tell you what so yeah absolutely he lets things go wrong he lets them go that way on purpose what for so that we can put his word to the test father you said so Lord you see my situation I don't know what to do about it but you promised me Lord that not only would you not leave me or forsake me but that you would show me the way you would direct my steps oh God that's my desire Hallelujah what an hour Elijah come and he tore down all the oh he tore down the altars he tore down the idols he tore down the Groves and then he begin notice the story he began to rebuild he began to rebuild he took the Rocks he took the he began to make an altar God's provided way and when we come God's provided way we can expect God's can expect God's results you know many times we come our own way we we forgive me for saying this but I know I'm not just preaching to the people here so about but people come we we find ourselves being raised up many times in message homes and I guess I can just look out across some of us are 50 plus brother Paul you're you're older than I am and and uh probably the Elder here tonight and God bless you for it and uh but even as an elder you were raised in a message home you're the Elder here tonight you were raised in a message home and so was I and so are you and brother Blair so were you and and I think brother you probably were too those are the ones I know they were raised in a message home we always want to throw off on all the denominations oh it's just them it's just them but listen the scripture says we must be born again we got children right now we we got I want to say almost grandchildren that are raised in message homes possibly even great grand great can I say great four generations for sure yep that's absolutely right brother Barry your children right now are four generations brother Pete brother Paul Sister Lisa and your that's four generations raise in the message home you know our children know how to walk right because we taught them right they know the right talk because we taught them right they know what the word says because they heard it they understand some of them can walk and talk and still without revelation they may even be justified in their walk maybe be Sanctified they've never come to that real filling of the Holy Spirit that's a dangerous place for us to be in that's a dangerous place for us to be and we're coming right to the end where only those with the Holy Ghost are going to be there and sometimes we just like to tell everybody oh you're okay you're okay no no you're not okay until you get the Holy Ghost and I don't care if you're 10 years older if you're 60 years old or 80 years old without the Holy Ghost you're in trouble I'm in trouble listen Brothers we need more than anything we need the Holy Ghost we need to know that we know that we know that we know I don't want just a good way of life I don't want just a nice Fellowship I don't want just nice people to shake hands with it and have coffee with but I want to be with the people of God that are filled with the power of God that filled with the spirit of God whose very desire whose very life is is subjected to him and him alone and here they sat here's all the children of Israel we can't blame them let's just look at our own doorstep he called God called them all on the scene God called them all and said all right now listen you've turned your back on me and you've proclaimed that Baal is God and you you're happy with the just the way you are you're contented just were they bad people I don't believe for a minute they were bad people they were just as lovely a people as they were before you realize that you can walk over to a Pentecostal church you can go to a Baptist Church I know Catholic people that are some of the finest finest people you ever met in your life would put us to shame as message people they ain't no more saved than nothing if they've never received the blood of Jesus Christ so just to be a nice person isn't good enough God calls a showdown God brings our lives to that place where we've got to know that we know that we know that we know and there stood Elijah and after he said you go ahead and call on your Gods go ahead call your God on the scene and we'll just whichever God is going to answer by fire that's the God we're going to serve listen Elijah's God was a consuming fire not just a painted fire but a consuming fire it was enough fire in him that went Elijah's God came on the scene that even the Rocks not just the wood but it devoured the rocks it devoured the water it cleaned up everything listen what kind of God do we serve tonight what kind of God are we serving in our lives if he's that powerful of God when you serve him though if we come to him the way he asks us to come and if he's that powerful of God that he can consume listen he'll consume your Revelation tonight he'll consume my Revelation he'll consume My Sacrifice if we'll come with a pure heart before him our God is more than able tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah I like what bro what what Elijah said he said listen Elijah was calling for rain Elijah The Showdown was coming Elijah had said listen the god that answers by fire he's the God we're going to serve but we we we really we realize after the great Showdown that God they were still in drought they were still in a drought because the word had not come forth yet to change the scene God had proved himself and the people had repented and said that's the God we're going to serve and when they finally repented oh Church of God if we could just get this tonight how many times in our lives do we come to God and oh God you know my situation Lord you know where I'm at oh God I don't know what else to do most of the time it's because we there's a little something in our past that we haven't repented for we there's too many times amongst message people where we just Shuffle things under the carpet oh you know what I mean and we just push it under no no no no no God wants up repentance from your heart God wants to know you right from the depths of your heart that you've you know what does the word repent mean it means actually change your mind not just press reset not just do this not just just shovel it under the carp and say well we'll pretend that didn't happen we'll just no no it happened and God is requiring you to do something about it and when you're willing to humble yourself and do something about the consuming fire of God is still just as powerful tonight as he was then when the people repented Elijah immediately went up on the on the hill and he and he called for rain he says he said I hear the sound listen they are in a drought and the voice of God comes and says I hear the sound of abundance of rain not just a not just a little sprinkle of rain I was at a I was at home out at the farm the other day and the man who rinsed my field was he was out there looking at it and he said he said Dwayne he said where's the rains that they used to have the three the four of the one week soaking rains where are they at anymore I said yeah I said the world sure seems like it's in chaos doesn't it he doesn't want to hear the gospel he's heard it listen Elijah wasn't calling for an overnight shower God don't want to just give you a little moisture like sometimes we do on our plants we give them 20 minutes or or 30 minutes listen God was wanting to literally God all the seeds that were in the ground when it was dry were still there just waiting on the moisture of God the spirit of God to take to have us Abode in their lives and when Elijah called for rain he said I hear the sound listen here's the voice of a man I hear the sound of an abundance of rain I'm reminded of a prophet of God who said There will come a time when when you're when your brother's crops are burning up and you speak the word and say brother is I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and what is it he said you will say I send you rain two omnipotence meaning how can you help it it's got to transpire never said Elijah and he said he said I hear the sound of abundance or rain Elijah didn't stay there he literally went up on top of the mountain and he took his servant with him and he said go check he had an expectation he knew he had done what God called him to do he knew that he was right before God therefore God would answer what he was asking for he wasn't asking amiss he was asking and there was a great need in the land god your people have made themselves right now God to answer by rain you've answered by fire now water the ground Lord here's gehaza first day first hour I don't know how many days it took maybe if I don't even know how far he was from the mountain from the ocean you know we just read it that they were standing there overlooking the ocean but but maybe they weren't I don't know the geography maybe maybe Hazel had to go 20 miles to find rain to find enough rain to or or look over top of the ocean maybe you had to go through mountains and valleys and and I don't know but maybe he walked us 20 miles and came back and said there's nothing what did Elijah say go look again listen this is like us go look again the next day go look again go look again I give up God must not have answered my prayer shame on us Elijah's word was truth he said there would be an abundance of rain Elijah wasn't concerned he wasn't worried the Bible said he just sat down on the ground put his head between his knees what was he doing waiting for rain how many times do we ask God oh God you know my need Lord you know my need and one day goes by in two days goes by three days goes by and we're like oh God I guess you must not have heard me Lord you surely you know God heard you I wonder if we expect when we ask we have not because we ask not we don't ask us what we don't believe when he said ask abundantly what that your joy would be full ask abundantly that your joy would be full he knows your exact situation and he said ask well Lord you know where I'm at no he's waiting for you to ask how many times do we we listen we are the children of God brother Brown told you this he would bankrupt heaven for you he did because the value the very value of Heaven itself which was its creator actually left its career actually left its glory and stepped down into this Earth he actually bankrupted heaven for you all the power that was in God was standing right there on Earth the very God of creation came for one purpose for me you talk about bankrupting heaven do you think that that same God would leave us destitute not a chance not a chance he knows where we're at in our lives he knows our situation he knows what you have need of and he's waiting for you to ask he's waiting for me to ask my goodness what an hour there he was three times four times five times you see anything not nothing yet go look again I'll tell you what sometimes can I just backpedal just a little bit here sometimes this is where we get to in our Revelation with our walk with the Lord God's got the windows of Heaven are open the blessings of God are there the power of God's all there we get hunkered down on a little Revelation in our life and we think we got it we put our period right at the end of our revelation we think we've got it and God's telling you no there's more go look again put a comma go look again I don't see anything Lord go look again Ask abundantly that your joy would be full go look again and pretty soon gehaza came back listen church I don't know this but I know the seventh time there might have been one Church Age Two church ages three Church ages four Church ages on the seventh Church age an abundance of rain was promised I will send you the former and the latter rain all in one month it's all coming to you listen be expecting it church we come to church without expectation too many times we just walk in the door and sit down and and God understands but listen he understands but he doesn't he's expecting you to expect Lots the very expectation of God lays within you and he wants to express himself how does he Express himself to you if you don't come expecting this is how we are listen a preacher can't even preach if you don't expect amen that's just the way it works brother Paul how many times I can say this how many times have you stood here and you know when the people come under such a they're they're pulling they're hungry they want to worship you know in your spirit it's just so easy to worship the next time you get up there and you begin to sing and some are sitting there and some are tired I'm not I'm not rebuking anybody hey we're all living in a crazy world and it's exhausting but listen when you're there you're the one that's plowing you're basically paddling Upstream you're you're doing your best and finally all of a sudden something happens what is it the spirit of God go look again go look again I didn't feel it don't matter if you felt it or not be expecting it I I I I I need more well then expect more Lord I need more of you in my life expect more of God I need a greater Revelation listen I we get hunkered down in our little Revelations we hold them dear for 50 years we hold on and say no I've got it no you don't you had it because God moved on you might get stuck with your Revelation but God's unfolding himself all the time all the time listen I want him to unfold himself in my life I want to I want to be the expression that God wants me to be my oh my what a promise I'll tell you what how many times we get stuck on the things that we say on our thoughts we speak our thoughts I'll just drop this in here we speak our thoughts when our thoughts are not even our thoughts you know Satan has as much right to this thing as God does God has complete right to this Satan doesn't but we speak our thoughts too many times and our thoughts are negative they're actually Satan's thoughts Satan's thoughts and we speak them and what happens it creates an atmosphere it's it's the same law God uses the same law Satan he's allowed the same thing it's his word versus God's word but I tell you what if you ever speak from here it also creates an atmosphere Lord help us keep our mouths shut if it's going to be negative let's just bite it let's just zip it you'll just shut Satan right down right there brother Duane are you listening all right oh my I'm gonna I'm just gonna have to skip a lot of this tonight I think brother Brown said he can only do as you say because he's the high priest of what you confess he's there before the presence of the Majesty to make good anything that his Redemptive blessing calls for his sacrifice that's what he paid for and standing there to make good to you anything that you say that you accepted what he has done what he has done we've found him he can only do as you say what is that he's the high priest of our confession tonight Lord help us to confess the right things listen remember remember little remember Little John Ryan the little blind man that came in the in the in the in the prayer line remember brother Brown said he he said well you told me I was healed he said you told me you believed he said I do he said then go and confess it then go and confess it but you told me I was healed listen Brothers do we believe what God says or don't we God said that by my stripes you are healed we have a sister standing right here tonight that every one of you here is a testimony that's truth you are healed he's God if we believe it then let's speak it all right all right so many times we get caught my I'm trying to just find a spot where I can just bypass a bunch of this stuff brother Brown says this now isn't it strange that people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian he said that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you must never say that no don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart listen it's not just how Devil Comes I'll tell you what he is to say he's a good adversary he's a good adversary how many times does he trip us up and we fall on our face and then he holds your nose to that and says listen there's no way a Son of God does not act like that there is no way you're a daughter of God there's no way God don't even bother asking God because he doesn't hear you that is a lie that is a Lie the Bible says that he who confesses his sin God is just and true to forgive him you know what that's such a reality to him that confesses to him that says he has no sin he is a liar well we're not listen church we realize tonight very very plainly that we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and came to this world speaking lies that's why we go that's why we have a a heavenly father that became a lamb a redeemer for us now I'll tell you what we can go when Satan comes to us we can just say go talk to him hit the power of confession the power of confessing your sins is uh we don't we don't recognize let's not sweep things under the carpet but let's confess them so God will forgive us and then when Satan goes to God God says I don't even know what you're talking about then you can boldly go Before the Throne of God and say father Lord You Know listen we don't need to be ashamed to confess our sins Church Satan wants to make you feel guilty he wants to make you feel like you're you're you're you're littler then somehow you should be greater than all no I listen the Bible and I wouldn't say the Bible says this but I got a little plaque I think it's hanging in my house it says Christians are not perfect they are forgiven that's the difference between you and I tonight we're not perfect listen we're perfect in God's eyes I'm they hear me what I'm saying in God's eyes there's not so much as even a speck of sin in your life but in this life in this flesh we realize we are not perfect but we are forgiven and that's what makes the difference that's why you can come to God and say father you know what we have need of tonight listen Jesus Christ is my savior pardon me I'm just going to go on here he's the high priest of our confession Hebrews chapter 3 and he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it what are we this Supernatural race of people what kind of confession are we to have tonight I'm not sure I'm not just talking about our natural lives I'm not just talking about about my finances and about my health and about my my marriage and about all these I'm not just talking about these things but what kind of confession ought we to have our confession ought to be absolutely no different than this word which has told us that we are the Overcomers of this age which is absolutely told us that that it's not law that we're not just a a letter on a book but that we're living Epistles that are being written and read of all men we are the sons of God Hallelujah Hebrews 10 35 so many times we get to the spot in our lives you know that we we find ourselves a doubting when God God doesn't move right away as we find ourselves doubting and and Satan begins to bombard us and and Buffet us and and maybe we've been sick and we get there and and months go by and months go by and we we say larger but you said you'd hear me but you said you'd heal me but you said yes he said you would he would heal you now thank God for healing you thank them for healing you don't just accept it don't make excuses for it well I'm just no you're not you're a Son of God and Satan is literally already under your feet we already are over top of him he actually actually has no hold on you you realize that he he can't even go before the father anymore and actually accuse you or bring his accusations he can't it's no more the blood is atoning listen the blood wasn't atoning in job's day he was under the the blood of an animal but since Jesus Christ is coming Satan can't even go and accuse you anymore God says I don't even hear you it's not there's nothing to have done nothing they're perfect before me but we listen to him we give them the time of day and and when we hear them and oh oh what's that little thing and oh oh I don't oh I'm just not I don't know there's something wrong with me no why do we confess these things that's the devil's lie and that's you accepting his lie and guess what you're gonna you're gonna just deal with it that's all you're gonna suffer with it but until the time comes where we can begin to say no by his stripes I'm Healed thank you Lord for healing me I'll tell you what let me just let me just give a little bouquet brother Ken when he was here your pastor he stood right behind this pulp and how often through that last through the valley of his last nine months or 14 months whatever it was of his life he never failed to quit confessing the fact I'll buy his stripes I'm Healed I'm absolutely you I'll tell you one thing God's desire was for God picked his little flowers bouquet and took him home he held his confession in the face of death he held on to a confession that was greater than death it was God's God could have absolutely raised him up but it was God's choice to take him home I'll tell you what I I you know what God just knows just when How great is our confession Hebrews 10 says cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God what's the will of God tonight Church to confess his word that's the will of God his word is truth it's yea it's Amen and in the face of death Hell In The Grave it don't matter what Satan throws at it to confess it is the will of God cast not therefore your confidence would which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not Tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but I like how this ends up but we are not of them who draw back to Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul what's God looking for what's God why isn't life easy for us Church we're the sons of God life should I mean listen to the prosperity preachers preaching God is so great he should be giving you everything you ever desired Everything You Ever Wanted life should be so good here at the bank your bank account should be bursting you should have your your yacht and your big jet airplane and you should be able to go on all that's how God wants to do no that's not just that's not what God's thoughts are God's going to give you all more than all that when we get to the other side but God's got a little bride on Earth right now that's being tested she's being tried she's being put to the test to see is to prove not to test to see but to prove that she's going to stay with my word she's going to stay right on my word she's not going to deviate left she's not going to deviate right her eyes are for me and for me alone what is it God is testing he's he's time testing his church this is the only element that they'll ever be in where they're time tested over there there'll never be time and he's proving to Satan that she is holding on that that she's going to stand in the face of it all she's going to stand the test of this age brother Brown says this God wants a time-tested church he said he's no he's got a Time tested church that's went through the trials through the losses through sickness through sorrow through death and still standing with a testimony that's the man yes that's the man he's looking for I don't care if you're a pauper I don't care if you're a beggar I don't care if you're a rag picker whatever you are God puts the test to you he's looking for time tested material I dare say that he he's got the material on Earth right now that he knows is going to be time tested it's going to stand the test Hallelujah Hallelujah how many times Church what's God looking for he's looking for somebody that'll just take him at his word just take him at his word not not like you know remember name in the scriptures here's a man that was full of leprosy and we know leprosy is a type of sin and and here's a man that that there was no cure for his situation but there was one young lady that had a testimony that worked for him how powerful is your testimony tonight listen this was a great man that literally stopped to give heed to the testimony of a young girl why would he do that he was he was he was in Fellowship we would say with with the Kings and with potentation and the Great Men of War he would fellowship with those people why would he stop and listen to the testimony of a young girl because your testimony is powerful he had watched her life he had seen her life he knew that she believed in a God that was great even though he didn't know this God he knew that she believed there wasn't and when she told them listen to him I know the God that I serve can deliver you from this thing he actually stopped to pay attention when's the last time you gave testimony to the grace and the glory of God when's the last time how many times God gives us opportunity and we say nothing this little girl lived her life so much in front of oh isn't this good for us isn't this good for us the people you work with the people that use rub Shore they see your life day in day out day in day out day in Day Out and they're looking for somebody that will tell them about the God that you serve they see Hypocrites and they see real here's a little little girl telling them Hey listen I know there's a God that's real I know there's a God that's real and if you'll just go hear the message that Elijah preached you'll find out that there's a reality that'll free you from this leprosy I'll tell you what name went there like every one of us did the name went there and when he got there Elijah didn't even go he didn't even step foot out to see him go tell him go dip in the Jordan seven times what you don't got enough respect for me you you you don't got enough honor for me to even come and talk to me look at our pride in our lives Church we we look at some of these scriptures we look at some of these stories and and we want to look at oh look at he was healed but look at the look at the reality of the man the man part of it he doesn't even have enough he doesn't have enough respect to come and talk to me himself forget him I don't need your kind of God I don't need your kind of message but the very thing that Elijah the very word that Elijah had given him was his Redemption was his Redemption what did Elijah tell him to do go dip in the River Jordan and Jordan means death go die go die to self ma'am if you can die to self you're going to receive what I what I promised you listen church if we can die to self name gets down there and if you know finally he's convinces him Hey listen if you would have if somebody would ask you do something great you would have done it why not just go do it yeah at least one man that had common sense around him why don't you just try God doesn't God say that listen oh I'll open up the windows of Heaven if you just try me I'll open up the windows of heaven and pour a blessing on you you can't even contain it but try me but we don't we ask little so God gives you little name needed to be made whole and there's a good lot of message people that need to be made whole they are hurting spiritually they're hurting naturally they are are that their faith is way way down here somewheres when they should be soaring in their heavenlies when they should be standing before be in the presence of God daily with a pure heart and just free to talk to him as a friend they come to him like a little child whimpering and quivering and that's not the kind of father we serve we we for we've got a daddy that loves us Nam go dip in that filthy you want me to do that listen church God asks us to do hard things sometimes he has to do hard things you say well brother Dwayne that's just simple uh uh Old Testament preaching listen I'll tell you what there was one that was willing to die to himself who paid the price for you and me and now a prophet the first age messenger comes and says I Paul Die daily I Paul Die daily come on them what aren't you willing to die to tonight that you can be made whole brother Dwayne I don't got no joy no more I don't got no peace no more I don't I don't know what's happening in my life I'm so I'm so stressed out I'm so this I'm what's the matter name what aren't you willing to die to tonight what aren't you willing to Die Why why are you stressed out why is your piece gone why is your joy gone why don't you why don't you feel the presence of God anymore why don't you know where you're at spiritually why are you wandering around when you shouldn't be them the River Jordan is still open the River Jordan is still open tonight Church listen all we got to do is be willing a willing heart to actually go down and put feet in the dirty water get down there and actually dunk ourselves get get rid of some of our pride humble ourselves to the word of God how many times does the Holy Spirit come in our lives and tapped us on the shoulder and said brother Dwayne I need you to take care he just did this to me the other day tapped me on the shoulder something I said to somebody I shouldn't have said and he tapped me on the shoulder once then he tapped me again and then he taught me again do you actually think I wanted to go to that person I'm just talking my own self you think I wanted to go talk to that person about that no I didn't let me just bring this somebody said something the other day and just bring this to light right now you know that a little white lie is just as filthy and dirty and God's sight as a dirty black lie you might as well just bold face tell a dirty rotten black lie but we don't many times we just we just kind of tell we don't tell it all or we just twist it so it doesn't look like we're quite so bad shame on you name you need to get down and dip in the River Jordan I'll tell you what the Holy Spirit tapped me on the shoulder and after you tapped me the third time I made up my mind and God God allowed me to meet that man again that brother again and I said brother I need to talk to you about something God told me three times remember the last time we had a conversation and he began to talk I said I said something I shouldn't have said and I made it right right then listen if we're willing to confess our sins he is just to forgive us what about to one another what about to one another Nam confessed he you know he dipped down the first time oh I can't believe I'm doing this some of us can't even get free in the presence of God anymore some of us can't even express ourselves in God's presence anymore some of us are so bound up and and so why why Church there's a river there's a there's a river Jordan that that we can step down into that we can humble ourselves in the presence of all listen not in the presence of a man Elijah was not even standing on the bank he wasn't looking down he wasn't doing he just gave him his word listen if you'll just do what I asked you to do God will make you completely whole I need Joy tonight I need peace well I I got such anxiety in my life listen you're a Son of God you don't need to walk with anxiety in your life that's a devil and he's already been defeated why don't you just get down in the rivers you know what your problem is you've got a voice you're listening to and it's not the voice of God there's a whole bunch of voices the day that Elijah walked up and and poured the water on his sacrifice and said God Of Heaven come down and consume this sacrifice every other voice was shut up after the sacrifice was consumed you excuse me but there was 450 prophets of Baal and another 400 prophets of of Jezebel and every one of them the Bible says Elijah gathered them all together and he literally slayed them he hacked them to Pieces why because their voice was different than God's voice and the people were confused and listen when the people are confused they don't know which way to go it's time that we get back to hearing the voice of God listen church we don't need voices voices voices let's tune our ears to the voice of God and if God is calling you to get down like Nahum and repent in the River Jordan one more time then you be man enough woman enough to say God here I am you might go down one time Lord I didn't feel anything I don't feel no different then go down again go down again go down the third time go down the fourth time go down the fifth time I'll tell you what God will honor you when Naaman finally humbled himself to Listen by the time Naaman was there the sixth time there was no more name and left he was already his pride was already hurt he was already wet he was already dirty every thought was already gone now he was just taking God at his word and the seventh time when he came back up something Supernatural happened in his life because not even the speck of leprosy not even the speck of unbelief not the speck of anything was on Naaman anymore oh Church of God we don't have to walk around defeated we don't have to walk around with unbelief we don't have to walk around hindered we are the sons of God we are not going to be sons of God we are now the sons of God Hallelujah Satan is afraid of this little church right here I'll tell you what all there is ten there might be a thousand churches in Calgary and Satan don't care about one of them but Satan fears this little church right here I'll tell you and that's the very reason he's got you on a treadmill he's got you going in circles he's got you staring at your accounts receivable you can't you know what the I go I bank at the Canadian Western Bank back in in Saskatchewan they've got this they got these pictures on the wall and I get a chuckle of them every time I'm in there because here's a here's a woman pouring her coffee in the morning and it's all over the floor and she's looking at her accounts receivable come on come on here's another guy he's standing there with an ironing board and he's frying his shirt he's looking at accounts receivable we all live in this present world you're subjected to it just like they're subjected to it uh listen you guys used to have a little restaurant what was that restaurant that we used to go to uh what's it hey no no not that one the one that's closed down 32nd Street whatever it's called I I remember going there with you all and it's changed why probably covert changed it they couldn't make it accounts receivable counts receivable pretty soon they shut the door listen Satan would love I'm not going to talk spiritually naturally right now Satan would love to see you bankrupt he would like to see you like name and so bankrupt in spirit that there's absolutely there's nothing for you to grasp you can't reach up and get a hold of the promise of God we are called by God to pull down the very strongholds of the enemy we are called by God Satan is afraid Satan is afraid of you you got the you got the same power that that I want to say this you got the same gods in the threefold purpose of that uh of Christ The Mystery of God revealed what was the last thing that God wanted that he would have preeminence in a broad body preeminence do you know what that means that means that God himself if he says go left you go left because you don't know anything else if he says you go right you're going right you don't know anything else if he said Step Into the Fire you just stepped right into the fire he's got preeminence in your life listen daddy mommy Grandpa Grandma we are the devil's worst nightmare and if we're not it's our fault because when Jesus Christ stood on the earth the devils in hell were petrified of him and I'll say this he was the firstborn then here we go to the 20th century and here comes the prophet of God the wave Chief being waved across here comes another Son of God being waved across and the Very devils in hell were afraid of him how much more are those same devils and hell just as much afraid of you and me this evening absolutely you are Satan's worst nightmare because what he speaks you override when he brings in fear you speed away listen we're not we're not subject to fear we're not we're not to be bound by fear we're sons of God we're living in a different atmosphere different realm where the peace of God passes all understanding the spirit of God has preeminence in our bodies brother Barry come on up I'll just forget the rest of the notes tonight I think we're just at a good place it's a good listen we are the sons of God we can sing that little song says greater is he that's in me than he that's in this world let's not be so proud let's let's not be so arrogant that we are that we're that we're ashamed we're ashamed to to Humble ourselves in the River Jordan on a daily basis you've got something that you need to clean up go clean it up don't don't just don't just come to church and and sit there spiritually dry and dead and wonder where is that love of God and where's where's the spirit of God in my life and where oh God I know you're there but where where's the god like he used to be isn't that where we find ours we find ourselves in those positions I want the god that used to be no no I want that God present tonight I don't want to go back there I just want the same God present tonight and I believe he is I believe he is because you brought him here literally brought him with you when you came this church does not this building does not house God but that building and that building and that building is the housing of God ye are the Tabernacle of the Living God I believe that tonight I believe that Satan is just as fearful of the children of God knowing their position knowing what they truly are is just as fearful tonight as he was when Jesus stood there that day and said to Legion Satan come out of him same God veiled in a different Veil same God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm so thankful to be part of the of the economy of God aren't you glad you're not what you used to be aren't you glad that Jesus Christ has made you whole listen we don't we don't have to we don't have to live with partial understanding even do you realize that tonight Church we don't have to live with partial understanding God has come in this age the Elijah minister of this age has come to do what to tear down all the altars of Baal to show them for what they are false prophets Antichrist spirit and to raise back up the standard of God bring the word of God back to its rightful position that the children of God will say that's the god that we'll serve amen greater is he that's in me than he that's in this world brother Barry come on up greater is he that is in me [Music] thank you many Souls [Music] what God has promised us today overcoming power that [Music] was in the world on the day of Pentecost a mighty rushing wind it blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power greater than any Earthly that is in me Chrissy that is in the world hallelujah how many enjoyed that tonight I just want to say this for those people local I don't know how many people picked it up but you probably think that brother Dwayne and I have had a lot of conversations about what we've been preaching about but we haven't had one conversation about what we've been preaching about I'm so thankful that it's the same Spirit preaching the same word that is it does something to me makes me so thankful to show that I'm surrendered unto the unto the Lord being feeling like a junior Minister here and uh just yeah certainly thankful what a mighty God we serve you know we're we're about 20 minutes after nine o'clock on a Wednesday night end of June school is out I trust it is for everyone I I don't
