[1:02:29] for 5
[1:02:31] years and I realized that it is it was
[1:02:34] not my calling because I don't have
[1:02:37] patience and Temperance to
[1:02:39] be so
[1:02:42] I just respect the person who would take
[1:02:45] those
[1:02:47] responsibility and also the associate
[1:02:49] ministers who is backing him up and make
[1:02:53] the church go and continue the journey
[1:02:57] till Jesus
[1:02:58] come and thank you very much for
[1:03:01] welcoming us I just feel welcoming
[1:03:04] spirit and just feel at EAS and so
[1:03:07] welcome it's been a long while
[1:03:10] Hallelujah brother Ken I miss him so he
[1:03:13] was the first uh invited us in
[1:03:17] 2016 and I've been here two times
[1:03:19] already and also meet brother mvin
[1:03:23] during that time tremendous Str brother
[1:03:27] family
[1:03:28] brother their
[1:03:32] Hospitality are more just physical we
[1:03:36] have just more physical relationship
[1:03:38] it's more than that amen and we know our
[1:03:41] real brother and sister those who love
[1:03:43] the Lord Jesus Christ even they ask the
[1:03:46] Lord Jesus Christ who is my mother who
[1:03:47] is my brother the one who loves me they
[1:03:50] mother brother we are the real brothers
[1:03:52] and sisters so thank you so much and I
[1:03:55] bring greetings from brother
[1:03:58] Ron and to those who know him he send
[1:04:02] that send our greetings and love to them
[1:04:04] so God bless you all I cannot mention
[1:04:06] the names uh as my hair grow uh turn
[1:04:11] white I become you know always not
[1:04:15] upgraded so so I will borrow the the
[1:04:20] words of brother bam and just take me
[1:04:23] for what I mean and not for what I say
[1:04:26] amen because as our hair turn white
[1:04:29] sometimes our thought is different than
[1:04:30] what we say so just forgive me for that
[1:04:35] amen so we bring greetings also from uh
[1:04:38] some of the brothers who knows here and
[1:04:41] they spend their greetings and we
[1:04:45] were just
[1:04:47] uh surprised then when we leave Phoenix
[1:04:51] it's
[1:04:52] 114° and when we came with 40 or
[1:04:56] something like that I thought it was
[1:04:59] summer but it's still
[1:05:01] winter oh praise the Lord at least we
[1:05:04] enjoy we still enjoy the
[1:05:07] winter amen so praise the Lord so the
[1:05:11] most important things we will go to the
[1:05:12] word of God I'm not really good in uh
[1:05:15] preliminaries so we'll just go directly
[1:05:18] to the word of God uh can I invite you
[1:05:20] to stand and I have two portion of
[1:05:24] scripture uh the Deuteronomy chapter 25
[1:05:28] thank you musicians God bless
[1:05:33] you Deuteronomy 25 verse 5-6 then 1
[1:05:39] Corinthians 15 verse 21 to
[1:05:44] 22 are you glad to be a Christian this
[1:05:46] morning am amen so brother brandham said
[1:05:50] that to be a Christian it was not your
[1:05:53] desire to be a Christian it was God's
[1:05:56] desire for you to be a
[1:05:58] Christian because he said no one can
[1:06:00] comes to me except the father draws him
[1:06:03] near so and then brother Braham said
[1:06:06] that God put in your heart to be hunger
[1:06:10] and thirst it's your heavenly father
[1:06:12] trying to reveal to you something amen
[1:06:16] so praise the
[1:06:18] Lord Deuteronomy CH 25:
[1:06:22] 5-6 says that if Brethren dwell together
[1:06:26] and one of them die and have no
[1:06:30] child the wife of the Dead shall not
[1:06:32] marry without unto a stranger her
[1:06:36] husband's brother shall go in unto her
[1:06:38] and take her to him to wife and perform
[1:06:42] the duty of a husband's brother unto her
[1:06:46] and it shall be that the first born
[1:06:49] which she Barett shall succeed in the
[1:06:51] name of his brother which is dead that
[1:06:55] his name be not put out of Israel so if
[1:07:00] the first husband of the woman dies then
[1:07:03] the nearest Kinsman of her husband is to
[1:07:05] bring resurrection of the name and
[1:07:08] family of his Dead Brother by
[1:07:11] marriage and by seed because marriage
[1:07:13] and seed is what brings forth a family
[1:07:17] men and a race of people and a
[1:07:20] nation so 1 Corinthians 15 verse 21-22
[1:07:26] for since by men Came Death by men
[1:07:30] also came the resurrection of the
[1:07:34] Dead for as in Adam all dying even so in
[1:07:38] Christ shall all be made alive amen
[1:07:42] let's borrow once again Heavenly Father
[1:07:44] we thank you Lord God this morning that
[1:07:46] you give us the privilege to gather
[1:07:48] together to Worship You Lord and uh we
[1:07:51] ask you Lord special blessings to the
[1:07:53] word that we read Lord you can read it
[1:07:56] and turn the pages but it take your Holy
[1:07:59] Spirit Lord to reveal something over
[1:08:01] this word Lord so we ask you to come
[1:08:03] Lord speak to us in Jesus Christ's name
[1:08:06] amen so you may be
[1:08:08] seated so my title this morning is
[1:08:11] resurrection by Union and by seed amen
[1:08:16] and we know that seeds are very powerful
[1:08:19] thing they come in many different forms
[1:08:22] and without seed there is no
[1:08:24] continuation of
[1:08:26] Life sin is what continues life and
[1:08:30] resurrects life because when a man when
[1:08:33] a plant dies it has a resurrection by
[1:08:36] the seed that is in itself because there
[1:08:39] is always a power of transformation
[1:08:42] within the seed as the word of God said
[1:08:45] let every seed bring forth of its kind
[1:08:48] amen so there's power of
[1:08:50] transformation within the seed so
[1:08:54] anything that is not living by the word
[1:08:57] is not truly living because life can
[1:08:59] only exist by the word of God Amen so
[1:09:03] just like uh Timothy he said that in
[1:09:05] Timothy 56 he said but she that liveth
[1:09:09] in pleasure is dead while he is
[1:09:13] living amen so without the seed of God
[1:09:16] even though you are
[1:09:18] alive in the sight of God you are just
[1:09:21] dead
[1:09:23] amen so
[1:09:25] because the word of God they are spirit
[1:09:28] and they are Life John 63 said it is the
[1:09:30] spirit that Quicken it but the flesh
[1:09:32] profet
[1:09:34] nothing but the word that I speak unto
[1:09:36] you they are spirit and they are life so
[1:09:39] without the word of God we cannot live
[1:09:41] good life amen may we may live in
[1:09:44] pleasure but in the sight of God we are
[1:09:46] already dead it only takes the word of
[1:09:49] God because in Genesis 1:1 and God said
[1:09:53] let the Earth bring forth of its kind
[1:09:56] the grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:09:58] fruit yielding fruit after his kind
[1:10:01] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[1:10:04] and it was so so the seed is a light
[1:10:08] carrier and without seed there is no
[1:10:10] life and no Resurrection what a very
[1:10:13] important thing that we need to
[1:10:15] recognize about the seed of God because
[1:10:17] even brother Bram made mention in the
[1:10:20] message super sign he said that he said
[1:10:22] that denominational churches are just
[1:10:25] just sitting on Buns of Breen
[1:10:27] eggs because they have refused to unite
[1:10:30] with Christ right and receive the word
[1:10:33] of SE this hour that God sent through
[1:10:35] this channel of the seventh angel super
[1:10:38] sign paragraph 36 that's the way with
[1:10:41] our organized
[1:10:43] religion until they come in contact with
[1:10:46] the mate Christ Jesus there a bunch of
[1:10:48] BR and eggs
[1:10:51] right the whole thing need to be thr out
[1:10:55] of the nest they'll never hat the best
[1:10:57] thing to do is clean out the nest start
[1:11:00] all over again get the maid Christ Jesus
[1:11:04] so an egg without the
[1:11:06] mate cannot be fertilized cannot hatch
[1:11:09] so they need a mate in order to H or be
[1:11:14] fertilize so before there can have a
[1:11:17] resurrection of New Life there must be a
[1:11:19] first a union and Seed
[1:11:22] combination amen so Resurrection
[1:11:25] is not just an event Resurrection is a
[1:11:29] person in John 11 verse
[1:11:34] 21 it's speaking about Martha about
[1:11:37] Lazarus when Lazarus died and
[1:11:41] Martha uh heard that Jesus was coming so
[1:11:46] he approached Jesus Christ immediately
[1:11:48] because she heard that Jesus was coming
[1:11:51] so in verse 11 then said
[1:11:54] Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast
[1:11:57] been here my brother had not died sounds
[1:12:01] like he's blaming Jesus Christ
[1:12:04] indirectly for the death of his brother
[1:12:07] because she believed that if he
[1:12:11] come his brother could live so
[1:12:14] indirectly it sounds like he was blaming
[1:12:17] Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ then said Martha Jesus Lord if
[1:12:21] thou Hast been here my brother had not
[1:12:24] died
[1:12:26] but in verse 22 but I
[1:12:29] know that even
[1:12:32] now whatsoever thou will ask of God God
[1:12:35] will give it unto thee she believeth she
[1:12:38] have faith in Jesus Christ although he
[1:12:42] didn't come when she was called but now
[1:12:46] that he was in the present tense she
[1:12:50] believed that whatever he said will come
[1:12:53] to pass
[1:12:57] then Jesus said thy brother shall arise
[1:13:00] again amen what a great
[1:13:02] consolation but he misinterpreted
[1:13:05] because looking at the resurrection as
[1:13:08] an event he said Jesus and Jesus said un
[1:13:12] thy brother shall rise again then Martha
[1:13:14] said unto him I
[1:13:17] know that he shall rise again in the
[1:13:20] resurrection at the last day so he was
[1:13:23] looking at an event of Resurrection at
[1:13:26] the last days but Jesus said unto her I
[1:13:30] am the resurrection and the life he that
[1:13:33] believeth in
[1:13:35] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:13:39] so Resurrection is not only an event but
[1:13:42] Resurrection is a person of Jesus Christ
[1:13:46] you cannot be there in the event of the
[1:13:48] Resurrection until you know the person
[1:13:51] of the Resurrection so to be in the
[1:13:54] resurrection you need to know the person
[1:13:56] of the Resurrection Hallelujah because
[1:13:59] the resurrection is the present tense he
[1:14:02] was always in the present tense we need
[1:14:04] to know the resurrection amen now that
[1:14:07] we spiritually speaking we are already
[1:14:12] resurrected because he said and the and
[1:14:16] I am the res resurrection of the life he
[1:14:19] that believeth in me yes though he were
[1:14:23] dead yet shall he live
[1:14:26] do you believe do you believe the Lord
[1:14:27] Jesus CHR is here amen we can never be
[1:14:30] here together without the grace of God
[1:14:32] in our lives so we are the testimony of
[1:14:35] his
[1:14:36] resurrection amen it was not an event
[1:14:39] but it was the resurrection of Jesus
[1:14:41] Christ we are born into a new life so
[1:14:44] our life now is a testimony that his
[1:14:47] word is the
[1:14:48] truth amen Christ is the word and he's
[1:14:51] the only one that can carish the
[1:14:53] Original Seed of the original life he is
[1:14:56] the life Bearer so in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:59] death come by Adam raised by a false
[1:15:03] Union and hybrid
[1:15:05] seed do you believe it that came by
[1:15:08] hybriding the seed of the word of God so
[1:15:11] therefore Resurrection can only return
[1:15:13] to Adam Race by a true Union with Christ
[1:15:17] and by receiving the Original Seed of
[1:15:20] the original life again amen it takes
[1:15:24] the original word amen to resurrect us
[1:15:27] again
[1:15:28] amen oh what a blessed
[1:15:32] name amen amen amen So Adam
[1:15:37] lost fellowship with God Amen when they
[1:15:41] received the hybrid seed they lost
[1:15:45] Fellowship amen they lost eternal
[1:15:49] life praise be to God
[1:15:55] but God is restoring us what Adam
[1:15:59] lost amen during the
[1:16:03] time just God just came down in the cool
[1:16:06] of the day and have fellowship with
[1:16:09] Adam every time God open his word to
[1:16:13] Adam Adam just say Amen Lord another
[1:16:17] word open amen Lord another word open
[1:16:20] amen Lord he don't misinterpret the word
[1:16:24] he don't mislocate the word and he need
[1:16:27] he didn't need to Mis interpret the word
[1:16:31] of God he just say Amen to every word of
[1:16:33] God Amen Hallelujah he don't reason it
[1:16:36] out praise God he just believe it and as
[1:16:40] a real believer of the word of God we
[1:16:42] just say Amen to every word of God if we
[1:16:44] cannot understand we just pray to God
[1:16:46] lord open my high understanding Lord
[1:16:49] hallelujah don't let me interpret your
[1:16:51] word don't let me reason out your word
[1:16:54] praise God I just believe it Lord yes
[1:16:57] amen just open my eyes of understanding
[1:17:02] amen and every
[1:17:09] time the evening evening
[1:17:13] comes he was already waiting for God 30
[1:17:16] minutes before yeah the service come
[1:17:20] amen he was already always on time right
[1:17:24] he was is always hungering for
[1:17:27] Fellowship amen amen if that fa spirit
[1:17:30] before the PO came is here it will be
[1:17:34] the same effect we'll be in the church
[1:17:36] for 30 minutes and we don't want to be
[1:17:39] late because we want Fellowship amen
[1:17:45] hallelujah
[1:17:49] hallelujah we want to have fellowship
[1:17:51] with God hallelujah so we just humble
[1:17:54] our that's why God put a hunger and
[1:17:56] thirst in our heart because he wants to
[1:17:58] reveal to you something the hidden
[1:18:00] Mystery before the foundation of the
[1:18:02] word he wants to try to reveal it to
[1:18:04] each and every one of us he lost
[1:18:07] Fellowship he lost eternal life praise
[1:18:10] God during that time before the fall he
[1:18:13] has no problem he has no hurache he has
[1:18:15] no trouble he has no jealousy so
[1:18:18] everything he just go to day he just
[1:18:19] enjoy
[1:18:22] it and God is trying to restore us back
[1:18:25] to that
[1:18:26] condition he has fellowship with all the
[1:18:29] animals he has control amen he can just
[1:18:32] say to the to to whatever let lion let
[1:18:35] us pray
[1:18:37] elephant he can command every has
[1:18:39] Dominion all over the
[1:18:42] Earth we can see even in our present day
[1:18:45] we can see a lot of uh uh short video
[1:18:50] clip how people train a small animals
[1:18:54] even the the Tiger The Lion then the
[1:18:57] lion grows up and they can still play
[1:19:00] it's just a glimpse of the Millennium
[1:19:02] during the time amen although we are in
[1:19:05] the Fallen state but still the word of
[1:19:07] God has commissioned that you have
[1:19:09] dominion you have rule over all the
[1:19:11] Earth and I believe God is is beginning
[1:19:15] to restore us back to that amen so
[1:19:18] that's why sometimes some of us we love
[1:19:22] pets because there is always a
[1:19:24] connection
[1:19:25] right some likes do some likes cat some
[1:19:28] likes crocodile whatever you can see it
[1:19:31] all in a short video clip when you open
[1:19:33] the vide some have pons for their pet
[1:19:36] some spiders
[1:19:38] whatsoever because it was already a
[1:19:41] spirit that gave us a
[1:19:43] dominion and one of days in the
[1:19:45] Millennium you can read in Isaiah 11
[1:19:48] that even the lamp are playing with the
[1:19:51] lion but
[1:19:53] now it not happen but there will it will
[1:19:57] be happening
[1:19:59] soon so let us go back to our uh
[1:20:02] scripture
[1:20:04] reading if the first husband of woman
[1:20:06] dies then the newest
[1:20:08] kmas is to bring a resurrection of the
[1:20:11] name of the family of his dead
[1:20:17] brother let
[1:20:23] me just help me in the Pulpit
[1:20:26] amen I'm a little bit
[1:20:29] nervous
[1:20:30] hallelujah thank you
[1:20:33] Lord being in the Pulpit is so
[1:20:37] sacred and it is not just a one way amen
[1:20:43] right uh a minister is just like a just
[1:20:46] like a a speaker it's a it's a two-way
[1:20:50] that's right right you need to help the
[1:20:54] minister
[1:20:55] amen that's as a minister we are just
[1:20:58] like a waiter that's right if you order
[1:21:03] we will
[1:21:04] serve but if you will not order there we
[1:21:07] just
[1:21:10] wait that's sometimes uh it's keeping
[1:21:14] our torque
[1:21:15] dry so we need to you need to order so
[1:21:19] that I can deliver
[1:21:25] amen so it's not a one way it's a two
[1:21:29] way uh just uh when I read the scripture
[1:21:34] if I I'm stammering my lip just nud your
[1:21:36] head it will help me right don't look at
[1:21:41] me as if I'm a stranger because I become
[1:21:45] nervous yeah help me just n your head
[1:21:48] and smile a little bit it will be
[1:21:51] okay amen cuz I remember the that uh
[1:21:57] Angels
[1:21:59] um they don't really Rejoice just like
[1:22:03] uh with us being Sinners saved by grace
[1:22:08] yeah that's right we can appreciate the
[1:22:09] grace of God in our
[1:22:11] lives amen so even our nodding of our
[1:22:14] head and saying amen could not give
[1:22:16] Justice to what God has given us by his
[1:22:19] grace that come into our life we are
[1:22:21] nothing so the grace of God Is A Mir UNM
[1:22:25] merited favor best upon so even though
[1:22:29] we say n amen it will not give Justice
[1:22:32] right amen hallelujah so
[1:22:35] Angels don't really cannot relate to
[1:22:39] what we
[1:22:40] experience being a sinner saved by grace
[1:22:44] so we need to practice it amen we are
[1:22:47] not forcing you to say Amen but we are
[1:22:51] encouraging you to say
[1:22:53] amen amen
[1:22:56] right because being grateful Hallelujah
[1:22:59] God will always dwells in the Praises of
[1:23:02] his
[1:23:04] people Angels don't know how to praise
[1:23:08] or or or cannot relate to what that's
[1:23:12] right we receive being a senior Sav by
[1:23:15] Grace because they were sent as a
[1:23:18] messenger sent as a
[1:23:21] protector so every time you worship they
[1:23:24] are just sitting and looking at you what
[1:23:26] are they saying what are they
[1:23:30] rejoicing but sometimes if we don't know
[1:23:33] how to worship God to praise him we look
[1:23:36] like
[1:23:39] Angels amen so we need to say Amen we
[1:23:44] need to practice it we are in the house
[1:23:46] of God I we are not somewhere else or
[1:23:50] you don't need to asham to worship God
[1:23:52] to clap him and to praise him because
[1:23:55] that is our only only obligation is to
[1:23:58] give back our Praises unto him don't be
[1:24:01] ashamed to say amen and be asham to
[1:24:05] smile amen thank you for your smile
[1:24:08] you're are a beautiful
[1:24:10] smile amen so let us uh back to Exodus
[1:24:15] 32:10 now therefore let me alone that my
[1:24:18] rod may walk hot against them that I may
[1:24:22] consume them and I will make of the a
[1:24:25] great nation God in this Ro is going to
[1:24:28] wipe out the Jewish race and resurrect
[1:24:31] the race against Moses seed a
[1:24:34] resurrection by seed and this is the
[1:24:36] principle of the
[1:24:40] Bible now Adam was like the first
[1:24:43] husband that died that brought a
[1:24:45] separation
[1:24:47] amen and death to his entire human race
[1:24:51] Offspring but then Christ the second
[1:24:53] Adam
[1:24:55] amen by Redemption brought a
[1:24:57] resurrection to Adam's Fallen race again
[1:25:00] by Redemption and by Union and by seed
[1:25:05] so we can see the pattern type
[1:25:06] throughout the entire stories of the
[1:25:08] Bible if there is a pattern we cannot
[1:25:11] change all the pattern because God is
[1:25:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:15] amen he leave us a pattern that if we
[1:25:17] can see all the pattern God is doing the
[1:25:20] same we may have different ages
[1:25:22] different time different day but the
[1:25:24] pattern of how he moves is still the
[1:25:27] same so we have the Assurance if we can
[1:25:30] see it in the scripture we have the
[1:25:32] assurance that God is in his
[1:25:36] word in the book of Bruth the in in Lim
[1:25:39] when he died boas brings a resurrection
[1:25:43] and Restorations to the family and
[1:25:45] lineage of imik by uniting with Ruth
[1:25:49] praise God in marriage Union and by
[1:25:51] giving her sin
[1:25:55] just like in 1st Samuel 29 we see that
[1:25:57] nabal Abigail's first husband died and
[1:26:00] when he was United in marriage with
[1:26:02] David during the time of his Exile
[1:26:04] before he was King over Israel Abigail
[1:26:07] had two son the first son was called KB
[1:26:10] which means like his father just like
[1:26:14] Tamar reive seed after his husband died
[1:26:16] amen we know that Tamer praise God
[1:26:19] married the first son of Judah and that
[1:26:21] died and he promised to give s but they
[1:26:25] don't give seed to to
[1:26:28] Tamer because Judah thought that
[1:26:34] maybe T was a
[1:26:37] everything dies when have contact
[1:26:40] with him so he didn't give his younger
[1:26:44] son but Tamer the only thing that God
[1:26:48] will bless him he need to have a seat
[1:26:50] that's right
[1:26:53] so he he changed his garment her garment
[1:26:57] to a garment just like a harlot that's
[1:27:01] where he get the seed from Judah and
[1:27:03] Judah said K was more righteous than him
[1:27:07] because he was trying to hide it amen
[1:27:09] through the seed so all the stories in
[1:27:12] the Bible are revealing something to us
[1:27:14] about this Great Harvest Time and
[1:27:17] Resurrection time that we are now living
[1:27:19] because the marriage of the Lamb to his
[1:27:21] bride is now come Revelation 19:6 Thou
[1:27:26] come not coming but already come in fact
[1:27:29] it was already marriaged because the
[1:27:31] bride the wife had made herself ready so
[1:27:34] she was not a bride but she was already
[1:27:37] a wife the wife is already making
[1:27:40] herself ready are you ready tonight
[1:27:42] morning
[1:27:44] Hallelujah so we know that Christ the
[1:27:47] second Adam has bring about a
[1:27:49] resurrection of this hour of the Bride
[1:27:52] of seven Church ages because of but
[1:27:54] people in this day that have come into a
[1:27:57] union with him and that have received
[1:27:59] the fullness of the seed of his original
[1:28:01] word
[1:28:03] again so how does the resurrection take
[1:28:06] place in this hour by marriage Union and
[1:28:09] by the Original Seed of the word of God
[1:28:12] being restored to us in its fullness the
[1:28:15] word of God is being restored to us in
[1:28:17] this last days amen amen it is the life
[1:28:21] and the voice of the seed of the
[1:28:23] revealed word that is calling our names
[1:28:26] in this hour that is what will produce
[1:28:29] resurrection of this hour our name is
[1:28:32] being called by the revealing of the
[1:28:34] mystery that was sent in our day that's
[1:28:37] how God called our name in the L of life
[1:28:39] amen by the mystery that is being
[1:28:42] revealed in these last days so the full
[1:28:44] word is being restored as back back
[1:28:47] again amen we are not only Justified we
[1:28:49] are Sanctified we are baptized with the
[1:28:51] Holy Ghost now it's the person of Jesus
[1:28:53] Christ
[1:28:54] himself that's why when you receive the
[1:28:56] Holy Ghost you become God's
[1:29:00] coworker Hallelujah you are not just a
[1:29:03] worker right if you are just a worker
[1:29:05] you have a boss right but you don't have
[1:29:08] a boss you are a coworker of God Amen
[1:29:12] because it was God working through you
[1:29:15] you become his mouthpiece you become his
[1:29:17] eyes you become his feet praise God God
[1:29:20] is continually using each and every
[1:29:23] member of his body to be his coworker in
[1:29:26] this last days each and every one of us
[1:29:29] has a Ministry amen not only the people
[1:29:32] person in the Pulpit but even in your
[1:29:34] home in your offices in your school we
[1:29:37] have a Ministry of our
[1:29:40] own because thou must prophesy
[1:29:43] again we are not commanded to evangelize
[1:29:47] again we are commanded to prophesy
[1:29:51] again and to prophesy means you you need
[1:29:54] to share hallelujah what was amen what
[1:29:59] is and what is to
[1:30:01] come God don't know about the original
[1:30:04] sin but we need a minist a a prophetic
[1:30:08] Ministry to tell them what was happening
[1:30:11] in the beginning what he was doing today
[1:30:14] and what he will going tomorrow
[1:30:18] hallelujah praise the Lord so let us go
[1:30:21] back in the Book of Ruth chapter 4 vers
[1:30:24] verse 2 and
[1:30:26] 5 and he took 10 men of the Elders of
[1:30:30] the city and said sit down here and they
[1:30:32] sat down so the setting of Ruth chapter
[1:30:36] 2 is just like the setting of Revelation
[1:30:39] chapter 5 one sitting in the throne with
[1:30:43] all the elders beside
[1:30:45] him and he said unto the Kingman Nomi
[1:30:48] that is come uh come again out of the
[1:30:52] country of Moab said that a parcel of
[1:30:54] land which was our brother's
[1:30:57] IMX and I thought to advertise this
[1:31:00] saying buy it before the inhabitants and
[1:31:02] before the Elders of the people if thou
[1:31:05] wi redeem it redeem
[1:31:08] it but if thou will not redeem it then
[1:31:11] tell me that I may know for there is
[1:31:13] none to redeem it beside thee and I am
[1:31:17] after thee and he said I will redeem
[1:31:22] it so so it was going to cause him to
[1:31:25] rain back eliminate
[1:31:27] lost and that was going to spoil his own
[1:31:29] wealth because the son of Bruth would go
[1:31:32] on to inherit it for amik El's family's
[1:31:37] name then said boas what day thou buyest
[1:31:41] the field of the hand of Nomi thou must
[1:31:44] buy it also of Ruth the moabites and the
[1:31:47] wife of the Dead to raise up the name of
[1:31:50] the Dead upon his
[1:31:52] inheritance and we know that boas was a
[1:31:54] type of Christ who was prepared to have
[1:31:57] his own inheritance marred in order to
[1:31:59] bring a resurrection to Adam's race and
[1:32:03] the kingsman said I cannot redeem it for
[1:32:06] myself l i Mar my own inheritance redeem
[1:32:10] thou my right to thyself for I cannot
[1:32:13] redeem
[1:32:14] it so so Satan sometimes trying to to
[1:32:18] own us but he will not redeem
[1:32:22] us right amen he will just leave us in
[1:32:26] limbo he cannot continue on if be given
[1:32:28] a chance to give the Redemption he will
[1:32:31] not redeem it he will just temp us he
[1:32:34] will give us trial and testing all of
[1:32:36] that but he will not save
[1:32:40] us that's right and
[1:32:44] Satan was given permission to Temp
[1:32:47] that's right just like when the Lord
[1:32:49] Jesus Christ was baptized by John the
[1:32:52] Baptist in georia
[1:32:55] River and there was a light coming
[1:32:58] down just like adab and the boy said
[1:33:01] this is my beloved
[1:33:04] Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell
[1:33:08] there was an
[1:33:09] identification so Satan immediately
[1:33:12] knows who Jesus was right that's why he
[1:33:17] went and temp him if thou be the Son of
[1:33:21] God because he already
[1:33:24] heard the voice this is my beloved Son
[1:33:26] in whom I'm dwell please Satan will not
[1:33:29] tempt you if you are not Sons and
[1:33:31] Daughters of God he knows you are Sons
[1:33:33] and Daughters of God that's why he than
[1:33:35] you if thou be the Son of God turn this
[1:33:37] water into turn this turn this if thou
[1:33:40] be the Son of God if thou be the son so
[1:33:42] every trial that comes your way Satan
[1:33:44] knows that you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:33:46] God you will not give in so that's why
[1:33:48] if thou be the Son of God command this
[1:33:51] Stone to turn into bread
[1:33:54] amen he didn't
[1:33:58] say he didn't just say turn this Stone
[1:34:02] into bread he
[1:34:05] command because he knows he's talking to
[1:34:08] a commander in you
[1:34:11] right he command the stone turn into
[1:34:16] bread he knows that Jesus Christ was the
[1:34:19] bread of
[1:34:20] life amen so Satan knows each and every
[1:34:24] one of us that's why when Temptations
[1:34:27] and Trials Come amen God and Satan is
[1:34:31] behind it yes it's included in our
[1:34:35] package remember that Jesus Christ he
[1:34:37] said that I am the Alpha and the Omega I
[1:34:40] am the beginning and I am the ending
[1:34:43] whatever he start he will finish it at
[1:34:46] the End Amen so in
[1:34:49] between there is always a blank right
[1:34:53] whatever Tri you're in let us fill in
[1:34:56] the
[1:34:56] blank but at the end he's already done
[1:35:00] it amen he already overcome
[1:35:07] it so to be part in the First rection in
[1:35:10] this day that we are living in you must
[1:35:12] first come into Union with Christ and
[1:35:15] receive the word of the revelation of
[1:35:18] the original word of God in our day amen
[1:35:22] you cannot be in the Resurrection unless
[1:35:24] you receive the seed of the the word of
[1:35:28] God just like in the uh the scripture
[1:35:31] Mark
[1:35:33] 4:3 heren behold there went out a s to
[1:35:38] sa and we know that a s s seed in the
[1:35:41] field and we know that the field is the
[1:35:43] woman and that's why it takes a man and
[1:35:45] a woman to bring forth a new body
[1:35:47] because a man has seed and a woman has a
[1:35:49] field
[1:35:56] and so these two combines together is
[1:35:58] what produces the new body
[1:36:01] amen and that is why in this age for us
[1:36:04] to change from Mortal to immortality and
[1:36:07] to put on a new body we need these two
[1:36:10] things to come together again an
[1:36:11] original seed and a field and we are the
[1:36:15] field of the word of
[1:36:17] God in each say they had a portion of
[1:36:20] Original Seed but in the last day it
[1:36:22] must be the entire seed that comes
[1:36:25] together again in Union with the people
[1:36:27] at church in order to produce the
[1:36:29] literal resurrection of 2,000 years of
[1:36:33] sleeping Saints in this
[1:36:36] hour they need us to be completed amen
[1:36:40] so without us they can never be
[1:36:42] resurrected they are waiting for us and
[1:36:44] they are looking for us amen and maybe
[1:36:47] they are just like the o just go on
[1:36:49] brother go on Amen keep moving on
[1:36:52] brother whatever PR you are in is not
[1:36:55] compared to us we we we sacrifice Our
[1:36:58] Lives to a lion being eaten by a lion
[1:37:00] being swn as Su Hallelujah we don't
[1:37:03] experience that kind of Trials but our
[1:37:06] greatest battle is in our mind amen we
[1:37:09] need to move on as Paul said let us run
[1:37:13] the
[1:37:14] race amen because as we run he is
[1:37:17] running with us into the Finish Line he
[1:37:19] will never leave us nor forsake us
[1:37:22] whatever trials your are in he with he
[1:37:25] is behind
[1:37:29] it so praise God it takes the
[1:37:31] resurrection it takes a seed right to be
[1:37:34] in the resurrection in Genesis 4:25 it
[1:37:37] says and Adam knew his wife again and
[1:37:41] she bear a
[1:37:42] son and called his name Seth for God
[1:37:46] said she had appointed me another seed
[1:37:48] instead of Abel whom Cain slew Seth was
[1:37:52] a type of Christ Resurrection amen so in
[1:37:55] the message infallible proof of
[1:37:57] Resurrection paragraph
[1:38:00] 25 and brother Bram said then when he
[1:38:04] slew Abel he thought he got it right y
[1:38:09] because he destroyed the only righteous
[1:38:11] part of the
[1:38:13] SE then God raised up set to take his
[1:38:16] place a beautiful type of death of
[1:38:18] Christ and the resurrection of Christ so
[1:38:22] Isaac was also one received from the
[1:38:24] dead because he came by the Seed of
[1:38:27] Abraham and notice in the beginning
[1:38:30] death came by a false Union of a wrong
[1:38:33] seed that was received into the womb of
[1:38:35] a woman the first Eve so therefore life
[1:38:38] can only come back again by the right
[1:38:41] Union and the right seed of the original
[1:38:44] word of God back in the womb of a woman
[1:38:47] again so if the false Union and false
[1:38:51] took us out of Eden then it must take a
[1:38:54] union with Christ in this hour that the
[1:38:57] pregnation of the Original Seed again to
[1:39:00] put us back in Eden again Hallelujah and
[1:39:04] that is what the promise of this age and
[1:39:06] that is what is going on right now under
[1:39:09] the seven seal mystery of God is
[1:39:11] restoring us back the Original Seed of
[1:39:14] God so the entire Bible is the story of
[1:39:20] redemption amen and in our opening
[1:39:22] script reading we see that the Lord that
[1:39:25] if the first husband died and that was a
[1:39:28] type of Adam then there is to be a
[1:39:31] marriage to the nearest brother nearest
[1:39:34] Kinsman and who is in our Cas was Christ
[1:39:38] the second Adam and by his
[1:39:41] seed the seed of his revelation of the
[1:39:44] word he brings life and restoration back
[1:39:47] again
[1:39:50] Hallelujah in the message there's only
[1:39:52] one way Pro provided by God for anything
[1:39:55] and that is by the revelations of God so
[1:39:58] every sermon of brother bam is just not
[1:40:01] only a title a good title for his sermon
[1:40:05] but every title of the Prophet is a
[1:40:10] declaration amen because as a priest we
[1:40:13] are called priest and King a priest
[1:40:16] always represent the people to God yes
[1:40:20] while a prophet represent God to his
[1:40:22] people
[1:40:23] so every sermon titled sermon is a
[1:40:27] declaration just like when he say he is
[1:40:29] here there is a man that can turn on the
[1:40:32] light amen the almighty God unveil
[1:40:34] before us amen that is all a
[1:40:38] declaration not only a titled sermon but
[1:40:40] it was a declaration because the prophet
[1:40:43] represent God to the people amen so this
[1:40:46] is there is only one way provided by God
[1:40:50] for
[1:40:51] anything paragraph 6 7 he said and God
[1:40:55] promised the church a scriptural sign
[1:40:59] and he said the resurrection would be
[1:41:01] reproduced amen Jesus Christ and his
[1:41:04] church would become so they would be
[1:41:10] one take notice that God promised this
[1:41:14] church C Small
[1:41:17] seed a scriptural signed but he said and
[1:41:21] the resurrection would be reproduced
[1:41:22] Jesus Christ and his Capital C church so
[1:41:27] there is a distinction between small C
[1:41:31] church and capital c Church Capital C he
[1:41:35] was identifying that he has a true
[1:41:38] church and a church mean elesia which
[1:41:41] means the called out one we are being
[1:41:44] called out in this evil age in this last
[1:41:46] days not only we are called but we are
[1:41:49] chosen we are elected we are
[1:41:52] predestinated we are separated
[1:41:55] Hallelujah we are Justified we are
[1:41:58] Sanctified and we are ready
[1:42:02] glorified Hallelujah his church would
[1:42:05] become so they would be one in the last
[1:42:08] days amen thank you Lord are we living
[1:42:11] in the last
[1:42:12] days
[1:42:14] Hallelujah Jesus Christ and his church
[1:42:17] would be become so they would be one in
[1:42:19] the last days of mared union he promised
[1:42:22] it not now we know that it is true
[1:42:26] because he came down
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:30] himself now he also
[1:42:32] promised that there would be a restoring
[1:42:36] of the faith we read over in Judah he
[1:42:39] said earnestly content for the faith
[1:42:41] which was once delivered to the
[1:42:44] Saints
[1:42:46] amen now we are promised in Malachi 4 by
[1:42:49] the same system he always did that he
[1:42:52] would be restored back to original faith
[1:42:55] and remember brother brandham said that
[1:42:58] the prophet
[1:43:00] came to fulfill Malachi
[1:43:03] 4 to restore the heart back of the
[1:43:06] children to the father and Revelation
[1:43:11] 107 is to reveal the secret of the seven
[1:43:16] seal because when the Revelation chapter
[1:43:19] 10 when the mighty angel came down and
[1:43:22] the Prophet identified that Mighty Angel
[1:43:24] was the Lord Jesus Christ spirit for
[1:43:26] coming down with an open book in his
[1:43:29] hand right hand amen which is the hand
[1:43:34] of
[1:43:37] Authority open book while in Revelation
[1:43:40] 5 it was a closed book right but now in
[1:43:43] Revelation 10 it was already an open
[1:43:47] book and when the seven Thunders uttered
[1:43:49] their
[1:43:50] voices and J was about to write and he
[1:43:53] heard the voice stop
[1:43:55] it it was prepared for the seventh angel
[1:44:00] to reveal what was in the
[1:44:01] seventh he can do two things turn the
[1:44:04] heart of the children and
[1:44:06] reveal the mystery of the seven tender
[1:44:11] amen so we are
[1:44:14] not it takes only the revelation of the
[1:44:18] word of God that will give us rapturing
[1:44:21] Faith denomination
[1:44:24] preaching so nothing's against that
[1:44:27] there are a lot of good sermons when
[1:44:30] about the
[1:44:32] denominational
[1:44:35] preachers nothing against that because
[1:44:37] some of the denominational preachers are
[1:44:40] sometimes good preacher compared to us
[1:44:43] in the message of the hour good grammars
[1:44:46] good sentences good ination all that and
[1:44:50] sometimes it can help people right
[1:44:53] better to become a
[1:44:55] better Christian in their Community
[1:44:58] right good standing good status in their
[1:45:00] Community right and sometimes it can
[1:45:03] help
[1:45:05] them
[1:45:07] feel the the presence of God and
[1:45:10] sometime they can cry they can worship
[1:45:13] they can testify of the goodness of God
[1:45:15] in their heart but the only thing that
[1:45:18] denomination can give us is the
[1:45:20] rupturing Faith because rupturing Faith
[1:45:23] only lays in the revelations of the word
[1:45:26] of God Amen so that's why outside of the
[1:45:29] revealed word of the hour we cannot
[1:45:31] receive the rupturing Faith because
[1:45:33] rupturing faith is the revelation of God
[1:45:35] personally to each and every one of us
[1:45:37] it was not given to
[1:45:39] anybody but it was given to a special
[1:45:42] class of people remember when Jesus
[1:45:45] Christ was
[1:45:46] resurrected they be the disciples are
[1:45:49] following Jesus Christ for how many
[1:45:50] years three and a half years in his
[1:45:52] ministry he saw they they saw all the
[1:45:54] Miracles the healings and all all the
[1:45:57] blessings but when he was crucified and
[1:46:00] he was resurrected and he presented
[1:46:02] himself to the disciples they don't even
[1:46:04] know know him they were so blank because
[1:46:09] dispensation changed he was no longer
[1:46:12] about his personal appearance he he was
[1:46:15] not dealing with the the physical flesh
[1:46:18] anymore right he came back to the logos
[1:46:21] again and he was trying to reveal the
[1:46:24] mystery of his
[1:46:26] will he's trying to reveal the mystery
[1:46:29] to his
[1:46:31] disciple that the the ministry changed
[1:46:34] he was trying he was not trying to point
[1:46:36] them to his physical fles he was trying
[1:46:39] to to point them back to the scripture
[1:46:42] that must be fulfilled in their age so
[1:46:45] that's why when he walked with the
[1:46:47] disciples to the nas what happened to
[1:46:49] you we we all know the stories
[1:46:53] and he told them oh you men of little
[1:46:55] faith D you know so he started opening
[1:46:59] the scripture beginning
[1:47:01] Moses true and the scripture said he
[1:47:04] opened the scripture beginning at Moses
[1:47:07] and to his time
[1:47:09] revealing himself revealing the
[1:47:12] scripture concerning
[1:47:15] himself so he's pointing back back
[1:47:19] pointing them back to the word that must
[1:47:21] be fulfilled in their age that's why in
[1:47:23] this last days this message is not for
[1:47:26] everybody it is only for his disciple
[1:47:30] remember that when he
[1:47:34] resurrected he didn't appear to the
[1:47:36] pareses the sagues the great
[1:47:38] denominational teachers of the day he
[1:47:41] did he he didn't show himself to to to
[1:47:45] Nazareth dist in Galilee where he was
[1:47:48] born right he didn't go to the to the
[1:47:51] place where he performed a lot of
[1:47:53] Miracles he didn't show himself to the
[1:47:55] public anymore but he only show himself
[1:47:58] to the
[1:47:59] disciple he shows to Mary all the
[1:48:02] disciples he show to to to everybody he
[1:48:05] was not long he was not longer revealing
[1:48:07] himself publicly but even the disciples
[1:48:11] Martha and Mary they went first into the
[1:48:15] tomb and they recognize that Jesus was
[1:48:17] not there and Jesus appeared to them and
[1:48:20] revealed himself right amen
[1:48:23] and they were so excited to share their
[1:48:27] experience that they saw Jesus Christ
[1:48:30] and they share it to their to the
[1:48:33] disciple to Thomas to
[1:48:36] Peter but did anybody believe it one
[1:48:39] another testimonies no it takes Jesus
[1:48:43] Christ himself to reveal himself to each
[1:48:45] and everyone that like brother Braham
[1:48:47] said New Birth is a personal revelation
[1:48:50] of Jesus Christ to you personally yes
[1:48:52] sir it is not by anybody's testimony
[1:48:55] anybody no it must be Christ himself
[1:48:58] personally revealing to you and that is
[1:49:00] by the opening of the word it takes
[1:49:03] himself to reveal to you this great deep
[1:49:06] mystery that's why he said why are you
[1:49:08] hungry in church why you're thirst is
[1:49:09] your heavenly father trying to reveal to
[1:49:11] you something and what is is something
[1:49:13] your part in his program of God so being
[1:49:17] the bride we are a part of God's program
[1:49:20] we need to recognize who we are or else
[1:49:22] we can never be
[1:49:24] restored how can you be restored when
[1:49:26] you don't know who you are that's why
[1:49:29] restoration back to the original is to
[1:49:31] know you are in the originally so that
[1:49:34] you can recognize to be go back in that
[1:49:44] direction so remember we need to
[1:49:48] recognize who we are yes if we don't
[1:49:51] recognize Who We Are
[1:49:53] that's why the prophet has the
[1:49:54] Declaration you need to recognize your
[1:49:56] day and your
[1:49:57] message it was not just only A good
[1:50:00] sermon that we can go okay but you take
[1:50:04] it
[1:50:05] personally because a prophet represent
[1:50:08] God directly to you just like Elijah was
[1:50:11] sent directly to you not to anybody else
[1:50:15] not to us or to somewhere else but
[1:50:17] Elijah was sent to you Hallelujah and
[1:50:20] that you you need to take get
[1:50:24] personal my heart was turned because I
[1:50:27] am part of that amen amen that's why
[1:50:31] when the Revelation seal was open
[1:50:34] Revelation 10 and the Seven ther Ed the
[1:50:37] voices and
[1:50:40] John I don't know where he get his
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] pen but he was about to write what he
[1:50:47] heard don't write it John and sometimes
[1:50:51] maybe we don't know maybe when he was
[1:50:53] about to be thrown you know when you are
[1:50:55] in the death row they they always ask
[1:50:58] you what is your last
[1:51:02] request so maybe J requested can I have
[1:51:05] a pen amen hallelujah so that I will
[1:51:09] leave my testimonies in case no I will
[1:51:12] not make it I can leave my testimony for
[1:51:16] somebody else that God is good amen I
[1:51:20] was beaten by scorpion I was beaten by
[1:51:23] venomous snake but I'm still alive
[1:51:26] fulfilling Mark 16 right that was maybe
[1:51:29] his thought but
[1:51:32] God in the book of Isiah said my thought
[1:51:35] are higher than your thoughts and my
[1:51:38] ways are higher than your ways he never
[1:51:41] thought about this book of Revelation he
[1:51:44] just as a pen maybe I can write my
[1:51:47] testimony here but God is so gracious
[1:51:50] right he has a higher ways he thought is
[1:51:52] high so that's why he gave him the
[1:51:54] Revelation Hallelujah of Jesus Christ so
[1:51:58] that every time he saw a vision he just
[1:52:00] wrote it wrote it so that's why we are
[1:52:04] privileged as John
[1:52:06] said blessed are they that read and hear
[1:52:10] the word of the
[1:52:12] testimony not the testimony of John but
[1:52:15] testimony of Jesus Christ because the
[1:52:17] Book of Revelation is the revelation of
[1:52:20] Jesus Christ not the
[1:52:23] experience of J while he was in the P so
[1:52:26] he was
[1:52:27] given the vision and he wrote everything
[1:52:30] until he come to Revelation chapter
[1:52:34] 10 when the seven Thunders uttered their
[1:52:36] voices he was so excited oh it's a thing
[1:52:39] I can write it but when the seven
[1:52:41] Thunders UT voice John don't write it I
[1:52:45] don't know if he that he was
[1:52:47] disappointed or not maybe he has a
[1:52:50] question in his mind why is so important
[1:52:54] that God will not allow me to write this
[1:52:58] Thunders everything I wrote it in except
[1:53:02] this certain portion of scripture don't
[1:53:05] write it John seal
[1:53:07] it it was the The Mystery of the seventh
[1:53:09] th Earth is
[1:53:13] given to the seventh angel of Revelation
[1:53:17] chapter 10 in the days of the voice of
[1:53:20] his seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:53:21] sound the mystery of God Reve
[1:53:26] it the holy spirit that forbid John to
[1:53:31] write is the same holy spirit that tell
[1:53:34] brother Braham pick up your pet and
[1:53:40] write in the P message he said one night
[1:53:43] I was seeking the Lord and the Holy
[1:53:46] Spirit told me to pick up my pen and
[1:53:48] write the same holy spirit that tell God
[1:53:52] don't write it God but here the same
[1:53:54] Holy Spirit tell the prophet pick up
[1:53:57] your pen and
[1:53:58] write while he seeking the Lord so
[1:54:01] that's important to seek the
[1:54:03] Lord we just don't come here and just
[1:54:06] listen to whoever Minister we need to
[1:54:09] read and listen to the scripture amen
[1:54:12] and sometimes we cannot understand what
[1:54:14] the the minister is saying because we
[1:54:17] are not reading amen when you read you
[1:54:19] can understand oh I know I read about it
[1:54:23] oh this is what it mean but if you are
[1:54:25] not
[1:54:26] reading true you will just
[1:54:29] stare the
[1:54:32] minister in blank
[1:54:35] face because you are not willing so you
[1:54:38] need to listen to the word of God if you
[1:54:40] cannot understand I believe the minister
[1:54:42] was sent to let you understand what you
[1:54:44] are reading amen just like when you go
[1:54:46] to school do you have textbook and
[1:54:48] sometimes you cannot even understand
[1:54:50] what you're reading until you're teacher
[1:54:52] came and teach what you are reading then
[1:54:55] you understand just like the message of
[1:54:57] the hour is so important that's why
[1:54:59] bless are they that
[1:55:01] hear and a lot of people cannot hear
[1:55:04] anymore so God is gracious you can still
[1:55:07] read amen God is so gracious you have no
[1:55:12] reason anymore because this message is
[1:55:16] directly addressed to each and every one
[1:55:18] of
[1:55:20] us thank your p and write and I grabs
[1:55:23] the pen and
[1:55:25] write Hallelujah so if it if the holy
[1:55:28] spirit is leading you don't hesitate to
[1:55:31] move according to what God is leading
[1:55:37] you amen his Spirit gave me a message to
[1:55:41] the church so this message is directly
[1:55:44] to the church yes
[1:55:47] amen I want to bring it to you it has to
[1:55:49] do with the word and the bride
[1:55:52] so that's why this letter this message
[1:55:55] is a love letter to each and every one
[1:55:57] of us this is so
[1:55:59] personal the Holy Spirit told Brother
[1:56:03] pick up the pen and write and he said
[1:56:06] his Spirit gave me a message for the
[1:56:08] church and I want to bring it to you it
[1:56:11] has to do with the word and the bright
[1:56:14] Hallelujah here is what I'm trying to
[1:56:16] say to you the law of reproduction that
[1:56:19] each spe bring forth after it own kind
[1:56:23] even according to Genesis 1 verse 11 and
[1:56:28] God said let the Earth bring forth grass
[1:56:32] and Herb yielding seed and the fruit
[1:56:34] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:56:38] is in itself so the fruit is already in
[1:56:41] the seed
[1:56:43] amen and the fruit yielding fruit after
[1:56:46] his kind who seed in itself upon the
[1:56:48] Earth and it was so whatever life was in
[1:56:50] the seed came forth into plant and dance
[1:56:53] into the fruit he said the very same law
[1:56:58] applies to the church
[1:57:01] today whatever seed bring forth of its
[1:57:04] kind remember in the Book of Genesis 1
[1:57:07] verse1 it said in the
[1:57:09] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:57:12] the
[1:57:14] Earth so if they say there is no God
[1:57:16] they are
[1:57:18] foolish because in the beginning God
[1:57:21] created the Heaven Earth period you
[1:57:24] cannot argue with it everything that we
[1:57:26] see around it testify that there was God
[1:57:29] it was not an evolution but it was God
[1:57:33] and we have the Bible the absolute word
[1:57:35] of God that declares that everything
[1:57:36] that we see around us it was God who
[1:57:39] created them and when God created the
[1:57:41] heavens and the Earth it was perfect
[1:57:44] amen amen but in verse
[1:57:47] two and there was void and darkness upon
[1:57:50] the Earth
[1:57:52] there was another sermon in verse two
[1:57:54] and verse one because God is not the
[1:57:56] author of darkness and confusion and
[1:57:59] Chaos God is righteous and he was
[1:58:02] perfect when he created heaven and earth
[1:58:04] it was perfect everything is harmony
[1:58:07] right but in verse two something
[1:58:09] happened that it became chaos and
[1:58:14] become dark and verse three and God
[1:58:18] begin to restore let there be life light
[1:58:23] and there was life let there
[1:58:27] be life let there be let there be let
[1:58:31] there be and it was so and it was good
[1:58:34] yes but when it came to verse 11 it
[1:58:37] didn't say Let There Be seed it says let
[1:58:40] every seed bring forth of its kind so
[1:58:44] the Earth even though in chaos and
[1:58:46] darkness the seed was already in
[1:58:49] that condition just like we
[1:58:52] yes when we are born into this world we
[1:58:55] are in darkness confusion we don't know
[1:58:57] anything about we don't know about God
[1:59:00] we don't know anything about it but when
[1:59:03] the prophet said when he preached God
[1:59:04] the mystery of God revealed he said when
[1:59:06] you are still a little baby the seat of
[1:59:09] God was already in you you may be in
[1:59:12] some confusion then you jump from one
[1:59:14] Church to another trying to find that
[1:59:17] thirst and thirsting your heart you can
[1:59:19] understand but there is something
[1:59:20] bubbling something moving that you
[1:59:22] cannot understand praise God that one
[1:59:24] day Hallelujah the gospel of the word of
[1:59:27] God was preached and the seed was
[1:59:29] quickened whatever seed you are in it
[1:59:32] will bring it to life there is a power
[1:59:35] of
[1:59:37] transformation he didn't say Let There
[1:59:39] Be seed he said let every seed bring
[1:59:41] forth of its kind Hallelujah if you are
[1:59:44] the seed of God in this last day then
[1:59:46] the Gospel Life will Quicken the seed
[1:59:49] and whatever seed you are in you will
[1:59:52] become that
[1:59:53] sin if you are a son of God you will
[1:59:56] manifest God whether you like it or not
[1:59:59] whether you want to run away from it you
[2:00:02] will manifest it because we have the
[2:00:04] word of God s in US last day to Quicken
[2:00:07] the sea let every SE bring forth be if
[2:00:11] you are son of the of God you will
[2:00:13] manifest God and what is got the word of
[2:00:16] God
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:26] don't worry about your
[2:00:29] fruit we don't struggle to manifest the
[2:00:33] fruit oh I need to have faith I need to
[2:00:36] have patience I need to have brotherly
[2:00:38] kindness and I fail then I go back
[2:00:41] together that is
[2:00:43] law but the word of God let every SE
[2:00:46] bring forth to be kind the fruit which
[2:00:48] is in the
[2:00:50] seed amen will take and with time and
[2:00:54] season for that seed to manifest because
[2:00:57] the fruit is already in that
[2:00:59] seed just like the Sheep cannot produce
[2:01:03] or manufacture the
[2:01:05] W the Sheep always manifest of the world
[2:01:10] is just naturally because that it was a
[2:01:14] part of his makeup that's like you as
[2:01:17] Sons and Daughters of God you don't
[2:01:20] struggle to have patience
[2:01:22] don't struggle to have faith don't
[2:01:24] struggle to have brotherly kindness let
[2:01:27] the word of God lay the presence of the
[2:01:32] son the resurrection son that will take
[2:01:35] the greenness away from you and it will
[2:01:38] manifest in his time and his season we
[2:01:42] are not legalist don't do this don't do
[2:01:44] that don't know Hallelujah the message
[2:01:46] is Grace Grace

[2:01:51] [Applause]
[2:01:54] we don't limit the grace of
[2:01:57] God our thought is limited our ways are
[2:02:01] limited our judgment are limited but the
[2:02:04] grace of God is

[2:02:10] you go to the Philippines we have a lot
[2:02:12] of fast food that offers unlimited
[2:02:18] rice that's why the business is booming
[2:02:22] because rice is one of our stable stable
[2:02:26] food when you say unlimited rice
[2:02:29] everybody goes there we will go to this
[2:02:32] place because it's
[2:02:33] unlimited we have unlimited promise of
[2:02:37] God hallelujah Psalms 103 I am the Lord
[2:02:40] God that Health all
[2:02:42] th and do not forget this B ofit do not
[2:02:46] forget the bit of how God praise God
[2:02:50] gave himself for you
[2:02:52] he didn't gave himself for anybody else
[2:02:54] just for you if you are in trouble
[2:02:57] remember that he said it is that it is
[2:02:59] minut it it is already done deal
[2:03:03] whatever situation you are in right now
[2:03:06] just believe ask anything he said ask
[2:03:09] anything in my name he didn't say and
[2:03:13] brother Barry will do it and brother
[2:03:15] mbin will do it and any Minister will do
[2:03:18] it he said if you ask anything in my
[2:03:20] name I personal will do it do you
[2:03:25] believe
[2:03:26] it Hallelujah if you are a message
[2:03:28] believer you need to believe
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:33] it and don't be discouraged when you
[2:03:38] ask I say he didn't manifest in my life
[2:03:42] but God promised he will do it but why
[2:03:44] did it didn't
[2:03:49] happen don't make God a
[2:03:52] I amen amen when you
[2:03:55] ask we want answer in our own way Lord
[2:03:59] answer according to our understanding
[2:04:03] but when God say he will do it he didn't
[2:04:05] say I will do it
[2:04:09] immediately because sometimes God
[2:04:13] answer yes and sometime he answer
[2:04:17] no right and he sometime he answer wait
[2:04:21] right
[2:04:22] Abraham when God gave him the
[2:04:25] promise Abraham waited 25 years but the
[2:04:29] scripture said Abraham staggered not at
[2:04:32] the promise of God through unbelief but
[2:04:35] was strong Hallelujah because he sinth
[2:04:39] faithful the one who made a promise when
[2:04:42] God made a promise he is obligated to
[2:04:45] fulfill it amen we are not obligated to
[2:04:47] fulfill it brother Braham is not
[2:04:49] obligated to fulfill what God's PR but
[2:04:52] it was God himself will do
[2:04:56] it Noah waited 120
[2:05:00] years but did God do it yes he
[2:05:06] did just don't ask God that Lord let me
[2:05:10] win a lot of
[2:05:13] with but God is not the prophet is not
[2:05:17] legalist oh it's sin no he don't want to
[2:05:20] say that he just
[2:05:22] check your motives and
[2:05:27] objectives if you are a Christian are
[2:05:29] you asking to win a
[2:05:33] lot brother bam said it is a sin he he
[2:05:36] didn't say it is a sin but they said
[2:05:39] check your motive and your object there
[2:05:43] because if you are a Christian you are
[2:05:45] seeking more on the revelation of the
[2:05:47] word of
[2:05:49] God because he said seeking first the
[2:05:51] kingdom of God and all these things
[2:05:55] whatever things that you need it will be
[2:05:57] added according to your faith amen so we
[2:06:00] need to seek first the kingdom of God
[2:06:04] Amen sometimes we struggle on that
[2:06:07] Avenue because we don't even give our
[2:06:09] tithes and
[2:06:11] offering that's why we always look why I
[2:06:13] am so poor why am I'm not blessed
[2:06:16] because you are not fulfilling God's
[2:06:17] promise he said try me he challenged you
[2:06:21] try me if I will not pour out the
[2:06:24] blessing and you have no room praise God
[2:06:27] to fulfill it that's the secret not the
[2:06:30] lottery
[2:06:34] ticket right now the very same law
[2:06:37] applies to the church today yes amen so
[2:06:41] we have a presentent message whatever
[2:06:43] seed you are in praise God you need to
[2:06:46] recognize it because if you cannot
[2:06:48] recognize it you will never be restored
[2:06:50] back
[2:06:52] amen because this is the message of
[2:06:53] restoration and only those who are part
[2:06:56] of the program of God will be restored
[2:06:58] just like Redemption is bringing back to
[2:07:01] your original
[2:07:02] own the very same law applies to the
[2:07:05] church today whatever seed started the
[2:07:08] church will come forth and be like the
[2:07:10] Original Seed because it is the same
[2:07:12] seed and in this last day the true bride
[2:07:15] church with the parenthesis is Christ SE
[2:07:20] so here is your
[2:07:22] identification the true church is
[2:07:26] Christy are you Christy this
[2:07:28] morning don't be ashamed to claim I am
[2:07:31] it because God is trying to reveal to
[2:07:34] you who you are Hallelujah you need to
[2:07:37] claim it you need to profess it I am the
[2:07:39] thank you Lord hallelujah the more you
[2:07:41] are grateful for the things that God is
[2:07:43] doing for your life the more God will
[2:07:45] reveal himself to you more and more
[2:07:48] don't hesitate to claim Who You Are in
[2:07:51] this last day you need to identify
[2:07:53] yourself I am the Son of God I am not
[2:07:57] Hallelujah I am not just anybody I am a
[2:07:59] Son of God although I have so many
[2:08:01] failure but God don't count your failure
[2:08:05] he's looking at the SE in N SE there is
[2:08:08] nothing to Quicken but if you are the SE
[2:08:10] of God then you can be reor because in N
[2:08:13] SE there is nothing to be quickened but
[2:08:15] if you are the seed of God hallelujah
[2:08:18] God is
[2:08:19] obligated yes amen
[2:08:22] to Quicken that sin so in this last day
[2:08:26] do don't look at your
[2:08:28] shortcomings sometimes we don't enjoy
[2:08:30] the blessings of God because we keep on
[2:08:32] looking out our mistakes we keep looking
[2:08:35] at our
[2:08:36] failures but the message of the hour
[2:08:39] just recognize who you are not your
[2:08:46] failure just like
[2:08:50] Gideon when they they commit sin unto
[2:08:52] the Lord they were given to the to their
[2:08:56] enemies so that's why they are always
[2:08:58] hiding in hiding so that's why when you
[2:09:01] commit sin to the Lord you you you you
[2:09:04] refrain yourself from fellowship from
[2:09:06] from going to church because you are
[2:09:08] hiding for
[2:09:09] something remember that God is so
[2:09:14] gracious when the angel of the Lord
[2:09:16] appeared to Gideon I want you to deliver
[2:09:18] your people right yes the Gideon began
[2:09:22] to look at himself yes his failure they
[2:09:25] were poor always hiding from the enemy
[2:09:29] but the angel of the Lord said I want
[2:09:32] you to deliver the people he heard the
[2:09:36] word of God but he looks at his failure
[2:09:39] maybe you're mistaken Lord for somebody
[2:09:41] else because you see I am the poorest of
[2:09:44] all the
[2:09:45] poor but the angel of the Lord said you
[2:09:49] are a man of follow yeah amen he did the
[2:09:53] the message of the hour didn't point to
[2:09:55] your shortcomings but your
[2:09:58] representation Thou Art the man of our
[2:10:00] and the Propet said in this last day
[2:10:02] thou are a super race of people you are
[2:10:05] special of people you are super race of
[2:10:08] people you are not just an ordinary
[2:10:10] people you are not just an ordinary
[2:10:12] church member you are the Church of the
[2:10:14] Living God don't look at your
[2:10:16] shortcoming look at the promise of God
[2:10:19] pertains to yourself you you are the Son
[2:10:21] of God and you need to stay Lord I know
[2:10:25] I have so many
[2:10:27] shortcomings but I need you Lord I only
[2:10:30] believe that I am Sons and Daughters of
[2:10:32] God because I will never walk with you
[2:10:35] this far true if not by the grace of God
[2:10:39] because his promis so through I will
[2:10:41] never leave you in the midst of your
[2:10:44] trial in the midst of your persecution
[2:10:46] in in the midst of your distress I will
[2:10:49] never leave you and I will never even
[2:10:52] forsake
[2:10:53] you but I will be with you not only with
[2:10:57] you but I will be in you walking through
[2:11:01] you Hallelujah so that's why the promise
[2:11:04] is here continue praise God feeding
[2:11:06] yourself with the word of God because
[2:11:09] lay in the presence of God where can you
[2:11:11] lay in the presence to the preaching of
[2:11:13] the word you need to hear every word
[2:11:16] every time you hear the word hallelujah
[2:11:18] it will give you something amen
[2:11:22] thank amen Jacob was a
[2:11:25] supplanter and a deceiver as the prophet
[2:11:29] said Jacob was a Shyer a mama's
[2:11:35] boy
[2:11:37] right he deceived his
[2:11:40] dad but Esau was a strong man when we
[2:11:43] look at physically we will vote for Esau
[2:11:48] he was a hunter he was a strong man man
[2:11:52] he was a responsible man he L his father
[2:11:55] but Jacob he was as yers a boy a skinny
[2:12:01] boy but the time has come that God is
[2:12:03] going to reveal to him who he was am
[2:12:07] that's why he wrestled with the angel of
[2:12:09] the Lord and when the angel of the Lord
[2:12:11] is trying to reveal who he was he keep
[2:12:14] on struggling I am supplanter I am
[2:12:17] deceiver I have done nothing good in my
[2:12:20] life
[2:12:22] but the angel is trying to reveal to him
[2:12:24] something you are not a sulter Jacob you
[2:12:27] are not a deceiver Jacob you are not a
[2:12:29] mous boy but you are a prince of God
[2:12:32] Jacob you need to recognize who you are
[2:12:34] you are a prince of God hallelujah so
[2:12:38] don't look at yourself because the time
[2:12:40] has come that God is going to reveal to
[2:12:42] you who you are don't look at mistake
[2:12:45] but your representation in Christ that's
[2:12:48] why the angel of the Lord you are not a
[2:12:51] supplanter you are not the deceiver and
[2:12:54] when we receive the
[2:12:57] Revelation keep on
[2:13:00] liing it was the evence then he received
[2:13:03] the revelation of who he was there must
[2:13:06] always be a change amen not by your own
[2:13:11] struggle because if you struggle to
[2:13:13] become who you
[2:13:15] are you will fail right but just humble
[2:13:19] ourselves in the presence of the Lord
[2:13:21] Lord help me just reveal to you reveal
[2:13:25] to me who you are amen and I can humble
[2:13:28] myself Lead Me Lord all the days of my
[2:13:31] life
[2:13:33] amen
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:36] hallelujah the very same law applies to
[2:13:38] the church today whatever seed started
[2:13:41] the
[2:13:41] church will come forth and be like the
[2:13:46] will come
[2:13:47] for whether you like it or not that's
[2:13:50] right you will come for because this is
[2:13:52] the Harvest Time that gaing all the seed
[2:13:55] of God whether you want to run go run
[2:13:59] amen but God will yes sir true remember
[2:14:04] Jonah he was trying to run from the
[2:14:07] presence of God he has the right
[2:14:10] decision he has the right thinking
[2:14:11] because he if go to the Nineveh he will
[2:14:14] be persecuted he has the right
[2:14:17] thought so he went to
[2:14:19] thus yes but remember when God created
[2:14:23] in the Book of Genesis God created a
[2:14:27] whale the Book of Genesis yes is what do
[2:14:32] you think it was an accident that
[2:14:34] created a whale of all the pieces that
[2:14:36] men can eat when he created a whale
[2:14:40] because that whale was prepared for
[2:14:42] Jonah when he comes when he manifest
[2:14:45] amen everything that comes our way God
[2:14:48] already prepared everything for amen
[2:14:51] that's why we said the lamb was slain
[2:14:53] before the foundation of the word amen
[2:14:55] who
[2:14:59] is who is the who who is first The
[2:15:03] Sinner or the Savior
[2:15:08] right first is the savior he already
[2:15:11] prepared a way before we came born
[2:15:14] that's why Jonah before he decided to go
[2:15:17] to Tarsus God already prepar a whale in
[2:15:20] fact that whale was already prepared in
[2:15:21] the Book of Genesis for 4,000 years or
[2:15:24] maybe 2,000 years it's a long way but
[2:15:26] God already prepared so you cannot run
[2:15:28] away from the program of God that's 400
[2:15:31] years God already prepared a whale that
[2:15:33] when the time comes that Jonah will
[2:15:35] decide to go against the word of God the
[2:15:39] whale was already prepared to bring him
[2:15:41] to where God wants him to be that's why
[2:15:45] don't run away from
[2:15:47] God you will just experience misery
[2:15:50] despair
[2:15:51] Temptation
[2:15:53] anxiety
[2:15:54] depression but just humble yourself in

[2:17:17] even in my Ministry I've been Pastor for
[2:17:19] five five years then I realized I'm not
[2:17:23] called to be a pastor so I decided to be
[2:17:26] a simple
[2:17:27] Layman and I thought to myself well to
[2:17:31] be a minister and to be a Layman is we
[2:17:35] we can still receive the same reward why
[2:17:37] should I sacrifice myself spend so much
[2:17:41] time uh asking God what what to
[2:17:46] preach that's why I always respect a
[2:17:49] pastor
[2:17:51] it takes a lot of time effort
[2:17:54] dedication to seek the mind of God right
[2:17:58] amen the sermon is not
[2:18:00] just to to praise him oh he has a good
[2:18:04] sermon no the word of God was inspired
[2:18:08] put in his Minister's heart that is for
[2:18:12] the
[2:18:13] people it's not for himself but it's for
[2:18:16] you and me yes amen and that word
[2:18:19] sometimes that we which we can benefit
[2:18:22] out from it because the message is not
[2:18:25] for ours but for you and sometimes we
[2:18:27] prepare a sermon and we can preach
[2:18:30] sometimes our sermon as it was inspired
[2:18:32] by the word of God by your help God will
[2:18:35] turn our
[2:18:36] thoughts right Amen to minister to its
[2:18:40] needs that's why every Gathering is a
[2:18:43] supernatural Gathering we may not know
[2:18:46] what's the leading of the Holy Spirit
[2:18:48] but if we yield he can minister to your
[2:18:51] needs because God is sharper than two
[2:18:54] edged George you know the thoughts of
[2:18:56] your heart the intent of your heart he
[2:18:57] knows each and everyone's needs
[2:19:00] amen amen I decided not to to minister
[2:19:05] anymore my great to the US and stay
[2:19:08] brother on church and just be a simple
[2:19:12] Believers and he asked me can you preach
[2:19:14] for
[2:19:15] us no brother I'm sorry but I cannot
[2:19:19] preach because my English is is no
[2:19:21] good there's a lot of brothers here
[2:19:25] white brothers that have a desire to
[2:19:29] preach so just excuse me because I I I I
[2:19:35] I'm already satisfied with being a lay
[2:19:39] man he asked me three times and I said
[2:19:42] no just give it to them but then I have
[2:19:45] a burden for the brother in Philippines
[2:19:49] I know I I will never pre again but I
[2:19:52] have decide I'd bring brother Ron there
[2:19:54] to preach for them and brother Ron said
[2:19:56] that I will not go to the Philippines
[2:19:58] because there's already a lot of
[2:19:59] ministers coming in coming in and I
[2:20:02] don't want to go where all the ministers
[2:20:04] are going and I told him just go to my
[2:20:08] hometown because the ministers
[2:20:11] are just stuck in in Manila in
[2:20:16] Theon there's so many churches and
[2:20:19] mostly of the ministry cannot go to my
[2:20:21] hometown so it's another Province you
[2:20:24] need to fly by by plane for 1 hour and
[2:20:28] they said okay I we go there's not so
[2:20:30] much minutes coming in so we went there
[2:20:33] and he share and was so blessed then the
[2:20:35] next time I told him we would go again
[2:20:37] in Manila so during the time of Manila
[2:20:41] it was a convention and uh he was so
[2:20:45] sick that he was given three kinds of
[2:20:49] antibiotic but it never help him then he
[2:20:52] said but Mario Can You Preach for for me
[2:20:55] so I have
[2:20:58] no I cannot say no because we are caught
[2:21:02] up in that
[2:21:03] situation said
[2:21:06] okay anyway I don't have any problem
[2:21:09] because it was my own language so it's
[2:21:13] okay so when I preach after
[2:21:16] that the service and the spirit of God
[2:21:20] moved
[2:21:21] and said brother Mar I want you to
[2:21:22] preach in my in my church when we go
[2:21:25] back home and when I heard that I was so
[2:21:28] nervous that in my thought I decide I
[2:21:30] will not go back to the
[2:21:34] US and when we arve in the state he is
[2:21:37] announcing oh maybe we can try some of
[2:21:39] the brothers here and I keep on pray
[2:21:41] Lord please let brother Ron forget what
[2:21:46] he's told me
[2:21:49] Lord but then we cannot run away from
[2:21:53] our time has come that
[2:21:57] he persuade me to
[2:22:00] preach and he said brother you know when
[2:22:03] I was a deacon in our church my pastor
[2:22:06] also told me to preach and every time he
[2:22:08] told me to preach I was so nervous that
[2:22:11] I come to the point that even
[2:22:14] vomited because of my
[2:22:17] nervousness and my pastor told me I
[2:22:20] don't okay if you bang it in the pet I
[2:22:22] want you to
[2:22:24] preach and it gives me a parable okay so
[2:22:30] I cannot run away from this even though
[2:22:32] I say I'm not good in English but he's
[2:22:35] trying to persuade me to preach and I
[2:22:39] told him okay just pray for me and I
[2:22:44] preached during that time Mother's
[2:22:46] Day May 10th of 19 or 2010
[2:22:50] and I preached and by God's
[2:22:53] grace uh I make it to the
[2:22:58] end and after the the service it was
[2:23:01] brother Aon McGary you know him so he
[2:23:05] went right ahead to the office and he
[2:23:07] said brother Mario I was so blessed by
[2:23:09] your preaching that the question in my
[2:23:13] heart for how many years it was answered
[2:23:16] through your preaching amen I told to
[2:23:18] praise the Lord and was not me brother
[2:23:22] it was God himself that's why we cannot
[2:23:25] run away from our calling we cannot run
[2:23:29] away if we are a seed of God God Will
[2:23:31] Make A Way for that seed to manifest so
[2:23:34] God bless you this morning he trust that
[2:23:36] it will encourage you to keep on moving
