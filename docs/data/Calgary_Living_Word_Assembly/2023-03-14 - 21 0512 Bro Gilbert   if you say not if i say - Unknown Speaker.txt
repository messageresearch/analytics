prayers tonight my brothers and our sisters over there are encountering a major major event that's going on and I can forward you a speech that was forwarded to me by Benjamin Netanyahu but the gist of it is he's given them an ultimatum to stop throwing Rockets they've got 24 hours to stop and if they throw one more rocket they're going to March forward with the ground defensive and an air offensive and every single inch of ground that they March into they're going to claim as their very own and they're not going to give it back that is a major turn of events if that happens I would just like to pray for the Lord's will to be done in Israel thank you you just you just can't help but look at God's timepiece and recognize Where We Are let's just go to him in prayer tonight our gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we're so thankful that we can recognize our position in you Lord not by anything that we have done Lord not by anything that we could ever accomplish in this

ordained Lord God a Scarlet chain a Scarlet thread oh Father to have that revelation of what it means to be redeemed to have a revelation of what it means to be bought back because you owned us from

maybe we can sing verse two as we welcome brother Gilbert tonight you are [Music] alive foreign [Applause] [Music] that is true Lord [Music] you are all that we need father the poet sang and saying you can give me the whole world but it will not help me I only need Jesus and the other revealed word and you are the reason we are here father and it is you who has put that desire and the hunger in our hearts to sing from the depths of our hearts that you are all that we need Heavenly Father and you say blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled Lord Jesus Christ we know you have prepared our Temple now for your children and we come hungering father in our souls we just want to hear the revealed word Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we know you are here increase raise our faith Lord that we can touch you further and never to remain the same Lord Jesus we pray as we commit the service now in your hands Lord father just take me out of the way if I might be a hindrance for your children to hear what the spirit has to say to your children then Lord close my my lips that Lord Jesus Christ they may only hear from you not from a man we committed the reading of your word in your hands father may you keep the inspiration where you keep the special anointing loving master that Lord Jesus Christ we may not use our human understanding but Lord let it be a revelation direct from you then at the end of the service we will say surely God spoke to my heart we thank you fathers we commit all things now in your hands even the needs that are that have been prayed for Lord Jesus Christ we still commit them in your hands Lord father you are our present helper in times of need Lord Jesus Christ we said now you are word for deliverance we now send your word for healing Lord Jesus Christ we want at the end of everything father all honor and the glory to return to yourself Jesus Christ's name we pray thank you musicians yeah as our pastor has said I was scheduled to be in late preach and I actually wanted to conclude the the thought that okay the thought that we were having I started in I started it in 11th Bridge and we were saying just as the brother Paul has been inspired to think that that song that he's here is it okay thank you my brother we were saying fear not he's here fear not he's in the board so if he's in the boat he knows all that is happening regardless of where the weeds the the the the the the the the the the the the winds are blowing recruitness of the situation he knows each and everything so now that he is there just Reach Out And Touch him and you'll never be the same that's all that we need just reach out if he's here then touch him amen oh my goodness Saint Mark chapter 11. the pastor has been speaking on this subject and I can't deviate from it it happened that those are the scriptures I'm going to read and I believe we are going to be blessed I I just failed so humble when the pastor prayed he con he he gave a summary of the of the salmon now I said what am I going to do to preach because people might say we are hard talked about it but anyway that was the prayer God intended it to be that way so for those who are following the prayer that was the summary of the sermon Mark chapter 11. we read from verse 23 to 25. for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things so ever you desire when he pray believe that he received them and he shall have them and when he stand praying forgive if he have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses then we'll also turn to Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 to 3. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying against the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit may God bless the reading of the word you can take your seats laughs now this evening I've called it the title of my sermon if you say not if I say not if I say that is a quote the prophet said if you say not if I say that is the power that God has given to the church if you say not if I say but if you say so that power has been given to us so it is now us to recognize that power that is in US then we exercise it but if we have the power and we cannot exercise it what is the problem we have not allowed ourselves to recognize Who We Are now the ultimate promise of the pride is the speaking condition I'll repeat it again the ultimate promise of the pride is the speaking condition I expected a very big amen that is that is the climax of the message of the hour the speaking condition the third pool and that's why I said if you say not if I say that is God Christ is said he's telling you if you say to this mountain not if I say to this mountain if you say to this mountain so it is now you to say amen now we've been saying we are we were saying that fear not now the absence of fear is faith and we say it fear is a captive of all situations but the faith is the master now when the master comes every other thing has to keep quiet oh my God can it happen yes yes when the master comes everything has to keep quiet and listen to what the master has to say so let us invite now the master to come and say now for fear to be cast out perfectly we need perfect faith and the perfect faith is different from normal faith we have to differentiate that you woke up in the morning you had faith that you will come to church and unbeliever woke up in the morning had faith that he will accomplish what he planned to do he had faith we had Faith but now the rapturing faith is a different faith we will see how to come to the rapturing faith now these are the faith that we had in seven Church ages it could not take it could not bring the rapture so we need a different faith that will bring the translation of our bodies now no no believer will get I will I will explain that statement No believer will get that faith on the rapturing on on the Rapture Day that it will be being dished or you can have it you can have it now you can have it no those who will make it to the Rapture they are packing the proctoring faith now they are packing it today how by hearing because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word now the word that you hear it brings Faith every time you hear it increases your faith so you cannot just sit there that I will make it by chance no because faith comes by hearing amen and that faith comes from only one source that is the perfect word of God now our calling today is perfect Faith which comes by hearing perfect word or the complete word now it is not your effort but what you believe in may God help us now in the message perfect Faith the prophet says paragraph 39 I want you to catch this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how we are too close to the end now and I believe the church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and wrap some of this make believe out so and that's why Paul said we need let us forget about the foundations perfection how are we going to go into perfection we have received it but the perfect word but why is it not producing fruits anytime message has to produce anytime fruits we will come to eat amen now in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 13 from verse 13 is a familiar scripture that we know when Jesus said who two people say I am then the disciples saying what people say when it comes to what people say we can quote it very much perfectly but then he changed the scenario and said who do you say now when it comes to an individual you must know exactly what you are talking about remember the other time I say it my inspiration came from two messages one is I know my redeemer liveth now you need to come where you say I know that is not we know I know so it has to be a personal revelation so when Peter said Thou Art the Christ it was a personal revelation so that's why I said when it comes to you giving a personal testimony you must know exactly what you are talking about and where you are standing one time after I had just believed then I met a man who was out of his mind he was running around kicking everything then I said but but I'm a Christian I should pray for this guy I I almost had it very rough [Laughter] then another another uh another time we were invited by a sister to go and pray for her mother who was in an insane Institution so I went with a brother a friend of mine and uh when we met with the mother she was okay we were chatting and she was she she was good then another Pharaoh came by he listened to all that we were talking about that the brother that I was with he asked him do you want us to pray for you that statement woke up the demons [Laughter] when he when he heard about prayer that guy became Wild why am I saying this you must know where you are standing some situations you must know who you are when you are confronted with those equations you must know exactly who you are why am I saying like this we are manifested sons of God now if we are manifested sons of God then we are the manifestations amen now for you to come into the faith of this hour you must be ready to lose your opinion you must be ready to lose your intellect you must be ready to lose your feelings and you must be ready to lose the way I see it it has to be the way he has said it will get there now but our faith is not not perfected until the opening of the seals until the seals are opened to you oh my goodness of the serious revealing Korea open to you they reveal Christ to you then you being in him you see yourself and that's why the prophet said when the seals were opened the Bible became a newborn a new Bible amen okay now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning that's uh in in in the message perfect Faith paragraph 19. as we said this morning try to get the church into the place to where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that is what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see it more we wanted such a flow that it will help it will be helped to us and flow us and flow from us to others oh my I pray that it will come out the way the way it got revealed it to me it flows through you until you can give it to others it reminds me the scripture where Jesus Christ said whomsoever since you remit it will be remitted we are the only people who can forgive people sins do we believe it whomsoever since you remit they will be remitted what if you don't forgive I believe we need to get to a point whereby we know ourselves and when you are walking you know it is Christ who is walking the human element has gone so far and then when you walk as well it is Christ who is working and whatever you do you do it because Christ has shown it to you we are going to say I have the quote he shows you and and you whatever you do you do nothing except what he has shown you to do if you cover yourself you'll be disappointed amen stealing the message perfect Faith now listen close see it is not what you imagine it is just as real to you as innocence of your body will declare anything else it is just as real as my eyes says this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that that is light it's just as real as to say I feel my court it's just as real as as as as I hear that people talk Talking there or making its noise see that's real as music playing it's just as real as I test anything in my mouth it is it is that real only you can't show it to somebody else you have it alone I am man it is yours faith is a substance it is yours amen thank you Lord now these are real deep lessons and I will catch the top of it then you dig down into it imagine the prophet saying it's a deep teaching he will just touch it on top of it but then you go deeper oh my now that's where we are going oh my I feel like jumping up now [Laughter] oh my God okay now notice it is something that you possess not imagination if you really have it it's just as real as you as any other thing that could be it is just as real as you know that you are writing in your automobile it is just as real as you know that you are sitting in the church you are sitting in the church it is just as real as you hear my voice it is a substance not an imagination not an emotion but it's something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of God only okay Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that puts it back to where you are Faith then it is not it is not in some individual it is in a man it's not in an organization but it is in you as a person amen Faith cometh by hearing maybe Pastor if you will allow me I'll say if you can allow me to say this if I think many of us have taken advantage of covet so that we don't even listen to the word I hope the rest you will forgive me Pastor you'll forgive me to say this sometimes I beat for the Deacons two more slots remaining one more slots remaining and it goes for one hour without somebody responding and yet Faith cometh by hearing we want faith but we don't want the process God have mercy on us have we lost the interest the more closer we are the more we need to be focused the more we need to get away all the distractions we know we have the challenges but remember our subject is Jesus is in the pot so even with those challenges Jesus Christ is still in the body he's still the same yesterday today and forever so if he is in the boat he knows exactly what you are going through he knows exactly what I'm going through he's here we only need to touch him but Faith cometh by hearing amen okay now when you get this kind of Faith or this type of Faith you better doubt what you are seeing than doubt that Faith which is a super sense can somebody without what he's seeing you doubt what you are seeing I don't know if I'm seeing Barry or I'm seeing somebody else God help us now in the spirit Realm are ready to you are ready to doubt even your memories you are ready to doubt even your affections you are ready to doubt even your your reasonings if you end that channel now and this comes by how much of this what you have packed in your soul it comes by how much you have packed now that brings us to the to the point where quality and the quantity quality is what that we have it is quality it has addressed every situation in this in this world so as far as what it is concerned we have no problem but now what we need is the quantity and the quantity depends on how much you Feast on it how much you eat how much you are packing how much how many how many hours how many what fraction of the day do you give to this world so the quantity is the difference between where I am and perfect faith I love that the quantity is the difference between Where You Are and perfect faith so we want to talk about perfect Faith but how much quantity do you have hello I believe I'm talking to somebody I'm also speaking to myself the difference the quantity is the difference between where I am and perfect faith amen okay in the message presuming paragraph 77 the prophet says Paul according to Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 5 he said God predestinated us before the foundation of the world to the adoptions of sons in Jesus Christ how are you going to stop it all devils in hell you might as well quit fasting about it it is going to be there without spot or wrinkle it is going to to be what a bright judge Hallelujah God said I will restore restore what one without organization or touch one without pure another one one with the pure and not alterated word it has to come the other time I say it God's purpose however however how how it doesn't matter how many demons comes in your way God's purpose has to be fulfilled now God's purpose in our day is to get upright without spot or wrinkle that is his purpose oh no matter you are unbelief or whatever God has to achieve his purpose so there has to come somebody that will believe this word a hundred percent remember we said about the the three the Hebrew children when the when when when the king said the fire had to be multiplied seven times the prophet said multiplying it even a thousand times would not change God's purpose oh my goodness [Laughter] oh my God that is somebody who knows where he's standing oh God help us amen okay okay Bye by his faith in his word we he conquer us that is paragraph 141 of perfect faith the prophet is saying by his faith in his word we he congas are we getting that English we he conquers who is Conquering him through US amen we he conquers so through you he conquers so without you how is he going to conquer then how is he going to conquer by how much you have packed in your soul how much the word you have packed in your soul Prophet says you become the one as you hear the word so what you hear is what you become but we have come to a point where we feed the plaque dog more than we feed the white dog and yet we want the white dog to be victorious oh my I love this we he conquers we can conquer anything anything both death hell under the grave we know that God is God that perfect faith in God's perfect world he conquered everything that he came in contact with death he could not even death could not even stand in his presence sickness could not even stand in his presence flowing from him was like rivers of virtue going out constantly what you going from his comment all those people laying in his Shadows step put their finger on his comment and were healed there he was walking in a world with perfect Faith because he was the word how do we become the word feet on the word pack it pack it pack it by the way the more you listen to the word when the preacher comes here you will know whether he's preaching the message whether he's preaching the message or his own ideas you are so much in tune with the word until every statement that is made you at least have an idea where it came from it's happening it can happen but some but it it happens that many of us we wait until what we will hear from the minister God have mercy on me we have become Sunday believers and yet we want perfect faith how does it come hearing the word oh my we are more closer than yesterday and every sign around us it should it should be a wake-up call to us and ask where am I how much how much effect is this what having on me how much am I surrendering to this word amen there he was walking in a world with perfect Faith because he was the word and now if he abide in me through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of a way virtues flowing from you the rivers of God's foundings of blessings just flowing out to the people see what I mean and you are not bluffing it you are not imagining it it is actually taking place and you see it if you are just imagining it it doesn't happen then there is a reason why we are here there is a reason why we are here there is a reason why you are in Calgary there is a reason why you are where you are and there is a reason on who you are if you can know the reason that I'm here to serve God's purpose and God's purpose has to be fulfilled he has to get a pride he has to get a pride without spot without Ringo oh my goodness now in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed paragraph 417 then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will represent Christ's a beloved Pride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised glory amen by them through them will be fulfilled all and When God says all he means all are you one of them amen the what of promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself met manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that he has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be it unto me as thou has said the written word it was spoken by an Angel but it was written by Isaiah amen now still in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed paragraph 419. they will love him who oh my goodness I I think we need to come to POI to a point where when the what is said they you put yourself you put your name there so here he's saying they will love him who amen they they will love him love his you love him you love those who are his [Laughter] oh my goodness you love those who are his are there are there people who are his yes so you will also love them those who are his oh my and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of Christ was his if Jesus come to this Dome the storm and you have believed his word you have the potential also to calm the storm then he has built a character in you which he can trust oh my I love that he builds a character in you what is the character of obeying his word Let It Be unto me according to your one he that is the character that he gives you to obey his word all that he says you say Amen oh my now notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father shot him first Harmony between God and the Christ see John 5 19 so is the pride he shows her his word of life he shows how she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I go I caught a great big Hallelujah here is the sacred the word is in the bride under the might of Christ to know what he once done with the word that's right the what is in the pride how did it end you pack it the more you pack it the more you pack it actually the the okay I I hope we'll get there the prophet says it will come from inside you it will not come from outside it has to come from inside you and it it depends on how much you have packed inside oh my goodness oh my amen the what is in the pride the mind of Christ to know what he once done with the word and he does it in his name she has thus says the Lord then it is traumatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose this ministry has no place for fear but perfect faith fear not fear not he's here fear not he's in the body fear not so that's the ministry that this ministry that we have no place for fear but it has placed for perfect faith and the perfect faith is a master of circumstances but it doesn't mean that the storms will not come the storms will come but what happens allow the master to take control of the situation oh my oh yes they do only his will I will believe that no one can persuade them different they have that says the Lord or they keep silent then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did completely in his days all things when he was here he did not complete and when he was here for it was not yet time so now who are to fulfill that somebody has to fulfill it I pray that I be the one to fulfill it no wonder the prophet said if there is only one person in Calgary let me be the one oh my now let us stand like Joshua and Karen now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background now let us stand like Joshua in the caliph as we see the promised land coming inside it is nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end-time leader to take the church over Cara represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua do we have Joshua do we have Joshua then there must be Academy somewhere let me be the caliph let me let me be the caliph The Pride that stands with Joshua with the message of Joshua let me be the Caleb amen now okay now listen to this now remember they had the power Jesus had given them the power to heal the sick to raise the dead and to cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power now there is the pranam tapanaku there is the church The Pride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't quoted that Faith to move it it takes Faith to move it here I got a shell that I had loaded I think he's talking of a gun I know what it will do by ballistics like the word but it has got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder and the powder has got the power but it has got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing the powder is in the Shell but it needs Faith to charge it and throw it out that is what it takes see perfect Faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now foreign if you say he has given you the power if you say he has given either power now what you need is the faith and how do you get that faith faith comes by hearing and hearing the word so brothers and sisters let us create time to hear the word let us take time let us take time to pack this word because Faith only comes by hearing the word oh my God now the more you surround yourself with the atmosphere of the world the more you gain faith how are we going to advance into the speaking condition the power is here we need the faith and the faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word I hope I'm communicating we need to understand because you just can't go down and say oh I need perfect faith I need he has given us the way how to get it Faith cometh by hearing the word so let's take time there was like there was a clip I think somebody sent me and they they I think there are small kids who are saying oh I thank God for Corona it has it because of because of lockdowns I have more time to read the word I have more time to pray I hope I'm not making fun but it makes sense it limits some other commitments then it creates time to listen to the what even more so as much as all things worketh for good to them that love so it might have come this way but on the other side it has made some people to throw closer to God now we are promised manifested children of God hence we need to make the speaking conditions our Target now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are how faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in myself do nothing but it is my faith in God and God was in him the word met manifest and when the word of God comes in you it made manifest for you as a Believer and as a Believer it is the faith of God that moves in you all that Jesus did was because he was the word and if I become the word then I will do all that is written of me that is not milk if I become the word then I will do all that that is written of me oh my recognize then recognize your position recognizes that you are Revelation 10 you are the one to eat the book hello recognize that you are Revelation 10 7. recognize that you are sent Luke 17 30. recognize that you are America before recognize that you are saying John 14 20. recognize your position Jesus Christ recognized his position because he was the one and we have said you become the word as you eat the word so if you have become the word then recognize your position you can say that's who I am I'm revelation 10. and you can prove it you can say I am Malachi foe how behold I will send you Elijah behold I will send you who me he sent this Elijah to me and I've recognized what Elijah has done in my life this message of Elijah it turns the hearts of the children it changes people if it has not changed you then it is you is the problem these Faith changes people can turn a drunkard into a saint it can turn a prostitute into a saint this faith and that was the purpose of Malachi 4. he was two to two things he was to turn so for you to say that you have been changed then let us see we will cut you are a proof of what Malachi 4 has done but if there is no change you still have time amen recognize your position Jesus Christ recognized his position oh my now don't have time to read all these but in the message the seventh seal from paragraph 284. but I will jump because of time paragraph 285. the prophet says I don't know I can't say did I go to sleep that he's talking about the subpo canyon I don't know or did I go into a trance I don't know was it a vision I can tell you only thing I can say is what just the same thing like them Angels was and it is struck my hand and I looked at it it was a sword and it had pearl handles really pretty and had a guard over it with cold and the plate looked like something like a chrome like silver only it was real shiny and it was so feather edge sharp oh my and I thought isn't that the prettiest thing just fit my hand I thought that's awful pretty but I said hey I am always afraid of things I swore I thought what will I do with that and just then a voice shook down down through there that rocked this The Rock said it is the sword of the king and then I come out of it and that's what the sword of the king now if I if it it is I say it as what over King but it said the sword of the king and there is only one the king and that is God and he has one sword that is his word what have I lived by that so oh so help me God standing over his holy desk here with his holy word laying here it is the word amen oh what a day we are living in what are what are great things see the mystery under the sacred standing there when this left when this left me something just come to me and said Don't Fear now I don't hear no voice like on the inside of me Spock I have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is the third pool fattipoo you remember it congregation says amen he said you have heard so many impersonations on this what you are what you try to explain but said don't even try this you remember it how many remembers that Vision amen why it is all over it stepped and everywhere that's been about six years ago same six seven years ago been seven years ago said don't try to explain that this is the third pool but I'll meet you in there The Voice came from inside the voice of the third pool comes from inside hello it comes from inside so where is the source the word that you have packed inside may God help us oh my The Voice came from inside not outside the third pull comes from inside everything concerning the touch pool will come from inside you you you eat with a sense Superior you hit it with a sense Superior than five senses how will it happen the word that you have packed will rise up oh the promise is that it will not be manifested until the squeeze whatever situations that we are in let us not cry like others but let us rise to recognition that we are the manifested sons of God oh my adoption I'll just jump because of time adoption this is the highest order of the world I expected a very big comment adoption is the highest order of the word manifested songs adoption we are we are adopted children oh my goodness I don't have time to maybe the pastor will pick it up adoption oh my now when Jesus came being the one without without sin he proved it when the winds plowed he said peace be still amen and when the tree when when the tree he said no man eat from thee verily I say unto you you that is little Gods oh my goodness little gods I thought I had the privilege of addressing the little gods are we good that's who we are we doubting do we know who we are do we really know who we are it needs to get to a point where by when you walk you know who you are and when you know who you are even you control the words that you speak because you can cause somebody that will be the end but of course you the father shows you then you speak you only do what the father shows you you are only led by what the father shows you if he says bless that person you place the person oh my now adoption maybe I'll read this okay I have five minutes okay now this may just choke you to death but you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods how many ever note that how many knows that Jesus said so the Bible Jesus said Did You Know Your Law say itself that you are gods and if you call them Gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were caught because they were had full domain over the over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his courtship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Saturn took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again we are waiting for the fullness of time for the manifestations of the children the sons of God and remember the Bible says all creatures are groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God and here are the sons of God when you tell them you are the sons of God they doubt and yet the creature outside there all nature is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God oh my goodness so in adoption is where there is inheritance Pastor do you have time to read for us Genesis chapter 25 I want to finish over there read Genesis 25. I want us to get something Genesis 10 25 5 and 6. read it loud verse 5 and 6. of the concubines which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son while he yet lived Eastward unto the East Country amen unto Isaac Abraham gave him oh that is the inheritance but Unto the Sons of the concupines he gave them gifts and sent them away now what am I trying to say in all the inheritance that Isaac was given gifts were included if we gave him all inside all the gifts who are there but to these other ones the children of the concupines he just gave them gifts and send them away can we bring it to the present world the Pentecostal s they have been given gifts and they are so excited with the gifts but to you our sons of God he has given you the inheritance and is that inheritance it has everything what you only need to do is to exercise your faith let us believe it brothers and sisters we have been given the inheritance you have the inheritance and in that inheritance you have all amen may God help us to know what we have been given that is the power that we have been we have already been given the power we only need a faith but the faith cometh by hearing as I conclude maybe the musicians can come we are talking about the thoughtful five times manifested in the prophet I love this five times the third pool manifested in the prophet first in the little fish the prophet gave it life hello it shows God is concerned even with the small things oh my problem is too big no God is concerned even if it can you imagine the little fish the gift of the third Bull manifested with a small fish he gave it life two he calmed the storms and in all those situations The Voice spoke to him so clear that he knew exactly what he was doing so the the second one he carried the storms the third he spoke with the squirrels into existence the fourth he spoke the healing of sister Meda then the fifth the one that we know salvation to the voice of sister hati five times now in those five times he shows that he's session the small fish he gave it life when the environment was not good he spoke he come to the storm and that's why I started by saying he's here he's here we only need to reach out and touch him we can awaken him he's in the port he's in the pot you can awake him hey Jesus wake up here you have a situation I have a situation I need you to come on the scene wake up where is he he's packed him inside just speak oh my goodness when it comes to comes to no let's bring it to today because we are the manifested sons of God may God help us so if he manifests five times in different situations to show us that in every situation in any situation that we we we we we are confronted with he's there just wake him up let us stand he's here I'm pressing on the upward Way New Heights I'm gaining every day are you gaining Heights every day the more you eat the more Heights you gain every day package eat it eat it the more you eat The More You Buck it the more you pack it and then it is so full then you speak then it comes you speak it out then it comes from inside not outside when it comes from outside we want to hear what people say but when it comes from inside and he speaks to you first then then you take control of the situation he's the master I'm pressing on the upper way brother Paul give us the way thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] I want to live above the world oh Satan starts at me are heard the joyful Sound the song of Saints on Higher Ground Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on air then stable land a higher place [Music] I want to scale the utmost [Music] Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on Heaven's table land a higher place than I have found Lord glad my feet Hallelujah how many enjoyed that tonight certainly wonderful to hear the word being ministered I just had one scripture that just I can't get it out of my mind while he was preaching it just kept coming to me and coming to me so I'm just going to read it and then we'll pray set of Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 very familiar scripture well this is what we were talking about all night to whom God would make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles this mystery many people would say the message of the hour this mystery and yes indeed for a while but when this mystery becomes real when this mystery becomes personal then it becomes Christ in you the hope of glory and that's what we were hearing tonight brothers and sisters this is all about Christ in you the hope of glory not waiting for it to be someday somewhere sometime someone else some other way no way it has to be us right now today it has to be and when that happens when we can say just by faith is what the word says I might think differently I might feel differently other people might say or think or do differently it's irrelevant if you're if you're willing to speak if we're willing to speak the word then God's obligated to back it up tremendous it's bow and prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word thankful for the encouragement Lord Jesus that we could recognize not just something untangible Lord not not just something that's part of an association not not just a denomination not just a fine group of people but Lord to recognize the message of the hour is you in US giving us the ability to recognize exactly that Lord you don't want us to cry you want us to speak father help us to just go to a higher plane help us to pack that word into our soul help us to apply that token to our lives to apply the token to our home to apply your mind in US Lord Jesus your word says let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you oh Father the word we heard from your seventh angel messenger tonight we've heard it so many times Lord but one of these times it's just going to ring true and we're going to look at things just a little differently father I pray that you would Quicken that word to us Lord that we wouldn't be looking for something in the future but we would see it right now as we go forward in our lives that we would be able to say not not just be it unto me

for all the brothers who who bring of their sacred portion and and minister to your Saints Lord Jesus thank you for everyone who is a member of the body the mystical body of Jesus Christ who is willing to come service after service any chance they get whenever the doors are open according to what your Prophet said but it's not because your Prophet said it it's because just like David said something inside of me was just glad when they said unto me let us go unto the house of the Lord there's something that just can't keep us away not even covet father we just love you and we thank you we just ask that you would bless your children tonight father that Lord as we go home and as we go our separate ways as we lay our heads down on our bed that we would consider the words that were spoken tonight that we would consider the thoughts Lord that we would look into the mirror of your word and that it would just occur to us just like the prophet said when he looked in that mirror mama that's me oh Father just let this word become real let it become us father I pray that you would just bless your children tonight Lord go with us as we go our separate ways Quicken the word to our very Souls I pray that's my prayer Lord Jesus that we would recognize where you truly are today father we just love you we thank you we ask that you would just bless each one tonight in Jesus Christ's
