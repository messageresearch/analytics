[Music] [Applause] [Music] stand God bless you this morning welcome to the house of the Lord what a tremendous honor and privilege it is to gather together with each one but most of all to gather together with the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in our midst we have a few prayer requests we'd like to bring before the church this morning um but first exactly the way that I'd like to do it every single time we've got a praise report sister Stella sister Stella wants to bring a praise report and she took the time to write it out as a pray a prayer request but she would like to bring the praise report to bring Thanksgiving to the Lord for protecting everyone that traveled to attend her nephew's wedding in Nigeria and you know when we look at it from a Canadian perspective it can seem like just a natural thing we jump in the car and we go to a wedding and then we jump in the car and we drive back home and that's not a big deal maybe we'll get a flat tire and maybe we'll have a an issue but when we're talking about different countries we have a lot of different issues and clearly this is a hand of Lord she said one of the people that traveled could not be contacted for 3 days but by the grace of the god the person was eventually got to their destination and we know here if someone just disappeared for 3 days it would be a big deal it's no different there but they made it to their destination his angel are encamped about those who fear Him in appreciation of all that God did sister Stella took the time and she brought some snacks and drinks for everyone this is a big deal for sister Stella I thought maybe when I read this there' be some crackers and maybe a little bit of something there but when you go downstairs into the kitchen after service if you leave here hungry it's your own fault sister Stella brought a feast praise the Lord you know I just can't help but think this is probably one of those unspoken requests that sister Stella brings Faithfully every single prayer meeting and that's not when Sunday or Wednesday it's on the Thursday that we actually have prayer meetings sister Stella has uh uh a regular attendance there we know that God answers prayer thank the Lord for touching brother Jeff pagee this morning he had a rough week feeling sick but his desire was to be in fellowship with the Lord this morning God bless you brother you know many times when we don't feel like it in our flesh that's the time to do it Satan wants us not to worship to say it's not the way that I'm used to so I can't do it that way you know what that's when God wants you to worship sister Mary Janette has a request for her daughter sister Carol melis in in Colombia we just want to remember her continue to uphold Mary Janette and her family entirely sister Rebecca odene will be traveling to Legos Nigeria this week we want to remember our sister for traveling mercies as well if you have a need this morning just make it known unto the Lord with an uplift hand as

and the concern Lord Jesus for one another Lord to remember one another and uphold one another in prayer father as a body should father we thank you for touching brother Jeff Lord to give him the strength and the courage to not be sick today but to come to service father we pray that you would just honor his faith Lord bless him H hundredfold Lord Jesus beyond all he could ask or think father

Fisher and a queen family hereen to be serving the lord in this uh in this church amen uh we know what the prophet of God said uh when the church is open amen let us go there serve the Lord with reverence amen don't miss church prophet of God said you can miss your work miss everything but do not miss church and uh because to church to not only to Worship the Lord but also we are told by the message of the hour to support the cause with your presence your ties and offering not because not because God needs or wants our money but if you read in the Bible Tidings and offerings are part of worship it's part of worship God said in the Old Testament do not appear before me empty handed amen that's what the word of God said not because God needs money or he wants money but he wants to see what's in us right titing was not a command remember Abraham was the one who gave ties right God did not command him to pay ties it was from the bottom of Abraham that he gave his ties he did not receive any Commandments of Lord it is by Revelation amen and tiing is Holy unto the Lord am because it is part of worship we don't don't give money to be blessed we don't give money to be blessed in return give our money as part of worship amen even if he does not give us money even if he lets us suffer it's still good for us he's teaching us not to trust in money amen but to trust in his grace and mercy but God is uh full of grace and mercy he said I will never leave you nor forsake you till the end of the world am amen as a father and a mother that pth his children we take care of our children amen we work so that they have food in the table yes sir amen amen and that's the way our God treated us more than that amen so if we just uh believe and trust him everything will be all right amen amen can you say Amen to that amen amen praise the Lord so uh this morning I would like to say that in studying the Bible in studying this holy Bible we need to realize or understand that the Holy Bible Bible was written or presented in many ways one of them is literally literally means it's easy to understand it's a command not to kill not to steal those things are literal it's easy to understand right but the Bible is not all literal the Bible is also spiritual it's also written in figure of speech like Eve ate the fruit it's not a literal right it's a figure of speech and in some parts it's written in typology like the two birds the male and the female god commanded Moses and the priest to kill the male bird and pour the blood on the female and then let the female Bird Go free it has no explanation yes but the prophet of God told us that the male bird is Jesus Christ who died at Calvary and his blood was poured upon the maale bird the church the Bride of Jesus Christ and she was set free amen then the Bible was also written symbolically like the dragons the Cal the eagle and those things they are written in symbols it's hard to understand those things and the Bible is written in Parables Jesus spoke in Parables and some of his disciples said why are you always speaking in Parables the people don't understand you and Jesus our lord said it's not for them to understand I heed it my message I heed it so that they won't understand it belongs to you amenallah and then the Bible was also read written in dark sayings it's so dark hard to understand and then it was also written in Mysteries that's why this Holy Bible is full of mysteries you can read and read and read and go to school and Seminary go to all the seminaries of the world and still you will not comprehend and understand these Mysteries because those Mysteries they are revealed only to one channel amen and that's the office of the Prophet amen and we thank God because he has sent a prophet Amen to reveal these Mysteries that are so hard to understand amen and then then the Holy Bible was also written in deep teachings they are so deep if you can only you only enjoy swimming on top of the ocean and then you don't want to go deep you will you will not see how beautiful under the ocean amen of course the ocean and the shore are beautiful it is enough for them who just want to stay there but some people they're not content on the shore they learn is scuba diving because they want to see what's under that surface the same thing with the word of God hallelujah amen amen amen there are simple things there are literal things there are shallow things but we know the Bible speaks of deep things of God too amen Deep Thoughts deep things means deep thoughts of God Amen and God wants us to go inside of what he has in his mind before the foundation of the world amenallah and those deep thoughts of God they are everything is good is thinking good for us amen amen now some parts of the Bible they are not written but it doesn't mean that it's not the truth it doesn't mean that it's not part of the word of God because it's not written in the Bible amen remember Revelation 10 1:4 the message and the voices of the seven tunders the prophet of God said they're not written in the Bible that's right you can read and read and read and pray and fast it's not there amen it cannot be understood by prayer and fasting many people they pray and fast to understand the Bible but they still don't understand till nowen those Unwritten they are part of God's word amen he decided not to write them in the Bible so that's why when we speak about the word of God the truth of God there are is still truth yes though they may not be written in the Bible amen amen like the seven Thunders and Revelation 81 it's totally silent L not literal not spiritual not symbolical not typologically not in Parables not in symbols totally silent amen but at the back of that silence there is a great mystery message amen he amen for the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah everybody say praise the Lord the Lord thank you Jesus Psalms 92: 5-6 oh Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep amen amen a bruist man know it not neither do a fool understand this second Peter 3:16 as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of those of these things in which are some things hard to be understood amen which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction see this Bible can destroy you if you don't have amen the revelation of it amen it is very dangerous to preach this Bible without Revelation it can kill you it can kill people that listens to you amen if you are not Guided by the Holy Spirit and the Revelation that God gave to his servant brother Bram the prophet you are just killing people amen you are sending more people to Hell than to Heaven that's why it's very scary brothers and sisters to stand behind this Pulpit to speak your own thoughts amen amen we have received the written word of God we have received the spoken word of God hallelujah the message of God came to the prophet and that's what we need to preach to the people hallelujah not my own thoughts amen amen see not my education I don't have a good UC education amen I'm only a high school level and English is not my

Hallelujah he shall teach you oh all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so it's not something that we want to think about it's not something that we want

faithful to what was given to us amen we cannot add anymore we cannot diminish anymore it's already there it's complete and the purpose of the baptism of the holy spirit is to bring our remembrance back Hallelujah to what he said and not only to what he said but to what yes the things that are to be amen praise the Lord glory to Jesus Now 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 9 10 and 13 it says but we speak the wisdom of God Amen in a mystery amen that's deep even the hidden wisdom of God which God ordained before the world unto our glory amen see these messages they're not for head knowledge God wants to glorify us hallelujah and the prophet of God said we are now living in a glorified State amen we are now living in a glorified State we are now sitting in Heavenly places because of this message that he has given us amen but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man amen the things which God had prepared for them that love him Hallelujah verse 10 but God ha revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yeah the Deep things of God 13 we which things also we speak not in the words of man's Wisdom which man's Wisdom teach it but the Holy Ghost teacheth amen comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord John 1612 to13 I have yet many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now see but when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Tru for he shall not speak of himself amen amen but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now but how will the Holy Spirit revealed this deep things we know we need to know the channels of God Ephesians 5 Ephesians 3: 3-5 how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery this is Paul is speaking as I wrote a four in few words whereby when you read he may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ am amen which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men Old Testament prophets right as it is now revealed unto his Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit those are the channels of God brothers and sisters amen amen now you can hear the message it's in the UPS now you can read but you will not be perfected without the fful ministry amen Perfection comes through Malachi 45 and6 and Revelation 107 and then Malachi 4:56 and Revelation 107 produces Ephesians 4:11 amen and then Ephesians 41 produces a perfect Church hallelujah amen that's why you cannot stay home amen you have to go to church and fellowship for the Perfection of your faith amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his son servants the prophet am see the channel that's right this is the channel of God today Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel amen which was manifested in the life of his Prophet brother William Mario Bram an exposition of the seven Church Ages part nine the loud isian church ages this is what the prophet of God said now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers amen that's us that's right we are the children that's right and and our faith will be turned back to the faith and doctrines and teachings of the apostolic fathers that's right and then two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 1-4 which are the revelations contained yes sir in the seven seal you believe that I believe that brothers and sisters amen there are many Thunders doctrines today in the world confusing the churches I only believe I only believe in the Thunders that God revealed to his Prophet I heard many thunders in these last days but I'm only faithful and loyal to these seven Thunders that God revealed to his Prophet father brother I don't listen to any Thunders that people explains in this last days except what his Prophet said it will be this divinely true revealed mystery truths that literally literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers blessed be the name of the Lord brothers and sisters amen prophet of God said in the 7th seal 1963 paragraph 413 now The Vision Plus the word right plus the history plus the seven Church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is th he the Lord hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of Jesus amen that's right amen amen God is good to us brothers and sisters what is the seventh seal then what is the seventh seal the lamb soul that Souls that are in prison 1963 and thank you for the it Oh I thought uh sorry thank you for the support last time they were posting the quotation but you know thank you so much for that you can do that be nice if you can read also what I'm reading right but anyway it's okay the lamb took his book when the seven seal just ready for it to be open The Sixth Seal remember he hid the seventh seal from us he would not do it when the angel stood day by day telling it but then he would not do it on that one set there is silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the Lord amen what is the seven seal it is the coming of the Lord hallelujah blessed be the name of Jesus glory amen feish of the trumpets 1964 264 look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this don't miss this the prophet of God said how striking from the seven angels close parenthesis messenger of the seventh seal so there is a messenger of the seven SE Amen to reve what was hidden behind that seal amen amen amen message in Revelation 10 was the seven seal to the seven trumpets oh God how can we say this to make the people see it this is not just make up friends this is the say the Lord the scripture and at the same time now as soon as this church the bride is drawed together she is taken up and that mystery of the seven seal or the seventh seal the mystery not only of the coming but the going yes sir up of the Bride brothers and sisters amen amen now to understand this when did the seventh seal coming of Christ started amen when did it started the seven s if it was the coming of the Lord what did the prophet of God said the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals in 63 the prophet of God said in paragraph 2 1 12 remember it comes at the seventh Church age when the mysteries of God will be opened up now watch real clothes this is something you must get now he had been doing his mediatorial work making intercessions for the believer for 2,000 years he had been back there a lamb now he is stepping forth from eternity to take that title dided book amen and to break the seals and reveal the Mysteries when of it at the end time do you get it amen yes now break the seals and release all the Mysteries to them to the seventh angel amen whose message is to reveal all the mysteries of God the mysteries of God lays in this Seven Seals amen that's what he said here all the Mysteries lays in the Seven Seals another message of the prophet of God the bridge between the seven Church ages again this is what he said the reason I'm reading all these codes because I do not want to add my own touch here it's very dangerous to add your own thoughts here see the prophet of God warn us when we preach about the seven seal not to add our own thoughts it's already there and that's the the purpose of bringing this quates together so that by the revelation of God to the prophet and to you as you listen to these Mysteries God will also reveal it while you're listening to this m all right paragraph 41 and when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down comes see that seven seal brothers and sisters when the seals are broke amen when were the seals were broke February 28 1963 right right is that correct when the seven angels from heaven in pyramid constellation appeared to the prophet and after appearing to the prophet they went back to heaven and formed the mystery Cloud the head of Christ is that clear brothers and sisters amen now I did not add my onos there that's what the prophet of God said there shields were broke from the seven angels in pyramid conciliation that came to brother Ram sir and broke the Seven Seals to him that was in 1963 right and after that encounter what did the prophet of God said the seven angels went back as past as they go to heaven and formed the mystery Cloud that was featured in Life magazine May 17 1963 brothers and sisters is that correct amen to God be the glory amen are you still here brothers and sisters thank you amen amen I'm trying to be slow see sometimes I preach fast but I'm trying to be slow because these are very important things to be understood brother and sisters thank you Jesus just as John was giving his message the same time that Messiah come in the days John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce himall and we realize that in the scriptures over in Malachi 4 there is one to be one like John an Elijah to whom whom the word of God can come to and he is to reveal by the Holy Spirit whole the mysteries of God and restore the faith to the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers restore back all these Mysteries that's been proved at amen through this denominational years now that's what the word said I'm just responsible for what it said it's written is right that's what it is and we see that this seven seal book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God it's the book where the names are written under every seal glory glory and every revealing of that seal from first seal to seven seal seventh seal is the calling of the Bride in it CH that's why the prophet of God is the messenger of that seven seal yes sir and we are the names brothers and sisters under that seven seal when it was opened it called up [Applause] amen blessed be the name of Jesus hallelujah amen to God be the glory paragraph 45 now all the Mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger here is the angel on Earth and another angel Mighty messenger come down this Angel was an Earthly Revelation 10:7 Earthly messenger But Here Comes one down from heaven a rainbow Covenant who it is see only Christ it could be just exactly like was in Revelation first chapter standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick with a rainbow to look upon as Jasper and sardia stone and then he returns back in the 10th chapter after the coming time that all the Mysteries is to be finished and the seals are to be broke and proclaiming that it's time is no more and he said when the seventh angel begin has begin to sound then the mystery should be finished and time for the angel capital A to [Music] appear That's why brother bam said the coming of the Lord is in twofold appearing in the Spirit form in the mighty Angel form and then the coming what is the coming the visible Corporal coming of our Lord and Jesus Christ to take his bride with him but right now he is here he appeared in the mighty Angel brother brother said amen that's the S seal brothers and [Applause] sisters you believe that that's what the prophet of God said Hallelujah Revelation 10 1-4 is the seventh seal brothers and sisters the beginning amen amen that's what the prophet of God said amen the appearing of Christ now where is the corporal Body of Christ many people said Mercy is over in 1963 they said Christ already stood up from the throne of grace it's now Throne of judgment some people believe that I only believe what the prophet of God Amen I don't care what they say amen I only listen am to God's Prophet amen stay with the prophet stay with the messeng and you will never be deceived people are being deceived because they listen to many voices outside the prophet amen don't listen to other voices just listen to what God has said to his servant you will be saved Hallelujah stay there be faithful brother amen don't add anything Hallelujah Abraham 1956 well now Jesus went up into heaven his body Corporal body that's the body he lived in it's all scarred and bruised for our sins and for our sickness and it sets on the throne of God and the spirit that was upon him has come back to the Earth and it dwells among the people listen to this and Jesus amen sent brother Bram here to help you to believe on [Music] him can you say Amen brothers and sisters Hallelujah glory to God Amen 1964 when their eyes were opened they knew him now his Corporal body physical body sets on the throne of God he took set down on the throne of God but the holy spirit is here which is Christ in spirit form you see the appearing of Christ brothers and sisters amen Revelation 10 1-4 is the appearing of Christ that's part of the seven s brothers and sisters amen I believe the Holy Spirit wants us to understand what was in the mind of God for these things he don't want us to be ignorant and innocent amen of what we believe amen he has opened the eyes of our understanding so that we are not blind Hallelujah we know Hallelujah where we came from amen we know what we are now am and we know where we are going brothers and SS because God's word is a light unto our path brothers and sisters amen how long shall his Corporal body remain Seated on the throne the first seal 1963 please listen to this my brothers and sisters because many people already concluded he's not there anymore now the lamb in the time of intercessory back here he knew that there were names in there that was put in there from the foundation of the world and as long as them names have never been manifested on Earth as yet he had to stay there as intercessor do you get it Prophet asked perfectly predestination see all right he had to stay that because he came to die for those that God had ordained to eternal life see see by his for knowledge he showed them not by his own will his will was that none should perish but by his for knowledge he knew who would and who would not amen therefore as long as there was one name had not never had yet been declared in Earth Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name brothers and sisters Hallelujah but as soon as that final name had been splashed in that clono or Blitz then his intercessory day was over let him that's filthy be filthy still let him that's holy is Holy still see and he leaves the sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment seat woe unto those outside of Christ then he's still there brother waiting for you amen they still there waiting for you to forgive your CH your sins to change you Amen to fill you with the Holy Spirit still there waiting for that last name last final name he has not stood up yet the Throne of Mercy is still Throne of Mercy it's not a throne of judgment yet brothers and sisters amen hallelujah everybody say praise the Lord prise the Lord amen glory to Jesus amen that's why on February 28 1963 over in Arizona USA a constellation of seven angels appeared to a man named William maram Bram in the form of a ring shaped cloud this Seven Angels Came From the presence of God Amen revealing to him the Hidden Mysteries that were sealed in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation see that's the appearing of Christ that's Revelation 101 to4 the mighty angel said now Ephesians 5:4 wherefore he sayith awake thou that is sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light this is not talking about the physical body this is talking about the spiritual resurrection of the believer brothers and sisters and this spiritual Resurrection will take place under the seventh seal because the seventh seal brothers and sisters it is our Easter seal Easter means Resurrection here the opening of this seventh SE is to resurrect the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is sleeping from the dead denominations organizations Creeds and dogmas of men amen that's why the prophet of God said the true Easter seal 1961 Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby your Shield until the day of your Redemption that's the genuine true Easter seal amen shows that sin has been paid for for you God has accepted you and you are sealed into Christ by the Holy Ghost sin is finished unbelief is finished you have perfect Faith now you believe all things that the word has spoken the Eternal seal has been finished now we are resurrected today amen why can we have such a time over the things of God because we are resurrected yeah Those whom he fornew he called those who he called he justified those who he justified he have glorified then we are now Resurrected we are resurrected From the Inside Out not from the outside in that's different but from the inside out the prophet of God said oh do you notice not sealed out this way but sealed in oh my if the church could just see it we're not sealed out were sealed in Hallelujah When sin was Abomination before God and there was no appropriation take it away we were sealed away from it now when that ripped into two and that seal was broke by a sin offering being made from us amen now we're baptized inside and sealed inside am we are resurrected we are now resurrected already resurrected how do you know the Bible said so we are now resurrected we are now raised with him in spiritual Resurrection hallelujah what does the word quickened means Quicken means Resurrection that's right we are already Resurrected right now sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus enjoying the Easter seal what is that Easter seal the resurrection seal under the seven seal am God called us from the dead brothers and sisters amen that's God's true Easter seal amen how are we by one one Spirit of Tiz into the body and sealed eternally amen we are now raised spiritually what did we raise from from a life of sin yes we were one Sinners and love the things of the world how many resurrected sin are here this morning amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen amen now the prophet of God said the six seal was in threefold in the message the 7th seal 1963 now we find out 38 87 also in this that the six seal now being open it was for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes first the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification that's the first fold of the sick seal she had to be purged out of her sin of unbelief and rejecting this message she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between the six and the seventh chapter here she had been purged she had been given her robe now she is not the bride but it's the church the pure people that did not have the opportunity maybe to receive the message amen or in some way they were blinded by this false prophets and they did not get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart and God knows their heart and here they are pged during this time second fold Parra 389 you notice another purging time that's for Israel when she gathers that's the second fault God purged Israel in the tribulation period out of the millions that will gather there there will be a selected 144,000 and they will be purged also God is purging Israel third 390 now not notice there is a whole earth is to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged see what it is the Earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the Millennium is coming up and see every everything that's got any filth it is to be purged during the six that's the three-fold of the six seal that the prophet of God said brother amen what about the seventh seal is is it also in threefold let us see what the prophet of God said 7 seal 1963 paragraph 300 and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today of God said amen you say Amen are you still there brothers and sisters the seven the seven seal is also in rold amen amen and the prophet of God said it the first was unfolded today meaning today it was revealed to the prophet and then he said and the other one he said the one unfolded today or yesterday but the other one unfolded today Hallelujah can you say praise the Lord the Lord see the seven seal the prophet of God said it was the first one was unfolded yesterday and the other one was unfolded today oh wow praise the Lord amen let's continue brothers and sisters and there's one thing that I see cannot interpret because it's an unknown language the third one but I stand right there and look right straight at it listen to this church and this is the third pool coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent am now I better stop right here amen I just fill check not to say no more about it amen that's the third part where B said I better not say about it anymore amen but the first fold it was unfolded to the prophet the second fold it was unfolded but the third better not say about it but I'm looking straight amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen oh God hallelujah are you still there brothers and sisters I'm not yet finished please bear patience with me I don't want to go home for part three and that will be next year my brothers and sisters I want to finish this this series now amen hallelujah thank you when will the other fold the third fold will be revealed the seven seal 1963 listen to this church paragraph 399 and here when the seventh seal when he opened it he also omitted it again so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for the mystery to be known not this time therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be Hallelujah known when right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again for his bride or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let's just all pray live good straight Christian Life lives looking forward for his coming Hallelujah you say praise the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus amen now what is the first F how many wants to know the first fold of the seven seale everybody wants to know thank you okay thank you give me more time let's just think we are now sitting in Heavenly places in eternity forget about time for a while amen don't worry about your lunch yet I know Canadians you have plenty of food waiting at your refrigerators so don't worry amen amen and there's a lot of places to buy food amen that's why my stomach is filled with heal do you call that the coffee Tim Horton's Coffee amen I hope there's Tim Horton in in the Philippines in my place I begin to love it now amen hallelujah thank you Jesus everybody say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus God be the glor story amen now let's go to the first world that was unfolded the prophet of God said a seven seal okay 7 SE 1963 now do you notice on the opening of this seventh seal it's also in a three-fold mystery this one I have will speak and have spoke that it is the mystery of the seven canders amen the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery amen first fold the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it will be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew when he would return let's continue to paragraph 393 and there will be a seven voices of these standers that will reveal the great Revelation at that time I believe to us if we don't know it it won't be know till that time but it will be revealed in that day amen in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God Amen serve him and do all that we we know how to do and live good Christian lives here now we find that the Sixth Seal has been open to us we see it and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrived paragraph 394 and there was some reason that God let these seven voices be thundered because it must come we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened that seven seal you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it it right along with what he said no one would know his coming right they also would not know about this seven Thunder mystery right so you see it's connected together the seventh seal and the Seven Thunders the prophet of God said it's connected together and the first fold of the seven seal unfolded into the seven tunders so the prophet of God said brothers and sisters you don't want to add anything we just presented you the coach see yes 395 that much we have an understanding of it today because the rest of it it is all [Music] unfolded but this is not unfolded but sitting in my room I heard this not heard it rather but s it unfold to the seven Thunders now that's as far as we can go right there now I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do that which is right love him all your life serve him and God will take care of the rest am we have in the completion here now by the grace of God all the mysteries of the six seals that's been sealed up and we understand and know here that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public now he's coming at the hour of his coming when the destruction of the earth you know he said there what will be the sign of the coming of the end of the world Matthew 24 they asked him what question that question he went down to that told about Israel being gathered as a nation that first verse of Matthew 24:31 but then he started off on The Parables you see learn the parable of the Fig Tree when you see it putting forth its BDS while you know Springs is nigh and then when you see this coming to pass then you know the time is nigh Israel gathering in its own Homeland but you notice he omitted the revelation of this seven SE now is this the sign of the end sir 1962 I was about to write when I Heard a Voice from Heaven amen saying unto me seal capital S seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered right them not amen see that's one of the greatest truths it's not written in the Bible amen amen God purposely did that amen it's not for everyone one it's not for the whole Christianity amen it's for his chosen bride there are some things that you only reveal to your wife into your husband nobody knows even your sons your family don't know about it it's a secret right amen that only belongs to your wife and husband same thing here Jesus Christ hiding this truths is only for his beloved wife the Bride of the the Lord Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen brothers and sisters now listen to this always prophet of God said the seven seal is connected to the seven Thunders first fold right and that's why the prophet of God said when the first seal was open what did we hear there was a thunder and this is what the prophet of God said I'm asking you the question it blasted with thunder amen when this voice rang out did you notice when the seven seal that follow the seven Church ages when the first seal was open there was a thunder the first seals in the book was open there was a thunder would not this first of the outside book open the same way God doesn't change his program right amen I saw in the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of a thunder and one of the VOR said come and see and there were never was another Thunder and the last seal was open there was a space in heaven for half an hour of Silence but the first sail was open there was a blast of Thunder amen oh Church could it be are we that far friends think maybe I hope it is not but what if it is what was that blast and before God this Open Bible I line not blast and shook the Earth and when the first seal of the seven that was open in the Bible it came forth just one but a blast that shook the whole thing a thunder then if the seals On The Backs side would open would not it be a thunder to I don't know I can say the prophet of amen amen you don't want to PL anything here I'm just reading you what the prophet of God said I don't want to put any interpretation or conclusion to this this quotes came from the mouth of the prophet and made the Holy Spirit give us Revelation am is this the sign of the answer 3:49 there was a thunder the first seal and the seal was a thunder many people today looking for seven men for the seven Thunders amen see this enough brothers and sisters there are no seven men coming to rebild the Thunders don't wait for that if they are coming they are Impostors amen they are impersonations they are Janis and jambes in this last days amen right hallelujah amen are we still here brothers and sisters amen amen thank you let us continue Now message is this the sign of the answer now look paragraph 342 when it's time for the seven voices then it's time for the seven voices when the book is completed of Revelation 10 to be revealed now notice listen the seven voices was Thunders blessed God help us if I'm wrong Lord forgive me I'm asking you the question it blasted with Thunder and the voice rang out did you notice when the Seven Seals that follow the seven Church ages when the first seal was open there was a thunder the first seals in the book was open there was a thunder would not this first seal of the outside book open the same way God doesn't change his program amen let's turn to Revelation 6 and I saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of a thunder and one of the four Beast say come and SE there was never another Thunder and the last seed was open there was space in heaven forh an hour of Silence but the first seal was open there was a blast of thunder and when the first seal the seven of the seven that was open in the Bible it came forth just one but a blast that shook the whole thing a thunder then if the seals that's on the backside would open would not it be a thunder to there was a thunder the first seal and the seal was a thunder now I know we have read that but was repeated again there's a purpose for that remember the constellation of the visions of angels when I left here to go to Arizona you remember what time is it s you remember that notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appeared one burst of thunder seven angels appeared so when the lamb had opened the first seal and I heard was the voice of a thunder and one of the poor be say coming see notice one Thunder seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day this see what I mean so have you noticed the mysterious part of this week that's what it is that's what's been it's not a human being a man it has been the inels of the Lord that's why the prophet of God said seven angels hold the mystery of these seven Thunders amen see God hiding in simplicity City 196 listen to this church please bear patience with me now seven and I believe that the seven angels came down from heaven in the pyramid constellation I believe that the seven angels who hold these seven Thunders amen will granted amen amen amen it's that clear brothers and sisters Hallelujah the 7eventh seal 1963 listen to this brothers and sisters please I just know that those seven tunders holds that mystery amen hallelujah the heavens was quiet amen praise the Lord hallelujah see the seventh seal brothers and sisters the half hour of silence was connected to the seven Thunders that unfolded am amen first fold that God revealed to his servant the prophet amen amen to God be praised to God be the glory you now we are now beginning to understand this mystery brothers and sisters amen amen now the people are still confused what the seven Thunders are till this time what did the prophet of God said about the seven Thunders amen do you want to hear what the prophet of God said about the seven Thunders brothers and sisters yes sir let me get to it before I go to the second fault Hallelujah of the seven SE amen are we still here brothers and sisters thank you okay the seven Thunders what are they amen there are so many interpretation today but this is what the prophet of God said I don't have an interpretation to this amen I only saw what God revealed to his Prophet amen amen question and answer 1964 1964 the prophet was asked paragraph 395 have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet not known to us the Thunder the question to the prophet and this is the answer of the Prophet paragraph 78 no they were revealed in the Seven [Music] Seals that's what the Thunders was about amen amen say Amen brothers and sisters amen hallelujah they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices no one could make it out but what it was John knew what it was amen it was forbidden to write but he said but the seventh angel Hallelujah in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders amen would be rebuild brothers and sisters and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seven Church age amen and it is also the messenger of the seven seal brothers and sisters God be praised to God be the glory amen amen hallelujah another quotation 1964 unveiling of God hallelujah paragraph 277 he said well then them seven Thunders you see would not them seven Thunders blasting out would would won't that be a revelation be given to some man Heen I said prophet of God said no sir so don't wait for seven Thunders men anymore it's not a revelation to be given to some man the prophet of God said no sir it would be adding something when you believe in seven Thunders men coming it would be adding to the word of God it would be adding something to it or taking something from it 279 each all revealed in there and the Seven Seals open up the revelation of what that was that's what it wasall still in the word you see you cannot get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will leave never leave the word it will stay right with the word amen blinding some amen and Open the Eyes of fathers it will always do that oh my brothers and sisters exposition of the seven Church ages I we already read that let's go let's move on what is the first fold Brothers and Sisters of the seven seal that was unfolded seven Thunders what will the seven Thunders produced this is what the prophet of God said the first seale 1963 then there is coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's all and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got right now we would not be able to do it there is something we've got to step further we can have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly amen amen it's what the prophet of God said sir this is the time of the the end 1962 but this one did not come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven Thunders throw their voices out what if it's something to let us know to enter into the rapturing faith is it will we run and leap over walls and there is something fixing to happen These Old marred Vile bodies are going to be changed can I live to see it Lord is it so so close that I'll see it is this the generation sir my brethren what time is it where are we at I believe everybody understand the first fault of that seven s amen amen now what is the second fold that seven seal because the prophet of God said it was unfolded to him yesterday the first fold and today he said the second fold but the third was total secret amen amen do we want to hear the second B brothers and sisters now the Prophet spoke about the third pool how many believes that Prophet spoke about the third pool Look Away to Jesus 1963 this is what he said and everyone knows that for as a certain as the first was identified the first P was identified amen yes and that was the seven Thunders and the prophet of God said so has the second being identified amen everybody say praise the Lord amen glory to God God be the glory amen and if you think real closely you who are spiritual as the Bible said here is to him that has wisdom the third is properly identified we know where it is so the third poll is here hallelujah now remember brother Brenham the third pool was manifested in the life of brother Ram right God spoke to brother Ram about the third full in Sabino Canyon the king sword right and the voice said this is the third pool what is the first pull healing what is the second pool prophesying and discernment what is the third pool prophet of God put it in three amen stages one thir p is the opening and revealing of the word second he said that it is speaking the word into existence right third the prophet of God said it is preaching to the Lost amen amen you can still follow me brothers and sisters yeah know it's going deep ask for the Holy Spirit to give you breath you know it's it's it's going deep and deep you know but I believe the holy spirit will make you understand amen because it's been written sir it's been written in the word the bride can follow we have the mind of Christ Hallelujah we are the wise virgins now the prophet of God said that the seven seal he said Souls that are in prison now I'm trying to come to this second fold now brothers and sisters and after this I'm going to close but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed with Christ the last member has been redeemed the six seal was produced has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claim what he owned what he had redeem that's right amen each all we is been the third po am seven said it's the third pool amen can you say Amen brother see we can see clearly the second fold how it was unfolded to the prophet and he spoke of it now it is unfolded to the bride amen amen amen that ought to make a shout amen and stand up and praise the Lord hallelujah blessed be the name of Jesus again let me repeat this third poll has three manifestation one opening of the word all the Mysteries will be revealed everything everything am no more Mysteries hidden to the bride that's the third poll secondly speaking the word in to existence amen third the prophet of God said it's going to be preaching to the lost people that will not listen anymore to the preaching of the word amen they are heading to hell and there's no stopping for them blessed be the name of the Lord all right now the third pool is manifested in three ways now don't you know that the third po was manifested in the ministry of his Prophet too amen five times the third poll was manifested in the ministry of brother Bram what are these five things that's part of the third poll that was manifested in brother bram's Life Ministry while we still there brothers and sisters June 1957 third poll the prophet spoke live back to a dead fish how many read that story that's under the dirt poool October 1959 the prophet spoke squirrels into existence out of nowhere November 7 1959 hati right visitation amen who of her sons was convicted by the holy spirit amen hallelujah fourth October 1963 the prophet spoke to the storm to stop and it stopped brothers and [Music] sisters five it spoke healing from his wife that Tom more was healed P times the third pool was manifested byams now if you notice those five manifestation based on that experience based on what the prophet of God experience from the third poll he can Speak Life from dead things to it can speak things into existence third it can make things happen convict your children your family members what of this day amen the prophet of God said you can speak limbs into existence from that third manifestation forth the third po can interrupt nature five it will speak healing and miracles that's the power brothers and sisters that was manifested in B and the prophet of God said why that he had experiened is only temporal to what's coming in the last days to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah blessed be the name of Jesus brothers and sisters hallelujah amen and the prophet of God said we have that power now now Hallelujah everybody say praise the Lord the Lord ever present water from the rock see it's already in there that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law everything here is controlled by a law amen when you speed up there it's controlled by the law you cannot go 150 or 160 everything here is controlled by the law so you're limited and there's power within us according to the prophet it's in there but it is controlled by a law what kind of law and the law is not keeping abundance of Commandments each shallow of Faith am all things are possible to them that believe he amen but the prophet of God said as much as your faith that's all you can release power right ever presentent water 1961 again he said as much as your faith will be release that's how much power you can have amen because in you dwells power Amen to make heavens and earth amen God dwells in you amen you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen there you are but it's your faith Jesus said according to your faith be it unto you if thou can believe all things are possible amen amen hallelujah that's the kind of people ought we to be having faith in this great redeeming Christ that lives in US amen hallelujah glory to Jesus now how are we going to express this third P it's already there but how are you going to express it brother Bram said the law of faith that controls that third pool amen if you have enough faith that third pull will be manifested notice me no mistakes his sinless nature Express God's word and the only way that you will be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it and act behind you you you will have to have that sinless nature that come from God before the foundation of the world he was re recogniz with him before the word can express itself through you it takes a sinless nature to do that God help us amen amen so that's what the prophet of God said can manifest it with a sinful nature and full of unbelief amen praise the Lord if you want to see the third pool the prophet of God said and that takes all of us yes humble thyself 1963 that takes all of us not just individual all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrongs and pray and believe God for this thing things God help me to be humble amen blessed be the name of Jesus glory glory to God Amen the prophet of God said paragraph 75 God can only operate as we let him operate amen you know people want Power really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking humble yourself before God then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to coner not the world yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him yes that's really power show me a church that's a humble real humble not a arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God is it that's right that's the thing it takes yes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us hallelujah everybody say praise to Lord the Lord amen but what will trigger this third pool Ministry to the bride this is what the prophet of God said 5 seal 1963 amen paragraph 38 so now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long or at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third po has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there will never be an impersonation of that it can be it cannot be impersonated amen no jalice and jress can impersonate the third pole that's what the proph of God said amen it cannot be impersonated it lays beyond your heart and it will come out one of this day no man can impersonate amen that's what the prophet of God said amen amen now remember there will never be an impersonation of that it can be it cannot be now it's inexistent Amen oh my Hallelujah I am one of this amen right at this time now it just happened so it could identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this counil begins to tighten up and when it does yes when that does that's right the Pentecostal and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when the time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you have seen temporarily in the ministry of brother Bram be manifested in the p of its power praise be to God hallelujah amen blessed be the name of Jesus Oh hallelujah what a message we have received brothers and sisters hallelujah it's very clear brothers and sisters oh my this message Hallelujah glory to God amen glory to Jesus hallu
