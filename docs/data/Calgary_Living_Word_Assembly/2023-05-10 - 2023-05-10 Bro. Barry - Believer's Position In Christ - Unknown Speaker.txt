perfect word Lord and our minds can't hardly wrap around the significance of how perfect your word really is Lord Jesus but tonight we just ask that you would help us to take another step father one step closer to you to that Perfection that you declared that we need to be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect father we pray that you would just allow us to take one more step towards you father towards that Perfection knowing that there's nothing that we can do except for accept that word tonight when it comes we just ask that you would be glorified now in every aspect of this service Lord we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen thank you musicians it's again so wonderful to have the gifts in the body just like to turn to the book of Ephesians tonight once again talk about our position just from a little bit of a different angle I believe the Lord was real good to me showed me a little bit of a direction here with this and it's beautiful when he does that Ephesians chapter one tonight remember brother Branham said the book of Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua but not just parallels it it perfectly parallels the Book of Joshua as the children of Israel were being positionally placed brought into the promised land all of the years of the promise was given you know they find themselves now there came a day where they were actually going forwards where the word of God was going across that Jordan River and that meant the the difference between life and death that was the difference between being in Perfection according to the word or still being stuck in the wilderness tonight I just want to read one scripture out of Ephesians chapter 1. verse 1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus I believe he's speaking to you and I tonight let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word we know that it's the only thing that we'll endure father we just pray that you would take this word that we've spoken now father just one scripture and that you would just break it open father Lord that it would just bless our our hearts father and our minds and our souls Lord that it would just allow us to move one step closer to you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just think it's such a beautiful beautiful thought this this one verse by the will of God and to the faithful in Christ Jesus I don't want to take it out of context but I do believe there's a couple of points in there that speak directly to the Bride of Jesus Christ speak directly to the Believers in this age I just wanted to have a couple of announcements we have delayed a little while and we're going to move forward with the vote for the church offices and we'll do that the week of the 21st to the 27th and I say it that way because we'll do it through the SurveyMonkey app once again and it will give everyone a chance to vote over the period of a few days the results will be announced on the 28th and just a recap on the requirements we want to remember that uh according to the bylaws for calorie Living Word you need to be over 18 years of age you need to be in regular attendance of the assembly and you need to be tithe pain so if you meet those requirements then you are eligible to vote and both husbands and wives are eligible to vote according to the bylaws so we certainly want to encourage you to take advantage of your right according to the bylaws um we have a gym night coming up this Friday on the 12th we have a ladies brunch on Saturday the 13th it's hard to believe that it's almost already the middle of May pretty soon we'll be in October and looking at snow again goes so fast and it seems to just get faster and faster it's amazing but we'll enjoy the summertime while we have it we're supposed to have a little bit of a heat wave this week in into next so that'll be nice certainly enjoying the birds being around and just to see the Life coming back to the area green grass thunderstorms rain the the smell of rain such a beautiful time are you happy tonight I just want to speak about the believer's position in Christ and uh it's actually a message that brother Branham preached and such a beautiful message the position the believer's position in Christ is really one I want to talk about tonight and we know that that that position in Christ is only through the baptism of the Holy Spirit but you know there was a quote on Sunday that I read I just I just wanted to pick that up but I'm gonna maybe just continue to repeat it I think it's so important to recognize and uh I apologize if it starts to become repetitive I certainly don't want it to be that way but I think there's some points that are really important and uh shouldn't be overlooked and you know we don't want to go back to Pentecost we don't want to go back to another day we want to we want to go forwards into the day that we're called to live in and we know that where we are is actually right back to Pentecost and we're not talking about a denomination of Pentecost we're not going back to Azusa Street we're not looking for many signs and wonders what we are looking for is a full manifestation of the word of God in our lives being able to say be it unto me according to Thy word and and not according to what somebody else thinks should happen and and I think that can be a real trap for the believer to think that I should behave a certain way I should do things a specific manner because as soon as you start to do that you know what's going to happen is you're going to actually put God in a box and say this is actually the only parameters that you have to function in my life and it's not going to go any farther the beautiful part is when we are truly Sons and Daughters of God he will smash those walls he will destroy that box that we have create created or performed in our own lives but you know his will is his word talking about that quote I brought out on Sunday I just wanted to read this out of the choosing of a bride you don't have to bring it up for time's sake but you know there's two types of people in this world and uh I've said that many times when we were in business there's two types of people in this world those that get it and those that don't but I'm not talking that way tonight I'm speaking about the classifications of people that the prophet brought out and you know the word of God is really the one that brought it out the the clearest but paragraph 170 out of the choosing of a bride the brother Branham is talking about those two classes of people and one of them is pregnated by their denominations right we spoke about this on Sunday they're willing to say you know I'm going to do what the pastor says I'm going to do what the church says I'm going to accept whatever the traditional teaching of my religion is and that's as far as it goes or maybe they'll say I'm going to accept a new religion maybe you're a Catholic and and we're going to go and be a an Anglican because the Catholics are doing something funny that I just can't agree with so now the anglicans are actually a little closer in the direction of the word but we're still going and accepting some sort of a book of denominational beliefs we're accepting a way of living and you know we have said it before in the past two people could say well you're just following a man too right we're just following the teachings of William Mary and Branham but yes we are following the teachings of William Mary and Branham which is the teachings of Paul the Apostle this one that actually wrote this this scripture here he wasn't the author he was the Scribe he was the one inspired to actually put this pen to paper but that's what we believe we're not reading a formal document every single one of the assemblies that that we would call message churches are sovereign there are some people out there though that want to be the bishop and you know we're not going to get into that tonight it's it's funny how it works but brother Bradham said it you know what that Antichrist Spirit would creep into the church and cause it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless and I want to say those are three identification those are three markers that we should really think about are we lukewarm are we formal because if we're going to be either one of those we're going to be powerless brothers and sisters that's what's going to happen in our lives and who wants to be powerless as a believer of this word my goodness his will is his word paragraph 170 out of this message the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body this is the one that we want to talk about tonight the the Bride of Jesus Christ the one that says Amen to the word just like Mary said to the angel messenger when he came to her and gave her the message the other is pregnant by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that I think that's so incredible to think the body of Christ isn't finished yet brothers and sisters we're still here the body of Christ isn't finished yet isn't that beautiful there's still room there's still time but not much the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word it just I'll probably continually read this so bear with me um it's just I think it's it sums it up right there that's the day in which we live in that's the promise we're looking for is the bride coming of the Lord the bride becoming one when that mind that was in Christ Jesus goes in in her when that's all we think about brothers and sisters of course we're going to be living in this world and paying bills and doing our jobs but what do we think about in between those moments when we're performing our functions you know for those people who have ever been in love and had a relationship what happens when you fall in love with someone every waking moment is spent Desiring to think about that person and and really what I would say this is how I would classify it is when it's truly love you can't help it you just can't help it something just continually drives your mind towards the thoughts of that person you're continually thinking about that person you want to get to know that person better you want to see that person you want to talk to that person I want to encourage every one of us brothers and sisters to have that kind of an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ where we think about him that way as a bride would think about her husband because when we do brothers and sisters that's when this this mind that was in Christ will be enough because our thoughts will no longer be our thoughts we will change our thinking those thoughts that come into our mind when they're not the thoughts of the word when they're not the thoughts of God when they're Satan's thoughts we're just going to dismiss them they're just not even going to have anywhere to go and I believe that's the place that brother Bradham said will come to one of these days where we'll be so far into Christ that Satan won't even be able to find us we'll be so far in there he won't even be able to find us he'll have a hedge all the way around us just like job had or another one brother Bradham says is that there is going to come at time where Satan just won't even want to deal with us Satan just won't even want to deal with us he'll be like oh no I'll go and I'll go and deal with anyone else in this world we'll go after some of those unwise virgins because we know they don't have that protection of the oil but those wise virgins man we can't get through to them they're full of oil and we can't we can't deceive them but you know one of these types of people has the old nature one of these types of people has the old nature and will always say you know what I'm good I'm good yeah I'm good man I know I had my experience back there and everything is fine in my life and I'm good it's fine I believe everything is fine it's not a problem I know it all and the other one is going to say you know what be it unto me Lord according to your word I need a new Revival in my life every single day that I open my eyes and that I have breath in my lungs that's what I want to do is think about you I want to fall in love with you more and more every single day I don't want to say that I'm good I know that I'm not good I know that everything inside of me is a scoundrel in this flesh but boy oh boy if you can live out through me then I know there's something good going to happen and I just want to say tonight that's the difference between those two Believers because they're both Believers brother Bradham says one is an unwise virgin and the other one is a wise virgin the unwise Virgin has not enough oil she's got a bit of oil but she doesn't have enough oil and she wants to get some from the wise virgin we know the wise virgin says you know what no I don't think there's going to be enough for both of us I just have enough for me you got to go get your own go buy your own that's what he she tells her and when she goes to buy it that's when the door is closed right that's when it's over that's when it changes and we know that changes right here at the door brother Branham says that she goes out to get it but it doesn't say in the word that she gets it she goes out to get it there's a few of these people in this world brother Brown talks about it in the in the exposition of the seven Church ages I think it's such a powerful passage and I can't even really do it justice in the few minutes we have but I'm just going to try and draw our attention to it out of the seven Church ages the start of seeing Church age brother Bradham says all these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remained that's the Bride of Jesus Christ their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world their names remained but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that's why I think it's so important I know we all know this we have a real tremendous opportunity in our lives to encourage people to the word or discourage people to the word depending on the life that we live before them the bride will be those whose names ah sorry but those who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed and that is who will lose out it's a tough statement he says they will be cast into the Lake of Fire now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly but the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride a word bride talking about our scripture tonight by the will of God to the faithful in Christ Jesus a word bride it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him all right I just think it's such a wonderful thing if we can realize this brothers and sisters doesn't matter what Satan does to us does it doesn't matter what happens to us we've got every reason to jump up and down and scream and shout because you won greater than the Powerball lottery you you've won the greatest thing that you could ever get if you look at the the the monarchy and how they were crowned I took a look uh the other day at the the crown jewels before they actually did the coronation for the monarchy there anybody know how much that Crown was worth the crown just the crown I thought it would be millions of dollars and I was like man that's a fancy crown that that Crown they're gonna use it was the one that was on display inside the Tower of London I think they adjusted it changed it or something for the coronation I could be wrong but that Crown the way it sat there was over three billion dollars in value but to think it's nothing compared to the crown which you've been given nothing compared to the crown which we have been entitled to if we talk about an entitlement environment an entitlement anointing there's a purpose for it because the bride is entitled to that position to sit with him in his throne not to stand before that throne in judgment why she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was four known and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth we can see Jesus in there in that scripture can't we boy Satan sure likes to try and make it cloudy for us to see us in there hey he likes to try and muddy those Waters and make it look real blurry and give us as much spiritual Amnesia as we can possibly get but you know that's why we come to church so we can actually start to play those songs that start to stimulate the soul and the believer to go back to the before the before to remember what it was like to be in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation if we could just believe that if I could just believe that if I could just walk out of this building tonight and think I could just never come into condemnation I say Lord help me to realize that help me recognize that I could never come into condemnation it doesn't matter what the devil does it doesn't matter what this flesh does doesn't matter how he tries to use this flesh against me God only sees me the way he created me he only sees you the way he created you with that crown that you have she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her my that's you Romans 4 8 lest is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels why even oh he he says her name and in Brackets it says each of her members and while I was studying this I thought you know it'd be just real nice to just start listing off every single person's name but for time's sake I won't do that just just maybe think of this brothers and sisters her name put your name in there was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world your name was positionally placed there secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection I've talked to people who have said you know there that'll happen we'll come up with a second Resurrection but I think the word of God says it would be probably better for you to not have known and actually rejected the word of God for your day than to actually just I find yourself in that position brother Bradham says their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in Matthew 25. it's it's it's just a staggering thing to think about that that we can never come into the condemnation and that's really one thing I just want to point out tonight I want to really hammer on that it doesn't matter what Satan does to us brothers and sisters it doesn't matter how hard we fall down it doesn't matter how much we hurt it doesn't matter how much we hurt others and people I know will be saying Oh Brother Barry that's real easy for you to say but you know what what did Christ do for us at Calvary how much was he hurt what did he endure what did he go through and that was for every single one of us so that we could be written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so that sin could not even be imputed against us so that the accuser of the Brethren one day he'll just be cast down brothers and sisters and when he's cast down then the bride goes up and you know there's three and a half years of Terror on Earth and we will not be here not that we don't want to be here we won't be here for one bomb Falls the bride will be gone don't worry don't worry I just wanted to encourage you tonight as the the last sentence in this first chapter the first verse of the first chapter Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are Ephesus he's addressing it to a very specific people a very specific Church the Saints which are Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus and everyone else who believes in Christ Jesus and to think about what it means to be faithful we know that we talked about a little while ago there's coming an ending of our faith and that's what it has to be and when that happens it's no longer our faith it's the Lord Jesus Christ Living out his life his faith and his faith will always just say it doesn't matter what Satan says God's word says doesn't matter what Satan's word says God's word says it will always take us back just like Jesus did in the wilderness when Satan came around and tempted him with those three Giants and we know that he cast him down every single time all three of those Temptations He didn't say no get behind me I could call 12 000 Legions of angels and just destroy you he didn't do that he just simply said just get behind me Satan you know what's also written you don't have any power over me you're an offense to me just get lost and that's what we need to do as Believers we have the ability to do that the faithful tonight out of uh the believer's position in Christ paragraph 21 to the faithful in Jesus Christ now this letter is addressed to those not to the outside world not to it's it's not a sermon Paul wasn't preaching here to the unsaved he was preaching to the saved excuse me they're called out the separated the set aside and the faithful in the call and tonight I just want to encourage every single one of you every single one of you if you're watching this on the screen if you're here in person you're that faithful that he's talking about you're that faithful that he's talking to and and you know just starting here and anchoring it here it's by the will of God brother brought him in this message he talks about the apostle and he says very clearly in this message missionaries are Apostles it brings it up to a current day a current word that we're more familiar with Paul a missionary by the will of God there's many missionaries In This World by the will of God and and I know for sure there's people in denominations who are missionaries by the will of God now you might say brother Barry that's a strong statement but you know brother Branham says there's Believers in every denomination not just in in Calgary Living Word not just in another message Church there's people who follow the will of the Lord in fact I would say the entire world does if they're a virgin one or the other they're following the will of the Lord and every other person in this world is doing what the Lord wants for those groups of people whether they believe it or not nothing happens in this world without it being the will of God but here we have Paul actually talking to a called out people the separated people the set aside and the faithful in the call and we know that we have to have ears to hear what that call is but boy when we can start looking at the book of Ephesians and and seeing it from the believer's position the believer's position in Christ and how do we get into Christ we know there's only one way to get into Christ but that's by being baptized into one body brother Branham he says the believer's position he goes on to say now that's who he's addressed it to in Jesus the believer's position is in Christ and Christ will only meet the believer the believer can only worship Christ as he is positionally placed in Christ and we know there's only one way to be positionally placed in Christ and that's through the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the brown goes on to say I don't believe you get it let me go another route look a Believer cannot worship and has no right to worship no man has no right to Worship the Lord outside of being in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ did you know that if we had time to go back and pick up the laws on that it would be beautifully he who is addressing it to the believer in Christ faithful in Jesus Christ isn't a wonderful thing to think that you are faithful in Jesus Christ and the only reason that you're faithful in Jesus Christ is because he's given us the ability to be the faithful in Jesus Christ not because we decided one day I just want to be faithful in Jesus Christ I do believe as a Believer we can say I want to be more faithful in Jesus Christ but you know when when you're in Jesus Christ you're in Jesus Christ you're not just part way into Jesus Christ brother Bradham says that you're not a a white Blackbird you're not actually mostly saved but kind of not you're either saved or you're not and if you are saved you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you're not you're not given the new birth without getting the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters there's a misconception I think that brother Branham he talks about it both ways but I just I just side with that way that you cannot be saved and not have the Holy Ghost because if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not going to go on the rapture so how can you be saved how could that possibly be you have to but boy when you've got it you've got it and that's one of the biggest tricks of the devil that's the one he uses the most is to say to people you don't got it no you don't you don't have it you never did have it you wouldn't have done that you wouldn't have thought that you wouldn't have gone there you wouldn't have said that you wouldn't have you wouldn't have you wouldn't have or you should have you should have you should have any single ammunition that he can any fiery Dart from from the enemy he'll throw at you but you know it doesn't matter because that's not the evidence if only evidence is our ability to receive the word and and that proves that we are the faithful in Christ Jesus in Jesus Christ but the other thing that he does is he'll he'll take people and say oh yeah you've got you've got brother yeah yeah it's your dress fine everything's fine you got it but then you'll have something funky something in in your walk with the Lord that just doesn't jive with the message of the hour and we'll go back to what we talked about before where there will be some time that someone will bring some kind of Correction and you'll say no no no no no I've got it I'm fine I'm good I don't need any more from it I I learned it long ago I know all about the message of the hour I've got it you know leave me alone I believe the way I believe when that happens brothers and sisters I would say that is a clear identification that there's something wrong with that experience and Satan will do that to us just to keep us off our our our Center Line in the road but you know if we are saved if we truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost if we do hear the word of God our our spirit will step aside and his spirit will rise up inside of us and say Amen to that word sometimes it might be hard for our flesh to step aside but it always will yield to the Holy Ghost if we have the Holy Ghost and when that happens then we know that we're children but when it doesn't happen the word of God says that we don't have a father and we don't want to be those people but you know the position the believer's position in Christ by the will of God when people says there's no more Apostles and that same church send missionaries and say there's no Apostles I I don't get it but the Apostle is one that sent so is the missionary is one that is sent by God and Paul by no desire of by choice not not by the will of man not by humanly desires but by the will of God he was an apostle he says we need some more like that I think that's a beautiful statement we need some more like that and you know to think about it I believe it's in this message he talks about it Paul was sent to the people to preach to them that he was persecuting he was laying that church to waste could you imagine being the church if we had a an apostle wanting to come to Calgary Living Word I would probably want to physically fight him and say no you're not coming here I'm not going to let you get behind the pulpit I'm not going to let you get anywhere near the people that that we look after here spiritually no way know how but then I would have to yield to the Holy Spirit wouldn't I but could you imagine what it would feel like for those people to think that this is the guy God sent now and what it would be like for him are you serious now I gotta go talk to the people that I was killing that I was throwing in prison and everything else but that's by the will of God I love how brother Branham says it a little later in this message sometimes God will take and make us do things that we thought we would never do we want to Never Say Never and Paul not by desire not by choice not by the will of man or his own humanly desires but by the will of God he was an apostle we need more like that by the will of God he was on his road to Damascus to arrest think of it was going to arrest the very group that he was sent to be an apostle of now you you see how upside down it looks like inhuman element that God does things just the very things you don't think that you wouldn't do that may be the very things you have to do that might be exactly what we have to do I just love it brother Bonham he talks about this I believe it's in this message bear with me no it's in the breach the real Holy Ghost I like how he he says this in here this this truly is the real Holy Ghost the bottom says a woman just called up another woman said you know I'm an Episcopalian he said I spoke in tongues the other day I believe I received the Holy Ghost but shh don't tell nobody brother Bradham says I doubt that very much you might have spoken with tongues but you set a Man on Fire how's he going to set still that's right see can't do it he says could you imagine Peter and James and John and them in the upper room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost now but maybe we better just keep still can you imagine that we better just be still we better be quiet he goes on to say brother through Windows Doors and everything they went out into the street acting like a bunch of drunks he says that's the real Holy Ghost I want to say tonight don't be afraid don't be worried just give God the Liberty to move let him move if he says stand stand we've witnessed it here a woman stand up and receive healing from breast cancer sister Shelley shared the testimony with me if anybody is interested and I can share it with you um it's tremendous but God's A Healer and he's a deliverer and you know sometimes our healing and our deliverance isn't necessarily in a Physical Realm it'll affect us in a Physical Realm if we leave it too long but sometimes we have a mental illness and I've heard this talked about and some people might say yeah I've heard it too now you're going down a different road but I don't know why I feel led to go this way I just know enough to do it when the time comes sometimes we suffer in our minds and that's a very real thing brothers and sisters many people would say well you get the Holy Ghost it just settles everything you don't have to worry about it it's true brother Bradham says you can actually lose your mind and have the Holy Ghost and still go to heaven so it goes to show that you still deal with a mental illness right it's something that can affect us and sometimes there's different things that can cause it sometimes they're Simple Solutions to fix it and God if we ask him many times I believe he will show us what the answer is we can be delivered from things that we maybe didn't even realize were a problem in our lives but we just need to trust them Satan's going to come and use any tactic he can go brother Batman goes on to say but you see that sleeping virgin ain't receiving nothing anyhow uh-huh that's right and remember while they went to try to buy oil remember the scriptures doesn't say they got it that's in the breach just before he preached the seals tonight this message here tonight is to the faithful in Christ Jesus this believer's position in Christ if you you just go on and read just a little tiny bit in the book of Ephesians and and we can just put our names in there when we hear the word us and you and them it's just amazing to think Satan is already defeated Satan wanted to be number one in the Kingdom and you know what's happened is Satan he's never going to have a position in the Kingdom he's going to be the one that's on the sides of the pit that everyone is going to walk by and narrowly look upon and say you're the one that troubled all the nations that was you are you serious right now we're going to be looking on him and thinking wow that's the guy every single heartache every single frustration every bit of anger every bit of confusion every bit of hurt and fear in my life is because of you well I think I'll just go and actually now that I've looked for today I'll just go and set right back down in in that Throne of judgment that you always wanted to sit in when you said that you wanted to be like the most high and and sit above the clouds in the congregation of the north the sides of the north it will be like that brothers and sisters he wants the position that you have and he knows that he will never get it but you already have it he gave it to you before the foundation of the world he gave it to you before he even created Satan and Satan knows it that's why he Badgers us so much but he's got no power he's powerless he's roaming about as a roaring lion to see who he may devour but he's got no teeth he's got no teeth with the Branham in the believer's position in Christ when I first seen the Full Gospel people and I seen a girl one night get up on the floor when the music was playing begin dancing up and down the floor I never danced in my life wasn't on a dance floor and didn't believe nothing in dancing imagine if somebody started dancing in here I saw someone dancing up in Edmonton and I know it caused a lot of uneasiness brother Branham goes on to say well selfishness here not out loud but in my heart I criticized the girl I said there's nothing about God about that here we have the prophet of God saying this there's nothing about God about that just a young Baptist preacher sitting there and I said there can't be nothing to that that woman out there on the floor she's only just making a show she just wants somebody to see her I was talking about a message Church in Edmonton that I saw that at by the way there can't be nothing to that that woman out there on the floor she's only just making a show she just wants somebody to see her I wouldn't say it out loud for nothing but in my heart I was thinking it and remember brother Branham says that your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words are here on Earth God's listening to our thoughts he knows exactly what we're thinking he goes on to say some of them said what did you think of that meeting I said it was fine but in my heart I didn't believe that something was still not settled with that woman that was up dancing around right brother random says so you know one New Year's night I was sitting in my own Tabernacle and they started playing this song there's going to be a meeting in the air and you know what happened I'd done the same thing so you see why so just the things that you say you won't do you may have to do it sometime and you know you don't have to dance brothers and sisters you don't have to scream and shout but if the spirit of God moves upon you there is nothing stopping you here you know the whole entire world gets excited about all of the different things that the whole entire world gets excited about we have full complete Liberty to get excited about the Lord putting us in this position in him before the foundation of the world recognizing that we have the position that only Satan desired to have and will never have he has chosen to make us faithful in Christ Jesus he chose you so that you could have the faith to be faithful in the word for your day I just think that's so rich you know the the first verse of chapter two and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses in sins sometimes people would say well I never sinned in the world I never went out in the world no you didn't but before you had the new birth you were born in sin you were shaped in iniquity and you came into this world speaking lies and if anybody has ever had a child or had to deal with children you know that you don't have to teach them to lie when they know that they're going to get a spanking for misbehaving they're gonna lie that's what children do and you know if we don't deal with that it's actually going to turn into a spirit that will manifest in our lives and we know later on in the Scripture it says the Liars will have no part in the Kingdom of Heaven they'll actually wind up in the Lake of Fire and that's why as parents we teach our children don't lie you have to tell the truth it's one of the most powerful things you can do as a person as an adult is just tell the truth if you tell the truth it'll always work out right but the faithful in Christ Jesus Here We Are Tonight imagine I I imagine if Paul was able to look through the the corridors of time and see groups of people like us sitting around talking about this scripture while he was actually scribing it under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost was he able to see the vision of the people in the ages to come because he spoke about the ages to come but brothers and sisters you're in Christ tonight you have every reason to Rejoice every reason to recognize that you will never ever fail you will never fall because sin can't even be imputed unto you brother Branham says in this message the believer's position in Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself that was his Temple then that body for sin our sins was tore apart it's flesh ripped in two and blood vessels was broken and there now as the Spirit come from his body that all believers hope you see it look all believers that comes through the blood into the body of Jesus Christ worshiped God through the shed blood of Jesus Christ in line they are positionally placed in Christ you see it remember the first thing that Jesus did God did rather when Jesus bowed his head and gave up the ghost the very first thing he did he didn't go to heaven he went to the tradition he went right into the temple where the most holy people were and he tore that Veil from top to bottom and he said now that that holy of holies that place that was only reserved for the priest for the high priest once a year to come into and and if he didn't have his life right he'd be drug out by a rope that place now is wide open the tree of life the way to the tree of life is opened up wide open now he went right into the temple and tore that Veil top to bottom to demonstrate that that blood vessel was broken and it was truly finished that word that was in him from before the foundation of the world now was sealed with blood and brothers and sisters tonight I want to say it that you are that word you were in him before the foundation of the world I like thinking this way I don't know if brother Branham says it or if somebody else said it I can't help but think that the the names that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world excuse me they were written in blood they were not just penned in pen it wasn't just red ink it wasn't just a fine ink that was supplied from somewhere like India it wasn't any of that It Was Written in Blood something that would never be able to be erased it was a permanent Mark and and nothing could touch it he goes on to say to them that are in Christ faithful called chosen in Christ that's who Paul's addressing in this letter to aren't you happy today you're in Christ those people who were called before the foundation of the world nothing they ever done nothing they could ever do they didn't even know who they were when they were born but they were born to be positionally placed in Christ I hope it's not too many quotes tonight I just uh just listened to this message I got so thrilled by it I always get inspired by the message and I just love it but you know brother Branham says it he says how do we get in it wish we had time for it for about six more minutes look how do we get into Christ by one Spirit not even one Fellowship no the first thing comes first by one Church no by one letter no by one Creed no my one spirit we are all baptized into one body and I love how he says this he goes even further brother Rory this is for you tonight he says not by water not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord one Spirit we're all baptized into one body it's not something that we can do on the outward to make it happen it's an inward work it's an inside job it's when we say be it unto me according to Thy word that's when something will happen that's when we get baptized we know we got examples in the Bible where people receive the Holy Ghost before the water and the people went and got baptized afterwards as an outward expression of the inward work to fulfill all scripture that was the the outward expression that had to happen to fulfill the scripture in their lives but sometimes there's people that can't do it it just won't happen and that's fine God knows our hearts God's so much bigger than tiny formalities in this world I think it's so beautiful if we if we can just allow God to be God the first thing comes first by one Church no by one letter no by one Creed no but by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body not by water not by power not by might but my by my spirit saith the Lord one Spirit were baptized what by the spirit where does the spirit say where is life in the blood coming through the blood of Christ first becoming a Believer outside of Christ without god without hope and the world condemned to die then by Grace elects us calls us to Christ we hear him inside the blood cell calling to us life you get it and we come then confess our sins and are baptized for the remission of our sins then taken through the blood till the blood cell till we come through the spray of blood then by the Holy Spirit are baptized inside this blood cell and we have Fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ the son of God cleanses from all unrighteousness oh my there you are I love how he says that we have Fellowship one with another we don't separate he goes on to say that's what we need positionally come first to Christ through the blood the shed blood then positionally were seated in Christ and that's our desire tonight brothers and sisters is to be seated in Christ Jesus to recognize that even though we were dead in sin and trespasses maybe some more than others on the outward appearance but you know what the word of God says brothers and sisters is to be guilty of the least is to be guilty of the whole doesn't matter if we've got a perfect life if we have still never surrendered our perfect life to Jesus Christ we're just as guilty as a murderer it's terrible to say it but it's true because the murderer isn't going to inherit the kingdom of God and neither is someone that says they're fine they're just fine they're not going to go all the way to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they're both going to inherit incorruption or corruption sorry but tonight I'm just so thankful that we can talk to the faithful who are in Christ Jesus and and we talk about these things to to set a contrast not to try and make people feel bad or try and single out anybody because we would that everyone would come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and how do we truly receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives brothers and sisters today we heard brother Branham say it but I'll say it tonight in my own words it's not by a Creed it's not by joining Calgary Living Word it's not by joining any other Living Word it's not by joining a message church or or saying that I believe God sent a prophet even you've got to believe what that Prophet who has since said in order to receive the Holy Ghost and outside of doing that brothers and sisters you might have a little bit of oil it might be a little bit of anointing but the word of God calls it unwise virgins maybe you believe the word of God but you're just not willing to go all the way to accept the message of the hour if you're not going to do that the same thing happened to Noah's day what happened I keep saying it but I can't help it if you didn't get in the boat you died if you don't get in the boat today you're going to die he sends a prophet for a purpose and we know that the word of God and Amos is it 3 7 says that surely the Lord will will do nothing but first he reveals it through his servants the prophets he's not going to come and judge a man without first telling him get right with me just make it right with me he's a just God we know this world doesn't want to hear the word prophet doesn't want to hear that that God sent a prophet and unless you're willing to actually listen to what that Prophet said and follow his instruction which is the instruction that Paul gave the church don't want to hear it comfortable things are good but we know that if you look at the Bible in the Book of Revelation I believe it is there's the church ages and the laodicean church age many people even Scholars would say that's the final Church age and here we are brothers and sisters and what does it say that that that church you know what he he he he just can't deal with us because we're lukewarm the laodicean conditioned is that you're lukewarm and you're formal and you're powerless and because you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth I would that you were hot or that you were called that you were one or the other we don't want to say no I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing this whole entire world North America all around the world is Rich increased with goods and has need of nothing I don't know if there's ever been this much wealth in the world can't help but go back and think about the days of Noah where where our Prophet The Prophet for our day he said you know they were technologically advanced in those days and we know still today if you listen to theologians or or guys who are maybe the scientific um I don't know lost for words the Masters maybe of of the the Egyptian uh pyramids they still say you can't rebuild the pyramids there's no way the technology was higher than what we have today something was used to build those pyramids and we know the prophet said it was an atomic energy that actually threw the Earth off its axis and caused a whole bunch of different things to happen I'm not going to go into that tonight but you know there's a higher there's a higher knowledge there's there's a higher understanding and we think that we're very far advanced in the world in which we live in but you know they could have easily had cell phones in Noah's day crazy but brother Branham said they launched Rockets into the atmosphere to say you don't have water up there we can prove to you scientifically that it's never going to rain what else did they have what kind of other power did they have the ability to control atomic energy to lift stones and positionally place them to cut them so perfectly that you couldn't even fit a razor blade between them so strong so strongly fit together that they would go through an entire flood a delusion of water on this Earth that's never been before never will be again we know that there was the flood of water but now we're looking at a flood of fire and that fire is going to fall any one of these days brother badam says it in the message the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ we was expecting it the the glacier of fire right at the end of that message all day long we heard them talking about it that it's going to come it's going to come it's going to come and he said he was standing there with his wife I just love the description of it because it's a perfect description of what's going to happen in the life of a Believer we're going to be in our positions he talks about husband and wife just being there expecting it to happen and then there was a moment where he heard it over the loudspeaker all things are ready and then he said he heard a voice by him it wasn't coming from the loudspeaker it was a voice by him saying Let the Fire Fall brothers and sisters what day do we live in where are we at today my goodness I'm so encouraged tonight I just was as I was studying this thinking that by the will of God he's speaking to the faithful in Jesus Christ and then we have this isn't Paul speaking brothers and sisters this is God speaking through the Apostle God ministering through the missionary God giving a spiritual inspiration for him to write this out the very next verse just like the angel when it would come to to someone in the Bible don't fear just relax everything is going to be okay his his salutation his grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ so if you ever hear anything contrary to that brothers and sisters any other words come to your mind that you know you're a scoundrel maybe you're bad maybe you've done something wrong you're terrible all these negative thoughts that the devil can try and put in our minds it's Satan trying to bombard us to make us feel bad because that's not what the word of God says the word of God says Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ so if we're not feeling peace what's going on there's something wrong brothers and sisters we have the ability to recognize that he is speaking to the faithful in Christ Jesus and the thing that I love what probably the greatest thing that I love just for me it's my my thing with what the prophet said is our feelings have nothing to do with it if we were to dwell on our scriptural identity about our feelings we would be doomed there would be no way that we would ever be able to drag our carcass to church again for another service after the things that we've gone through this week right that's many times the way that I feel I just wouldn't be able to do it how could I possibly ever go and stand before the truly elect bride of Jesus Christ and Minister this this word the sacred word of God but my feelings have nothing to do with it if he has called me the faithful in Christ Jesus and it's by the will of God I just want to put my foot forward and say Hey you know I I know that he's called me and I know that he will make a way for it and that's what we all do brothers and sisters and by doing that that demonstrates whose side you're on that demonstrates the faithful in Christ Jesus and now just for the record it's not because you come here to this church it's because you press play for the message of the hour it's because you go on your knees and you pray to this God that we talk about it's because you witness the testimony of Jesus Christ to the world around you you're faithful in Christ Jesus it's got nothing to do with the church the church is just a little display of it but it's so good isn't it to bring your licks of fire together bring our Elixir fire together and just Worship the Lord knowing that we are the faithful called before the foundation of the world by the will of God to actually have Grace ministered to us and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I don't want to go too far into this tonight but I just want to encourage us if you have any questions about it just maybe ask me or pick up the book and and just read the first chapter of Ephesians because he's not talking about another group of people he's talking to you tonight brothers and sisters he's talking to me when I read this I can't help but just get like that story of that that man who is living with his daughter and and she got got fed up with him getting so excited having his Pentecostal experience every time he'd read his Bible and she wanted to have the tea party remember that and and she said I'm going to have the Tea Party dad you got to go upstairs and just be quiet while I have the tea party we don't want you getting too crazy and Pentecostal with us here and and so she sends them up there and doesn't give him his Bible but he starts reading that that magazine I don't know what it was a National Geographic maybe and he starts seeing God in creation and he just starts having a fit again because he just knows that God is in complete control he's created it all and it's all for him and and by him all things were created but he can recognize as a faithful in Christ Jesus that he has a position I'll call the musicians tonight as we close I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters as the Devil comes around as he rages in our lives just remember it's by the will of God that you are the faithful in Christ Jesus and he has desired for Grace to be unto you and for peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ not destruction not Terror not fear not anger not anxiety all of those are of the devil every single one of them there's therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus so brothers and sisters if you truly are in Christ Jesus you're faithful in Christ Jesus you got no condemnation there's there's no sin that can be imputed against you even though he's up there trying so hard to to minister to bring things accusations against the Brethren there's nothing that will be imputed to you tonight maybe just stand as we bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father tonight we thank you Father that you have called us before the foundation of the world to be here excuse me father to be willing recipients of your word what a tremendous blessing it is father to recognize that there's nothing that we've done or nothing that we could ever do except for recognize what you've already done for us and Lord we recognize that by by saying Amen to the word to recognize that you had a special message Father in your Bible that you gave to all of the ages Lord Jesus it was evolving and and growing and and it came to the place where it was a complete word but there were still mysteries encapsulated in that word but father at the End of Time Lord you didn't just leave man looking at those Mysteries poking at those Mysteries you sent a prophet Lord and Lord he didn't open those Mysteries but you opened those Mysteries through that prophet and you revealed those Mysteries through that Prophet Lord Jesus and we know that there's no more Mysteries because in Revelations 10 7 it says when when oh father Lord Jesus we just love you we thank you tonight I pray that Lord you would just minister to us a little further as we go along the way Lord father that you would help us to just take your word in in our hearts Lord and father just be able to be living Witnesses of your life to the world around us Lord let our feelings not have anything to do with it help us to push down those feelings Lord when they try to rise up in our lives help us to look towards you father to look into your word and to see the scriptural identity the identification of Your Love towards us father of your grace and your peace towards us father we love you and we thank you for writing our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world father Lord before there was even angels created before there was even a speck of Stardust is what your Prophet said whether you chose us in you father we love you and we thank you and we pray that you would just receive our praise tonight as we lord close the service and as we go our separate ways father I pray that you would just put a song in our hearts Lord Jesus that we would not be afraid to worship you the way that you desire to be worshiped father we just love you father and we thank you tonight we ask all these things now and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen the more that I Surrender the lighter my load the that I Surrender the lighter my Lord oh I don't care [Music] myself [Music] foreign [Music] gentle Shepherd [Music] s to help us
