========================================

[Music] The trial of this world were getting closer. The pool I felt was more than I could bear. And I was on the verge of giving over. The strength within myself just wasn't there. Something keeps holding me. Every day I sleep, he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trust. [Music] He's guiding me constantly, giving me victory. Oh, he's a reality. [Music] Something keeps holding me. Satan lead before me his temptation [Music] of his desire to steal away my faith. [Music] What I found inside the revelation, the strength I need to keep me in his grace. Something keeps holding me. Every day I see [Music] he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials. He's guiding me constantly, giving me victory [Applause] is our reality. [Music] Something keeps holding me. Jesus keeps holding me every day. I see. He's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials. Guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality. [Music] Jesus keeps holding me. [Applause] [Music] He's our reality. [Music] Cuz something keeps holding me. Amen. [Applause] [Music]
