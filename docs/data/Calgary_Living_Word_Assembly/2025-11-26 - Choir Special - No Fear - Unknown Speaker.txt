TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh so church, uh the choir has a song of testimony that they want to give to you today. Um we know that the Bible says that the devil goes around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. But that same Bible tells us that God has not given us a spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; but a spirit of love, power, and of a sound mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the choir here wants to give you their testimony of how with God we should have no fear. So if that is your testimony and you know the song, please feel free to sing along, clap along. Let's give God all the glory today. Okay? &gt;&gt; And let's show the devil that he has no control over us. No matter what situation he brings to us, be it financial, be it health, be it family, be it whatever it is, in everything that the devil brings our way with God, we will have no fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Quiet. &gt;&gt; I got enemies every time. You might think that I'd be afraid. Running scared with the shake of faith. But the God I know says it ain't over. The God I know is going to make a way. Though I walk through the valley, I will have no fear, no fear, no fear. The mighty power Jesus is fighting for me. No fear, &gt;&gt; no fear, &gt;&gt; no fear, &gt;&gt; no fear. &gt;&gt; The light of the world makes the darkness disappear. No fear, my life. No fear, my life, my life. No fear when I'm walking through the fire cuz I know what me is. Come on. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Future not bad in the struggles. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. My life in my life. No fear. Not my life. Not my life. My life. No fear. &gt;&gt; Not over my life. My life. Not over my life. No fear. &gt;&gt; Not over my life. Not my life. You have no fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
