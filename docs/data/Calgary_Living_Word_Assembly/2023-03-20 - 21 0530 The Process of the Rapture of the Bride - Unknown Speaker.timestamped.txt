[53:17] pondering over that Sam 150
[53:21] and how David was sitting on the same
[53:23] praise the Lord with the harp with the
[53:26] with the sound of the trumpet with the
[53:28] team bro
[53:29] with organ and I wondered you know why
[53:32] would God just
[53:34] be interested in musical instruments
[53:37] and then I remembered also in the Book
[53:40] of Revelation that's in heaven they have
[53:42] the Hop
[53:43] they have these instruments God enjoys
[53:46] our voices but he also enjoys the

[1:07:31] that's so true
[1:07:33] there's one that talks about and oh
[1:07:35] brother many many years ago but the Kim
[1:07:37] dingwall reminded me of that it says
[1:07:39] play with a loud noise
[1:07:41] I believe there will be no silence in
[1:07:44] heaven when we're there and we will sing
[1:07:46] and worship with who knows what
[1:07:49] instruments we'll have there but we're
[1:07:51] trusting the Lord that we'll be able to
[1:07:53] give him the praise that he's worthy of
[1:07:55] across another land but in the meantime
[1:07:57] here we are today thank you my brothers

[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:30] we're so blessed people this morning
[1:13:33] amen while you are
[1:13:37] standing maybe if let's check if uh I
[1:13:41] have a lot of uh slides here I hope you
[1:13:44] will not get bored but uh when you're
[1:13:47] talking about the word and the message
[1:13:48] you must be not bored at all because
[1:13:51] these are life
[1:13:54] amen and uh I was just thinking of
[1:13:59] uh uh maybe this is this could be a
[1:14:02] sequel to the the one that I preach in
[1:14:04] let bridge but uh there are only few
[1:14:07] families that went there so this time
[1:14:09] I'll uh I put the the code so that we
[1:14:13] can prove that time it's not it didn't
[1:14:15] come from me it came from the prophet of
[1:14:18] this age and we'll just putting them
[1:14:20] together
[1:14:21] right so that we know what we're talking
[1:14:24] about is the truth nothing but the truth
[1:14:27] because when when it is that said the
[1:14:29] Lord through the prophet we cannot
[1:14:31] reason out
[1:14:32] amen and uh he pointed out as to the
[1:14:36] absolute always which is the word which
[1:14:37] is Christ himself amen Anna
[1:14:41] since uh
[1:14:43] while you're standing maybe let's read
[1:14:45] the first
[1:14:50] first verse here
[1:14:56] actually my topic is thank you musician
[1:14:59] sorry it yeah you can keep that one yeah
[1:15:01] that will be best for me
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:07] so uh I entitled this uh
[1:15:11] sermon or preaching or teaching combined
[1:15:13] right the process of the Rapture in the
[1:15:16] bride amen and uh yeah I put a lot of
[1:15:21] uh
[1:15:22] uh verses and quotes So that at least we
[1:15:27] can go hopefully we can finish in before
[1:15:29] 12 or something but if not then maybe
[1:15:33] The Minister's other ministers can pick
[1:15:35] it up but this one is an important thing
[1:15:38] and it's an exciting
[1:15:40] uh topic
[1:15:42] because this is what we're longing for
[1:15:45] amen there's a reason why we come to
[1:15:48] church
[1:15:49] right is to have this complete body
[1:15:52] change and we know it's a process amen
[1:15:56] you were not born and then right away
[1:15:59] you're an adult right it maturing
[1:16:02] there's a maturing process you can say
[1:16:04] so let's read the first Thessalonians uh
[1:16:07] uh four
[1:16:09] 15 to 18. for this we say unto you by
[1:16:13] the word of the Lord that we which are
[1:16:15] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[1:16:19] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[1:16:21] asleep
[1:16:23] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:16:25] heaven with a shout
[1:16:27] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:16:29] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:16:32] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:16:36] praise the Lord are you are you alive
[1:16:38] this morning and remain shall be caught
[1:16:40] up together with them in the clouds to
[1:16:43] meet the Lord in the air and so shall we
[1:16:46] ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort
[1:16:49] one another with these words amen let's
[1:16:51] bow our hearts this morning
[1:16:53] oh God
[1:16:56] we need your anointing Lord we know
[1:16:59] you're already present
[1:17:00] from the start of the service Lord
[1:17:03] you have set the atmosphere Lord and we
[1:17:07] just want our hearts now to be open to
[1:17:09] receive your word completely Lord
[1:17:11] without any doubt because
[1:17:14] without even just one person doubt it
[1:17:18] will affect the whole thing
[1:17:20] because your word is pure therefore we
[1:17:24] want it to be a to be received
[1:17:27] completely without any hesitation
[1:17:29] without any doubt without any compromise
[1:17:31] oh God may you anoint my lips Lord lips
[1:17:36] of clay that just formed and I want to
[1:17:39] set aside myself so that you can speak
[1:17:42] to me I will just be your mouthpiece
[1:17:43] this morning oh Lord that your your your
[1:17:47] bride your your people Lord this morning
[1:17:49] will be blessed and then they would know
[1:17:52] who they are
[1:17:53] oh God very important thing Lord
[1:17:56] that this spiritual Amnesia will just be
[1:17:59] gone will be healed by by the feeling of
[1:18:03] your word by the preaching of your word
[1:18:05] oh God me may you bless the service from
[1:18:09] beginning to end and whoever will be
[1:18:12] streaming Lord and and the the people
[1:18:14] who are present in person here in the
[1:18:17] service Lord will will will just enjoy
[1:18:19] your word and the message of the hour
[1:18:21] Lord because the message of the hour is
[1:18:23] Christ in US completely it has been
[1:18:25] prayed several times we know all these
[1:18:28] words Lord May Quicken into our hearts
[1:18:30] Lord
[1:18:32] by receiving your full word this morning
[1:18:34] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[1:18:37] may be seated
[1:18:48] amen so
[1:18:50] uh this this is a background of uh
[1:18:53] the timeline that I've been preaching
[1:18:56] many times in different places but then
[1:18:59] the thing is if you want to know where
[1:19:01] you are check the you you must know the
[1:19:04] time where you're living in and and
[1:19:06] besides always it's being uh it's being
[1:19:11] said in the word and in the message that
[1:19:13] the the the the the the evidence of
[1:19:16] having the Holy Ghost
[1:19:18] is the ability to receive the word for
[1:19:20] your day
[1:19:21] amen it means
[1:19:23] it's important to know the message for
[1:19:26] our day amen and and came through the
[1:19:29] seventh angel messenger of Malachi for
[1:19:32] we know that I'm speaking to Believers
[1:19:34] this morning I believe amen and then
[1:19:36] we'll just uh we'll check how it goes
[1:19:39] and and my the topic is uh the the
[1:19:43] process of the Rapture in the bride and
[1:19:45] let's let's define some terms a process
[1:19:48] means it is composed of different steps
[1:19:51] before it can be perfected or before it
[1:19:54] can be completed the simple meaning of a
[1:19:57] process so it means it must undergo
[1:20:00] certain steps
[1:20:01] right so being a child if you are born
[1:20:04] then you have uh how how can you mature
[1:20:07] you have to eat feed and uh you will
[1:20:10] grow as uh as time passes and it's a
[1:20:13] process you can say it's a timeline
[1:20:15] right so and how about Rapture Rapture
[1:20:18] random or even the Bible said you cannot
[1:20:22] find it in the in the word the mean the
[1:20:24] the Rapture itself the the word rapture
[1:20:27] itself but it but it means meeting in
[1:20:30] the air body chains and then meeting in
[1:20:32] there that's a Rapture but then it's a
[1:20:34] process
[1:20:35] didn't say the Rapture is a process but
[1:20:38] then he said he put it in different uh
[1:20:41] perspective like for example the new
[1:20:43] bird the new bird is uh in physical form
[1:20:47] or natural it's a
[1:20:50] uh the water when when a woman gives
[1:20:55] birth right the the water will break
[1:20:58] first and then the blood and then the
[1:21:00] life
[1:21:01] it's the same as the new birth spiritual
[1:21:05] you have to undergo justification
[1:21:07] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost we know that's the the
[1:21:11] completeness but then at the same time
[1:21:12] because we're Eternal people be
[1:21:16] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:21:18] the world completion it it doesn't mean
[1:21:21] that you're done at that time because
[1:21:23] you have to go through eternity amen
[1:21:25] like uh when you say Justified uh
[1:21:29] Justified Sanctified baptized with the
[1:21:31] Holy Spirit then you have to live the
[1:21:33] full word and because in new Heaven and
[1:21:36] even when we cross uh when we cross a
[1:21:39] millennium because the bride will only
[1:21:42] be the one who will be considered in the
[1:21:45] Rapture amen and and it's through the
[1:21:48] message of the hour only because this
[1:21:50] message is for Rapture right it's a the
[1:21:53] rupturing faith lies on the message of
[1:21:55] this hour
[1:21:56] but then at the same time we have to
[1:21:58] also think of what Brian Brandon is
[1:22:01] saying rapturing grace we have to be
[1:22:03] gracious as well because there are other
[1:22:05] people
[1:22:06] on this Earth that might not be bright
[1:22:09] but they will be in the in in the second
[1:22:11] Resurrection Amen in eternity because
[1:22:14] it's not only for the bride you can say
[1:22:16] the uh they are outside the city there
[1:22:19] are other people the people that we meet
[1:22:21] in the school at work whatever
[1:22:26] we are giving them opportunity
[1:22:28] amen that's why the bride's Ministry is
[1:22:33] very important it has a purpose and it's
[1:22:36] a very very important purpose amen and
[1:22:39] this is uh imparting life you can say I
[1:22:43] don't want to be ahead of myself but uh
[1:22:45] let's let's try I'll be watching that
[1:22:47] clock and hopefully we can finish it so
[1:22:50] that
[1:22:51] so there are six raptures in the Bible
[1:22:54] uh in in the message the Rapture random
[1:22:57] uh clearly uh
[1:23:00] uh discuss them
[1:23:05] so the first one was Enoch you can see
[1:23:09] that in the in Genesis 5 24 that's
[1:23:12] Before the Flood
[1:23:14] that's in 3017 BC this is a timeline you
[1:23:17] can see that uh it's just like a time
[1:23:21] travel so that this we can enjoy where
[1:23:23] we are right so I'm just so passionate
[1:23:25] with timelines because uh almost
[1:23:28] everything that we we studied it's uh
[1:23:30] it's about time and that's the reason
[1:23:32] why we're called anti-message Believers
[1:23:34] because brother Branham identified that
[1:23:37] we are at the end so end time that's why
[1:23:39] we're called end time message Believers
[1:23:41] so bear with me I hope you will be bored
[1:23:43] with the with this presentation but uh
[1:23:45] uh just bear with me this little thing
[1:23:48] that I put together I hope it will be a
[1:23:51] blessing amen the first is eno right
[1:23:53] that's Before the Flood and then who's
[1:23:55] the second one
[1:23:57] Elijah
[1:23:59] that is in 896 BC Second Kings to 11.
[1:24:02] that's the second Rapture brother
[1:24:04] Branham was saying and then the the
[1:24:06] third one
[1:24:07] is uh Jesus himself
[1:24:10] right in uh it's about 33 A.D because uh
[1:24:15] the ministry of uh Jesus Christ started
[1:24:17] when he was 30 and for three and a half
[1:24:19] years that's the first half of the 70
[1:24:21] week of Daniel that's not our topic
[1:24:23] today but it falls in that it's related
[1:24:26] to it and that is uh in Acts 1 9 to 11
[1:24:30] that's 10 days before the Pentecost
[1:24:32] right so uh uh he was there when when he
[1:24:37] resurrected for 40 days he showed
[1:24:39] himself to his disciples and then uh
[1:24:43] that's the third uh the Rapture then the
[1:24:47] Old Testament Saints we know it's the
[1:24:49] same time with Jesus Christ
[1:24:53] around 33 A.D that's after Jesus death
[1:24:56] you can find that in Matthew 27 50-53
[1:25:00] when uh when he gave up the ghost you
[1:25:03] know you know the story there and then
[1:25:05] uh the Rocks were opened the uh The
[1:25:09] Grapes were opened and and the sleeping
[1:25:11] Saints of the Old Testaments
[1:25:13] Old Testament came alive right why
[1:25:17] because they were waiting for the
[1:25:20] perfect sacrifice
[1:25:22] right and who's that perfect sacrifice
[1:25:24] is Jesus Christ himself right so when he
[1:25:27] came and then gave up the ghost so all
[1:25:29] the saints in the Old Testaments they
[1:25:31] woke up amen that's uh that's in Matthew
[1:25:34] 27 52-53 amen that's what Barbara
[1:25:37] Branham was saying amen and the fifth
[1:25:39] one
[1:25:41] which is US amen this
[1:25:45] is for the New Testament Saints which is
[1:25:47] the Bride of the seven Church ages it
[1:25:50] started from uh Ephesus onwards right
[1:25:54] including the apostles amen uh this is
[1:25:57] the uh the
[1:26:00] this Encompass anyone that died after
[1:26:05] Jesus Christ resurrected when they were
[1:26:08] still alive at that time then they
[1:26:10] cannot be raptured because they're still
[1:26:12] alive right so but uh during that uh
[1:26:15] time period from Seven Church Asia even
[1:26:19] with the apostles up to the last age
[1:26:21] this age we are waiting for this Rapture
[1:26:26] which is uh the the verse that we read
[1:26:28] in first Thessalonians 4 amen we which
[1:26:31] are alive and remain shall not hinder
[1:26:34] them which are asleep anyone that were
[1:26:37] already that was already dead during the
[1:26:39] seven Church ages they are just waiting
[1:26:41] for us to be perfected amen so that's
[1:26:45] why
[1:26:46] let's not hinder them right we need to
[1:26:48] look for the last predestinated seed
[1:26:50] that's the reason why we're we're doing
[1:26:52] this amen we because we cannot be
[1:26:55] perfected without even the last
[1:26:57] predestinated seed because Christ will
[1:26:59] or God
[1:27:01] will not be perfect without that Single
[1:27:03] Seed that that is missing amen
[1:27:06] who knows where where he or she is right
[1:27:08] now who knows who he he might not have
[1:27:10] been born how long it would be we don't
[1:27:13] know but we know there is a promise for
[1:27:15] us amen so that's the PIP Rapture that's
[1:27:17] for us then the sixth one
[1:27:21] is Moses and Elijah of Revelations 11.
[1:27:24] this is after
[1:27:25] I don't know if it's clear enough for
[1:27:27] you here but uh I know in in in in the
[1:27:31] streaming might be very clear
[1:27:33] uh you can see in here
[1:27:37] Moses and Elijah
[1:27:40] Revelations 11. this is at the end of
[1:27:43] the three and a half years tribulation
[1:27:45] before the Millennium will will set in
[1:27:48] amen so these are the six raptures
[1:27:51] saying so three in the Old Testament
[1:27:53] that included Jesus Christ and three in
[1:27:56] the New Testament amen because the Old
[1:27:58] Testament is by law and uh the New
[1:28:02] Testament is by Grace amen and that's
[1:28:04] why we should be the most gracious
[1:28:06] people on Earth otherwise we will be uh
[1:28:09] judging people oh help us Lord amen so
[1:28:12] so let's uh let's continue
[1:28:17] so
[1:28:19] just just to read the message the
[1:28:21] Rapture here uh it is come a paragraph
[1:28:26] 152 to 153 1965 the Rapture now it's the
[1:28:31] first thing is the sounding the first
[1:28:33] thing is a it's a shout and then a voice
[1:28:36] and then a trumpet shout a messenger
[1:28:39] getting the people ready amen the second
[1:28:43] is a voice of the Resurrection the same
[1:28:45] voice that allowed Boys in Saint John 11
[1:28:48] 38 to 44 that called Lazarus from the
[1:28:51] grave that's the second step it's a
[1:28:53] process right so the first step is a
[1:28:55] shout the voice and then getting the
[1:28:58] brain together and then the resurrection
[1:29:00] of the Dead Sea to be caught up with it
[1:29:02] now watch the three things takes place
[1:29:04] the next is what a trumpet a shout a
[1:29:07] voice and a trumpet now the third thing
[1:29:10] is a trumpet which is always at the
[1:29:11] Feast of the trumpets is calling the
[1:29:13] people to the feast and that will be the
[1:29:15] bride's supper the lamb supper with the
[1:29:18] bride in the sky amen Let's uh let's be
[1:29:22] thankful on on those coats amen and then
[1:29:27] to understand the uh further
[1:29:32] I I put the timeline of the three
[1:29:33] comings of Jesus Christ also this it has
[1:29:36] been prayed several times in this Pulpit
[1:29:38] also and wherever we uh we listen to
[1:29:42] first coming Janda Baptist for around
[1:29:45] the first coming the second coming the
[1:29:48] second coming and then we must know that
[1:29:50] the second coming is also a timeline
[1:29:52] let's let's try to
[1:29:54] to check it amen the first coming
[1:29:57] is to redeem his bride
[1:29:59] amen that is from birth to Calvary
[1:30:02] that's Jesus Christ himself amen that's
[1:30:05] the first coming of Jesus Christ the
[1:30:07] second coming is to catch away his bride
[1:30:09] which is the rapture from Pentecost to
[1:30:11] the seven Church ages so you can see
[1:30:13] it's a timeline
[1:30:14] after Jesus Christ left and then up to
[1:30:17] today until the the catching away that's
[1:30:21] the second coming of Jesus Christ so
[1:30:23] it's a timeline you cannot just say it's
[1:30:25] just one time that's why when we talk
[1:30:27] about appealing and coming they're all
[1:30:29] talking about the same thing but then
[1:30:31] you have to put the timeline together so
[1:30:33] that you will not be confused did he
[1:30:35] already come yes he came in a spirit
[1:30:36] form he's living through us right now
[1:30:39] right and what are we waiting for is the
[1:30:43] Trump of God which is the married supper
[1:30:45] amen meeting in the air the full body
[1:30:49] chains but the body change as we say
[1:30:50] it's a body change is a rupture so it's
[1:30:53] a process the more we eat the more we
[1:30:56] grow
[1:30:57] right amen so
[1:31:00] I'm putting something as uh as the Lord
[1:31:02] leads me Charles Spurgeon
[1:31:06] it's about process right about maturing
[1:31:08] he was asked one time in his day he was
[1:31:12] asked what is more what what is more
[1:31:15] important
[1:31:16] reading the Bible or praying
[1:31:20] you know what he answered
[1:31:23] which is more important to you breathing
[1:31:25] in or breathing out amen what a
[1:31:29] beautiful reality right that's why you
[1:31:32] can see that that's why the song
[1:31:35] it's so important read your Bible and
[1:31:37] pray every day as you grow grow right
[1:31:40] it's not only for children it's also for
[1:31:43] us adults we need to feed and pray feed
[1:31:45] and pray feed and pray you can never
[1:31:49] overemphasize the importance of prayer
[1:31:51] that's why you can never out do praying
[1:31:54] you can always pray and you can always
[1:31:56] feed the word and it's the same as the
[1:31:58] wool uh the Sheep he just needs it just
[1:32:01] needs to feed and the wool will just
[1:32:03] come out amen so we need that right
[1:32:06] breathing in breathing out to live amen
[1:32:08] so that's the second part I'm just
[1:32:10] putting something here as we go the
[1:32:13] second coming of Jesus Christ is from
[1:32:15] after Jesus Christ left and then up to
[1:32:18] the catching away amen how about the
[1:32:20] third coming
[1:32:25] it's it's to reign with this bride in
[1:32:28] the millennium
[1:32:30] that's the third coming of Jesus Christ
[1:32:32] and
[1:32:34] and that's through the the full
[1:32:36] Millennium itself amen that's the third
[1:32:38] coming of Jesus Christ so uh we we are
[1:32:42] more interested on the second coming
[1:32:44] because that's where our parties in the
[1:32:46] third coming we will we will be with him
[1:32:48] when we come down right with him uh we
[1:32:52] will be under the souls of the faith of
[1:32:54] those who who are not Believers right uh
[1:32:57] and uh we will live with him in the
[1:33:00] Millennium for for a hundred years and
[1:33:02] then we cross eternity later on okay
[1:33:06] so let's uh
[1:33:09] Let's uh back that up with with codes
[1:33:12] right in the future home of the Heavenly
[1:33:14] bridegroom and the Earthly bride Jesus
[1:33:17] comes three times so you can see
[1:33:19] anything that I put I must find it in
[1:33:22] the message right so at least I he will
[1:33:24] tell me it's my own idea that's a
[1:33:27] denomination if I put my own idea
[1:33:29] forgive me if if I do I'm ready to to uh
[1:33:33] to uh uh repent if I make mistakes
[1:33:36] forgive me I'm just your brother here
[1:33:39] and we we must be having this Liberty
[1:33:41] together right so even even only 12
[1:33:45] people are here including myself but
[1:33:48] then those who are streaming I don't
[1:33:50] know who they are but I believe you'll
[1:33:52] this these are Word of Life right this
[1:33:56] is the word of life so Jesus comes three
[1:33:58] times and we must base our life
[1:34:01] accordingly because when we say we're
[1:34:03] message Believers we have to check what
[1:34:04] the message say and it must line up with
[1:34:06] the Bible amen Jesus comes three times
[1:34:09] come once to redeem his bride that's
[1:34:12] that's what we we checked a while ago
[1:34:14] next time to get his bride that is to
[1:34:18] redeem uh to to to rupture his bride to
[1:34:21] cut to catch his bride next time with
[1:34:25] his bride amen so that's that's the
[1:34:28] first uh
[1:34:30] uh quote but there's so many I I just
[1:34:33] put the the most important one so far
[1:34:35] now notice and this the coming of Jesus
[1:34:38] to 60 times
[1:34:41] it's bright he comes the next where
[1:34:43] caught up in the air to meet him in the
[1:34:46] air
[1:34:47] we caught up to meet him he comes to
[1:34:49] receive his bride
[1:34:51] the next time he comes he comes as king
[1:34:53] and queen to Reign on the earth with his
[1:34:56] bride three comings right amen so you
[1:34:59] see three comings so at the same time
[1:35:03] these three comings we have to
[1:35:05] understand the sonship of Jesus Christ
[1:35:06] because sonship is not Eternal said it
[1:35:10] clearly because asan is begotten
[1:35:13] therefore it has a beginning
[1:35:15] if it has a beginning it has an ending
[1:35:17] amen but then he's Eternal we know he's
[1:35:20] eternal
[1:35:21] by the person of being uh being a god
[1:35:24] it's the same as us being the bride of
[1:35:26] Christ we are also Eternal beings but we
[1:35:30] we were born here in this Earth so
[1:35:32] therefore we have an end but then the
[1:35:34] thing is the body the theophany that we
[1:35:36] have that will be changed later on is
[1:35:38] eternal it's a
[1:35:40] and then when we accepted the message
[1:35:42] actually even before the foundation of
[1:35:44] the world
[1:35:45] that seed was implanted because of his
[1:35:48] foreknowledge he predestinated us to be
[1:35:52] sons and children of God and to be a
[1:35:54] bride
[1:35:55] on a different level of uh perspective
[1:35:58] they're the same it's about Redemption
[1:36:00] amen it's about going back to him amen
[1:36:03] what a beautiful reality okay sonship of
[1:36:07] Jesus Christ so the first he came as a
[1:36:11] son of man there are so many verses here
[1:36:14] can you read it I don't know I'll just
[1:36:16] mention it Matthew 13 57 Matthew 21 11
[1:36:20] Luke 24 19 Jan 4 19 acts 7 37 son of man
[1:36:26] Ministry is a prophet he came as himself
[1:36:30] Jesus Christ himself when he became the
[1:36:32] lamb that is uh ready to be sacrificed
[1:36:35] on the cross amen that's the son of man
[1:36:38] Ministry a prophet amen
[1:36:40] Son of God
[1:36:42] that's the Holy Ghost dispensation
[1:36:45] it's in John 14 16-20 and John
[1:36:49] and John 16 7-13 amen that's the Holy
[1:36:55] Spirit dispensation amen
[1:36:57] so
[1:36:58] and then the third sonship it is called
[1:37:02] son of David it's in you you can find it
[1:37:05] uh he will rule uh as a king in the
[1:37:09] Millennium and we are his bride amen and
[1:37:12] that that can be found in Revelations
[1:37:15] 17 to 14 17
[1:37:19] verse 14 Revelations 19 16. First
[1:37:22] Timothy 6 15 Jeremiah 23 5 Isaiah 9 7.
[1:37:28] okay he will be king in the Millennium
[1:37:30] but this is the important one this is
[1:37:32] for us actually we've been preaching
[1:37:34] Barry was also preaching about this and
[1:37:36] many other ministers the son of man
[1:37:39] before that so he before this uh being a
[1:37:44] son of David Ministry in the Millennium
[1:37:46] there will be a little season here
[1:37:50] uh which is for us including the
[1:37:53] including brother Branham of course
[1:37:55] because he's our leader he's our he's
[1:37:57] our messenger for the for the AIDS son
[1:38:00] of man Luke 17 30 and Revelation 10.
[1:38:03] let's read the
[1:38:05] the verses support our supporting quotes
[1:38:07] Okay does God change his mind 1965 uh
[1:38:11] April 27. now Jesus said just before the
[1:38:14] coming
[1:38:15] of the Son of God or the the second
[1:38:18] coming that this age that we lived
[1:38:21] through he come as son of man a prophet
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:28] because that fulfills the scripture
[1:38:30] Moses said the Lord your God shall raise
[1:38:32] up a prophet like unto me we all know
[1:38:35] that was Jesus don't we amen so we had
[1:38:38] to come according to the scripture a
[1:38:40] prophet he never called himself the son
[1:38:42] of God
[1:38:43] he called himself the son of man
[1:38:46] a prophet but now he is through the
[1:38:49] church age now he has been Son of God
[1:38:52] in the Millennium he'll be son of David
[1:38:55] sitting on David's throne but between
[1:38:58] this time and we find out by the
[1:39:00] scriptures he is to reveal himself again
[1:39:03] as son of man a prophet
[1:39:07] amen between this time if you check this
[1:39:11] thing
[1:39:13] but now he is through the church age now
[1:39:15] he has been Son of God in the Millennium
[1:39:17] but he'll be son of David sitting on
[1:39:19] David's throne but between this time we
[1:39:22] find out by the scripture is to reveal
[1:39:24] himself again a son of man a prophet
[1:39:26] because the word of the Lord
[1:39:28] comes to prophets only never to
[1:39:31] theologians it is the prophets and the
[1:39:35] Lord said he did nothing in his
[1:39:36] unchanging word we just talked about
[1:39:38] until first he shows His prophets at the
[1:39:41] end time them Seven Seals that this
[1:39:44] bride has sealed up the Sevenfold
[1:39:46] mysteries of all Christ has to be
[1:39:49] revealed first and it can only be
[1:39:51] brought to a prophet
[1:39:53] we've been looking for that for years
[1:39:55] and we believe that his spirit is Among
[1:39:58] Us now
[1:39:59] when now amen we find so this is 1965
[1:40:03] but uh we're we we are the beneficiaries
[1:40:06] of this message and we've been uh we
[1:40:08] believe this by
[1:40:10] all of our hearts I believe otherwise we
[1:40:13] won't be here amen so that's why you see
[1:40:16] uh all this Revelations that came
[1:40:19] through that prophet of Malachi for
[1:40:21] Revelations 10 7 it's in us now right
[1:40:24] right now and uh we're just continuing
[1:40:26] it amen
[1:40:28] so so you can see
[1:40:31] son of man Son of God Son of David but
[1:40:34] between the Son of God and Son of David
[1:40:36] like what he said it's a son of man
[1:40:39] ministry again
[1:40:40] before the Millennium so it's very
[1:40:43] important when when when brother Branham
[1:40:45] is saying that because actually this one
[1:40:47] was corrected by Brother Ken I'm so
[1:40:49] thankful that brother can just
[1:40:51] cross-examine everything because uh I
[1:40:55] believe everyone should do that but then
[1:40:57] the thing is that's that's what we need
[1:41:00] to do because we were given a very good
[1:41:04] or very strong message very very
[1:41:06] powerful opening of the word then we
[1:41:09] must live accordingly right we must we
[1:41:12] must feed on it and uh and and check if
[1:41:16] if there's an error let's accept it
[1:41:18] right because correction is part of
[1:41:20] growing growing up right so we need to
[1:41:23] do that as brothers and sisters that's
[1:41:25] why we need the we're so thankful uh in
[1:41:28] with this church that it recognized the
[1:41:31] fivefold ministry
[1:41:33] other churches they don't right it's
[1:41:35] only it's either they just play tapes
[1:41:38] they're thinking that's the fivefold
[1:41:39] although the fivefold ministry is under
[1:41:42] the prophet of this age we're preaching
[1:41:44] this the message and the Bible under the
[1:41:46] prophetic Ministry of uh uh Malachi 456
[1:41:51] uh and and the prophet which is very
[1:41:52] Branham right so the question now is can
[1:41:56] you get raptured without this message
[1:41:58] it's it's
[1:42:00] I can say it's no because the thing
[1:42:03] there is the the opening of the word
[1:42:05] like Phil preached last Wednesday right
[1:42:09] it was not revealed to to all the ages
[1:42:13] even at the seventh loudish here with
[1:42:15] suspentecostal but during the bride it
[1:42:19] got revealed totally and uh we'll we'll
[1:42:22] check on that right so you can see son
[1:42:25] of man Son of God Son of Man now and
[1:42:28] before that and then it will go to
[1:42:30] Millennium but you can see
[1:42:32] this this small thing here
[1:42:35] the son of man Ministry Luke 17 30
[1:42:38] Revelations 10.
[1:42:40] let's enlarge it amen so uh
[1:42:47] this is composed of the seven Church
[1:42:49] ages you can see after Jesus Christ left
[1:42:52] so there's around 20 because 33 A.D he
[1:42:55] left and then uh Church ages started at
[1:42:58] 53.80 so there's about 20 years of Gap
[1:43:01] when when uh offices started right so
[1:43:05] that's the seven Church ages up to here
[1:43:08] this is the seventh Church ages up too
[1:43:10] loud this year but then I want to
[1:43:12] cross-examine
[1:43:14] dissect this uh small thing here
[1:43:17] so let's enlarge it
[1:43:21] okay
[1:43:27] Okay so
[1:43:30] if you can see
[1:43:33] it's it started in 1963 up to today
[1:43:38] that's the first Thessalonians 4 16
[1:43:40] because the seven seal was opened
[1:43:43] in 1963.
[1:43:45] right when
[1:43:47] we'll discuss more on this Cloud because
[1:43:49] this is a very controversial one but get
[1:43:51] just revealed it to me while studying it
[1:43:53] to to put something into perspective I
[1:43:56] might be wrong but uh it looks uh when
[1:44:00] you checked further you would know that
[1:44:02] uh this cloud has very good significance
[1:44:06] in I mean it's an important milestone
[1:44:09] for this message amen because if you
[1:44:13] don't have this how would you uh put or
[1:44:16] tie things together right the seven seal
[1:44:19] Revelations 10 1 and he was the one
[1:44:21] descending We Will We Will dissect that
[1:44:24] one by one later so so you can see if we
[1:44:28] put the shout voice and trumpet in a
[1:44:30] timeline
[1:44:31] it started from 1963
[1:44:34] up to today
[1:44:36] but then the thing is if you will check
[1:44:38] 1963 to 1965.
[1:44:41] that because if if the seals were opened
[1:44:45] actually they were opened even before
[1:44:46] Revelations five but then it was handed
[1:44:49] over to Briar Branham when he opened in
[1:44:51] March 17 1963. he was just revealing
[1:44:56] what was open because the the the mighty
[1:44:58] angel that came
[1:45:00] with this hand an open book so it means
[1:45:02] the sales were already loose but then
[1:45:05] what's the content of those sales it has
[1:45:07] to be rebuilt to profits that's why
[1:45:09] every day Branham is on that uh little
[1:45:12] room there and then he's praying and
[1:45:14] then all his thoughts were changed by by
[1:45:17] the Holy Spirit by the pillar of fire
[1:45:19] every time but then we're so blessed
[1:45:21] because he he corrected it through the
[1:45:24] prophet that's why it's so important to
[1:45:26] understand that we need a prophet right
[1:45:29] for this AIDS we we cannot just uh we
[1:45:32] cannot just say oh it's already revealed
[1:45:34] to me how it was revealed to you it's
[1:45:35] through the prophet Amos 37 very
[1:45:37] important amen so so you can see 1963 to
[1:45:41] 65 that's the shout
[1:45:43] and then it's continued with the voice
[1:45:45] actually shout shout is a loud voice
[1:45:49] right what is a shout when you're when
[1:45:52] someone is uh uh is in trouble you have
[1:45:56] to shout hey get out of there it's
[1:45:58] you'll be in trouble so it's a voice
[1:46:01] that came out
[1:46:02] right so a shout is a loud voice and
[1:46:05] then brother Branham was taken of the
[1:46:07] sin
[1:46:08] because Jesus Christ must increase same
[1:46:11] as what John the Baptist uh uh in John
[1:46:15] the Baptist ministry because Jesus
[1:46:17] Christ is already there right so he must
[1:46:19] decrease so that Jesus Christ can
[1:46:21] increase so in this case Brian branham's
[1:46:23] Ministry he already uh being the uh
[1:46:27] elizar he already introduced Christ to
[1:46:30] us
[1:46:31] and we are married to Christ already so
[1:46:34] he must decrease so that Christ can come
[1:46:36] out of us we're being impregnated by the
[1:46:39] word of God so that we can be full full
[1:46:43] grown matured matured person in the in
[1:46:47] the uh representing Christ in this world
[1:46:50] Amen that's that's the maturing process
[1:46:52] we will uh represent Christ up to the up
[1:46:56] to the trumpet amen up up to the Trump
[1:46:58] of God meeting in the air so that's the
[1:47:00] ministry we have it's so important amen
[1:47:03] I cannot over emphasize so 1963 to uh to
[1:47:08] present is the voice Ministry and we're
[1:47:10] continuing that after brother Branham
[1:47:13] left and now the trumpet
[1:47:16] which is the actual literal coming it's
[1:47:19] a question mark because we don't know
[1:47:21] the exact hour
[1:47:23] right so who who can say even even
[1:47:26] brother Branham he said the I predict I
[1:47:28] don't prophesy it's 1977 but it didn't
[1:47:31] it didn't happen naturally but then
[1:47:34] spiritually we know it happened because
[1:47:35] uh uh America became dark the world
[1:47:39] became dark you see what's happening
[1:47:40] right now it's oh it's so dark in this
[1:47:43] world right now that the only light is
[1:47:45] because of the presence of the Bride
[1:47:46] amen so this Trump
[1:47:49] this actual Rapture but then the thing
[1:47:52] the whole thing is a process we received
[1:47:55] the message of the hour and the voice
[1:47:58] that is in the bride right now is
[1:48:01] continuing and preaching to the lost but
[1:48:04] the bride will accept
[1:48:07] only the bride will accept this message
[1:48:08] because this is a this is a rapturing
[1:48:11] message amen uh all those denominational
[1:48:15] thing including the Pentecostal because
[1:48:17] uh I I would say even even here I will
[1:48:21] prove to you with many many uh scripture
[1:48:23] many
[1:48:24] quotes that we are at the bride age
[1:48:27] we've been telling that we're at the
[1:48:28] bride it's we're at the bride age let's
[1:48:30] let's be open right and then uh enjoy
[1:48:34] what brother Branham said and then let's
[1:48:36] compile them together amen so seven
[1:48:39] Church ages so you can see here the
[1:48:41] cloud it's in Revelation 10.
[1:48:44] and uh uh the church is just up to load
[1:48:47] this year but then let's continue
[1:48:50] so the son of man Ministry
[1:48:53] is the bride age you can say
[1:48:55] because this one is where when the seals
[1:48:58] were opened
[1:49:00] then you're living
[1:49:02] you can say because you're you're
[1:49:04] Eternal bound
[1:49:06] even though you die you still gain to
[1:49:10] live with Christ to die his game whether
[1:49:12] you die or you live it doesn't matter
[1:49:14] because you're just changing Dimension
[1:49:16] right and and the and when the word was
[1:49:19] fully manifested and and and uh and
[1:49:22] opened up even Daniel like brother Phil
[1:49:24] was preaching it was not even allowed
[1:49:27] for him to to uh to reveal it and to
[1:49:30] write it seal it up up to this end and
[1:49:32] we're so thankful Branham is saying what
[1:49:35] age do you want to live I want to live
[1:49:37] in this age because it's the Golden Age
[1:49:39] although it's a difficult age we can we
[1:49:42] can find there's so many distractions
[1:49:43] it's so hard to focus
[1:49:46] is saying the only reason why we're
[1:49:48] still here is because the bride is
[1:49:50] taking care I mean uh thinks of the
[1:49:53] cares of this world right one of the
[1:49:56] reasons you can say we think so much of
[1:49:58] the cares of this world that uh we're
[1:50:00] losing focus
[1:50:01] and we're so thankful God is doing
[1:50:03] something in this church you can see the
[1:50:05] the progression here
[1:50:07] Bradbury is uh it will be he will be a
[1:50:10] full-time pastor and uh you you can see
[1:50:13] that and of course uh uh like what I've
[1:50:16] said the fivefold ministry is so
[1:50:18] important and we we are very thankful
[1:50:20] that he recognized that and uh and and
[1:50:23] we know Ephesians 4 11 is for the
[1:50:27] perfecting of the Saints edification of
[1:50:29] the church right until we come in unity
[1:50:32] and we will find in this last age that
[1:50:35] all the ministers must be United it must
[1:50:38] not be a a show or whoever is better or
[1:50:41] what right we need each other and even
[1:50:44] brother Branham said the bride has a
[1:50:47] Ministry the bride meaning everyone even
[1:50:50] though those who are not uh behind this
[1:50:52] Pulpit he said is composed of this
[1:50:55] fivefold
[1:50:56] right so I I believe it that's it is the
[1:50:59] rising of the sand anyway so you can see
[1:51:02] Let's uh
[1:51:05] so uh I put something here because God
[1:51:08] just revealed this to me while while
[1:51:10] reading about this Cloud because it's
[1:51:12] very controversial
[1:51:14] they're saying because uh the cloud was
[1:51:17] photographed February 20 1963. but then
[1:51:20] that at that time Branham was not uh in
[1:51:25] uh was not hunting yet because the time
[1:51:28] for hunting it's March 1st to March 10th
[1:51:31] I believe I I did the research here bear
[1:51:34] with me
[1:51:35] I
[1:51:38] so in 1963 it is uh March 1st to March
[1:51:43] 10th that's the javelina hunting season
[1:51:46] in Arizona okay but the the photograph
[1:51:51] was taken
[1:51:53] February 20 1963. so those who are
[1:51:57] Skeptics those who who are defectors of
[1:52:01] this message they they put that as a big
[1:52:03] deal because this one this cloud is a
[1:52:05] very important uh uh milestone in the
[1:52:09] message and an important event right so
[1:52:12] I put together something so let's
[1:52:15] discuss a little bit
[1:52:17] uh February 28th
[1:52:19] This Cloud was photographed as a live
[1:52:23] magazine I believe and then brother
[1:52:26] Branham in his uh uh life story you can
[1:52:30] see he was hunting March 8th
[1:52:34] March 8th with the with brother Gene
[1:52:37] Norman brother saltman right that's uh
[1:52:40] when the vision of uh seeing a
[1:52:43] cockleberry on his pants right and then
[1:52:46] there was an explosion that's March 8th
[1:52:49] so it means he's not against the law
[1:52:52] he's not violating any law because other
[1:52:55] people are saying if Brian Branham was
[1:52:57] their February 28 it means he's
[1:52:59] violating the law because it it must be
[1:53:01] March 1st to 10th but then you can see
[1:53:04] in his life story he even went to to
[1:53:06] Houston first before going uh uh you
[1:53:09] know before coming back right and then
[1:53:12] have that hunting Javelin hunting okay
[1:53:15] let's let's do some principles so
[1:53:18] remember that February 8th evening
[1:53:20] that's when the the
[1:53:24] uh the cloud was photographed and then
[1:53:26] March 8th that's when the vision was
[1:53:28] fulfilled that Vision was mentioned in
[1:53:31] the is this the time of the answer right
[1:53:33] so that is in 1962 I believe in uh that
[1:53:38] is this the time of the end
[1:53:41] uh okay there you go
[1:53:44] uh bear with me okay December 30 1962.
[1:53:49] he is not sure of what that vision is
[1:53:51] all about about that explosion right but
[1:53:55] uh uh is it is going to be dead and uh
[1:53:59] but he's asking the Lord for for for uh
[1:54:03] for answers right so he he didn't know
[1:54:06] but then the thing is that that hap he
[1:54:08] explained that vision and then in March
[1:54:11] 8 that Vision was fulfilled okay let's
[1:54:14] uh so February 28th to March 8th okay so
[1:54:18] let's uh
[1:54:20] let's do some prophetic time principle
[1:54:23] so in in Ezekiel 4-6 and when thou has
[1:54:27] accomplished them lie again on thy right
[1:54:29] side and thou shall bear the iniquity of
[1:54:31] the house of Judah 40 days I I have
[1:54:34] appointed the each day for a year
[1:54:37] just for
[1:54:39] background here and then in numbers 1434
[1:54:42] after the number of the days in which he
[1:54:45] searched the land even 40 days each day
[1:54:49] for a year shall you bear your
[1:54:50] iniquities even 40 years and you shall
[1:54:53] know my bridge or promise if you check
[1:54:57] these two scriptures you can deduce or
[1:55:00] conclude that one day is one year
[1:55:02] prophetically because there are other
[1:55:05] prophetic principles like one day is a
[1:55:07] thousand years and so on and one week is
[1:55:09] seven years right so but for this one we
[1:55:13] we just want to check hindsight because
[1:55:15] uh we're we're students of this message
[1:55:18] and the Bible we we need to check if
[1:55:20] we're really interested in that let's
[1:55:22] just check right so I might be wrong but
[1:55:24] uh bear with me if I'm not but the thing
[1:55:26] there is uh we just try to prove
[1:55:28] something here so prophetic time
[1:55:30] principle so one day and what is one
[1:55:32] year okay so half an hour space in
[1:55:35] Revelations
[1:55:37] eight one to two let's read it all
[1:55:40] together uh it's there anyway
[1:55:48] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:55:51] there was a silence in the heaven about
[1:55:54] the space of half an hour
[1:55:56] and I saw the seven angels which stood
[1:55:59] before God
[1:56:00] amen
[1:56:01] so let's do something calculation right
[1:56:04] it's a bit of a
[1:56:07] Sunday school and then let's do some
[1:56:10] mathematics as well so half an hour
[1:56:15] is
[1:56:19] uh half an hour is 0.5 hour right so if
[1:56:24] we uh
[1:56:26] if we multiply one day to 24 hours
[1:56:30] right
[1:56:31] and then one year
[1:56:34] per day
[1:56:35] that's our principle a while ago
[1:56:37] multiplied by 360 days per year for a
[1:56:40] prophetic day
[1:56:42] what will be the result
[1:56:45] seven and a half days
[1:56:46] so now I'm just deducing from February
[1:56:49] 28 1963 evening
[1:56:52] to March 890s because uh that Vision was
[1:56:56] fulfilled the blast it's around 8 8 in
[1:56:58] the morning so but the the photograph
[1:57:00] was was taken 1963 evening so let's
[1:57:04] count February 28th that's already
[1:57:07] evening March 1st second third fourth
[1:57:10] fifth sixth seventh and then on the 8th
[1:57:13] in the morning so how many days are
[1:57:15] those
[1:57:15] seven and a half so while it is
[1:57:18] photographed it's between the Earth and
[1:57:20] Heaven it's on the bridge
[1:57:22] right and then at the seven and a half
[1:57:25] day brother Branham was caught up by the
[1:57:28] seven angels
[1:57:30] right so
[1:57:31] I'm having Goosebumps now because the
[1:57:34] thing is I'm just trying to prevent them
[1:57:35] when I was reading it I was so thankful
[1:57:38] that oh Lord thank you for such thing I
[1:57:41] mean can you disprove it now I mean even
[1:57:43] by calculation right so even this is
[1:57:47] similar to the 70 weeks of Daniel where
[1:57:50] where brother Branham was saying but
[1:57:51] then he corrected it but then you have
[1:57:53] to put together so that because brother
[1:57:56] randomly is a Vindicated Prophet right
[1:57:57] he might it might not have been rebuilt
[1:58:00] previously but then God corrected him
[1:58:02] later on after the opening of the seals
[1:58:05] but we don't correct Branham we he is
[1:58:08] corrected by the word
[1:58:09] amen we don't have that authority to
[1:58:12] correct him it's the word that will
[1:58:13] correct him amen so seven and a half day
[1:58:16] so it was photographed and then at March
[1:58:19] 10 on March 8th he was caught up so if
[1:58:22] you check it's it's almost perfect about
[1:58:24] space of half an hour the the Bible is
[1:58:27] saying it's not exact about about the
[1:58:30] space of half an hour it didn't say
[1:58:32] exactly half an hour but then the thing
[1:58:33] when you calculate it with prophetic
[1:58:35] Ministry with the principles in the
[1:58:37] Bible it's exactly seven and a half
[1:58:39] hours amen who I'm so I'm so thankful I
[1:58:42] just thought that I have to put this I
[1:58:44] just bought it today well while in that
[1:58:46] room because the thing there is it just
[1:58:48] came to me last night and then oh I have
[1:58:49] to put it at least at least to prove
[1:58:51] that the cloud is a Vindicated cloud and
[1:58:54] that's Jesus Christ himself descending
[1:58:57] amen
[1:58:58] and then and at the same time if you
[1:59:01] check the second verse here and I saw
[1:59:03] the seven angels we stood before God who
[1:59:05] are those seven angels the seven Church
[1:59:07] age Messengers amen the Perfection you
[1:59:12] can see amen and that's why that's why
[1:59:14] those who are thinking that the the
[1:59:16] seven the the seven seal is not open yet
[1:59:20] let's let's think about this one maybe
[1:59:22] just put you on on a thinking uh uh Pro
[1:59:26] as a student perspective you always
[1:59:28] question something right you want to
[1:59:30] prove something when when Jesus Christ
[1:59:33] came down Revelation 10 1 he already
[1:59:37] brought the open book so it means all
[1:59:40] the Seven Seals are already loose
[1:59:41] because otherwise it's not open
[1:59:43] but then it was handed over to to Briar
[1:59:46] Branham although you mentioned uh the
[1:59:48] first seal was open the second seal was
[1:59:49] open but actually the book was open but
[1:59:52] in Revelations 5 it was still closed but
[1:59:55] then when he descended and then this
[1:59:57] this uh uh this cloudus Photograph
[2:00:00] that's the thing that we will
[2:00:02] cross-examine Revelations 10 1-7 verse
[2:00:05] five verse later if we have time 11 30.
[2:00:07] so let's uh let's move on
[2:00:10] I'm just so thankful uh uh with
[2:00:13] Revelation amen
[2:00:15] so let's continue so so March 28 96
[2:00:19] today evening to March 8 1963 morning
[2:00:21] that's exactly seven and a half days
[2:00:24] so uh so going back to our topic
[2:00:27] actually uh the reason why I put all
[2:00:30] these things is uh
[2:00:32] to to understand what the bride means
[2:00:35] right because uh we are bride of Jesus
[2:00:39] Christ we always say that because it's
[2:00:40] in the message but then
[2:00:42] we have to know what it means because
[2:00:44] there are different definitions and we
[2:00:47] must put the proper definition right
[2:00:49] where we belong okay I mean where where
[2:00:53] uh where it is applicable to us okay so
[2:00:57] definition of the bright by Noah Webster
[2:01:00] 1828
[2:01:01] it's a woman newly married
[2:01:03] so the topic is still the process of the
[2:01:06] Rapture in the bride right so it's
[2:01:08] important to know what a bride means uh
[2:01:11] that but the name is applied to a woman
[2:01:13] at the marriage Festival
[2:01:16] before she is married as well as after
[2:01:19] the ceremony so that's a woman newly
[2:01:23] married
[2:01:23] a woman a spouse or contracted to me to
[2:01:26] be married is also a bride but in in our
[2:01:30] context
[2:01:32] if you already accepted the message and
[2:01:34] it's being in process right now then
[2:01:37] you're not espoused or contracted to be
[2:01:39] married you're already married amen and
[2:01:42] we'll prove that by by many quotes let's
[2:01:45] let's do some uh
[2:01:48] some study here by Strong's uh
[2:01:52] uh
[2:01:54] Strong's Bible concordance
[2:01:56] it's in Hebrew 3618.
[2:01:59] the first one it's called Kala
[2:02:02] so from it's it's called a bride as if
[2:02:06] perfect hence a son's wife bright
[2:02:10] daughter-in-law spouse so it means uh
[2:02:13] this is the the Hebrew meaning about in
[2:02:17] Greek it's called nymphet
[2:02:19] from a primary but obsolete verb
[2:02:26] a young married woman as well including
[2:02:29] a betroth Girl by implication a son's
[2:02:31] wife bride daughter-in-law so you can
[2:02:35] see uh it just proved that Noah's
[2:02:37] dictionary is correct there there are
[2:02:40] different definitions
[2:02:43] and uh in Spanish
[2:02:46] they call it Novia actually brother uh
[2:02:50] who's that brother Aaron McGarry
[2:02:52] preached that I think one time in uh in
[2:02:55] bar Chad's thing because uh in Spanish
[2:02:58] they called them Novia but actually a
[2:03:01] Novia means a bride a woman on her
[2:03:03] wedding day a girlfriend a person's
[2:03:06] regular romantic companion or fiance a
[2:03:09] woman to whom someone is engaged so in
[2:03:12] checking this which one is applicable to
[2:03:15] us
[2:03:16] right
[2:03:18] a person's regular romantic a woman to
[2:03:20] whom someone is engaged a woman on her
[2:03:22] wedding day
[2:03:23] so on wedding day but then for us I want
[2:03:26] to proceed with this so that we can
[2:03:28] check
[2:03:30] Revelations 19 7-9 let us be glad and
[2:03:33] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[2:03:35] merits of the lambis camp and his wife
[2:03:37] had made herself ready and her was
[2:03:41] granted that she should be a raid in
[2:03:42] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[2:03:44] linen is the righteousness of saints and
[2:03:47] he said unto me right blessed are they
[2:03:50] which are called unto the married supper
[2:03:52] of the lamb and he said unto me these
[2:03:54] are the true sayings of God why why I am
[2:03:57] I am emphasizing this is because the
[2:04:00] Rapture which is the Trump is going to
[2:04:02] the marriage supper we're not going to
[2:04:04] the wedding we're going to the marriage
[2:04:06] supper amen and uh you see here
[2:04:12] the next proving his word
[2:04:15] uh now remember that was not Jesus
[2:04:18] talking to Abraham there that could
[2:04:20] discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind
[2:04:22] behind him that was not Jesus he had not
[2:04:25] yet been born but it was a man in human
[2:04:27] flesh that Abraham called Elohim the
[2:04:30] great Almighty showing and Jesus said as
[2:04:33] it was in the days of Sodom now what's
[2:04:34] close in the days of Sodom so will it be
[2:04:37] at the coming of the son of man when the
[2:04:38] son of man is being revealed not no more
[2:04:41] as a church see not no more the bride is
[2:04:44] called see in that day the son of man
[2:04:46] will be revealed what to do to join the
[2:04:49] church to the Head unite very important
[2:04:52] word unite the marriage of the Bride
[2:04:56] amen the bridegroom call will come right
[2:04:59] through this when the son of man will
[2:05:01] come down and come in human flesh to
[2:05:03] unite the two together the church has to
[2:05:06] be the word he is the word
[2:05:09] and the two unites together and to do
[2:05:12] that it will take the manifesto
[2:05:14] manifestation of the revealing of the
[2:05:16] son of man that's why now it's so
[2:05:18] important to put the things together we
[2:05:20] are in the son of man Ministry in the
[2:05:22] bride right now let's continue not a
[2:05:25] clergy man
[2:05:28] I don't know do you see what I mean see
[2:05:30] it's
[2:05:31] son of man Jesus Christ will come come
[2:05:34] down in human flesh Among Us
[2:05:36] and will make his word so real that it
[2:05:39] will unite the church and him as one
[2:05:42] the bride and then she'll go home to the
[2:05:45] wedding supper
[2:05:47] right amen she's already United very
[2:05:50] important she's already united we have
[2:05:52] already the consummation see we go to
[2:05:54] the Mary the wedding supper not to the
[2:05:56] marriage fill your flesh self of all the
[2:05:59] Flesh of mighty man because the merits
[2:06:01] of the Lamb has come but the rapture
[2:06:04] amen Rapture is going to the wedding
[2:06:08] supper when the Lord when the word here
[2:06:10] unites with the person and they too
[2:06:13] become one and when they does it and
[2:06:16] then what does it do then it manifests
[2:06:19] the son of man again not the church
[2:06:22] theologians the son of man the world and
[2:06:26] the church Capital C very important it's
[2:06:28] not the small C amen becomes one
[2:06:31] whatever the son of man done he was the
[2:06:35] word the church does the same thing
[2:06:37] amen very powerful the invisible Union
[2:06:41] of the Bride
[2:06:43] oh that spiritual union of Christ and
[2:06:45] his church now when the flesh is
[2:06:48] becoming word
[2:06:50] and the word is becoming flesh
[2:06:52] manifested Vindicated just what the
[2:06:55] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[2:06:58] happening day by day that's why it's a
[2:07:00] process day by day as we feed on the
[2:07:02] world
[2:07:03] amen we become the word amen because
[2:07:05] that seed belongs to him amen we just
[2:07:08] need to be in the presence of the Sun
[2:07:10] s-o-n so that we can mature amen why
[2:07:13] it's cumulate accumulating so fast out
[2:07:16] there in those deserts and things taking
[2:07:18] place that I couldn't even keep up with
[2:07:21] we're near the coming of Jesus to be
[2:07:24] United with this church where the word
[2:07:26] becomes the word called the call of the
[2:07:29] Holy Spirit searching the hearts
[2:07:32] amen whoa so now uh let's summarize the
[2:07:37] marriage process by those coats let's
[2:07:40] let's put them together juice natural
[2:07:42] which is the sry lights and you
[2:07:45] spiritual the bride let's let's do I I
[2:07:48] reduce it to four steps so that this is
[2:07:50] easier the first step
[2:07:53] in
[2:07:54] a natural juice marriage is you have to
[2:07:58] have a decision
[2:08:00] right and then you can have an
[2:08:02] engagement and then you will go with the
[2:08:04] marriage ceremony
[2:08:05] and then you will have consummation
[2:08:08] that's the first step
[2:08:10] and then after that you go to the
[2:08:12] marriage supper which is the feast
[2:08:13] that's the second step
[2:08:16] right you're already United before going
[2:08:18] to the marriage supper amen and then
[2:08:20] after that what will you do you go
[2:08:22] honeymoon
[2:08:23] right and then after honeymoon you live
[2:08:26] together that's the process of the
[2:08:29] natural natural marriage how about the
[2:08:32] bride
[2:08:35] the first step is Christian maturity
[2:08:38] when you accepted Jesus Christ you will
[2:08:40] feed on the word which is the Bible
[2:08:42] until you become mature as a bride
[2:08:45] because Jesus Christ cannot marry an
[2:08:48] immature bride
[2:08:49] we have to be mature amen
[2:08:52] so so you can see there up to
[2:08:55] consummation it means Christian maturity
[2:08:58] to Invisible Union which is now
[2:09:00] when we feed on the word we are being
[2:09:02] united with him we are in consummation
[2:09:06] with him
[2:09:07] right we we are already married with him
[2:09:12] then we can go to the Second Step which
[2:09:14] is meeting in the air until the three
[2:09:16] and a half years of tribulation that's
[2:09:18] why we're going to the marriage supper
[2:09:21] not not to the marriage because we are
[2:09:24] already United otherwise we will commit
[2:09:26] fornication if we are not married and we
[2:09:28] are already being united with him
[2:09:30] amen it's so good also to know that a
[2:09:32] marriage is a marriage certificate
[2:09:34] typically it's not a marriage contract
[2:09:36] sometimes they use marriage contract
[2:09:37] because contract most of the time has
[2:09:39] end
[2:09:41] you're already married so once you're
[2:09:43] married with crisis forever
[2:09:46] amen
[2:09:48] meeting in the air and then what will
[2:09:50] happen in this meeting there and within
[2:09:52] these three and a half years
[2:09:53] Jesus Christ will reveal himself to the
[2:09:55] 144 000 and where is the pride at this
[2:09:58] time he's in the palace
[2:10:01] amen that's why the the the verse
[2:10:05] scripture used by Brother Branham I
[2:10:07] think is it Psalm 27 or Psalm 25 where
[2:10:09] he will hide me in his Pavilion
[2:10:12] while there's tribulation
[2:10:15] oh Bride of the Jesus the Lord Jesus
[2:10:18] Christ know who you are amen no let us
[2:10:21] know who we are because we are so
[2:10:24] privileged amen so this is the one we're
[2:10:27] waiting for right now but then after
[2:10:29] that the honeymoon is saying is the
[2:10:32] Millennium to rule with the ride of iron
[2:10:34] right and then Millennium the Time and
[2:10:38] Eternity will blend and that is the new
[2:10:40] Heaven and new earth the New Jerusalem
[2:10:43] amen isn't that beautiful if we if we if
[2:10:46] we put things into perspective amen
[2:10:49] we're so thankful amen
[2:10:56] so
[2:10:57] the bride age you can see
[2:10:59] Let's uh uh let's try to to read the
[2:11:03] most of the quotes So that at least we
[2:11:06] can finish something so we are in the
[2:11:08] bright age this is the this is the one
[2:11:10] we're waiting for and this one is
[2:11:12] happening right now right the shout and
[2:11:14] the voice it's only the Trump that we're
[2:11:16] waiting which is the married supper amen
[2:11:18] which is a gathering Feast amen so
[2:11:21] Ministry of the Bride in this last eight
[2:11:23] we know
[2:11:24] that uh this one and the voice which I
[2:11:27] heard I'll just read it so you don't
[2:11:29] need to open your your Bible revelations
[2:11:31] 10 8-11 and the voice which I heard from
[2:11:33] Heaven speak unto me again and said go
[2:11:35] and take the little book which is open
[2:11:37] in the hand you see open in the hand of
[2:11:40] the angel with standeth upon the sea and
[2:11:43] upon the Earth and I went on to the
[2:11:46] angel and said unto him give me the
[2:11:48] little book and he said unto me take it
[2:11:51] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[2:11:52] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[2:11:54] mouth sweet as honey
[2:11:56] and I took the little book out of the
[2:11:58] Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was
[2:12:00] in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon I
[2:12:02] had eaten it my belly was bitter and
[2:12:05] then and he said unto me thou must
[2:12:07] prophesy again before many peoples and
[2:12:10] Nations and tongues and Kings if if we
[2:12:12] if we just do a quick one here there are
[2:12:14] three again three steps you have to eat
[2:12:17] the word right John is the type of the
[2:12:19] Bride he was the one who who took the
[2:12:22] open word open book from the angel it
[2:12:26] means he's feeding the word fully and
[2:12:29] then there's no there's no uh there's no
[2:12:32] more seals in it and he ate it right but
[2:12:35] then if you if you check uh verse 10
[2:12:37] here in my mouth is sweet as honey
[2:12:40] because it's it's the message of the
[2:12:42] hour when you when it was revealed to
[2:12:44] you it's like
[2:12:47] so sweet in the mouth but then when you
[2:12:50] realize when you live according to it
[2:12:52] it's so bitter
[2:12:54] it's so hard to live according to the
[2:12:56] message of the hour because it's
[2:12:57] Perfection right but Perfection needs a
[2:13:00] lot of pruning
[2:13:02] it's like grape right when when you
[2:13:05] prune the grape it will bear more fruits
[2:13:06] so that that pruning is like tribulation
[2:13:09] amen or Affliction right in this in this
[2:13:13] uh or trials and sufferings all these
[2:13:15] things will perfect our character right
[2:13:18] and it's so important right it might be
[2:13:20] difficult but God is faithful and he
[2:13:24] doesn't see our sin because we are
[2:13:27] already covered by the blood and that is
[2:13:29] already effective amen but you have to
[2:13:31] accept it although he came for everyone
[2:13:33] but only the ones who will believe
[2:13:35] completely will be saved and have
[2:13:38] everlasting life but uh you can see a
[2:13:41] lot of people that don't believe in God
[2:13:44] right but I have mercy on them but we're
[2:13:46] so thankful God just revealed it to us
[2:13:48] meaning believe is a very very important
[2:13:52] word because it means you will receive
[2:13:55] the word completely you will act
[2:13:57] accordingly right there's no doubt
[2:14:00] that's why the the original sin is
[2:14:02] unbelief in the word of God that's why
[2:14:04] he said John 3 16 right believe in the
[2:14:06] word and you will be saved amen so it
[2:14:09] was bitter in the belly because you have
[2:14:11] to live according to the message but
[2:14:13] then the third one or maybe just to give
[2:14:16] a
[2:14:17] how how can you uh what's the antidote
[2:14:20] of this uh bitter in the belly you have
[2:14:23] to eat the word over and over again at
[2:14:25] least it will it will be combined with
[2:14:27] the sweet in the mouth and bitter in the
[2:14:29] belly then you will be used to it right
[2:14:31] so I you know bitter are good typically
[2:14:34] in the old days medicine are bitter
[2:14:37] right but now they change the the taste
[2:14:39] so that it's easy it can be easily taken
[2:14:41] by children right but even the the old
[2:14:43] people they don't want bitter things but
[2:14:45] then it's good for us right amen just a
[2:14:49] paraphrasing or whatever so but the 11th
[2:14:52] one you see what what what this is and
[2:14:55] he said unto me thou must prophesy again
[2:14:58] before many peoples and Nations and
[2:15:00] tongues and Kings prophesy again because
[2:15:04] all the previous ages they already
[2:15:06] prophesied even the the prophesied right
[2:15:09] but for us now prophesy again
[2:15:12] meaning preach again teach again we have
[2:15:15] to bring this message of the hour right
[2:15:18] to every person that we will meet then
[2:15:21] if they will accept it
[2:15:23] praise the Lord right but only the bride
[2:15:26] will accept this message of the hour
[2:15:27] that's uh Branham is so clear we are
[2:15:31] preaching to the lost right now but only
[2:15:33] the bride will accept amen so we must
[2:15:35] prophesy again to all people all nations
[2:15:38] tongues and Kings that's a strong thing
[2:15:40] that's why we have missionaries we have
[2:15:43] Apostles right so we need to reach we
[2:15:45] have evangelists all over the place we
[2:15:47] but if you cannot do it ourselves we
[2:15:49] have to send someone who who who who who
[2:15:52] can do that right and and I'm seeing a
[2:15:54] lot of baptisms still in the in the name
[2:15:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ everywhere then
[2:15:58] they have been their Facebook and and
[2:16:00] wherever so it means God's still calling
[2:16:02] amen and we're so thankful and we must
[2:16:05] extend that as much as possible amen so
[2:16:07] let's uh
[2:16:10] let's read the completely I have only 10
[2:16:12] minutes or so let's ask Christ was the
[2:16:15] first one to raise this is it is the
[2:16:17] rising of the Sun from all the prophets
[2:16:19] and so forth although typed in many
[2:16:21] places he was the first fruit
[2:16:23] first fruits of those that slept in the
[2:16:26] bride coming of Christ
[2:16:29] so much on this one in the bride this
[2:16:33] comma here
[2:16:34] it made a difference right bright coming
[2:16:37] of Christ this is this is our age but in
[2:16:40] the bride if you will check it with the
[2:16:42] Kama in the bride coming of Christ but
[2:16:44] actually when you hear it from maybe you
[2:16:48] can check it yourself you're English
[2:16:49] people so you you might understand it
[2:16:51] better than me uh so
[2:16:54] in the bright coming of Christ that's
[2:16:56] totally different when in the bride and
[2:16:58] then coming of Christ coming out of the
[2:17:00] church they'll have to be a shift wave
[2:17:02] in the last days Oh my he said waving
[2:17:05] off the ship that what was the shift the
[2:17:08] first one that come to mature the first
[2:17:10] one that proved it was a wit that proved
[2:17:13] it was it was a chief Hallelujah I'm
[2:17:15] sure you see what I'm talking about it
[2:17:17] was waived over the people
[2:17:20] and the first time there will come forth
[2:17:22] for the bright age
[2:17:24] for a resurrection out of dark
[2:17:27] denominationalism will be a message
[2:17:30] that the full maturity of the word
[2:17:33] has turned back again in its full power
[2:17:36] and being waived over the People by the
[2:17:39] same signs and wonders that he did back
[2:17:41] there amen bright age this is proving
[2:17:45] the that we are in the bright age
[2:17:47] although what we see out there is love
[2:17:49] this year but I'm saying we're on top of
[2:17:52] love this year and we are leaving the
[2:17:54] bright age because we accepted this
[2:17:55] message of the hour amen let's continue
[2:17:59] the invisible Union of the Bride
[2:18:01] I'll just go with the 324. the word that
[2:18:04] fell on the day of Pentecost
[2:18:06] will will not work this day no sir that
[2:18:10] was for Pentecost this is for the bride
[2:18:13] going home of the Bride we got something
[2:18:16] different the Pentecostals represented
[2:18:18] that again we're in the bright AIDS no
[2:18:21] more than the word of Noah would work in
[2:18:24] the days of Moses no more than Moses low
[2:18:26] would have worked in the day in the time
[2:18:27] of Paul here he tried to tell them you
[2:18:30] are dead to that and you cannot have
[2:18:31] that thinking of that
[2:18:33] the the message of Pentecost during the
[2:18:36] apostles the 120 people in in that Upper
[2:18:40] Room
[2:18:41] that message will not be enough for us
[2:18:44] that's the reason why they were not
[2:18:46] ruptured yet they are waiting for us
[2:18:48] because the word is not fully revealed
[2:18:50] at that time amen so we're so thankful
[2:18:53] although the message of Pentecost is the
[2:18:56] whole thing is for love this year but
[2:18:57] 1963 onwards we we as bright were lifted
[2:19:01] up and then we are now in living in this
[2:19:03] bright age with the full manifested word
[2:19:06] of the hour amen so let's continue
[2:19:09] I I have to rush here so uh
[2:19:13] I have heard but now I see
[2:19:17] you can see uh the Pentecostals
[2:19:20] I should say not none of the rest of
[2:19:23] them that's the shock
[2:19:26] on the wheat that come out look just
[2:19:28] exactly like the wheat but there was no
[2:19:30] wheat to it it opens up
[2:19:33] but the grain comes out of that amen
[2:19:36] they organize they kill themselves
[2:19:39] that's where they die their stocks
[2:19:42] but the wheat has come out through there
[2:19:45] and now it's begin to form in the bride
[2:19:47] form amen the corner that fell into the
[2:19:50] ground through Dark Ages it had to die
[2:19:53] there should be that so that there there
[2:19:55] can be life after and let's continue and
[2:19:59] then you see that critic saying why
[2:20:00] would the god of Mercy could open up the
[2:20:02] Red Sea stand and let them poor
[2:20:04] Christians eat up with lions and burnt
[2:20:06] and everything set up just like he
[2:20:08] laughed about
[2:20:12] fall into the ground it had to die
[2:20:15] through those Dark Ages like any other
[2:20:17] corn of wheat has to go beneath the
[2:20:19] Earth and be buried to bring forth in
[2:20:21] the First Reformation them two blades of
[2:20:24] Luther the stock it had to comfort in
[2:20:27] the Westlands out the under to bring
[2:20:29] forth the pollen the tassels the great
[2:20:32] missionary AIDS had to comfort in the
[2:20:35] Pentecostal for the restoration of the
[2:20:37] gifts almost to deceive the very elected
[2:20:40] the Pentecostal is so close to the
[2:20:43] message that it will deceive the very
[2:20:44] elect but then during our fellowship
[2:20:47] with brother Paul right now it's not uh
[2:20:49] it's not uh determining what uh I mean
[2:20:52] you will not be deceived by right and
[2:20:54] wrong because you know wrong exactly
[2:20:56] it's it's between deception of right and
[2:20:58] almost right
[2:21:00] amen because almost right is almost like
[2:21:02] the the the shock right you thought that
[2:21:05] it's the pure wit but then that's just a
[2:21:07] covering the the true City it's in
[2:21:10] inside and but it will deceive the very
[2:21:13] elect it possible but we're so glad it's
[2:21:15] not possible to be deceived amen because
[2:21:18] of this message of this hour for sure
[2:21:20] which is Christ in us the hope of glory
[2:21:22] the word will vindicate the word will
[2:21:23] will correct the air amen
[2:21:26] let's continue now it's begin to pull
[2:21:29] away the wits begin to be seen this is
[2:21:33] not Pentecostal age this is the latter
[2:21:37] day age this is the bride age this is
[2:21:41] the evening light this is when Malachi 4
[2:21:44] must be fulfilled to follow God's
[2:21:46] partner pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be
[2:21:49] fulfilled amen this is second Jeremiah
[2:21:51] and all the rest of them that Joel has
[2:21:53] spoke of these days this is that day I
[2:21:55] am heard Lord and it was coming but now
[2:21:58] I see with my eye thank you Lord for
[2:22:00] that understanding amen
[2:22:03] maybe uh yeah uh let's read 56 here
[2:22:07] we're not living in a Pentecostal age
[2:22:10] this is in modern events uh uh made
[2:22:12] clear by prophecy we're living in
[2:22:14] another age see we're not living in the
[2:22:17] into in the matter this age we're living
[2:22:19] in another age we're living on up here
[2:22:23] to the bride age the calling out of the
[2:22:26] church Capital C and getting it together
[2:22:28] for the Rapture that's exact that's the
[2:22:31] age that we're now living to my honest
[2:22:34] opinion that's exactly the truth amen he
[2:22:36] said praise the Lord so I'll I'll uh
[2:22:40] there are so many uh
[2:22:44] there are so many quotes that you can
[2:22:46] just uh check just just put the bride
[2:22:50] age you will find it's just to prove
[2:22:52] that we are really in the practice
[2:22:54] because some some might be questioning
[2:22:56] it uh where's love this year then right
[2:22:58] we are on top of laodicea right because
[2:23:01] there are only seven Church ages so it
[2:23:03] means bright age even even when you
[2:23:05] think about it it's uh Branham called it
[2:23:08] in in the future room as the Eighth Day
[2:23:11] why because we are Eternal being it
[2:23:14] means whether you live or you die you
[2:23:16] will still go to to Millennium and then
[2:23:18] to Eternity so it means you're already
[2:23:20] Eternal
[2:23:21] Eternal bound amen that's why we're for
[2:23:24] us accepting the full message of the
[2:23:27] hour is eternity for us amen we're so
[2:23:30] thankful no wonder other people are
[2:23:33] misplacing that they're saying they're
[2:23:34] already living in the in in Millennium I
[2:23:37] I spoke with a person who who said that
[2:23:39] he's leaving the Millennium but I told
[2:23:41] him if that's the case did you change
[2:23:43] your body
[2:23:45] and then he if I put a knife on you you
[2:23:50] will you be hurt or will you bleed then
[2:23:53] he said yes so I believe Branham is so
[2:23:56] clear chains of body means you'll be in
[2:23:58] a glorified body
[2:24:00] amen so yeah so so all these things I I
[2:24:04] and I told him if you have an issue on
[2:24:07] on or or if just you heard this from
[2:24:09] somebody because they are preaching the
[2:24:11] two Soul Doctrine from from a person in
[2:24:14] in in in the US and then but the thing
[2:24:16] there no matter what Doctrine you've
[2:24:18] been you've been listening to you have
[2:24:20] to check the life of that person if it
[2:24:22] if it manifests the word and then they
[2:24:25] promote polygamy adultery so so how can
[2:24:29] you how can you follow such man and then
[2:24:32] we were in Zoom then we have a Bible
[2:24:34] study in very deep I told him brother I
[2:24:36] cannot impart Revelation to you but
[2:24:38] anything that you have a question let's
[2:24:40] put it together we are in Zoom I will I
[2:24:43] will put it on the screen tell me the
[2:24:45] code that you're talking about
[2:24:48] you know that's that's how it is right
[2:24:50] we we must we must be diligent in
[2:24:53] seeking knowing what the message is
[2:24:55] because it's on our fingertips anywhere
[2:24:57] you go even in your washroom or driving
[2:24:59] you can hear it and everything if you
[2:25:01] have doubt just press you know you check
[2:25:03] it
[2:25:05] that's the reason why it uh Branham
[2:25:09] really hated the nominationalism right
[2:25:10] because it's man over man
[2:25:12] right and we're so thankful that the uh
[2:25:16] Brian Branham just put that in the open
[2:25:19] even ourselves raken was preaching you
[2:25:22] can be a denomination of yourself if you
[2:25:24] have your own idea oh Lord help us today
[2:25:27] Lord that uh we will just remove all
[2:25:30] this denominational taking thinking we
[2:25:32] should empty ourselves so that the full
[2:25:34] word can come amen a fully surrendered
[2:25:37] vessel for a fully surrendered person is
[2:25:39] omnipotent why is
[2:25:42] if he is dead because Christ can or God
[2:25:45] can use him fully
[2:25:47] whether he put it on the left we will go
[2:25:49] left we will put it on the right he will
[2:25:51] go right he will not have any reasoning
[2:25:53] oh Lord I don't want to go there because
[2:25:55] they're Sinners oh if God commissioned
[2:25:58] us to go somewhere we have to do it if
[2:26:00] God say do this we have to do it amen as
[2:26:03] long as it's in the word amen and and
[2:26:05] God this uh he never changed he's the
[2:26:09] same yesterday today and forever and he
[2:26:10] will never fail amen if we have that
[2:26:13] seed that seed must come to pass
[2:26:15] mature must be quick and amen by the
[2:26:18] word amen who praise the Lord let me let
[2:26:22] me continue
[2:26:24] so uh
[2:26:26] it's almost 12 maybe maybe I'll call the
[2:26:28] musicians I'll just uh continue this I
[2:26:31] still have
[2:26:32] a lot of things here but uh
[2:26:35] let me let me just uh maybe I'll call
[2:26:38] the musicians uh
[2:26:40] maybe there's so many good parts here
[2:26:43] but I don't want to just run them down
[2:26:45] maybe next time I'll do it
[2:26:48] uh
[2:26:51] so maybe I'll just end this I know uh
[2:26:54] brother
[2:26:55] Brad Gilbert puts this last last time I
[2:26:57] guess just to to show some something
[2:27:00] here although we're talking about the
[2:27:02] bride and if he's mature but but then
[2:27:04] this thing is about full adoption also
[2:27:07] uh just just so that I can end it this
[2:27:10] way
[2:27:11] uh Genesis 25 1-6
[2:27:14] then again Abraham took a wife and her
[2:27:17] name was Katura and she bear him zimran
[2:27:20] and jokshan and maiden and Midian and
[2:27:22] ishback and shua and jokshan began Shiba
[2:27:26] and didn't and the sons of dedan were
[2:27:29] assurim and letoshim and Liam and the
[2:27:33] sons of median
[2:27:35] IFA
[2:27:38] and Elda
[2:27:40] all these were the children of Keturah
[2:27:44] and Abraham gave all that he had unto
[2:27:47] Isaac but Unto the Sons of the
[2:27:49] concubines which Abram had
[2:27:52] Abraham gave Gibbs and sent them away
[2:27:56] from Isaac his son while he had lived
[2:27:59] Eastward and to the East Country if you
[2:28:02] check on this
[2:28:04] Abraham which
[2:28:06] you say type of God right the father he
[2:28:09] gave all that he had unto Isaac
[2:28:12] right the the the promised son but and
[2:28:15] to the sons of concubines Keturah is a
[2:28:17] concubine before right but then when
[2:28:20] when uh
[2:28:21] uh when Sarah died he married him her he
[2:28:26] married him and then he he became
[2:28:28] Abraham's wife later on when when Sarah
[2:28:31] died but before that she was a concubine
[2:28:33] you can check that in Chronicles you see
[2:28:35] the sense of the concubines they have
[2:28:37] the gifts they were given gifts but to
[2:28:40] the son Isaac he gave all
[2:28:44] it's just like full adoption full
[2:28:46] Authority and power right it was given
[2:28:49] to us what else can we ask for
[2:28:53] full adoption right and then on the
[2:28:56] other end if you were a bride of Christ
[2:28:59] the secret
[2:29:01] is given to you
[2:29:03] right so
[2:29:06] Pride of the living
[2:29:08] God Amen Saints of the Living God
[2:29:11] brothers and sisters we must be so
[2:29:14] thankful and we must not doubt that we
[2:29:18] don't have the Holy Ghost sometimes
[2:29:20] because the thing is when it is given to
[2:29:22] us we are sealed until the day of our
[2:29:25] Redemption
[2:29:26] right although we make mistakes because
[2:29:29] we're still in the flesh
[2:29:30] but we are quick to repent because
[2:29:34] that's the character of a bride he
[2:29:36] doesn't want to make mistakes he want
[2:29:38] she wants to please her Lord
[2:29:41] she wants to please her God Amen forgive
[2:29:44] us when we fail but then we have a blood
[2:29:46] that is bleeding right now and we're
[2:29:49] covered under the blood
[2:29:51] but and Satan cannot go under it
[2:29:53] otherwise he will become a brother
[2:29:56] right
[2:29:58] he cannot do that but he's he's very uh
[2:30:02] you can say smart right he can put
[2:30:04] something and then fish you out of that
[2:30:06] blood
[2:30:07] so sometimes we fail or or we backslide
[2:30:10] but it doesn't mean but don't go outside
[2:30:12] that blood
[2:30:13] don't go outside that token don't go out
[2:30:17] because that's a dangerous ground
[2:30:19] amen because that blood we are sinners
[2:30:23] Say by Grace amen we were born uh
[2:30:27] shaping iniquity born speaking lies so
[2:30:29] it means our color is red
[2:30:31] right but then the blood of Christ red
[2:30:34] to red
[2:30:35] it will become white so he doesn't see
[2:30:38] us
[2:30:39] committing sin anymore right he he we
[2:30:44] make mistakes yes but we are covered by
[2:30:46] the blood but don't take this that you
[2:30:48] can always uh think that you can always
[2:30:51] do it because it's also said those who
[2:30:54] sin willfully
[2:30:55] right uh
[2:30:58] I think that is in Hebrews yeah right so
[2:31:01] we don't want to Sin willfully Sin means
[2:31:04] unbelief we don't want to unbelieve the
[2:31:07] world willfully Amen when we make
[2:31:10] mistake we must repent right now
[2:31:12] immediately amen so you see just closing
[2:31:16] here so that at least we know we are in
[2:31:18] the process of the rapture
[2:31:21] process means we must go we must undergo
[2:31:25] steps
[2:31:27] amen and and going steps is painful
[2:31:30] sometimes right but then we have to do
[2:31:32] it amen every single thing
[2:31:35] even adoption
[2:31:37] we must go process Assam cannot be given
[2:31:41] the The Inheritance right away without
[2:31:44] being tutored by the holy spirit amen
[2:31:47] until he matures and and be qualified to
[2:31:51] accept all those
[2:31:52] amen even
[2:31:54] the Rapture itself we have to know the
[2:31:58] full message right and then we are the
[2:32:01] voice of this generation
[2:32:03] continuing right imparting the word that
[2:32:07] is uh given to us
[2:32:09] amen and then uh we
[2:32:12] we look for that less predestinated City
[2:32:14] man if that that last predestinated
[2:32:17] cities already in the fold he must also
[2:32:20] mature
[2:32:21] right so there's a process amen and we
[2:32:25] must accept that uh when we have all
[2:32:27] these things God is in control
[2:32:29] God knows what we need amen and uh
[2:32:33] despite of what's Happening we know we
[2:32:36] we can have coffee we have kovid before
[2:32:39] brother Paul at covet but we have a
[2:32:41] Healer hey man
[2:32:43] what can we ask for that attribute must
[2:32:46] manifest in US amen so why do we need to
[2:32:50] worry why do we need to doubt right
[2:32:55] it's just Faith or doubt that's why that
[2:32:57] Soul it must that nature must change
[2:32:59] right the nature is not the soul itself
[2:33:01] that will that will die and uh or or
[2:33:05] will be changed with another Soul that's
[2:33:07] the that's the doctrine of the two Souls
[2:33:09] but then the thing is it's the it's the
[2:33:12] life that will that will that will count
[2:33:14] it will just prove what you received
[2:33:16] then
[2:33:20] amen the wool will come out automatic
[2:33:23] for us when we feed the word what will
[2:33:25] come out the fruit of the holy spirit
[2:33:27] amen love joy peace long-suffering
[2:33:29] gentleness fruit not fruits because when
[2:33:32] you have love you have everything
[2:33:34] beautiful I must stop that right now
[2:33:37] otherwise
[2:33:38] maybe next time we will continue
[2:33:41] God is good I hope you're blessed my
[2:33:43] brothers and sisters
[2:33:44] [Applause]
[2:33:47] 1200 messages if you think about it it's
[2:33:50] so huge this message is huge but it all
[2:33:53] boils down to one thing Christ in us the
[2:33:55] hope of glory amen Christ in us we will
[2:33:59] be the walking Christ we will be the
[2:34:01] walking word the walking epistle right
[2:34:05] read by all man when they see us
[2:34:07] wherever we go even at the in the office
[2:34:11] they will know that uh
[2:34:13] we are
[2:34:14] Believers of this word
[2:34:17] maybe I'll just uh I'll just give you

[2:34:26] I think I mentioned that we were given a
[2:34:28] very big project again praise the Lord
