[11:05] night when everyone is busy and uh Lord,
[11:08] with the cares of this world, with the

[11:26] to us, Lord, as we see the day
[11:28] approaching, Lord. We don't want to,
[11:30] [music] Lord, take this for granted,
[11:32] Lord, because this is really a privilege
[11:34] to be here, oh Lord Jesus, and to be
[11:37] together with believers of like precious
[11:40] faith, Lord. And when we are in one
[11:42] accord, Lord, one mind and one accord,

[22:52] [music]
[22:58] [music]
[23:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Welcome to the
[23:03] house of the Lord.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Certainly an honor and a privilege to
[23:06] gather together once again in his
[23:09] [music] name.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just
[23:12] make it known unto him by way of an
[23:13] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[23:17] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[23:19] this day. We know this day is the day
[23:22] that you have made.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; And Father, we will rejoice and be glad
[23:26] in it.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that if there's a
[23:30] trial and there's a tribulation, it's
[23:32] because you have allowed it in our
[23:34] lives. And it's for a purpose, Lord. And
[23:37] help us to recognize that, Lord Jesus,
[23:39] [music] that there's no accidents,
[23:41] there's no mishaps, Lord Jesus.
[23:43] Everything happens [music] for a purpose
[23:46] according to your will. And tonight,
[23:48] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that we
[23:50] can gather [music] here as our brother
[23:52] prayed. Lord, we do not take it for
[23:54] granted, Lord.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; We don't know how many days we have here
[23:57] on this side of eternity where we have
[24:00] this kind of freedom, Lord Jesus.
[24:02] [music]
[24:02] And Father, if it were ever taken away
[24:04] from us, would we ever look back and
[24:06] wonder, did we have more to give you?
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this
[24:11] opportunity, Lord. And father, we just
[24:13] invite you to have your will and your
[24:15] way in this service, Lord, in our hearts
[24:17] and our minds, Lord. [music]
[24:18] Help us to see less of ourselves, Lord,
[24:20] and more of you tonight, Father.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just want to remember
[24:24] each and every request that was made
[24:26] known unto you tonight by the way of an
[24:29] uplift hand, Father, by faith, [music]
[24:31] Lord Jesus, by defying gravity, Lord, to
[24:34] say, "Be it unto me according to the
[24:36] promises contained in your word, which
[24:39] is your will." Father, tonight we just
[24:41] want to continue to uphold the Natarak
[24:43] family before you, Lord. It's just
[24:46] [music] a difficult situation, Lord. And
[24:48] I know, Father, there's questions in
[24:50] their hearts wondering why it has to be
[24:52] this [music] way. Father, that boy never
[24:54] did anything on this side wrong. But
[24:57] Lord, we know many times we don't have
[25:00] to ask why.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; We just trust you, Lord, that you're in
[25:03] control.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; And we know one day the disciples asked
[25:06] you, "Why was that boy blind?
[25:10] And father, they wondered, was it
[25:11] because of sin
[25:13] &gt;&gt; in his life? Was it because of sin in
[25:15] his parents' [music] life? And you
[25:17] corrected them and you told them that it
[25:19] was so that your power could be
[25:21] manifested
[25:22] &gt;&gt; on this side, Lord. So that we could
[25:24] recognize that you are more than a man,
[25:27] &gt;&gt; that you are more than a prophet. And
[25:29] Father, tonight you are the same
[25:31] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; And we claim that, Lord. Father, many
[25:37] times it seems so difficult to even
[25:40] understand, but Lord, you never called
[25:42] us to understand.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; You asked us to believe
[25:46] &gt;&gt; and we do, Father.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[25:48] &gt;&gt; and Lord Jesus, at the same time, help
[25:50] thou our unbelief, Father.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight we pray that you
[25:54] would bless the Natarak family, Lord.
[25:57] Make yourself so real to Zach Natarak
[26:00] tonight. We ask, oh, Father, and thereby
[26:02] the rest of the family. strengthen them
[26:05] and encourage them, we ask, Father,
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight as we turn to your
[26:09] word, we just ask, Father, that you
[26:11] would be glorified in all that's said
[26:13] and done.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you the
[26:16] thanks.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all
[26:19] of these things in Jesus Christ's name
[26:21] we [music] pray.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you musicians. God bless you
[26:27] [music] once again for your service in
[26:30] the house of the Lord. But if you have
[26:32] your Bibles tonight, I would like to
[26:33] continue on with our discussion, our
[26:36] study from uh Corinthians
[26:40] about the gifts. 1 Corinthians chapter
[26:44] 12.
[26:46] I was looking back on the notes and it
[26:47] seems it's been quite a while since we
[26:50] spoke on the on the gifts and uh
[26:53] certainly excited to get back into it
[26:55] again. It's been a real blessing for me
[26:58] and I hope it has for you and uh we just
[27:01] trust the Lord will have his way as we
[27:04] go through this little study here.
[27:07] In 1 Corinthians 12 verse one says, "Now
[27:10] concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
[27:12] would not have you ignorant that you
[27:14] know that ye were Gentiles carried away
[27:17] unto these dumb idols, even as ye were
[27:21] led.
[27:23] Wherefore I give you to understand that
[27:25] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[27:27] calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man
[27:31] can say that Jesus is Lord but by the
[27:34] Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of
[27:38] gifts but the same Spirit and there are
[27:40] differences of administrations
[27:42] but the same Lord and there are
[27:44] diversities of operations but it is the
[27:48] same God which workketh all in all.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the manifestation of the
[27:53] spirit is given to every man to profit
[27:56] with all.
[27:58] To one is given by the spirit the word
[28:01] of wisdom. To another the word of
[28:05] knowledge by the same spirit. To another
[28:08] faith by the same spirit. To another the
[28:12] gifts of healing by the same spirit. To
[28:15] another the working of miracles. To
[28:18] another prophecy. to another discerning
[28:21] of spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[28:25] tongues, to another the interpretation
[28:29] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[28:33] one and the self-same spirit dividing to
[28:37] every man severally as he will. For as
[28:41] the body is one and hath many members,
[28:44] and all the members of that one body,
[28:46] being many, are one body, so also is
[28:51] Christ.
[28:53] For by one spirit are we all baptized
[28:56] into one body, whether we be Jews or
[28:59] Gentiles, whether we be bond or free,
[29:02] and have been made have been all made to
[29:06] drink into one spirit. For the body is
[29:10] not one member but many.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[29:15] Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we
[29:17] can gather together tonight as many
[29:19] members of your body.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; We pray that you would just express to
[29:24] us your word which is your will tonight
[29:26] one more time. Father, in Jesus' name we
[29:29] pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. You
[29:31] may be seated.
[29:34] Just a few announcements tonight. Um, we
[29:37] have the prayer meeting tomorrow night
[29:38] at 7:30.
[29:40] If you uh have the desire, we certainly
[29:43] welcome you to come. Just wanted to
[29:46] remind us we have brother Maxwell Bang
[29:48] Jr. here on January the 24th at 6 PM.
[29:52] January the 25th will be a Sunday
[29:54] service at 10:00 a.m. So that's a
[29:57] Saturday night service and a Sunday
[29:58] morning service. We're certainly excited
[30:00] to see him. He is over in Ireland right
[30:03] now and uh he'll be coming back here
[30:06] soon. We have the uh January youth
[30:09] meeting I believe. Is it the 25th? It's
[30:12] changed a bit but I think I got that
[30:15] right for a change. And we have the uh
[30:18] youth service as well on January the
[30:20] 30th. Are you happy tonight?
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; I'm certainly thankful to be back
[30:26] &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord. And I just
[30:28] want to want to say something before we
[30:30] get going too far. And that is [snorts]
[30:32] I hope you know my heart. My heart's
[30:35] desire is that I really appreciate each
[30:37] and everyone especially the service in
[30:40] the house of the Lord. And uh on Sunday
[30:44] it seems that I said some stuff under
[30:47] I'll say it under anointing because it
[30:49] wasn't even really my vocabulary. But I
[30:52] I mentioned about the ensemble and uh by
[30:56] no means would I ever want to criticize
[31:00] anyone for their efforts to bring forth
[31:03] a special or to actually play an
[31:06] instrument in the house of the Lord. And
[31:08] I can tell you for sure there's been
[31:10] times in my life where as in even in the
[31:12] pastor role where I've thought that
[31:15] doesn't sound right or that that sounds
[31:17] different or something needs to be done
[31:19] about that. But the Lord said to me,
[31:20] "No, what you need to do is sit down and
[31:23] pray about it. You don't need to say a
[31:25] word about it to anybody." And uh I've
[31:28] done that in the past and I've seen
[31:31] circumstances change.
[31:34] So I just want to say that if if
[31:36] anything that I said did offend anybody,
[31:39] I truly sincerely apologize for the
[31:43] offense because I certainly would never
[31:45] want to do that. But at the same time, I
[31:48] want to explain that when we're under
[31:50] the anointing of preaching, things can
[31:54] be said. And sometimes they have they
[31:58] have a meaning. And uh you know, one of
[32:01] the things that I also mentioned was
[32:02] speeding. And I'll tell you, if it
[32:06] wasn't for anyone else, it was for me.
[32:08] It was for me because you know what I've
[32:11] done constantly, continually, I'm not
[32:13] going to lie about it. And maybe someone
[32:15] can prosecute me for even saying this on
[32:17] film, but I have driven continually um
[32:20] 10 kilometers over, 20 km over.
[32:23] Sometimes I like to step my foot on the
[32:25] gas pedal and feel some acceleration.
[32:28] I'm not going to lie about that,
[32:29] especially when going up a hill. But,
[32:32] you know, when the Lord speaks, we have
[32:34] the opportunity to listen or not.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; And and I don't know exactly what that
[32:39] was addressing pertaining specifically
[32:41] to the the word ensemble.
[32:44] Just to be clear, we had those musicians
[32:47] playing the stringed instruments
[32:50] in our living room the night before and
[32:53] they were practicing this and it was
[32:55] amazing. I have video of it. [laughter]
[32:58] I I would no way ever criticize.
[33:03] I actually took it seriously to heart
[33:06] when I'll just be honest with you. My
[33:08] wife said to me, "Do you know what you
[33:10] said? I'm so thankful for a wife that
[33:13] supports me in the ministry because it
[33:15] really checked me. It made me think, why
[33:17] would I even say that word? That's not
[33:19] my vocabulary.
[33:21] And that triggered something in me. It
[33:23] made me think maybe I ought to go and
[33:24] look it up. And so I did that. And you
[33:27] know, it doesn't speak. I thought that
[33:28] it would speak about an orchestra or
[33:30] stringed instruments because I really
[33:33] felt checked about this, but it doesn't
[33:36] say anything about that. It talks about
[33:38] musicians in general. It talks about
[33:40] acting. I could read the description.
[33:42] You could look it up. I just want you to
[33:44] know my heart. I would never ever ever
[33:47] directly throw off on anyone
[33:49] individually. If I had an issue, I would
[33:52] come to you directly and speak to you
[33:54] just like the word says because that's
[33:56] the direction of the word. So, um,
[34:00] honestly, I don't understand it
[34:02] sometimes, but we just want to trust the
[34:04] Lord and hope that the the the
[34:08] leadership of the Lord is actually
[34:09] what's coming through and it's not the
[34:11] humanity of a man.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; So, just so you know, my heart, I uh
[34:17] greatly appreciate the music and
[34:19] especially that, you know, I I'll just
[34:21] have to say a little more about it. that
[34:23] stringed uh stringed instrument, call it
[34:27] ensemble,
[34:28] call it special, whatever we want to
[34:30] call it. On Sunday, it was beautiful
[34:32] because uh we were talking about it in
[34:34] our living room. The first time I saw
[34:36] two violins playing was up at Brother
[34:38] Eugene's church in a service. Um we
[34:42] haven't had violins here for uh I think
[34:44] forever until the Livies came. But
[34:48] the first time I I heard that two
[34:51] violins playing together, it was the
[34:53] special. It was a special and and the
[34:55] two violins began playing and they kind
[34:57] of went back and forth with their music.
[34:59] But something happened about halfway
[35:01] through that special and both violins
[35:04] became one sound.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; And that's what happened here on Sunday,
[35:08] I believe.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; It was tremendous.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; It was really, really good. I have no
[35:13] criticism about the string special that
[35:16] happened here on Sunday. So, just want
[35:19] to be absolutely crystal clear about
[35:21] that. That's my heart. We're talking
[35:24] about spiritual gifts and uh you know
[35:27] it's out of the scripture in 1
[35:29] Corinthians chapter 12. My heart's
[35:31] desire with this has been for the
[35:33] duration of it up until now to remind us
[35:36] that they are supposed to be in the
[35:38] church. Brother Bham said that every
[35:40] local church ought to see these gifts in
[35:43] their midst and uh we mustn't be afraid
[35:45] of them. And if we are afraid of them, I
[35:47] would say why are we afraid of them?
[35:50] Typically what happens is the the the
[35:53] preaching of men, the the doctrines of
[35:56] men become commandments. And uh what can
[35:59] happen over time is traditions can take
[36:01] over and we wind up being led by the
[36:04] ideology of men. And you know a
[36:07] denominational spirit is a very subtle
[36:09] spirit.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm preaching about it.
[36:12] Why I felt led to go down this road
[36:14] because these gifts are supposed to be
[36:15] in the body.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; We oughtn't to be afraid of them.
[36:18] There's no reason for us to be afraid of
[36:19] them other than perhaps some sort of
[36:22] teaching somewhere along the way that
[36:24] said this is wrong. Now, speaking in
[36:26] tongues, Brother Brandham would say, is
[36:28] not wrong.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; The way the Pentecostal church did it
[36:32] after the Isuza Street revival, it
[36:35] became something that became
[36:37] denominated. And instead of it being an
[36:39] an actual experience of Pentecost in the
[36:42] life of a given believer, what it became
[36:45] is a denomination. Brother Brandham
[36:47] talks about it over and over and over
[36:48] again through the message of the hour
[36:49] when I first came in. My background is
[36:51] Pentecost, the Pentecostal uh movement.
[36:55] Uh, so I actually started to take
[36:57] offense to it when I came in and around
[36:59] the message to hear how he talked about
[37:01] it. But it just became so clear when I
[37:04] was able to mature a little bit and
[37:06] understand that he wasn't talking about
[37:07] the individuals. He was talking about
[37:09] the anointed spirit behind the
[37:12] individuals, those people that would
[37:14] rather actually follow the leadership of
[37:16] a man instead of following the
[37:17] leadership of the Holy Ghost. And that
[37:19] can happen around the message of the
[37:21] hour. And that's why I'm talking about
[37:22] this. People can say flat out there can
[37:24] be no tongues because if we speak in
[37:26] tonesues then it's going to be
[37:27] incorrect. And you know what some people
[37:30] might believe that with all their heart
[37:31] and that's okay but the word of God says
[37:33] that it is supposed to happen and
[37:35] William Brham said it as well. But
[37:38] talking about the spiritual gifts we
[37:39] have the gift of knowledge. There's nine
[37:41] of them. Gift of knowledge, gift of
[37:43] wisdom, gift of faith, gift of healing,
[37:46] gift of working of miracles, prophecy,
[37:49] discerning of spirits, diverse kinds of
[37:51] tongues and interpretation of tongues,
[37:53] the nine spiritual gifts which are given
[37:55] to every man to profit with all. Now, I
[37:59] think it's beautiful when we look at
[38:00] this. Um, I I get a little blurry in
[38:04] where I remember things from because of
[38:06] the amount of interaction that I do. I
[38:08] I'm pretty social in terms of of
[38:11] fellowshipping around the word and a lot
[38:13] of it is online but uh just listening to
[38:17] the message and and so on and so forth.
[38:20] I heard it recently that you know the
[38:22] gifts in the church aren't actually
[38:25] necessarily individually given to a
[38:28] person so that they can bless their
[38:29] life. Their gift is for the others in
[38:32] the congregation.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; If I have a gift of discernment, it
[38:36] ain't for me. It's for you.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; If you have a gift of healing, it ain't
[38:41] for you.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; It's for someone else.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; If we have the gift of speaking in
[38:47] tongues, it's not for us. It's for
[38:49] somebody else. Because brother Bradom
[38:51] says very clearly according to the first
[38:53] church age messenger, Paul the Apostle,
[38:56] that if someone's going to speak in
[38:57] tonesues, there needs to be an
[38:58] interpretation of that speaking in
[39:01] tonesues. And it's not going to be blah
[39:04] blah blah quoting quoting the prophet.
[39:06] It's not going to be blah blah blah.
[39:08] It's going to be very specifically
[39:10] don't, brother Emanuel and Sister Helen,
[39:13] don't drive home the way that you
[39:15] normally drive home tonight. Drive home
[39:17] an alternate route because there's going
[39:18] to be a terrible accident. Thus saith
[39:20] the Lord. It will be a very specific
[39:23] directive by the Holy Ghost. It won't
[39:26] just be repeating a scripture. It won't
[39:27] just be quoting the prophet. It will be
[39:29] a very specific thing. We We don't need
[39:31] to be afraid of it. We've got direction.
[39:33] Paul the Apostle set the church in order
[39:36] all through the ages. They got mixed up
[39:38] and off the rails. And then the apostle
[39:40] or the prophet in the day in which we
[39:42] live, William Mary Brandham, came and
[39:44] put everyone right back in order, not
[39:46] with his own order, right back to Paul's
[39:48] order, to the original order. It's so
[39:50] beautiful. We have that direction in our
[39:53] our church in our lives. You know, where
[39:56] we left off last time was with the gifts
[39:58] of healing, I believe. And uh I just
[40:01] want to read one quote here out of 1964.
[40:03] Looking unto Jesus.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says, "In the name of
[40:08] Jesus Christ,
[40:10] I take every spirit in here under my
[40:13] control."
[40:16] The most powerful words I think that
[40:18] could ever be spoken by a human being on
[40:21] this side of eternity. Isn't it?
[40:23] I take every spirit in here under my
[40:26] control to declare the word of God.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; But who could actually say those words,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Many people can say them. And and we
[40:35] know, brother Brandham, he gives the
[40:37] example. It's so beautiful how he gives
[40:38] examples, right? He talks about the
[40:40] policeman standing out there on the
[40:42] street with a a 400 horsepower car
[40:45] coming down the road. And that policeman
[40:47] could go out and stand in front of that
[40:48] car and and show him his uniform and
[40:51] raise his hand up and that car can be
[40:53] revving down this the road and and not
[40:55] stop because who cares? It's a
[40:57] policeman. Brother Bradam says that's
[40:58] the way it is with a man. But if that
[41:01] man now takes out a badge and holds up
[41:04] that badge, that badge signals authority
[41:07] behind that man.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing with us and our
[41:12] voice, our words. If we take the token
[41:15] and hold it up with the authority of the
[41:17] Holy Ghost in us, it's a different
[41:20] story.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Bam says, "I take every spirit in here
[41:24] under my control to declare the word of
[41:25] God." Here is a picture tonight like St.
[41:29] John the 4th chapter. A man and a woman
[41:33] meet together, I suppose, for the first
[41:35] time. I don't know you. You probably
[41:38] know me by papers and hearsay, but I
[41:41] don't know you. You know that we're
[41:44] strangers to each other. Like our Lord
[41:46] met a woman one time at the well. A man
[41:50] and a woman meeting talking. But if I
[41:53] come like one of some of our brethren
[41:56] would say, "God gave me a gift of
[41:59] healing."
[42:01] You know what the gift of healing is?
[42:04] Faith in healing.
[42:07] Faith in healing. See, you just release
[42:11] your faith to pray for somebody. That's
[42:15] all a gift of healing is.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Every minister should have it.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Every minister should have it.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody see
[42:30] should have a gift of healing.
[42:32] This is I believe profound.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe how profound this is?
[42:38] Everyone, everybody see should have a
[42:42] gift of healing.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; The power that heals you is on the
[42:48] inside of you.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; You just have to let it work its way
[42:55] out.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; And that's why we gather together, isn't
[42:58] it?
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful when we think about
[43:01] this or talk about this? We just have to
[43:03] kind of find a venue, don't we? To just
[43:06] let that Holy Spirit work its way out.
[43:09] And I can only imagine what it would be
[43:11] like to be a musician. What it would be
[43:13] like to have a a way to express that
[43:16] that Holy Ghost that you have in your
[43:18] life to to let it work its way out. And
[43:21] you know, brothers and sisters, my
[43:23] heart's truest heart desire for the
[43:25] musicians is play from your heart. Let
[43:28] that Holy Spirit work his way out in
[43:32] your gift as you play.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; And any other way is going to be
[43:37] incorrect. And I believe that is the
[43:40] that's the gist of maybe what was being
[43:42] said on Sunday. If we're playing to
[43:44] perform, it's not going to achieve what
[43:47] we want. We want to let the Holy Ghost
[43:49] out through the music that we play,
[43:51] through the songs that we sing, through
[43:53] the worship that we have, so that the
[43:55] word of God can actually work his way
[43:58] out of us as well. I think it's so
[44:00] beautiful. The power that heals you is
[44:04] on the inside of you. The Holy Spirit,
[44:06] you just have to let it work its way
[44:09] out.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[44:13] Just like the life that's in the tree.
[44:15] You don't have to pour the apples in the
[44:18] tree to make it bear apples.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; It's just planted in the ground and it
[44:24] drinks and pushes out.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; And that's why we come to church, ain't
[44:29] it?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; So that we can drink and push out. So
[44:32] that we can eat and push out. And
[44:35] remember, part of it, unfortunately,
[44:37] Brother Brandham says it is that the
[44:39] wind has to blow and the trees need to
[44:42] stretch. And as they blow in the wind
[44:44] and the storm and they stretch back and
[44:46] forth, those roots that are holding it
[44:48] in, sometimes they're just barely
[44:49] holding on into the ground. But what
[44:51] happens is that ground softens up and as
[44:54] it drinks in, that tree drinks in and
[44:56] pushes out. It doesn't just push out the
[44:58] branches. It pushes roots deeper from
[45:01] [clears throat] those storms that
[45:02] stretch the ground underneath it.
[45:05] But it's already there. It just needs to
[45:08] drink in and push out. He says, "Well,
[45:10] that's the way you do the Holy Spirit.
[45:14] It's on the inside of you.
[45:17] You just drink from the inexhaustible
[45:20] fountain of Jesus Christ and it pushes
[45:24] out the fruits of the spirit." See,
[45:27] that's all we have to do is just drink
[45:30] from that inexhaustible fountain.
[45:32] And remember, one little spoonful of the
[45:36] ocean contains the entire ocean's
[45:39] elements.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; If we have one little spoonful, one tiny
[45:43] little measure of the Holy Ghost in our
[45:45] life, brothers and sisters, that's all
[45:47] we ever need.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; When that Holy Ghost spirit touches that
[45:52] seed gene of God, there is going to be a
[45:55] spark of life that takes place that we
[45:57] will not even be able to control.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; It's such a beautiful thing. Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; You know, if there's any gifts in the
[46:04] body, any gifts from the spirit, they
[46:06] all come from God.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; I think it's just a beautiful thought.
[46:09] The gifts, the gifts when they when
[46:12] they're there in our lives, we don't
[46:14] just get them one day. We have them
[46:17] always.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; We're born with the gifts.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And it's such an amazing thing to think
[46:22] about, isn't it? The gifts that we have.
[46:24] Every single gift comes from God.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Those genes were inside us before the
[46:29] foundation of the world. to have those
[46:31] gifts. And and you know, everybody in
[46:34] the world has gifts whether they
[46:35] recognize it or not. Everyone has gifts
[46:38] in their life. And some of the gifts are
[46:42] actually for good and some are for bad.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Because we know that power without
[46:49] character is what?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; It's satanic.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; And satanic isn't necessarily like we
[46:55] said the pentagram and the candles and
[46:57] all the worship that way. It's not that.
[46:59] It's actually one word off of the word
[47:02] of God is satanic. Let's be clear. We
[47:06] don't have to be a a a devil worshipper
[47:08] to be satanic. If we're not willing to
[47:10] follow the word of God, if we're going
[47:11] to resist the Holy Ghost, we're satanic.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; But the gifts that we have in our life,
[47:18] they're either anointed and and offered
[47:21] back to the Lord or they're offered back
[47:23] to Satan. They didn't come from Satan,
[47:25] but they're offered to Satan. and and
[47:28] they're going to be expressed one way or
[47:30] the other. But to think about the gift
[47:31] that he gives us, the spirit that
[47:34] anoints the gift. So if we have the Holy
[47:37] Spirit anointing our gift, we're going
[47:39] to see the right results with those
[47:41] gifts. But like we said earlier, the
[47:44] gifts that we have in our lives, they're
[47:46] for the entire body. They're to profit
[47:47] every man with all. They're not for
[47:50] ourselves. We're not supposed to take
[47:52] our gifts and hoard them for ourselves.
[47:55] We're supposed to actually offer them as
[47:57] a sweet savor unto the Lord. And I think
[47:59] it's so beautiful because many times
[48:01] that's not just coming to church and
[48:03] giving our our our gifts as a sacrifice.
[48:06] It's it's actually giving our gifts to
[48:08] the body.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; And not letting the right hand know what
[48:11] the left hand is doing
[48:13] &gt;&gt; because it's irrelevant whether it gets
[48:15] advertised or not. What's important is
[48:17] that he knows.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; He knows whether we're hoarding our
[48:20] gifts or not. And you know, we could get
[48:22] right into that that story and one day
[48:24] we might with the the gifts maybe when
[48:26] we start to wrap it up. But to take talk
[48:28] about the talent, the gifts of the
[48:29] talent, you know, it's it's a discussion
[48:31] about money and many times it's used
[48:33] about money and sure enough it applies
[48:35] that way. But I believe it also applies
[48:37] about the gifts, the talents that God
[48:38] has put in our lives. Are we just going
[48:41] to take those talents and and bury them
[48:43] and say, "I've got the talents and hoard
[48:44] them for myself, or am I going to
[48:46] actually go out there and multiply the
[48:48] talents? Am I going to teach someone
[48:50] something about what I know how to do?
[48:52] Am I going to encourage someone to do
[48:54] something with what I know how to do?
[48:57] There's a lot that we can do with the
[48:58] gifts that we have in our lives, but
[49:00] these gifts are for the entire body. And
[49:03] we rely on each other. I heard a brother
[49:06] say this and it just really really
[49:07] struck me. You know, the gifts in the
[49:09] body causes us to live in a symbiotic
[49:12] relationship,
[49:15] &gt;&gt; doesn't it?
[49:16] We live in a symbiotic relationship with
[49:19] the gifts because the gifts, someone
[49:21] might have one gift, someone might have
[49:22] another gift, but we rely on the body
[49:25] for those gifts.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; And how can we be an island and just
[49:29] live outside of a body, but still claim,
[49:32] I got the Holy Ghost and I believe the
[49:34] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. HOW DOES THAT WORK?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; I just don't understand it myself. But
[49:39] you know, it's so beautiful that we
[49:41] understand that we have these gifts in
[49:43] the body and they're for every one of us
[49:45] &gt;&gt; to profit for every one of us to do
[49:48] better, to increase. It's so beautiful,
[49:51] isn't it?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; It's to profit with all.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; So I was looking at this word with all
[49:57] G4851.
[49:59] It's pronounced sum furrow and it's to
[50:02] bear together.
[50:04] These gifts are so that we can bear
[50:07] together.
[50:09] Not bear apart.
[50:11] Not bear apart, but bear together. And
[50:13] and you know this this verse seven out
[50:16] of chapter 12 out of the Amplified Bible
[50:20] talking about this bear together with
[50:23] all says, "But to each one is given the
[50:27] manifestation of the Holy Spirit, the
[50:30] evidence, the spiritual illumination of
[50:34] the spirit."
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. for good and profit.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not talking about going out
[50:41] and turning a prophet turning a $100
[50:43] into a thousand and a thousand into
[50:45] 10,000 and a h 100,000 and a million.
[50:48] That's not what we're talking about.
[50:50] We're talking about spiritual profit,
[50:52] seeing our children serve the Lord.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Being able to see our children's
[50:56] children serve the Lord. being able to
[50:59] have a place, a sanctuary, a body of
[51:02] believers that we can see working
[51:04] together in this symbiotic relationship.
[51:07] I think it's beautiful though, the
[51:08] spiritual illumination of the spirit.
[51:12] Who doesn't want to see the spiritual
[51:14] elimination of the spirit? I think we
[51:17] all do. Tonight we're talking about the
[51:19] working of miracles. And uh you know, I
[51:22] just started thinking about this and uh
[51:24] I hope it's okay. Tonight I started
[51:26] thinking about how there's so many
[51:28] people in the Bible and and how they
[51:32] actually really brought miracles. There
[51:34] are so many miracles that happened. And
[51:36] we know that if there is a miracle that
[51:38] takes place in the Bible or in our lives
[51:41] that it's truly the Lord doing it. It's
[51:43] not us doing it. We know the book of
[51:45] Acts, the the Bibles are written the
[51:48] Acts of the Apostles. But we know we've
[51:50] one of the things that brother Brandham
[51:51] said, one of the mysteries that he
[51:53] clarified was it's not the acts of the
[51:55] apostles, it's the acts of the Holy
[51:57] Ghost in the apostles.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That just makes me think uh what are the
[52:02] acts of the Holy Ghost in Brother Barry?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; What are the acts of the Holy Ghost in
[52:07] in Calvary Living Word Assembly? What
[52:09] what are the acts of the Holy Ghost in
[52:11] in the bride body here on earth? you
[52:14] know, uh, one of them is probably
[52:16] working in of in of miracles, but I just
[52:18] started thinking about it in the Bible
[52:19] and and and and the people, the
[52:21] characters. And, uh, you know, Moses is
[52:24] one that comes to light in in my mind.
[52:26] And so, I started thinking about Moses.
[52:28] And, you know, talk about a life of
[52:30] miracles. Hey, he was called as a
[52:33] miracle before he even came to earth.
[52:36] The people were calling for a deliverer.
[52:39] And once they called for a deliverer
[52:41] enough 30 years overtime, the promise
[52:44] was for 400 years. And we know they went
[52:46] 430. In some places it says, I believe
[52:48] even 440. But he went the the children
[52:51] of Israel went over time and they
[52:54] started to call for a deliverer. And God
[52:56] sent them a deliverer. And we know that
[52:59] after he had been raised, he he came as
[53:02] a complete miracle as a baby. It it's
[53:05] interesting to look at his life because
[53:07] we Pharaoh recognized there was a
[53:10] prophecy.
[53:11] The sinners in the world recognized the
[53:14] prophetic utterance, right? And the
[53:17] reason he did or how I'm saying that is
[53:19] because he said, "Hey, if there is a
[53:21] deliverer here, potentially a baby boy,
[53:23] anything two years and under, kill him.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Feed them all to the crocodiles. Stab
[53:28] them with a knife. Kill those babies.
[53:30] Get rid of them." Pharaoh believed
[53:33] &gt;&gt; the prophecy,
[53:36] but Moses was a miracle, wasn't he?
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Because even through that prophetic
[53:41] utterance and and the actions of the
[53:44] sinner Pharaoh in the land, what
[53:47] happened was miraculously this baby was
[53:49] saved. And and what happened is this
[53:51] baby wasn't just saved. This baby went
[53:53] to the house of the enemy.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And the enemy saved this baby. And the
[53:58] enemy said, "This baby has to have a
[54:00] nursing mama somewhere. Where is she?
[54:02] Get her. Bring her to the palace and get
[54:05] her to nurse this baby." It's amazing to
[54:08] think about,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:10] &gt;&gt; This guy's full of miracles in his life.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Once upon a time, he was out on the back
[54:15] side of the desert. Just to fast
[54:17] forward, we know that he killed a man.
[54:18] He had to run away. He he was out there.
[54:22] But what happened was that pillar of
[54:23] fire came down and and rested in a bush.
[54:27] That pillar of fire came and visited
[54:29] this guy. Another miracle.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And we know that God in that pillar of
[54:34] fire said, "I'm just going to wait and
[54:36] see. As soon as I catch his attention,
[54:39] when God caught his attention, then he
[54:41] spoke to him out of that burning bush."
[54:45] So many miracles in this guy's life.
[54:47] Just amazing. And you know, I'm going to
[54:50] say this now, but we're going to keep
[54:51] saying it tonight. One of these days,
[54:54] we're going to say, "Moses, what was it
[54:55] like all of the miracles?" And he's
[54:58] going to say, "Well, you know, we'll get
[55:01] to that. But what was it like for you
[55:03] &gt;&gt; to live IN THAT TIME COMING OUT OF
[55:06] Leadyia into that little tiny space
[55:08] where there's SUPPOSED TO BE NO LIGHT IN
[55:10] THE BRIGHT AGE? WHAT WAS IT LIKE to live
[55:13] with all of the devils poured out of
[55:16] hell upon the earth? you were able to
[55:19] overcome all of that. How did YOU DO
[55:21] THAT? HOW DID THOSE MIRACLES happen in
[55:23] your life? It makes me think, brothers
[55:25] and sisters, the devil doesn't want us
[55:27] to see miracles in our life. How many
[55:29] times are there miracles in our life?
[55:31] How many times do we go to sleep and the
[55:34] devil's desiring to take our life this
[55:37] night?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; But the angel of the Lord says, "Nope,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; not yet."
[55:42] How many times does the devil desire to
[55:45] give us a virus?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; But the angel of the Lord says, "Nope.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Not this one."
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; How many times a car accident? How many
[55:55] times a financial ruin? HOW MANY TIMES A
[55:58] DIVORCE? HOW MANY TIMES A A CHILD
[56:00] separated from their parents? But the
[56:03] angel of the Lord says, "Nope, not this
[56:05] family. Nope, not this one. Not this
[56:07] car."
[56:10] It's amazing to think about.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; We're talking about us in parallel while
[56:15] we talk about these heroes of the Bible.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the internet in their
[56:20] those days, did they?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; They never had all of the temptation of
[56:25] the senses in those days.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But here we are.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Somehow someway we have the desire to
[56:32] come to church on a Wednesday night.
[56:34] That's got to say something to us.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] You look at at Moses and how he lived
[56:40] his life. And you know when God finally
[56:43] got his attention from that burning bush
[56:45] and told him, "Moses, you're going to
[56:48] actually turn around and you're going to
[56:49] go right back down and you're going to
[56:51] go into Egypt and you're going to take
[56:53] over. It's going to be a one-man
[56:55] invasion of Egypt." Can you imagine what
[56:58] must have gone through his head? He knew
[56:59] the inner workings of the palace. He
[57:01] knew the inner workings of Pharaoh and
[57:03] his armies.
[57:05] But yet here he is now,
[57:08] the old man with a stick in his hand and
[57:11] a wife and a baby heading down to Egypt.
[57:13] He's going to go take over. Brother
[57:14] Brandham says it that way. Where you
[57:16] going, Moses?
[57:18] Where you going with that stick in your
[57:19] hand, Moses? He's going down to take
[57:21] over. A one-man invasion of the greatest
[57:24] army on earth, the greatest nation on
[57:26] the planet.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God. Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; So, he gets down there and then, you
[57:34] know, we could talk about every one, but
[57:36] I'm just going to I'm just going to
[57:38] cruise over them because there's lots
[57:39] more to talk about tonight. But think
[57:41] about all the plagues, all of those
[57:43] working of miracles that he did rather
[57:47] that God did through him.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; And what happened was he just listened
[57:53] to the voice of the Lord. And even when
[57:55] God was calling him, isn't it
[57:57] interesting when God was telling him,
[57:59] "You're going to go down there and
[58:00] you're going to do all this stuff.
[58:01] You're going to just do what I say."
[58:03] Even when he was having the
[58:04] conversation, the initial introduction,
[58:06] the the burning bush, he said, "But but
[58:08] but but I stutter. But but but how could
[58:10] I ever do this? But I'm not an eloquent
[58:12] man. But I I I have this. But I have
[58:15] that. All of the other all of my flesh.
[58:17] Look at my imperfections." And God said
[58:20] to him, "You know what? Just go do what
[58:22] I say.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're going to be just fine.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Get Aaron to speak for you.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; You be God and let Aaron be your
[58:31] prophet.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Just do what I say. Go forwards and let
[58:35] me work out the details.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; It's just so amazing to look at.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Just one example
[58:42] &gt;&gt; of working of miracles, but such
[58:44] tremendous miracles.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; If we just follow the Lord, what kind of
[58:49] miracles could he work out in our lives?
[58:52] and and what kind of miracles does he
[58:55] continually work out in our lives?
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Because I am in no way saying that he
[59:01] doesn't or that he hasn't. I'm saying
[59:03] that he has. And many times we don't
[59:05] even acknowledge it because we don't
[59:07] even recognize it. We just get up in the
[59:10] morning and we've got breath in our
[59:11] lungs and blood in our veins and we're
[59:13] able to get up and and shuffle our way
[59:16] to go make a coffee in the morning and
[59:17] and wake up to the world,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; right? BUT GETTING OUT OF BED IN THE
[59:21] MORNING, brothers and sisters, is a
[59:23] little bit miraculous if you really want
[59:24] my honest opinion about it. There's a
[59:27] lot of people that would love to be able
[59:28] to just get out of bed in the morning,
[59:30] but just can't do it.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; But yet, we do.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God in our lives.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I just think that we need to make room
[59:42] for that Holy Spirit to just work his
[59:44] way out. Don't you just let him work his
[59:47] way out in our lives? you know, Joshua,
[59:50] Joshua in his calling, the the calling
[59:52] for Joshua. Miraculous, isn't it? He
[59:55] went and saw all of the the miracles
[59:57] before. So, he knew the God that they
[1:00:00] were serving, the God that they were
[1:00:02] following. And his commission after
[1:00:04] Moses was taken out of the way is, you
[1:00:06] know what? Everywhere the soul of your
[1:00:08] foot will tread is your possession.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; And you know, when you look at this, if
[1:00:14] you studied a little bit in the message,
[1:00:16] for those that know, you can just go
[1:00:18] right back to the book of uh or not the
[1:00:20] book, but the the study of adoption,
[1:00:22] right? The the adoption series. That's
[1:00:25] exactly where Brother Brandham goes with
[1:00:26] it. And I think it's just such a
[1:00:27] tremendous study. If you haven't done
[1:00:29] it, I highly recommend looking at the
[1:00:31] adoption series. It's such an amazing
[1:00:33] calling because it's exactly the
[1:00:35] commission for us in our lives.
[1:00:36] Everywhere the soul of our foot treads
[1:00:38] in this Bible, everywhere the soul of
[1:00:41] our foot treads in the message is,
[1:00:44] excuse me, it's ours.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; 100% ours.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; The devil wants us to put it off and
[1:00:49] say, "Well, that was in the 60s and that
[1:00:51] was the commission of the prophet. It
[1:00:52] was a prophetic office, etc., etc.,
[1:00:55] etc." But that's not true.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; It was food stored up for a purpose. It
[1:01:00] was food stored up for a people. Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Joshua, he had a calling. Every place
[1:01:08] the sole of your foot. There shall not
[1:01:10] be any man able to stand. And we talked
[1:01:13] about this when we studied this. Don't
[1:01:15] don't think about it. Just Joshua going
[1:01:17] into the promised land. It's the same
[1:01:18] promise for uh Israel today though.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Exactly the same promise. It's still
[1:01:23] fully in force. Their minds were blinded
[1:01:25] for our sake. And even till this day
[1:01:28] their minds are blinded to to the word
[1:01:31] of the Lord of Jesus talking about
[1:01:33] Jesus. But you know Joshua was told
[1:01:36] there shall not be any man able to stand
[1:01:38] against you if you follow my word if you
[1:01:41] follow my will. And remember right after
[1:01:44] they got into the land they actually
[1:01:46] took out Jericho. And as they were going
[1:01:49] forwards something happened. 16 men lost
[1:01:52] their lives. And brother Brandham says
[1:01:54] it very clearly in the adoption series.
[1:01:56] He said, "Wait a minute. The promise
[1:01:59] wasn't that, you know, we're going to
[1:02:00] win most of the battles and there might
[1:02:02] be some casualties along the way." No,
[1:02:04] no. The promise was that everywhere the
[1:02:06] soul of your foot treads is yours and
[1:02:09] not one man shall be able to stand
[1:02:12] before you as long as you are in this
[1:02:15] promised land.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; So when that happened, Achen, he wanted
[1:02:19] the garment. He wanted to look like the
[1:02:21] world. He saw the riches. He went after
[1:02:23] the wedge of gold, didn't he? He took it
[1:02:26] home and he hid both of them. And 16 men
[1:02:28] lost their lives.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Joshua said, "Wait a second. Wait a
[1:02:34] minute.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Let's call a fast.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; We've got to search through our camp.
[1:02:38] There's sin in the land. Something's
[1:02:40] wrong."
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And I think we ought to maybe take heed
[1:02:44] to that once in a while and think about
[1:02:46] it. When we have problems that rise up
[1:02:48] in our lives, perhaps maybe it's not
[1:02:51] just someone else's problem.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Perhaps, brothers and sisters, it's our
[1:02:57] problem.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; As a body of believers,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; if we all want to see the profit of the
[1:03:04] gifts in the body, perhaps we all want
[1:03:07] to offer the profit of the unity in the
[1:03:11] body to come together in prayer and
[1:03:13] maybe fasting. We know there was a time
[1:03:16] where there was someone that had an
[1:03:17] autistic child. The disciples were
[1:03:20] already given full power to go and cast
[1:03:22] out devils and raise the dead and heal
[1:03:25] the sick and so on and so forth. And
[1:03:27] they did. But one man brought their
[1:03:29] child and said, "You know what? Your
[1:03:30] your your disciples, they can't help my
[1:03:33] child." And Jesus said, "Oh, he of
[1:03:35] little faith. You know what? Your child
[1:03:37] is well."
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Just like that. He didn't preach a
[1:03:41] sermon. He didn't do anything. and and
[1:03:42] they the man came and and and was amazed
[1:03:45] that that happened. And the disciples
[1:03:47] came to him afterwards and said, "Rabbi,
[1:03:49] why is it that that happened?" And he
[1:03:51] said, "Because of your faith."
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Because of your faith. But this kind
[1:03:56] only goes out one way.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; One way. And that's by extra effort. So
[1:04:03] if we have a problem in the body,
[1:04:05] brothers and sisters, are we willing TO
[1:04:07] COME TOGETHER AS A BODY AND GIVE EXTRA
[1:04:09] effort
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; or are we busy?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; We're just busy.
[1:04:16] You know, we got a job, we got a career,
[1:04:18] we've got all these different things and
[1:04:20] you know, Wednesdays and Sundays, that's
[1:04:21] what we do. And you know, it's pretty
[1:04:23] good. Most people only go Sundays. So
[1:04:26] where are we at? What are we doing? I I
[1:04:28] think it really behooves us to think
[1:04:30] about that. If there's a problem, maybe
[1:04:32] we should come together as a body and
[1:04:35] look at it
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; like Joshua did.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Let's call a fast
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; and not let the devil have the ability
[1:04:41] to run roughshot over one of our
[1:04:44] brothers or sisters.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; But Joshua, he was given these these
[1:04:49] commandments just so beautiful. We know
[1:04:50] the story of Joshua very well. There
[1:04:53] shall not be any man able to stand. Be
[1:04:55] strong and of a good courage. Don't be
[1:04:57] afraid when these things come your way.
[1:04:59] They're going to come. The enemy is
[1:05:01] going to come rushing in just like a
[1:05:03] flood. But what's going to happen? The
[1:05:05] spirit of God is going to raise a
[1:05:06] standard against that devil.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And he is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:05:11] forever. And and when we go over to the
[1:05:13] other side, we're going to be able to
[1:05:14] quote that scripture and we're going to
[1:05:16] be able to understand that that standard
[1:05:18] isn't William Marryiam Brham.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; That standard is you, brothers and
[1:05:22] sisters. That standard is that spirit,
[1:05:25] that holy spirit that's within each and
[1:05:27] every one of us when we just give it
[1:05:29] room to work its way out. And the only
[1:05:32] way we can work give it room to work its
[1:05:34] way out is to live a holy life.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And to actually worship. We've got to be
[1:05:39] able to worship. We'll get into that
[1:05:41] maybe a little bit later. But tonight, I
[1:05:42] want to talk about the the the
[1:05:45] oh my the working of miracles and how
[1:05:48] incredible it is to look at all of these
[1:05:50] believers in the Bible. And I believe
[1:05:52] they're there not just to look back at
[1:05:54] as a as a historical account from a
[1:05:57] biblical perspective. They're there for
[1:06:00] a purpose to show us that this is how
[1:06:03] God operates. The way that we think he
[1:06:06] should operate is exactly opposite to
[1:06:08] the way he thinks.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily all the time, but I'm
[1:06:13] saying that for a purpose. I want to
[1:06:14] draw a contrast because he says that
[1:06:16] your ways are are not my ways.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Neither are your thoughts my thoughts.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So they're maybe not opposite, but
[1:06:23] they're not the same. He sees things in
[1:06:25] a different light. And it's so beautiful
[1:06:27] if we can just recognize that we just
[1:06:29] need to be strong and of a good courage,
[1:06:32] just like this man Joshua, the calling
[1:06:35] that he had. I got into a scripture
[1:06:38] today in Judges, you know, going a
[1:06:40] little further in in talking about the
[1:06:42] working of miracles. And there was a man
[1:06:44] in the book of Judges. There's a few of
[1:06:46] them and a woman, not just a man, not
[1:06:50] just men, but the story of Gideon out of
[1:06:53] Judges 6:13,
[1:06:55] it says, "And Gideon said unto him, when
[1:06:58] the angel of the Lord came to him, oh my
[1:07:00] Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then
[1:07:04] is all this befallen us?"
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; One day we're going to get into the
[1:07:10] study of the book of Judges. It's a
[1:07:12] question, a literal question that came
[1:07:13] in and we're going to we're going to get
[1:07:15] into it. But it it's interesting that
[1:07:17] Gideon would have an angel of the Lord
[1:07:19] come and visit him and he would actually
[1:07:21] address the angel in such a way. He
[1:07:23] said, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with
[1:07:26] us, why then is all this befallen us?"
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; What did they do? They didn't listen to
[1:07:32] the last prophet. That's what happened.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; That could summarize the whole book of
[1:07:37] Judges. They did not take heed to
[1:07:41] Joshua's last sermon.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; But then to be able to say to the Lord,
[1:07:47] "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us,
[1:07:49] then why is all this befallen us?" I
[1:07:51] wonder if Gideon actually heard Joshua's
[1:07:54] last address. I don't know. I don't know
[1:07:56] if anybody does. Does anybody know that?
[1:07:59] Was he there? Did he hear what the
[1:08:01] prophet said, that prophetic utterance?
[1:08:03] Did they actually write it down? Did
[1:08:05] they have books and tapes that they
[1:08:07] could listen to so that they knew? Did
[1:08:10] the parents teach what Joshua actually
[1:08:13] said to the parent the the children? Did
[1:08:15] the parents teach the children the way
[1:08:17] they should go with it? Here he is
[1:08:20] asking this question and it's a fair
[1:08:21] question. If we have the God of heaven,
[1:08:24] if there is a mighty Jehovah, then why
[1:08:26] has all this befallen us? Why are we
[1:08:28] slaves now to the enemies? I thought
[1:08:30] we're in the promised land. For some
[1:08:32] reason, he knew that this shouldn't be
[1:08:35] this way. So why was he asking it? I
[1:08:38] think it's interesting. He goes on to
[1:08:39] say, "And where be all his miracles
[1:08:41] which our fathers told us of, saying,
[1:08:44] did not the Lord bring us up from
[1:08:46] Egypt?" So clearly he understood.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Someone taught him that there was a
[1:08:50] Lord, that there was miracles, that
[1:08:52] there was something different than what
[1:08:54] he was experiencing.
[1:08:56] But now the Lord hath forsaken us. Can
[1:08:59] you imagine saying that to the angel of
[1:09:01] the Lord and delivered us into the hands
[1:09:03] of the Midianites? And if you go on in
[1:09:06] the story, I think it's so beautiful
[1:09:09] because he he talks about how he he lays
[1:09:12] out the the fleece. We know the story
[1:09:14] all too well. And and he does it one way
[1:09:17] and then he does it the other way and
[1:09:18] says if it you know if this is the way
[1:09:20] it should be then it'll it'll be this
[1:09:22] way and that's exactly the way it was.
[1:09:23] And we know many times people put out
[1:09:25] spiritual fleces in in their own lives.
[1:09:28] And sometimes it's worthwhile to do that
[1:09:30] just to see where we stand. But to think
[1:09:33] about Gideon and how he actually went
[1:09:35] forward and was so successful, how he
[1:09:38] did a mighty work. The Lord did a mighty
[1:09:40] work through Gideon to help the people
[1:09:42] of Israel. But still, they couldn't
[1:09:45] actually get out of that rut they were
[1:09:47] in. There was this this this rut that
[1:09:50] they got themselves into, and they just
[1:09:51] couldn't get out of it. But God
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy will just not leave
[1:09:56] his children forsaken. He will not leave
[1:09:58] them neither will he forsake them. And
[1:10:00] all through this you hear about the
[1:10:02] different stories of people. Shamgar
[1:10:05] Shamgar brother Brandham talks about
[1:10:07] this guy. He's mentioned once in the
[1:10:09] scripture. But here this guy is living
[1:10:11] his life doing the best that he can in
[1:10:14] the circumstances that he's given. And
[1:10:16] here he brother Brandham talks about he
[1:10:18] hears the Philistines marching down the
[1:10:20] road once again. They're coming in to
[1:10:22] pillage the harvest. All of their hard
[1:10:25] work that will keep them through the
[1:10:26] winter. Now, the Philistines are coming
[1:10:28] in and they're going to take it. They're
[1:10:30] going to steal all of their provisions,
[1:10:32] all of their proender for the next
[1:10:34] winter.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; But Shamgar, brother Brandham tells the
[1:10:37] story so good. He he starts thinking
[1:10:39] about it as he hears them coming and
[1:10:41] something happens. And this guy, he just
[1:10:43] simply accepts the way the word says it.
[1:10:45] And he grabs an ox goat, which is not a
[1:10:48] very big thing. It's about this big. And
[1:10:50] what does he do? He knocks out 600
[1:10:53] Philistines. Says, "Not this time."
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Talk about the working of miracles.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Just pushing aside all of our reasoning
[1:11:01] and understanding and saying, "Lord,
[1:11:03] just be it unto me according to your
[1:11:05] word. Your word says this. Now, I claim
[1:11:08] it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live this way. I don't
[1:11:13] want to experience the things that I'm
[1:11:14] having to experience. I believe there's
[1:11:17] more." And you know what? If we ask him
[1:11:19] with all sincerity about that in our
[1:11:21] lives, if there is more, if there's a
[1:11:24] deep calling, there's got to be a deep
[1:11:25] to respond.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Show me, Lord, what you want from me and
[1:11:30] I will do it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; If we're willing to do that, he will
[1:11:34] show us. Don't think for a second he
[1:11:36] won't show us. He will. Samson. We know
[1:11:40] that Samson, the story of Samson in in
[1:11:42] the book of Judges, a thousand
[1:11:44] Philistines.
[1:11:46] He's out marching in the desert one day,
[1:11:48] touring along, doing his thing, and gets
[1:11:50] cornered by a thousand Philistine
[1:11:53] soldiers.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Could you even visualize it? Could you
[1:11:57] even imagine what that would be like
[1:11:59] with shields and helmets up to an inch
[1:12:02] thick, Brother Brandham talks about, and
[1:12:04] spears, maybe bows and arrows, swords,
[1:12:08] and here you are just out in the desert.
[1:12:10] And what happens is you look down and
[1:12:12] you see the jawbone of a mule, something
[1:12:15] that's sunbleached. Has anybody here
[1:12:17] ever picked up old bones? Old
[1:12:19] sunbleleached bones? If you've ever done
[1:12:22] it, if you've never done it, if you pick
[1:12:24] them up, sometimes they'll break.
[1:12:26] picking them up. If you take them and
[1:12:28] you hit them against something, they'll
[1:12:29] probably shatter.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; But to think about a jawbone of a mule
[1:12:34] smashing one inch thick brass helmets
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; of Philistines.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The working of miracles.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; This is the same God that we serve.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; This was not Phil. This was not Samson.
[1:12:47] This was not Shamgar. This was not
[1:12:50] Moses. This was the God of all of those
[1:12:53] men. And that's the God that we serve
[1:12:55] tonight. And that same God is right here
[1:12:58] in our midst because we declared this
[1:13:00] meeting to be in his name.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; To think about this. A thousand
[1:13:07] Philistines with the jawbone of a mule
[1:13:09] smashing inch thick brass helmets
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; dealing with all of those people. Could
[1:13:15] you I just one day I hope I can see what
[1:13:17] that actually looked like. Maybe there's
[1:13:19] a jumbotron somewhere where we could
[1:13:21] say, "Lord, could you just show us what
[1:13:23] what did that actually look like? A
[1:13:26] thousand soldiers taken out with the
[1:13:29] jawbone of a mule. How how could that
[1:13:32] poss? It just doesn't even make sense.
[1:13:34] You can't even rationally think about
[1:13:36] that. But you know the beautiful part
[1:13:38] about it? This is the God we serve,
[1:13:39] BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HE DID ALL of that
[1:13:41] and THEN HE SAID, "I THIRST.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'M THIRSTY."
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And what did God do? gave him a drink.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; He knows our every need.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He's concerned about our condition.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; He's not just going to leave us or
[1:13:57] forsake us. But, you know, that was just
[1:13:59] a few from from the Old Testament that I
[1:14:01] wanted to bring out and and it looks
[1:14:03] like we're still good for a little bit
[1:14:04] of time, but let's get into the New
[1:14:05] Testament and talk about the working of
[1:14:07] miracles. It's for a purpose. It's so
[1:14:09] that we can see that God wants to
[1:14:11] express himself to the church
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and through the church. So, we shouldn't
[1:14:16] be afraid of miracles. We shouldn't be
[1:14:17] afraid of of the gift of healing. We
[1:14:20] shouldn't be afraid of knowledge or
[1:14:21] wisdom in our lives, the speaking in
[1:14:24] tongues and interpretation of tongues.
[1:14:26] These are the nine spiritual gifts. We
[1:14:28] should be just fine seeing them in our
[1:14:30] lives.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Just like asking the Lord to answer our
[1:14:34] prayer AND THEN BEING SURPRISED THAT HE
[1:14:36] ANSWERED IT.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES HE SAY? WE SHOULD BE MORE
[1:14:40] SURPRISED WHEN HE DOESN'T ANSWER our
[1:14:42] prayer than when he does.
[1:14:47] talk about the New Testament. It opens
[1:14:50] up
[1:14:52] in in Canaan of Galilee.
[1:14:57] The first miracle mentioned in the New
[1:14:59] Testament,
[1:15:01] John 2:1, this beginning of miracles did
[1:15:05] Jesus in Canaa of Galilee
[1:15:08] and manifested forth his glory.
[1:15:13] manifested forth his glory and his
[1:15:16] disciples believed on him.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that we're not just
[1:15:21] looking back historically, brothers and
[1:15:22] sisters. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:15:25] and forever. This very same Jesus,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; this Jesus is the one that was there
[1:15:31] with Samson.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; This Jesus was there when he said,
[1:15:36] "Lord, I know I sinned against you. Just
[1:15:39] one more time, let me stand for you. One
[1:15:42] more time, let me stand for your word.
[1:15:45] One more time, let me bring glory unto
[1:15:47] your name. And pushed over the pillars
[1:15:50] of the temple. And we know that's one of
[1:15:52] the most famous stories of this Samson.
[1:15:55] The same Jesus was there with him.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amazing to think about that, isn't it?
[1:16:00] And we know that in that story, in that
[1:16:01] one story, that one action, he took out
[1:16:03] more Philistines than he did in all of
[1:16:05] his life.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that same Jesus that's here
[1:16:09] tonight, that same Jesus that was there
[1:16:11] in Canaan of Galilee, that same Jesus
[1:16:14] that was there with Moses in the burning
[1:16:16] bush, he was with Abraham, he was with
[1:16:18] Sarah, that same Jesus is here tonight.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost in Acts
[1:16:26] chapter 2,
[1:16:29] that same Jesus.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And now I isn't it beautiful how he just
[1:16:34] changes the masks. Brother Brandham in
[1:16:36] this age, he talks about Morphe
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; and Kinosis
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; and Morphe. He just changes his mask.
[1:16:43] The same actor in the play, but just has
[1:16:45] a different mask. He goes from being
[1:16:47] Elohim, the self-existing one, to
[1:16:50] becoming God and to going from God to
[1:16:53] becoming Jehovah
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; to the people and then going from
[1:16:57] Jehovah into Jesus
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; and Jesus into the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:03] But Peter on the day of Pentecost with
[1:17:06] the Holy Ghost and Morphe. Acts 2 22. Ye
[1:17:10] men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus
[1:17:12] of Nazareth, a man approved of God among
[1:17:15] you by miracles and by wonders and signs
[1:17:19] which God did by him in the midst of
[1:17:22] you, as ye yourselves also know. Peter
[1:17:28] was the one that was anointed to preach
[1:17:30] that sermon after they came out of the
[1:17:32] upper room. And we know, brothers and
[1:17:34] sisters, they stumbled like they were
[1:17:36] drunk. They literally thought they were
[1:17:38] drunk. So I think if we are in the
[1:17:41] presence of the Lord and and we might
[1:17:43] act a little bit differently, don't look
[1:17:45] around, just look up.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what anyone is doing.
[1:17:51] Don't worry about what's actually taking
[1:17:53] place. Just worship God and see if he
[1:17:56] won't move in our lives in our midst.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 6, someone else, the
[1:18:01] working of miracles. And Stephen, full
[1:18:04] of faith and power, did great wonders
[1:18:06] and miracles among the people.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about all these people,
[1:18:11] brothers and sisters, not so that we can
[1:18:13] think about them and the ideology of how
[1:18:16] wonderful it must have been to be them
[1:18:17] and and truly it must be. But what about
[1:18:20] you?
[1:18:22] THIS IS THE same God we're talking
[1:18:24] about. This is the same message we
[1:18:26] believe.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Take Steven's name out of there.
[1:18:34] And William full of faith and power.
[1:18:38] And Henry full of faith and power. And
[1:18:40] Paul full of faith and power. And Stella
[1:18:43] full of faith and power. And Rosanna
[1:18:46] full of faith and power. Every one of us
[1:18:49] full of faith and power.
[1:18:51] did great wonders and miracles amongst
[1:18:54] the people.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; We know that in the end times, the
[1:18:57] message that we have, the word for our
[1:18:59] day is the people will know their gods
[1:19:02] and they shall do great exploits. Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; That's our commission, brothers and
[1:19:08] sisters,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; to be that manifestation of the Holy
[1:19:11] Ghost. That little tiny venue where he
[1:19:14] can just work his way out in our life,
[1:19:16] where he can work his way out in our
[1:19:17] life, in our jobs, where he can work his
[1:19:20] way out in our life, in our homes, in
[1:19:22] our marriages. He can work his way out
[1:19:24] in our services. If there was one place,
[1:19:27] brothers and sisters, where he ought to
[1:19:29] be able to work his way out, it is right
[1:19:31] here, right now in the house of the
[1:19:34] Lord. It's such a wonderful thing. Paul
[1:19:36] and Barnabas in Acts 15:12, then all the
[1:19:40] multitude kept silence and gave audience
[1:19:42] to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what
[1:19:44] miracles and wonders God had wrought
[1:19:47] among the Gentiles by them.
[1:19:52] So, where are you tonight? Where are we
[1:19:54] tonight, brothers and sisters?
[1:19:57] Maybe we haven't seen great miracles,
[1:19:59] mighty signs, and wonders. Maybe we have
[1:20:02] a gift of wisdom. And it's a quiet gift.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And when we hear conversations, we can
[1:20:07] actually pick up on nuances.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And we've often wondered, why did I
[1:20:11] think that thought from that
[1:20:12] conversation? Don't don't underestimate
[1:20:15] that gift. We're not necessarily talking
[1:20:18] about seeing the mighty signs and
[1:20:19] wonders. We're talking about all the
[1:20:21] nine spiritual gifts. All of them are in
[1:20:24] the in this body, Calgary Living Word
[1:20:27] Assembly, to profit all of us with all.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing.
[1:20:34] So tonight as we time just starts going
[1:20:37] right when you start having fun. My
[1:20:39] goodness. You know, I want to talk about
[1:20:41] you. That's what I want to talk about
[1:20:43] tonight. I want to encourage us tonight.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And you know, as I was going through and
[1:20:48] studying this, even as I preach it now,
[1:20:50] it's encouraging me. Galatians chapter 3
[1:20:53] to think about the miracles, the working
[1:20:55] of miracles. It's not just for a
[1:20:57] historical account. He is either the
[1:21:01] same yesterday, today, and forever. Or
[1:21:03] he's not.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; There's no middle ground. There's no
[1:21:06] saying, "Well, sometimes maybe if I get
[1:21:09] enough faith, IT'S IRRELEVANT. WHAT WE
[1:21:11] GOT, it's all about him." HE IS that
[1:21:14] one. He is the same yesterday, today,
[1:21:16] and forever. Whether we can believe it
[1:21:18] or understand it is irrelevant.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Galatians 3:5, "He therefore that
[1:21:25] ministerth to you, the spirit,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; and workketh miracles among you, doeth
[1:21:33] he it by the works of the law, or by the
[1:21:38] hearing of faith."
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; So going back to what brother Brandham
[1:21:42] said earlier, when we want to talk about
[1:21:44] healing in our bodies, I believe seeing
[1:21:47] healing in our bodies, it is a miracle.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is miraculous when we can see
[1:21:53] that. But you know, brother Bradom talks
[1:21:55] about the greatest miracle of all. And
[1:21:56] we know what that is. That's that a
[1:21:58] sinner can be a saint.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's that someone who is completely
[1:22:02] lost without hope with no direction,
[1:22:06] drifting a drift in life suddenly can
[1:22:09] hear the word of God and go from being a
[1:22:12] skunk in this world to being a saved son
[1:22:15] of God and recognizing his position in
[1:22:17] the kingdom of the Lord.
[1:22:20] Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And how does that come? Does it come by
[1:22:24] the law? Does it come by legalism?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Does it come by everything being just
[1:22:28] exactly according to the message of the
[1:22:30] hour and the word of God? And if it's
[1:22:32] not, then we're a sinner.
[1:22:34] Or is it coming and just being our our
[1:22:36] imperfect selves and saying, "Just be it
[1:22:39] unto me according to thy word, Lord." Do
[1:22:41] we have the the publicans approach or or
[1:22:44] the Pharisees approach? Where who do we
[1:22:46] stand? Where do we stand, brothers and
[1:22:48] sisters, when we come to church to
[1:22:50] worship? Are are we saying, "I'm so glad
[1:22:52] I'm not like those people out there. Oh
[1:22:55] my, I'm so thankful that I can come and
[1:22:57] worship you." Or do we say, "I recognize
[1:23:00] my imperfection, and that's the way YOU
[1:23:02] MADE ME. AND I JUST WANT TO WORSHIP YOU
[1:23:04] WITH ALL THAT I AM. AND I DON'T CARE
[1:23:05] WHO'S LOOKING AT ME. I DON'T CARE WHO
[1:23:07] HEARS ME. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE
[1:23:09] GLORY THAT YOU REQUIRE OF ME." AMEN.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I think when we
[1:23:15] get to that level, that's where we're
[1:23:17] going to see these gifts really manifest
[1:23:19] in our lives. When we can just let our
[1:23:21] hair down and be imperfect. It doesn't
[1:23:23] matter about what man thinks. It only
[1:23:26] matters about what God sees.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; I think it's a beautiful thing when we
[1:23:33] talk about this the the working of
[1:23:35] miracles and to see the progression of
[1:23:37] miracles in the Bible, isn't it? Just to
[1:23:39] maybe do a little summary of what we've
[1:23:41] talked about tonight. We know that. But
[1:23:43] even before God was an object of worship
[1:23:45] because that's what he was. One of the
[1:23:47] things that William Brandham brought out
[1:23:48] that nobody else is talking about in
[1:23:50] this world is that God, he wasn't always
[1:23:54] God. He was a self-existing one. He was
[1:23:57] Elohim. But he desired certain things.
[1:24:01] He had attributes that he wanted to
[1:24:03] express. So he created himself into a
[1:24:07] form of God so that he could actually be
[1:24:10] worshiped. We know he created the whole
[1:24:12] heavens. He created the whole earth. He
[1:24:14] created the whole universe. Did it take
[1:24:16] six days? Did it take 6,000 years? Who
[1:24:19] knows? We can't explain it. We just
[1:24:22] simply said that he said it and he said
[1:24:24] that it was good when he did it.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; But the progression of of the miracles
[1:24:30] in the Bible to think that God would be
[1:24:32] able to do that is miraculous.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He could become an object of worship. He
[1:24:36] could create angels. He could create
[1:24:38] THIS UNIVERSE. HE COULD PUT everything
[1:24:40] in orbit in this universe to be just so
[1:24:43] perfectly balanced.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Then it came to the place where he
[1:24:48] wanted to express himself to a people.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; But first, he had to have an environment
[1:24:52] for those people to be in.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning,
[1:24:58] God,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; he said, "Let there be light."
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; And when did that happen? How long did
[1:25:04] it happen? How long did it take for it
[1:25:06] to come to pass? We don't know. We can't
[1:25:07] say. But in the beginning, God and then
[1:25:11] Adam and then prophet and then Jesus and
[1:25:15] then disciples. Remember, servants, but
[1:25:18] then friends.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; The progression of the working of
[1:25:23] miracles, then the gentile church, then
[1:25:26] the bride, and then now the wife. Where
[1:25:30] are we tonight, brothers and sisters?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Some of us are still actually a bride.
[1:25:35] Some of us are still actually in that
[1:25:37] engagement phase. And some of us are a
[1:25:40] seasoned wife,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; but we're all just waiting for the
[1:25:45] marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about. We're still
[1:25:50] just ripening in the sun. That's all
[1:25:51] we're called to do is just ripen in the
[1:25:53] sun. But let's recognize that these
[1:25:55] gifts are for us while we're here.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; They're not for us when we get over
[1:25:59] there.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about it.
[1:26:01] Sometimes people say that healing is
[1:26:03] going to be in the millennium. We're not
[1:26:04] going to need healing in the millennium.
[1:26:06] We're going TO HAVE A NEW BODY IN THE
[1:26:07] MILLENNIUM.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; WE NEED HEALING NOW. [screaming]
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; BOY,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; you know, talking about the biblical
[1:26:19] refer references of the of of miracles
[1:26:23] in uh there's two two versions that I
[1:26:26] wanted to talk about. One is the Old
[1:26:28] Testament and one is in the New
[1:26:29] Testament. And uh one in the Old
[1:26:32] Testament is uh it's it's in the sense
[1:26:36] of con conspicuousness [snorts]
[1:26:40] a miracle by implication a token or omen
[1:26:45] miracle sign and wonder and you know out
[1:26:47] of the New Testament it's it's of a
[1:26:50] presumed derivative of base of 459 an
[1:26:53] indication especially ceremonially
[1:26:56] ceremonially
[1:26:58] or supernaturally
[1:27:01] I love how it changes from the Old
[1:27:04] Testament to the New Testament
[1:27:06] ceremonial or supernaturally
[1:27:09] a miracle sign token or a wonder and and
[1:27:13] you know we have the token in our life
[1:27:16] when we have the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:27:18] when we followed the word for our day
[1:27:20] when we recognize that we need to be
[1:27:22] baptized according to Acts 2:38.
[1:27:25] The promise is unto you.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The promise is unto me. The promise is
[1:27:30] unto us, even as many that are a far
[1:27:33] off, even as many as the Lord our God
[1:27:35] should call.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; If we have the desire to be baptized in
[1:27:39] water, then surely to goodness, there's
[1:27:42] a promise of that baptism of the Holy
[1:27:44] Ghost.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; And when we have that baptism of the
[1:27:47] Holy Ghost, brothers and sisters, let's
[1:27:49] not hinder that spirit, excuse me, from
[1:27:52] moving in our lives.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. out of the Sardisian church age in
[1:27:56] 1960. Maybe I'll call the musicians as
[1:27:58] we close here. Out of the Sardisian
[1:28:01] church age in 1960, it's message 1209.
[1:28:05] Paul was the one who constrained them to
[1:28:09] be rebaptized if they hadn't been
[1:28:11] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:15] Come and be baptized over again in order
[1:28:18] to receive the Holy Ghost. Acts 19:5. He
[1:28:21] was also the one that laid hands on the
[1:28:24] people and gifts and set the church in
[1:28:27] order with the working of miracles,
[1:28:30] divine healing, gifts of tongues,
[1:28:32] interpretation of tongues. Is that
[1:28:34] right,
[1:28:36] brothers and sisters? This is what we've
[1:28:38] been called back to. this original
[1:28:40] church.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I really wanted to get
[1:28:43] into preaching tonight and I don't think
[1:28:45] I did, but you know, through the
[1:28:47] restoration of the church, I'll say it
[1:28:50] that way. The restoration of the church,
[1:28:52] being brought back to that original
[1:28:54] Pentecostal church, it is exactly the
[1:28:58] faith of the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And that is exactly what was prophesied
[1:29:03] for the day in which we live. that
[1:29:04] prophetic utterance out of Malachi 4:5
[1:29:06] and 6, he'll do two things.
[1:29:10] And that one thing that we can rejoice
[1:29:12] about is that he has turned the hearts
[1:29:14] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:29:17] Pentecostal fathers.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And what that is is believing that he is
[1:29:22] the same yesterday, today. He's not a
[1:29:24] historical god and he's not a futuristic
[1:29:26] god. Even though he's both of those, but
[1:29:28] he's more God in the present than he's
[1:29:31] either one of those.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when Moses said, "Who
[1:29:35] should I tell them sent me?"
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Tell them I am."
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And he's here tonight, brothers and
[1:29:43] sisters.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I am is here tonight.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; He was also the one that laid hands on
[1:29:50] the people and gifts and set the church
[1:29:52] in order with the working of miracles,
[1:29:55] divine healing, gifts of tongues,
[1:29:57] interpretation of tongues. Is that
[1:29:58] right? 1 Corinthians 12. See what Paul
[1:30:01] said? 1 Corinthians 12 and you'll find
[1:30:05] it. He set in the church. God set in the
[1:30:08] church these great gifts and Paul set
[1:30:12] them in order
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and put them in order so they could work
[1:30:16] for the glory of God.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; So if we see them happening, brothers
[1:30:20] and sisters, they're not going to be
[1:30:21] working for the glory of the devil.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; They can't. Not in the church of the
[1:30:27] living God. They're going to be working
[1:30:28] for the glory of God. [music] If these
[1:30:31] gifts manifest,
[1:30:33] rather when these gifts manifest,
[1:30:36] [music]
[1:30:37] they're working for the glory of God. We
[1:30:39] don't need to be afraid.
[1:30:41] Paul said that then if any man no matter
[1:30:45] what denomination he belongs to tries to
[1:30:48] tell you that the days of speaking in
[1:30:50] tongues, interpretation of tongues,
[1:30:53] divine healing and miracles and the
[1:30:55] witness of the Holy Ghost as the
[1:30:56] baptism, let him be accursed.
[1:31:01] And we know that the scripture says that
[1:31:03] if [music] an angel, any man or an angel
[1:31:05] comes and tells you anything other than
[1:31:07] what we've already [music] said, let him
[1:31:09] be a curse. But brother Bradam makes it
[1:31:11] so crystal clear that if anybody says
[1:31:13] that any one of these [music] gifts
[1:31:16] are not in operation,
[1:31:18] let him be accursed. It's like taking a
[1:31:21] magnifying glass to the word of God.
[1:31:23] It's reading exactly between the lines.
[1:31:25] This is what we've been called back to
[1:31:27] in the day in which we live. It's so
[1:31:28] beautiful. For the same spirit that was
[1:31:31] upon Paul
[1:31:33] will be the same spirit that was sent to
[1:31:37] the next church age. the same to the
[1:31:40] next church age and [music] the same on
[1:31:43] down unto the end of the church age. The
[1:31:47] same spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that tonight?
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. May stand with me as we close.
[1:31:57] Brothers and sisters, I [music] just
[1:31:58] want to say, expect the miraculous.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Expect the miraculous.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And and more to that, you are the
[1:32:07] miraculous. Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Because you have the ability to believe
[1:32:11] this word.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; And out of eight 8 and a2 billion people
[1:32:15] in this earth right now, so few people
[1:32:18] have the ability to believe [music] it.
[1:32:20] And then they'll say that you're a
[1:32:22] fanatic and a holy ruler. We just
[1:32:24] believe what Paul believed. We just
[1:32:26] believe [music] what Paul preached.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Expect the miraculous. Let's just bow in
[1:32:32] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we
[1:32:35] thank you.
[1:32:36] We thank you for your word, Lord. We
[1:32:39] thank you that you can, Lord Jesus,
[1:32:41] manifest yourself
[1:32:43] to us [music] and through us, Lord.
[1:32:46] Father, we pray that tonight, Lord, you
[1:32:47] would help us to just surrender
[1:32:49] ourselves more to you because we know
[1:32:51] that's the only way that can happen. And
[1:32:54] Father, maybe some of us have had our
[1:32:57] eagle eyes filmed over. And if we have,
[1:32:59] Lord, we pray that you would [music]
[1:33:00] just, Lord Jesus, send us some of that
[1:33:03] bomb in Gilead. Father, let us not go
[1:33:06] seeking a remedy from the the the gods
[1:33:09] of Baal. Oh, Father, let us seek that
[1:33:12] that bomb that you have provided for us,
[1:33:14] Lord Jesus. Just like your prophet
[1:33:16] talked about that grease that could
[1:33:18] be applied. Help us to take that bomb of
[1:33:20] your Holy Spirit and put it on our
[1:33:22] spiritual eyes, Lord. Father, that we
[1:33:24] would recognize the words that we're
[1:33:26] speaking, the words that we're hearing,
[1:33:28] Father, [music] that they're more than
[1:33:29] life to us because they're your words,
[1:33:32] Lord. Father, we pray that you would
[1:33:34] just bless each one tonight who's made
[1:33:36] the effort to fight their way through
[1:33:38] their lives to get to service, Lord
[1:33:40] Jesus. Oh, Father, that they could bring
[1:33:42] their lick of fire together to worship
[1:33:44] you, Lord. Bless them abundantly,
[1:33:46] Father, above all they could ask or
[1:33:48] think. Father, we pray that you would be
[1:33:50] with those who couldn't be here tonight.
[1:33:53] Father, wherever they are, whatever
[1:33:54] they're doing or going through, Father,
[1:33:56] we pray that you would just bless them
[1:33:58] with a special measure of your grace.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we know you're not bound
[1:34:02] by time or space. [music] So, we just
[1:34:04] ask that you would bless them
[1:34:05] abundantly. Father, even those that
[1:34:07] might just stream it later, that tune in
[1:34:09] afterwards, Father, bless them as well.
[1:34:12] We know that you are that kind of God.
[1:34:14] And we thank you for that, Lord. Lord
[1:34:17] Jesus, now we pray that you would just
[1:34:19] be glorified with a couple of songs
[1:34:21] before we go back to our lives, Lord.
[1:34:23] And as we do go back to our lives,
[1:34:25] Father, as we do travel, help us to
[1:34:27] consider the many mighty miracles that
[1:34:30] you do in our lives, Lord. So many times
[1:34:33] maybe we don't even recognize them,
[1:34:35] Father. Help us to give you the praise
[1:34:37] and glory and honor that you desire.
[1:34:39] [music] Help us to perceive it, Lord
[1:34:41] Jesus. How many times you help us in our
[1:34:44] lives along the way. And Father, as we
[1:34:46] as we go through our week, Lord, let us
[1:34:49] pray without ceasing. Let us thank you,
[1:34:51] Father, for the good work that you've
[1:34:52] done in our lives, Lord. And if it's
[1:34:54] your will for us to gather again on
[1:34:56] Sunday, Lord, we will bring a song of
[1:34:59] praise, Lord. [music] We'll bring a
[1:35:00] shout in our heart, Lord Jesus. We'll
[1:35:03] bring that little lick of fire that you
[1:35:05] have placed inside us, Father, and just
[1:35:07] allow it to work its way out, Father.
[1:35:10] Lord Jesus, giving you glory. We love
[1:35:12] you, Father, and we thank you for the
[1:35:14] many gifts that you have placed in the
[1:35:16] body.
[1:35:17] We just ask all these things now.
[1:35:19] [music]
[1:35:20] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we [music] sing that song? All
[1:35:26] in all.
