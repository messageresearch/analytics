[0:00] spirit and then take it to the word and
[0:02] the message of the hour and confirm it
[0:04] by the word and by the message of the
[0:06] hour
[0:07] then you know what will happen
[0:09] it will actually come to life in the
[0:12] individual
[0:13] it should start to come to life it
[0:16] should do something to you it should do
[0:18] something to us it should cause a
[0:20] stimulation by that Revelation to know
[0:22] that it's it's not just my idea it's not
[0:25] just my thought it's not just something
[0:26] somebody told me somewhere along the way
[0:28] it's something that God showed me
[0:30] sovereignly
[0:32] he showed me by the spirit he confirmed
[0:34] it by the word so then what brother
[0:36] Branham says it needs to manifest in the
[0:38] life of the individual
[0:40] once that happens once that stimulation
[0:43] happens it changes something in US it
[0:45] changes our walk it changes our talk our
[0:48] habits disappear the Devils that had
[0:50] control over our lives no longer have
[0:52] control because there's a there's a
[0:54] stimulation of the Revelation that's
[0:56] happened to us
[0:58] and that's I believe where it starts for
[1:00] a True Believer that's that's our
[1:02] starting place with the message of the
[1:04] hour that's where we have the ability
[1:06] yes that Mighty angel that descended in
[1:10] Revelations 10 7 has already descended
[1:12] he's not going to descend he already has
[1:16] there's going to be an Ascension that's
[1:18] what's going to happen
[1:20] many people are singing songs today
[1:22] asking crying out praying for the coming
[1:25] of the Lord and it's already happened
[1:28] That's History
[1:29] it's going to be the going of the way
[1:31] the next coming of the Lord is in
[1:33] Revelations 19 and that's where we all
[1:35] come back with him
[1:37] we need to make sure that we understand
[1:39] exactly where we are in time
[1:43] so I want to say it again
[1:45] what's in your hand
[1:47] what's in our hand
[1:51] we're going to get into this a little
[1:52] further in this in this message brother
[1:54] Branham he tells the story and and this
[1:57] is where the book really isn't open and
[1:59] and this is where we can get our
[2:00] traditions and and our our teachings and
[2:03] and maybe some of the things that we've
[2:04] gone through in our lives can really
[2:06] stunt our our ability our growth and and
[2:09] and and physically and spiritually and
[2:11] mentally all these things can happen
[2:13] depending on circumstances around us but
[2:16] we don't want to do that brother Brandon
[2:17] tell us this story about this Mom
[2:19] who gets pneumonia in this message she
[2:22] gets pneumonia and her son is off at
[2:24] theology school he's off at the at the
[2:27] Bible College studying and getting
[2:29] trained in the ways of the word and and
[2:31] while he's away he's being taught that
[2:34] Mark 16 and action is only good up until
[2:37] the ninth verse and everything from the
[2:39] ninth verse on is uninspired is what
[2:42] he's taught in his theological studies
[2:45] and this boy believes that with all his
[2:47] heart and his mom she gets sick and and
[2:50] they had the holy rollers in the mission
[2:52] Down on the Corner probably a little
[2:53] church like ours I can't help but think
[2:55] it must be similar to that or it must
[2:57] have been but they have this little
[2:59] church and and and the mom couldn't be
[3:01] treated for her pneumonia she was an
[3:03] elderly woman and she couldn't be
[3:05] treated because she couldn't take
[3:06] penicillin I think she was allergic to
[3:08] it or something and and so what happens
[3:10] was her friend says hey you know what we
[3:12] we see miracles in our church we have a
[3:15] living God in our church and you know if
[3:17] the doctors can't help you I think my
[3:19] pastor might be able to why don't you
[3:21] just maybe let him pray for you would
[3:23] you would you mind letting him try to
[3:24] pray for you
[3:25] imagine that hey a friend just wanting
[3:28] to reach out and help a friend
[3:30] and what I like about this story is that
[3:32] brother Brown doesn't say that she went
[3:33] and joined the church
[3:35] he doesn't say that she signed up and
[3:38] became a member of it
[3:39] all she did was say hey okay sure
[3:43] I'll try you I'll try out I'll take you
[3:45] up on that offer and so she goes down
[3:47] and she gets prayed for and she gets
[3:48] healed
[3:50] she gets healed in the name of Jesus
[3:53] that's wonderful
[3:55] son comes home from school and and and
[3:57] you know sometime later goes by
[4:01] mom and son are having a conversation
[4:04] the son says oh yeah Mom didn't you have
[4:06] pneumonia while I was away remember I
[4:07] was going to come home and and see you I
[4:09] thought it was an emergency situation
[4:11] and and and you had pneumonia how did
[4:13] the doctors treat you and she says oh
[4:16] son the doctors couldn't treat me they
[4:17] never treated me God treated me I went
[4:20] and got prayed for down at the mission
[4:21] and he says oh Mom you didn't do that
[4:24] you didn't go down there with those
[4:25] people and get prayed for oh yeah I did
[4:28] and I got healed God healed me oh no Mom
[4:31] that's not possible the days of Miracles
[4:33] has passed and how this son the book
[4:35] just isn't open to them
[4:37] he wound up getting some tradition some
[4:40] some Creed some some some traditional
[4:43] teaching some ideology from someone else
[4:45] instead of just taking the word and
[4:48] letting God reveal it by the spirit to
[4:50] him which is what the Walk of a True
[4:52] Believer truly is
[4:54] but the son says oh it must have been a
[4:56] doctor's Mom it couldn't have been
[4:57] couldn't have been God because the days
[4:58] of Miracles has passed and what a simple
[5:01] little story hey but I just love the
[5:03] ending of it because you know what what
[5:05] the mom says the the son says oh no you
[5:08] know Mark 16 the the beyond the ninth
[5:10] verse is uninspired and the mom says oh
[5:12] Hallelujah glory and she starts to have
[5:14] a little Rejoice there in the moment and
[5:17] he says mom you're sounding like those
[5:18] people down there calm down you don't
[5:21] want to go that way and and he says
[5:23] what's wrong with you and she says my
[5:24] goodness if an uninspired word will heal
[5:27] my body what will an inspired word do
[5:31] so brothers and sisters tonight that's
[5:33] why I'm so excited I just I don't know
[5:35] if it shows but I feel it I feel
[5:37] inspired tonight to think that the whole
[5:39] world is dealing with an uninspired word
[5:41] not having the true baptism of the Holy
[5:44] Ghost not realizing Mark 16 in action
[5:46] not seeing Revelations 10 7 that Mighty
[5:50] Angel descending with an open book in
[5:52] his hand with all of our names written
[5:53] in it
[5:55] and here we stand tonight as the Bride
[5:59] of Jesus Christ what's in our hands
[6:02] what's in our hands
[6:05] Mark 16 in action is his true church
[6:09] that he calls his own and all else is
[6:12] false
[6:14] you know I just I just love the words to
[6:16] that song that we sang tonight
[6:19] Standing on the Promises
[6:22] that cannot fail
[6:24] [Music]
[6:27] when the howling storms of doubt and
[6:30] fear assail
[6:34] by The Living Word of God
[6:37] what
[6:39] I shall Prevail Glory
[6:42] Standing on the Promises of God
[6:45] [Music]
[6:46] so tonight we're going to talk about the
[6:48] children of Israel we're going to talk
[6:50] about them in the Old Testament and all
[6:52] of the natural examples but while we go
[6:54] through and we talk about these natural
[6:55] examples I want to just take it and fast
[6:58] forward thousands of years to today in
[7:00] our lives we don't deal with the natural
[7:02] examples like we're talking about we
[7:04] deal with Devils we're just going to
[7:06] call it out right now tonight make it
[7:08] plain black and white we're talking
[7:10] about devils
[7:11] doctrines of devils devils that come
[7:14] around and afflict our bodies Devils
[7:15] that afflict our minds Devils that
[7:17] afflict our marriages Devils that
[7:19] afflict our our businesses Devils that
[7:21] just do everything to try and throw
[7:23] banana peels in our life
[7:25] we're talking about Devils tonight
[7:28] but the children of Israel they dealt
[7:30] with the natural enemy
[7:36] so as we go through these
[7:37] I just want to remember that we're
[7:39] talking about Devils think about all the
[7:41] things that we contend within our lives
[7:43] we heard about it on Sunday so good
[7:45] brother Toby thank you brother talking
[7:47] about the the promises of God and and
[7:50] the sermon title that he had the
[7:52] expression of God's grace throughout all
[7:54] the ages and and here we stand tonight
[7:57] as God's grace to all the ages
[8:00] we were talking about it this morning on
[8:02] on a phone call and how really seriously
[8:05] every day it just gets stronger and
[8:07] stronger for me to think about how when
[8:09] we get over there we're gonna say how
[8:11] did you guys make it how did you stand
[8:12] how did you get burned at the stake how
[8:15] did you get fed to Lions how how could
[8:17] you have done that and they're going to
[8:18] say how did you contend with all the
[8:20] Devils of laodicea
[8:22] how did you withstand all of that
[8:26] we're gonna say we didn't
[8:28] there is only one set of footprints in
[8:30] the sand through our lives and it was
[8:32] him carrying us
[8:34] remember in the Book of Joshua Joshua
[8:37] chapter 1 verse 3 every place the soul
[8:40] of your foot shall tread upon that have
[8:43] I given unto you
[8:45] as I said unto Moses
[8:49] so I'm just going to paraphrase it here
[8:51] every place that the soul of your foot
[8:55] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[8:57] you as I said unto brother Branham
[9:00] every single promise
[9:02] he was here to be an example for what we
[9:06] are supposed to come to
[9:08] he's not an office to be worshiped he
[9:10] was in office to take out a bride of
[9:13] Christ's own choosing
[9:15] you know some people in the days of
[9:17] Eliezer they just wanted to stay with
[9:19] the gifts they just loved that Camel
[9:22] full the camel's full of all the gifts
[9:24] they didn't want the giver
[9:27] but you know there was one she wanted to
[9:29] give her
[9:31] she wanted to go and see her Isaac she
[9:33] wanted to go all the way she didn't care
[9:35] about all the gold and the silver and
[9:37] the moment and all the Pomp and
[9:38] everything that went along with it she
[9:40] wasn't into that
[9:42] but every place at the soul of your foot
[9:44] shall tread upon brothers and sisters
[9:45] that have I given unto you as I said
[9:48] unto Moses
[9:49] only be thou strong and very courageous
[9:51] are the instructions don't fear
[9:54] don't be afraid
[9:56] God can't use a coward as what brother
[9:58] Bradham said
[10:00] we don't want to be afraid we don't want
[10:02] to be cowards and I know I'm guilty
[10:04] myself I'll tell you
[10:06] I've just given in to the devil given
[10:09] into whatever it is oh I'm afraid I
[10:12] can't overcome
[10:13] the temptation's too strong
[10:15] it's too great for me
[10:17] no no no no no no no
[10:20] tonight we're here to serve notice to
[10:22] the devil
[10:24] what's in your hand you know what's in
[10:26] our hand brothers and sisters not a
[10:28] closed book but an open book and every
[10:31] single promise in this book is mine and
[10:33] we've got to be willing to say that and
[10:35] we've got to be willing to say to Satan
[10:37] take a look buddy every promise in this
[10:40] book is mine and you can't stop this
[10:43] book from coming to pass in my life
[10:46] not worrying about anybody else I'm only
[10:48] going to talk about me tonight my life
[10:53] you know what Samson the story of Samson
[10:56] he had quite a few quite a few things in
[10:59] his life let's just quickly turn over to
[11:01] Judges chapter 15.
[11:04] Judges chapter 15. we'll just read a few
[11:06] stories tonight and just do a little
[11:08] preaching tonight and just see if the
[11:09] Lord will speak to us tonight
[11:12] Judges chapter 15 verse 12.
[11:16] it's amazing when you look at this keep
[11:19] in mind what's in your hand
[11:21] keep in mind the trespassing enemy
[11:26] and sometimes what our brothers and our
[11:28] sisters can be like
[11:30] goodness
[11:32] in chapter 15 verse 12 so these this is
[11:36] this is the the
[11:38] three thousand we'll start with verse
[11:40] 11.
[11:41] actually 10.
[11:44] sorry
[11:45] let's get excited
[11:46] judges 15 verse 10 and the men of Judah
[11:49] said why are you come up against us
[11:52] so these are the Philistines now that
[11:54] are come up to Judah and they answered
[11:56] to bind Samson
[11:59] to bind Samson or we come up to do him
[12:01] do to him as he hath done to us so he
[12:05] just hung a weapon on him he just hung a
[12:07] real good weapon on the Philistines and
[12:09] they didn't want any part of them I mean
[12:11] they wanted every part of him they want
[12:12] to get him so verse 11 then 3 000 men of
[12:16] Judah not the Philistines three thousand
[12:18] men of Judah his brothers
[12:20] went to the Top of the Rock etam and
[12:23] said to Samson knowest thou not the
[12:25] Philistines are rulers over us
[12:28] so here they are in their Promised Land
[12:30] and they're saying to this man of God
[12:32] who's anointed don't you know that the
[12:34] enemy they're they're rulers we need to
[12:36] make Provisions so we don't upset the
[12:38] enemy that's got a hold in our lives a
[12:40] hold in our Promised Land
[12:42] can you imagine that
[12:44] but that's the way it was
[12:47] no doubt the Philistines are rulers over
[12:49] us what is this that thou has done to us
[12:51] you bring the reproach to us you're
[12:53] turning into a Holy Roller you're
[12:54] preaching a little too strong a little
[12:56] too loud the book's a little too open
[12:57] and he said unto them as they did unto
[13:00] me so have I done unto them
[13:04] they messed with me I mess with them can
[13:07] you imagine we need to have a testimony
[13:08] like that we got Devils messing with us
[13:10] let's mess with them let's not step back
[13:12] and say oh I'm being Afflicted let's
[13:14] stand forward and puff our chest out and
[13:16] say no I defy you in the name of the
[13:19] Living God you have no power over me
[13:21] Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[13:23] Christ get lost
[13:27] and they said unto him
[13:29] we are come down to bind thee his
[13:31] brothers
[13:32] we are come down to bind thee that we
[13:35] may deliver thee into the hand of the
[13:37] Philistines just so we don't get
[13:39] Afflicted anymore just so they don't
[13:40] come against us anymore because they got
[13:41] rule over us we got to make sure that
[13:43] we've got keep the peace here right
[13:46] make it make it comfortable for that
[13:48] devil and Samson said unto them swear
[13:50] unto me that ye will not fall upon me
[13:52] yourselves just just pass me off then
[13:54] and and we'll go our way and they spake
[13:57] unto him saying no but we will bind thee
[13:59] fast and deliver thee into their hand
[14:02] but surely we will not kill thee and
[14:06] they bound him with two new cords and
[14:09] brought him up from The Rock
[14:11] and when he came unto Lehi the
[14:15] Philistines shouted against him imagine
[14:17] this the Devils got upset because they
[14:19] saw him coming
[14:21] and the spirit of the Lord came mightily
[14:23] upon him and the cords that were upon
[14:25] his arms became his flax that was burnt
[14:28] with fire and his bands loose from off
[14:30] his hands and he found a new Jawbone of
[14:33] an ass and put forth his hand and took
[14:36] it
[14:36] and slew a thousand men there with
[14:40] and Samson said with a Jawbone of an ass
[14:43] heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass
[14:47] have I slain a thousand men
[14:52] so we're talking naturally about
[14:54] the natural men but remember brothers
[14:56] and sisters what's in your hand
[15:00] is the book open to you
[15:03] have you been called to be the Bride of
[15:05] Jesus Christ tonight are you actually
[15:08] living in the promised land where every
[15:10] place the soul of your foot Treads when
[15:12] you read in the Bible you see Jesus
[15:15] Christ and it speaks to you individually
[15:21] can you imagine that though his brothers
[15:22] came and said no we got to keep the
[15:25] peace don't want to get the occupiers
[15:27] upset
[15:30] it's amazing to think about this
[15:31] trespassing enemy when they show when
[15:34] they saw him they just began to cry out
[15:36] and it's just exactly what happened in
[15:38] Jesus life the most religious people
[15:40] they couldn't see it but the Devils the
[15:44] Devils they were able to see the Lord
[15:46] Jesus Christ and you know when I look
[15:48] around and see the problems rising up in
[15:51] the lives of individuals who are
[15:53] believers I can't help but think that
[15:55] the devils are shouting howling because
[15:58] they can see the Lord Jesus Christ and
[16:00] flesh again and they're going to do
[16:02] everything they can to try and distract
[16:04] us from seeing that we truly are the
[16:07] Living God in flesh Walking On Earth as
[16:10] long as we can get caught up in the in
[16:12] in in the moment with the occupiers
[16:14] there and look at the problems and and
[16:16] forget about what's in our hand and just
[16:19] be in the moment and and so busy and and
[16:21] and just totally consumed with
[16:23] everything that's going on in life we're
[16:25] going to miss
[16:27] what our responsibility is and I believe
[16:29] our responsibility is to stand tall
[16:32] and not be afraid the song We sang
[16:34] Standing on the Promises
[16:36] that cannot fail his promises cannot
[16:39] fail
[16:40] in the lives of a Believer but Satan
[16:42] wants us to believe they do
[16:44] Satan wants us to look at so and so and
[16:47] such and such and say well they got
[16:48] prayed for and look at them and and and
[16:50] they got prayed for in that circumstance
[16:52] and look at that
[16:54] but you know what we're not talking
[16:55] about having a prosperous life here what
[16:58] we're talking about is actually making
[17:00] it to the throne making it to the throne
[17:03] making it to our Eternal destination
[17:05] that's what we're fighting for brothers
[17:07] and sisters our Promised Land is Our
[17:09] Eternal destination it's not living here
[17:11] in this earth and saying that I've got a
[17:13] nice piece of land or or I'm going to
[17:15] have the healthiest body and I'm going
[17:16] to have all the vitamins and do all the
[17:18] things so I can have the longest life
[17:20] you know take this whole world but give
[17:22] me Jesus
[17:24] [Music]
[17:25] we don't want to get comfortable in this
[17:26] world the more that we're in this world
[17:28] the more we become of this world
[17:31] it's just the way it works
[17:33] humanly speaking
[17:35] we don't want more of this world
[17:37] I don't want more of this world anyways
[17:39] maybe I stand corrected that's maybe
[17:41] just my opinion and I apologize if it is
[17:43] but the longer I'm in this world the
[17:45] more disgusted I get
[17:47] just when you think you've heard it all
[17:49] there's more
[17:51] and I'm sure everyone has seen stuff
[17:53] recently it's just it's crazy
[17:58] but when the howling storms of doubt and
[18:00] fear assail
[18:01] by The Living Word of God
[18:04] I shall prevail
[18:06] I wonder if we could just sing this song
[18:08] as we go forwards this week just even
[18:11] this verse just just we're Standing on
[18:13] the Promises that cannot fail
[18:17] and when these Storms Come Around that
[18:19] try and assail
[18:22] by The Living Word of God how does the
[18:25] word of God live brothers and sisters
[18:27] it's spoken on the lips of Sons and
[18:29] Daughters of God it's the Living Word of
[18:32] God it's not an association to a church
[18:34] group no way it's it's it's being able
[18:37] to understand what's in our hand
[18:40] and taking it with a strong hand of
[18:42] Faith to the heart of the enemy
[18:45] not tolerating the devil not saying no
[18:47] I'm just going to say well you know
[18:50] I guess I've got it and I'll just accept
[18:52] it and I'll just move on
[18:54] no that's not what he wants
[18:56] he wants us to actually confess it
[18:58] brother Bradham says God can't do
[19:00] nothing for us unless we first confess
[19:02] it
[19:03] can you imagine that
[19:05] we need to be willing to speak the word
[19:09] I just love this part in uh the story of
[19:12] of Samson and how the spirit of God came
[19:17] mightily upon him and the cords burned
[19:20] like flax off of his wrists I just can't
[19:22] help but think it brothers and sisters
[19:24] there is a time in every single
[19:27] believer's life where the bonds that
[19:29] bind you will burn and fall like burnt
[19:33] flax off of your hands where you become
[19:36] released from your bondage where you
[19:38] become released from all of your fears
[19:40] and all of the trials that assail you
[19:44] the things that you thought you couldn't
[19:45] overcome you will overcome
[19:48] even brother Branham he said he fought
[19:50] his whole entire life with his body but
[19:53] at the very end
[19:54] God told him your enemy is dead on the
[19:57] wings of a snow white dove listen to
[19:59] that message and that little that little
[20:02] weasel looking thing that attacked him
[20:04] continually in his stomach praying for
[20:07] sick people to be healed when he was so
[20:09] sick he could hardly stand up
[20:12] think about how we all have have trials
[20:15] and and we all have things in our lives
[20:17] that we contend with every one of us
[20:19] does
[20:21] I think that maybe I just can say myself
[20:25] I have made provision for those things
[20:28] to be life maybe just a little longer
[20:30] than they need to be
[20:33] and I don't know maybe I just got a
[20:35] revelation
[20:36] and then maybe I got it confirmed by the
[20:38] word
[20:39] and now I'm seeing it manifest in my
[20:41] life where we don't have to tolerate
[20:43] Satan brothers and sisters
[20:46] we don't have to
[20:49] but just to think that something as
[20:51] simple as a job owner of a mule you
[20:53] could thrash a thousand Philistines with
[20:56] brother Branham says with helmets an
[20:58] inch thick
[20:59] it's just you can't even really
[21:01] comprehend it and then afterwards he
[21:03] says Lord you would let me go through
[21:05] all of this and I I I I kill a thousand
[21:08] men and I'm so so thirsty now after this
[21:11] and you would let me die of thirst
[21:14] and what does God do he pours water out
[21:16] of that Jawbone
[21:18] he looks after his own
[21:23] it's amazing
[21:26] turn over to Samuel first Samuel
[21:29] let's talk a little bit about David
[21:31] some real familiar scripture tonight
[21:33] nothing really extraordinary
[21:37] but I think it's all Extraordinary all
[21:39] of it is
[21:40] because it's all inspired
[21:45] I think we should be able to just say it
[21:48] say it again just tell me again tell me
[21:51] more say it again
[21:53] first Samuel chapter 17.
[21:57] you know David and and the Giant
[22:06] start with verse 45.
[22:09] then said David to the philistine
[22:13] thou cometh to me with a sword
[22:16] and with a spear and with the shield
[22:20] but I come to thee in the name of the
[22:22] Lord of hosts
[22:25] the god of the armies of Israel whom
[22:27] thou Hast defied
[22:30] this day
[22:32] will the Lord deliver thee into mine
[22:35] hand
[22:36] and I will smite thee
[22:39] and will take thine head from thee
[22:43] and will give the carcass
[22:45] of the host of the Philistines this day
[22:48] unto the fowls of the air
[22:51] and to the wild beasts of the Earth
[22:54] that all the Earth may know that there
[22:58] is a God in Israel
[23:01] [Music]
[23:04] brothers and sisters this this scripture
[23:07] is written for a purpose
[23:10] it's written to show us
[23:13] that we can do the same
[23:17] how do we do the same
[23:19] submit to the word
[23:21] you know what we can get so caught up in
[23:23] our lives so completely balled down
[23:26] balled up in all of the events in our
[23:28] lives
[23:29] maybe we just need to take everything
[23:31] that we've got going on in our lives and
[23:33] set it aside
[23:34] and just press pause and just say Lord I
[23:37] don't even know what to do anymore I'm
[23:39] so busy and so caught up and everything
[23:41] is so
[23:43] crazy
[23:44] think about how the children of Israel
[23:46] were there
[23:47] the most Valiant men in Israel assembled
[23:50] together in a battle with the
[23:52] Philistines and and here this giant
[23:55] comes out and now everyone's scared and
[23:57] I don't know if you've ever experienced
[23:58] it before but when I was a kid this is
[24:01] so silly to say even but when I was a
[24:04] kid I got caught up at a situation where
[24:06] it was just hysteria that this one kid
[24:08] that I I ran with he was really afraid
[24:11] of this other kid
[24:13] and so he would talk about this other
[24:15] kid and how he was really tough and he
[24:17] would beat up anybody and he could beat
[24:18] up big guys and and and he's he's he's
[24:21] got our names and he wants to beat us up
[24:23] now and and he never said that to me I
[24:25] never heard him say that but I heard
[24:27] this other kid say it and because I
[24:28] heard this other kid say it over and
[24:29] over and over and over and over I
[24:31] started to believe it
[24:35] and I got to the place where I was
[24:36] scared of this kid that he's gonna beat
[24:38] me up when he wasn't ever going to beat
[24:40] me up
[24:42] or maybe he would have but I just never
[24:44] had the opportunity to be around him or
[24:46] whatever but what a silly thing
[24:48] but for a kid it was real and for
[24:50] children of God it's a real thing when a
[24:52] devil comes around and starts boasting
[24:54] to say that you've got cancer
[24:56] or to say that you've got some terminal
[24:58] disease or to say that you can't
[25:01] overcome
[25:02] you're just going to stay on that that
[25:04] cycle of iniquity forever you're never
[25:06] going to overcome you know what brothers
[25:09] and sisters you are going to overcome
[25:12] the word says that they did overcome by
[25:14] the blood of the lamb and by their
[25:15] testimony of Jesus Christ
[25:18] we just have to be willing to apply the
[25:20] word and say you know there's a time
[25:21] where we just have to say no enough is
[25:23] enough is enough you are a trespasser
[25:26] Satan you are no longer welcome in this
[25:29] Promised Land because every single one
[25:32] of us if we are true Christians you are
[25:34] the promised land today the Holy Ghost
[25:36] in you is the promised land today and
[25:39] Satan's going to come around and try and
[25:41] squat all over that as a trespasser and
[25:44] make you think that you're not in the
[25:45] promised land while he is trespassing
[25:48] he's a trespasser he's not allowed to be
[25:50] there
[25:51] if we take that case and plead it before
[25:53] the most high God the Supreme deity the
[25:57] judge the white wigged one guess what
[26:00] he'll say pardoned doesn't matter what
[26:03] you try and bring against these these
[26:05] children of mine because I don't look at
[26:06] their flesh the way they're built here
[26:08] on Earth I only hear their voice the way
[26:10] that I created them before the
[26:12] foundation of the world because they've
[26:13] got a perfect body right here and and
[26:15] that's the way I see them
[26:17] but Satan gets us all caught up and
[26:19] seeing ourselves and seeing each other
[26:21] and dealing with all the emotional
[26:24] garbage that we do
[26:26] it's the devil
[26:28] let's call them out tonight Brothers and
[26:30] Sisters Let's Get Liberty in our lives
[26:32] let's have that Liberty that just takes
[26:34] us to the next level where we can
[26:36] recognize that we are Sons and Daughters
[26:38] of God and when we see Satan come in and
[26:40] around us in our family or or in our
[26:42] business or or in our jobs or whatever
[26:45] it is with our parents or our spouses or
[26:47] wherever Satan comes in let's call them
[26:50] out let's rebuke that devil in the name
[26:52] of Jesus Christ and say you're
[26:54] trespassing you have no authority to be
[26:56] here I have all the authority because I
[26:59] have a open book in my hand
[27:02] I have received the message of the hour
[27:04] I have the true baptism of the Holy
[27:06] Ghost and that's not just some nebulous
[27:08] thing that is actually the literal life
[27:11] of Jesus Christ in my flesh
[27:15] so that when I speak
[27:18] God speaks
[27:21] and the Devils know it
[27:23] the Devils know it
[27:25] but this that this giant here this devil
[27:28] here this giant here this devil here he
[27:30] was trespassing you know everybody there
[27:32] knew it
[27:34] right
[27:35] all the children of Israel and all the
[27:37] Philistines they all knew that he was
[27:40] they were all trespassing
[27:41] this was the promised land and they
[27:43] thought that they could just come in and
[27:45] start making their boast the whole Army
[27:47] of God the Living God trembled because
[27:49] they heard this guy boasting and they
[27:51] were afraid of it they were afraid of
[27:54] the boasting like I was telling of that
[27:55] story when I was a kid just hysteria
[27:58] hearing hearing hearing hearing what we
[28:00] hear is what we become what we take into
[28:03] our bodies is what we become you know
[28:06] lot vexed his righteous Soul every
[28:08] single day with the things that he saw
[28:10] and heard is what the word says we've
[28:12] got to be very careful what we hear and
[28:14] what we see
[28:18] the whole Army of God was trembling in
[28:20] fear you know all it took was one
[28:23] inspired little boy
[28:25] isn't that just amazing when you think
[28:26] about that that's how God rolls that's
[28:29] how he is that's who he is he's not
[28:31] going to take the great man that's Head
[28:32] and Shoulders above everyone that's the
[28:34] best looking out of everyone that's the
[28:36] most fit that can run the fastest that
[28:38] has the most money who's the smartest
[28:40] most educated he's going to take a ruddy
[28:43] little Mama's Little is what
[28:44] brother Branham calls Samson anyways but
[28:47] David of someone ready just a little boy
[28:51] but he knew that he was anointed
[28:54] the prophet anointed him you know I'll
[28:56] go this far maybe I'm being a little bit
[28:58] bold tonight but I just feel good I feel
[29:00] inspired brothers and sisters I would
[29:01] say this just like David knew that he
[29:03] was anointed if you truly are a son and
[29:05] daughter of God and you truly have
[29:07] received the message of the hour then
[29:09] you truly have been anointed by the
[29:11] prophet for your day
[29:13] to be Kings and Priests not to be
[29:15] slapped around by the devil not to be
[29:17] taken hostage in prisoner and feel bound
[29:20] and and and and and hold them no no way
[29:24] he's a trespasser
[29:27] we have authority
[29:29] and you know the beautiful part is
[29:30] there's people out there in the
[29:31] denominational world that will just
[29:33] completely uh not talk about the prophet
[29:35] they'll take all the content from the
[29:37] prophet but they won't talk about the
[29:38] profit they won't give credit where
[29:39] credit's due but they'll say that we
[29:41] have all the authority they'll speak all
[29:42] the authority into existence because
[29:45] they know it's there and they'll get
[29:46] results from it but you know what it
[29:48] will only do them so much because they
[29:50] won't have the wedding garment they'll
[29:52] get in through a window somewhere and
[29:53] they'll be on the other side and and
[29:55] they'll be speechless
[29:57] just be speechless you'll say friend
[29:58] how'd you get in here you didn't come
[30:01] the provided way the way that I provided
[30:03] for you and your age
[30:05] or you'd have a wedding garment on
[30:09] you know David when he got inspired he
[30:12] got inspired didn't he
[30:15] he had a revelation by the spirit
[30:18] and then it was confirmed by the word
[30:20] because he was anointed
[30:22] and and to to realize the Revelation
[30:26] here we've got this devil trespassing in
[30:29] the Promised Land
[30:31] where every place the soul of your foot
[30:34] shall tread is yours is what the old Old
[30:37] Testament said the book of Moses said
[30:40] and David knew that
[30:43] so Saul tried to teach him when he got
[30:45] inspired he said no I'll teach you how
[30:46] you know we know that he's he's he's a
[30:49] Warrior from his Youth and you're only a
[30:51] youth you better take my stuff excuse me
[30:54] I love how brother Branham takes it and
[30:55] says you know take take my my theology
[30:58] to take my credentials down with you and
[31:01] and he just can't even lift it and
[31:03] that's what the word says his shield and
[31:05] his sword Saul's shield and sword were
[31:07] just too heavy for him he's like I can't
[31:09] do that I have to go with the Revelation
[31:11] that God's given me you know as I was
[31:13] pondering this I just couldn't help but
[31:15] think isn't it wonderful that God gives
[31:18] us trials in our lives
[31:20] because when he gives us trials in our
[31:22] lives it gives us the ability to see
[31:24] that he is a living God
[31:26] because we overcome our trials if we're
[31:28] living here tonight right now able to be
[31:30] a part of this service or even listen to
[31:32] it in a recording later or or stream it
[31:34] or whatever it is if we're alive and we
[31:36] have breath in our lungs we've had
[31:38] trials
[31:39] we've been sick in our bodies and we've
[31:41] been healed
[31:44] he's met our needs in our lives so many
[31:47] times
[31:48] but David
[31:50] he said I can't do it the way you want
[31:51] me to Saul don't don't don't worry about
[31:53] it I've got a revelation and I'm just
[31:54] going to go my way here you know what
[31:55] one time when I was tending my father
[31:57] sheep
[31:59] a lion came in and stole one
[32:01] and when that lion came in and tried to
[32:04] steal it what does the word say he did
[32:06] he grabbed it by the beard can you
[32:10] imagine that take it and think about it
[32:12] brothers and sisters that's a devil that
[32:15] came in to try and steal one of his
[32:16] father's sheep he grabbed it by the
[32:18] beard and flew it killed it and took the
[32:21] Sheep back and said no way you can't
[32:23] have any of them
[32:25] another time another example he actually
[32:27] must have been given given Saul this
[32:29] testimony service there in the midst of
[32:31] it all of the the Warriors the Valiant
[32:34] men the children of Israel listening to
[32:35] this testimony service that's why
[32:37] testimony services are powerful it puts
[32:39] the Devils on alert they're listening
[32:41] and when they start to hear someone rise
[32:43] up and give example of example of
[32:45] example of God delivering them again and
[32:47] again and again and and to hear him say
[32:50] another time a bear came in and stole
[32:52] one of my father's sheep and I went
[32:54] after him and I slew him too I don't
[32:56] need anything that you've got I've got a
[32:58] real Revelation from the Lord Jesus
[33:00] Christ brothers and sisters if we've got
[33:02] a real Revelation from the Lord Jesus
[33:03] Christ we have the ability to go and
[33:05] apply that in our own lives because it
[33:08] gets confirmed by the word every time we
[33:10] go to church every time we listen to the
[33:12] message of the hour every time we read
[33:14] the Bible every time we go on our knees
[33:15] and pray
[33:20] then we just need to let it manifest
[33:22] we just need to act we just need to go
[33:25] forwards and speak the words
[33:28] because we have the open word in our
[33:30] hands we have the word in our hands
[33:34] so just remember brothers and sisters
[33:36] those those words the question what's in
[33:38] your hands
[33:39] I don't know if sometimes we recognize
[33:42] the power that we have the authorities
[33:44] that we have who we really are we know
[33:46] that brother Bradham says when the
[33:47] church recognizes what it is then the
[33:49] Rapture will go and that's why I just
[33:51] felt so inspired to go this way tonight
[33:53] to talk about it what's in our hands
[33:55] brothers and sisters it's the pearl of
[33:57] great price it's the entirety of all the
[34:00] ages the culmination of all the ages the
[34:02] message of the hour the open book
[34:05] oh that the the prophets of all desired
[34:09] to look on
[34:10] it's just right here
[34:12] it's just about common for us
[34:14] we can just press play anytime and hear
[34:17] what Daniel desired to see
[34:21] it's amazing to look at
[34:24] so David
[34:26] he said to him I don't need your stuff I
[34:29] don't need your your equipment I don't
[34:31] need your theology I don't need your
[34:33] Revelation I've got mine it was revealed
[34:36] to me by the spirit and it was confirmed
[34:38] to me by the word by the prophet for my
[34:41] day and and now I'm going to go my way
[34:43] according to that Revelation and all's I
[34:46] need is this little sling with the five
[34:47] stones of Faith right
[34:50] and he went down there and he said you
[34:52] know what today
[34:53] you're going to die today I'm going to
[34:56] cut your head off devil you have no more
[34:59] power you have no more authority over me
[35:01] you have no more authority over my
[35:03] family you have no more authority over
[35:05] my church you have no more authority
[35:07] over any one of us because today I take
[35:10] your head off and I show you in the
[35:13] sight of all creation there is a living
[35:15] God and you know brothers and sisters
[35:18] remember that scripture it just came to
[35:20] me when I was studying this that all
[35:22] creation is groaning for the
[35:23] manifestation of the sons of God I
[35:25] believe this was an example of all
[35:27] creation seeing a witness of a true Son
[35:30] of God you know that brother Branham
[35:32] said the word says it even that David
[35:34] was a man after God's Own Heart the one
[35:37] who was a liar he committed adultery he
[35:40] murdered so that he could commit
[35:42] adultery but he was a man after God's
[35:44] Own Heart
[35:46] can you imagine that I'm sure we all
[35:48] have but he was the guy that said I
[35:51] don't need anything that you've got the
[35:52] ideas that you've got everything that
[35:54] you're doing is obviously not working
[35:55] he's still down there boasting so just
[35:58] step aside and let me go down there and
[36:00] I'll deal with this problem to show you
[36:01] guys there is really a living God in
[36:04] Israel
[36:05] and by that Revelation that's what he
[36:07] did and I believe it brothers and
[36:09] sisters as we go forwards in our lives
[36:11] we have the ability to do this this is
[36:14] not something that I'm trying to just do
[36:16] a pep rally and and encourage you
[36:18] although I want to try and encourage
[36:20] everyone's level of Faith to rise to the
[36:22] place where we don't have to tolerate
[36:24] Satan in our lives at any level
[36:28] we are more than Overcomers we are more
[36:30] than conquerors the Bride of Jesus
[36:33] Christ
[36:35] full Authority and Power
[36:38] but think about how how
[36:41] quacked David must have looked to
[36:43] everyone
[36:44] because he was completely out of order
[36:46] from the way all the people were going
[36:48] everyone was going this way it was all
[36:50] happening the way it was supposed to the
[36:53] tradition and everything was fine
[36:56] but we have this devil down here and we
[36:58] just don't know what to do with it but
[37:00] isn't it amazing God always sends a
[37:02] deliverer he always sends someone gives
[37:04] someone a burst of Faith to just go and
[37:07] actually create a testimony and when
[37:09] that happens then it creates more faith
[37:12] in other people
[37:14] David knew that he was anointed to be
[37:17] king
[37:18] and we know that that devil giant said
[37:20] what am I a dog
[37:22] that you would send a boy out to kill me
[37:24] you would send a boy out to challenge me
[37:27] but David said how dare you
[37:30] how dare you come against
[37:33] a son of God
[37:36] I just believe with all my heart tonight
[37:38] brothers and sisters
[37:40] I say that
[37:43] I just say it
[37:45] it's amazing how my ears are starting to
[37:47] ring right now as I say these words how
[37:50] dare Satan come against a son or a
[37:53] daughter of God
[37:55] can you imagine how bold that is
[37:58] for Satan to do that
[38:00] remember Revelations 20 verse 10 and the
[38:03] devil that deceived them was cast alive
[38:06] into a burning Lake of Fire
[38:09] that's his
[38:10] future
[38:15] David said
[38:17] how dare you come against the Son of God
[38:19] today I will destroy you
[38:23] in front of everyone all these people
[38:25] that are witnessing you trespassing will
[38:28] now witness you die
[38:32] we have the ability brothers and sisters
[38:35] and we know that in that moment it
[38:37] wasn't David speaking
[38:39] that wasn't David
[38:41] that was the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:43] speaking through David
[38:46] that all the Earth may know that there
[38:48] is a bride
[38:50] and that there is a God a Living Word
[38:54] inside his bride
[38:58] and by all of this
[39:00] this entire assembly shall know
[39:04] that the Lord saveth not with spear
[39:06] sword
[39:07] for the battle is the Lord's
[39:14] just to think about that
[39:16] he will take the enemy and put them into
[39:19] your hand
[39:21] this isn't exclusive to David this is an
[39:23] example for the True Believer I believe
[39:24] it
[39:26] and and really
[39:28] just a quick example out of the message
[39:32] is pick up your pen and write
[39:35] but I feel like
[39:37] some people are afraid of it
[39:39] some people are afraid of that statement
[39:41] that whole entire part of the message to
[39:44] pick up your pen and write
[39:45] like it's going to be out there
[39:47] somewhere in the future
[39:49] or maybe we just can't grasp what that
[39:52] actually is saying
[39:54] but I just I would just like to
[39:56] encourage everyone read that
[39:59] pick up your pen and write what the
[40:01] spirit says to the prophet for our day
[40:05] I know some people will say well if they
[40:07] don't have thus Faith the Lord they keep
[40:08] still but the prophet says before that
[40:11] she has thus saith the Lord
[40:15] so what are we afraid of
[40:17] when Satan comes knocking on our door
[40:19] and tries to give us a box of
[40:20] rattlesnakes what do we do with it
[40:24] I was talking to brother Henry about
[40:26] this we can peek Inside the Box
[40:30] we could get bit
[40:32] don't even Peak Brothers and Sisters
[40:34] if it's a box of rattlesnakes give it
[40:36] back
[40:38] just give it back
[40:40] pick up your pen and write
[40:43] we have the ability to speak the word
[40:45] brothers and sisters there's coming a
[40:47] Time
[40:47] where that door is going to close
[40:51] we know in Noah's day when everything
[40:53] was finished
[40:55] brother Bradham says invisible uni the
[40:56] bride when they were standing at the
[40:58] bottom of that Glacier looking for that
[40:59] Glacier of fire the man beside him he
[41:02] actually voiced all things are ready Let
[41:05] the Fire Fall
[41:07] it's an amazing little part of that
[41:09] message I don't know if you're familiar
[41:10] with it but if you hear them say it the
[41:13] way he talks it's almost like he's
[41:15] talking about something going to happen
[41:17] but a voice beside him says that you
[41:20] know in Noah's day they got into the ark
[41:22] at the command of God and it wasn't Noah
[41:24] that closed that door
[41:28] in Esther's day there was a proclamation
[41:31] that went out for all the Jews to be
[41:32] destroyed the Devils just working their
[41:35] wisdom trying to get all the Jews to be
[41:37] destroyed but you know the story we'll
[41:39] dig into it later but just you know I
[41:42] couldn't help but think about it that
[41:44] that in Hell back then there must have
[41:46] been a staff meeting
[41:48] they must have had a real good staff
[41:49] meeting
[41:51] that they just need to destroy all the
[41:53] Jews and then they'll stop that that
[41:55] that that root of David from coming
[41:57] they'll stop that from ever happening
[41:59] and and there will never be that perfect
[42:02] sacrifice that will happen if they just
[42:04] could exterminate all the Jews right
[42:07] but there was a new prophecy that came
[42:08] forth
[42:09] and that new prophecy was the
[42:11] Proclamation for all the Jews to stand
[42:13] up for themselves
[42:15] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[42:17] to raise up a standard against that
[42:20] enemy and slay them
[42:22] and we know that that's exactly what
[42:24] happened there was many people that got
[42:26] slayed in in that day but I just want to
[42:29] try and take that and and type it to
[42:31] devils
[42:33] even though we can have an enemy come
[42:35] against us to take our lives we have the
[42:38] ability another proclamation to take the
[42:41] life of the enemy that one that wants to
[42:42] oppress us that one that wants to come
[42:44] against us that wants to come against
[42:46] our marriage that wants to come against
[42:47] our our family our children our parents
[42:50] whatever it is we have the ability to
[42:53] defy that devil in the name of Jesus
[42:55] Christ to take its head off in the sight
[42:57] of all creation so that they can see all
[43:00] creation all the other Devils can see
[43:02] that there is a living God in his bride
[43:05] today this isn't something we just talk
[43:07] about it's something that we live it's
[43:09] Who We Are
[43:11] we don't have to tolerate Satan brothers
[43:13] and sisters the last one that I'm going
[43:15] to talk about tonight in nine minutes is
[43:18] shamgar Judges 3 verse 31 if you'll turn
[43:21] there with me Judges 3 verse 31.
[43:25] there's only a couple of verses in the
[43:28] entire Bible where his name is mentioned
[43:32] but in this message that I I referred to
[43:35] what is in thine hand brother Branham he
[43:37] just paints this picture he tells this
[43:39] story so good and I'll just try and and
[43:42] just paraphrase it quickly here before
[43:44] we close verse 31 of Judges chapter 3
[43:47] and after him was shamgar the son of
[43:50] anath which slew of the Philistines 600
[43:54] men with an ox code
[43:56] and he also delivered Israel
[44:01] think about our testimonies brothers and
[44:03] sisters this is another reason why I
[44:06] just feel it's so important to have the
[44:07] testimony service to be able to talk and
[44:10] say what God's doing in our life Satan
[44:13] doesn't want us to talk about what God's
[44:14] do in our lives Satan wants us to just
[44:16] be quiet and keep it cool and and not
[44:18] talk about God being a living God in our
[44:20] lives because when it happens it
[44:22] increases faith it causes people to
[44:24] become encouraged and say you know if
[44:26] God would actually meet him on those
[44:28] terms then maybe he would meet me on on
[44:30] on the same terms and the same thing
[44:32] with the sisters in everyone's lives the
[44:35] children everyone has the opportunity to
[44:37] see the Lord actually manifest in their
[44:39] lives
[44:40] you know in this little tiny verse here
[44:43] brother Branham tells how the past few
[44:45] years the Philistines would come in and
[44:46] just maraud them after they would take
[44:48] in their Harvest and and how after their
[44:50] their Harvest was there and the
[44:52] Philistines would come in they would
[44:54] take all their food that would carry
[44:55] them over the winter
[44:57] can you imagine that it's what happens
[44:59] when Satan comes into our lives and we
[45:02] don't actually deal with them correctly
[45:04] he takes away this food that we actually
[45:06] take into our lives this this food that
[45:09] comes at Harvest Time and and is stored
[45:12] up for this season when we press play
[45:14] and we listen when when when the enemy
[45:16] has come in like a flood if we don't
[45:18] deal with them correctly then when we
[45:19] play press play or read or pray
[45:23] it's just not as nourishing it just
[45:24] doesn't happen the way that it should
[45:26] spiritually and so the Philistines come
[45:28] in and they actually come in to actually
[45:30] Murad and and take all the grain again
[45:32] but this one time
[45:35] this one time
[45:37] they start coming down the road and in
[45:39] shamgari hears them brother Branham says
[45:41] he hears the Thump Thump Thump Thump
[45:44] marching down the road and he knows it's
[45:45] the Philistines coming in again to take
[45:47] their grain this winter and he sees his
[45:50] wife she's getting uneasy she's starting
[45:52] to cry because she knows what this means
[45:54] and it's getting the children upset the
[45:55] children are saying Daddy what's going
[45:57] on why is mama upset is that the bad guy
[46:00] coming again and shamgar he's just like
[46:03] you know we've dealt with this in the
[46:05] past and they've they've gotten away
[46:07] with it and gotten away with it but not
[46:08] this time not this time no in the name
[46:11] of Jesus Christ and he grabs the ox goat
[46:13] and he goes out and slays all of them
[46:15] 600 of them and turns the enemy to
[46:18] flight just destroys them
[46:22] brothers and sisters
[46:24] we have the ability to do that in our
[46:26] own lives
[46:27] that's the encouragement that I wanted
[46:29] to bring to us tonight but what's in
[46:30] your hand
[46:32] do you have that aux code do you have
[46:34] that sling do you have the sword of the
[46:37] word is it an open book or or are we
[46:40] just sort of somewhere stuck maybe we
[46:42] haven't seen God activate his word in
[46:44] our life to such a degree where we
[46:46] actually see the results
[46:48] he wants to show us results in our lives
[46:51] but how does that come it comes with a
[46:53] greater sacrifice
[46:55] we've got to be willing to give more
[46:57] he's not going to come on our terms we
[47:00] have got to come on his terms but
[47:02] brothers and sisters if we have the
[47:03] ability to hear his voice if we have the
[47:06] ability to want to worship him then
[47:08] there's something in us that will easily
[47:10] come on his terms it doesn't take very
[47:12] much sometimes it's only just a tiny
[47:15] little Revival in our lives just a
[47:16] little tiny prayer meeting can set that
[47:18] that that that bondage those those bonds
[47:21] that are on our our arms holding us back
[47:24] keeping us from seeing the promises of
[47:26] God in our lives
[47:28] sometimes it just takes a little tiny
[47:30] bit and then those bonds go and you know
[47:32] what brother Branham says he says it
[47:34] with Divine Healing but I'll say it with
[47:36] anything that we're Afflicted with
[47:39] he says go with a pulsation
[47:42] you know sometimes we're inspired to do
[47:44] something and if we go and do it when
[47:46] we're inspired to do it
[47:47] amazing things happen
[47:50] but if we just let that inspiration pass
[47:52] by
[47:53] we might not get that inspiration ever
[47:55] again
[47:56] brother Bradham says that Christ might
[47:58] only talk to us one time in our entire
[48:00] lives
[48:01] I know in my life I heard his voice
[48:04] and nobody can take it away from me it's
[48:08] true man I heard it that might be your
[48:10] last call
[48:12] and I knew what that meant in my heart
[48:15] even though I didn't have a relationship
[48:16] with God that I knew of I I wasn't
[48:19] in fellowship with the Lord at the time
[48:22] but we know brother Branham says it in
[48:25] the message God doesn't call a man to
[48:26] judgment without first warning him every
[48:28] man hears from God before he dies every
[48:32] man
[48:34] we don't know what what God's been
[48:35] saying to the man
[48:37] but that man does brother Branham in
[48:39] that message he says the man just might
[48:40] brush it off and say oh it's just a
[48:42] funny feeling just a funny feeling
[48:43] that's all
[48:44] and he says it's not
[48:46] you can hear him say it in that
[48:48] but I just believe it brothers and
[48:50] sisters I want to encourage us to
[48:51] remember that we've got an open book
[48:53] we've got an ox code we've got that
[48:55] sling we've got the the entire word in
[48:58] our hands
[48:59] that we can take to the heart of the
[49:01] enemy and when we see the enemy come in
[49:03] he's a trespasser he has no right he has
[49:07] no right
[49:09] but he'll tell us that he has every
[49:10] right
[49:12] our flesh
[49:13] every right our mind
[49:15] every right
[49:17] our relationships
[49:19] every right our church
[49:21] it's the Devil he's a trespasser and he
[49:23] has no rights none because Christ
[49:26] stripped them all from him when he went
[49:28] to Calvary
[49:31] once and for all
[49:33] and I just believe it brothers and
[49:35] sisters that God is waiting for us to
[49:38] stand up for ourselves
[49:42] stand up for ourselves and just say no
[49:44] not this time
[49:46] you've done it many times but not this
[49:48] time this time I defy you in the name of
[49:52] the Living God
[49:53] this time I say no
[49:56] no
[49:59] and and just overcome
[50:02] might not know how
[50:04] I know for me I can only talk about my
[50:07] experience
[50:08] I had to do that when I came to church I
[50:11] had to say oh my I I think I know a lot
[50:13] of scriptures and I I was raised in the
[50:15] Pentecostal church but you know what I
[50:17] had to do I had to take it all and count
[50:19] it as dumb just like Paul did and say no
[50:21] I want you to reveal yourself to me as a
[50:24] living God today I want to take you as
[50:27] as a man just like I would take take
[50:29] part in any of these other things in the
[50:31] world I want to take part in the Lord
[50:32] Jesus Christ I want you to reveal
[50:34] yourself so much to me that I know that
[50:37] you truly are a living God and actually
[50:39] my prayer when I first started coming
[50:41] around was that I want you to feel me so
[50:43] full of your Holy Spirit Lord that
[50:45] there's just no room for anything else
[50:46] in this world just nothing else in this
[50:48] world there was nothing else in this
[50:50] world that I want more than you in me
[50:54] and you know
[50:55] he answered my prayer
[50:58] he will answer your prayer when you ask
[51:00] according to his word but you know what
[51:02] it's got to be revealed by the spirit
[51:04] confirmed by the word and it will
[51:06] manifest by the fruit it bears in your
[51:08] life and when that happens it just is a
[51:10] Perpetual thing you just can't get
[51:12] enough just keep coming back to The Well
[51:14] of Grace my goodness maybe stand with me
[51:18] tonight we'll try and wrap it up here
[51:20] but but shamgar he took an ox code and
[51:23] thrashed 600 men
[51:25] think about all the Devils that you
[51:27] could thrash with an open word that was
[51:30] an ox code
[51:31] and we know that's just basically a
[51:32] stick with a brass end on it but the
[51:34] Bride of Jesus Christ today his elect
[51:36] lady
[51:38] she has Authority
[51:41] we don't have to tolerate occupying
[51:45] enemies
[51:47] in our lives in our families in our
[51:50] church we don't have to do that brothers
[51:52] and sisters
[51:55] but I think Satan he just wants us to
[51:57] sugarcoat it he wants us to just keep it
[51:59] under the rug don't don't make don't
[52:01] make a scene keep it cool
[52:04] right remember the story in Samson we've
[52:07] got the occupiers in the land and we
[52:08] don't want to get the Philistines upset
[52:09] so now we're just going to take you and
[52:11] deliver you to them so that they'll just
[52:13] keep it cool and we'll keep the peace in
[52:15] the land when they should have been
[52:17] saying no we want to get behind you and
[52:19] take you up there and and just have a
[52:21] prayer meeting and just allow you to
[52:23] thrash all of them and get them all out
[52:24] of here is what they should have been
[52:26] doing he was the one with the ball
[52:28] they should have been getting right
[52:29] behind their brother
[52:31] foreign
[52:33] Brothers and Sisters Let's just rise up
[52:35] in the mighty name of Jehovah and Slay
[52:37] Slay the Devils that haunts us we don't
[52:40] have to tolerate them
[52:42] you don't have to tolerate them we don't
[52:44] have to tolerate them
[52:46] just rise up in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:50] and just shake off those bonds forever
[52:52] don't shake them off today and put them
[52:55] on tomorrow
[52:58] don't wake up the old man
[53:00] let him die
[53:02] every single Speck of them
[53:04] just let them die
[53:06] let that old man pass away let that old
[53:10] carnality just go
[53:15] out of the Palmer worm canker worm
[53:17] caterpillar and Locust in 1953 shamgar
[53:22] didn't have no sword he didn't have
[53:24] nothing about it if he had one
[53:28] he didn't have a shield
[53:31] but if he'd a shield
[53:34] he wouldn't know how to use it
[53:37] he was just a simple farmer
[53:39] but there came a point in his life where
[53:41] he said that's enough
[53:43] look what you're doing to my family
[53:45] look what you're doing to all of Israel
[53:49] but if he had a shield he wouldn't know
[53:51] how to use it but he reached up and he
[53:53] got an ox go that's an old stick that's
[53:55] got a brass lump on the end of it they
[53:58] beat the ox through the Corral with it
[54:00] and he jumped out that window out there
[54:02] in the middle of that road against 600
[54:05] armed Philistines and killed every one
[54:08] of them
[54:10] what was it
[54:13] Holy Spirit Come on him
[54:15] Hallelujah
[54:17] but you know in those days they say the
[54:20] Holy Spirit wasn't yet given
[54:22] but here we have the prophet for our day
[54:24] saying that was the Holy Spirit that
[54:25] came on him the life of Jesus Christ
[54:27] came on him and he went out and slew all
[54:30] those devils
[54:32] he jumped out the window he took action
[54:35] he got after it and he finally said I'm
[54:38] tired of this I don't have to tolerate
[54:39] this anymore they're trespassing on my
[54:42] land they're coming against the promises
[54:44] of God he said that we would we would
[54:46] build and no one will inhabit and that
[54:49] will will prosper
[54:51] but these guys come in and think that
[54:53] they can just take over and take
[54:54] everything that we've worked so hard for
[54:56] no no that holy spirit rose up at him
[55:00] what was it the Holy Spirit Come on him
[55:02] Hallelujah there was a need
[55:05] there was a need there was an emergency
[55:08] something had to be done
[55:10] imagine brothers and sisters he didn't
[55:12] go and have a prayer meeting
[55:14] he didn't he didn't go and fast for a
[55:17] week
[55:18] he didn't listen to the most messages
[55:20] he's ever listened to
[55:22] he acted
[55:24] it was an emergency and he went after it
[55:27] there was a need there was an emergency
[55:29] something had to be done he couldn't
[55:31] wait till he got an education learn how
[55:34] to fight and be a warrior and train up
[55:37] he had to take what was in his hand
[55:40] and go do something with it
[55:43] and brother
[55:45] what's that close to you tonight
[55:49] what's that close to us tonight brothers
[55:51] and sisters
[55:52] you've at least got the baptism of the
[55:55] Holy Ghost
[55:56] this whole group here and I say that
[55:58] here this whole group here everybody
[56:01] here the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:03] you've at least got the baptism of the
[56:06] Holy Ghost this whole group here you
[56:08] raised your hands what's that the
[56:11] greatest weapon you can put in your
[56:14] hands foreign
[56:17] with the word of God behind it to back
[56:19] it up
[56:21] he says this don't let them rob you
[56:25] don't let them rob you
[56:28] we don't have to let them Rob us
[56:29] brothers and sisters
[56:31] he wants to come in and steal
[56:33] he wants to come in and lie
[56:35] he wants to come in and destroy
[56:38] but isn't it amazing
[56:40] how we just carry on
[56:44] remember if Satan had his way
[56:47] we would be destroyed
[56:49] he would snuff us out like that
[56:52] if he could think about all the trials
[56:55] we go through think about how many miles
[56:57] we've come in our lives
[56:59] and we're still here
[57:02] through many dangers toils and snares my
[57:05] goodness
[57:06] brothers and sisters you know afterwards
[57:10] that's where we meet Melchizedek after
[57:13] the battle is fought
[57:15] after we come to that place
[57:17] where we say enough
[57:19] that's where Melchizedek comes out and
[57:22] serves us communion
[57:24] and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:25] revealing himself to us personally
[57:28] giving us of himself
[57:31] the stimulation of Revelation
[57:36] you know
[57:37] once that happens
[57:39] once we have that testimony we've
[57:41] overcome by our testimony
[57:44] Satan can never come in and Rob us again
[57:47] because we begin to recognize his
[57:49] tactics we begin to see the patterns and
[57:52] when we see those patterns happening
[57:53] then we can just identify it and then we
[57:56] can just rebuke it in the name of Jesus
[57:57] Christ not bring a railing accusation
[57:59] against it just simply speak the word
[58:00] and go forwards and know that he's going
[58:02] to back it up and not let him Rob us
[58:05] anymore
[58:06] not be a trespasser
[58:08] not welcome an unwelcome guest that just
[58:11] won't leave
[58:13] he has to leave and that's the beautiful
[58:15] part it's not like he just might leave
[58:18] and and if we speak the word that maybe
[58:20] he'll leave and that's the trick of the
[58:21] devil he wants us to to believe that
[58:23] that's the case but you know he has to
[58:27] he has to leave
[58:30] if we go according to the word
[58:33] let's just bow in prayer
[58:35] gracious Heavenly Father
[58:38] tonight Lord Jesus we just thank you for
[58:41] your word

[59:42] great price for that ultimate Revelation
