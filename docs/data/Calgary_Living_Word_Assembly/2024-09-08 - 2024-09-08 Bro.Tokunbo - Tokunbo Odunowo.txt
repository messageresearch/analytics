strings of your children give praises and honor unto you let it be again father we shall be com to give you Thanksgiving and praises and honor in your name the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen and amen amen please you can be seated I'm very grateful unto God for this opportunity to have it as that uh my last service will be at Calgary [Music] my first service I believe was at Le bridge and I have had one here I've had the privilege of traveling uh a few places in your country and I've have the privilege of sitting in the midst of rich men speaking the word of God and I've had the privilege also of Breen hearing the word of God from me this morning I first want to thank the pastor for the opportunity of preaching to service in your church the opportunity of being Pastor to a host of our family our Dynasty and also for supporting the leth brid church where also so I had opportunity to preach every family that has shown your love to me to our children I want to thank everybody something is unique in this assembly and that is what I design the Oneness the unity at least what man can see I want to thank God for that this morning I I'm going to speak to you as if I'm speaking to my home church because we are one in the faith one body one baptism one spirit because we are going the same way traveling the same way and we are supposed to be each other's keeper and we as ministers are supposed to operate within the Ambit of his grace and the anointing yes of the ministry that has committed unto us in the fivefolds and that if we love ourselves what we have to do is to help each other to fight the battle harder and higher amen and that is why I believe God has laid in my heart to ask us to study the message how can I overcome before we can [Music] overcome we have to know what we need to overcome right before we can overcome we have to know where we are at that is what we want to look at the title of the message is where are we spiritually amen where are we where is Cal Church spiritually where is every individual spiritually and I took that from the prophets in the seven Church which are you conversant with about P 36 the prophet said 96 of the old Salon book this is an 8 8857 book so he said where where oh where are we spiritually he was talking of the church of his time he was talking of the pente of the time he said we are in a Wilderness of Darkness how far we have wandered from the first church of Pentecost the Church of Pentecost is nowhere in View and the word cannot be found that does not mean this local assembly it doesn't mean the bride in this real of the thought pool of the ministry of the Prophet it means those who may be hearing brother Braham may have heard him but they remained in the realm of the Pentecostal denomination right and we have had almost the on that have been here we have been hearing about the evil and danger of denomination that's right and the denomination simply means substitution denomination simply means substitution If the message says put this up and I put this up though they are papers white they have inscriptions on them I have substituted the message and the prophet of the Lord told us that substitution is not only as a group an individual can substitute the message a family can decide this is what we want to do despite the fact that the message said do it this way and also I want you to know that no matter how small no matter how little the thing is whether conduct whether order whether Doctrine no matter how small it is it will not go through the future of God right and as bright material amen if it does not pass as bright material it cannot pass as wife material right amen we are going to talk about those things this morning our scripture we are starting from numbers 13 verse 20 and verse 21 Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 30 and verse 31 we are going to see two accounts two groups and they are testimony of one message the testimony of one visitation and we are going to see how God dealt with them that is the way the unchanging God is dealing with us that was in the first Exodus this is the Third Exodus right and it is exactly the same thing in Ghana they will say the same thing that means that exactly s is the truth the national greed that is off I believe that God has a purpose in it because brother Brown says being spiritual we will see something that God is doing in every situation I believe that God is telling us by the national g that is off that our whole life at this time should be placed on the message of the hour alone every other thing will fail amen this is not strange to me at home we have the national g eratic but it's St to you God wants you to know that the only place that you can place your faith in this journey young and old is exactly 100% of what brother has told us not because it is brother Branham but because brother Bram is the voice of God to this last days Jehovah God enveloped himself with the body that we call Brother Braham Jehovah God impersonated himself in brother Braham it is not impersonating Jehovah Jehovah himself emptied himself can himself into that man and when his word is do say the Lord amen that you and I should know that what Jehovah demands from me is what brother has said may God help us numbers 13 Verse 30 and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen the second testimony but the man that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we he looked at it with the eyes of man looking at man amen Caleb looked at it in the with the eyes of God looking at God David looked at Goliath with the eyes of God yes sir and he saw God overcoming him one failed one was accepted that is how our Jehovah father God is looking at every heart there's conduct there's order there's doct in the Church of the Living God and that's what makes up the Bible That's all that the message is that's why this book is a compendium of the of the message of the Prophet this is seven church we are going to read also from Ephesians [Music] 4 I trust God that I will not take your [Music] time because I know we have another program Ephesians chapter 4 from verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the Saints they were Saints that's right but they must be perfected am that is not all for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ or the building up the of the body of Christ my friend is looking at me and he knows that building is not just somebody coming somewhere and then put some gravel and then you go building has its steps it stages until the final stage is accomplished the building is not yet a building that can be accommodated remember that it goes on to say that for the edifying of the body of Christ till we we all we that is why I said I want to speak to you as if I'm speaking to my home Church am we all until my home church becomes the individuals of God in it become becomes the The Dwelling Place of the almighty God where he becomes one with him and one with each one and then one in calary and all over the nations of the world we are not going in the Rapture brother AB said that God Christ is not going home with a part of his body not there that is why it says Paul for seeing these things told us that it is till we all come in the unity of the faith it is not the unity of faith it is not my faith it is in the unity of the one faith we must be United in the one faith if the prophet says that this this leave must be like this in the Church of God if it's like this in my church it's not right and if Pastor Barry comes to our church being a faithful Minister he will tell us after the finance of everything everything well I'm going I'm going back to Canada we don't have eratic electricity there I'm going back to my country but he will say but please I noticed that this strand must be like this and if we are truly God's children we will tell we ask him where do you sit it shows us that this is the message we must the message that is our life because that's the voice of God changing from William Braham to bury Johnson we don't see like that that he wants to Wants to Rule us be and we throw it back we are throwing God away from our amen amen because it's not brother Barry it is the word of God they will all come to the unity of the faith and the knowled of the Son of God to a perfect manto the measure of a sture of the fullness of Christ it's not just coming to Perfection it is coming to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and because we are all Bible readers you will know that Paul mentioned that full of Christ many other places coming to the sometimes you will say coming to a portion where we are [Music] blameless and that started from the Old Testament God's demand for his church is to come to Perfection Perfection of himself perfection in the states that he is because they are husband and wife yes from the Old Testament it could not be done here because the law cannot perfect anything because the blood of the Lord is the blood of goats and Bulls and Rams that is the blood of the Kingdom where we fell where our mother eve took us right we fell there and so their blood cannot perfect us that was why God had to come in his own blood amen and the blood is the bleeding bloody word hallelujah amen and everything that he says to us I'm sorry I'm shouting I'm shouting because there's no Nea sorry Nea is the nans are laughing there's no national g that's why I'm shouting the bleeding bloody words yes is what gave us this salvation amen that's why our men today are not in be Palace right that's why our women are not on the streets that's why we are not jumping and shouting and speaking in tongues and caros in the same church and we say we in church that's why we are decent people that we are we are made what we are because of the portion of the message that we believe Hallelujah there are message Believers so-call message Believers that are not like this right we are coming to the measure of the fullness of Christ amen that we henceforth be no more children because we are growing we are moving to a Perfection we are moving to the fullness of Christ there's a growth yes sir let me give you a testimony by the grace of God have finished my studying over and over and over and over but this morning I I first strongly to listen to the message God's being misunderstood that brother Brown would say when he was preaching the seals that if the angel didn't come I would have said something wrong if I didn't read that Salon book this morning if I didn't listen to that Salon book this morning I would have said something wrong I pre that salmon I've looked at it over and over I've answered questions with it over the years but my my my thinking about one thing I want to talk about was C I don't know why but God had to take me to listen to that and when I listen to it all my thoughts frizzled away they must frizzled away because the master is talking the Lord has spoken what I thought was right the master said it's wrong and that was what I was thanking God for in pastor's room that if God helped me to see that it was a prage that I believe that God will also help me to see what he will present to us am and then all will be well am Paul says but speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him in all things from our inside to our outsides right from our feet to our head from our legs the tip there to the tip here you remember in the holy of holies the tip of one k must touch the wall the tip of the other must touch the second and the same thing there and they must look to each other yes sir because they are guiding angel of of Jehovah and the the the the the the Mery seat will be here we are doing the same thing it must be exactly the same amen because we are here for him the prophet said the Bride on Earth is the strength of God on Earth in other words the way God wants to appear to people will be represented in my sister and my sister and my and everyone the way he wants to be seen on Earth today under the BR po Ministry yes the final pool amen the pool of the manifestation of the world what we have accumulated from the first po second P 33 63 until 65 and it went and then the the churched groping in darkness and what they don't know not darkness of Darkness but the darkness of their mind they don't know what's happened when brother left the bre in America they don't know what happened what we do the man that they have always looked at is gone what are we going to do then they also now started growing from the message right the Lily growing from the M struggling the way God say to be that is the nature that God has compelled on it it must struggle it must fight and it must the figh and then when it gets to the water up in the water then it shows you and I the glory that God has inherent Glory the inherent glory god now brings it out and it is beautiful to our eyes beauty is in the eye of the beholder it doesn't Reon to us as bad it reckons to us as beautiful the Beast will come they will do have their parts the the the the the the the the Young and a young woman I want to give themselves go call their por and give this is my all my but it struggles it overcame to come to that when it is that that is when we can call it lily flower right it's showing God's glory you and I are to show God's strength God's Beauty as a branch from the vine tree of God Amen that is why these men were anointed to speak these things to us and God brought brother Braham open them and as we studed them they unfold and the prophet said when the word unfolds the bride also will unfold amen because the word is the food of the Bride right that is why he does not only wash us from inside to outside he also washes us from outside to inside from up to down and down to up you remember when he built the uh Moses Temple when he was given the specification to Moses he started from outside to inside then he told him the same thing inside outside to inside inside to outside that's why is doing with us so that we will measure Our lives our spirituality by his word using his word as plumbline as ytic as pattern as standard of our very being amen amen amen in everything amen and what is what succeeds in fullness he will present to this world Mystics exactly right amen paradoxes the Power House of God where God can and say Daniel brother didn't understand what is do this just that brother understands am because that God is fully formed in brother Daniel God has so much confidence in brother Daniel that he will didn't do otherwise because he himself had worked upon him how by the words at his spirits speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even chrisis you see Paul repeating growing growing into him growing that's our life amen I will also read lastly Mark 16 to see when we are Overcomers what will be in our midst or what must be in our midst what must be in our midst because our God wants to show himself t C assembly C living what assembly must not only gather as a unit amen but must gather as a power house where from the neighborhood God will send people to you from the from within us God will raise somebody up and say go to the street that is very far from here somebody's there he has this problem take Pastor they want you to pray for them pray for them that what supposed to be when the bread has become the wife of the Lamb so you see how far I am supposed to be how far I I'm still from where I'm supposed to be but he has made a way we will see that he made the way in the commission that he gave to us to go and tell he already put everything in his position it's our duty to open up in our dedication and our surrender and our consecration to open up to him so that he can use the Avenues of his glory The Avenues of his attributes if they are no sick we can never know him as Jehovah if we don't have we can never know him and if we are sick and we don't go to him even though we be Believers he can never manifest himself the prop pre the message the presence of God unrecognized the presence of God is there but if it is not recognized if it's not called to come and dwell with me if the disciples didn't tell him at that day Lord care not that we perish yes sir he will not come up the Sheep will not capsize yes sir but he will not come up but when they woke up from all their human efforts [Music] amen isn't he in his ship with us let go wake him up it is his duty to take care of us and he came peace be still amen and the storm was over yes Amen in the distress of David when Israel sinned and God allowed Satan to make Satan to walk on David David said go number Israel and said King live forever there's no need to number them Jehovah has already told us what will be he said who is King here are you the king sorry sir and then he went and numbered them and God had a prison against them yes sir he sent a plague on them David chose what he wanted I don't want to disuss myself before the Nations because David can never lose a war right if he has chosen to lose a war then the Ty would not be there right we must have the Ty so he chose God be and when God saw what was happening God himself said it is enough to that angel amen is enough and there was quiet and out of that church listen out of that seeming evil that was where Mountain Moria was resuscitated to take his position what happened in Abraham's time where Abraham took Isaac to to sacrifice him on that same Mountain it was owned at that time by a gentile but it was God's own eye the mountain the mountain top the mountain s in Jerusalem is the eye of God on Earth that's the center of the world that's the most important Landmark on the face of the Earth it was owned by a deite and God used David to claim it right the Temple Mount became where the temple was behind it was where he died as our Isaac it took that so correction is not not anything big in the Church of God he must correct us and we must to correction amen why does it correct us Paul told us in Hebrews it corrects us because we are his children it doesn't correct bastards if if even corrects them they cannot take they don't have what the we with to receive correction he says here in Mark 16 from verse 15 he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take off serpents and if they drink any deadly thing they shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen so then after the Lord has spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and he sat down on the right hand all the power of God and they in cagri went forth and preach everywhere amen one two and the Lord who sent them to preach was walking with them and confirming the words not their own words but his own words amen with signs following him am let us start from there it is the duty of every individual believer brother says every individual believer to go and tell how you got saved yes sir a true testimony how many people are in both TI today in this place how many will place up their hands it's only me my friend and myself the in ties long ti so if the go TI the go to TI is B all they here will come to us if the go to TI go to is just any time all the men here that are not it people must go to them right that is how God is a god of details right he means what he says he says what he means amen and his own because they will hear him my sheep they hear my voice the voice of another they will not follow they will hear it a thousand voices brother says about the oncoming storm he said the uncoming storm is coming to everybody whether Believers or unbelievers brother BR says to us that every individual will be individually and privately tested not you but your faith the trial of our faith what does it mean the trial of your revelation of the message what is revealed to you everybody will hear it how is it revealed to you what does it mean to you amen what does it mean this verse when we read it in the scriptures what does it mean to me went forth and preached does it mean to me crowd of Believers if Pastor is not there Deon is not there TR is not there we cannot evangelize no no it's not that am he talking to the individual right he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches if you have read that book recently you see that brother brah stopped and emphasized that that command is not talking to the she the she is the church is the assembly he's talking to he who has ears he the indiv indidual am Brother Dan Brother Henry Don is not here I know that those words very well brother cap what does that scripture mean to you in your neighborhood with your co-workers it's not only in our lives that we will testify but we must talk right how do we approach them when we talk to them some people don't have not had this message before they baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost they don't know better right they are children of God they are fine people but we know it and we keep it here or in our homes the way that c c gry I miss C gr with Calvary I should be very happy will miss your names with the place this is a place that is the [Music] place the way to look at this thing is that this whole Bible is talking about me amen and how much have I done what he said he do if we don't go he will not follow us if he doesn't follow us we will not see the signs that are supposed to follow us and so if you go back to seven Church Ages page 250 we will see that he will not count our assembly as haven't grown to make it he will ask us questions when it's not that we not get there we'll get there but it will ask us question why did you not have this signs and miracles and wonders in your midst it's there you get there I think together we are to be here in his T we are to take his position that I'm quoting from that book we have to take his position on Earth what do you want to say about it what is your thinking about it if you enter into that by the grace of God the assembly will be more beautiful the glory of the Lord will shine the more in your midst sin will not be able to stand in your midst because brother BR told us that when somebody has done something wrong at home and he doesn't put it right God will call it out anas and safas will not be able to stay in your midst it will be an assembly to the glory and the honor of God every time where are we spiritually my my my my my subject is Overcoming By the word by the Holy Ghost baptism by sincerity correction and faith those who read that book that sermon will notice something that you must also look at properly you remember that brother Braham said at the beginning of that message excuse me he said it was supposed to be it was supposed to preach a a the Bible study Sunday School then he said he came back home late so he could not study completely study what he had in mind for that Sunday school he said but I had a brother spoke and from the notes I made from him I've taken this text to come and preach to you today look at your pastor is taking notes majority of this church you don't take notes it is a fundamental part of the ministry of the Prophet that it says bring your notes and pencils what is the reason he says when you get back home you will look at it you will pray over it you will study it if you don't do it you cannot the three cannot follow so you come to church on Sunday you listen to somebody oh it's great Pastor is great Pastor has done well today this and this and then you get home uh what we have gravy of this of salad of this in another 24 hours you have lost 50% of the third day V of it will remain but if you have your note which is following the order of the church it's an order it is not it is not a thinking it's not just brother suggested it is an order of the Church of the Living God because he wants us to grow what you have here in church is not sufficient your memory of what you here in church is not sufficient for the week if you don't do it you are not following the message totally the angel of the Lord will be here say these people are so disobedient yes that's what he will say remember what he told us the Tor in the home yeah he will go back to the father and say your children are so good they dress well to church the sisters are so beautifully dressed and this but God what we going to do for this people didn't know how to write don't they have papers in their schools in their in their homes didn't they read the prophets when you read that part of the message what how do you feel do you judge yourself right brother Brown will say I stop so that that will sink in amen it's not that we should Endeavor we should compul because it's part of our message remove that from the message you are not in the full message amen do you think that brother doesn't know what he didn't know what he said when he said I William Abraham I write down notes when ministers preach if you remember what he said [Music] in in the S he continuously was practically begging the people to come bring your notes and make notes humble yourself he said from where brother has spoken I have made 20 notes brother Bram we can not preach like this in Africa as hard as this at least I'm in a V Church there people that cannot write will stand like of sh will stand and judge Israel in time of Jesus Christ greater thanon you are allate if you don't have the words to overcome you must have the word in the way it is said if you don't have the word if you don't write down you believe that you understand listen the proper father goes on in the message that he gave to me to help me today to preach right today in that message God being misunderstood he said you must ask questions amen so if you hear this seron don't remember what I said how you ask how you going to ask me where where is this one in the in the Bible you have you have you you have passed through Ephesian Church AG in Ephesians church8 the Brethren the church went to the apostles the socalled apostles and they fac them say it was PE prous for church members to face ministers what you are not saying what Paul said therefore you are false because he said because they knew what Paul preached as Paul preach hallelujah amen and they are filled with the Holy Ghost so if you don't remember what I pr today how are you going to confront me not with fight but to ask questions a church that is not asking question can not grow am good brother right yes because it is here there are 19 salmons of question and answers 19 question and answer sermons that's the only way we can know what is your mind amen look if you don't ask questions what will happen is that you will M to your wife your wife or your husband will be the first he preing if she's not spiritual or if she doesn't even understand that is why Paul said the women your women should ask questions when they get home and then as the church we should ask questions from our husbands if we don't do it we cannot grow as well as a church church that does it because there's something lacking when we eat our food nutritionist tell us what to eat if you don't eat it you don't you have not seen children with marasmic children but they T will a big as a PR woman the LI be th the head will be big not no nutrients in the body but he still living take that child I don't want to say bring bring that child to Canada get that somewhere in Nigeria and give him good food right yes yes why was it marasmic because it was done eating all that was available and that is what the same thing in the spirit that's right we don't need anybody to call come and tell us we are all message readers right we when we see it we must eat it if you are confused about it that is why God has placed the fivefold here for you ask them brother say if you allow brother n to preach Jehovah Witness do to you it's you why don't you ask questions because what is pre you don't follow it more than the gates of the church I'll tell you that how many can produce the three quarters of the thought that brother glob Express it's gone it's gone it will work on us for a few moments but it's gone I'm supposed to stop at 12 or 12:30 am I supposed to not normally bring it no I want to know what I'm supposed to stop 12 12 16 minutes if you don't have it you are not respecting the message because you are not following it the way so you will not receive the blessings heaven will not be happy because heaven already has loaded blessings for us that's right amen amen and brother brah says that is how you expel your thoughts that's how the ministers know and that's how the ministers can go and study what you don't know the mins are also human beings they have wives they have their time to spend but if we see that this is recurring in the midst of the people then by the anointing of God they will go and study and bring it from his roots right GL and everybody be happy in the church am amen you see how your latency is don't help the Ministries yes we're not talking about there are things that we can preach and everybody will be Hing but when it comes to this kind of preaching that's right amen we have to swallow the the bitter the pill with water which is the holy spirit Hallelujah when it gets in it to do it Peaceable work of building let us read from seven churches the very introduction of the Church of the book this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as godheads water baptism Etc found in Revelation 1 23 his main them is setting forth the detailed study of the seven Church ages why this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the Revelation if we don't understand the Book of Revelation we are not part of the brides only the bride that understand that book because in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when begin to S the mystery of God will be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets and it is those who receive that Revelation that can be prepared for the coming of the Lord for out of the Ages come the seals out of the seals come the trumpets out of the trumpets come the ve at the first bust of a Roman Candle the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation in know words that in this book shows to you and teaches you the spirits that work in the seven churches amen those Spirits had earlier worked in the seven churches of the Jews of the Hebrews after the seven churches finished it crossed over to us that's why bam Spirit K Spirit B spirit all those spirits come back here and when we have the message it opens them to us when a devil is exposed it becomes powerless that's why tell us what makes people to to to sleep off to the church a devil on your shoulder we didn't know that in Pentecost but this ministry that opened the Book of Revelation showed all that to us he said life upon life follows until the whole of Revelation open why before our wondering eyes and we being edified or built up am we did not start as man when our parents gave back to us we started as babies then we are what we are today that's why we have children amongst us if it was in spiritual birath be bth as men when we are going back home we have no babies because he will call he will change this one those who are dead they will not rise up as babies they are going to rise up in their Prime so now we need to be built up or eded and purified by spirit and made ready that is the cost of being made ready we will be built it will be purified and then be made ready not prepared made ready for the coming of the Lord so as I was saying brother Braham took notes from somebody right brought you to preach how can I overcome number two from there brother Braham also we could also learn from there the sincerity of this man yes why would he come to tell us that I took no to come and preach I didn't study well can I tell the congregation uh this I didn't study well to preach this sermon we will think in our flesh that we are reducing our importance to the church no he told us in the message how can overcome that greatness is Simplicity that's right greatness is Humanity humanity is the first sign say the first sign of Holy Ghost baptism because when you he that we should not message believer should not wear glasses whatever is happening to your eyes you will throw your glasses away why Mage said it we're not ashamed because said it may the Lord Jesus Christ help us amen yes I have 10 minutes to to reach to reach 12:00 I would try what did Adam in the beginning what were the things that were lost and what are the things that we have coming to Adam lost eternal life Adam lost rights of life right right to the Key of Life Adam lost fellowship with God complete fellowship with God coming every day every evening cool of the day if God came to Adam in the cool of the day and instituted as part of the feast ofice last Church evening service why do there's only one reason because time need you needed your time for other things that's is the true reason or you are coping other people from the beginning God measured time day in evening and morning evening and morning is the first day why did Brother Brown kept that on it told them in the Old Testament in the morning you must have morning oblation in the evening you must have evening obl the aroma or the the smoke of the sacrifice must continue to go onto me Jehovah through the day I must I must SP your offering right time is one of the treasures that God gave to us it's one of the talents that God G to us amen if you don't spend your time for God when God wants it you will spend your time for yourself or at once if like I tell in my my church when I was in big church I said the look if you have this problem if if 20 Brethren stand in a row at the pastor's office after service the same question Pastor why don't you have this why don't you have this why don't you have this why don't pastor and his they will think twice happy we preach for 1 hour 1 and a half hours and then we socialize outside for 2 hours in summer can you do that in Winter am I've not been here in winter but my wife has been no you can't why nature does not want you to do it you cannot bear it nature is was cruel at that time talked about winter as the time of death cruelity God showing to the people because of their sin cruelity of of of of of the elements but when God brings a leaf when we canot let us do more for God is that the time that our it ought not to be Adam lost fellowship with God this love that we have with our God is like in honeymoon or a few years after honeymoon the latest room and are they here okay sleeping sitting as as as [Music] to go to Zab for no reason and leave his wife he say no I until I get money we go together the love of honeymoon in a correct family the love of honeymoon is not supposed to seize and where is darling where the apple of his eyes where his wife the wife of theen and it gives us a direct order of when you come to the let me let me let me tell you something that God made me to inspired me to be able to say this to you usually the way God is when I have something important I go back to the Tes I search the message that brother R preached on that day I went to search the message the preach on [Music] 908 only three messages 57 the two of them Hebrews I think 6 he preed one in the morning they had a dinner for brother right you know that's important message a dinner in in between services for their golden wedding anniversary and they came to the house because did not want that to because want to honor the oldest family in our church we didn't want that to dishonor God there are certain things that we do that we dishonor God but we don't think that it is but that is what it is Adam lost his inheritance in life and Adam lost his control his Dominion or his sunship and that is what Christ has come to give back to you and I on the platter of gold and that gold is this golden seven cost menu Seven Seals seven Thunders seven cosmen gold want to and we are maybe not willfully but we don't seem to remember that we are in a boot that's right where God is and he has everything in to amen time is one of the greatest apart from our souls time is one of the greatest assets treasure talent that has given to us and we will account for every moment of [Music] it I said in the order of my church and you have even service why don't you have it don't wor I'm not I said the of my church that you have on school you don't have and all many other things I'm not saying this to un christianize you I'm saying this speaking to my home Church a part of me my very half is a Bonafide member of this church I told you the first time I pre every message I or any other person which is here when we are almost going to bed my wife when we on B you listening to your second Church she was here for became of you and she W me part of you so I I have the Liberty not what very give to me preach whatever is in your mind not only that but I have I have something as take here and that is that my wife every Sunday when you when we when you are ending just ended your service that's when we are on bed this time now they should be 7 hours away into the [Music] night who is me Paul says I preach not the gospel am this things must to look into you have a fil the city calary has a f in Nigeria of people coming to if it's not Ontario it is C because your economy is better than I believe other places people come to this place you should be a Star Church a Star Church where everything that is in the message you can see it yes in every Journey there must be arguments not negative arguments that's right but talking with each other I don't see why we should place this like this what does a message say I don't see why people should wear kind of what does brother that's the part of it is also written it is also written right let's take the example of our sisters they are the Showcase of the church if people look at the Hao of our sisters that if you know Africans there are some Africans zimb Zab I think no no no Zambia there are women have their heads to their heels in Nigeria we have a child theads that have their ears to their laps that's their natural hair if they CAU a pitch of it is wrong amen right amen said I wish Sarah and and Rebecca did not clip their head a littleit because it is your naare right amen whatever you are disposed to wear as attachment or or switch or wi it must not be artificial to your own it is part of the message amen when somebody else come from the church in band you know that place you cannot know because I don't know it either if he comes and looks around he's not judging but because we have Kindred Faith amen when he SE an African with the here here he will say this is from and then you ask her name say I'm J that's that's name are you a nor no I'm southwest he will feel some kind my my knowledge the is on should them it's part of the message artificial outside means artificial insight K Church my story is not ended but 12:00 is staring at me in the face remember that brother brah told us that somebody comes to you and say it is written don't stay there check all around because it's also I don't care what anybody WR but it's also written that also written is what makes us to CL higher amen and press harder if we remain here it is written yes but when we are faced with it also written then where are we going to stand what are you going to do when you have the privilege of having the whole why do you have the half and that to dress yourself for the king do you don't you remember that Esther told ha guy that just what you want you are the friend of the king others have come oh in Nigeria this have Dr he gave them he knew what the king wanted he knew that what the king wanted would be what who choose his bread for him but when this gu this young lady this virgin came who had been graced by God to says you are the friend of the king because God had granted her favor before that man to put her in the best place give her good medings taught her how would do here everything said just what and when the man dressed and got before our sh our was broken down this is that amen because her dressing was according to all that heart am in his mind the picture Jesus Christ is painting a picture today that is what brother told us by the message he's painting a picture of his Brides without spots without wrinkle without blemish or any of s things and he is the owner of the brides he knows what he wants and that is why he gave to us an Eleazar amen yes Amen brother Bram to empty his mind to his mind look at me haveed before you go tell my people everything that I am tell them when they enter into that I will these things are there for us don't ever forget that principle amen don't sit to it don't freeze on it is written When anybody brings anything to you that the prophet but the prophet yes he said this he also said this and he can show it to you from Genesis to Revelation without enemies it must not say contrary in Exodus or Galatians it must say the same thing because this is one book this is God and when it says that it must also say the same thing from 1933 to 1965 and it will be in the spirit of the message amen when we are like that nobody can deceive us nothing can push us here or there remember that principle it is also written that was the brid that was called in Revelation 4 when John had all these things he was called come uper to come and now behold that brid and he saw you there and he saw me there dressed in the white Rems of his own righteousness amen amen our righteousness cannot get there they are F the RS the way I think it should be is not there the way I want to appear is not there amen it is what he wants to do and if you run this through the scriptures you will find out that what is Con confronting you has confronted every believer is something new it has confronted every Believer from the beginning he confronted if if accepted L O Brother BR say if God will not accept him or will condemn it because of one word say how do you think that he will accept you with one word out what is the word is it not the message of the Prophet are there minors and majors in it no no everything must be cured because that's is what we produce the bread anything that is not itat from 33 to 65 from Genesis to Revelation is not its 99.9999999% is not its 101% is not it is 100% am that's why it g to us the parable of the S so allow is softness of life as in laia softness of Life the riches that we have and things like that to choke our services to God you also see it in the message when we see it what we don't want in the message we look away from it we open the pages too quickly because we don't want to we don't want that to work upon us but if you get to anything that you are not doing in your life on your family on your local assembly which is where we operate ritually it is what we get from here that will take out to op breakes this is where we feed that's why brother BR goes to the mountains and thinks to fill up so that it can come to Pour down to us yes what you hear in church what you hear your personal devotion what you hear your family that's how you feel then you go out and dress and walk the way the message says am if you don't feel up we're not going to show him to the world and everything that is said in the word is what will make us to fill up if we neglect anyone we are neglecting our Salvation is it Jonah Jonah says the one in the fish belly Jonah he says anyone that how does he put it forsake his Mercy or forsake something for six his Mery Jonah Jonah is in this Minor Prophets now the light has come so the government says I should start preaching Jonah sorry anyone that forsakes they that of serve lying vanities forsake their Mercy they observe lying vanities things of the world things that are not true are just vanities they are not true they forsake their Mercy this is Mercy given to us amen the message is the mercy of God when we forsake anything in it we are forsaking our mercy and we don't want to forsake our Mercy Church in Cal since government has approved that can go on preaching let me also talk about the pattern of God I have here a long read but will not read it when you get home read what David gave to the people of Israel he called Israel together from the least to the greatest right and his son was there remember that that son had before that time has been placed on the throne not of Throne of David the Bible say he has been placed on the throne of the Lord Solomon was enthroned on the throne of the Lord giving us what will happen in the future it was so important to God to place it like that in the scriptures so that we know what he saying he told him everything about the new Temple before all that time they did not have a temple they had a tabernacle now God was now going to stay in their midst live in their midst that he has told them from Exodus let them make me a sanctuary that I want to dwell in their midst and he gave him the the measurement the type of material the way they will build it everything that not only the temple the other the other houses that he now gave it to he said God showed this to me in the spirit God revealed that to him you call it Blue Print here you call it plan the house of plan of the house in our place he gave him that blueprint from the spirit yes sir it was revealed to him as it was reveal to brother to build him human bodies yes sir and when he gave it to him he told him do it exactly as he has given it to me this is the seven books he gave him the seven books and when Solomon came Solomon said to God God this is what you spoke by your mouth to my father David this is now your hands have produced it I have built it according to what the servant s amen huram and the others they did it exactly what was said amen that was how that was how God came after their dedication and lived in it if something was not in place God would not come right don't we know that we are in the same Exodus am don't we know that he's he gave those ones as types to us amen types and antitypes they don't fail if the type says this is the way it should be the ant the antip cannot say this is the way it should be he gave us what you can see Shadow if these are six fingers are these six fingers no five fingers this one cannot be six fingers if the shadow says five this must be five if he dealt with them like that in the first exus second exus first Tabernacle second Tabernacle the third Tabernacle came he came and Christ said that when you see me you see the father that's right I do nothing but what I see the father done right oh what is the works of God the works of God is to believe him Hallelujah whom he has sent amen that's how to work the works of God that is how to work the works of God there are people that have falling away from the message that's not your portion there are people today that have been in the message and are accusing the prophets abusing him speaking evil about him that is not your portion but do you know that as hard as they are doing it yeah if I decide to step out of one word we are in the same whats amen right right God help us I'm lay this things down because that is what he laid in my heart amen for you and I believe in you as as well as I believe God I believe in you I believe in your hierarchy I believe in you I believe that we have not come here to waste time we have not come here to look at our eles have not come here to look at any other assembly there may be a thousand 20,000 people 200,000 people but don't come to hear about he does not count his people he weighs his people that's what told us he does not count his people he weighs his people and the scale is the scale of the word that's right no matter what we do how Victorious or how we we we we achieve successes in what we do if it's not the perfect word of God it will crumble that's right that's right that behoves of you as a local assembly to look at everything in Theon of the ages I will read this and then since you have read the book yourself am you know that what I'm saying they're there in principle they're there they may not be in Words resume of the ages from our studies we have already learned that much of the Revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not Formerly Known that the church spoken of and chur spoken to in the Book of Revelation does not refer to the pure ecclesial the elect the body of Christ the bride but it speaks to the entire body people who are called Christians so when brother Brown speaks when the Bible speaks he is not speaking to the pure Church alone he's speaking to Pure Church knowing that in that womb there is also a king I'm reading from the seven churches thus we learned that the church is made up of two Vines the true and false everyone that believes in message is not elens right everyone that believes the message from Africa to America to Asia to Australia and to Europe they are not elects amen you remember the brother that came and brought Amen to us you remember that brother I don't I didn't bring anyone but I used my voice to say amen I want to I want you to approve that that is the truth [Music] am we read the first Exodus all the ones that took the message of the Prophet to the Gentile land to The Possession what Adam lost that took it there that brought fruits of the land that saw the problem and the Beauties there they were not all Christians so you cannot say because this people do it like this this do no what does the message say not not all Israel is Israel so not all Christians are Christians thus we learn that the church is made up of two Vines the true and the force the two Vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the Holy Spirit while the other is endued with a spirit of antichrist both claim to know amen and to be known of God you are listening I know you are listening both poort to speak for God both believe certain very basic truths and differ on others but since both bear the name of the Lord being called Christians and by such name bearing obviously claim a relationship to him and God calls that relationship marriage what does God do God now holds both of them responsible amen you are holding me responsible to be lightskinned how can I ever be lightskinned but because I said I'm I'm a ccasian I'm a Caucasian I'm a ccasian you're a ccasian okay we will prove it that's what he's saying right they claim that they are Christians they claim that he knows them but how do you know by their fruit you will know them yes we F learn that these two Vines will grow side by side until the end of the ages when both will come to maturity to be harvested this is our maturation time this is when we should be mellowed ripened mellowed so that the master can plock us what are we showing to the world what's our assembly showing to the [Music] world people look up to you brother brah came to preach in Calgary brother brah knows your stamped grounds right the second pool of the ministry was first exhibited in Regina I have the privilege of going there I went there to take photograph not not as a an idol but to say God you brought me to the place where the second pool amen of a Ministry of your coming down yes I can I see I I see the pr you are here didn't come to our country right the false Vine would not overcome and destroy the True Vine but then neither would the True Vine be able ble to bring the false Vine into saving relationship with Jesus Christ so there's no frustration this is the truth no it's not the truth God bless you but this is the truth know this is the truth that's why elect will not persecute elect third the third principle we learn the most amazing truth that the holy Spirit could and would fall upon the unregenerated false Vine Christians and manifest powerfully in various signs and wonders even as Judas had a Ministry in the Holy Ghost though he himself was pronounced a devil so you don't need to look at anybody Hallelujah you have all read Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said even your husband even your pastor even your wife even anything that will draw you away from the word of God don't allow it that's right if you have a pastor here that is bringing the book word for word to you yes you don't have any anything to tell God yes sir and he was talking his mind the video will come and show once this service and you see it how can I overcome by the word am am by the Holy Ghost baptism amen by sincerity by correction taking correction and by faith that's what you will find catl in that book your time your Treasures your money don't waste fruit it's part of the message Ram told his compatriots the food that you waste here if they get to India or Africa they will F Millions when Jesus Christ had enough food in his ministry what did he do he collected the fragments yes he not to go into uh the trash being right so you know how much to prepare if you have a husband that is L you will know if you have a husband that eats small you will know if your husband eats small and you put lad who do you want to eat it trash you will ask does this my daughter not read what I did when i f f ,000 and F 7,000 we are to be the word of God in flesh people don't need to read the Bible but us when we get to our estate as the wife of the king we are growing into it amen that's why this has come light has come and we have the grace of God I also have here your prayers a church that does don't pray can not be strong I will tell pastor if I have the time what I'm Not A Gifted person but sometimes God helps me what you are contending with you must know your enemy the only thing that will destroy your enemy is your prayer and you stand in the word because you have the spirit of God but you can have the word watch you can have the spirit you can see your enemy and let them go free you don't do anything about it we have talked about adult Sunday school your youth go and check what the message says about caring of Youth amen this generation in this book it told us what they will be if you don't give them the word and guide them according to the word amen they will become Embers right lastly they become hot ashes Lord because what they got in Sunday school the first Sunday school and they had him at least on the school when they are in their rage when the world is fighting against them if we don't bring them into adulthood by the message those one will not last them right brother Brown told us that the young ladies young men on Sunday after service in between service I will talk to the young ladies Young teers I'll talk to them about life sex and things like that right they know more about those things than when I was in their age and you know that they know but parents will pretend they talk of say they don't know but you know that they know if you don't guide them who will guide them said one woman outside will say that he lost them will guide them and by the time you know you have lost your chance amen exactly Amen brother Abraham told us how many have read generation here I recommend that you read that book in that book you will see what the children of the Prophet said about they brother Braham and games I don't want to ask is 123 I must but what he said to us about I've had the voice I needed to hear I've heard the pastor's Voice Hallelujah you say Generations that's the book generation okay yes I I was to ask it on Friday many have read it here in page 44 he said let me start from3 have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games so it is their b games it is not ours right amen [Music] amen they are spotting events it's not ours right they can do it in basic classes as of their school than thank you but when we now get there church now gets them to do it okay let me read the prophets they enter into the spirit of it they it has a spirit that's different from our spirit they don't sit there like wall Flowers Old drys sticks they enter into the field of things in their ball games in their sporting events they must enter I was once once a sportsman I was a Pocky Skipper I know the spirits I have been there amen they become a part of things but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into this Spirit of God's word amen the spirit of God's word is different from the spirit of games right when you begin to Anchor and happen and heighten their emotions on these things they will not be able to separate the two when they get to older age that's right true brother Abraham said that when you give your children comics and things you are preparing their hearts for the the blast that is coming right not even their physical body the way they look at it you are destroying their brain but it's in the message but we do it there are cautions that has been given to us then now says they call us Fanatics and holy rulers because we don't get into that Spirit do you do that there's nothing that they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval because we don't have that in in in in in our in our Arena but the prophet say ignore it amen you can expect it knowing where it is coming from where does it come from from their master who has come into the church if you read Overcomers you see there Satan has come into the church am Satan has come to the message because it must come to the message not the message the pure message but it has come in our M amen that is what you be didn't he go to heaven where God said where are you coming from about job it must come we're not afraid of those things it must come amen amen just go on and get in the spirit of worship when they are doing that you get in the spirit of worship amen our spirit is clean right amen our spirit is fresh yes our spirit is real our spirit is sober and serious nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is what is our strength that is why we we derive our strength we don't derive our strength in soccer right we don't derive our strength our spiritual strength in these games brother said I could have been playing golf I could have been playing any of these games he said does all these big men do that but I don't want it because there I will mix up with women that are new day dressed so that is why I make my game fishing like your pastor fishing and hunting where I will be alone with the [Music] Lord Church in carre I love you amen not because my children are here but because you love me I can feel that you love me I must let you see these things I'm passing this way maybe no time no time no longer then when we meet at his feet and everything is in position then we will embrace amen and said that will make it you see me somewhere in a little place because I come from a little church singing Amazing Grace amen what has brought us all here to come up here to make our homes what our homes should be a correct home remember married one the prophet told us that what cause problem in the house sex as Paul also said morning and my EG right my EG this is the way I want to do it it's not of God am brother say he may be there to trust you to try you he said you are your husband may have different libido different how do you put it now different desires of each other say find a a comfortable medum because that is one of the things that cause problem and then you get to the pastor you won't talk about you talk about all things because you don't want to talk about that but Paul says that it can happen 1 Corinthians 7 amen Satan introduces it like that because he wants to ca disunity we must be wise by what the message has given us to be wise our desire should be more of God more of God more of God to see him more clearly that's right as the message unfolds then we will unfold amen as we study then we will be more everything that you know that is not 100% the message why don't you as individual first because the pastor cannot bring un for on anybody but why don't you as an individual look into the books I said I want to be sincere to myself right brother Braham at the end of the second pool God demanded from him be more sincere he said he didn't say I was not sincere but he said I should be more sincere because he was taking me to a higher height maybe he wants to take this local assembly to a higher height maybe he wants to take individuals to a higher height Maybe wants to take families to higher Heights why don't we consider it why don't we sit down program called business meetings why don't we sit down as families and see these things there have [Music] manymore when we had the first law supper in this church I told Pastor that God Tau me something that I quickly sent home they some people are better than we are doing it because I found that that's what the prophet said we're not doing it I sent it home I love you you love me Hallelujah the word of the Lord is our comfort amen amen I know that it's hard to see that beautiful faces like this are not yet there but that's the best thing that we can do for each other the parable of the face have you ever considered the parable of the face the face can see everything in the body but it can never see itself it can see everything it can't see itself and it can't see it back somebody else must come and tell him I want more of Christ how many will join me I want more of Christ I want more of Christ with my family I want more of Christ with this assembly I want this assembly to be a prime a token assembly a token is what you remove from all others that's why he said he will make us his token amen this is my token my 10th yes shall f as should bow our heads and talk to the Lord ourselves talk to the Lord yourself ministers cannot pray for the church except what to do Amen in interceding it takes the church herself the individual herself talk to God say there's a difference between praying in the Prelude When you pray silently and when you after service when you talk to God don't look at what your your nebor is doing just talk to him as he has talked to you you believe that he has talked to us wait why don't you talk back to him I've taken your time let us finish the way he wants us to finish love
