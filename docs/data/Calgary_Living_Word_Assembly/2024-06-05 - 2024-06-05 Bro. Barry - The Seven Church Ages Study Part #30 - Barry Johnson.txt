Joel for stepping in for Lisa while she's at home with Christopher if you have your Bibles tonight I'd just like to read two scriptures start with Revelations chapter 2 and then I'd like to turn over to St John chapter 15 very familiar scriptures we are in the pergami and church age out of the exposition of the seven Church ages we'll pick up where we left off last week in Revelations chap 2 we'll start with verse 12 and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things saith he which hath a sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and H has not denied my faith even in those days where in antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balam who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickoles which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white Stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it let's turn over to St John chapter 15 verse one St John 15 verse1 I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean I love this now ye are clean thank you Lord through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you period as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me period I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered how many people have we seen along the way my and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will yes and it shall be done unto you and and not just that but herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord Jesus we know that that word is singular as the book but father it's also a plural as you have mentioned here in the scripture and father we just thank you for this word we thank you for your instruction we thank you you for your leadership by your spirit in your word father we thank you for the correction back to the word through the voice of a Vindicated prophet in our age Lord thank you for ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church Lord father we pray that you would just bless our service in a mighty way tonight father once again we commit all things into your hand For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a few announcements before we get into the uh oh my the service tonight I just feel so excited about the service tonight um but first I would just like to say happy birthday brother Danny brother Daniel a million is 70 years old today God bless you my [Applause] brother brother Daniel has certainly been wonderful addition to the assembly to the body of

P.M and we have brother Cadre digs here on June 26th and that is a Wednesday and then we have the youth uh gathering on June the 30th and it will be at our house we will be uh taking that that uh Gathering the Youth Event at our place after service on Sunday June the 30th so God bless you tonight as we get into the word um I just this is probably uh one of my favorite parts of the exposition of the seven Church ages as I was going into it I didn't want to get into it last week because I kind of knew that it was going this way and I don't know we'll go fast or we'll go slow tonight we'll just see what the spirit wants to do and see how the Lord Works um certainly excited about the word I wanted to talk about this from a perspective tonight um you know manifestations versus the the word is kind of really what came to my mind what came to Heart many times we can look to see if we have the spirit of Christ in our life based on the manifestation of the Lord in our life and how we we see signs and wonders and you know uh it can be a real challenge to our faith especially the Believers of the message because William Mary and Bram had tremendous signs and wonders following his ministry but the only reason he had that was because of the office that he held and because of that office that he held he actually did something different than everyone else in the whole entire world and that is he actually put the word first true the word first and everything else secondary and even if it took the hide off of people even if it destroyed denominational beliefs even if it shattered what people people's Traditions were and their families it didn't matter and and not that he didn't care he did care he had concern about that but he put the word first am and that's the only way to have success with Christ he just said those words that was God speaking through Jesus Christ just like it was God speaking through William Mary and brandom in John chapter 15 he is the true vine but you know if you abide in me in my words I love that my words the plural part not just a singular word the book The Sword if my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now I'm just going to come back back to that in a little bit but I just think it's it's a wonderful thing because many times people will say that well we believe the message of the hour so we should have tremendous manifestations in our lives well that's not actually the true indication on whether you really believe the message of the hour or not and that's what brother Bram said it's a very important thing and and it just I believe it ties right back into what we've been talking about on Sundays perfect will versus permissive will and you know it's really easy to understand the two I I just felt so inspired when I started thinking about in this vein because really there's there's a separation between the two one word off is permissive will one word off is permissive will perfect will is all of the word even if I don't understand it even if I don't like it even if it doesn't feel good and you know it it goes even further and I think we were trying to get into that on Sunday I believe the Lord was leading me that way and and I'm just going to keep going in that way because I can see that's the direction the Lord wants to go and and when you feel that leadership you got to go with it and it's simple brothers and sisters the message of the hour is no room for negotiating it it's not interpretive it's simple it's cut and dry it's the word of God and but we want to try and manipulate what the prophet said to suit our lifestyle we're actually in permissive will amen but you know what the prophet said God will even bless you right there he'll still bless you and you'll feel blessed and you'll think I'm in God's perfect will but if it's not his perfect word you're in permissive will amen even though you're still blessed what a mighty God we serve amen but he'll take that permissive will and turn it into his perfect will but he'll allow us to get to a place where we will start looking up and and sometimes that's a real sticky place to get amen but I just want to go back a little bit I'm going to try and and read uh we'll see I just thought it was good to go back a little ways um it's paragraph 31 in in the church age book here that I'm reading on in the paman church age brother Bram he says I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues and I love the way he says this he's not saying I want to tell you that the evidence is he says Jesus Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that she would be in the truth and what's going to be the truth what was in the what was the truth in the days of Noah what was the truth in the days of Jeremiah what was the truth in the days of Ezekiel what was the truth in the days of Amos what was the truth in the days of the Prophet it was the word of God through that prophet he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth and I want to say this not just say an amen go for it Noah build an ark yeah I believe that you're a prophet of God build that Ark and just sit outside when it was time to go in yeah yeah no way those people who believed it they got in that Ark but there wasn't many people that did that could and believe it but he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth that you would be in the word of God for your age how could you be in the word of God for your age outside of the Prophet for the age impossible evidence has to do with receiving that word amen now don't get me wrong I believe there's millions and billions of people that are going to claim Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever they'll say Jesus Christ his blood it's Jesus Christ that died and rose again and and purchased my salvation and they're 100% right about that but they'll say oh William Mariam brandom no he went off on his Doctrine he he got off track somewhere along the way he's not with the mean stream Doctrine and you know what that's up to them not everyone has the ability to believe it but there is a real distinct separation between perfect will and permissive will all the way in the word and one word off off my 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord oh my so good so all we have to do is listen to what Paul said and isn't it wonderful to think that this Prophet that we follow he said I only preach what Paul preached that's it it's not a new doctrine it's what's already been said now see that the proof of the IND dwelling Spirit was to acknowledge and follow understand acknowledge say Amen but then follow it but then act upon it but then move what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order Paul had to say to those who claimed another Revelation verse 36 1 Corinthians 14:36 what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only we know the word of God comes to who comes to the prophet that's the word of God why would he change his program so that Satan could get in Satan would get in God would never change this program but Satan would get in and say well God just kind of changed this program you know there's just a different age now and we've got different things there's different cultures there's different thinking we've got a higher intellect now it's the information superhighway our children have never been so educated we could go on and on and on about all the different things right the condition of of the living in which we we live but we know that he's the same yesterday today and forever and as long as we're willing to align ourselves back with that it doesn't matter how much contamination is in this world and the food that we eat we can bless our food and eat garbage and still get the nutrients out of that food if we need to that's the God we serve we would never go and eat garbage though brothers and sisters and say now I'm going to test God because we know the word of God says that you shouldn't tempt the Lord right it's like drinking poison drinking poison to say whoa I'm going to prove something here but then you get caught in a certain sixe situation I remember brother Ken telling the story about the man I think he was in Russia and he was told you're going to drink this poison he was held captive and told you're going to drink this poison if this is the god you believe then you're going to prove this God and and the guy was like no I don't really want to do that and I might be getting the story a little bit wrong but I know this much there was poison there was a man that was being forced to drink it and he had a dog in the room and the dog was given the same poison and the dog fell down dead and the guy said you know what if you're going to make me do it I'll do it but I'm going to be just like those three Hebrew kids and I'm going to know the God that I serve he will either decide to raise me up and not let it affect me or he'll take me home it's his choice but I know that he lives and I will not renounce him as my God and he took the poison he drank it and he lived that's the God we serve amen but the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the word but to receive the truth word and to believe and Obey it yes amen so brothers and sisters manifestations versus the word don't worry about manifestations all that will come all that has to come because that's the word of God have you noticed in Revelations 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit I don't know if brother Bram says it in here but she is a virgin to the word in every Church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true Christians took the word for their age now again people will say well that's pretty easy to say they'll they'll they'll say that because they're they're going to say that William Mary and Brown's a prophet whatever he said means that he actually was the word he wasn't the word he was the mouthpiece for the word and if you listen to what the words were that came out of his mouth they pointed back to the word they didn't actually put a new word in there there was no interpretation to the word it was an explanation on the word it was right back to the word he says did you get that last thought I repeat every Church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him an individual hear the spirit saith to the churches the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has had its own elect and that elect group all always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them not everyone can hear this word not everyone can say God set a prophet and that he actually happened in our generation but I just keep saying to people who claim to believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if God were to send a prophet to planet Earth would you not want to hear the words he said right if you believe in Jesus Christ my goodness but Satan the most religious one of all he don't want nobody hearing that God sent a prophet cuz if you hear this word that the prophet brought if you have an ear to hear then you're going to get Liberty from Satan you'll get power over Satan you will be an overcomer to this age Satan will become powerless before you and he don't want no part of that he wants to keep everyone right where they're at John 8:47 and he that is of god heareth god God's words remember not word but words yes if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will brothers and sisters ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God they refus the word Jesus they refus the word Jesus and his words for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of God Isaiah 54:13 and all thy children shall be taught of God Holy Spirit my Jesus said the same thing in John 6:45 being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit filled no other criterian doesn't matter how much theology we've got it doesn't matter how far back our lineage goes in the message it doesn't matter how long we've attended a church it doesn't matter how much we do for the church it doesn't matter how much we tithe to the church it doesn't matter any of that there's no other Criterion there's only one and that's being one with the word but the beautiful part is when you're one with the word you will tithe you will have church attendance you will put your shoulder to the wheel you will not try and make excuses for what the spirit said to the church through the prophet for our age you just won't and you know I'll say it this way it's pretty blunt and and strong but if you actually act differently than what the prophet brought then I say you don't believe the prophet right it's one or the other brothers and sisters many people want to say it's many different colors it's Shades of Gray it's no shade of gray it's black or it's white it's right or it's wrong it's God's word or it's not word it is amen Jesus said the same thing in John 645 being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit filled no other Criterion I love how brother bam says it not here but somewhere that you can be Spirit-filled but maybe not the Holy Spirit my right yes but what are tongues and interpretation and other gifts they are manifestation that is what the word teaches read it is read it in 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then Paul names those manifestations now comes this very good question this is where we left off last week this is where it's going to get real good we're going to we're going to this is going to get good buckle up brothers and sisters now comes this very good question I know that you are anxious to ask why isn't the manifestation an Evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost because you surely could not manifest the Holy Ghost unless you were truly Spirit-filled he says now I wish I could say that is right because I don't like to hurt people or walk on their Doctrine but I wouldn't be a true servant of God if I didn't tell you the whole counsel of God that is right is it not amen just let us take a little look at balum he was religious he worshiped God he understood the proper method of sacrificing and approaching unto God but he was not a true seed Prophet for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the people of God into sins of fornication and idolatry yet who would dare deny that the spirit of God manifested through him in one of the most beautiful portions of absolutely accurate prophecy the world has ever seen why but he never had the Holy Ghost now some people would say well brother Barry the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given what was what was the Holy Ghost then what is the Holy Ghost now it's God Amen it's the spirit of the Living God Amen that's right it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not a different person that's where the denominational world gets in that's where Satan gets in that's where the devil is in the details where you try and detail it out and say well it's three distinct persons in the Trinity it's a lie of the devil amen you can't Chop God into three pieces and give him to a a seed Gene of God doesn't work that way but he never had the Holy Ghost now then what do you think of Caiaphas the high priest the Bible says that he prophesied the kind of death the Lord should die and we all know that's true we'd say Amen to that we know it's truth we all know there's no record of him being a Spirit-filled and spirit-led man like dear old Simeon see this is what I think is beautiful because he goes back and he says there's people that have manifestations that didn't have the Holy Spirit but then there's other people that had the spirit yes before the Holy Spirit was given though we all know there's no record of him being spirit filled and spirit-led man like dear old Simeon or that sweet saint called Anna yet he had a genuine manifestation of the Holy Ghost this is where it gets really really tough it can it can get really confusing and it does but it doesn't need to go and listen to anointed ones at the end time and see what brother bradam says about it but we'll get into it Lord willing so good here we can't deny that he says so where is manifestation as an Evidence it isn't there manifestation is not an Evidence brothers and sisters don't look for manifestation in your life and brother Bram he said it earlier on in the church age book a with manifestation as the plum line get back to the word if you are truly filled with the spirit of God you will have the evidence of the manifestation in your life no you'll have the evidence of the word in your life that's the evidence Brothers and Sisters Let's show you how deeply I feel and understand this truth by a revelation God gave me now before I tell it I want to say this many of you people believe me to be a prophet I don't say that I am you said it but we both know that visions that the visions that God gives me never fail not once if anyone can prove a vision ever failed I want to know about it now you now that you follow me this far here is my story and we're all very familiar with this story many years ago when I first came across the Pentecostal people I was in one of their camp meetings where there was much manifestations of tongues interpretation of tongues and prophecy two preachers in particular were engaged in this kind of speaking more than any of the other Brethren has anybody ever been to a service like that this is just brother Barry asking that has anybody ever seen that where people are prophesying they're speaking in tongues and other people are interpreting this is a very real and it happens I I was a kid in in the Pentecostal Assembly and I remember seeing it happen but I would see it in in such a way someone would would would would speak in tongues and a woman in a in a tight leather miniskirt wearing high heels and earrings with cut hair would give an interpretation and my could she ever yell anyways brother bam says two preachers in particular were engaged in this kind of speaking more than any other other Brethren I thoroughly enjoyed this services and was truly interested in the Visions sorry in the various manifestations for they had a ring of reality to them it was my Earnest desire to learn all that I could about these gifts so I decided to talk to the two men about them through the gift of God resident in me I sought to know the spirit in the first man whether he was truly of God or not isn't that interesting that he would really wonder whether he was of God or not after a brief conversation with that sweet humble brother I knew that he was a genuine solid Christian he was real the next young man was not at all like the first one he was boastful and proud and you know that's usually one of the first indicators I would say as well you see it in people and as I spoke to him a vision moved across my eyes and I saw that he was married to a blonde lady but was living with a brunette and had two children by her if ever there was a hypocrite he was one now let me tell you I was shocked how could I not be here were two men one of which was a real brother and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the Spirit right I was troubled by this confusion I left the meeting to seek God for the answer I went alone to a secret place and there with my Bible I prayed and waited on God for the answer I say help us Lord to pray and just wait on you for the answer not knowing just what portion of the scripture to read I casually opened the Bible to some place in Matthew I read for a while then laid the Bible down in a moment a wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the Bible to Hebrews chapter 6 I read it through and was particularly impressed by those strange verses Hebrews 6:4 to9 we went over this recently for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak now remember when we talked about this when we studied this a little while ago we came to the conclusion that brother Bram simply said that there's people that come all the way up to the promised land they'll even taste of the Heavenly gifts they'll Taste of the figs just like the children of Israel when the spies went across they brought the figs the pomegranates the honey the milk grapes clusters that took two men to carry they had all of the fruits and they tasted of them but they simply refused to say that we can take it because God said so because God's word said so God's word through the Vindicated Prophet said so they refused to go on and actually partake of that Heavenly gift so what brother bradam brought out was what this verse is saying is there's people that will go all the way up to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost but they'll never ever get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll live under an anointing of the Holy Ghost but they'll never go all the way into the promised land I'll just go on to read instead of preaching sorry H I closed the Bible laid it down and meditated a while and prayed some more still had no answer I again opened the Bible aimlessly but did not read suddenly the wind blew in the room again and once more the pages turned to Hebrews 6 and remained there as the wind ceased I read those words over again and when I did did then came the spirit of God into the room and I beheld a vision I saw in the vision a man dressed in the purest white who went forth into a freshly plowed field and sewed grain it was a bright day and the sewing was done in the morning but late at night after the sewer in White had gone a man in Black came and stealthily sowed some more seed amongst that which the man in White had sown yeah these days went by the Sun and Rain blessed the ground and one day there appeared the grain how fine it was remember you can never have an impersonation until you have the original there's never a counterfeit before the truth but a day later appeared the tears the wheat and the tears grew together they partook of the same nourishment out of the same soil they drank in the same sun and Rain then one day the skies turned to brass and the plants all began to droop and die I heard the wheat lift up their heads and cry to God for rain the tears also lifted up their voices and pleaded for rain then the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the Lord Lord now we have brother bradam the prophet saying and to my wonderment I heard the revived tears also look up and say hallelujah then I knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable of the sewer and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience it all became wonderfully clear the swer in white was the Lord the sewer in Black was the devil the word was the field the seeds were the people elect and reprobates both partook of the same nourishment sun and water water and Sun both prayed both received help from God for he maketh his son and Reign to fall on both good and evil just made me think when I was going through this Cain and Abel exact same thing they're both raised in a church both of the parents were Believers backslid Believers but both of them took them to church but one of them was not a reprobate one of them was elected and the other one was reprobate brother Bram he goes on to say and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference they were of different seed here also was the answer to Matthew 7: 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done many wonderful works I'm emphasizing the name because we know that he esteems his word above his name we know that that's the word and Jesus will say unto them and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity and I just have that I never knew you highlighted and I just wanted to mention that brothers and sisters it's not as though he actually had an introduction this is Brother Benjamin Johnson and and and I'm God the father and and we've had an introduction it's not that at all it's about an intimate relationship right it's about intimacy it's about the twain becoming one I never even knew you coming all the way up to meeting of the bridegroom and saying no no no no no I don't want to go that far I like where I'm at I want to stay where I'm at I don't want to lose control I don't want to be a Holy Roller I don't want people to look at me on and on and on all the excuses come out I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity ye that do the things you know you shouldn't do and don't do the things that you should I say Lord help me amen Jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by the way of men right but he did deny ever knowing them my he says it these weren't backsliders these were Wicked unregenerate reprobates these were the seed of Satan right you see where I get Cain and Abel in this in this discussion in this equation Cain was of his father the devil he was of the wicked one Abel was a Son of God brother Bram goes on to say and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born spirit filled right no sir I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled right I believe this is real important and I'm just going to maybe slow down here and just hover a little bit brothers and sisters because there's a real push on right now in and around the message of the hour to get back to Pentecost we've got to see the signs and wonders no we don't we've got to see the word Amen brother bradam says it I think it's coming right up here he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word are we amen Amen in this scripture here jesuses does not deny that they did the mighty works yeah you cast out Devils yep you surely did and and and done many wonderful Works my but it's not the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live how are we going to receive the word of Truth in the day in which we live God has to send a prophet Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow that's the Bible amen I remember when I first started coming to church I I I I thought why why does brother Ken always preach such a mysterious message it's always so strong it's strong meat I I need something a little easier on on my soul something that I could comprehend maybe and understand but it wasn't until a little while down the road feeding on solid food that I began to understand that that true seed can only feed seed on True Word it has to be strong meat that's going to allow the seed to grow we could just feed pum and formula but there comes a point in time where we've got to be weaned brothers and sisters and we've got to be able to actually go into strong meat we've got to be willing to actually go into strong meat and I'm not talking about strong meat saying that I understand that there's Seven Seals and all Seven Seals are opened and all the Mysteries and all of the all of the message Doctrine I'm not saying that that is the evidence either because that's not understanding is not receiving is receiving the word of God is now I'm not saying that the message of the hour isn't but what I am saying is it's not a study it's not Theology and it can very easily turn into that and become head knowledge and we can know every quote we can know all the history we can know all about it it but do we have the word in our heart H have we hid Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee it's not because I'm going to trip and fall it's that I'm actually going to believe I'm not going to have an ounce of unbelief in me because what is sin it's unbelief it's not falling down tomorrow when we go about our job and we do that thing that thing happens and and we feel like we've fallen down and we've sinned again and we've done this thing whatever that is brothers and sisters we're going to contend with this flesh until we have a body change we're going to have thoughts of temptation but those thoughts aren't ours we were talking about that yesterday those thoughts are not ours they're the devil's thoughts and we need to recognize that when those thoughts come our way and give them back to the devil say these thoughts are yours and you're going to burn because of them but they're not my thoughts and they're not God's thoughts so we just just rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ begone for me and that's where Satan is going to have no power when we begin to recognize him anything contrary to the word is the devil even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is the same as it was way back in the day of Our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the the word The Works would follow that's the Bible now Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergami and age which was at yet as yet 200 years off from the patmas vision not very far 200 years really when you look back it is a ways but he knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word brothers and sisters this is where it gets really Pinchy really Pinchy because what is the message of the hour it really is the word of God to this age if you leave the word you have left God that's right you take one word out you've left God that's right you say that I can take most of the message of the hour but I just can't take that part you've left God amen thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages I am the word oh it's so beautiful isn't it if you want deity in your midst then what then welcome and receive the word and this is where it gets so critical brothers and sisters many times we can have someone on our feet and oh my I'm not going back to church now or I'm not here and preach what I want to hear preached or or or or or or or or or the prophet said God said through the prophet to this church age don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and the word understand it's God's work he's either in complete control or he's not true and you know what I want to say this brothers and sisters loud and clear I I think that we've seen if you want more from the pulpit just do what you did last Sunday amen just pray for brother Barry just do that and see if God won't actually give you a blessing see if he won't actually get me to actually step out of the way and he will just preach whatever it is you have need of because he will he will use a donkey to speak his word if he has to don't think that you oh my this or that or the other thing just just keep the word in your heart amen don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word the devil just wants to get us so upset and say well I just can't I can't worship today because I don't like the speed of that song and they've got that stupid drum here and it's just contrary to the way I believe it as soon as we start doing that you're letting something get between you and the word because he said hey if you won't worship me then immediately the C rocks will cry out you know what don't let any anything or anyone get between you and that word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that now some might say well that was brother bradam blasphemia saying I am the word who is speaking here who is speaking here and this is the very next one I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst you know what when we let little things get in our way when we let little things get in US all upset and in a fit and and and this and that and the other thing brothers and sisters I think that the word isn't fully impressed on us we're not sufficiently impressed with that word because if we were we would just look past all of that and we would just be like that kid riding the Schwin bicycle I'm looking at the end I'm not looking at all this distraction right here you know I've heard people say did you see the children in the front row and how they were acting out and I say no I don't because I'm not looking right here I'm looking out here amen it doesn't affect me but I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I love that some might say well where's our midst I want to say wherever two or three are gathered in his name that's our midst brothers and sisters and and I've said it before and I just as as we get closer and closer I just can't help but think it's just more and more and more uh real to me that if you want to see the Rapture just look around this is it brothers and sisters there isn't going to be a great fantastic there's not going to be a bunch of different people it's going to be us and we're going to just continue to March forward in this word and say blessed be the name of the Lord I'm just going to keep that word in front of me and I'm going to make it to that end and one day brothers and sisters we're going to gather together and we're going to spend some time praising the Lord that we've made it and he's going to give us that space of time where we can go and greet every single human being that we've ever met or heard about and get it out of our system and then we'll go on to the marriage supper of the lb but first we're going to meet everyone in the clouds my goodness it's coming just I I pray that we would be sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst right here in in this church in Calgary Living Word he says let me give you a thought here how do we pray pray in jesus' name name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first John 5 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we have desired of him here we go you buckled in now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God Lamentations 3:37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it and brothers and sisters I think it goes even further than that if it's not in the word what do we do we want it we don't want it but this world is set up for us to want it that's why we've got to know the word because the word is his perfect will there it is if it is it in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name but brothers and sisters oh my when you ask according to the word in his name ask what you will there it is again Jesus the name is is the word will you can't separate God and the word they are one now then this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was life John 663b but that is exactly what he is I am the way the truth and the life John 14:6 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his Romans 89b there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity [Music] speaking amen that's why Satan hates this that's why Satan doesn't want people to actually go and get baptized re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins they want to say well I just want to follow Jesus and be baptized in the name of the father and the name of the son and the name of the Holy Ghost well if you believe in Jesus Jesus is is the word and if none of his disciples baptized in the name of the father and of the son of the Holy Ghost and they only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why would you not want to follow what the disciples did but when you do I just love this when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith by believing this word yes takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking I think we've talked about it in the past you know what we need to do brothers and sisters and and I say Lord help me when I talk like this I've experienced it full well we don't need to pray that God would actually change the circumstances to change his word to change his will to suit me we need to pray that our minds would change to match his word to match his will to be able to endure the circumstances he's allowed us to get into the circumstances that we're in for a purpose so that we'll come to the recognition that he is God and he's our healer and he's our provider and he's our shelter on and on we go every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man do you want to be that man tonight I want to say brothers and sisters you are now the sisters aren't but do you want to be that person tonight right put his word above everything in your life and when you do that when you're born of his Spirit brothers and sisters you're going to speak words you don't even know that you're speaking and Satan will not be able to stand it so what will he do he'll flee he won't even know what to do with you he won't want nothing to do with you if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst [Music] again and you know I just oh my I set myself up to preach tonight and I don't I don't want to do that I just got so excited getting into this hallelujah oh my I just think it's beautiful because the word always points to the word doesn't it right just I was thinking about this I'm not going to preach it I just want to say it just like we're reading tonight you know in John 15:7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you how how I want to say this how will his words abide in you because we know that his Bible the word word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword it's one thing but what I want to point out tonight I believe this is what the Lord was showing me and I really want to preach on this I just I I it gets me excited to think about because he says and my words if you abide in me and my words abide in you how will you have his words brothers and sisters how could you possibly have his words maybe you've read the Bible but you know I just want to encourage you to remember Philippians chapter 2 let this mind be in you it's not even you it's not even me it's not us brothers and sisters it's the spirit of Christ let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus how could we do that many people now will say well now there you go and make yourself God no I don't make myself God God makes me God people say oh no that's heresy how could you ever say that whose spirit is it that we want to have living in us hallelujah but this world is taught that you can just be fluid you can have this and that and the other and we could go down a long road with that but I don't want to do that I want to esteem the word greater than any discussion tonight and you know brothers and sisters let that mind be in you and then when you start to ask you don't have to worry about what you're going to ask you're not going to ask and Miss because you're not going to be asking upon the lust of your flesh the lust of your eyes or the pride of life you're not going to be asking on any of that you're going to be asking according to the word of God then you're obligating God to honor your prayer because he says here in the scripture herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit right so shall ye be my disciples he wants us to bear fruit brothers and sisters oh man there's only that much time left and we're just getting started here pick up your pen and WR I mean who knows this everyone here knows this right yeah one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasped the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride amen I got into this brothers and sisters and this really was the inspiration for me it it really clicked for me and this is what gave me the ability to preach it h about how Mary in the story of Gabriel coming to her and brother bradam talks about it in here but this was the inspiration for it brother bradam wasn't telling a Christmas story and I want to say this God was not telling a Christmas story when Gabriel went to Mary and and the whole world hasn't spun into a Christmas story but what he was doing was showing that there is going to be a virgin bride there is going to be one that will take the word of a message an angel messenger into her heart and say I don't understand it I can't explain it but I say Amen to that word and when she says Amen to that word and takes the whole word into her heart then there's a life that comes over her the power of the highest overshadows her and that seed comes to life but what does it bring to life it doesn't bring brother Barry and Jesus does it it doesn't bring a mixed life it's not hybridized it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's that mind that was in Christ now in you brothers and sisters then we can just ask what we will because we won't ask a this it'll always be according to scripture by here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1111 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so isn't it interesting just to pause there the the the the the seeds the fruit they didn't have to try and produce anything it was already there it was in itself and every single one would bring forth after itself there was no trying to make it different whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today if ye abide in me remember he said it in John 15 I am the True Vine and my father's a husband you know I got to say I really kind of wish that I was preaching on Sunday because I'm getting like a a dump truck full of good my that very same life applies to that very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super church amen a super race as she nears him amen they and the bride yes will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image and you know brothers and sisters I just I think we could probably close there I probably should because I'll want to go like in second or third overtime here if we keep going but there's nothing wrong with jumping up and screaming yeah he got a goal amen amen but you know I I will call the musicians because we are at the end here but in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone there's so much right here just in this one paragraph to unpack brothers and sisters and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him he even goes into this later on we'll talk about it you could read it I would highly recommend reading it and just meditating on it a little bit you know they he talks about Joshua and how when they went over into the Promised landine it's at the end of this this this uh this uh encouragement that God gave to brother Bram but you know they said to Joshua brother Bram says maybe God has just stopped dealing with you maybe you've just lost your Edge maybe maybe maybe maybe no no no Joshua knew exactly where he stood he knew exactly who he was he was of another Spirit just like his buddy Caleb but it was the 10 others that were busy trying to make some other manifestations happen you know it's not about putting on anything and it's not about trying to act a certain way trying to look a certain way you know what a dove is just a dove a dove is just white because a dove is made to be white the the feathers on it they have an oil in them a and dirt just can't stick to them sheep Just Produce wool they can't just decide they want to produce wool and they can't just decide they don't want to produce wo they just do they just are exactly the way they are and you know what the true church Christ true seed as she nears The Headstone she will be exactly the way God created her to be she's not going to try and have have to act one way or try and act the other way or try and sound or or whatever it is anyway she will just be exactly who she is they in the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image and you know don't don't mistake that brothers and sisters I feel like I could just start now don't mistake that very image for an image like we talked about that was erected on the plains of Dora for for for everyone to get in in in in line and worship don't think about an image that we can raise of our own minds the only image brothers and sisters is the word of God that's the image that he's talking about out here being able to say that I believe all of that word all of it period without explanation without disputing without controversy every single bit of that word I believe I just believe it I don't understand it but I don't have to understand it the only thing I have to do is believe itj they in the bride stand with me as we close will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one yes they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God not the acts of the Living God the word of the Living God and denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creeds their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelize brings forth a hybrid prod and you know brothers and sisters I'm going to stop here sometimes we can take the things that are from our past if we come from a different denomination if we come from a different country if we come from a different place a different Pastor whoever it is we can start to bring our old things and try and bring it into the message of the hour and you know what he ain't going to hybridize with nothing amen straight up it's only going to be the word of God period full stop God bless you tonight let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you for your direction to this age Lord thank you that we have ears to hear what your spirit said to the church through the Vindicated Angel messenger Lord father we just want to commit all things into your hands For Your Glory we pray for the service on Sunday Lord that you would just bless brother Mariel Lord Jesus that you would give him a fresh call off the altar amen and father we just ask that you would go with each one as we go our separate ways that Lord we would esteem this word greater than
