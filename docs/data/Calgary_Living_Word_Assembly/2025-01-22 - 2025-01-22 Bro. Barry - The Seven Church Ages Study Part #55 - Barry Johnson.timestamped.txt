[43:19] is there anything too hard for God what
[43:21] a tremendous answer if you have a
[43:23] question like that
[43:25] tonight I had a I'm not sure I should
[43:28] share the testimony I'll share this the
[43:29] Reader's Digest version but I had a a
[43:32] very disgruntled client that just went
[43:35] really sideways and she threatened to do
[43:38] some serious stuff talk to a lawyer and
[43:41] he said yes that's defamation that's
[43:43] that's lawsuit material so I just left
[43:46] this I said no we're going to let let
[43:48] that that stay and I just went to
[43:51] prayer I said Lord you know what you're
[43:53] doing to you're you're allowing this for
[43:55] a reason you're allowing me to grow and
[43:57] I just started praying for her I said
[44:00] Lord would you change that lady's heart
[44:02] she doesn't know you she's just acting
[44:04] out something that's there's something
[44:07] in her heart that's just not right
[44:08] recently divorced really disgruntled
[44:11] with life just
[44:13] discouraged so I had my uh she threaten
[44:15] to do all kinds of things like like get
[44:17] into my website and destroy me so had
[44:22] my my marketing people take a look last
[44:25] night or a couple days ago and they send
[44:27] a reply back nothing is in place nothing
[44:30] has been done and I've just continued to
[44:34] pray for this lady
[44:35] so is there anything too hard for God
[44:39] simple little thing like that for me
[44:40] it's pretty big things it's defamation
[44:43] and who knows I mean this is not my
[44:44] world anyway defame me do whatever you
[44:47] want to me I've got a Heavenly home
[44:49] that's where I'm headed but in the in

[44:55] treated her with dignity with Class CC
[44:58] blind copi of the emails I sent to my
[45:00] lawyer wow this is just this is this is
[45:04] dealt with dignity I never riled back at
[45:06] her just took it so just a little
[45:09] testimony that God just answered that
[45:11] prayer for me I don't know where she's
[45:13] going to go doesn't matter but I prayed
[45:16] for her from my heart and forgave her
[45:18] and I said Lord don't hold this to her
[45:19] charge she just doesn't know you if she
[45:21] know knew you she wouldn't she wouldn't

[57:28] all be corrected when we listen to the
[57:30] messages you know I will all say this
[57:32] there's a problem if we listen to a
[57:34] message and we can't be corrected if God
[57:36] brings correction through the word of a
[57:38] Vindicated prophet and we say no I'm
[57:40] good I can't go any further there's a
[57:42] problem brother Bram said we need to get

[58:39] for those who don't know brother Ed
[58:41] hammermeister was a pretty regular
[58:43] minister in the congregation here in

[58:47] even after brother Ken was here uh when
[58:50] the Lord took him home brother Ed
[58:52] stepped in and came to minister for us
[58:54] when we needed Ministry we needed
[58:56] someone to step in uh so he's been a
[58:59] good friend a real encouragement and a

[1:00:00] boy it got cold while we were away and I
[1:00:02] just thank the Lord I was driving the
[1:00:04] older vehicle and uh he gave me
[1:00:06] traveling mercies we didn't get stuck on
[1:00:08] the road we had some funny sounds but uh
[1:00:11] the Lord was good and Monday we had uh
[1:00:14] an arrival in Calgary the uh beima
[1:00:17] family brother Emanuel and sister
[1:00:20] Michelle and their daughter Karen
[1:00:22] arrived in Calgary from Cameroon so I
[1:00:25] went and picked them up and delivered
[1:00:27] them to their new residence they have a
[1:00:29] temporary residence so they can get
[1:00:30] their feet under them while they
[1:00:32] integrate into Calgary and Canada so uh
[1:00:35] we certainly are excited to see them I
[1:00:38] believe they're extremely jetlagged
[1:00:40] right now and they're just taking their
[1:00:41] time to rest we thank you to brother
[1:00:44] Peter and Sister Janet for giving them a
[1:00:46] wonderful meal and just welcoming them
[1:00:49] into Canada it's uh not an easy thing I
[1:00:51] can only imagine I've never done it but
[1:00:54] I can only imagine it is a tremendous
[1:00:56] feet he said that they had traveled over
[1:00:58] 36 hours in the air uh they had four
[1:01:02] stopovers with the baby and uh so it was
[1:01:06] a it was a big three days for them and
[1:01:09] travel but they made it and they got all
[1:01:12] their luggage too which is a tremendous
[1:01:14] thing so Sunday don't be bashful and uh
[1:01:18] look for brother Emanuel and sister
[1:01:20] Karen and uh sorry sister Michelle and
[1:01:23] their daughter sister Karen and greet
[1:01:26] them I bring you greetings also from
[1:01:28] brother Dwayne uh fair from Saskatoon
[1:01:31] Tabernacle he and uh and sister Connie
[1:01:34] were here and so I got to spend a little
[1:01:36] bit of time with brother Dwayne
[1:01:38] yesterday and uh I also wanted to bring
[1:01:41] greetings from Brother Eugene Brun
[1:01:43] Edmonton Living Word another uh another
[1:01:47] soldier that really put his shoulder to
[1:01:48] the wheel uh with Calgary Living Word
[1:01:51] when it was actually being established
[1:01:52] here so certainly glad to be back back
[1:01:56] and uh thankful for the the Lord's
[1:01:58] tender hand of Mercy I uh I'm really
[1:02:02] thankful one of the things you know just
[1:02:04] a little testimony from from me in my
[1:02:07] life I know I've talked about it in the
[1:02:08] past and my right knee has really given
[1:02:11] me trouble and I the first day we went
[1:02:14] out we did some pretty serious hiking
[1:02:16] and brother Logan he actually he hikes
[1:02:18] for a living that's his job he works for
[1:02:21] a company that's a contractor to the
[1:02:23] mine and they look for active bear dens
[1:02:27] that's his job is to look for Bear dens
[1:02:29] and uh different type of woodpeckers and
[1:02:32] uh so anyways while we were dredging
[1:02:34] through the woods brother Logan was
[1:02:36] Blazing the trail and I was struggling
[1:02:38] with my little legs to try and keep up
[1:02:40] with them and near the end of our
[1:02:41] journey on the first day my my knee was
[1:02:43] starting to burn it was really starting
[1:02:46] to hurt me and I just thought you know
[1:02:48] I've been healed it's a lying vanity
[1:02:51] Beat It Satan we're here for some good
[1:02:53] fellowship and I had about 5 minutes of
[1:02:56] pain and then after that it left it was
[1:02:59] completely gone and you know it was
[1:03:02] after that the next day that both Logan
[1:03:04] and I both shot elk and carried them and
[1:03:07] if you've ever experienced it it's
[1:03:09] almost as big as a horse so there's a
[1:03:12] lot of weight to carry and I never had
[1:03:14] an issue then the next day brother
[1:03:16] Eugene got one and again we packed the
[1:03:19] meat we did all the work and we never
[1:03:20] had a problem so I am certainly thankful
[1:03:23] for the hand of the Lord in my life
[1:03:26] so uh yeah where this is going is
[1:03:28] there's going to be some more hunting
[1:03:30] around here I'm certainly excited about
[1:03:32] that so now that we've got all that out
[1:03:35] of the way let's get back into the word
[1:03:37] you know um I just get excited every
[1:03:40] time we get into this word it's such a
[1:03:43] an amazing thing excuse me I'm just
[1:03:46] going to go back a little bit and pick
[1:03:48] up from where we left off uh out of the
[1:03:51] leoan church age we'll pick up with the
[1:03:53] paragraph 43 in the red book here it
[1:03:55] says there are those who say that God's
[1:03:58] people are going to come together
[1:04:00] through a collective Revelation he says
[1:04:03] I challenge that
[1:04:05] statement it is a bald invalid
[1:04:08] assumption in the face of Revelations 10
[1:04:11] verse 7 now I do not deny that people
[1:04:15] will prophesy in this last age and their
[1:04:19] Ministries can and will be
[1:04:22] correct I do not deny that there will be
[1:04:26] prophets even as in the days of Paul
[1:04:31] when there was one agabus a prophet who
[1:04:35] prophesied of a famine I agree that is
[1:04:40] so he says but I deny upon the
[1:04:42] infallible evidence of the word that
[1:04:46] there is more than one major prophet
[1:04:49] messenger who will reveal the Mysteries
[1:04:53] as contained in the word and who has the
[1:04:56] ministry to turn the hearts of the
[1:04:58] children to the
[1:05:01] fathers thus saith the Lord by his
[1:05:03] unfailing words
[1:05:05] stands and shall stand and be Vindicated
[1:05:10] is it Vindicated tonight brothers and
[1:05:12] sisters if you have experienced that
[1:05:15] thus saith the Lord there ain't nothing
[1:05:16] that can change it you know uh I I just
[1:05:20] got into something this morning and I I
[1:05:22] just it's like brother random talks
[1:05:24] about you get in talks about the story
[1:05:25] of the bear that came and RAM racked his
[1:05:28] his tent and and got into the bucket of
[1:05:30] molasses in one story and a bucket of
[1:05:32] honey in another story who cares what it
[1:05:34] is the bear got into it and the fact of
[1:05:37] the matter is the prophet said that what
[1:05:39] it was was so sweet the other bear
[1:05:41] started to lick it off of the one bear
[1:05:44] that got into it that's what it is
[1:05:47] that's what it's so wonderful I got into
[1:05:49] reading a quote today and it just
[1:05:50] inspired me so much at about 4:30 this
[1:05:53] morning that you know there is a vind
[1:05:55] ation of this prophet's Ministry and
[1:05:58] sometimes PE I'm sorry I haven't been
[1:06:00] here for a little while some people are
[1:06:03] looking for the Vindication to be in the
[1:06:04] first or second pole maybe even the
[1:06:06] third poll I want to say tonight
[1:06:07] brothers and sisters the Vindication of
[1:06:09] his ministry is that people say amen to
[1:06:11] that thus sayeth the Lord people receive
[1:06:14] the word of the Prophet they receive a
[1:06:16] prophet in the name of the Prophet which
[1:06:18] gives them the prophet's reward which is
[1:06:21] the reward for the age to sit with him
[1:06:25] in his throne and you know when people
[1:06:27] receive this prophet's word in the name
[1:06:31] of the Prophet the way that he's given
[1:06:33] it that's the Vindication of his
[1:06:35] ministry it's not some great sign or
[1:06:37] wonder and I think sometimes it's a
[1:06:40] perception that there is some sort of
[1:06:42] sign or wonder that tethers to this
[1:06:45] prophet's Ministry you're the sign and
[1:06:47] wonder brothers and sister the fact that
[1:06:49] you can believe the truth in a world
[1:06:52] full of
[1:06:53] error my
[1:06:57] I told you I got
[1:06:58] inspired my I've been waiting all day to
[1:07:01] get that
[1:07:04] out oh my there is one Prophet Messenger
[1:07:07] to this age on the basis of human
[1:07:09] behavior alone anyone knows that where
[1:07:12] there are many people there is even
[1:07:15] divided opinion on lesser points of a
[1:07:18] major Doctrine which they all hold
[1:07:21] together remember brother Bram talks
[1:07:23] about the dip thong earlier in the
[1:07:26] church age book you can look it up dip
[1:07:28] thong it's in there who who then will
[1:07:31] have the power of
[1:07:33] infallibility which is to be restored in
[1:07:36] this last age for this last age is going
[1:07:39] to go back to manifesting the pure word
[1:07:42] bride that means we will have the word
[1:07:45] once again as it was perfectly given and
[1:07:49] perfectly understood in the days of
[1:07:53] Paul I will tell you who will have it oh
[1:07:56] my this just gets me up on the edge of
[1:07:58] my seat here it will be a prophet as
[1:08:01] thoroughly Vindicated or even more
[1:08:04] thoroughly Vindicated than was any
[1:08:07] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:08:11] this
[1:08:12] day it's amazing when you look at this
[1:08:14] because people would read this and they
[1:08:16] would say well he penned this book so
[1:08:18] he's just putting himself out there and
[1:08:19] making himself God he's just making
[1:08:21] himself this this tremendous guy
[1:08:23] remember he doesn't name himself all he
[1:08:25] does says this man this man this man the
[1:08:28] person that God chooses will actually
[1:08:30] fulfill it this way and we'll get into
[1:08:32] it a little further all he does is
[1:08:33] points back to the
[1:08:35] word because this man will of necessity
[1:08:39] have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and
[1:08:42] God will show him forth he doesn't put
[1:08:45] it Forward God puts him
[1:08:47] forward who would stand there on the
[1:08:50] stage in Oregon when a a a
[1:08:52] demon-possessed crazed maniac would come
[1:08:56] and and push his way to the front of the
[1:08:58] church and get right up in his face
[1:09:00] right in his grill and say I'm going to
[1:09:03] kill you
[1:09:04] tonight and what happened with all the
[1:09:07] ministry all those God-fearing ministers
[1:09:10] that would probably lay their hands on
[1:09:12] someone and scream and shout and jump up
[1:09:14] and down and have the signs and wonders
[1:09:16] in their Ministry what happened to all
[1:09:17] the ministry that was on the stage they
[1:09:21] ran one man stood alone and said tonight
[1:09:24] you'll fall over my feet who was
[1:09:26] speaking those
[1:09:29] words that was
[1:09:31] God in the
[1:09:34] man God will show him forth he won't
[1:09:39] need to speak for himself he'll just be
[1:09:42] one standing there when he came right
[1:09:46] God will speak for him by the voice of
[1:09:50] the sign
[1:09:52] amen my the second thought that must be
[1:09:55] impressed on our hearts is that the
[1:09:57] seven Church ages started out with the
[1:10:01] Antichrist Spirit as well as the Holy
[1:10:04] Spirit who is to be blessed forever 1
[1:10:07] John 4:1 beloved believe not every
[1:10:11] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[1:10:15] are of God because many false prophets
[1:10:17] are gone out into the world many people
[1:10:20] will claim the truth but who's living
[1:10:23] it did you notice it the Antichrist
[1:10:26] spirit is identified with false prophets
[1:10:30] this age came in with false prophets and
[1:10:33] they will go out with false prophets now
[1:10:36] of course there's going to be a real
[1:10:38] false prophet in the grand sense of that
[1:10:41] man mentioned in the
[1:10:44] Revelation but as of now before his
[1:10:46] Revelation there are to appear many
[1:10:50] false
[1:10:52] prophets you know I would just go so far
[1:10:54] as to say this brother bradam said it in
[1:10:56] the message he said the word Prophet
[1:10:58] means
[1:11:01] Minister and you know this is where it
[1:11:04] gets down to the nitty-gritty because it
[1:11:06] will be so close it would deceive the
[1:11:07] very elected it's not going to be out in
[1:11:08] the Catholic Church we're talking about
[1:11:10] this earlier today too it's not going to
[1:11:11] be out in the in the denominational
[1:11:13] world we need to forget about that it's
[1:11:14] going to be sitting right next to us in
[1:11:15] a message Church Brothers and Sisters
[1:11:18] but it's not about looking at one
[1:11:19] another it's about looking at him get
[1:11:21] the token in your life and we're not
[1:11:23] going to be looking at one another what
[1:11:24] we'll do is pray for one another and
[1:11:26] trust that the Lord will sort us
[1:11:29] out in Matthew 24:
[1:11:32] 23-26 then if any man shall say unto you
[1:11:36] Lo here is Christ or there believe it
[1:11:40] not for there shall arise false christs
[1:11:44] and false prophets and shall show great
[1:11:48] signs and
[1:11:49] wonders don't look at signs and wonders
[1:11:52] in so much that if it were possible they
[1:11:55] should shall deceive the very elect I
[1:11:57] just think it's so beautiful how he
[1:11:58] would put this in there not to actually
[1:12:00] throw off on people not to actually make
[1:12:03] people feel bad but to give the very
[1:12:05] elected something to look at there's a
[1:12:07] there's an indicator here signs and
[1:12:11] wonders that's not the measuring stick
[1:12:15] the measuring stick is the
[1:12:17] word he says behold I have told you
[1:12:20] before wherefore if they shall say unto
[1:12:23] you behold he's in the desert go not
[1:12:24] forth behold he's in the secret Chambers
[1:12:27] believe it not because where is he where
[1:12:30] is he brothers and sisters he's in the
[1:12:32] heart he's in that teeny little spot in
[1:12:35] the human heart that no other animal in
[1:12:37] creation has that he made for himself
[1:12:40] that's where he is these false prophets
[1:12:43] are earmarked for us in various other
[1:12:47] scriptures such as the following second
[1:12:50] Peter 2 veres 1-2 but there were false
[1:12:53] prophets also among the people even as
[1:12:56] there shall be false teachers among you
[1:12:58] who privily shall bring IND damnable
[1:13:01] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:13:04] brought that bought them and bring upon
[1:13:07] themselves Swift
[1:13:08] destruction and many shall follow their
[1:13:11] pernicious Ways by reason of whom the
[1:13:15] way of truth shall be evil spoken of you
[1:13:19] know brothers and sisters I just had
[1:13:21] this come to me I'm just going to say it
[1:13:23] it's the way it needs to be I guess
[1:13:25] don't think that Swift destruction is
[1:13:27] going to be a lightning bolt zap boom
[1:13:30] you're
[1:13:30] done on the contrary I I would recommend
[1:13:34] taking a look and thinking destruction
[1:13:36] Swift destruction could be winning the
[1:13:38] lottery Swift destruction could be
[1:13:41] actually becoming a star at whatever it
[1:13:43] is you do Swift destruction could be so
[1:13:46] much money that you just don't even need
[1:13:48] to actually think and work with your
[1:13:50] mind anymore you become corrupted Swift
[1:13:54] destruction
[1:13:55] can put you in a place like many of the
[1:13:57] stars in this world many times in my
[1:14:00] life I'm only preaching from my life my
[1:14:02] experience many times in my life you you
[1:14:04] heard my testimony I longed for a big
[1:14:07] fat bank account for some way to
[1:14:09] actually generate lots of money to be
[1:14:11] flush with cash so that I didn't have to
[1:14:13] struggle like I did in my life because I
[1:14:15] chose it but you know what it caused me
[1:14:19] to actually survive it caused me to
[1:14:21] actually learn to make it work it taught
[1:14:23] me that if I want it I better get up and
[1:14:26] go get it because it's not just going to
[1:14:28] fall into my lap but I can only imagine
[1:14:31] if I had lots of money you know we're
[1:14:34] kind of fellowshipping around this guess
[1:14:36] maybe it's kind of why it came you look
[1:14:38] at some of these stars and some of these
[1:14:40] like billionaire people some of these
[1:14:42] people who are seemingly Untouchable
[1:14:44] maybe in Hollywood or in the finance
[1:14:46] world I'm not going to name any names
[1:14:48] but you probably have seen the news and
[1:14:50] seen some of the stuff going on these
[1:14:52] people get so busy with money in their
[1:14:53] lives what happens to them them is they
[1:14:55] go into a vacuum and now they have
[1:14:57] nothing to do because they've done it
[1:14:59] all they don't have any more dreams so
[1:15:02] they just get
[1:15:03] corrupted don't think about Swift
[1:15:05] destruction to be a lightning bolt from
[1:15:07] God because that might not be
[1:15:11] it going on paragraph 47 he says these
[1:15:14] false prophets are oh sorry going on
[1:15:16] we'll continue on with first 2 Timothy
[1:15:20] 4: 3 to 4 for the time will come when
[1:15:23] they will not endure sound Doctrine but
[1:15:25] after their own lusts this is the
[1:15:27] problem shall Heap to themselves
[1:15:29] teachers having itching ears and they
[1:15:31] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:15:33] truth and shall be turned unto fables
[1:15:37] ideas in their mind thinking everything
[1:15:39] is right when it's not according to the
[1:15:41] word 1 Timothy 4:1 now the spirit
[1:15:45] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[1:15:48] times some shall depart from the faith
[1:15:50] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:15:53] doctrines of devils I think we talk
[1:15:54] talked about this last time don't think
[1:15:56] those seducing spirits and doctrines of
[1:15:58] devils are going to be raging monsters
[1:16:00] they're going to be polished religious
[1:16:04] maybe even message
[1:16:07] Believers
[1:16:10] so-called now in every case you will
[1:16:13] notice that a false prophet is one who
[1:16:16] is
[1:16:17] outside the
[1:16:19] word just as we showed you that
[1:16:22] Antichrist means an
[1:16:25] antiw so it doesn't have to be some some
[1:16:29] some personality that we read about
[1:16:31] earlier in this chapter some great
[1:16:33] person who will become the anti the
[1:16:37] Antichrist anyone anything that's
[1:16:40] contrary to the word that's outside of
[1:16:41] the word and I want to say this what's
[1:16:43] outside of the word for our day the
[1:16:45] messenger for the age anyone that's
[1:16:46] living outside of that is Antichrist
[1:16:50] it's good or evil brothers and sisters
[1:16:52] just as we showed you that Antichrist
[1:16:54] means means anti- word so these false
[1:16:57] prophets come perverting the word giving
[1:17:00] it a meaning that fits their own
[1:17:03] devilish ends my that's hard have you
[1:17:06] ever noticed how the people who lead
[1:17:09] others
[1:17:10] astray bind them closely to themselves
[1:17:13] by
[1:17:15] fear you ever noticed
[1:17:18] that now we can look out and say you see
[1:17:21] in the world there's people that have
[1:17:23] done that all over the place many
[1:17:26] stories in in Wikipedia I'm sure that we
[1:17:29] could see in news articles how there's
[1:17:31] been Cults and different
[1:17:35] things but you know there's churches
[1:17:37] that claim to believe this message of
[1:17:40] the hour where
[1:17:42] ministers I'm going to say prophets will
[1:17:44] say that if you don't do what I say
[1:17:46] you're lost if you don't actually do
[1:17:50] what I command you to do then you're
[1:17:53] actually not going to make it to heaven
[1:17:55] and they would go so far as to say that
[1:17:57] you will actually go to
[1:17:59] hell I've heard people witness that
[1:18:01] testimony shocking but it's right here
[1:18:04] in the
[1:18:04] word they try and bind People Ministry
[1:18:07] of fear if you don't do it the way that
[1:18:09] I do it if you don't believe it the way
[1:18:11] that I believe it if you don't follow
[1:18:13] the tradition that I believe is the
[1:18:16] right
[1:18:17] one what do what what does it matter
[1:18:19] what we believe what about what the word
[1:18:22] says the prophet was given to us to
[1:18:25] bring the church back in
[1:18:29] line my have you ever noticed how the
[1:18:32] people who lead others astray bind them
[1:18:35] closely to themselves by fear they say
[1:18:38] that if the people don't want to do what
[1:18:40] they say or if they leave that's a big
[1:18:43] one if you leave you're going to hell
[1:18:46] then destruction will follow they're
[1:18:49] false
[1:18:50] prophets they're false prophets anyone
[1:18:53] that would want to try and say that I'm
[1:18:56] the boss in this message of the hour is
[1:18:59] a false prophet anyone that wants to be
[1:19:03] in control trying to control everyone
[1:19:06] and saying the words that we've heard
[1:19:08] brothers and sisters they're a false
[1:19:09] prophet they're Antichrist they have a
[1:19:11] devilish desire and you know the sad
[1:19:14] thing is they might not even know it
[1:19:16] they might believe with all their heart
[1:19:17] that they're actually in the service of
[1:19:19] the
[1:19:20] Lord but that's where it becomes so
[1:19:22] close that it would deceive the very
[1:19:23] elected if it were possible it's
[1:19:25] impossible to deceive the very elected
[1:19:27] because the very elected will have the
[1:19:29] Holy
[1:19:30] Ghost and you will never fool the Holy
[1:19:32] Ghost with a devilish desire that's
[1:19:37] impossible my for a true Prophet will
[1:19:40] always lead one to the
[1:19:43] word a true Prophet will always lead one
[1:19:48] to the word and bind the people to Jesus
[1:19:53] Christ
[1:19:55] and bind the people to Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ and he won't tell the people to
[1:20:02] fear Him or what he
[1:20:04] says but to fear what the word
[1:20:09] says this is just so
[1:20:13] liberating if there's anybody that has
[1:20:15] any doubt about the message of the hour
[1:20:17] whether you're present or whether you're
[1:20:19] streaming hear these
[1:20:21] words this man pushed people to Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ and tonight I say it we all agree
[1:20:31] collectively we push people to Jesus
[1:20:35] Christ because he's the only one that
[1:20:38] died for us on Calvary he's the only one
[1:20:41] that shed his
[1:20:42] blood for
[1:20:45] us so
[1:20:47] beautiful it just makes it so clear so
[1:20:49] easy my notice how these people like
[1:20:53] Judas are out for for
[1:20:56] money you know the word says that if you
[1:20:59] just put put him first then all these
[1:21:01] other things will be added unto
[1:21:04] you if if we just put the word
[1:21:07] first then all the rest of it will
[1:21:09] happen but if we let anything get in our
[1:21:12] way of the
[1:21:14] word look out I know by experience look
[1:21:19] out it can get to be a bumpy road in
[1:21:21] this life it ain't all about money
[1:21:24] remember sometimes God will actually
[1:21:26] give us over to our
[1:21:29] desires to let us go through some
[1:21:31] experience to actually learn we know
[1:21:34] that experience what does it do it
[1:21:35] brings
[1:21:36] patience that's what experience does
[1:21:39] brother Brandon goes on to say they get
[1:21:41] you to sell all you have and give it to
[1:21:44] them and their
[1:21:47] schemes man I know of a message church
[1:21:49] right now that has called people to sell
[1:21:51] all they have and actually get pick up
[1:21:54] and move move and go and live in the
[1:21:56] place where this this this preacher this
[1:21:59] pastor
[1:22:00] is exactly what he's saying here people
[1:22:04] that claim this
[1:22:06] message I wonder if they've read this
[1:22:09] book those who attempt to operate
[1:22:12] they're probably not allowed to by the
[1:22:14] way those who attempt to operate gifts
[1:22:17] will make use of a gift which has a
[1:22:20] margin of error in it and then ask for
[1:22:24] money
[1:22:26] and neglect the word and call it of
[1:22:30] God and people will go to them and bear
[1:22:33] with them and support them and believe
[1:22:37] them not knowing it is the way of
[1:22:43] death yes the land is
[1:22:45] full doesn't say the land is got a few
[1:22:49] says the land is
[1:22:52] full of carnal and
[1:22:56] inations in the last
[1:22:58] day they will try to imitate that
[1:23:01] Prophet messenger and I think this is
[1:23:04] where it gets real good this is where it
[1:23:06] gets real good the seven sons of CA
[1:23:10] tried to imitate Paul remember that
[1:23:12] story I I just felt inspired to go there
[1:23:15] tonight I'm just going to turn to two
[1:23:16] scriptures tonight both in Acts if we
[1:23:18] could turn to Acts
[1:23:22] 19 first time I heard this story my
[1:23:24] pastor brother Ken preached on it
[1:23:26] brother Ken
[1:23:30] Boer our late Pastor here I never forget
[1:23:33] it I was a brand new Christian and I was
[1:23:36] shocked when I heard this story verse
[1:23:40] 13 out of Acts chapter 19 then certain
[1:23:44] of the Vagabond Jews
[1:23:46] exorcists took upon them to call over
[1:23:49] them which had evil
[1:23:52] spirits the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:23:55] saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul
[1:23:58] preacheth
[1:24:00] trying to to work the mighty Works
[1:24:03] trying to benefit from it let's have a
[1:24:06] show we'll actually demonstrate the
[1:24:08] power of God and you know what people
[1:24:10] will follow us we'll bind people to us
[1:24:12] exactly what the prophet was describing
[1:24:14] here and you know we know you know we
[1:24:17] know we know you
[1:24:19] know this is the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:24:22] these words here it's not just a
[1:24:26] prophet verse 14 and there were seven
[1:24:29] sons of onea a Jew and chief of the
[1:24:32] priest which did so and the evil spirit
[1:24:36] answered and said Jesus I know Paul I
[1:24:41] know but who are
[1:24:43] you we don't want to get caught up in a
[1:24:46] situation like this brothers and
[1:24:48] sisters where we can actually begin to
[1:24:51] try and put the gifts out front of the
[1:24:53] word
[1:24:54] when we try and do that especially if
[1:24:57] you are called by the Lord he's going to
[1:25:00] allow things to happen and you know this
[1:25:03] guy here he never had the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:05] his life they they they weren't
[1:25:06] protected that way so what
[1:25:08] happened verse 16 says and the man in
[1:25:11] whom the evil spirit was leapt on them
[1:25:15] and overcame them and prevailed against
[1:25:18] them so they fled out of that house
[1:25:20] naked and wounded and you know I just
[1:25:23] can't help but would think they left
[1:25:25] that house a little bit Leo Dean
[1:25:28] thinking they were rich and increased
[1:25:30] with Goods but didn't realize that they
[1:25:32] were naked oh my and they were probably
[1:25:35] nearly Blind by what happened what the
[1:25:38] word is saying there brothers and
[1:25:39] sisters is the devil thrashed them they
[1:25:42] got a good thrashing by the
[1:25:45] devil you got the holy ghost in your
[1:25:47] life that ain't never going to
[1:25:50] happen and this was known to all the
[1:25:52] Jews and Greeks
[1:25:55] also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell
[1:25:58] on all of them and the name of the Lord
[1:26:01] Jesus was
[1:26:02] magnified and that's the way it's
[1:26:04] supposed to be brothers and sisters the
[1:26:06] name of the Lord Jesus is supposed to be
[1:26:09] magnified there's no great ministry in
[1:26:11] this world some people will say well
[1:26:13] that's easy for you to say brother
[1:26:17] Barry you whatever whatever whatever
[1:26:20] whatever I've got this ministry I've got
[1:26:22] that Ministry we've got all these other
[1:26:23] minist Ries that have been in the
[1:26:25] ministry for all these years you know
[1:26:28] it's fine it's good we have experience
[1:26:31] we understand but do we have the Holy
[1:26:35] Ghost because if we don't have the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost if we're not preaching the Holy
[1:26:39] Ghost then we're preaching something
[1:26:41] wrong if it's all mystery there's a
[1:26:44] problem because that mystery is history
[1:26:47] the prophet was actually here he did his
[1:26:49] job the seals were opened there's no
[1:26:52] more Mysteries those seven unknown
[1:26:54] Thunders that were contained in the Book
[1:26:57] of Revelation they're they're actually
[1:26:59] known now they're not unknown they're
[1:27:01] known I could go a long ways with that
[1:27:04] what I'm at tonight brothers and sisters
[1:27:06] I want to bring this out and say look we
[1:27:09] need to know where we stand brother
[1:27:10] brandham just briefly talks about it the
[1:27:12] seven sons of CA they tried to imitate
[1:27:15] Paul Simon the Sorcerer tried to imitate
[1:27:17] Peter let's quickly turn over to Acts
[1:27:19] chapter 8 just uh a few scriptures back
[1:27:22] in the book of Acts
[1:27:29] I guess where I'm going with this is
[1:27:31] even though people will try and imitate
[1:27:33] the prophet they'll try and imitate the
[1:27:34] word of God they'll try and imitate the
[1:27:36] true Ministry of the Lord God won't be
[1:27:40] mocked that's the word of God he will
[1:27:43] not be mocked we can try all we want but
[1:27:46] one day he's going to let it come out
[1:27:48] and it will all be known Simon the
[1:27:51] Sorcerer in Acts 8 verse n but there was
[1:27:55] a certain man called Simon which Before
[1:27:58] Time in the same city used sorcery and
[1:28:01] what did he do he Bewitched the people
[1:28:03] he Bewitched the people of Samaria
[1:28:05] giving out that himself was some great
[1:28:08] one to whom they all gave heed from the
[1:28:11] least to the greatest saying this man is
[1:28:15] a great is the great power of God and to
[1:28:18] him they had regard because of that long
[1:28:21] time that he had Bewitched them with
[1:28:23] sorc
[1:28:24] naries brothers and sisters I'm throwing
[1:28:27] this out there tonight and forgive me
[1:28:29] for it but tenure obviously doesn't mean
[1:28:32] you're
[1:28:34] right I've been in the message for a
[1:28:36] long long time have you got the Holy
[1:28:40] Ghost since you
[1:28:46] believe they had regard because of the
[1:28:49] long time that he Bewitched them with
[1:28:52] the sorceries he bound them to him just
[1:28:54] like the prophet was saying
[1:28:56] here I I think this is just just
[1:28:59] incredible what does it say here the
[1:29:02] word of God and the people will go to
[1:29:03] them and bear with them and support them
[1:29:08] and believe
[1:29:10] them this is a prophet saying these
[1:29:12] words here not me not knowing it is the
[1:29:15] way of death yes the land is full of
[1:29:18] carnal
[1:29:19] impersonations here we have this guy
[1:29:21] bewitching the people
[1:29:24] but God's not going to be
[1:29:26] mocked but when they believed Phillip
[1:29:28] preaching the things concerning the
[1:29:30] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ they were baptized both men and
[1:29:35] women then Simon himself believed also
[1:29:38] Simon could see the power of
[1:29:41] God he was transforming
[1:29:44] himself and when he was baptized he
[1:29:46] continued with philli and wondered
[1:29:48] beholding the Miracles and signs which
[1:29:51] were
[1:29:52] done now when the Apostles which were at
[1:29:55] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:29:58] received the word of God they sent unto
[1:30:00] them Peter and John who when they come
[1:30:03] down prayed for them that they might
[1:30:05] receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was
[1:30:08] was Fallen upon none of them only they
[1:30:11] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:30:15] Jesus then laid they their hands on them
[1:30:18] and they received the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:21] when Simon saw that through laying on of
[1:30:24] the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was
[1:30:26] given remember this was the Jewish way
[1:30:28] the Holy Ghost was given he offered them
[1:30:32] money his carnality got in the way he
[1:30:36] couldn't let go of the old and grab on
[1:30:39] to the
[1:30:40] new and saying give me also this power
[1:30:44] that on whomsoever I lay hands he may
[1:30:47] receive the Holy Ghost so he wanted to
[1:30:50] have a show he just wanted to have the
[1:30:51] sign and the Wonder so he could what
[1:30:54] draw people unto them so he could get
[1:30:55] people to bear with him and support him
[1:30:58] and believe him right saying give me
[1:31:02] also this power that whomsoever I lay
[1:31:04] hands may may also receive the Holy
[1:31:07] Ghost but Peter said unto him thy money
[1:31:09] perish with thee because thou Hast
[1:31:13] thought that the gift of God may be
[1:31:15] purchased with
[1:31:17] money and there's a lot of that in the
[1:31:19] church brothers and sisters where people
[1:31:21] try to usurp the power of influence
[1:31:23] fluence because they earn a lot of money
[1:31:27] cuz they earn a lot of money means their
[1:31:29] tithe should have more influence than
[1:31:32] the Widow with two mites at the door and
[1:31:36] we know Jesus when he was here on Earth
[1:31:38] he asked the disciples which one gave
[1:31:41] more H but you know what it is it's
[1:31:43] politics and I'll go even further to say
[1:31:46] that it's a demonic Spirit trying to
[1:31:48] control the church through politics but
[1:31:51] you won't control the Holy Ghost clearly
[1:31:52] as we've read in these scriptures here
[1:31:55] we know that that that Peter said to him
[1:31:57] thou Hast neither part nor lot in this
[1:32:00] matter for thy heart is not right in the
[1:32:03] sight of God the word of God is quick
[1:32:06] and powerful and sharp sharper than any
[1:32:09] two-edged sword it's it's Discerning of
[1:32:12] the joints and the marrow it goes
[1:32:14] between the muscle and the bone boy we
[1:32:16] saw a lot of that this week you know we
[1:32:18] were talking about that and and how that
[1:32:21] sharp two-edged sword it goes beyond all
[1:32:24] of the natural carnality the Flesh and
[1:32:26] Blood and it discerns the very heart of
[1:32:29] the
[1:32:30] man here we have it in action thy heart
[1:32:34] is not right in the sight of God repent
[1:32:36] therefore of this thy wickedness and
[1:32:38] pray God if perhaps the thought if
[1:32:42] perhaps the thought of thine heart may
[1:32:45] be forgiven thee for I perceive that
[1:32:48] thou art in the gall of bitterness and
[1:32:51] in the bond of iniquity knowing to do
[1:32:55] something and not doing it and knowing
[1:32:58] not to do something but yet going ahead
[1:33:00] and doing it in the bond of iniquity
[1:33:03] that answered Simon and said pray ye to
[1:33:05] the Lord for me that none of these
[1:33:07] things which ye have spoken come upon me
[1:33:10] we know the word the Lord said to him
[1:33:12] just shake your clothes off shake your
[1:33:14] clothes dust your clothes if they're not
[1:33:16] willing to to hear you and just move on
[1:33:19] just a tremendous thought brothers and
[1:33:21] sisters that uh both of these stories
[1:33:24] here he just brushes over it the seven
[1:33:25] sons of CA tried to imitate Paul Simon
[1:33:28] the Sorcerer tried to imitate Peter
[1:33:30] their impersonations will be carnal they
[1:33:34] won't be able to produce what the true
[1:33:37] Prophet produces now I'm I'm going to
[1:33:39] say this brothers and sisters because I
[1:33:41] think it's really important in the day
[1:33:42] in which we live don't look at T
[1:33:45] evangelists I automatically thought
[1:33:47] about that I would think about that I
[1:33:49] grew up watching it late night
[1:33:51] television and I would see it t
[1:33:52] evangelist and I'd be like yeah another
[1:33:54] one another one another one you know
[1:33:55] we're not talking about that we're
[1:33:57] talking about it being so close that it
[1:33:58] would deceive the very elected if it
[1:34:00] were possible it's not going to be out
[1:34:02] there it's going to be right
[1:34:06] here their impersonations will be carnal
[1:34:10] they won't be able to produce what the
[1:34:12] true Prophet produces when he says the
[1:34:15] Revival is over they will go around
[1:34:18] claiming a great Revelation that what
[1:34:21] the people have is exactly right and God
[1:34:25] is going to do bigger and more wonderful
[1:34:27] things amongst the people and the people
[1:34:29] will fall for
[1:34:33] it sell all you got and move to wherever
[1:34:37] because that's where the Rapture is
[1:34:38] going to
[1:34:40] be you know sell all you got and and and
[1:34:42] move to wherever because we've got the
[1:34:46] Holy Ghost we've got the edge it's us
[1:34:48] for no more you know unless you're born
[1:34:50] into this lineage you're not going to
[1:34:51] make it to heaven right
[1:34:54] all of these false doctrines doctrines
[1:34:57] with devilish
[1:34:58] Desires in the day in which we live the
[1:35:02] people will fall for it how will they
[1:35:04] fall for it they don't have the Holy
[1:35:06] Ghost get the Holy
[1:35:10] Ghost these same false prophets will
[1:35:12] claim that the messenger of the last day
[1:35:15] is not a theologian so he ought not to
[1:35:18] be heard they'll have some kind of an
[1:35:20] edge they'll be the teacher they'll say
[1:35:22] that you know there's another messenger
[1:35:24] or whatever there'll be something that
[1:35:26] will cause them to say that that you
[1:35:28] need to listen to them and they're right
[1:35:31] there in the world right now there's
[1:35:32] people that will actually pray in the
[1:35:33] name of someone I'm not going to name a
[1:35:36] name from the pulpit I don't think it's
[1:35:38] worth it but you know there's only one
[1:35:40] name whereby you should be saved there's
[1:35:44] only one
[1:35:46] name they won't be able to produce what
[1:35:49] the messenger can they won't be
[1:35:51] Vindicated by God as the last day
[1:35:54] Prophet is but with their great swelling
[1:35:57] words and with the weight of their
[1:35:59] worldwide
[1:36:01] notoriety they will warn the people not
[1:36:03] to hear that man messenger and they will
[1:36:07] say he teaches
[1:36:08] wrong they are running exactly true to
[1:36:12] their fathers the Pharisees who were of
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] devil for they claimed that both John
[1:36:18] and Jesus taught
[1:36:20] error now why do these false prophets
[1:36:22] come against the true prophet and
[1:36:24] discredit his teaching because they are
[1:36:27] running true to form as did their
[1:36:29] forefathers when in the days of Ahab
[1:36:33] they withstood
[1:36:35] Micaiah there were 400 of them and all
[1:36:38] of them were in
[1:36:41] agreement my you know brothers and
[1:36:43] sisters I think I talked about this last
[1:36:44] time I I feel like I want to start
[1:36:46] preaching right now and I know we've
[1:36:48] only got a few minutes left but you know
[1:36:50] just because everyone's doing it don't
[1:36:52] mean it's right
[1:36:54] just because everyone agrees with it
[1:36:56] don't mean it's right this is what the
[1:36:57] prophet's saying here that's what the
[1:36:59] word of God says there was 400 God
[1:37:02] Prophets The Prophet said 400 of them
[1:37:05] all agreeing go up and take the land
[1:37:09] naturally speaking it was their land oh
[1:37:12] my but there was one God Prophet that
[1:37:16] said you know what don't do it he gave
[1:37:19] him fair warning he said don't do it but
[1:37:23] if you do knew
[1:37:25] it I I'm going to be a false prophet if
[1:37:27] you actually make it back
[1:37:30] alive Why by them all saying the same
[1:37:34] thing they fooled the people but one
[1:37:37] Prophet just one was right and all the
[1:37:40] rest wrong because God had committed the
[1:37:43] Revelation to only
[1:37:45] one beware of false prophets for they
[1:37:49] are ravening wolves if you are still in
[1:37:52] any doubt about this ask God I love how
[1:37:55] he says this brothers and sisters I say
[1:37:57] this too if you are in any doubt about
[1:38:00] this ask God by his Spirit to fill you
[1:38:05] and Lead
[1:38:07] You and outside of that brothers and
[1:38:09] sisters you will not be in that category
[1:38:12] of the very
[1:38:14] elect if you resist the holy ghost in
[1:38:16] your life you will not be the very elect
[1:38:20] because the very elect will say amen I
[1:38:22] want that Holy Ghost I want to follow
[1:38:25] the word for my day he says ask God by
[1:38:29] his Spirit to fill you and lead
[1:38:32] you for the very elect can't be fooled
[1:38:34] he says it did you get that there isn't
[1:38:37] any man that can fool you Paul could not
[1:38:41] fool any elect had he been wrong and in
[1:38:45] that first Ephesian age the elect there
[1:38:48] could not be fooled for they tried the
[1:38:50] false Pro false Apostles and Prophets
[1:38:53] prophets and found them to be liars and
[1:38:57] put them out Hallelujah his sheep hear
[1:39:00] his voice and they follow him amen I
[1:39:03] believe
[1:39:05] it the salutation Revelations 3
[1:39:09] ver4 these things saith the amen the
[1:39:12] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:39:16] of the creation of
[1:39:18] God my isn't that the most wonderful
[1:39:21] description of the attribut Utes of our
[1:39:24] lovely Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:39:27] Christ these words just make me want to
[1:39:31] shout they bring such a spirit of
[1:39:34] reality into my heart just reading them
[1:39:38] without even waiting for a thorough
[1:39:40] revelation of the spirit upon them
[1:39:43] Thrills
[1:39:44] me Jesus is giving us this description
[1:39:48] of himself in relation to the last age
[1:39:51] the days of grace are winding up
[1:39:54] he has looked from the first century
[1:39:56] right through to the 20th and told us
[1:40:00] all things concerning these ages before
[1:40:03] he reveals the characteristics of the
[1:40:06] last age to us he gives us one final
[1:40:10] look at his own gracious and supreme
[1:40:14] deity this is the Capstone revelation of
[1:40:18] himself
[1:40:22] my I just just have that highlighted
[1:40:24] it's such a powerful sentence thus saith
[1:40:27] the amen Jesus is the amen of God Jesus
[1:40:32] is the so let it be of God Amen stands
[1:40:37] for finality it stands for approval it
[1:40:42] stands for prevailing promise it stands
[1:40:46] for unchanging promise it stands for the
[1:40:50] Seal of God and you know brothers and
[1:40:52] sisters we've heard it said I just want
[1:40:54] to say it tonight I feel it I just I
[1:40:57] really do you know every time you say
[1:40:59] Amen to the word of God something
[1:41:02] happens inside of you and this is where
[1:41:05] you know we we've talked about it we're
[1:41:06] going to continue to talk about it Lord
[1:41:08] willing we're looking for a body change
[1:41:10] that body change is going to happen
[1:41:12] naturally it's going to happen
[1:41:14] spiritually but you know it's not going
[1:41:16] to happen spiritually or naturally if
[1:41:18] we're not having a character change and
[1:41:21] every time we say Amen it does something
[1:41:23] to our character we just accept that
[1:41:25] word into our womb and it comes to life
[1:41:28] greater and greater and greater this
[1:41:30] character has got to be changed to fit
[1:41:34] to be fit to rule and Reign over there
[1:41:37] it's not just going to be sometime we're
[1:41:39] just different people why not because
[1:41:42] the prophet said the only thing that we
[1:41:43] take with us is
[1:41:45] what our character so that character has
[1:41:48] to be worked out right
[1:41:50] here we can't wait for him to change it
[1:41:53] for for us he's not going to change it
[1:41:54] for us if if if if we're
[1:41:57] rebellious children he'll help
[1:42:01] us he'll allow certain circumstances and
[1:42:05] situations to come our way until we're
[1:42:07] willing to actually pass the
[1:42:09] test I say Lord help
[1:42:15] me such a beautiful scripture such a
[1:42:18] beautiful tremendous teaching just my
[1:42:23] I want you to watch this carefully now
[1:42:26] and see something really sweet and
[1:42:28] beautiful I said this is his Endtime
[1:42:31] revelation of himself when the day of
[1:42:34] Grace closes then the Millennium comes
[1:42:38] very shortly thereafter doesn't it well
[1:42:42] read with me Isaiah
[1:42:44] 65
[1:42:47] 16-19 that he who blessed blesseth
[1:42:51] himself in the Earth shall bless himself
[1:42:55] in the god of Truth and he that sweareth
[1:42:58] in the Earth shall swear by the god of
[1:43:01] truth because the former troubles are
[1:43:04] forgotten and because they are HID from
[1:43:07] mine eyes for behold I create new
[1:43:11] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[1:43:15] shall not be remembered nor come into
[1:43:16] mind but be ye glad and rejoice forever
[1:43:21] in that which I create create for behold
[1:43:25] I create
[1:43:27] Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a
[1:43:32] joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and
[1:43:35] joy in my people and the voice of
[1:43:39] weeping shall no more be heard in her
[1:43:43] nor the voice of
[1:43:46] crying what did he
[1:43:48] say he
[1:43:50] said I want you to carefully see
[1:43:53] I want you to watch this carefully now
[1:43:55] and see something really sweet and
[1:43:58] beautiful a description of what he's
[1:44:01] doing what he's going to do what we're
[1:44:03] going to experience in Isaiah
[1:44:06] 65 now this is about New Jerusalem this
[1:44:10] is the Millennium but as we go into the
[1:44:13] Millennium hear what he says about being
[1:44:16] a certain kind of God verse 16 he who
[1:44:20] blesseth himself in the Earth shall
[1:44:23] bless himself in the god of
[1:44:27] Truth the
[1:44:29] word yes that is true but the real
[1:44:33] translation is not God of Truth it is
[1:44:36] God of the
[1:44:37] amen so we read it shall bless himself
[1:44:41] in the god of the amen and he that
[1:44:44] sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the
[1:44:47] god of the amen because the former
[1:44:50] troubles are forgotten and because they
[1:44:53] are HID from mine eyes for behold I
[1:44:57] create new heavens and a new Earth and
[1:45:00] the former shall not be
[1:45:02] remembered nor come into
[1:45:05] mind can you imagine that we won't have
[1:45:09] to deal with all the garbage it won't
[1:45:11] even come into our mind we'll forget
[1:45:13] it it's a wonderful thing but be ye glad
[1:45:18] and rejoice forever in that which I
[1:45:21] create for behold I create Jerusalem a
[1:45:24] rejoicing and her people a joy and I
[1:45:27] will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my
[1:45:30] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[1:45:33] no more heard in her nor more nor the
[1:45:36] voice of crying
[1:45:38] Hallelujah here is Jehovah of the Old
[1:45:41] Testament the god of the amen here is
[1:45:45] Jesus of the New Testament the god of
[1:45:48] the amen here o Israel the Lord thy God
[1:45:52] is one God there it is again the Jehovah
[1:45:56] of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the
[1:46:00] new here o Israel the Lord thy God is
[1:46:06] one
[1:46:08] God the New Testament does not reveal
[1:46:11] another God it is a further revelation
[1:46:15] of the one and same God I better call
[1:46:18] the musicians up as we near the the time
[1:46:28] Christ did not come down to make himself
[1:46:31] known he did not come to reveal the
[1:46:35] son he came to reveal and make known the
[1:46:41] father that's pretty
[1:46:43] powerful that goes against a lot of the
[1:46:46] theological world right there he did not
[1:46:49] come to reveal the son he did he came to
[1:46:53] reveal and make known the father he
[1:46:55] never talked about two Gods he talked
[1:46:58] about one
[1:47:06] God he talked about one God and now in
[1:47:09] this last
[1:47:11] age we have come back to the Capstone
[1:47:16] Revelation the most important revelation
[1:47:20] of godhead in the whole Bible maybe
[1:47:23] stand with me as we close with this
[1:47:25] paragraph the most important revelation
[1:47:28] of godhead in the whole Bible that is
[1:47:32] Jesus Is
[1:47:34] God he and the father are one there is
[1:47:38] one God and his name is the Lord Jesus
[1:47:45] Christ it sounds so Elementary and so
[1:47:49] normal we know it we've heard it we
[1:47:51] experience it but but just try and
[1:47:54] explain that to someone who fully
[1:47:56] believes in the trinitarian doctrine and
[1:47:59] see what kind of a reaction you
[1:48:01] get because it's false and we we heard
[1:48:04] all about the false tonight people get
[1:48:06] angry people don't want to be wrong but
[1:48:09] you know Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:48:10] corrected by the word of God they're
[1:48:13] willing to endure
[1:48:15] chastisement is not pleasant for the
[1:48:17] moment not for any one of us but what it
[1:48:20] does is it it it brings forth the
[1:48:23] Peaceable fruit of righteousness in our
[1:48:25] lives and and that's literally the life
[1:48:27] of Jesus Christ becoming humble to the
[1:48:31] word God bless you tonight let's just go
[1:48:33] ahead and
[1:48:36] pray dear gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:48:38] thank you for this opportunity one more
[1:48:40] time to gather together Lord around this
[1:48:44] thought of your word and the study of
[1:48:48] your word through the lens of this book
[1:48:50] lord we know that your Vindicated
[1:48:53] Prophet had a desire to try and bring
[1:48:56] together the entirety of this message
[1:48:59] that you gave to him to deliver to the
[1:49:02] people father we know that there was a
[1:49:05] time where that book was simply in the
[1:49:08] hand of one that sat on the throne we
[1:49:10] know that was you and no one was worthy
[1:49:13] in heaven to take that book or even look
[1:49:16] upon it and John wept greatly because he
[1:49:18] saw that but there was one that was
[1:49:21] found a
[1:49:23] lamb the lion of the tribe of Judah was
[1:49:26] able to take that book and loose the
[1:49:27] seals and he did and there came another
[1:49:30] time where that Mighty Angel took the
[1:49:32] same book and descended upon the Earth
[1:49:35] put one foot on the land and one foot on
[1:49:37] the sea and declared that time shall be
[1:49:39] no more in the days of the
[1:49:42] voice of the seventh angel messenger oh
[1:49:47] my and we know that there was a time
[1:49:49] where that messenger was up in a canyon
[1:49:51] because you called him the there and you
[1:49:53] put something in his hand father we
[1:49:56] thank you for that and Lord Jesus
[1:49:59] tonight here we are just partaking of
[1:50:01] that all that Adam lost being restored
[1:50:05] back into man's hands again help us Lord
[1:50:09] Jesus to be diligent with what you've
[1:50:11] given to us help us not to
[1:50:14] circumnavigate to make excuses for our
[1:50:17] own behaviors Lord but help us to to
[1:50:19] take our behaviors and line them up with
[1:50:21] your word Lord
[1:50:23] Jesus let our goals reflect that father
[1:50:26] let us have the desire to set a goal to
[1:50:29] just adjust our lives to match your word
[1:50:33] as we go forwards Lord we can't look
[1:50:36] backwards at what we've been we only
[1:50:38] want to look forwards to to who you have
[1:50:41] created us to be Lord Jesus that you
[1:50:43] would have the preeminence in every
[1:50:45] moment in every day of Our
[1:50:47] Lives father we love you we thank you we
[1:50:50] pray that we would just be able to
[1:50:52] consider the word spoken tonight Lord
[1:50:54] that we would remember the Capstone
[1:50:56] revelation of the Bible is that you are
[1:50:59] one
[1:51:00] God you are one in the Old Testament you
[1:51:04] are one in the New Testament you are one
[1:51:07] today in the hearts of your children
[1:51:10] you're one in this message that we so
[1:51:12] dearly believe you are God the Lord
[1:51:16] Jesus Christ and it's you that we serve
[1:51:19] father we just commit each life into
[1:51:21] your hands each family each and every
[1:51:23] need Lord father we pray that you would
[1:51:25] touch oh Lord Jesus sister Michelle Livy
[1:51:29] the unspoken request tonight father you
[1:51:32] know it and we know that you are more
[1:51:34] than able father to minister to that
[1:51:36] need father we all have needs and father
[1:51:39] we just commit them into your hands and
[1:51:41] we'll be careful to bring you a praise
[1:51:43] report Lord oh Father even though 10
[1:51:46] lepers were healed and set free father
[1:51:49] one of them had a desire to come and
[1:51:51] give you thanks and Lord Jesus that's
[1:51:53] the desire of every one of our hearts
