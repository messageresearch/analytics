[46:04] musicians if you have your Bibles this
[46:06] morning I'd like to read from John
[46:09] chapter
[46:10] 6 it's kind of an
[46:14] interesting scripture I guess
[46:18] um the direction that I I felt led to go
[46:22] we'll just see what the Lord will do
[46:24] sometimes I get confused and I know it's
[46:27] obvious but I
[46:30] uh it's tough to understand what the
[46:32] Lord wants to do we just want to trust
[46:33] him and and step forward according to
[46:35] what he leads so in John chapter
[46:39] 6 verse
[46:43] 25 a very familiar
[46:46] story as a starting place for us
[46:51] today and when they had found him on the
[46:54] other side of the
[46:55] sea they said unto him
[46:59] Rabbi when camest thou
[47:02] hither Jesus answered them and said
[47:04] verily verily I say unto you you seek me
[47:08] not because ye saw the
[47:11] Miracles but because ye did eat of the
[47:14] Loaves and were filled amen labor not
[47:18] for the meat which perisheth but for
[47:21] that meat which endureth unto
[47:24] everlasting life which the son of man
[47:26] shall give unto you for him hath God the
[47:31] Father
[47:32] sealed let's just bow in prayer one more
[47:36] time Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[47:39] that you have given us bread to eat
[47:42] father that we could be
[47:43] filled and Lord that we know as
[47:46] Believers of this word that we don't
[47:49] labor for the things of this world but
[47:52] we labor for that Revelation father that
[47:55] word that you have given given us and
[47:58] father I believe that's why the building
[48:00] has all of your children in it today so
[48:02] that Lord Jesus we could be filled with
[48:05] that meat that we could be filled with
[48:07] that bread Lord that father our
[48:09] spiritual appetites would be satisfied
[48:12] father that we would have sustenance
[48:14] that would carry us through until the
[48:17] next time father until you feed us again
[48:20] Lord Jesus our desire is to be ready and
[48:23] ready and waiting and watching for that
[48:26] hour because we know Lord Jesus not what
[48:29] time you will come you will come upon
[48:31] this world as a thief in the night and
[48:33] there will be a secret sudden going away
[48:36] of your bride father help us to be ready
[48:38] for that time we just want to commit all
[48:41] the words that are spoken Lord each one
[48:43] who is here today gathered together in

[50:04] it's his will to have another prosperous
[50:06] year in his word in 2025 are you happy
[50:11] this
[50:12] morning today I want to talk about the
[50:14] importance of
[50:16] Revelation and uh I just think it's a
[50:18] wonderful story here talking about the
[50:22] uh the feeding of the
[50:24] multitudes and we we know this story is
[50:27] is very very familiar how um Jesus fed
[50:31] the people with this bread and maybe we
[50:34] can just go back a little bit in
[50:39] uh in the story here
[50:45] amen bear with me for a
[50:51] second there we go let's just go back in
[50:55] uh John chapter chapter
[50:58] 6 we know that the the people were there
[51:01] and maybe we'll just start reading with
[51:03] verse six of
[51:06] John verse one of chapter 6 in John see
[51:10] I wasn't lying I get
[51:13] confused sometimes it happens pretty
[51:16] easy John chapter 6
[51:20] verse1 after these things Jesus Went
[51:22] Over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea
[51:25] of Tiberius
[51:27] and a great multitude followed him
[51:29] because they saw his miracles and I like
[51:32] the way this is written here it says
[51:35] which he did on them he didn't just do
[51:39] he did them on
[51:41] them that were diseased and Jesus went
[51:44] up into a mountain and there he sat with
[51:47] his disciples and the Passover a feast
[51:49] of the Jews was nigh when Jesus then
[51:53] lifted up his eyes and saw a great
[51:56] company
[51:57] come unto him he saith unto Phillip When
[52:01] shall we buy bread that these may
[52:04] eat just a a neat little story here and
[52:08] and this he said to prove him for he
[52:12] himself knew what he would
[52:15] do Philip answered him 200 penny worth
[52:19] of bread is not sufficient for them that
[52:22] every one of them may take a little one
[52:26] of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's
[52:29] brother saith unto him there is a lad
[52:32] here which hath five barley Loaves and
[52:36] two small
[52:37] fishes but what are they among so
[52:40] many and Jesus said make the men sit
[52:44] down now there was much grass in the
[52:46] place so the men sat down in number
[52:49] about
[52:50] 5,000 and remember he just mentions the
[52:53] men he doesn't mention the women nor the
[52:57] children and it wasn't just a men's
[52:58] meeting you can assume it was everyone
[53:01] right so how many people were there I
[53:04] don't think it was just
[53:06] 5,000 and Jesus Took the Loaves and when
[53:09] he had given thanks he distributed to
[53:11] the disciples and the disciples to them
[53:13] that were set down and likewise of the
[53:16] fishes as much as they would as much as
[53:21] they would they could just keep on
[53:23] eating and eating until they were done
[53:27] there was no limits to how much they
[53:29] could eat it was an all you can eat if
[53:32] you
[53:32] will when they were
[53:35] filled he said unto his disciples gather
[53:38] up the fragments that remain that
[53:41] nothing be
[53:42] lost now therefore they gathered them
[53:45] together and filled 12 baskets with the
[53:49] fragments of the five barley loaves
[53:52] which remained over and above unto them
[53:56] that that had
[53:57] eaten then those men when they had seen
[54:00] the miracle that Jesus did said this is
[54:03] of a truth that Prophet should come into
[54:08] the world when Jesus therefore perceived
[54:11] that they would come and take him by
[54:13] force to make him a king he departed
[54:16] again into a mountain himself
[54:21] alone now I'm just going to pause
[54:24] there and hopefully I don't make this so
[54:27] confusing for
[54:29] everyone
[54:34] um I just love this story bear with me
[54:37] here I want to bring up a quote from the
[54:40] church age book the importance of
[54:42] Revelation and we're not talking about
[54:45] the Book of Revelations although that's
[54:47] a a really good story a really good uh
[54:49] book of symbols a really good book to
[54:51] understand according to the the
[54:53] revelation of the messenger for our age
[54:56] out of the exposition of the seven
[54:59] Church ages brother bradam says the
[55:01] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[55:04] not just Revelation but Revelation by
[55:06] the
[55:08] spirit to the True Believer can never be
[55:12] overemphasized there Never Comes A Place
[55:14] In Time brothers and sisters where we're
[55:16] just
[55:18] revelated we're just got it and that's
[55:20] all it's a continual
[55:23] unfolding because brother badam says
[55:25] here no I I'll say it this way like I
[55:27] always do rather God says it through the
[55:29] prophet Revelation not to the unbeliever
[55:32] or the makeb believer he says it to the
[55:35] True Believer Revelation to the True
[55:37] Believer so this is someone who is
[55:39] actually saved Sanctified and filled
[55:42] with the Holy Ghost otherwise they
[55:44] wouldn't be a True Believer now would
[55:46] they but here we have Revelation the
[55:49] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[55:52] to a True Believer can never be
[55:54] overemphasized Revelations Revelation
[55:56] means more to you than perhaps you
[55:58] realize and I just felt led to get into
[56:00] this discussion today because you know I
[56:03] I I said it a little bit earlier we we
[56:05] can never be over revelated there's
[56:07] there's I believe two things that we
[56:09] will never be able to do too much
[56:11] brother Ram says we'll never pray too
[56:12] much and I would say we'll never have
[56:14] too much Revelation there will never be
[56:17] too much Revelation where we're just so
[56:18] saturated we just don't want anymore you
[56:21] can't tell us anymore we will
[56:23] continually be learning how God unfolds
[56:25] himself throughout eternity that's what
[56:27] the prophet said to us the importance of
[56:30] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[56:32] Believer can never be overemphasized
[56:34] Revelation means more to you than
[56:36] perhaps you
[56:38] realize now I'm not talking about this
[56:40] book of Revelation and you I am talking
[56:42] about all Revelation it is tremendously
[56:46] important to the church do you remember
[56:48] in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the
[56:51] disciples this
[56:52] question whom do men say that I the son
[56:55] of man am and this is the the very
[56:58] familiar this is kind of trigger us to
[57:01] go into the discussion about Peter Simon
[57:04] Peter is really where I want to get into
[57:05] today talking about Revelation but I
[57:08] just felt led to start here I hope it's
[57:10] okay do you remember in Matthew 16 where
[57:13] Jesus asked the disciples this question
[57:15] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[57:17] and they said some said Thou Art John
[57:19] the Baptist some Elias and others
[57:21] Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he
[57:23] said unto them but who say ye that I am
[57:26] who do you say that I am and Simon Peter
[57:30] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[57:33] the son of the Living
[57:35] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[57:39] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[57:44] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[57:46] unto thee but my Father which is in
[57:49] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[57:52] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[57:54] church and the gates of hell shall not
[57:56] Prevail against
[57:58] it as message Believers that's just sort
[58:02] of the Hallmark the Keystone if you
[58:05] excuse me if you will the place that we
[58:08] we kind of Drive the stake down and say
[58:10] amen that's just a wonderful place to be
[58:13] that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[58:16] against it but not against that Peter is
[58:20] the rock that Jesus chose which is what
[58:23] the denominational World took and and
[58:25] made but but yet it is the revelation of
[58:29] Jesus Christ amen the revelation of who
[58:32] Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ actually
[58:36] is the Roman Catholics say that the
[58:39] church is built upon Peter now that is
[58:42] really
[58:42] carnal how could God build the church
[58:45] Upon A man so unstable that he denied
[58:49] the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing
[58:52] it God can't build his church upon any
[58:55] man born in
[58:57] sin but there's billions of people that
[59:01] are traveling that way believing that
[59:03] with all their
[59:04] hearts willing to stake their lives on
[59:08] it
[59:10] why and it wasn't some rock lying there
[59:13] as though God had hallowed the ground at
[59:15] that spot but if you ever go to Rome and
[59:18] you ever go to Vatican City you can see
[59:22] St Peter's Basilica and that is where
[59:25] they claim that Peter was not only
[59:27] crucified upside down but they have
[59:29] buried him under the altar they've got a
[59:31] tremendous altar there in St Peter's
[59:34] Basilica where they say the bones of St
[59:37] Peter actually are but I think that is
[59:40] potentially not exactly what's happening
[59:44] is everything okay here are we
[59:47] okay we're
[59:49] okay okay yeah sorry I think there are
[59:53] some upgrades done I hope it's okay I
[59:55] just uh
[59:56] noticed something going on I just want
[59:58] to make sure everything's good we don't
[1:00:01] want to be
[1:00:02] nervous God can't build his church upon
[1:00:05] any man born in sin what a wonderful
[1:00:07] thing that is and it wasn't some rock
[1:00:09] lying there as though God had hallowed
[1:00:11] the ground at that spot and it isn't as
[1:00:14] the Protestants say that the church is
[1:00:16] built upon Jesus
[1:00:19] my what is it built upon then as
[1:00:22] Believers we know it was built on
[1:00:24] Revelation read it the way it is written
[1:00:27] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but
[1:00:30] my father hath revealed it and Upon This
[1:00:33] Rock Revelation I will build my church
[1:00:36] the church is built on
[1:00:39] Revelation on thus sayith the
[1:00:45] Lord the importance of Revelation
[1:00:47] brothers and sisters we can never ever
[1:00:50] overemphasize the importance of
[1:00:53] Revelation I just think uh
[1:00:57] I got thinking about the the Flesh of
[1:00:59] the son of man you know how brother Bram
[1:01:02] he talks about that many times how Jesus
[1:01:04] said it unless you eat my flesh and you
[1:01:08] drink my blood you have no part with me
[1:01:10] you have no life in you he says it a
[1:01:12] couple different ways there's there's a
[1:01:14] real problem unless you do that and we
[1:01:16] know that he did that for a reason he
[1:01:17] did that to thin out the people that
[1:01:19] were following him to show who is who to
[1:01:22] to to manifest the seed that was inside
[1:01:25] of the people amen and they can't help
[1:01:28] it and I love that thought myself as we
[1:01:31] Minister the word as we hear the truth
[1:01:34] of the word of God in the day in which
[1:01:36] we live brothers and sisters only one
[1:01:38] thing is going to happen when we hear
[1:01:40] the pure word of God come forward
[1:01:42] according to the Vindicated messenger
[1:01:44] for our age the true seed that's inside
[1:01:47] of every single human being is going to
[1:01:49] come to life and there's no way that we
[1:01:52] can stop that and that is by revelation
[1:01:55] of the spirit amen the Father which is
[1:01:58] in heaven I think it's just so beautiful
[1:02:00] though when you think about the Flesh of
[1:02:02] the son of man unless you eat his flesh
[1:02:06] how much of an offensive statement that
[1:02:08] would have been to all of the religious
[1:02:10] zealots in the day all of the priests
[1:02:13] all of the Levites everyone who would
[1:02:15] ever hear those words would be mortified
[1:02:18] to hear that you could not even touch a
[1:02:20] dead
[1:02:21] body you could not have anything to do
[1:02:24] with blood we know the Old Testament law
[1:02:26] I'm not going to go too far into that
[1:02:28] but there was very specific instructions
[1:02:30] according to the law yeah and what was
[1:02:32] happening here was there was a corner
[1:02:34] being turned according to the scripture
[1:02:37] amen and without Revelation by the
[1:02:39] spirit people were missing it and it's
[1:02:41] no different today it's Jesus Christ the
[1:02:43] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:02:45] what's going on is the whole world is
[1:02:47] going on the track that has been for
[1:02:50] years and years since the fathers fell
[1:02:52] asleep nothing else has changed my
[1:02:54] goodness we've got the Catholic Church
[1:02:56] we've got all the Protestant churches
[1:02:58] we've got the the the the great
[1:03:00] and we've got all of her daughters
[1:03:03] and everyone is a part of it they're all
[1:03:04] cruising along at the same speed they're
[1:03:06] good people yeah but something happened
[1:03:10] right something happened in North
[1:03:12] America there was something that took
[1:03:14] place there was a corner that was turned
[1:03:17] amen and it was according to the word of
[1:03:20] God but you had to have Revelation by
[1:03:22] the spirit to be able to understand what
[1:03:25] that corner was just like you had to
[1:03:27] have Revelation by the spirit to
[1:03:29] understand who the son of man was when
[1:03:32] he came amen but if you look up the
[1:03:35] Flesh of the son of man there's 29
[1:03:37] results and and this really kind of got
[1:03:39] me excited it's just a quirky little
[1:03:41] thing sometimes I look at things this
[1:03:42] way but if you look at the Flesh of the
[1:03:45] son of man there's 29 results in the
[1:03:47] message of the hour if you type that in
[1:03:49] but 28 of them are from
[1:03:53] 1964 onwards
[1:03:55] there's 29 of them but all 28 beyond
[1:03:59] that are actually beyond the first one
[1:04:01] is in 1962 I believe but it just kind of
[1:04:06] just kind of made me think about it it's
[1:04:08] just right at the end of his ministry
[1:04:09] and we know that was a culmination of
[1:04:11] his ministry the culmination of saying
[1:04:13] what the message of the hour truly is
[1:04:16] because when the Church of God
[1:04:18] recognizes what it is yeah come on not
[1:04:21] who she is what it is when the church
[1:04:25] recognizes what it is hallelujah and I'm
[1:04:27] just going to throw in my interpretation
[1:04:29] the son of man once again on Earth in
[1:04:32] flesh if you listen to 1964 you hear
[1:04:35] brother bradam talk about Jesus Christ
[1:04:37] in Flesh on Earth again over and over
[1:04:40] again
[1:04:43] 1964 and then if you look at those
[1:04:45] messages you look at the end of every
[1:04:48] one of them there's a prayer line and
[1:04:50] sometimes there's people who don't have
[1:04:51] prayer cards and he just calls them out
[1:04:53] I keep saying it over and over what was
[1:04:55] that that was not a man that wasn't a
[1:04:59] microphone in the ear that wasn't prayer
[1:05:01] cards give us the information beforehand
[1:05:03] so Billy Paul can run around behind and
[1:05:05] actually give his daddy or whoever's
[1:05:08] talking into the microphone a list of
[1:05:10] information about the people it was it
[1:05:12] was God and it's just so fascinating how
[1:05:15] he did it because he would start with
[1:05:17] one person and he would go to the next
[1:05:19] person and the next person and the next
[1:05:21] person and just continually tell them
[1:05:23] what's wrong with them and that you're
[1:05:25] healed in the name of Jesus Christ who
[1:05:27] could do that the only one that could do
[1:05:29] that is the son of man in flesh once
[1:05:33] again but it takes Revelation by the
[1:05:36] spirit and many people are still
[1:05:38] confusing Revelations 19 where the
[1:05:41] saints come back with him and the
[1:05:43] corridors of Heaven open up and they all
[1:05:45] come back on white horses and there's a
[1:05:47] great cataclysmic event that takes place
[1:05:49] that's not what's going to happen the
[1:05:51] Revelation by the spirit is according to
[1:05:54] the message of the hour the son of man
[1:05:56] Ministry that we're encountering right
[1:05:58] now the tail end of it what's going to
[1:06:00] happen is that the the the bride is just
[1:06:02] going to secret secretly suddenly just
[1:06:05] go away
[1:06:06] amen she's just going to disappear right
[1:06:09] and the world's going to say where'd
[1:06:11] that weirdo go I haven't seen that
[1:06:13] person for a long time I haven't seen
[1:06:15] that that guy named Barry for a long
[1:06:17] time where is that guy where is that
[1:06:20] sister where is that brother there'll be
[1:06:22] a few people wondering potentially Lord
[1:06:24] willing not many
[1:06:29] but it's going to happen in such a way
[1:06:31] that we're not expecting
[1:06:32] it but many people are looking for a
[1:06:36] great man to come on the scene and we
[1:06:38] know that in America they've got their
[1:06:39] great man he's the president-elect and
[1:06:42] he's coming on the scene all right and
[1:06:45] I'm not trying to Mi mix politics with
[1:06:46] the pulpit but what I am saying is that
[1:06:49] there's a lot of people in the world
[1:06:50] looking for a great man someone to come
[1:06:53] and actually save the world but there's
[1:06:55] no saving of this world and we know that
[1:06:58] the USA has a judgment pronounced
[1:07:00] against
[1:07:01] it USA has thus sayith the Lord not in a
[1:07:05] good
[1:07:06] way but that same thus sayith the Lord
[1:07:09] applies to the entire
[1:07:12] world what a blessing and an honor and a
[1:07:15] privilege it is to have ears to hear
[1:07:16] what the son of man spirit said to the
[1:07:18] church in this age to know that we're
[1:07:21] not going to have to contend with all of
[1:07:23] that Hallelujah my goodness Maybe
[1:07:25] they're going to take away our bank
[1:07:26] accounts before we go may maybe they're
[1:07:29] going to take away our driver's licenses
[1:07:31] before we go maybe our bank cards won't
[1:07:33] work maybe our mortgage payments won't
[1:07:35] go through maybe all of our
[1:07:36] cryptocurrency will just burn maybe all
[1:07:39] of the things that we have maybe natural
[1:07:42] faith in we won't have any opportunity
[1:07:45] to use and that will be for a purpose
[1:07:47] that will be so that the son of man can
[1:07:48] show and demonstrate a quick powerful
[1:07:51] demonstration of the power of God by the
[1:07:53] spirit through his bride
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:57] when we start seeing those things happen
[1:07:59] brothers and sisters maybe they will
[1:08:01] maybe they won't we don't know but if
[1:08:03] they do don't be afraid Don't Be Afraid
[1:08:07] take courage and say Amen because I know
[1:08:10] what's happening I know what's going to
[1:08:11] happen there's going to be a short
[1:08:12] powerful demonstration of the son of
[1:08:14] man's
[1:08:16] spirit I think it's
[1:08:19] beautiful in this story
[1:08:22] here it's it's I I don't know like I
[1:08:25] said I just have to trust the Lord
[1:08:26] perhaps it's for someone somehow talking
[1:08:30] about this story here and this little
[1:08:33] boy how how verse 9 says there is a lad
[1:08:36] here which hath five barley Loaves and
[1:08:39] two small fishes but what are they among
[1:08:41] so many we know the story so well the
[1:08:43] points I want to get to here is that
[1:08:46] Jesus fed the people didn't he he took
[1:08:49] the the loaves from the boy and he fed
[1:08:51] the people what if that boy would have
[1:08:52] said no I don't got any loaves I got my
[1:08:55] Five Loaves of my fish and I'm going to
[1:08:58] eat and I'll just run around the corner
[1:09:00] behind the Rock and I'll get my
[1:09:02] sustenance and I'll come back and hang
[1:09:03] out and watch the party and I'll be good
[1:09:06] man I know I worked hard to get these
[1:09:08] and maybe mom or dad gave them the
[1:09:10] Loaves and the fish and you know what if
[1:09:13] he would have not actually volunteered
[1:09:16] what if he would have not given them but
[1:09:18] you know what he did give them he was
[1:09:21] willing to give them and isn't it
[1:09:23] interesting something came over him to
[1:09:25] say I I've got this I I want to try and
[1:09:29] help but isn't it interesting that at
[1:09:31] the very end of this story here God did
[1:09:33] not just take that that bread and fish
[1:09:36] and then leave him destitute what did he
[1:09:38] say he said very carefully gather up all
[1:09:41] of the rest of it make sure that there's
[1:09:44] nothing just wasted and put it all in
[1:09:47] baskets and what was there 12 baskets of
[1:09:49] leftovers so God took and took that that
[1:09:53] that offering we're going to call it of
[1:09:55] the little boy a and he fed everyone
[1:09:58] 5,000 men plus who knows however many
[1:10:01] others and then he still had some left
[1:10:03] over see if God won't bless your
[1:10:06] offerings is my point brothers and
[1:10:08] sisters he will not leave you destitute
[1:10:12] if you're willing to help him he will be
[1:10:14] more than willing to bless you
[1:10:16] abundantly I think it's just such a
[1:10:18] wonderful thing when you look at it that
[1:10:21] way you
[1:10:23] know I just can't help but but think
[1:10:25] about Peter and how he he actually began
[1:10:28] to get Revelation he started to to have
[1:10:31] this Revelation come into his heart and
[1:10:35] we know that there was a time where it
[1:10:37] really struck him and and I believe
[1:10:41] believe sorry it was in Luke 5 let's
[1:10:44] turn over to Luke Chapter 5 just for the
[1:10:48] sake of discussion this
[1:10:50] morning in Luke Luke chapter 5
[1:11:03] just love how Jesus deals with
[1:11:07] us and it came to pass that as this
[1:11:10] verse one of chapter 5 and it came to
[1:11:12] pass that as the people pressed upon him
[1:11:15] to hear the word of God he stood by the
[1:11:18] lake of ganat and saw two ships standing
[1:11:22] by the lake but the fishermen were gone
[1:11:24] out of them and were washing their Nets
[1:11:27] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:11:31] which was
[1:11:32] Simon's he entered into the ship first
[1:11:35] and then he asked him entered into the
[1:11:38] ship which was Simon's excuse me and
[1:11:41] prayed him that he would thrust him out
[1:11:43] a little bit from the land and he sat
[1:11:45] down and he taught the people out of the
[1:11:47] ship now when he had left speaking he
[1:11:50] said unto Simon launch out into the deep
[1:11:54] and let down your nets for a
[1:11:56] drw and Simon answering said unto him
[1:11:59] Master we've toiled all night and have
[1:12:03] taken
[1:12:04] nothing but something inside of him
[1:12:08] something on the inside of him
[1:12:10] nevertheless at Thy word yeah now we
[1:12:14] know the story very well but but let's
[1:12:17] let's just go on and read it I I don't
[1:12:19] need to get in the way here verse six
[1:12:21] says and when they had this done they
[1:12:24] enclosed a great multitud ude of fishes
[1:12:25] and their net break and they beckoned
[1:12:27] unto their Partners which were in the
[1:12:29] other ship that they should come and
[1:12:30] help them and they came and filled both
[1:12:33] the ships so that they began to
[1:12:37] sink and when Simon Peter saw it he fell
[1:12:41] down at jesus' knees saying depart from
[1:12:44] me for I am a sinful man oh
[1:12:48] Lord for he was astonished and all that
[1:12:50] were with him at the drought of the
[1:12:52] fishes which they had taken
[1:12:57] I just think it's so beautiful he goes
[1:12:59] on to say and so was also James and John
[1:13:02] the sons of zebede which were partners
[1:13:04] with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon
[1:13:07] fear not from henceforth Thou shalt
[1:13:10] catch men and we know that that's where
[1:13:14] they said this is the son of man this is
[1:13:18] the one that we've been looking for we
[1:13:19] need to follow this guy and so they they
[1:13:22] gave up fishing and away they went
[1:13:26] but once again isn't it interesting to
[1:13:29] see Jesus come on the scene God in flesh
[1:13:32] come on the scene have a need was he not
[1:13:36] God In the Flesh could he not have
[1:13:38] spoken in such a way that they all would
[1:13:41] have heard but isn't it interesting that
[1:13:44] he had to have a natural circumstance to
[1:13:46] bring to pass his word to bring to pass
[1:13:49] his his will in the situation and that
[1:13:52] was to actually have to borrow the ship
[1:13:56] and by borrowing the ship for a brief
[1:13:58] moment what happened God blessed him
[1:14:00] abundantly
[1:14:02] naturally he gave naturally to God and
[1:14:05] God gave way more naturally back to him
[1:14:09] it's just such a beautiful story I I
[1:14:12] think it's wonderful it's Revelation by
[1:14:14] the spirit brothers and sisters so what
[1:14:17] happened as soon as that happened the
[1:14:18] natural circumstances come on the scene
[1:14:20] he's like whatever I wasn't using my
[1:14:22] ship anyways it's good for nothing I
[1:14:24] can't catch any fish we fished all night
[1:14:25] whatever you might as well just use it
[1:14:28] and he heard the words of life and
[1:14:30] something transpired inside of him right
[1:14:33] it must have just started to ignite that
[1:14:35] seed that was inside of him and what
[1:14:37] happened was God blessed him abundantly
[1:14:39] we've read that I think it's just a
[1:14:41] beautiful thing it was it was the first
[1:14:43] time that Peter really experienced the
[1:14:46] supernatural with the son of man
[1:14:48] Ministry that was in front of him but
[1:14:50] the beautiful part about it is Peter
[1:14:53] said to him neverthe less at Thy word
[1:14:57] I'll follow your instruction and I just
[1:15:00] can't help but think brothers and
[1:15:01] sisters many times we don't need to
[1:15:03] understand we try to say we need to
[1:15:07] understand help me understand what's
[1:15:09] going on in this situation what if we
[1:15:11] said Lord nevertheless at Thy
[1:15:14] word let this situation unfold according
[1:15:17] to your
[1:15:19] will I don't have to understand it
[1:15:21] necessarily I just have to believe it
[1:15:24] but that's where we have to come to the
[1:15:26] place the crossroads every one of us in
[1:15:28] our lives we've got to come to the place
[1:15:29] where we say either God is God and he's
[1:15:31] in complete control of every single
[1:15:34] situation that we live and encounter or
[1:15:36] he's not because he's not in charge and
[1:15:39] in control of some and not others he's
[1:15:43] in control of every single one amen
[1:15:46] every single human being every single
[1:15:49] flee and every single bat of its eye and
[1:15:52] how much tall would come off it is what
[1:15:53] brother bradam said
[1:15:56] he's in
[1:15:57] control but this is the same one that
[1:16:00] Peter said nevertheless at Thy word I I
[1:16:04] just think it's such a beautiful story
[1:16:06] here this is the same one who in The
[1:16:09] Book of Malachi he said prove me in this
[1:16:14] and see if I won't pour out a blessing
[1:16:16] if I won't open the windows of heaven
[1:16:18] and pour out a blessing that you can't
[1:16:21] even contain that's not you don't even
[1:16:23] have room enough to contain the blessing
[1:16:25] that I've got to pour out upon
[1:16:28] you I just love it how he he he God
[1:16:32] sometimes I think we just I think
[1:16:34] brother mvin said it a couple times
[1:16:37] sometimes we want to overp spiritualize
[1:16:38] our lives right God he wants to deal
[1:16:42] with us in the natural realm yes but
[1:16:44] sometimes we want to hypers spiritualize
[1:16:46] things I think brothers and sisters just
[1:16:49] my opinion that's not really good for
[1:16:51] much but I just think God knows our
[1:16:53] natural circumstances he knows our
[1:16:55] natural
[1:16:56] situations we just read two stories to
[1:16:59] explain how he does and did he not come
[1:17:02] and bless them abundantly he knows
[1:17:05] exactly what we're going through he
[1:17:06] knows exactly what our issues and
[1:17:08] problems are all we need to do is commit
[1:17:11] our ways unto him amen we know the the
[1:17:14] scripture we say it many times trust in
[1:17:15] the Lord with all thine heart not most
[1:17:17] of it not part of it all thine heart and
[1:17:21] in all thy ways acknowledge Him every
[1:17:23] single way in our tithe in our offering
[1:17:25] in our school in our marriage in our
[1:17:28] relationships with our parents in our
[1:17:29] relationships as husband and wives in
[1:17:31] our relationships as brothers and
[1:17:32] sisters at deacons at the door as
[1:17:35] Ministers of this gospel in all of our
[1:17:37] ways acknowledge Him and He will direct
[1:17:40] our paths he knows what we need to go
[1:17:41] through he knows if we've toiled all
[1:17:44] night long and not caught any fish he
[1:17:46] knows if we've got Five Loaves in our
[1:17:48] back and nobody else has food that might
[1:17:50] just be enough to sustain everyone and
[1:17:52] if we're willing to say take it all here
[1:17:54] here's all of it I'm not going to hold
[1:17:56] nothing back see what he'll do give you
[1:17:59] 12 baskets back it just makes me think
[1:18:02] of the story we're not talking about the
[1:18:04] natural stuff so much now we're talking
[1:18:06] about Revelation by the spirit what it's
[1:18:08] going to take for us to get that
[1:18:10] Revelation by the spirit is for him to
[1:18:12] know there's no more doors
[1:18:14] indoors there's no more doors that we've
[1:18:16] got to try and open up and go inside and
[1:18:19] see is there another hidden door is
[1:18:21] there another passageway to something
[1:18:24] else that we're holding back and
[1:18:26] hiding many times we can have hurts and
[1:18:29] pains situations in our lives that we're
[1:18:31] just not willing to deal with because it
[1:18:33] hurts too much how much did Jesus hurt
[1:18:36] when he carried his cross up to Calvary
[1:18:38] for us yeah how much did he hurt when he
[1:18:41] actually was tied to that stump and had
[1:18:43] the catanine Tails tearing his body to
[1:18:46] bits so much so that they had to come
[1:18:49] and tell him stop you're not supposed to
[1:18:51] kill him yeah how much pain did he feel
[1:18:55] there the pains that we feel in this
[1:18:56] life brothers and sisters lay them down
[1:18:58] don't drag around a ball and chain and
[1:19:00] have a hidden passageway or Corridor of
[1:19:03] pain that we're holding on to
[1:19:06] amen but he knows our natural
[1:19:09] circumstances better than we
[1:19:11] do he knows them better than we do he
[1:19:13] knows exactly how to relate to us in our
[1:19:16] own
[1:19:17] situations anybody here ever had
[1:19:19] Revelation by the spirit in your natural
[1:19:21] circumstance and know that it's only God
[1:19:24] that could have done that anybody
[1:19:27] anybody experienced that only God would
[1:19:30] have known that only God could have done
[1:19:33] that sometimes we say wow only God could
[1:19:37] have heard that conversation that we
[1:19:39] just had
[1:19:41] right but see if he won't actually open
[1:19:44] up the windows of heaven and prove us on
[1:19:47] it a and today what I'm talking about
[1:19:50] isn't so much in giving giving the
[1:19:55] tithes and offerings I I just wanted to
[1:19:57] do those little comparisons because
[1:19:58] really it it's a it's it's a revelation
[1:20:00] brothers and sisters we can say it all
[1:20:02] we want you know give tithes give
[1:20:04] offerings it it's fine don't worry about
[1:20:07] it we're not pulling for money brother
[1:20:08] mvin said it loud and clear we're not
[1:20:10] pulling for money God supplies all of
[1:20:12] our needs amen according to his riches
[1:20:15] and Glory we're not worried about money
[1:20:17] here what we're worried about is
[1:20:18] Revelation by the spirit that's the
[1:20:20] critical Factor that's what we're
[1:20:22] getting at today that's what I want to
[1:20:23] try and and just just Hammer home is the
[1:20:26] importance of Revelation to us of the
[1:20:28] True Believer the Revelation by the
[1:20:29] spirit to the True Believer can never be
[1:20:31] overemphasized because it's Revelation
[1:20:34] by the spirit that will actually give us
[1:20:36] keys to the kingdom it will give us the
[1:20:38] ability to have trust that our prayers
[1:20:40] are actually being heard it'll give us
[1:20:42] the ability to understand that we don't
[1:20:44] have to have a prophet or a great
[1:20:45] minister to to to call and say oh I've
[1:20:49] got this great need in my life just like
[1:20:51] those two brothers that were wiring the
[1:20:53] trailer and their little son one of the
[1:20:54] of their sons got electrocuted they
[1:20:56] tried to call a prophet tried to call a
[1:20:57] prophet tried to call a prophet couldn't
[1:20:59] get them and they said you know we just
[1:21:00] need to
[1:21:01] pray and what happened they prayed for
[1:21:04] the dead son and he came to life
[1:21:07] Revelation by the spirit God wants to
[1:21:09] manifest in our lives more than we want
[1:21:11] to see him manifest in our lives
[1:21:13] brothers and sisters I think the prophet
[1:21:15] said a thousand times more than we want
[1:21:17] to see him manifest in our lives the
[1:21:20] importance of Revelation can never ever
[1:21:22] be overemphasized and I know there
[1:21:24] people in this room in this life that
[1:21:27] have experienced that level of
[1:21:29] revelation where you pray and God
[1:21:31] answers he comes on the
[1:21:33] scene this little boy though in our
[1:21:36] story he made an offering with the
[1:21:37] Loaves and and
[1:21:40] God my didn't God bless him didn't God
[1:21:44] bless that little boy way more isn't it
[1:21:45] wonderful to think that he chose a boy
[1:21:47] for the story too it wasn't an adult who
[1:21:50] was pushing a cart selling bread it was
[1:21:52] just a little boy that had some bread
[1:21:54] and some fish and God took that little
[1:21:56] boy and is it what Jesus said unless you
[1:21:58] come as a little child you'll in no wise
[1:22:01] see the kingdom if we come all puffed up
[1:22:03] in our our pride and say I know it all
[1:22:06] and I've had it all I've heard it all I
[1:22:08] got all the books I've read every
[1:22:09] message I've heard every you know if
[1:22:11] that's the attitude that we've got then
[1:22:14] we die right there brothers and
[1:22:18] sisters we've got to come as a little
[1:22:20] child trusting that he is going to lead
[1:22:22] us trusting that he will guide us yes
[1:22:25] because what we come to a place where we
[1:22:27] have enough food for ourselves we'll
[1:22:29] just word it that way because it's kind
[1:22:31] of our story I got enough I got a Subway
[1:22:33] Sub in my backpack I got enough food but
[1:22:35] you know what I only need one part of
[1:22:37] that Subway sub and I could share the
[1:22:39] rest of it with other people and save
[1:22:40] other people's lives think about this
[1:22:43] the word of God how much food sustenance
[1:22:45] is right here how many other people can
[1:22:48] we help with this word of God when we
[1:22:50] come to the place we recognize who we
[1:22:51] are amen when we are that mature
[1:22:55] Christian what we do is we pray for
[1:22:58] others yeah we don't scoff at the
[1:23:00] brother and scoff at the sister and say
[1:23:03] look at them and my they're just they've
[1:23:05] got this problem and I wish they would
[1:23:07] just get more mature no no we say that's
[1:23:11] God's grace in their
[1:23:13] life I heard brother Cadre Diggs preach
[1:23:15] a message at a church recently and and
[1:23:18] and a brother shared it with me and I
[1:23:20] just thought it was so good because
[1:23:21] really when we're going through a trial
[1:23:22] when a brother and sister's going
[1:23:24] through a trial that's God expressing
[1:23:25] his grace to them it's so true there's
[1:23:28] no way that we can say that it's any
[1:23:30] other way cuz God knows our natural
[1:23:32] circumstances amen yes and he allows us
[1:23:35] to go through trials he allows us to go
[1:23:37] through tribulation so that we can learn
[1:23:39] something from it amen not to be
[1:23:41] destroyed by it he's working on our
[1:23:44] character
[1:23:47] right in our scripture today in John
[1:23:50] chapter
[1:23:52] 6 when they were filled verse 12 he said
[1:23:55] unto his disciples gather up the
[1:23:57] fragments that remain that nothing be
[1:24:01] lost and I just can't help but think
[1:24:03] that's exactly just doveet tales with
[1:24:06] Malachi 3 if you'll turn there with me
[1:24:09] we'll we'll read that I'll just read
[1:24:11] these two verses here I just think it's
[1:24:13] so beautiful out of John 6 when they
[1:24:17] were filled he said unto his disciples
[1:24:20] gather the fragments that remain that
[1:24:21] nothing be lost therefore they gathered
[1:24:23] them together and filled 12 baskets with
[1:24:26] the fragments of The Barley loaves which
[1:24:28] remained over and
[1:24:31] above unto them that had eaten just such
[1:24:35] a wonderful
[1:24:37] thing you know in
[1:24:40] uh in
[1:24:44] Malachi chapter
[1:24:46] 3 verse
[1:24:50] 7 even from the days of your fathers you
[1:24:53] are gone away away from my
[1:24:56] ordinances and have not kept them and
[1:24:59] you know brothers and sisters we could
[1:25:00] say well you know the children of Israel
[1:25:02] comeing out of Egypt and all the stuff
[1:25:04] they did in the wilderness and they got
[1:25:05] so far out there they were worshiping
[1:25:07] golden calfs and they were way out there
[1:25:10] weren't they and they were truly but you
[1:25:12] know one word off puts us in that
[1:25:15] category one word off puts us in that
[1:25:18] category and one word off of what one
[1:25:20] word off of the instruction given to us
[1:25:22] by a Vindicated messenger for the the
[1:25:24] age in which we live we're reading about
[1:25:26] the seven Church ages one word off puts
[1:25:28] us in that category but he says he gives
[1:25:31] us the space return unto me and I will
[1:25:34] return unto you that's all we need to do
[1:25:36] sayeth the Lord of hosts but you say
[1:25:38] wherein shall we return will a will a
[1:25:41] man rob God yet ye have robbed me but ye
[1:25:45] say wherein have we robbed thee in
[1:25:47] tithes and offerings yeah come on he
[1:25:50] says ye are cursed with a curse for ye
[1:25:52] have robbed me even this whole
[1:25:55] nation bring ye all the tithes into the
[1:25:59] storehouse that there may be meat in
[1:26:02] mine house and prove me now herewith
[1:26:06] saith the Lord of hosts amen amen if I
[1:26:09] will not open the windows of heaven and
[1:26:12] pour you out a
[1:26:16] blessing pour you out of blessing that
[1:26:20] there shall not be room enough to
[1:26:22] receive it amen you know brothers and
[1:26:24] sisters I just want to make sure we're
[1:26:26] real clear on this I'm not preaching
[1:26:28] about tithes and offerings I'm preaching
[1:26:30] about Revelation by the
[1:26:32] spirit today I'm talking about getting
[1:26:34] Revelation by the spirit and and you
[1:26:36] know sometimes the way that we get
[1:26:38] Revelation by the spirit is is by taking
[1:26:40] it we we say Amen to us when it comes to
[1:26:43] us but what are we giving out right what
[1:26:46] are we doing to Garner that Revelation
[1:26:49] by the spirit because we just read two
[1:26:52] stories God knows exactly our our
[1:26:54] natural circumstances and when he comes
[1:26:56] our way and actually asks us for a favor
[1:26:59] are we willing to give it to him when he
[1:27:01] comes by our way and asks us for a favor
[1:27:03] how does he do it how does he do it does
[1:27:07] he call us on the phone does he shoot us
[1:27:08] a text does he send us an email usually
[1:27:13] it's a brother or a sister right usually
[1:27:17] it's another human being in the world
[1:27:19] that's saying I got this thing can you
[1:27:22] help me right can you just give me a
[1:27:24] hand for a second brothers and sisters I
[1:27:26] want to say this loud and clear when
[1:27:29] that happens try God at it prove him on
[1:27:34] it don't worry about money I'm not
[1:27:36] talking about money I'm saying time and
[1:27:38] effort and prayers supplications for our
[1:27:41] brothers and our sisters when people
[1:27:43] need help are we willing to give it to
[1:27:45] them because sometimes we entertain
[1:27:48] Angels unawares sometimes it's a
[1:27:51] complete stranger but when how much more
[1:27:53] when we have a brother and sister who
[1:27:55] has a need amen
[1:27:58] my and that verse 11 I think is such a
[1:28:01] an amazing one and it's so important to
[1:28:04] remember this brothers and sisters
[1:28:06] because when we have a need in our
[1:28:08] families when we have a need in our
[1:28:10] marriage when we have a need in our
[1:28:13] children's lives who are sick when we
[1:28:15] have a husband that has to go to the ER
[1:28:18] my goodness by an ambulance we can read
[1:28:22] this verse here I will and I will rebuke
[1:28:25] the Devourer for whose sake s yeah and
[1:28:29] he shall not destroy the fruits of your
[1:28:32] ground neither shall your Vine cast her
[1:28:35] fruit before the time in the field
[1:28:37] sayeth the Lord of
[1:28:38] hosts and All Nations shall call you
[1:28:42] blessed for ye shall be a delightsome
[1:28:44] land saith the Lord of hosts amen I just
[1:28:48] can't help but think how many doctors
[1:28:50] would fit that description All
[1:28:53] Nations how many nurses that have had to
[1:28:55] deal with Believers people getting
[1:28:58] prayed for by Believers how many doctors
[1:29:00] and nurses in the medical profession
[1:29:02] would just say wow there's something
[1:29:04] different about this person how come do
[1:29:06] they continually get sick so sick that
[1:29:08] we think they're going to die and then
[1:29:10] suddenly they just raise back up again
[1:29:12] how does that work it doesn't happen in
[1:29:15] other people's lives but yet somehow it
[1:29:17] does in these people's lives it's
[1:29:19] because they're a delightsome land it's
[1:29:22] because they other people can see it and
[1:29:25] I think it's beautiful because God makes
[1:29:27] sure that the other people around will
[1:29:29] bear witness of his life of his work of
[1:29:32] his answered prayers in the lives of
[1:29:34] Believers amen you know God he he
[1:29:37] reveals himself I think it was just such
[1:29:40] a a strong little thing that I was
[1:29:41] getting when I was studying this God
[1:29:43] reveals himself sometimes we want to
[1:29:45] reveal God don't we we want to have a
[1:29:47] prayer line and we want to start praying
[1:29:49] for someone we want to put hands on them
[1:29:51] and start jumping up and down and
[1:29:52] screaming at the top of our lungs to see
[1:29:54] God come on the scene but sometimes we
[1:29:57] just need to speak the word amen amen
[1:30:00] and say God said that he would do this
[1:30:02] and and I believe it with all my heart
[1:30:04] but I'm just going to let him do it God
[1:30:06] reveals himself brothers and sisters by
[1:30:09] by the spirit in 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[1:30:11] he says but in in verse 9 he says but as
[1:30:14] it is written I have not seen nor ear
[1:30:16] heard neither has it entered into the
[1:30:18] heart of a man which things which things
[1:30:20] God hath prepared for them that love him
[1:30:22] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:30:27] his
[1:30:28] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:30:32] things yay the Deep things of God Amen
[1:30:35] it's just I think such a beautiful
[1:30:37] thought we we don't need to really worry
[1:30:41] too much we don't need to really try too
[1:30:43] much we just need to trust a whole lot
[1:30:46] amen that's what we need to do and and
[1:30:49] really when we trust then we can obey we
[1:30:52] know that song trust and Obey for
[1:30:54] there's no other way right many times
[1:30:56] people will say well that's a pretty
[1:30:58] simple equation and it can sound that
[1:31:00] way but we're not supposed to understand
[1:31:02] it we talked about the beginning of the
[1:31:04] service today help me understand it we
[1:31:07] don't need to understand it we just need
[1:31:08] to believe it am that's the commission
[1:31:11] isn't it when the angel of the Lord met
[1:31:13] the messenger to this age what did he
[1:31:15] say to him if you can get the people to
[1:31:18] understand your prayers yeah if you can
[1:31:21] get the people to understand the message
[1:31:22] of the hour if you can get the people to
[1:31:24] understand the quotes if you can get
[1:31:25] people to understand the conduct order
[1:31:26] and Doctrine oh my then no devil will be
[1:31:29] able to stand in the way of your prayer
[1:31:30] no he said if you can get the people to
[1:31:33] believe that's why his theme song was
[1:31:35] only
[1:31:38] believe you cannot educate yourself into
[1:31:44] revelation God reveals
[1:31:48] himself I think it's so wonderful
[1:31:50] because there's a people that will be
[1:31:51] ever learning but never able to come to
[1:31:54] the knowledge of the
[1:31:56] truth in this
[1:31:58] age we need to be careful and allow the
[1:32:02] spirit to reveal it to us but it only
[1:32:05] comes by prayer brothers and sisters it
[1:32:06] only comes by relationship it only comes
[1:32:09] by having the intimacy that he's looking
[1:32:13] for and that only comes by sacrifice
[1:32:16] only comes by taking the loaves out of
[1:32:18] our own backpack and saying it's all I
[1:32:20] got how can I help what can I do amen
[1:32:24] your body Lord what can I do for my
[1:32:26] brothers and sisters and I'm not trying
[1:32:29] to pull on anything to to to anyone all
[1:32:32] I'm saying is God knows our situations
[1:32:34] brothers and sisters if we want to see
[1:32:36] blessings from God then be willing to
[1:32:38] take him at his word just be willing to
[1:32:40] trust him and see if he won't pour out a
[1:32:43] blessing upon you that you can't even
[1:32:44] contain and and and don't worry about
[1:32:46] financial blessing that will all follow
[1:32:48] I would say more than anything worry
[1:32:51] about the Revelation by the spirit that
[1:32:53] I'm saved that I know that I know I know
[1:32:56] if I were to
[1:32:58] die I don't have to be afraid yeah if
[1:33:01] death comes knocking at my door I can
[1:33:03] say
[1:33:04] hey if it's his will then have at her
[1:33:08] because when you're done doing what
[1:33:09] you're going to do only because he gave
[1:33:11] you permission to I'm going to be with
[1:33:13] him quicker than you can blink your
[1:33:16] eye to be able to have that level of
[1:33:19] confidence to know that we're able to
[1:33:21] hold the message of the hour the truth
[1:33:23] about Jesus Christ in the age in which
[1:33:25] we live before our families so that our
[1:33:28] children can have salvation the devour
[1:33:31] wants to devour our children the
[1:33:33] Devourer wants to keep us so busy that
[1:33:36] we cannot hold the word of God before
[1:33:39] our children and you know brothers and
[1:33:40] sisters sometimes we can get so busy not
[1:33:42] with worldly things we can get so busy
[1:33:44] with religion yeah with doing things for
[1:33:48] God Amen that our families suffer
[1:33:52] there's a balance you got to have
[1:33:54] Revelation by the spirit to know that
[1:33:56] your family is going to have that
[1:33:58] rooting and grounding that
[1:34:00] rudimentary understanding of the message
[1:34:02] of the
[1:34:03] hour amen it's a
[1:34:07] paradox isn't it something that's
[1:34:10] unbelievable but absolutely true
[1:34:13] something that's just so far out there
[1:34:15] that you just can't even really
[1:34:16] comprehend it but it's absolutely true
[1:34:18] yeah for there to be predestinated
[1:34:21] elected Sons and Daughters of God is is
[1:34:23] a
[1:34:25] paradox to have someone go brother Bram
[1:34:28] says it from being a cucker to being a
[1:34:31] seed of wheat it's a paradox to have a
[1:34:35] sinner which is the greatest Miracle of
[1:34:37] all brothers and sisters healings and
[1:34:39] and Revelations and all the different
[1:34:41] things that can happen manifestations
[1:34:43] all of the great wonders of miracles
[1:34:45] signs and wonders all of that is one
[1:34:47] thing but to have a sinner be able to
[1:34:49] come to the recognition that they too
[1:34:52] are saved by grace and to have a sinner
[1:34:55] go from being a sinner to becoming a
[1:34:57] saint to recognizing that they have a
[1:34:58] position in the economy of God that's
[1:35:00] the greatest Miracle of all but that's
[1:35:03] the Revelation that we're talking about
[1:35:04] today brothers and sisters the the the
[1:35:06] Revelation the importance of Revelation
[1:35:08] about who we are who we truly are
[1:35:10] because when we realize what we are and
[1:35:13] I'm going to say it this way the son of
[1:35:15] man Ministry because we're not living
[1:35:18] our lives for ourselves are we if we're
[1:35:20] just living our lives for ourselves then
[1:35:22] we're just like everyone else in the
[1:35:23] world but if we're living our lives for
[1:35:25] everyone else brother bradam said
[1:35:26] eternal life is
[1:35:29] what it's living for
[1:35:31] others when the church recognizes what
[1:35:34] it is I'll say it this way the son of
[1:35:36] man in flesh again if you've got his
[1:35:38] spirit inside of you who are
[1:35:40] you right people say now that's getting
[1:35:43] out there oh my now we going to pick up
[1:35:45] stones and we're going to Stone you
[1:35:46] because you're going to make yourself
[1:35:47] God hey he said it not me amen but it's
[1:35:52] the same thing now you're getting
[1:35:53] fanatical but we know it I I'll stand
[1:35:56] behind it I'll say it even from the
[1:35:57] pulpit in the way in which you call
[1:36:00] heresy how many people would raise their
[1:36:01] hand and say that's how I worship God
[1:36:03] according to the message of the hour the
[1:36:05] son of man Ministry the son of man in
[1:36:07] flesh once again don't look at signs and
[1:36:10] wonders to identify whether Jesus Christ
[1:36:12] is in your flesh brothers and sisters
[1:36:14] look at your ability to say hey do I
[1:36:16] believe the message of the hour or
[1:36:19] not not do I understand
[1:36:21] it so find
[1:36:24] yeah razor sharp brother bradam said
[1:36:27] razor
[1:36:29] thin people understand it and people
[1:36:32] believe it which one are you I say Lord
[1:36:35] help me there's things that I want to
[1:36:38] understand but you know by and by I'm
[1:36:40] sure he'll let us
[1:36:42] know Paradox 1964 brother bradam said
[1:36:45] who had the fruit of the spirit
[1:36:48] Jesus he said search the
[1:36:51] scriptures you think they in them you
[1:36:54] think you have eternal life but they
[1:36:58] testify of me and I want to say today
[1:37:01] brothers and sisters they testify of you
[1:37:04] they testify of
[1:37:06] us they tell you who I
[1:37:10] am he never did come out and say who he
[1:37:14] was this is Brother Bram talking about
[1:37:18] Eat My Flesh and drink my blood the
[1:37:23] people were like like wow he's a
[1:37:25] vampire this guy's crazy this guy is we
[1:37:28] knew that he was off his rocker we knew
[1:37:31] that he's simply the son of a carpenter
[1:37:34] he's a scoundrel he's probably an
[1:37:36] illegitimate child we knew all about
[1:37:39] this guy before but now here he is in
[1:37:42] our church talking this way are you
[1:37:45] serious we better call the deacons and
[1:37:47] get him out of here because he's just
[1:37:49] going a little bit far right but here he
[1:37:51] is saying they they tell you who I am he
[1:37:54] never did come out and tell tell them he
[1:37:57] never did come out and say who he was
[1:37:59] did he that's right he never did that
[1:38:02] the people were able to identify that he
[1:38:06] didn't tell them and why he got his
[1:38:08] congregation he he said unless you eat
[1:38:10] the Flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:38:11] his blood as I said last night you have
[1:38:14] no life why my that congregation said
[1:38:17] that guy is
[1:38:19] crazy what would doctors and science be
[1:38:23] careful about doctors and science
[1:38:25] brothers and
[1:38:26] sisters God uses them but that's not
[1:38:29] where all of our faith lies I would say
[1:38:32] only a little tiny bit of our faith lies
[1:38:34] there all of our faith is weighted in
[1:38:37] Christ amen all of our weight why my
[1:38:41] that congregation said that guy is crazy
[1:38:43] what what with doctors in science well
[1:38:45] that man trying to make cannibals he
[1:38:48] never explained it either did he he just
[1:38:51] said it and why did he do it because
[1:38:53] there there was an importance of
[1:38:55] Revelation that had to manifest in the
[1:38:57] lives of the people that really believed
[1:39:00] not just
[1:39:02] understood oh my some of those people
[1:39:04] some of those 70 you could only imagine
[1:39:06] maybe they were Scholars maybe they
[1:39:08] understood the the word maybe they were
[1:39:10] studying the Old Testament Scrolls maybe
[1:39:13] they were looking at it to see the
[1:39:15] identification Isaiah said behold what a
[1:39:18] virgin shall conceive and maybe they
[1:39:20] were scratching their heads and saying
[1:39:21] well maybe she was a virgin and maybe
[1:39:23] she did conceive and maybe this is the
[1:39:26] one but boy when you start going this
[1:39:28] far now you're going crazy now now it's
[1:39:31] just too far now you're asking us to
[1:39:32] just actually go beyond what we
[1:39:35] understand and just believe by
[1:39:36] Revelation
[1:39:38] right why my my that congregation said
[1:39:41] that guy's crazy what doctors in science
[1:39:43] well well that man trying to make
[1:39:45] cannibals he never explained it he it
[1:39:47] was time for them to turn him down
[1:39:53] goes with what we're talking about on
[1:39:55] Wednesday There's a time where the seed
[1:39:59] will manifest what life is in it and you
[1:40:02] know there ain't nobody that's going to
[1:40:03] be able to hide that seed that's inside
[1:40:05] of them the anointing that's on this
[1:40:08] earth right now you look around you
[1:40:10] don't have to look very far and you can
[1:40:11] see all manner of seeds that are
[1:40:14] actually
[1:40:15] manifesting and I just can't help but
[1:40:17] think about it you know how we look at
[1:40:19] the the the ones who are ruling and
[1:40:21] governing in in in World
[1:40:24] governments they were
[1:40:27] participants in many times back in the
[1:40:30] 50s and the 60s when all of the things
[1:40:33] were starting to manifest when the
[1:40:34] prophet was out ministering the
[1:40:36] anointing was on Earth ministering the
[1:40:38] son of man Ministry once again the first
[1:40:40] and second polls were going on there was
[1:40:42] also a a Ministry of death through Satan
[1:40:46] and how incredible the music industry
[1:40:49] took off and how incredible it was that
[1:40:52] the drug industry took off and how many
[1:40:54] people took part in both of those and a
[1:40:56] lot of those people today are ruling in
[1:41:00] governments they were a part of that
[1:41:02] movement on the I would say the evil
[1:41:06] side but now they're the rulers now
[1:41:09] they're heads of state maybe even
[1:41:12] presidents Prime Ministers all around
[1:41:15] the world our leaders
[1:41:19] why brother bam goes on to say then he
[1:41:21] had a bunch of preachers hanging around
[1:41:23] him borderline
[1:41:26] Believers he said well what are you
[1:41:29] going to say when you see me upad up
[1:41:32] ascend from where I come from come
[1:41:36] from well we've seen the Cradle you were
[1:41:38] born in the city you were born in we
[1:41:42] fished with you we're here on the
[1:41:45] Hills you know it's interesting I'm sure
[1:41:48] we all know about it there's all these
[1:41:50] stories that are being told about the
[1:41:52] message of the hour in Arizona if you
[1:41:55] don't know there's
[1:41:57] uh columnists that are doing stories
[1:42:00] trying to do what they call an expose
[1:42:03] trying to tell all about the cult of the
[1:42:05] message of the hour in Arizona and what
[1:42:08] they're doing is they're they're taking
[1:42:09] people's stories from their perspectives
[1:42:12] and and they're implementing them into
[1:42:14] the papers and to be honest with you I
[1:42:16] haven't read them any of them I've only
[1:42:18] seen the headlines and I heard this was
[1:42:19] going to happen and now it's manifesting
[1:42:21] and I'm just looking at I know a couple
[1:42:24] of the names I've I've seen but it's
[1:42:26] happening and then they're trying to
[1:42:27] slander this message they're trying to
[1:42:29] pick up stones and and throw rocks at
[1:42:31] the son of man Ministry and they can do
[1:42:33] whatever they want to but what what what
[1:42:35] I want to say is really what they're
[1:42:38] doing is is unfortunately contending
[1:42:41] with people that learned the message of
[1:42:43] the
[1:42:44] hour these people that learned the
[1:42:46] message of the hour from being close to
[1:42:49] the prophet they did not actually go on
[1:42:52] to the true baptis ISM of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:54] because if they did they would not have
[1:42:55] behaved the way they did in manners that
[1:42:59] it would actually just destroy people's
[1:43:01] lives just destroy people's hearts
[1:43:03] destroy people's families all of the
[1:43:06] things that come out of those stories
[1:43:09] people had a head knowledge of the
[1:43:11] message of the hour they had a head
[1:43:13] knowledge of who the prophet of God was
[1:43:15] but they never got it all the way down
[1:43:17] to the heart and we know we've heard
[1:43:18] that said that's the longest journey
[1:43:19] that 16 in from the head down into the
[1:43:21] heart for this m message to take for the
[1:43:24] revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:43:26] go but I just can't help but think there
[1:43:28] were people that were just like this the
[1:43:30] the the preachers right come in well
[1:43:32] we've seen you in the Cradle you were
[1:43:34] you were born in we we've seen the city
[1:43:36] you're you're born in we fish with you
[1:43:38] out here in the Hills we we we walked
[1:43:40] with you we talked with you you you come
[1:43:43] from oh my now we know you're
[1:43:45] crazy but real genuine Faith don't
[1:43:51] move doesn't matter how many news
[1:43:53] articles they come up with it doesn't
[1:43:55] matter how many Slanders they come out
[1:43:56] with it doesn't matter how many times
[1:43:58] people say anybody that follows the
[1:44:00] teachings of William Mariam brandham is
[1:44:02] a part of a cult doesn't matter because
[1:44:04] I never met William Mariam brandham I
[1:44:06] met Jesus
[1:44:09] Christ amen that was the purpose of him
[1:44:13] was to introduce the second coming of
[1:44:15] Jesus Christ now I want to ask this
[1:44:18] question brothers and sisters did he
[1:44:20] accomplish that amen
[1:44:23] yeah did he introduce the second coming
[1:44:26] of Jesus Christ or are we still looking
[1:44:29] for it is it out there
[1:44:32] somewhere we know we've heard it said
[1:44:34] many times we're not looking for the
[1:44:35] coming we're looking for the
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] going the real genuine Faith don't move
[1:44:43] them disciples couldn't explain it but
[1:44:45] they
[1:44:46] knowed there it
[1:44:49] was it has to be something that God
[1:44:52] planted
[1:44:53] had to be his thoughts before the
[1:44:56] foundation of the world by when he
[1:45:00] planted when he planned sorry the whole
[1:45:03] redeemed and we know we've read this
[1:45:05] Ephesians 1 1:5 he planned the whole
[1:45:10] thing before the foundation of the world
[1:45:12] his thoughts and this is the attributes
[1:45:15] of his thoughts he doesn't Force us he
[1:45:19] made us free moral agents just like Adam
[1:45:22] and Eve in the guard
[1:45:23] he gave them the choice we have the
[1:45:25] choice we can actually follow the
[1:45:29] message of the hour or not we can put
[1:45:32] our own spin on it and say hey I've got
[1:45:34] a tradition in my family that does it
[1:45:37] this way and God will say that's okay go
[1:45:41] ahead we can say oh my pastor when I
[1:45:43] grew up we did it that way and the only
[1:45:46] way that's going to be right is that way
[1:45:48] is it does that leave any room for
[1:45:50] Revelation by the spirit amen
[1:45:54] you know brother bradam he even said he
[1:45:57] he even reprimanded bradam
[1:46:00] Tabernacle he said no this isn't right
[1:46:04] either the only thing that's right is
[1:46:06] Christ amen there's a way that seeth
[1:46:09] right unto a man right oh my but it can
[1:46:13] be death
[1:46:16] right he planned the whole thing before
[1:46:20] the foundation of the world we don't
[1:46:21] have to be afraid of predestin a we
[1:46:23] don't have to be afraid of Revelation by
[1:46:25] the spirit I would say be afraid of not
[1:46:29] getting Revelation by the spirit I would
[1:46:31] say be afraid of not having time in
[1:46:33] prayer be afraid of not giving freely of
[1:46:37] yourself because of eternal life living
[1:46:40] for others be afraid of that brothers
[1:46:42] and sisters it takes Revelation by the
[1:46:44] spirit to be able to do it though amen
[1:46:47] it sounds like I'm just pulling for
[1:46:48] money or something but I'm not I'm I'm
[1:46:50] just trying to encourage us to maybe go
[1:46:52] a little farther maybe look at it just a
[1:46:54] little bit differently maybe not just be
[1:46:56] stuck in our ways so so far so rigid
[1:46:59] that this is as far as I'll go and I'll
[1:47:00] only do it this way because if that's
[1:47:02] what happens we're going to be just like
[1:47:04] those preachers that brother Bram just
[1:47:06] described and before long we're going to
[1:47:08] have a head knowledge and someone will
[1:47:09] be writing an article about us that's
[1:47:12] right but you know if we're willing to
[1:47:14] take him at his word he said he will
[1:47:16] rebuke the devour for our sakes when the
[1:47:20] Devil comes around and tries to Rattle
[1:47:22] our marriage we can say no but Lord
[1:47:24] don't you remember when he comes around
[1:47:27] and tries to give a box of rattlesnakes
[1:47:29] to our children we can say no no that's
[1:47:33] not what your word says your word says
[1:47:35] that you will rebuke the Devourer for
[1:47:38] our sakes amen I just think it's
[1:47:41] beautiful how the Lord used Peter and
[1:47:43] how he used him in the examples the
[1:47:45] natural examples in Peter's life isn't
[1:47:47] it wonderful how many there are there's
[1:47:49] so many I just have a few here you know
[1:47:52] you know in Matthew chapter
[1:47:54] 14 while while
[1:47:57] Peter and the disciples they were in the
[1:48:00] ship we know the story very well the
[1:48:03] storm came up and they didn't know what
[1:48:05] to do they Jesus told them just go go to
[1:48:08] the other side we had a tremendous
[1:48:10] meeting and I'm I'm done with everyone
[1:48:12] he sent the multitudes away he sent the
[1:48:14] disciples away he needed to just
[1:48:16] recharge his batteries for a bit and
[1:48:19] what happened well they were out on the
[1:48:22] middle of the lake we know that brother
[1:48:23] Brandon brings the illustration very
[1:48:24] well he says now the Devils they said
[1:48:26] now we got you and they toss the tip
[1:48:28] ship around like a bottle stopper and
[1:48:31] and we know that they saw Jesus walking
[1:48:34] on the water another example a natural
[1:48:37] experience we say that that it's very
[1:48:40] Supernatural because he went out walked
[1:48:41] on the water but what I'm saying is is
[1:48:43] God used the natural environment around
[1:48:45] them right he made a storm they were in
[1:48:47] the boat he let them see him they
[1:48:50] thought he was a spirit but there came a
[1:48:53] point where Peter spoke something to him
[1:48:56] nobody else said it but this Peter
[1:48:59] something about this Peter right he said
[1:49:01] what did he say in verse 28 of of
[1:49:03] Matthew chapter 14 and Peter answered
[1:49:05] him and said Lord if it be thou bid me
[1:49:08] to come unto thee on the
[1:49:12] water and we know full well what
[1:49:14] happened what happened for those who
[1:49:16] don't remember Peter walked on the
[1:49:20] water amen Jesus walked on the the water
[1:49:23] but so did
[1:49:24] Peter why did he do it because he said
[1:49:29] Lord I believe yeah in his heart he
[1:49:33] believed and we know that when he
[1:49:35] stopped
[1:49:37] believing and got caught up in the
[1:49:39] natural circumstances look at these
[1:49:40] waves how deep is this water oh my the
[1:49:42] wind's blowing I'm getting rain in my
[1:49:44] face oh no what's going to happen what
[1:49:46] happened he started to sink he got
[1:49:48] caught up too caught up looking at the
[1:49:50] natural trying to understand it don't
[1:49:52] try to understand God just trust him and
[1:49:55] say bid bid me Lord to come unto thee
[1:50:00] amen yes and he'll take you we know
[1:50:03] another one was Mount Transfiguration
[1:50:05] let's turn there over to Matthew chapter
[1:50:06] 17 while we still have a little bit of
[1:50:09] time Matthew chapter 17 are we okay this
[1:50:13] morning Matthew chapter
[1:50:16] 17 I just think it's so wonderful to to
[1:50:19] know that we have the ability and and
[1:50:21] not only the ability brothers and
[1:50:23] sisters we have the requirement amen
[1:50:25] yeah to get this level of revelation
[1:50:27] we're talking about it's not an option
[1:50:29] we have got to come there and and you
[1:50:31] know some people will have such great
[1:50:33] faith in Revelation they'll they'll be
[1:50:35] able to move mountains with their faith
[1:50:36] and other people they'll just have
[1:50:38] simple faith and they'll say I believe
[1:50:41] and what more is great which one is
[1:50:42] greater I would say neither just being
[1:50:45] able to believe is it yeah that's all it
[1:50:49] is that's the requirement
[1:50:53] Matthew 17:1 after 6 days Jesus taketh
[1:50:58] Peter James and John uh his brother and
[1:51:01] bringeth them up into a high mountain
[1:51:03] apart and he was transfigured before
[1:51:05] them and his face did shine as the sun
[1:51:07] and his reignment was white as the light
[1:51:10] and behold there appeared unto them
[1:51:12] Moses and Elias talking with him I just
[1:51:16] think this is such an amazing story
[1:51:19] could you imagine that they recog ized
[1:51:22] him how did they
[1:51:24] know maybe he said their names we don't
[1:51:26] know verse four then answered Peter and
[1:51:29] said unto Jesus Lord oh lord it's good
[1:51:32] for us to be here if thou Wilt let us
[1:51:35] let us make here three Tabernacles one
[1:51:36] for thee and one for Moses and one for
[1:51:39] Elias my the trinitarian doctrine
[1:51:42] started right
[1:51:44] there something was happening wasn't it
[1:51:48] yeah he was going natural again he was
[1:51:51] trying to recognize it by his own
[1:51:53] understanding he was he was not leaning
[1:51:55] unto the Lord he was leaning unto his
[1:51:57] own oh my I can I can see with my eyes
[1:52:00] there's there's there's Moses and I can
[1:52:01] see with my eyes there's Elias and I can
[1:52:04] can see with my eyes there's Jesus and
[1:52:06] and it's this heavenly moment we need to
[1:52:08] capture it now we need to to contain it
[1:52:11] in a book that's where brother Bram
[1:52:13] talks about it that's where the spirit
[1:52:15] of God departs and it was what while he
[1:52:18] yet spake these words Behold a bright
[1:52:21] Cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[1:52:23] voice out of the cloud which said this
[1:52:25] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:52:28] pleased hear ye him and I just can't
[1:52:31] help but think that the same exact voice
[1:52:34] is what came and opened those seals in
[1:52:36] Jeffersonville the same exact voice is
[1:52:39] what the Bride of Jesus Christ hears
[1:52:41] when she listens to those seals that
[1:52:43] were open in Jeffersonville it wasn't
[1:52:45] William Mary and bradam that open any
[1:52:46] seal it was the angel of the Lord that
[1:52:49] met him amen from the presence of
[1:52:51] almighty God with a message to teach him
[1:52:54] what to
[1:52:56] say Behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:52:59] which said this is my beloved Son in
[1:53:01] whom I am well pleased hear ye him and
[1:53:05] when the disciples heard it heard it
[1:53:07] they fell on their face and were sore
[1:53:08] afraid but what happened Again Naturally
[1:53:12] it goes from spiritual correction to
[1:53:14] Natural Jesus understanding where they
[1:53:16] were and Jesus came and he touched them
[1:53:19] and said arise be not afraid but just
[1:53:22] believe amen just believe Don't Be
[1:53:24] Afraid don't worry God knows exactly
[1:53:28] what we need he knows our situations he
[1:53:30] knows our concerns he knows our
[1:53:32] petitions we've just got to be willing
[1:53:34] to trust him we got to be willing to
[1:53:36] give him the
[1:53:38] time I think it's so beautiful we can
[1:53:41] look at uh Lord willing I'll probably
[1:53:44] get into it a little bit later but
[1:53:46] brother bradam talks about the in the
[1:53:47] message the trial in 1964 I don't have
[1:53:49] the quote here so don't worry just gonna
[1:53:53] talk a little bit about it he talks
[1:53:54] about different types of people in that
[1:53:56] message he talks about the witness of
[1:53:58] something that happened he talks about
[1:53:59] the witness the the one who actually
[1:54:02] made it happen he talks about the one
[1:54:03] who is actually on on
[1:54:05] trial he talks about the one who was
[1:54:08] just a a nonbeliever talks about the one
[1:54:11] who's a make believer talks about all
[1:54:12] the different types of people that are
[1:54:14] at the trial and and I just can't help
[1:54:16] but think when I listen to that message
[1:54:18] because I do a fair bit I just love it
[1:54:20] so much you know we're on trial right
[1:54:23] now because the Devil Is Right There
[1:54:26] Before the Throne accusing the Brethren
[1:54:29] day and night he doesn't rest he is
[1:54:31] continually trying to put something in
[1:54:33] our path so that he can accuse us
[1:54:35] properly according to the word but all
[1:54:37] we've got to do is believe that he has
[1:54:39] paid the price he's already done it when
[1:54:42] he bowed his head on the cross and gave
[1:54:44] up The Ghost and said it is finished
[1:54:47] what was he talking about brothers and
[1:54:48] sisters his life was not just finished
[1:54:51] he was saying that I have paid the price
[1:54:53] according to the word I am the kinsman
[1:54:55] redeemer and the cost that was required
[1:54:58] is completely met amen it's
[1:55:01] finished there's no more sin that can be
[1:55:04] held against them against them to their
[1:55:07] charge you know Peter another natural
[1:55:09] circumstance I'm not going to get
[1:55:11] through this all I'm not going to try
[1:55:12] and hold us here late today but Peter
[1:55:14] another natural circumstance was in Mark
[1:55:17] 8 you know Jesus was explaining to the
[1:55:20] disciples it was getting later in his
[1:55:22] ministry it it was probably I don't know
[1:55:25] maybe they had supper together and just
[1:55:28] while they were there fellowshipping in
[1:55:30] verse 31 for the sake of time in Mark
[1:55:33] chapter 8 and he began to teach them
[1:55:35] Jesus began to teach them that the son
[1:55:37] of man must suffer many things and be
[1:55:40] rejected of the elders and of the chief
[1:55:43] priests and the scribes and be killed
[1:55:45] and after three days rise again he he
[1:55:48] their friend was telling them this is
[1:55:50] going to happen to him and and and how
[1:55:52] could that possibly be we know that
[1:55:54] Peter was a man of action yeah isn't it
[1:55:57] interesting The Man of Action I can only
[1:56:00] imagine he would be what we would
[1:56:01] classify as the the triple A+ type of
[1:56:04] personality and you know what they say
[1:56:06] if you want to get something done if
[1:56:08] you've got something you need to get
[1:56:09] done find someone busy and get them to
[1:56:12] do the job because they know how to get
[1:56:13] stuff done amen but you can try and hand
[1:56:16] a broom to someone who's lazy and
[1:56:17] they'll look at it and say what's
[1:56:20] that right but here we have Peter that
[1:56:24] guy who is the A+ personality that wants
[1:56:26] to get stuff done and he's always on
[1:56:29] guard for his brother his Lord and verse
[1:56:31] 32 and he spake that saying openly and
[1:56:35] Peter took him and began to rebuke him
[1:56:37] not on my watch ain't nobody going to
[1:56:39] kill you I see you as my Lord You're the
[1:56:41] Savior you're the one that everyone's
[1:56:43] been looking for and I can see you man
[1:56:45] you're not going to get hurt but what
[1:56:47] did Jesus say but when he had turned
[1:56:49] about and looked on his disciples he
[1:56:51] rebuked Peter
[1:56:53] saying get thee behind me
[1:56:57] Satan for thou savest not the things
[1:57:01] that be of God but the things that be of
[1:57:04] man yes why did he do
[1:57:08] that why did he actually say that to
[1:57:11] Peter I was wondering this for a long
[1:57:13] long time and I believe the Lord just
[1:57:15] gave me an answer for it and I'm going
[1:57:17] to bring it it's not anything
[1:57:18] complicated why did he say that because
[1:57:20] he had the wrong revelation
[1:57:23] right exactly he didn't have the right
[1:57:25] Revelation the right Revelation was what
[1:57:27] Jesus Christ was telling them the word
[1:57:29] made flesh was explaining the right
[1:57:33] Revelation but he had his own natural
[1:57:35] Revelation no I'm going to be a defender
[1:57:37] of this Faith to the death I'm going to
[1:57:40] prevent you from being killed nobody's
[1:57:42] going to come upon you and fall upon you
[1:57:45] no way it ain't happening sometimes I
[1:57:47] think as as Believers of this message we
[1:57:50] can get so defensive about it we can
[1:57:52] actually start to hurt our brothers and
[1:57:54] our sisters we need to back off and just
[1:57:56] allow the Lord to have his way have
[1:57:59] Revelation if we can do anything for a
[1:58:02] brother or a sister pray that they would
[1:58:04] get Revelation especially if we're the
[1:58:07] the the mighty mature message Believers
[1:58:10] been in the message for
[1:58:12] decades oh my why don't those people
[1:58:15] behave the way that I do if that's how
[1:58:17] we are are we on our knees are we
[1:58:19] getting that that that that muscular
[1:58:21] identific ification that brother bradam
[1:58:23] talked about how the true sign of a man
[1:58:25] is the bags in his knees from going in
[1:58:28] prayer for his brothers and his sisters
[1:58:30] are we busy doing that or are we just
[1:58:31] busy beating our chest
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:35] amen when he turned about and looked on
[1:58:37] his disciples he rebuked Peter saying
[1:58:40] get the behind me
[1:58:42] Satan why here we have his
[1:58:46] disciple the one that the Catholic
[1:58:48] church is saying they built the church
[1:58:50] on this is what the church is built on
[1:58:53] this guy he had Satan talking through
[1:58:55] him wow makes me wonder brothers and
[1:58:58] sisters how many times have we got the
[1:59:00] devil talking through US amen this is
[1:59:02] one of the 12 one of the
[1:59:04] Apostles but you know what's Wild is he
[1:59:07] is just like you you are just like him
[1:59:11] every one of us has to go into that
[1:59:13] upper room and get that baptism of the
[1:59:15] Holy Ghost that's our only hope to be
[1:59:18] sealed amen that's the formula that's
[1:59:21] the greatest Revelation that we're ever
[1:59:23] going to get is that if I get repent and
[1:59:26] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:59:28] Jesus Christ for the remission of my
[1:59:30] sins some people would say well I've
[1:59:32] never sinned I'm a good
[1:59:34] person you weren't born right
[1:59:38] unfortunately before you were ever
[1:59:40] expressed in this world it was wrong
[1:59:42] amen that's just the way God made it and
[1:59:44] he made it that way because Adam and Eve
[1:59:46] chose that way amen it's such a
[1:59:49] beautiful thought isn't it to recognize
[1:59:51] through the revelation of the message of
[1:59:53] the hour that there was a time where
[1:59:56] births they were supposed to go forth
[1:59:59] and and and multiply through the spoken
[2:00:01] word amen not through a sexual
[2:00:04] experience amen yeah my we could go a
[2:00:07] long ways down that road but I'm not
[2:00:09] going to today but I'll say it this way
[2:00:11] maybe for someone that's listening or
[2:00:13] someone that's never heard it before
[2:00:14] what really happened in the Garden of
[2:00:17] Eden the entire fall of mankind is
[2:00:20] because of fruit
[2:00:23] yeah come on right right Peter he said
[2:00:27] those words to Jesus he tried to correct
[2:00:30] Jesus because he had the wrong
[2:00:33] Revelation all he had to do was listen
[2:00:36] and believe amen amen if he listened and
[2:00:40] believed do you ever think it's an
[2:00:42] accident that God gave us two ears and
[2:00:43] one
[2:00:44] mouth if he listened and just believed
[2:00:48] he would have had the right
[2:00:50] Revelation and another one Jesus told
[2:00:54] them this would happen too we know this
[2:00:55] all too well I better call the musicians
[2:00:58] but we know this one all too well Peter
[2:01:01] denied him three times didn't he right
[2:01:03] but Jesus told him he would and can you
[2:01:06] imagine what it must have been like for
[2:01:07] this guy he's had a a multitude uh these
[2:01:11] are the documented cases too by the way
[2:01:14] that are in the word how many happened
[2:01:16] that weren't documented I have to wonder
[2:01:19] how many things did Jesus say that
[2:01:21] actually came to pass in Peter's life in
[2:01:23] in the disciples lives in order for them
[2:01:25] to say wow this is truly the son of man
[2:01:27] this truly is way more than any man
[2:01:30] we've ever met in our lives Peter had
[2:01:32] Den item three times exactly how Jesus
[2:01:35] told him amen before the crows you
[2:01:39] will deny me three
[2:01:41] times and and we know that he told them
[2:01:44] that everyone's going to leave me
[2:01:45] everyone's going to abandon me Peter's
[2:01:47] like not me man I'm going to die for you
[2:01:50] and and here we have him warming himself
[2:01:52] by a fire while Jesus is getting punched
[2:01:54] in the face by the most religious
[2:01:57] preachers yeah he's getting beat up
[2:02:01] mocked spit on all this is happening
[2:02:04] this one that he's ready to die for he's
[2:02:06] warming himself by the fire outside the
[2:02:08] court the high priest and what happens
[2:02:11] little Maiden says hey you sound like
[2:02:12] him you got the same accent you must be
[2:02:16] from the Bronx I can tell the sound of
[2:02:18] your voice and what did he do he said no
[2:02:20] I'm not one of them no no no no no and
[2:02:22] what did he do he cursed while doing it
[2:02:25] and that's what brother bradam said in
[2:02:26] the first quote that we read Revelation
[2:02:29] true
[2:02:30] Revelation to the True Believer can
[2:02:33] never be
[2:02:34] overemphasized the importance of that
[2:02:36] brothers and sisters the importance of
[2:02:39] that today I believe is the greatest
[2:02:41] thing that we need we need the
[2:02:43] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[2:02:45] and the importance of Revelation by the
[2:02:47] spirit about the message of the hour but
[2:02:49] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[2:02:50] about truly Who We Are are amen
[2:02:54] amen because when that happens when when
[2:02:57] the church realizes what it is then the
[2:03:00] Rapture is going to
[2:03:03] go and and I know it's not going to
[2:03:05] happen one moment too soon it's not
[2:03:07] going to happen one moment too late it's
[2:03:09] going to be in the moment in the
[2:03:10] twinkling of an eye I had the discussion
[2:03:12] with brother Aaron mcgi one time how
[2:03:14] quickly that will be you can actually
[2:03:16] work out a mathematical formula I'm not
[2:03:17] too smart I'm not smart enough to do
[2:03:19] that someone here probably is but you
[2:03:21] can actually realize how quickly light
[2:03:23] travels and how quickly it flashes off
[2:03:25] of someone's eyeball and then reflects
[2:03:26] back to you that's pretty fast that's
[2:03:28] how quick the Rapture is going to go
[2:03:30] that's how quickly our bodies are going
[2:03:31] to be changed that's how quickly they're
[2:03:34] going to come out of the graves and be
[2:03:36] in the sky waiting for us my to meet him
[2:03:40] in the air maybe stand with me as we
[2:03:42] close today brothers and
[2:03:46] sisters I got one maybe two more
[2:03:50] here three more more I don't know couple
[2:03:53] more if it's okay when their eyes were
[2:03:55] open 1964 brother Bram said don't stand
[2:03:58] and look at it and try and figure it out
[2:04:00] like the Pharisees said they stood and
[2:04:03] looked at him there and said this man is
[2:04:06] Beelzebub they couldn't figure it out
[2:04:09] they had to give it a
[2:04:10] name they said this man does this by the
[2:04:14] spirit of the
[2:04:17] devil my he's beel abub a fortune teller
[2:04:23] and we know that Jesus said today I'll
[2:04:26] forgive you of
[2:04:28] this but when the true Holy Spirit
[2:04:33] comes if you say one word against him
[2:04:36] one word against him it won't be
[2:04:38] forgiven here or over there amen we got
[2:04:43] to be very careful how we
[2:04:46] speak why don't have nothing to do with
[2:04:49] this fellow he was born in in sin
[2:04:53] weren't we
[2:04:54] all he don't have our fellowship cards
[2:04:56] he doesn't belong to us and oh my they
[2:04:59] don't even know where he went to school
[2:05:01] at he has no education why well where
[2:05:05] did this man come from now he says the
[2:05:07] son of man says the son of man that's
[2:05:09] going to ascend up descended down he was
[2:05:12] born right here he's crazy unless you
[2:05:16] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[2:05:17] drink his blood he's a cannibal and he
[2:05:20] did that just to make them say those
[2:05:24] things can you imagine that he knew what
[2:05:27] they were going to say he knew who they
[2:05:31] were he says they had to do
[2:05:34] it talking about election
[2:05:38] my and so is the Holy Ghost
[2:05:41] today putting forth his word in
[2:05:45] manifestation yeah that
[2:05:48] men might condemn it
[2:05:52] so when we look at these things like
[2:05:54] Arizona news articles brothers and
[2:05:55] sisters he's done it for a purpose
[2:05:58] there's no accidents amen those people
[2:06:01] weren't acting out by accident those
[2:06:03] people were fulfilling the life that was
[2:06:04] inside of them the anointing struck that
[2:06:06] seed and they had to manifest the life
[2:06:09] that was in
[2:06:10] them just like those reporters who are
[2:06:13] coming against the message just like
[2:06:15] those other people who are coming
[2:06:16] against the message they have to they
[2:06:19] can't not do it
[2:06:22] and so is the Holy Ghost today putting
[2:06:23] forth his word in manifestation that men
[2:06:26] might condemn it that God might put his
[2:06:29] judgment upon the Earth as he promised
[2:06:32] he would do he hardened the heart of
[2:06:36] pharaoh Hallelujah he is the same
[2:06:38] yesterday today and forever he changes
[2:06:40] not he's God his systems of doing things
[2:06:43] shows himself Mighty with his word to
[2:06:46] manifest it he don't have to tell you
[2:06:48] all about
[2:06:49] it you don't have to figure
[2:06:52] out you can't figure it
[2:06:55] out you got to accept
[2:06:58] it just invite him in and see what
[2:07:02] happens anybody here ever done that you
[2:07:05] ever invite him in just to see what
[2:07:07] happens I guarantee you you will never
[2:07:09] ever be the
[2:07:11] same just invite him in and see what
