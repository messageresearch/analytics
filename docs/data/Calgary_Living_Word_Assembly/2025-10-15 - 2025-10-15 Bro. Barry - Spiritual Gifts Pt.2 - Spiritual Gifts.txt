[Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, once again, we're so thankful, Lord, to come into your presence. Lord, Father, we're always reminded of your word that says where two or three would gather in your name, there you'd be in the midst. Father, as we think about all of these licks of fire here tonight, Lord, all of us have one desire, Lord, just to serve you, to please you, to worship you, Lord. May you as our husband just receive the worship that we are bringing here tonight. You know, every heart, Lord, every need, every situation, Father, all of us going through something of some sort, Lord, the enemy certainly is raging. But oh God, greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Lord, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. Lord, these are our promises that we hold on to tonight. Lord, we just ask you, God, that you would take this service into your hands. Every aspect, Lord, we're here to become more like Christ. Oh God, from the hearing of your word, that soul in us knows exactly what to do with that word. It feeds on it. It pushes out more life of Christ in us. Lord, help us to surrender just that much more tonight that we might receive your portion. Grant these mercies. Bless every person, Lord. The effort they made to come out, you know, the difficulties on a Wednesday night, but Lord, there's always such a blessing, and we thank you for that, Lord. Bless our pastors. He brings the word. He's labored, Lord. We we've we've held him in our hearts through the day, Lord, in prayer. Lord, what could happen on a simple Wednesday night, Lord? &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes on the scene, &gt;&gt; he keeps all of his appointments, Lord, you keep every single one. And we invite you. We invite you. We invite you with a kiss. We wash your feet with our tears. Lord, we embrace you. We hug you to our chest. We ask you to hug us, Lord, up against you tonight, Lord. May as a as a bride, we just we just rest in the hands and arms of our bridegroom tonight. Receive our worship now. We pray in everything that we do. May you be pleased and honored. In Jesus precious name we ask these mercies. Amen. You may have your seats. You know, I was thinking on the way here, what a privilege it is for us to worship the one who created all. Amen. And our God desires worship so much that he would create us to worship him. He desires worship so much that he said if we don't worship the rocks will cry out. And I thought a thought where it's impossible not to be in the will of God if you don't worship. Amen. When you worship him, you have to be in the will of God. Amen. Such a wonderful thought. What a privilege we have as people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I must tell Jesus all of my trials. [Music] I cannot bear these burdens alone. In my distress, in my distress, he kindly will.

Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer once again. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, what an honor and a privilege it is to be able to praise you, Father. Lord Jesus, to gather together in your name, just give you praise and honor and glory. Father, we know that's the reason you created us, Lord Jesus, is to give you worship and to give you praise. You are God. You are you are desirous of worship. That's the reason that we're here, Father, is to give you praise and honor and glory. And tonight, Father, we just desire that we could do that with all of our hearts, Lord. And if we've ever made it anything other than that, we pray that you would forgive us for it, Lord. Lord Jesus, that we could just have pure hearts before you tonight, Lord. That we could come before your throne one more time with confidence, Lord, knowing that you hear our prayers. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to thank you for all that you do for us, Lord. As we come out of the Thanksgiving season, Lord Jesus, Father, we're so thankful for all of the goodness that you have provided for us in our lives, Lord. Father, we know there's many financial blessings, but that's the that's the smallest part, Lord, of what you've done for us. Oh, Father, to have health in our bodies, Lord Jesus, to have the desire to worship you, &gt;&gt; Lord, to know that we have gifts in our midst, in our lives. But, oh, Father, we have the giver. And we thank you for that, Lord Jesus. Tonight, Father, we just want to commit each need that was made known unto you by the wave and uplift hand, Father, that you would meet the need sovereignly, Father, in each life. Lord, &gt;&gt; and we'll be careful to give you the praise, Lord. And Father, one more time, we just want to unite together as a body, Father, for those people that are held hostages, Lord, taken against their will, Father, we know that you're watching over them, and we thank you for that, Lord. And we just ask that you would continue watching over them until the day they can be freed once again. &gt;&gt; And again, we'll give you the praise. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Father, as we turn to the word, we pray that you would just lead us and guide us, Father. Lord, we don't want to do this on our own. It has to be the moving of your spirit in our midst, Lord. And as our brother already prayed, we know you're here. So, we thank you for that, Lord. And help us, Lord Jesus, to warmly welcome you in your word tonight, Father. that we would receive it with open hearts, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Father, we just love you and we thank you. We commit this service into your hands now and all the prayers that we've prayed, Father. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Certainly good to be back in the house of the Lord again on Wednesday. As our uh brother Paul mentioned, there's so many Wednesday blessings that happen. If you have your Bibles tonight, I would like to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Continue on in our discussion about spiritual gifts. As you turn there tonight, just a few announcements. We've got the youth event this Sunday after service at our house. And we have a communion service on the 26th. And we have the youth service on the 31st, which is uh just a wonderful time. We have brother Cadre Diggs coming in on November the 22nd. Uh he'll begin on the 21st, but we'll have a service on the 22nd at 6 PM and then a regular Sunday service on uh the 23rd at 10:00 a.m. 1 Corinthians chapter 12, start with verse 1. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul the Apostle saying this to the Corinthian church, but we know for sure that it was truly the Lord, the spirit behind that penmanship. This is the spirit of the Lord saying, "I would not have you ignorant about spiritual gifts." &gt;&gt; That's why I think it's so beautiful and we can study him. He goes on to say in verse two, "Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations &gt;&gt; but the same Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which workketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with all. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge &gt;&gt; by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles. to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one, and the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. Let's just bow in prayer one more time. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for that spirit, Lord. Thank you for &gt;&gt; your spirit. We know that they're one and the same, Lord. That one that we read about is truly your life. And Father, tonight we just invite your spirit to manifest in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that you would help us all to get out of the way and just give you the preeminence, Father, that you could take this word and you could break it open to us fresh once again. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful to see so many people out on a Wednesday evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was doing a little reminiscing this week and certainly thankful for the leadership of the Lord in in the church and in our lives. And uh you know I I I'll just I'll just be transparent with it. I uh back in the day when brother Ken was still here, I questioned what uh what did brother Ken preach the first service that I came because I couldn't even remember. And uh so I got into the I was working in the sound booth a little bit when I was a deacon and brother Ken was pastor here. And I looked up that service July 27th, 2005, and we had it on the computer. And uh so I I I stumbled my way through and found a way to actually burn it to a CD. And uh so I had this CD and I put it away. I wanted to keep it safe and I was going to listen to it one day. And uh through the process of time, I didn't listen to it. You know, after brother Ken passed away, I I just found it difficult really, to be honest, to listen to him. But I got into listening to some of the sermons from Brother Ken and uh was able to begin to really just just celebrate the leadership of a a God-led pastor, a Holy Ghost filled man. And you know, I I was going through some stuff this last week and I came across this this CD that I mentioned and and I thought, man, I'm so thrilled to find this CD and I I've been listening to it and it just made me so uh I guess just miss Brother Ken. But, you know, it's wonderful to see what the Lord has done. And what I was really thrilled about was just stepping back and looking at what the Lord has done for the body in Calgary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, offices aside, just to look at the group of individuals in this city that want to celebrate this message of the hour, the leadership of Jesus Christ as a body. And I was just thanking the Lord for that. and and even tonight looking at everyone here, it it's it's no accident that we're here as a body, but it's just uh just a beautiful thing to to really think about. Now, some might just think Brother Barry's crazy and I have no idea what you're talking about, and I apologize if I'm rambling on about this, but you know, uh there's usually always a little bit of a a preamble before a service actually happens. So, that's just the way it is. we need to get in and get settled in the pulpit and then just allow the spirit to move. And you know, just being honest and transparent, that's really where my heart's been this week. And I've I've really been uh just a little bit melancholy and a little bit a little bit uh well, not a little bit, but a lot thankful for a Holy Ghostled pastor and uh certainly thankful for brother Ken and all that he did for the body in Calgary here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we just want to keep our shoulder tight to the wheel and make sure that we're doing everything we can. And you know, for those who are wondering, I can share that service. I'd be thrilled to do it. Maybe what we could do is even put it on uh on the computer here and you could just have thumb drives. But brother Kenny preached on the seven sons of one SA and uh you know how we can try and do things on our own and uh how we can make a mess of it and you know the people that tried to do it in that day in that church what they did was wanted to to perform the way that they wanted to. They wanted to take the gift and operate it the way they wanted to. They didn't want to fall under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. They did not want to have a pastor in their day. They wanted to actually just do it their way and get gained from it. And what happened was they wound up leaving the church wounded and naked. &gt;&gt; And that devil leapt on them. They left with that devil on them. It it's amazing to look at the the magnitude of that scripture. I just was was was kind of beside myself as I was listening to it. But just hearing Brother Ken's voice preach it, it just did something for me. And yeah, there's there's a whole lot that I could say about that. And tonight I don't want to do that. I want to get into the the spiritual gifts. And uh we're certainly thankful for the gifts in the church in the body. It's it's the you know the the the global body, the the body of the Lord. It's uh a many membered body. And we're not interested in chasing gifts. We're not interested I'll tell you, I was thinking about it, you know, uh we're not going to go into a study of the individual gifts and talk about personality types. I'm not doing that. I'm not passing out worksheets as we go through this study so that we can try and discover what our gifts are. I'm not going to do that. It's up to us to actually go to the Lord and just trust him that he would manifest his spirit through our lives and he will activate that gift in our lives. &gt;&gt; We will see the manifestation of the spirit in our lives the way that he wants it to be done. But I know there's ministries that have done that. And and I just it came across my my heart, you know, should I be doing that? Can we come up with worksheets so that we could discover what our We're not doing that. No. &gt;&gt; I would say that's maybe vacation Bible school stuff. We want to see the spirit of the living God live out through our lives. That's what we want to do here. &gt;&gt; Now, I apologize if somebody didn't like my statement there with that, but I I think it's very important. We're not getting into a psychological aspect of this. This is all about the operation of the spirit in the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham, he says this and uh I did send an email with the quotes, but not this one. So, don't worry. Don't get nervous. You're not going to find it there in the email. Brother Bradom, he says that this is his words. And all nine spiritual gifts should be in every local body and not just be in the body, but they should be operating and manifest the church. I think it's beautiful the way he said that. Was it an accident that they should manifest the church or that they should be manifesting in the church? I don't think it's any accident at all that he said it that way. And manifest the church. They should be what demonstrates what's going on in the church. Now, once again, just for the record as we go, I'm going to keep saying this. We're not chasing gifts, but we shouldn't be afraid of them either. &gt;&gt; There's a real delicate balance there. And I think it's such a beautiful thing. said it. My heart's desire is to say, brothers and sisters, let's not be afraid of the spirit of God because where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. And where there's liberty of the spirit of God, we're going to see gifts in our midst. &gt;&gt; But there's many scarecrows that have been raised up around this because that's where the devil loves to get in, isn't it? He loves to get in and and get people doing things and acting ways. And you're never going to get out of control. You're never going to get out of order if you have the spirit of God and he operates a gift in your life. We're never going to do that. And and you know, let's just say for example, maybe we do maybe we do get a little bit out of order. A and something happens. The thing that will happen after that, if somebody says it, you know what, according to the word of God, it was out of order. If they're truly of the spirit of God, they'll say, "Oh, forgive me." Right? It will be that simple. will be able to actually be corrected by the word of God. We won't be so puffed up that we can't be corrected by the word of God. There is truly a balance with this. But all nine spiritual gifts should be in every local body operating and manifest the church. It's so beautiful. I think it's wonderful the way that we can see this. you know, talking about the scripture tonight out of 1 Corinthians chapter 12, brother uh brother Paul here, he talks about this and he says in verse three, "Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost." So that is what I believe the baseline for all of this. &gt;&gt; There's no talk. we might as well just stay home if we're not going to come to church and talk about getting the Holy Ghost in our lives. We're not going to see gifts manifest in our body the way that they should according to scripture unless we do have the Holy Ghost in our lives. Because remember, Brother Brandham said it that Satan can impersonate any gift. This is why it's so treacherous. The devil loves to impersonate gifts. He loves to speak in tongues. He loves to speak in tongues out of order. I heard a brother fairly recently in Canada talking about the congregation in his church how he would preach and preach and preach and it was such a wonderful service and at the end of the service while they're actually having the first or second song right after the preaching what would happen a sister would jump up and just speak in tonesues she would speak in tongues so fervently and loud and and convicted right in Canada recently and and then she would sit down and there would be no interpretation. of it and it happened two or three times and he had to say listen there's something wrong here because I I I said wow that's an interesting thing and he said yeah what's going on is that spirit is manifesting in that sister and trying to actually undermine all of the word that's gone forward the whole entire service &gt;&gt; at the end of the service everyone's attracted now to this gift of speaking in tongues &gt;&gt; but yet there's no interpretation and brother Brandham He said very clearly that if there's going to be a speaking in tongues, there has to be an interpretation and it has to be judged in the church and it has to be relevant. Not just, you know, thus sayaith the Lord and and quoting a scripture. There's there's a very specific way that this is supposed to happen. And we know the word gives us a direction for it, but you know, it's not going to happen correctly, but by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's the way it has to be. But it goes on in verse four to say, "Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit. It's not different spirits." As soon as different spirits get in there, then it's something other than the Holy Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And you know, the the the word administrations, I'm not going to get too far into the the meanings according to the lexicon tonight, but I'm just going to say it this way for simplicity's sake. It's offices. There's differences of offices, administrations, but it's still the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations which are Acts. And we know that this is exactly what brother Brandham talked about in the book of Acts. The book of Acts was not the acts of the apostles. According to the way the the majority of Christians in the world speak about it, it's actually the acts of the Holy Ghost operating through those men. But there are diversities of operations, acts of the Holy Ghost. But it's the self, it's the same God which workketh all and all. But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. There's no man that is not supposed to have the the Holy Spirit in their lives. Every single one of us should see some form of a gift in our lives. &gt;&gt; This is not exclusive. the the scripture of God is of no private interpretation. And and I remember a brother telling me, there's no such thing as as uh discernment. It's only for the prophet. And I thought, my goodness, I I don't see I don't see it, but I guess if that's how you see it. Maybe that's the way it should be. But uh you know, it says it right here that there are gifts of discernment. But anyways, in 1958, Jesus Christ is saying yesterday, today, and forever. Brother Brham talking about spiritual gifts. Now, as a preacher, I'm not very much of a preacher, but the Lord has given a gift, a divine gift, which in the scriptures, we are taught that gifts and callings are without repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's church gifts. Not the gifts to the local church which we are to pray for like in 1 Corinthians 12. But there's five ministering gifts which are the fornowledge of God. And the first of those are apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. &gt;&gt; Those are God sent gifts to the church. Now I I love how brother Bradom he preaches this. He doesn't change his perspective on this in his entire ministry. And I'm not going to try and prove that by the quotes tonight, but I'm just going to say it. And if anybody really wants to see it, you can look it up and and go over it. But he doesn't change that. And even though today there are those that believe Ephesians 4 is not enough, that's a lying spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because Ephesians 4 is for the perfecting of the saints. Without Ephesians 4, this group of gifts for the church that we just read about, there is no perfecting of the saints. There's no eighth messenger. There's no ninth messenger. There's only seven church age messengers. And the seventh church age messenger has come and done what he is supposed to do. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here tonight. It's pretty amazing when we just zoom out and look at it that way. That's why we're here because he did what he was supposed to do. &gt;&gt; He was obedient and and honest with the word. &gt;&gt; And that that alone, I think it just behooves us to be obedient and honest with the word ourselves. &gt;&gt; It's not always pleasant. It doesn't always feel good, but we know that it will actually garner eternal salvation for us. But brother Brandham, he says here the the there's five ministering gifts which are the fornowledge of God. And the first of those are apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. Those are God-cent gifts to the church. And I love how brother Brandom breaks this down here. Apostles or missionaries. We call them missionaries today. But some people want to be called apostles today. We call them missionaries today. In the early day, they called them apostle. Now, anyone knows knows that the word apostle means one sent. And the word missionary means one scent. So, it's both the same thing. Missionaries, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. So tonight, I I I just felt like before we get too far into even talking about the individual gifts here that are all by the same spirit, it it's interesting to talk about the offices or the operation that we can see in here as a manifestation of the spirit. And and that is what we read about, you know, the the the apostles and the prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. Carrying on, he says here, then in every local church there's nine spiritual gifts that should operate. The nine spiritual gifts should operate and they should be all inside the local church. So there's there's the gifts of the ministry, but there's also the gifts of the spirit that should actually be operating in the body. And I think it's so good the way that he brings this out. It's important to recognize that those gifts are not just for the ministry. And I think sometimes in the day in which we live, it's almost not even spoken necessarily, but an undercurrent. It's almost maybe not spoken like I said, but assumed that those gifts, they lie strongly in the ministry, but not in the body. And I personally believe, brothers and sisters, it's the other way around. Because the gift of actually being an apostle or a missionary is something totally different than being uh someone who is maybe in a congregation that just has the desire to pray. They just pray and pray and pray. They're prayer warriors. There are people like that in the body and we thank the Lord for those people. But there's different positions for the gifts, different offices, administrations, as we read already in the scripture, administrations, different administrations, the pastor, the prophet, the the evangelist, the teacher, the the missionary. And then the nine spiritual gifts that are in the body, operating in the body, through the body, not necessarily through the ministry. I think it's really important to to nail that down. He says, "Then in every local church, there's nine spiritual gifts which should be operating in that church if they're a good praying congregation." You know, I I remember saying this a while ago, and it's funny where I heard it, the place that I heard it from, but it really really resounded with me. Imagine the church only going forward on its knees, &gt;&gt; meaning by prayer. &gt;&gt; That's the only way that the body will advance. And I believe that with all my heart. It really is the only way the body will advance. But imagine now if we take it and make it on our knees. How far will the church go forwards? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With our prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For me, that's humbling. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so incredible because really it takes that. It's got to be a church if they're a good praying congregation. And then the pastor who should be the head of the church with the wisdom of God. I say, "Oh Lord have mercy. Help me cuz I I'm just me here. But the head of the church with the wisdom of God to have that church set in order so no fanaticism or nothing takes place wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just everything proven purely the spirit of the Holy Ghost working among the people. Then you've got a real church that's an example church to all the regions around about. And you know, I think that's real good that we want to be an example to the regions all around about. But honestly, my heart's desire is to just be like that voice that brother Brandham talked about when he saw the preview of the bride is to just stay in line. Just every single service, throw it in there. Stay in line. Make sure that we've got that token applied. Stay in line. Don't start looking at Hollywood. Stay in line. Don't be all fussed about trying to lay up treasures of finances here. Just stay in line. &gt;&gt; There's so many things that are distractions here for us. &gt;&gt; And we all have them. I'm guilty. But you know, we we we are an example to the regions about even when we just go about our lives in our our businesses and school and even if we just go out shopping. If you just go to the mall with a sister, with your wife, people look. If they have their hair down, people look. It is strange to have really long hair and to be we stand out. It's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we want to be an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the people around us so they can say, "What is it? What is it in you that causes you &gt;&gt; to stand out the way that you do? What is that atmosphere about you?" Yes. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; like how brother Bradam he says this. It's it's a hive where the bees come. A lovely church &gt;&gt; and you know it's it's sweet &gt;&gt; and you get more bees with honey, don't you? &gt;&gt; If you go out there and you say, "Look at that person." A person comes in the congregation and and they're wearing high heels and a a tight minikrt. No, you can't come in. They come in with tattoos and maybe smelling of cigarettes or weed and maybe booze. No, you can't come in. Where do we stand when we act like that? &gt;&gt; We're just like the heathens. &gt;&gt; We're not making ourselves any better if we're not actually helping people. &gt;&gt; We're here to get people to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a beautiful thing because the only way we're going to do it truly is through this message of the hour. Because there's a lot of people like we talked about last service that are talking about Jesus Christ and I can type in my spiritual GPS and find whatever scripture I want and and I can find a way home. I can still get to Jesus Christ. But you can't get to the rapture outside of this message. &gt;&gt; That ain't going to happen. Right? &gt;&gt; There's going to be people that think that they're actually okay and they're going to be deceived. They're going to find out that they're deceived. They probably already are. And and you know, sadly, I think that there's people even in the message of the hour that are going to find themselves in that position. And I say, "Lord, don't don't leave me out. Help me. Search me and try me. I I don't want to be deceived. I don't want to think that I'm all right and actually not be all right." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You know, we're all human. We all suffer from the same condition. Just getting a little bit melancholy, you know. I I remember looking at brother Ken and Sister Shelly, and I hope it's okay, Sister Shelly. But I remember looking at them thinking, you know, they they probably haven't seen some of the stuff that's gone on in this world. I mean, they're in the church. They're in the message. Look at them. Their lives are pretty exemplary. And uh you know they probably don't have any idea about some of the things that go on. And uh you know come to find out they probably knew a whole lot more than I thought. They probably knew a whole lot more than maybe I even knew. And uh it's just a wonderful thing. You know that's the world that we live in. But when when we do come to the place of realizing who we are and what we're raised up for, we actually have a different character to this entire world. And and people might look at us as though we are maybe uninformed. Maybe we don't know what's going on, but we know what's going on. We're well aware of what's going on in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think it's even amazing to look at the scripture here now concerning the spiritual gifts. Brethren, I would not have you ignorant. And you know, he says that many different times in the Bible of the times and the seasons. He would not have us to be ignorant. But no man knows the day or the hour, right? He doesn't leave us in the dark. He gives us what we need so that we can go forward &gt;&gt; in uh faith. Faith without works is dead. Brother Branam, he says this. Now I'm not excited. We're talking about gifts here as we go through this. Now I'm not excited, but I know what I'm speaking of. The right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; There it is. How many of us here in the congregation have ever prayed for healing and not been healed? &gt;&gt; And I I and not been healed. &gt;&gt; Wow. We uh we have the opportunity to be healed. Healing is the children's bread. &gt;&gt; That's what he took those stripes for. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know many times in my body I've I've been very sick and uh you know just violently sick and I think one of the last times that I was I I started to think about the word and thinking about different conversations that I've had with people and how the devil likes to come around and make us feel like we're not going to get better at all. But then something happens and and the Lord, I believe, comes on the scene and reminds us, you know, he took those stripes for us. And and I remember vividly one time just being violently ill, but I started laughing in the midst of it when I really wanted to be crying cuz I really don't like getting sick. But in the midst of it, I started laughing, thinking, "This is just this flesh. It's just this body. It's a pest house. &gt;&gt; I have to get better according to the word of God." &gt;&gt; That's right. One way or another, I will be 100% healed. &gt;&gt; But I love how brother Brandham says this. I think about four or five times in the message of the hour. He says this, "The right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass." There it is. We have to have the right mental attitude towards that promise. If we have the wrong mental attitude towards his promise, then it might not come to pass the way that we think that we would like to see it. And you know, brother Brandham in different places in the message, he says, if you want healing in your body, why do you want it? &gt;&gt; What's it for? &gt;&gt; So you can actually go forwards and do something on your own. Is it going to be about you or like what's your reason for it? If you want to have money, what's your reason for it? Is it to provide for your family or so that you can actually go bigger and better? If you want anything and you're asking God about it, what is the purpose for it? If we have the right mental attitude, then that will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say here, say, what are you talking about gifts for? Gifts are to edify. &gt;&gt; They're additions. Here is the first and only foundation for divine healing or anything from God is the Bible. &gt;&gt; If you get off of that, you're out of God's will. And divine healing isn't a hocus pocus affair. It isn't saying a few mystery words over somebody and hypnotizing. It's the truth revealed through Jesus Christ is divine healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Gifts of the spirit are brought down to edify. In other words, it's the flag flying over top of the building. It's the appearance of the outside to attract people in out of the rain. See what I mean? Now, gifts come from God. If they are from God, they'll testify of God, and God will testify of them. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just can't help but refer back to that that message that brother Ken preached in 2005. The gifts will testify of God. &gt;&gt; The seven sons of Ca did not want to testify of God. They just wanted to see the operation of the gift and they wanted to be the ones that were actually doing it, bringing it on the scene. They were not actually testifying of God because if they were, they would have said, "Go see Paul. &gt;&gt; They would not have actually tried to do it on their own." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "If you're sick, pray until you believe with all your heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you ever just pray for something you just knowed you was going to get? &gt;&gt; That's faith. See, &gt;&gt; and I I I just don't want to read over this tonight and and and go quickly through it and and just gloss over it. I want to dwell here. I want to hover here for a few minutes if it's okay. If we could just just just just dwell on this for a little bit. If you are sick, pray until you believe with all your heart. And you know, if we are sick and we have something that we need from God, are what are we doing to pray? Are we just doing the same thing that we've always done? Because if that's the case, we're only going to get what we've ever got. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we want something from God and we really want it from God, we need to show him that we really want it from God. &gt;&gt; We need to make a change in our life and demonstrate to him that we really want this. If you're sick, pray until you believe with all your heart. Did you ever pray for something you just know you was going to get? He says, "That's faith." See, and I wonder tonight, I'm not looking for a raise of hands because this gets quite personal, but how many of us have ever prayed for something that you just know you're going to get? &gt;&gt; That's an interesting statement. It's an interesting question. I I personally, as I was studying this and reading it, I don't know if I could say that I really just knew that I was going to get something other than healing in my life. Maybe salvation in my life and and healing in my life. But I I don't think that I could just put my finger on it and say that I prayed for something else and I just knew that I was going to get that. But I know people that have done that. I I remember hearing a testimony of a man that walked into a dealership uh uh a car dealership and said that I'm I'm I God told me that you're going to sell me that van right there for x number of dollars. And the guy said, "Yep, that's exactly right." And he sold it to him for that. And it was just an absurd number. It should have been double or triple what he offered him. &gt;&gt; But sometimes if we just if we pray for something and and God just reveals it to us, nothing's going to stand in the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just like knowing that we're going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Healing is the children's bread. He took 39 stripes with the catine tails. &gt;&gt; For healing. &gt;&gt; In fact, the very first blood that was shed was from him being whipped almost to death &gt;&gt; for healing. He didn't have to be whipped. He could have just been crucified. But he chose &gt;&gt; that specific thing, that specific way. all of that pain and suffering just so that we could get better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I know that I've gone over that and over that in my mind when I'm really sick and I I just thank him for that. And sometimes I think it's really important to just remind the devil, you know, the salvation and everything is all looked after. Calvary looked after it all. But let's not forget this very important detail about the cat of nine tales. Them almost taking Jesus' life with the stripes for my healing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're sick, pray until you believe with all your heart. If we're sick tonight and we have something that we need from the Lord, then are we praying with all of our heart? Or is it some of our heart or is it just the only the bit that we can give them because we've got everything else going on? Maybe what we need to do is just reallocate some time for him so that we can actually pray a little bit more. Don't think for a second that if we do that that he'll allow us to go out and suffer. In fact, he'll actually honor it. If we're willing to give him more, he'll be willing to give us more. That's how it works. He says, "Now, if you believe that with all your heart, accept it and act on it. Don't just speak it. We have to act." I love how Brother Random says it many times. You know, you can hear some folks say that I'm, "Well, I'm just praying for this and I'm just praying for that." But sometimes we need to be acting, &gt;&gt; not just praying. &gt;&gt; We have to be moving. We've got to be going forwards. Now, if you believe that with all your heart, accept it and act on it. We know that brother John Ryan was blind as blind could be. &gt;&gt; But something triggered inside of him when he went back up to the prophet and said, "Hey, I thought you said I was healed." And he said, "Hey, I thought you said you believed." &gt;&gt; Something clicked for him. Something triggered and it became a revelation. And it wasn't from the prophet to him. It was God. the angel of the Lord that was with the prophet that told him that and that's what triggered that faith in his life and at that point he became what they called a nuisance in the services because he knew that praising God was going to bring the promise on the scene it was going to bring the blessing down in his life even in the midst of people mocking him saying you're not going to get it look at you the natural circumstances look at the natural circumstances study the veil look at the natural circumstances long as we do that that's where we're going to be &gt;&gt; we got to go beyond that. We got to look beyond the camp. We got to be willing to say this is the promise of God. He says, "Now, if you believe that with all your heart, accept it and act on it." Now, you can believe it just as much as you wanted to. If you didn't act on it, you'll sit right there like a sinner would lay at the altar. If you got down there and prayed and prayed, you said, "Lord, I know you saved me." But that's just I know you said he'll never get through until he rises, confesses it, and stays with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And shows works with it. &gt;&gt; You know, we we can get into the whole discussion is works is faith expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show me your faith and I'll show you my works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is what the word says. &gt;&gt; I believe it's in the book of James. &gt;&gt; But I'll show you my faith by the works that you see demonstrated in my life. &gt;&gt; Because talk is cheap, man. &gt;&gt; We can say it all we want, but what do we live? &gt;&gt; What is the life that we're living? &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; We've talked about this in the past. You know, we talk about prayer meeting. Prayer meeting is a wonderful thing, brothers and sisters. I'm not gonna I'm not going to back up from it. I'm just gonna I'm just going to go for it. It's important. Prayer meetings are important. And you know, I think they're probably even more important than a regular Wednesday night service. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Don't you think so? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's the most powerful weapon that we have is prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we come to church just to be fed a little bit and we can go home? We done our service. But what about when when we come together and we pray together? &gt;&gt; We get in the spirit. We sing some songs, some hymns. We we we welcome the Lord in our midst and then we begin to pray for the needs that we have in our lives. I think it's incredible. But you know, when we have a prayer meeting, there's like 10 people here out of a church of a hundred. Why is it? We read it the other night or the other uh Yeah, it was the other night, the other prayer meeting in in the conduct, order, and doctrine book. It's because the revival's over in this world. The spirit revival is over. There's a bride revival going on, but there's actually something else taking place in this world that's causing everyone to just be busy, busy, busy, busy with everything. And you know, I I know myself. I know myself what it means to actually be busy. But I also know that when you actually take and you alter things, you turn that dial a little bit in your life and you force everything else to become second and you put God first, there's a blessing that comes. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; he says, "Now, you can believe it just as much as you wanted to. If if you didn't act on it, you'll sit right there like a sinner would lay at the altar. If you got down there and prayed and prayed, you said, "Lord, I know you just saved me, but that just I I know you said he'll never get through until he rises and confesses and stays with it and shows works with it." James said, "Just as a body is dead without the spirit, so as faith without works is dead." No matter how much you believe, no matter how much we believe. And that's why I'm telling you friends, these gifts are brought in to make the presence of God real to you. &gt;&gt; I guess I'm nearly deafening talking. The gifts are brought to make the presence of God real to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then your faith looks up to God and accepts divine healing or salvation or whatever you have need of from God. You know, brothers and sisters, I can tell you just simple little testimonies just because I think it's important for us to never ever under undervalue the power of God. When I first came into the church, I first started serving the Lord. I I was a ranked sinner, came right in out of the world. I I was working on one house in the service department for the the builder. We had one customer that had this issue with their house and and I don't know if it was just they didn't like the house or or something. Usually the the sales center from the very start would rub the p customer wrong and then it would just be the whole entire process all the way through a whole year worth of agony with a customer that just didn't like their house. But I got I got invited to take over one of these projects after they had taken possession of their house and and I had to do something a particular thing in their house. And there was just really no way that I could ever do it. It had happened four times. Four other service techs tried attempted to do it. And every single time there was an issue with it. And you know, sometimes it's just the simplest little tiniest little speck that you could just barely see. But the person when they're in that state, man, they look at it with a magnifying glass and a flashlight and they'll go over it and over it and and they just went they did that. And so I got tasked with this right after I was saved. And I I was starting to worry. I was like, I don't even know how I'm going to do this. And it might sound silly. But you know what? I I actually said, "No, I I'm I'm not going to go to church on I'm not going to go and deal with this on a Sunday." I had to go and deal with painters and stuff and and and just do all this different stuff. And you know, I they wanted me to do on the weekend. And I said, "No, I'm actually not going to be a weekend warrior now. I'm going to church on Sunday. I'm going to do that and I'll do it Monday when I'm supposed to on my job." And and then it was like, "Oh, you're gonna be like that." Okay. And uh but nobody was able to satisfy these customers. And you know, I just gave it to the Lord. I said, "Lord, I don't know how on earth I'm ever going to be able to satisfy this customer. How is it ever going to go away? They're already with new home warranty. It was just this big blown up thing. I gave it to the Lord and I was able to deliver that thing that I needed to in a way that it needed to happen and it was flawless." Amen. &gt;&gt; But that was totally the Lord. &gt;&gt; It sounds like a very simple little thing. But I can tell you through that little simple little thing, it gave me just enough courage in that moment to say, "If he could do it there, &gt;&gt; couldn't he do it here? &gt;&gt; And if he could do it here, can't he do it there? And if he could do it there, it's exactly the way the Lord does it in our lives, brothers and sisters. He wants us to trust him, &gt;&gt; but we've got to be willing to take that step to do something different, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's wonderful the way that he does it. I love how he says this though, you know, then lift then then your faith looks up to God and accepts divine healing or salvation or whatever you have need of from God. It isn't only do one thing or another. Anything that you have need of in this earth's journey, God will supply it if you have need of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've got a boss that you just can't stand or that just can't stand you and you need a job, he'll either change that boss or you'll find another job. &gt;&gt; If we've got a problem client, he'll find a solution for it. If if if we have any issue in this earth, &gt;&gt; he promises to supply our needs. &gt;&gt; But you know what this world has done? This world has caused a circumstance where we get ourselves into a position of wants. &gt;&gt; And those wants transpire into needs. &gt;&gt; And because we're in the midst of our needs, now we have wants. And the wants actually become needs. And before long, we cannot see. You know the saying, you can't see the forest through the trees, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you got all these trees in front of you. Or or sometimes we paint ourselves into a corner. I've done both, by the way, with our business. I've done both. I got myself so busy, so incredibly busy that I can't come to church. Ah, you know what? Wednesday night, it'll be okay. I'll just pick it up later. And, you know, God will still bless me. I know I'm saved. It doesn't matter. It does matter. It matters a whole lot more than we might think. And and you know when we start to let those little bars down, what happens is the goats get in. &gt;&gt; But he says anything that you have need of in this earth's journey, God will supply it if you have need of it. &gt;&gt; He promises to supply your needs, not your wants, your needs. So many times when we ask for things in prayer fervently and we don't get them, I think it's worthwhile stepping back and saying, "Is this a want &gt;&gt; or is this a need?" &gt;&gt; Because he's only going to be accountable to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's God, he says, and and he can only he can only get it to you as you believe him. &gt;&gt; And gifts are to make you see that he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his attitude towards one is towards all. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's just so wonderful. &gt;&gt; You know what else is wonderful? From the beginning, that clock has been quarter to 9. I don't even know what time it is right now. So, I'm I'm going to It is actually quarter to 9. Hilarious. Proverbs 15 verse 27. He that is greedy of gain troubleeth his own house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he that hateth gifts shall live. &gt;&gt; I think it's interesting this little study of spiritual gifts that we're into as we go forwards. It's really important for us to understand that he wants to supply all of our needs. &gt;&gt; That's his word according to his riches in glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's not going to supply our needs. Even when we paint ourselves into a corner, if we paint ourselves into a corner with our wants, which transpire into our needs, he's going to allow us to get really, really needy in that corner before he actually supplies our need. And it might not be exactly the way that we want it or think that it should be actually answered or supplied, but he'll do it. &gt;&gt; He always does. He's always accountable to his word. It's wonderful how he never changes. &gt;&gt; You know, in Genesis chapter 25, the very first occurrence of the word gifts, Genesis 25:6, but unto the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son. Interesting scripture here. while he yet lived eastward unto the east country. I I can't help but think when you read a scripture like this talking about gifts, this is a a perfect example of the people that are going to chase gifts. But you know, the royal seed of Abraham, they're not interested in chasing the gifts because they're the ones that were sent away. They were given gifts and pushed aside. Why would the son of Abraham want the gifts? He didn't need gifts because he had Abraham. He had his father and and it's the same way for us as the spiritual royal seed of Abraham. We're not chasing gifts. The gifts they go with the people who go and live in the east country. Yeah. They're not the ones who are actually seeking the Lord with all of their hearts. Isaac had the giver. He didn't need a gift. You know, out of what it takes to overcome what it takes to overcome all unbelief. In 1960, brother Brandham says here, "Then God has gifts that he has fornown for each age and has placed them into the church." Now, we find out there's five of those gifts. The first of them is missionaries or apostles. The word apostle means one sent. The word missionary means one sent. The missionary is sent. An apostle is sent. God sends his missionary. God sends his apostle first as apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. Those five God-given gifts in the church. So each of you people who has a godly pastor has a gift from God in your church. A shepherd pastor means a shepherd to watch over the flock to teach them the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then these other nine spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the Ananas and Safirus and so forth. That's pretty strong. &gt;&gt; Ananas and Safirus. You know the story. &gt;&gt; What was it? They they they all had all things in common, but yet they they just wanted to keep a little pinch of the money back. It was all about money. Can you imagine? And you know, when they came in, Paul said, just paraphrasing, why do you try and deceive the Holy Ghost? Why are you lying to the Holy Ghost? But they came in and actually lied to Paul, right? They came in and lied to the brethren about what they had done just because they wanted to hold back a little bit of money. Maybe they wanted to have a bit of an investment and look after their family a little bit or or whatever. They wanted a vacation property. They wanted something just a little bit to their themselves. And and you know, you can't fool God. We're we're not going to fool. We're not going to bluff the Holy Ghost. And that's why I think it's so wonderful to have a a spiritfilled church, like a true spiritfilled church, a baptism of the Holy Ghost experience in the name of Jesus Christ. because we are in an Ananas and Safh time. There's no pulling the wool over the Holy Ghost in this congregation, brothers and sisters. And I know it's wonderful because some people get excited when you start to talk like that and other people start to squirm. And you know, myself, I'll tell you when my pastor used to preach like that, I used to squirm because I know that I'm just a human being and I still have desires. I still have problems and issues in my life. But you know what happens is I bring them to the Lord and say, "Lord, forgive me. I don't want to hold nothing back from you. &gt;&gt; I come to service early so that I can get myself out of the way and just allow his spirit to wash me." But that's all it takes, brothers and sisters, is just to surrender our lives unto him. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to be afraid. But when we're not actually fully surrendered, I will say this. If you're going to come and be in the congregation of the church of the living God, be afraid. Be very afraid. Because the spirit of God will not be mocked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This ain't fooling. &gt;&gt; This is the real deal. &gt;&gt; And I I can only tell you that I know what it did for me. And I truly hope that it will do the same for everyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a big difference just just to be clear. There's a big difference between just making it a mockery and just coming around and having an attitude a chip on your shoulder or whatever because whatever happened in life and you don't preach about the deep things or whatever, whatever. We we can have many different perspectives and I get that. But just trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just trust that the Lord will minister to the need. And if we can do that, I believe that we will see these gifts manifest in the body. And and it's not about seeing the gifts manifest in the body as much as keeping the body clean. This is the point that I want to make. This is what he said here. Then these other nine spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean like Ananas and Safirus. And you know that reference is a very powerful one because both Ananas and Safirus they died. They died because they lied. They died because they were greedy. They died because they had lust for money. They died because they were not willing to be completely surrendered. But yet they were coming around and hanging out with the believers. They loved the atmosphere. They probably loved the food. They loved everything that was going on. But yet they just couldn't totally surrender. like Ananas and Safirus and so forth, the spirit of God rise up and call somebody out and tell them they're living wrong and rebuke that sin openly. And that's what the Holy Spirit is in the church for, &gt;&gt; to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord. We believe that. We believe that, don't we believe that? &gt;&gt; We believe that. Now then there are these other gifts that comes into the church. Now after the pastor then there's the evangelist comes in and then there's teachers comes in and then there's prophets come in. Then there are apostles come in. All these together working together with the gifts keep the church perfected and clean and ready for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's so beautiful to think that this this is his way of keeping the church clean. This is the actual house cleaning. And you know, brothers and sisters, I'll say it this way. It's not always going to be somebody standing up in church and speaking in tongues who has been tested and then they're going to interpret and we're going to hear as a prophecy that comes for the church and someone's going to be called out because they're living in sin. We could have a brother actually just simply call another brother and just be having a conversation and not even fully realize the the conversation, the direction that it's going and suddenly they start hitting on something that's going on clearly directly exactly in that other brother's life. It could be exactly like that in a sister's life. A sister calls a sister and suddenly they start talking and then suddenly the one sister is like, "How did you know that? Why did you know that? How could you possibly know that thing in my life? Somebody must have told you. Somebody must have been talking. Guess what? The Holy Spirit is actually acting through the body. &gt;&gt; It's not always a big show. Many times it's a private affair. In fact, that's what the prophet said the third pull would be is a total private affair. It's not going to be a public show. &gt;&gt; But I think the the most effective and and and we can see it when it happens from the pulpit when there's a minister ministering. Sometimes it feels like someone's talking about us. Someone's telling all of our stuff. And you know what? That's not happening. It's the same thing as the king of Syria. He was like, "Who's who's telling what's going on? I've got a spy in my camp. Someone is telling this prophet of Israel what's going on in my bed chamber." But someone had to say to him, "No, he's actually he's actually a prophet of the living God of Israel." And God tells him these things. It's the same thing. The same spirit, brothers and sisters, that's here tonight with us &gt;&gt; in Matthew 7:8. For everyone that askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be opened, &gt;&gt; or what man is there of you whom, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? &gt;&gt; So, I just want to pause there. I'll I'll invite the musicians as we close tonight. What man is there of you? How many of us here tonight, if our son asked us for bread, he would ask because he's hungry? &gt;&gt; Daddy, I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; And and we would just give him a stone. Would we do that? I don't think we would ever do that. We would never give him a stone. Or if he asked for a fish, I don't want carbs tonight. I want some protein, daddy. some of that some of that really good fish that you do the way you do it. If he asked for a fish, would he give him a serpent? If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, imagine that. If if we being evil know how to give good gifts to our children, remember the word evil isn't necessarily being out in a in a in a pentagram and witchcraft and and candles. It's not that. It's one word off. One word off. And I want to say this tonight. Maybe having one attitude off. One attitude in our heart off is going to be evil. If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to our children, how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to encourage us tonight, brothers and sisters, don't be afraid of the gifts and don't be afraid of asking the giver if you need a gift &gt;&gt; because he'll give it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we don't want to put gifts out there front and center. We don't want to be a gift machine. This isn't about making God show for anything for anyone. It's about providing our needs when we have them. Verse 12 says, "Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. For this is the law and the prophets." &gt;&gt; Don't think that we're going to actually go out and behave one way for ourselves and the rest of the world is going to get something different. Everyone should actually pander to me and give me the best deals and everything should flow my way, my way, my way. But when somebody else actually has the opportunity, no, no, no, no. The way that we want to see this happen is for everyone to be beneficiaries of this blessing. Right? &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close tonight. In Ephesians 4:8 says, "Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and he gave gifts unto men. The captivity part is gone and he has freely given unto us all of himself. We're not going to limit ourselves to just gifts in the body. Brothers and sisters, I'm not saying that at all. But what I am saying is when we do see these gifts manifest, let's not be afraid of them and understand that they're actually supposed to be there. It's God identifying himself in the body. That's what the prophet said. God richly bless you all tonight. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight for your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for your leadership and your guidance in our lives, Lord. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, so many times we get busy in this world. And Father, we let the things of this world sometimes even get out of hand in our lives. Yes, Lord. And father, when that happens, it causes so much pressure in our minds. It causes so much pressure in our hearts. It causes so much pressure in our homes that we just don't even know what way to turn. But we know that, Father, you are always right where we left you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And if we could just Oh, Lord Jesus. Just like that backsliden prophet that time in the in the belly of that fish, Lord. And every single direction that he looked, he saw belly. And every single time he smelled, he smelled the inards of that belly. And he just simply saw seaweed and all of the natural circumstance. But father, he remembered that if he could just look towards Jerusalem, if he could look towards that holy temple, oh father, that you would deliver him no matter where he was. Father, tonight I pray that Lord, us having the true open word, you yourself, the giver. Help us, Lord, in the midst of our battles, in the midst of our trials, in the midst of our tribulations, Lord, Father, to look to you directly for our sovereign help in our time of trouble. Because we know that you will give us that help. &gt;&gt; But, Father, we know that you wait for us to come to a place where we're beyond our pride. &gt;&gt; Help us to get beyond ourselves, Lord Jesus. Help us to go beyond our own camps and our minds and our hearts, Lord, to the place where we trust you with all of our heart, Lord. And we don't lean onto our own understanding, thinking that it has to be a certain way, but trusting you in all that we do, Father, because then we know that you will direct our paths. You will show us the right way to go. You will lead us to deliverance from whatever the problem is in our lives. Father, tonight we thank you for your deliverance. Thank you for those 39 stripes that you took for us, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; For our healing, Lord Jesus, not just in our body, but in our minds. And not just in our body and our minds, but in our very souls. Father, we're so thankful for your goodness to us. We pray now, Lord, that you would just keep your hand upon us as we go our separate ways. Lord, if it be your will for us to gather again on Sunday, we'll be careful to give you the praise. Father, tonight we just also pray for those who are traveling that you would keep your hands upon them, Lord. Father, those who are maybe working or sick in their bodies or maybe just in their minds, Lord, so they can't come to service, whatever it is, Father. Lord, we pray that you would just be with them tonight, too, Father. Lord, that you would sovereignly bring peace and and encouragement to them, Lord Jesus. that Father, if it's your will for us to gather again on Sunday, that Lord, we'll just have that courage and strength to to get back up, Lord, and come and worship you with all that you have placed in us. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I stand in awe of you. You are beautiful beyond description, Lord. Too marvelous for words. You're too wonderful for comprehension [Music] like nothing ever seen or heard? Who can grasp your infinite wisdom? Who can fathom the depths of your heart? You are beautiful beyond description majesty. [Music] I stand I stand in all you. I stand I stand in you. Oh God to you. All praise is Ille.
