[16:17] that's
[16:20] rising and
[16:22] often in fear, Lord, of all the things
[16:24] that are happening around the world.
[16:28] But we give you thanks, Lord Jesus, for

[16:33] children, Lord.
[16:36] It is so good, Lord. We thank you for

[35:33] Lord. Amen. Well, um,
[35:38] this song talk to me this morning. Amen.
[35:43] Okay. Sometime
[35:46] we ask
[35:48] God something
[35:50] and then
[35:53] it appears that he doesn't come
[35:57] at the time
[36:00] that we want him to come.
[36:04] And then when he showed up, that's when
[36:08] we realized that he was on time.
[36:14] So I hope that a blessing that's that's
[36:18] will be that will be a blessing for you.
[36:20] And I have one question for you may
[36:23] perhaps too.
[36:25] Have you ever
[36:27] say have you ever said something
[36:31] that you said you would never say? Or
[36:35] have you ever done something that you
[36:38] say you would never done?
[36:42] So that's my testimony. Maybe one day
[36:47] I'll dive deeper into it. But uh maybe
[36:51] that's me only.
[36:57] It's a song you know
[37:00] probably have heard of it before.
[37:03] The news came to Jesus.
[37:08] Please come fast.
[37:12] Lazarus is sick and without your help,
[37:18] he will not last.
[37:23] Mary and Martha.
[37:27] Watch the brother die.
[37:32] They waited for Jesus.
[37:35] He did not come. And they wondered why
[37:44] they did watch was over.
[37:47] [Music]
[37:50] Buried for days.
[37:56] Somebody says
[37:59] he'll soon be here. The Lord's on his
[38:03] way.
[38:08] M I run to him.
[38:14] And then she cried,
[38:18] [Music]
[38:19] "Lord, if you had been there, you could
[38:23] have healed him. He'd still be alive.
[38:28] [Music]
[38:31] But you're 4 days late.
[38:36] [Music]
[38:37] And all hope is gone.
[38:42] Hallelujah.
[38:43] Lord, we don't
[38:47] understand why you waited so long.
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] But his way is God's way,
[38:58] [Music]
[39:00] not yours or mine.
[39:04] [Music]
[39:06] And isn't it great when he's 4 days
[39:10] late?
[39:12] He's still on time.
[39:14] [Music]
[39:19] Jesus said, "Martha,
[39:23] come
[39:24] show me the grave."
[39:31] But she said, "Lord, you don't
[39:34] understand.
[39:36] It's been there for days."
[39:42] The grave, the gravestone were was
[39:45] rolled back
[39:49] and Jesus cried.
[39:55] Lazarus come forth and somebody said
[40:00] he's alive. He's alive.
[40:07] You may be fighting
[40:10] [Music]
[40:12] a battle of fear.
[40:17] And you cry to the Lord, I need you now,
[40:22] but he does not appear.
[40:28] Friends, don't be discouraged
[40:32] [Music]
[40:33] cuz he's still the same.
[40:39] He'll soul come in here and roll back
[40:43] the sto and call out your name.
[40:51] But he's for a slave
[40:54] [Music]
[40:56] and all hope is gone.
[41:00] [Music]
[41:03] Lord, we don't
[41:05] understand
[41:07] why you waited so long.
[41:14] But his way is God's way.
[41:18] [Music]
[41:20] Not yours, oh mine.
[41:26] And isn't it great when his fault is
[41:30] laid,
[41:32] his own time?
[41:37] And isn't it great when his foot is
[41:42] late,

[42:06] morning. He's always on time. He's the
[42:08] same yesterday, today, and forever. As
[42:11] we all have figured out in our Christian
[42:12] life, it's not about our time, but his.
[42:15] And he knows who's best. He knows what
[42:17] time is best to answer. We thank the
[42:20] Lord for his faithfulness. We sing this
[42:23] song this morning. Thy loving kindness
[42:26] is better than life. My lips shall
[42:27] praise. Is there pastors?
[42:30] Thy loving kindness
[42:35] is better than life.
[42:40] I love my
[42:45] is better than I.

[45:21] Hallelujah. A blessing this morning.
[45:24] Welcome to the house of the Lord. If you
[45:26] have a need to that you need to have
[45:29] answered, maybe just make it known unto
[45:31] him by way of an uplift hand as we go to
[45:33] him in prayer.
[45:35] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[45:37] one more time, we're so thankful that we
[45:39] can gather together in your presence. We
[45:41] know that according to your word that
[45:43] you're already here, Lord. And we're so
[45:45] thankful that you're not just passing
[45:47] by, but Lord, we can't help but think
[45:51] about how we need to cry out unto you.
[45:54] You have given us that mode of
[45:57] communication.
[45:58] You have given us instruction, Lord,
[46:00] that we ought to speak the word, that we
[46:03] should cry out unto you, Father. Amen.
[46:06] Hallelujah. And Lord, this morning we
[46:08] do. We're so thankful for the many many
[46:11] manifold blessings you have given us and
[46:14] provided for us, Lord. Lord, and even
[46:18] now, Father, to be able to be here in
[46:20] this moment. Yes. Amen. As our brother
[46:23] prayed, as this world is falling apart
[46:26] all around us, Lord, the shifting sands
[46:29] of change.
[46:31] Father, we're so thankful that your word
[46:33] that you never change. Even as human
[46:36] beings, we change. Even as a church, it
[46:39] changes. Oh, Father, but you never
[46:41] change. Your word remains. And we thank
[46:44] you for that, Lord. This morning, we
[46:46] just want to commit the needs made known
[46:48] unto you today by the way of an uplift
[46:51] hand, Father. Maybe even just an uplift
[46:53] heart. Lord, yes, Lord. You know our
[46:56] needs. You know our hearts, Father. We
[46:58] just want to commit the needs unto you,
[47:01] Father. We're so thankful that we know
[47:03] that you're a living God. We don't
[47:05] wonder
[47:07] Lord Jesus now as we turn to you Father
[47:10] as we turn to your word we just invite
[47:13] you father to have the preeminence Lord
[47:16] one more time take control of the
[47:18] service father one more time minister
[47:20] the words of life to us father amen as
[47:23] we sat down with you I can't help but
[47:26] think about how once upon a time you had
[47:28] people with you on the mount and you
[47:30] just told them to sit down and listen
[47:33] and you began to express unto them what
[47:35] we call the biatitudes. Father, one more
[47:38] time while we sit down, Lord, help us to
[47:41] listen. Help us to have ears to hear
[47:44] what your spirit says unto the church
[47:46] today. Father, we love you and we thank
[47:49] you. We just commit all things into your
[47:52] hands. Now, in Jesus Christ's name we
[47:54] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[47:58] Amen.
[48:00] God bless you this morning. Thank you
[48:02] musicians.
[48:04] Certainly uh excited to be here today.
[48:07] You'll turn with me in your Bibles to
[48:09] the book of St. John
[48:12] chapter 8.
[48:17] St. John, chapter 8.
[48:24] We'll start reading with verse 31.
[48:39] and we'll go down to 36. St. John 8:31
[48:44] Then said Jesus to those Jews which
[48:47] believed on him,
[48:50] "If ye continue in my word,
[48:53] then are ye my disciples indeed
[48:58] and ye shall know the truth and the
[49:01] truth shall make you free."
[49:05] They answered him, "We be Abraham's
[49:07] seed,
[49:10] and were never in bondage to any man.
[49:13] How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?"
[49:20] Jesus answered them, "Verily, verily, I
[49:22] say unto you, whosoever committh sin is
[49:26] the servant of sin." Now, remember, sin
[49:29] truly is unbelief. Amen. We have
[49:33] attributes of unbelief. Smoking,
[49:35] drinking, carousing, rock and roll,
[49:38] movies, whatever it is, there's
[49:40] attributes of sin, but truly it's
[49:42] unbelief.
[49:46] He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[49:48] you, whosoever committh sin is the
[49:51] servant of sin. And the servant abideth
[49:54] not in the house forever, but the son
[49:57] abideth ever."
[49:59] If the Son therefore
[50:02] shall make you free, ye shall be free
[50:05] indeed.
[50:07] Let's just bow in prayer one more time.
[50:10] Heavenly Father, as we read this
[50:11] scripture, I do believe the heart of
[50:14] your children just simply says, "Amen."
[50:18] If you say it, Lord Jesus, we believe it
[50:20] and that settles it. And father, I pray
[50:23] that by the end of this service that
[50:25] somehow someway something would be said,
[50:28] Father, that would just establish this
[50:30] Lord, that it would settle it, Father,
[50:32] in our hearts that Lord, if you have
[50:35] made us free and you have told us that
[50:37] you have made us free, then we truly are
[50:40] free indeed. Lord Jesus, we just bless
[50:43] your name. We ask that you would bless
[50:44] the words that are spoken now. In Jesus
[50:47] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[50:50] bless you this morning. You may be
[50:52] seated.
[50:54] Certainly thankful to be here gathered
[50:56] together one more time in his name.
[51:01] And uh we just have a couple of notable
[51:04] mentions here today. Uh certainly like
[51:07] to welcome our visitors. Each one I
[51:10] don't know all of the visitors here, but
[51:11] I certainly am thankful that you're here
[51:14] and I trust the Lord adds a a real
[51:16] blessing to your visit today. But uh we
[51:21] have some gold in our midst. Amen.
[51:24] And uh I just would like to welcome
[51:26] warmly welcome sister Gold Kletchi.
[51:29] That's brother Paul Kletchi's wife.
[51:32] She's here from Nigeria. God bless you
[51:34] sister. Amen.
[51:42] We had a little opportunity to
[51:44] fellowship the other night and just to
[51:45] get acquainted. It sure was nice to to
[51:48] meet her and you know it's wonderful to
[51:51] hear that someone has become married and
[51:53] and had a marriage, a wedding in a
[51:55] foreign land and to hear about it and to
[51:58] ask how how's your wife after they come
[52:00] back and and how is your husband after
[52:03] they've come back and you know to
[52:05] finally get acquainted to see the actual
[52:08] person. It's a real blessing. So, God
[52:10] richly bless you. And uh and brother
[52:13] Paul, we also have an honorable mention
[52:15] here today, brother Tristan Mango. We
[52:17] have not seen him for a very long time
[52:20] and his family. God bless you, brother.
[52:23] [Applause]
[52:28] And uh of course
[52:31] our friends, our buddies, the
[52:32] Halversons. God bless you. Amen. Always
[52:35] a pleasure to have you here.
[52:38] And anyone else that is here that's a
[52:40] visitor that I I haven't mentioned,
[52:42] forgive me. I maybe don't know your
[52:45] name, but we certainly welcome you here
[52:47] in our our midst as well. We're
[52:49] certainly thankful to be gathered
[52:50] together one more time in his name. And
[52:54] uh I I just
[52:56] I got inspired this week as I was
[52:59] working. I was working with my hands.
[53:01] And sometimes it's real good just to get
[53:03] out and uh actually get active and get
[53:05] sweaty and just stretch a little bit.
[53:08] It's very important and uh I've been
[53:11] trying to express that to the boys. You
[53:12] know, it's good if you actually work uh
[53:16] in a trade for a living, but if you ever
[53:18] get injured in that trade, then you can
[53:20] be uh inhibited. It can really hold you
[53:23] back. But if you get some education
[53:26] where you have a degree in your life,
[53:29] then you don't actually have to use
[53:30] physical uh strength for your job. And
[53:34] when the time comes for evenings and
[53:36] weekends, you'll have still all of your
[53:38] strength that you can use to do the
[53:40] things that you love to do. So, it's
[53:43] kind of an interesting perspective. And
[53:45] uh I think if I ever did it all over
[53:47] again, I would probably go back to
[53:49] school and get a degree in something.
[53:51] But, you know, uh everything works
[53:53] together for the good to those who love
[53:56] the Lord and who are called according to
[53:57] his purpose. And I don't regret um a
[54:00] whole lot in my life. There's a few
[54:02] things that I do, but I'm certainly
[54:04] thankful to be able to be in the
[54:05] position that I'm in, but this week I I
[54:08] did get I did get an inspiration. And
[54:10] you know, sometimes it's just a simple
[54:13] simple thing. And when that word drops
[54:15] into your heart, I know enough now to
[54:17] just follow it. And I trust all of us
[54:19] are on the same page with that. We we
[54:21] know when the Lord speaks, we know his
[54:23] voice and we're willing to follow it.
[54:25] And you know, I was just working away
[54:27] and uh I just had this these two words
[54:30] drop into my heart and that is
[54:32] inalienable right and and it's such a
[54:37] strange thing are inalienable right? I I
[54:41] I was like man I know that we've talked
[54:43] about that but what is that? So I had to
[54:46] go and study it. You know, at the time
[54:47] it dropped into my heart. I was saw in
[54:50] hand and I had, you know, screw gun and
[54:52] screws. I was busy cutting wood and
[54:54] sawdust and sweat. But this word, these
[54:57] words just came to me. Inaliable rights.
[55:00] I thought, man, so I I I I just thought,
[55:03] you know, we'll just trust the Lord and
[55:05] walk forwards with this. And uh here we
[55:08] are today. And and it seems kind of
[55:09] strange. I know the scripture that we we
[55:11] got into in John chapter 8, but I trust
[55:13] the Lord is uh in in in control and and
[55:16] leading us here. So hopefully by the end
[55:19] of this, even in my mind, it sounds kind
[55:21] of confused, but uh somehow someway, I'm
[55:24] sure that he will tie this all together.
[55:27] So what is inaliable? We know what
[55:29] rights are. Rights. Rights are what we
[55:34] have. They're they're ours. They're our
[55:35] possession. We have the right for many
[55:38] different things in our lives. Um what
[55:41] is our right? It's not the difference
[55:43] between right and wrong. It's actually
[55:45] our possession is our rights. We we are
[55:48] entitled to a certain thing. That is our
[55:50] right. We're entitled to worship in
[55:53] freedom. We have the right to worship.
[55:56] We have the right to drive cars. We have
[55:58] the right for women to vote in our our
[56:01] country here. That that's just the way
[56:03] it is. We have rights. Uh, but what is
[56:06] the inaliable right is really what I
[56:09] wanted to get into. And uh, I don't
[56:11] think you hear much about that in the
[56:13] world. And so I looked it up and it's in
[56:15] the church age book, the exposition of
[56:16] the seven church ages. But what is
[56:19] inalienable? What does that mean? And
[56:21] and this is just so perfect. It's unable
[56:24] to be taken away. Inaliable is unable to
[56:27] be taken away from or given away by the
[56:32] possessor. So if we have an aliable
[56:35] inalienable right, we can't even give it
[56:38] away.
[56:39] And here we have a prophet messenger to
[56:43] this age saying that we have an
[56:46] inaliable right. I hope I'm saying that
[56:48] right every time. Inaliable
[56:52] there. So now every time I slur it,
[56:54] you'll understand the word inaliable.
[56:57] There's a few syllables in there. Wow.
[57:01] But what is our inaliable, right? I
[57:03] think it's so beautiful how how you know
[57:05] I I I guess the scripture is simple.
[57:07] Verse 36 of uh St. John chapter 8. If
[57:11] the son therefore shall make you free,
[57:13] ye shall be free indeed. Period. That's
[57:16] our inaliable right. We are not bound by
[57:20] this world. We're not bound by man's
[57:22] ideas or thinking. We're not bound by
[57:25] nickelan spirit. We're not bound by
[57:28] churchianity. We're not bound by any of
[57:30] this. I think it's just amazing how the
[57:33] scripture is written here. You know, in
[57:35] verse 33, they answered Jesus. They
[57:39] answered him in St. John chapter 8, they
[57:42] answered him, we be Abraham's seed and
[57:45] were never in bondage to any man. And
[57:48] I've heard people say that I've been
[57:50] raised in the message, Brother Barry.
[57:52] I've never ever had any error in my
[57:56] life.
[57:58] And I have to say, wow.
[58:01] Because we're all born in sin. We're all
[58:04] shaped in iniquity. And we all come into
[58:07] this world speaking lies. And every
[58:09] single one of us has to have a time
[58:13] where we come to know that the Lord
[58:15] Jesus Christ didn't come for mom and
[58:17] dad's religion. Didn't come for the
[58:20] church's religion. Jesus Christ came and
[58:22] died specifically for me being raised in
[58:25] the message. Amen.
[58:28] And when that happens, something
[58:30] happens. We we can become a new creature
[58:32] in Christ Jesus. But here they have the
[58:34] the answer to him after he told them,
[58:37] "Hey, you shall know the truth and the
[58:39] truth shall make you free. It's not
[58:41] going to be your religion that will make
[58:43] you free. It's not going to be the fig
[58:45] leaves that will make you free. It will
[58:48] be the truth." And what is the truth?
[58:51] I think it's so beautiful. We know that
[58:52] Pilate, we talked about this a little
[58:54] while ago. He had the truth standing
[58:56] right in front of him, the word made
[58:58] flesh. And he said, "What is truth?" How
[59:01] many of us can have the truth standing
[59:03] right in front of us and think that we
[59:05] know what truth is? But still, in a
[59:08] world of shifting sands, maybe even be
[59:11] confused about what truth is.
[59:14] But they answered him, "We be Abraham's
[59:17] seed and were never in bondage to any
[59:20] man.
[59:22] How sayest thou,
[59:25] ye shall be made free?
[59:28] Taking it and making it a total carnal
[59:30] scenario. We've never been in bondage to
[59:33] any man. These are the people that were
[59:35] delivered. The children of Israel, their
[59:37] great great great great how many
[59:38] greatgrandparents were in bondage in in
[59:42] Egypt, but not these guys. These guys
[59:44] were living in the promised land.
[59:47] They were free. But yet Jesus was
[59:50] telling them, "You're not free." And
[59:53] they knew it. Otherwise, why would they
[59:55] have said that?
[59:57] But Jesus answered and said to them,
[59:59] "Truly, truly, I say unto you, whosoever
[1:00:02] committh sin is the servant of sin." And
[1:00:04] and really, he's telling them, "If you
[1:00:06] don't believe me, believe the works that
[1:00:08] I do." Because they testify of me. They
[1:00:11] testify of who I am and where I come
[1:00:13] from. Because who else has ever done
[1:00:15] these things?
[1:00:18] Jesus answered them, "Verily, verily, I
[1:00:20] say unto you, whosoever committh sin is
[1:00:22] the servant of sin.
[1:00:25] And the servant abideth not in the house
[1:00:27] forever, but the Son abideth forever."
[1:00:30] Amen. If the Son therefore shall make
[1:00:33] you free, you shall be free indeed.
[1:00:36] Amen.
[1:00:38] So really, we need to get into the sun.
[1:00:40] We need to get into Jesus Christ. Yes.
[1:00:42] Amen. because that is where we will
[1:00:46] abide forever. Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:49] But how sayest thou?
[1:00:52] How sayest thou? Who do you say you are?
[1:00:56] Is really what they're saying to him.
[1:00:59] Who do you think you are? You're making
[1:01:01] yourself God. And we know that as he had
[1:01:03] these discussions, you can read just a
[1:01:05] little further. They picked up stones to
[1:01:07] stone him because he told them exactly
[1:01:08] who they were. Just like Cain and Abel.
[1:01:11] Abel told his brother likely, we don't
[1:01:13] know for sure. You can only surmise
[1:01:15] this. Once upon a time, Abel said, "You
[1:01:17] know what? You know who your dad is?
[1:01:19] Your dad is not my dad. Your dad is
[1:01:22] different than my dad." And he didn't
[1:01:23] like that. So what did he do? He slew
[1:01:25] him because he was of another dad.
[1:01:29] But Jesus standing here now, the word
[1:01:31] made flesh, the one who is here to set
[1:01:33] them free, tells them the same thing.
[1:01:36] And what did they do? Immediately picked
[1:01:37] up stone, said, "Who are you? How how
[1:01:39] dare you try and tell us anything about
[1:01:41] who we are. You're not even a
[1:01:44] legitimately born child.
[1:01:47] They tried to completely Amen. destroy
[1:01:51] his character. Right. But I want to talk
[1:01:54] about our inaliable right today. Inal
[1:01:57] inalienabable.
[1:01:59] Inaliable. I keep saying inaliable.
[1:02:01] Inalienabable.
[1:02:04] Inalienabable.
[1:02:06] Right. What the church had at Pentecost
[1:02:09] is her an alien abolite.
[1:02:14] This is out of the exposition of the
[1:02:16] seven church ages
[1:02:18] out of the Ephesian church age.
[1:02:21] What the church had at Pentecost is her
[1:02:25] inalienable
[1:02:26] right. So the Pentecostal experience,
[1:02:30] brothers and sisters, is our inalienable
[1:02:36] right.
[1:02:38] Originally, she had the pure word of
[1:02:41] God. She had the power of the spirit
[1:02:43] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:02:47] and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:51] So, just as a a snippet, just to get us
[1:02:53] started today, just to prime the pump,
[1:02:56] to get things going,
[1:02:59] what the church had at Pentecost is her
[1:03:04] in alienable,
[1:03:06] right? So, what did the church have at
[1:03:09] Pentecost?
[1:03:11] This is where I think we're going to get
[1:03:13] into some fun stuff. Get into some
[1:03:14] really good stuff. We can see what
[1:03:17] happened. Let's turn over to the book of
[1:03:19] Acts.
[1:03:20] just for the sake of discussion. We
[1:03:23] still have loads of time.
[1:03:26] So, let's enjoy.
[1:03:30] We have another testimony that uh was
[1:03:32] given to the church, but I'm going to
[1:03:33] read it tonight and I'll just put it in
[1:03:36] a nutshell just in celebration for the
[1:03:40] Nim.
[1:03:43] I always get the name wrong. Sister
[1:03:44] Becky and brother Joshua.
[1:03:47] She has a testimony for the uh the
[1:03:51] degree that she's been working on and uh
[1:03:53] I would like to know the degree uh what
[1:03:56] it is. I'll ask after service, but we
[1:03:58] have a testimony that we'd like to bring
[1:04:00] for that and the Lord has really blessed
[1:04:01] her and she would like to give a
[1:04:03] testimony for that and she has asked if
[1:04:05] we would actually read that. So tonight
[1:04:07] I will in our testimony service. So God
[1:04:09] bless you, Sister Becky, and we
[1:04:11] certainly thankful for the Lord's touch
[1:04:13] in your life.
[1:04:16] you know, uh, talking about this
[1:04:18] inalienable
[1:04:20] right, I would say that's one of them.
[1:04:22] Whatever it is that we put our hand to,
[1:04:25] and if we're willing to do it heartily
[1:04:27] according to the word of God, our
[1:04:29] inalienable right is that he will bless
[1:04:31] us. As long as we put him first, his
[1:04:34] word says that if you seek first the
[1:04:37] kingdom of God, Amen. If you put him
[1:04:40] first, Amen. then he will direct our
[1:04:43] paths. Thank you. Seek ye first the
[1:04:46] kingdom of God, and all the other things
[1:04:50] he'll add unto you. But if you seek the
[1:04:53] kingdom of God second and third, it's
[1:04:57] going to be pretty difficult for him to
[1:04:58] actually allow the inalienable right to
[1:05:02] manifest in our lives the way that we
[1:05:04] would like to see it. It's not going to
[1:05:06] change the fact that maybe we have
[1:05:07] salvation. that when that day comes a
[1:05:09] and perhaps we have to stand before that
[1:05:12] white throne of judgment, we still will
[1:05:15] have the ability to actually go on and
[1:05:18] and maybe hear, "Well done, thou good
[1:05:20] and faithful servant, enter into the
[1:05:22] joys of the Lord." But I don't think
[1:05:24] that's our desire here today. Our desire
[1:05:26] here today is to see a people ready for
[1:05:30] the coming of the Lord. And and I'm
[1:05:32] going to go so far as to say maybe even
[1:05:34] a little bit be a little bit brazen and
[1:05:35] bold to say not the coming of the Lord
[1:05:38] but the going of the Lord because I
[1:05:40] believe with all my heart that's already
[1:05:42] happened. And there's a lot of people
[1:05:44] that would maybe argue and say, "Brother
[1:05:46] Barry, that's not the case." But you
[1:05:48] know, we we've said it many times, he's
[1:05:50] not going to come and walk on the earth
[1:05:52] until Revelations 19, till Revelations
[1:05:55] chapter 19 takes place. He's only going
[1:05:57] to come and meet us in the clouds. We're
[1:05:59] going to leave this earth and go and
[1:06:01] meet him in the clouds. And we who are
[1:06:03] alive and remain will not hinder those
[1:06:04] who are asleep. They're going to go
[1:06:05] first, but we're going to come second.
[1:06:08] It's going to be a wonderful time. And
[1:06:09] that is really what we're looking for.
[1:06:11] That's what we're preaching towards.
[1:06:13] That is our just like Sister Becky,
[1:06:15] that's our degree. That's what we're
[1:06:17] working for. We want to get an A+ on
[1:06:20] that exam. And we're only going to know
[1:06:22] it when that time comes. But I think
[1:06:25] that we can know it while we're here as
[1:06:27] well. Thank you. But the true result
[1:06:29] will be when that time comes.
[1:06:33] I think it's just a amazing thing here.
[1:06:36] Um bear with me for one second. Out of
[1:06:38] the exposition of the seven church ages,
[1:06:41] you know, I like to look at uh the quote
[1:06:43] when we bring a quote, not just take a a
[1:06:46] few words one way and say, you know,
[1:06:49] this kind of fits the thought that I've
[1:06:51] got and and we'll just run with that.
[1:06:53] But I like to kind of go backwards and
[1:06:55] forwards and make sure that this is
[1:06:57] exactly the way that I'm I'm sort of
[1:07:00] interpreting this. And and the Lord is
[1:07:02] just so wonderful how he does this. In
[1:07:04] the exposition of the seven church ages
[1:07:07] in the Ephesian church age,
[1:07:09] did I send
[1:07:11] Oh my goodness.
[1:07:14] I do apologize. I I do this all the time
[1:07:18] and it's it's terrible. It's not right.
[1:07:22] Bear with me for a second here.
[1:07:26] In the exposition of the seven church
[1:07:27] hes,
[1:07:29] brother Brandham, he says, "Now we know
[1:07:31] exactly from the word which was recorded
[1:07:34] by the Holy Spirit how the first or
[1:07:37] original church was founded
[1:07:42] and how God manifested himself in her."
[1:07:48] Now I was uh I was listening to the last
[1:07:52] messages of 1964
[1:07:54] and brother Bradom he talks very
[1:07:56] clearly. I'm not going to bring any
[1:07:58] quotes today from that. I'll probably
[1:08:00] get into it later. Seems to be the way
[1:08:02] it goes. But brother Bradom talks about
[1:08:04] the word becoming flesh and the flesh
[1:08:06] becoming word in 1964 in a very strong
[1:08:11] direct way at the especially at the end.
[1:08:14] But you know, brother Bradam here, he
[1:08:16] says, "Now we know exactly from the word
[1:08:18] which was recorded by the Holy Spirit,
[1:08:20] how the first or original church was
[1:08:23] founded and how God manifested himself
[1:08:26] in her." Now remember what the church
[1:08:30] had at Pentecost
[1:08:32] is her inalienable
[1:08:35] right.
[1:08:37] Here we go.
[1:08:39] The word can't be changed or be changed
[1:08:45] because the word is God.
[1:08:48] And that's exactly what brother Brandham
[1:08:49] says when he says that they will never
[1:08:53] denominate this. This message will never
[1:08:57] be denominated. This message that will
[1:09:00] never be denominated is the word and
[1:09:03] it's Christ. And there's no way that you
[1:09:05] can denominate that. In the beginning,
[1:09:08] John 1:1, in the beginning was the word
[1:09:10] and the word was with God and the word
[1:09:12] was God. To change one word of it, as
[1:09:16] did Eve, brings sin and death. So if we
[1:09:20] don't listen to the words of the
[1:09:22] vindicated prophet and do some anything
[1:09:24] different than what the prophet said, do
[1:09:27] then it brings sin and death. Because a
[1:09:30] prophet isn't going to say anything
[1:09:31] other than the word of God. If he does
[1:09:32] say anything other than the word of God,
[1:09:34] he's not a prophet of God. He's a false
[1:09:36] prophet. But if he does say exactly the
[1:09:39] word of God, and he is truly a prophet
[1:09:42] sent from God, then we ought to take
[1:09:44] earnest heed and actually give ourselves
[1:09:47] over to every single word that he said.
[1:09:50] If we don't, it brings sin and death.
[1:09:51] Even as it says in Revelations 22:18 and
[1:09:54] 19, if any man shall add unto these
[1:09:57] things, God shall add unto him the
[1:09:59] plagues that are written in this book.
[1:10:01] And if any man shall take away from the
[1:10:04] words of the book of this prophecy, God
[1:10:08] shall take away his part out of the book
[1:10:10] of life and out of the holy city and
[1:10:13] from the things which are written in
[1:10:16] this book.
[1:10:19] No, nobody would want to actually have
[1:10:21] their part taken out of there. So, I
[1:10:24] just want to encourage us to not think
[1:10:25] that we can actually manipulate the word
[1:10:28] of God in any way and expect to see the
[1:10:30] blessing of God. We've got to take it
[1:10:33] the way that he's given it to us, accept
[1:10:35] it the way that he's given it to us, and
[1:10:37] trust that that is best for us. Amen.
[1:10:41] Thus, what the church was at Pentecost
[1:10:45] is the standard. Yes.
[1:10:48] What the church
[1:10:51] was at Pentecost is the standard. That
[1:10:55] is the pattern. There's no other
[1:10:57] pattern.
[1:10:59] I love it. Let's turn to Acts chapter 2
[1:11:02] and find out what is that pattern. Amen.
[1:11:05] I think we've already turned there. I
[1:11:07] trust we have. Acts chapter 2
[1:11:12] verse one.
[1:11:14] And when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:11:17] come,
[1:11:19] they were all with one accord in one
[1:11:21] place.
[1:11:24] And suddenly there came a sound from
[1:11:26] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and
[1:11:31] it filled all the house where they were
[1:11:34] sitting. Amen.
[1:11:36] And there appeared unto them cloven
[1:11:39] tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon
[1:11:42] each of them.
[1:11:45] And they were all filled with the Holy
[1:11:48] Ghost, and began to speak with other
[1:11:51] tongues, as the Spirit gave them
[1:11:54] utterance.
[1:11:57] And there were dwelling at Jerusalem
[1:11:59] Jews, devout men of every nation under
[1:12:02] heaven.
[1:12:04] Now when this was noised abroad, the
[1:12:06] multitude came together and were
[1:12:09] confounded because that every man heard
[1:12:12] them speak in his own language.
[1:12:15] And they were all amazed and marveled,
[1:12:18] saying one to another, "Behold,
[1:12:21] are not all these which speak Galileans?
[1:12:25] How do they know our language?"
[1:12:29] Because we know for the most part these
[1:12:31] disciples were ignorant and unlearned
[1:12:33] individuals.
[1:12:35] God chose them that way on purpose.
[1:12:39] But when you talk about the ina
[1:12:41] inalienable
[1:12:42] right, it's not Pentecost as a
[1:12:46] Pentecostal
[1:12:48] um denomination. We're not talking about
[1:12:50] that because brother Bradom said it very
[1:12:52] clearly that they actually got it wrong.
[1:12:55] Right? And how did they get it wrong?
[1:12:57] They put a period behind them saying
[1:13:00] when you speak in tonesues then you know
[1:13:02] you've got the Holy Ghost. That is the
[1:13:04] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:06] because you speak in tonesues. And many
[1:13:09] times what happens is that gets
[1:13:10] magnified or amplified in terms of the
[1:13:13] behavior in the church and the people in
[1:13:16] the church. And what you experience is
[1:13:18] glossalia. And we talked about that in
[1:13:21] the exposition of the seven church age
[1:13:22] study where people will just be talking.
[1:13:25] Maybe they'll be preaching. Maybe
[1:13:27] they'll be excited or sad and suddenly
[1:13:29] they'll just bust into a different
[1:13:31] tongue, an unknown tongue. And you know
[1:13:33] what happens is with glosselia, there's
[1:13:35] no interpretation of it. It's confusion.
[1:13:39] It is not according to the word of God.
[1:13:42] And you can see in the book of Acts
[1:13:44] right here what they're talking about.
[1:13:46] The word says very clearly that the men
[1:13:49] who were all around from abroad, they
[1:13:51] were from different parts. they were
[1:13:53] able to understand what was being said.
[1:13:57] So to think that you can speak in an
[1:13:58] unknown language and not have an
[1:14:00] interpretation is completely contrary to
[1:14:03] the word of God. Amen. If there's an
[1:14:06] interpretation and it's in order, we
[1:14:09] know the church has already been set in
[1:14:10] order. We're not going back to do that.
[1:14:12] What we want to do is actually get over
[1:14:14] on the launch pad because we know that
[1:14:16] this is the astronaut age. We're not
[1:14:18] looking to get comfortable down here,
[1:14:20] brothers and sisters. We know that the
[1:14:22] the world is falling apart all around
[1:14:24] us. Now the United States of America is
[1:14:27] waiting for a response from Tran. Iran
[1:14:30] from Tehran the capital of Iran. And you
[1:14:34] know what that means? Anything could
[1:14:36] happen. I would say the countdown is on.
[1:14:38] But brother Brandham said it very
[1:14:40] clearly or God said through brother
[1:14:42] Brandham that before any one of those
[1:14:43] bombs can go off,
[1:14:46] look up because your redemption is here.
[1:14:48] Brothers and sisters, it's never been
[1:14:50] closer for a real full-blown World War
[1:14:53] III to take place. I'm not trying to
[1:14:55] scare us. I'm trying to encourage us to
[1:14:57] say this is it, man. We're here.
[1:15:01] It's never been this far down the road.
[1:15:06] But the only way we're going to go in
[1:15:07] that rapture, we always come back to
[1:15:09] this, and I know maybe some people
[1:15:10] cringe at it. Maybe it's cringeworthy
[1:15:12] for some people. But if it's
[1:15:13] cringeworthy for some people for me to
[1:15:15] talk about the Holy Ghost, I want to ask
[1:15:17] you, do you really have the Holy Ghost?
[1:15:20] How could it be cringeworthy?
[1:15:22] It's the only thing for the church. The
[1:15:26] Holy Ghost is our inalienable. All
[1:15:29] right.
[1:15:31] Jesus Christ himself.
[1:15:33] outside of him. We're going to stay here
[1:15:36] and experience the temperature change,
[1:15:39] the climate change of nuclear bombs
[1:15:42] going off.
[1:15:44] That's right. People talk about climate
[1:15:46] change and will go and and beat drums
[1:15:48] about climate change. They have no idea
[1:15:51] what kind of climate change is just on
[1:15:53] the horizon. When this bride goes up,
[1:15:56] all hell is coming down.
[1:16:02] But I want to encourage us brothers and
[1:16:03] sisters to remember we have inalienable
[1:16:07] rights as believers of this word. We are
[1:16:11] not in a situation where we're just
[1:16:14] hoping so where we're just going to try
[1:16:16] this and see if it'll work. If there's
[1:16:18] something that will happen in our life.
[1:16:21] This is the truth. This is what will
[1:16:23] make us free. Many times it said that
[1:16:25] the truth will actually set us free and
[1:16:28] it will indeed set us free. But the word
[1:16:30] says that it will make us free. We will
[1:16:33] not be bound by the traditions of man.
[1:16:36] We will not be bound by the traditions
[1:16:38] of family. We will not be bound by the
[1:16:41] traditions of church. We will only be
[1:16:44] bound by the inalienable right of this
[1:16:48] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:51] He says, "Thus what the church was at
[1:16:53] Pentecost is the standard." That is the
[1:16:57] pattern. So if we have any church
[1:16:59] teaching that we should be doing
[1:17:01] anything else, it's false.
[1:17:05] We know the prophet said Mark 16, not
[1:17:08] just Mark 16, but Mark 16, what in
[1:17:12] action is the true church and all else
[1:17:15] is false. Amen. Hallelujah. So, I want
[1:17:18] to encourage us, brothers and sisters,
[1:17:20] don't get nervous when we start talking
[1:17:21] about the supernatural and we start
[1:17:23] talking about the gifts of the spirit.
[1:17:24] When we talk about the Holy Spirit, if
[1:17:26] it makes you uncomfortable, I want to
[1:17:28] say it's time to get into Christ. It's
[1:17:30] time to get the Holy Spirit. Because
[1:17:32] once you've got the Holy Spirit, it
[1:17:34] doesn't make you uncomfortable. It makes
[1:17:36] you say, "Amen. Glory to God. I'm so
[1:17:39] glad that I got it. I'm so glad that I
[1:17:42] know that I'm going to go when that
[1:17:44] rapture happens." remember brother
[1:17:46] Brandham talking to that old woman. He
[1:17:48] said, "Sister, how long has it been
[1:17:50] since you've got the Holy Ghost?" And
[1:17:52] she says, "Glory to God, brother
[1:17:54] Brandham." And I can't remember exactly
[1:17:56] how many years. It's been 45, 50 years
[1:17:59] since I got the Holy Ghost. I remember
[1:18:01] the night I remember where I was. And
[1:18:02] you know, brothers and sisters, for
[1:18:04] those people that would say, "I don't
[1:18:05] know when I got the Holy Ghost." I want
[1:18:08] to say, "Get to know when you had the
[1:18:10] Holy Ghost." Ask the Lord to show you
[1:18:13] when you got the Holy Ghost. Because if
[1:18:14] you don't know, you need to know.
[1:18:17] Brother Bradom said, "It's just like
[1:18:18] having a baby. Can a mama have a baby
[1:18:20] and just forget that I had a baby?" No,
[1:18:23] it's getting awfully quiet. I'm sorry. I
[1:18:25] don't mean to make it sound like uh just
[1:18:28] because maybe I've had an experience
[1:18:30] someone might be saying. This is what
[1:18:32] Brother Brandham said. It's like a woman
[1:18:34] having a baby. If she has a baby, can
[1:18:37] she forget what it was like to have the
[1:18:38] baby? Can she forget when she had the
[1:18:40] baby?
[1:18:42] Let's talk about that for a second. When
[1:18:44] you talk to a mom who's had a baby,
[1:18:47] maybe the baby is 45, 50 years old. You
[1:18:51] can talk to that mama. And that mama
[1:18:53] will say, "It was on this day. It was at
[1:18:55] this hospital.
[1:18:57] The weather was like this outside. I
[1:19:00] remember my husband had bad breath."
[1:19:04] The details are there, brothers and
[1:19:05] sisters. It's not like we just forget.
[1:19:08] Those things don't happen. Amen.
[1:19:12] So, I think it's amazing when the
[1:19:13] prophet of God would say, "It's just
[1:19:15] like a mama having a baby. You remember
[1:19:18] when you got the Holy Ghost." Now, I'll
[1:19:21] say it, brother, brothers and sisters,
[1:19:22] you might say, "Well, brother Barry, you
[1:19:24] came out of the world and you had such
[1:19:25] an experience or you had an experience."
[1:19:27] I'm not trying to boast anything because
[1:19:30] there was years after I came to church
[1:19:32] that I heard a conversation one time and
[1:19:35] and the conversation just sitting around
[1:19:37] fellowshipping was where a brother said,
[1:19:39] "How do you know you had the Holy
[1:19:41] Ghost?" This was to a minister and the
[1:19:44] minister said, "Brother Brandham said,
[1:19:46] when did your desires change?"
[1:19:51] Because it's not when you speak in
[1:19:52] tongues. It's not when you get
[1:19:54] gentleness, kindness, longsuffering.
[1:19:58] It's not when you actually see the
[1:20:00] individual fruit of the spirit.
[1:20:03] When did your desire change? Because
[1:20:06] that's when the experience takes place.
[1:20:09] Many times we want to say, "Wow, I had a
[1:20:12] a time where maybe something
[1:20:14] supernatural took place in my life." But
[1:20:16] it's not the case at all.
[1:20:19] Even though it is the case, and that's
[1:20:20] why brother Brandham preached the
[1:20:22] message. It's a paradox. It's something
[1:20:24] that's amazing but true. When we get the
[1:20:28] Holy Ghost, it's without sensation. But
[1:20:29] it's not without emotion. Don't do that.
[1:20:31] Don't say it's not without emotion
[1:20:32] because it is with emotion. When our
[1:20:35] desires change, something happens. Do
[1:20:37] you ever s You ever think about that
[1:20:40] song at night? I lay in bed and I cry. I
[1:20:43] I I I don't know why I lay in bed and I
[1:20:46] cry. Something happens. It's the spirit
[1:20:48] of God that's moving in in our lives.
[1:20:52] I've heard it said that uh you know
[1:20:53] tears they actually wash toxins from our
[1:20:56] body. And I don't know if that's true or
[1:20:57] not. Somebody who's in the medical
[1:20:59] profession might know that. But I just
[1:21:01] can't help but think you know for myself
[1:21:03] when that happened in my life I didn't
[1:21:05] know that that was the Holy Ghost
[1:21:06] baptism in my life. I had no idea about
[1:21:09] it. But years later of me coming to
[1:21:11] church and I firmly believe that right
[1:21:13] when I came to church I got the Holy
[1:21:15] Ghost. I picked up right where I left
[1:21:17] off with God. I said, "If you're God, be
[1:21:19] God to me." And and somebody else might
[1:21:21] have something else to say about that,
[1:21:22] and that's okay. But, you know, I know
[1:21:24] my experience. I know my redeemer lives
[1:21:27] because he made himself known personally
[1:21:29] to me in my life. But it took me
[1:21:31] probably about eight years after that to
[1:21:34] come to the conclusion that it was back
[1:21:36] there at that time. I can say that he
[1:21:40] blessed me with his Holy Ghost. Why?
[1:21:41] Because my desires changed.
[1:21:44] Not because I spoke in tongues. Not
[1:21:46] because I danced in the spirit, not
[1:21:48] because I started shouting. I never
[1:21:50] started shouting until probably about 10
[1:21:53] or 12 years after I started coming to
[1:21:56] church. And you know, brothers and
[1:21:58] sisters, it became a revelation to me.
[1:22:00] And I know some people might say,
[1:22:01] "Brother Barry, you're just a little bit
[1:22:02] loud, a little bit maybe fanatical." And
[1:22:05] I've talked about this in the past, and
[1:22:07] I I don't care. I could just be myself.
[1:22:09] I have to be myself, brothers and
[1:22:10] sisters. I'm not going to try to be
[1:22:11] anyone else. I remember standing at the
[1:22:14] back of the church and having a
[1:22:16] revelation strike my heart. The more you
[1:22:18] say amen, the more I say amen to the
[1:22:21] word of God, the more God is going to
[1:22:23] take brother Ken Ber and use him as an
[1:22:26] instrument to bless my spiritual
[1:22:29] well-being. So when I caught that
[1:22:31] revelation, brothers and sisters, I was
[1:22:32] like that John Ryan going up and down
[1:22:34] the aisles waving the hat on the cane.
[1:22:36] Although I didn't do that. I felt like
[1:22:38] it many times. But what I would do is
[1:22:40] stand right where brother Emanuel is and
[1:22:42] say, "Amen." Glory to God. Amen. And I
[1:22:46] don't care who's listening, who's
[1:22:47] watching, whatever else is going on.
[1:22:49] Because I know Brother Ken was speaking
[1:22:51] to me. It was all about me. And you
[1:22:54] know, I can't help but think because of
[1:22:55] our inalienable rights, it becomes a
[1:22:58] little bit narcissistic to this world
[1:23:01] because it's not about anybody else.
[1:23:03] It's only about me and him. Amen. Or
[1:23:07] shall we say him and I
[1:23:10] the bottom line is the twain become one.
[1:23:15] But talking about this this inalienable
[1:23:19] rights of the believer going back to the
[1:23:22] book of acts and talking about the day
[1:23:26] of Pentecost. Remember the book of acts
[1:23:28] is not the acts of the apostles. It's
[1:23:31] the acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:23:34] apostles.
[1:23:36] And we had a prophet in our day bring
[1:23:37] that to uh to our remembrance. Brother
[1:23:41] Brandham goes on to say, "Thus what the
[1:23:44] church was at Pentecost in the Ephesian
[1:23:46] church age is the standard. That is the
[1:23:49] pattern. There's no other pattern. No
[1:23:51] matter what the scholars say, God has
[1:23:54] not changed." Isn't that wonderful?
[1:23:57] No matter what the scholars say, God has
[1:24:00] not changed that pattern. what God did
[1:24:03] at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing
[1:24:07] until the church age is close.
[1:24:11] Now, some people might say, "Well,
[1:24:12] Brother Barry, we know that we've gone
[1:24:13] into the bride age. So, the seventh
[1:24:15] church age is over. That part's closed.
[1:24:17] So, maybe now things are just a little
[1:24:19] bit different than they were on the day
[1:24:21] of Pentecost." And I would say, "Hey,
[1:24:23] you know what? There's a discussion
[1:24:24] there to be had." I would say there's a
[1:24:26] discussion there to be had. But it ain't
[1:24:28] going to be going backwards. The church
[1:24:29] ain't going backwards to say now the
[1:24:31] church ages are closed. So now we don't
[1:24:33] have to have any any spiritual
[1:24:35] occurrence in our services and any
[1:24:37] supernatural experiences and all of that
[1:24:40] can be set aside. The the the fruit of
[1:24:42] the spirit and everything. No, no, no.
[1:24:44] The church isn't going to go back. The
[1:24:45] church is only going to go forward.
[1:24:47] Remember the armor of God is only for
[1:24:48] the front of the believer. It's not for
[1:24:51] the behind. So we're not going to turn
[1:24:53] back. There's no turning back. We know
[1:24:55] that in Hebrews it says those who were
[1:24:56] once enlightened and have ever tasted of
[1:24:59] the heavenly gift. For them to be
[1:25:00] renewed, if they should turn away, for
[1:25:03] them to be renewed again, it's
[1:25:06] impossible.
[1:25:08] We're not going backwards. The church is
[1:25:10] not going backwards. The church is only
[1:25:12] going forwards. That's the only thing
[1:25:14] that's going to happen. That's the only
[1:25:16] thing we have to look forward to. I I
[1:25:18] think it's so beautiful because we are
[1:25:19] truly in the astronaut age. And you
[1:25:22] know, we can say that the seventh church
[1:25:24] age is over. The Leodysian church age is
[1:25:27] over. Leodysia is the age of people's
[1:25:30] rights. And there's a lot of people that
[1:25:32] have a lot of rights in the day in which
[1:25:34] we live. And I think it's amazing when
[1:25:36] we look around and we see how many
[1:25:37] people are trying to stand up for their
[1:25:38] rights. I think it's time that we as
[1:25:41] believers ought to stand up for our
[1:25:43] rights.
[1:25:45] We ought to stand up for our rights.
[1:25:46] When we see these people trying to say
[1:25:49] that, you know, gay pride is okay and
[1:25:52] you have to accept it. That's just
[1:25:54] something that you have to accept.
[1:25:56] That's our inalienable inalienable
[1:25:58] right. Hey, if that's a law in the land,
[1:26:00] then that's great. Go for it. But that
[1:26:03] don't mean that I have to accept it. And
[1:26:05] if that's the case, the other side of
[1:26:07] the coin is you have got to accept my
[1:26:10] right to worship God in freedom of
[1:26:13] religion. Amen. And until they change
[1:26:15] that entirely, we're going to continue
[1:26:17] to do it. We have the right to believe
[1:26:21] this word.
[1:26:23] And I don't think it's something that we
[1:26:25] could ever take lightly. Sometimes that
[1:26:26] sounds crazy even to say we've got the
[1:26:29] right to believe. It's such a simple
[1:26:31] statement, isn't it? To say that we've
[1:26:33] got the right to believe. There's people
[1:26:34] that would say you don't have the right
[1:26:36] to believe. There's devils that would
[1:26:39] say you don't have the right to believe
[1:26:42] because of what you've done, because of
[1:26:44] what you haven't done, because of what
[1:26:45] you've said, because of what you've
[1:26:46] looked at. It is irrelevant, brothers
[1:26:49] and sisters. We have an inalienable
[1:26:52] right. You can't take it away from the
[1:26:54] individual. And the individual who has
[1:26:56] that right cannot actually give it away.
[1:26:59] Amen.
[1:27:01] I think it's so beautiful. You can't sin
[1:27:03] away your day of grace if you're truly
[1:27:05] elected. Now, maybe someone could pull
[1:27:07] up a quote and and challenge me on that.
[1:27:09] And if you want to, that's okay. But I
[1:27:12] want to say this. Brother Brandham said
[1:27:13] it very clearly. There was once a pastor
[1:27:15] that gave up. He threw in the towel.
[1:27:17] Something terrible must have happened
[1:27:19] for whatever the reason. He threw in the
[1:27:20] towel and he wanted his assistant, he
[1:27:22] had a garage or something and he wanted
[1:27:24] his assistant to go and get him a box of
[1:27:26] beer cuz he was just fed up with it.
[1:27:28] Forget it. Might as well just give up.
[1:27:31] And what happened was he got really
[1:27:33] angry and that young man went to get the
[1:27:35] beer. Something happened. But what
[1:27:37] happened was that man got run over that
[1:27:39] God took him home. That man did not get
[1:27:41] a chance to go and sin away his day of
[1:27:44] grace. God said it's time to come home.
[1:27:48] I believe that the truly elect will
[1:27:50] never sin away their day of grace. We
[1:27:53] can never do it even if we want to
[1:27:56] because you can't give away your
[1:27:58] inalienable right. You can't just lose
[1:28:01] it. Someone can't just take it away. And
[1:28:05] you know, it's not a human being. Satan
[1:28:06] can't take it away. Let's say it the way
[1:28:08] it is. No devil can come around and just
[1:28:11] take it away. If we've got the Holy
[1:28:13] Ghost in our life, we've got the Holy
[1:28:14] Ghost in our life till the day of our
[1:28:16] redemption, till the day we come out of
[1:28:18] the grave or till, excuse me, we meet
[1:28:20] him in the sky. Amen.
[1:28:24] I think it's so beautiful this thought
[1:28:25] about the Pentecostal the Pentecostal
[1:28:28] experience and the book of Acts here.
[1:28:30] And we know that it goes on to talk
[1:28:32] about Peter's sermon. We can jump down
[1:28:34] to verse 14 of Acts 2.
[1:28:39] We know that there are so many people
[1:28:40] from so many different locations in the
[1:28:42] world from abroad. Acts
[1:28:46] 2:14. But Peter standing up with the 11.
[1:28:50] Remember there was 120 in the room but
[1:28:52] here they had the the chosen call them
[1:28:54] the chosen the 12. Peter standing up
[1:28:58] with the 11 lifted up his voice and said
[1:29:01] unto them ye men of Judea and all ye
[1:29:05] that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[1:29:08] unto you and hearken to my words.
[1:29:12] Wow.
[1:29:14] Why would they hearken to his words?
[1:29:18] I think it's beautiful because you know
[1:29:20] what? The word that was made flesh came
[1:29:24] and dwelt among us and was split and now
[1:29:27] he sent back his holy spirit which was
[1:29:30] the earnest of our inheritance, the
[1:29:33] earnest of our salvation. Brother Bradam
[1:29:35] says it both ways in the message. The
[1:29:37] earnest of our inheritance and the
[1:29:38] earnest of our salvation.
[1:29:40] But why would the people listen to him?
[1:29:43] Why would the people listen to him?
[1:29:46] because he was filled with the Holy
[1:29:47] Ghost.
[1:29:49] It wasn't him that was speaking. But
[1:29:51] yet, people would look at him and say,
[1:29:52] "Oh, no. It's just Peter. We can see it.
[1:29:54] He's that fisherman. He's that
[1:29:56] hot-headed, temper-minded guy. We know
[1:29:58] all about him. We know his parents. We
[1:30:00] know his family. We know who this guy
[1:30:02] is. Why would we listen to him?" It's
[1:30:04] beautiful how the Lord had such a
[1:30:06] manifestation. They could speak in
[1:30:08] unknown tongues and people could
[1:30:10] understand their speech. God chose it
[1:30:13] that way on purpose so that he could
[1:30:15] attract their attention. But Peter
[1:30:17] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[1:30:19] voice and said unto them, "Ye men of
[1:30:20] Judea and all ye that dwell in
[1:30:23] Jerusalem, be this known unto you and
[1:30:26] hearken to my words. For these are not
[1:30:30] drunken as ye suppose, seeing it is but
[1:30:32] the third hour of the day." But this is
[1:30:35] that what
[1:30:37] which was spoken of by the prophet,
[1:30:41] not just spoken of in the church, not
[1:30:43] just spoken of by some theologian.
[1:30:46] It was spoken of by the prophet, wasn't
[1:30:48] it? The prophet Joel. And it shall come
[1:30:51] to pass in the last days, saith God, I
[1:30:54] will pour out of my spirit upon all
[1:30:57] flesh, and your sons and your daughters
[1:30:59] shall prophesy, and your young men shall
[1:31:01] see visions, and your old men shall
[1:31:04] dream dreams, and on my servants, and
[1:31:08] upon and on my handmaidadens I will pour
[1:31:11] out in those days of my spirit, and they
[1:31:15] shall prophesy
[1:31:18] or preach.
[1:31:20] And I will show wonders in the heaven
[1:31:22] above and signs in the earth beneath,
[1:31:24] blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
[1:31:30] Now remember that vapor of smoke bit.
[1:31:33] We're going to get into that a little
[1:31:34] bit later.
[1:31:36] I think it's just beautiful.
[1:31:39] And I'll tell you the Lord just
[1:31:41] connected that right now. I had a quote
[1:31:43] in the back and I was like scratching my
[1:31:44] head. Thank you Lord. Verse 20. The sun
[1:31:48] shall be turned to darkness and the moon
[1:31:51] into blood before the great and notable
[1:31:54] day of the Lord come. And it shall come
[1:31:57] to pass that whosoever shall call upon
[1:32:00] the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[1:32:05] It's not just going to be an
[1:32:07] association.
[1:32:09] It's not going to be joining a church.
[1:32:11] It's not going to be be even being born
[1:32:13] into a family. Even though even though
[1:32:16] parents would like to say that you know
[1:32:18] what our children will be saved because
[1:32:20] they are born into our family.
[1:32:24] Excuse me. In questions and answers,
[1:32:26] brother Brandham gets asked that
[1:32:28] question.
[1:32:30] Will our children be saved because
[1:32:32] they're born into our family? Maybe not
[1:32:34] worded exactly like that. And brother
[1:32:35] Brandham, he says no. Every single one
[1:32:39] of us has to have an experience with
[1:32:41] Christ. Amen. Just because we're born
[1:32:44] into a family does not mean we're saved,
[1:32:47] unfortunately.
[1:32:49] But it's wonderful because we have the
[1:32:51] opportunity to hold the word before our
[1:32:54] children. And we know that brother
[1:32:56] Brandham said it very clearly that if
[1:32:58] the Catholic Church gets their way,
[1:32:59] they'll hold the their word before a
[1:33:01] child. Give them up a child up to age
[1:33:04] five and they'll have them for life.
[1:33:07] They know that. Why is that? Because
[1:33:09] it's the word of God. train them up in
[1:33:11] the way they should go. By the time they
[1:33:13] hit age five, if they've had the proper
[1:33:15] training, they're going to continue on
[1:33:17] with it.
[1:33:19] So, here we have the opportunity in our
[1:33:21] lives to hold the word before our
[1:33:23] children and hope and trust and pray a
[1:33:27] lot that they will absolutely desire a
[1:33:31] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:32] themselves.
[1:33:34] But just because we're born into a a
[1:33:36] message home, it doesn't mean that we're
[1:33:39] actually elected.
[1:33:42] It sounds scary to say, but it's very
[1:33:44] true. We need to make sure that we know
[1:33:47] we have our own experience with the
[1:33:49] Lord.
[1:33:51] Going on, brother Bradam talks about
[1:33:52] this in uh in the exposition of the
[1:33:56] seven church ages.
[1:34:00] I think this is going backwards.
[1:34:03] He talks about uh though scholars may
[1:34:07] tell you the apostolic age is over,
[1:34:10] don't you believe it.
[1:34:13] Such a statement is wrong on two counts.
[1:34:18] First of all, it's wrong to suppose
[1:34:21] there aren't any more apostles
[1:34:24] just because the original 12 are dead.
[1:34:27] And I love how he talks about this.
[1:34:29] There are definitely offices. There's a
[1:34:32] five-fold ministry and and the apostles
[1:34:35] still a part of the church.
[1:34:37] It's it's wrong, he says, to assume that
[1:34:39] there aren't more apostles just because
[1:34:41] the original 12 are dead. He says an
[1:34:43] apostle means a sentent one. And there
[1:34:46] are many sent ones today, but they are
[1:34:49] are called missionaries. And as long as
[1:34:52] men are being called and sent forth with
[1:34:54] the word of life, there is an apostolic
[1:34:57] age going on. And brother Brham talks
[1:34:59] about the apostle very specifically in
[1:35:02] the message if you look up apostle. Uh
[1:35:04] you can see it in in the five-fold
[1:35:06] ministry and the position of it. And uh
[1:35:08] it's just wonderful because the age of
[1:35:11] the apostles has not ceased. It will
[1:35:14] cease at a certain time but it's not
[1:35:16] right now. It's not this time. It's
[1:35:18] actually when the church goes up. Then
[1:35:20] you can say that it's going to change.
[1:35:22] Secondly, they refer to an age of
[1:35:26] manifested Holy Ghost power as being
[1:35:29] over.
[1:35:31] Can you believe that?
[1:35:33] It just takes the power of God and
[1:35:35] grounds it right out. We all might might
[1:35:38] as well just have fig leaves when we
[1:35:40] come to church. Everyone just puts on
[1:35:42] the exact same garment and comes in with
[1:35:44] their uniform on and we say our amens
[1:35:46] and we sing our songs and then we maybe
[1:35:49] take a wafer and and and the priest will
[1:35:51] take a shot for you and everyone can go
[1:35:53] home and call him an Uber at the end of
[1:35:55] the service because of all the wine that
[1:35:57] he's drank. And we know that that's
[1:36:00] actually it sounds funny but that's
[1:36:02] actually the way it's done in some
[1:36:03] churches. He says, "Secondly, they refer
[1:36:06] to an age of manifested Holy Ghost power
[1:36:09] as being over since the Bible has been
[1:36:11] completed." That is untrue. There is not
[1:36:14] even one scripture that suggests that,
[1:36:18] but many conclusively state the
[1:36:21] otherwise.
[1:36:23] Here is our proof that both of these
[1:36:28] charges are false. Acts 2 38-39.
[1:36:35] And if you have the book of Acts open,
[1:36:37] chapter 2, you can just read that. 38
[1:36:39] says, "Then Peter said unto them, repent
[1:36:42] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[1:36:44] the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:36:48] And and it's interesting because what is
[1:36:50] the name of Jesus Christ? Father,
[1:36:53] the name of Jesus Christ, son, or the
[1:36:57] name of Jesus Christ, Holy Ghost. It
[1:36:59] doesn't add up.
[1:37:01] Everyone should be baptized in the name
[1:37:03] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:37:05] your sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[1:37:07] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[1:37:09] unto you and to your children, and to
[1:37:11] all that are a far off, even as many as
[1:37:13] the Lord our God shall call. The trouble
[1:37:15] with this is many people get baptized
[1:37:18] not in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:20] for the remission of their sins. They
[1:37:21] get baptized in the name of the father
[1:37:23] and of the son and of the holy ghost and
[1:37:25] truly believe that they go on to the
[1:37:26] baptism of the holy ghost because of an
[1:37:29] experience that happens in their life.
[1:37:31] And when that happens, they are
[1:37:32] deceived.
[1:37:34] They're able to be partakers of that
[1:37:36] same heavenly rain that falls down. It's
[1:37:39] the former rain and the latter rain
[1:37:41] coming together. It's the harvest rain
[1:37:43] that takes place at the final maturing
[1:37:46] of the crop. And the people all cry out
[1:37:48] at the same time, "Glory to God. Glory
[1:37:51] to God." We could see the blessing of
[1:37:53] God. We could see the supernatural
[1:37:55] experience. We could see people speak in
[1:37:56] tongues. We could even see
[1:37:58] interpretations. We could even see many
[1:38:00] signs and wonders in the church. But
[1:38:02] have they followed the original
[1:38:04] instruction to get baptized in the name
[1:38:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ? If they
[1:38:09] haven't, then they've missed it. Now, I
[1:38:11] know I'm preaching to the choir here,
[1:38:12] but perhaps there will be someone
[1:38:14] listening right now. Or maybe there will
[1:38:16] be someone listening afterwards that
[1:38:18] doesn't actually have a true baptism in
[1:38:20] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:21] according to Acts 2:38.
[1:38:24] Maybe they have a baptism according to
[1:38:26] some other teaching.
[1:38:29] Why not give it a try? Why not see if
[1:38:32] God is real?
[1:38:35] I know why people are afraid. They're
[1:38:39] afraid.
[1:38:40] I mean, seriously, what do we have to
[1:38:42] lose? If we do argue this, what is there
[1:38:45] to lose? What is there to lose? I'll
[1:38:47] tell you what there is to lose. There's
[1:38:49] a devil who has a position in a person's
[1:38:51] life. A devil's comfortable right where
[1:38:53] he's at. And he knows full well that if
[1:38:55] that person takes a true baptism
[1:38:57] according to the apostles instruction on
[1:39:00] the day of Pentecost, that devil has to
[1:39:02] go. He no longer has a right to that
[1:39:05] ground. Amen. And that's why so many
[1:39:09] people are so adamantly against getting
[1:39:12] baptized again in the name of the Lord
[1:39:15] Jesus Christ. For goodness sake, what do
[1:39:17] we have to lose?
[1:39:21] Right? I'll tell you what, you have your
[1:39:24] inalienable right. Because until you get
[1:39:27] that baptism of the Holy Ghost, brothers
[1:39:28] and sisters, you don't have an
[1:39:30] inalienable right. That's right. The
[1:39:34] devil has all the rights. But I want to
[1:39:36] encourage anyone who would hear my voice
[1:39:38] today. Take those rights back.
[1:39:42] Take them back. Once you've got them, he
[1:39:45] can never take them away.
[1:39:47] Amen. He says, "Here is our proof that
[1:39:50] both of these charges are false." Acts
[1:39:52] 2:38-39.
[1:39:53] Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[1:39:55] be baptized, every one of you, in the
[1:39:57] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:39:58] of sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[1:40:00] of the Holy Ghost. for the promise is
[1:40:02] unto you and to your children and all
[1:40:04] that are a far off, even as many as the
[1:40:07] Lord our God shall call. And I can't
[1:40:09] help but think it's just beautiful, you
[1:40:11] know, when we have children that maybe
[1:40:13] grow up and then they grow astray, they
[1:40:15] they go weward, have they been baptized
[1:40:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? If
[1:40:20] they have been, they have an al
[1:40:22] inalienable rights. Amen. And I can't
[1:40:26] help but think that we as parents have
[1:40:27] the ability to pour our prayers on those
[1:40:30] inalienable rights to see the promise of
[1:40:34] power come back into their life. It's
[1:40:36] got to be at the time appointed of the
[1:40:38] father. It's got to be at the time that
[1:40:40] becomes real to the individual. We can
[1:40:42] try and make it real to them all we want
[1:40:45] all of their life, but it will never
[1:40:47] ever happen until God reveals himself
[1:40:51] personally to the individual. And when
[1:40:53] that time comes, when that happens,
[1:40:55] there ain't nobody that can ever talk it
[1:40:57] out of them. Amen. The promise of power
[1:41:00] which the apostles were endued at
[1:41:03] Pentecost is to you Jews and to your
[1:41:08] children Jews and to all that are a far
[1:41:12] off Gentiles and to as many as the Lord
[1:41:15] our God shall call both Jew and Gentile.
[1:41:20] Until he stops calling the Pentecostal
[1:41:23] message and power will not cease. Amen.
[1:41:28] Isn't that beautiful, brothers and
[1:41:29] sisters? When is he going to stop
[1:41:31] calling? When he closes the door, not
[1:41:35] for the marriage. When he closes the
[1:41:37] door for the wedding supper, because the
[1:41:40] wedding is taking place now. The wedding
[1:41:43] is happening now. This is the time to
[1:41:46] take that wedding band of unmmerited
[1:41:48] grace and say, "Be it unto me, Lord,
[1:41:51] according to thy word." And where is his
[1:41:53] word going to come from? It's going to
[1:41:54] come from a vindicated prophet. And then
[1:41:56] where is that word going to come from
[1:41:57] when God takes that vindicated prophet
[1:41:59] home? It's going to come from the
[1:42:00] five-fold ministry that's saying what's
[1:42:02] already said. Just like he said in the
[1:42:05] book of Acts, Peter spoke the words that
[1:42:07] were already spoken by the prophet Joel.
[1:42:11] It's not going to be a new word, but
[1:42:13] it's going to happen in such a way that
[1:42:14] it's going to sound like a new word
[1:42:16] because all of the religion that's going
[1:42:19] to be spread all over the world is going
[1:42:21] to sound different than the original
[1:42:24] word. But that's what the prophets did
[1:42:26] throughout every single church age.
[1:42:28] Isn't it? They cried, "Get back to the
[1:42:30] word." They cried, "Get back in line."
[1:42:33] They said, "Forget about the church
[1:42:35] teachings and get back to the original."
[1:42:39] That oldtime religion. We sang that
[1:42:41] song, brothers and sisters. I hope we
[1:42:43] can sing it today. That oldtime
[1:42:45] religion, because that's the only thing
[1:42:46] that's going to start the devil flying
[1:42:49] is to have a good old backwood
[1:42:51] sinkilling preaching service. talking
[1:42:54] about the Holy Ghost and the baptism of
[1:42:57] fire in the lives of God's children.
[1:43:00] Who wants to just have a church service
[1:43:02] where we talk about the mysteries where
[1:43:05] it's mysterious and we have to be
[1:43:07] intellectual and we have all of the
[1:43:10] theory just nailed down and I've got all
[1:43:12] the quotes to support my ideas and all
[1:43:15] of the ideas to support the quotes. All
[1:43:18] of that is good for nothing if we don't
[1:43:20] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:23] There's a place for that. But let's get
[1:43:26] Jesus Christ front and center. This is
[1:43:29] all about him. Amen.
[1:43:32] And I say, forgive us, Lord, if we make
[1:43:34] it anything else.
[1:43:38] Sometimes we can,
[1:43:41] sometimes we can make it about our
[1:43:43] church. Sometimes we can make it about
[1:43:44] our traditions. Sometimes we can make it
[1:43:47] even about our own ideas. But I just
[1:43:50] like to make it about what the prophet
[1:43:51] said. Get right back to what brother
[1:43:53] Brandham said. Because what Brad,
[1:43:55] brother Brandham was saying wasn't what
[1:43:56] he was saying. It was what God was
[1:43:58] saying through him. He told him to go
[1:44:00] and store up food for a season. It
[1:44:02] wasn't so that he could store up food
[1:44:04] for Brandham Tabernacle in in
[1:44:06] Jeffersonville, Indiana, even though it
[1:44:08] was. It wasn't so that he could store up
[1:44:10] food for Tucson Tabernacle in Arizona,
[1:44:13] even though it was. It was so that their
[1:44:16] sons and daughters of God later on that
[1:44:18] needed to hear the word of God in season
[1:44:20] could actually hear that stored up food.
[1:44:23] That's what it was for.
[1:44:26] And here we are, brothers and sisters.
[1:44:28] Isn't it beautiful
[1:44:30] talking about the the day of Pentecost
[1:44:31] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:44:34] and and how we have such a wonderful
[1:44:38] thing that we can look at here in in in
[1:44:41] Acts chapter 2 verse one. And when the
[1:44:43] day of Pentecost was fully come, they
[1:44:45] were all with one accord in one place. I
[1:44:49] think it's beautiful. You know, brother
[1:44:50] Brandham preaches and he teaches over
[1:44:53] and over again about the one place
[1:44:56] that's God's provided place of worship,
[1:44:58] doesn't he? And many people, they got
[1:45:01] hung up on all kinds of other things
[1:45:03] that people were saying, even in and
[1:45:05] around the message. Isn't it astounding
[1:45:07] when you really think about it? If you
[1:45:08] haven't heard it for a while, just go
[1:45:10] and listen to Questions and Answers in
[1:45:11] 1964 and hear Brother Brandham answer
[1:45:13] the question over and over and over. And
[1:45:17] you can tell he's getting exasperated
[1:45:19] himself and over again. We hear that the
[1:45:22] rapture is going to happen in Arizona.
[1:45:24] Should we all pack up and move out to
[1:45:26] Arizona? He says, "No, no, the rapture
[1:45:30] is going to be universal. It's going to
[1:45:31] happen all around the world. Don't move
[1:45:33] out to Arizona. But if you want to move
[1:45:35] out to Arizona because you like the
[1:45:36] desert, you like the arid environment,
[1:45:39] if you like the heat, by all means come.
[1:45:40] He says, "We could be neighbors. You
[1:45:42] could come and live here. It would be
[1:45:44] wonderful. By all means, but to think
[1:45:45] that the rapture is going to take place
[1:45:47] there, don't do it." And and he says it
[1:45:49] over and over and over. Question after
[1:45:52] question is given to him. Questions and
[1:45:53] answers. The page with someone's
[1:45:55] handwriting. Will the rapture take place
[1:45:57] in Arizona? Will the rapture take place
[1:45:59] out in Arizona? And then they go on to,
[1:46:01] "Why are you going back to Arizona after
[1:46:04] the seals have already been opened?" And
[1:46:05] he says, "You have to just trust me. I
[1:46:07] can't tell you everything. You have to
[1:46:10] trust me." And and it's interesting
[1:46:12] because if he didn't go out to Arizona,
[1:46:14] he wouldn't have been in a car crash,
[1:46:16] would he?
[1:46:18] And we know that it wasn't that car
[1:46:19] crash that took his life, was it? It was
[1:46:22] God that took his life in the hospital
[1:46:26] under full supervision and care of the
[1:46:28] medical profession. But God took his
[1:46:30] prophet off the scene. It wasn't just an
[1:46:32] accident. There's no accidents that
[1:46:34] happen.
[1:46:36] But should we move to Arizona because
[1:46:38] the rapture is going to take place? No.
[1:46:41] Don't do it. But what I'm getting at,
[1:46:44] brothers and sisters, is how people can
[1:46:45] talk outside of church and have
[1:46:49] conversations and hear something and it
[1:46:51] becomes fanatical.
[1:46:54] It can become something really
[1:46:55] interesting to talk about. And that can
[1:46:57] actually spin off into something that
[1:46:59] causes people to say, "Well, it makes
[1:47:01] perfect sense. We should do that. That's
[1:47:03] God's prophet. He's out there. There's
[1:47:04] going to be a rapture that's going to
[1:47:06] take place and we should go there, but
[1:47:09] listen to what he says."
[1:47:11] And you know what's funny in a in a
[1:47:14] super sad way is they didn't listen to
[1:47:16] what he said. They did it anyway. And at
[1:47:19] one point he said, "Don't do it because
[1:47:21] the the people out there are going to
[1:47:22] gather together and they're not going to
[1:47:24] be able to have work. There's going to
[1:47:25] be so many people there. They're not
[1:47:26] going to be able to provide for their
[1:47:27] families, which means they're going to
[1:47:29] be worse than an infidel. And that
[1:47:30] they've denied the faith. Amen. That's
[1:47:32] what it means if we don't provide for
[1:47:33] our families naturally and spiritually
[1:47:37] worse than an infidel and have denied
[1:47:40] the faith. But they got there and they
[1:47:41] did that and they had so many people
[1:47:42] there. Brother Bradom said, "What's
[1:47:44] going to happen is you're going to come
[1:47:45] out there and then you're going to have
[1:47:46] to actually go to the welfare because
[1:47:48] people are going to need to eat. People
[1:47:50] are going to need housing. They're going
[1:47:51] to need they're going to be needy people
[1:47:53] because you have so many people go
[1:47:55] there." And he said, "You know what? The
[1:47:56] news cameras are just going to be
[1:47:58] waiting for you to do that so they can
[1:48:01] say this man, William Brandom, is a
[1:48:03] false prophet. He's a charlatan." He
[1:48:05] said, "Don't do it."
[1:48:08] My point is, we need to listen to what
[1:48:10] the prophet said.
[1:48:13] Not some of it, not the part that feels
[1:48:15] good, especially the part that doesn't
[1:48:17] feel good, because that's the part
[1:48:18] that's going to change us and help us.
[1:48:24] talking about Pentecost.
[1:48:27] That is our inalienable right, brothers
[1:48:30] and sisters. I'm going to summarize it
[1:48:32] there right now as we shift to third
[1:48:34] gear and we're going to stomp on the gas
[1:48:37] and we're going to drop the clutch.
[1:48:39] Third gear. Pentecost is our inalienable
[1:48:44] right. Brother Brandham says that
[1:48:46] Pentecost is not a denomination. It is
[1:48:50] an experience
[1:48:52] just like they had in the acts of the
[1:48:55] Holy Ghost in the apostles. We ought to
[1:48:59] see the exact same thing in our lives.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. And I want to encourage us
[1:49:04] today more than ever, brothers and
[1:49:06] sisters. And remember, when brother
[1:49:07] Barry's preaching, he's preaching to
[1:49:08] himself. God is speaking to me also.
[1:49:13] Let's dedicate ourselves even further to
[1:49:15] the Lord. Who wants to dedicate yourself
[1:49:16] even further to the Lord? Even more so
[1:49:19] as you see that day approaching. We know
[1:49:21] the rapture hasn't taken place yet, has
[1:49:23] it? Is anybody missing here?
[1:49:27] Brother Brandham says scarcely even a
[1:49:29] dozen people from this generation. Would
[1:49:32] we even know it?
[1:49:35] He also says in a city of a million
[1:49:37] people, let it be you. You be that one
[1:49:40] person in the message, one in a million.
[1:49:43] Let it be you. be that one in a million
[1:49:45] that's crying out, "Lord,
[1:49:48] save me. Save my family."
[1:49:52] Now, I know there's some that would say,
[1:49:54] "Well, Brother Barry, if I'm elect, then
[1:49:56] I can't be lost. It's my inalienable
[1:49:58] right. I can't be lost." Nope. You can't
[1:50:01] be.
[1:50:03] But we're not going to deny the faith
[1:50:04] either.
[1:50:06] We're not going to take the grace of God
[1:50:08] and turn it into disgrace and say, "I
[1:50:10] don't have to go to church. I don't have
[1:50:12] to pay my tithe. I don't have to act and
[1:50:14] live as a believer. Ah, you know what?
[1:50:16] Communion service, it's just once in a
[1:50:18] while. It doesn't matter. It doesn't
[1:50:19] matter whether I go to communion
[1:50:21] service. It doesn't matter whether I
[1:50:22] wash feet. That's pretty gross anyways.
[1:50:24] Why would I ever do that? You know why?
[1:50:27] Because if God himself made flesh, came
[1:50:30] down and dwelt amongst us. And he did
[1:50:32] it. And he said, "Do you know what's
[1:50:34] happened here?" I don't think you know
[1:50:35] what's happened here. Let me tell you
[1:50:37] what's happened here. The reason I did
[1:50:39] this is to show you absolute humility.
[1:50:43] If I can do this, then how much more
[1:50:46] ought you do it one to another? And he
[1:50:49] said, you know what? If you do these
[1:50:50] things, then you're happy.
[1:50:53] I can't help but think that's why we got
[1:50:55] so many miserable people around here.
[1:50:57] We're not washing one another's feet.
[1:50:59] We're not following the full instruction
[1:51:01] of what the Lord gave us. That's not
[1:51:04] even the prophet. It's the Lord. Jesus
[1:51:07] Christ said it. Amen. Oh, but a
[1:51:10] theologian said, you know, who does
[1:51:12] that? That's weird, man. Only William
[1:51:13] Brham did that. Or maybe some fanatical
[1:51:15] brethren somewhere along the way. Some
[1:51:18] sort of fanatical thing. They they're
[1:51:20] the only ones that do that. You know,
[1:51:22] you can just take communion once in a
[1:51:23] while. It doesn't matter. It does. He's
[1:51:27] very much into the details. He's very
[1:51:29] much into his word. That's what God is
[1:51:32] into. Children that obey his word. How
[1:51:35] many parents like that in their
[1:51:37] children? I would say every single
[1:51:39] parent that is in the building. When our
[1:51:41] children are told something by us and
[1:51:43] they just obey it, it makes us happy as
[1:51:46] parents. How much more the Lord when we
[1:51:48] obey his word.
[1:51:51] Pentecost is our inalienable right and
[1:51:56] it's a type of the jubilee. And the
[1:51:58] jubilee we know full well it marked 49
[1:52:01] days after the resurrection.
[1:52:03] Jubilee is actually the year
[1:52:07] of freedom, isn't it? We could be bound
[1:52:11] as a slave. Maybe our parents made
[1:52:14] really bad financial decisions.
[1:52:15] Remember, this is true. This is the way
[1:52:17] it was once upon a time. Our parents
[1:52:19] could make really bad financial
[1:52:20] decisions. They could actually do things
[1:52:22] that were wrong in society and we would
[1:52:25] actually not be able to pay the bill.
[1:52:27] Just don't have the money because I I
[1:52:29] wasn't smart enough to do anything to
[1:52:31] lay up for my future. even for my
[1:52:34] children. So what happens is when you
[1:52:36] have to go to court and actually make an
[1:52:38] appearance and stand and and give a
[1:52:41] reason for your behavior and you don't
[1:52:43] have the money to pay the bill, when the
[1:52:44] judgment comes down, if they say you owe
[1:52:46] this much money, what would happen is
[1:52:48] your children, your family would be
[1:52:50] given over to slavery, they would be
[1:52:52] given to cover the debt because of your
[1:52:56] mistake. Maybe it was a mistake, but the
[1:52:58] mistake wouldn't be that you didn't
[1:53:00] store up food. You didn't store up
[1:53:02] money. But here we have the the type of
[1:53:06] Pentecost is a type of Jubilee, marking
[1:53:08] 49 days after the resurrection. The year
[1:53:11] of Jubilee was 50 years. And all of the
[1:53:13] slaves, anyone who had land deals that
[1:53:16] went bad. Anyone who was a slave, when
[1:53:18] that Jubilee trumpet blew, they could
[1:53:20] just go free. They could throw down
[1:53:23] their rakes. They could throw down their
[1:53:24] hoes. They could undo the chains, their
[1:53:28] bondage. They could just go free. They
[1:53:30] could go back to where they came from.
[1:53:32] But remember, brother Bradam, he talks
[1:53:34] about it, how there is slaves. They were
[1:53:36] happy being slaves. They were just happy
[1:53:39] in their position. Their task masters
[1:53:42] were really kind to them. And you know,
[1:53:44] I'll say this, brothers and sisters,
[1:53:45] it's very important to remember. We can
[1:53:48] go one way or the other. We can say a
[1:53:49] vow of poverty. Oh my, that's God's
[1:53:53] blessing in my life. Or we can say,
[1:53:55] "Hey, you know what? God's opened the
[1:53:56] windows of heaven and poured out a
[1:53:58] financial blessing that I can't hardly
[1:53:59] contain. I don't know where to invest it
[1:54:01] all. I don't know what to do with all
[1:54:02] this money." One way or the other can be
[1:54:05] wrong, but the life of a believer is
[1:54:08] going to be right down the middle. Amen.
[1:54:12] We can make God's grace a disgrace if
[1:54:15] we're not careful. And you know, I I
[1:54:18] just can't help but think we have been
[1:54:20] given the Jubilee trumpet in the day in
[1:54:22] which we live. Back then when the
[1:54:23] Jubilee trumpet blew, they could choose
[1:54:25] to walk away from their taskmaster,
[1:54:28] their owner, and go back home to their
[1:54:30] parents and go home and be free. They
[1:54:32] could do that and never have to go back
[1:54:34] to be a slave again. But sometimes maybe
[1:54:36] they would say, "You know what? That
[1:54:38] that taskmaster, that that slave owner,
[1:54:40] my owner was actually better than my
[1:54:43] parents. They had more money than my
[1:54:44] parents did. I I actually eat better
[1:54:46] food when I live there than when I do
[1:54:48] with my parents. Everything is better."
[1:54:50] Maybe they let me listen to music. Maybe
[1:54:52] they let me do all these different
[1:54:53] things. Maybe life is just better on the
[1:54:56] other side. You know what happened was?
[1:54:58] They had to be taken down. They could
[1:54:59] make that choice, but they were taken
[1:55:01] down to the temple and they had to take
[1:55:02] a an all and bore them in the ear and
[1:55:06] and mark them forever now to be a slave
[1:55:08] and they were never able to leave the
[1:55:10] slavery that they were under, the
[1:55:11] bondage that they were under. They were
[1:55:12] bound to that forever. Brother Brandham,
[1:55:14] he says it just to fast forward and make
[1:55:16] it quick. He says it that in the day in
[1:55:18] which we live right now when we hear
[1:55:19] this Jubilee trumpet to say that we have
[1:55:22] an inalienable right and that is the
[1:55:23] Holy Ghost that is Pentecost our
[1:55:25] Pentecostal experience when we scoff at
[1:55:27] it and say I've heard it before I I
[1:55:29] don't need to hear that. What happens is
[1:55:31] we can have a spiritual all pierce our
[1:55:35] spiritual ear our eardrum. Brother
[1:55:37] Bradom says this and we will never be
[1:55:39] able to hear this gospel again. Every
[1:55:41] single time it comes across our path
[1:55:43] we'll just be mute to it. will be like,
[1:55:45] "Yep, whatever. I've heard it before.
[1:55:48] Get the duty done. We'll be able to just
[1:55:50] go home and we'll just come back next
[1:55:52] week and it'll just be our duty, our
[1:55:53] civic, religious duty. It'll just be the
[1:55:55] same thing over and over again." It's
[1:55:57] the definition of insanity, brothers and
[1:55:58] sisters. Who wants to live that way as a
[1:56:01] believer? I'm trying to encourage us to
[1:56:03] go all the way and see this Pentecostal
[1:56:06] blessing in our life. It is a type of
[1:56:08] the jubilee and it marks our freedom.
[1:56:12] It marks absolute freedom. It marks our
[1:56:14] inalienable
[1:56:16] right to every single word of God in the
[1:56:20] Bible. And you know, brother Brandham,
[1:56:21] he says that it's the earnest of our
[1:56:24] salvation, which is the down payment,
[1:56:28] the spirit that he gave back to the
[1:56:30] church after he destroyed his body,
[1:56:32] allowed his body to be destroyed by all
[1:56:35] the devils in the men when he went to
[1:56:37] Calvary, just about killed him before he
[1:56:39] even made it to the cross. That was for
[1:56:42] a purpose. It was so that his spirit
[1:56:44] could come back from the throne unto his
[1:56:47] men. He never left us comfortless, did
[1:56:50] he? He said he wouldn't. He said that I
[1:56:52] won't leave you comfortless. I will send
[1:56:55] you the comforter. I will send you the
[1:56:58] teacher. I will send you myself.
[1:57:03] He is the earnest of our salvation.
[1:57:07] The Holy Spirit, the word, the message.
[1:57:10] It's the earnest of our salvation. And
[1:57:12] it's the earnest of our inheritance. And
[1:57:15] I can't help but think that, you know,
[1:57:17] Jesus, he said it in one place in the
[1:57:19] word that his inheritance, he has an
[1:57:22] inheritance. And that we actually are
[1:57:25] his inheritance. We talk about our
[1:57:27] inheritance many times, but isn't it
[1:57:29] wonderful to think about his
[1:57:31] inheritance? His inheritance are all of
[1:57:34] the believers, the body of Christ. 50
[1:57:37] years is a jubilee. And that sound of
[1:57:39] the Jubilee trumpet, brothers and
[1:57:40] sisters, is a sign of freedom.
[1:57:44] And I can't help but think, you know,
[1:57:48] the earnest,
[1:57:50] if you look it up in the message, this
[1:57:52] is where the Lord was really dealing
[1:57:54] with me today. I think it's just so
[1:57:55] beautiful. I hadn't seen this before. If
[1:57:58] you look up earnest, remember it's the
[1:58:00] down payment, right? It's the down
[1:58:02] payment. In the message, type in the
[1:58:04] word earnest. See for yourself. It's
[1:58:08] interesting because it's not mentioned
[1:58:10] past 1963.
[1:58:13] The word earnest. Now, is that a
[1:58:15] coincidence?
[1:58:17] Why is there no more a down payment?
[1:58:21] I can't help but think that there's
[1:58:22] something really significant about that.
[1:58:25] I mean, really significant. I've said it
[1:58:27] many times, but I've never seen it so
[1:58:28] completely clearly as I do today. And
[1:58:31] some people might be saying, "Brother
[1:58:32] Barry, yeah, you're really going
[1:58:33] fanatical, and maybe there's something
[1:58:34] wrong with me, but I'm pretty happy this
[1:58:36] way." me. So, just leave me alone if
[1:58:38] that's the case. But I I was looking it
[1:58:40] up and and and earnest, the word earnest
[1:58:43] is not mentioned past 1963 in the
[1:58:46] message. And I can't help but think,
[1:58:47] brothers and sisters, as we try and draw
[1:58:49] this up here, maybe hit the hit the gas
[1:58:52] pedal a little bit. I can't help but
[1:58:54] think that this is exactly 1 Corinthians
[1:58:56] chapter 13
[1:58:59] verse 9. For we know in part and we
[1:59:01] prophesy in part. This is the church
[1:59:04] knowing in part and prophesying in part.
[1:59:07] What happened in 1963, brothers and
[1:59:09] sisters?
[1:59:10] Some people would say, "Well, there was
[1:59:12] a mysterious cloud." Some people would
[1:59:14] say, "Well, there was a tremendous
[1:59:16] opportunity in the church where brother
[1:59:18] Brandham, he he had some tremendous
[1:59:20] meetings in in Jeffersonville, Indiana."
[1:59:23] And some people would say that six of
[1:59:25] the seals were open. And some people
[1:59:26] would say, "Well, all seven seals were
[1:59:28] open." open. And some people would say,
[1:59:29] "Well, Brother Brandham said that all
[1:59:31] six were open, but not the seventh one."
[1:59:33] It was never completely explained. But
[1:59:35] if you follow the message all the way
[1:59:36] through, you'll hear him say, "Those
[1:59:38] seven seals, not those six seals." So, I
[1:59:41] can't help but think that it's all seven
[1:59:42] seals were open in 1963. And why is it
[1:59:46] that he doesn't talk about the earnest
[1:59:48] anymore after 1963?
[1:59:52] For we know in part and prophesy in part
[1:59:54] in part, sorry, excuse me. 1 Corinthians
[1:59:57] chapter 13 10 says, "But when that which
[2:00:00] is perfect is come, then that which is
[2:00:03] in part shall be done away."
[2:00:07] So what's going on after 1963, brothers
[2:00:10] and sisters? What took place in 1963?
[2:00:14] When I was a child, I spake as a child
[2:00:17] and I understood as a child. And we know
[2:00:19] we can talk about this in the natural
[2:00:21] realm. We play with cars and balls and
[2:00:23] dolls and and dresses and and babies and
[2:00:26] and little bottles and prams and and we
[2:00:29] carry on as children when we're
[2:00:30] children. But then when we mature, all
[2:00:33] of that stuff gets put away and maybe it
[2:00:35] gets saved for other children that come
[2:00:36] to visit us. But what happens is we
[2:00:39] begin to become an adult and adult
[2:00:41] things tend to actually capture our
[2:00:44] attention a little more.
[2:00:47] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[2:00:49] I understood as a child. I thought as a
[2:00:53] child. Spiritually speaking, it's the
[2:00:56] same way. Brothers and sisters,
[2:00:58] spiritually speaking, it's the same way.
[2:01:00] And I know some people will be saying,
[2:01:01] "Well, you're not talking mysteries.
[2:01:02] You're not talking seals. You're not
[2:01:03] talking all of the things in the
[2:01:06] message." You know, that's not what the
[2:01:08] message is about. It's not come to
[2:01:11] create a mystery. It's come to reveal
[2:01:14] the mystery.
[2:01:16] The mystery of Jesus Christ, the
[2:01:19] revelation of Jesus Christ. That is what
[2:01:22] all of the seals are all about. That's
[2:01:24] what 1963 was about, brothers and
[2:01:26] sisters. I can't help but think 1963 was
[2:01:29] the true Jubilee trumpet being sounded
[2:01:33] through the preaching of the seven
[2:01:36] seals.
[2:01:37] Now, maybe we could say it this way.
[2:01:40] Amen. The revealing, the revealing, the
[2:01:43] actual speaking to the revealing of
[2:01:46] those seven unknown thunders
[2:01:51] were contained where
[2:01:53] in the seals.
[2:01:55] They were preached for a reason. So that
[2:01:59] there's no more mysteries. So why would
[2:02:01] we preach mysteries, brothers and
[2:02:03] sisters? It doesn't make sense. It's
[2:02:05] going backwards. Let's preach Pentecost.
[2:02:09] Let's preach liberty. Let's preach
[2:02:12] freedom in the word, inalienable
[2:02:14] rights of the believers.
[2:02:17] When that which is perfect is come, I
[2:02:19] can't help but think, brothers and
[2:02:20] sisters, 1963, there's no more talk
[2:02:22] about the earnest. We're not no longer
[2:02:24] dealing with the down payment. We're
[2:02:25] dealing with the full measure of the
[2:02:28] Lord Jesus Christ in the age in which we
[2:02:30] live. If we've got the open word, we
[2:02:32] have the full revealing of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:34] Back in the message when brother
[2:02:36] Brandham was preaching here, he said,
[2:02:37] "This is the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:40] This is the appearing." But there's also
[2:02:42] a coming. And I gotta tell you, brothers
[2:02:44] and sisters, there's a word coming of
[2:02:46] the Lord Jesus Christ. And what happened
[2:02:49] on Sunset Mountain? Now, what happened
[2:02:51] in 1963? We know, we read it many times.
[2:02:54] It's the buzz scripture in Revelations
[2:02:56] 10 1-7 in the days of the voice. Yes.
[2:03:01] Right. Amen. of the seventh angel when
[2:03:05] he shall begin to sound. Not when he's
[2:03:07] done sounding, when he's gone off the
[2:03:09] scene. When he shall begin to sound,
[2:03:11] what the mystery of God should be
[2:03:13] starting, no, finished. Because it's not
[2:03:17] just something that's given to us as a
[2:03:19] mystery. It is the revealing of Jesus
[2:03:21] Christ. Our true Pentecost has come.
[2:03:25] That's right. But if we choose to reject
[2:03:27] it and say, "I don't see it that way.
[2:03:29] I'm not willing to look at it that way."
[2:03:30] That's okay. But what's going to happen
[2:03:33] is spiritually speaking, that all is
[2:03:35] coming, brothers and sisters. I'm
[2:03:36] telling you that all is coming and it's
[2:03:38] going to pierce our spiritual eardrum.
[2:03:41] And we're never going to mature past
[2:03:43] where we're at.
[2:03:47] But when that which is perfect is come,
[2:03:49] then that which is in part shall be done
[2:03:51] away. Now, we're not going to do away
[2:03:53] with a prophet. And I'm not saying we're
[2:03:55] going to do away with Jesus Christ. No.
[2:03:59] Because he didn't come to actually
[2:04:01] diminish anything. He came to magnify
[2:04:03] and to amplify. If anything, brothers
[2:04:05] and sisters, now more than ever, we want
[2:04:09] to say amen to the word of God. Amen.
[2:04:12] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[2:04:14] I understood as a child. I even thought
[2:04:16] as a child. But when I became a man, I
[2:04:19] put away childish things. I stopped
[2:04:22] playing with trucks. I stopped playing
[2:04:24] with balls. Even though I still do kind
[2:04:26] of play with both of them. um just in a
[2:04:28] man way.
[2:04:30] And I'm sure you understand what I mean.
[2:04:31] But we're not trying to play with toys
[2:04:33] anymore. Not child's toys anyways. It's
[2:04:36] adult toys. But we're not talking about
[2:04:39] natural things here. We're talking about
[2:04:41] spiritual things.
[2:04:43] Brother Bradom says, I can't help but
[2:04:46] think this, brothers and sisters, when
[2:04:47] we want to talk mysteries over and over
[2:04:49] again, we're talking about shiny things.
[2:04:53] We're talking about shiny things. And
[2:04:55] brother Brandham says that the gospel
[2:04:57] doesn't shine, it glows. He says that
[2:04:59] monkeys jump for shiny things.
[2:05:03] We're sons and daughters of God. We
[2:05:05] don't need something spectacular. We
[2:05:07] don't need something else to come along.
[2:05:09] We've got that which is perfect. It's
[2:05:11] already come.
[2:05:14] Verse 12 says, "For now we see through a
[2:05:17] glass darkly, but then face to face. Now
[2:05:20] I know in part and then shall I be known
[2:05:23] even as also I am known. So what took
[2:05:26] place on February 28th, 1963, brothers
[2:05:29] and sisters?
[2:05:31] What took place? Let's turn over to
[2:05:32] Revelations.
[2:05:38] We're going to end here because we got a
[2:05:40] service tonight. I don't want to keep us
[2:05:42] too long.
[2:05:49] We know this chapter so well.
[2:05:52] We should be able to just
[2:05:54] quote it.
[2:05:57] But John the Revelator,
[2:05:59] the one that was with Jesus and the
[2:06:02] other disciples said, "How is it that
[2:06:05] someone's going to see the kingdom of
[2:06:06] heaven coming?" And Jesus said, "You
[2:06:09] know what? What's it to you? just follow
[2:06:11] me.
[2:06:15] He wrote these words here in Revelations
[2:06:17] chapter 10. And I saw another mighty
[2:06:20] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[2:06:22] a what?
[2:06:25] Cloud
[2:06:27] and a what? A rainbow was about his head
[2:06:31] and his face was as it were the sun and
[2:06:34] his feet as pillars of fire. And he had
[2:06:37] in his hand
[2:06:39] a little book open. And I can't help but
[2:06:42] think it was the little book open. I'm
[2:06:44] not trying to correct scripture, but it
[2:06:46] was a little book open because he didn't
[2:06:49] know what book it was at this point. And
[2:06:52] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[2:06:54] his left foot upon the earth. And he
[2:06:55] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[2:06:58] roarth. And when he had cried, seven
[2:07:01] thunders uttered their voices. Now, many
[2:07:03] people want to just stop right there and
[2:07:05] say they're unknown thunders. We just
[2:07:06] don't know what they are yet. But we
[2:07:08] know brother Bradom said that those
[2:07:10] seven unknown thunders were contained in
[2:07:12] the seals.
[2:07:14] And when the seven thunders had uttered
[2:07:16] their voices, I was about to write and
[2:07:18] heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[2:07:19] me, seal up those things which the seven
[2:07:21] thunders uttered and write them not. So
[2:07:24] for some it just becomes a mystery. But
[2:07:26] I think you need to keep reading. I just
[2:07:28] want to say keep reading. If it's still
[2:07:29] a mystery, just keep reading. And the
[2:07:31] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[2:07:34] upon the earth. Remember the sea,
[2:07:36] brother Bradom says it very clearly,
[2:07:38] denotes people. The sea is people. The
[2:07:43] earth is the land. The land is the
[2:07:45] earth. So he came down and declared
[2:07:48] authority over all of the people and
[2:07:52] over all of the earth. This is someone
[2:07:55] that is a notable angel. Brother
[2:07:56] Brandham talks about this is someone
[2:07:58] very significant. And you already know
[2:08:01] who I'm talking about. This is Jesus
[2:08:02] Christ. The angel which I saw stand upon
[2:08:05] the people or the sea and upon the earth
[2:08:08] or the world, lifted up his hand to
[2:08:10] heaven, and swear by him that liveth
[2:08:12] forever and ever, created heaven, and
[2:08:14] all the things that therein are, and the
[2:08:16] earth, and the things that therein are,
[2:08:19] and the sea, and the things which are
[2:08:21] therein, that there should be time no
[2:08:24] longer. Amen.
[2:08:26] So, brothers and sisters, I can't help
[2:08:28] but think really what we're looking at
[2:08:30] here is the coming of the Lord.
[2:08:34] Because what happened here, this is the
[2:08:36] hallmark scripture of the message of the
[2:08:38] hour, is it not? But in the days of the
[2:08:41] voice of the seventh angel, remember the
[2:08:44] seventh angel is not the same angel that
[2:08:46] we're talking about coming down with the
[2:08:48] open book in his hand. That is not the
[2:08:50] same angel. We're talking about a
[2:08:52] different angel now in verse 7. But in
[2:08:54] the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:08:56] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[2:08:58] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[2:09:00] hath declared to his servants, the
[2:09:02] prophets, two separate angels, brother
[2:09:04] Brandham, saying that the two of us will
[2:09:07] not be here at the same time when he
[2:09:10] preaches the seals.
[2:09:12] Verse 8 says, "And the voice which I
[2:09:15] heard from heaven spake unto me again,
[2:09:17] and said, go and take the little book
[2:09:18] which is open in the hand of the angel
[2:09:20] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[2:09:21] earth."
[2:09:22] We know 8 to 111 is a type of the
[2:09:25] commission for the bride. I'll call the
[2:09:27] musicians as we begin to close here for
[2:09:29] today. I feel like I could preach a lot
[2:09:31] about this and maybe Lord willing we
[2:09:33] will as we go forwards. In 1965,
[2:09:38] what is the attraction on the mountain?
[2:09:42] Remember John the Revelator,
[2:09:46] brother Bradam said, was a type of the
[2:09:47] bride, right? He was told to take this
[2:09:49] book and eat it up and go and prophesy.
[2:09:53] Verse seven talks about the days of the
[2:09:55] voice of the seventh angel. The seventh
[2:09:57] angel came and he did his job. He
[2:09:59] actually sounded. He did exactly what he
[2:10:02] was supposed to do. The seventh church
[2:10:03] age messenger. And that was for a
[2:10:05] reason. That was so that Revelations 10
[2:10:08] 8-11 could take place.
[2:10:11] And I think it really behooves us to
[2:10:13] make sure that we do exactly what this
[2:10:15] word says. Yes. Revelation or sorry in
[2:10:18] uh 1965 what is the attraction on the
[2:10:21] mountain for the Brandham telling the
[2:10:23] story here he says return home
[2:10:26] not just because he feels inspired
[2:10:30] for thus saith the Lord
[2:10:33] the seven mysteries that's been hid in
[2:10:37] the Bible all these years these
[2:10:39] denominations and everything
[2:10:42] God is going to open those seven
[2:10:46] mysteries to us in the seven seals.
[2:10:52] They're not mysteries.
[2:10:54] The mysteries are histories.
[2:10:58] I can't help but think, brothers and
[2:10:59] sisters, we're not looking at a uh an
[2:11:03] Earnest any longer, are we? Why wouldn't
[2:11:05] he preach about the Earnest any further
[2:11:07] after 1963?
[2:11:12] Because that which is perfect has come.
[2:11:15] a completely open word. And what is the
[2:11:18] word? The word is Christ.
[2:11:20] He goes on to say, "There was that
[2:11:22] circle coming up from the earth
[2:11:26] like a mist,
[2:11:29] like a mist forming. When it did, it
[2:11:34] went plum up into the mountain, began to
[2:11:36] circle on westward from the way it come.
[2:11:39] Science found it after a while. 30 miles
[2:11:43] high, 25 miles across, just exactly in
[2:11:47] the circle of a pyramid.
[2:11:51] Now, we could stop there and say that's
[2:11:53] exactly what it is. It was just a
[2:11:54] mysterious cloud just like was printed
[2:11:56] in Life magazine and and Look magazine.
[2:11:59] And we know that many times we see the
[2:12:02] picture on the wall and sometimes we'll
[2:12:04] see the picture on the wall and we'll
[2:12:06] have other people put their face inside
[2:12:08] that picture. And I think there's some
[2:12:09] merit to that, brothers and sisters.
[2:12:11] There's some merit to that. We got to be
[2:12:13] able to see ourselves also in that
[2:12:15] cloud. But just talking specifically
[2:12:17] about that cloud, brother Brandham says
[2:12:19] exactly what that cloud is. And I think
[2:12:21] it's important to make sure that we say
[2:12:23] what he said.
[2:12:26] After and the other day, sorry, standing
[2:12:28] there, I turned the picture to the right
[2:12:30] because Jesus told him, "Turn it right."
[2:12:33] The Lord told him, "Turn it right." And
[2:12:36] and did he turn it to the right angle? I
[2:12:39] think that God told him to look at it
[2:12:41] the right way. Turn it so you have the
[2:12:44] right perspective
[2:12:46] because when you get the right
[2:12:47] perspective, you're going to see Jesus
[2:12:49] Christ.
[2:12:52] And the other day standing there turned
[2:12:54] the picture to the right and there is
[2:12:56] Jesus as he was in the seven church
[2:12:59] ages. And that's at the beginning of
[2:13:01] Revelations. You go back to Revelations
[2:13:02] chapter 1, the white wigged one standing
[2:13:04] in the midst of the candlesticks. We're
[2:13:06] not going to read it for the sake of
[2:13:07] time today. He was the one with the
[2:13:08] white wig on showing supreme deity.
[2:13:12] Where was he showing supreme deity?
[2:13:14] Brothers and sisters in 1963 in a cloud.
[2:13:17] This is what the prophet's saying here.
[2:13:20] He's the one with the white wig on
[2:13:22] showing supreme deity. He's alpha omega,
[2:13:25] the beginning, the ending. He's the
[2:13:27] first and the last. He's the supreme
[2:13:29] judge of all eternity standing there to
[2:13:32] confirm the message of this hour. Yes,
[2:13:35] sir.
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:37] He's not saying that he's coming.
[2:13:41] He's saying that he's here.
[2:13:44] That it's actually the white wig one
[2:13:46] standing there declaring this message of
[2:13:48] the hour to be true.
[2:13:52] He's the supreme judge of all eternity
[2:13:54] standing there to confirm the message of
[2:13:56] this hour. And there shall be light
[2:13:58] about the evening time. What is it all
[2:14:00] about? What is it? go and listen to what
[2:14:04] is the attraction on the mount, brothers
[2:14:05] and sisters. What is it all about? It's
[2:14:09] all about the going away of the Lord
[2:14:11] Jesus Christ. But I think we still have
[2:14:14] the opportunity to recognize the coming
[2:14:16] of the Lord is here. Amen. The coming of
[2:14:19] the Lord is here. I don't think we've
[2:14:22] missed it yet. So, let's get in the boat
[2:14:25] while we can, brothers and sisters.
[2:14:28] It's about to flood this world, not with
[2:14:30] water.
[2:14:32] There's going to be a climate change and
[2:14:34] we're not going to be here to see it.
[2:14:36] God bless you this morning. Let's stand
[2:14:38] as we close.
[2:14:40] Remember, we have an inalienable right
[2:14:44] and that is every single promise in the
[2:14:47] book. It's Jesus Christ, our Pentecost.
[2:14:54] Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly
[2:14:55] Father, Lord, we thank you for your
[2:14:57] word. Amen.
[2:14:59] Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can see
[2:15:02] through a glass clearly now.
[2:15:05] And Father, if there's anybody here
[2:15:06] today that can't see through a a the
[2:15:09] glass, the glass clearly, Father, my
[2:15:12] prayer is that you would allow that
[2:15:14] glass to become clear.
[2:15:17] Lord Jesus, that as we peel back the
[2:15:20] pages of your word, that we would begin
[2:15:22] to see Jesus Christ from Genesis to
[2:15:26] Revelation.
[2:15:27] And Lord, as we continue to peel back
[2:15:30] the pages that Father, the continuation
[2:15:32] would be that we not only see you in
[2:15:35] that word, but we see ourselves with you
[2:15:37] in that word, Lord. Amen. Oh, Father, we
[2:15:41] know that you said there will be a time
[2:15:43] where you will be in us and we will be
[2:15:46] in you and we'll all be in the Father
[2:15:49] and the Father will be in us. Father,
[2:15:51] help us to recognize that day is now.
[2:15:54] Yes. Amen. Father, we're so thankful for
[2:15:56] your word. Thank you, Lord, for sending
[2:15:59] a prophet that would take us and show us
[2:16:01] the way back to your word, to the true
[2:16:04] word. Father, we have been given the
[2:16:07] inalienable right. The devil can't take
[2:16:11] it away from us and we can't even give
[2:16:13] it away.
[2:16:15] Father, I pray that you would just allow
[2:16:17] the words that were spoken today to just
[2:16:19] become real to Amen. everyone here,
[2:16:22] Father. even myself, Father, trying to
[2:16:25] quantify what I think you showed me
[2:16:28] today. It's beautiful. I thank you for
[2:16:30] it, Lord. I pray that you would just be
[2:16:32] glorified now as we go our separate
[2:16:34] ways. And if we should gather again
[2:16:37] tonight for a communion service, Lord,
[2:16:39] to discern your body, oh Father, to
[2:16:42] follow your instructions, Lord, we'll be
[2:16:44] careful to give you praise. Amen. We
[2:16:47] thank you for your leadership and your
[2:16:48] guidance in your church. We pray that
[2:16:51] you would be the head of all. We just
[2:16:53] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[2:16:55] name we pray. Amen.
[2:16:59] Consume me Lord.
[2:17:02] [Music]

[2:20:35] There is no
[2:20:38] one
[2:20:40] else
[2:20:42] like you.
[2:20:46] Isn't it wonderful to just make it
[2:20:48] personal to him?
[2:20:50] Amen. Can we sing number 180? Just
[2:20:54] change the tempo a little bit.
[2:20:58] I've got something
[2:21:00] that the world can't give.

[2:21:06] give.
[2:21:09] I've got something that the world can't
[2:21:12] give. that the world can't take it away.
[2:21:18] I got something that the world can do
[2:21:22] and it is me.
[2:21:27] I got something worth talking about. It
[2:21:32] makes me sing and it makes me shout.

[2:21:40] and the world can't take it away. One

[2:23:01] it is, isn't it? It's that old time
[2:23:04] religion, Jesus Christ himself.
