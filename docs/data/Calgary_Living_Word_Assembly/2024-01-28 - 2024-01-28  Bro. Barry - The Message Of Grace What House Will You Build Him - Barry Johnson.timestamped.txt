[55:38] your Bibles
[55:44] today I have a couple of scriptures I'd
[55:47] like to
[55:50] read Ephesians
[55:54] 6
[55:55] Ephesians
[55:58] 6:10 and I'd like to read from Zechariah
[56:00] Chapter
[56:18] 4 Ephesians
[56:20] 6:1 says finally my brethren be strong
[56:25] in the
[56:26] Lord and in the power of His
[56:30] might over in the book of
[56:34] Zachariah chapter
[56:43] 4 just start reading with verse
[56:49] one and the angel that talked with me
[56:54] came again and wake me as a man that is
[56:57] wakened out of his sleep and he said
[57:01] unto me what seest thou and I said I
[57:04] have looked and behold a Candlestick of
[57:06] all gold all of gold with a bowl upon
[57:11] the top of it and his seven lamps
[57:15] thereon and seven pipes to the seven
[57:18] lamps which are upon the top
[57:21] thereof and two olive trees by it one
[57:25] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[57:28] other upon the left side
[57:31] thereof so I answered and spake to the
[57:34] angel that talked with me saying what
[57:37] are these my
[57:39] Lord then the angel that talked with me
[57:42] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[57:45] not what these be and I said no my
[57:50] Lord then he answered and spake unto me
[57:54] saying this this is the word of the Lord
[57:56] unto
[57:58] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[58:03] power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[58:09] amen who art thou oh great Mountain
[58:12] before
[58:14] zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[58:17] plain and he shall bring forth The
[58:20] Headstone
[58:22] thereof with shoutings in Grace Grace
[58:27] unto it let's just bow in prayer one
[58:30] more time Heavenly Father we love you
[58:33] and we thank you for your word thank you
[58:36] for your grace and your mercy to us now
[58:39] we just ask Lord Jesus that we could dip
[58:42] our wicks in that oil this morning
[58:45] Father that Lord Jesus we could trim our
[58:48] lamps today that father we could Lord
[58:51] burn bright and clear father that there
[58:53] would be nothing that would hinder your
[58:55] spirit from shining out through each and
[58:57] every one of us father let that let that
[58:59] flame burn bright and clear in every one
[59:02] of our Lives is our prayer this morning
[59:05] we just ask all these things now in
[59:07] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[59:10] bless you this morning you may be
[59:13] seated welcome to the house of the Lord
[59:15] once
[59:17] again you know I had this on my heart
[59:21] for a little while the power of His
[59:23] might and uh I don't know what the
[59:27] proper terminology is for it but if if
[59:29] there is a a subtext I would like to to
[59:33] call it what house will you build
[59:36] him because we know that he asks what
[59:39] house will you build
[59:43] me so I just want to have it as a
[59:45] secondary text I guess what house will
[59:49] you build
[59:51] him certainly thankful to be in the
[59:53] house of the Lord today we have a few
[59:55] announcements we've got a a communion
[59:57] service coming up tonight as you can see
[1:00:01] we have the instruments at the front
[1:00:02] it's at 6 o'clock and uh we certainly
[1:00:05] trust it'll be a blessing to each one
[1:00:07] who can
[1:00:08] partake we have uh Jim night coming up
[1:00:11] Friday February the 2nd from 7 to 9:00
[1:00:14] p.m. we have a prayer meeting February
[1:00:17] the 15th at 7:30 p.m. at the church here
[1:00:22] we have a youth event February 18th
[1:00:25] it will be at our house after the
[1:00:27] morning service in the afternoon and uh
[1:00:30] I think as usual I think as usual if
[1:00:33] that's the right thing to say if
[1:00:34] somebody needs a ride just reach out and
[1:00:36] let us know and we'll see if we can
[1:00:37] arrange that for you for their children
[1:00:40] or the youth if anyone needs a ride to
[1:00:42] it and uh so that will
[1:00:45] be um the 18th yes after the service and
[1:00:49] then the end of the month February 29th
[1:00:52] we will have the annual General men's
[1:00:54] meeting at the church at 7:30 p.m.
[1:00:57] downstairs in the basement so uh we'll
[1:00:59] have all of this on the calendar if you
[1:01:02] have any questions by all means just
[1:01:03] reach out to us are you happy this
[1:01:08] morning I got into the the thought of of
[1:01:12] zerubabel um years ago I had not really
[1:01:16] studied it out but it really kind of
[1:01:18] captured my attention and I was able to
[1:01:21] really get into it as we study in the
[1:01:25] exposition of the seven Church ages on
[1:01:27] Wednesday and uh as you know for those
[1:01:30] who are a part of it we have been into
[1:01:34] this very
[1:01:35] scripture and so I just I felt I felt
[1:01:38] compelled to go and and look this up and
[1:01:41] uh zerubabel is mentioned in the book of
[1:01:44] Chronicles in the Bible and that's where
[1:01:46] there's a lineage given that shows who
[1:01:49] zerubabel is in terms of lineage and and
[1:01:52] how he comes from David and uh on down
[1:01:56] through the the lineage of the people
[1:01:59] but he was you know in the lineage for a
[1:02:01] purpose and his purpose was to go and
[1:02:03] rebuild the Temple but for a while he
[1:02:06] had to be carried away into captivity in
[1:02:09] order for him to actually have that
[1:02:11] desire to rebuild a temple the temple
[1:02:13] had to be destroyed the temple had to
[1:02:16] become um laid to waste and and they had
[1:02:20] to be carried into captivity into uh
[1:02:23] Babylon where Nebuchadnezzar took them
[1:02:26] and we know Daniel was a part of that um
[1:02:29] we probably won't get too far into that
[1:02:31] but he was absolutely in in in need of
[1:02:35] being a part of that to create the
[1:02:37] desire in his heart and I just think
[1:02:38] it's so amazing when you look at it how
[1:02:40] we have to go through trials in our
[1:02:42] lives to really bring out the best of us
[1:02:45] to really bring out that that thing that
[1:02:48] God has placed in there from before the
[1:02:50] foundation of the world and you know for
[1:02:52] us to think that we could just step into
[1:02:55] perfection without going through trials
[1:02:57] is foolishness because Christ himself
[1:03:01] learned obedience through the things
[1:03:03] that he suffered we did not just get a
[1:03:06] free pass to go to heaven as Christians
[1:03:09] we will have to suffer just as he had to
[1:03:12] suffer now I'm not saying we're going to
[1:03:13] have to be nailed to a cross because
[1:03:15] only one was nailed to a cross even
[1:03:17] though some people try and attempt to do
[1:03:19] that as an expression for their love for
[1:03:22] Jesus and for what he went through but
[1:03:24] we're not interested in outwardly
[1:03:26] expression of works of Jesus Christ of
[1:03:29] this gospel what we want to do is
[1:03:32] actually make it an inward work to get
[1:03:34] his Spirit on the inside because we know
[1:03:37] that brother bradam he says that the
[1:03:39] works that we do are an expression of
[1:03:41] the life that's inside of us of the
[1:03:44] person for what Jesus has done for us
[1:03:47] our faith is what he gives us and our
[1:03:50] works are an expression of that faith it
[1:03:53] doesn't work the other way around we
[1:03:54] don't show our faith just by The Works
[1:03:57] that we do we live our lives according
[1:04:00] to the faith that he's given
[1:04:02] us but is uh zerubabel is mentioned in
[1:04:05] the book of Chronicles in Ezra in
[1:04:07] Nehemiah in Hagi and in Zachariah and
[1:04:10] you know just Naturally Speaking I think
[1:04:12] it's a an interesting thing that's all
[1:04:14] I'll say about it but in in in terms of
[1:04:18] natural things we can see Israel brother
[1:04:21] bradam said it and many people do say it
[1:04:23] if you want to see what time it is
[1:04:24] according to God take a look at his time
[1:04:26] piece which is actually Israel now back
[1:04:30] when Trump was President I talked about
[1:04:33] this before I found it fascinating it
[1:04:34] was back then that I actually really
[1:04:36] started to look at this um Trump was
[1:04:39] actually labeled zerubabel by Israel and
[1:04:43] why is that because he actually said we
[1:04:46] will recognize Jerusalem as the capital
[1:04:51] of
[1:04:51] Israel he took it and actually made the
[1:04:54] consulate the US Consulate back in
[1:04:57] Jerusalem and I can't even remember
[1:04:58] where it was but what I do remember is
[1:05:00] they actually mented a coin of Trump's
[1:05:03] inscription and they put zerubabel on it
[1:05:06] and this scripture for Trump now I'm not
[1:05:09] saying he is that don't get me wrong I I
[1:05:11] I just think it's interesting that the
[1:05:13] natural world Israel those people
[1:05:15] involved with it would actually identify
[1:05:18] someone like that in this way but
[1:05:21] zerubabel is spoken of in the Bible in
[1:05:23] Cor I Les in Ezra Nehemiah Hagi and
[1:05:27] Zachariah and by the grace of God this
[1:05:29] morning I'd like to go through some of
[1:05:31] this and just talk about it I think it's
[1:05:33] a real interesting study and and where I
[1:05:35] got probably the most of my inspiration
[1:05:37] this morning is from the message of
[1:05:39] Grace and it's actually called the
[1:05:42] message of Grace in 1961
[1:05:45] 0827 in in paragraph
[1:05:47] 49 brother bradam he uh he just sort of
[1:05:51] sets a little bit of a background on it
[1:05:53] and and
[1:05:54] once we get it up
[1:05:56] I'll I'll start
[1:05:59] reading and as we read on farther we
[1:06:03] find out that God
[1:06:07] said
[1:06:09] zerubabel has laid the foundation with
[1:06:12] his
[1:06:13] hands he also shall bring forth The
[1:06:21] Headstone like how brother Bram talks
[1:06:23] about this he says I want you to notice
[1:06:27] he never said bring forth the
[1:06:30] Cornerstone he shall bring forth The
[1:06:32] Headstone and we know that the scripture
[1:06:34] says that Jesus Christ is the Chief
[1:06:38] Cornerstone and he's also the
[1:06:41] headstone now if we will think for a few
[1:06:44] minutes that the seventh Church
[1:06:47] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:06:50] the children back to the fathers in
[1:06:52] other words rebuild the church again
[1:06:55] under the power of the
[1:06:57] spirit now I just want to remind us that
[1:07:02] we're not talking about building the
[1:07:04] church as the Catholic Church which is
[1:07:06] universal or the Pentecostal Church
[1:07:09] which is denomination or the church as a
[1:07:12] as a whole we're talking about the Bride
[1:07:14] of Jesus Christ the restoration of the
[1:07:18] temple because we know that there's only
[1:07:20] one place that he will meet us there's
[1:07:23] only one place that God will meet the
[1:07:25] True Believer and that is spoken by the
[1:07:27] prophet in our day that is in Jesus
[1:07:29] Christ and there's only one way to get
[1:07:32] into Jesus Christ and that's to get
[1:07:34] Jesus Christ in you it's got to be
[1:07:37] Christ in you the hope of glory that
[1:07:38] only comes by the Holy Ghost there's
[1:07:40] only one way that we're going to get the
[1:07:41] Holy Ghost that's to get baptized in the
[1:07:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:07:46] remission of our sins titles won't do it
[1:07:50] titles will be uh a a faked out Affair
[1:07:53] it will be some something that we think
[1:07:54] we've done right but we won't have done
[1:07:57] right it will be wrong and we can be
[1:08:00] living under the inspiration and the
[1:08:02] Very life of the truth all the while
[1:08:06] thinking that we're right but we're
[1:08:07] wrong sincere about what we're doing but
[1:08:10] sincerely wrong while we're doing it we
[1:08:13] have to make sure that we're not
[1:08:14] actually living off of the life of
[1:08:17] another another
[1:08:18] person we have to have our own
[1:08:21] experience brother bradam says and we
[1:08:24] know that the scripture says that Jesus
[1:08:28] is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also
[1:08:30] the headstone now it if if we will think
[1:08:34] for a few minutes that the seventh
[1:08:36] Church age messenger was to
[1:08:38] restore faith of the children back to
[1:08:40] their fathers in other words rebuild the
[1:08:42] church again under the power of the
[1:08:44] spirit not by power not by might but by
[1:08:49] my spirit saith the
[1:08:51] Lord not by organizing ation not by
[1:08:55] denomination but by the Holy Spirit God
[1:08:59] will bring forth the church in in the
[1:09:03] last day amen I'm just going to pause
[1:09:06] there I think it's so important um many
[1:09:09] people will say well brother Barry we've
[1:09:11] heard this maybe for decades we've heard
[1:09:13] this we've heard this and that's good if
[1:09:15] we've heard it but are we living it
[1:09:17] that's the question what house will you
[1:09:20] build him is what I want to say today
[1:09:23] that's the inspiration for this service
[1:09:24] today brothers and sisters what house
[1:09:27] are we building him with our
[1:09:29] lives because we're building him a house
[1:09:31] if you listen to the message the Rapture
[1:09:33] brother bradam says it at the very
[1:09:34] beginning it would be really astounding
[1:09:36] if you would know what's actually taking
[1:09:38] place for me to tell you what's actually
[1:09:40] taking place at this moment he says in
[1:09:43] the Rapture message right at the very
[1:09:44] beginning and he says it further on that
[1:09:46] we're not building a wall for years and
[1:09:49] years and years hundreds of years we're
[1:09:50] building a gospel wall and and it's a
[1:09:53] straight line and and we can say it's
[1:09:55] straight we know it's straight it's plum
[1:09:57] and and we've got all the mortar and
[1:09:58] joints and everything right just right
[1:10:01] we've got all the mechanics all the
[1:10:02] stones being hued out everything it's
[1:10:04] just a great machine but then God sends
[1:10:06] a dispensational prophet to say hey guys
[1:10:09] it's time to turn a corner just like it
[1:10:12] was when Jesus came the prophet
[1:10:14] prophesied Isaiah prophesied that a
[1:10:16] virgin shall conceive right and she did
[1:10:20] how many people brother Bram says were
[1:10:22] thinking that they could be that virgin
[1:10:24] oh there was lots of virgins in those
[1:10:26] days that were probably thinking my my
[1:10:28] my my my somebody has to be that person
[1:10:30] to fulfill that scripture but then there
[1:10:32] was one person where the angel came to
[1:10:35] and that one person she didn't argue she
[1:10:38] didn't try and make it her own Doctrine
[1:10:39] she didn't make it a pet Doctrine she
[1:10:41] didn't try and make it something out of
[1:10:43] her tradition she just simply said be it
[1:10:45] unto me according to Thy word let the
[1:10:47] words of this messenger Angel come unto
[1:10:50] me and what happened was the thing that
[1:10:52] overshadowed her caused Jesus to come
[1:10:55] forward in her life and it's exactly the
[1:10:57] same way today brothers and sisters but
[1:10:59] brother bradam says in that message
[1:11:00] we're no longer building a wall we're
[1:11:02] building a house it's a
[1:11:04] three-dimensional building and it's got
[1:11:06] to be exactly according to the
[1:11:07] blueprints and if we don't have the
[1:11:09] foundation set properly tear it down
[1:11:13] right because all that can be shaken
[1:11:15] will be shaken the people who are
[1:11:18] familiar with earthquakes here if you
[1:11:19] don't have a proper Foundation under a
[1:11:21] building if there's a little bit of an
[1:11:22] earthquake that is going to
[1:11:24] fall we have to have a foundation and so
[1:11:28] when we talk about the foundation
[1:11:30] zerubabel was the one that was
[1:11:32] commissioned to go and lay the
[1:11:34] foundation for this Temple and not only
[1:11:36] lay the foundation but to finish this
[1:11:38] Temple he was commissioned by the king
[1:11:40] to come out of captivity and go and
[1:11:43] build this
[1:11:44] Temple it's a pretty amazing thing
[1:11:46] because first they were taken into
[1:11:48] captivity it was terrible their Temple
[1:11:51] was torn down destroyed and it was all
[1:11:53] according to scripture Jeremiah talks
[1:11:55] all about it he says if you don't repent
[1:11:57] from your ways if you don't repent the
[1:11:59] most religious people just repent God
[1:12:01] said it over and over and over repent
[1:12:03] repent repent just turn unto me turn
[1:12:05] from your Wicked Ways if you don't the
[1:12:08] King of the North is going to come here
[1:12:09] and destroy you and they wouldn't if you
[1:12:13] ever see the movie Jeremiah if you ever
[1:12:15] read the chapter Jeremiah you can see
[1:12:19] how they treated Jeremiah the prophet
[1:12:21] they were terrible to him and who is
[1:12:23] terrible to him just for the
[1:12:26] record religious ones
[1:12:29] exactly those those Believers in that
[1:12:32] day right they were the ones that came
[1:12:34] against him and said how dare you who
[1:12:35] are you where did you come from we know
[1:12:37] who your parents
[1:12:39] are God's got a program we just need to
[1:12:42] follow his program because it's not by
[1:12:45] Our Own Strength brothers and sisters
[1:12:47] and it's not by our might it's by his
[1:12:49] spirit that everything is going to
[1:12:51] happen it's not by a denominational
[1:12:53] organization it's not by saying that we
[1:12:56] understand with our minds the way things
[1:12:58] should be according to the message of
[1:12:59] the AR so now we're going to orchestrate
[1:13:01] everything to fit exactly the way we
[1:13:03] think it should fit it's not by our
[1:13:05] strength and it's not by our might it's
[1:13:07] by his Spirit if we have things that we
[1:13:09] want to see changed in our lives then we
[1:13:11] need to get together and be as
[1:13:14] one not pulling in every direction
[1:13:16] saying this is my way and that's his way
[1:13:18] and this is the other way brothers and
[1:13:20] sisters God's not going to move in that
[1:13:21] midst he's going to say it's
[1:13:24] confusion but when we can come together
[1:13:26] and be in one mind and one Accord get
[1:13:28] all the humanity put aside and recognize
[1:13:31] we live in this last day this Foundation
[1:13:33] has been set by the seventh Church age
[1:13:35] Messenger as we just read the foundation
[1:13:38] is set and I would say this the building
[1:13:41] is already
[1:13:43] finished but you know we all have a part
[1:13:45] to
[1:13:47] play what are we
[1:13:49] doing what house are we building them
[1:13:52] because he's not not looking at everyone
[1:13:55] and and and getting everyone to look at
[1:13:56] everyone else and say what kind of house
[1:13:57] are you building well how are you doing
[1:13:59] this and and what are you doing there no
[1:14:02] that's what the devil does he wants us
[1:14:05] to look inwardly he wants us to look in
[1:14:07] the mirror of his word and say are we
[1:14:09] lining up with his word because if we
[1:14:12] don't line up with his word then we have
[1:14:13] the opportunity to change our ways just
[1:14:16] like Jeremiah was crying out to them to
[1:14:19] repent just turn from your evil
[1:14:22] ways I'm not saying everyone's evil here
[1:14:25] don't get me wrong what I am saying is
[1:14:28] that we need to make sure we understand
[1:14:30] that we're building the Temple for the
[1:14:32] Holy Ghost and it ain't a building it's
[1:14:35] our
[1:14:36] lives it's our families it's our
[1:14:40] marriages it's our
[1:14:42] relationships they all demonstrate
[1:14:45] what's going on because all of that is
[1:14:47] actually the fruit that's in the branch
[1:14:50] as we've talked about on Wednesday you
[1:14:52] know the hybrid tree the grafted in tree
[1:14:55] the tree that's all grafted in brother
[1:14:57] bradam talks about the orange tree if
[1:14:59] that tree ever puts forth another Branch
[1:15:01] it will only put forth
[1:15:04] oranges but all the other branches are
[1:15:06] grafted in people come in with different
[1:15:09] ideas different traditions and they get
[1:15:12] plugged in and they're just grafted in
[1:15:14] and what happens is they live off the
[1:15:16] same life everyone's living off the same
[1:15:19] life it's the same Holy Ghost and you
[1:15:22] know what they produce fruit yes
[1:15:26] sir but what fruit is it is it the fruit
[1:15:28] of the spirit because that's what
[1:15:30] brother Bam's talking about when he says
[1:15:33] if that Branch ever puts forth another
[1:15:34] Branch if that tree ever puts forth
[1:15:37] another Branch then it will be just
[1:15:38] exactly the same as the beginning and he
[1:15:40] said that it was an orange tree from the
[1:15:42] beginning and I'm not saying that the
[1:15:43] fruit of the spirit is an orange don't
[1:15:45] get me wrong what I am saying is that
[1:15:46] the fruit of the spirit is in the word
[1:15:49] and we have a very specific detailed
[1:15:51] program of what that fruit looks like
[1:15:54] excuse me and it's not a bunch of
[1:15:56] different fruits to say that I can just
[1:15:57] have you know a little bit of joy and a
[1:16:00] little bit of longsuffering and and a
[1:16:02] little bit of peace and everything is
[1:16:04] fine I've got the fruit of the spirit
[1:16:05] you got a portion of it but we're not
[1:16:07] talking about a portion here in this day
[1:16:09] we're talking about the entire word
[1:16:11] having all of
[1:16:14] it but it only comes one way and that's
[1:16:18] by the power of the spirit not by power
[1:16:21] not by might but by my Spirit saith the
[1:16:24] Lord not by
[1:16:27] organization and not by
[1:16:29] denomination but by the Holy Spirit God
[1:16:32] will bring forth the church in the last
[1:16:35] day brother BR goes on to say zerubabel
[1:16:37] the prince with
[1:16:39] josua was the one that was to bring
[1:16:42] forth this
[1:16:44] headstone he had laid the foundation he
[1:16:47] had took the people back to the
[1:16:49] foundation in
[1:16:51] type which we all know know that these
[1:16:53] candlesticks and so forth represented
[1:16:55] both Jewish and church they were Olive
[1:16:58] branches the Bible said here and the
[1:17:01] Olive Branch we are the wild branch that
[1:17:04] was grafted into the root of the tamed
[1:17:07] Olive
[1:17:09] Tree
[1:17:11] Gentiles and out of these two branches
[1:17:13] come sensor pipes going into the seven
[1:17:16] golden candlesticks to give light to the
[1:17:19] seven Church
[1:17:20] ages I love how brother Bram just brings
[1:17:23] this right into the church ages how he
[1:17:25] ties it right in here so we can see that
[1:17:27] there's a connection to it it's not just
[1:17:30] talking about something out of the Old
[1:17:32] Testament an Old Testament scripture
[1:17:33] where we have to wonder how how does
[1:17:35] this even tie
[1:17:36] together so I wanted to talk about this
[1:17:39] the rubba bell and we will but I just
[1:17:40] wanted to pause here for a minute and
[1:17:42] talk about the headstone we know that uh
[1:17:47] yes verse 7 of Zechariah 4 who art thou
[1:17:51] oh great Mountain
[1:17:53] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[1:17:56] plain isn't it interesting to look at
[1:17:59] that brothers and sisters how many times
[1:18:00] do we have a mountain in front of us and
[1:18:04] you know what if you have the spirit of
[1:18:06] God in your life and you are living by
[1:18:08] that scripture where it's not by
[1:18:10] strength and it's not by might but it's
[1:18:12] by my spirit saith the Lord who is that
[1:18:15] mountain that stands before you because
[1:18:18] it's going to turn into a plane brothers
[1:18:20] and sisters but only if you're living
[1:18:22] that way
[1:18:23] and he shall bring forth The
[1:18:26] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[1:18:30] Grace Grace unto it so I found this
[1:18:35] interesting headstone all of this is
[1:18:38] kind of mysterious so I looked at it
[1:18:41] headstone in in in the Strong's
[1:18:43] concordat it's h
[1:18:45] 7222 and and it's it's it's yeah I'm not
[1:18:49] even going to try to pronounce it
[1:18:51] Raha
[1:18:53] and oh by pronunciation it's rosha the
[1:18:57] definition is it is feminine The
[1:19:02] Headstone is feminine and it's the
[1:19:04] headstone from this scripture that I
[1:19:06] searched in in Strong's Concordance so
[1:19:08] it's the actual word in this scripture
[1:19:10] it's not just headstone in general in
[1:19:12] the Bible but it's from this scripture
[1:19:14] and it says the definition is feminine
[1:19:16] of H7 218 the head The Headstone a
[1:19:21] feminine headstone though isn't that
[1:19:24] interesting so H
[1:19:27] 7218 I know this can seem like a an eye
[1:19:30] Crossing thing when you start to go into
[1:19:32] the root words and stuff but sometimes I
[1:19:34] think it's important to look at so we're
[1:19:36] talking about the feminine headstone
[1:19:39] here a and the root it's the root of
[1:19:42] this word here Hebrew is the translation
[1:19:45] is ro ro roshi is the actual
[1:19:49] pronunciation but the definition is from
[1:19:51] an unused root apparently meaning to
[1:19:53] shake the head as most easily shaken
[1:19:58] whether literally or figuratively so a
[1:20:02] feminine head that's being shaken either
[1:20:04] literally or figuratively how many times
[1:20:08] can we shake our head and cry Grace
[1:20:11] Grace unto it but here we have zerubabel
[1:20:15] setting this headstone this foundation
[1:20:17] stone not the Cornerstone but the
[1:20:20] headstone he's setting this Stone in in
[1:20:23] the foundation of this Temple and we
[1:20:26] know that he is it's said that he's
[1:20:29] going to cry Grace Grace unto it h I
[1:20:32] just can't help but think brothers and
[1:20:33] sisters there is a people and there is a
[1:20:36] place where there is a headstone that is
[1:20:39] a feminine that is the foundation of the
[1:20:41] church that is by his spirit that can
[1:20:44] only cry Grace Grace unto that
[1:20:47] headstone and that's what we heard this
[1:20:49] morning you know that just that just
[1:20:50] does it for me when I see a song Maybe
[1:20:52] people think I'm just stretching it here
[1:20:54] but you know when you prepare and you
[1:20:56] come and and you wonder is this the
[1:20:57] direction to go when we can say that the
[1:20:59] tomb is empty and that stone is rolled
[1:21:02] away I just can't help but think it's
[1:21:03] the same thing as the rubber bell saying
[1:21:05] that you know that stone has moved and
[1:21:08] it is cried Grace Grace unto it amen you
[1:21:11] know I want to read out of Hagi chapter
[1:21:13] 1 uh this morning if you have your
[1:21:16] Bibles maybe a little bit of a bible
[1:21:17] study this morning but just to look at
[1:21:20] the at the at the story here a little
[1:21:23] bit about zerubabel and and and how
[1:21:26] zerubabel was used for this restoration
[1:21:29] of the
[1:21:31] temple hegi chapter
[1:21:35] 1 verse 1 and remember we're paralleling
[1:21:39] this as we
[1:21:40] go what house are you building him amen
[1:21:46] what will you build
[1:21:48] him in the second year this is Hagi 1
[1:21:52] verse
[1:21:53] one in the second year of Darius the
[1:21:56] king in the sixth month in the first day
[1:21:59] of the month came the word of the Lord
[1:22:01] to Hagi the prophet unto zerubabel the
[1:22:06] son of shiti Tiel governor of Judah and
[1:22:11] to Joshua the son of josec the high
[1:22:14] priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of
[1:22:18] hosts saying this PE this people say the
[1:22:22] time is not come the time that the
[1:22:26] Lord's House should be
[1:22:28] built then came the word of God by Hagi
[1:22:31] the prophet saying is it time for you oh
[1:22:35] for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed
[1:22:39] houses and this house lie
[1:22:43] waste now therefore thus saith the Lord
[1:22:46] of hosts consider your
[1:22:48] ways brothers and sisters I just feel so
[1:22:52] impressed to to say it this
[1:22:54] morning we we we we want to see the
[1:22:58] temple being built but I believe this
[1:23:01] speaks to something in our day where we
[1:23:03] can say you know what someday that
[1:23:05] Temple is going to be built somewhere
[1:23:07] and we'll do exactly what brother
[1:23:09] brandham says we'll take and put the
[1:23:12] coming of the Lord somewhere out there
[1:23:15] we'll put what's actually taking place
[1:23:17] somewhere in the future or or we'll look
[1:23:19] back and say you know he's Jesus Christ
[1:23:21] of the past or or make him Jesus of the
[1:23:24] future and ignore what he's doing right
[1:23:26] now what he's doing right now is
[1:23:28] building a three-dimensional Temple and
[1:23:30] it's not the Temple of the building that
[1:23:32] we're looking at here it's not the
[1:23:34] Temple of a denomination or the Temple
[1:23:36] of an organization it's the Temple of
[1:23:38] the Holy Ghost in the hearts of the
[1:23:40] Believers that's what he's doing and
[1:23:43] what are we doing with our lives
[1:23:44] brothers and sisters what are we doing
[1:23:46] with our temples I want to say this I I
[1:23:48] I just it hit me on the way to church
[1:23:50] this morning and I I'm preaching to
[1:23:52] myself right along the way here brothers
[1:23:53] and sisters but what we do with our
[1:23:55] temples what do we do with our temples
[1:23:58] when we leave church when we're at
[1:24:00] church we're Christians and when we
[1:24:03] leave here we should still be Christians
[1:24:05] and when we get into our private places
[1:24:07] and do our private things we should
[1:24:09] still be Christians but I want to ask
[1:24:11] the question this morning if we consider
[1:24:13] this to be a temple of worship and and
[1:24:15] our bodies to be the Temple of the Holy
[1:24:17] Ghost as Paul said could we bring our
[1:24:19] private lives into this building and do
[1:24:22] what we do in our private lives right
[1:24:25] here or would we say oh
[1:24:28] my I wouldn't want to do that you know
[1:24:31] brothers and sisters there's things in
[1:24:33] my life where I would say whoa I
[1:24:35] wouldn't want to do that I wouldn't want
[1:24:37] to make this building like that I would
[1:24:39] not want to do that but what would make
[1:24:42] me think that I could do it anywhere
[1:24:43] else and it wouldn't make a difference
[1:24:45] because this building doesn't hold the
[1:24:47] Holy
[1:24:48] Ghost your life
[1:24:50] does our lives hold the Holy Ghost we
[1:24:54] take the Holy Ghost he created a spot in
[1:24:56] the heart of every single believer for
[1:24:59] himself and he's not interested in
[1:25:01] sharing with
[1:25:03] anyone
[1:25:06] anything my so thinking about this this
[1:25:09] scripture here I'll just start from the
[1:25:10] beginning and not start preaching again
[1:25:12] here in the second year of Darius the
[1:25:14] king in the sixth month and the first
[1:25:15] day of the month came the word of the
[1:25:17] Lord to hegi the prophet unto zerubabel
[1:25:19] the son of shtiel governor of Judah and
[1:25:22] to Joshua the son of josec the high
[1:25:25] priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of
[1:25:27] hosts saying this people say the time is
[1:25:32] not come the time to build the house
[1:25:36] should be the Lord's House should be
[1:25:37] built then came the word of the Lord to
[1:25:40] Hagi the prophet saying is it time for
[1:25:42] you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses
[1:25:45] and this house lie waste now therefore
[1:25:47] thus sayith the Lord of hosts consider
[1:25:49] your ways ye have sown much and bring in
[1:25:52] little ye eat and ye have not enough ye
[1:25:56] drink and ye are not filled with drink
[1:25:59] ye clothe you but there is none warm and
[1:26:03] he that
[1:26:21] earnthenecklace working it's just not
[1:26:23] happening maybe we're considering this
[1:26:25] message of the hour and we just can't
[1:26:26] live it you can't live it no one can
[1:26:29] live it the only way you're going to do
[1:26:31] it is by his Spirit am because this
[1:26:34] scripture is not just an Old Testament
[1:26:35] scripture not by strength nor by might
[1:26:38] but by my spirit saith the Lord that's
[1:26:41] the only way you're going to live this
[1:26:44] gospel it's the only way we're going to
[1:26:47] consecrate these temples is by his
[1:26:49] spirit and when we have his spirit it
[1:26:52] he's going to draw our attention to the
[1:26:55] things that defile this Temple he's
[1:26:58] going to say stop doing that I don't
[1:27:00] like that and we're going to have the
[1:27:02] opportunity to say okay or say no I can
[1:27:05] handle it I can actually step over this
[1:27:08] red flag I've done it for the last 10
[1:27:09] years and it's just fine it doesn't
[1:27:11] matter look at me everything is good in
[1:27:13] my life is it spiritually good in your
[1:27:17] life I want to say consider our ways our
[1:27:20] ways I don't want to say consider your
[1:27:23] ways I want to say consider our ways let
[1:27:25] me consider my ways brothers and
[1:27:28] sisters he says go up to the mountain
[1:27:31] and bring wood and build the house get
[1:27:35] busy do some work go get some wood
[1:27:40] obviously this is the natural this is
[1:27:43] the the natural go up to the mountain
[1:27:45] how many people here know what it means
[1:27:46] to go up to a
[1:27:47] mountain it takes work you don't just go
[1:27:51] up the mountain with ease one day we're
[1:27:53] going to travel like a thought but for
[1:27:55] those people who hike you know what it
[1:27:57] means to go up a mountain and then get
[1:27:59] wood my goodness that means you're going
[1:28:01] to be carrying an axe you're going to be
[1:28:02] carrying a saw you're going to be
[1:28:04] carrying ropes maybe a sled or a wagon
[1:28:07] you're going to take some effort and put
[1:28:08] it into
[1:28:11] this it's going to take some effort to
[1:28:14] put into this Temple that we have here
[1:28:17] we're not just going to have this Temple
[1:28:19] and say I was just born into the message
[1:28:21] of the hour so everything is great in my
[1:28:23] life you know what I've discovered
[1:28:25] brothers and sisters is those people who
[1:28:28] are born into the message of the hour
[1:28:29] they seem to have a greater struggle
[1:28:31] than the people who actually come in off
[1:28:32] the street because they can't really see
[1:28:36] a defining time or moment when that Holy
[1:28:39] Spirit comes into their
[1:28:41] lives and I'm not here to tell you one
[1:28:43] way or the other that it should be a
[1:28:44] lightning bolt experience or it should
[1:28:46] be just a blended Affair I'm not here to
[1:28:49] tell you that I just want to say get the
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost that's all and when you get
[1:28:52] it you know it brother bradam says it's
[1:28:54] just like having a baby you don't just
[1:28:55] have a baby and forget you had a
[1:28:57] baby all those sisters here that have
[1:29:00] had children you know what I mean it
[1:29:04] doesn't just happen and then you forget
[1:29:06] wow I forgot that I had a child doesn't
[1:29:10] happen but go up to the mountain and
[1:29:13] bring wood get busy do something about
[1:29:15] it and build the house he says amen and
[1:29:18] I will take pleasure in it and I will be
[1:29:23] glorified sayith the
[1:29:25] Lord sometimes in our lives we can try
[1:29:28] and make him glorified with our natural
[1:29:30] lives I got a business and I work
[1:29:35] hard he's not glorified in that brothers
[1:29:37] and sisters that's not his glory his
[1:29:40] glory is in this Temple he wants to see
[1:29:42] us build this Temple he wants to see us
[1:29:45] push aside all of our carnality all of
[1:29:48] our nonsense in our lives and get busy
[1:29:50] building the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:53] that's what he wants to see and then he
[1:29:55] will be glorified then he will take
[1:29:57] pleasure in it and I'll say this then
[1:30:00] he'll take pleasure in everything else
[1:30:02] in our lives and then he'll glorify
[1:30:04] himself in everything else in our lives
[1:30:06] if you want to see the Lord move in your
[1:30:08] life put him first and see if he doesn't
[1:30:11] bless every single area of your
[1:30:13] life go up to the mountain bring wood
[1:30:16] and build the house and I will take
[1:30:18] pleasure in it and I will be glorified
[1:30:20] sayith the Lord not you
[1:30:23] many times we could say wow look what
[1:30:24] I've
[1:30:25] done I've got all these trophies and
[1:30:28] accolades and things it's all for not
[1:30:31] it's all going to burn it's all a waste
[1:30:33] of time if we don't have him first in
[1:30:35] our
[1:30:36] lives verse 9 says ye looked for much
[1:30:39] and low it came to little and when you
[1:30:41] brought it home I did blow upon it why
[1:30:46] sayith the Lord of hosts because of mine
[1:30:49] house that is
[1:30:50] waste
[1:30:53] and you run every man into unto his own
[1:30:56] house therefore the heaven over you is
[1:30:59] stayed from Dew and the Earth is stayed
[1:31:01] from her
[1:31:02] fruit and I called for a drought upon
[1:31:04] the land and upon the mountains and upon
[1:31:07] the cornn and upon the new wine and upon
[1:31:10] the oil and upon that brothers and
[1:31:14] sisters we know this is this is
[1:31:19] serious if we're not willing to put God
[1:31:22] first then he will blow on our lives and
[1:31:26] he'll cause a drought to happen and as
[1:31:29] Sons and Daughters we'll go so
[1:31:31] far and then we'll begin to cry out
[1:31:34] because we can't stand it any longer it
[1:31:37] will drive us nuts we won't sleep we
[1:31:39] won't eat we won't be able to work it
[1:31:42] will make us mad in our heads we will
[1:31:45] have a desire to serve God we will cry
[1:31:48] out to God he will have his way in our
[1:31:51] lives he says and I called for a drought
[1:31:53] upon the land and upon the mountains and
[1:31:55] upon the corn and upon the new wine and
[1:31:57] upon the oil we know the corn is a type
[1:32:00] of food it's being able to actually
[1:32:03] partake of the food and and get fat
[1:32:05] inside our lives and the wine is the
[1:32:07] stimulation of Revelation and the oil is
[1:32:11] the spirit that comes along with that
[1:32:13] and we know the oil it causes a
[1:32:15] stimulation but here he says that you
[1:32:17] know what if you're not going to put me
[1:32:19] first you're going to have a lot of
[1:32:20] troubles you're going to have a lot of
[1:32:22] struggles in your life and you're going
[1:32:23] to wonder why you're going to ask why
[1:32:24] and I'm going to tell you it's because
[1:32:26] you haven't considered your ways you
[1:32:28] haven't really realized who deserves to
[1:32:30] be first in your life but when you
[1:32:32] decide that time will come if you're a
[1:32:34] son and daughter of God when you decide
[1:32:36] to put me first then you'll see fruit
[1:32:39] you will actually have corn you will
[1:32:41] have that wine and that oil in your life
[1:32:43] it will be there it won't stay that way
[1:32:47] forever I just think it's so rich this
[1:32:49] this study about zerubabel in ha Hagi
[1:32:53] chapter
[1:32:54] 2 verse
[1:32:57] 1 in the seventh month in the 1 and 20th
[1:33:01] day of the month came the word of the
[1:33:03] Lord by the prophet Hagi saying speak
[1:33:06] now to zerubabel the son of
[1:33:10] shaltiel governor of Judah and to Joshua
[1:33:14] the son of josec the high priest and to
[1:33:17] the residue of the people saying who is
[1:33:22] left among you that saw this house in
[1:33:26] her first Glory just going to pause
[1:33:29] there for a second because I think it's
[1:33:31] beautiful it kind of ties That headstone
[1:33:33] together because it doesn't say its
[1:33:35] Glory doesn't say his glory it says her
[1:33:41] glory we know the church is always
[1:33:43] represented as
[1:33:44] feminine he's the masculine she's the
[1:33:49] feminine who is left among you that saw
[1:33:52] this house in her first glory and how do
[1:33:55] ye see it now is it not in your your
[1:33:58] eyes in comparison of it as nothing yet
[1:34:02] now be strong o zerubabel saith the Lord
[1:34:05] and be strong oh Joshua son of josec the
[1:34:09] high priest and be strong all ye people
[1:34:12] of the land sayeth the
[1:34:15] Lord and
[1:34:17] work don't just wait for God to just let
[1:34:20] it flow down from the
[1:34:22] mountain because it's not gonna we've
[1:34:25] got to work we got to put our shoulders
[1:34:27] to the wheel we got to be willing to
[1:34:29] come to prayer meeting we got to be
[1:34:30] willing to come to service we got to be
[1:34:32] willing to come to communion we got to
[1:34:34] be willing to take God at his word
[1:34:35] brothers and sisters to see him move in
[1:34:37] our lives otherwise we're just going to
[1:34:39] be saying oh God just rain down your
[1:34:41] blessings on me I believe the message of
[1:34:43] the hour and it's not going to
[1:34:50] happen verse 5 according to the word
[1:34:53] that I covenanted with you when you came
[1:34:56] out of Egypt so it goes all the way back
[1:35:00] all the way back to all those people
[1:35:03] that actually were in bondage for 430
[1:35:07] years 440 years they were overtime in
[1:35:10] bondage and then they started to cry out
[1:35:12] and when they started to cry out God
[1:35:13] heard their cries didn't he brothers and
[1:35:16] sisters I can only think that they
[1:35:18] started working not just for not just
[1:35:20] for fa
[1:35:22] but they started to work for the Lord
[1:35:23] they started to actually think there's
[1:35:25] got to be another way there's got to be
[1:35:27] a better way there's a promise where's
[1:35:29] our promise and I just can't help but
[1:35:31] think as Sons and Daughters of the most
[1:35:33] high God we have got to be willing to
[1:35:35] cry out for that promise in our
[1:35:39] lives but we know he'll come verse 5
[1:35:43] according to the word that I covenanted
[1:35:44] with you when you came out of Egypt so
[1:35:46] my spirit remaineth among you fear ye
[1:35:50] not for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet
[1:35:53] once it is a little while and I will
[1:35:55] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[1:35:57] Sea and the dry land and I will shake
[1:35:59] All Nations and the desire of all
[1:36:01] Nations shall come and I will fill this
[1:36:04] house with Glory saith the Lord of
[1:36:08] hosts now this is important I think the
[1:36:11] silver is mine and the gold is mine
[1:36:13] sayeth the Lord of
[1:36:15] hosts the glory of this latter host
[1:36:18] shall be greater than the former am
[1:36:22] saith the Lord of hosts and in this
[1:36:26] place will I give peace saith the Lord
[1:36:29] of
[1:36:30] hosts brothers and sisters don't look at
[1:36:33] this as a as a zerubabel and if that's a
[1:36:36] word even uh Old Testament Temple even
[1:36:39] though it is look at it today as the
[1:36:42] Temple of the Holy
[1:36:44] Ghost Don't Be Afraid just March forward
[1:36:47] amen just trust in the Lord let it be
[1:36:50] his strength his might his power that
[1:36:53] does it it's only going to come by his
[1:36:56] Spirit but to think of these temples and
[1:37:00] how glorious they must have been even
[1:37:02] the second temple that was done by
[1:37:04] zerubabel and we know that he was
[1:37:06] commissioned to go and build this Temple
[1:37:08] we might have time to get into that
[1:37:09] today I don't know but he was
[1:37:10] commissioned by the king to go and build
[1:37:12] this Temple the one who actually had him
[1:37:15] in in in captivity there came a time
[1:37:18] where they were released by The King to
[1:37:20] go back and were funded by the king to
[1:37:22] go back and actually build this Temple
[1:37:25] go and restore this Temple and it's
[1:37:27] amazing because Daniel is one of the key
[1:37:29] figures that actually allowed for this
[1:37:31] to happen and Daniel didn't even get to
[1:37:33] go back and see
[1:37:35] it but we have zerubabel here he is this
[1:37:38] one that went with Nehemiah and all the
[1:37:41] others to go and actually see this
[1:37:42] Temple
[1:37:44] restored and that Glory of that Temple
[1:37:47] must have been something I can only
[1:37:48] imagine it would be something to see not
[1:37:51] not that it would be maybe as fantastic
[1:37:53] as Solomon's but if you consider all of
[1:37:56] the oppression and all of the struggle
[1:37:58] that they must have went through all of
[1:38:00] the work that they must have done to
[1:38:03] restore this Temple what that Glory must
[1:38:06] have been like and you know brothers and
[1:38:08] sisters for those people who are around
[1:38:10] anyone who has ever experienced it
[1:38:12] before when we got this building and we
[1:38:14] renovated this building there was a lot
[1:38:15] of work that went into it there was a
[1:38:17] lot of people putting their shoulder to
[1:38:19] the wheel to make this building right
[1:38:22] here in Calgary operational for the for
[1:38:25] the services that we now have I can only
[1:38:28] imagine what that Temple must have been
[1:38:30] like but to think it was restored and
[1:38:35] the glory of this latter house shall be
[1:38:38] greater than of the former saeth the
[1:38:41] Lord of hosts and in this place will I
[1:38:44] give peace saith the Lord of
[1:38:47] hosts now what place brothers and
[1:38:50] sisters not this building in Calgary not
[1:38:53] that Temple there you am me we've been
[1:38:58] talking about it on Wednesdays the
[1:38:59] Sabbath rest there is a rest but it's
[1:39:03] behind the inner Veil and we've got to
[1:39:06] be willing to go in behind that inner
[1:39:08] Veil the only way we're going to ever be
[1:39:11] able to go in behind that inner Veil if
[1:39:13] you know the word of God if you know God
[1:39:16] to be a living God you're not going to
[1:39:18] just walk in behind that inner Veil
[1:39:21] because we know that means certain death
[1:39:24] as a human but if you get his Spirit on
[1:39:27] the inside to stay out means death and
[1:39:31] we know once upon a time back in the
[1:39:32] Garden of Eden there was cherubims that
[1:39:34] were set with a flaming sword keeping
[1:39:37] every single way to the tree of life and
[1:39:39] that was to stop man from being able to
[1:39:42] just have eternal life because man was
[1:39:44] promised the soon as soon as you disobey
[1:39:48] my word as soon as you step out from
[1:39:50] behind my word is the day you will die
[1:39:52] and we know that that's what happened he
[1:39:54] knew what was going on he stepped out
[1:39:56] and that was what stopped man from being
[1:39:59] able to get to the tree of life so God
[1:40:00] put those flaming swords in front of it
[1:40:02] but now after Calvary we know those
[1:40:05] flaming swords were pulled away and to
[1:40:08] actually resist going into that means
[1:40:11] death now once upon a time to go and put
[1:40:14] ourselves in front of those flaming
[1:40:15] swords it meant death now to to to
[1:40:19] resist it to not do it it means death
[1:40:21] and we know we could say it this way to
[1:40:23] resist the baptism of the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:25] say I whatever whatever you want to say
[1:40:28] about it to resist the baptism of the
[1:40:30] Holy Spirit to resist the spirit of
[1:40:32] Jesus Christ to resist actually getting
[1:40:34] our temples completely ready is to
[1:40:35] accept the mark of the beast because
[1:40:37] these bodies these temples are already
[1:40:39] marked with the mark of the beast unless
[1:40:42] you are a son and daughter of God and if
[1:40:44] you are a son and daughter of God then
[1:40:45] you will come completely in line with
[1:40:47] this word there's no way that you will
[1:40:49] not receive the message of the hour for
[1:40:51] your day if you're a son and daughter of
[1:40:53] God the glory of this latter house these
[1:40:57] bodies these temples shall be greater
[1:41:00] than the former saith the Lord of hosts
[1:41:03] and you know we've talked about it
[1:41:04] you've heard it many times the prophets
[1:41:06] say it many other ministers I'm sure say
[1:41:08] it when we get over there to the other
[1:41:10] side we're going to say Noah what was it
[1:41:11] like to beat on the wood all those years
[1:41:14] and only have eight Souls get in the
[1:41:16] boat Nehemiah what was it like to go
[1:41:18] back and rebuild the Temple Solomon what
[1:41:20] was it it like to have all that
[1:41:22] knowledge all these people Saul what was
[1:41:25] it like to be the first king of Israel
[1:41:27] we're going to ask all these people
[1:41:29] we're going to desire it they're going
[1:41:30] to say no no no no no no no forget about
[1:41:32] all that what about you how did you
[1:41:35] overcome with a lid of Hell being taken
[1:41:38] off in your
[1:41:40] age and thousands times thousands of
[1:41:43] devils chasing you down day and night
[1:41:46] there is a rest for you brothers and
[1:41:48] sisters there's a rest for us if we're
[1:41:50] willing to accept accept it the way that
[1:41:51] God's given it to
[1:41:54] us but if we choose to actually try and
[1:41:57] do it our way then he has to fold his
[1:41:59] hands and say I don't know what to tell
[1:42:02] you I'm probably just going to blow on
[1:42:05] your house on your temple on your on
[1:42:07] your life I'm going to blow on it and
[1:42:08] just cause a little bit of a Dro a
[1:42:09] little bit of a time where you're going
[1:42:11] to have a little bit of a struggle
[1:42:12] there's going to be a little bit of a
[1:42:13] problem and and when you're ready you're
[1:42:15] going to come back and you're going to
[1:42:16] say restore unto me Lord
[1:42:19] all my goodness he knows exactly what we
[1:42:22] need the message of Grace in
[1:42:26] 1961 brother bradam I I think it's just
[1:42:29] this such a good message brothers and
[1:42:31] sisters they all are I know butth this
[1:42:33] one here is just what's really doing it
[1:42:35] for me as of late in paragraph 46 he
[1:42:38] says then I chose this morning being
[1:42:42] that being that that message was so
[1:42:46] attacked another thing that I'm so
[1:42:49] gotten after
[1:42:52] about is preaching Grace
[1:42:56] wow I want to speak on that this morning
[1:43:00] as I read the fourth chapter of
[1:43:02] Zechariah a portion of it I just think
[1:43:05] that's so beautiful brothers and sisters
[1:43:07] and I want you to know my heart it's not
[1:43:10] to cre to preach condemnation it's not
[1:43:12] to preach destruction it's not to preach
[1:43:16] a a a famine in the land it's to preach
[1:43:19] Grace we've been given an Open Door
[1:43:21] we've been given the full book full
[1:43:23] complete access Hallelujah to the full
[1:43:26] mind of God and all we have to do is
[1:43:29] step forward we have to be willing to
[1:43:31] take the steps to do it though and I
[1:43:33] just will say it again our lives we are
[1:43:37] the Temple of the Holy Ghost we'll get
[1:43:39] to that scripture it's coming we're
[1:43:40] going to bring it into the New Testament
[1:43:42] here if we have time um but you know how
[1:43:45] we have this Temple be in the Holy Ghost
[1:43:47] it's not this building would we bring
[1:43:49] our private lives into this building I
[1:43:52] don't
[1:43:52] know some people they might want to
[1:43:55] actually put the hockey game up here and
[1:43:57] play the hockey game is that going to
[1:44:00] please the Holy Ghost some people might
[1:44:02] want World Cup
[1:44:04] soccer some people might want
[1:44:08] YouTube now I'm going to really pinch a
[1:44:10] little bit but some people might want
[1:44:12] video
[1:44:13] games and I'm going to say this if we're
[1:44:15] going to put video games up on the
[1:44:17] screen what kind of video games are
[1:44:19] they are there any that please the Holy
[1:44:25] Ghost now we could say well there's some
[1:44:28] that you know some video games are just
[1:44:31] good video games and they teach us good
[1:44:32] things what's the inspiration behind
[1:44:34] them who are the people that created
[1:44:36] those video games are they people
[1:44:38] Anointed with the Holy Ghost are they
[1:44:40] people that are true Christian Believers
[1:44:43] in our day are they the ones that are
[1:44:46] creating these video games that we're
[1:44:48] actually feeding our minds on feeding
[1:44:50] and feeding and feeding because if they
[1:44:53] are then I would say Amen they'll have
[1:44:54] scriptures in them they'll probably have
[1:44:56] message in it and it'll be good it'll be
[1:44:57] edifying to the body but if it's not
[1:44:59] brothers and sisters what's it doing to
[1:45:01] you is it consecrating your temple right
[1:45:05] what else do we look at on the internet
[1:45:07] would we want to bring that up on the
[1:45:08] screens here would we be comfortable if
[1:45:11] we knew that this is what brother so and
[1:45:12] so this is his thing this is what he
[1:45:14] likes to watch this is what sister so
[1:45:16] and so does in her time this is what we
[1:45:18] do as a body of Believers if we can't do
[1:45:20] that in this building then why on Earth
[1:45:22] do we do it and call ourselves message
[1:45:25] Believers brothers and sisters this is
[1:45:28] the consecration that God's looking for
[1:45:30] he ain't looking for people that are
[1:45:32] busy slopping around like brother bradam
[1:45:34] says in the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:45:36] of Jesus Christ kissing and slopping
[1:45:38] with all the Hollywood stuff that's
[1:45:39] going on and then claiming to be the
[1:45:41] Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:46] yes that's a lie of the
[1:45:49] devil what's the inspiration behind
[1:45:52] whatever it is we're
[1:45:53] into I know I pinched on video games but
[1:45:56] what is it what what are we into what do
[1:45:57] we do with our time outside of this
[1:46:00] building is it edifying to your body to
[1:46:03] your
[1:46:04] temple do you believe that scripture
[1:46:06] that you really are that we really are
[1:46:07] the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen and as
[1:46:10] I'm saying this I'm saying it to me
[1:46:11] brothers and sisters do I believe that I
[1:46:13] am the Temple of the Holy Ghost well if
[1:46:15] I am then I want to say this God's
[1:46:17] calling me to a greater Consecration and
[1:46:19] I know God's calling you to a greater
[1:46:21] consecration because we are the Temple
[1:46:23] of the Holy Ghost so maybe in 2024
[1:46:27] Brothers and Sisters Let's push aside
[1:46:28] all the nonsense and just get into
[1:46:31] Christ and I can't help but think in my
[1:46:34] own life in my own experience I know
[1:46:37] that I've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:39] Ghost because you know it when you know
[1:46:41] it but there's times where we get
[1:46:45] sidetracked and he just brother bradam
[1:46:48] says it just like a dove he'll just go
[1:46:49] and set up on a a branch and just wait
[1:46:52] until we actually get things
[1:46:53] straightened out what if we didn't have
[1:46:56] to wait till we get things straightened
[1:46:57] out brothers and sisters there's times
[1:47:00] in our life where we need to be able to
[1:47:01] speak the word and if we're not ready if
[1:47:05] we're like brother bradam remember the
[1:47:06] story where brother bradam was there and
[1:47:08] he had the tax case and we know the tax
[1:47:09] lawyer whatever was calling and I think
[1:47:11] it was his wife or his daughter that
[1:47:13] answered the phone and and and and said
[1:47:15] you know is is William brandom there and
[1:47:17] he was there and he knew who it was on
[1:47:19] the phone and he said I'm not here and
[1:47:21] he stepped
[1:47:23] outside remember that that story he knew
[1:47:26] that he couldn't go and pray for
[1:47:28] anyone because he lied that's
[1:47:31] true don't think that that's exclusive
[1:47:33] just because he was a prophet in the
[1:47:35] prophet's office that that changed
[1:47:37] things for him and God that's the way it
[1:47:39] is for every son and daughter of
[1:47:42] God you know that it says that there
[1:47:45] will be no place in the Kingdom of
[1:47:47] Heaven for
[1:47:48] liars amen and it doesn't say big hairy
[1:47:52] black
[1:47:54] lies or little microscopic teeny white
[1:47:57] ones which one's a
[1:48:02] lie we need to know where we stand
[1:48:04] brothers and sisters this is no joke
[1:48:05] this is no time you know what the devil
[1:48:07] is roaming about as a roaring line
[1:48:09] seeking who he may devour and he just
[1:48:12] loves to eat
[1:48:13] children now I'm not saying not to scare
[1:48:16] the children I'm saying it really to
[1:48:17] scare the parents because you're the
[1:48:19] Holy Ghost for your children until the
[1:48:21] day of
[1:48:22] accountability so where do we
[1:48:25] stand do we just let our children go and
[1:48:27] do whatever yeah that's fine just do
[1:48:29] whatever you want you know one of the
[1:48:30] biggest problems that we face today is
[1:48:34] screens let's just call it out brothers
[1:48:37] and sisters they're of the devil there's
[1:48:40] a reason why there's screens in
[1:48:42] everybody's pocket in everybody's hand
[1:48:45] is so that they can have a pipeline to
[1:48:47] the devil to the tree of knowledge of
[1:48:50] good good and evil instead of the tree
[1:48:52] of life right if you think about it you
[1:48:55] can say well I've got the screen and
[1:48:57] I've got the message on it you know that
[1:48:59] if you look at the app I wonder if we
[1:49:01] could do this someone might be smart
[1:49:02] enough to do it what percentage of the
[1:49:05] entire internet pipeline of information
[1:49:08] would the message of the hour be what
[1:49:11] percentage of that would it be do we
[1:49:13] really need
[1:49:15] screens some people will have the tablet
[1:49:17] where they will just say it's connected
[1:49:18] to Jeffersonville and you know I don't
[1:49:20] want to get into that either but you
[1:49:22] know what if we have a screen what are
[1:49:23] we doing with it that's what I want to
[1:49:25] say what are we doing with it if we got
[1:49:27] a screen we need to be very very very
[1:49:30] careful with our screens especially when
[1:49:32] it comes to our
[1:49:34] children Ezra chapter
[1:49:37] 5 Ezra chapter
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:45] 5 what
[1:49:47] house are you building them
[1:49:53] Ezra chapter
[1:50:09] 5 start reading with ver verse
[1:50:13] two then rose up zerubabel the son of
[1:50:16] Shel
[1:50:17] Tiel and jesua the son of josec and
[1:50:23] began to build the house of God which is
[1:50:25] at Jerusalem and with them were the
[1:50:28] prophets of God helping
[1:50:31] them at the same time came to them Tatai
[1:50:36] governor on this side of the river oh my
[1:50:40] and
[1:50:40] sherar
[1:50:42] Bai and their
[1:50:44] Companions and said thus unto
[1:50:47] them who hath commanded you
[1:50:51] to build this house and to make up this
[1:50:56] wall I just think it's a beautiful thing
[1:51:00] here I'm just going to pause
[1:51:03] there bear with me for a
[1:51:18] second
[1:51:20] oh my I'm just going to do this this way
[1:51:24] I think it's interesting when we look at
[1:51:26] this here how we have oh I can do it
[1:51:30] this way bear with me for a
[1:51:32] second there we
[1:51:36] go then rose up zerubabel the son of
[1:51:39] Shel jesua the son of josac and began to
[1:51:43] build the house of God which is at
[1:51:44] Jerusalem and with them were the
[1:51:47] prophets of God helping them at the same
[1:51:50] time came them Tatai governor on this
[1:51:54] side the river and sherar bosai and
[1:51:58] their Companions and said thus and said
[1:52:02] thus unto them who hath commanded you to
[1:52:06] build this house and to make up this
[1:52:09] wall then said we unto them after this
[1:52:12] manner what are the names of the men
[1:52:15] that make this
[1:52:16] building my they're really taken note
[1:52:19] they're really trying to dig in to see
[1:52:21] what's going on
[1:52:23] here but the eye of their God was upon
[1:52:27] the Elders of the
[1:52:28] Jews that they could not cause them to
[1:52:31] cease till the matter came to Darius
[1:52:34] right and then they returned answer by
[1:52:36] letter concerning this matter the copy
[1:52:40] of the letter that Tatai the governor on
[1:52:42] this side the
[1:52:44] river and shethar bosai and his
[1:52:48] companions the
[1:52:51] aites which were on this side the river
[1:52:54] sent unto Darius the king they sent a
[1:52:56] letter unto him whereon was written thus
[1:53:00] unto Darius the king all peace be it
[1:53:03] known unto the king that we went into
[1:53:05] the province of Judea to the house of
[1:53:08] the great God which is builded with
[1:53:11] great stones and Timber is laid in the
[1:53:14] walls and this work goeth fast on and
[1:53:18] prospereth in their
[1:53:21] hands then asked we those elders and
[1:53:24] said unto them thus who commanded you to
[1:53:28] build this house and to make up these
[1:53:32] walls we asked their names also to
[1:53:36] certify thee that we might write the
[1:53:38] names of the men that were chief of
[1:53:43] them and thus they returned us answer
[1:53:47] saying we are the Servants of the god
[1:53:49] God Of Heaven and Earth and build a
[1:53:52] house that was builded these many years
[1:53:55] ago which a great king of Israel builded
[1:53:58] and set up but after that our fathers
[1:54:02] had provoked the god of Heaven unto
[1:54:05] wrath he gave them into the hand of
[1:54:08] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the
[1:54:10] chaldon who destroyed this house and
[1:54:14] carried the people away into
[1:54:17] Babylon but in the first year of of
[1:54:19] Cyrus the king of Babylon the same King
[1:54:23] Cyrus made a decree to build this house
[1:54:27] of
[1:54:28] God and the vessels also of gold and
[1:54:31] silver of the house of God which
[1:54:34] Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple
[1:54:36] that was in Jerusalem and brought them
[1:54:38] into the Temple of Babylon those did
[1:54:41] Cyrus the king take out of the Temple of
[1:54:43] Babylon and they were delivered unto one
[1:54:46] whose name was Shish Bazar
[1:54:50] whom he had made
[1:54:53] governor and said unto him take these
[1:54:56] vessels go carry them into the temple
[1:54:58] that is in Jerusalem and let the house
[1:55:01] of God be build it in this place then
[1:55:03] came the same Shish Bazar and laid the
[1:55:07] foundation of the house of God which is
[1:55:09] in Jerusalem and since that time even
[1:55:12] until now hath it been in building and
[1:55:17] yet is not finished
[1:55:20] now therefore if it seem good to the
[1:55:22] king Let There Be search made in the
[1:55:23] king's Treasure House which is there at
[1:55:26] Babylon whether it be so that a decree
[1:55:29] was made of Cyrus the king to build this
[1:55:32] house of God at Jerusalem and let the
[1:55:35] king send his pleasure concerning this
[1:55:40] matter bear with me for one second here
[1:55:44] I think it's beautiful this scripture to
[1:55:48] recognize we
[1:55:51] have Shish
[1:55:53] Bazar building this
[1:55:57] Temple and while he's there under the
[1:56:00] commission of the
[1:56:01] king he gets
[1:56:04] naysayers he gets people who want to
[1:56:06] come and question him about his motive
[1:56:09] and about his objective and say to him
[1:56:12] what on Earth are you doing here why are
[1:56:15] you doing this who gives you the
[1:56:17] authority to do this
[1:56:20] I can't help but think it's a little bit
[1:56:21] like brother bradam
[1:56:23] heard who gave you the authority to heal
[1:56:26] John
[1:56:28] Ryan and he said straight out it was
[1:56:31] Jesus Christ it was the Lord Jesus
[1:56:33] Christ but here we have these guys
[1:56:35] trying to give them trouble and say why
[1:56:37] do you think you can build this who
[1:56:39] gives you authority to do this and they
[1:56:41] say you know what we're not even going
[1:56:42] to give you our names no you got to give
[1:56:44] us your names we're taking names and
[1:56:47] phone numbers and we're going to the
[1:56:48] king with this because you're not
[1:56:51] authorized but they had a greater King's
[1:56:54] authorization and you know brothers and
[1:56:56] sisters even while they were laid waste
[1:57:00] that Temple was laid waste they were
[1:57:02] taken away into captivity because of
[1:57:04] their
[1:57:04] misbehavior God restored them back to
[1:57:07] the same condition and he not only
[1:57:10] restored them back to go build that
[1:57:12] Temple he gave them everything that they
[1:57:14] needed to do
[1:57:16] it so brothers and sisters you can draw
[1:57:18] the parallels to today as we go if we've
[1:57:21] gone Wayward if we've had times in our
[1:57:23] life where we've had the Lord blow on
[1:57:25] our life because of misbehavior it's not
[1:57:27] too late he's still calling and if we're
[1:57:30] willing to just get in line with his
[1:57:32] word he will bless us with all of the
[1:57:35] blessings that we need he'll give us all
[1:57:37] of the stuff that we need to bring
[1:57:38] proper worship unto
[1:57:41] him he doesn't want to leave us out to
[1:57:44] pasture he doesn't want to see us going
[1:57:47] the wrong way he wants us to worship Him
[1:57:49] the the right way amen and we need to
[1:57:52] recognize that this is the Temple of the
[1:57:54] Holy
[1:57:55] Ghost Zachariah four Grace Grace unto it
[1:57:59] The Headstone the
[1:58:02] feminine then he answered and spake unto
[1:58:05] me saying this is the word of the Lord
[1:58:07] unto zerubabel and just for the record
[1:58:10] that that that name uh sh I can't
[1:58:13] remember shajar that is the I think it's
[1:58:16] the Persian name for zerubabel
[1:58:20] it's the same
[1:58:21] person I meant to say that earlier then
[1:58:23] he answered and spake unto me saying
[1:58:25] this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:58:26] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[1:58:28] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[1:58:31] hosts who art thou great Mountain before
[1:58:34] zerubabel that shall become a plane and
[1:58:37] I want to say who is that mountain
[1:58:39] before you today brothers and sisters
[1:58:41] that shall become a plane whatever it is
[1:58:43] that's in front of you it shall become a
[1:58:47] plane and he shalling bring forth The
[1:58:50] Headstone the
[1:58:52] feminine the
[1:58:54] feminine thereof with shoutings crying
[1:58:57] Grace Grace unto it I just can't help
[1:59:01] but think brothers and sisters when we
[1:59:02] truly catch this revelation of Jesus
[1:59:04] Christ that this headstone is the
[1:59:07] feminine it is the church we've been
[1:59:08] given the opportunity to come and
[1:59:10] worship Him freely in spirit and in
[1:59:12] truth all the way that he desires if
[1:59:14] we're willing to consecrate Our Lives we
[1:59:17] have the ability to cry Grace Grace unto
[1:59:20] it we recognize it there's nothing going
[1:59:22] to hold us
[1:59:23] back I just heard brother bradam say it
[1:59:26] again yesterday I thought it was so good
[1:59:27] you know guy talks about how he gets a
[1:59:29] shiver oh my there's someone always
[1:59:31] saying amen so loud in a service and and
[1:59:34] he says you know what if you get a
[1:59:35] shiver here you're going to freeze to
[1:59:36] death up there right because if you
[1:59:39] think this is loud it ain't nothing
[1:59:41] compared to the sound that's going to be
[1:59:42] made up there and you know what it's
[1:59:44] loud down there as well so you might as
[1:59:45] well just get used to just giving God
[1:59:47] glory brothers and sisters cry and Grace
[1:59:50] Grace unto him for what he's done for
[1:59:53] us this is the quietest place we're ever
[1:59:56] going to be imagine that all Heaven is
[1:59:59] going to stop to listen to the redeemed
[2:00:02] worship those people that recognize
[2:00:04] there ain't nothing I ever done he just
[2:00:06] chose me in him before the foundation of
[2:00:08] the world and one day I just had the
[2:00:10] ability to recognize it I could see that
[2:00:13] that it was my name that was written in
[2:00:15] that book that John when he wept greatly
[2:00:17] because no man was worthy to take that
[2:00:20] book out of the hand of him that sat
[2:00:22] upon the throne in heaven or in Earth or
[2:00:24] under the Earth no man was worthy oh my
[2:00:27] but then he saw a bloody lamb step
[2:00:29] forward and take that book and John was
[2:00:31] weeping because he recognized that
[2:00:33] Redemption was there that everybody who
[2:00:36] ever would be saved was in that book at
[2:00:38] that
[2:00:40] moment verse eight says moreover the
[2:00:42] word of the Lord came unto me saying the
[2:00:44] hands of zerubabel hath laid the
[2:00:46] foundation of this house and His Hands
[2:00:48] shall shall also finish it and thou
[2:00:51] shalt know that the Lord of hosts has
[2:00:53] sent me unto you now brothers and
[2:00:55] sisters maybe I'll get a little
[2:00:56] sacrilege this morning just in the last
[2:00:58] 10 minutes here but I can't help but
[2:01:00] think that you know in this day and age
[2:01:02] we have had as a rubel lay the
[2:01:04] foundation for us and and you know what
[2:01:06] there's hands that are finishing this
[2:01:08] Temple we have had a prophet in our day
[2:01:11] come and lay this foundation for us so
[2:01:14] that we can go forwards and you know
[2:01:15] brother Bram says it in the message of
[2:01:17] the hour he says that you know there's
[2:01:19] things that aren't completely explained
[2:01:21] and it's going to take you ministers to
[2:01:22] go and explain it to dig a little deeper
[2:01:24] and go further with it but this message
[2:01:27] is a message of Grace this is not a
[2:01:30] message of legalism a message of
[2:01:33] legalistic behavior to look down our
[2:01:35] nose at anybody else our brothers our
[2:01:37] sisters Sinners on the street the only
[2:01:39] reason we're not Sinners on the street
[2:01:41] is because of Grace because of his
[2:01:45] grace how easy is it to worship brothers
[2:01:47] and sisters when we re recognize his
[2:01:49] grace this message is of Grace it's not
[2:01:52] of disgrace it's not of saying I can
[2:01:54] just do whatever I want either because I
[2:01:56] know that I'm going to be saved because
[2:01:57] of predestination from before the
[2:01:59] foundation of the world I could just do
[2:02:01] whatever I want to do no you
[2:02:03] can't and you know what you'll do if you
[2:02:05] have his Spirit you'll do exactly what
[2:02:07] the word of God tells us to do that's
[2:02:09] what we will do that will be our
[2:02:10] Behavior we'll be able to live our
[2:02:12] private lives right here in this
[2:02:14] building and not have any fear that's
[2:02:17] right I say Lord help me I like to do
[2:02:21] Woodworking and it would get messy in
[2:02:23] here but you know brothers and sisters
[2:02:25] I've looked at things on screens I've
[2:02:27] heard music I'm not going to pretend to
[2:02:29] be innocent here I'm a human being just
[2:02:32] like everyone else but I want to
[2:02:34] consecrate my life so it is acceptable
[2:02:37] in his sight don't you
[2:02:39] today this is going home time this is
[2:02:42] going to take more faith than any other
[2:02:44] age rapturing faith is what we're after
[2:02:46] the only way that we're going to get to
[2:02:48] it is to get busy is he
[2:02:50] building build that Temple Amen brother
[2:02:53] bradam in the message of Grace in
[2:02:56] paragraph 53 says now remember in our
[2:02:59] teaching on the lessons that we've just
[2:03:02] been through that we took the Great
[2:03:04] Pyramid and studied that for a while
[2:03:06] that Enoch must have built and The
[2:03:08] Headstone was never put on the pyramid
[2:03:10] I've been there the architecture of it
[2:03:13] could never be replaced till this day we
[2:03:15] have no machines that could build a
[2:03:17] pyramid no powers less the atomic power
[2:03:20] that could build a pyramid because it's
[2:03:22] too gigantic stones that would weigh
[2:03:25] tons and tons and tons stands way in the
[2:03:28] air so put together that even a thin
[2:03:31] razor blade could not and they're not
[2:03:33] cemented they're just cut so they'll
[2:03:35] Join one with another and that's the way
[2:03:39] the body of Christ should be so cut by
[2:03:42] the Holy Spirit by God's Great
[2:03:44] instrument and tool that we'd be joined
[2:03:47] as one person
[2:03:50] we're not divided we should be one
[2:03:52] person and it goes to show that no
[2:03:55] Machinery can do that way it takes God
[2:03:58] to do that no mechanics of
[2:04:02] organization no lodges none of these
[2:04:05] things can ever do
[2:04:07] it as good as their intentions
[2:04:09] are my sometimes we've got real good
[2:04:13] intentions we know the bylaws we we know
[2:04:16] that what brother Bram said we've got
[2:04:18] all our quotes for our side of the table
[2:04:19] in our argument we we know all of it
[2:04:22] right what is it brothers and sisters is
[2:04:24] it his Spirit or is it our spirit right
[2:04:29] we should be one person and it goes to
[2:04:31] show that no Machinery can do that way
[2:04:34] it takes God to do that no mechanics of
[2:04:36] organization no lodges none of these
[2:04:38] things can ever do it as good as their
[2:04:40] intentions are they can never do it
[2:04:43] because it takes God to do this the Holy
[2:04:46] Spirit to build this Temple
[2:04:49] it takes his holy spirit to do this
[2:04:51] brothers and sisters that's the only way
[2:04:53] it will ever happen you know turn with
[2:04:57] me over to the book of Acts we've still
[2:04:59] got six minutes
[2:05:00] here I really don't want to keep us long
[2:05:03] because we've got service tonight I
[2:05:05] really don't want to keep us late
[2:05:06] tonight because I know we have young
[2:05:08] children that have
[2:05:11] school what a wonderful time it is to
[2:05:13] get together and just have a communion
[2:05:17] service
[2:05:19] Acts chapter
[2:05:26] 7 what else what house will you build
[2:05:32] them we know this is the story of
[2:05:34] stepen preached to him a good one preach
[2:05:37] to him a Zinger preached a sermon that
[2:05:38] pierced the heart of the most religious
[2:05:40] people in their day and at the end of it
[2:05:43] he says but s verse 47 sorry of Acts
[2:05:46] chapter
[2:05:47] 7
[2:05:49] verse 47 of Acts chapter
[2:05:53] 7 but Solomon built him and
[2:05:59] house how be it the most high dwelleth
[2:06:02] not in temples made with hands as saith
[2:06:05] the prophet Heaven is my throne and
[2:06:07] Earth is my foot stol what house will
[2:06:11] you build me sayith the Lord or what is
[2:06:14] the place of my rest he's not interested
[2:06:18] in a building we know that after Calvary
[2:06:22] that was over and he proved it by making
[2:06:25] the very first order of his business to
[2:06:27] go from the cross into the temple and to
[2:06:30] tear that that Veil where it held people
[2:06:33] out for centuries people were held out
[2:06:36] from going behind that inner Veil only
[2:06:38] the the high priest could do it and what
[2:06:40] did he do his first order of business
[2:06:42] was to rip that Veil from top to bottom
[2:06:44] to say it is no longer going to be
[2:06:46] religion you are no long longer going to
[2:06:49] build a temple and actually offer
[2:06:51] sacrifices because I am the sacrifice I
[2:06:54] am the one that was torn so that you can
[2:06:58] come in and actually be Sanctified now
[2:07:00] because you are the temple it is not God
[2:07:03] going to build a building anymore no
[2:07:06] more Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[2:07:09] foot stol what house will ye build me
[2:07:11] saith the Lord or what is the place of
[2:07:13] my rest he is not looking for a building
[2:07:16] he's looking for hearts in sons and
[2:07:18] Daughters of God surrendered hearts of
[2:07:21] Sons and Daughters of God consecrated
[2:07:24] hearts of Sons and Daughters of God and
[2:07:26] you know brothers and sisters when we
[2:07:27] get to that place when we do that when
[2:07:29] we take the extra effort and build that
[2:07:31] Temple this Temple clean it out
[2:07:35] consecrate it when we take that effort
[2:07:37] to build it like we said going to the
[2:07:39] mountain to heue down the wood to come
[2:07:40] back to build the temple we've got to do
[2:07:42] the work we got to come to church that's
[2:07:44] our mountain to climb the devil don't
[2:07:45] want us to come to church we got to come
[2:07:47] to church on Wednesday night the devil
[2:07:49] don't want us to come to church come to
[2:07:51] church and cut down some trees on
[2:07:52] Wednesday night brothers and sisters and
[2:07:54] see if God won't bless you see if he
[2:07:56] won't give you all the instruments of
[2:07:57] worship that you need my goodness he
[2:08:00] will give you all the gold and silver
[2:08:01] that you need because it's all his we
[2:08:03] read it
[2:08:05] earlier Corinthians 6 1 Corinthians 6
[2:08:09] let's turn there quickly in the last
[2:08:11] couple minutes I'll call the musicians
[2:08:12] just to prove I'm closing 1 Corinthians
[2:08:17] 6
[2:08:19] very familiar scripture
[2:08:22] here 1 Corinthians 6:
[2:08:26] 19 now this is really where I want to
[2:08:28] get to and maybe we'll get into it at a
[2:08:29] later date because we're out of
[2:08:32] time 1 Corinthians 6 what know ye not
[2:08:36] that your body is a temple of the Holy
[2:08:39] Ghost which is in you which ye have of
[2:08:43] God and ye are not your
[2:08:47] own for ye are bought with a
[2:08:51] price therefore glorify God in your
[2:08:55] body and in your spirit which are
[2:08:59] gods don't think that our our spiritual
[2:09:02] walk is simply at church and then we can
[2:09:04] just get into the world and then we can
[2:09:06] just do whatever we want with our lives
[2:09:07] brothers and sisters no no no no no no
[2:09:09] no no what happens is we wind up leaving
[2:09:12] Christ right
[2:09:13] here which is terrible who wants to
[2:09:15] leave Christ right here I don't think
[2:09:17] anybody does
[2:09:19] if we're willing to take a look at this
[2:09:21] I would recommend going and reading it
[2:09:22] maybe later this is speaking about
[2:09:24] something very specific it's speaking
[2:09:26] about
[2:09:27] fornication specifically speaking of
[2:09:31] natural and spiritual
[2:09:33] fornication Paul Jesus Christ to the
[2:09:36] church through the Apostle for the first
[2:09:39] age bringing this message to the church
[2:09:42] very specifically and you know it's good
[2:09:45] to go back and read maybe the the verses
[2:09:47] before and afterwards just to see what
[2:09:49] it says 1 Corinthians 6:13 it says Meats
[2:09:52] for the belly and belly for the meats
[2:09:54] the natural things are the natural
[2:09:55] things brothers and sisters they're
[2:09:58] there Meats for the belly and belly for
[2:10:00] the meats but God shall destroy both it
[2:10:03] and them this flesh is not going to
[2:10:06] inherit eternal life right every one of
[2:10:09] our bodies is going to perish we've got
[2:10:12] scars in our Spirits we've got scars in
[2:10:15] our flesh all of it's going to perish
[2:10:18] the only thing that's going to live is
[2:10:20] our soul if we have that Holy Ghost seal
[2:10:23] of God in our lives and you know if we
[2:10:26] have it then we don't have to
[2:10:28] worry goes on to say but God shall
[2:10:30] destroy both it and them now the body is
[2:10:33] not for
[2:10:34] fornication but for the
[2:10:37] Lord and the Lord for the
[2:10:39] body and God hath both raised up the
[2:10:43] Lord and will also raise us up by his
[2:10:47] own
[2:10:49] power not by
[2:10:52] strength nor by
[2:10:54] might but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[2:10:58] he'll do the work brothers and sisters
[2:10:59] if we're willing to surrender to him you
[2:11:01] know looking at this Greek word it's
[2:11:03] just I thought so good to go and look at
[2:11:05] it
[2:11:07] 4202 this word fornication just to just
[2:11:11] to look at it and see really where it's
[2:11:13] at and you know what the uh the word is
[2:11:17] the pronunciation
[2:11:19] is is
[2:11:20] pora sound familiar pora the definition
[2:11:25] is from from G 4203 it's harlotry
[2:11:28] including adultery and incest
[2:11:30] figuratively idolatry fornication that
[2:11:34] kind of surprised me the other one the
[2:11:37] 4203 is is porn porn
[2:11:41] Yu the ACT to act the Harlot that is
[2:11:45] literally indulge unlawful lust of
[2:11:48] either sex or figuratively practice
[2:11:51] idolatry to commit
[2:11:54] fornication I understood this for the
[2:11:56] longest time that this was the unclean
[2:11:58] act between human beings but isn't it
[2:12:01] interesting to say this the the the
[2:12:03] definition is actually idolatry also
[2:12:06] it's right there hand to glove so
[2:12:09] brothers and sisters if we put anything
[2:12:11] before Christ remember what the prophet
[2:12:13] said if we put anything before Christ
[2:12:15] that's
[2:12:16] idolatry if we put our job
[2:12:18] if we put our family if we put our
[2:12:21] church if we put our careers if we put
[2:12:23] our education whatever it is if we put
[2:12:25] it before Christ that's idolatry and
[2:12:28] that's the same sin as
[2:12:31] fornication I think it's incredible to
[2:12:33] look at that you know when we're talking
[2:12:35] about this rest there is a rest brothers
[2:12:37] and sisters but it's behind that inner
[2:12:39] Veil and that inner Veil Now isn't in a
[2:12:41] temple built with hands it's actually in
[2:12:43] the hearts of the Believers and it's not
[2:12:45] a day and it's not a place it's not some
[2:12:48] form of work that we can do it's us
[2:12:50] ceasing and God
[2:12:52] doing but we've got to be willing to do
[2:12:55] the work to build that Temple to find
[2:12:57] that rest and if we do if we're willing
[2:12:59] to brothers and sisters he'll give us
[2:13:00] that rest he'll actually come and abide
[2:13:03] with us we know the word says that he
[2:13:04] stands at the door knocking to see if he
[2:13:07] can come in and we know brother brandham
[2:13:08] said this is the only church he said
[2:13:10] through the Prophet this is the only
[2:13:11] church that ever he stood on the outside
[2:13:14] knocking to get
[2:13:16] in if we're willing to open the door and
[2:13:18] invite him in what does the word say He
[2:13:20] he'll come in and he'll Su with
[2:13:22] us that means that he will feed
[2:13:25] us he'll stay with us he'll encourage us
[2:13:29] maybe stand with me as we close
[2:13:31] today there is a place brothers and
[2:13:33] sisters where we can have that rest
[2:13:35] where we don't have to worry about
[2:13:37] anything in our lives come what may we
[2:13:40] know God's in
[2:13:42] control we just give him that
[2:13:44] opportunity amen
