Description:
Safe in your arms 



I come to You with the weight of all my stress
You pick me up and You let me catch my breath
Lord, You never condemn, never make a list of wrongs
In the light of Your goodness, all the fear I’ve known is gone

I’m safe in Your arms
Your arms of love
I’m safe in Your arms
Your arms of love
All of my heart, my hope, my trust is held
Safe in Your arms, Your arms of love
Safe in Your arms, Your arms of love

You were there when there was nothing left
A spark of hope where I saw emptiness
Somehow even in pieces, You restore me with your peace
In the driest of deserts, You’re the never ending stream

And the only shadow I see
Is the shadow of Your wings
The shadow of Your wings

And the only shelter I need
Is the shadow of Your wings
The shadow of Your wings

Oh oh
I’m safe in Your arms
Your arms of love
I’m safe in Your arms
Your arms of love
All of my heart, my hope, my trust is held
Safe in Your arms, Your arms of love
Safe in Your arms, Your arms of love
