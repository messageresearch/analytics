[1:05:15] remember to uplift Jim Miller before

[1:05:38] father we pray that you would just make
[1:05:40] covet go away

[1:05:47] father I just want to bring that request
[1:05:49] unto you Lord father meeting this way
[1:05:51] where it's all broken up and we're all

[1:05:58] together again in Your Name Lord Jesus

[1:06:03] and we could Rejoice knowing that we are
[1:06:06] the sons of God

[1:06:10] these requests tonight and that you

[1:06:21] a purpose so that your will could be
[1:06:23] accomplished in our lives Lord we're so
[1:06:26] thankful for that we know that our
[1:06:27] trials are are more precious than gold
[1:06:31] father we just want to thank you for the
[1:06:33] trials thank you for the valleys because
[1:06:35] it gives us the ability to look up Lord
[1:06:38] Jesus and see the mountaintops and to
[1:06:40] see you to have the right perspective
[1:06:43] Lord we just ask that you would meet all
[1:06:45] these needs in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:06:47] pray amen
[1:06:50] Hallelujah you have your Bibles tonight
[1:06:52] the Lord has given me a different
[1:06:54] direction
[1:06:55] pray that his will be done here thank
[1:06:59] you musicians once again
[1:07:01] Faithfully coming and offering your
[1:07:04] gifts
[1:07:05] if you could turn to Acts chapter 19.
[1:07:16] Acts chapter 19.
[1:07:22] I'd just like to read
[1:07:24] from verse 11.
[1:07:28] to verse 20.
[1:07:33] and God wrought specials wrought special
[1:07:37] Miracles by the hands of Paul so that
[1:07:39] from his body were brought unto the sick
[1:07:42] handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases
[1:07:46] departed from them
[1:07:48] and the evil spirits went out of them
[1:07:53] then certain of the Vagabond Jews
[1:07:56] Exorcist
[1:07:57] took upon them to call over them which
[1:08:01] had evil spirits in the name of the Lord
[1:08:03] Jesus
[1:08:05] saying
[1:08:06] we adjure You by Jesus whom Paul
[1:08:09] preacheth
[1:08:10] and there were seven sons of one Siva a
[1:08:13] Jew a chief of the priests which did so
[1:08:17] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:08:19] Jesus I know
[1:08:21] and Paul I know
[1:08:23] but who are ye
[1:08:26] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:08:29] leaped on them and overcame them and
[1:08:31] prevailed against them so that they fled
[1:08:34] out of that house naked and wounded
[1:08:37] and this was known to all the Jews and
[1:08:39] the Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and
[1:08:42] fear fell on them all
[1:08:44] and the name of the Lord Jesus was
[1:08:45] magnified
[1:08:47] and many that believed came and
[1:08:49] confessed and showed their deeds
[1:08:51] and many of them also which used curious
[1:08:54] Arts brought their books together and
[1:08:55] burned them before all men and they
[1:08:58] counted the price of them and found it
[1:08:59] fifty thousand pieces of silver
[1:09:02] so mightily grew the word of God
[1:09:06] and prevailed
[1:09:08] it's just bow
[1:09:11] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we pray that
[1:09:13] your word
[1:09:14] would just grow mightily and prevail
[1:09:18] lord it's our prayer that we would see
[1:09:21] you working mightily in me
[1:09:24] father it's one thing to look at other
[1:09:26] people and see the joy of the Lord it's
[1:09:30] one thing to look at other people and to
[1:09:32] see great miracles in their lives it's
[1:09:34] another thing to look at a prophet and
[1:09:36] to see you living out through him but oh
[1:09:39] Lord Jesus what about me father I pray
[1:09:42] that tonight this would become the
[1:09:43] prayer of your children that we would
[1:09:45] begin to call upon the name of the Lord
[1:09:47] and and not in a way that is a
[1:09:49] traditional way but maybe a little bit
[1:09:51] untraditional Lord Jesus that we could
[1:09:54] cry out to you that we could look to you
[1:09:57] for judgment that you would judge us now
[1:09:59] that we would judge ourselves Lord Jesus
[1:10:02] that we wouldn't come into the judgment
[1:10:05] father we pray that you would just bless
[1:10:06] the reading of your word that you would
[1:10:08] speak to us one more time softly Lord
[1:10:11] Jesus as we close the door as we enter
[1:10:14] into that chamber father that we would
[1:10:15] just have that invisible Union one more
[1:10:18] time that you would just have your way
[1:10:20] we just ask all these things lowered in
[1:10:23] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:10:26] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[1:10:29] we had a wonderful services on Sunday
[1:10:33] the morning service and then the
[1:10:35] communion service
[1:10:36] it was certainly amazing to just have
[1:10:38] people here
[1:10:40] to just be around people
[1:10:43] we had a little uh
[1:10:45] impromptu surprise birthday cake for
[1:10:48] brother Paul it was his 60th birthday
[1:10:51] just this last week and just to have all
[1:10:55] the people around and I apologize for
[1:10:57] those people if anybody was potentially
[1:11:00] offended that we wound up having a bunch
[1:11:02] of people gathered together outside that
[1:11:04] was not the intention but it's the way
[1:11:07] it happened and we certainly don't want
[1:11:09] to do anything outside of the laws of
[1:11:11] the land
[1:11:12] so if anybody is upset or offended
[1:11:15] please come and talk to me about it
[1:11:17] don't just bear it and be upset and
[1:11:20] offended
[1:11:22] um
[1:11:23] but we just wanted to wish brother Paul
[1:11:24] happy birthday with a few people so
[1:11:28] anyways um we certainly had some good
[1:11:30] services on Sunday we're thankful that
[1:11:32] we can at least hold a communion service
[1:11:35] looking forward to the days where we can
[1:11:37] have real service and a communion
[1:11:39] service and a foot Washing Service and a
[1:11:42] testimony service and just a real
[1:11:44] worship service where we hear the sons
[1:11:47] of God shouting for Joy once again all
[1:11:50] together
[1:11:52] um the question was raised are we
[1:11:54] planning on aiming for every third
[1:11:56] Sunday for uh communion service and yes
[1:11:59] indeed we are it looks like it falls
[1:12:01] perfectly in between the Left Bridge
[1:12:03] services
[1:12:05] so Lord willing will aim for every third
[1:12:07] Sunday to have a communion service so we
[1:12:10] can just have that on our calendars and
[1:12:12] know that's sort of the direction that
[1:12:14] we're going
[1:12:15] we have a new addition to the
[1:12:17] congregation
[1:12:18] yesterday
[1:12:21] brother Samuel and sister Faith have a
[1:12:23] new son called Benjamin igmana
[1:12:27] lest it be the name of the Lord
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:31] everyone is happy and healthy and the
[1:12:34] family has gone from two children to
[1:12:36] three
[1:12:37] the five-person family we can relate to
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:40] God bless you brother and sister you're
[1:12:43] in our prayers
[1:12:44] we'll be leaving on Tuesday May 25th
[1:12:47] that's next Tuesday and we'll be
[1:12:50] returning again Tuesday June the first
[1:12:54] but the Phil will take the service on
[1:12:56] Wednesday the 26th brother Mervin the
[1:12:59] Sunday service on the 30th and Lord
[1:13:01] willing will be back to take the service
[1:13:03] on Wednesday June 2nd
[1:13:06] so we'll just trust the Lord that we'll
[1:13:09] have a little time away some fellowship
[1:13:12] um I think True Fellowship according to
[1:13:14] the prophet there will be at least a
[1:13:16] couple of fellows in a boat and we'll be
[1:13:19] fishing it'll be amazing we'll have some
[1:13:21] some time travel time stand Stills when
[1:13:24] you're fishing so we're certainly look
[1:13:26] forward to that as well
[1:13:28] out of uh out of Acts chapter 19 our
[1:13:32] scripture tonight I remember when I
[1:13:35] first started coming to church and back
[1:13:37] in the upper room I'll never forget this
[1:13:39] uh here in brother Ken preach on this
[1:13:42] topic on this very uh this very thing
[1:13:47] but tonight I believe the Lord just
[1:13:49] spoke to me about this that that this is
[1:13:51] where we should go and uh I'm I I can't
[1:13:54] even remember if brother Ken went this
[1:13:56] way with it but I know he he talked
[1:13:58] about this and uh I can only imagine if
[1:14:01] we had that recording that it would be
[1:14:03] just exactly like we're going to talk
[1:14:05] about tonight in in understanding who
[1:14:07] you are we could just summarize it
[1:14:10] tonight these these certain Vagabond
[1:14:12] Jews these exorcists they took upon
[1:14:14] themselves to call over them which had
[1:14:18] evil spirits they saw what was happening
[1:14:21] by the True Vine
[1:14:23] they saw the life of Jesus Christ back
[1:14:26] upon his church again and while that was
[1:14:28] happening
[1:14:30] these fellows and remember they were
[1:14:32] actual priests
[1:14:35] they decided they were going to try and
[1:14:36] have a healing campaign as well
[1:14:39] you can only imagine that these were the
[1:14:41] ones that were probably murmuring
[1:14:45] a little bit about the campaign that was
[1:14:47] going on
[1:14:48] maybe those guys were having a little
[1:14:49] bit of a Ruckus down there and and they
[1:14:52] were murmuring about it you know the
[1:14:54] spirits don't die
[1:14:56] they don't die at all those Spirits came
[1:15:00] back upon those men we know it wasn't
[1:15:02] Jesus spirit because he would never do
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:06] and if it was Jesus Spirit those Spirits
[1:15:09] would have Departed
[1:15:11] they would have left
[1:15:14] because they would have been Paul's
[1:15:16] brother
[1:15:18] but those those Vagabond Jews those
[1:15:20] exorcists they took upon them to just
[1:15:22] try and act this way and you know they
[1:15:24] called these people over it's
[1:15:25] interesting when you look at the
[1:15:26] scripture they they called the people
[1:15:28] over that had the evil spirits
[1:15:31] it says then certain of the Vagabond
[1:15:33] Jews The Exorcist took upon them to call
[1:15:35] over them which had evil spirits the
[1:15:38] name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure
[1:15:42] you
[1:15:43] by Jesus whom Paul preacheth
[1:15:47] so they weren't even
[1:15:49] like they just didn't believe
[1:15:50] these were unbelievers
[1:15:52] they just wanted to create a show
[1:15:54] they were trying to get God to clown
[1:15:57] and they had no idea what they were up
[1:15:59] against but these men realized very
[1:16:02] quickly that they were dealing with real
[1:16:05] spirits
[1:16:06] and we know brothers and sisters that
[1:16:08] today we deal with real spirits they
[1:16:10] don't die
[1:16:11] but you know compared to them versus now
[1:16:15] then they knew in part and they
[1:16:18] prophesied in part
[1:16:20] but today
[1:16:21] that which is perfect has come
[1:16:25] we have the entire word at our disposal
[1:16:28] and you know I just believe this with
[1:16:31] all my heart and I'm just going to
[1:16:32] preach it this way tonight I'm just
[1:16:33] going to preach a little bit all Heaven
[1:16:35] is waiting to see what we're going to
[1:16:37] confess
[1:16:38] do we believe that we have the open word
[1:16:41] or do we not believe we have the open
[1:16:42] Word
[1:16:43] if we believe we have the open word when
[1:16:46] we actually confess the word is open
[1:16:50] then Heaven's listening
[1:16:53] all Heavens listening
[1:16:55] but you know I believe it goes a little
[1:16:56] bit further than that
[1:16:58] it's one thing to say that the word is
[1:17:00] all open
[1:17:01] and we can say it as a church the word
[1:17:03] is all open
[1:17:04] in the message of the hour the word is
[1:17:06] all open but what is that to you
[1:17:09] remember Jesus asked them
[1:17:11] what are people who do people say that I
[1:17:13] am
[1:17:14] but then after they gave their answers
[1:17:17] it was a generalized thing then he said
[1:17:19] who do you say that I am
[1:17:23] brothers and sisters tonight I believe
[1:17:24] that's where we are who do we say that
[1:17:26] he is
[1:17:28] is he a God that's just out there in
[1:17:30] some other dimension
[1:17:32] that one day we're just going to see him
[1:17:34] it's just going to happen
[1:17:36] or is he right here with us now because
[1:17:38] if he's right here with us now then we
[1:17:40] have authority
[1:17:42] there's so many parallels and types that
[1:17:44] comes out of this this scripture that we
[1:17:46] read tonight you know
[1:17:48] um we know and there were seven sons of
[1:17:50] Siva a Jew and a chief of the priests
[1:17:53] which did so and the evil spirit
[1:17:55] answered and said Jesus I know on Paul I
[1:17:57] know but who are ye
[1:17:59] who are ye and the man in whom the evil
[1:18:02] spirit was leapt on them and overcame
[1:18:05] them and prevailed against them so that
[1:18:07] they fled out of the house naked and
[1:18:08] wounded
[1:18:10] it can be real easy to look at this and
[1:18:13] think why
[1:18:14] there's an evil spirit
[1:18:16] and if I ever come in contact with the
[1:18:18] real evil spirit I better be careful
[1:18:20] because he could leap on me and cause me
[1:18:22] to leave the house wounded and naked and
[1:18:25] you know what brothers and sisters it's
[1:18:26] true
[1:18:27] if you do that on your own accord that's
[1:18:30] exactly what could happen or worse
[1:18:33] but what about when you have gone and
[1:18:36] you have met the requirements
[1:18:38] when you've heard the message of the
[1:18:40] hour and you've met the requirements
[1:18:43] and and you might not feel like you do
[1:18:46] but you can look back and say well I
[1:18:48] know that there was a time where it was
[1:18:50] just a boring Wednesday old night
[1:18:51] service and and I got the Revelation
[1:18:54] that I just need to be baptized in the
[1:18:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:18:57] there is an actual gift there's there's
[1:19:00] something in it for me
[1:19:01] if I'm baptized I'm entitled to the
[1:19:05] Token I get the Holy Ghost in my life
[1:19:07] and and when I get that holy ghost in my
[1:19:10] life then I have some Authority then
[1:19:12] there's some special gifts that actually
[1:19:14] come along with that
[1:19:16] when that happens brothers and sisters
[1:19:18] it changes things things are no longer
[1:19:20] the same then the word starts to open to
[1:19:22] us then we start to see Jesus Christ in
[1:19:26] every single scripture that we read we
[1:19:28] start to see that the seventh seal is
[1:19:30] open in every single scripture that we
[1:19:33] read we don't look at the scriptures and
[1:19:36] say oh it's only six it's only six seals
[1:19:39] that are open even though that's what
[1:19:40] the word says if you look at it
[1:19:43] if you listen to The Prophet The Prophet
[1:19:45] says only six seals
[1:19:47] in the seals
[1:19:49] but if you go just a little bit further
[1:19:51] even the splice past the splice in the
[1:19:54] seventh seal but if you get into Christ
[1:19:56] is the mystery of God reveal you get
[1:19:57] into some of the other messages later on
[1:19:59] he says it very clearly that all the
[1:20:01] seals are open every all of them
[1:20:04] every single one of them Satan doesn't
[1:20:06] want us to believe they are
[1:20:08] if he can get us to believe anything
[1:20:09] different than what the word says then
[1:20:11] what was delivered by the prophet in our
[1:20:13] day then he's got us beat
[1:20:15] and he will be as religious as can be
[1:20:17] he'll come polished up the church and
[1:20:20] he'll go toe-to-toe and and argue quotes
[1:20:22] and and be able to quote scripture and
[1:20:24] be able to do it all
[1:20:26] except for take all of the word
[1:20:29] that's the true test the ability to take
[1:20:31] all of the word
[1:20:33] I just want to encourage us tonight and
[1:20:36] and I could probably just summarize it
[1:20:38] right here is that brothers and sisters
[1:20:39] if we've got the token in our lives if
[1:20:42] we've met the requirements we might not
[1:20:44] feel like it and we never
[1:20:46] I don't think we'll ever really feel
[1:20:48] like it because when we actually truly
[1:20:51] get that revelation
[1:20:53] it doesn't puff us up
[1:20:56] we don't get puffed up
[1:20:58] we get humble
[1:21:00] because we really recognize that God did
[1:21:02] it all
[1:21:03] there's nothing I could put on myself in
[1:21:06] terms of clothing garments there's
[1:21:07] nothing that I could say there's nothing
[1:21:09] that I could do he did it all from
[1:21:11] before the foundation of the world we
[1:21:13] were in his mind before there was even a
[1:21:15] molecule is what the prophet said before
[1:21:17] there was even angels to worship him
[1:21:19] before there was a world before Adam and
[1:21:22] Eve before all the prophets before all
[1:21:24] the Old Testament Saints before all the
[1:21:26] New Testament all of it
[1:21:28] we were in him
[1:21:30] all the way through
[1:21:33] out of here recognize Act on Word
[1:21:38] 1960.
[1:21:40] I'm just going to read a little bit
[1:21:43] kind of pertains to this tonight
[1:21:45] we'll just see what the Lord will do
[1:21:48] he says as I would speak if I had time
[1:21:51] on the squirrels the other day
[1:21:53] about turn me around
[1:21:55] I never seen it before and and I
[1:21:58] couldn't do it
[1:22:00] Hattie
[1:22:02] sitting back there looking at me
[1:22:05] how could that ever happen
[1:22:07] how could it ever happen
[1:22:11] it couldn't have done it but it was
[1:22:13] inspired
[1:22:15] it was quickened
[1:22:17] the word was spoke
[1:22:20] and it was made so Hallelujah
[1:22:23] where was that word spoke
[1:22:27] there was a voice that spoke
[1:22:29] to the prophet
[1:22:31] but then the prophet actually spoke the
[1:22:33] word
[1:22:35] so brothers and sisters tonight I want
[1:22:37] to just say that
[1:22:39] there has to be a revelation that comes
[1:22:40] to you but when it comes to you
[1:22:43] speak it
[1:22:45] don't be afraid of it
[1:22:47] don't be afraid to speak the word
[1:22:50] it's Satan that wants us to be afraid to
[1:22:53] speak the word and you know the only
[1:22:55] thing that really holds back the defeat
[1:22:56] of Satan in our day brothers and sisters
[1:22:58] I just feel so inspired to speak this
[1:23:00] tonight is US speaking the word
[1:23:05] we don't have to understand it
[1:23:06] and we don't have to explain it
[1:23:08] and Satan's going to come around and say
[1:23:10] well I want you to explain that or how
[1:23:13] could you understand that I need to
[1:23:14] understand that a little more the doctor
[1:23:16] said this
[1:23:18] and you're going to tell me that I don't
[1:23:20] understand how those two dots connect
[1:23:21] you don't have to understand Satan wants
[1:23:24] you to understand
[1:23:26] God said just believe
[1:23:29] the prophet said only believe all things
[1:23:32] are possible brothers and sisters
[1:23:35] how could it ever have happened
[1:23:37] it couldn't have done it but it was
[1:23:39] inspired it was quickened
[1:23:43] the word was spoke and it was made so
[1:23:47] Hallelujah
[1:23:48] Paul could you imagine him saying I've
[1:23:50] been out on this sea 14 days and nights
[1:23:52] and no stars are moon nor the Sun or
[1:23:55] nothing guess I'll just go up and tell
[1:23:57] them be of good courage because God will
[1:23:58] take care of us anyhow
[1:24:00] he says oh God don't work like that God
[1:24:04] doesn't do that
[1:24:06] your faith is all right brother your
[1:24:09] faith is wonderful
[1:24:11] but until the thing is inspired
[1:24:16] I just love how the prophet takes this
[1:24:18] and he just lays it out and I'm saying
[1:24:20] it real slow I'm just trying to make it
[1:24:22] real clear I just want to really try and
[1:24:25] and and and and get this point tonight
[1:24:27] just hit on this real good tonight he
[1:24:30] says oh here's a red light hanging here
[1:24:33] and and if I see I say well I've got my
[1:24:36] foot on the accelerator I've got a car I
[1:24:38] can go through that light Yonder making
[1:24:40] 120 miles an hour that's true I can feel
[1:24:44] the power under my foot
[1:24:46] but you'd better wait till the go sign
[1:24:48] Hallelujah
[1:24:50] some of us here tonight we've got cars
[1:24:52] that have lots of power
[1:24:54] and and you can step on the accelerator
[1:24:57] and you can really feel the power go
[1:25:00] so you could probably relate to what the
[1:25:02] prophet is saying here
[1:25:04] says I can feel the power under my foot
[1:25:06] but you better wait till the go sign
[1:25:08] Hallelujah
[1:25:10] so we're just building this here
[1:25:11] brothers and sisters we're taking our
[1:25:14] time and just talking slowly we've got
[1:25:16] to be careful to make sure that what
[1:25:18] we're talking about is inspired
[1:25:20] he says do you get what I'm meaning when
[1:25:23] the go sign comes on all right
[1:25:26] when the things inspired to you and God
[1:25:29] makes it known like he did back there
[1:25:31] all right
[1:25:32] but until he does it we got a bunch of
[1:25:35] juditarians impersonating walking along
[1:25:38] like saying well I'm just the same as
[1:25:41] they are I'm a Christian too
[1:25:46] he goes on to say oh
[1:25:49] don't you remember the sons of Siva
[1:25:53] Siva went out and said we adjure you
[1:25:57] ajure you in the name of Jesus who Paul
[1:25:59] preaches come out
[1:26:01] he said Paul I know and Jesus I know but
[1:26:03] who are you
[1:26:05] who are you
[1:26:07] brother Branham says the hour is coming
[1:26:09] when right and Wrongs made manifest it
[1:26:13] shows in the Christian today it shows in
[1:26:16] the churches today it shows and the
[1:26:18] people today I'm holding you along I
[1:26:20] want
[1:26:22] I want this to get to you
[1:26:25] Paul never said
[1:26:26] I believe I'll just go and say well be
[1:26:29] of a good courage no what did he do
[1:26:34] remember when he was on the ship
[1:26:37] maybe we should be reading that tonight
[1:26:38] but I just didn't feel inspired to it
[1:26:40] just came out on the quote but remember
[1:26:42] when he was on the ship what did he do
[1:26:45] brother Bradham says he heard an angel
[1:26:51] I'm just going to pause there for a
[1:26:52] second
[1:26:53] Paul heard an angel
[1:26:57] he know that was the same angel that
[1:27:00] always spoke to him
[1:27:02] he recognized it
[1:27:06] so now
[1:27:07] I'm gonna just change gears a little bit
[1:27:10] I'm going to step on the accelerator and
[1:27:12] I'm going to drop the clutch
[1:27:15] let's just flip over in our minds to
[1:27:17] Revelations 10. let's just turn there
[1:27:19] for a second Revelations 10 verse 1.
[1:27:25] Revelations 10 verse 1 very familiar
[1:27:27] scripture the Hallmark of the message
[1:27:30] believer today
[1:27:32] Revelations 10.
[1:27:34] verse 1.
[1:27:37] and I saw another Mighty angel
[1:27:40] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:27:42] cloud and a rainbow was in his was upon
[1:27:45] his head and his face was as it were the
[1:27:47] Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and
[1:27:50] he had in his hand a little book open
[1:27:52] and he set his right foot upon the seat
[1:27:54] his left foot upon the Earth and cried
[1:27:56] with a loud voice as when a lion roarth
[1:27:58] and when he had cried seven Thunders had
[1:28:00] uttered their voices when the seven
[1:28:02] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[1:28:04] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[1:28:06] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:28:08] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[1:28:10] and right them not
[1:28:12] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:28:15] sea
[1:28:16] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[1:28:19] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[1:28:21] forever and ever who created heaven the
[1:28:23] things therein are and the earth and the
[1:28:25] things that there and are and the Sea
[1:28:27] and the things which are therein that
[1:28:29] there should be time no longer
[1:28:32] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:28:35] seventh what
[1:28:38] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:28:41] of God should be finished as he hath
[1:28:42] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:28:46] now maybe I'm stretching this a little
[1:28:48] bit but let's just go back and hear this
[1:28:50] Paul never said I believe I'll just go
[1:28:52] up and say well be of a good courage no
[1:28:55] what did he do he heard an angel
[1:28:59] brothers and sisters have you heard an
[1:29:02] angel
[1:29:05] if we've heard an angel
[1:29:08] do we not have the authority to stand
[1:29:10] upon the word for our day
[1:29:14] we don't have to give Satan any ground
[1:29:18] he is an absolute Thief a liar and a
[1:29:22] squatter and he has no Authority
[1:29:25] even though he'll present us with
[1:29:28] symptoms in our lives or circumstances
[1:29:30] it's irrelevant he has no Authority and
[1:29:34] we need to continue to confess that
[1:29:37] he's a liar and he has no Authority
[1:29:39] there's no ground for him to stand on
[1:29:41] there's no grounds for him to stand on
[1:29:43] as an accuser of the Brethren he can go
[1:29:45] and stand in front of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:47] Christ day and night but that lamb has
[1:29:50] already gone and taken the book
[1:29:53] he's already taken the book out of the
[1:29:54] hand of him that sat on the throne it's
[1:29:57] over
[1:29:58] Satan has no grounds to stand upon he
[1:30:00] can try and accuse us all he wants to
[1:30:05] Paul never said I believe I'll just go
[1:30:07] up and say well be of a good courage no
[1:30:09] what did he do he heard an angel and
[1:30:12] what did that angel say
[1:30:14] I bet you that angel said
[1:30:16] you know what Paul
[1:30:19] you recognize my voice if you recognize
[1:30:22] my voice I want you to hear this I want
[1:30:24] you to hear that you have thus saith the
[1:30:27] Lord
[1:30:30] and what you say is the same thing as me
[1:30:33] saying it
[1:30:35] and when you say it under that Authority
[1:30:38] the authority of the angel that was
[1:30:41] leading him when you speak it under that
[1:30:43] Authority all Heaven has to back up your
[1:30:46] your word
[1:30:48] not my word your word
[1:30:54] I bet that angel told him you know what
[1:30:56] Paul
[1:30:57] you follow me the way that I've
[1:30:59] instructed you then you have thus saith
[1:31:02] the Lord and the mind of Christ to know
[1:31:05] what to do with that word
[1:31:07] you'll never ask amiss
[1:31:10] but look at this situation here
[1:31:13] if if you compare that quote out of pick
[1:31:16] your propane and write
[1:31:22] in our scripture that we read earlier
[1:31:23] over in Acts 19. there were some people
[1:31:26] that never had thus saith the Lord the
[1:31:29] seven sons of Siva
[1:31:31] and they should have kept still
[1:31:33] because it wasn't made known to them
[1:31:35] personally
[1:31:36] they didn't recognize that Angel's voice
[1:31:39] but here in this quote he says Paul
[1:31:42] never said I believe I'll just go up and
[1:31:43] say well be of a good courage no what
[1:31:45] did he do he heard an angel he knowed
[1:31:47] that was the same angel that always
[1:31:50] spoke to him he recognized it brothers
[1:31:54] and sisters we're not going to hear
[1:31:56] William Miriam Branham come to us maybe
[1:31:59] we would see him in a dream or a vision
[1:32:01] or something like that but we know what
[1:32:03] what he even said about it that that's
[1:32:07] what we will hear though
[1:32:10] and what we will recognize is that that
[1:32:13] angel spoke the same word that Paul
[1:32:15] spoke
[1:32:16] the same word that's in the word
[1:32:19] it's the same thing
[1:32:21] it won't be a different word
[1:32:24] so we have the ability to know that it's
[1:32:26] the same thing that it's the Lord Jesus
[1:32:29] Christ speaking to us it's what Paul
[1:32:31] preached is what brother Branham
[1:32:33] preached when we hear Brother Branham as
[1:32:35] an angel speaking to us
[1:32:37] we begin to actually recognize it just
[1:32:40] like Paul said I recognize Brother Brad
[1:32:42] I'm saying I recognize that voice when
[1:32:45] you turn on a tape and you hear good
[1:32:47] evening friends
[1:32:49] is that brother Brad I'm speaking to you
[1:32:52] or is that the angel of the Lord
[1:32:53] speaking to you
[1:32:55] I believe once those seals are
[1:32:57] completely open it's not Brother Brad
[1:32:58] I'm speaking to you it's the Lord Jesus
[1:33:00] Christ speaking to you saying good
[1:33:02] evening friend do you know who's here
[1:33:05] it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's that one
[1:33:07] that descended from heaven with the
[1:33:09] Shout with the rainbow around his head
[1:33:10] and put one foot on the land and one
[1:33:12] foot on the sea and declared that there
[1:33:14] will be time no more because it's
[1:33:15] finished that book of redemption is now
[1:33:18] back on Earth in the hands of man again
[1:33:23] Revelations 10 1-7 that angel that that
[1:33:26] voice that he heard he always recognized
[1:33:28] it he recognized it because he was the
[1:33:31] one that spoke to him all the time
[1:33:33] it's no different for us brothers and
[1:33:34] sisters
[1:33:36] I believe that we have authority and I
[1:33:38] know that we all have heard it uh
[1:33:41] probably till the cows come home but I
[1:33:43] just want to try and encourage us don't
[1:33:45] look for something else we have it all
[1:33:48] in our hands right now it's not going to
[1:33:51] get any better than this maybe we'll be
[1:33:53] able to gather together maybe we'll have
[1:33:54] be able to have a few more people or
[1:33:57] maybe some better instruments but the
[1:33:58] word isn't going to get any better we
[1:34:00] have the perfect word it's completely
[1:34:03] open and we can see our names inside and
[1:34:06] outside
[1:34:08] of the word
[1:34:10] brother Branham says then he acted Paul
[1:34:12] acted he went up and said be of a good
[1:34:14] courage for the angel of the Lord whose
[1:34:17] servant I am stood by me last night
[1:34:19] showing me a vision that there will be
[1:34:21] nothing lost on this ship be of a good
[1:34:23] courage go eat your dinner now
[1:34:25] everything's all right amen
[1:34:27] when it's inspired to you when God makes
[1:34:30] it right
[1:34:33] so looking at the scripture tonight
[1:34:34] brothers and sisters to look at this
[1:34:36] evil spirit and think about our lives
[1:34:39] and all the different circumstances and
[1:34:40] situations that we encounter in our
[1:34:42] lives to think that we we have the
[1:34:45] authority in our lives but Satan will
[1:34:48] come around and and he'll say the same
[1:34:50] thing that he said to the seven sons of
[1:34:52] Siva brother Branham I know and and and
[1:34:55] Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are
[1:34:57] you and don't think for a second that he
[1:35:00] won't say the exact same thing to you
[1:35:02] and I
[1:35:03] because he will
[1:35:05] but remember the prophet for our day
[1:35:07] said she has thus saith the Lord and the
[1:35:11] mind of Christ to know what to do with
[1:35:13] that
[1:35:16] and she has thus saith the Lord if she
[1:35:18] keeps still
[1:35:20] so where are you
[1:35:22] tonight I want to ask that question are
[1:35:24] you just going to keep still
[1:35:26] brothers and sisters don't keep still
[1:35:28] speak the word
[1:35:31] speak the word with authority
[1:35:33] who are we tonight
[1:35:36] Paul I know brother Bradham I know but
[1:35:38] who are you
[1:35:41] so maybe I would just title that tonight
[1:35:43] this little message who are you
[1:35:49] so tonight I just want to say this
[1:35:52] maybe as a bit of a rhetorical question
[1:35:54] Satan asking me asking you who are you
[1:35:59] to think that you have authority to cast
[1:36:02] out someone to to come and stand
[1:36:04] toe-to-toe with me when when I was
[1:36:07] created co-equal with God except for the
[1:36:09] ability to create
[1:36:12] nobody has the ability to match wits
[1:36:15] I know all about history I know all
[1:36:17] about everything about everything
[1:36:20] how dare you come and stand toe-to-toe
[1:36:23] with Satan and try and have any
[1:36:24] Authority
[1:36:25] that's what he's gonna do
[1:36:27] he's going to resist it with all of his
[1:36:30] might brothers and sisters
[1:36:31] and you know the only ones on Earth
[1:36:33] right now that have authority to stand
[1:36:35] up to Satan are the sons of God
[1:36:38] the Sons and Daughters of God they're
[1:36:41] the only ones nobody else has the
[1:36:43] ability to stand up to Satan
[1:36:47] so you know I would say this well Satan
[1:36:50] and I just want to encourage us any time
[1:36:52] we encounter these situations in our
[1:36:55] lives and and it feels like we have a
[1:36:57] little bit of Courage coming up to us we
[1:36:59] remember that voice that angel that's
[1:37:01] saying Speak the word
[1:37:05] and then you'll hear a louder voice
[1:37:07] saying oh look at those people over
[1:37:09] there they're going to look at you and
[1:37:10] think you're crazy if you're going to
[1:37:11] speak the word something weird is going
[1:37:13] to happen I wouldn't do it if I were you
[1:37:17] because Paul I know and brother Branham
[1:37:18] I knew they were both prophets they were
[1:37:20] both Mighty Men of God but who are you
[1:37:23] who are you you pity little human well
[1:37:26] I'll tell you who I am Satan I want to
[1:37:28] tell you I believe that I'll just step
[1:37:30] back and I'll tell you exactly who I am
[1:37:32] not according to me but according to
[1:37:34] what my father says about me
[1:37:38] remember Satan back in Job 1 there was a
[1:37:41] day when the sons of God came to present
[1:37:43] themselves before the Lord
[1:37:46] remember that
[1:37:47] he remembers that brothers and sisters I
[1:37:50] think I'm out of batteries bear with me
[1:37:52] for a second this is just about to get
[1:37:54] fun
[1:37:59] I'm sorry I should have done this before
[1:38:03] much brother
[1:38:08] I'll be good now
[1:38:11] okay now Hallelujah
[1:38:14] Satan remember in job one there was a
[1:38:17] day when the sons of God came to present
[1:38:19] themselves before the Lord and and you
[1:38:21] came also among them remember that
[1:38:25] and the Lord said unto you once cometh
[1:38:27] thou and you answered that I just I just
[1:38:29] came from going to and fro in the earth
[1:38:31] walking up and down in it
[1:38:33] he remembers that
[1:38:34] that was a very specific time this
[1:38:36] wasn't something made up or a vision
[1:38:38] there was a very specific account
[1:38:41] and Satan remembers it and and I think
[1:38:43] it's good to just go back and remind him
[1:38:45] of that
[1:38:46] show him that there's an identification
[1:38:48] in the word
[1:38:51] job 2 remember this Satan
[1:38:54] again there was a day where the sons of
[1:38:56] God came to present themselves before
[1:38:58] the Lord and you came also to present
[1:39:01] yourself with them remember that
[1:39:05] that's why brothers and sisters it's
[1:39:07] important it's the word it's scriptural
[1:39:10] there's a day where the sons of God
[1:39:12] present themselves before the Lord
[1:39:15] we don't stay at home
[1:39:18] if we've got the opportunity to
[1:39:21] the prophet said that every time the
[1:39:23] doors are open right
[1:39:26] but Satan he doesn't want us to remember
[1:39:28] this he doesn't want us to speak this
[1:39:30] word this way he wants us to keep quiet
[1:39:32] he wants us to just be still because
[1:39:34] maybe we just don't have the saith the
[1:39:36] Lord remember if you've met the
[1:39:37] requirements according to the prophet of
[1:39:39] Malachi 4 you have all of the authority
[1:39:42] you're a son of God
[1:39:45] that's all you have to realize is that
[1:39:47] you're a son or a daughter of God and
[1:39:49] and all authority in heaven is given
[1:39:51] unto you when you speak he speaks
[1:39:54] in job 2 remember Satan there was a day
[1:39:56] where the sons of God presented himself
[1:39:58] and you remember it you remember it well
[1:40:01] Job 38
[1:40:04] whereupon the foundations thereof
[1:40:07] fastened
[1:40:08] or who laid the Cornerstone whereof
[1:40:10] thereof
[1:40:12] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:40:15] the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:40:18] I just can't help but imagine Satan
[1:40:21] remembers that vividly
[1:40:23] he understands this language he knows it
[1:40:26] better than most theologians do
[1:40:29] but brothers and sisters think about
[1:40:31] that when the morning star sang together
[1:40:33] when all of the Heavenly hosts all of
[1:40:36] the Angels sang together
[1:40:39] and and you and I shouted for Joy we're
[1:40:42] not talking about some time that's
[1:40:45] that's going to be in the future we're
[1:40:46] talking about eternity here there's no
[1:40:48] time here
[1:40:49] this this is a a space this is a place
[1:40:52] where Satan remembers vividly we just
[1:40:55] have a little spiritual Amnesia because
[1:40:57] we just bypassed our theophany and we
[1:40:59] just came here through through through
[1:41:01] natural birth through the natural cause
[1:41:03] but you know when that when that sea
[1:41:05] Gene of God has that blood token applied
[1:41:07] it's it's not a literal blood but it's a
[1:41:09] spiritual blood when that blood is
[1:41:11] applied then we have the token in our
[1:41:13] lives and full obedience to the word
[1:41:16] entitles us to the what to the Token in
[1:41:20] our lives and when we have the token in
[1:41:21] our lives then we begin to see this the
[1:41:24] spiritual Amnesia that we've been given
[1:41:26] by bypassing our theophany it begins to
[1:41:29] fade and every once in a while we just
[1:41:30] get a glimpse of remembering what it was
[1:41:32] like to shout for joy
[1:41:36] where the sons of God sang together
[1:41:40] take them to to John one
[1:41:43] and just read some of this that we've
[1:41:45] been reading right remember John 1 the
[1:41:47] first first first book of John
[1:41:50] the first chapter of John that was the
[1:41:52] True Light
[1:41:53] which lighteth every man that cometh
[1:41:55] into the world life the ability to have
[1:41:58] breath in our nostrils that that life
[1:42:00] that God gave adam when he formed him
[1:42:02] out of the Dust of the earth that was
[1:42:04] the True Light which lighteth every man
[1:42:06] that cometh into the world he was in the
[1:42:08] world and the world was made by him and
[1:42:10] the world knew him not
[1:42:12] the world doesn't recognize us because
[1:42:15] he's in the world today but the world
[1:42:17] knows him not
[1:42:19] but the Sons and Daughters of God that's
[1:42:21] a different story brothers and sisters
[1:42:23] and I'll tell you what Satan he knows it
[1:42:26] too
[1:42:27] and every time we talk like this I
[1:42:29] believe his knees knocked together his
[1:42:31] Devils don't know what to do when we
[1:42:32] start to talk like this because they
[1:42:34] have no Authority and the more we speak
[1:42:36] this way the more we will come to the
[1:42:38] recognition that we don't have to
[1:42:40] tolerate Satan and his antics
[1:42:44] he came unto his own in his own received
[1:42:46] him not but as many as received him have
[1:42:49] you received him tonight as many as
[1:42:51] received him to them gave he power to
[1:42:54] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:42:57] believe on his name Glory
[1:43:01] what a tremendous thing it is to believe
[1:43:03] on his name tonight
[1:43:06] those which were born not of blood nor
[1:43:10] of the will of the flesh
[1:43:11] not talking about natural birth here
[1:43:13] we're talking about bypassing our
[1:43:15] theophanes and coming from him from
[1:43:18] before the foundation of the world those
[1:43:21] which were born not of blood not of the
[1:43:22] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:43:24] but of God
[1:43:26] Born Again Sons and Daughters of God
[1:43:28] those that have had the new birth
[1:43:31] they recognize who they are
[1:43:34] and brothers and sisters just like then
[1:43:36] so it is today and the Word was made
[1:43:39] flesh I would say and the word is made
[1:43:42] flesh and dwelling among us and we
[1:43:45] behold his glory the Glorious of only
[1:43:50] the begotten of the father I'm sorry I
[1:43:53] just get carried away with this because
[1:43:54] I love talking like this to Satan so he
[1:43:57] can hear my voice
[1:44:00] I want him to know where I stand
[1:44:02] brothers and sisters
[1:44:03] I want them to know
[1:44:05] that I'm recognizing my position I want
[1:44:08] Satan and all of his cronies to hear it
[1:44:11] loud and clear I don't have to tolerate
[1:44:13] his garbage in my life and neither do
[1:44:15] you
[1:44:17] remind him Romans chapter 8 verse 11 but
[1:44:21] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:44:22] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[1:44:25] that raised up Jesus from the dead shall
[1:44:27] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:44:30] spirit
[1:44:31] that dwelleth where
[1:44:34] in you
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:37] therefore brethren we are not debtors we
[1:44:41] are debtors I mean not to the flesh to
[1:44:43] live after the flesh we don't have to
[1:44:45] say that we're captive to the Flesh and
[1:44:47] we have to accept everything the way it
[1:44:48] is and it's just the way it is and
[1:44:50] that's all it is Satan's going to do his
[1:44:52] thing we live in Satan's Eden so it has
[1:44:54] to be that way no no I believe there's
[1:44:56] been generations of people that have
[1:44:58] been that way generations of people that
[1:45:00] have said unless you have thus saith the
[1:45:02] Lord you just keep still
[1:45:03] I don't want to act I don't want to get
[1:45:05] crazy I don't want to dance in the
[1:45:07] spirit I don't want to shout if if I
[1:45:11] feel inspired to just do something wild
[1:45:13] like maybe speak in tongues people might
[1:45:15] look down on me brothers and sisters the
[1:45:18] spirit of God where the spirit of God is
[1:45:19] there's liberty that's what the word
[1:45:22] says
[1:45:23] brother Branham says people in the world
[1:45:25] will get right into whatever it is
[1:45:28] they're into they'll go to a hockey game
[1:45:30] and when someone scores they'll jump up
[1:45:31] and scream yeah
[1:45:34] oh isn't it good isn't it good brothers
[1:45:36] and sisters we don't want to sit around
[1:45:38] like we're a bunch of dried up sticks we
[1:45:40] want to say that we're Sons and
[1:45:42] Daughters of the most high god with full
[1:45:44] Authority and power we know why we're
[1:45:47] here
[1:45:49] therefore brethren we are not debtors
[1:45:51] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:45:53] for if you live after the flesh ye shall
[1:45:55] die we don't live after the flesh but if
[1:45:57] ye through the spirit do mortify the
[1:45:59] Deeds of the body ye shall live not just
[1:46:01] live in this world not just have breath
[1:46:03] in your lungs but have eternal life
[1:46:06] not Eternal separation from God
[1:46:12] but this is where it gets good this is
[1:46:13] where the rubber meets the road Mr Satan
[1:46:16] when you want to ask me who are ye I'll
[1:46:18] tell you
[1:46:20] I'll tell you for as many as are led by
[1:46:23] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:46:25] God
[1:46:26] and you know what I hang out with a
[1:46:29] bunch of people that are led by the
[1:46:30] spirit of God I don't hang out with
[1:46:33] people that are debtors to the flesh
[1:46:35] that are afraid to speak the word that
[1:46:38] aren't interested in actually standing
[1:46:39] up and having full Authority and power
[1:46:41] understanding that all Heaven is just
[1:46:44] waiting just just waiting for Sons and
[1:46:47] Daughters of God to speak the word so
[1:46:49] they can come and back it up
[1:46:51] brother Branham said that he wants to
[1:46:53] bless us a thousand times more than
[1:46:55] we're willing
[1:46:58] how far below our privilege do we live
[1:47:00] brothers and sisters if we've got the
[1:47:02] seventh Angels message if we've truly
[1:47:04] received the message of Malachi 4 then
[1:47:08] what do we have to fear what do we have
[1:47:12] to just accept and tolerate
[1:47:15] you know what did David accept and
[1:47:18] tolerate
[1:47:19] he said you know I can't believe that
[1:47:22] everyone has this this lack of
[1:47:23] Revelation here that we are the chosen
[1:47:27] we have followed the word of the lord we
[1:47:30] are in our inheritance we are in the
[1:47:33] promised land the word says that when
[1:47:35] we're here that nothing can actually
[1:47:37] stand before us
[1:47:39] but we're afraid of this giant what's
[1:47:41] going on it's hysteria everyone is
[1:47:43] saying they're afraid of it so
[1:47:44] everyone's becoming afraid of it
[1:47:46] but you know the spirit of God it only
[1:47:48] takes one man is what brother Bradham
[1:47:49] said just let the spirit of God hit one
[1:47:51] man and watch out that's where the
[1:47:52] revival can happen and you know brothers
[1:47:55] and sisters I just want to encourage one
[1:47:56] person tonight
[1:47:58] to get that revival going in your life
[1:48:00] don't allow Satan to come around and
[1:48:02] make you feel like you don't have it
[1:48:04] feelings have nothing to do with it
[1:48:06] speak the word
[1:48:08] speak the word Empower God to move in
[1:48:12] your life not a self-help thing brothers
[1:48:14] and sisters this is the original life
[1:48:18] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:48:20] God they are the sons of God if you're
[1:48:22] led by the spirit of God brothers and
[1:48:23] sisters you might get into your life and
[1:48:25] you might have situations where things
[1:48:27] become Troublesome Things become weary
[1:48:31] in your life you might become confused
[1:48:33] but remember
[1:48:35] when you start to feel a certain way
[1:48:37] there's always something that comes back
[1:48:40] remember you hear that voice you hear
[1:48:43] that Angel's voice it comes back to you
[1:48:44] and and and you just hear it say
[1:48:46] something it just Rings true and maybe
[1:48:48] you'll just say maybe I just need to
[1:48:49] listen to the word maybe I just need to
[1:48:51] push push play on a message and just
[1:48:53] something happens you know what that is
[1:48:55] that's the spirit of God leading you
[1:48:57] brothers and sisters remember when that
[1:48:59] happens that happens because you are a
[1:49:02] son and a daughter of God if you didn't
[1:49:05] have his spirit in you you wouldn't care
[1:49:08] don't worry about your feelings just
[1:49:10] remember recognize those little cues
[1:49:12] when you have that desire in your heart
[1:49:14] it's it's the Lord Jesus Christ knocking
[1:49:16] saying hey hey buddy don't forget about
[1:49:18] me don't don't worry about all the stuff
[1:49:20] going on in your life just look to me
[1:49:22] just look at me and and everything will
[1:49:24] work out for ye have not received
[1:49:26] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:49:28] fear brothers and sisters if you've
[1:49:30] received the message of the hour if
[1:49:31] you've got the token in your life you
[1:49:33] haven't received the spirit of bondage
[1:49:35] again to fear we're not going back to
[1:49:38] fear
[1:49:41] if we go backwards to fear then we're
[1:49:43] actually going backwards in the message
[1:49:44] we're going back decades in the message
[1:49:47] is that what we're doing we don't want
[1:49:49] to do that let's go forwards
[1:49:51] let's call out kovid
[1:49:54] let's call out diseases
[1:49:56] let's see the Lord move in our lives
[1:49:58] don't be afraid to speak the word
[1:50:00] be afraid not to
[1:50:04] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:50:06] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:50:07] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:50:10] we cry Abba Father
[1:50:13] because we know who we are
[1:50:16] we know that we're children Sons and
[1:50:18] Daughters of the most high God Satan
[1:50:21] hates hearing this brothers and sisters
[1:50:23] he hates it because he wishes he was a
[1:50:26] son
[1:50:28] because his son receives the full
[1:50:30] inheritance of the father
[1:50:34] why do they receive it
[1:50:36] why does the son receive it
[1:50:38] just because
[1:50:41] they're a part of the father
[1:50:45] it's really hit me so hard recently
[1:50:47] how important it is to just tell our
[1:50:49] children that we're proud of them why
[1:50:52] because there are children
[1:50:54] not because they accomplish stuff
[1:50:56] sure it's nice and it makes us proud
[1:50:59] when we see our children Excel and do
[1:51:01] well
[1:51:01] but don't let that be the Hallmark of
[1:51:04] why you're proud of them brothers and
[1:51:05] sisters let them know that you're proud
[1:51:08] of them because
[1:51:09] they're yours
[1:51:11] your pride and joy
[1:51:14] imagine that if it was that way with God
[1:51:16] then that would mean there would have to
[1:51:18] be something that we could do in order
[1:51:20] for him to be proud of us
[1:51:22] what could we ever do to to measure up
[1:51:25] to God
[1:51:27] there's nothing
[1:51:29] it's only because we recognize who we
[1:51:31] are brothers and sisters that's the only
[1:51:33] thing because it's Spirit Bears witness
[1:51:36] with our spirit that we are sons of God
[1:51:38] oh my and if we're children then we're
[1:51:40] heirs and heirs with God and and Joint
[1:51:43] heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:51:46] suffered with him that we may be also
[1:51:48] glorified together I just love how he
[1:51:51] says this for I reckon the sufferings of
[1:51:52] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:51:54] compared to the glory which shall be
[1:51:57] revealed in who
[1:51:59] think about David when he was running
[1:52:01] down screaming this out probably to all
[1:52:04] the people around him who cares what
[1:52:07] everyone else thinks look at the glory
[1:52:08] that's going to be revealed in US
[1:52:11] let's take these little five rocks of
[1:52:13] faith and go and slay this giant in the
[1:52:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ The Mighty
[1:52:18] Jehovah the one that delivered us into
[1:52:20] the land
[1:52:21] I reckon the sufferings of this present
[1:52:23] time are not worthy to be compared with
[1:52:25] the glory that shall be revealed in US
[1:52:27] brothers and sisters what I would say is
[1:52:29] when we have a trial in our life run to
[1:52:32] it don't run from it run to it Satan
[1:52:35] wants us to run from it he wants to put
[1:52:38] us on the run but when we stop and we
[1:52:40] turn around and say uh
[1:52:42] you're a bluff you have no Authority you
[1:52:45] have no power and you know as far as I
[1:52:47] can tell the prophet of Malachi 4 said
[1:52:51] that I have it
[1:52:52] and I accept it in the name of the Lord
[1:52:55] Jesus Christ and that means that you are
[1:52:57] now powerless before me
[1:52:59] because that's what the prophet said
[1:53:01] what happened he prophesied that and
[1:53:03] nothing can stop a prophecy from a
[1:53:06] prophet of God hallelujah
[1:53:10] someone has to be the one who is going
[1:53:13] to have that Glory revealed in them
[1:53:20] Romans chapter 8 verse 19 for the
[1:53:22] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:53:26] it waiteth
[1:53:28] for the manifestation of what
[1:53:31] the sons of God
[1:53:34] brothers and sisters if we have the
[1:53:36] ability to receive the word for our day
[1:53:38] that's our identification that we are
[1:53:40] the sons of God
[1:53:43] and it doesn't matter what we feel
[1:53:46] Satan says who are ye
[1:53:48] I'll tell you who I am
[1:53:51] I'm a son of the most high God
[1:53:53] and there ain't nothing you can do to
[1:53:55] change that
[1:53:56] you you can even try try to take my life
[1:54:01] but you can never take my life because I
[1:54:03] am a part of him
[1:54:05] and I was in him before the foundation
[1:54:07] of the world before you were even
[1:54:08] created Satan
[1:54:11] I was in him
[1:54:13] you can't kill me because you can't kill
[1:54:15] him
[1:54:18] Philippians 2
[1:54:20] satan wherefore my beloved as ye have
[1:54:24] always obeyed not in my PR as in my
[1:54:26] presence only but now much more in my
[1:54:28] absence we work out you said Paul's
[1:54:31] saying here to the Philippians work out
[1:54:33] your own salvation with fear and
[1:54:34] trembling
[1:54:36] for it is God which worketh in you both
[1:54:39] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:54:43] do all things without murmurings and
[1:54:45] disputings that ye may be blameless
[1:54:48] and harmless
[1:54:49] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[1:54:52] midst of a crooked and perverse Nation
[1:54:54] among whom ye shine as lights in the
[1:54:57] world
[1:55:00] don't want to be disputing and murmuring
[1:55:02] brothers and sisters
[1:55:04] again that's just playing into Satan's
[1:55:07] trap Satan's Eden he wants us to be
[1:55:10] disputing he wants us to be murmuring he
[1:55:11] wants us to be in that situation but
[1:55:13] when we start to recognize who we are
[1:55:15] and and we can see that we're not doing
[1:55:17] that we're able to to present ourselves
[1:55:20] blameless and harmless because we come
[1:55:23] according to the word we know who's in
[1:55:26] control we don't have to get upset what
[1:55:28] is there to get upset about what is
[1:55:30] there to worry about either God
[1:55:33] is in control
[1:55:34] or he's not and you know brothers and
[1:55:37] sisters when we start getting upset and
[1:55:38] making fusses and start murmuring and
[1:55:40] complaining about whatever it is we're
[1:55:42] doing that about you know what happens
[1:55:43] is we start to actually take away the
[1:55:46] credibility of God being God what we're
[1:55:48] doing is giving credibility to Satan and
[1:55:51] we're taking away from being Sons and
[1:55:53] Daughters of God the power of the most
[1:55:56] high in our lives and we're just handing
[1:55:57] it over to Satan we're saying that's
[1:55:59] okay I'd rather just complain and murmur
[1:56:01] go ahead you know have my power and
[1:56:03] authority
[1:56:04] but when we say no I don't like what's
[1:56:06] happening but hey you know what the Lord
[1:56:08] he's got it all under control and I know
[1:56:10] that he's brought us this far and he'll
[1:56:12] continue to take us all the way through
[1:56:14] I know whom I have believed and that he
[1:56:17] is able
[1:56:19] to deliver me he's able to give me he's
[1:56:23] able to bring me he's able to show me
[1:56:25] whatever it is I need he's able to
[1:56:28] because he's God
[1:56:32] do all things without murmurings and
[1:56:34] disputings that ye may be blameless and
[1:56:36] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[1:56:38] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:56:40] Nation
[1:56:42] among whom ye shine as lights in this
[1:56:44] world
[1:56:46] as Sons and Daughters of God when we
[1:56:48] just live our lives it's just what we do
[1:56:52] we see a situation come along
[1:56:54] and we want to get upset by it we want
[1:56:56] to get flustered by it
[1:56:58] maybe we want to have a temper
[1:57:01] maybe we want to say things or do things
[1:57:03] but the word says to take every thought
[1:57:05] into captivity
[1:57:09] filter it
[1:57:11] see whose voice we're going to give
[1:57:13] credit to who who are we going to give
[1:57:16] power to in our lives because we're
[1:57:18] going to give power to one or the other
[1:57:19] it's either God or it's Satan there's no
[1:57:22] in betweens
[1:57:23] there's no gray area
[1:57:26] it's one of the other
[1:57:29] I just like verse 16 here of this this
[1:57:31] chapter in Philippians holding forth the
[1:57:33] word of life
[1:57:34] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:57:37] that I have not run in vain neither
[1:57:40] labored in vain
[1:57:43] to think this is Paul talking about this
[1:57:45] trying to encourage the children of God
[1:57:47] that you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:57:50] so take that Word of Promise and run
[1:57:54] with it
[1:57:56] don't don't neglect
[1:57:58] the great salvation that was given to
[1:58:00] you don't don't neglect all of this
[1:58:02] ability to understand that you're you're
[1:58:04] a light shining in this evil World in
[1:58:06] this dark world that you have the
[1:58:08] ability to be a son and a daughter of
[1:58:11] God without rebuke
[1:58:13] blameless in this world
[1:58:15] Before the Throne
[1:58:17] might not feel like it
[1:58:19] don't look at feelings we don't want to
[1:58:21] look at our feelings Satan wants us to
[1:58:23] look at our feelings
[1:58:24] we want to look to the word
[1:58:26] we just want to completely repeat the
[1:58:29] word back to Satan no the word says that
[1:58:32] I'm a son of God
[1:58:33] that I don't I don't have to go back to
[1:58:35] the spirit of bondage again to fear no
[1:58:37] no no no no no I've met the requirements
[1:58:39] and I know that I've been given the Holy
[1:58:41] Ghost and and maybe my flesh gets a
[1:58:44] little bit scared every once in a while
[1:58:45] but that's just Satan coming around and
[1:58:47] trying to see if he's got any action
[1:58:48] here you know what the word says that
[1:58:51] when when the spirit is cast out of a
[1:58:53] man
[1:58:54] and it's garnished it's all swept out
[1:58:56] the man is in great shape you have to
[1:58:59] have that token you better have it
[1:59:01] because if you don't that spirit's going
[1:59:04] to come back around and see if there's
[1:59:06] any action there at that house if
[1:59:08] there's a party going on and if that
[1:59:10] door is open if we don't have the token
[1:59:12] there brothers and sisters he's going to
[1:59:14] bring seven more worse Devils with them
[1:59:16] into our lives
[1:59:18] and they're going to have a party in US
[1:59:21] we need to make sure we got that token
[1:59:24] and when we do
[1:59:25] he's going to come around and he's going
[1:59:27] to try
[1:59:28] he's going to knock on our door Satan's
[1:59:30] gonna do that he's going to be a box of
[1:59:32] rattlesnakes plopped on our step and and
[1:59:34] maybe like I said before the Box might
[1:59:36] break open and little snakes will go
[1:59:38] everywhere but if we've got the token
[1:59:39] they can't touch us
[1:59:41] we can push that box back and say uh
[1:59:44] I don't care what the doctor says you
[1:59:47] know I honestly believe that's what
[1:59:48] that's what all Heaven is just waiting
[1:59:50] for us to say in our lives and you know
[1:59:53] maybe someone's saying to me tonight
[1:59:55] that's easy for you to say maybe one day
[1:59:56] I'll have to say it
[1:59:59] but what did Brother Branham say
[2:00:01] don't accept it
[2:00:03] that's what the prophet of Malachi 4
[2:00:05] said don't accept it
[2:00:06] he's the one that said you can actually
[2:00:08] get the Holy Ghost if you actually get
[2:00:10] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:12] Christ so which one of those statements
[2:00:14] Bears more gravity which one is is
[2:00:16] greater
[2:00:19] having the understanding that we can get
[2:00:21] the Holy Ghost in our life is the
[2:00:22] greatest for sure
[2:00:23] but to think about it brothers and
[2:00:25] sisters whether we live or whether we
[2:00:27] die we're christs
[2:00:29] it doesn't matter Satan whatever you
[2:00:31] want to do you can't touch this life
[2:00:33] this is Zoe God's own life right here
[2:00:36] talking to you right now
[2:00:39] in first John
[2:00:41] first John chapter 3. as we close I'll
[2:00:44] call the musicians
[2:00:46] behold what manner of love the father
[2:00:48] hath bestowed upon us this is probably
[2:00:51] my my favorite verse in the Bible
[2:00:54] behold what manner of love the father
[2:00:56] hath bestowed upon us
[2:01:00] to think about it brothers and sisters
[2:01:03] 7.8 billion people and and some people
[2:01:06] can say that that that the Lord the
[2:01:10] father hath bestowed just a certain love
[2:01:13] upon us
[2:01:16] that we should be called the sons of God
[2:01:19] how can that possibly be how could it be
[2:01:22] that we would be called the sons of God
[2:01:24] his choice the only thing that we can do
[2:01:27] is just thank him for it just Rejoice
[2:01:29] remember this is the quietest place that
[2:01:32] we're ever going to live
[2:01:33] it's going to be pretty loud over there
[2:01:35] and I'm just going to blow my voice out
[2:01:37] over there on that side but you know
[2:01:39] what I won't be able to because it's
[2:01:40] going to be a perfect voice box and here
[2:01:43] maybe here I'll have to have a little
[2:01:45] bit of laryngitis for a while because
[2:01:47] I'll blow my voice out here who cares
[2:01:49] it'll be for the right cause the word
[2:01:52] says to make a Joyful Noise
[2:01:54] behold what manner of love the father
[2:01:57] hath bestowed upon us Satan
[2:01:59] he's bestowed it upon us not you you
[2:02:02] only wish you only wish but you'll never
[2:02:05] have it and there's a day coming in in
[2:02:07] Revelations 20 verse 10 or written sorry
[2:02:10] yeah 20 verse 10 where you'll be cast
[2:02:13] alive into the Lake of Fire and and your
[2:02:16] smoke will go up forever and ever before
[2:02:18] the Saints that's the same Lake that the
[2:02:21] false prophet and and what the the Beast
[2:02:24] yeah they are that's that's where you'll
[2:02:26] go and you know what we'll go and sit
[2:02:29] with him in his throne because that's
[2:02:31] where he's ordained us for
[2:02:33] behold what manner of love the father
[2:02:34] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[2:02:36] called the sons of God therefore the
[2:02:38] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[2:02:40] not I just believe brothers and sisters
[2:02:42] we've got a reason to Rejoice we don't
[2:02:45] need to worry we don't need to fear all
[2:02:47] we need to do is remind Satan when he
[2:02:49] comes around and tries to give us all
[2:02:50] these troubles and trials in our lives
[2:02:52] just remind them it's only for God's
[2:02:54] perfecting us it's only for my benefit
[2:02:56] it's only so that he can express himself
[2:02:59] through my life he's only going to get
[2:03:01] Glory out of this situation that's the
[2:03:02] only thing that's going to happen
[2:03:03] there's some people that would say dumb
[2:03:05] devil you know he's not dumb he's pretty
[2:03:08] smart he's got all of the cunningness
[2:03:10] he's a he's a worthy adversary
[2:03:13] but you know what he'll never ever ever
[2:03:16] ever be able to compete with God's word
[2:03:19] on your lips
[2:03:21] ever
[2:03:23] Prophet for our day said that God's word
[2:03:25] will defeat Satan any place any time
[2:03:29] in any situation brothers and sisters
[2:03:36] beloved
[2:03:37] [Music]

[2:03:48] shouting fit right there beloved now are
[2:03:52] we the sons of God so everyone who is
[2:03:55] beloved of the father now where are we
[2:03:57] the sons of God and and Satan I know

[2:04:16] of God and you know it better than most
[2:04:19] theologians
[2:04:21] but when this word is actually spoken on
[2:04:23] the lips of a Son of God oh my goodness
[2:04:26] gracious
[2:04:30] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[2:04:32] it does not appear yet appear what we

[2:04:47] sisters how are we going to recognize
[2:04:48] him
[2:04:50] when we we recognize what's going on
[2:04:52] inside us
[2:04:54] but when we have that that song in our
[2:04:57] lives

[2:05:27] when he shall appear we shall be like
[2:05:29] him for we shall see him as he is
[2:05:32] remember
[2:05:33] that we were created in His image
[2:05:36] he chose exactly us for a purpose
[2:05:42] and as we look at one another brothers
[2:05:44] and sisters don't look at one another
[2:05:46] and say oh that's for the justice and
[2:05:49] and and that's brother Toby
[2:05:52] and that's brother miles

[2:07:30] for our day of Malachi 4 Revelations 10
[2:07:32] 7 brother Branham
[2:07:35] he said that he's appearing now his
[2:07:39] appearing is now
[2:07:41] how many years ago
[2:07:43] was that I'm sure someone out there
[2:07:45] knows

[2:07:51] many years ago
[2:07:53] was his appearing and we know that we

[2:07:59] try to encourage you speak the word
[2:08:01] tonight don't be afraid don't let fear
[2:08:03] come on we haven't been given that
[2:08:05] Spirit of bondage again back to fear
[2:08:07] we've been given the spirit of adoption
[2:08:09] whereby we cry Abba Father
[2:08:12] because we know who we are
[2:08:14] let's just bow in prayer
[2:08:16] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[2:08:18] so thankful for your word we're so
[2:08:20] thankful for your grace and your mercy
[2:08:22] Lord we're so thankful for the position
[2:08:24] that you have chosen each one of us Lord
[2:08:26] to be here to represent in this Dying
[2:08:29] World father Lord we know that the the
[2:08:31] last Ministry is to the total lost and
[2:08:34] father this is the darkest of all the
[2:08:36] ages Lord It's Satan's Eden this is the
[2:08:39] only age that your Prophet said that
[2:08:41] Satan was declared the God of this age
[2:08:44] and father we know that just like Satan
[2:08:47] crept into the garden and and he
[2:08:49] beguiled Adam's wife oh Father this age
[2:08:54] you have come down and you have also
[2:08:57] taken a wife of your own choosing but
[2:08:59] Lord we know that you didn't have to
[2:09:01] beguile her all you had to do is speak
[2:09:03] to her gently and she recognized that
[2:09:06] voice and Lord Jesus when your voice
[2:09:08] when your sweet voice spoke to that seed
[2:09:11] Gene in your Eve in this evil age oh
[2:09:16] Father this it's just a life came to her
[2:09:18] father and Lord tonight here we are
[2:09:21] understanding that we truly are now the
[2:09:24] sons of God that we are truly now seated
[2:09:26] together in Heavenly places with you in
[2:09:29] Christ Jesus father I pray the words
[2:09:31] were spoken tonight Lord would just be
[2:09:33] an encouragement to your children Lord
[2:09:35] that we wouldn't live in in the in the
[2:09:38] in the spirit of bondage to fear oh Lord
[2:09:42] but that we would have authority in our
[2:09:44] lives
[2:09:45] that we would recognize Who We Are
[2:09:48] that we would have your word on our lips
[2:09:51] and that we would be able to recognize
[2:09:53] Satan every time that he speaks and
[2:09:55] father that we would just put him down
[2:09:58] and cast him out in the name of Jesus
[2:10:01] Christ because when we speak we know
[2:10:04] that it's not just us speaking it's you
[2:10:06] speaking so father we just want to give
[2:10:09] you the full preeminence in every one of
[2:10:11] our Lives Lord Jesus if there's anything
[2:10:13] in our lives that we need to correct we
[2:10:16] pray that you would just give us the
[2:10:17] strength to do it father Lord that you
[2:10:20] would just Lord hear our hearts father
[2:10:22] our hearts desire is to serve you with
[2:10:24] all of our might father we just long to
[2:10:27] be more like you we pray that you would
[2:10:29] just go with us as we go our separate
[2:10:31] ways father and that if it Be Your Will
[2:10:33] for us to meet again on Sunday that you
[2:10:35] would just Lord come and dwell with us
[2:10:37] again come and fellowship with us again
[2:10:39] come and speak to us again Lord Jesus
[2:10:41] one more time just tell us a little bit
[2:10:43] more about who we are oh father that we
[2:10:46] could come to that recognition about
[2:10:48] about what we are in this age because we
[2:10:51] know when that happens your your Prophet
[2:10:53] said the Rapture will go on father
[2:10:55] that's our desire is to see that Rapture
[2:10:57] go
[2:10:59] but until then father we just want to be
[2:11:01] about your business
[2:11:02] we want to do exactly your will father

[2:11:34] how do you describe
[2:11:39] a love that flows from east to west
[2:11:43] and runs as deep as it is why
[2:11:50] oh you know all our homes
[2:11:56] you know all our fears
[2:12:01] and words could not express the love we
[2:12:06] feel but we long for you to hear
[2:12:12] if you listen to our
[2:12:15] hearts
[2:12:18] hear our Spirits say

[2:12:50] our love so listen to our hearts
[2:12:57] words could fall like rage
[2:13:02] from these lips of mine
[2:13:08] and if I had a thousand years I would
[2:13:14] still run out of time
[2:13:18] so if you listen to our hearts
[2:13:23] Hearts Every Beat will say
