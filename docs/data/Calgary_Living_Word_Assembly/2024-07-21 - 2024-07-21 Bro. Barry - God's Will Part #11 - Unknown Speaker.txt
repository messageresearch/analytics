of time oh Father there was voices that voice that he heard and one one Unison said to him keep pressing on father I pray that would be our desire that that would be the desire of each one who's affected by brother George's life to keep pressing on Father we just want to remember the rest of the requests Lord Jesus those who are traveling today the services in Lethbridge and in in Edmonton today Father be with brother Toby father as he ministers your word father brother Gilbert as he ministers to your Saints in Lethbridge Lord and each one father who's gathered together in your name we

brother and his wife and uh family is with us today sory where are you right there God bless you I'm I'm sure that you know you probably heard but if you haven't and for those people who have heard who were here uh this is an answer to prayer this was actually brought forth as a prayer request that there would be an opportunity an occasion and sister Michelle gave the testimony about it and uh just a wonderful opportunity to meet you all look forward to getting to know you a little better um I don't know everybody that's here today is visitor God bless you each one I trust you feel right at home uh someone kind of always been special in my heart is Brother Willie Vander I got to meet him at the Edmonton youth camps years ago and uh he's since moved to Tennessee but he's come to visit certainly thankful to see you brother and excited to shake your hand God bless you and as I as I mentioned each one I'm sorry if I don't have everyone's names but uh God richly bless you I trust like I said you feel right at home today oh my thank you musicians if you have your Bibles today I'd just like to read a scripture from Luke chapter 7 Luke chapter 7 verse one a very familiar story Luke chapter 7 I think it's just a an amazing story I want to continue on with our discussion about God's will but just in a little bit of a different way Luke 7:1 it says now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people he entered into capernium and a certain centurion's servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die he was pretty ill and when when he heard of Jesus he sent unto him the Elders of the Jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant and when they came to Jesus they besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue then Jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the Centurion sent friends to him saying unto him Lord trouble not thyself for I'm not worthy that thou should US enter under my roof wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee this guy was in a real spot eh that's right but say in a word and my servant shall be healed let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just pray that this morning just like this Centurion said father just just say a word Lord Jesus father we have many needs in our lives sometimes it's physical sometimes it's Financial sometimes it's relationship based father this morning we know that you're more than able to meet each and every one of those needs but father most of all we pray that you would just get right down to the root cause of it all and that is our spiritual health Lord Jesus father we pray that you would minister to our very Souls today Father one word to our very Souls today Father could change every aspect of our life every single need that we have could be met if we're willing to Humble ourselves unto your word today so father we pray that you would just break down the barriers Lord help us to get beside ourselves today and give you the preeminence that you desire Lord Jesus father that when we leave this building here today we would not be the same but we would say we have truly heard from you Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a few announcements before we get going here we uh have a potluck this afternoon we'll meet out at our house today and I believe everything is set and uh we'll aim to start for 2:00 so if you plan to come and want to eat there's uh going to be probably lots of food there so we certainly welcome you um certainly thankful for the Brethren who are out in the mission field this morning brother Toby as we mentioned in Edmonton at Edmonton Living Word and brother Gilbert in Lethbridge with the Lethbridge meetings there that Lethbridge uh Gathering is sure getting good good there's a lot going on there and we're certainly thankful to see the Lord move there um just wanted to mention we have the annual meetings they have the annual meetings happening in Edmonton next weekend at end time message Tabernacle I believe Brother David Siler and Wayne Lawson will be there they're the speakers for that we have uh brother Joel golant here on July 3st and uh brother Jos has agreed to take the service for me on August the 4th we're going to be traveling that weekend uh and then it's amazing because we've planned this a year out we've talked about it often on we have brother Andrew Glover here August 16th 17th and 18th and I believe those dates are marked on the calendar and the times as well so if you have any questions by all means just take a look there or reach out we're certainly happy to talk to you as well um are you happy this morning certainly wonderful to be gathered together in his name amen there's a lot going on in the world uh I'm not going to get political I could I find it fascinating because as a believer of this message of the hour we can see uh how late it really is we can see the the handwriting on the wall as it were and there's so much going on and it's happening so quickly um it's just amazing to be alive in this day I just wanted to say a big thank you um to someone and I don't know who it's kind of an interesting statement Hallelujah two years ago for my birthday I was given a gift an anonymous gift an envelope with a card that said God bless you Pastor this is for you and uh hopefully you can find yourself a nice suit of clothes and so two years I've held on to it and I've waited and I found the right opportunity the right occasion and the Lord really blessed me it was well worth the w wait but I don't know who gave it to me I know someone did and uh it was from this congregation so I just want to say God richly bless you and thank you from the bottom of my heart I uh I'm not a shopper I don't like to go clothes shopping so it took me two years before I could actually do something with it but you know every time I would think about it I should go and do something with this gift I should go to the store the mall I think I even talked to brother Daniel about it somehow some way maybe we could do this but I just I I can't do it I can't go to a store and look at yeah it doesn't doesn't doesn't work for me so anyways God bless you thank you so much whoever that was I very much appreciate that and uh you know brother bradam talks about it I didn't bring the quote this morning I'm just going to mention it he said there's something really important about having a good suit of clothes it's one thing to have a suit of clothes but they wear out when you sweat when you perspire and and you wear them a lot so there's something really good about getting a good suit of clothes and I waited to get a good suit so God bless you thank you so much it means a lot to me amen getting into our uh our lesson today um the service we had talked a lot recently about God's will being his word and understanding that that's what the prophet said that's what God Said through the prophet that God's will really is his word and it's important for us to understand that God's will is his word and I know that many many people know that there excuse me there might be one or two people that don't really know that but that is truly what the prophet for our day said God's will truly is his word so it behooves us to know what his word says how can we know his will if we're not willing to read his word and and how do we know what his will is if we don't read the correct word there's so many translations and versions now of the word of God if anybody is interested or or curious the prophet in our day we we understand it full well he used the King James version Bible for that purpose and some people might not understand the prophet some people understand the prophet and uh it it's it's a one room Schoolhouse so I trust that you'll bear with me many people probably know more uh about the message than I'll ever know and and I don't claim to be a message Theologian I just know that I met the author of this book I was able to meet the author of the King James version of the Bible some people might say how could you do that because there was a bunch of different people that actually were the authors no no no there's no authors there's only one author and it's not the father and it's not the son and it's not the Holy Ghost it's the Lord Jesus Christ God almighty is the author of this book but it's Satan's job to try and get it just one word off so some people would say well I I just like this version of the Bible just a little bit better and I like that version of the Bible just a little bit easier to read to understand you know sometimes we'll even use an amplified version to try and expound upon a word or a thought or a sentence and and that's all fine and good but the absolute comes down to the King James version Bible because that is the Bible that was given to the prophet to use for this age and when we want to try and and and and argue that and and try and get around that I would just have to say what spirit is it that's trying to do that that causes a person to want to actually do something different than what the prophet brought it just doesn't make sense and we know that it's not the same Spirit that's all so anyways the the the King James version Bible is it and I apologize maybe it's a little bit straight but that's really the way it is it's got to be that way because if we don't follow the instruction of the Prophet we're not going to get the right results it's just not going to happen so anyways as usual I would say this if you really want to understand just get the Holy Ghost amen the only way you're going to understand what we're saying here is to get the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the only way you're going to get the true baptism of the holy spirit is to come according to the word for our day and that word for our day is to repent get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and it's for you and your family and even whosoever anybody in the world it's for them if they want it if they're willing to come according to the word amen hallelujah but it's not for everyone unfortunately you know some some people would say first that uh we've got to go through the justification stage and that we have to go through the sanctification stage and yeah indeed we we have the works of Grace and and we need to experience those we need to see those in our lives but I I I would strongly caution anyone to to hold back from getting baptized if they have the desire to get baptized if they understand what's being said to them and they understand there's a a promise of the Holy Ghost for them in their life I think it would just be a shame for a person to say well hold on you need to just wait a little bit because maybe we need to see a little bit of justification in your life or maybe we need to see a little bit of sanctification in your life and and we know that that justification and sanctification there they're compared to many times by the prophet in our day he uses a story about a a cup being being being tossed in the chicken yard and we all have talked about the chicken yard a lot it's a messy place it's not a very nice place and how that cup can be just there in the chicken yard and it's a cup and it's got a use or at least it had a use if you've ever seen what would would look like after a while but while it's there you can pick that cup up and and as you pick that cup up that's justifying that cup and saying that cup is is potentially useful for something but it's covered in dirt maybe it's got worms maybe it's got chicken dung on it maybe it's just a nasty cup and you would never think you'd want to use it again but you could take that cup now and take it and sanitize that cup and wash it out so you could be justified being picked up out of the ground but then you can actually be Sanctified or sanitized cleaned out and set aside for service so the two acts justification and sanctification you know what can happen is sometimes we can find ourselves stuck in a position where we're just Sanctified we're just sanitized and set aside for service and you know unfortunately those those situations are pretty easy to spot because there's a lot of legalism that goes along with that I'm all cleaned out and I'm ready to go I'm set aside for service brother everything in my life is good but look at your life and look at their life and look at all the other situations when we start to see that we can see what's G on we're just stuck in a stage we're stuck in a face but I I say go on and get into Christ get that bap of the Holy Ghost get the filling of that cup now when you get full you're no longer interested in all of that stuff that you once were you're not stuck being Sanctified that's right you can go on to joy and peace and love and longsuffering and gentleness and goodness and peace you don't have to stay in that situation but yes indeed we do have the works of Grace uh you do need to get the Holy Ghost in your life to understand what we're talking about today where I'm going today brothers and sisters is kind of picking up from where we left off a little while ago talking about God's will being his word and and how sort of we have Wednesday night service crossing over into Sunday service this is a little bit of what I preached in Ohio and I trust it's okay I actually had prepared this on my heart for here and and I just couldn't stop with it I had to preach it there and uh I think it's just a wonderful thing and we could probably preach on this until the Rapture comes because this is the bride's Commission we could preach about all of the different ages that have gone by and they nice historical lessons and there's things in there that we could get out of it but really brothers and sisters who are we and where are we at is really what's going to change our body this is the bride's Revival and for some people they might be in the leoan church age but other people are in The Bride age there is an age of the Bride of Jesus Christ and it's not being stuck in a Sanctified position it's not being stuck in the leoan church age amen we're not interested in just getting people to church when we're just getting people to church we're just getting people Justified and Sanctified and that's it we're getting an association we're getting a a membership maybe a badge that would do something for us and you know brothers and sisters I handed out those little little Cloud brooches those badges that's not something that's an association that's something to remind us about what's happened in this age something significant again happened in 1963 brothers and sisters and it wasn't just something that's just put on a poster and and and we pass it around and now we just put it on a brooch and put it on our our our suit or our our coat or our hat or whatever it is we do with it that is to represent something very significant it's not to worship a man it's to understand that there was actually a coming of someone very significant to actually open the word of God not just to open the word of God but to take the word of God God and put it back in the hands of man again just like in the Garden of Eden we had an opportunity to live for a thousand years to actually create we know that Adam was given a bride so that he could recreate himself that's the reason he had a bride taken from his side but we know that she fell but the purpose of it was so that they could demonstrate the life of God we know God was God of heaven and Adam was God of the Earth but what happened was he stepped out to save his wife she fell he loved her she was a part of him he wouldn't let her go so he went and he rescued her and doing so he stepped out of Eternity with Mankind and created the fall it wasn't Eve that did it Eve caused the fall sure but Adam is the one that truly caused it because he stepped out to save his wife now some might say brother bam said it differently and I'm not interested in that I'm just trying to illustrate this brothers and sisters what happened was they had free access to the tree of life that tree of life came and walked with them in the cool of the evening until they stepped out from their Eternal estate from their first estate and when they did that that tree of life was now blocked forever amen there was a flaming sword that was put in front of that tree of life stopping them from access to that to coming and walking in the cool of the evening fellowshipping with that word and that word that tree of life was God himself the Lord Jesus Christ now whether it was his theophany body or whether it was a tree I'm not getting into that today what I am saying is that one that walked with him Adam in the cool of the evening it was stopped it was blocked because of the fall but 1963 something significant happened that that same one that walked with him in the cool of the evening came down and actually opened the way back to the tree of life again that's what happened in 1963 that's why we wear that brooch that's why we have that picture because we identify what happened it's way more than just a man that that had a Supernatural Ministry in his life it's the Lord Jesus Christ yes it is indwelling his bride body thank you Lord we're not interested in just getting people to church we're interested in getting people to Christ and even more I would say we're interested in getting Christ into people because when Christ truly gets into people people become new creatures amen they don't still have the old desires the old tempers the old mannerisms the old problems in their lives they change so I want to say today if we still have the old mannerisms in our lives what's wrong yeah is it the fruit of the spirit living out through us because if it ain't the fruit of the spirit living out through us what's going on I want to get into it eventually we're not going to today we know what the fruit of the spirit is I'm going to mention this a few different times you know what's really been on my heart brothers and sisters is the fruit of the spirit we talk about it so much we know what the fruit of the spirit is I'm not going to really name it right now but I just want to say this the fruit of the spirit is something that we all desire I know we do if I said to the today who desires the fruit of the spirit in their lives who desires to eat of the fruit of the spirit in their lives I'm sure everybody would put their hand up in here I'm not asking for a show of hands but you know what I believe the Lord's been showing me the fruit of the spirit isn't for us amen the fruit of the spirit is for others amen what fruit is hanging on our trees malice anger frustration Vengeance all these different fruit is that what people is that all our spouses can pick off our tree oh my a buz saww temper that's what we give our wife today a buz saww temper we we give our our husband uh uh Rebellion we give our our our spouses our children can only see parents that are so caught up in their lives in their world with their careers they've got no time for them I'm speaking from experience here I'm not talking about anyone here except for this guy this is what we went through here in our family ask my wife but what fruit do we have bearing on our leaves because what did he say I am the vine and ye are the branches and the branches that produce fruit he'll Purge yeah so what fruit are we bearing for our family to pick what fruit are we bearing for our brothers and our sisters to pick because if it's not according to the word it's the wrong fruit brothers and sisters it's the wrong fruit and you know what every fruit is for a purpose the fruit contains all I wasn't going to do this today the fruit contains the seed and every seed will bring forth after its own kind so if we only have that fruit on our branches our children are going to be eating that fruit brother Toby said it when he preached we could be we can be justified we can be Sanctified and we can be teaching our children that that's as far as you need to go and what's going to happen to those children they're going to grow up and they're going to think that's as far as we need to go it's okay to live a different life outside of church is it it's not I'm here to tell you it's not our lives outside of church had better line up with our lives inside church or our lives inside church had better line out with our lives outside of church you understand what I'm saying we can't live two lives we can't be two people come on the word of God says that a sweet well sweet water doesn't come forth from the same well as Bitter Water they don't mix you get brackish water and you can't drink that water yes indeed we need the works of Grace amen but you know what just the works of Grace is just getting people to church we want to get into Christ and you know there's been Decades of Creeds and dogmas I I came into the message about 2005 I was raised in in Pentecost and you know I I I I I know I I watched a lot of late night television a lot of evangelists on TV begging for money and calling for the will of God in terms of blessings and and give give give and I thought you know that's just all Christianity is what a joke why would I ever do that until one time I heard that God sent a prophet and I thought if God sent a prophet then he must have a word in his mouth for someone and because of that I took a look I had to say wow maybe that's someone is me what does he say what is the word of that Prophet because I want to know if God sent a prophet what did he say and you know what he said he said there's been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there's got to be one there has to come one oh my brother bradam he says this is just uh for free I don't know if you want to bring it up he says there has been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides just type in Brides brides I'm sure it'll come up but he says there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride amen there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection am until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs right what good does it do to go get a new suit of clothes and come to church and present ourselves one with the other if we're not living the dynamic power of Jesus Christ Our Children see a double life I'll guarantee you brothers and sisters if that's what we're doing what we're going to do is train our children that that's acceptable and they're going to do that and what's worse is they will come to the place where they will say there's nothing to that man that's a a shell why would I want to pretend to be a Christian yeah I might as well eat drink and be married cuz tomorrow I die all my buddies are going to the Stampede all my buddies are going out to the bar all my buddies are doing whatever it is my buddies are doing and why do you have buddies like that in the first place because the parents taught you that it was okay brothers and sisters it's not okay we need to fellowship with fellow Believers God bless you Carpenters it's good to see you I was wondering if you'd make it brother randam says until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it I had a friend one time who had a car when we were young and I I I guess now I can see it but at the time I could never understand and he had this car and all he wanted to do was polish it he we were too young to drive his parents let him Park this car in the backyard and alls he wanted to do is worship this car he wanted to go and sit in this car and he wanted to look at this car and he wanted to polish this car and it didn't run but that's all he wanted to do was I I I was like goodness isn't there more to life than cars what's wrong with this what good does it do to polish it up if you can't drive it maybe one day maybe one day brothers and sisters what if you die today you'll never get to drive the car but I want to say if you are that car get the Dynamics in it because if you die today at least you know you're going to the great I was going to say Garage in the sky but that's not right no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work and you know I I just think this is so beautiful that's what he proved right that's what Jesus Christ proved amen that's what he proved when he came to earth when he lived on earth when he taught on earth when he broke bread and ate as a man when he just lived amongst fellow men and did what the Believers did in those days went fishing yeah hung out did the stuff they had church but what he did was he proved he proved that there had to be a dynamic power that comes into the mechanics and brother Ram says that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word now this is where we're going to get into our our our lesson how we're going to grab the ball and push a little forward today he wasn't only the word but he was God himself amen amen the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead we know that it went dark right the moon said that he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again how is the whole world going to recognize that he's alive again the televangelists all the different great evangelists just because he died at Calvary no because there's a resurrection and that Resurrection is deep inside that Resurrection is in the heart of the believer amen but when that happens it's not a different life from his word no no no it's got to be exactly the fruit of the spirit we have shortcomings in our lives we always will fight this flesh but this flesh will always yield to the word of God always when it's his Dynamic power living in us and we know that Dynamic power brothers and sisters I want to make it plain as plain as plain it's it's the literal life of Jesus Christ which is the Holy Ghost amen that's why we say the Holy Ghost that's the dynamic power in the car that's the dynamic power in the life of the believer we know that this life the things that we contend with here all of the conditions of soft living all of the good foods that we can eat all the process foods that we could eat all the things that destroy these bodies they'll put us in the grave but that Dynamic power will get us out of the grave and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him thank you Lord and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelation any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride I think that's so powerful it's so good if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him the Bride of Jesus Christ when we're talking the bride of Jesus Christ we're not just talking about an exclusive group of people even though they are we're not just talking about people who have great Revelation even though they do we're talking about the literal manifestation of Jesus Christ right that's powerful yeah Prophet said it yes even more than that I would say God said it through the prophet yes she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone like of his life power of his power she is him it's beautiful how brother bradam brings this he talks about the the spoken word being the Original Seed and how every single seed will bring forth after its own kind and we know that comes right out of Genesis right out of the the way God created everything in the earth to happen and it's so neat because brother bradam he says if you take an apple seed just a tiny little seed if you take that apple seed and look at it every single Apple that will ever grow on the tree that can come forth from that seed is already right there in that little seed it's so beautiful and and it can't bring forth anything else except for apples because it's an apple seed and that's why it's so important to get people to Jesus Christ because if we get people to a denominational perspective of the message of the hour sorry to say it that way but it's true if we get people to a denominational perspective of the message of the hour what's going to happen is they're going to bring forth a life and it's going to be the same thing people are going to think it's okay to live this way what's going to happen is we're going to live a stunted life spiritually speaking we're going to live a thousand miles below our privilege and we don't want to do that we want to see people get all the way into Jesus Christ to see that Dynamic power of Jesus Christ because when our children get sick somebody needs to pray for them there's times brothers and sisters where we don't have the time to call the pastor or the deacons or or our brother or our sister to pray for the situation we need to fall on our knees and cry out to God right now Lord we need you now that's right and you know what when that Dynamic power is there he's just right there too because he is that Dynamic power and it's beautiful because when that Dynamic power speaks we read it on Wednesday when that Dynamic power speaks though through the lips of a mortal human that's the same as deity speaking when we have his holy spirit yeah when we have his holy ghost living through us then she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him that is so powerful I I think that's just amazing talking about our scripture today the centurion's faith we stopped uh we stopped reading here we stopped reading at verse 7even wherefore neither this is Luke 7: 7 wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed for I also am a man set under Authority having under me soldiers and I say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel that powerful he had a revelation he understood a man of authority and brothers and sisters I want to say today as the Bride of Jesus Christen we have the ability to call upon on that man of authority and all creation has to obey his voice am but we're not going to ask outside of what his will is right if we do we won't see an answer the way we want it but when we do ask according to his will look out all heavens and earth will move for your word his word through you to come to pass you know out out of the the junction of time in 1956 I I just think it's so beautiful this story here of the centurion's faith we know brother Bram talks about the Centurion being a type of the Gentile and many times in many of the the messages he compares the Centurion to gyrus where where gyrus needed a healing for his daughter and uh the Centurion needed the healing for his servant and and gyrus desired the laying on of hands but the Centurion said no you don't have to touch anybody you don't even have to come I and I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof all you need to do is just speak the word and at Thy word we could see a healing come to pass amen out of the junction of time brother Bram says as a gos brother as a gospel preacher this morning I believe that the Holy Ghost speaking through mortal lips today of anointed ministers are speaking the time has come time is here and omnipotence is answering the miraculous is taking place has to we're at the junction but how can this miraculous take place outside of that Dynamic power of the real Holy Ghost living out through us and there when he done all the miraculous while omnipotence God manifested In the Flesh speak the word Lord and my servant will heal my servant will be will live he knew amen that Roman Centurion knowed he was a man under Authority that he knowed that whatever was under him had whatever he said they had to do it he said I come to say to this man come and he comes and that man go and he goes said I'm under Authority and everything under my authority obeys me and Lord I'm not worthy that you come in my house just speak the word hallelujah he know that was omnipotence brothers and sisters he was standing in the flesh there yeah but where is he today is he in those seats at the back over there is he in the seats at the front here the word of God says where two or three are gathered together in his name that he's there it doesn't mean that he's here just in a spirit form floating around the room it means that Dynamic power is is in the heart of the believer so I want to say to you today if you've got the holy ghost in your life you have Jesus Christ in your seat if you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life desire to get the Holy Ghost in your life right and you will have omnipotence he know when omnipotent smoke miraculous would take place oh my oh my we serve a mighty God brothers and sisters and he wants to show his love he wants to show his life in our lives yes we don't need to be afraid we don't need to be worried the devil is going to be right there on your shoulders saying don't say it you'll have an inspiration in your heart to say something with your lips to speak something into existence to speak a word but the devil will be right there saying don't say it and you know you can really notice it when it comes time to worship I'm not judging anyone because I've experienced it there's times in my life where I would come to a worship service to church oh my and I'd have something maybe we'd have a fight on the way to church not very often but sometimes it's tough getting out the door when you've got children and you want to be on time you want to actually get it to church there's times where the pressure comes but you know what the the the most obvious time is when you come to church and you just don't have the desire to worship why don't you have the desire to lift your hands and worship I'll tell you why because the devil is stopping you the devil is stopping you because that's the one thing that God wor desires is worship he is an object of worship and if we don't worship Him the rocks will immediately cry out to him that's the word of God that's where we need to understand his will if you want to see blessing in your life brothers and sisters when you don't have that desire to worship fight through it fight through it do do something outrageous and raise your hands unto him and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word I desire to Worship You Lord I don't care about the song leader I don't care about the musicians I don't care about anything else except for you Lord and give him your very best worship the word of God says to make a Joyful Noise it doesn't say to have perfect pitch to be able to do everything according to the way human beings think they should give God something to honor and see if he won't come around and bless you and you know what it might not be a blessing like you think it's always going to be a little bit different sometimes it's exactly the way you think but other times it's totally different that's the God we serve amen but if you have that that that thing where you just feel I just don't want to worship I just I'm tired this morning or I'm frustrated this morning or whatever this morning I don't want to worship that's the devil learn to identify him and kick him out brothers and sisters if we want more from God there's more from God to be had the reason we want more is because there's more where there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond and he wants to respond he wants to respond out of the spoken word is the Original Seed brother Brown I'm talking about the pyramid he talks about how the pyramid the way it was built and he says in this message that Enoch built it when Enoch built this pyramid he says that when he built this pyramid he built those blocks so close together you can't even fit a razor blade between them there's no mortar there's no mortar holding the pyramid together there's there's rocks that are cut out so Precision so perfectly and they're not just cut out straight Square rocks they're cut out with I don't know what you call them pivot Points or hinge points points different different shapes in the Rocks geometrical shapes to hold them together to lock them together so that if this world shakes they will stay in place and we know the pyramids are pretty old they've been there in that shape for a long time brother Ram he says blend with this word in that pyramid you can take a razor blade and you can't run between them rocks where the mortar was it's so fitly put together they said Solomon's Temple was the same see God is taking the elect out of the Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out why is it hybrid Pentecostal church we might ask that question I think it's good maybe we'll just talk about that a little bit why is the Pentecostal Church hybrid because what they did was they said the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost of having the holy ghost in your life is being able to speak in tongues period yeah come on can you imagine that's it that's all it was but that's what causes it to be hybrid we don't want to take the word of God and say a period behind any one of the words am we want to say be it unto me according to Thy word but the Pentecostal Church decided to actually just just like many other churches this is the way it is this is the way we saw God move in our midst and we're going to say that this is what we're going to do and this is the way we're going to roll forwards now as a group and you know what it can actually happen in a congregation in a church brothers and sisters we could see something fantastic something significant happen in our lives a real blessing from God maybe a healing happens maybe somebody gets saved maybe they do a Victory lap in the church during a service and and and we start to think well what was the song We sang how did we create that environment what was it that that caused that atmosphere because we want to do that again and then we start to do that what that's doing is hybridizing we're actually saying that now we can manipulate the way God's going to do things we can't do that what we need to do is humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will Lift us up so long as we're willing to do that he will lift us up but God is taking the elect out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word I love how he says this God's doing it brothers and sisters this is the thread that's probably going to weave in and out through the whole thing today God's doing it we we said it on Wednesday God is doing this we don't need to try and do this the only thing we need to do is humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord how do we do that we've said it before I'll continually say it brothers and sisters humble ourselves one to another amen cuz where is the Lord amen the Lord isn't at this altar even though sometimes he is sometimes we need to actually take a step forward by faith and come to the Altar and and and ask for prayer I'm not saying don't do that I I would never say don't do that but what I am saying is this building does not contain God your heart is what contains God he lives in the human heart that Temple not made with hands is where you will find God God is taking the elect out of the Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word with this word I think it's so beautiful the word itself will blend with this word with the message of the hour the message of the hour being lived out in our lives will blend so much with the word that it will blend with this word this word that he's speaking that he's bringing and telling the world it will blend with this word there Comes The Headstone crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace The Headstone Amen brother bradam talks about The Headstone The Headstone comes down and it becomes one yes yeah we've said it in the past many times we have the diagram it shows the stature of the perfect man and then it has the flat spot and then it says the Holy Ghost then it has another pyramid on top of it what he's speaking of right here brothers and sisters is it becoming one pyramid one pyramid nothing between separating any of it it's all one that is exactly where we're heading and that's exactly what's taking place today even here in this service yeah brother Bram goes on to say in the spoken words The Original Seed Ministry just exactly like that word he says here you are like this see on there see how it way down way wide down here and it keeps getting closer and closer and closer the ministry after a while here come here's Luther justification Justified here come Wesley Sanctified bunch here come Pentecostal restoration of the gifts now God is taking from there honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with that word there's the bride take her up I think it's beautiful because I'm going to go back to the fruit of the spirit brothers and sisters how do we know when we're actually fitting with the word of God how does that work in our lives how do we see the representation we can quote the Bible we know the scripture we know the message we can quote the quotes we go to church we have service in the church we have a wonderful life that we live we're dedicated but do we have that fruit hanging on our branches brothers and sisters if it's not hanging on our branches then we haven't made it yet to that place where the word is becoming the word in our lives that Dynamic power has not taken hold yet it's not too late am all we need to do is give him a little bit of worship if you want a tree to grow you got to water it and we know that watering the word causes a life to come forward here come Pentecostal restoration of the gifts now God is taking from there honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up I think it's such a wonderful thing there's the bride fit exactly with the word and how does it fit with the word like we said it has to be the fruit of the spirit in our lives amen amen I say Lord help me I get angry you know what there's times where I've actually wanted to be vengeful malice in my life you know what that's not the fruit of the spirit right and you know the devil will come around and say that's you and you have to say no no no that's not me that's you that's not me that's you once upon a time I I I think that was me before I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's going to he doesn't believe we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he didn't believe that Jesus was Jesus he didn't believe that Jesus was almighty God that's why he kept coming at him and that's why he put him on a cross because had he known that he was The Lord Of Glory what does the word say they never would have crucified the Lord Of Glory just like him Jesus manifesting God you manifesting God he doesn't believe it one bit he's going to come around and try and remind you about anger he's going to come around and try and remind you about all these other things these problems these issues that we had in our former lives just tell the devil they're his give them back to him rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ there's one thing that he can't stand brothers and sisters and that's the name of Jesus Christ just remind him the name of Jesus Christ amen you know I just think it was such a beautiful lesson brother Toby and the Sunday School lesson that he brought even had a brother say you know you should give him a a a second sermon on that because it was so good and I think Lord willing will definitely do that but you know there's lots of little nuggets that I got out of it but one I wanted to bring today is is simply this as married folks because we're talking about the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ we're talking about the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride we're talking about the two becoming one and and brother Toby said it so masterfully he even quoted it that the representation on Earth our marriage between husband and wife is an exact reflection of our relationship with our Heavenly bridegroom he instituted marriage to demonstrate that there will be a union so when we live our lives in a marriage here on Earth does it reflect the image that we desire to have with our heavenly father and if it doesn't why doesn't it I think it's just a a a magnificent thought and I'll tell you it's caused me to step back and recalibrate all that I've thought about in terms of marriage it's wonderful to be married to have a wife to have a bride but how do I want my heavenly bridegroom to treat me as a bride come on do I treat my bride the way that I desire to have him treat me help us Lord I I I had to take a step back I actually had to take a stagger back and say Lord have mercy because I I don't think I think about my wife the way that you think about me according to Jeremiah chapter 29 I know the thoughts that I think towards you hey thoughts of love and peace and joy there's times in my life where I didn't line up with the word of God in the way that I thought about my wife and now there's lots of things that got in the way I I I let work get in the way I let my mismanagement of time get in the way I let all these different things happen in my life God never did it to me and you know what the devil will only do what you allow him to do he doesn't come around sometimes we do have cataclysmic circumstances that God allows they don't happen by accident God allows them so that he can actually bring something out in our lives but you know what brother Toby said was masterful I thought just a simple question can we go to our spouse and say to her or to him are you happy are you happy in this marriage honey and you better step back you better brace because they might say not really but why are we in it if we can't be honest right amen and why would we not want to have our spouse happy we want we want we want to be happy we want him to make sure that we're happy we want him to bless our bank account we want him to bless our bodies with good health we want him to bless us with good preaching we want him to bless our children we want we want we want what about her yeah what about him what about our spouse are we willing to give everything everything that we've got for their happiness because I'll say this to the young people if you're thinking about getting married don't you dare think about getting married unless you're willing to give everything you've got for their happiness amen and if we're in a position where we're not doing that I want to say today by the word of God take a step backwards and recalibrate your thinking you want to have a good marriage ask her ask him are you happy and if they're not why not maybe you can actually make it better maybe you could help the situation but the trouble is we got to look in the mirror we got to be willing to take a long look in the mirror and if we're seeing anything other than the word of God living out through our lives then maybe we're looking in the wrong mirror maybe we need to look in the mirror of the word is everything okay yeah okay I just want to make sure looked like something maybe wasn't we've got to make sure that we know our spouses are happy if our spouses aren't happy Our Lives aren't going to be happy and you know what our children aren't going to be happy and sometimes we can drag that unhappy with us everywhere we go and the funny thing is as we do when we're not happy and the other people you don't have to say a word other people see it other people feel it other people know it right it's the way it is we can't hide it we think we're hiding it but everyone can see it you know it's like looking in the mirror we want to make sure we're looking in the right mirror though brothers and sisters it's got to be the mirror of the word amen you know out of the spoken word is the Original Seed but the bromy says now Christ was manifest for a purpose Christ was manif to destroy the works of the devil he says you believe that now I can't explain all this I'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high place so you won't stay too long Christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil is that right amen you all believe that amen what was he God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil because we know that the devil is a hybrid he can't create the only thing he can do is hybridize the only thing that he can do is manipulate the only thing that he can do is is hybridize whatever is going on he can only manipulate what's happening he is not a Creator he says what was he he was God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the the same where's his body now his body is to do the same because the body is the head and the body is together that's why you don't have a husband here and a wife here and she's going and doing her thing and he's going and doing his thing and they call themselves married husbands and wives it doesn't work that way the husbands and the wives are together as one working together for the same cause amen but when they're not it causes a problem in the body just like having a church just to say it plainly when you get people pulling one way and pulling another way it's not in unity if it's not in unity it's not one right if we want to see the power of God move in our services we've got to come together as one to be in one mind and one Accord and we know we don't want to have our own thoughts about it we want his thoughts about it his word says let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in you now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was that right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational thou virgin born from the word and I know this is where people who are denominational who are parts of different denominations or maybe parts of churches who maybe are inter denominational uh churches that whatever when you get into having the the the the Apostles Creed and and and the nian Creed as part of what you believe as a church you you have the trinitarian doctrine whether you agree to it or not you are a part of the the United Federation of world churches you put yourself in that position because you don't might maybe see it but the elders have already signed the proclamation to join up to sign up with the other mother of Harlot the the main church we know that but the thing about it is we can find ourselves being a virgin to the word and the only way that's going to happen is to just say be it unto me according to the word I'm not interested in having a hybrid religion I'm not interested in saying that I'm affiliated with anybody but you know the folks that we just describe they'll say well now you're getting crazy because you're not willing to be Affiliated if you're not affiliated with everyone you're going to say that your Sovereign assembly your assembly is Sovereign then then you're you're a wildc card you're you're Fanatics right and yes indeed we are yes it's amazing because we truly are coming to that place where we are the Fanatics amen a church called out from a church a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word I think that's so beautiful because every seed will bring forth after its own kind this is the spoken word is the Original Seed that's what brother bradam is preaching from here that's what we're excuse me diving into here every seed will bring forth after his own kind and it has to be a church of the word and if it's not a church of the word we're going to bring forth a hybrid church and we'll just continue to have those hybrid members hybrid Believers and you know we can make different exceptions and say we'll do this and we'll do that there's Liberties that happen and before long you'll have exploding assembly you'll have lots of money it'll be flush with cash and everything will be fine and you know what you will have left the word yeah we're not interested in that right I personally would just like brother bradam said would rather have fewer members that really believe the word of God to see the dynamic power of God moving in our services when we know the Devil comes around and tries to take our children we can gather together and know there is a dynamic power of the Holy Ghost the only way it's going to happen is to be a virgin to the word and like we've said many times it's not a virgin in our flesh it's not a virgin Even in our our mind it's a virgin in our soul the only thing that we are interested in is the word of God Amen that's the only thing that we can take into our bodies is the word of God Amen brother bromy goes on to say in another paragraph here tell me where he ever said organize tell me where the head all say it's all right for women to cut their hair huh mention it it's not there tell me where the head ever said said these works I do but you shall not do them tell me that doesn't say it in the word of God does it tell me where it says in the word of God that you can have women preachers doesn't say that tell me in the word of God where it says you can have same-sex marriage it doesn't these are the days that we live in those things are condoned and and they're made to be all right but they're outside of the word of God so as soon as we step outside of the word of God what we have is a hybrid religion and at that point brothers and sisters anything goes it's not good but it's it's true mention it it's not there tell me where the head and we know the head is The Headstone crying Grace Grace unto it we know the head headstone is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we know that Jesus Christ was God himself manifest in the flesh came down to the world condescended so that he could come and save all that were his but he says mention it's not there tell me where the head ever said these works I do but you shall not do them tell me that you know brother Bram in this day he was talking probably to people who were saying you know the days of Miracles are passed died with the apostles age you know when when the apostles were gone then all of those Works were gone there's people that want to believe that and and we know there's many people who actually who believe in a trinitarian doctrine that believe that these Works they will do also and and they get Mighty results but it doesn't matter because any gift can be impersonated is what the prophet said that's what God Said through the prophet Satan can come around and impersonate any gift whether it's healing whe whether it's whatever it is but the one thing Satan cannot take is the word of God Amen but the head said this you want to put the scripture down I'll give it to you John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you also that's his body is what he says to the church that's his body it's not just him and I I think this is what gets me so excited you might wonder why brother Barry do you get so shouting and and get so excited because this is not about William marryam brandom yeah this is not about just Jesus Christ this is about the Bride of Jesus Christ this is about the Living Word of Jesus Christ alive and well in the bride body it's about us today see now why I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body why he's so zealous speaking only the truth why he's so zealous that he would step away take his his his membership card for the Baptist Church and say you know what if you want to allow women preachers I see that Paul said you're not supposed to allow women preachers but if that's what you want to do then you can take my credentials I'm not interested at all I'm interested in following the word of God because I had an angel messenger come and reveal a message to me amen yes that just like John the Baptist your ministry will forun amen the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ isn't it wonderful that he didn't actually give in that he did actually surrender himself see now I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real rain what does he mean by the real rain I'm not going to say what he means I could only imagine that he means the former and the latter rain falling together all of the rain falling together the Holy Ghost we sing that song Holy Spirit rain down my I mean the real rain and it's got to have seed to fall on amen amen he says I hope to live to see it it do you understand now if you're wondering where I'm getting this from I'll I'll tell you it's out of the spoken word is the Original Seed I think it's up there the spoken word is the Original Seed but if you were to type in pick up your pen and write this is where brother bradam he says in this message the spoken word is the Original Seed and in the pergami and church age we've been studying in the exposition of the seven Church ages on Wednesday but in the spoken word of the original seat is the only other place he picked up he talked about this pick up your pen and write and when he talks about it he says the the Lord Holy Spirit inspired me to pick up my pen and write and so I picked up my pen to write but then he goes on a a really big long way around explaining this that she's a virgin to his word that there is a headstone that the two are one before he comes to the place where he talks about pick up your pen and write and and this is what the message actually is to the church he finds a scriptural identification about this pick up your pen and write right see now why I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body only going to be a word seed only according to the word no deviation whether everyone walks away from him whether he gets kicked out of every single assembly and we know that's what it happened this was 1962 3 years later there was not many people that wanted to have him around right great oh my but then when he passed away there was all kinds of people around oh yeah yeah but this is why he says it this is why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body and I just can't help but zoom out and think was this William Mary and bradam saying these words we know that he's jealous over his bride with a Godly jealousy this is why I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body there was a time when I first started coming to church maybe for the first couple years that I thought man why why isn't there anything gentle it's always really deep and heavy it's it's it's it's mysterious and and and I know why now because I had a pastor that was on the word he knew that if he actually just milkfed the congregation that they would have an appetite just for milk and milk won't take you to a body change brothers and sisters it's got to be the revealed word amen it's got to be the right seed the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real R and it's got to have seed to fall on I hope I live to see it do you understand now it will be the Living Word as it was at the beginning the spoken word of God have his power for it is in him in his own body working his own way am that's why we don't have a will right we do but we humble ourselves we humble our will to his will amen the Believers always wants to subject themselves to the word of God and by doing so we actually humble ourselves we submit ourselves therefore unto God it gives us the ability to resist the devil then and he'll flee many times we hear that scripture just resist the devil and he'll flee we know we talked about it a long time ago if anybody has ever experienced it last summer we did we got close to a rattlesnake and and when you get close to a rattlesnake we know they can hurt you if they bite you but they make the rattle sound they're going to get you if you get close if you get too close he's going to strike you and and you know brother bam talks about it many times our Temptations can be like a rattlesnake they can be like a snake and we can just look at that snake we can hear it rattling and and and you know this snake is here and it's rattling maybe this stand here is a snake and it's rattling and it's coiled up and it's going to strike and I keep looking at it and I keep saying I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ maybe it's something in my life that I just don't seem to be able to get over maybe whatever it is our problems can be in life and we know they're wrong the Holy Spirit leads us and tells us I don't want to see you do that anymore but we keep looking at that problem and saying I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I keep looking at that problem I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ brother Bram says if we keep doing that that's what we're going to keep doing yeah but if you just go like this amen and you don't look at it anymore eventually when you start walking far enough away you won't even hear the rattle right you don't even have to rebuke it look the other way amen do something different brother bradam says if we've got a selfish streak in us if it's all about me and I he says do the Opposites force yourself to do the Opposites maybe if we're super Frugal and tight with our money and we just can't help the poor we just can't ever jar loose with our money brother bradam says just do the opposit and see if God won't come on the scene if if if we've got whatever it is just do the opposite don't let Satan have the power in our lives yeah out of the spoken words The Original Seed brother bam says and when you become not your own dot dot dot that's really the goal that's really the the place that I want to get to today brothers and sisters we got more Lord willing but when you become not your own as a husband when you become not your own you're actually the families you're actually in charge of the entire family all the children to make sure that when they come to church they're equipped for church to make sure that your wife is able to put groceries in the fridge to make sure that everything is happening in order when when you become not your own all of your Ambitions and your dreams you're willing to set aside to say I'm willing to not become my own I want to be the slave for my family now some people might say wow that's pretty heavy I ain't never going to be the slave for my family well don't be see what happens see how it works for you but I say when you do that when your family can see you're willing to give everything that you've got guess what's going to happen you're going to see a different garden growing in your patch it's going to be a different life for you but as long as there any me or I it's a problem yeah but boy I'll tell you when you are are willing and when you're become not your own and God knows no and fornew by knowledge who would take this gift and who would use it in the right way those who have it are Vindicated by the word of God with the rest of the word and spirit that clear you're Vindicated other people can see it yeah people experience it when they get around you other people are able to pull off of your tree gentleness oh my and they just want to be around you as they eat that fruit of gentleness and and and and peace oh my when they get around you there's just some kind of peace that passes all understanding they don't even understand it and you know many times we don't even understand it but there's something about the atmosphere in our life we have the fruit of the spirit for other people to enjoy it's not for us to enjoy if we're trying to enjoy the fruit on our own tree I think we've got something wrong now I say Lord forgive me if I've got that wrong but I believe he's been showing that to me and I think it's such a powerful Revelation it's not for us brother bradam said eternal life is what living for others the fruit on our tree ain't for us it's for others yeah but we'll be identified by the fruit that grows on our tree yeah that's right is so true those who have it are Vindicated by the word of God Amen and the rest of the word and spirit that clear some would have you believe it comes by schooling scholarship or degrees and I remember I encountered that couldn't be the pastor because I'm a novice sure but where where's the best schooling for this there's no scholarship to get in here that's right it comes some would have you believe that it comes by schooling scholarship or degrees I want to say if we have that that idea that theory it it's a denominational Theory yeah it's a denominational idea someone have you believe it comes by schooling scholarship or degrees if you go to school so long if you've been in the message so long if you've done something so long if you become a bishop study to be a pope or you become a cardinal or something like that some would have us believe that's where it comes from when a man by laying on of hands make you something to do it but they are off the word of God there's no man that can make you anything but what God's already made you gifts and callings are without repentance and if you have a gift and a calling you know what alls we need to do is actually pray that God would manifest that gift remember we said it he's the vine we're the branches and every branch that brings forth fruit he's going to purge it yeah amen but everyone that doesn't he said it it gets cut off it gets pruned and he Into the Fire where we're going today is understanding that it's at Thy word at Thy word amen we don't want to make it the centurion's word we don't want to make it brother bram's word we don't want to make it even Jesus word even though it is his word but we're talking about now the bride's word his word being on her lips yeah amen because we are his body brother bam says in the spoken words of the original see listen close now how different Jesus was in his days from the denominations of his day how different is he today from the denominations of our day from the denominations of his day they would point back to him how I'd like to hold on this a while phew they would point back over their shoulder back down through time and say we are moses' disciples we know that God appeared to Moses in the burning bush we know but I want to say this morning brothers and sisters has he appeared to you in the burning bush has he appeared to us in the pillar of fire because that Pillar of Fire that was taken over the head of William Mari and bradam that hangs in the in in Washington DC even today that picture where where Gordon Lacy I think it was maybe just Lacy he was the one that took took and identified the picture and certified it to be the only supernatural being captured on film we know that picture yeah that's the same same fire that Moses got to see in the burning bush amen it's not different he's the same yesterday today and forever but they would point back over their shoulder back down through the time and say we're Moses disciples we know that God appear to Moses in the burning bush and today we might say that we are William Mary and bram's disciples and that's good if we're truly William Mary and bram's disciples brothers and sisters then we're going to go all the way and get into Christ amen we're not just going to say I've got the books and tapes I know the message of the hour we're not just good behaviors we're going to go and follow his instruction he said if you can't take my word for it take his we know the story of elaser I don't want to get into preaching that today but elzer went to take a bride that's all and elzer got the bride to the groom and then eleazer disappeared right they know they know the history of Moses but they did not know the god of Moses cuz he stood before them in John 6 and said before Moses was before Abraham was I am the burning bush and they know Moses history so it is today they know God they claim they know the word of Christ but they don't know the God that was in Christ painted fire who can get warmed by a painted fire a seminary experience an idea that someone's been around the message long enough they'll be able to have the credentials to be able to do something that God's called them to do how can that be that's not the way it works it's a painted fire and who can get warmed by a painted fire a seminary experience they knowed Moses but not as God you know we we have the ability to go all the way and have the relationship with Jesus Christ ourselves why would we want to stop at a at a Sanctified position where we know that we're we're good enough we we've been set aside we've been Sanctified we've been washed out we were once in the ch chicken pen but now we're not we're put in the cupboard who wants to just be left in the cupboard what don't mean just left in the cupboard we want to actually be used Amen brother bam goes on to say in the spoken words The Original Seed and yet at 12 years old he confounded the scribes and the Pharisees oh my that spoke of it why why didn't they say something to him as a kid it was God's word and they couldn't withstand that at 12 years old Jesus in the temple withstanding the scribes and the Pharisees the religious ones no wonder the people were astonished at his Doctrine did you ever read that in Mark 1:22 if you want to put that down the people was astonished at his Doctrine because he taught like somebody that had Authority he know what he was talking about see the church now should have a double portion of the spirit right for it's true like Elijah's garment fell upon Elisha a double portion the same thing come from Jesus Christ but then what that portion went somewhere brothers and sisters don't think that it just went to William Mary and Bram just for him that portions for you that double portions for me yeah amen he says the same thing come now from Jesus Christ now you say oh brother Bram you're talking about his church that's right that's his body the church is supposed to be his body they're the ones that are supposed to be performing his word remember we said it in read it in in the spok in the in the perian church age she has thus saith the Lord she's not looking for it some people are still looking for it they don't understand that that's already happened the Baton has already been passed she just needs to say amen right but you know just like this Centurion here in Luke chapter 7 amen he was given the opportunity to see Jesus in fact when you read it I think in Matthew Jesus when he was asked to go I might have it wrong but I think it's in Matthew Jesus was asked to go and and see him just Matthew's account to the same instance when he was asked to go he said immediately I'll go yep let's go but we know that the Centurion he said to his servants no no no hold on a second I'm not worthy for you to come under my house I know what it means to be a man of authority and you're a busy guy and I don't want to interrupt your meetings I don't want to stop you from what you're doing I I just want you to speak the word if you could just speak one word to my direction to my situation for my problem that would change everything in my life just one word from you and you know it's gone from just asking like the Centurion was to now being told speak speak the word it's been given back to you you've got the checkbook and you've got the full bank account with all the money all you need to do is learn how to fill out the checks the bride's commission is to speak the word I'll call the musicians we're already at noon here at 12:00 the bride's commission brothers and sisters at Thy word at the word of the Bride the husband's will is accomplished yeah amen and she knows what he wants done with his word she does it and and she does it because she has the authority to do it the only way though is for our word to match his word when we want to speak the word and try and make it our own way our own will our own situation if it's not according to his word we're going to ask a miss and James talks about that we're going to ask to consume it upon the lust of our flesh our brother prayed about that earlier today we don't want to ask according to the lust of our flesh we want to ask according to the word of God knowing exactly who we are and where we stand you know maybe stand with me as we close today in 1964 in the tri I don't know if you got this quote or not brother Bram you can I I I'll just say I challenge you look that up in 1964 0419 as we close today this is out of the trial understanding that you know brothers and sisters the bride's commission is to speak the word not to be afraid not to call upon the Lord over and over and over again but to speak the word without fear knowing where we stand you able to find that I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man right now some people will say well this is this is just talking about William maryiam branam this is only about William Mar and Bram and others are going to see it maybe a little more personal than that I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh amen I'm just waiting I want I want to bring it up so right to throw a curveball at you I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man yes in human flesh amen through the bride's body yes accept his call amen amen we have God speaking to this generation through his Vindicated Prophet saying this I challenge you to believe it that he's here amen we know that he declared he's here I'm not declaring he's coming and and that he's gone brother brandom said it very clearly I am declaring that he is here and here we have in the trial in 1964 I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man now the son of man Ministry is that tiny little window that tiny little Ministry we've talked about it on the timeline we we all know about it but it is him being born in flesh yes that's why we get born again when we get born again it's the son of man Ministry am amen that's the son of man Ministry not through just William Mary and brand we just put it off onto the prophet then we're doing what he said we're putting it off to the Future looking back to another age but ignoring what he's doing right now this is where the dynamic power of the Lord Jesus Christ comes into the church brothers and sisters when we can take it and say that's mine that's for me be it unto me according to Thy word when we do that that's where we see the Dynamics come down on the mechanics I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body accept his call amen amen it's up to us to accept his call all we have to do is accept it and if we're willing to do that if we're willing to disel that's why his theme song was only believe not go and do remember it's not our job to try and make the word of God come to pass it's only our job to believe the word of God to allow him to bring it to pass amen Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit this is the fruit that we want to see on our tree because there's the world that's starving brothers and sisters and they're not starving for food there's more food everywhere all around the world right now than probably there's ever been and maybe there's some that would say there's a challenge for but many people in North America there's no challenge for food but we're talking about the food that is actually Eternal and and that that food that fruit that people is starving for where they're is a famine in the land that famine isn't for food it's for the word of God and and it's love and joy and peace those are the fruits we want to see hanging in our branches for our families for our brothers and sisters for our neighbors for our bosses for our co-workers for everyone around us the teachers at school we want to set that atmosphere that they can enjoy gentleness and goodness and faith and meekness and Temperance in our lives that's the measuring stick brothers and sisters that's how we know that we are actually heading the right direction cuz we can say Amen to the word I believe the word of God I believe the message of the hour all we want but can we live it because when we start living it that's the fruit that's hanging on our branches God bless you this morning let's just bow Heavenly Father Lord one more time we thank you for your goodness amen and your mercies to us Lord father we pray that you would just allow us to take the words that were spoken today and Lord just digest them Father sometimes they're they're hard sometimes they're a little crunchy or chewy father but Lord I pray that you would give us the ability to to to consume these words Lord that we would think about them that we would Ponder them in our lives Lord Jesus and see how this word applies to us personally in our lives Lord not looking around but just looking into the mirror of your word father I pray that your life would live out through each one today father that Lord if there's anybody here that has had the baptism of the Holy ghost and maybe just as a little bit dry in oil father I pray that you would just top them up with your spirit in the name of Jesus Christ father Lord we know that there was only one difference between the virgins five of them had oil enough to make it in to the bridegroom to rise and trim their lamps and five of them just lacked a little bit of oil all of them had oil all of them had lamps all of them were virgins all slumbered and slept oh father but only one group had just enough oil to get through father I pray that we would be that group that we would have enough oil in our lamps Lord that we would be able to heed the call from the bridegroom coming and father if there's anybody here today that has not truly enjoyed the baptism of your Holy Spirit father Lord I pray that in the name of Jesus Christ they would be able to go all the way Lord into you that you would Lord give them the desire give them the ability father to hum themselves to your word to go all the way and get into you father Lord we love you and we thank you we pray that you would be glorified in every area of Our Lives Lord father that you would just lead us and guide us that you would show us Lord uh the things that you want to see differently in our lives father that we would be willing to make
