certainly look forward to shaking your hand after service if you have your Bibles tonight thank you musicians I'd like to read a few scriptures but I'd just like to start with 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and I'd like to turn over to Hebrews chapter 9 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and Hebrews chapter 9 verse one of 2 Corinthians chapter 5 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Lord Jesus we thank you for your word because we know that heavens and earth will pass away but your word remains true and everlasting and father we're so thankful because we can read this scripture not just by Revelation but we can take it at face value Lord because we know that there is an Earthly Tabernacle there is an Earthly body there is an Earthly Temple father Lord that's not made by hands we we think about it in this world father and we love these lives that we have but father we know that one day one way or another we have to lay down these Earthly Tabernacles and father put on our Heavenly Tabernacles so father we just thank you for the promise that you've given us Lord and we just want to commit this service into your hands we pray that you would just bless the words that are spoken father that that it would just be an encouragement to us tonight that when we leave here we would just want to be that much closer to you father we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just want to remind us of a few um calendar events we have brother James nanab Bandy coming here on uh October the 1st Sunday October the 1st he'll take the morning service he's uh busy making his rounds in Canada now and uh he's certainly Making Tracks crisscrossing western Canada and uh starting October the 4th which will be a Wednesday we will begin a study of the exposition of the seven Church ages and uh as I've mentioned if anybody needs a a book or would like one by all means let me know and a few folks have taken me up on that and uh certainly looking forward to seeing what the Lord will do with that and I uh do believe that this is Sister Rosie's last service with us I thought that Sunday was and uh we're blessed to see her again but I do believe she's going back tomorrow so just keep sister Rosie in your prayers and her family it's been a bit of a struggle for her but we know that all things work together for the good to those who are called according to his purpose and we know that sister Rosie has a strong testimony of this message of the hour so God bless you Sister Rosie we'll certainly keep you in our prayers just wanted to mention that uh we were able to secure a gym for October 31st so we'll have a gym night on October 31st for those people who can or want to attend and participate it will be just a time of getting together and doing something together as believers so we'll have a few Sports Maybe and Just a time to get together so there's no pressure If you can come if you want to come we want to try and create an atmosphere and opportunity for the children to have a place to go to on Halloween night it's a terrible night in this world and I certainly don't miss the uh scenery that we see in the city when we lived in the area that we were in in Okat coses it just seemed to get worse and worse every sing single year where the the residents in the areas wanted to turn their yards into a graveyard and have as much sickness that they could possibly display and it's just acceptable now but it's interesting isn't it because once upon a time it was Christmas and people put Christmas decorations out like that everywhere and now it's just a manifestation of Halloween but I think it's interesting because we can look at it from the I would say the lens of Believers the ones who maybe can see what's going on in this world and understand the deceit that's actually taking place and recognize that there's really not a whole lot different between the two and that that could be really difficult for some to say or to hear but it's true Christmas is not what the world has set it up to be not at all and we have a prophet that brought it out very clearly that Christmas is a Roman Holiday and and uh we're not going to get into that very far but I know that Christmas isn't blood and gore and and and graveyards and and don't get me wrong what I'm talking about is the spirit behind both events the spirit behind and the commercialism that this world has made both of them that spirit is the same spirit and uh it's just wonderful to be able to have that understanding of really where we stand tonight I want to talk about uh a new spirit I want to talk about a new spirit I uh part of a Bible study and we got into this last night and I just I found it so incredibly fascinating I'll probably be into this for a little while but I don't think I've ever heard brother Bram talk about it this way and uh it just captivated me so we just trust that it will be a blessing to you tonight and uh we'll see what the Lord will do um are you happy tonight I'd like to talk about the Tabernacle just to start with and uh you know out of Hebrews chapter 9 I mentioned that we would go into that I just didn't want to keep you standing and read a bunch of scripture read a lot of scripture um but if you have that uh slide brother Logan if you wouldn't mind just putting it up there we have the uh the Tabernacle in the wilderness this is the Tabernacle that the children of Israel were commanded to build and there was very specific instructions for it and uh I just wanted to take a little bit of time and and talk about that before we really get into it tonight so from Hebrews chapter 9 verse 1 then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary and that would be on that slide if we could bring it back up that would be the first room inside that Tabernacle and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all and that would be the next room and that's where the Ark of the Covenant is the farthest left room that's the holy of holies verse four which had the gold sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubims of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly sorry verse 6 now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building I'm going to stop there and I just wanted to lay out just a little bit of a background about this what we're talking about is the Tabernacle but also a new spirit and the new Spirit how we all have to come to the place where we get a new spirit but I think it's a amazing thought I don't think I've ever heard brother bradam say it just because we get a new spirit it doesn't mean it's the holy spirit it's a very important thing to understand and myself I I I was just sort of like aha wow this this is this is something significant this is something that I need to I need to think about I need to talk about I just need to see what the Lord will do with it so bear with me tonight as we go um it's just a wonderful wonderful thing um out of John 2 ver1 17 and his disciples remembered that it was written I've got a lot of scriptures tonight so I'll probably just quickly read them and uh if you can bring them up that's great if you feel like turning maybe I should slow down John 2 verse1 17 I guess I get a little nervous and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up then answered the Jews and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up then said the Jews 46 years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in 3 days they were looking at it carnally and Jesus knew full well they were looking at it carnally that was the only way they had to look at it but he wasn't speaking carnally he was speaking spiritually but I think that he actually wanted them to look at it in a carnal way so that he could bring this out so that his disciples would understand it at a later time so that we would be able to read this scripture and understand it at a later date verse 21 says but he spake of the Temple of his body for the longest time I didn't even really understand that but the body that's not made with hands that's what we're talking about tonight I think it's so beautiful and you know that body not made with hands is created for a new spirit and it's not just for a new spirit to live there it's it's to change our spirit to a new spirit to get rid of the old man and change him into the new man and that is for a purpose brothers and sisters and that purpose this is kind of the the crescendo of it all is so that our spirit would be able to house his spirit because until we have a new spirit his Spirit doesn't even come in US it can't because he can't get along with our spirit he won't subject himself to our spirit that's why we have to guard ourselves as a temple as a tabernacle we talk about this building here being a temple and a tabernacle and we know that we heard brother bradam say it you know even a child running through the building can upset the holy spirit for the next meeting we reverence this building but do we reverence these buildings or do we watch whatever we watch and do whatever we do and and and go wherever we go and it's just okay we get influenced with whatever we get influenced with would we do that influence in here I just think if we wouldn't do it here how could we do it there and feel like it's okay because it's the same Spirit isn't it or is it I think it's beautiful it it's it's it's it's just it's just made it so clear to me out of out of the inner veil in 1956 brother bradam says God said in another place over in Ezekiel we'll we'll go and read that in a little bit he said I will in that day take out your old fleshy Stony heart and I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit in you sometimes I wonder whether I'm on the right track whether I should be going this way with a a service and is it is it what you want Lord am I just doing this on my own but then I I I I I try and put my thoughts together and Cobble it around and and and we come and we hear that song there's a fountain open in the House of David I I I just think it's amazing because it's just about exactly what we hear in Ezekiel right brother Ram goes on to say now a lot of people even you Pentecostal people a lot of times get mistaken in that you get a new spirit that's not God's spirit that one put me on the floor when I heard that that's you that isn't God says you get a little happy because you got a new spirit you jump up and down run around over the floor maybe and Shout a little bit now I don't know if anybody has ever done that maybe not but maybe had a real good feeling really felt like you connected with God and things are super good you leave the service and and and those temptations that you struggle with are twice as strong there's there's twice as much of the old you as there was when you were in that service I've encountered that many times and and I think my why is it I I can look at it and say you know it's because maybe he's still working on Me Maybe it's still just my spirit and maybe I just need to keep allowing myself to to have his Spirit manifest in my life but that's where I say brothers and sisters and we know this don't quit amen just keep pressing on there was one thing that brother brandham said they told him from the other side when he was over there beyond the curtain of time just keep pressing on just keep going to church go get Washed by the Water of the word don't stay home don't let anything turn you away that's the biggest trick of the devil is to get us separated from the body of Believers he can get us separated then he can really go to working on us us but when we come to church that spiritual Amnesia starts to wash away it starts to erode brother the brandom says maybe you get in the spirit and and jump up and down and run around over the floor maybe and Shout a little bit and speak with tongues even whoa how many of us speak with tongues manifest the the fruit of the spirit the gifts of the Spirit however we want to call it we know that brother bradam said it very clearly the initial evidence of the holy spirit is not speaking in tongues but here he he says it in this way that we could be speaking in tongues and running around and jumping up and down and and run around a little bit and think you got the Holy Ghost he says that's not it that's a new spirit God gave you he says that's not it that's a new spirit God gave you that's you this this made me take a double take on this then after he give you your spirit then he said I'll put my spirit that's what's the matter with the meal with the Mis meal cramps you got today and I think just looking at that I I think he's implying the people that fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray and and they still get nowhere with God he says that's what the matter what's the matter with the Mis meal cramps you got today that's right that's the reason you can't get nowhere with God he says notice you put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him it's a process brothers and sisters and I want to say thank you Lord because I know you're still working on me and that's why I this caught my attention ition it captivated me to think about it it it almost makes it a little bit tangible to see maybe the stages that we go through in our lives as human beings we're all fighting the same enemy we're not fighting one another we're fighting the same enemy and that is to be able to get to the place where we know that we've got his spirit because when we got his Spirit we're not going to labor the way that we used to with our own Spirit notice you put a a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that Old Devil Spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen I will put a new spirit in them and I will put my spirit in them he said after he's give you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you amen because you in your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband can't get along with your neighbor how you ever going to get get along with God so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him so he puts his puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his Spirit In You gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new Faith then he puts his holy spirit in you tonight brothers and sisters I definitely don't want any anybody to think that maybe you don't have the Holy Spirit by saying this what I'm saying is it's a process that we go through and sometimes we have got to go through some Muddy Waters we've got to Wade through the swamp and Satan's going to tell us that you've got the Holy Ghost when you don't when it's your spirit when it's your new spirit you've got to go further you can't stay there and Satan will come around and tell you that you don't got the Holy Ghost when you do when you do have the Holy Ghost but just remember it's a struggle that we all go through everybody has to go this way nobody comes unto the father except through the son except through the Holy Ghost you know we can nobody can call Jesus Lord except for having the Holy Ghost in their lives so I would say that's the word of God I know that's the word of God you do too if you can say that Jesus is Lord of your life and maybe things that happen in your life you don't like you're not proud of you always want to fix and repent Paul said I Die daily if that's what's happening then that's the right thing you've got the Holy Ghost don't let Satan say you don't but for some people I think it might be important to talk about this because we can get confused brother bradam says it in another quote here as we get going he says it that we can think that we've got the Holy Ghost but we just have a new spirit he talks in the message the lamb and the Dove and it's not a quote I'm bringing up I'm just going to talk a little bit about it so don't worry brother but in the lamb and the dove brother bam he he talks about it what if you know the lamb is being led by a a dove that's what needs to happen the lamb is always led by the dove brother Bram talks about and and the lamb is is like Jesus Jesus Spirit the life of Jesus Christ Living out through his children we have his Spirit we are Lambs of God as well and we have to to be led by the dove which is represented by the Holy Ghost and and and represented as the dove that's what brother Bram talks about in that message but what if that lamb suddenly turns around and snorts like a wolf at the dove or just in general he says the dove is timid the dove is just going to pull back and just go and set in a tree and just wait until that nature changes in that lamb sometimes as humans we can snort like a wolf even though we're a lamb and Satan will turn around and say yeah you are a wolf look at you you're a dog you're barking like an animal you can't get along with your neighbor but the believer will go and make it right in Hidden life with Christ 1956 talking about this this topic here brother bradam says now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and Full Gospel people have been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his Spirit that's your spirit then I will put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the Holy Spirit and this is where I think it's critical for us to just look at in our lives brothers and sisters and and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't pvy up to that now that's just a little raw but remember it's the truth I I'll just pause there and say it this way we know that there's the stages there's justification there's sanctification there there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost sometimes we can get caught up in one of those places or maybe we're just a little bit imbalanced one way or the other sometimes we'll just get stuck in in sanctification and I know when I was more of a junior Christian I was stuck in sanctification myself for a while and and what happens when that happens is we start to look at other people and we say well if they were a Believer they wouldn't do that well who's to say that how do we know that who are we to say that about anybody it's not up to us to judge it's up to God to judge sometimes we're given the ability to see things so that we can pray about them so that we can really make a change because if we see something that needs a change there's only one way we're going to make a change and that's to actually pray about it not to go and actually bring it to someone and try and change it ourselves that's not going to happen but that's what happens sometimes when folks get stuck in justification they want to justify their actions all the time they've got a justification for it or or sanctification we're pretty holy everything that we do is in a in a really specific holy Manner and uh no that's not the way a Believer is brother bradam said it very clearly that true Revelation never Puffs us up we never get puffed up by Revelation what happens is we get more compassionate we get more tolerant we get more willing to pray and intercede for our brothers and our sisters because truly we are our Brother's Keeper we are our Sister's Keeper he says and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't piffy up to that now that's just a little raw but remember it's the truth many people that spirit that new spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit Well some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with God if he' come in he says that's right sometimes we can be Our Own Worst Enemy brothers and sisters we can really be hard on ourselves just commit it to God just give it to the Lord take the time to die out to yourself and see if he won't come on the scene and change things he will he says that's right so doubtful and up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his Spirit when it comes amen I hope you see it and I want to say it tonight brothers and sisters I hope you see it we can't feed on the aarion of this world and think that we're going to actually have his Spirit we might have a new spirit but if we're feeding on the things of this world in whatever capacity or Avenue it is we're not feeding the holy hly spirit because the Holy Spirit only feeds on one thing the word of God period And I would say the word of God and the message of the hour because they're one and the same now that might be Blasphemous to say it but we've talked about that in the past but you know there's only one thing that's going to feed that Spirit if we want that new spirit to be in our lives to accommodate the Holy Spirit then we have got to feed on what the Holy Spirit feeds on and that's all and I say Lord help me I don't need to look at news feeds what do they do for me they do nothing for me they're Negative they bring me down what do you feed on is it videos is it games is it music is it news feeds or is it the word when we get spare time in our lives what are we doing are we are we spending it with the Lord oh or we spend it on ourselves I would say if we're eager to just go and blow our time on ourselves then that means we're actually feeding a new spirit but maybe not the Holy Spirit and you know I I just want to say this brothers and sisters what I'm talking about tonight isn't to discourage anyone I want to try and encourage us because the more we feed on the word of God the more we see his life live out through us the more we feed on the word of God and see his life live out through us the more successful we're going to be in our relationships the more successful we're going to be in understanding the word of God the more successful we're going to be in our business we're going to get into it a little bit later in some of these scriptures here he will bless us beyond measure if we're willing to feed him in our lives but but if we want to come contrary to his word then we're just going to stay stuck in that new spirit realm a and we're going to have a new spirit we'll be blessed God will bless us but we'll still have that that wolf snarl will come out every now and again it will still be there but boy oh boy when he comes into our lives he will actually push all of that out then we'll start to get along with ourselves and maybe our neighbors he says amen I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then puts his holy spirit in there Amen to dwell with you and abide with you cuz that that Tabernacle if we could go back to that that Tabernacle was a representation of the scripture we read in in 2 Corinthians tonight that Tabernacle has the outer court it's got the outer fence that would be this flesh right and then we have the the inner Court which is that first room where the the all of the instruments of worship are for the high priest all all of that is in there that's that's going to be the inside that'll be our new spirit but then there's the other court on the left side where the Ark of the Covenant is where the the word of God is the holy place is what it's called in the Bible we call it the holy of holies many times but that place would be that teeny little spot brother bradam talked about in the heart of a man that God created for himself only in human beings for himself the place for him to exist to live that is an example of our lives our bodies and you know brothers and sisters remember he's the same yesterday today and forever the high priest went in once a year to do service unto the go unto God and and when he went in there he couldn't just go in there willy-nilly he could not just go in there just just just full of all the thoughts of this world he had to go in there prayed up and prepared he had to go in there ready for service of the Lord so much so every single thing that he did when he walked he had to walk the walk that said holy holy holy art thou oh Lord we know that he had pomegranates tied to his his robe there's many different things we get into but the thing about it is the the point that I want to get to is he had a rope tied to his ankle excuse me brother there was a rope tied to his ankle and that was for the reason if he wasn't properly prepared entering into the holy of holies once a year then they would drag him out by that rope tied to his ankle because he was not ready to meet the Lord something was insufficient in his walk with the Lord if he's the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters what are we doing where are we at tonight are we actually walking that kind of a walk before the Lord because the word of God says that we are Kings and Priests so we have a sacrifice to offer unto the Lord we have a responsibility to the Lord God Almighty the same one right there that we would look at that they would worship and we know that that that whole entire building was wrapped in Badger skins and Badger skin is a representation of the human a really resilient really tough really nasty little creature doesn't die easy but boy once it dies it sure makes a nice Temple hey there's a reason why God chose Badger skins you know uh new spirit the the the the quote new spirit is mentioned 62 times in the message and brother brandham he says it early on in his in the message but then he he stops about it and I think it's a real interesting thing because I do believe there was a change in the ministration of his ministry and and and I think that perhaps it could have changed gears a little bit from the new spirit and I'm not going to say that this is the doctrine that you should hang your soul upon what I do want to do is just explore the thought of the new spirit I I think the idea of of understanding that we need a new spirit in our lives so that we will be able to get along with his spirit so that his spirit will be able to get along with our spirit to me it just for the first time in my life when I heard this I thought it makes just perfect sense he'll give us a new heart let's turn over to Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 11 start reading at verse 14 my goodness Ezekiel 11:14 again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man thy Brethren even thy Brethren the men of thy Kindred and all the house of Israel holy are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said get you far from the Lord unto us is this land given in our possession therefore say thus saith the Lord God those key words although I have cast them far off among the Heathen and although I have scattered them among the countries yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come I just couldn't help but think about all of the folks who have come here from many different countries all around the world wherever we find ourselves in the world he will be our Sanctuary this word is true verse 17 therefore say thus sayeth the Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel and they and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the Abominations thereof from then and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you you and I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and give them an heart of Flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and I will be their God I just can't help but think brothers and sisters that is just Rich that that scripture that he will do exactly what brother bradam was talking about he will take out that Stony heart that's in the heart of a human being that we're born with when we're born in sin shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies that heart has to go but once that heart goes there's a new spirit that he'll place within us and you know I'll be honest with you I kind of almost thought that new spirit was the Holy Spirit and this is what captivated me I've been corrected by the prophet to say no no that's not the Holy Spirit that's a new spirit that God will give you and that's so that you'll be able to get along with his holy spirit when he comes maybe it's just obvious and everyone else knew that I don't know but for me I just I guess it's inspiring to think it's exactly in line with the scripture here not that I would think anything that brother bradam wouldn't would say wouldn't be in line with the scripture I know it would be or he wouldn't say it and if he did say it and said it wrong then he would correct it but I I'm just telling you honestly I've been inspired by this really inspired to think that you'll just give us a new spirit but that's not the holy spirit so we need to be careful that we're we're willing to keep walking on and personally I think you know when when we see people if you look up new spirit you'll see brother bradam talks about why are people so tossed about why do people have find it so difficult to walk the Christian walk there's a few different messages in there maybe not tossed about that could be wrong um I could look it up for you right now but if you look it up you'll see what I mean he talks about it on those lines Why is it so difficult for people to walk the Christian walk and I think it just summarized is real nice because he talks about the new spirit in that one message very specifically and if we just get stuck thinking that we've got the Holy Spirit when we just have a new spirit to get along with the Holy Spirit when it comes what happens is Satan knows that and he'll come around and he'll throw as many banana peels and traps in our way as he can and we'll be up today and down tomorrow and up tomorrow and down the next day and up and down and up and down and we'll live this Christian Life and we'll wonder why can't we ever get the victory but if we could take a step wordss back and say what do we feed our lives on what are we feeding on if we can recognize the diet that we try and live on we'll be able to change ourselves we'll be able to take that next step and stop being stuck in sanctification stop being stuck in the position where we just have a new spirit and get on with things and get the holy spirit because without the Holy Spirit we're going to stay here on this Earth we're going to miss the general resurrection and Rapture that's why we harp on it it's that important it's important it's important for our lives it's important for our our families it's important for our children it's important for our church it it is the only thing to talk about just like Noah had only one thing to talk about it's going to rain and people said no it's going to be sunny you know I can look up the weather app I I can see it's going to be sunny tomorrow and the next day and I can click 14 days out and I can see look it's good you know and and back then they might have had even more technology and they'll just click six months out and say you know we can see it's not going to rain forecast is sunshine what are you talking about your crazy crank right that's what we're talking about the same thing people say it we we are crazy and we know it the way in which you call heresy that's how we worship that's what we believe we say the word that the prophet said some people would say oh you parot the prophet amen there's nothing else to say that's yay and amen that's the word of God thus saith the Lord God Almighty that's what that is but I just think tonight brothers and sisters don't get stuck with just a new spirit he'll give you a new spirit but we got to go on to that next stage we got to go on to the Holy Spirit the baptism of of the Holy Spirit and and and don't don't don't be discouraged by what I'm saying tonight I just want to make sure that we can just shake Our Lives take inventory and make sure that we know that we know that we know if Satan's coming around and giving us troubles then uh maybe we're just in that one spot and and and we just need to go a little further you know that God will allow that to happen in our lives he'll allow troubles to come our way not to crush us not to destroy us but to push us but the one thing that he won't do is push us all the way he'll get us to the position where we will be able to have the conscious decision in our lives where we decide to go forwards or we decide to step back and if we decide to step back that's where we start to shrivel up and die but boy when we step forwards brothers and sisters many times people will say look at that fanatic oh my shouting and service why is he worshiping like that what's wrong with the guy why can't I I I remember the first time I came to church brother boner was here and he kept saying amen amen and I was like come on guy I can't even hear the preacher what are you doing but then something happened to me somewhere along the way and I started saying amen and people probably thought what's wrong with that guy something happens you can't help it when it's the word of God something inside of you says amen just like when you recognize oh we have the opportunity to worship God I can actually express my voice I can close my eyes I can forget about everyone around me and I can just have that visualization of what it's like in heaven right now this moment right now and and that God can hear my voice and how he's probably saying hold on a second hold on a second there's a group of people down in Calgary Alberta and they're worshiping have you heard them worship listen to them worship probably doing that in heaven I don't want to come to a worship service and just be like I'm so glad that I can say one of who really if that's how you sing it who are you what Spirit have you got but when you can say hey I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them redeemed people that he knew from before the foundation of the world that would be here in Calgary Alberta Canada to say Amen to the word of God my Hallelujah a new spirit he'll place a new spirit within you and then he'll give you a new heart and I can't help but think brothers and sisters that new heart isn't your heart it ain't my heart it's not the heart of a church it's the oh my it's the very Heart Of God it is the Holy Ghost himself coming and living taking up his abod in that Tabernacle not made with hands my cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have trans transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die oh House of Israel for I have no pleasure in death of him that dieth saith the Lord God wherefore turn yourselves and live ye that is the Lord God speaking my goodness that's Ezekiel 18:31 and 32 Ezekiel 3622 and 29 we're running out of time here so I'm just going to Boogie he says therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not this for your sakes this is where it gets heavy this is where it turns into election I do not this for your sakes I do not this for your sakes oh House of Israel but for mine holy name's sake which ye have profaned among the Heathen with ye went and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you before their eyes not going to destroy us he's going to show the world himself how is he going to show the world himself it's not going to be a 60-foot Jesus floating down through the clouds it's going to be in you he's going to sanctify himself in you for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of the countries and will bring you into your own land that's the Holy Ghost the promised land brothers and sisters that I will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when Satan comes around read him this scripture read him this scripture and tell them you fell oh my and many times I feel like I fell but look at what he's going to do in me he's going to do this in me that's his word and you know Satan knows his word he knows his word and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God he's doing it all Oh my Jesus Paid It All I will also save you from your uncleanness oh my I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine unto you he's going to do it all brothers and sisters if we can just push aside all of the cares of this life all of the filthiness all the profane all the idols anything that we would put before the Lord just push it aside brothers and sisters give him the preeminence give him a little bit more don't try and do anything too traumatic but just take another step towards him is all I'm trying to say tonight just give him a little bit more and see if he won't increase your borders and and he'll do it all he said he'll give you increase the corn he'll give you money he'll give you houses he'll do all of that but what about the spiritual walk when the time comes to be able to come and worship the lord god wow the infallible word of God 1956 he says just like I've always said about love there's two different kinds of Love do you believe that some people gets them mixed up like some people being borned of the Holy Spirit they get mixed up in that new spirit that Jeremiah said that God said in the last days I'll write my spirit upon their hearts I'll write my law in their hearts brothers and sisters what will happen if and when a day comes and the Bride of Jesus Christ is still here and they take away all our Bibles they take away all of our devices they take away all of our ability to to listen and and and to read is that word going to be gone they can't touch it that's why we have this freedom to absorb this word to feed on this word I'm preaching to myself just as hard and as much tonight brothers and sisters we can take this word and eat it up and it will be in our bellies we will become this word we will not just read this word and and look at it but we will be this word I will write my law in their hearts and will give them a new spirit and then he said I'll give them my spirit and many people get the new spirit well you have to get will you have to have the new spirit you can't get along with your neighbor let alone with God see so you have to have a new spirit before you can get along with the Holy Spirit sometimes when you get the new spirit you think then that you've got the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's the new spirit the holy spirit will witness Jesus Christ but if you just joined Church went up and knew that you should do right that's just a new spirit and I'll say it tonight brothers and sisters if we say that we just join church and just believe that God sent a prophet but we don't go and do what that Prophet said we might just have a new spirit that's all because anybody can say God sent a prophet that's good that's real good it's wonderful because he did but can we do what that Prophet said that is where the rubber meets the road that's the brass tax and you know what to be just a little bit off a little teeny bit off of what that word from the prophet said is going to be terrible at its destination and it's so tragic because we can look at it here in this day and age in which we live in and see the results of it where people have done that with their children they have been just a little bit off with this message of the hour it's okay you don't have to go to church on Wednesdays you don't have to go to communion you you you know we we can listen to tapes and and just be as strong can you will those children stand when that day comes for them to make their decisions we can see the fruits of it he says that's just a new Spirit a spirit God gave you and it's wonderful isn't it because he doesn't say the devil gave you and your church gave you God gave it but there's more that God wants to give you isn't it beautiful to think that he gives it to us we just need to keep walking and not give up just keep going and wait for the rest of it that's a spirit God gave you but not his spirit yet see you've come into Christ by the Holy Spirit baptism 1 Corinthians 13 says by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body spiritual baptism into the body of Christ then you're SEC secured with Christ he doesn't amputate any arms legs or eyes or anything of his body he's perfect I just think that's beautiful that'd be another fridge quote right there he doesn't amputate any part of his body he keeps it he he just loves it all he loves every single part of his body doesn't he the little toe to the the the hair and the nose he loves the whole body every single part of the body is necessary brothers and sisters 2 Corinthians 3 we still got four minutes I'll call the musicians though just so I don't overreach I know it's Wednesday and we're weary 2 Corinthians 3 ver vers one do we begin begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commodation from you ye are our Epistles our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but by the spirit Spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life that's where I want to say brothers and sisters if we're wondering where we're at tonight do we have a new spirit do we have the Holy Spirit Christ himself that that new heart that he would give us how are we living are we living by the [Music] letter are we legalists or are we living by the spirit trusting in the Lord trusting in his word I believe that is the differentiating factor Jesus never got upset except for those people who were the most Pious religious individuals the ones that he said they were of their father the devil the most religious people of the day those are the only ones that he got upset with isn't that right everyone else the Sinners the ones that all of the most religious people were getting upset with those are the ones that he had compassion for so where are we at tonight how are we living our lives do we just have a new spirit or do we have a holy spirit my I just want to read that scripture that we just read there's still 2 minutes out of the Amplified Bible verse one says says are we starting to commend ourselves again or or we do not like some false teachers need written credentials or letters of recommendation to you or from you do we no you yourselves are our letter of recommendation our credentials written in your hearts to be known perceived recognized and read by everybody whether we know it or not we are written Epistles read of all men we don't really even have to talk and people know verse three says you show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us not written with ink but by the spirit of the Living God not on tables of stone but on tables of human hearts such is the Reliance and confidence that we have through Christ toward and with reference to God not that we are fit qualified sufficient inability of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God it is he who has qualified US making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient as ministers and dispensers of a New Covenant of Salvation through Christ not Ministers of the letter of a legally written code but of the spirit for the code of the law kills but the holy spirit makes alive maybe stand with me tonight as we [Music] close we're looking for something brothers and sisters and I just want to close with this scripture here tonight we're looking for a body fitly joined together out of a Ephesians 4:14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive if we've got any other motive than getting the Holy Ghost in our lives and encouraging other people to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then I believe that verse that we just read speaks to who we are and where we're at any other motive than getting the Holy Ghost In Our Day verse 15 says but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love in love [Music] Philippians 4 and the peace of God which pass this passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest just pure lovely good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do Paul's speaking here and the God of Peace shall be with you don't get caught up in carnal thinking about all these other things get caught up in thinking about all of those things when Satan comes around and says did you know that so and so did this and and and I can't believe that the way they treated you and all of that nonsense starts happening start quoting that scripture because that scripture is how we're going to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked if you want to know how to do that anyways God richly bless you tonight take courage brothers and sisters don't stay stuck with a new spirit get the Holy Spirit let's bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're so thankful f for your word I thank you for the encouragement that you've given me I thank you for Lord explaining it to me in such a a tangible way that I can see it father and that gives me the encouragement to preach it and Lord I love it when you just come and and you just say that's right
