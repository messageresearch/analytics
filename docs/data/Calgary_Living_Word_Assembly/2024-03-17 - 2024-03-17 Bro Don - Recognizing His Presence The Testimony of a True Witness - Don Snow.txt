roaring Lon seeking who he may devour and Lord Jesus we know last night he came after one of yours and we're so thankful that we can just Praise You Lord Jesus as we heard in that special that wonderful special this morning Lord we will praise you and when we're done we'll do it again Lord Jesus that's our desire is to give you praise and glory father not to just continually beg you and

just want to uphold brother ger rald in Germany Lord Jesus and the family there in the congregation Lord father many times we don't understand with our human Minds oh Father why you would take a child Home Father oh why you would take anyone home Lord Jesus but we know nothing happens by accident to a Believer and father we just want to stand with our brother that you would Lord Jesus be his comfort Lord that you would comfort him and his wife Lord and the rest of the family and the congregation Lord Jesus father that they would all just know you in a greater way Lord father we want to

have the the ladies brunch happening on the 23rd we have Brother David Dean har will be here for the Easter meetings March 29th 30th and 31st we have brother Nestor espania from Philippines here April 20th and 21st we have brother Andrew Glover he will also be here in August and this morning we have a very special guest Brother Don snow is going to take the service I just felt extremely impressed on Wednesday to invite our brother to do so we've been talking about him ministering and he's given his witness his testimony a few times but I believe the Lord has put a burden on his heart to preach and you know what I learned early on my pastor taught me is to Simply give the man an opportunity and and it will either come forward or it won't if there's a gift there it will manifest and remember brothers and sisters it's not up to the brother it's up to us we activate the gift whether it's in the worship or whether it's in the preaching of the word it's up to us so if we go to PO in he'll go to preaching and the Lord will do whatever he wants done this morning if we could just sing that song Here's my cup Lord I I lift it up just as we sang if you have a need this morning he's more than able and alls we need to do is be willing to receive it from him and he certainly will pour it out to [Music] us here's my cup Lord I lifted up Lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul bre of [Music] Heaven still I want no more here's [Music] my sing it again please I it [Music] amen only you can [Music] father my soul [Music] amen oh Father desire we have need of it [Music] [Applause] more amen Am Lord bless you all please be patient with me today amen I'm just a humble dink desired to serve the local body I've always been inspired by the book of Acts and Steven and he stood one day full of faith and Power in the face of an Angel and begin to talk about who we knew he was yes so under that anointing today I pray the Lord visits [Music] us guess we should start with reading your word in our Bible if you can turn to John 14 musicians John 14 20-23 you say Amen when we get there amen this is the word of the Lord amen at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you amen hallelujah he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father amen and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen Judas saith unto him not as scariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and Jesus answers again and he says onto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him amen and we will come unto him and make our Abode with himen man let's just bow on word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've gathered together Lord in your name father we come because we have a desire to be fed of you father to be drawn closer to you Amen to better understand you and our relationship to you father so that we can stand in this world Lord knowing that you promised that you right here in this scripture Lord that we would know that is our desire father you just desire to lift you up we desire to step aside Lord and allow you to have your way father and Lord if we were to add anything that should not be added Lord may you close our mouths father Yes Lord we just desire to speak about you in your written word your revealed word and Lord give a testimony of you living out your body Lord yes may you bless this reading bless this assembly bless me father I pray amen amen you may be seated amen amen the Lord's good I trust you all had a good week probably a little bit of a surprise today uh I just want you to know I just have a real desire to serve the Lord and in doing that that means I have a desire to serve the Lord's body and he said if you love me people will know you love me because you love my body and I have a sincere love for this body here actually for a year I struggled and I'm pretty sure brother Barry must have been kind of confused one week I'd be up and I'd be like you know I think I feel led to be a deacon and the next week I'd be like no I'm moving back to Ontario and it was a whole year of struggling with that and praying and looking for the leadership of the Lord and then the Lord just said in our heart that this is where we're meant to be so we're not here of our own fruition we're here because we believe we've been LED of God to be here and Satan tries to attack that sometimes yes he does but then we just stand and say Lord we've we're just here serving you based on what you've asked us to do in our heart amen so I'd like to just fellowship with you today around the word like I said we'll talk about the written word and the the revealed word but I really want to talk about the living word amen at some point this has to come off the page and be manifested in their lives amen amen yes the title if you want to put a title on it it's called recognizing his presence it seems like such a simple thing but there's been very few people in time that's actually been able to recognize his presence right and I guess as a subtext it's the test testimony of a true witness and we're all called to be Witnesses and in reading this and going through different messages brother Brandon preached a message called the trial and he talks about that the word of God has been put on trial for you know the promise of God not being true and he he sets up this whole display because he had actually just fellowshipped with a lawyer and this message came on his heart and he about the courtroom and the prosecutor was Satan and he would told his three Witnesses and three Witnesses he named them it was Mr doubt or Mr unbelief then there was Mr skepticism and the Mr impatient and I think at some point in all of our Lives we've been guilty of maybe succumbing to that a little bit but God has always nudges us and it's it's normal it's okay it's a part of the process but then he calls and he says the Holy Ghost defends his word and he calls his Witnesses and he talks about all the Patriarchs and he brings it right down to William Mary and brandom and then now we have to put ourselves in there yeah we have to give testimony of the word not just word and a prophet the word the personal relationship we have amen hallelujah I'd like to just read two more scripture and I want the the main point is is when we read these scriptures Satan tries to use our imagination to make these things sound so out there and so fantastic and like 50 put Jesus when he came they missed him the first time because they had a totally different idea of what it would be CU Satan uses our imagination and in here he made a bunch of promises and he says you know at that day and the day we know is the day of redemption and brother brandham said that's the time from when he steps forwards and takes the book until we receive our body change that's the day that we're we're living in and then he goes on you know like you will know and you'll see everything that we talk about here today is about this knowing this knowing do we truly know and knowing is when you hear and you can see you recognize and some it's so simple brother Brown tried to teach it over and over again that it's just so simple God hiding in Simplicity and revealing self in the same and I've been guilty of many times I look back now on my life and God has been there now I look back I can see but when I was in that moment I couldn't see it I didn't recognize that it was God okay so I'm just going to read uh Romans 8:28 here and he says and we know there it is again the knowing we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and he just said back in the previous scripture those that have my commandments so you that is also message or word and we've received the full word of God today so we have do you believe you have the Commandments of God Amen and he says them that keep them okay sorry better okay and I mean we might check ourselves and you know I I keep some of the word sometimes kind but no you actually keep if you're a true Son of God you keep the word you might stumble and fall but God comes long and nudging reminder and then you you line up with the word that's the Walk of a Believer so it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen do you believe you're called to his purpose today so he said all things all things we're going to hit on that because there's a lot of times we don't feel like it's the blessing of God right amen because there's this duality of the natural mind versus spiritual understanding right but he told us and if you say you can amen that then we're going to look into it and I hope you can still amen it at the end of the service today but he said all things and I'm so thankful for that amen and then in 1 John 31-8 you you don't have the turn there they might bring it up says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us sir and that's normally that bestowing is through an experience should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen beloved now we are the sons or the children of God and I've always wondered about that like now what do you mean now actually brother Bram taught us that you are always a Son of God so any time in your life even if you were a sinner in the world and you read that you were a Son of God you just didn't understand it yet right so that always puzzled me what do you mean now is there a certain time and it's it says now because it's anytime you always were he did he just he didn't make us Sons we just become placed as Sons right amen yes and it does not yet appear or made visible what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is shall see him now what does that mean what do you mean I'm going to see you is it is corporal body is a I believe it's we're going to see them in our brothers and sisters in our own life because that is the second coming of Christ and we'll we'll go into the revealed word and talk about that and bring it out but it's we said we shall see him and I'm going to ask you do you see him today do you see him and where do you see him amen and every man hath this hope in him they Pur pures himself which means wash away himself even as he is pure amen whosoever committeth sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and ye know that he was manifest to take away the sins of the world and no and in him is no sin whosoever abideth or keep going or continue on and we know that's the struggle as some Satan tries to think we're saved one day and lost the other but if you're able to continue on or abide in him sinth not whosoever sinth hath not seen him so there's this Duality now of seeing him versus unseeing him and whether or not you sin neither know him little children let no man deceive you he that and this is the key to not being deceived he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he may destroy the works of the devil I do want to go into that because brother brandham said that's what he did in his first coming and there's a quote I have he says that's what he does in his second coming in us and it's like what does that what does that mean that he's going to destroy the works of the devil amen but also taking into consideration all things work together for the good amen amen so I just want to read a quote here and just keep in mind about God taught us through William Bram that Up Is Down down he taught us that God's ways are far beyond man's ways right and that perfect weakness equals perfect strength amen so there's I just want I want to stand here today there's this quote uh that brother branom gives us and it says now a testimony before a person has a person has to have an experience before they can testify yeah if you were called in court you'd have to as give a testimony you have to know something something before you can testify that's right and a witness is a person who has seen something that knows that it is the truth and they are called to give witness and then a witness must know what he is talking about he must not be someone told me a certain certain thing now that statement right there the thought is we can't just par it while brother brandham said we have to have the same experience okay amen there's a time for that and it's a part of the growth process but I'm not here today just living off William bram's experience I've met the god of William Brown amen says he must be the witness himself or herself if not he is speaking of someone else that could be a witness on the scene so amen like so where you stand here today and I was looking it up and the just the the percentage like there's 25% of the world is Muslim and then it was uh 15.7 million were Jews and uh only half of that was actually in Israel and then the Believers it says that there's about two to four million Believers so I take the average three and I divide it by 8 billion that means that there's a 0.375% chance of you even sitting here today and claiming to be a witness of the Living God like that just blew me away right and he even said that a that group there there will be a group that goes into the bride into the Rapture amen so like I said I just want to Fellowship around the written word the revealed word and then talk about an experience that really really made me come to know who I am in God and we're going to talk a little bit about godhead and maybe even marriage and divorce but it's it's an experience that I want want to talk about amen uh there's this quote here and it's out of the spoken words The Original Seed okay and this is going to sound really deep but I want you to remember that that sometimes is just our imagination and we make things seem bigger than it really is now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind Genesis 1:11 these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race as the nears the great headstone they will be much like him so much like him even they will be in his very image Amen in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God am do you believe that do you feel super today like when I think see like we watched cartoons and things that when we were kids and we're led to think now it leads us down this path of Superman and things like that but what does that really mean what does it mean to be a super race and a super church and to manifest the word of God it's just a tremendous statement when you stop and think and I know all these scriptures and quotes that we're going to talk about they're all well known to us but sometimes we just need to stop and meditate them and say Lord what does this really mean amen and can I expect it in my life and then it creates a desire in you and then you go about trying it says with all diligence and Dil means thr you throw everything that you have that you know how to serve God to try and make it come to pass and you know what happens you fall flat on your face amen but that's how God does things and then you try again and try again finally you get to realize I can't make this work amen and you get desperate and then you cry out to God and then God comes on the scene amen we've seen it we can all testify and witness of it but it's for a purpose and we Overlook it we make it sound so simple but it's the literal The Living Word in our day the very manifestation of God Amen and here comes the battle so here's out of the church ages the re uh revelation of Jesus Christ and it's Satan he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army do you feel like an invincible Army today but you are the word of God says you are there's certain manifestations of it and we'll talk about it if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church so now we can take that and we know there's a body but then he also said the individuals a temple and a church amen so honestly you you need to get a revelation of that the two Spirits actually can work within you yes and you need to be aware of it and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen that is the the word of God now the question is it's it sounds so out there it sounds too too much to even comprehend with your mind and you can't comprehend that with your mind you can't it's got to be a revelation in your heart but he keeps saying over and over again the true Revelation the true church and and the true thing and brother brandham taught us that true is not in stark contrast to false so in this world Satan tries to teach us that this is true and that all the way over here is false but brother Bram taught us that that's true right here and this is false amen one word off so how how can we even go about living that you need his life in you like he promised amen another quote and like I said I I want to go through these quotes and then we'll talk about the experience another quote here just to back up the point and it's from the spoken words Original Seed now Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe thaten now I can't explain all this I'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high place so you won't stay too long Christ was manifested destroy the works of the devil is that right congregation says amen you all believe that that's why he why what was he God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil so the mixing the one the one word Satan is a master at at doing and actually before I gave to my heart to the Lord I was a liar and I learned that at a young age you could mix as long as 99% true not lying to my parents lying to everyone around around me it was actually a spirit that came down through my grandfather I got real close to him and I used to ask him and I I gravitate towards old people and I asked them you know if you could go back to yourself when you're 18 whatever age I was at the time I said what would you tell yourself what would you do and I would get their advice of what they would and I said you know what what is your struggle in life what is it that's the thorn in your flesh and my grandfather who's passed on he says two things he goes I always had a to resist stealing he he had to steal at that at some point to actually feed his 13 kids and he said lying so then I thought okay like okay maybe that's where I get it because I was a liar and even still sometimes I have to fight against that it's so easy to sit there and just tell a little white lie in that but it's still a lie right amen now where was I uh Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that amen so con congregation says all you believe that that's why and then he says the hybrid the devil is that right he was he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same Amen to destroy the works or the acts of the devil because the body is head and body is together that's right if Christ was the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as head was that's right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational virgin born from the word amen the way the body operates is by the head that's right so you have to be United with this mind of Christ and you're going to operate I looked up the word operate and it means to perform a function or exert power or influence to produce an appropriate effect amen and if we look back at Christ even though he was God Of Heaven and Earth he came down in the form of a man he humbled himself and he sacrificed himself and he served that was the mind of Christ and so many times we go we want to read about the mind of Christ and say yeah he was all powerful but it goes he went and he gave himself and we are to reflect that and we try and do that in our own ability but we can't amen but when the Holy Ghost comes it's the first thing you want to do hallelujah amen sometimes and this is what happened to me is you'll sacrifice to serve the local body but you neglect your own family amen we'll get into that but God is gracious and God is good amen so one more quote here and it's from Christ is the mystery of God revealed says look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do this is the Revelation this is what he's trying to get into us and how he does it is through trials and tribulations and we'll get into it what is the new birth then you'd say well brother Bram what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to [Music] you once you experience that everything changes Hallelujah you look at the written word differently you look at the revealed word differently you look at your brothers differently you look at yourself differently the whole godhead changes you finally get the true revelation of the godhead and you are a part of him you can't lift yourself up there amen amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed and promis to live by a code of rules and so many people have made this message m a code of rules and a code of way the live legalism us Lord but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you amen and no matter what anybody else says what takes place it's Christ amen Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon amen thank you Lord amen it's Amen it sounds so big and grander and it's just so simple so simple brother bradam saw God everywhere in nature everywhere you did he did even his own enemies he looked to see at least what common ground do we have what part of the word can I at least agree with them and fellowship on when I first gave my heart to the Lord when I was 18 19 years old I was baptized excuse me and Sanctified and I had a real desire to serve God with all my heart and I loved them and I studied and I did everything but it was still that mental Faith space that we all go through and I couldn't understand I wanted to be perfect I wanted to reflect God in my life life and I would constantly stumble and fall at certain things not understanding you not having the wisdom and understanding true Grace so one day I'd be up one day I'd be down in and out and I'd build all my faith based on my ability to keep God's word and when I'd fail I it would just knock me right back down to ground zero and then you'd start all over again so then I got a critical spirit on me and I started only seeing the worst in people my own brothers and sisters in the church to justify my oh look oh look what they're wearing how could they wear that dress how could they do that how could they do that Lord and it got to the point where I couldn't even go to church because there were such condemnation in my heart but that was God's grace to me but I didn't understand it at that time but all things work together for them that love God so I ran away from church I stopped going I couldn't go in through those doors I was still a Son of God and I knew that I wasn't right but because of Pride and ego and I was still young in the Lord so I stopped going to church and it's amazing that says the first thing Satan tries to get you to do is separate yourself right amen if you ever Satan tries to get you to separate yourself do the opposite don't go down the road I went 15 years backsliding assemble yourself go to your pastor talk to them expose it says resist it God has a way amen but I got a real critical spirit I ran away and then it got to the point where I couldn't even go pump gas or get groceries I'd bump into a Believer and then there that condom that just a very presence and knowing what they stood for right and knowing that I couldn't told that line so then I ran away at West I tried to say that it was because I wanted to come and make money to provide for my family but really it was I just didn't want to be around that present cuz that brought such condemnation to me Amen in those 15 years of being out here the woman that I love that God gave to me brother bram's wife was specially made for him and my wife is specially made for me your wife is specially made for you amen if you married her based on Revelation she is you your flesh and and bone of each other amen Amen brother Satan tries to get us to divorce that part of ourselves and the true Revelation is you actually have to divorce the old man nature that's actually creating that confence we get into that more I didn't know I'd get into it this early but that's the revelation of it there's we want to kill the old man and we desire to do it but it's not lying in our ability it's got ACC come at the right time by the word and be done correctly and that's the amazing thing of it is we get a desire to do things just like Abraham Abraham met God after the great trial he was there and lot left them and he was left with the the dry piece of land he tilled away and tilled Away brother Bram says that he met Elohim underneath the oak tree after that great trial and then he was given the promise that your son and what's the first thing Abraham did took it and mixed it and he made a hybrid ishmail and we've all I've produced ish mailes in my life spiritually we all have it's just a part of the the process Abraham is the father of faith and we reflect the same on fortunately in us but it's all to God's will and his purpose says no matter what anyone says he says now this is talking about the godhead now you're actually seeing that you and God are one that you're his son amen despite all the corruption and that's the amazing thing like you look back through time and it's I want to say that God has a sense of humor and we know he does the prophet says he does but like Moses Moses was for ordained to be the mouthpiece of God but he have speech impediment he stuttered because God wants you to see that it's him right so then we go and brother was able to take this idea and he said that I mean who in the world ever thought that Samson was a dwarf but he was able to look at how God does things so while he was a mighty Minister then he must have been a dwarf amen here we are again we take brother Brown no education but brought the greatest Ministry the world's ever seen there with Paul him and Paul but he was an uneducated Backwoods there it is again God's just not sharing his glory with anyone but showing hey I'm going to do this now what about you yeah amen he said that you're perfect virtuous spotless Hallelujah meanwhile you have all this corruption moving within your members but that's who you are it's him in you isn't that just amazing that you're weaknesses are there so that God can express himself amen right so amen you just got to overcome them by the word approach them according to the word and we desire I know we all do it's the same of me like Lord I don't want this I don't want this I don't want this and he just says I'm going to take care of it in due time amen just keep moving forward you got to grow up there's a process amen amen there's uh something that's always amazed me and brother brandham talked about this so many times almost every almost every sermon he gave he talked about the woman at the well Samaritan and it just seems so innocent here he was talking at the well give me a water and everything and uh let's read it I'll I'll turn there maybe I'll get settled down a little bit I'm really a little bit nervous I'll I'll read it it says John 14: 21-26 Jesus said onto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at is at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvations of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth amen the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah or Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus sayith unto her it's I that speak unto thee am he amen seems so simple but when we read other things it seems like it's so Grand brother Bram I'll read a quote here but this was actually the second the first coming this was the start of it amen now if we take this and we compare it to Nicodemus and it's in John 313 and it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night so see how he approached God in the shadows and by night didn't really want to be to be seen and in the other one Jesus saw her he said I actually have to go by this way for a purpose see the difference it's brother around said no man ever ever seek God it's God seeking his amen came to him by night and said unto him Rabbi see the difference he recognized him as Rabbi she called him Messiah see the difference and we're talking about recognizing presence of God Amen we know that thou art a teacher from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him wasn't just with him he was God that's when she called him Messiah she re you are God Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God kingdom of God was standing right there in front of him right there his whole life was devoted to the scriptures amen and the very thing that they served and believe said they believ was standing and they didn't even recognize him amen and here's an ill- famed woman Glory by well do you see yourself in her yes sir Hallelujah just doing her daily routine and he comes by yes sir and she recognized him in the most mundane thing and the recognize means you had an affiliation before that's right she was for ored hallelujah amen hallelujah amen now you just come be he's bringing back to our remembrance so I'll read the quote here it was really hard for me because I've had so many quotes and everything and the Lord really helped me narrow this down and focus it says this is out of the Mighty God unveiled before us and he preached like you go back when you when you're studying something I've learned is you go back and see where he preached the same thing and you can see the evolution even his Revelation grew more and more as you read the word of God and you get a revelation it opens up and then you see you can go back to read the same message a thousand times and get a thousand different it keeps growing it's an eternal word am so dig into the word the word is alive not only in us but you have to feed on it amen I I can't get enough of it to be honest with you I can't I'm not saying that try sounds super spiritual I just can't get enough of it but just listen to this experience here he says now what did this do putting the old scripture which is was the prophecy with the experience that Jesus was giving to her what did it do it made the Messiah the fact that she recognized him as the Messiah made him the Messiah brother brandham taught us that God is limited by the law of faith and and we he says the amazing thing is the attribute of a God he says what makes God is that he believes his own word and you're a child of God Amen and in the day that you live you believe your own word that who you truly are it's not this right here this is just a a vessel that I'm trapped in brother BR said we haven't even truly seen each other but we have Fellowship when we get around the word amen but it was he wasn't even a messiah unless someone recognized them as Messiah and called upon them because now we're talking relationship everything is all about relationships in your day what is the message what is promised to you and what relationship or what rights do you have to lay claim to God and what can you expect in your life and the True Believers will recognize it and then they'll go to Desiring it amen and then it'll come to pass but it requires your faith your desire that's just how simple it is that's that's it like when brother Bram that that Vision that they were he was supposed to kill a caribou and a bear and they were getting worried and the people were like oh it's not going to happen not going to happen and it always astounded me what brother brandom said he goes they just walked into it the reality but we always try and make something happen let me go do this and brother brand calls us he goes CHR Christianity Today is just a bunch of do Goods we just want to be nice humble Christians and it's fake piety is what it is and we're guilty of it too but that's okay but we're just gonna continue you're a true Son of God you're going to line up to the word for your day amen now brother Brown talked about the calvinist for extreme election believers they they you could do whatever you want I'm a sign the Holy Spirit brings balance Perfect Balance I was so out of balance I didn't realize it that I received the Holy Ghost and he started balancing me amen and as husbands I'll just say this something that the Lord revealed to me is that we want so many I've seen it my whole life and and in the message and it's a part of it and it's a part of the growing up of the message but as husbands we would always just stand there and be I'm the lion I'm the king of my home home you have to you have to serve me but also you have to be the ox it's the balance actually I was fellowshipping with brother Barry and we were I was talking about this he said have you seen this and it was the Tabernacle in the wilderness the Holy Ghost was in the middle and over here is the ox or the the lion and right opposite of it is the ox why do you think that is they balance each other amen if you truly want to be the king then you sacrifice yourself for your family and they will reverence you it's in them to do it you don't have to take it that's right lion and Ox got to go together don't be off this way or off this way amen the other way face of man and that was the reformers it was just amazing Enlightenment understand and we could go and we could be studying the word and we get this and we get and it's just it's such illumination the average believer today we could take one of our kids in our assembly and what they've learned of the message would Astound most theologians in the world what they know truly and that's great but it's balanced by the Flying Eagle divine revelation don't be off to and sometimes and I've been guilty of it that you're way over here bless God I'm being re and I'm no worly good to my family so the Holy Ghost but brings balance to all these things just stay centered and if you're not centered God will reveal it to you and he'll tell you how to go about fixing it and it's more of him as what it is amen but back here here it's just astounding that the greatest of the Sadducees and Pharisees is standing there face to face with the Living Word and no idea they actually called them be right so we have to guard and protect what we led into ourselves and what we what we feed on because it can contaminate the understanding of the word but it's all in recognizing brother Brown preached so many messages about the presence of a God unrecognized and the counterbalance to that is I have heard but now I see and brother amen we can listen to the tapes and it's good and and that's what amazes me right now is that there's such a push push you know push play that doesn't align with the revelation of my heart the revelation of my heart is the voes left that and it fellowships with me every day I'm but I go back to the umum thund which is that book and that tape and it lines perfectly and if it doesn't align I leave it amen amen that's just how simple it is but to just say you just listen to the prophet listen to The Prophet this word didn't just come to live in a prophet he introduced something he was to forun amen I don't truly understand it how we can go backwards like that but it's just the way God does things and there's those that are called to see it and some that aren't that's just how it is and all we can truly do is stay true to the revelation of our heart walk in it live it let it live in us as much as we can and if there's any election in anyone around us they'll gravitate to that Amen brother brandham talked about Enoch being the perfect type of the bride and there's about eight places he talks about Jonah Noah sorry Noah being actually alive at the same time and if you go sometimes I'll go and just look and see what the theologians think about it and they have no idea they thought thought Enoch was dead 500 years before but the prophet told us that they were alive on the earth at the same time and it was his grandfather and he actually and we know that Noah also types the True Believer right but the perfect representation is Enoch and Enoch had this testimony that he just walked with God and pleased him and he actually said and you can go look it up in the message he says it two different ways he says Noah was watching Enoch are you on Enoch today are you the perfect Living Word of God Amen do you have a testimony that you know in your heart you please God Amen he said Noah who he types he says it the remnant of the Jews and the foolish virgin that's the the true the fool he says every word you know has a compound meeting compound Revelation but he said Noah was watching Enoch and when Enoch left that's when he knew to go get in the ark amen and then some he says to go get near the ark so all I want to say about that is if you're the Living Word of today there's people at your work yes your family they might not express it but they're watching youen and if there's any election in them whether they come in to the bride or they they give their lives I don't why we leave that up to God but it's your life that they're watching The Living Word so we need to understand the power that lays within us just submitting to the word and allowing the word brother Brown talked about the Holy Ghost eternal life being a person it's not some fairy it's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and I know many of us of here have sat and we experience that fellowship with him and a lot of times we get the blues I mean I do after I have a fellowship with the Lord and that and I got to go back to work the next day I just don't want to be here it's hard but you still have to carry on right amen our families need us we still have word to fulfill and I'm I'm pretty sure all believers down through time felt that way why am I here why can't I just go home well God's got some work for you to do amen I'll keep pushing on here see she was a witness with a testimony experience the Living Word she had heard but there she seen and recognized and then she acted brother Brandon preached that hearing recognizing and acting right I guess you could say that she had representation she heard from her theophany however you want want to say it right now but now she knew and actually I I was so captivated by this I wanted to go look will the ever talk about her after like this is the amazing thing it just says she ran into the City and said come see a man brother brandham never really talked about it again but the amazing thing is is Russia and Eastern Europe they have their whole religion there's religions built upon her life she went on she had Five Sisters Three Sons I was just reading it and it was just interesting cuz I'm like hey who is this woman like was there anything out there and actually most excuse me most of the female ordination of uh ministers female ministers is based on their life and what they they use it see what Satan does with things but the prophet didn't say anything so I just that's interesting leave it alone let's let's move on and stick with the prophet amen so that is the quotes there I read this I want to get into he says all things work together for them for that love God and God has a purpose he wants to come and dwell in us and it's like well how do how does he do that are we going to believe like the sadut phes he's going to come in clouds of glory and it's just going to be this amazing thing and brother Brandon preached this message it's called I know and I would just like to talk a little bit out of here so he says see the devil was working on them putting them on an ash Heap we all have Ash heaps amen it's a part of the process and because of our Humanity it's the only way that God can actually get through to us is to bring us into desperation for they wanted to give them a testimony that I know not I guess or perhaps it's I know I know CU When you know no matter what comes against you you can stand there and say I serve the Living God am he's my portion we can be like David sir he slew the lion he did this for me he did this for me in me why would he not do this and when then when we overcome a situation in our life whether it's our marriage or work or whatever it may be we can stand there and just in full assurance and say Lord Do It Again amen and remember those trials are bought brought upon you the same way so that you will not say well maybe that is right maybe the scripture is true maybe Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy Ghost is right but when you get that experience Hallelujah and come off that Ash Heap you get the revelation of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost our pastors been preaching it I want to say something I've been guilty of sitting in the Pew here and the pastor's preaching away and it's actually right for me but I'm sitting there I like who the world is he preaching to can't be me going right over my head for a year he preached about to positions I needed to hear that but I didn't listen I didn't but it came to a head and finally I got it but I just look back after and I'm like oh my goodness for a year he's been trying to get this the Holy Spirit trying to get me to understand this and I'm just sitting there with my arm around my wife everything is perfect and sometimes that happens to us we're blind yes but God is good amen we're a true Son of God we'll finally get it some of us are more stubborn than others amen but when you get that experience and come off the ash Heap and you get the Revelation that God by the baptis of the Holy Ghost you can scream I know my redeemer liveth because he lives in me [Applause] Amen brother Glory that makes me just want to weep yeah it truly does not to try and sound spiritual but I've experienced that and my goal as an encourager is just like Brother come on come on Amen get over yourself amen we all need it whether you're in the message 50 years two years one day amen you got to have that and he's going to give it to you but it's through your trials and tribulations so when I mean job his own wife turned against him has your wife ever turned against you brother Paul you've been married sometimes we might think it because of something in our own selves and like oh you know something wrong with her but look in the mirror we're all told right talking about talking about myself here people like this is a personal walk personal revelation I'm just trying to share that things that happened in my life and I go back and it's sitting right here and then I can say that's it that's what for me it seems to be I haven't been in the message my whole life so I don't know all the quotes on the scriptures but I experience something I go back is this of God or not and then I find things like this I'm like yes praise God Satan tries to tell me I'm not a son of God right I've experienced that I'm a Son of God and then you just stand there stand on that amen every Christian believer has to be pushed into those trials every Christian believer has to be put on the ash Heap so that he or she can come forth with an experience I know my redeemer liveth amen amen thank you Lord there it's not God sent a prophet it's not the testimony that's right I've noticed when I get the fellowshipping with going back to when I first gave my heart I was embarrassed I'd be at work and I just do my thing and I never really witnessed or talked to anyone it was kind of like a borderline believer right it's like I go to church amen back then then that was my testimony oh didn't you know God if I did fellowship with someone didn't you know God said a prophet I've noticed now whenever I'm at work and someone comes to talk to me I just talk to him like I'm talking to brother if I'm visiting brother Joel or whatever and I just talk and I sometimes I'll go back after and realize wow like what a witness and it's not some big thing and it's not God sent a I'm talking about the Living God and what he's done for me in my life and a few times they're like man how do you know this like oh by the way didn't you know God sent a prophet it's the last thing out of my mouth not the right it's just amazing how that works that way right says we don't come here this morning just to sit and talk about some historical Affair which is all true but we come here with a testimony this morning I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I know it Beyond any Shadow of Doubt I know that he raised from the dead and he lives within me today day he is mine and I am his I am a joint air with him in the kingdom of God what he's saying here is you got to have the same faith and understanding and conviction that you know that Jesus came and died on a cross for your sins the same level of faith and conviction understanding that God sent a prophet is that you are the Living manifested Word of God whether you feel like it or not amen that's what it's about to get you to that point and it's not arrogance it it humbles you beyond belief right such humility and then when that happens you want to give that Grace to everyone that you meet you you do amen what the Lord revealed to my heart and is not to sound off the word or anything but Jesus his first coming he came to magnify the law Grace magnify the law the manifestation of you is election manifests and Ma multiplies Grace it does and how do I know that because that's how the word moves in me that's how it moved in the prophet it's just the reality of it it's no longer you look at your brother like oh how can they do that or how can they do that you look for that word and then you pray right away I start praying Lord help my brother with that that's that's not Donald snow it's not I'll stand back there at the back door and I see someone coming in there walk and I'm not trying to lift myself this is the how the spirit is living in me I stand there and I've learned now different people and how they're man and I'll see I know they're a bit down right I'll shake their hand and Lord bless my brother lift them up tonight see them come in and they're tired Lord Quicken themen that's how that's the life of Christ it's the Life of Christ not and our pastor keeps saying not the life of Christ plus it's the Life of Christ that's it and if you don't have that and if you desire it then everything you have go get it you're going to fall flat on your face you're going to get desperate and then God's going to come amen and you're going to have that experience amen paragraph 91 but today I just love this so I just want to read this because it's about the knowing and I can't say it any better than than this okay actually 15 minutes right let me get here I'll read this one and then I'll get into my testimony there was too much of you in you paragraph 92 so God had to squeeze it out amen now we we always hear about the great squeeze and everything and I believe there's a squeeze first before that squeeze happens that squeeze happens because you're already already prepared for it I've been squeezed in the last three years brother amen and it's been a blessing Hallelujah through trials and while the squeezing excuse me was coming out coming on is hard but after a while the sky clear back then you see the promise of God Amen the promise of God for this day is a body change amen and it's a process yes sir and it's through these trials amen and every time you receive a trial and you receive what God purposed for you and you line up to and you kill the little bit of the old man you become reflect more of that life in you that is the body change people it is it's a daily dying to yourself and then the cation of it is a literal body change he said a dove cleans itself from the inside out am amen this word has got to get into your soul and mix with your faith and then change you from the inside out amen then you cry I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he will stand on the earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh I will see God these little trials and things are but for just for a moment and then they fade away pass away but they're only done for your good let us remember that that God's would get glory in your weaknesses they're there and it's in this message I I think everyone should go read it it's I know but it's they're there to bring you in closer fellowship with God and when you're in closer fellowship with God you begin to understand your relationship with God and the right that you have to lay claim to and what you can expect in your life that's just how simple it is amen so I'd like to talk about the literal lived experience of this because it all sounds so amazing and great but I've been married and you don't need the clap almost 25 years I was shocked actually the last time when you all started but it is an amazing feat to stay in age divorce is rampant you have to ask yourself why is that right why is divorce rampant and I backslid away and my my perfect wife that God gave to me and I know a lot of times I didn't see her that way but now I understand that she's everything I'm not and I'm everything she's not and us together are perfect you have to see that it makes everything so much simple but the Holy Ghost has to reveal that to you so we were back the woman that I loved the moment I saw within 4 hours I knew that's the woman I'm going to marry I can't explain it so it's a revelation and Satan always comes and attacks our stones of Revelation that's what he attacks right serving the lord everything's going good and then we tried to have children and we couldn't have children or at least at that time time Satan comes starts beating beating me down get tested and I we find out it's me I'm the issue if you want to say but really no all things work together for them that love God so I start listening and backslide away run out west and the man that I became disgusts me the way I treated my wife the things I've said and done she'd never deserved any of it but as you take one step away you don't know how far you're going to go amen we had kids and here's God now starting to work on was the fiveyear process of me coming back to the Lord because all of a sudden you have a desire to serve the Lord now Satan's the other way now he's quoting scriptures that you're saying oh no you in your day of Grace it's we all been there we we've been in that battle the final straw was my father passed away and I had to identif go through his life and give a eulogy eulogy and the Holy Ghost asked me what type of Father are you going to be what's going to be remembered of you what are they going to say at your funeral right then and there I gave my heart to the Lord amen amen Lord put it on my heart to go back to my old church and make things right so I did it and it's a process so we come here and we try to come to church and got the wrong number so for a year I was in my basement basement and I talked about that before overcoming certain things in my flesh I was still other things that were in me that had to come out but I began to see a little bit of the terrible husband I was and I really wanted I had a desire to make my wife happy but I didn't fix things according to the word and the more I tried I had a desire would just make things worse and rightfully so I just wanted that warmth back the way it was in early in our marriage and then I it's like maybe it'll never come back but I had a desire in my heart and I prayed to the Lord and I went about trying to do it myself with my own ability just making things worth I couldn't even so the big complaint I remember and we've all been there if you're married is she felt like she was just a warm body and I felt I was just a piggy bank and that's where but we loved each other and we'd go to bed at night it's like hey I'm willing to work on this are you willing to yes Common Ground let's we'll get through this divorce was never I guess I shouldn't say never there was a few times we uttered it but it wasn't in our heart started coming the church and developing relationships and growing in the Lord and the Lord put a real desire like a real desire in my heart to make my wife happy the desire was for her to be the happiest sister at church I tried to make that come to pass still not fixing things or doing it according to the word it was still a lot of physical and in her part of the life wasn't so much about that anymore but I was still that was one of my main focuses and I would I come to realize that and I mean I would pray like for almost two years like Lord just take it out of me like let me be on the same page as her brother Brown you know it's either sex money or authority headship goals are the three main thing there's other little things and there up to that so for us at that point it was the whole physical intimacy thing right I had a real desire and one day I was sitting around the fire with a brother and we got the fellowship and it came out I I voiced it he voiced it it's like well okay we're not the only one right some of us have a real desire to be that for our wives still now Satan there's a I'm going to say a demon or a spirit that still wasn't handled correctly and I'd go about trying to do it and you've ever done that like you have a real sincere desire to help someone you go to help them they just want they just you feel like you've been spit in the face and then I of course the old Dawn would come out and I'd get all upset and ah and then a week later you're in that mess type thing but you had a sincere desire but it was a sincere prayer and a sincere desire of my heart and I got desperate and one day I was out excuse me I was fellowshipping with our pastor and I was we went shooting guns and we had coffee and a two-hour visit turned into a 5 hour and we were just sitting in the truck fellowshipping and we started talking about this remember all of the things that I the scriptures and the quotes that I've quot I'm talking about now the live reality of it and it's just seems so simple and we're talking about recognizing presence of God and every time time that God fulfills his words it's totally different than what this will think it will be we begin the fellowship and the Holy Ghost and it wasn't some great big thing it was after the fact when I look back on it I'm like that was the Holy Ghost came down through the gift of a pastor he didn't say much it was just in that presence and talking about it my wife has been was trying to tell me the very thing but I wouldn't listen because she's the problem not me right so the Holy Ghost come down and in that moment in that instance I saw myself the way my wife sees me and I didn't like what I saw but it didn't affect me I didn't get mad I didn't get upset I saw it as the grace of God right then and there the very thing that affected and was hold so for 14 years my wife didn't kiss me with emotion or feeling and I longed for it and I S I tried to get Quant quantity over quality this is just a reality for 14 years we lived in torture because of things that I had done things IID said and I didn't make it right God had forgiven me but she hadn't forgiven yet I haven't become the man deserving of forgiveness yet right then there and the pastor was kind of floored cuz I was saying like blowing kind of it looks like I was blowing things out of proportion because it seems so it wasn't I literally saw myself the way I deserved to be seen I was selfish self-serving I put myself before my wife my family never ever saw I was totally blind to it before but in that moment I saw it and right then and there I'm like Lord forgive me and we talked about and I'm like I'm going to go home and I said I'm never going to lay a finger on my wife again unless she welcomes it and we got talking about I'm driving home the true desire like I'm like on cloud N I just got lamb bases I just got 10 pounds of Flesh taken off my but I'm happy I can't wait to go home and do this this is all coming back after now thinking about what happened and I go home I say honey I'm sorry and I told her honey I promise you I won't lay a finger and I was driving home and Satan's like well it might be four weeks like I don't care God will be my portion and in this I know we talked about that and I I was listening to the message I work a couple weeks before that and he got to the point and brother brandham tells a story about when he went to visit Oral Roberts and it was the greatest building he's ever been greater than Kings any Palace he's ever been in and he got there and he felt so like Lord why am I not worthy of this he started and a voice came down through the cour like but I'm your portion and that's what I told Brother Barry God will be my portion he was my portion before you'll be my portion again so I'm driving and a couple minutes later Satan comes again well it might be four years I said I don't care if it's the rest of my life if it makes makes my wife happy I've never ever thought that way in my life was God correcting things that were in my life to work out the good of God in Me So I go home and it's just so simple nothing big and I just made that promise to her and it took four days just four days and my wife kissed me like she kissed me on her honeymoon amen I could die tomorrow and I'll be a happy man it's so simple but it's the power of God that's right don't overlook it don't overlook it whatever it is in your life it's there to bring you closer to God Amen and it's reflected in your family all your relationships maybe another day I'll get into that about about now how it reflects or magnifies great election once you truly know who you are and you surrender brother Bram taught us that total Deliverance only comes from Total sacrifice or total surrender we always want to talk about God's going to save me God's going to deliver me it's all about you handing it over to God it's 5 to 12 musicians if you want to come I just wanted the fellowship and Sh it's to me it's such a tremendous Victory it'd be to me that's greater than an angel coming and standing for 14 years I desired and longed for it i' kissed my wife goodbye every morning and there was no love back and I knew I caused it I was the cause of it the old nature old Nature's got to die honestly I can't wait for the next thing and I say it now and I know there's a Punch coming but honestly I can't wait to see what he's going to do for me next can't there's more in me I still here amen I just want to surrender I

instruction you gave him and that it will be sweet as honey in your mouth but make thy belly bitter this flesh cannot stand it but Lord we heard this morning it's the trials that you allow to come our
