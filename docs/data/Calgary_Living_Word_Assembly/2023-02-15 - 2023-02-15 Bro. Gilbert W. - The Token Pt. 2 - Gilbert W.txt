it's only you who can give the desires of our hearts our greatest desire is to be like you now may you help us father for the few moments we are going to be here Lord may we achieve that father through the preaching of your word loving master when we call to remember those who are going to a mouse they walked with thee Oh Lord but father just walking with thee it could not help it was until they invited you in their house and you broke the bread and their eyes were opened Heavenly Father it is my sincere and humble prayer it doesn't matter how long I have walked with you Lord but father I know tonight you can do something to open my eyes to have an experience that now I know Heavenly Father may you grant it unto us even as we go to read your word may you bless it father I commit myself in your hands just take me out of the way so that in your own way father you come admit the needs of your children through the preaching of your word heal the sick in our meetings father may you deliver those who are bound we'll look unto this moment as we commit all things now in your hands for it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray thank you musicians thank you let's turn to our Bibles look chapter 18 verse 8. and the Philippians chapter 2 verse 5. if you are there you can say Amen don't care Luke 18 verse 8. I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth then Philippians 2 5. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus may God bless the reading of the word you can have your seeds God bless you Saints pray and preach with me oh my the last time we were here we started our subject and I said anytime I will stand here it will just be continuation of the same and the pastor has been dealing on the same so we are just in line so tonight I just want to take it a little bit further from where we left but for the sake of those who are not with us I'll just try to go back a little bit so that they know where we were then we start from there now our subject was about the Covenant and we said God whenever he makes a covenant with man man fails so if you remain a man there is no way God will make a covenant with you so God can only make a covenant with God and we established with quotes that when God made our covenant with Adam Adam failed when he met a covenant with Noah Noah failed so he had to make a covenant with the apron but before he could make a covenant with Abram he had to change his name from Abram to Abraham so he took part of his name and joined it to apram to make it Abraham so in that case now God was making a covenant with God and that is now an eternal Covenant that cannot fail now tonight I want to say this a covenant is annulled without the token the Covenant has no effect without the token the pastor has been saying You must receive the Holy Ghost and I'm saying without the token the Covenant is announced forget about the Covenant may God help us now you can only shout your issues with the message of your day and the message under the messenger are one and then since the message is the word then the messenger become the word to the people I wonder how many people can you say I can say Amen to that the messenger becomes the word to the people that's right oh my God help us now what is a token a token is a sign that your faith has been accepted I will repeat it a token is a sign that your faith has been accepted now what is faith we have been talking we have been talking about I and my father are one can claim that I and my father are one anybody can make a claim that I and my father are one but now we want to see tonight how to achieve I and my father are one if we can see how to achieve it then you can stand and say I and my father are one now for you to say I and my father are one that statement is a statement of identification you are identifying yourself with you can say I am of the family of Johnson's you are identifying yourself with the Johnsons and there are some characters you can identify yourself with the Johnsons or else forget about it hello help me to preach you cannot just say I am say I and my father are one Thief can say and my father are one but for you to say I and my father are the one then you are character must be reflected in the character of your father may God help us oh my foreign okay now the prophet says in the message unbelief does not hinder God paragraph 37 the prophet says in the last days it takes it is going to take what is going to take to stand in is a scriptural trained Church I'll repeat it what is going to stand is as scripturally trained Church you are you have been trained on the scriptures you can identify your life with the scriptures you can say I am the Fulfillment of this scripture that is the only way you can come to a point where you can say I and my father are one why the father is the scripture the father is the word so you must become the word and once you become the word then you can say I and my father are one and until you become a working scripture until you become a living scripture then how can you say I and my father are one God help us okay in the same message the prophet says we realize that we are in the in that day to where anything can look so real but yet it is of the scripture that anything can look so real but is of the scripture then the prophet says if it is like that leave it alone right if you have an experience and that experience is of the scripture leave it alone don't even talk about it we want scriptural trained people you can point yourself to the scripture and say I am the Fulfillment of this no matter what kind of sensation what the results you find out of it if it is in scripture stay away from it stay right with the word yeah well you say that you are getting the people unbelief no I am trying to catch them to Faith Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Creed no Faith cometh by hearing the word so as you hear the word as you hear the word then the word transforms you to become the one we are what we eat we are full of pieces hamburgers and so Spirit spiritually we are also what we eat if you are fitting on Sensations which are not based on the word then that's what you become in the message look the prophet says now listen real close to the to this remark Faith now don't forget to get this now Faith is designed to see what God wills and wants no yeah amen I'll repeat it because people didn't say Amen and I'm not forcing you to say Amen and I can't force you to say Amen but I will repeat this listen so close to this remark Faith now don't forget to get this now Faith is designed to see what God wills and what God wants there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed and given to human race to find out what the will of God is and you take your faith that you got and it don't focus on the word then leave it alone you got the wrong faith then it takes me now to different the prophet says different levels of faith apparently yeah there is human faith and human faith it gives results how many believes that let's go to the scriptures oh my Luke chapter 5. Luke chapter 5. remember in Luke 18 the scripture says when the son of man cometh shall he find faith but now let's look at this Luke 5 18. and behold many proteins are bad a man which was taken with the past and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the house top and led him down through the edge through the tiling with his coach into the meetings before Jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee these are guys I call them they were crazy they were determined they wanted their man their person to get healed at all costs and because they could not access because since the people were so many they could not access him they decided to climb the roof that was faith they wanted their person to get healed I'll quote what brother maybe Noah say it is the faith it is your faith your faith can heal somebody so the scripture says Jesus saw their faith it was not even the faith of the sick person it was not the faith of the sick person but it was their faith and they were assault determined and these were not Believers of Jesus Christ they were not even followers hello so they are Faith could help a sick person to be healed but today you are not followers of Jesus Christ hello so okay let me let me qualify my my statement the prophet says a Harold could come in the meeting yeah catch the faith and the get healed and somebody who is faithful are genuinely believer has been in that church for years they have prayed for years and years and they never get healed so this is an unbeliever just comes in the presence and thank you turns into the channel and receives what he or she wants so now it brings us to the prophet says faith in Jesus Christ and the faith of the son of man faith in the son of man and the faith of the son of man faith in the son of man it is your faith in who he is if you believe is a Healer you can you just tune yourself into the channel and you receive healing but now what we are talking about the faith of a believer the faith that Jesus Christ gives the faith of the son of man not the faith in the son of man the faith is the son of man we have seen those guys because they had faith in him that once they get their person to him he will get healed and he got healed that was the faith in the son of man let me read the quotes I can see people are wondering what what is this man talking about let me support it with the quotes oh my okay okay in the exposition of the seven charge edges the prophet says like this in apps up still when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on on this wise and he's that is Jesus name through faith in his in his Jesus name hath made this man former strong yeah the faith which is by from him Jesus has given him the man these perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith any more than he claimed that it was his his own name he said that Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus performed that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 2 13. it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers his own faith that he had given to the Believers so first qualification you must be a believer so once you are a Believer then he gives you that faith so once you have that Faith then now you can exercise it why because you know his will Jesus Christ said the son can do nothing accept what he sees the father what the father shows him then that that is what he will do if the father has not shown him then there is nothing he can do can we also come to that level whereby you can say you are led by the father you are led by the spirit of the father there is nothing I can do my hands are tight I'm waiting until God shows me until my father shows me how to do it that's what he wants you know his will you are not just you are not you are not just pretending or guessing no there is no casework God help us now at that point let me say this last time we said we talked about Dr David Livingstone when he went to Africa and he met with the Africa with the chief then they met a covenant they exchanged the tokens now at the point of exchanging the tokens let me try to traumatize the way my brother topi was doing it let's put sister Hut here the African Chief here and Dr Livingstone or brother pranaham here there are three people now the when Dr David Livingstone asked the chief what do you want he said I want that white coat which represents he was a doctor so the white coat is identified by doctors so the chief said I want that gift of healing now here stands sister hearty the spirit of the Lord comes to the prophet and says ask what you wait what do you want right now she had a sick sister they had prayed for her for many years so that was one need the other need she was poor and when the prophet said she was poor with me she was poor yeah she could have asked for one million dollars but he or she is when she was asked ask what you will she said salvation of my voice I I don't know one she was in the channel of the third pool she was in the channel of the ministry of the tadpole and the ministry of the 30 pool is focused on the soul but the African chief he was interested in the second and the first under the second pool so now you put yourself there in that scenario our pastor was praying for the needs he said okay if you have a need what did you ask for did you ask what sister had asked for we say we are in the ministry of the third poor sister Hattie no wonder the prophet said she asked for the right thing she was in the right Channel she could have asked for healing she could have asked for money she was poor but she didn't go for the money she was in the ministry of the 30 pool and the ministry of the 30 pool that is now the message of the hour the message of the hour is the ministry of the third pool so until we get into that channel where the ministry of the 30 pool can Now operate in us then there is no way we can say I and my father are one God have mercy on me so that's why when the prophet says the faith in the Son of God and the faith of the Son of God those are two different faiths those are two different faiths faith in the son depending on what you want I like the way the pastor puts it it's not a vending machine you just then it comes no if you take him as a vending machine then you can do it that way depending on how you take how you believe in him but now the faith of the son of the son of man his own faith when it is operating in you then you are under the ministry of the third poor when it comes when it comes to asking you ask for the right thing why because you are you are you are in the same channel with the father you are in the same channel with the father there is nothing you can do outside his will God help us now Luke 18 where are we read when the son of man cometh shall he find faith now we have seen those guys they had faith there are many quotations we can we can read about those who had faith but Jesus Christ was not impressed by that he comes to verse 8 and says when the son of man cometh shall he find faith now what is this faith we had those guys they had faith and the scripture says he saw their faith hello am I taking you out of the faith no we need to raise to another level where we can operate under the ministry of the third pool God help us are we following when the son of man coming shall he find faith now here we have different situations where people exercise to their faith and it worked in fact at one point Jesus Christ said I have never seen such a kind of faith he was he was testified testifying about it but then he comes here and says when the son of man cometh shall he find faith hello we are coming closer home now what God expects from us as his children okay in the message unveiling of God I didn't have time to pick those drawings of brother mavin but I hope this will explain in the message unveiling of God paragraph 370. how many sees him standing the mighty conqueror the word made flesh and veined before us the Alpha and the omeka he that was which is and shall come the root Under The Offspring of David was the son of man the Son of God the son of man and the son of David first he came as the son of man then throughout the church seven Church ages he changed into the ministry of the son of God but before he comes as the son of David in between here he has to come as the son of man hello he has to come as the son of man so when he was saying when the man when the son of man cometh shall he find faith so now we can say the son of man has come now if he has come has he found faith now which faith of the first and the second pool people enjoy that and it's good we love it but we are talking about the third pool now what is the third pool God help us oh my let's go to Saint John chapter six okay let's go Mass 51 okay let's start from verse 48. to give it Clarity I am that bread of life your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore stroke among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat but when he was doing the Miracles when they needed food he multiplied bread they had no problem with that where they needed healing he provided healing he they brought people from all over for healing but now when he changed the ministry and said unless you eat my flesh and rig my blood he have no life and he did not explain it is who can tell us how he explained it he did not explain it it was already poor who came later on and explained it so at that time we can say it was a mystery so many of them got offended because of the mystery but what happened to Peter then heater okay many left him they remained 70. maybe these were ministers I they said no this is too much they also walked away then they remained 12. he turned to them he met it even harder leave her alone nowadays you preach a social gospel at least for to keep people in the church not Jesus Christ when that time came he turned now to the 12th and he said do you also want to go then Peter said even if we don't understand but where else can we go to whom else can we go when thou alone has the words of life then he see it harder I know of 12 and one of you is a devil so that now people can cite their hearts God help us so faith without continuity is not a Godly faith they had faith when he was doing the healing they had faith when he was providing them with food but when the ministry changed we are coming closer Home when the ministry changed like when he said I and my father are one they picked the stones but these are people who are enjoying the gifts the Miracles they were rejoicing they were testifying about the Miracles oh I took my cousin there and he was healed I took my sister there and she was healed they were rejoicing but when the ministry changed then what happened those who remain are those who are seeds from the beginning they were seeds from the beginning when the rain comes it doesn't change the status it doesn't when the anointing comes it doesn't change the status the prophet says when the Revival comes it comes to revive what is inside now if what is inside is not the word what is going to be revived we need to wake up we need to come to a level where you can say I and the Christ are one or where you can say like Peter where else can I go but the people have become so I I don't know even how to put it they have to be peppered to come to church oh just come a time comes when you have to prove what is inside you brother Iman will say to when he was preaching here the children of Israel God tested them to know what was in their hearts and when he tested them he proved that inside them it was just a bunch of non-believers they rejoiced when there was a miracle when something when an issue comes they start complaining God help us so that we change from complaining people to our people who can Rejoice whether things are good or bad you don't go by situations God help us we need to mature I was telling somebody that we need to mature and come to a point even when you hear that brother Paul was talking about me you say God allowed him maybe he has seen something to correct me or if somebody calls me a black monkey I said maybe he has seen a character of a monkey in me that is somebody who is mature you take everything positively can we come to that level and can we say I and my father are one God help us we need to grow I don't have time oh my goodness I prepared so many yeah God help us we need to grow thank God I am working in progress and I can monitor I can look at my life and say at least at this point I know something is working on me something in me is changing right I can say oh yesterday some I could hear somebody talked about me then I could frown my face for the for the whole day but today I can rejoice and say I'll just pray for him kanui can you can we so we need to mature let me just what because I don't have time to read the prophet says we are supposed to be way up here but what is happening we are not allowing ourselves for the word of God to have preeminence in US or we don't stay long enough to receive a change how does the change come Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word how many times do you listen to the word God help us Saint John chapter 8. Saint John chapter 8 verse 30 as he spoke these words many believed on him were they believers please answer me what they believe us as he's back these words many believe it on him were they believers if they believed which means they were believers hello then let's go to the next verse verse that one then say Jesus to those Jews which believed on him were they believers they believed on him then he said if we continue in my word then I.E my disciples indeed if we continue don't stop don't stop at the first under the second pool go on until God help us oh my God help us so let's not stop at the first and the second pool let's go on until we get into the ministry of the third pool now what happens in the minister of the third pool the prophet says there is no impersonations the first pool they are kind of being impersonations the second pool there can be imba impersonations but when it comes to the third pool and that's why we read Philippians 2 5 where Paul says let this mind that was in Christ be in you now you have gotten the mind of Christ when you get the mind of Christ there is no impersonations there the other things like Sensations that devil can impersonate them but when it comes to the fatty pool the opening of the word then it becomes real to you you can say I can see my character now is the character of my father one time I think I preached here about the mirror and I said the mirror doesn't lie if you take a selfie you can Mo you can change it into whatever you want you want to achieve but the mirror tells you exactly who you are may God help us to stand before the mirror so that we know who we are questions and answers on the seals if you can understand it this is the third pool see you should have caught that the other day so so then just remember there will be no impersonations like there was no of the other two that is the first and the second there were some impersonations but when it comes to the 30 pool there is no impersonations oh my God help us oh yes God help us in the message the unpardonable scene paragraph 243 the prophet says and you all get the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's be on one big happy family let's be one big happy family then don't come in saying well I caught the Holocaust glory to God I am going to have gifts now just let the gifts alone they will take care of themselves see God when he sees he wants to use you for something he will tell you what to do and go to go do it don't seek gifts seek The Giver of the gifts when you have the giver then he will give you those gifts according to the situations oh my in the message the rapture when ajam comes into the um of the female it don't take all you didn't become a human jump from your father and and then the next thing you become a jump from a dog and the next thing from a cat and the next thing from a chicken it was all human Young and the body of Jesus Christ The Pride will be part of his body which will he was the word and the pride will have to be the word what added to word added to word Lord's justification Wesley sanctification pentecostal's baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts and all the rest of it it goes with it it has got to be what on top of what jump on top of jump life on top of life to bring out the full stature of the pride of the Lord Jesus Christ now remember you was an attribute so how now do you achieve I and my father are one what on What what only what only what until you become the one why because he's the one so once you become the word you don't use any intellect of yours and the situation that comes you say let's see what the word says can we get that can we achieve it if we can allow what or what what on what you eat the what you eat the word until when you smile is the word even when you frown is the word God help us amen may God help us I'm just about to conclude so those who are praying that I finish I think God has answered your prayer amen God help us so now back to John 8. where he said those who believed on him as they had those who had this word they believed on him now we have established they believed on him but then he said if he continue so don't be stuck command move on continue coming continue listening don't give up don't be discouraged by anybody the pastor didn't call you oh this church I cannot go back the the pastor didn't call you if you are called by God then you can say where can I where else can I go and that's what we need you are so much tied to the word until nothing can move you the winds will come and go the clouds will come and go but you will remain standing why you are anchored your anger holds nothing can move you and that's what God is looking for today those who have uncut themselves so much to the word until they have become the word they talk nothing but the word can it happen so may God help us we like saying oh sister sisterhatti she had a different spirit she had a different spirit why we can say he was connected in the third pool because the ministry of the third pool is directed to the souls so if we want the ministry of the third pool then let's surrender ourselves to him so that he can work on me change me into what you want me to be then that will make us climb higher to wear all things are possible can it happen it can happen it can happen if you are a seed he saved you because you are seed but don't should change yourself there is a quarter you don't I don't have time to read it if you are a daughter or a son of God and you have been sealed inside there is nothing can temper you out you can shortchange yourself yeah you want to take a lesser thing but inside you if you are a seed remember he's coming for those who are his so they were his you are in him before the foundation of the world you are in him as a thought the only difference between you and Jesus Christ for him he came from the thought he came through theophany before he came to flesh but for you you skipped the theophany you came direct to the flesh but now you are being born by the Spoken Word by the theophany that you skipped so that now once you connected back to the theophany you can now see yourself and say you are co-equal with Jesus Christ Glory can somebody say like that he's still working on me yeah but time is fast spent the more we need to yield ourselves the better the faster we surrender ourselves the better if there is anything that is holding you you better leave it yeah and you can make a resolution maybe their musicians can come I am resolved I am resolved no longer to linga no no longer to be changed by the words the lights we can make resolutions I want something higher this genuine children of God are craving to cross over Jordan because their inheritance is across children so God help us let me press on let me forsake all that green does me anything that that causes distractions let me lay it aside I want to press on I am resolved I am resolved inside our friends [Music] hi there is [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] Hallelujah did you enjoy that tonight certainly enjoy the thought it's the resounding thought that I and my father are one it really has to come to that place and it's not an impossible thing Satan wants us to believe that's impossible and in this flesh truly it is but it's not our flesh it's our soul we heard that tonight you know I just had had it on my heart this week that God really is only interested in one thing one thing alone not not even so much the church and the attendance and our works as our brother spoke tonight he's interested in one thing in each one of our lives and that's spiritual growth and he will do every single thing he needs to do to see that happen in our lives and he will not compromise on that It's a Wonderful thought to think that that's that's truly the desire of a Believer is to see spiritual growth in our lives as our brother was preaching tonight talking about faith and you know first pull and second pull type of faith I just couldn't help but think you know there was one one time who wasn't yet converted but he was given the faith of the son of man and so he's given the faith in the son of man not the faith of the son of man and he Jesus on the boat he said come and walking towards them on the water said to them come on Peter walk out you can walk on the water he wasn't even yet converted and what happened he had the faith in the son of man and he stepped out of the boat and he walked on the water is what the word says but as soon as he realized he didn't have faith of the son of man he sank I just thought that was such a good thought you know uh I really enjoyed it tonight too I was thankful for the ministry and the body five-fold Ministry that's what it takes to perfect the Saints it's not just a one-man Ministry let's just go to him in prayer tonight as we close a gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to recognize that we were in you before the foundation of the world and Lord you desire to see your word on our lips father you want to see your life being lived out through each and every one of us and we know that you will not compromise on that not one bit and father tonight I pray Lord just a special prayer of encouragement for each one of us Lord maybe we're not who we want to be but we know we're sure not who we used to be and as we go forwards from this service tonight Lord I pray that would be the desire and each one of our hearts Lord is to grow spiritually and not through an achievement but through submission through surrender through complete surrender unto you and to your word because we know that your your will is your word and we pray that your will would just manifest in each one of our Lives as we feed on your word we become your word faith is what we're after and we're not not our faith Lord but your faith we want to have your faith we want to see the end of our faith Lord and to see your faith live out through us tonight Lord we pray that you would bless brother Gilbert that you would just restore his strength father Lord we pray that you would be with those who were traveling tonight Lord the livesies who are Lord going back home to see their family Lord we pray that you would give them traveling mercies Lord that you would just bless their time away abundantly father Lord we just ask that you would be with each one tonight we love you and we thank you and we just ask all these things tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I
