========================================

foreign [Music] I want to sing the song it's titled one dead soldier we know along the way many times as Christians we have scars but the important thing and the interesting thing is a god there's no throw throw us away because of our scars it brings us closer to him and he heals us heals our wounds may you be blessed by the lyrics and the the song this morning Jesus name [Music] Lord my battles cause I'm ready and my medals Must Be Few following the midst of conflict raging so often I failed you but somehow you've kept me standing pick me up each time I'd fall you don't cast down wound soldiers you just love them through it all one day all the soldiers will go home we'll cease fighting for the battle we'll be worn as the captain says well done you fought the fight the race is run wounded soldiers [Music] welcome home in my heart I am a Victor yet at times the flash is weak and so often I have begged Your Grace lest I go down and defeat is then I recall that battle that was fought by you alone as your blood ran from that rocket cross our victories one day all the soldiers will go home we'll See's fighting for the battle will be won as the captain says well done you fought the fight the race is wrong wounded soldier the war is over will come home one day out the soldiers Will Go On we'll See's fighting for the battle will be as the captain says well done well to fight the race is wrong wounded soldier the world is over [Music] [Applause]
