Sister jarmaine's children and grandchildren father Lord we know you are the great I am and we just accept you that way father we love you and we thank you we ask all these things now father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you musicians thank you tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Exodus chapter 12. and then I would like to get into the maybe a couple of the gospels and hopefully not keep us too long maybe try and keep it to a half an hour so we don't keep everyone too late tonight but we'll just see what the Lord says about it all certainly wonderful to be in service once again communion service that we know he has given us as an ordinance Exodus chapter 12 verse 13. and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt you turn over the page and read Exodus chapter 12. verse 23. first we had the word coming to the prophet then we had the prophet bringing the word to the people here that we're going to read in Exodus 12 23. for the Lord will pass through and through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and upon the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come in unto your houses to Smite you and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy Sons forever and it shall come to pass when ye shall come to the land which the Lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover who passed over the houses of the children of Israel and Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshiped let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know that the scripture is written for a purpose Lord Jesus that all scripture is given for Lord Jesus instruction Lord Jesus for repu Lord for our benefit Lord Jesus father tonight we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done we thank you for your word we pray that you would just speak to us once again father and that Lord in every aspect of this service that you would be glorified we just ask all these things now and Jesus Christ made me pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated it's a wonderful thing to get into his presence to know where we stand this is not just an ordinary time when we gather together in church like this we know that it's a communion service but it's not just an ordinary communion service every one of these could be the very last one that we experience on this side of Eternity it's just a beautiful thing to take a look at this scripture here and recognize that when we talk about communion service it's about the last supper and the Last Supper is about the Passover and the Passover is what we just read That's the final plague that came to Egypt and that was prophesied even further back before this and I'm sorry I didn't get it tonight but it's such a beautiful thing he is the same yesterday today and forever and he doesn't change his ways and he doesn't change his nature he is the same and and to look at this scripture and and think that the LA the the the the Passover is exactly the the Last Supper that Jesus sat down to to fellowship with the disciples and it's just beautiful in Exodus chapter 12 here because we can see that you know the word of the Lord came to the prophet we read earlier on but then we read where the word of the Lord From The Prophet was given to the people just like we talked about in Joshua's day when when Joshua the last address the second last address for the children of Israel was the the the prophet speaking to the children of Israel saying you know this is what the Lord has done for us let's not forget it it was it was a man in his office speaking but then the last chapter is the same thing the same call to action but only thus saith the Lord the word of God coming to the people through the prophet and we have that example right here in Exodus chapter 12 and it says ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee into thy Sons forever and you might be thinking well brother Barry this was about the Passover supper but we're talking about doing a communion service tonight and and the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and being able to take that blood and strike the lentils and the doorposts in our lives in our homes and we know that all of this was a shadow and type of that very thing happening of the Lamb the the male lamb coming to be sacrificed for all of mankind and without this there wouldn't be that and without that we wouldn't have the token to apply in our very homes in our lives I think it's just beautiful I want to explore the discussion uh of communion and I think as we have the community services moving forward we probably will do this as I said I'm going to try to not take too long with it excuse me um but I want to talk about foot washing as well so we're going to talk about communion first we'll go through that a little bit and uh and just see I want to make sure that we have a scriptural basis the foundation is that this is in the word this isn't something that we just do because William Mary and Branham came along and said let's have communion service and let's get together and do this this is an ordinance that we're supposed to keep forever to remember what the Lord has done for us to remember that our Brethren who were in Egypt they were actually delivered by their obedience unto the word and it's not going to be any different for us today brothers and sisters if we don't take and apply that blood to the lintel and to the doorposts in our lives in our homes and our families then that Death Angel has the right to to strike Our Lives has the right to pass over our house and I can promise you in this age that Death Angel is going to pass over our houses and we need to make sure that we have that blood applied properly how do we do that we just take the orders that the lord gave us through the Vindicated prophet in our day how did they do it in Noah's day they just took the orders that the lord gave the prophet in his day and that was simply to get in the boat and you know brother Bradham says there was three given to him and one of them was water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to be baptized any other way you needed to be re-baptized it was the same thing as the book of Acts the other one was communion service the other one was foot washing and you know if we take all three of those and we exercise all three of those as message Believers in our lives then I want to say this plainly and maybe I'll be raked over the calls for it but you're a message believer when you exercise all three of those because that's what the prophet said to do and it's interesting when you don't exercise all three of those are you really exercising all that the prophet said to do you really believe all of the message of the hour and you know it just comes down to this it's going to get this way I know it we can say we've got this and we've got that and we've got the other thing there's this reason there's not reason there's the other reason and imagine if the children of Israel said you know there's this reason there's that reason there's the other reason I can't put the blood on the lentils in the doorpost I just can't do it for whatever whatever my job whatever my family whatever my thing is if if the people did that what would happen the death angel would strike is no different today brothers and sisters the only thing is we're not witnessing it on a on a on a natural tangible scale what we are witnessing is that the devil's coming for our kids we are witnessing that the devil's coming for our marriage we are witnessing that that Death Angel is passing over the land the anointing is way more than we can stand on our own if we think that we can withstand it we're mistaken we will be overcome by the spirit of this age because brother Bradham says it very clearly to reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of the beast so all this business about vaccines and all of that I I you know whatever it's irrelevant because brother Branham said the marker of the Beast is rejecting the word of God it's not a vaccine it's it's it's not a movement where you put a flag behind your truck and you say you know whatever you want to say it's got nothing to do with any of that and it's a trick of the devil for people to think that they're actually preventing something when all they're doing is joining up and they don't even realize it now that's what brother Branham said one day you're going to recognize that you've taken the mark of the beast and there's nothing you can do about it and how do you do that how do you do that brothers and sisters you reject the ordinance the direction that was given to us through the prophet of our day excuse me because what does the word say the word we'll get to this a little bit later tonight but the word says if you know these things happy are ye if you know these things happy are ye we talked about it this morning what happens when we're done a communion service I I many times every time when I walk out of here I feel like I'm flying out of here I don't feel like I'm walking out of here something happens to us when we have a communion service because we know these things and we're happy because we participate in it because we have the ability to but you know brothers and sisters we can't take it lightly not everyone has the ability to come to a communion service not everyone has the ability to get down and humble themselves before a brother or a sister and watch their feet it sounds like it's a simple thing but it's not but I want to say God bless each one for coming out to have the courage to do that because it's not me it's something inside of you that's causing it to happen something when you hear that word spoken is stimulated it's it's a stimulation of that Revelation it's in your life I can see that I'm talking more than I really should be let's turn over to Matthew 26 26. just want to really show that there's a scriptural identification for this in the Bible it's not just something that we do because brother Branham said to do it this is something that's in the Bible it's in the word for us just showing the scriptural identification for it Matthew 26 26. and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drinky all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom can you imagine brothers and sisters he's not going to drink it until he can drink it new with you in his father's Kingdom he's waiting for us you know we talked about it a while ago how we're waiting for him to come we're waiting for the coming of the Lord the arrival of him in the clouds the the secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ but how much more is he waiting for us the ones that he created in him has anybody ever had a a birthday or something special they've wanted to do for someone and you have something special that's a secret that you want to give to them because you want to see that surprise think about the surprise that he's got coming for each one of us that gift of eternal life that gift of a perfect body that gift of no pressure in your life that gift of no sin that gift of no condemnation he's waiting patiently for us to come to that place it's such a tremendous thought let's go to Mark 14 verse 22. okay it's just such a an amazing thing to think that he is waiting for us we think we're waiting for him he's just waiting for that fruit to get ripe for that fruit to get to the place where it needs to be Mark 14 22. and as they did eat Jesus Took bread and blessed and break it and gave it to them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many verily I say unto you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God let's go quickly over to Luke 22. these are the the scriptural accounts the historical accounts of this very thing happening they were celebrating the Passover that we read in Exodus chapter 12 just before Jesus death that's what was happening verse 15 of Luke chapter 22 and he said unto them with this desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come and he took the bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you you know these are Divine orders that that were given to the church and it's so beautiful when we can recognize that God sent a prophet and and that he is a prophet that he was a prophet but his voice that we hear on the recorded tapes and the words that we read on the printed books it's it's a life it's alive you know when we talk like this I would say this we don't have to wait for brother Brown to come back because we can hear his voice every single day that we want to all we have to do is open a book or just press play but you know these orders that were given unto the church by Jesus were in the Bible but the prophet for eye day just brought them forward and said look you just need to do this it's an order it's a divine order that God has given the church and we know many churches have done it many churches have probably done it maybe a little more religious wise and and maybe more holy but we're just talking about the Church of the firstborn those truly elected who are going to go on the Rapture the ones who truly believe the word for our day that's who we're talking about here and and that's the word that was given to the prophet all he did was tie up the Loose Ends he never brought anything new all he did was magnify the word that was already there that was already being sacrificed and and and celebrated rather by all of the other denominations and they were doing it in their own ways I remember when I was growing up they were doing it with uh Wafers and and uh and uh it was grape juice because you couldn't have wine wine was a bad thing even though it says in the Bible a little wine for the stomach's sake but you know many people have different opinions about it and and I'm not here to debate it one way or the other other than to say this is the way that we do it is the way the prophet did it and and we sort of Step Back From the way that we used to do it for those people that don't know it and uh who knows maybe one day we'll go back to that again where it was just one cup and and I know that that's a debate that we could have we could have a big long discussion about it but I just think with everything that we've gone through this this great pandemic and all of the illness we do want to be a little bit careful but we did right up until the pandemic we did do this with one cup and you know I never saw anybody get terribly sick from it I don't believe in my own heart that if we truly believe when we go and take from that cup that anyone will get sick from it that's my own personal opinion but I'm not going to try and push that to the church because I know there's some people that just won't buy it and you know that's fine so right now just because of covid and the way things are that's why we're doing it this way with the individual cups and we just want to make it possible for everyone to partake of it we don't want to make anybody uncomfortable but brothers and sisters when we truly believe the word of God there ain't no disease that can stand in our way there ain't nothing that can stand in your doorway when you've applied the blood to the lintel and the doorposts and that's what we're talking about tonight understanding that this is way more than just a little exercise that we do because someone said that we should do it because brother Barry harped on it and said you know if you really believe you'll come to a communion service well you know it's more than that it's got to be way more than that it's got to be the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us out of communion brother Bradham he says now I do believe that communion or what we call communion now is to talk is the Lord's suffer now we only have three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is communion feet washing water baptism that's the only three things doesn't that make it simple but yet it can be so complicated in our lives those are the only three Divine orders that we have left communion feet washing water baptism he says that's the Perfection of the three see that's the only three orders we have we realize that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament and you know you don't have to look very far it can be a very difficult thing for people to just follow those three simple orders that brother Branham said were given to the church by God it wasn't brother Branham giving to them to the church but it's uh it's a real step of Faith to be able to look beyond that and you know we said it this morning and I'll say it again tonight if we have something in our hearts that condemns us where we feel like we can't come to the communion table what that is is the holy spirit saying just deal with that thing just go and deal with that thing and there's instructions in the word for how to deal with that thing whatever that thing is there's instructions in that word if we're willing to take the Lord add his word brother Bradham goes on to say in communion now if we would say the communion should just be taking the word I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's Supper until he has taken the word of the Lord into his heart see because I'm I'm going to read something for you in a few moments and and you'll see now notice then why we would on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army they do not believe in any form of water baptism said we don't need it now if we don't need water baptism why are we baptized said the water can't save you it's the blood that saves you I'll agree with that that's right the blood saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inwardly work of Grace has been done see so we must on communion it's something that he's given to us as an instruction to go forwards to recognize just like we do black water baptism it's an outward expression of the inward work that's happened to us we have truly repented and we truly do want to be baptized correctly according to Christian baptism just like we want to apply the blood to our homes to our lives we want that token we're on display not just to say that we've got it he goes on to say when we've taken when we have taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth into us and his body we live by him the word we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins we do it because we want to actually show everyone around us and all the Devils around us that there's something that's taken place inside of here there is a Formula that entitles me to the token and I'm going to go all the way to receive that token and I don't care what anybody thinks we all have to come to that place and it can be one of the most humbling things in our lives to say that you know what I recognize that this man William Marion Branham said that you can't be baptized truly in Christian baptism if you're baptized in titles that's a humbling thought and you know the biggest thing the biggest hindrance with that is pride the original sin that's what came in the in the in in heaven right when the devil stood up and and said I'm gonna be just like the most high there was something that was working up in his heart for somebody to actually get correction by the word to say that you need to be baptized properly or you need to go to communion service you need to partake in this if we say oh I can't do it something holds us back from it if we're not willing to go and do what we need to do to take those steps to fix it so that we can go there's something in our heart that's just not right he says this do in remembrance of me he goes on to say brother Brad I'm in communion 1965 the very last recorded message it's a half hour message it's well worth listening to um as we do the communion Services going forwards I'm going to draw upon this message I'm starting at the very beginning and this is the very first few statements in this message he said Paul said I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you this is Corinthians that we're going to read tonight um I think it's Corinthians that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is this do in remembrance of me for as often as you take this bread you show forth his life till he comes now we find out that they had people who come there's people that actually came in and were willing to follow the instruction of the Prophet follow the instruction of the word this is what Paul preached and this is what brother Branham preached and that's why this is what we preach we're going to say the very same things we're not going to try and bring in anything new but the only thing I want to do brothers and sisters is just make sure that we understand this is a very scripturally identified ordinance an order of the lord it's not something that we're just saying that William Mary and Branham brought to the world and and because he brought it and and he's got the signs wonders and miracles in his life and his ministry that we're just going to follow it blindly we are going to follow it but we're going to say hey there is a scriptural identification to that and we want to be able to show our children when they say what what meaneth these these Stones what what is this why do we do this why do we come to a communion service because it's scripturally identified God gave it to the children of Israel for the Passover Jesus sat down with the disciples and he showed them the Lord's Supper he actually broke his body could you imagine that they didn't even recognize what was going on in that moment they didn't even know what he was saying to them but they found out very soon and I believe as we go forwards brothers and sisters this world is just about fit to change just about fit to change and one day it'll just change and it'll be gone it'll be over it it will never be able to go back and you know unfortunately it will just be three and a half years left the worst three and a half years in the history of mankind and you know the bride will be in in the castle she'll be in the in the mansion with her King she'll be there and then he'll just say excuse me one second honey I just need to go down and reveal myself to my brethren and that's when you know it's just gonna change it's just gonna be glorious and you know we're moments just moments away from that it can feel like an eternity it can feel like a lifetime you know as even as adults it feels the same way when we think about the Rapture when we're children we might think you know I sure wish that I could have the freedom to just have my own car and get in the car and just go and drive somewhere and it can seem like a lifetime to get to the place where we have that freedom it can feel the same
