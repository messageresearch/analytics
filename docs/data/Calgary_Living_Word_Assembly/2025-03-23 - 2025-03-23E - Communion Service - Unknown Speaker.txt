would answer it according to your will father and that you would be glorified now with every aspect of our service service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you musicians thank you everyone for the specials certainly tremendous to see the gifts in the body in the service just beautiful you have your Bibles I'd like to read from St John chapter 6 starting with verse 47 we'll have a fair bit of reading tonight then a quote and then we'll just get on with the service I don't plan to preach a storm tonight I just want a little exhortation here about what we're doing it's not because we just had a man that came on the scene who had a a spiritual gift in his life who is a prophet to this age that some people would call it's not just because he said this it's because there's a scriptural identification that we do this that's the reason we gather this way amen and St John 6 starting with verse 47 Jesus contending with the most religious folks of the day he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life amen but we know that wasn't just enough was it no we had to go a little farther right and he identified what we needed to do he said I am that bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead and we know the prophet in our day he told us very clearly that that didn't mean that they just actually died went into the ground and were waiting for the resurrection it meant that they had nothing in their heart to mix with that word when it came through the Vindicated Prophet which meant Eternal separation that they were dead forever that's what that meant your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness they were religious but yet they are dead they are experiencing Eternal separation he said this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am isn't that beautiful yes amen I am once again the living bread which came down from heaven If any man shall eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give us of his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you you could imagine this was pushing them over the edge now yeah and he was fully intending to who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day am for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me Hallelujah this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever amen God bless you tonight you may be seated may he had a blessing to the reading of his word I think it's just beautiful how how strong how Stern how straight that he was preaching this to those people this this was Abomination to them according to the law and it really was a gift for the people who were able to see what was going on yes they were able to understand this is something different there's a corner being turned here it was a change of dispensations we know that but Jesus being God in flesh the word had come and now was telling them you need to eat his flesh and drink his blood it was completely against the law of Moses they weren't even allowed to touch a dead body of an animal or a human without a purification process so now he's talking in such a crazy way how on Earth could they ever eat his flesh and drink his blood we know that some people people said now he's talking about being a vampire we know that some people even after the resurrection they said well they went in and they what he was talking about was going in and cutting off pieces of his flesh and actually eating it and and getting a little bit of that blood as well there's all kinds of doctrines of devils but what a tremendous thing it is for him to talk this way in such a way that's so crazy and so out there how could that possibly be I just can't help but think it's no different today and the word of God says that he is the same yesterday today and forever why would he behave any differently today than he did then when he was there in flesh telling him something so crazy what happened in sainia Canyon a sword hit his hand many times people would say yeah I don't know I can't really get my head wrapped around that part that's a bit out there a little bit fictitious what was the uh what happened on Sunset Mountain what was the attraction on the mountain what was that the cloud the pyramid Cloud what was that what really took place what was really taking place I want to read a quote tonight out of the unveiling of God and I'm going to bounce back and forth between the scripture and this quote just a little bit as I said I'm not going to preach too long because I want to make sure we have enough time to not be pressured for testimonies maybe a little singing just to be able to maybe get home at a decent time I want to be respectful but hey if the spirit wants to move also we certainly don't want to try and limit God in any way we just want to be flexible remember if we're too rigid we're bound to get bent out of shape 1964 the unveiling of God brother bradam he says this now my subject this morning right at the very beginning of this one remember it's the unveiling of God 1964 after the seals are open after the sword struck is everything has already happened now it's just living in the glow of this ministry here he's just continually bringing the word the the unadulterated entirety of the word to the people the unveiling of God he says now my subject this morning I trust that God will reveal this it can't be a man that reveals it it's got to be him that reveals it I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you have a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it outright isn't that interesting what was he getting over to the people here unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you have no life in you he was talking about an event that was going to take place but they had no idea no ability no capacity to even understand it except for a very very few except for a very few I love how he says this here I I hope and trust that you have a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out wouldn't you think that he would just say it right out wouldn't it be so nice if he would just say it right out I remember as a kid thinking wouldn't it be nice if we could just be transformed into our glorious bodies and not have to go through all the struggle and strife that we have in this world wouldn't it be nice if we could do that it would be so nice but we would have power without character and we know that's satanic that is of the devil there has to be a character development in this flesh in in these Souls not this flesh I stand corrected carrying on in verse 59 of John chapter six Jesus says these things or sorry these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium verse 60 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this these were his disciples many of them when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it remember he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church it's not this cartilage that continues to grow for our entire life it's not this it's this it's the ear inside our heart the ear inside our soul that he has given us before the foundation of the world this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples what oh my that thing again just like the fathers in the wilderness yeah murmured at it he knew they would but when he knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you my well try this if this offends you what an if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before Oh My it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him can you imagine that what it must have been like for him as a man as a human being in all points tempted just like every one of us fellowshipping with the Brethren but knowing who is going to actually betray him my and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him and then Jesus then said Jesus unto the twel will ye also go away so beautiful once again Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go that thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are ass sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of judas's scariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twel and we know that this is where the separating time happened 70 walked away they couldn't handle it there was nothing in them to mix with that word but they were his disciples but yet he didn't explain it brother bradam says it in the message he just didn't explain it there's things that he did that he did and there's things I believe that he does that he just doesn't explain and we know in our day this is what happened there was the first poll the second pole there's the explanation of the first poll there's the explanation of the second poll and we know the angel of the Lord met him and said listen you cannot explain this third poll that's coming your way I told you not to explain it not to try and explain it and what happened there was a whole bunch of impersonators that came up and he said that's all it takes it's just a bunch of ministers get a whole bunch of preachers together and there you go you got problems and that's what he encountered impersonators of this word but here we have it in our day in 1964 now my subject this morning I trust that God will will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you have a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out and you know this is a treacherous place I believe because this is where people will come in and try and say well this is what God was trying to say to the church I've got the Revelation I've got the edge unless you follow my Revelation you're going to actually miss the Rapture unless you do it the way that God has shown me through my tremendous Revelation remember the Bible says that the scripture is of no private interpretation and this man that we follow that people might say we follow William Mary and brandham this man pointed to the scripture this man pointed to Christ and this man said if you can't take my word for it take his word for it instead but I think it's just amazing this is what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it outright and we know that after the second poll took place when he wouldn't explain it the people got upset they said oh he went off on his Doctrine didn't he talking about a sword talking about clouds picking him up talking about seven angels talking about the the the the Pyramid of angels talking about the seals being opened how could anybody have that Revelation how could anybody but the word of God says that someone will God God will reveal his mystery somewhere there's a time where the mystery of God will be finished amen as the as he has has declared according to his servants the prophets but here we have it in our day just like we saw back there in capernium something happened and God just never explained it perfectly clear did he he didn't send a complete diagnosis of exactly what happened he sent a prophet and some people had the ability to hear the voice of the Vindicated Prophet which is the voice of God and some people didn't but as it goes there's going to be more and more people falling away they're going to say man this is a hard thing oh my can't you give me a a better understanding can't can't we break it down can't we have some some good teachers that will teach us the Deep things you know what's going to take to teach us the Deep things is him Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in our lives he says see it's a thing sometime we have have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave now you might be saying brother Barry why you saying this this way because this is the prophet talking about it and sure enough the prophet's message was that way but you know what we're only going to say what the prophet said amen and if that is enough to actually cause people to go out I don't know what to say I can't help it we're only going to say what the the prophet said that's all we've said that's all we're going to say and if anything else is said then we need to have a conversation about it because we are duly bound as brothers as sisters we have got to make sure we keep each other in check if something is said that's incorrect we're we're duly bound to bring correction that's what the prophet said see it's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave and some to ponder over but that's done purposely he says it must be done that way now remember he's saying I trust that the spirit will reveal what God is trying to say to the church without saying it outright so this isn't even the prophet of God saying this then it might be that some would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did he does yet he says he said one day when he had thousands around him he said except you eat the Flesh of the Son of God or the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you what kind of a statement do you think that a medical doctor or a nurse or any fine intellectual person would think of a statement like that for a man that had a Ministry like he had why he would say eat the flesh that's cannibal to drink human blood it's a vampire in other words he wants us to be cannibals and vampires that's what the carnal mind will do isn't it but the spiritual mind says Lord what do you want what are you trying to say what is it that you want to get across to the church and I know we're preaching to the choir here tonight because we all understand this I trust that we all understand this this is not about eating flesh and drinking blood this is about following the ordinance that he gave because we're going to read it in a little bit he sat down with his 12 disciples before he went to Calvary to the Cross before he went to the garden and and actually won the victory by laying down his own will before he took the cat of nine taals 39 Stripes before all of that happened he sat down with his disciples and he had supper with him and when supper was ended he he while he had supper he took the wine and blessed it and he passed it around and said take drink of this this is my blood this is a new testament of my blood and and he gave the bread broke the bread gave it to them blessed it and said take eat this is my body it's broken for you for your sakes and they had no idea what he was talking about I think they might have been able to surmise a little bit at that point what was going to take place because of all the different statements that were made and maybe the conversations that were happening behind his back between the disciples but nobody really knew the impact the magnitude of what was really going to happen there but it's interesting because here he is telling the most religious people of the day unless you actually do this ordinance you have no life in me here we are today with the same ordinance here we are living under another Ministry a new testament if you will the third pole Ministry the opening of the word where many people say he's off his rocker it's totally out there how could it possibly be it possibly could be there's a scripture that says there's coming a time right where John is supposed to eat the book take that book and eat it up it's his flesh it's his blood unless we are willing to take his flesh and drink his blood then we will have no life in us that's what he says here he says in this quote that's cannibal to drink human blood vampire it's a vampire in other words he wants us to be cannibals and vampires the the carnal mind let's just put it together on our own understanding and that's what we'll come up with same thing with talking about the seal same thing with talking about deep things same thing with chasing mysteries in the message same thing with chasing Mighty signs and wonders we we try and deal with it carnally in the message it's designed to cause confusion brothers and sisters it's designed that way the only way we're going to get the truth of the message of the hour is is by the revelation of Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives any other way is going to be carnal understanding we're going to surmise the the outcome and we're going to say oh yeah he wants us to be cannibals and vampires he wants us to be Holiness he wants us to wear our hair a certain way he wants us to never wear pants all these different things no no the Bible becomes a new book at that point and we say whatever he wants is what I want I've never wanted anything more in my life than what he wants right but until we get to that place we're just like these guys it's just cannibals and vampires it's just carnal understanding and the whole audience walked away from him he says and there was a Ministerial Association with him of 70 that had been chosen chosen ones and he turned to them and he said what will you think when you see the son of man ascending up from where he came from now he didn't explain that and he never explained how but Paul did later on isn't that beautiful the first church age messenger yeah the one to start the church ages to set the pattern in motion and here we are living under the ministry of the last Church age messenger the one to tie up all of the Loose Ends and confusion he just said it see and then he said what will you say to these ministers when you see the son of man ascending up from where he come from no doubt them men said now just a moment oh we eat with him we fish with him we sleep with him we know where he was born we seen the cradle that he was rocked in and how does this man this is a hard saying carnally looking at it through the carnal mind mind I know you and you know me we know where we come from we know our little quirks and our little quacks we know all the different things the nuances in our lives how could we have Jesus Christ inside of us I don't know his word says it that's the only thing I know we see our lives lining up with the word that's a wonderful thing but you know many times brothers and sisters as we walk this road that's seldom traveled in this world God won't clown for nobody but I will say this find yourself in an hour of desperation and need call upon the name of the Lord and see if he won't come on the scene he always comes where he's invited he always does and the Bible said they didn't walk with him anymore they left him they just left them they couldn't stand it it was a carnal understanding all they did was get fed up and say this man's crazy all he wants to do is cause us to be cannibals tonight I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters if we ever get discouraged don't worry he does things in the church without explaining it even though he has given us the entirety of the word we're going to spend an eternity living with him having him unveil himself to us reveal himself to us and even through us so when we have things that are confusing here things that maybe we just don't even understand you know what by and by we will in time brother brandham says it in the church age book there will come a time where every single mystery every hidden thing will be shouted from the housetops there will be no Mysteries at that point in terms of human history but when we're living here in this world if we could explain it all we would have no room for Faith there'd be no need for Faith but our walk our Christian walk is all about faith we have got to have faith in him faith of Jesus Christ Living out through US amen and you know where we're going to go tonight is into Corinthians I'm not going to read it yet because we'll uh stand for the reading but you know this is the story of the of the of the communion the Last Supper out of 1 Corinthians chap 11 and uh I I just think it's wonderful because this is the story that we were talking about maybe we could just go right into that now we'll just take the next step if you want to stand with me we'll read this scripture and we'll just get right into the communion service then we'll go into the foot washing and we'll get into the testimonies later if anybody has to go we certainly don't want you to feel trapped we want to make sure that everyone is comfortable but I think it's just a wonderful opportunity to just give the Lord the praise for what he's done I certainly hope he's done something for every single one of us in 1 Corinthians chap 11 we know this is Paul writing to the Corinthians for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and we know this is the story out of Luke 22 and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do she the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily my Bible says in unworthy Manner and I would say it this way without really understanding what's happening without really understanding what we're doing if we're just doing it just because it's a tradition I highly recommend maybe we don't do it just just pass by the communion table but if we're doing it worthily where we understand the gravity of this situation then I think it's wonderful for us he says where verse 27 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man I would say this let a woman let a human a child let us examine ourselves and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup yes for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself right not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's just take a moment or two and just consider our hearts consider where we're at is there anything that we have anything we don't need to have anything to hinder us from this table let's just t one for another Heavenly Father Lord tonight we just thank you for this opportunity Lord Jesus one more time to discern your body father to push aside all of our carnality to push aside all of our human reasoning and to by faith just simply accept your word the way that you've given it to us Lord tonight father we just ask that Lord if there's
