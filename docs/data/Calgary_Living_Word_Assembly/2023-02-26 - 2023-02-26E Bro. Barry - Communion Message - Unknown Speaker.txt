you would sovereignly bless it in the name of Jesus now we just ask that you would bless our service sovereignly tonight father that you yourself would just have your will in your way we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians try not to keep us late here tonight I just want to remind everyone of the annual General men's meeting tomorrow night seven o'clock at the church you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Genesis chapter 14 tonight Genesis chapter 14 we'll start with verse 13. probably a fairly familiar scripture about that fella named Melchizedek I just think it's interesting to look back and see the origins of what we're doing here started somewhere it goes all the way back to Genesis 14 and Abram he wasn't even Abraham yet Genesis 14 verse 13. says and there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plane of mammary the Amorite brother of eschal and brother of Aynor and these were Confederate with Abram and Abram heard that his brother was taken captive armed with his he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto death this is uh Abram going after lot we know lot was captured while lot was misbehaving down in Sodom and Gomorrah we know that Abram separated himself from lot he didn't hear from the Lord for quite a while until he had that separation and now we have circumstances being arranged to pull him back to lot again isn't that interesting and we know that brother Branham says that he pursued them unto Dan and that means the uttermost parts he went the farthest for his brother even though he knew he needed to be separated from him that they had Strife he still went after his brother verse 15 says and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them onto hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the woman also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chador lammer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shava which is the King's Dale and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all and the king of Sodom said unto him give me person the persons and take the goods to thyself and Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latch it and that I will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say I have made Abraham rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the man which went with me Aynor eschel and mamry let them take their portion let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this word we know that it's the only thing that's Eternal heavens and earth will pass away but this word that we've read just now it will remain because it's your word and father tonight we pray that you would just come by here and Quicken it to our bodies Lord to our minds and to our souls as we heard this morning Father we have come to church tonight so that we can get right in our heads and we thank you Father for that idea we thank you for that desire we pray now that you would just help us to get right in our hearts father before we come to this table that we would recognize the magnitude of what we're about to partake of we just ask all these things father in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated how many enjoyed that service this morning my Supernatural Union by faith in The Voice by knowing whose voice it is that truly was speaking to us certainly thankful to see sister Faye back in service thankful for a ever-present tense I am you know what we're talking about tonight and the story of Abram and Melchizedek here in Genesis chapter 14. it can seem like a an interesting story and and it I just find it interesting myself that the king of Sodom went out to meet him and Melchizedek the king of Salem went out to meet him he had an audience of people he was the hero in that day he actually saved the day but you know it's interesting because he tried to spoil him the king of Sodom tried to spoil him tried to say you know what just take everything you want you can have all of the goods we just want the people back and and you know he just wouldn't have it he said no way because you're going to say that you made me Rich you'll be talking to your people and the other kings that are alive and you'll say that it's from your hand and my righteousness only comes from the Lord my blessings only come from above God is my provider he is the one that meets all of my needs according to his riches in Christ Jesus Abram had that Revelation what an incredible Revelation that is we know that Abram he had such a a good relationship with the Lord that the Lord spoke to him called him out we know that brother Branham said that he was a gentile even though this word says here that he was a Hebrew I don't know how you explain that but you can I guess by faith you can believe that he was a Hebrew even though the brother Bradham said he's a gentile but he was called from his own people told to just forget about everything you think you know all of your Traditions all of your family all of your home place just leave them behind and just follow me follow my voice come and see what I've got to show you and took them out and and we know that the the story you know the story they made the sacrifice together he he made the the animals split them apart and laid them out Abram fell into a dark sleep and and a smoking furnace was there and a lamp went in between all of the the carcasses demonstrating the the pillar of fire before it even came but here he was in a situation where he was able to recognize this was God himself speaking to him and it didn't matter what anybody else thought didn't matter what anybody else said to him he followed that voice he had faith in that Supernatural Union by the voice in which he heard he knew who his God was but you know brothers and sisters it takes Revelation to get to that place and Revelation is something that it comes from God it's nothing that we can actually just go out and buy why we can't just go and find Revelation it's got to be from God himself we know that Jesus he asked the disciples who do you say that I am what's the word on the street who are they talking about who is here some said Elias some said Jeremiah are a prophet and then he brought it right down home and that's what it has to be for us today in our lives it's got to come right down to home who do you say that he is who do you say Melchizedek is then it comes even further than that brothers and sisters who do you say you are because if it just stops at Jesus and just stops at Melchizedek if it just stops at brother Branham you've missed the point the whole point is so that we can come to a full recognition of Who We Are then the Rapture will go but you got to have faith in that Supernatural Union I'm just gonna I'm just gonna keep that for a while brother I love that we have to have faith in the voice there has to be a supernatural Union an invisible Union has to take place the whole world will say I could see you you're the same person you've ever been but wait what what's wrong with you there's something wrong with the way you act now you don't talk the same you don't you don't speak the same you don't do the same things it's a supernatural Union something happens and you know what what I'm getting at how do these two come together is that Abram was able to have communion with Melchizedek and brother Bradham says it very clearly we'll get into the quote a little bit later I'm going to try and just do this quickly because I don't really want to keep us here late tonight we've got a lot of service here to fit in but you know brother Branham talks about what it was that happened and and God himself will come and Minister communion to the believer to his children to his bride and I would go even further because we talked about it today we're not going to the marriage we're going to the wedding supper though marriage is right here so in various stages some people are bride and some people are wife some people have had that invisible Union when you've had that invisible Union are you still the bride maybe I want to say your wife we know that Revelation it says that we have reason to rejoice and be very glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come and not his bride has made herself ready his wife hath made herself ready a little bit here like we saw today a little bit there a little bit here a little bit there with stammering licks and lips and other tongues right that's how he does it but here we have this fellow Melchizedek brother Adam talks about him we'll read a little bit in a bit a bit in a bit but melchized a king of Salem he brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and you know some people will say this is a maybe now not a second or a third person but a fourth person this is someone else way out there but like we've been talking about brother Branham he teaches very clearly it's just God changing his mask it's God amorphe it's not another person we can wind up with a bunch of different persons and you know what we don't want to do that we want to make sure that we recognize who this was brother Branham says it this fellow was God and that's all who this fellow was but he came as the king of Salem and he brought forth Bread and Wine he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram can you imagine that Blessed Be Abram of the most high God I think that we can as Believers when we receive this word for our day and we truly have communion with the Lord when we come up here to have communion brothers and sisters don't look at the Deacons don't look at me you have to have it in your heart that you're taking communion from Melchizedek priest of the most high God and remember that he's praying for you here we have to be able to say Blessed Be Your Name of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand because we heard it this morning didn't we hear it this morning I thought it was so good Satan comes to church but brothers and sisters if we're coming to church to have communion with Melchizedek with a priest of the most high God then that Satan is going to get a flogging he's gonna get stuck to the wall until we're done here and then we'll let him go do whatever he wants to do but while we're here he can't touch us and I would go further to say that he can't touch us anyway unless it's appointed of the father and if it is appointed of the father it's going to be for our benefit that's the only reason he's going to have access to us and he blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand blessed be the most high God which have delivered thine enemies into thine hand when you come and take communion remember that's what Melchizedek said to Abram and if you are if you are connected to Abram which you are spiritually speaking if you're a Believer today a gentile believer then you are the spiritual Seed of Abraham not Abraham but Abraham he had a name change and so do we but when that happens brothers and sisters blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he says he gave him tithes of all I heard something this week that just made me chuckle what did what did Melchizedek do because he accepted doesn't say he refused it it says that he accepted it right he gave him tithes of all what did he do with all those camels and sheep what did he do with all those tides I don't know it's an interesting thought hey verse 23 kind of jumps out a little bit too that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latch it and that I will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say I have made Abraham Rich you know what the devil wants us to put our stock in anything but God he wants us to say man that was a good deal you're sharp you're so good at that deal that you made or or or My you got such a good degree look at how how the Lord's blessed you so you could actually obtain the job and earn so much money brothers and sisters if there's any good thing in our life it came from up there it came from him and the only thing that we did was just got up and went forward but so long as we do that he'll bless us along our way like we said to the young people I think it's so important to recognize our the will of God the perfect will of God is not a destination we're not going to say that that the perfect will of God is for me to go out and and have a PhD in in whatever that's not going to be the perfect will of God the perfect will of God is for you to to go forwards and keep his word before your face every single day as you go to get the PHD or as you go to school to be a tradesperson whatever it is you do keep the Lord first that's the perfect will of God it's not going to a specific destination and that's not doing a specific thing although when you march forward God will orchestrate things so that you do go the right way so that you do do the right things so that you are in his perfect will if you keep his word first you know out of Hebrews chapter 7. I just think it's beautiful here Hebrews chapter 7 verse 19. I'll just read it for time's sake for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the witch we draw an eye unto God isn't that beautiful now I just want to go and take a look at this one part here the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did what Hope was that brothers and sisters that was faith faith in the word just jump over to Hebrews chapter 1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen the only way that we're going to get Revelation is to have faith the only way that we're going to have faith is to have Revelation what comes first the faith or the revelation I don't know I think it's the sea Gene of God it gives us access to both I think it's just beautiful I'm just going to cut through some here just so I don't keep us too long I just want to talk about this and if I have one lasting thought tonight it's simply this when we come to the communion table like we've said in the past don't do it if your heart's not right you're better off to just not do it because the word of God says that if we come unrighteously if we don't come according to the will of the word then what happens is many are weak and sickly Among Us because we eat and drink damnation to ourselves if we got something wrong in our heart just don't come just sit in your seat just relax don't worry about it go make it right do whatever you need to do but you know what if you have everything right if your heart condemns you not then you have confidence towards God right and then when you take communion with the Lord Jesus Christ this opens up the access to many blessings in our lives it's not just Health it's not just wealth it's the spiritual revelation of the word for our day and the spiritual Revelation more importantly of Who You Are who is this Melchizedek 1965. I'm just gonna Escape that here from paragraph 105 he says notice after the battle was over after the battle was over not before the battle we don't get it before the battle we gotta fight for every single inch of ground that we get in our Promised Land notice after the battle was over Melchizedek served his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself isn't that interesting here we have Melchizedek in Genesis but it takes all the way through there's a a stopover in Psalms 110 where Melchizedek is topped about but then it goes all the way over to the New Testament after the Old Testament through all the prophets then we have this Melchizedek this fellow turn up again in another body of Flesh named Jesus Christ and what does he do he does the ultimate communion doesn't he and that's what we're here to do tonight to follow his instructions he said do this in remembrance of me and that's why we're here is to remember him from 2000 years ago and from even further as this Melchizedek was brother Branham says notice after the battle is over Melchizedek served his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here and type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of Christ become part of this being you get it the communion the true communion with the Lord it doesn't come for free even though it is a free gift of God he tells us here's the free gift but sometimes you've got to fight through some devil sometimes you got to fight through some Humanity sometimes you got to fight through some traditions but so long as you do that brothers and sisters you fight through all of that junk that you've got to in this life he's waiting there for you at Communion and boy oh boy we want communion every day don't think about commuting necessarily just being at the community table we want communion having that Fellowship every single day every single moment of every day maybe when we start when we go on our knees maybe when we first open our eyes we can start having communion with the Lord when we close our eyes at night after the day is over we can have communion with the Lord in our dreams we can have communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of Christ become part of this being you get it isn't that wonderful you don't stay yourself you're eating his body just like John in Revelations right take eat the book many times we just go Revelations 10 1-7 right but there's an 8 to 11. there's our part that's our identification take the book and heat it up that's the communion we're talking about when you do that you become part of this being you don't just become part of this book you become part of this being this Melchizedek this man this one that we're talking about tonight he goes on to say paragraph uh sorry 106. Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him that's right how many of us can do that how many of us can just wrestle with an angel all night until we get that blessing I think that's just an incredible story but we're not going to stop there tonight He says battled for life and after the battle is over then God gives you of himself that is his true communion he gives you of himself the little bread and wafer it just represents it he's giving you himself but I want to say this and even though he's giving of himself we're coming in commandment of his word his perfect will it might not feel perfect Satan's going to make it feel as awkward as all get out but we're coming in his perfect will to actually represent that part of him in US to receive what he has given us the wafer just represents it he says you shouldn't take it lest you've wrestled it out and become a part of God that's why we say to our children until you've actually been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't don't come to the community table once you've done that you know what you potentially have the Holy Ghost already and some might have it before they get baptized and some might have it after they get baptized that's not for us to say you know the Lord shows you but sometimes we might have a little bit of confusion about that but if you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's open you want to open it up to you he says remember at this time the communion had never been instituted back in Genesis he's talking about not until before the death of Jesus Christ hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today forever he is the same he doesn't change his his operation he doesn't change his pattern isn't that a wonderful thought if we think about it and and start taking and saying well that was for a different age and that was for a different culture and that was for a different tradition maybe a different Community a different time and space then what part of the Bible is applicable but if we can do what the prophet taught us to just simply say you know what this is the absolute and not just say it because he said it but say it because we believe it through Revelation through faith we can say man it truly is it's the first communion after his child Abraham had won the victory I love how brother Branham changes it to Abraham not Abram had won the victory Melchizedek met him and gave him wine and bread showing that after this Earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again it'll be the wedding supper laughs hi he said Jesus said this I will not drink no more of the Vine or eat the fruit until I eat it and drink it with you Anew in my father's kingdom is that right isn't that a wonderful promise when he gave the communion that night the last supper we're going to read it here when he did that he said to them I'm just not going to eat anymore because there's a whole bunch of you that I want to come and partake of this with me I want to partake of this with you isn't it a wonderful thing there's something special about breaking bread with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith he says notice again Melchizedek went to meet Abraham before he got back home what a beautiful type here we have here we have Melchizedek meaning Abraham before he got back home after the battle we meet Jesus in the air before we get home that's right second Thessalonians tells us that before we meet him in the air you know I just was thinking about the the communion and and Revelation and I wasn't gonna but let's turn over to Luke 24. let's just do it quick quick Luke 24. even after The Last Supper after Jesus broke the bread and gave them wine he still had another communion service I'll just start we'll start reading with verse 15 here Luke 24. and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad I wanna and and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered said unto him aren't they only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which have come to pass there in these days and he said unto him what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and and this is Jesus this one they're speaking this too verse 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished when they were early at the Sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and if you remember back into the gospel when they came back and told the rest of the disciples they thought they were mad they said you're telling Idol Tales we don't believe you this is crazy even though this is all that they had been told this was what they were supposed to expect verse 24 and certain of them which were with us went to the Sepulcher and found it even so as the woman had said wow but him they saw not he's then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scripture the things concerning himself and they drew nigh onto the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat at me with them he took bread and blessed it in break and gave it to them and this is you know the beautiful part here brothers and sisters and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said to one another did not our hearts burn within us will he talked to us by the way while he opened to us the scriptures the point I want to get to with this brothers and sisters is Melchizedek himself Jesus Christ the one who had gone and been crucified and then rose again from the dead we heard our Prophet say that this was the same Melchizedek in this quote we read who was this Melchizedek 1965 he explains it very clearly that was God that was God in Melchizedek that was God and Jesus and that was God here but what we're saying that I wanted to get to how did he identify himself and this is the critical key for everyone who might be interested in the message and how Melchizedek and all this could come together you know how he identified himself was by the word and their own testimony verified that but once they had enough word when he prayed it all came together he gave them the Revelation just like he gave Peter because Peter didn't have that Revelation his father in Heaven gave it to him who is the same person it's not persons but the same one gave him that Revelation the same one gave them the Revelation then their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said my didn't our hearts burn within us as he revealed himself to us out of his word if we want a closer walk with him if we want a closer communion with him brothers and sisters this is where it's coming from right here pressing play and reading this word and and having communion with him and the more we do it the closer the communion is going to get to the place where we will be one there will be a union and when that happens you're no longer Twain right Ephesians chapter five the twain become one and that's the great mystery that is Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's his bride Jesus Christ I'm going to stop there God bless you tonight as we come to the communion table tonight I just want to encourage each one of us just uh consider the gravity of it it's not something that we take lightly this is the Lord's body this is Discerning the Lord's body Discerning the body of Believers that we're with and understanding that there can't be anything in our hearts if we're coming to this table we need to make sure that our hearts are good and clean that we've got it straight that we've come to church and we've got our heads straight when we've got our head straight we're going to have our hearts straight when we get our hearts straight you know what it will do it we'll get our heads straight I think that thought is is so beautiful we cannot walk around with a ball and chain dragging around things in our lives dragging around ought against a brother or a sister and come to the communion table and think it's going to be okay you eat and drink damnation to yourself I just want to scream don't do it just go make it right and then come have communion but hey if everything is good then come and have communion have confidence towards the Lord when your heart condemns you not maybe stand with me tonight we'll just turn over to First Corinthians chapter 11 before we take communion we'll just bow in prayer first gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we just thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you Lord that we can have true communion with you Lord Jesus we know that you're you you said through your Prophet that millions and billions of people would be impersonators of Christianity father we just ask that tonight if there's anything in our hearts Lord that condemns us we pray that you would just reveal it to us just now father we pray that you would give us Lord the ability to have constraint if there's something in our lives father that's not right to not come to the table because we will eat and drink damnation to ourselves but Lord father we just ask that if there's anything in our lives that we could ask you to forgive us for this moment we just ask that you would forgive us Lord that you would allow us to come with confidence to this table tonight and father we'll be careful to give you all the praise we just ask that you would bless this portion of our service Lord bless the words that were spoken today this afternoon and tonight we just ask that you would be with us in every aspect of this service as we go forwards now Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen let's start reading with First Corinthians chapter 11. verse 23. as we move into the communion portion of the service for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep or if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come let's just take a couple moments and tarry one for another invite the musician to come play the piano and the brothers to come and serve communion foreign [Music] Lord Jesus tonight we just want to thank you for your goodness to us once again Heavenly Father we pray that Lord as we go forwards we would go forwards with confidence Lord knowing that we don't have condemnation in our heart knowing Lord Jesus that we're not eating and drinking damnation unto ourselves father that we're following your instruction that we can discern your body that we can remember you when we eat the bread that we can remember you when we drink the wine it's your instruction father and we're so thankful that we are willing and able to come forward and do it Lord according to your word we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you it's about our hearts before him our dear lord and
