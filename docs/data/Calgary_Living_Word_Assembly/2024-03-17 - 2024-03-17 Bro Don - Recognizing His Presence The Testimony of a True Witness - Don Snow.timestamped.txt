[59:14] special guest Brother Don snow is going
[59:16] to take the service I just felt
[59:19] extremely impressed on Wednesday to
[59:20] invite our brother to do so we've been
[59:23] talking about him ministering and he's
[59:25] given his witness
[59:26] his testimony a few times but I believe
[59:29] the Lord has put a burden on his heart
[59:30] to preach and you know what I learned
[59:33] early on my pastor taught me is to
[59:35] Simply give the man an opportunity and
[59:38] and it will either come forward or it
[59:40] won't if there's a gift there it will
[59:42] manifest and remember brothers and
[59:44] sisters it's not up to the brother it's
[59:47] up to us we activate the gift whether
[59:51] it's in the worship or whether it's in
[59:52] the preaching of the word it's up to us
[59:55] so if we go to PO in he'll go to
[59:57] preaching and the Lord will do whatever
[59:59] he wants done this morning if we could
[1:00:02] just sing that song Here's my cup Lord I
[1:00:05] I lift it up just as we sang if you have
[1:00:08] a need this morning he's more than able
[1:00:11] and alls we need to do is be willing to
[1:00:13] receive it from him and he certainly
[1:00:15] will pour it out to
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:20] us here's my
[1:00:23] cup
[1:00:24] Lord
[1:00:26] I
[1:00:28] lifted
[1:00:30] up

[1:02:26] I'm just a humble
[1:02:29] dink desired to serve the local
[1:02:32] body I've always been inspired by the
[1:02:36] book of Acts and Steven and he stood one
[1:02:39] day full of faith and Power in the face
[1:02:42] of an Angel and begin to talk about who
[1:02:45] we knew he was yes so under that
[1:02:48] anointing today I pray the Lord visits
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:54] us guess we should start with reading
[1:02:57] your word in our Bible if you can turn
[1:02:59] to John 14
[1:03:03] musicians John 14
[1:03:15] 20-23 you say Amen when we get
[1:03:22] there amen this is the word of the Lord
[1:03:27] amen at that day

[1:03:32] know that I am in my father and ye in
[1:03:37] me and I in you amen hallelujah he that
[1:03:42] hath my Commandments and keepeth them he
[1:03:45] it is that loveth
[1:03:47] me and he that loveth me shall be loved
[1:03:51] of my father amen and I will love
[1:03:54] him and will manifest myself to him
[1:03:58] amen Judas saith unto him not as scariot
[1:04:02] Lord how is it that thou will manifest
[1:04:05] thyself unto us and not unto the
[1:04:08] world and Jesus answers again and he
[1:04:11] says onto him if a man love me he will
[1:04:15] keep my words and my father will love
[1:04:18] him amen and we will come unto him and
[1:04:22] make our Abode with himen man let's just
[1:04:25] bow on word of
[1:04:27] prayer Heavenly Father
[1:04:30] Lord we've gathered together
[1:04:32] Lord in your
[1:04:36] name father we come because we have a
[1:04:39] desire to be fed of
[1:04:42] you father to be drawn closer to you
[1:04:45] Amen to better understand you and our
[1:04:49] relationship to you father so that we
[1:04:52] can stand in this world Lord knowing
[1:04:56] that you promised that you right here in
[1:04:58] this scripture Lord that we would
[1:05:00] know that is our desire father you just
[1:05:03] desire to lift you up we desire to step
[1:05:05] aside Lord and allow you to have your
[1:05:08] way father and Lord if we were to add
[1:05:10] anything that should not be added Lord
[1:05:13] may you close our mouths father Yes Lord
[1:05:15] we just desire to speak about you in
[1:05:17] your written word your revealed word and
[1:05:19] Lord give a testimony of you living out
[1:05:22] your body Lord yes may you bless this
[1:05:25] reading bless this assembly bless me
[1:05:28] father I pray amen amen you may be
[1:05:37] seated amen amen the Lord's good I trust
[1:05:41] you all had a good week probably a
[1:05:43] little bit of a surprise
[1:05:45] today uh I just want you to know I just
[1:05:48] have a real desire to serve the Lord and
[1:05:51] in doing that that means I have a desire
[1:05:53] to serve the Lord's body and he said if
[1:05:55] you love me people will know you love me
[1:05:57] because you love my body and I have a
[1:06:00] sincere love for this body
[1:06:03] here actually for a year I struggled and
[1:06:06] I'm pretty sure brother Barry must have
[1:06:08] been kind of
[1:06:09] confused one week I'd be up and I'd be
[1:06:11] like you know I think I feel led to be a
[1:06:13] deacon and the next week I'd be like no
[1:06:15] I'm moving back to Ontario and it was a
[1:06:17] whole year of struggling with that and
[1:06:20] praying and looking for the leadership
[1:06:22] of the
[1:06:23] Lord and then the Lord just said in our
[1:06:26] heart that this is where we're meant to
[1:06:28] be so we're not here of our own fruition
[1:06:30] we're here because we believe we've been
[1:06:32] LED of God to be
[1:06:34] here and Satan tries to attack that
[1:06:37] sometimes yes he does but then we just
[1:06:38] stand and say Lord we've we're just here
[1:06:41] serving you based on what you've asked
[1:06:43] us to do in our heart
[1:06:45] amen so I'd like to just fellowship with
[1:06:49] you today around the word like I said
[1:06:51] we'll talk about the written word and
[1:06:54] the the revealed word but I really want
[1:06:56] to talk about the living word amen at
[1:07:00] some point this has to come off the page
[1:07:02] and be manifested in their lives amen
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:06] yes the title if you want to put a title
[1:07:09] on it it's called recognizing his
[1:07:13] presence it seems like such a simple
[1:07:15] thing but there's been very few people
[1:07:17] in time that's actually been able to
[1:07:20] recognize his presence right and I guess
[1:07:24] as a subtext it's the test testimony of
[1:07:26] a true witness and we're all called to
[1:07:28] be
[1:07:30] Witnesses and in reading this and going
[1:07:32] through different messages brother
[1:07:34] Brandon preached a message called the
[1:07:36] trial and he talks about that the word
[1:07:38] of God has been put on trial for you
[1:07:41] know the promise of God not being true
[1:07:43] and he he sets up this whole display
[1:07:46] because he had actually just
[1:07:47] fellowshipped with a lawyer and this
[1:07:48] message came on his heart and he
[1:07:51] about the courtroom and the prosecutor
[1:07:53] was Satan and he would told his three
[1:07:56] Witnesses and three Witnesses he named
[1:07:58] them it was Mr doubt or Mr unbelief then
[1:08:02] there was Mr skepticism and the Mr
[1:08:05] impatient and I think at some point in
[1:08:07] all of our Lives we've been guilty of
[1:08:09] maybe succumbing to that a little bit
[1:08:11] but God has always nudges us and it's
[1:08:14] it's normal it's okay it's a part of the
[1:08:16] process but then he calls and he says
[1:08:19] the Holy Ghost defends his word and he
[1:08:20] calls his Witnesses and he talks about
[1:08:23] all the Patriarchs and he brings it
[1:08:24] right down to William Mary and brandom
[1:08:27] and then now we have to put ourselves in
[1:08:29] there yeah we have to give testimony of
[1:08:32] the word not just word and a prophet the
[1:08:34] word the personal relationship we have
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] hallelujah I'd like to just read two
[1:08:43] more scripture and I want the the main
[1:08:45] point is is when we read these
[1:08:46] scriptures Satan tries to use our
[1:08:48] imagination to make these things sound
[1:08:50] so out there and so fantastic and like
[1:08:54] 50 put Jesus when he came they missed
[1:08:56] him the first time because they had a
[1:08:58] totally different idea of what it would
[1:09:01] be CU Satan uses our imagination and in
[1:09:05] here he made a bunch of promises and he
[1:09:07] says you know at that day and the day we
[1:09:09] know is the day of redemption and
[1:09:10] brother brandham said that's the time
[1:09:11] from when he steps forwards and takes
[1:09:13] the book until we receive our body
[1:09:14] change that's the day that we're we're
[1:09:17] living in and then he goes on you know
[1:09:19] like you will know and you'll see
[1:09:21] everything that we talk about here today
[1:09:23] is about this knowing this knowing do we
[1:09:26] truly know and knowing is when you hear
[1:09:30] and you can see you recognize and some
[1:09:33] it's so simple brother Brown tried to
[1:09:35] teach it over and over again that it's
[1:09:37] just so simple God hiding in Simplicity
[1:09:40] and revealing self in the
[1:09:42] same and I've been guilty of many times
[1:09:44] I look back now on my life and God has
[1:09:46] been there now I look back I can see but
[1:09:48] when I was in that moment I couldn't see
[1:09:51] it I didn't recognize that it was God
[1:09:54] okay so I'm just going to read uh Romans
[1:09:56] 8:28 here and he says and we know there
[1:10:00] it is again the knowing we know that all
[1:10:02] things work together for good to them
[1:10:05] that love God and he just said back in
[1:10:07] the previous scripture those that have
[1:10:10] my commandments so you that is also
[1:10:12] message or word and we've received the
[1:10:14] full word of God today so we have do you
[1:10:17] believe you have the Commandments of God
[1:10:20] Amen and he says them that keep
[1:10:24] them
[1:10:25] okay sorry better
[1:10:29] okay and I mean we might check ourselves
[1:10:31] and you know I I keep some of the word
[1:10:34] sometimes kind but no you actually keep
[1:10:36] if you're a true Son of God you keep the
[1:10:38] word you might stumble and fall but God
[1:10:40] comes long and nudging reminder and then
[1:10:43] you you line up with the word that's the
[1:10:45] Walk of a Believer so it says and we
[1:10:47] know that all things work together for
[1:10:50] good to them that love God to them who
[1:10:52] are called according to his purpose amen
[1:10:55] do you believe you're called to his
[1:10:57] purpose today so he said all things all
[1:11:02] things we're going to hit on that
[1:11:04] because there's a lot of times we don't
[1:11:06] feel like it's the blessing of God right
[1:11:08] amen because there's this duality of the
[1:11:11] natural mind versus spiritual
[1:11:14] understanding right but he told us and
[1:11:16] if you say you can amen that then we're
[1:11:18] going to look into it and I hope you can
[1:11:19] still amen it at the end of the service
[1:11:21] today but he said all things and I'm so
[1:11:23] thankful for that
[1:11:25] amen and then in 1 John
[1:11:28] 31-8 you you don't have the turn there
[1:11:30] they might bring it
[1:11:31] up says behold what manner of love the
[1:11:36] father hath bestowed upon us sir and
[1:11:39] that's normally that bestowing is
[1:11:40] through an
[1:11:41] experience should be called the sons of
[1:11:45] God therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:11:49] because it knew him
[1:11:51] not amen
[1:11:53] beloved now
[1:11:56] we are the sons or the children of God
[1:11:59] and I've always wondered about that like
[1:12:00] now what do you mean now actually
[1:12:02] brother Bram taught us that you are
[1:12:03] always a Son of God so any time in your
[1:12:05] life even if you were a sinner in the
[1:12:07] world and you read that you were a Son
[1:12:09] of God you just didn't understand it yet
[1:12:12] right so that always puzzled me what do
[1:12:13] you mean now is there a certain time and
[1:12:16] it's it says now because it's anytime
[1:12:19] you always were he did he just he didn't
[1:12:21] make us Sons we just become placed as
[1:12:23] Sons right amen yes and it does not yet
[1:12:28] appear or made visible what we shall be
[1:12:32] but we know that when he shall
[1:12:36] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[1:12:39] see him as he
[1:12:41] is shall see
[1:12:43] him now what does that mean what do you
[1:12:46] mean I'm going to see you is it is
[1:12:48] corporal body is a I believe it's we're
[1:12:50] going to see them in our brothers and
[1:12:52] sisters in our own life because that is
[1:12:54] the second coming of Christ
[1:12:55] and we'll we'll go into the revealed
[1:12:57] word and talk about that and bring it
[1:13:00] out but it's we said we shall see him
[1:13:02] and I'm going to ask you do you see him
[1:13:04] today do you see him and where do you
[1:13:07] see him
[1:13:11] amen and every man hath this hope in him
[1:13:16] they Pur pures himself which means wash
[1:13:18] away himself even as he is pure amen
[1:13:22] whosoever committeth sin transgresses
[1:13:24] also the law
[1:13:25] for sin is the transgression of the law
[1:13:28] and ye know that he was manifest to take
[1:13:31] away the sins of the world and no and in
[1:13:35] him is no
[1:13:36] sin whosoever abideth or keep going or
[1:13:41] continue on and we know that's the
[1:13:43] struggle as some Satan tries to think
[1:13:45] we're saved one day and lost the other
[1:13:46] but if you're able to continue on or
[1:13:48] abide in him sinth not whosoever sinth
[1:13:53] hath not seen him so there's this
[1:13:56] Duality now of seeing him versus
[1:13:57] unseeing him and whether or not you
[1:14:00] sin neither know him little children let
[1:14:02] no man deceive you he that and this is
[1:14:06] the key to not being deceived he that
[1:14:08] doeth righteousness is
[1:14:11] righteous even as he is righteous he
[1:14:14] that committeth sin is of the devil for
[1:14:16] the devil sinth from the beginning for
[1:14:19] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:14:21] manifested that he may destroy the works
[1:14:24] of the devil I do want to go into that
[1:14:26] because brother brandham said that's
[1:14:27] what he did in his first coming and
[1:14:29] there's a quote I have he says that's
[1:14:31] what he does in his second coming in us
[1:14:32] and it's like what does that what does
[1:14:34] that mean that he's going to destroy the
[1:14:36] works of the devil amen but also taking
[1:14:40] into consideration all things work
[1:14:42] together for the good amen
[1:14:45] amen so I just want to read a quote here
[1:14:49] and just keep in mind about God taught
[1:14:52] us through William Bram that Up Is Down
[1:14:55] down he taught us that God's ways are
[1:14:58] far beyond man's ways right and that
[1:15:02] perfect weakness equals perfect strength
[1:15:05] amen so there's I just want I want to
[1:15:07] stand here today there's this quote uh
[1:15:10] that brother branom gives us and it says
[1:15:12] now a testimony before a person has a
[1:15:15] person has to have an experience before
[1:15:17] they can testify yeah if you were called
[1:15:20] in court you'd have to as give a
[1:15:23] testimony you have to know something
[1:15:25] something before you can testify that's
[1:15:27] right and a witness is a person who has
[1:15:30] seen something that knows that it is the
[1:15:33] truth and they are called to give
[1:15:36] witness and then a witness must know
[1:15:39] what he is talking about he must not be
[1:15:43] someone told me a certain certain
[1:15:47] thing now that statement right there the
[1:15:51] thought is we can't just par it while
[1:15:55] brother brandham said we have to have
[1:15:58] the same
[1:15:59] experience okay
[1:16:01] amen there's a time for that and it's a
[1:16:04] part of the growth process but I'm not
[1:16:06] here today just living off William
[1:16:08] bram's experience I've met the god of
[1:16:11] William Brown
[1:16:14] amen says he must be the witness himself
[1:16:18] or herself if not he is speaking of
[1:16:21] someone else that could be a witness on
[1:16:24] the scene so amen like so where you
[1:16:27] stand here today and I was looking it up
[1:16:29] and the just the the percentage like
[1:16:32] there's 25% of the world is Muslim and
[1:16:36] then it was uh 15.7 million were Jews
[1:16:39] and uh only half of that was actually in
[1:16:42] Israel and then the Believers it says
[1:16:44] that there's about two to four million
[1:16:47] Believers so I take the average three
[1:16:49] and I divide it by 8 billion that means
[1:16:50] that there's a
[1:16:53] 0.375% chance of you even sitting here
[1:16:56] today and claiming to be a witness of
[1:16:58] the Living God like that just blew me
[1:17:00] away right and he even said that a that
[1:17:03] group there there will be a group that
[1:17:04] goes into the bride into the Rapture
[1:17:07] amen so like I said I just want to
[1:17:09] Fellowship around the written word the
[1:17:12] revealed word and then talk about an
[1:17:14] experience that really really made me
[1:17:18] come to know who I am in God and we're
[1:17:22] going to talk a little bit about godhead
[1:17:23] and maybe even marriage and divorce but
[1:17:25] it's it's an experience that I want want
[1:17:27] to talk about amen uh there's this quote
[1:17:31] here and it's out
[1:17:33] of the spoken words The Original Seed
[1:17:36] okay and this is going to sound really
[1:17:38] deep but I want you to remember that
[1:17:40] that sometimes is just our imagination
[1:17:42] and we make things seem bigger than it
[1:17:44] really
[1:17:45] is now here is what I'm trying to say to
[1:17:48] you the law of reproduction bring forth
[1:17:52] of its kind Genesis 1:11
[1:17:55] these last days true church Bride Comes
[1:17:59] To The Headstone will be the Super
[1:18:03] Church a super race as the nears the
[1:18:08] great headstone they will be much like
[1:18:10] him so much like him even they will be
[1:18:12] in his very image Amen in order to be
[1:18:15] United with
[1:18:16] him they will be
[1:18:19] one they will be the very manifestation
[1:18:23] of the word of the Living God
[1:18:25] am do you believe
[1:18:28] that do you feel super today like when I
[1:18:33] think see like we watched cartoons and
[1:18:34] things that when we were kids and we're
[1:18:35] led to think now it leads us down this
[1:18:37] path of Superman and things like that
[1:18:40] but what does that really mean what does
[1:18:41] it mean to be a super race and a super
[1:18:44] church and to manifest the word of God
[1:18:47] it's just a tremendous statement when
[1:18:49] you stop and think and I know all these
[1:18:51] scriptures and quotes that we're going
[1:18:52] to talk about they're all well known to
[1:18:54] us
[1:18:55] but sometimes we just need to stop and
[1:18:57] meditate them and say Lord what does
[1:18:59] this really mean amen and can I expect
[1:19:01] it in my life and then it creates a
[1:19:04] desire in you and then you go about
[1:19:06] trying it says with all diligence and
[1:19:08] Dil means thr you throw everything that
[1:19:09] you have that you know how to serve God
[1:19:12] to try and make it come to pass and you
[1:19:13] know what happens you fall flat on your
[1:19:15] face amen but that's how God does things
[1:19:19] and then you try again and try again
[1:19:20] finally you get to realize I can't make
[1:19:23] this work amen and you get desperate and
[1:19:26] then you cry out to God and then God
[1:19:28] comes on the scene amen we've seen it we
[1:19:31] can all testify and witness of it but
[1:19:33] it's for a purpose and we Overlook it we
[1:19:37] make it sound so simple but it's the
[1:19:39] literal The Living Word in our day the
[1:19:42] very manifestation of God Amen and here
[1:19:46] comes the battle so here's out of the
[1:19:48] church ages the re uh revelation of
[1:19:50] Jesus Christ and it's Satan he says he
[1:19:52] knows that if the people get the true
[1:19:56] revelation of the true church what she
[1:20:00] is what she stands for and that she can
[1:20:03] do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:20:06] invincible
[1:20:07] Army do you feel like an invincible Army
[1:20:10] today but you are the word of God says
[1:20:12] you are there's certain manifestations
[1:20:15] of it and we'll talk about it if they
[1:20:17] get a true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:20:19] within the framework of the Christian
[1:20:21] church so now we can take that and we
[1:20:24] know
[1:20:25] there's a body but then he also said the
[1:20:27] individuals a temple and a church amen
[1:20:30] so honestly you you need to get a
[1:20:32] revelation of that the two Spirits
[1:20:34] actually can work within you yes and you
[1:20:36] need to be aware of
[1:20:38] it and by God's spirit discern and
[1:20:42] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:20:45] will be powerless before her amen that
[1:20:47] is the the word of God now the question
[1:20:50] is it's it sounds so out there it sounds
[1:20:57] too too much to even comprehend with
[1:20:59] your mind and you can't comprehend that
[1:21:01] with your mind you can't it's got to be
[1:21:03] a revelation in your
[1:21:05] heart but he keeps saying over and over
[1:21:07] again the true Revelation the true
[1:21:09] church and and the true thing and
[1:21:11] brother brandham taught us that true is
[1:21:14] not in stark contrast to false so in
[1:21:17] this world Satan tries to teach us that
[1:21:20] this is true and that all the way over
[1:21:24] here
[1:21:25] is false but brother Bram taught us that
[1:21:29] that's true right
[1:21:32] here and this is false amen one word off
[1:21:37] so how how can we even go about living
[1:21:41] that you need his life in you like he
[1:21:45] promised
[1:21:49] amen another quote and like I said I I
[1:21:51] want to go through these quotes and then
[1:21:53] we'll talk about the
[1:21:56] experience another quote here just to
[1:21:58] back up the point and it's from the
[1:22:01] spoken words Original Seed now Christ
[1:22:05] was manifested to destroy the works of
[1:22:08] the devil you believe thaten now I can't
[1:22:12] explain all this I'm just going to go
[1:22:14] through it just quickly now hit the high
[1:22:17] place so you won't stay too long Christ
[1:22:19] was manifested destroy the works of the
[1:22:22] devil is that right congregation says
[1:22:25] amen you all believe that that's why he
[1:22:28] why what was he God's word which
[1:22:32] destroys the works of the hybrid the
[1:22:35] devil so the mixing the one the one word
[1:22:38] Satan is a master at at doing and
[1:22:41] actually before I gave to my heart to
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:44] Lord I was a liar and I learned that at
[1:22:47] a young
[1:22:48] age you could mix as long as 99% true
[1:22:52] not lying to my parents lying to
[1:22:53] everyone around around me it was
[1:22:55] actually a spirit that came down through
[1:22:56] my grandfather I got real close to him
[1:23:00] and I used to ask him and I I gravitate
[1:23:03] towards old people and I asked them you
[1:23:04] know if you could go back to yourself
[1:23:06] when you're 18 whatever age I was at the
[1:23:08] time I said what would you tell yourself
[1:23:09] what would you do and I would get their
[1:23:11] advice of what they would and I said you
[1:23:13] know what what is your struggle in life
[1:23:15] what is it that's the thorn in your
[1:23:16] flesh and my grandfather who's passed on
[1:23:19] he says two things he goes I always had
[1:23:22] a to resist stealing he he had to steal
[1:23:25] at that at some point to actually feed
[1:23:26] his 13 kids and he said lying so then I
[1:23:30] thought okay like okay maybe that's
[1:23:32] where I get it because I was a liar and
[1:23:35] even still sometimes I have to fight
[1:23:37] against that it's so easy to sit there
[1:23:39] and just tell a little white lie in that
[1:23:41] but it's still a lie right
[1:23:45] amen now where was I uh Christ was
[1:23:49] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:23:51] devil you believe that amen so con
[1:23:53] congregation says all you believe that
[1:23:55] that's why and then he says the hybrid
[1:23:57] the devil is that right he was he was
[1:24:00] done to do that he was born to be that
[1:24:04] to destroy the works of the
[1:24:07] devil now his body is to do the
[1:24:12] same Amen to destroy the works or the
[1:24:16] acts of the devil because the body is
[1:24:19] head and body is together that's right
[1:24:22] if Christ was the head was the word his
[1:24:25] body has to be the same thing as head
[1:24:28] was that's right a church of the word
[1:24:32] born of the word virgin born from the
[1:24:34] word not denominational virgin born from
[1:24:38] the word amen the way the body operates
[1:24:42] is by the head that's right so you have
[1:24:44] to be United with this mind of Christ
[1:24:47] and you're going to operate I looked up
[1:24:48] the word operate and it means to perform
[1:24:50] a function or exert power or influence
[1:24:54] to produce an appropriate
[1:24:57] effect amen and if we look back at
[1:25:00] Christ even though he was God Of Heaven
[1:25:02] and Earth he came down in the form of a
[1:25:05] man he humbled
[1:25:07] himself and he sacrificed himself and he
[1:25:11] served that was the mind of Christ and
[1:25:14] so many times we go we want to read
[1:25:15] about the mind of Christ and say yeah he
[1:25:18] was all powerful but it goes he went and
[1:25:21] he gave himself and we are to reflect
[1:25:24] that and we try and do that in our own
[1:25:26] ability but we can't amen but when the
[1:25:29] Holy Ghost comes it's the first thing
[1:25:31] you want to do hallelujah
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] sometimes and this is what happened to
[1:25:38] me is you'll sacrifice to serve the
[1:25:41] local body but you neglect your own
[1:25:44] family amen we'll get into that but God
[1:25:47] is gracious and God is good
[1:25:50] amen so one more quote here
[1:25:55] and it's from Christ is the mystery of
[1:25:57] God revealed says
[1:25:59] look Christ in you makes him the center
[1:26:05] of life of the Revelation see Christ's
[1:26:09] life in you makes him the center of the
[1:26:12] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:26:16] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[1:26:19] Christ in you makes you the complete
[1:26:22] revelation of the whole thing
[1:26:24] see what God is trying to do this is the
[1:26:28] Revelation this is what he's trying to
[1:26:29] get into us and how he does it is
[1:26:32] through trials and tribulations and
[1:26:34] we'll get into it what is the new birth
[1:26:37] then you'd say well brother Bram what is
[1:26:39] the new birth it is the revelation of
[1:26:43] Jesus Christ personally to
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:49] you once you experience that everything
[1:26:53] changes
[1:26:55] Hallelujah you look at the written word
[1:26:57] differently you look at the revealed
[1:26:58] word differently you look at your
[1:27:00] brothers differently you look at
[1:27:01] yourself differently the whole godhead
[1:27:04] changes you finally get the true
[1:27:05] revelation of the godhead and you are a
[1:27:08] part of him you can't lift yourself up
[1:27:11] there
[1:27:12] amen amen see not you joined a church
[1:27:15] you shook a hand you done something
[1:27:17] different you set a Creed and promis to
[1:27:20] live by a code of rules and so many
[1:27:22] people have made this message m a code
[1:27:24] of rules and a code of way the live
[1:27:26] legalism us
[1:27:28] Lord but Christ the Bible he is the word
[1:27:32] that was revealed to you amen and no
[1:27:36] matter what anybody else says what takes
[1:27:39] place it's Christ amen Pastor priest
[1:27:43] whatever it might be it's Christ in you
[1:27:46] that is the Revelation that the church
[1:27:48] was built
[1:27:49] upon
[1:27:51] amen thank you Lord amen
[1:27:55] it's Amen it sounds so big and grander
[1:28:00] and it's just so simple so simple
[1:28:03] brother bradam saw God everywhere in
[1:28:05] nature everywhere you did he did even
[1:28:08] his own enemies he looked to see at
[1:28:10] least what common ground do we have what
[1:28:12] part of the word can I at least agree
[1:28:14] with them and fellowship
[1:28:16] on when I first gave my heart to the
[1:28:19] Lord when I was 18 19 years
[1:28:22] old I was baptized
[1:28:26] excuse me
[1:28:30] and
[1:28:32] Sanctified and I had a real desire to
[1:28:34] serve God with all my
[1:28:38] heart and I loved them and I studied and
[1:28:41] I did everything but it was still that
[1:28:43] mental Faith space that we all go
[1:28:47] through and I couldn't understand I
[1:28:49] wanted to be perfect I wanted to reflect
[1:28:53] God in my life life and I would
[1:28:54] constantly stumble and fall at certain
[1:28:56] things not understanding you not having
[1:28:58] the wisdom and understanding true
[1:29:00] Grace so one day I'd be up one day I'd
[1:29:03] be down in and
[1:29:05] out and I'd build all my faith based on
[1:29:08] my ability to keep God's word and when
[1:29:10] I'd fail I it would just knock me right
[1:29:12] back down to ground zero and then you'd
[1:29:14] start all over again so then I got a
[1:29:17] critical spirit on me and I started only
[1:29:19] seeing the worst in people my own
[1:29:21] brothers and sisters in the church to
[1:29:22] justify my oh look oh look what they're
[1:29:24] wearing how could they wear that dress
[1:29:25] how could they do that how could they do
[1:29:27] that Lord and it got to the point where
[1:29:30] I couldn't even go to church because
[1:29:31] there were such condemnation in my
[1:29:34] heart but that was God's grace to me but
[1:29:37] I didn't understand it at that time but
[1:29:39] all things work together for them that
[1:29:41] love
[1:29:43] God so I ran away from church I stopped
[1:29:45] going I couldn't go in through those
[1:29:47] doors I was still a Son of God and I
[1:29:49] knew that I wasn't right but because of
[1:29:51] Pride and ego and I was still young in
[1:29:53] the Lord
[1:29:55] so I stopped going to church and it's
[1:29:57] amazing that says the first thing Satan
[1:29:59] tries to get you to do is separate
[1:30:01] yourself
[1:30:03] right amen if you
[1:30:07] ever Satan tries to get you to separate
[1:30:09] yourself do the opposite don't go down
[1:30:11] the road I went 15 years
[1:30:15] backsliding assemble yourself go to your
[1:30:17] pastor talk to them expose it says
[1:30:20] resist
[1:30:22] it God has a way
[1:30:26] amen but I got a real critical spirit I
[1:30:28] ran away and then it got to the point
[1:30:30] where I couldn't even go pump gas or get
[1:30:32] groceries I'd bump into a Believer and
[1:30:34] then there that condom that just a very
[1:30:36] presence and knowing what they stood for
[1:30:39] right and knowing that I couldn't told
[1:30:42] that line so then I ran away at
[1:30:45] West I tried to say that it was because
[1:30:47] I wanted to come and make money to
[1:30:49] provide for my family but really it was
[1:30:51] I just didn't want to be around that
[1:30:53] present cuz that brought such
[1:30:54] condemnation to
[1:30:57] me
[1:31:01] Amen in those 15 years of being out
[1:31:05] here the woman that I
[1:31:08] love that God gave to
[1:31:10] me brother bram's wife was specially
[1:31:13] made for him and my wife is specially
[1:31:15] made for me your wife is specially made
[1:31:17] for you amen if you married her based on
[1:31:21] Revelation she is you your flesh and and
[1:31:24] bone of each other amen Amen brother
[1:31:28] Satan tries to get us to divorce that
[1:31:30] part of
[1:31:31] ourselves and the true Revelation is you
[1:31:33] actually have to divorce the old man
[1:31:35] nature that's actually creating that
[1:31:38] confence we get into that more I didn't
[1:31:41] know I'd get into it this early but
[1:31:43] that's the revelation of it there's we
[1:31:45] want to kill the old man and we desire
[1:31:48] to do
[1:31:49] it but it's not lying in our ability
[1:31:53] it's got ACC come at the right time by
[1:31:56] the word and be done
[1:31:57] correctly and that's the amazing thing
[1:31:59] of it is we get a desire to do things
[1:32:02] just like Abraham Abraham met God after
[1:32:05] the great trial he was there and lot
[1:32:07] left them and he was left with the the
[1:32:09] dry piece of land he tilled away and
[1:32:10] tilled Away brother Bram says that he
[1:32:12] met Elohim underneath the oak tree after
[1:32:14] that great
[1:32:17] trial and then he was given the promise
[1:32:19] that your son and what's the first thing
[1:32:22] Abraham did took it and mixed
[1:32:25] it and he made a hybrid ishmail and
[1:32:28] we've all I've produced ish mailes in my
[1:32:30] life spiritually we all have it's just a
[1:32:33] part of the the process Abraham is the
[1:32:36] father of
[1:32:37] faith and we reflect the same on
[1:32:39] fortunately in us but it's all to God's
[1:32:41] will and his
[1:32:44] purpose says no matter what anyone says
[1:32:46] he says now this is talking about the
[1:32:48] godhead now you're actually seeing that
[1:32:50] you and God are one that you're his son
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:54] despite all the corruption and that's
[1:32:56] the amazing thing like you look back
[1:32:57] through time and
[1:33:00] it's I want to say that God has a sense
[1:33:02] of humor and we know he does the prophet
[1:33:04] says he does but like Moses Moses was
[1:33:09] for ordained to be the mouthpiece of
[1:33:11] God but he have speech impediment he
[1:33:14] stuttered because God wants you to see
[1:33:17] that it's him right so then we go and
[1:33:23] brother was able to take this idea and
[1:33:26] he said that I mean who in the world
[1:33:27] ever thought that Samson was a dwarf but
[1:33:30] he was able to look at how God does
[1:33:32] things so while he was a mighty Minister
[1:33:34] then he must have been a dwarf amen here
[1:33:37] we are
[1:33:39] again we take brother
[1:33:41] Brown no education but brought the
[1:33:43] greatest
[1:33:45] Ministry the world's ever seen there
[1:33:47] with Paul him and Paul but he was an
[1:33:50] uneducated
[1:33:52] Backwoods there it is again God's just
[1:33:54] not sharing his glory with anyone but
[1:33:56] showing hey I'm going to do
[1:33:58] this now what about you yeah amen he
[1:34:02] said that you're perfect virtuous
[1:34:05] spotless Hallelujah meanwhile you have
[1:34:07] all this corruption moving within your
[1:34:09] members but that's who you are it's him
[1:34:12] in you isn't that just
[1:34:15] amazing that you're weaknesses are there
[1:34:18] so that God can express himself amen
[1:34:21] right so amen you just got to overcome
[1:34:24] them by the word approach them according
[1:34:26] to the word and we desire I know we all
[1:34:29] do it's the same of me like Lord I don't
[1:34:31] want this I don't want this I don't want
[1:34:34] this and he just says I'm going to take
[1:34:38] care of it in due time amen just keep
[1:34:40] moving forward you got to grow up
[1:34:41] there's a process amen
[1:34:45] amen there's
[1:34:47] uh something that's always amazed me and
[1:34:50] brother brandham talked about this so
[1:34:53] many times almost every almost every
[1:34:56] sermon he gave he talked about the woman
[1:34:57] at the well Samaritan and it just seems
[1:35:01] so innocent here he was talking at the
[1:35:03] well give me a water and
[1:35:07] everything and uh let's read it I'll
[1:35:10] I'll turn there maybe I'll get settled
[1:35:12] down a little bit I'm really a little
[1:35:14] bit
[1:35:15] nervous I'll I'll read it it says John
[1:35:18] 14:
[1:35:21] 21-26 Jesus said onto Heroman believe
[1:35:24] me the hour cometh when ye shall neither
[1:35:28] in this
[1:35:29] mountain nor yet at is at Jerusalem
[1:35:32] worship the father ye worship ye know
[1:35:36] not what we know what we worship for
[1:35:40] salvations of the Jews but the hour
[1:35:42] cometh and now is when the true
[1:35:45] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:35:47] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:35:50] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[1:35:52] spirit and they that that worship Him
[1:35:54] must worship Him in spirit and Truth
[1:35:56] amen the woman saith unto him I know
[1:36:00] that Messiah or Messiah cometh which is
[1:36:03] called
[1:36:04] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[1:36:07] all things Jesus sayith unto her it's I
[1:36:11] that speak unto thee am he amen seems so
[1:36:16] simple but when we read other things it
[1:36:19] seems like it's so Grand brother Bram
[1:36:21] I'll read a quote here but this was
[1:36:22] actually the second the first coming
[1:36:26] this was the start of it amen now if we
[1:36:29] take this and we compare it to Nicodemus
[1:36:33] and it's in John
[1:36:35] 313 and it says there was a man of the
[1:36:38] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:36:40] Jews the same came to Jesus by night so
[1:36:42] see how he approached God in the shadows
[1:36:44] and by night didn't really want to be to
[1:36:46] be seen and in the other one Jesus saw
[1:36:48] her he said I actually have to go by
[1:36:50] this way for a purpose see the
[1:36:51] difference it's brother around said no
[1:36:54] man ever ever seek God it's God seeking
[1:36:57] his
[1:36:58] amen came to him by
[1:37:01] night and said unto him
[1:37:04] Rabbi see the difference he recognized
[1:37:06] him as Rabbi she called him
[1:37:09] Messiah see the difference and we're
[1:37:12] talking about recognizing presence of
[1:37:14] God Amen we know that thou art a teacher
[1:37:17] from God for no man can do these
[1:37:19] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:37:22] with him wasn't just with him he was God
[1:37:25] that's when she called him Messiah she
[1:37:28] re you are
[1:37:31] God Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:37:33] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:37:35] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:37:38] kingdom of God kingdom of God was
[1:37:40] standing right there in front of him
[1:37:42] right there his whole life was devoted
[1:37:45] to the scriptures
[1:37:47] amen and the very thing that they served
[1:37:50] and believe said they believ was
[1:37:52] standing and they didn't even recognize
[1:37:54] him amen and here's an ill- famed
[1:37:57] woman Glory by well do you see yourself
[1:38:01] in her yes sir
[1:38:03] Hallelujah just doing her daily routine
[1:38:06] and he comes by yes
[1:38:09] sir and she recognized him in the most
[1:38:12] mundane
[1:38:13] thing and the recognize means you had an
[1:38:15] affiliation before that's right she was
[1:38:18] for ored hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:38:22] now you just come be he's bringing back
[1:38:24] to our remembrance so I'll read the
[1:38:25] quote
[1:38:27] here it was really hard for me because
[1:38:30] I've had so many quotes and everything
[1:38:32] and the Lord really helped me narrow
[1:38:33] this down and focus
[1:38:36] it says this is out of the Mighty God
[1:38:38] unveiled before us and he preached like
[1:38:41] you go back when you when you're
[1:38:43] studying something I've learned is you
[1:38:44] go back and see where he preached the
[1:38:45] same thing and you can see the evolution
[1:38:47] even his Revelation grew more and more
[1:38:51] as you read the word of God and you get
[1:38:52] a revelation it opens up and then you
[1:38:54] see you can go back to read the same
[1:38:56] message a thousand times and get a
[1:38:57] thousand different it keeps growing it's
[1:38:59] an eternal word am so dig into the word
[1:39:02] the word is alive not only in us but you
[1:39:05] have to feed on it amen I I can't get
[1:39:08] enough of it to be honest with you I
[1:39:10] can't I'm not saying that try sounds
[1:39:12] super spiritual I just can't get enough
[1:39:14] of it but just listen to this experience
[1:39:17] here he says now what did this do
[1:39:19] putting the old scripture which is was
[1:39:22] the prophecy
[1:39:24] with the
[1:39:26] experience that Jesus was giving to her
[1:39:29] what did it do it made the
[1:39:32] Messiah the fact that she recognized him
[1:39:35] as the Messiah made him the Messiah
[1:39:38] brother brandham taught us that God is
[1:39:40] limited by the law of faith and and we
[1:39:43] he says the amazing thing is the
[1:39:44] attribute of a God he says what makes
[1:39:46] God is that he believes his own word and
[1:39:48] you're a child of God Amen and in the
[1:39:51] day that you live you believe your own
[1:39:54] word that who you truly are it's not
[1:39:57] this right here this is just a a vessel
[1:39:59] that I'm trapped in brother BR said we
[1:40:01] haven't even truly seen each other but
[1:40:03] we have Fellowship when we get around
[1:40:05] the word amen but it was he wasn't even
[1:40:08] a messiah unless someone recognized them
[1:40:09] as Messiah and called upon them because
[1:40:11] now we're talking
[1:40:13] relationship everything is all about
[1:40:15] relationships in your day what is the
[1:40:17] message what is promised to you and what
[1:40:20] relationship or what rights do you have
[1:40:22] to lay claim to God and what can you
[1:40:24] expect in your life and the True
[1:40:25] Believers will recognize it and then
[1:40:27] they'll go to Desiring it amen and then
[1:40:30] it'll come to pass but it requires your
[1:40:32] faith your desire that's just how simple
[1:40:34] it
[1:40:35] is that's that's it like when brother
[1:40:38] Bram that that Vision that they were he
[1:40:41] was supposed to kill a caribou and a
[1:40:43] bear and they were getting worried and
[1:40:45] the people were like oh it's not going
[1:40:46] to happen not going to happen and it
[1:40:47] always astounded me what brother brandom
[1:40:49] said he goes they just walked into it
[1:40:52] the reality
[1:40:54] but we always try and make something
[1:40:55] happen let me go do this and brother
[1:40:57] brand calls us he goes CHR Christianity
[1:40:59] Today is just a bunch of do Goods we
[1:41:01] just want to be nice humble Christians
[1:41:03] and it's fake piety is what it is and
[1:41:05] we're guilty of it too but that's
[1:41:08] okay but we're just gonna continue
[1:41:11] you're a true Son of God you're going to
[1:41:12] line up to the word for your day amen
[1:41:15] now brother Brown talked about the
[1:41:16] calvinist for
[1:41:18] extreme election believers they they you
[1:41:20] could do whatever you want I'm a sign
[1:41:22] the Holy Spirit brings balance Perfect
[1:41:26] Balance I was so out of balance I didn't
[1:41:29] realize it that I received the Holy
[1:41:31] Ghost and he started balancing me
[1:41:34] amen and as husbands I'll just say this
[1:41:37] something that the Lord revealed to me
[1:41:39] is that we want so many I've seen it my
[1:41:41] whole life and and in the message and
[1:41:43] it's a part of it and it's a part of the
[1:41:45] growing up of the message but as
[1:41:47] husbands we would always just stand
[1:41:49] there and be I'm the lion I'm the king
[1:41:52] of my home home you have to you have to
[1:41:54] serve
[1:41:58] me but also you have to be the ox it's
[1:42:02] the balance actually I was
[1:42:04] fellowshipping with brother Barry and we
[1:42:05] were I was talking about this he said
[1:42:07] have you seen this and it was the
[1:42:09] Tabernacle in the wilderness the Holy
[1:42:11] Ghost was in the middle and over here is
[1:42:14] the ox or the the lion and right
[1:42:18] opposite of it is the ox why do you
[1:42:20] think that is they balance each other
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:23] if you truly want to be the king then
[1:42:25] you sacrifice yourself for your family
[1:42:27] and they will reverence you it's in them
[1:42:30] to do it you don't have to take it
[1:42:32] that's
[1:42:34] right lion and Ox got to go together
[1:42:37] don't be off this way or off this way
[1:42:39] amen the other way face of man and that
[1:42:42] was the reformers it was just amazing
[1:42:44] Enlightenment understand and we could go
[1:42:47] and we could be studying the word and we
[1:42:49] get this and we get and it's just it's
[1:42:50] such illumination the average believer
[1:42:54] today we could take one of our kids in
[1:42:56] our assembly and what they've learned of
[1:42:58] the message would Astound most
[1:43:00] theologians in the world what they know
[1:43:02] truly and that's great but it's balanced
[1:43:05] by the Flying Eagle divine
[1:43:08] revelation don't be off to and sometimes
[1:43:11] and I've been guilty of it that you're
[1:43:12] way over here bless God I'm being re and
[1:43:15] I'm no worly good to my family so the
[1:43:18] Holy Ghost but brings balance to all
[1:43:20] these things just stay centered and if
[1:43:23] you're not centered God will reveal it
[1:43:25] to you and he'll tell you how to go
[1:43:26] about fixing it and it's more of him as
[1:43:28] what it is
[1:43:29] amen but back here here it's just
[1:43:32] astounding that the greatest of the
[1:43:35] Sadducees and Pharisees is standing
[1:43:37] there face to face with the Living Word
[1:43:40] and no idea they actually called them be
[1:43:45] right so we have to guard and protect
[1:43:48] what we led into ourselves and what we
[1:43:51] what we feed on because it can
[1:43:53] contaminate the understanding of the
[1:43:56] word but it's all in recognizing brother
[1:43:59] Brown preached so many messages about
[1:44:00] the presence of a God unrecognized and
[1:44:03] the counterbalance to that is I have
[1:44:05] heard but now I see and brother amen we
[1:44:08] can listen to the tapes and it's good
[1:44:11] and and that's what amazes me right now
[1:44:13] is that there's such a push push you
[1:44:15] know push
[1:44:17] play that doesn't align with the
[1:44:19] revelation of my heart the revelation of
[1:44:20] my heart is the voes left that and it
[1:44:23] fellowships with me every day I'm but I
[1:44:26] go back to the umum thund which is that
[1:44:28] book and that tape and it lines
[1:44:30] perfectly and if it doesn't align I
[1:44:32] leave it amen amen that's just how
[1:44:35] simple it is but to just say you just
[1:44:37] listen to the prophet listen to The
[1:44:38] Prophet this word didn't just come to
[1:44:40] live in a prophet he introduced
[1:44:44] something he was to
[1:44:46] forun amen I don't truly understand it
[1:44:49] how we can go backwards like
[1:44:51] that but it's just the way God does
[1:44:54] things and there's those that are called
[1:44:56] to see it and some that aren't that's
[1:44:57] just how it is and all we can truly do
[1:45:00] is stay true to the revelation of our
[1:45:02] heart walk in it live it let it live in
[1:45:05] us as much as we can and if there's any
[1:45:07] election in anyone around us they'll
[1:45:09] gravitate to that Amen brother brandham
[1:45:12] talked about Enoch being the perfect
[1:45:15] type of the bride and there's about
[1:45:18] eight places he talks about Jonah Noah
[1:45:21] sorry Noah being actually alive at the
[1:45:23] same time and if you go sometimes I'll
[1:45:26] go and just look and see what the
[1:45:27] theologians think about it and they have
[1:45:30] no idea they thought thought Enoch was
[1:45:32] dead 500 years before but the prophet
[1:45:34] told us that they were alive on the
[1:45:35] earth at the same time and it was his
[1:45:38] grandfather and he actually and we know
[1:45:40] that Noah also types the True Believer
[1:45:43] right but the perfect representation is
[1:45:46] Enoch and Enoch had this testimony that
[1:45:48] he just walked with God and pleased him
[1:45:51] and he actually said and you can go look
[1:45:54] it up in the message he says it two
[1:45:56] different ways he says Noah was watching
[1:45:59] Enoch are you on Enoch today are you the
[1:46:01] perfect Living Word of God Amen do you
[1:46:04] have a testimony that you know in your
[1:46:06] heart you please God
[1:46:08] Amen he said Noah who he types he says
[1:46:11] it the remnant of the Jews and the
[1:46:13] foolish virgin that's the the true the
[1:46:16] fool he says every word you know has a
[1:46:18] compound meeting compound Revelation but
[1:46:20] he said Noah was watching Enoch and when
[1:46:23] Enoch left that's when he knew to go get
[1:46:27] in the ark amen and then some he says to
[1:46:30] go get near the
[1:46:31] ark so all I want to say about that is
[1:46:34] if you're the Living Word of today
[1:46:37] there's people at your work yes your
[1:46:40] family they might not express it but
[1:46:42] they're watching youen and if there's
[1:46:44] any election in them whether they come
[1:46:47] in to the bride or they they give their
[1:46:49] lives I don't why we leave that up to
[1:46:51] God but it's your life that they're
[1:46:55] watching The Living Word so we need to
[1:46:57] understand the power that lays within us
[1:47:00] just submitting to the word and allowing
[1:47:02] the word brother Brown talked
[1:47:05] about the Holy
[1:47:08] Ghost eternal life being a
[1:47:13] person it's not some
[1:47:16] fairy it's the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:19] Christ and I know many of us of here
[1:47:22] have sat and we
[1:47:23] experience that fellowship with him and
[1:47:26] a lot of times we get the blues I mean I
[1:47:28] do after I have a fellowship with the
[1:47:31] Lord and that and I got to go back to
[1:47:32] work the next day I just don't want to
[1:47:34] be here it's hard but you still have to
[1:47:36] carry on right amen our families need us
[1:47:40] we still have word to
[1:47:42] fulfill and I'm I'm pretty sure all
[1:47:44] believers down through time felt that
[1:47:46] way why am I here why can't I just go
[1:47:48] home well God's got some work for you to
[1:47:51] do amen
[1:47:54] I'll keep pushing on
[1:47:55] here see she was a witness with a
[1:47:58] testimony experience the Living Word she
[1:48:01] had heard but there she seen and
[1:48:04] recognized and then she acted brother
[1:48:06] Brandon preached that hearing
[1:48:08] recognizing and acting right I guess you
[1:48:10] could say that she had representation
[1:48:13] she heard from her theophany however you
[1:48:15] want want to say it right now but now
[1:48:18] she knew and actually I I was so
[1:48:24] captivated by this I wanted to go look
[1:48:26] will the ever talk about her after like
[1:48:28] this is the amazing thing it just says
[1:48:29] she ran into the City and said come see
[1:48:31] a man brother brandham never really
[1:48:33] talked about it again but the amazing
[1:48:35] thing is is Russia and Eastern Europe
[1:48:38] they have their whole religion there's
[1:48:40] religions built upon her life she went
[1:48:44] on she had Five Sisters Three Sons I was
[1:48:46] just reading it and it was just
[1:48:48] interesting cuz I'm like hey who is this
[1:48:50] woman like was there anything out there
[1:48:52] and actually most excuse
[1:48:57] me most of the female ordination of uh
[1:49:01] ministers female ministers is based
[1:49:04] on their life and what they they use it
[1:49:07] see what Satan does with things but the
[1:49:09] prophet didn't say anything so I just
[1:49:11] that's interesting leave it alone let's
[1:49:13] let's move on and stick with the prophet
[1:49:15] amen so that
[1:49:17] is the quotes there I read
[1:49:21] this I want to get into he says all
[1:49:25] things work together for
[1:49:27] them for that love
[1:49:29] God and God has a purpose he wants to
[1:49:32] come and dwell in us and it's like well
[1:49:34] how do how does he do that are we going
[1:49:36] to believe like the sadut phes he's
[1:49:39] going to come in clouds of glory and
[1:49:41] it's just going to be this amazing thing
[1:49:43] and brother Brandon preached this
[1:49:45] message it's called I know and I would
[1:49:47] just like to talk a little bit out of
[1:49:51] here
[1:49:54] so he says see the devil was working on
[1:49:55] them putting them on an ash Heap we all
[1:49:58] have Ash heaps amen it's a part of the
[1:50:02] process and because of our Humanity it's
[1:50:04] the only way that God can actually get
[1:50:06] through to us is to bring us into
[1:50:08] desperation for they wanted to give them
[1:50:10] a testimony that I know not I guess or
[1:50:13] perhaps it's I know I know CU When you
[1:50:17] know no matter what comes against you
[1:50:20] you can stand there and say I serve the
[1:50:22] Living God
[1:50:23] am he's my
[1:50:25] portion we can be like David sir he slew
[1:50:28] the lion he did this for me he did this
[1:50:31] for me in me why would he not do this
[1:50:34] and when then when we overcome a
[1:50:35] situation in our life whether it's our
[1:50:37] marriage or work or whatever it may be
[1:50:39] we can stand there and just in full
[1:50:41] assurance and say Lord Do It
[1:50:44] Again amen and remember those trials are
[1:50:48] bought brought upon you the same way so
[1:50:51] that you will not say well maybe that is
[1:50:53] right maybe the scripture is true maybe
[1:50:56] Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy
[1:50:57] Ghost is right but when you get that
[1:51:01] experience Hallelujah and come off that
[1:51:04] Ash
[1:51:05] Heap you get the revelation of God by
[1:51:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost our
[1:51:11] pastors been preaching it I want to say
[1:51:13] something I've been guilty of sitting in
[1:51:16] the Pew here and the pastor's preaching
[1:51:19] away and it's actually right for me but
[1:51:22] I'm sitting there I like who the world
[1:51:24] is he preaching to can't be me going
[1:51:28] right over my
[1:51:29] head for a year he preached about to
[1:51:32] positions I needed to hear that but I
[1:51:35] didn't listen I didn't but it came to a
[1:51:38] head and finally I got it but I just
[1:51:40] look back after and I'm like oh my
[1:51:41] goodness for a year he's been trying to
[1:51:43] get this the Holy Spirit trying to get
[1:51:45] me to understand this and I'm just
[1:51:46] sitting there with my arm around my wife
[1:51:48] everything is perfect and sometimes that
[1:51:50] happens to us we're
[1:51:51] blind yes but God is good
[1:51:55] amen we're a true Son of God we'll
[1:51:57] finally get it some of us are more
[1:51:59] stubborn than others
[1:52:00] amen but when you get that experience
[1:52:03] and come off the ash Heap and you get
[1:52:04] the Revelation that God by the baptis of
[1:52:06] the Holy Ghost you can scream I know my
[1:52:09] redeemer
[1:52:10] liveth because he lives in
[1:52:13] me
[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:17] Amen brother
[1:52:19] Glory that makes me just want to weep
[1:52:22] yeah it truly does not to try and sound
[1:52:24] spiritual but I've experienced
[1:52:27] that and my goal as an encourager is
[1:52:30] just like Brother come on come on Amen
[1:52:34] get over yourself
[1:52:36] amen we all need it whether you're in
[1:52:38] the message 50 years two years one day
[1:52:41] amen you got to have that and he's going
[1:52:43] to give it to
[1:52:45] you but it's through your trials and
[1:52:47] tribulations so when I mean job his own
[1:52:50] wife turned against him has your wife
[1:52:51] ever turned against you brother Paul
[1:52:54] you've been
[1:52:56] married sometimes we might think it
[1:52:58] because of something in our own selves
[1:52:59] and like oh you know something wrong
[1:53:00] with her but look in the mirror we're
[1:53:03] all told right talking about talking
[1:53:05] about myself here people like this is a
[1:53:09] personal walk personal revelation I'm
[1:53:11] just trying to share that things that
[1:53:13] happened in my life and I go back and
[1:53:14] it's sitting right here and then I can
[1:53:16] say that's it that's what for me it
[1:53:19] seems to be I haven't been in the
[1:53:20] message my whole life so I don't know
[1:53:21] all the quotes on the scriptures but I
[1:53:23] experience something I go back is this
[1:53:25] of God or not and then I find things
[1:53:27] like this I'm like yes praise God Satan
[1:53:31] tries to tell me I'm not a son of God
[1:53:32] right I've experienced that I'm a Son of
[1:53:34] God and then you just stand there stand
[1:53:36] on that
[1:53:40] amen every Christian believer has to be
[1:53:43] pushed into those trials every Christian
[1:53:45] believer has to be put on the ash Heap
[1:53:48] so that he or she can come forth with an
[1:53:51] experience I know my redeemer liveth
[1:53:54] amen amen thank you
[1:53:57] Lord there it's not God sent a prophet
[1:54:01] it's not the testimony that's right I've
[1:54:04] noticed when I get the fellowshipping
[1:54:06] with going back to when I first gave my
[1:54:09] heart I was embarrassed I'd be at work
[1:54:10] and I just do my thing and I never
[1:54:12] really witnessed or talked to anyone it
[1:54:13] was kind of like a borderline believer
[1:54:15] right it's like I go to church
[1:54:21] amen back then then that was my
[1:54:23] testimony oh didn't you know God if I
[1:54:24] did fellowship with someone didn't you
[1:54:25] know God said a prophet I've noticed now
[1:54:28] whenever I'm at work and someone comes
[1:54:30] to talk to me I just talk to him like
[1:54:32] I'm talking to brother if I'm visiting
[1:54:34] brother Joel or whatever and I just talk
[1:54:38] and I sometimes I'll go back after and
[1:54:40] realize wow like what a witness and it's
[1:54:43] not some big thing and it's not God sent
[1:54:45] a I'm talking about the Living God and
[1:54:47] what he's done for me in my
[1:54:49] life and a few times they're like man
[1:54:52] how do you know this like oh by the way
[1:54:54] didn't you know God sent a prophet it's
[1:54:56] the last thing out of my mouth not the
[1:54:59] right it's just amazing how that works
[1:55:02] that way right says we don't come here
[1:55:05] this morning just to sit and talk about
[1:55:07] some historical Affair which is all true
[1:55:10] but we come here with a testimony this
[1:55:12] morning I know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:55:14] Son of God I know it Beyond any Shadow
[1:55:17] of Doubt I know that he raised from the
[1:55:20] dead and he lives within me today day he
[1:55:22] is mine and I am his I am a joint air
[1:55:25] with him in the kingdom of
[1:55:29] God what he's saying here is you got to
[1:55:33] have the same faith and understanding
[1:55:36] and conviction that you know that Jesus
[1:55:39] came and died on a cross for your
[1:55:42] sins the same level of faith and
[1:55:44] conviction understanding that God sent a
[1:55:47] prophet is that you are the Living
[1:55:49] manifested Word of God whether you feel
[1:55:51] like it or not amen that's what it's
[1:55:53] about to get you to that point and it's
[1:55:55] not arrogance it it humbles you beyond
[1:55:58] belief right such
[1:56:01] humility and then when that
[1:56:05] happens you want to give that Grace to
[1:56:08] everyone that you meet you you
[1:56:12] do amen what the Lord revealed to my
[1:56:15] heart and is not to sound off the word
[1:56:17] or anything but Jesus his first coming
[1:56:19] he came to magnify the law Grace magnify
[1:56:21] the law
[1:56:23] the manifestation of you is election
[1:56:26] manifests and Ma multiplies Grace it
[1:56:30] does and how do I know that because
[1:56:32] that's how the word moves in me that's
[1:56:34] how it moved in the prophet it's just
[1:56:36] the reality of it it's no longer you
[1:56:39] look at your brother like oh how can
[1:56:40] they do that or how can they do that you
[1:56:42] look for that word and then you pray
[1:56:43] right away I start praying Lord help my
[1:56:45] brother with that that's that's not
[1:56:48] Donald snow it's not I'll stand back
[1:56:51] there at the back door and I see someone
[1:56:52] coming in there walk and I'm not trying
[1:56:54] to lift myself this is the how the
[1:56:55] spirit is living in me I stand there and
[1:56:58] I've learned now different people and
[1:56:59] how they're man and I'll see I know
[1:57:01] they're a bit down right I'll shake
[1:57:02] their hand and Lord bless my brother
[1:57:05] lift them up tonight see them come in
[1:57:07] and they're tired Lord Quicken
[1:57:10] themen that's how that's the life of
[1:57:13] Christ it's the Life of Christ not and
[1:57:14] our pastor keeps saying not the life of
[1:57:16] Christ plus it's the Life of
[1:57:19] Christ that's it and if you don't have
[1:57:23] that and if you desire it then
[1:57:26] everything you have go get it you're
[1:57:29] going to fall flat on your face you're
[1:57:31] going to get desperate and then God's
[1:57:33] going to come amen and you're going to
[1:57:35] have that experience
[1:57:38] amen paragraph 91 but today I just love
[1:57:41] this so I just want to read this because
[1:57:42] it's about the knowing and I can't say
[1:57:44] it any better than than this okay
[1:57:47] actually 15 minutes right let me get
[1:57:51] here
[1:58:02] I'll read this one and then I'll get
[1:58:03] into my testimony there was too much of
[1:58:06] you in you paragraph
[1:58:09] 92 so God had to squeeze it out amen now
[1:58:14] we we always hear about the great
[1:58:16] squeeze and everything and I believe
[1:58:17] there's a squeeze first before that
[1:58:19] squeeze happens that squeeze happens
[1:58:21] because you're already already prepared
[1:58:22] for it I've been squeezed in the last
[1:58:24] three years brother amen and it's been a
[1:58:28] blessing
[1:58:29] Hallelujah through trials and while the
[1:58:32] squeezing excuse me was coming out
[1:58:35] coming on is hard but after a while the
[1:58:37] sky clear back then you see the promise
[1:58:41] of God Amen the promise of God for this
[1:58:44] day is a body change
[1:58:47] amen and it's a process yes sir and it's
[1:58:50] through these trials amen and every time
[1:58:53] you receive a trial and you receive what
[1:58:55] God purposed for you and you line up to
[1:58:57] and you kill the little bit of the old
[1:58:58] man you become reflect more of that life
[1:59:01] in you that is the body change people it
[1:59:04] is it's a daily dying to yourself and
[1:59:07] then the cation of it is a literal body
[1:59:10] change he said a dove cleans itself from
[1:59:14] the inside out am amen this word has got
[1:59:17] to get into your soul and mix with your
[1:59:19] faith and then change you from the
[1:59:21] inside out
[1:59:22] amen then you cry I know my redeemer
[1:59:25] liveth and at the last days he will
[1:59:27] stand on the earth though the skin worms
[1:59:28] destroys this body yet in my flesh I
[1:59:30] will see God these little trials and
[1:59:33] things are but for just for a moment and
[1:59:36] then they fade away pass away but
[1:59:39] they're only done for your good let us
[1:59:41] remember that that God's would get
[1:59:45] glory in your weaknesses they're there
[1:59:50] and it's in this message I I think
[1:59:52] everyone should go read it it's I know
[1:59:55] but it's they're there to bring you in
[1:59:57] closer fellowship with God and when
[2:00:00] you're in closer fellowship with God you
[2:00:01] begin to understand your relationship
[2:00:04] with God and the right that you have to
[2:00:05] lay claim to and what you can expect in
[2:00:07] your life that's just how simple it is
[2:00:10] amen so I'd like to talk about the
[2:00:12] literal lived experience of this because
[2:00:14] it all sounds so amazing and great
[2:00:18] but I've been married and you don't need
[2:00:20] the clap almost 25 years I was shocked
[2:00:24] actually the last time when you all
[2:00:25] started but it is an amazing feat to
[2:00:27] stay in age divorce is rampant you have
[2:00:29] to ask yourself why is
[2:00:31] that right why is divorce rampant and I
[2:00:34] backslid away and my my perfect wife
[2:00:38] that God gave to me and I know a lot of
[2:00:40] times I didn't see her that way but now
[2:00:43] I understand that she's everything I'm
[2:00:44] not and I'm everything she's not and us
[2:00:47] together are
[2:00:49] perfect you have to see that it makes
[2:00:52] everything so much simple but the Holy
[2:00:54] Ghost has to reveal that to you so we
[2:00:56] were back the woman that I loved the
[2:00:58] moment I saw within 4 hours I knew
[2:01:01] that's the woman I'm going to
[2:01:03] marry I can't explain
[2:01:06] it so it's a revelation and Satan always
[2:01:09] comes and attacks our stones of
[2:01:11] Revelation that's what he attacks
[2:01:15] right serving the lord everything's
[2:01:17] going good and then we tried to have
[2:01:18] children and we couldn't have children
[2:01:20] or at least at that time time Satan
[2:01:23] comes starts beating beating me down get
[2:01:27] tested and I we find out it's me I'm the
[2:01:29] issue if you want to say but really no
[2:01:31] all things work together for them that
[2:01:33] love God so I start listening and
[2:01:37] backslide away run out
[2:01:40] west and the man that I
[2:01:43] became disgusts
[2:01:46] me the way I treated my wife the things
[2:01:49] I've said and
[2:01:50] done
[2:01:53] she'd never deserved any of it but as
[2:01:56] you take one step away you don't know
[2:01:59] how far you're going to go
[2:02:02] amen we had kids and here's God now
[2:02:04] starting to work on was the fiveyear
[2:02:07] process of me coming back to the Lord
[2:02:08] because all of a sudden you have a
[2:02:09] desire to serve the Lord now Satan's the
[2:02:12] other way now he's quoting scriptures
[2:02:13] that you're saying oh no you in your day
[2:02:15] of Grace it's we all been there we we've
[2:02:17] been in that
[2:02:20] battle the final straw was my father
[2:02:23] passed away and I had to identif go
[2:02:25] through his life and give a eulogy
[2:02:26] eulogy and the Holy Ghost asked me what
[2:02:29] type of Father are you going to be
[2:02:31] what's going to be remembered of you
[2:02:32] what are they going to say at your
[2:02:34] funeral right then and there I gave my
[2:02:36] heart to the Lord amen amen Lord put it
[2:02:40] on my heart to go back to my old church
[2:02:42] and make things right so I did it and
[2:02:46] it's a process so we come here and we
[2:02:48] try to come to church and got the wrong
[2:02:50] number so for a year I was in my
[2:02:51] basement basement and I talked about
[2:02:52] that before overcoming certain things in
[2:02:55] my flesh I was still other things that
[2:02:56] were in me that had to come
[2:02:59] out but I began to see a little bit of
[2:03:02] the terrible husband I
[2:03:05] was and I really wanted I had a desire
[2:03:08] to make my wife
[2:03:10] happy but I didn't fix things according
[2:03:12] to the word and the more I tried I had a
[2:03:14] desire would just make things worse and
[2:03:17] rightfully
[2:03:18] so I just wanted that warmth back the
[2:03:21] way it was in early in our marriage and
[2:03:24] then I it's like maybe it'll never come
[2:03:26] back but I had a desire in my heart and
[2:03:28] I prayed to the Lord and I went about
[2:03:30] trying to do it myself with my own
[2:03:32] ability just making things worth I
[2:03:34] couldn't even so the big complaint I
[2:03:36] remember and we've all been there if
[2:03:38] you're married is she felt like she was
[2:03:41] just a warm body and I felt I was just a
[2:03:42] piggy bank and that's where but we loved
[2:03:45] each other and we'd go to bed at night
[2:03:46] it's like hey I'm willing to work on
[2:03:47] this are you willing to yes Common
[2:03:50] Ground let's we'll get through this
[2:03:52] divorce was never I guess I shouldn't
[2:03:54] say never there was a few times we
[2:03:56] uttered it but it wasn't in our
[2:03:59] heart started coming the church and
[2:04:03] developing relationships and growing in
[2:04:05] the Lord and the Lord put a real desire
[2:04:08] like a real desire in my heart to make
[2:04:10] my wife happy the desire was for her to
[2:04:13] be the happiest sister at
[2:04:18] church I tried to make that come to pass
[2:04:22] still not fixing things or doing it
[2:04:23] according to the word it was still a lot
[2:04:25] of
[2:04:27] physical and in her part of the life
[2:04:29] wasn't so much about that anymore but I
[2:04:31] was still that was one of my main
[2:04:34] focuses and I would I come to realize
[2:04:37] that and I mean I would pray like for
[2:04:40] almost two years like Lord just take it
[2:04:41] out of me like let me be on the same
[2:04:43] page as her brother Brown you know it's
[2:04:46] either sex money or authority headship
[2:04:49] goals are the three main thing there's
[2:04:50] other little things and there up to that
[2:04:52] so for us at that point it was the whole
[2:04:54] physical intimacy thing right I had a
[2:04:58] real desire and one day I was sitting
[2:05:00] around the fire with a brother and we
[2:05:02] got the fellowship and it came out I I
[2:05:04] voiced it he voiced it it's like well
[2:05:06] okay we're not the only one right some
[2:05:09] of us have a real desire to be that for
[2:05:11] our
[2:05:13] wives still now Satan there's a I'm
[2:05:16] going to say a demon or a spirit that
[2:05:18] still wasn't handled correctly and I'd
[2:05:20] go about trying to do it and you've ever
[2:05:22] done that like you have a real sincere
[2:05:24] desire to help someone you go to help
[2:05:25] them they just want they just you feel
[2:05:26] like you've been spit in the face and
[2:05:28] then I of course the old Dawn would come
[2:05:30] out and I'd get all upset and ah and
[2:05:32] then a week later you're in that mess
[2:05:36] type thing but you had a sincere
[2:05:39] desire but it was a sincere prayer and a
[2:05:42] sincere desire of my heart and I got
[2:05:45] desperate and one day I was out excuse
[2:05:50] me
[2:05:53] I was fellowshipping with our pastor and
[2:05:55] I was we went shooting guns and we had
[2:05:58] coffee and a two-hour visit turned into
[2:06:01] a 5 hour and we were just
[2:06:03] sitting in the truck fellowshipping and
[2:06:05] we started talking about this remember
[2:06:09] all of the things that I the scriptures
[2:06:11] and the quotes that I've quot I'm
[2:06:13] talking about now the live reality of it
[2:06:15] and it's just seems so simple and we're
[2:06:17] talking about recognizing presence of
[2:06:20] God and every time time that God
[2:06:22] fulfills his words it's totally
[2:06:23] different than what this will think it
[2:06:25] will
[2:06:27] be we begin the fellowship and the Holy
[2:06:30] Ghost and it wasn't some great big thing
[2:06:31] it was after the fact when I look back
[2:06:33] on it I'm like that was the Holy
[2:06:36] Ghost came down through the gift of a
[2:06:39] pastor he didn't say much it was just in
[2:06:41] that presence and talking about it my
[2:06:43] wife has been was trying to tell me the
[2:06:45] very thing but I wouldn't listen because
[2:06:48] she's the problem not
[2:06:50] me right
[2:06:52] so the Holy Ghost come down and in that
[2:06:54] moment in that instance I saw myself the
[2:06:58] way my wife sees me and I didn't like
[2:07:00] what I saw
[2:07:03] but it didn't affect me I didn't get mad
[2:07:06] I didn't get upset I saw it as the grace
[2:07:08] of
[2:07:09] God right then and there the very thing
[2:07:12] that affected and was hold so for 14
[2:07:14] years my wife didn't kiss me with
[2:07:17] emotion or feeling and I longed for it
[2:07:19] and I S I tried to get Quant quantity
[2:07:21] over
[2:07:23] quality this is just a reality for 14
[2:07:25] years we lived in
[2:07:27] torture because of things that I had
[2:07:30] done things IID said and I didn't make
[2:07:31] it right God had forgiven
[2:07:34] me but she hadn't forgiven yet I haven't
[2:07:38] become the man deserving of forgiveness
[2:07:42] yet right then there and the pastor was
[2:07:46] kind of floored cuz I was saying like
[2:07:47] blowing kind of it looks like I was
[2:07:49] blowing things out of proportion because
[2:07:50] it seems so it wasn't I literally saw
[2:07:53] myself the way I deserved to be seen I
[2:07:55] was selfish
[2:07:57] self-serving I put myself before my wife
[2:08:01] my family never ever saw I was totally
[2:08:03] blind to it before but in that moment I
[2:08:06] saw it and right then and there I'm like
[2:08:08] Lord forgive
[2:08:10] me and we talked about and I'm like I'm
[2:08:12] going to go home and I said I'm never
[2:08:14] going to lay a finger on my wife again
[2:08:16] unless she welcomes it and we got
[2:08:18] talking about I'm driving home the true
[2:08:20] desire like I'm like on cloud N I just
[2:08:23] got lamb bases I just got 10 pounds of
[2:08:25] Flesh taken off my but I'm happy I can't
[2:08:28] wait to go home and do
[2:08:29] this this is all coming back after now
[2:08:32] thinking about what happened and I go
[2:08:34] home I say honey I'm sorry and I told
[2:08:36] her honey I promise you I won't lay a
[2:08:39] finger and I was driving home and
[2:08:41] Satan's like well it might be four weeks
[2:08:43] like I don't care God will be my portion
[2:08:45] and in this I know we talked about that
[2:08:46] and I I was listening to the message I
[2:08:48] work a couple weeks before that and he
[2:08:51] got to the point and brother brandham
[2:08:53] tells a story about when he went to
[2:08:54] visit Oral Roberts and it was the
[2:08:55] greatest building he's ever been greater
[2:08:58] than Kings any Palace he's ever been in
[2:09:00] and he got there and he felt so like
[2:09:02] Lord why am I not worthy of this he
[2:09:04] started and a voice came down through
[2:09:06] the cour like but I'm your portion and
[2:09:09] that's what I told Brother Barry God
[2:09:10] will be my portion he was my portion
[2:09:12] before you'll be my portion again so I'm
[2:09:14] driving and a couple minutes later Satan
[2:09:16] comes again well it might be four
[2:09:18] years I said I don't care if it's the
[2:09:20] rest of my life if it makes makes my
[2:09:21] wife happy I've never ever thought that
[2:09:23] way in my life was God correcting things
[2:09:26] that were in my life to work out the
[2:09:28] good of God in
[2:09:29] Me So I go home and it's just so simple
[2:09:32] nothing big and I just made that promise
[2:09:35] to her and it took four days just four
[2:09:38] days and my wife kissed me like she
[2:09:40] kissed me on her
[2:09:41] honeymoon amen I could die tomorrow and
[2:09:44] I'll be a happy
[2:09:47] man it's so simple but it's the power of
[2:09:51] God that's right don't overlook it don't
[2:09:55] overlook it whatever it is in your life
[2:09:57] it's there to bring you closer to God
[2:10:00] Amen and it's reflected in your family
[2:10:03] all your relationships maybe another day
[2:10:05] I'll get into that
[2:10:07] about about now how it reflects or
[2:10:10] magnifies great election once you truly
[2:10:13] know who you are and you surrender

[2:10:18] Deliverance only comes from Total
[2:10:20] sacrifice or total surrender we always
[2:10:23] want to talk about God's going to save
[2:10:25] me God's going to deliver

[2:10:31] God it's 5 to
[2:10:34] 12 musicians if you want to
[2:10:38] come I just wanted the fellowship and Sh
[2:10:41] it's to me it's such a tremendous
[2:10:42] Victory it'd be to me that's greater
[2:10:44] than an angel coming and standing for 14
[2:10:47] years I desired and longed for it i'
[2:10:49] kissed my wife goodbye every morning and
[2:10:51] there was no love back and I knew I

[2:18:26] about the Heavenly
[2:18:28] bridegroom not just actually being
[2:18:30] married to but manifesting through the
[2:18:33] Earthly
[2:18:34] bride that was what he was talking about
[2:18:37] and you know my pastor he talked about
[2:18:40] this verse a lot herein is our love made
[2:18:43] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[2:18:46] day of

[2:18:55] am so is he in this world am he knows
[2:18:58] our infirmities he knows our struggles
[2:19:01] and our trials brothers and sisters he
[2:19:03] knows every single one of them and

[2:22:35] Lord we know that father it's wonderful
[2:22:39] to recognize that you sent a prophet
[2:22:41] lord it's wonderful to recognize that
[2:22:43] there is a message from that Prophet but
[2:22:46] Lord Jesus help us to recognize the
[2:22:49] purpose of that prophet and the purpose
[2:22:51] of that message is so that we could be
[2:22:53] that message Father that we could be
[2:22:56] just exactly like John take that book
[2:22:58] and eat it up was the instruction you
[2:23:00] gave him and that it will be sweet as
[2:23:03] honey in your mouth but make thy belly
[2:23:05] bitter this flesh cannot stand it but
[2:23:08] Lord we heard this morning it's the
[2:23:09] trials that you allow to come our way
[2:23:12] that's going to squeeze the bad
[2:23:14] character out of us it's going to
[2:23:16] squeeze the old man out so that when
[2:23:18] that true natural squeeze happens in
[2:23:21] this world father we'll be ready on the
[2:23:23] inside Lord Jesus to step into that new
[2:23:26] body father we pray for Brother Don snow
[2:23:29] Lord we thank you for him for sending
[2:23:31] him and his family our way Lord Jesus we

[2:23:39] those who are called according to your
[2:23:41] purpose and Lord we believe the Snows
[2:23:43] are called according to your purpose

[2:23:52] together as a family we know that's
[2:23:54] nothing short of a miracle father we

[2:24:02] doubt when he begins to preach this
[2:24:04] message tomorrow morning oh father that
[2:24:06] you would just strengthen him and
[2:24:08] encourage him Lord that he would know
