[Music] [Applause] find me [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] as well can never use his power anymore and that's why we are here this evening before because we are identified that is another Jesus Christ the father Lord why we are here this evening of God we have gathered in the name of Jesus Christ and that is why we've come here today Lord we we're not here to talk to Canada we are not here because come here in your name of God and because we are here in the name of God we know that your presence is very important this evening father and therefore love Jesus is there any problem in our mission tonight's law is there any situation in our mission tonight to God the Bible said that in the name of Jesus because every new South bow and Grandpa knows any power that can confront your power down tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen complex law is working yeah so welcome tonight I was surprised I was like a Minecraft you know yeah God bless you welcome brother God bless you and so um this evening I just want to speak on something um somehow but why we keep going on you understand why and so this guy I want to shoot on the Block organism um myself go I go we're going to click on it this evening okay so um I work in young people uh the young people here when I want you guys to do sort of what we are doing tonight and then every time you can make sure you're reading the scriptures because the message is based on the Bible you're gonna help Embraces and descriptions and when people come together show me from the Bible we can't do anything because I'm like oh I love your way through from the Bible but everything is and one time foreign [Music] this is where all our life is uncaught upon the word of God not just the world but the real word of God because the record close right but when you still talk in this life what is written right and Jesus can save the world that I speak unto you to be experience and their life to um again John chapter one verse 4. 00 John chapter 1 verse 4. so the young guys so yeah yeah I'm reading things for the life in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your soul into God that make it an atonement for the soul okay John 1 4. yeah yeah okay because in him was life and the life was the life of man may God so I I want to put on the blog and sometimes uh it's kind of you know the basis of our region not good for us foreign if these people who don't know God will figure out one place invoke a demon and then make a continuous brothers and animals and you could walk and then sometimes when we want to like do the different kind they offer the blood of a human being to sacrifice even in the Bible there was a king who have to sacrifice his son and Israel have to go on how to experience I think because he sacrificed his thoughts nothing to God and then then there has to be something about blood that milk even occultic people to want to have something to do with blood again we also understand that when you come to making confidence and so whenever like um I mean so most people like in my community are like different people not like Christians and so they often refer to my family as God's family who's God fights for them my family now do you think being that a several times that and where I come from informed common to see someone who is prosperous and certainly know so what we mean like wrong it means you are a member of one of our caucus of scientists so when you belong and you you you you um extremely well do right because you belong but if you don't so your life will be extremely miserable and so when you come to my experience you will see so many uh market like insane I'm gonna tell you they have used that one they have to use that word they have to use that one so what it means is that somebody use that person to make to make wealth so who's alive but look alive Jesus these are people who don't know God and this is the best that you can offer that's all and so the girls who can also include Humanities for wealth and this is where this thing also came into Christianity in God is money all you can see is the death of Jesus Christ is how when you listen to God's life you will give you money in Google wealth to tell you that all that wasn't your mind when they come into Christianity not into Christ into Christianity was to make money and so the wrong conversion like this in the heart and you know so if you come to God I'm looking for money he will give you money now the beginning and so we're looking at grandma sister cartoon foreign between God and mind and the garden figure at every school of the evening that God came down and walk in the garden just to have experience then then something other services that God does not miss you there's something like a fellowship God had so much respect for Fellowship and so God comes down in the evening and then he comes to see who man who is man you see what we have in our dictionary is not the technical definition of man who is man bring on the Bible nothing that is created in the image of God that is mine and so again because the position of man is not built of making your organs no it is that makes you a man and so welcome God to see that man that he make that he makes in his own image not any kind of man but the man that is in the image of God and so God comes down and of England is just a replica of Russian God look like himself Hallelujah when God came down while he was looking was God looking at himself and so every action of man was according to God's perfect will because the original man was at every minute left title holy spirit amen at every Pleasant time who every decision of others was perfect perfect according to God so if I mean in other words this way it was a perfect meal of God and so that was the design for you to know the condition that we are supposed to be in but God wants to God is giving us all his aim is to bring us to that perfect condition that was lying to come to Christ in the beginning it was muscle that because that was oh when God was making man God has something in his mind when he was making man and what you are supposed to be today is that thing that God had in his life exactly no together I'm not trying to do to God I'm sure 2004 now I I don't know and good morning good morning [Music] thank you mine oh when Mom came and told me God clean your man the field you know the guy who called him and so that is and so when you go when you are brother and your sister are you God oh my you know that's a lot of students manipulating you and that's why you gossip and that's wrong because the devil went behind to to tell God all his God the meaning of acquisition is to help someone black I thought that was what so he going to God to tell them that man that he said in making your emails have failed I remember God I don't know but but when man feels the devil's life I got them hey I mean because there is nothing again now this is well somehow you see I I was not angry him the highest I said I'm trying to explain I will see that when God came down the his gift was to smoke again let me read the foot now notice it now then when they realize that girl had seen and going away from God God had to kill some animals to have a food because Christ was the last name before the work of God and when he killed them and on food and so God was King to argument is to cover themselves in the skin and speak in the presence of God to receive the judgment and the internal destination foreign and God cannot look upon you without a problem I a problem in that day was blocked but it wasn't the king it was not that was said to his King and that is the same thing today this is the role of the high priest in the happiness that makes me confidential that comes down president to make reconciliation to kind of reconcile man God to God that was the lord of the prince was God himself amen God himself now when God was doing this I believe personally that is not possible because what God told the world today but how come even God you couldn't out of um out of Uganda yeah you cousin out of England God used to created a connection if it wasn't the man connected to you no because God himself still connecting himself back to life because of Fellowship and now this is getting confused because in in workbook thing all these things were not there but God will make us to understand that something happened even before the world ever began creation of man something happened took in place no God knowing that man before God has already made a perfect sacrifice before the world ends up with God amen and that blood can never lose his power so that is now we see that this religion can talk thank you it's not religion it's not something that we have to throw it because it's something that even for the beginning had to bring us down to nothing sacrifice right from the beginning now when God has them instead of control go work with him and talk to him in the garden he became a Wanderer the moment might not Fellowship he became a Wanderer walking around not enough to go talk about and that's the way a man becomes today now listen look when a man comes out and says to God he comes from wonderland bring them girls joining one cloth and leaving that one and drawing another they don't have to find him here he goes over to Mercedes to make all these productive and to constant confusing Holiness from plantingness logging us out because his love Fellowship sometimes when you see people moving up and down it could cause right in your heart will want to reconnect back to God because God has awareness that desire in the heart of his mind right because man wants Fellowship now but we've tried to substitute education for Fellowship together think that education will bring Fellowship education now I said this education has been the greatest healers the discussion of Jesus Christ has ever had okay that's how things go into Institute now um I think yeah open to Matthew chapter 11 Matthew 11 25-27 so uh I want you foreign Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudence and has revealed them to the babes even so farther for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the Sun but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever The Sun Will Reveal him amen no left let me find Jesus Christ from the wise and the students and so and that is why because the the most educated person that's like look at Moses that Moses but when God came down God has to take away all good education from him don't have to take everything out and then have to put God know how to cook in him I mean not nothing in the world that Moses can walk with God now why do you think Canada is so far away from God because they want to laugh from their life every word of God they want to want to work now they want to they want to think out the local s and that's right work we want to explain everything and God will say that by sick we know that the things I can see we are made by the things that are not free how do we know by faith that work is safe is not just not believing something that means that something maybe to know that this is true that's no something something in you make you know that this is true and it could fix that in your heart can make me know that I'm going to Rap God yeah Abraham's heart that maybe not I'm going to have a son [Applause] everything amen and so why would you come to and the same thing to hear sometimes we ministers we want to educate the people we want to educate executive to take until we now educate them out of the world never came to educate anyone you people can't have 5 000 people I expect in Parables does he make sense the science thousand will not understand why people in Bangles why but yet we have five thousand members he never speak he never tried to educate them to explain the kingdom he speaks in parables and then because the work was not given to all the people that it was beginning to the claimed that I said marker explained these things to us because it is a horrible that reveals the world he had to open the water there and start revealing it to them one by one and that is the perfect balance right when I was here when I was like let's say 10 years it doesn't make any sense that one because it's so Dawn I'm going to share but now I can stay in one verse two hours I kind of start wondering if if it makes so much sense now why because there is something is trying to revealed the world to me catch me on it because the other person will understand and so it is not that he felt the user that it has nothing given to him yet all I'm better oh and I have resolution look that person there are things that he knows that I'm going to know and that is why when we come together we encourage amen no no no he's healing today I can see him detecting out of the presence of God and I started walking away local conditions now I think because I'm melting I can't remember man has never been in that condition ever where he was never got in favor of God so the way Adam help after the fall he has never ever imagined ever felt like that either bro don't speak when when God Called to happen don't say something he says the sick of the woman and the fruit of the second okay and improve to hear right okay Adam understand he wasn't working out hopelessly no he he walked up in Hope knowing that something was going to happen and that was why Adam could ever something happened something will happen and so Adam kept thinking his children as the government make us to understand that that language remained a perfect union that the Bible called that Union the forms of God why because they knew that women knew that something was to happen in the future that was to bring us back to fellowship because that is what man is the time he has the greatest thing that imagine everything else is fellowship with God no no he said God because the god record and come soon that the second of an innocent substitute so in the life of the devil that God was supposed to die go before the world ever to die God already has taken place a king smile and so the devil this is the importance of resolution that's why the prophet is saying that the um the importance of resolution in the life of a believer that can never be over emphasized no the difference you think is the reason I'm driving himself it's nothing from the Bible foreign written but a Christian who who went to School of Technology and has teenagers then you would have had no questions here on Earth today but we see that technology has swallowed up in the devil's King okay is not even of God I need the educational Clarity and so but when you put the crystals to Christ the differences look what the devil was saying was the scriptures that it was the letter and what he was saying is you will die because the letter kills but when Christ called and spoke to him what Christ was saying was life and because there is no life in the devil he cannot contain it now now if only nothing to talk if all God requires of The Sinner belonging to the truth God will be on golf 25. so both of them had himself they have they had um and so they had one of the best right guy pastors of that game they had a man who who met God they had to thank my Creator songs and everything so they had to cancel clock okay then not only that but can't come and offered in sacrifice so it is not just about going to church and next time you want to talk it is not about going to talk an awful sacrifice it is still beyond that if sacrifice once all that brought in prayers he'll be unjust condemning not only that but pain was not an incident that is pain was not and what we will call on the user that's all that was saying pain was what we say in the lesson because you it was the same castle it wasn't decent pastors okay okay it is not only the river that passed for God can you test for God does not mean you are believer that is not only the universe he now said that the business between the river and you all the user is what they use to train the test now another testing for God then he ends up as an alcoholic in an alcohol station I wasn't drinking alcohol he feels oh I'm fine now but a Christian is she themselves maybe he goes to God no no there's something more than this and then he keeps looking for God until 2017 because they have gone through evil water now what the other school have a system where he can hold on someone together again will stay there for a while he said that when you think of this water is that you will never test again he's not he's not made a statement in somewhere such an out of you of Living Water and what is that now the believer is not the source of the water but the river becomes a Tanya like you have a lot of food of that person and that is what God wants us off of us today amen that people will come to you and bring Living Water people come to you they are supposed to bring that nothing like this from you from you yeah good life they let um uh their own system I mean it's broken but there's nothing but in the other guy is broken because he still holds worker so the clock is happening because we have water but I don't know uh most of I know I know a system so assistant I don't know the young guys water it's fresh for that one girl after one day it's not nice anymore God will contains water and so you keep coming back to drinking the same you know when I was growing up that is going to everything for that 10 years from broadheads and baptism and I was like is this all the message has to offer is it just go get them baptism so at the time I left so sound when wonderful summer because I said this is not what I'm looking for okay I have to come back and I wanted someone to do for myself amen amen amen amen you know it was making sense it was like this is what I am missing all these years now why am I saying this thing the father is first conduct collect more worker and God remain only there for years and this is one reason why you see people living the so-called Mission Church to the universe is a real message thought goes outside he cannot be comfortable anywhere but when you can move on when you see a thought you have people use that church and they are comfortable something is working because if you seek these people right if you feed them like the undiluted word of God when you go outside and eat nonsense it will go back except the person is not a secret of God no oh God okay dog himself as the prince to mother okay there's some High kids to Abraham king of peace it means that that man feels like that if that's in God amen and then Christ who is make of the same altar of mercies a high priest who's Christy continues forever now we see the electronic systems saying of something uh the alcohol homes I will figure out the uh the hiking to go down again for the congregation himself has to be sure that before he can make that kind of offer then you have God yeah because if if you are not right to God you will die at the stop foreign once a year I don't know the kind of error God cooking these things together because it was going to be shadow of the perfect thing to come you know there was something perfect that was to come right because the devil even made us to understand that even the uh the blood of bulls and broke for him to God give God as a sudden because they knew someone nothing but other news the first other music something was to come into future now but now we see Christ as a heightened yeah before I continue we remember down in the Passover because uh speaking about communion and what's the last message uh yeah you have to be like for you to have a community with God so we will have to talk about and things that is making people from organs that's how God was and so right and then we finger some people have got to happen it was going to be the last minute and then God Called Moses and God uh around or you're good you lost me on the first year and have a character that must be a character and then you apply it on your top post you don't do it inside like some Deliverance who said they have the Holy Ghost and you can't see the manifestation of the Holy Ghost we will know if it's not in your house that you have the Holy Ghost your Holy Ghost makes me a deliver anywhere you go so you said applied on importance and on the nuclear and so that when I have over now remember that after the application to call them that day when you go behind you have a communion so don't a blood apply and behind the block you are some of them those Fellowship behind the door because ignored have gonna cry and so when the death angel passed he wasn't saying is to be like today or Google make any mistakes today that was a good question the questions is not at night and so it doesn't matter nothing matter and so the anger when he was passing or he was looking for is the block of time finish and that is the same thing today because if the block has not long enough time you're on your own no okay so a lot of time so I have like five minutes left to come to to all so I'm trying to learn Gaga I cannot come to us today you know we don't have a historical goal and so if all those things I'm talking about if it does not act like a girl there's no need to talking about them now we look at group then down from the East um I mean and one of us God Supply and linked to come through and convert me like next month and one months everything in one month we are going through so the group of good is very interesting book very interesting group now thank you and Yahoo was the youngest of all the the strength of truth that came to visit and his testimony was very different in fact it was a testimony that brought down God's presence well and you came to go he was not trying to indict group you must have done something wrong look when a man who came and you came more like in the office of the science folk Minister he came to Encore he came to edify and that is what we need today whatever he's gone Fellowship and so the Bible says anything he was fired until the August letter statement okay and you came to drugs I said God make me yeah [Music] Mountain but God be God was thinking the things will die and they come back but when man died he does not come back go on that something is missing somewhere but anyone who came and threatened it out and then who came and took good that is one that is to come and when that world comes he will reconcile man back and when when a woman who made that statement this one and then broke shelter all I know now I know that God can walk with myself I look at in this body because I will see him what happened a brother encouraging another brother amen what happened we broke life to him he said um of Indonesia foreign now I'm trying to so the river and most times we want to dwell in retention and attention side when we met others oh God I want I want to speak I want you know that we want to exercise power God doesn't decrease and that you know you said what do you mean I'm I'll do something John 20 verse 21. he said I didn't say to them again so please be unto you yes listen as my father has thanked me he said even so since I knew so similar bless ourselves I came here I came to dying for the sins of God why I came to give life to other people because that's him will that's how I am sending you you and I said I when he has said this he greeted on them I said unto them with few years again why because the producer is consumption as a priest foreign in the name of Jesus because we are living in a Dying World I don't think that life work now living in a dead world not this world is dead I we are supposed to do the most uncomfortable group here but if we are comfortable is wrong with us if we are comfortable here something is wrong with us well you as a believer because I want to make this quick man one thing that inspires information was Sister gaming so it was like three weeks ago when the sun was um that kind uh I kind of wanted to understand more about foreign [Music] come to clubs to come from her clock and so many thoughts and she's young Trump he's an old woman we stay at home where do you want to receive your healing is he at home foreign yeah who have put home because he said if I can't cook if I can talk I'm going to stop him I I'm going to cut the whole group there is someone who has lost hope in life and so all have faith if I can just the the smallest part of him and then when Christ was walking when Christ was walking down there are more people that love him there are people helping him hugging him and so many things and yet Christ did not feel them and then this woman she did not even talk Christ he got a hand and his first person someone trust me yeah someone talked me and you personally who taught him you because a different thought why am I saying that she did not stay home she came to her single suit because everybody have the smallest Fellowship I know it could be okay for me and so they must have called that hey you'll smell you smell I thought when you're walking down the road people can you hear your smelly go my game came to her there are so many things that we have to overcome God will walk down there and let me tell you something when you're losing blood you got work then then week in fact you can die from God but this woman he was not looking at those costs to stop looking at rubbing eyes I see and start looking at the Unseen right and what he was looking at was only if I can talk I don't care God if I can just talk to him of His Garment and let them let me make this statement God knew I know why Christ happened and that is why we don't have to take this thing for granted foreign we want to have real contact with God no the believer as a priest no I'm and opens our God now listen who has concerned us to himself like Jesus Christ and had given us what do what the meaningful of what we're continues to who you because that's what I'm this is not pastor this is not perfect it's not science fault he's not the deliver the ministry of the Constitution now is trying to explain that stress us to read that God Lost In Christ we're concerning the world unto yourself not including trespasses unto them so today if God has given us the ministry of the continuation we are not supposed to improve trespasses on the people we are supposed to relief foreign [Music] [Music] Ministry that's how he has given you the same Ministry how because Christ needs individuals he said that you are the Temple of the Living God so why are you come to so you look like instruments that God will continue doing the same work he was doing no look at last time now then we are what I'm GLaDOS of Christ um Anushka when Jacob when he went to Egypt and Phil told him I said how old are you he said the things of my pilgrimage the days of my pilgrimage knowing food that he was not of this act and you see that those men they moved their lives longer than something to come no matter the work we have they live their life knowing hundred percent there was something could come and so when you see someone you said the Bible says why your heart is that's your prayerful I thought when you see someone's heart you will not wear his praise of her you know why he's thinking the way he's thinking but when you see someone who is Heavenly minded the part of speaking in regardless he said after I give him a new things in half of life now remember that when the Holy Ghost comes I never statement before and uh we've got something it's like the life foreign is that life and that life is the life of man in him in Africa 20 African is it expensive ask him that um last 28th so Paul speaking to the elders okay grateful unclean yourself and all good luck all over the week the Holy Ghost had made me over here he said to seek the cross of God look he had contained with his blood and so why we deal with each other we know that this I mean for people who are killing curious because the Holy Ghost has not and that's a question for continuous because the Holy Ghost is brought themselves and God will know in Jesus Christ right amen and so he possessed oh my God inclusion well now time is off so now remember that we went through it this morning he said you wasn't sure go you are kept dying okay [Music] believe in it nothing but not at no heart because he could just connected you you look up and you did what you believe and accepted it now did not miss an atonement for yourself so remember I said God does not condemn a singer for swimming then he's a singer to begin with he condemns a Christian for Sinners so now look closely and then because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation so the Christian who sings was condemned but the condemnation fell on Christ and so it doesn't remember now listen so Romans chapter 8 so therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are employed yet they woke up after the flesh because after the experience if you do anything wrong it is not willful it is not willful and then you cannot sin because the fear of God whoever to you so you cannot even even if you want to you cannot you cannot understands that what we have been living in is not in school it is not something that we were told the reality of Christ reality of Christ and therefore tell him that is not Overland I'm driving one of the testimony I do not know the life unto death as I say again that this is the greatest shock of the devil ever because Godless War fare um [Music] foreign [Music]

be part of the righteousness of God and it doesn't come and tell you I ain't brother you are God it doesn't even lie to the father of all liars is not in him so if you take the devil are you helping her hit him hard you will not see an outcome of spooking him not not an alcohol see it doesn't matter what he says as far as it doesn't say it is everything for you because cannot come out from him his life reality doesn't know cannot lose his power when you understand who you are in Google matter um as I said before because or something you have cancer I prefect I don't have cancer in um than
