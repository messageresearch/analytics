bring before the church this morning we'd like to remember sister Faye Panetta and her family over there in the Philippines her uncle passed away and I believe we prayed for him already but he's gone on to glory and the consolation for that situation is that apparently he was able to reconcile with the Lord I believe we saw the text message but what a tremendous testimony that is there's nothing greater in this world is there than to be able to reconcile with the Lord my goodness we can say we know the message of the hour but what good is it if we have not reconciled ourselves with the Lord

spoke to us along the way we just love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians once again for bringing of your gifts offering them to the Lord freely this morning I'd like to just preach a little hope that's okay if you could turn with me in your Bibles to Exodus Exodus 14. and then I'd like to read another scripture over in second Corinthians chapter 10. Exodus chapter 14. second Corinthians chapter 10. Exodus chapter 14. let's start reading with verse 19. of Exodus chapter 14. and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of Israel went inside the midst of the sea upon the dry ground the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his chariots and his Horsemen and it came to pass in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of Fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that they draved them heavily so that the Egyptians said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians let's turn over to Second Corinthians second Corinthians chapter 10. second Corinthians chapter 10. verse 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus even at this very moment Lord we pray that you would just help us to take every single thought into captivity unto The Obedience of you father Lord Jesus we pray that you would just help me to get out of the way I pray that you would stop any word that you don't want spoken father and that you would just open the well father and just allow a gusher to come this morning Father for the words that you want to hear Lord Jesus we've come to be fed we've come to meet with you and Lord we know that you always come when you're invited we know that your word declares where two or three are gathered together in your name that you're there in the midst and father if we haven't said it yet we declare this meeting in the name of Jesus Christ to know that you are here and father maybe it's just to every devil that wants to come around here and try and exalt itself against your word father but Lord Jesus we just we just quietly rebuke them in the name of Jesus Christ and we declare this time for you father Lord we ask that you would open this word that we've read father break it open to us fresh like the bread of life that you did to those disciples along the way father when they invited you in the evening time father you open their eyes father by opening the the bread by the prayer that you spoke father by the words that came out of your mouth you opened their eyes and father we pray this morning that you would just open our eyes father just a little bit further to you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated today I don't have really any announcements this morning I just felt inspired once again I just think it's wonderful the way the Lord leads us and certainly excited to see what he'll do today just want to welcome everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no greater name in heaven or in Earth certainly a pleasure to be here I just I guess I feel a little nervous that's why I maybe I'm repeating myself it's kind of it's kind of fun because I recognize that presence and that's what makes me nervous and uh we just certainly are thankful that he's here today because I know he's got something he wants to say we just want to ask for prayer for the trip to the Philippines just keep your your prayers on sister Faye while she's over there and the family and brother Mervin who was leaving soon I believe he leaves on the 10th and uh the children will be going as well just a little bit after I can't remember the exact dates but brother miles will be going and then sister Lynn and then we'll be going over there to meet them as well but there's going to be many many services preached and the people in the Philippines have the word that we're coming and we just want to we just want to make sure that we're in tune with what the spirit has to say for the church so just remember brother Mervin and me and your prayers as we get ready to go over there and uh we'll just see what the Lord will have in store um we have a communion service on the 31st it's amazing how time flies we're already into December now and for those people who are around I know many will be traveling for Christmas and we'll just ask the the Lord for traveling mercies while you travel and pray that he brings you back safely at the appointed time um so yeah that's probably about it I'm sure there's going to be a few things going on do we know that there's a young people's uh this month there's going to be a caroling I believe at all folks home it's probably not the politically correct term for it so I apologize but I hope you know what I mean it's uh I guess what I've called it all my life and anyways there's going to be uh a carol singing for those who are interested and it's a beautiful thing because we know we have Christmas carols that are anointed they're not just uh they're not just songs that we sing that maybe would be about Christmas tree we're not going to go and sing O Christmas tree oh Christmas tree because we know that that's idol worship there's people that sing that song and that's not Christian there's nothing Christian at all in that song and and I trust that's not a song we're going to sing to the people we're going to sing hymns we're going to sing about the gospel we're going to sing about Jesus Christ because that's the true meaning of Christmas but we know all of Christmas is not what the world teaches about Christmas and this isn't a Christmas message I don't even know why I'm going here but I guess we're moving into the Christmas season and you know so many things about Christmas that's taught about Christmas is not the truth about Christmas Jesus was not born on the 25th we know that was a Roman Holiday that was implemented I believe back in the early early church by the Romans but we know Jesus was a type of the Lamb was born in the springtime is what the prophet said to us and uh anyways they're going to sing uh have a sing song and I think it'll be a wonderful time if you feel inclined by all means reach out and uh I'm sure it would be a blessing to have as many people come as as as possible so are you happy this morning sometimes I have to wonder you know many times I look at my position and I I wonder you know Lord why me um but I find myself here and the only thing that I can do is just follow the leadership of the Lord just like the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and and that's all we can do so I trust it's a blessing today we can just go forwards and you know I want to talk today brothers and sisters about strongholds and and this word out of out of second Corinthians chapter 10 strongholds I always thought that it was one word a stronghold but it's not it's a strong hold it's two separate words out of second Corinthians chapter 10. verse 4. for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds and just to do what I always do I'm going to set the I guess the final scene for this message this morning and to recognize that you know brothers and sisters we live in the evening time going back to our scripture here that we read a little earlier out of Exodus chapter 14. you know this word that we preach it's Darkness to some just like it was to the children of Israel it was a light to them at night but it was Darkness to the Egyptians and you know what this is to the people who are actually in strongholds by devils in this world this message that we preach this word that we love what we believe every fiber of our body is a Darkness to these people and you might say brother Barry we're the light of the world and we are the light of the world but you know what it's it's it's just blinding to some people because they could never ever hear this gospel that we preach if you say don't cut your hair to someone who is worldly they'll they'll say you're crazy that was a cultural thing don't wear pants look at the entire world the whole whole world is under the sway of that influence and then my goodness if you want to get into the trinitarian discussion and say you know what under until what have you been baptized and they'll say well in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost you say that's just titles you haven't been baptized at all you've got to be baptized in Christian baptism they're going to say you're crazy but you know what it is brothers and sisters it's a strong hold of a devil in their lives and they don't even know it but you know what that does is it humbles us as Believers it's humbling to recognize that we can see this because the whole entire world can't see it out of now now it's over 8 billion people in the world it's not even seven point whatever like we talked about probably the last time I said it maybe last year or early this year it's over 8 billion people in the world how many people have an ear to hear what the spirit saith unto the church in our day you know as I find myself in this situation I just I just want to read a quote here and I'm sorry or or you're welcome depending on how you look at it some people like quotes and some people don't I got some quotes today but you know that's what we base all that we believe on brothers and sisters it truly is it's up upon the message of the hour that's the only thing that's going to save us today because the message of the hour points the direct Avenue it's the key to unlock the door to get to Jesus Christ to be able to be perfect as he said be ye therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect there has to be an Avenue for us to be perfect and every single age was given an Avenue and this age is no different and this is the way this is the Avenue for us out of you must be born again I think the title is perfect because that really would be if I had to have a subtitle that's it for today brothers and sisters you must be born again and and everyone would say well brother I am well I know we are but sometimes we just need a little stirring up a little stirring up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance talking about a pastor and his role so you kind of understand my perspective with this brother Branham says in this message out of you must be born again and there's known in the Western countries a weed that an animal can eat it's called Loco weed I don't know whether anybody ever heard of it or not a loco weed yes a horse can eat that and you just can't do nothing with them he just becomes an outlaw you can't put a saddle on him you can't do nothing with him it's called Loco weed and you must keep your stock away from that weed and if it'll cause a horse to eat something if a horse rather it'll eat something that throws him into this condition into this spasm why you would be a very poor Cowboy to let your horse eat a weed local weed it shows that you don't care he says and a real pastor a real servant of Christ will be a poor example of Christ to see the sheep eat something that's going to drive him away or make him an outlaw before God a breaker of his word a breaker of his Commandments you shouldn't do that he says you should watch that very closely so just to set a background for today brothers and sisters you must be born again let's take a look at strongholds let's tear down strongholds but you know how we've got to do that I believe with all my heart brothers and sisters has changed our perspective change our perspective sometimes we can look at things in our lives and say well it's just normal it's just normal it's just the way that we do things and you know what many times we can become comfortable with it look at the children of Israel that generation that was raised up in Egypt in bondage they probably said this is normal it's not fun but it's just all we've ever known we haven't known anything else besides the the Master's Whip and so long as we perform for them and work really hard we get good food and we get good accommodations everything is looked after in our lives sometimes we can get under bondage in our lives and say you know what I'm just willing to accept this bondage in my lives in my life and you know it's just what God has appointed me so I'm just going to March forward with this bondage you know if it's bondage brothers and sisters if it's contrary to the word of God it's bondage and you don't have to accept it we don't have to tolerate it in our lives it's a devil that's trying to have a strong hold in our lives and he doesn't have to have a stronghold and you know the word stronghold can be used two ways one is to actually have a strong grip a stronghold you're holding on very strong another one is the castle a fortified building a place where you're safe a stronghold and we don't want a devil to have either one of those in our lives do we not one of us so we got to be careful what we're feeding on because you are what you eat and you know we can say brother Barry you know I eat the best of foods it's all organic and sometimes we do and I know really Ken he used to preach it many times he would say we can eat the best of foods and brother Branham even says it too but we'll poke anything down our throats we got to be careful that was probably a hybrid of what brother Ken would say and what brother Bradham said but you know if we go to McDonald's and eat at McDonald's guess what's going to happen if we keep eating there we're going to get unhealthy if we only eat fast food but if we actually exercise we want to have some strong meat why do we want strong meat because there's protein in it and that helps heal the cells in our bodies it helps us grow and it's the same thing with the word of God we've got to be willing to eat strong meat of the word and not not worry about eating fast food you know what I just come to church once or twice a week and I just say God bless you and I just have a 15-minute prayer session and a little bit of song and and say Amen once or twice and then I go home and I'm good for the week brothers and sisters that fast food will kill you we've got to be coming to church prepared we've got to come to church with our hearts ready to hear the word of God not just have the song leader struggle to try and till the soil and the hearts of the people to shake off all of the cares of this life we don't want to eat local weed it can make us in trouble it could make us sick you know one of the worst things that can happen is for us to get spiritually sick one thing to get sick in our bodies because we can say God's our healer and we know that we've been healed before in the past and he'll come and do it again but when we get spiritually sick brothers and sisters we don't necessarily see it we can be blind to that and say you know what everything is fine in my life I'm healthy my bank account's full I got a great house I've got a perfect family everything is going on just fine the church is great everything is fine but spiritually sick and not even know it out of questions and answers brother Bradham he says let's see do you believe this is a question given to brother Brown he's reading it here do you believe that God gives the Holy Spirit to everyone that is truly born again Christian at the time they accept salvation or do you believe that this is a different work of Grace that in the experience of most Christians comes later please clarify this subject as many are confused because of the different teaching on this subject now if I don't answer this correctly well then you ask me I'll put it on my desk for tonight and then I'll get a hold of it he says now Christian friend a person cannot be born again until they have received the Holy Spirit see you can't you are not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost if you ever wonder why brother Barry harps on the Holy Ghost that's why and I think it's a beautiful beautiful discussion today because brothers and sisters we're not talking about working our way up into something and many times I think we can look at the stature of a perfect man and think that you know I'm going to add to my my faith virtue and I'm going to add to my virtue knowledge and I'm going to add to my knowledge Temperance and I'm going to add to that and I'm going to add to that and before long I'm going to have worked my way to a place where I'm actually going to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't think that's the case I don't think brother Branham says that's the case either he says we get it all together and you know what if you want a just simple example of that if you're a son today you always were a son even yet while you were dead and sins and trespasses in this flesh you already were a son or a daughter of God you just didn't know it that's what the new birth is God revealing himself personally to the individual but don't think that we're going to work our way into the Holy Ghost we're not just going to exercise and come to church and go home and read our Bibles and pray and suddenly one day we're just going to have the Holy Ghost because we've done enough works no it's when we open our heart to God and when we go on our knees and we pray from the innermost Parts when we say Lord there's no doors inside a door here every single door in the heart of this person is wide open unto you and just be it unto me according to Thy word and when he comes into you you'll have that spiritual connection that spiritual connection conception will take place that word will hit the seed Gene of God that he placed before the foundation of the world in that little space that he's made in the human heart and when that happens the life that comes forward inside the individual will only be one life it won't be our life plus his or his life plus ours it will just be his just his only Jesus Christ just like it was in Mary brother Adam says no if I don't answer this correctly well then you ask me I'll put it on my desk for tonight I'll get a hold of it now Christian friend a person cannot be born again until they have received the Holy Spirit see you can't you are not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost now I just want to say this I'm not saying this to discourage anybody I'm saying this to encourage all of us to recognize that the work of Grace it's already done all we have to do is accept it if we're willing to accept it according to the word for our day then you've got it all right now Brothers and Sisters You've got it all it's already there I'm not say you're lost before you receive the Holy Ghost because you're not there's three there's one work of Grace only one work of Grace that's the Holy Spirit and and it's made in three manifestations just like there's one God made in three manifestations father son Holy Spirit one God one only one now there's three works of Grace but three manifestations there's a manifestation of justification by faith a man believes God says yes sir I believe that I believe there's a true God and now for my personal savior I accept Jesus Christ his son as my personal savior now that's what's called justification by faith and that's what the disciples receive first it's a long quote I know it you're probably wondering brother Barry where are you going we all know this what I want to do is get right to where the rubber meets the road today brothers and sisters and talk about strongholds in our lives and recognize that this work of Grace it's all encompassing it's completely overshadowing all of the cares of this world and all the life problems that we think we have if we can change our perspective we can change our perception of this life that we live and look at it through the lens of God I think we can probably see maybe just a uh maybe a little easier time in our lives and that's what I would really like to see is just a bit of encouragement in our lives to just look at things a little bit differently to recognize that when you're looking at something brothers and sisters if you're truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it's not you that's looking it's God that's looking at it and this is kind of the punch line that I wanted to get at you know we we read the scripture out of Exodus chapter 14 and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and today brothers and sisters we talk about the pillar of fire and we talk about the cloud but what if we stop looking at the pillar of fire and looking at the cloud and start looking at our lives through the pillar of fire and through the cloud take a step and put ourselves in the pillar of Fire and Put ourselves in that cloud that happened on 1963 and recognize that it's God's work his own life that we're living out through our lives it's not us living Our Lives thinking we're going to and fro working better getting better careers and nicer houses and better cars and all the clothes and everything that we do in our lives we're manifesting Christ here on Earth that's what this age is doing brothers and sisters brother Branham goes on to say no the next thing this man will go out and today he might Smoke Drink curse do things that his habits is hanging on to him it's just rooted in there it's spirits habits are spirits I'm just going to pause there and say that habits are spirits if we've got habits in our lives brothers and sisters are they edifying to your body spiritually and naturally if they're not they're an evil spirit we need to just pause there and recognize that we're either for God or we're for the world and we know that Jesus said you can't serve God and Mammon together you can only serve one and if you serve one you'll hate the other we need to make sure that if we've got a habit in our life that it is edifying to your body spiritually and physically now the next thing this man will go out today he might Smoke Drink curse do things his habits is just hanging on to him it's rooted in there it's a strong hold in his life and you know brothers and sisters preaching to the choir here I'm preaching to me I recognize this there's things in my life where Satan has had strongholds on but you know what there's a way out there is an escape from strongholds there is an escape from these things that the devil wants to try and say no it's just a genetic to default it's from another generation you just have to serve that Master you just have to accept what he's done your grandfather did it so it's just something you have to take you don't have to take it you can tell him no I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and I overcome you by the blood of the lamb and by my testimony of the word that I believe for my day he might do things his habits just hanging on to him it's rooted in there it's Spirits habits are spirits the Bible said they're unclean spirits in men now he was maybe he's lustful brother speaking here he says excuse this we're a mixed audience and I say it this morning excuse this we're a mixed audience brother Branham says but we're we're standing in the Judgment House of God see and we must say these things clear for instance men sometimes especially men become lustful sex maniac and not only that but just lustful the way women dress in things today no wonder they are but and if the woman becomes the same way lustful Spirits get on them he says in their nice little ladies and then he put on short clothes and little bitty things around them which looks terrible they get out why they don't want to be bad but they don't realize that old-fashioned demon spirit is working on them and brothers and sisters if we just pause there how many people in this world have an old passion demon Spirit working on them we can't look at a magazine we can't look at a billboard doesn't matter what is being advertised they're using a woman to to capture the attention to say look at look it it's it's a it's a bathtub or it's a toilet or it's a car or it's a house or it's a festival whatever it is they're trying to use a woman to capture the attention of humans they don't realize that it's an old-fashioned demon Spirit that's working on them he says they don't do that to appear before God they do it not to be cool because pure science proves you that you take your clothes off the hot air on your body is more harder to you than what it is when you got your clothes on he says the Indian girls in Arizona are beautiful a lot more than what you see one of these nudes and she don't only put her clothes on but a big blanket around her when she walks across the desert to keep cool on perspiration when the heat comes up then then it's air conditioning see so it's it's nothing in the world but a lust passion spirit he says maybe you're lady enough not to do anything wrong to live untrue to your husband or to your own morals but my sister that's disgraceful and you don't realize if you could look in God's looking glass here and find out what God said about that it's an evil spirit that's on you and you don't realize it I just can't help but think brothers and sisters sometimes in our lives we can have an influence and not recognize where that influence comes from brother Branham calls it out very clearly here if we have that desire a sister to represent any part of our body that's untowards brother Brown I'm just clarified what kind of spirit it is the same thing with the brothers if we're wanting to to show our bodies off for any reason Brothers there's only one reason it's because of that Spirit that's on us and you know what we need to make sure that we have one Spirit on us and that's the Holy Spirit and when we have the Holy Spirit we're going to recognize these things and you know sometimes in our lives brothers and sisters this is why I'm saying this sometimes in our lives we don't even recognize that we have this hanging on to us but what happens is we go to church and we hear some preaching and something says to us in our heart hey wait a second have I done that hey wait a second have I seen that what's going on in my life and you know what we shake our heads and we say whoa and that's the moment that we have the opportunity to say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord Heal My Soul or step back and get worse and that's what we're faced with in this hour brothers and sisters there's no middle ground to just stay neutral about it he goes on to say Mary Magdalene didn't realize the spirits that was on her see well now when you get that kind of spirit on you or men you get out here and start lusting for women it's you say well it's Human Nature he says not like that not like that Brothers if we've got that problem in our lives that's not according to the word that's an evil spirit that's on us and we need to recognize it we can't blame it on our wives and say oh it's your fault can you imagine that standing before God and saying that daughter of God that you gave me that daughter of yours you gave her to me and it's her fault Mary Magdalene didn't realize the spirits that was on her see well now would you get that kind of spirit on you or men you get out here and start lusting for women you say well it's human nature not like that see he says no it's a spirit the Bible said it was a spirit that's right so the thing to do then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from lust and passion he says it's called sanctification the word sanctification means to be cleaned and set aside for service you get what I'm he says now that lust Spirit leaves you under sanctification Brothers sisters anyone if you're dealing with Allah spirit you're still being Sanctified there's still something trying to cleanse you out that spirit's got to go and you know what I've heard it said I'll say it this way the way I've heard it said and forgive me for it I know we're in a mixed audience starve it out that's what we got to do brothers and sisters starve it out you know if we're dealing with a spirit in a certain way in our lives regardless if it's Allah Spirit if it's a music Spirit starve it out if it's a social media Spirit starve it out the only way you're going to get rid of it if it's a smoking Spirit stop it drinking stop it if you keep going around that and being influenced by it you're feeding it spirit the Bible said it was a spirit that's right so the thing to do then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from lust and passion called sanctification the word sanctification means to be cleaned out set aside for service and what service service for the king service to be filled with his holy ghost service to be the literal manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ in Flesh on Earth before the Rapture of the church that's brother Barry's words he says let a little nice little lady nice goes to church he sings in the choir but she has to mow her grass with a little pair of shorts on let her get Sanctified one time and let her put on a Piercy let that man that'll almost have a wreck looking at that woman in the yard and let him get Sanctified one time and go down the street he'll keep his mind on exactly what he's doing that's exactly right if he gazes sideways he'll turn his head this way the holy spirit says turn your head that's it see there you are see that's right that's sanctification that's out of questions and answers the law having a shadow 1954 brother Branham brothers and sisters we're dealing with strongholds in our lives we're dealing with strongholds that want to get in our children's lives we're dealing with strongholds that want to get inside the church we're dealing with strongholds and you know what they are they're Devils they're Devils that want to get in our lives and mix us up and say no you've got this problem you've just got this thing you don't you can't get rid of it you're never going to get you're never going to outgrow it yes you will I'm here to say yes you will I'm not here to say you're going to be overcome you're going to be an overcomer you're gonna go and sit with him in his throne but the only way you're going to do that is to have a contrite spirit brothers and sisters you know what's going to keep you from actually being able to do that to be able to overcome what's going to stop the church from being able to overcome you'll never be able to stop completely if you truly are a son and daughter of God but you know what will happen you can have pride in your life Pride will keep you from saying nope I don't have that problem nope I don't have a problem you know what brothers and sisters the word of God says to confess your faults one to another to pray for one another that you may be healed if you're dealing with something in your life you're not healed from maybe just try taking the word of God and just pour a little bit of into your life and say oh my I'm going to find someone I've got confidence in you know what if it's a husband you got a wife if you're a wife and you've got a husband they're the ones you can trust man pour it out to them tell them we heard it said at the The Men's breakfast our husband or our wife is God's Divine portion for us if we can't trust them who can we trust if you feel uncomfortable that way find a brother or a sister you can trust but confess your faults we're all humans dealing with spirits that want to have strongholds but you know what if we're willing to just apply the word pour that word out into our lives you know what we'll do is tear it out in the strongholds we'll cast down Devils we'll get rid of them they'll have no power they'll have no hold there won't be any any any family genetics that will have control over our lives when that Holy Ghost comes in brothers and sisters he burns it all out and that's what I wanted to do today was try and encourage us you know what if we stop looking at the problems through our human flesh and saying I've got this thing I've I've got these ribs they just hurt what what if I was to just step inside the pillar of fire and say but my word says you're already healed my word says that that by my stripes you're already healed brother Barry what what if I started to look at my life that way if I had a need in my life what would God say about the need that I have in my life instead of saying that I just have this need in my life maybe I'm crazy but I say just leave me here I like it it's good you know what we want to do brothers and sisters is we want to get into the person of Jesus Christ and recognize his presence recognize really what the message of the hour is it's not just a Creed it's not just a Dogma it's not a book of do's and don'ts the the seven Church H book is not just a book of do's and don'ts and this is the the thing that we follow what we follow is Christ but what happened the purpose for the message of the hour was to introduce the bride to the bridegroom to introduce Jesus Christ to this world and you know when brother Branham went off the scene people will say well you worship brother Bradham then no we don't he was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man so where is the son of man today brothers and sisters we're living in the son of man Ministry and we know that when we go into the Millennium we're going into the son of David Ministry that Throne that's Eternal that will never disappear but currently right now where are we brothers and sisters if we can recognize our position in Christ then the Rapture will go if we can recognize what it is the church when we can recognize it then the Rapture will go why is that because the bread of life will be open before our eyes our eyes will be open to really what our position is and what our position really is brothers and sisters is that you are the literal manifestation of Christ if you have his spirit in you who are you are you yourself the word says that we become a new creature in Christ Jesus and that new creature isn't going to be anything but Jesus Christ himself I I just love this word questions and answers 1964. brother Branham he says when you use the expression that if we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the foolish virgin will live eternally but they will be separated from the New Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with the bride here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth require all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again but the Branham says absolutely I just explained that this morning the same on the same thing you've got to have all stages your begotten of the spirit just like a baby has begotten and in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost we've got to receive the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters that's what causes the new birth it's not just coming to church and saying well I I believe that God sent a prophet and I believe that Jesus died on a cross it's getting the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's what the new birth is and when we get that new birth and this Bible becomes a new book to us then we can see Jesus Christ in print form they're not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you're born then you're not converted you're in the process of being converted until that time that wonderful to think about I grew up in the Pentecostal sort of offshoot and there was always some sort of Revival and something happening and and you know Ministries coming through and and there's people being born again all over the place and and and people were were dealing with conversions and and and people getting saved and and all this stuff was happening but I wonder I think back now and I wonder how many were truly getting born again they were called being born again but were they truly being born again because they had not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they were baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost so what's happening here brother Branham says is they're just still being converted and truly believing with all of their hearts to the manifestation of gifts I remember seeing all kinds of stuff in the church but you know brothers and sisters they couldn't go on and receive the word and that's the trick today we look at the first and second polls in brother Brown's Ministry and sometimes we could say where's the Third Paul in my life you know what the third poll is it's the opening of the word it's being able to say Amen to every word that's what the third pull is it's not some great wondrous work where we can just speak the word to go and heal someone in our lives you know what they're already healed they have to be the ones to accept that healing in the name of Jesus Christ we're not dealing the first poll we're not dealing the second poll we're dealing with a third pull and the third poll is the is the word manifestation of Jesus Christ and where is that word manifestation it has to be on our lips it's got to be in our voice it's got to be in our very lives that we live your begotten of the spirit just like a baby has begotten and in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you're born then you're not converted you're in the process of being converted until that time that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age that has passed by us the Pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten now the person of Christ himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come until now this is 1964. so brother Branham here we might have some people say well you've got the prophet of God saying it couldn't come until now in 1964. so what does that mean brothers and sisters he means one of two things either well maybe one of three things either Jesus Christ is alive on Earth again walking around in his Corporal body which we know that's not supposed to happen until Revelations 19 so we can rule that out he has come in the manifestation of William Miriam Branham and people say that it's Christ Branham and we know that that's a devil a doctrine of a devil and we don't say that we won't agree with that not for a second a True Believer won't say that brother Branham was Christ in flesh so what's the only other option where is Christ made flesh has got to be in his bride those children that say Amen to his word he said now the person of Christ himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come until now it had to be the right time right brothers and sisters that's right so you know what I want to do today I want to bring up the slides Brothers if you don't mind I did a little tiny PowerPoint just for the sake of discussion today maybe I'm getting a little more used to uh the technology I think that uh there's just a point that I wanted to make I I said it before and I don't know if it really was clear but and of course I can't get this to work now oh my it's not going to work all right so the statue of the perfect man we're very familiar with this brother Branham preaches on it extensively and uh and we all know it very well but there's just one point that I want to make and and if we can just go to the first slide we have this this pyramid that we're very familiar with and on the left side we have the church ages of the pyramid and and The Messengers on the right side we've got the lion oxman and Eagle we've got the the wheat and we know that it starts in the seed and it goes to the stock then it goes to tassel then it goes to the shuck and we have the the seed again and we know we heard brother Mervin say it uh real well that that seed has to be a rotten seed and that's what has to happen to our lives our lives has to become rotten we've got to die out to ourselves brothers and sisters we we talked about it last week we we have to have a contrite spirit and we'll get into that in a little bit but we can't just say that everything is going to be okay and I'm going to be myself and and everything is going to be uh normal it's not going to be normal when you truly get the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're no longer normal what people would call normal but we have this pyramid that we talk about the stature of the perfect man I mentioned it earlier we have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then we have Grace and love that Capstone Ministry that comes down on top of that pyramid and that's what we're so accustomed to to being taught and and we preach even and you know what I'm not I don't want to do away with any of that but if you could go to the next slide please we have another example of it the Great Pyramid brother Branham says the Great Pyramid was never capped he also says that I believe Enoch built the Pyramid and it wasn't kept because the builders rejected the stone that became the corner they didn't put a cap on top of that pyramid and it was a witness that they rejected that stone that Capstone but we know in our day there is this Capstone that's coming and many times I think by the way that this is represented it can show it as some sort of future tense event that's going to happen but if you could go to the next slide brother I just want to show this just for an example today that there is coming a Time brothers and sisters where there's going to be no space between any one of those levels any one of those virtues and you know that time is now brothers and sisters and what I wanted to do maybe someone could help me with this if they're technologically advanced is to actually show that entire pyramid as gold because there's coming a time where it becomes one the two are not one if if you want to see what I'm talking about for the sake of time I don't have all the quotes I've got other quotes today look up stature of a perfect man and listen to brother Branham talk about the two becoming one there isn't a space between them I'll never forget the first time I heard that it was brother Meadow that said that he said there's no mortar between those stones there will be no mortar between that Capstone and his church that stone that Capstone is made to fit exactly the same as the church and you know brothers and sisters it's one pyramid it's not two there's no future event that's coming right now as we speak as we come to church as we Fellowship around the word of God that Capstone is coming down in our lives and we know what that is that's love that's charity that's Jesus Christ himself so brothers and sisters I want to say to us today that as we have that thank you brother for the for the slides what habits do we have in our lives what do we fill our time with you might say brother Barry now you're getting personal you're stepping on toes I don't want to step on toes but I want to make sure we're not eating local weed brothers and sisters I want to make sure that we're healthy and I know by experience myself that if I'm not careful I'll go and just eat local weed this flesh wants to eat local weed man it looks good to the body it looks so appealing doesn't it but it will make us crazy it will make us so there's nothing that can be done with us and you know what it does is it just opens the door to Spirits brothers and sisters I'll say it for for example I've experienced it in my life to go and do something that I know I shouldn't do as a Believer and you know what happens it will take you a lot farther than you think you want to go it will take you and it will cost you a lot more than you want to pay and you know you'll have a problem in your life if you just allow one little thing to happen in your life brothers and sisters that's all satan wants I quit smoking many times when I was a smoker in my life and I found out even in the world that you know what cigarettes are devils and they never come alone and that I would say oh I quit but someone would say come on have a smoke just go for it and I hope this is okay I'm not being too liberal but you know it was in the world and I've been delivered from it because of the blood of Jesus Christ I can only talk about what's gone on in my life but you know any time that I would have quit else I had to do was not do it anymore just don't do it anymore and I'd be done with it but there was always a time where I would just have one and as soon as I had one well there's five and before long there's 25 and then there's a carton and before long you're looking back saying man a year and a half ago I quit smoking but I'm smoking now how did that happen brothers and sisters that's the way it is with the devil especially for Sons and Daughters of God if you have been delivered from something don't look back remember Lot's wife she turned to a pillar of salt because she looked back there was something in her heart that wanted her to look back don't do it what habits do you have brothers and sisters what do we fill our time with then if we don't want to call it habits what do we fill our time with what is it that's influencing Our Lives is it from God or is it from the world because it's one or the other it's a pretty bold statement but it truly is one or the other one is going to edify the body of Jesus Christ's life inside of us and one is going to canker it it's going to quash it it's going to push out that light but you know what if we can determine what the inspiration is behind it then we can guarantee where it comes from if we can identify the inspiration that's behind it is from God if it's based on the word of God then just keep going with it brothers and sisters because it's going to be beneficial to your body spiritually speaking but you know what happens is it starts to manifest in our physical bodies you might say brother Barry how can that be well you know what if we're doing something and it causes us to have a behavior in our lives whatever it is is it of of Christ is is the nature that we display while we're doing what we're doing of Christ or not because if it's not of Christ we can tell what the inspiration is you know brothers and sisters look at the clothing today what's the inspiration for clothing today comes from Hollywood from designers everybody wants to be a part of the lead designers you know many of the clothing designers want to get an endorsement from some crazy star from Hollywood or or maybe an athlete isn't that what it is it's all about some sort of stardom and some sort of inspiration behind it they could get their name get their endorsement on it we know that people in sports it's one thing to be a good player in sports but it's a totally different level it's the next level from professional sports when you start to get endorsements from manufacturers right that's what they're after what's the inspiration behind that so if we've got clothing that has to say a certain thing on it brothers and sisters what's the inspiration behind that you think there's no Spirits attached to that think again we can say oh no no no no there's no Spirits because I've got it I've cast out those demons but what are you reflecting to the world what inspiration is behind women's clothing the whole entire industry and then I'll say what's the inspiration behind men's clothing the entire men's industry and you might say well brother Barry why would you say that well think about it brothers and sisters we're living in a solemn condition how many of the manufacturers the ones who are actually designing the clothes for men today are women how many of them are women that actually believe this word for our day none of them most of them are men most of them are living in a Sodom Condition what Kind of world do we live in here my goodness but you know what's behind our habits brothers and sisters what's the inspiration in our lives behind the habits the things that we do the way we fill our time I have habits I'll say it I'm not afraid to say it you know what I did I got onto Facebook a little while ago and I'll tell you I told you I got onto Facebook a little while ago so that I could get in the marketplace it's a beautiful thing there's really good deals but you got to go through Facebook to do it oh my goodness can it ever be a bottomless pit it's a bottomless pit and you know what I found in my life I got to be careful I gotta watch it it can become a habit and that's not edifying the word in my life but what's inspiring our habits brothers and sisters is it watching is it watching screen time is it movies is it music because all of it it's either inspired by God or it's not and you know we've heard it said many times brothers and sisters we can have Christian rock and roll can we there's no such thing it's a lie of the devil there's no such thing as Christian rock there's no such thing as Christian rap there's no such thing as anything other than worship songs unto the Lord if we're listening to music and it sounds like the world it's because it's of the world it's an inspired song of the devil that's trying to capture your inspiration what's the other thing one other thing that we can be doing brothers and sisters gaming gaming we can be playing video games I want to say this who manufactured the game whatever the game is there can be all kinds of different games I know there's so many different kinds of games who manufactured the game and what's the inspiration behind it is it to edify the word in our lives is that video game an inspiration to the word or is it from the pit of Hell that's up to you to decide that Holy Ghost and you will determine that but you know it's either leading us closer to God or it's the most subtle voice of the field because it's the same devil isn't it the same serpent that old serpent the devil that came to speak to Eve is the same one that's whispering in the ear of the Bride today you can do it you have control you don't have to worry you know the message of the hour oh you've got the Holy Ghost because you can say Amen to the word but you know what if you do have the Holy Ghost in your life you're going to say uh-uh I'm going to look the other way man I'm not looking at that girl over there on the street I'm not going to look to that other thing that that is so tantalizing to my flesh I'm going to turn away and I'm going to look to Jesus I'm not going to allow that thing to ruin my life any longer and you know what brothers and sisters the more we conquer devils like that because that's what they are we got to call them what they are the more we conquer these Devils the less local weed we're gonna eat and you know what we're going to find ourselves in a position where Satan just won't even know what to do with us because we won't eat that food anymore we won't eat those weeds but as long as we keep eating them as long as I keep opening up Facebook and saying well I can see that guy and that guy and that guy and you know what I can do I can look up friends that I knew from before in the past and I can see how they're doing I can be creepy with it and it'll be fine nobody will know you know let's design that way for a purpose to capture our attention and just suck Us in how many other things are there in this world just like Facebook brothers and sisters my goodness the inspiration behind our habits what is it is leading us closer to God or it's the most subtle beast of the field it's one or the other remember brother Branham said it in the first quote that we read habits are spirits actually a second quote that we read habits are spirits they're actually spirits and you know what the holy spirit is going to become a habit for us to go on our knees and pray for our brothers and sisters the holy spirit is going to be a habit for us to say oh my I know that that brother said that and I know that sister said that but I'm just going to say bless God I know their sons and daughters of God and I'm just going to say I can't wait to have that grand reunion with them over there on the other side because they're my brother and they're my sister and it doesn't matter what happens we can have habits that are good and we can have habits that are bad and brothers and sisters here we go this is where the rubber meets the road in our lives we're talking about tearing down strongholds casting down imaginations that would try and exalt themselves against the word of God in our lives right that's really what we're after that's the scripture that we read in second Corinthians this morning looking at things through the pillar of fire just like God did for the children of Israel when they had the Egyptians the whole Egyptian Army after them hot on their Trail and you know brothers and sisters you can put yourself in that position we can put ourselves in opposition and say we are the children of Israel and we got our back up against the mountain we got our back up against the the sea and here comes all the Devils of Hell raging in their chariots after us what are we going to do and we know that God said to Moses what are you crying to me for speak the word all we need to do is speak the word we just need to put ourselves in that Pillar of Fire better yet get that Pillar of Fire Inside you and you're going to have a different perspective on it but if you're wondering if something that you're dealing with in your life is a is a habit stop doing it stop it completely I want to give us a challenge stop it brother Barry turn off Facebook brother Berry get rid of the app entirely okay challenge accepted we know that that's something that's out there now it's a big thing challenge accepted okay challenge accepted brother Barry this is this is what brother Branham called Fresh I'm getting this as I'm talking to you here this ain't in the notes okay challenge accepted I don't need Marketplace who cares about Marketplace I can go to Kijiji brothers and sisters their habits though if we can't stop doing it what's wrong with us and you know what I want to say I want to throw this out there if you stop doing it what happens to you when you stop doing it does it make you happy or do you get angry does it make you feel like you're going with through withdrawals I just can't deal with myself I can't deal with this situation because I have to go back on Facebook oh my goodness I can't live without seeing what everyone's doing in their lives you know what if that's what happens to me it's a devil it's a devil pull down that stronghold brothers and sisters don't let it have a hold in your life if you want to know just stop doing it for a while and see how you react to it is it an addiction is Facebook an addiction for brother Barry my goodness but if it makes you I'm angry to stop doing something just take a step backwards brothers and sisters and look at the inspiration of it see where that inspiration comes from see if it's truly from God if it's not from God let alone just leave it alone because you know what it's going to do it's going to drag you down and you know what it's going to do it's going to drag your family down you know what it's going to do it's going to drag your church down and you know what it's going to do it's going to take you and put you in a cage and that devil is going to not stop until he has destroyed your life destroyed your experience and you know what if you have a devil with a strong hold in your life brothers and sisters just confess it to someone confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed and you will be delivered of it you don't have to stay in that position is the inspiration of whatever it is of Christ or is it of Satan I think that's such an important question you know we've heard it said many times in the scripture do all things unto Christ if we can't do something with you or without Jesus Christ in our lives then why are we doing it it applies why would we listen to whatever we're listening to without Jesus Christ say here brother Jesus why don't you put these headphones on and listen to this great song that I like secretly nobody else knows I listen to it but I just can't get it out of my system I just love it and you know brothers and sisters I'll tell you music has a major influence for me and and I'm not drawn to it by the blood of the lamb and by the testimony of Jesus Christ but isn't it interesting how does Facebook know a lot of the music that I used to listen to before I even got on Facebook I'll tell you how because it's not of God it's an inspiration of the devil the devil remembers the music that he used to have a grip in my life with and he wants me to have that that burden in my life he wants to get that strong hold in my life again but I won't give it to him but it's interesting because I experienced that and I find myself going high I remember that song you know and then I'm like what am I doing on Facebook wasting my time and you know what I I don't really have anything against Facebook if anybody's on it I'm not saying you shouldn't have it in your life because I think there's a balance too and I think that there is a possibility for a pastor or a Ministry to overstep and say that you should do this and you shouldn't do that I say this this is all I'll say just what my pastor taught me that I grew up in he said get the Holy Ghost in your life and he'll tell you the spirit of truth will tell you what you should or should not do and you know many times I'd go to him and ask him that and he would never tell me he would never tell me what the answer is he'd say you know what you got to get the answer you're the one that's got to do the work God needs to reveal it to you personally and when he does nobody can change it from you because if someone can talk you into it then the devil can talk you right out of it and you'll be right back to where you were we talked about it last week brothers and sisters you know out of Isaiah God bless you brother Isaiah I don't even have it here open we talked about having a contrite heart and having a humble spirit you know what that word contrite means out of Strong's it's number 1793 it means crushed powder destruction having a contrite spirit knowing that our spirit if we've got our will and our spirit brothers and sisters it ain't been crushed yet and you know what has to happen it's got to be crushed it's got to be destroyed our own perspective we've got to get rid of it we've got to let it be Jesus Christ in our lives and this word contrite out of strong 1793 comes from 1792. I typically don't like doing this because the root of a word the root of a root of a root it just makes my eyes flutter back in my head but I think it's so important for us to look at this because of where this word comes from from 1792 of the strongs it means to crumble transitively to bruise literally or figuratively to beat to pieces how much of this old nature do we want to have in our lives brothers and sisters the word says that we've got to have a contrite heart to crumble transitively to bruise literally or figuratively to beat to pieces to break in pieces bruise contrite Crush destroy humble we've got a contrite heart our old nature is going to be gone there's not going to be anything left in our nature how much of Jesus old nature do you think was in him when he made it to Calvary when he finally made it up there after being whipped almost to death my goodness after that prayer meeting in the garden after healing that servant's ear that his his follower cut off all the things that he had to go through and suffer the the robe being put on him and then torn off tearing off all of those those scabs of blood the the crown of thorns put upon his head talk about being crushed talk about being destroyed that's what Jesus went through how much persecution did we go through in our lives my goodness I've got to just turn off Facebook are you kidding me that's terrible I can hardly do that what a ridiculous thing that is to even think about to think that I would be challenged to do that but you know what the devil's subtle he's going to come at us with every single angle that he's got because he can't come and crucify us on a tree he missed his opportunity he can't put a crown of thorns on our head he can't whip us with the cat of nine tails until we're just about bled out to nothing the only thing he can do is Captivate our attention distract Us in any way possible from realizing truly who we are from realizing truly The Authority that lies in us already as a son and daughter of God Isaiah 57 when thou Christ let thy companies deliver thee but when the but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall strike them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my Holy Mountain and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people with us saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones those who are willing to die out to themselves those are the ones that are going to inhabit eternity those are the ones that are going to inhabit the most high those ones who say no no I've got it I'm good I you know what I I don't need to listen to that I I it's all good I I believe what I believe and there's nothing you can tell me you know what there isn't there isn't because the devil's got a stronghold this is the word of God this is what the prophet of God spoke about this is what he preached you know brothers and sisters if we haven't had a new birth and we say that everything is okay brother Branham says we ain't ready for a ceiling remember the quote that we read last week I'll call the musicians up as we close today remember the the quote that we read last week brother Branham talking about the boxcar and the inspector coming by and shaking The Boxcar and seeing what's inside it has everything been packed properly because if it hasn't been packed properly then we can't seal it it can't make it to its destination everything that's inside of it is actually going to be damaged we can say that everything is okay but we ain't ready for sealing yet if we haven't had a new birth but when God sees a man contrite broken Spirit sincere in heart come down at the altar God closes the door of the world to him and seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters stand with me today I don't want to have an altar call but I do want to have an altar call I want to say to you the altar of God is open and if there's anything in our lives that we want to change we want to make right brother Branham said it here we ain't ready for sealing if we say that everything is all good in our lives and there's nothing wrong but when God sees a man contrite remember we talked about that a spirit that's crushed there's no more pride in me you can't take anything more out of me remember job he was contrite he said there's nothing more I wish that I hadn't even have been born because there's nothing in me more to give I can't do anything I can't say anything I can't be anything we got to be contrite we got to recognize that there's nothing in our lives that is going to save me but until we get there we're not going to receive the Holy Ghost God's going to allow us to remain right there in that position and we can sometimes just get stuck in sanctification brothers and sisters don't get stuck in the second phase of it go all the way into Christ get the baptism of the holy spirit so you know that you know that you know the only way you're going to get that though is to have a contrite heart to not have anything inside of me to say no no no I know I'm good I don't need any more if you if that's the way it is then that's the way it is that's the way it'll be since we ain't ready for sealing but when God sees a man contrite broken Spirit sincere in heart down at the altar God closes the door of the world to him and seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus comes not from one Revival to the other but until the day of your Redemption brothers and sisters we don't want to have a stronghold in our lives the only stronghold we want in our lives is a stronghold for the Holy Ghost we want to be fortified with the word in our lives to recognize there ain't no devil that's going to have any hold on me and you know what brothers and sisters if there is one if you could look at your life and recognize that there is one you can get rid of it right now you don't have to come to the altar you just have to have a contrite heart you've got to be willing to say take it out of me Lord you take it out of me and I'll go forwards and do what I need to do to make it right in my life and he will [Music] a devil wants to have a stronghold in your life the devil wants to have a stronghold in my life but we we read this earlier today in in Corinthians second Corinthians we're looking at pulling down strongholds the weapons of our Warfare brothers and sisters are Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and you know I I just want to say this for those people who are into war and understand we have got laser guided ordinances for the devil we have got Precision Munitions to destroy those Devils out of our lives he's not going to blow up our whole house he's just going to surgically remove that devil from our life and that devil is going to sing to you no no no no if you do something if you do anything about this then the whole church is going to know and everybody you know what that's a lie of the devil he wants to keep you exactly where he's got you your brother isn't going to think any less of you he's going to think more of you because you've got the spirit of God and you know what your brother might say my I admire his courage I wish I had courage like that same thing with the sister cast out imaginations brother your sisters humble yourselves in the sight of your lord of the Lord and what will he do he'll lift you up he'll take you and he'll give you the baptism of the Holy Spirit if you can humble yourself in his sight and then you know what there ain't no devil that's going to have a hold in your life they'll try and hold on they'll try and grab on they'll try and drag you down but there'll always be a sermon somewhere somehow someone will say something a message might say it a brother could call you you could get a text message something will come your way and it'll just be that little still small voice of the Lord speaking to you and you'll say oh my be it unto me according to your word Lord and you'll just go to prayer and say Lord forgive me and it'll be over that'll be the end of it God bless you this morning that's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness to us Lord I pray this morning Father that there would be no strongholds in the lives of your children today Father Lord Jesus that at the preaching of your word we could pull down strongholds father Lord Jesus and casting down any imagination that would exalt itself against your word that would say oh I'm good I don't have to go any further I I believe this my whole entire life oh Father help us to just put aside all of our thinking Lord and allow you to wash Us by the water of your word oh Father to fill us with your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus to pack the boxcar all the way father that there would be no room for anything else in our lives Lord Jesus because we know that you're coming father your appearing
