[20:05] Heavenly Father

[20:11] Gather in this house father
[20:16] not knowing Lord
[20:19] whether we will do it again father and
[20:22] we actually look forward to that day
[20:23] Lord when it actually is taken away
[20:25] because we Lo Lord if he gets taken away
[20:28] then
[20:30] it was time forward and there was no
[20:32] longer a requirement or a need Lord that
[20:35] you brought us to a place that
[20:38] father you moved us further
[20:40] into yourself father
[20:43] and truly Lord that is our heart's
[20:44] desire Lord
[20:47] father we seem to sometimes to be just
[20:49] putting in Time Lord and waiting upon
[20:52] the promise to fully be fulfilled
[20:58] we're so thankful Lord for what you've
[21:01] done for us

[21:17] have a body father on Earth that you can
[21:19] dwell in

[21:24] that is your bride
[21:27] and Lord by thoughts of Grace Lord
[21:29] father in Revelation our hearts father
[21:32] we count ourselves among that body
[21:34] not thoughts or fantasy Lord but
[21:38] through Revelation anchored father you
[21:40] told us time and time again about that
[21:42] guidepost Lord

[22:46] things you've done in our lives father

[22:53] Revelation father the many blessings
[22:55] Lord
[22:57] but Lord we just asked One More Time
[22:59] Lord you would come Among Us yes

[23:06] needs healing father

[39:59] amen thank you musicians
[40:02] it's again so wonderful to have the
[40:05] gifts in the body
[40:06] just like to turn to the book of
[40:08] Ephesians tonight once again talk about
[40:10] our position just from a little bit of a
[40:13] different angle
[40:16] I believe the Lord was real good to me
[40:18] showed me a little bit of a direction
[40:20] here with this and
[40:21] it's beautiful when he does that
[40:24] Ephesians chapter one tonight
[40:28] remember brother Branham said the book
[40:30] of Ephesians
[40:32] parallels the Book of Joshua
[40:35] but not just parallels it it perfectly
[40:38] parallels the Book of Joshua
[40:40] as the children of Israel were being
[40:42] positionally placed brought into the
[40:45] promised land all of the years of the
[40:47] promise was given
[40:49] you know they find themselves now there
[40:51] came a day where they were actually
[40:53] going forwards where the word of God was
[40:57] going across that Jordan River and that
[40:59] meant the the difference between life
[41:01] and death that was the difference
[41:03] between being in Perfection according to
[41:07] the word or still being stuck in the
[41:10] wilderness
[41:11] tonight I just want to read one
[41:13] scripture out of Ephesians chapter 1.
[41:16] verse 1.
[41:19] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[41:23] by the will of God
[41:25] to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[41:29] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[41:33] I believe he's speaking to you and I
[41:34] tonight let's just bow in prayer one
[41:37] more time
[41:38] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[41:40] your word
[41:42] we know that it's the only thing that
[41:44] we'll endure father
[41:47] we just pray that you would take this
[41:49] word that we've spoken now father just
[41:52] one scripture and that you would just
[41:53] break it open father
[41:55] Lord that it would just bless our our
[41:58] hearts father and our minds and our
[42:00] souls Lord that it would just allow us
[42:02] to move one step closer to you we just
[42:05] ask all these things now in Jesus
[42:08] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[42:11] tonight you may be seated
[42:14] I just think it's such a beautiful
[42:16] beautiful thought this this one verse
[42:21] by the will of God
[42:23] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[42:27] I don't want to take it out of context
[42:28] but I do believe there's a couple of
[42:30] points in there that speak directly to
[42:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:35] speak directly to the Believers in this
[42:37] age
[42:39] I just wanted to have a couple of
[42:40] announcements we have delayed a little
[42:43] while and we're going to move forward
[42:45] with the vote for the church offices and
[42:48] we'll do that the week of the 21st to
[42:50] the 27th
[42:52] and I say it that way because we'll do
[42:54] it through the SurveyMonkey app once
[42:57] again and it will give everyone a chance
[42:59] to vote over the period of a few days
[43:02] the results will be announced on the
[43:04] 28th
[43:06] and just a recap on the requirements
[43:09] we want to remember that uh
[43:12] according to the bylaws for calorie
[43:14] Living Word you need to be over 18 years
[43:16] of age you need to be in regular
[43:17] attendance of the assembly and you need
[43:20] to be tithe pain
[43:22] so if you meet those requirements then
[43:24] you are eligible to vote and both
[43:27] husbands and wives are eligible to vote
[43:29] according to the bylaws so we certainly
[43:32] want to encourage you to take advantage
[43:35] of your right according to the bylaws
[43:39] um we have a gym night coming up this
[43:40] Friday on the 12th we have
[43:42] a ladies brunch on Saturday the 13th
[43:45] it's hard to believe that it's almost
[43:47] already the middle of May
[43:51] pretty soon we'll be in October
[43:53] and looking at snow again
[43:56] goes so fast and it seems to just get
[43:59] faster and faster
[44:00] it's amazing but we'll enjoy the
[44:02] summertime while we have it we're
[44:04] supposed to have a little bit of a heat
[44:05] wave this week in into next so that'll
[44:07] be nice
[44:08] certainly enjoying the birds being
[44:10] around and just to see the Life coming
[44:13] back to the area green grass
[44:15] thunderstorms rain the the smell of rain
[44:19] such a beautiful time
[44:21] are you happy tonight
[44:23] I just want to speak about the
[44:25] believer's position in Christ and uh
[44:30] it's actually a message that brother
[44:32] Branham
[44:33] preached and such a beautiful message
[44:36] the position the believer's position in
[44:39] Christ
[44:40] is really one I want to talk about
[44:42] tonight and we know that that that
[44:44] position in Christ is only through the
[44:47] baptism of the Holy Spirit but you know
[44:49] there was a quote on Sunday that I read
[44:51] I just I just wanted to pick that up but
[44:53] I'm gonna maybe just continue to repeat
[44:55] it I think it's so important to
[44:57] recognize
[44:59] and uh I apologize if it starts to
[45:01] become repetitive I certainly don't want
[45:03] it to be that way but I think there's
[45:05] some points that are really important
[45:07] and uh shouldn't be overlooked and you
[45:10] know we don't want to go back to
[45:11] Pentecost we don't want to go back to
[45:13] another day we want to we want to go
[45:15] forwards into the day that we're called
[45:17] to live in and we know that where we are
[45:20] is actually right back to Pentecost and
[45:23] we're not talking about a denomination
[45:24] of Pentecost we're not going back to
[45:26] Azusa Street we're not looking for many
[45:27] signs and wonders what we are looking
[45:29] for is a full manifestation of the word
[45:31] of God in our lives being able to say be
[45:34] it unto me according to Thy word and and
[45:37] not according to what somebody else
[45:39] thinks should happen and and I think
[45:41] that can be a real trap for the believer
[45:43] to think that I should behave a certain
[45:45] way I should do things a specific manner
[45:48] because as soon as you start to do that
[45:50] you know what's going to happen is
[45:51] you're going to actually put God in a
[45:53] box and say this is actually the only
[45:55] parameters that you have to function in
[45:57] my life and it's not going to go any
[46:00] farther the beautiful part is when we
[46:02] are truly Sons and Daughters of God he
[46:05] will smash those walls he will destroy
[46:07] that box that we have create created or
[46:10] performed in our own lives
[46:12] but you know his will is his word
[46:15] talking about that quote I brought out
[46:16] on Sunday I just wanted to read this out
[46:19] of the choosing of a bride you don't
[46:20] have to bring it up for time's sake but
[46:22] you know there's two types of people in
[46:24] this world and uh I've said that many
[46:27] times when we were in business there's
[46:28] two types of people in this world those
[46:30] that get it and those that don't but I'm
[46:32] not talking that way tonight I'm
[46:33] speaking about the classifications of
[46:35] people that the prophet brought out and
[46:38] you know the word of God is really the
[46:39] one that brought it out the the clearest
[46:41] but paragraph 170 out of the choosing of
[46:44] a bride the brother Branham is talking
[46:46] about those two classes of people and
[46:48] one of them is pregnated by their
[46:49] denominations right we spoke about this
[46:51] on Sunday they're willing to say you
[46:53] know I'm going to do what the pastor
[46:54] says I'm going to do what the church
[46:56] says I'm going to accept whatever the
[46:58] traditional teaching of my religion is
[47:00] and that's as far as it goes or maybe
[47:02] they'll say I'm going to accept a new
[47:04] religion maybe you're a Catholic and and
[47:06] we're going to go and be a an Anglican
[47:08] because the Catholics are doing
[47:10] something funny that I just can't agree
[47:12] with so now the anglicans are actually a
[47:14] little closer in the direction of the
[47:15] word but we're still going and accepting
[47:18] some sort of a book of denominational
[47:20] beliefs we're accepting a way of living
[47:23] and you know we have said it before in
[47:25] the past two people could say well
[47:27] you're just following a man too right
[47:28] we're just following the teachings of
[47:30] William Mary and Branham but yes we are
[47:32] following the teachings of William Mary
[47:34] and Branham which is the teachings of
[47:36] Paul the Apostle this one that actually
[47:38] wrote this this scripture here he wasn't
[47:40] the author he was the Scribe he was the
[47:43] one inspired to actually put this pen to
[47:45] paper but that's what we believe we're
[47:47] not reading a formal document every
[47:49] single one of the assemblies that that
[47:51] we would call message churches are
[47:54] sovereign there are some people out
[47:56] there though that want to be the bishop
[47:58] and you know we're not going to get into
[47:59] that tonight
[48:01] it's it's funny how it works but brother
[48:04] Bradham said it you know what that
[48:05] Antichrist Spirit would creep into the
[48:06] church and cause it to be lukewarm
[48:08] formal and Powerless and I want to say
[48:11] those are three identification those are
[48:13] three markers that we should really
[48:15] think about are we lukewarm
[48:18] are we formal because if we're going to
[48:21] be either one of those we're going to be
[48:22] powerless brothers and sisters that's
[48:24] what's going to happen in our lives and
[48:26] who wants to be powerless as a believer
[48:28] of this word my goodness his will is his
[48:30] word paragraph 170 out of this message
[48:32] the other is pregnated by the word of
[48:35] God and will bring forth the body this
[48:37] is the one that we want to talk about
[48:38] tonight the the Bride of Jesus Christ
[48:40] the one that says Amen to the word just
[48:42] like Mary said to the angel messenger
[48:44] when he came to her and gave her the
[48:46] message the other is pregnant by the
[48:48] word of God and will bring forth the
[48:49] body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[48:53] which is the bride
[48:56] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[48:58] how many knows that
[49:01] I think that's so incredible to think
[49:03] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[49:05] brothers and sisters we're still here
[49:07] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[49:09] isn't that beautiful there's still room
[49:12] there's still time but not much
[49:16] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[49:18] how many knows that a man and a woman is
[49:20] one and Christ is one body
[49:23] the word
[49:25] the bride will have to be the rest of
[49:27] that body
[49:28] and the two together
[49:31] makes the one body again
[49:35] like Adam was at the beginning man his
[49:38] wife are one now she the true bride
[49:42] so sold out to him
[49:44] that she used no mind of her own his
[49:47] mind of course is his will
[49:50] and his will is his word
[49:52] it just I'll probably continually read
[49:55] this so bear with me
[49:56] um it's just I think it's it sums it up
[49:59] right there that's the day in which we
[50:02] live in that's the promise we're looking
[50:03] for is the bride coming of the Lord the
[50:07] bride becoming one when that mind that
[50:09] was in Christ Jesus goes in in her when
[50:12] that's all we think about brothers and
[50:13] sisters of course we're going to be
[50:15] living in this world and paying bills
[50:16] and doing our jobs but what do we think
[50:18] about in between those moments when
[50:20] we're performing our functions you know
[50:22] for those people who have ever been in
[50:23] love and had a relationship what happens
[50:26] when you fall in love with someone
[50:29] every waking moment is spent Desiring to
[50:34] think about that person and and really
[50:36] what I would say this is how I would
[50:38] classify it is when it's truly love you
[50:40] can't help it
[50:41] you just can't help it something just
[50:44] continually drives your mind towards the
[50:47] thoughts of that person you're
[50:48] continually thinking about that person
[50:50] you want to get to know that person
[50:52] better you want to see that person you
[50:55] want to talk to that person I want to
[50:57] encourage every one of us brothers and
[50:58] sisters to have that kind of an
[51:00] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:02] where we think about him that way as a
[51:05] bride would think about her husband
[51:06] because when we do brothers and sisters
[51:08] that's when this this mind that was in
[51:10] Christ will be enough because our
[51:12] thoughts will no longer be our thoughts
[51:14] we will change our thinking those
[51:16] thoughts that come into our mind when
[51:18] they're not the thoughts of the word
[51:20] when they're not the thoughts of God
[51:21] when they're Satan's thoughts we're just
[51:23] going to dismiss them they're just not
[51:24] even going to have anywhere to go and I
[51:26] believe that's the place that brother
[51:27] Bradham said will come to one of these
[51:29] days where we'll be so far into Christ
[51:31] that Satan won't even be able to find us
[51:33] we'll be so far in there he won't even
[51:35] be able to find us he'll have a hedge
[51:37] all the way around us just like job had
[51:39] or another one brother Bradham says is
[51:41] that there is going to come at time
[51:44] where Satan just won't even want to deal
[51:46] with us Satan just won't even want to
[51:48] deal with us he'll be like oh no I'll go
[51:50] and I'll go and deal with anyone else in
[51:52] this world we'll go after some of those
[51:53] unwise virgins because we know they
[51:55] don't have that protection of the oil
[51:57] but those wise virgins man we can't get
[51:59] through to them they're full of oil and
[52:01] we can't we can't deceive them but you
[52:04] know one of these types of people has
[52:06] the old nature one of these types of
[52:09] people has the old nature and will
[52:11] always say you know what I'm good I'm
[52:13] good yeah I'm good man I know I had my
[52:15] experience back there and everything is
[52:17] fine in my life and I'm good it's fine I
[52:20] believe everything is fine it's not a
[52:23] problem I know it all
[52:25] and the other one is going to say you
[52:27] know what be it unto me Lord according
[52:29] to your word I need a new Revival in my
[52:32] life every single day that I open my
[52:34] eyes and that I have breath in my lungs
[52:36] that's what I want to do is think about
[52:38] you I want to fall in love with you more
[52:40] and more every single day I don't want
[52:42] to say that I'm good I know that I'm not
[52:44] good I know that everything inside of me
[52:46] is a scoundrel in this flesh but boy oh
[52:50] boy if you can live out through me then
[52:52] I know there's something good going to
[52:54] happen and I just want to say tonight
[52:55] that's the difference between those two
[52:57] Believers because they're both Believers
[52:59] brother Bradham says one is an unwise
[53:01] virgin and the other one is a wise
[53:03] virgin the unwise Virgin has not enough
[53:06] oil she's got a bit of oil but she
[53:08] doesn't have enough oil
[53:09] and she wants to get some from the wise
[53:11] virgin
[53:13] we know the wise virgin says you know
[53:15] what no
[53:16] I don't think there's going to be enough
[53:17] for both of us I just have enough for me
[53:19] you got to go get your own go buy your
[53:21] own that's what he she tells her and
[53:23] when she goes to buy it that's when the
[53:25] door is closed right that's when it's
[53:27] over that's when it changes and we know
[53:29] that changes right here at the door
[53:33] brother Branham says that she goes out
[53:35] to get it but it doesn't say in the word
[53:37] that she gets it
[53:39] she goes out to get it
[53:42] there's a few of these people in this
[53:43] world brother Brown talks about it in
[53:46] the in the exposition of the seven
[53:47] Church ages I think it's such a powerful
[53:49] passage and I can't even really do it
[53:52] justice in the few minutes we have but
[53:53] I'm just going to try and draw our
[53:55] attention to it out of the seven Church
[53:57] ages the start of seeing Church age
[53:59] brother Bradham says all these people
[54:00] had their names in The Book of Life and
[54:02] their names remained that's the Bride of
[54:05] Jesus Christ their names were written in
[54:07] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[54:10] foundation of the world
[54:12] their names remained but whose names did
[54:15] not remain
[54:16] those of the world system churches who
[54:18] fought the bride will be those whose
[54:21] names are removed
[54:23] that's why I think it's so important I
[54:25] know we all know this we have a real
[54:27] tremendous opportunity in our lives to
[54:31] encourage people to the word or
[54:32] discourage people to the word depending
[54:34] on the life that we live before them
[54:37] the bride will be those whose names ah
[54:40] sorry but those who fought the bride
[54:42] will be those whose names are removed
[54:45] and that is who will lose out
[54:49] it's a tough statement he says they will
[54:50] be cast into the Lake of Fire
[54:54] now let us go another step but before we
[54:56] do let us review our case thus far
[54:58] first of all we know most assuredly
[55:01] but the purpose of God stands in
[55:03] election
[55:05] it was purposed in himself it was God's
[55:07] purpose to bring forth a people like
[55:09] unto himself that would be a word bride
[55:15] a word bride talking about our scripture
[55:18] tonight by the will of God
[55:20] to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[55:24] a word bride
[55:28] it was purposed in himself it was God's
[55:31] purpose to bring forth a people like
[55:33] unto himself that would be a word bride
[55:37] she was chosen before the foundation of
[55:40] the world in him
[55:43] all right
[55:45] I just think it's such a wonderful thing
[55:48] if we can
[55:50] realize this brothers and sisters
[55:52] doesn't matter what Satan does to us
[55:54] does it
[55:55] doesn't matter what happens to us we've
[55:57] got every reason to jump up and down and
[55:59] scream and shout because you won greater
[56:01] than the Powerball lottery you you've
[56:03] won the greatest thing that you could
[56:05] ever get if you look at the the the
[56:07] monarchy and how they were crowned I
[56:09] took a look uh the other day at the the
[56:12] crown jewels before they actually did
[56:14] the coronation for the monarchy there
[56:16] anybody know how much that Crown was
[56:18] worth
[56:19] the crown just the crown I thought it
[56:22] would be millions of dollars and I was
[56:24] like man that's a fancy crown that that
[56:26] Crown they're gonna use it was the one
[56:28] that was on display inside the Tower of
[56:30] London I think they adjusted it changed
[56:31] it or something for the coronation I
[56:33] could be wrong but that Crown the way it
[56:35] sat there was over three billion dollars
[56:38] in value
[56:40] but to think it's nothing compared to
[56:43] the crown which you've been given
[56:46] nothing compared to the crown which we
[56:48] have been entitled to
[56:49] if we talk about an entitlement
[56:52] environment an entitlement anointing
[56:55] there's a purpose for it because the
[56:57] bride is entitled to that position to
[57:00] sit with him in his throne not to stand
[57:02] before that throne in judgment
[57:04] why she was chosen before the foundation
[57:07] of the world in him
[57:10] she was four known and beloved before
[57:13] she was ever brought forth during the
[57:15] ages upon the Earth
[57:18] we can see Jesus in there in that
[57:20] scripture can't we
[57:22] boy Satan sure likes to try and make it
[57:24] cloudy for us to see us in there hey
[57:27] he likes to try and muddy those Waters
[57:29] and make it look real blurry and give us
[57:31] as much spiritual Amnesia as we can
[57:33] possibly get but you know that's why we
[57:35] come to church so we can actually start
[57:37] to play those songs that start to
[57:40] stimulate the soul and the believer to
[57:42] go back to the before the before to
[57:44] remember what it was like to be in him
[57:47] she was foreknown and beloved before she
[57:50] was ever brought forth during the ages
[57:52] upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his
[57:55] blood and
[57:57] can never come into condemnation
[58:04] if we could just believe that if I could
[58:05] just believe that if I could just walk
[58:07] out of this building tonight and think I
[58:09] could just never come into condemnation
[58:11] I say Lord help me to realize that help
[58:13] me recognize that I could never come
[58:15] into condemnation it doesn't matter what
[58:17] the devil does it doesn't matter what
[58:19] this flesh does doesn't matter how he
[58:21] tries to use this flesh against me God
[58:23] only sees me the way he created me he
[58:25] only sees you the way he created you
[58:27] with that crown that you have
[58:32] she can never be in the judgment
[58:35] because sin cannot be imputed unto her
[58:38] my that's you
[58:40] Romans 4 8 lest is the man to whom the
[58:43] Lord will not impute sin but indeed she
[58:46] shall be with him in his throne of
[58:49] judgment judging the world and even
[58:51] angels
[58:53] why even
[58:55] oh he he says her name
[58:58] and in Brackets it says each of her
[59:01] members and while I was studying this I
[59:03] thought you know it'd be just real nice
[59:04] to just start listing off every single
[59:07] person's name but for time's sake I
[59:08] won't do that just just maybe think of
[59:11] this brothers and sisters her name put
[59:13] your name in there was written in a
[59:16] section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:18] before the foundation of the world
[59:22] your name was positionally placed there
[59:27] secondly there is another class their
[59:29] names are also in the book of life and
[59:31] they will come up in the second
[59:32] Resurrection
[59:35] I've talked to people who have said you
[59:37] know there that'll happen we'll come up
[59:39] with a second Resurrection but I think
[59:41] the word of God says it would be
[59:42] probably better for you to not have
[59:44] known and actually rejected the word of
[59:46] God for your day than to actually just
[59:49] I find yourself in that position
[59:53] brother Bradham says their names are
[59:55] also in the book of life and they will
[59:56] come up in the second Resurrection such
[59:58] are the foolish virgins and the
[1:00:00] righteous as are spoken of in Matthew
[1:00:02] 25.
[1:00:04] it's it's it's just a staggering thing
[1:00:07] to think about that that we can never
[1:00:09] come into the condemnation and that's
[1:00:11] really one thing I just want to point
[1:00:12] out tonight I want to really hammer on
[1:00:14] that it doesn't matter what Satan does
[1:00:16] to us brothers and sisters it doesn't
[1:00:17] matter how hard we fall down it doesn't
[1:00:19] matter how much we hurt it doesn't
[1:00:21] matter how much we hurt others and
[1:00:23] people I know will be saying Oh Brother
[1:00:24] Barry that's real easy for you to say
[1:00:26] but you know what what did Christ do for
[1:00:28] us at Calvary how much was he hurt what
[1:00:31] did he endure what did he go through and
[1:00:33] that was for every single one of us so
[1:00:35] that we could be written in the Lamb's
[1:00:36] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:00:38] the world so that sin could not even be
[1:00:40] imputed against us
[1:00:42] so that the accuser of the Brethren one
[1:00:44] day he'll just be cast down brothers and
[1:00:46] sisters and when he's cast down then the
[1:00:48] bride goes up and you know there's three
[1:00:50] and a half years of Terror on Earth and
[1:00:53] we will not be here not that we don't
[1:00:54] want to be here we won't be here
[1:00:57] for one bomb Falls the bride will be
[1:00:59] gone don't worry
[1:01:01] don't worry I just wanted to encourage
[1:01:04] you tonight as the the last sentence in
[1:01:07] this first chapter the first verse of
[1:01:11] the first chapter Paul an apostle of
[1:01:13] Jesus Christ by the will of God
[1:01:17] to the Saints which are Ephesus he's
[1:01:19] addressing it to a very specific
[1:01:22] people a very specific Church the Saints
[1:01:24] which are Ephesus
[1:01:26] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus and
[1:01:29] everyone else who believes in Christ
[1:01:31] Jesus and to think about what it means
[1:01:34] to be faithful we know that we talked
[1:01:35] about a little while ago there's coming
[1:01:37] an ending of our faith and that's what
[1:01:39] it has to be and when that happens it's
[1:01:41] no longer our faith it's the Lord Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ Living out his life his faith and
[1:01:46] his faith will always just say it
[1:01:48] doesn't matter what Satan says God's
[1:01:50] word says doesn't matter what Satan's
[1:01:51] word says God's word says it will always
[1:01:53] take us back just like Jesus did in the
[1:01:57] wilderness when Satan came around and
[1:01:58] tempted him with those three Giants and
[1:02:00] we know that he cast him down every
[1:02:02] single time all three of those
[1:02:04] Temptations He didn't say no get behind
[1:02:06] me I could call 12 000 Legions of angels
[1:02:09] and just destroy you he didn't do that
[1:02:11] he just simply said just get behind me
[1:02:13] Satan you know what's also written you
[1:02:15] don't have any power over me you're an
[1:02:17] offense to me just get lost
[1:02:19] and that's what we need to do
[1:02:22] as Believers we have the ability to do
[1:02:24] that the faithful tonight out of uh the
[1:02:27] believer's position in Christ paragraph
[1:02:30] 21 to the faithful in Jesus Christ now
[1:02:35] this letter is addressed to those
[1:02:37] not to the outside world
[1:02:40] not to it's it's not a sermon Paul
[1:02:43] wasn't preaching here to the unsaved
[1:02:46] he was preaching to the saved
[1:02:50] excuse me they're called out the
[1:02:53] separated the set aside
[1:02:55] and the faithful in the call
[1:02:59] and tonight I just want to encourage
[1:03:01] every single one of you
[1:03:02] every single one of you
[1:03:04] if you're watching this on the screen if
[1:03:07] you're here in person
[1:03:09] you're that faithful that he's talking
[1:03:11] about
[1:03:12] you're that faithful that he's talking
[1:03:14] to
[1:03:15] and and you know just starting here and
[1:03:18] anchoring it here it's by the will of
[1:03:20] God brother brought him in this message
[1:03:22] he talks about the apostle
[1:03:26] and he says very clearly in this message
[1:03:28] missionaries are Apostles
[1:03:32] it brings it up to a current
[1:03:35] day a current word that we're more
[1:03:37] familiar with Paul a missionary
[1:03:41] by the will of God there's many
[1:03:43] missionaries In This World by the will
[1:03:45] of God and and I know for sure there's
[1:03:48] people in denominations who are
[1:03:51] missionaries by the will of God now you
[1:03:54] might say brother Barry that's a strong
[1:03:56] statement but you know brother Branham
[1:03:57] says there's Believers in every
[1:03:58] denomination
[1:04:00] not just in in Calgary Living Word not
[1:04:03] just in another message Church there's
[1:04:05] people who follow the will of the Lord
[1:04:07] in fact I would say the entire world
[1:04:09] does if they're a virgin one or the
[1:04:12] other they're following the will of the
[1:04:14] Lord and every other person in this
[1:04:15] world is doing what the Lord wants for
[1:04:18] those groups of people
[1:04:20] whether they believe it or not
[1:04:22] nothing happens in this world without it
[1:04:24] being the will of God but here we have
[1:04:25] Paul actually talking to a called out
[1:04:30] people the separated people the set
[1:04:32] aside and the faithful in the call and
[1:04:36] we know that we have to have ears to
[1:04:37] hear what that call is but boy when we
[1:04:40] can start looking at the book of
[1:04:42] Ephesians and and seeing it from the
[1:04:45] believer's position the believer's
[1:04:47] position in Christ
[1:04:50] and how do we get into Christ we know
[1:04:52] there's only one way to get into Christ
[1:04:53] but that's by being baptized into one
[1:04:57] body brother Branham he says the
[1:04:58] believer's position he goes on to say
[1:05:01] now that's who he's addressed it to in
[1:05:04] Jesus the believer's position is in
[1:05:08] Christ and Christ will only meet the
[1:05:11] believer the believer can only worship
[1:05:14] Christ
[1:05:15] as he is positionally placed in Christ
[1:05:20] and we know there's only one way to be
[1:05:22] positionally placed in Christ
[1:05:25] and that's through the baptism of the
[1:05:26] Holy Ghost
[1:05:27] but the brown goes on to say I don't
[1:05:28] believe you get it let me go another
[1:05:30] route look a Believer cannot worship and
[1:05:33] has no right to worship no man has no
[1:05:37] right to Worship the Lord outside of
[1:05:39] being in the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:42] Christ did you know that
[1:05:44] if we had time to go back and pick up
[1:05:47] the laws on that it would be beautifully
[1:05:50] he who is addressing it to the believer
[1:05:54] in Christ
[1:05:56] faithful in Jesus Christ
[1:05:59] isn't a wonderful thing to think that
[1:06:02] you are faithful in Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] and the only reason that you're faithful
[1:06:07] in Jesus Christ is because he's given us
[1:06:09] the ability to be the faithful in Jesus
[1:06:12] Christ not because we decided one day I
[1:06:14] just want to be faithful in Jesus Christ
[1:06:16] I do believe as a Believer we can say I
[1:06:19] want to be more faithful in Jesus Christ
[1:06:22] but you know when when you're in Jesus
[1:06:24] Christ you're in Jesus Christ you're not
[1:06:27] just part way into Jesus Christ brother
[1:06:30] Bradham says that you're not a a white
[1:06:32] Blackbird you're not actually mostly
[1:06:35] saved but kind of not you're either
[1:06:37] saved or you're not and if you are saved
[1:06:39] you are sealed until the day of your
[1:06:42] Redemption you're not you're not given
[1:06:44] the new birth without getting the Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost brothers and sisters there's a
[1:06:48] misconception I think that brother
[1:06:50] Branham he talks about it both ways but
[1:06:52] I just I just side with that way that
[1:06:55] you cannot be saved and not have the
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost because if you don't have the
[1:06:59] Holy Ghost you're not going to go on the
[1:07:01] rapture
[1:07:01] so how can you be saved
[1:07:03] how could that possibly be you have to
[1:07:06] but boy when you've got it you've got it
[1:07:08] and that's one of the biggest tricks of
[1:07:10] the devil that's the one he uses the
[1:07:11] most is to say to people you don't got
[1:07:13] it no you don't you don't have it you
[1:07:16] never did have it you wouldn't have done
[1:07:17] that you wouldn't have thought that you
[1:07:18] wouldn't have gone there you wouldn't
[1:07:19] have said that you wouldn't have you
[1:07:21] wouldn't have you wouldn't have or you
[1:07:22] should have you should have you should
[1:07:23] have any single ammunition that he can
[1:07:25] any fiery Dart from from the enemy he'll
[1:07:28] throw at you
[1:07:29] but you know it doesn't matter because
[1:07:31] that's not the evidence
[1:07:34] if only evidence is our ability to
[1:07:35] receive the word and and that proves
[1:07:37] that we are the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:07:39] in Jesus Christ
[1:07:42] but the other thing that he does is
[1:07:43] he'll he'll take people and say oh yeah
[1:07:45] you've got you've got brother yeah
[1:07:49] yeah it's your dress fine everything's
[1:07:51] fine you got it but then you'll have
[1:07:54] something funky something in in your
[1:07:57] walk with the Lord that just doesn't
[1:07:58] jive with the message of the hour and
[1:08:00] we'll go back to what we talked about
[1:08:02] before where there will be some time
[1:08:04] that someone will bring some kind of
[1:08:06] Correction and you'll say no no no no no
[1:08:07] I've got it I'm fine I'm good I don't
[1:08:09] need any more from it I I learned it
[1:08:12] long ago I know all about the message of
[1:08:14] the hour I've got it you know leave me
[1:08:15] alone I believe the way I believe when
[1:08:17] that happens brothers and sisters I
[1:08:19] would say that is a clear identification
[1:08:21] that there's something wrong with that
[1:08:23] experience and Satan will do that to us
[1:08:26] just to keep us off our our our Center
[1:08:29] Line in the road
[1:08:31] but you know if we are saved if we truly
[1:08:34] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost if we
[1:08:36] do hear the word of God our our spirit
[1:08:39] will step aside and his spirit will rise
[1:08:42] up inside of us and say Amen to that
[1:08:44] word sometimes it might be hard for our
[1:08:47] flesh to step aside but it always will
[1:08:49] yield to the Holy Ghost if we have the
[1:08:53] Holy Ghost
[1:08:54] and when that happens then we know that
[1:08:56] we're children but when it doesn't
[1:08:58] happen the word of God says that we
[1:09:00] don't have a father
[1:09:02] and we don't want to be those people
[1:09:05] but you know the position the believer's
[1:09:07] position in Christ by the will of God
[1:09:09] when people says there's no more
[1:09:11] Apostles and that same church send
[1:09:13] missionaries and say there's no Apostles
[1:09:15] I I don't get it but the Apostle is one
[1:09:18] that sent so is the missionary is one
[1:09:21] that is sent by God and Paul by no
[1:09:24] desire of by choice not not by the will
[1:09:27] of man not by humanly desires but by the
[1:09:30] will of God he was an apostle
[1:09:32] he says we need some more like that
[1:09:35] I think that's a beautiful statement we
[1:09:38] need some more like that and you know to
[1:09:40] think about it I believe it's in this
[1:09:41] message he talks about it Paul was sent
[1:09:44] to the people
[1:09:46] to preach to them that he was
[1:09:48] persecuting he was laying that church to
[1:09:50] waste
[1:09:51] could you imagine being the church if we
[1:09:54] had a an apostle wanting to come to
[1:09:56] Calgary Living Word I would probably
[1:09:58] want to physically fight him and say no
[1:10:00] you're not coming here I'm not going to
[1:10:02] let you get behind the pulpit I'm not
[1:10:04] going to let you get anywhere near the
[1:10:05] people that that we look after here
[1:10:07] spiritually no way know how
[1:10:11] but then I would have to yield to the
[1:10:13] Holy Spirit wouldn't I but could you
[1:10:15] imagine what it would feel like for
[1:10:16] those people to think that this is the
[1:10:18] guy
[1:10:19] God sent now and what it would be like
[1:10:22] for him
[1:10:23] are you serious now I gotta go talk to
[1:10:25] the people that I was killing that I was
[1:10:27] throwing in prison and everything else
[1:10:29] but that's by the will of God
[1:10:33] I love how brother Branham says it a
[1:10:34] little later in this message sometimes
[1:10:35] God will take and make us do things that
[1:10:38] we thought we would never do
[1:10:41] we want to Never Say Never
[1:10:44] and Paul not by desire not by choice not
[1:10:46] by the will of man or his own humanly
[1:10:48] desires but by the will of God he was an
[1:10:49] apostle we need more like that by the
[1:10:51] will of God he was on his road to
[1:10:53] Damascus to arrest think of it was going
[1:10:56] to arrest the very group that he was
[1:10:58] sent to be an apostle of now you you see
[1:11:02] how upside down it looks like inhuman
[1:11:05] element
[1:11:06] that God does things
[1:11:08] just the very things you don't think
[1:11:11] that you wouldn't do that may be the
[1:11:13] very things you have to do
[1:11:15] that might be exactly what we have to do
[1:11:19] I just love it brother Bonham he talks
[1:11:21] about this I believe it's in this
[1:11:23] message bear with me
[1:11:26] no it's in the breach
[1:11:30] the real Holy Ghost I like how he he
[1:11:32] says this in here this this truly is the
[1:11:34] real Holy Ghost the bottom says a woman
[1:11:36] just called up another woman said you
[1:11:39] know I'm an Episcopalian he said I spoke
[1:11:41] in tongues the other day I believe I
[1:11:43] received the Holy Ghost but shh don't
[1:11:46] tell nobody
[1:11:49] brother Bradham says I doubt that very
[1:11:51] much
[1:11:52] you might have spoken with tongues
[1:11:55] but you set a Man on Fire how's he going
[1:11:57] to set still that's right see can't do
[1:12:00] it
[1:12:02] he says could you imagine Peter and
[1:12:04] James and John and them in the upper
[1:12:07] room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost now
[1:12:10] but maybe we better just keep still
[1:12:14] can you imagine that
[1:12:16] we better just be still we better be
[1:12:18] quiet he goes on to say brother through
[1:12:20] Windows Doors and everything they went
[1:12:23] out into the street acting like a bunch
[1:12:25] of drunks
[1:12:27] he says that's the real Holy Ghost
[1:12:31] I want to say tonight don't be afraid
[1:12:35] don't be worried
[1:12:37] just give God the Liberty to move
[1:12:40] let him move
[1:12:42] if he says stand stand
[1:12:45] we've witnessed it here a woman stand up
[1:12:47] and receive healing from breast cancer
[1:12:49] sister Shelley shared the testimony with
[1:12:51] me if anybody is interested and I can
[1:12:53] share it with you
[1:12:55] um it's tremendous
[1:12:57] but God's A Healer
[1:12:58] and he's a deliverer and you know
[1:13:01] sometimes our healing and our
[1:13:03] deliverance isn't necessarily in a
[1:13:05] Physical Realm
[1:13:07] it'll affect us in a Physical Realm if
[1:13:10] we leave it too long but sometimes we
[1:13:12] have a mental illness
[1:13:14] and I've heard this talked about and
[1:13:16] some people might say yeah I've heard it
[1:13:17] too now you're going down a different
[1:13:19] road but I don't know why I feel led to
[1:13:21] go this way I just know enough to do it
[1:13:23] when the time comes sometimes we suffer
[1:13:26] in our minds and that's a very real
[1:13:29] thing brothers and sisters many people
[1:13:31] would say well you get the Holy Ghost it
[1:13:33] just settles everything you don't have
[1:13:34] to worry about it it's true
[1:13:37] brother Bradham says you can actually
[1:13:38] lose your mind and have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:40] and still go to heaven so it goes to
[1:13:42] show that you still deal with a mental
[1:13:44] illness right it's something that can
[1:13:46] affect us and sometimes there's
[1:13:48] different things that can cause it
[1:13:49] sometimes they're Simple Solutions to
[1:13:52] fix it and God if we ask him many times
[1:13:55] I believe he will show us what the
[1:13:57] answer is we can be delivered from
[1:13:59] things that we maybe didn't even realize
[1:14:01] were a problem in our lives
[1:14:04] but we just need to trust them
[1:14:06] Satan's going to come and use any tactic
[1:14:08] he can
[1:14:09] go brother Batman goes on to say but you
[1:14:11] see that sleeping virgin ain't receiving
[1:14:13] nothing
[1:14:14] anyhow uh-huh that's right and remember
[1:14:17] while they went to try to buy oil
[1:14:19] remember the scriptures doesn't say they
[1:14:21] got it that's in the breach just before
[1:14:24] he preached the seals
[1:14:26] tonight
[1:14:27] this message here tonight is to the
[1:14:30] faithful
[1:14:31] in Christ Jesus
[1:14:34] this believer's position in Christ
[1:14:37] if you you just go on and read just a
[1:14:40] little tiny bit in the book of Ephesians
[1:14:43] and and we can just put our names in
[1:14:45] there
[1:14:47] when we hear the word us and you
[1:14:50] and them it's just
[1:14:53] amazing to think
[1:14:55] Satan is already defeated
[1:14:57] Satan wanted to be number one in the
[1:15:00] Kingdom
[1:15:01] and you know what's happened is Satan
[1:15:03] he's never going to have a position in
[1:15:06] the Kingdom he's going to be the one
[1:15:07] that's on the sides of the pit that
[1:15:10] everyone is going to walk by and
[1:15:12] narrowly look upon and say you're the
[1:15:14] one that troubled all the nations that
[1:15:16] was you
[1:15:17] are you serious right now
[1:15:19] we're going to be looking on him and
[1:15:21] thinking wow
[1:15:23] that's the guy every single heartache
[1:15:26] every single frustration every bit of
[1:15:28] anger every bit of confusion every bit
[1:15:30] of hurt and fear in my life is because
[1:15:33] of you
[1:15:36] well I think I'll just go and actually
[1:15:38] now that I've looked for today I'll just
[1:15:39] go and set right back down in in that
[1:15:42] Throne of judgment that you always
[1:15:45] wanted to sit in when you said that you
[1:15:47] wanted to be like the most high and and
[1:15:50] sit above the clouds in the congregation
[1:15:53] of the north the sides of the north it
[1:15:56] will be like that brothers and sisters
[1:15:58] he wants the position that you have and
[1:16:01] he knows that he will never get it but
[1:16:03] you already have it
[1:16:05] he gave it to you before the foundation
[1:16:07] of the world he gave it to you before he
[1:16:09] even created Satan
[1:16:12] and Satan knows it
[1:16:14] that's why he Badgers us so much
[1:16:17] but he's got no power
[1:16:18] he's powerless
[1:16:20] he's roaming about as a roaring lion to
[1:16:23] see who he may devour but he's got no
[1:16:26] teeth
[1:16:28] he's got no teeth
[1:16:31] with the Branham in the believer's
[1:16:33] position in Christ
[1:16:35] when I first seen the Full Gospel people
[1:16:37] and I seen a girl one night get up on
[1:16:39] the floor when the music was playing
[1:16:42] begin dancing up and down the floor
[1:16:45] I never danced in my life wasn't on a
[1:16:48] dance floor and didn't believe nothing
[1:16:50] in dancing
[1:16:51] imagine if somebody started dancing in
[1:16:53] here
[1:16:55] I saw someone dancing up in Edmonton
[1:16:58] and I know it caused a lot of uneasiness
[1:17:02] brother Branham goes on to say well
[1:17:04] selfishness here
[1:17:06] not out loud but in my heart I
[1:17:09] criticized the girl
[1:17:12] I said there's nothing about God about
[1:17:14] that
[1:17:17] here we have the prophet of God saying
[1:17:19] this there's nothing about God about
[1:17:22] that
[1:17:23] just a young Baptist preacher sitting
[1:17:25] there and I said there can't be nothing
[1:17:28] to that
[1:17:30] that woman out there on the floor
[1:17:32] she's only just making a show she just
[1:17:35] wants somebody to see her
[1:17:37] I was talking about a message Church in
[1:17:39] Edmonton that I saw that at by the way
[1:17:43] there can't be nothing to that that
[1:17:45] woman out there on the floor she's only
[1:17:47] just making a show
[1:17:49] she just wants somebody to see her
[1:17:51] I wouldn't say it out loud for nothing
[1:17:54] but in my heart I was thinking it and
[1:17:57] remember brother Branham says that your
[1:17:58] thoughts are louder in heaven than your
[1:18:00] words are here on Earth
[1:18:02] God's listening to our thoughts he knows
[1:18:05] exactly what we're thinking
[1:18:07] he goes on to say some of them said what
[1:18:09] did you think of that meeting
[1:18:12] I said it was fine but in my heart I
[1:18:14] didn't believe that something was still
[1:18:17] not settled with that woman that was up
[1:18:19] dancing around right brother random says
[1:18:22] so you know one New Year's night I was
[1:18:23] sitting in my own Tabernacle and they
[1:18:25] started playing this song there's going
[1:18:27] to be a meeting in the air
[1:18:30] and you know what happened I'd done the
[1:18:32] same thing
[1:18:34] so you see why
[1:18:36] so just the things that you say you
[1:18:38] won't do you may have to do it sometime
[1:18:42] and you know you don't have to dance
[1:18:43] brothers and sisters
[1:18:45] you don't have to scream and shout
[1:18:48] but if the spirit of God moves upon you
[1:18:50] there is nothing stopping you here
[1:18:53] you know the whole entire world gets
[1:18:55] excited about all of the different
[1:18:57] things that the whole entire world gets
[1:18:59] excited about we have full complete
[1:19:02] Liberty to get excited about the Lord
[1:19:04] putting us in this position in him
[1:19:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:08] recognizing that we have the position
[1:19:10] that only Satan desired to have and will
[1:19:12] never have
[1:19:14] he has chosen to make us faithful in
[1:19:19] Christ Jesus he chose you so that you
[1:19:22] could have the faith to be faithful in
[1:19:25] the word for your day
[1:19:28] I just think that's so rich you know the
[1:19:31] the first verse of chapter two and you
[1:19:33] hath he quickened who were dead in
[1:19:36] trespasses in sins
[1:19:38] sometimes people would say well I never
[1:19:40] sinned in the world I never went out in
[1:19:42] the world no you didn't but before you
[1:19:43] had the new birth you were born in sin
[1:19:46] you were shaped in iniquity and you came
[1:19:48] into this world speaking lies and if
[1:19:50] anybody has ever had a child or had to
[1:19:52] deal with children you know that you
[1:19:53] don't have to teach them to lie when
[1:19:55] they know that they're going to get a
[1:19:57] spanking for misbehaving
[1:19:59] they're gonna lie that's what children
[1:20:02] do and you know if we don't deal with
[1:20:04] that it's actually going to turn into a
[1:20:06] spirit that will manifest in our lives
[1:20:08] and we know later on in the Scripture it
[1:20:10] says the Liars will have no part in the
[1:20:13] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:20:15] they'll actually wind up in the Lake of
[1:20:17] Fire and that's why as parents we teach
[1:20:19] our children don't lie you have to tell
[1:20:23] the truth it's one of the most powerful
[1:20:25] things you can do as a person as an
[1:20:27] adult is just tell the truth
[1:20:29] if you tell the truth
[1:20:32] it'll always work out right
[1:20:36] but the faithful in Christ Jesus Here We
[1:20:38] Are Tonight
[1:20:40] imagine I I imagine if Paul was able to
[1:20:44] look through the the corridors of time
[1:20:47] and see groups of people like us sitting
[1:20:50] around talking about this scripture
[1:20:52] while he was actually scribing it under
[1:20:55] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost was he
[1:20:58] able to see the vision of the people in
[1:21:00] the ages to come because he spoke about
[1:21:02] the ages to come
[1:21:05] but brothers and sisters you're in
[1:21:07] Christ tonight you have every reason to
[1:21:09] Rejoice every reason to recognize that
[1:21:12] you will never ever fail you will never
[1:21:15] fall because sin can't even be imputed
[1:21:19] unto you
[1:21:22] brother Branham says in this message the
[1:21:24] believer's position in Christ God was in
[1:21:26] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:21:29] that was his Temple then that body for
[1:21:31] sin our sins
[1:21:34] was tore apart
[1:21:36] it's flesh ripped in two and blood
[1:21:39] vessels was broken
[1:21:42] and there now
[1:21:44] as the Spirit come from his body
[1:21:48] that all believers hope you see it look
[1:21:52] all believers that comes through the
[1:21:54] blood into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:59] worshiped God
[1:22:02] through the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] in line they are positionally placed in
[1:22:10] Christ
[1:22:11] you see it
[1:22:14] remember the first thing that Jesus did
[1:22:17] God did rather
[1:22:20] when Jesus
[1:22:22] bowed his head and gave up the ghost the
[1:22:24] very first thing he did he didn't go to
[1:22:26] heaven he went to the tradition
[1:22:29] he went right into the temple where the
[1:22:31] most holy people were and he tore that
[1:22:33] Veil from top to bottom and he said now
[1:22:35] that that holy of holies that place that
[1:22:38] was only reserved for the priest for the
[1:22:40] high priest once a year to come into and
[1:22:42] and if he didn't have his life right
[1:22:44] he'd be drug out by a rope that place
[1:22:47] now is wide open
[1:22:49] the tree of life the way to the tree of
[1:22:52] life is opened up wide open now
[1:22:55] he went right into the temple and tore
[1:22:57] that Veil top to bottom to demonstrate
[1:23:00] that that blood vessel was broken and it
[1:23:02] was truly finished that word that was in
[1:23:05] him from before the foundation of the
[1:23:07] world now was sealed with blood and
[1:23:10] brothers and sisters tonight I want to
[1:23:12] say it that you are that word you were
[1:23:15] in him before the foundation of the
[1:23:17] world I like thinking this way I don't
[1:23:18] know if brother Branham says it or if
[1:23:20] somebody else said it I can't help but
[1:23:21] think that the the names that were
[1:23:23] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:23:27] excuse me
[1:23:28] they were written in blood
[1:23:30] they were not just penned in pen it
[1:23:32] wasn't just red ink it wasn't just a
[1:23:34] fine ink that was supplied from
[1:23:36] somewhere like India it wasn't any of
[1:23:38] that It Was Written in Blood something
[1:23:40] that would never be able to be erased it
[1:23:42] was a permanent Mark and and nothing
[1:23:45] could touch it he goes on to say to them
[1:23:47] that are in Christ faithful called
[1:23:50] chosen in Christ that's who Paul's
[1:23:54] addressing in this letter to aren't you
[1:23:56] happy today you're in Christ
[1:23:59] those people who were called before the
[1:24:02] foundation of the world nothing they
[1:24:03] ever done nothing they could ever do
[1:24:05] they didn't even know who they were
[1:24:08] when they were born
[1:24:10] but they were born to be positionally
[1:24:12] placed in Christ I hope it's not too
[1:24:15] many quotes tonight I just uh just
[1:24:18] listened to this message I got so
[1:24:19] thrilled by it I always get inspired by
[1:24:21] the message and I just love it but you
[1:24:23] know brother Branham says it he says how
[1:24:25] do we get in it wish we had time for it
[1:24:27] for about six more minutes look how do
[1:24:29] we get into Christ by one Spirit not
[1:24:31] even one Fellowship no the first thing
[1:24:34] comes first by one Church no by one
[1:24:38] letter no by one Creed no my one spirit
[1:24:43] we are all baptized into one body and I
[1:24:46] love how he says this he goes even
[1:24:48] further brother Rory this is for you
[1:24:50] tonight he says not by water not by
[1:24:53] power not by might but by my spirit
[1:24:56] saith the Lord one Spirit we're all
[1:24:59] baptized into one body
[1:25:02] it's not something that we can do on the
[1:25:04] outward to make it happen it's an inward
[1:25:07] work it's an inside job it's when we say
[1:25:10] be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:25:12] that's when something will happen that's
[1:25:14] when we get baptized
[1:25:17] we know we got examples in the Bible
[1:25:19] where people receive the Holy Ghost
[1:25:20] before the water and the people went and
[1:25:22] got baptized afterwards as an outward
[1:25:24] expression of the inward work to fulfill
[1:25:26] all scripture that was the the outward
[1:25:28] expression that had to happen to fulfill
[1:25:31] the scripture in their lives but
[1:25:32] sometimes there's people that can't do
[1:25:34] it it just won't happen and that's fine
[1:25:35] God knows our hearts God's so much
[1:25:38] bigger than tiny formalities in this
[1:25:41] world I think it's so beautiful if we if
[1:25:43] we can just allow God to be God
[1:25:46] the first thing comes first by one
[1:25:49] Church no by one letter no by one Creed
[1:25:52] no but by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:25:55] into one body not by water not by power
[1:25:58] not by might but my by my spirit saith
[1:26:01] the Lord one Spirit were baptized what
[1:26:05] by the spirit where does the spirit say
[1:26:08] where is life in the blood
[1:26:11] coming through the blood of Christ
[1:26:14] first becoming a Believer outside of
[1:26:17] Christ without god without hope and the
[1:26:19] world condemned to die then by Grace
[1:26:22] elects us calls us to Christ we hear him
[1:26:26] inside the blood cell calling to us life
[1:26:31] you get it and we come then confess our
[1:26:34] sins and are baptized for the remission
[1:26:37] of our sins
[1:26:39] then taken through the blood till the
[1:26:42] blood cell till we come through the
[1:26:44] spray of blood
[1:26:45] then by the Holy Spirit
[1:26:47] are baptized inside this blood cell and
[1:26:51] we have Fellowship one with another
[1:26:53] while the blood of Jesus Christ the son
[1:26:55] of God cleanses from all unrighteousness
[1:26:58] oh my there you are I love how he says
[1:27:01] that we have Fellowship one with another
[1:27:03] we don't separate
[1:27:05] he goes on to say that's what we need
[1:27:07] positionally come first to Christ
[1:27:09] through the blood the shed blood
[1:27:12] then
[1:27:14] positionally were seated in Christ
[1:27:18] and that's our desire tonight brothers
[1:27:20] and sisters is to be seated in Christ
[1:27:22] Jesus to recognize that even though we
[1:27:26] were dead in sin and trespasses maybe
[1:27:29] some more than others on the outward
[1:27:31] appearance but you know what the word of
[1:27:33] God says brothers and sisters is to be
[1:27:34] guilty of the least is to be guilty of
[1:27:36] the whole
[1:27:37] doesn't matter if we've got a perfect
[1:27:39] life if we have still never surrendered
[1:27:41] our perfect life to Jesus Christ we're
[1:27:44] just as guilty as a murderer
[1:27:47] it's terrible to say it but it's true
[1:27:49] because the murderer isn't going to
[1:27:51] inherit the kingdom of God and neither
[1:27:53] is someone that says they're fine
[1:27:55] they're just fine they're not going to
[1:27:57] go all the way to the true baptism of
[1:27:59] the Holy Ghost they're both going to
[1:28:01] inherit incorruption
[1:28:04] or corruption sorry but tonight I'm just
[1:28:07] so thankful that we can talk to the
[1:28:09] faithful who are in Christ Jesus and and
[1:28:12] we talk about these things to to set a
[1:28:15] contrast not to try and make people feel
[1:28:17] bad or try and single out anybody
[1:28:20] because we would that everyone would
[1:28:22] come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[1:28:23] and how do we truly receive the baptism
[1:28:26] of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives brothers
[1:28:29] and sisters today we heard brother
[1:28:31] Branham say it but I'll say it tonight
[1:28:33] in my own words it's not by a Creed it's
[1:28:35] not by joining Calgary Living Word it's
[1:28:37] not by joining any other Living Word
[1:28:39] it's not by joining a message church or
[1:28:41] or saying that I believe God sent a
[1:28:43] prophet even you've got to believe what
[1:28:45] that Prophet who has since said in order
[1:28:48] to receive the Holy Ghost and outside of
[1:28:50] doing that brothers and sisters you
[1:28:52] might have a little bit of oil it might
[1:28:53] be a little bit of anointing
[1:28:55] but the word of God calls it unwise
[1:28:57] virgins
[1:28:58] maybe you believe the word of God but
[1:29:01] you're just not willing to go all the
[1:29:02] way to accept the message of the hour if
[1:29:05] you're not going to do that the same
[1:29:06] thing happened to Noah's day what
[1:29:08] happened
[1:29:09] I keep saying it but I can't help it if
[1:29:11] you didn't get in the boat you died
[1:29:13] if you don't get in the boat today
[1:29:14] you're going to die
[1:29:16] he sends a prophet for a purpose
[1:29:19] and we know that the word of God and
[1:29:21] Amos is it 3 7 says that surely the Lord
[1:29:24] will will do nothing but first he
[1:29:26] reveals it through his servants the
[1:29:28] prophets he's not going to come and
[1:29:30] judge a man without first telling him
[1:29:32] get right with me just make it right
[1:29:35] with me he's a just God
[1:29:39] we know this world doesn't want to hear
[1:29:41] the word prophet
[1:29:42] doesn't want to hear that that God sent
[1:29:45] a prophet and unless you're willing to
[1:29:46] actually listen to what that Prophet
[1:29:48] said and follow his instruction which is
[1:29:51] the instruction that Paul gave the
[1:29:52] church
[1:29:54] don't want to hear it
[1:29:55] comfortable things are good but we know
[1:29:58] that if you look at the Bible in the
[1:30:00] Book of Revelation I believe it is
[1:30:02] there's the church ages and the
[1:30:05] laodicean church age many people even
[1:30:07] Scholars would say that's the final
[1:30:09] Church age and here we are brothers and
[1:30:11] sisters and what does it say that that
[1:30:13] that church you know what he he he he
[1:30:15] just can't deal with us because we're
[1:30:17] lukewarm the laodicean conditioned is
[1:30:20] that you're lukewarm and you're formal
[1:30:22] and you're powerless and because you're
[1:30:24] lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth I
[1:30:26] would that you were hot or that you were
[1:30:28] called that you were one or the other
[1:30:31] we don't want to say no I'm rich and
[1:30:33] increased with goods and have need of
[1:30:35] nothing
[1:30:36] this whole entire world North America
[1:30:38] all around the world is Rich increased
[1:30:41] with goods and has need of nothing I
[1:30:43] don't know if there's ever been this
[1:30:45] much wealth in the world can't help but
[1:30:47] go back and think about the days of Noah
[1:30:49] where where our Prophet The Prophet for
[1:30:52] our day he said you know they were
[1:30:53] technologically advanced in those days
[1:30:56] and we know still today if you listen to
[1:30:58] theologians or or guys who are maybe the
[1:31:02] scientific
[1:31:03] um I don't know
[1:31:05] lost for words the Masters maybe of of
[1:31:07] the the Egyptian uh pyramids they still
[1:31:11] say you can't rebuild the pyramids
[1:31:13] there's no way the technology was higher
[1:31:16] than what we have today something was
[1:31:18] used to build those pyramids
[1:31:21] and we know the prophet said it was an
[1:31:23] atomic energy that actually threw the
[1:31:24] Earth off its axis and caused a whole
[1:31:27] bunch of different things to happen I'm
[1:31:28] not going to go into that tonight but
[1:31:29] you know there's a higher there's a
[1:31:32] higher knowledge there's there's a
[1:31:33] higher understanding and we think that
[1:31:36] we're very far advanced in the world in
[1:31:39] which we live in but you know they could
[1:31:41] have easily had cell phones in Noah's
[1:31:43] day
[1:31:45] crazy but brother Branham said they
[1:31:47] launched Rockets into the atmosphere to
[1:31:48] say
[1:31:49] you don't have water up there we can
[1:31:52] prove to you scientifically that it's
[1:31:53] never going to rain
[1:31:56] what else did they have what kind of
[1:31:58] other power did they have the ability to
[1:32:00] control atomic energy to lift stones and
[1:32:03] positionally place them to cut them so
[1:32:05] perfectly that you couldn't even fit a
[1:32:07] razor blade between them so strong so
[1:32:10] strongly fit together that they would go
[1:32:12] through an entire flood a delusion of
[1:32:15] water on this Earth that's never been
[1:32:16] before never will be again we know that
[1:32:19] there was the flood of water but now
[1:32:21] we're looking at a flood of fire and
[1:32:23] that fire is going to fall any one of
[1:32:25] these days
[1:32:26] brother badam says it in the message the
[1:32:28] invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ we was expecting it the the
[1:32:32] glacier of fire right at the end of that
[1:32:34] message all day long we heard them
[1:32:36] talking about it that it's going to come
[1:32:38] it's going to come it's going to come
[1:32:39] and he said he was standing there with
[1:32:41] his wife I just love the description of
[1:32:43] it because it's a perfect description of
[1:32:45] what's going to happen in the life of a
[1:32:46] Believer we're going to be in our
[1:32:48] positions he talks about husband and
[1:32:50] wife just being there expecting it to
[1:32:52] happen and then there was a moment where
[1:32:54] he heard it over the loudspeaker all
[1:32:56] things are ready
[1:32:58] and then he said he heard a voice by him
[1:33:00] it wasn't coming from the loudspeaker it
[1:33:02] was a voice by him
[1:33:04] saying Let the Fire Fall
[1:33:06] brothers and sisters what day do we live
[1:33:08] in where are we at today my goodness
[1:33:13] I'm so encouraged tonight I just was as
[1:33:15] I was studying this thinking that by the
[1:33:18] will of God he's speaking to the
[1:33:20] faithful in Jesus Christ and then we
[1:33:22] have this isn't Paul speaking brothers
[1:33:25] and sisters this is God
[1:33:27] speaking through the Apostle God
[1:33:30] ministering through the missionary God
[1:33:33] giving a spiritual inspiration for him
[1:33:37] to write this out the very next verse
[1:33:40] just like the angel when it would come
[1:33:43] to to someone in the Bible don't fear
[1:33:45] just relax everything is going to be
[1:33:48] okay his his salutation his grace be to
[1:33:51] you and peace from God our Father and
[1:33:55] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:58] so if you ever hear anything contrary to
[1:34:00] that brothers and sisters
[1:34:02] any other words come to your mind that
[1:34:05] you know you're a scoundrel maybe you're
[1:34:07] bad maybe you've done something wrong
[1:34:09] you're terrible all these negative
[1:34:12] thoughts that the devil can try and put
[1:34:14] in our minds it's Satan trying to
[1:34:16] bombard us to make us feel bad because
[1:34:18] that's not what the word of God says the
[1:34:20] word of God says Grace be to you and
[1:34:23] peace from God our Father and from the
[1:34:25] Lord Jesus Christ so if we're not
[1:34:27] feeling peace what's going on there's
[1:34:30] something wrong brothers and sisters we
[1:34:31] have the ability to recognize that he is
[1:34:34] speaking to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:34:38] and the thing that I love what probably
[1:34:40] the greatest thing that I love just for
[1:34:42] me it's my my thing with what the
[1:34:45] prophet said is our feelings have
[1:34:46] nothing to do with it if we were to
[1:34:48] dwell on our scriptural identity about
[1:34:51] our feelings we would be doomed there
[1:34:53] would be no way that we would ever be
[1:34:55] able to drag our carcass to church again
[1:34:58] for another service after the things
[1:35:00] that we've gone through this week right
[1:35:02] that's many times the way that I feel I
[1:35:04] just wouldn't be able to do it how could
[1:35:07] I possibly ever go and stand before the
[1:35:09] truly elect bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:35:12] Minister this this word the sacred word
[1:35:15] of God but my feelings have nothing to
[1:35:17] do with it
[1:35:19] if he has called me the faithful in
[1:35:21] Christ Jesus and it's by the will of God
[1:35:23] I just want to put my foot forward and
[1:35:26] say Hey you know I I know that he's
[1:35:28] called me and I know that he will make a
[1:35:30] way for it and that's what we all do
[1:35:32] brothers and sisters and by doing that
[1:35:34] that demonstrates whose side you're on
[1:35:37] that demonstrates the faithful in Christ
[1:35:40] Jesus and now just for the record it's
[1:35:42] not because you come here to this church
[1:35:44] it's because you press play for the
[1:35:46] message of the hour it's because you go
[1:35:48] on your knees and you pray to this God
[1:35:50] that we talk about it's because you
[1:35:52] witness the testimony of Jesus Christ to
[1:35:54] the world around you you're faithful in
[1:35:57] Christ Jesus
[1:36:00] it's got nothing to do with the church
[1:36:01] the church is just a little display of
[1:36:04] it but it's so good isn't it to bring
[1:36:06] your licks of fire together bring our
[1:36:07] Elixir fire together and just Worship
[1:36:09] the Lord knowing that we are the
[1:36:11] faithful called before the foundation of
[1:36:13] the world by the will of God to actually
[1:36:16] have Grace ministered to us and peace
[1:36:18] from God our Father and from the Lord
[1:36:20] Jesus Christ I don't want to go too far
[1:36:23] into this tonight but I just want to
[1:36:25] encourage us if you have any questions
[1:36:27] about it just maybe ask me or pick up
[1:36:30] the book and and just read the first
[1:36:32] chapter of Ephesians because he's not
[1:36:34] talking about another group of people
[1:36:36] he's talking to you tonight brothers and
[1:36:38] sisters he's talking to me when I read
[1:36:40] this I can't help but just get like that
[1:36:42] story of that that man who is living
[1:36:45] with his daughter and and she got got
[1:36:48] fed up with him getting so excited
[1:36:50] having his Pentecostal experience every
[1:36:52] time he'd read his Bible and she wanted
[1:36:54] to have the tea party remember that and
[1:36:56] and she said I'm going to have the Tea
[1:36:58] Party dad you got to go upstairs and
[1:36:59] just be quiet while I have the tea party
[1:37:01] we don't want you getting too crazy and
[1:37:03] Pentecostal with us here and and so she
[1:37:06] sends them up there and doesn't give him
[1:37:07] his Bible but he starts reading that
[1:37:09] that magazine I don't know what it was a
[1:37:11] National Geographic maybe and he starts
[1:37:12] seeing God in creation and he just
[1:37:15] starts having a fit again because he
[1:37:17] just knows that God is in complete
[1:37:19] control he's created it all and it's all
[1:37:21] for him and and by him all things were
[1:37:23] created but he can recognize as a
[1:37:26] faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:37:28] that he has a position I'll call the
[1:37:31] musicians tonight
[1:37:33] as we close I just want to encourage us
[1:37:35] brothers and sisters as the Devil comes
[1:37:37] around as he rages in our lives just
[1:37:40] remember it's by the will of God that
[1:37:42] you are the faithful in Christ Jesus and
[1:37:46] he has desired for Grace to be unto you
[1:37:49] and for peace
[1:37:52] from God our Father and from the Lord
[1:37:54] Jesus Christ
[1:37:56] not destruction not Terror not fear not
[1:38:00] anger not anxiety all of those are of
[1:38:04] the devil every single one of them
[1:38:07] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:38:10] those who are in Christ Jesus so
[1:38:12] brothers and sisters if you truly are in
[1:38:14] Christ Jesus you're faithful in Christ
[1:38:16] Jesus you got no condemnation there's
[1:38:19] there's no sin that can be imputed
[1:38:21] against you even though he's up there
[1:38:22] trying so hard to to minister to bring
[1:38:27] things accusations against the Brethren
[1:38:29] there's nothing that will be imputed to
[1:38:31] you tonight
[1:38:32] maybe just stand as we bow in prayer
[1:38:38] gracious Heavenly Father tonight we
[1:38:40] thank you Father that you have called us
[1:38:43] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:38:45] here
[1:38:47] excuse me father to be willing
[1:38:50] recipients of your word
[1:38:52] what a tremendous blessing it is father
[1:38:55] to recognize that there's nothing that
[1:38:57] we've done or nothing that we could ever
[1:38:59] do
[1:39:00] except for recognize what you've already
[1:39:02] done for us
[1:39:05] and Lord we recognize that by by saying
[1:39:08] Amen to the word to recognize that you
[1:39:11] had a special message Father in your
[1:39:14] Bible that you gave to all of the ages
[1:39:17] Lord Jesus it was evolving and and
[1:39:19] growing and and it came to the place
[1:39:21] where it was a complete word but there
[1:39:23] were still mysteries encapsulated in
[1:39:26] that word but father at the End of Time
[1:39:28] Lord you didn't just leave man looking
[1:39:31] at those Mysteries poking at those
[1:39:33] Mysteries you sent a prophet Lord and
[1:39:35] Lord he didn't open those Mysteries but
[1:39:38] you opened those Mysteries through that
[1:39:39] prophet and you revealed those Mysteries
[1:39:42] through that Prophet Lord Jesus and we
[1:39:45] know that there's no more Mysteries
[1:39:46] because in Revelations 10 7 it says when
[1:39:49] when oh
[1:39:51] father
[1:39:52] Lord Jesus we just love you we thank you
[1:39:55] tonight I pray that Lord you would just
[1:39:57] minister to us a little further as we go
[1:39:59] along the way Lord father that you would
[1:40:01] help us to just take your word in in our
[1:40:04] hearts Lord and father just be able to
[1:40:06] be living Witnesses of your life to the
[1:40:09] world around us Lord let our feelings
[1:40:11] not have anything to do with it help us
[1:40:13] to push down those feelings Lord when
[1:40:16] they try to rise up in our lives
[1:40:19] help us to look towards you father to
[1:40:22] look into your word and to see the
[1:40:23] scriptural identity
[1:40:25] the identification of Your Love towards
[1:40:27] us father of your grace and your peace
[1:40:30] towards us
[1:40:31] father we love you and we thank you for
[1:40:34] writing our names in the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:36] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:40:38] father Lord before there was even angels
[1:40:41] created before there was even a speck of
[1:40:43] Stardust is what your Prophet said
[1:40:45] whether you chose us in you father we
[1:40:48] love you and we thank you and we pray
[1:40:50] that you would just receive our praise
[1:40:51] tonight as we lord close the service and
[1:40:54] as we go our separate ways father I pray
[1:40:56] that you would just put a song in our
[1:40:58] hearts Lord Jesus that we would not be
[1:41:00] afraid to worship you the way that you
[1:41:03] desire to be worshiped father
[1:41:05] we just love you father and we thank you
[1:41:07] tonight we ask all these things now and
[1:41:09] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:41:12] amen
[1:41:13] amen
[1:41:18] the more that I Surrender
[1:41:22] the lighter my load
[1:41:26] the that I Surrender
