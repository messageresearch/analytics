[15:47] youone are my heart desire and my
[15:57] [Music]
[16:03] let's bow our head for a word of
[16:05] [Music]
[16:09] prayer whereby given unto
[16:13] us great grace and precious
[16:17] promises that by these we might be
[16:22] partakers of the Divine Natures of
[16:25] God having escaped the corruption that
[16:28] is in the world world through
[16:31] lust Heavenly
[16:34] Father this morning we have come before
[16:36] you Lord
[16:39] amen you know us better than we know
[16:42] ourselves Lord because sometime we do
[16:46] stuff and after we say if I knew I would
[16:49] have never done it
[16:51] father this is an indication father God
[16:54] we don't even know
[16:57] ourselves but you know us father because
[17:01] you are the god that created us
[17:04] father this morning Father we have needs
[17:07] and expectations father and we have come
[17:11] before you because you are the god that
[17:14] can answer to all our questions
[17:17] father Lord I always say that father God
[17:21] there are things in our minds father God
[17:24] and if we are trying in our own selves
[17:27] father God we can't get rid of
[17:29] right father you said you detest a man
[17:34] that has Evil's mindset father God and
[17:38] sometime it's not up to us father God
[17:41] and unfortunately sometime father we
[17:44] jump we jump into conclusions not even
[17:46] understanding what is happening behind
[17:48] the
[17:49] scene because your word said we are not
[17:52] to fight against flesh and blood but
[17:55] fighting against all the principalities
[17:58] in the the invisible
[18:00] World father may we understand the
[18:03] spirit behind the actions of our own
[18:06] selves not to fight against the physical
[18:10] body that is in front of us father
[18:13] because sometime our brothers our
[18:15] sisters say some something father God
[18:17] it's not even them saying it father God
[18:20] but because we fail to understand that
[18:22] spirit that is acting behind it father
[18:25] God we jump into conclusion father God
[18:28] and which cause us to sins against you
[18:30] father may we pray for one another
[18:33] father God so that we can understand
[18:36] father help us this morning Father God
[18:38] because we need your help on a daily
[18:41] basis we cannot afford father God for
[18:44] you not to help us because if you're not
[18:46] helping us father God it is guaranteed
[18:49] that the the devil will overtake us
[18:51] father right Lord God I pray for
[18:54] somebody here and I pray for somebody
[18:57] special father God the one who has
[18:59] question that needs answers the one who
[19:01] has confusions that needs to be cleared
[19:03] father God may you answer that person
[19:06] this morning Lord Hallelujah Lord there
[19:08] are those that are at home that cannot
[19:10] make it this morning for some reason we
[19:12] cannot determine or detect father God
[19:14] but you are the god that knows us from
[19:17] the bottom of of our hearts If You Can
[19:19] Count every single hair in our heads
[19:21] father God there is nothing you cannot
[19:23] do father and I pray father God that you
[19:26] reach into that individual who whoever
[19:29] is in here father God that have a need
[19:30] that cannot express father God and I
[19:33] pray father God that you will heal that
[19:35] individual answer to the question father
[19:37] God and provide it to whatever they
[19:39] asking us the Bible
[19:42] says whatever that we are asking
[19:45] according to your will father God you
[19:46] will give it unto us may you give it to
[19:50] us father God Amen we are not coming
[19:53] here father God to see one another but
[19:56] we are coming here to worship ship you
[19:59] to give you praise to give you honor
[20:02] that you only deserve because you are
[20:05] the only
[20:06] one worthy to break this
[20:10] seal and upend the scroll
[20:14] father Lord I pray for for us including
[20:19] me
[20:20] father I pray for us
[20:23] Lord to
[20:26] understand that you are with we need to
[20:29] have in one mind father
[20:32] God we need to have the minds of
[20:35] Christ and when something is happening
[20:38] we cannot understand father God may we
[20:40] be wise enough to ask the questions what
[20:43] would Christ
[20:47] do how would Christ act yes Lord that
[20:51] will help us Lord to understand that we
[20:54] are not us but we are living for him
[20:57] amen to please him we are not here to to
[21:00] please ourself father God but to please
[21:02] you amen Lord it is two-way conversation
[21:07] in here father God we are not coming

[46:34] today oh my thank you musicians if you
[46:38] have your Bibles today I'd just like to
[46:39] read a scripture from Luke chapter
[46:41] 7 Luke chapter
[46:44] 7 verse one a very familiar
[46:49] story Luke chapter
[46:54] 7 I think it's just a
[46:57] an amazing story I want to continue on
[46:59] with our discussion about God's will but
[47:02] just in a little bit of a different
[47:05] way Luke 7:1 it says now when he had
[47:10] ended all his sayings in the audience of
[47:13] the people he entered into capernium and
[47:17] a certain centurion's servant who was
[47:19] dear unto him was sick and ready to die
[47:24] he was pretty
[47:25] ill and when when he heard of
[47:28] Jesus he sent unto him the Elders of the
[47:31] Jews beseeching him that he would come
[47:35] and heal his
[47:36] servant and when they came to Jesus they
[47:39] besought him instantly saying that he
[47:43] was worthy for whom he should do this
[47:47] for he loveth our nation and he hath
[47:49] built us a
[47:51] synagogue then Jesus went with
[47:53] them and when he was now not far from
[47:56] the house the Centurion sent friends to
[47:58] him saying unto him Lord trouble not
[48:01] thyself for I'm not worthy that thou
[48:04] should US enter under my
[48:07] roof wherefore neither thought I myself
[48:10] worthy to come unto thee this guy was in
[48:13] a real spot eh that's right but say in a
[48:18] word and my servant shall be healed
[48:22] let's just bow in prayer one more
[48:24] time Heavenly Father Lord we just pray
[48:27] that this morning just like this
[48:30] Centurion said
[48:32] father just just say a word Lord Jesus
[48:36] father we have many needs in our
[48:38] lives sometimes it's physical sometimes
[48:42] it's Financial sometimes it's
[48:44] relationship based father this morning
[48:48] we know that you're more than able to
[48:49] meet each and every one of those needs
[48:52] but father most of all we pray that you
[48:54] would just get right down to the root
[48:56] cause of it all and that is our
[48:59] spiritual health Lord Jesus father we
[49:02] pray that you would minister to our very
[49:04] Souls today Father one word to our very
[49:07] Souls today Father could change every
[49:10] aspect of our life every single need
[49:13] that we have could be met if we're
[49:14] willing to Humble ourselves unto your
[49:17] word today so father we pray that you
[49:19] would just break down the barriers Lord
[49:21] help us to get beside ourselves today
[49:24] and give you the preeminence that you
[49:26] desire Lord Jesus father that when we
[49:29] leave this building here today we would
[49:30] not be the same but we would say we have
[49:33] truly heard from you Lord Jesus we love
[49:36] you and we thank you we just commit each
[49:38] life into your hands For Your Glory in
[49:41] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[49:44] bless you this morning you may be
[49:47] seated just a few announcements before
[49:50] we get going here we uh have a potluck
[49:52] this afternoon we'll meet out at our
[49:54] house today and I believe everything is
[49:56] set and uh we'll aim to start for 2:00
[50:00] so if you plan to come and want to eat
[50:03] there's uh going to be probably lots of
[50:05] food there so we certainly welcome you
[50:08] um certainly thankful for the Brethren
[50:11] who are out in the mission field this
[50:13] morning brother Toby as we mentioned in
[50:15] Edmonton at Edmonton Living Word and
[50:18] brother Gilbert in Lethbridge with the
[50:21] Lethbridge meetings there that
[50:23] Lethbridge uh Gathering is sure getting
[50:26] good good there's a lot going on there
[50:28] and we're certainly thankful to see the
[50:30] Lord move there um just wanted to
[50:33] mention we have the annual meetings they
[50:36] have the annual meetings happening in
[50:37] Edmonton next weekend at end time
[50:39] message Tabernacle I believe Brother
[50:41] David Siler and Wayne Lawson will be

[51:02] we've planned this a year out we've
[51:03] talked about it often on we have brother
[51:05] Andrew Glover here August 16th 17th and
[51:09] 18th and I believe those dates are
[51:12] marked on the calendar and the times as
[51:14] well so if you have any questions by all
[51:17] means just take a look there or reach
[51:19] out we're certainly happy to talk to you
[51:20] as well um are you happy this
[51:24] morning certainly wonderful to be
[51:26] gathered together in his name amen
[51:28] there's a lot going on in the world uh
[51:30] I'm not going to get political I could I
[51:33] find it fascinating because as a
[51:37] believer of this message of the hour we
[51:39] can see uh how late it really is we can
[51:42] see the the handwriting on the wall as
[51:44] it were and there's so much going on and
[51:47] it's happening so quickly um it's just
[51:50] amazing to be alive in this
[51:53] day I just wanted to say a big thank you
[51:56] um
[51:57] to someone and I don't know who it's
[52:00] kind of an interesting statement
[52:02] Hallelujah two years ago for my birthday
[52:04] I was given a gift an anonymous gift an
[52:07] envelope with a card that said God bless
[52:10] you Pastor this is for you and uh
[52:13] hopefully you can find yourself a nice
[52:15] suit of clothes and so two years I've
[52:18] held on to it and I've waited and I
[52:21] found the right opportunity the right
[52:23] occasion and the Lord really blessed me
[52:25] it was well worth the w wait but I don't
[52:27] know who gave it to me I know someone
[52:29] did and uh it was from this congregation
[52:31] so I just want to say God richly bless
[52:33] you and thank you from the bottom of my
[52:36] heart I uh I'm not a shopper I don't
[52:39] like to go clothes shopping so it took
[52:41] me two years before I could actually do
[52:43] something with it but you know every
[52:45] time I would think about it I should go
[52:47] and do something with this gift I should
[52:48] go to the store the mall I think I even
[52:50] talked to brother Daniel about it
[52:52] somehow some way maybe we could do this
[52:54] but I just I I can't do it I can't go to
[52:56] a store and look at yeah it doesn't
[52:59] doesn't doesn't work for me so anyways
[53:02] God bless you thank you so much whoever
[53:04] that was I very much appreciate that and
[53:06] uh you know brother bradam talks about
[53:07] it I didn't bring the quote this morning
[53:09] I'm just going to mention it he said
[53:10] there's something really important about
[53:12] having a good suit of clothes it's one
[53:14] thing to have a suit of clothes but they
[53:16] wear out when you sweat when you
[53:17] perspire and and you wear them a lot so
[53:20] there's something really good about
[53:22] getting a good suit of clothes and I
[53:24] waited to get a good suit so God bless
[53:27] you thank you so much it means a lot to
[53:29] me
[53:30] amen getting into our uh our lesson
[53:33] today um the service we had talked a lot
[53:38] recently about God's will being his word
[53:41] and understanding that that's what the
[53:43] prophet said that's what God Said
[53:44] through the prophet that God's will
[53:47] really is his word and it's important
[53:49] for us to understand that God's will is
[53:52] his word and I know that many many
[53:53] people know that there excuse me there
[53:56] might be one or two people that don't
[53:57] really know that but that is truly what
[53:59] the prophet for our day said God's will
[54:02] truly is his word so it behooves us to
[54:05] know what his word says how can we know
[54:08] his will if we're not willing to read
[54:10] his word and and how do we know what his
[54:13] will is if we don't read the correct
[54:16] word there's so many translations and
[54:18] versions now of the word of God if
[54:21] anybody is interested or or curious the
[54:23] prophet in our day we we understand it
[54:26] full well he used the King James version
[54:28] Bible for that purpose and some people
[54:31] might not understand the prophet some
[54:33] people understand the prophet and uh it
[54:37] it's it's a one room Schoolhouse so I
[54:39] trust that you'll bear with me many
[54:41] people probably know more uh about the
[54:44] message than I'll ever know and and I
[54:46] don't claim to be a message Theologian I
[54:49] just know that I met the author of this
[54:51] book I was able to meet the author of
[54:53] the King James version of the Bible some
[54:56] people might say how could you do that
[54:58] because there was a bunch of different
[54:59] people that actually were the authors no
[55:01] no no there's no authors there's only
[55:04] one author and it's not the father and
[55:06] it's not the son and it's not the Holy
[55:08] Ghost it's the Lord Jesus Christ God
[55:11] almighty is the author of this book but
[55:14] it's Satan's job to try and get it just
[55:16] one word off so some people would say
[55:18] well I I just like this version of the
[55:20] Bible just a little bit better and I
[55:22] like that version of the Bible just a
[55:24] little bit easier to read to understand
[55:27] you know sometimes we'll even use an
[55:28] amplified version to try and expound
[55:31] upon a word or a thought or a sentence
[55:33] and and that's all fine and good but the
[55:35] absolute comes down to the King James
[55:37] version Bible because that is the Bible
[55:40] that was given to the prophet to use for
[55:42] this age and when we want to try and and
[55:45] and and argue that and and try and get
[55:47] around that I would just have to say
[55:49] what spirit is it that's trying to do
[55:51] that that causes a person to want to
[55:53] actually do something different than
[55:55] what the prophet brought it just doesn't
[55:57] make sense and we know that it's not the
[56:00] same Spirit that's all so anyways the
[56:03] the the King James version Bible is
[56:06] it and I apologize maybe it's a little
[56:09] bit straight but that's really the way
[56:11] it is it's got to be that way because if
[56:13] we don't follow the instruction of the
[56:14] Prophet we're not going to get the right
[56:17] results it's just not going to happen so
[56:20] anyways as usual I would say this if you
[56:23] really want to understand just get the
[56:25] Holy Ghost amen the only way you're
[56:28] going to understand what we're saying
[56:29] here is to get the true baptism of the
[56:31] Holy Spirit the only way you're going to
[56:33] get the true baptism of the holy spirit
[56:34] is to come according to the word for our
[56:36] day and that word for our day is to
[56:38] repent get baptized in the name of the
[56:40] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[56:42] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[56:44] of the Holy Ghost and it's for you and
[56:47] your
[56:48] family and even whosoever anybody in the
[56:52] world it's for them if they want
[56:55] it if they're willing to come according
[56:57] to the word amen hallelujah but it's not
[57:00] for everyone unfortunately you know some
[57:02] some people would say first that uh
[57:05] we've got to go through the
[57:06] justification stage and that we have to
[57:08] go through the sanctification stage and
[57:11] yeah indeed we we have the works of
[57:13] Grace and and we need to experience
[57:15] those we need to see those in our lives
[57:18] but I I I would strongly caution anyone
[57:21] to to hold back from getting baptized if
[57:24] they have the desire to get baptized
[57:26] if they understand what's being said to
[57:28] them and they understand there's a a
[57:31] promise of the Holy Ghost for them in
[57:33] their life I think it would just be a
[57:36] shame for a person to say well hold on
[57:38] you need to just wait a little bit
[57:40] because maybe we need to see a little
[57:41] bit of justification in your life or
[57:43] maybe we need to see a little bit of
[57:44] sanctification in your life and and we
[57:46] know that that justification and
[57:49] sanctification there they're compared to
[57:51] many times by the prophet in our day he
[57:53] uses a story about a a cup being being
[57:56] being tossed in the chicken yard and we
[57:58] all have talked about the chicken yard a
[57:59] lot it's a messy place it's not a very
[58:02] nice place and how that cup can be just
[58:04] there in the chicken yard and it's a cup
[58:07] and it's got a use or at least it had a
[58:09] use if you've ever seen what would would
[58:11] look like after a while but while it's
[58:13] there you can pick that cup up and and
[58:15] as you pick that cup up that's
[58:17] justifying that cup and saying that cup
[58:19] is is potentially useful for something
[58:22] but it's covered in dirt maybe it's got
[58:24] worms maybe it's got chicken
[58:26] dung on it maybe it's just a nasty cup
[58:28] and you would never think you'd want to
[58:30] use it again but you could take that cup
[58:32] now and take it and sanitize that cup
[58:34] and wash it out so you could be
[58:36] justified being picked up out of the
[58:38] ground but then you can actually be
[58:41] Sanctified or sanitized cleaned out and
[58:44] set aside for service so the two acts
[58:47] justification and sanctification you
[58:49] know what can happen is sometimes we can
[58:51] find ourselves stuck in a position where
[58:53] we're just Sanctified we're just
[58:56] sanitized and set aside for service and
[58:59] you know unfortunately those those
[59:01] situations are pretty easy to spot
[59:03] because there's a lot of legalism that
[59:05] goes along with that I'm all cleaned out
[59:08] and I'm ready to go I'm set aside for
[59:10] service brother everything in my life is
[59:12] good but look at your life and look at
[59:14] their life and look at all the other
[59:16] situations when we start to see that we
[59:18] can see what's G on we're just stuck in
[59:20] a stage we're stuck in a face but I I
[59:22] say go on and get into Christ get that
[59:25] bap of the Holy Ghost get the filling of
[59:28] that cup now when you get full you're no
[59:31] longer interested in all of that stuff
[59:33] that you once were you're not stuck
[59:35] being Sanctified that's right you can go
[59:38] on to joy and peace and love and
[59:43] longsuffering and gentleness and
[59:45] goodness and peace you don't have to
[59:48] stay in that situation but yes indeed we
[59:51] do have the works of Grace uh you do
[59:54] need to get the Holy Ghost in your life
[59:55] to understand what we're talking about
[59:57] today where I'm going today brothers and
[59:59] sisters is kind of picking up from where
[1:00:00] we left off a little while ago talking
[1:00:02] about God's will being his word and and
[1:00:04] how sort of we have Wednesday night
[1:00:06] service crossing over into Sunday
[1:00:08] service this is a little bit of what I
[1:00:10] preached in Ohio and I trust it's okay I
[1:00:12] actually had prepared this on my heart
[1:00:14] for here and and I just couldn't stop
[1:00:17] with it I had to preach it there and uh
[1:00:20] I think it's just a wonderful thing and
[1:00:21] we could probably preach on this until
[1:00:23] the Rapture comes because this is the
[1:00:25] bride's Commission we could preach about
[1:00:27] all of the different ages that have gone
[1:00:29] by and they nice historical lessons and
[1:00:32] there's things in there that we could
[1:00:33] get out of it but really brothers and
[1:00:34] sisters who are we and where are we at
[1:00:38] is really what's going to change our
[1:00:39] body this is the bride's Revival and for
[1:00:42] some people they might be in the leoan
[1:00:44] church age but other people are in The
[1:00:47] Bride age there is an age of the Bride
[1:00:50] of Jesus Christ and it's not being stuck
[1:00:53] in a Sanctified position it's not being
[1:00:55] stuck in the leoan church age amen we're
[1:00:59] not interested in just getting people to
[1:01:01] church when we're just getting people to
[1:01:03] church we're just getting people
[1:01:04] Justified and Sanctified and that's it
[1:01:08] we're getting an association we're
[1:01:09] getting a a membership maybe a badge
[1:01:12] that would do something for us and you
[1:01:14] know brothers and sisters I handed out
[1:01:15] those little little Cloud brooches those
[1:01:18] badges that's not something that's an
[1:01:20] association that's something to remind
[1:01:22] us about what's happened in this age
[1:01:25] something significant again happened in
[1:01:26] 1963 brothers and sisters and it wasn't
[1:01:29] just something that's just put on a
[1:01:31] poster and and and we pass it around and
[1:01:33] now we just put it on a brooch and put
[1:01:34] it on our our our suit or our our coat
[1:01:37] or our hat or whatever it is we do with
[1:01:39] it that is to represent something very
[1:01:41] significant it's not to worship a man
[1:01:44] it's to understand that there was
[1:01:45] actually a coming of someone very
[1:01:48] significant to actually open the word of
[1:01:52] God not just to open the word of God but
[1:01:54] to take the word of God God and put it
[1:01:57] back in the hands of man
[1:01:59] again just like in the Garden of Eden we
[1:02:01] had an opportunity to live for a
[1:02:04] thousand years to actually create we
[1:02:07] know that Adam was given a bride so that
[1:02:09] he could recreate himself that's the
[1:02:12] reason he had a bride taken from his
[1:02:14] side but we know that she
[1:02:17] fell but the purpose of it was so that
[1:02:20] they could demonstrate the life of God
[1:02:23] we know God was God of heaven and Adam
[1:02:26] was God of the Earth but what happened
[1:02:28] was he stepped out to save his wife she
[1:02:32] fell he loved her she was a part of him
[1:02:34] he wouldn't let her go so he went and he
[1:02:36] rescued her and doing so he stepped out
[1:02:39] of Eternity with Mankind and created the
[1:02:42] fall it wasn't Eve that did it Eve
[1:02:45] caused the fall sure but Adam is the one
[1:02:47] that truly caused it because he stepped
[1:02:49] out to save his wife now some might say
[1:02:53] brother bam said it differently and I'm
[1:02:54] not interested in that I'm just trying
[1:02:56] to illustrate this brothers and sisters
[1:02:57] what happened was they had free access
[1:03:00] to the tree of life that tree of life
[1:03:02] came and walked with them in the cool of
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:05] evening until they stepped out from
[1:03:08] their Eternal estate from their first
[1:03:10] estate and when they did that that tree
[1:03:12] of life was now blocked forever amen
[1:03:16] there was a flaming sword that was put
[1:03:18] in front of that tree of life stopping
[1:03:20] them from access to that to coming and
[1:03:22] walking in the cool of the evening
[1:03:23] fellowshipping with that word and that
[1:03:26] word that tree of life was God himself
[1:03:29] the Lord Jesus Christ now whether it was
[1:03:31] his theophany body or whether it was a
[1:03:33] tree I'm not getting into that today
[1:03:35] what I am saying is that one that walked
[1:03:37] with him Adam in the cool of the evening
[1:03:40] it was stopped it was blocked because of
[1:03:42] the fall but 1963 something significant
[1:03:45] happened that that same one that walked
[1:03:48] with him in the cool of the evening came
[1:03:50] down and actually opened the way back to
[1:03:53] the tree of life again that's what
[1:03:55] happened in 1963 that's why we wear that
[1:03:58] brooch that's why we have that picture
[1:04:01] because we identify what
[1:04:03] happened it's way more than just a man
[1:04:06] that that had a Supernatural Ministry in
[1:04:08] his life it's the Lord Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ yes it is indwelling his bride
[1:04:15] body thank you Lord we're not interested
[1:04:17] in just getting people to church we're
[1:04:19] interested in getting people to Christ
[1:04:21] and even more I would say we're
[1:04:22] interested in getting Christ into people
[1:04:25] because when Christ truly gets into
[1:04:27] people people become new creatures amen
[1:04:30] they don't still have the old desires
[1:04:32] the old tempers the old mannerisms the
[1:04:34] old problems in their lives they
[1:04:39] change so I want to say today if we
[1:04:41] still have the old mannerisms in our
[1:04:44] lives what's wrong yeah is it the fruit
[1:04:48] of the spirit living out through us
[1:04:50] because if it ain't the fruit of the
[1:04:51] spirit living out through us what's
[1:04:53] going on
[1:04:55] I want to get into it eventually we're
[1:04:57] not going to today we know what the
[1:04:59] fruit of the spirit is I'm going to
[1:05:01] mention this a few different times you
[1:05:03] know what's really been on my heart
[1:05:04] brothers and sisters is the fruit of the
[1:05:05] spirit we talk about it so much we know
[1:05:07] what the fruit of the spirit is I'm not
[1:05:09] going to really name it right now but I
[1:05:11] just want to say this the fruit of the
[1:05:13] spirit is something that we all desire I
[1:05:15] know we do if I said to the today who
[1:05:17] desires the fruit of the spirit in their
[1:05:19] lives who desires to eat of the fruit of
[1:05:21] the spirit in their lives I'm sure
[1:05:23] everybody would put their hand up in
[1:05:24] here I'm not asking for a show of hands
[1:05:27] but you know what I believe the Lord's
[1:05:29] been showing me the fruit of the spirit
[1:05:31] isn't for us amen the fruit of the
[1:05:33] spirit is for others amen what fruit is
[1:05:36] hanging on our trees
[1:05:38] malice
[1:05:40] anger frustration Vengeance all these
[1:05:44] different fruit is that what people is
[1:05:46] that all our spouses can pick off our
[1:05:48] tree oh my a buz saww
[1:05:52] temper that's what we give our wife
[1:05:54] today a buz saww temper we we give our
[1:05:57] our husband uh uh Rebellion we give our
[1:06:00] our our spouses our children can only
[1:06:03] see parents that are so caught up in
[1:06:05] their lives in their world with their
[1:06:07] careers they've got no time for
[1:06:10] them I'm speaking from experience here
[1:06:12] I'm not talking about anyone here except
[1:06:13] for this guy this is what we went
[1:06:15] through here in our family ask my
[1:06:18] wife but what fruit do we have bearing
[1:06:21] on our leaves because what did he say I
[1:06:23] am the vine and ye are the branches and
[1:06:25] the branches that produce fruit he'll
[1:06:28] Purge yeah so what fruit are we bearing
[1:06:32] for our family to pick what fruit are we
[1:06:35] bearing for our brothers and our sisters
[1:06:37] to pick because if it's not according to
[1:06:40] the word it's the wrong fruit brothers
[1:06:42] and sisters it's the wrong fruit and you
[1:06:45] know what every fruit is for a purpose
[1:06:47] the fruit contains all I wasn't going to
[1:06:49] do this today the fruit contains the
[1:06:51] seed and every seed will bring forth
[1:06:54] after its own kind so if we only have
[1:06:57] that fruit on our
[1:06:59] branches our children are going to be
[1:07:01] eating that
[1:07:02] fruit brother Toby said it when he
[1:07:04] preached we could be we can be justified
[1:07:07] we can be Sanctified and we can be
[1:07:09] teaching our children that that's as far
[1:07:11] as you need to
[1:07:12] go and what's going to happen to those
[1:07:14] children they're going to grow up and
[1:07:16] they're going to think that's as far as
[1:07:17] we need to go it's okay to live a
[1:07:20] different life outside of church is it
[1:07:22] it's not I'm here to tell you it's not
[1:07:26] our lives outside of church had better
[1:07:28] line up with our lives inside church or
[1:07:31] our lives inside church had better line
[1:07:34] out with our lives outside of church you
[1:07:36] understand what I'm saying we can't live
[1:07:37] two lives we can't be two people come on
[1:07:40] the word of God says that a sweet well
[1:07:43] sweet water doesn't come forth from the
[1:07:46] same well as Bitter Water they don't mix
[1:07:50] you get brackish water and you can't
[1:07:52] drink that water
[1:07:55] yes indeed we need the works of
[1:07:57] Grace amen but you know what just the
[1:08:00] works of Grace is just getting people to
[1:08:02] church we want to get into Christ and
[1:08:04] you know there's been Decades of Creeds
[1:08:06] and dogmas I I came into the message
[1:08:08] about 2005 I was raised in in Pentecost
[1:08:11] and you know I I I I I know I I watched
[1:08:13] a lot of late night television a lot of
[1:08:16] evangelists on TV begging for money and
[1:08:18] calling for the will of God in terms of
[1:08:21] blessings and and give give give and I
[1:08:23] thought you know that's just all
[1:08:24] Christianity is what a joke why would I
[1:08:26] ever do that until one time I heard that
[1:08:29] God sent a prophet and I thought if God
[1:08:31] sent a prophet then he must have a word
[1:08:34] in his mouth for someone and because of
[1:08:37] that I took a look I had to say wow
[1:08:40] maybe that's someone is me what does he
[1:08:42] say what is the word of that Prophet
[1:08:45] because I want to know if God sent a
[1:08:47] prophet what did he say and you know
[1:08:49] what he said he said there's been
[1:08:51] churches and churches and brides and
[1:08:54] Brides but there's got to be one there
[1:08:58] has to come one oh my brother bradam he
[1:09:02] says this is just uh for free I don't
[1:09:04] know if you want to bring it up he says
[1:09:05] there has been churches churches Brides
[1:09:08] brides churches Brides brides just type
[1:09:12] in Brides brides I'm sure it'll come up
[1:09:14] but he says there's got to come one
[1:09:17] Hallelujah there's got to come a real
[1:09:20] bride amen there must come one that's
[1:09:24] not only got the mechanics but the
[1:09:27] Dynamics of it makes that church live
[1:09:30] move in the power of his resurrection am
[1:09:33] until we come to that place until we
[1:09:35] find that place what good does it do to
[1:09:38] polish the
[1:09:39] hubs right what good does it do to go
[1:09:42] get a new suit of clothes and come to
[1:09:43] church and present ourselves one with
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:46] other if we're not living the dynamic
[1:09:49] power of Jesus Christ Our Children see a
[1:09:53] double life
[1:09:55] I'll guarantee you brothers and sisters
[1:09:57] if that's what we're doing what we're
[1:09:58] going to do is train our children that
[1:10:00] that's acceptable and they're going to
[1:10:01] do that and what's worse is they will
[1:10:03] come to the place where they will say
[1:10:05] there's nothing to that man that's a a
[1:10:07] shell why would I want to pretend to be
[1:10:09] a Christian yeah I might as well eat
[1:10:12] drink and be married cuz tomorrow I die
[1:10:15] all my buddies are going to the Stampede
[1:10:17] all my buddies are going out to the bar
[1:10:19] all my buddies are doing whatever it is
[1:10:21] my buddies are doing and why do you have
[1:10:23] buddies like that in the first place
[1:10:25] because the parents taught you that it
[1:10:26] was okay brothers and sisters it's not
[1:10:30] okay we need to fellowship with fellow
[1:10:33] Believers God bless you Carpenters it's
[1:10:36] good to see you I was wondering if you'd
[1:10:37] make
[1:10:39] it brother randam says until we come to
[1:10:43] that
[1:10:44] place until we find that place what good
[1:10:47] does it do to polish the hubs what good
[1:10:49] does it do to give her a facelift or a
[1:10:51] simonized job when there's no Dynamics
[1:10:54] in it
[1:10:56] I had a friend one time who had a car
[1:10:58] when we were young and I I I guess now I
[1:11:01] can see it but at the time I could never
[1:11:03] understand and he had this car and all
[1:11:04] he wanted to do was polish it he we were
[1:11:06] too young to drive his parents let him
[1:11:08] Park this car in the backyard and alls
[1:11:10] he wanted to do is worship this car he
[1:11:12] wanted to go and sit in this car and he
[1:11:14] wanted to look at this car and he wanted
[1:11:16] to polish this car and it didn't run but
[1:11:19] that's all he wanted to do was I I I was
[1:11:21] like goodness isn't there more to life
[1:11:24] than cars
[1:11:26] what's wrong with this what good does it
[1:11:29] do to polish it up if you can't drive it
[1:11:32] maybe one day maybe one day brothers and
[1:11:35] sisters what if you die today you'll
[1:11:38] never get to drive the
[1:11:39] car but I want to say if you are that
[1:11:42] car get the Dynamics in it because if
[1:11:45] you die today at least you know you're
[1:11:47] going to the great I was going to say
[1:11:50] Garage in the sky but that's not
[1:11:52] right no matter how much the mechanics
[1:11:55] proved to be right there's got to be a
[1:11:57] Dynamics to make it
[1:12:02] work and you know I I just think this is
[1:12:04] so beautiful that's what he proved right
[1:12:07] that's what Jesus Christ proved amen
[1:12:10] that's what he proved when he came to
[1:12:11] earth when he lived on earth when he
[1:12:15] taught on earth when he broke bread and
[1:12:17] ate as a man when he just lived amongst
[1:12:19] fellow men and did what the Believers
[1:12:22] did in those days went fishing yeah hung
[1:12:26] out did the stuff they had church but
[1:12:29] what he did was he
[1:12:31] proved he proved that there had to be a
[1:12:33] dynamic power that comes into the
[1:12:36] mechanics and brother Ram says that's
[1:12:38] what Easter proved he wasn't only the
[1:12:41] word now this is where we're going to
[1:12:43] get into our our our lesson how we're
[1:12:45] going to grab the ball and push a little
[1:12:46] forward today he wasn't only the
[1:12:49] word but he was God himself amen amen
[1:12:53] the Dynamics in
[1:12:55] the
[1:12:57] word that made the body of
[1:13:00] Christ cold stiff and dead in the
[1:13:03] grave Shake into life and rise again and
[1:13:07] roll away the stone I am he that was
[1:13:10] dead so dead Till The Sun said he was
[1:13:14] dead we know that it went dark right the
[1:13:17] moon said that he was dead the Stars
[1:13:19] said he was dead all nature said he was
[1:13:21] dead and now the whole world has to
[1:13:24] recognize that he's alive
[1:13:27] again how is the whole world going to
[1:13:30] recognize that he's alive
[1:13:32] again the
[1:13:35] televangelists all the different great
[1:13:38] evangelists just because he died at
[1:13:41] Calvary no because there's a
[1:13:43] resurrection and that Resurrection is
[1:13:45] deep inside that Resurrection is in the
[1:13:48] heart of the believer amen but when that
[1:13:51] happens it's not a different life from
[1:13:53] his word no no no
[1:13:55] it's got to be exactly the fruit of the
[1:13:58] spirit we have shortcomings in our lives
[1:14:01] we always will fight this flesh but this
[1:14:03] flesh will always yield to the word of
[1:14:05] God always when it's his Dynamic power
[1:14:09] living in us and we know that Dynamic
[1:14:11] power brothers and sisters I want to
[1:14:12] make it plain as plain as plain it's
[1:14:14] it's the literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:14:16] which is the Holy Ghost amen that's why
[1:14:18] we say the Holy Ghost that's the dynamic
[1:14:20] power in the car that's the dynamic
[1:14:22] power in the life of the believer we
[1:14:24] know that this life the things that we
[1:14:26] contend with here all of the conditions
[1:14:28] of soft living all of the good foods
[1:14:31] that we can eat all the process foods
[1:14:33] that we could eat all the things that
[1:14:34] destroy these bodies they'll put us in
[1:14:36] the grave but that Dynamic power will
[1:14:38] get us out of the
[1:14:40] grave and as he being the groom the
[1:14:44] bride has to come
[1:14:45] forth cuz it's part of him thank you
[1:14:48] Lord and it can only be the
[1:14:50] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:14:54] the revelation
[1:14:56] any others has spoke of the Bride it can
[1:14:59] only manifest if it does something
[1:15:01] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:15:05] bride I think that's so powerful it's so
[1:15:08] good if it does something different from
[1:15:10] the groom it isn't the bride because she
[1:15:14] is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:15:17] life of his life power of his power she
[1:15:20] is
[1:15:21] him the Bride of Jesus Christ when we're
[1:15:24] talking the bride of Jesus Christ we're
[1:15:25] not just talking about an exclusive
[1:15:27] group of people even though they are
[1:15:29] we're not just talking about people who
[1:15:31] have great Revelation even though they
[1:15:33] do we're talking about the literal
[1:15:36] manifestation of Jesus
[1:15:38] Christ right that's powerful
[1:15:44] yeah Prophet said it yes even more than
[1:15:47] that I would say God said it through the
[1:15:49] prophet yes she is flesh of his flesh
[1:15:53] bone of his bone like of his life power
[1:15:56] of his power she is him it's beautiful
[1:15:59] how brother bradam brings this he talks
[1:16:01] about the the spoken word being the
[1:16:03] Original Seed and how every single seed
[1:16:05] will bring forth after its own kind and
[1:16:08] we know that comes right out of Genesis
[1:16:10] right out of the the way God created
[1:16:12] everything in the earth to happen and
[1:16:15] it's so neat because brother bradam he
[1:16:17] says if you take an apple seed just a
[1:16:19] tiny little seed if you take that apple
[1:16:21] seed and look at it every single Apple
[1:16:23] that will ever grow on the tree that can
[1:16:26] come forth from that seed is already
[1:16:28] right there in that little seed it's so
[1:16:30] beautiful and and it can't bring forth
[1:16:33] anything else except for apples because
[1:16:36] it's an apple seed and that's why it's
[1:16:38] so important to get people to Jesus
[1:16:39] Christ because if we get people to a
[1:16:41] denominational perspective of the
[1:16:43] message of the hour sorry to say it that
[1:16:45] way but it's true if we get people to a
[1:16:47] denominational perspective of the
[1:16:49] message of the hour what's going to
[1:16:51] happen is they're going to bring forth a
[1:16:52] life and it's going to be the same thing
[1:16:55] people are going to think it's okay to
[1:16:57] live this way what's going to happen is
[1:16:58] we're going to live a stunted life
[1:17:00] spiritually speaking we're going to live
[1:17:01] a thousand miles below our
[1:17:04] privilege and we don't want to do that
[1:17:07] we want to see people get all the way
[1:17:08] into Jesus Christ to see that Dynamic
[1:17:10] power of Jesus Christ because when our
[1:17:12] children get sick somebody needs to pray
[1:17:14] for them there's times brothers and
[1:17:17] sisters where we don't have the time to
[1:17:19] call the pastor or the deacons or or our
[1:17:21] brother or our sister to pray for the
[1:17:23] situation
[1:17:25] we need to fall on our knees and cry out
[1:17:26] to God right now Lord we need you now
[1:17:30] that's right and you know what when that
[1:17:32] Dynamic power is there he's just right
[1:17:35] there too because he is that Dynamic
[1:17:37] power and it's beautiful because when
[1:17:40] that Dynamic power speaks we read it on
[1:17:42] Wednesday when that Dynamic power speaks
[1:17:45] though through the lips of a mortal
[1:17:46] human that's the same as deity
[1:17:49] speaking when we have his holy spirit
[1:17:51] yeah when we have his holy ghost living
[1:17:54] through us then she is flesh of his
[1:17:56] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[1:17:59] power of his power she is
[1:18:02] him that is so powerful I I think that's
[1:18:06] just
[1:18:07] amazing talking about our scripture
[1:18:09] today the centurion's faith we stopped
[1:18:13] uh we stopped reading
[1:18:20] here we stopped reading at verse 7even
[1:18:25] wherefore neither this is Luke 7: 7
[1:18:28] wherefore neither thought I myself
[1:18:30] worthy to come unto thee but say in a
[1:18:33] word and my servant shall be healed for
[1:18:37] I also am a man set under Authority
[1:18:41] having under me soldiers and I say unto
[1:18:44] one go and he goeth and to another come
[1:18:48] and he cometh and to my servant do this
[1:18:51] and he doeth it and when Jesus heard
[1:18:53] these things he marveled at him and
[1:18:55] turned him about and said unto the
[1:18:59] people that followed him I say unto you
[1:19:02] I have not found so great faith no not
[1:19:05] in
[1:19:07] Israel that
[1:19:10] powerful he had a
[1:19:12] revelation he understood a man of
[1:19:16] authority and brothers and sisters I
[1:19:18] want to say today as the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:21] Christen we have the ability to call
[1:19:24] upon on that man of authority and all
[1:19:27] creation has to obey his voice am but
[1:19:30] we're not going to ask outside of what
[1:19:32] his will is right if we do we won't see
[1:19:35] an answer the way we want it but when we
[1:19:38] do ask according to his will look out
[1:19:41] all heavens and earth will move for your
[1:19:44] word his word through you to come to
[1:19:47] pass you know out out of the the
[1:19:50] junction of time in 1956
[1:19:56] I I just think it's so beautiful this
[1:19:57] story here of the centurion's faith we
[1:19:59] know brother Bram talks about the
[1:20:01] Centurion being a type of the
[1:20:03] Gentile and many times in many of the
[1:20:06] the messages he compares the Centurion
[1:20:08] to gyrus where where gyrus needed a
[1:20:12] healing for his daughter and uh the
[1:20:14] Centurion needed the healing for his
[1:20:16] servant and and gyrus desired the laying
[1:20:19] on of hands but the Centurion said no
[1:20:22] you don't have to touch anybody you
[1:20:23] don't even have to come I and I'm not
[1:20:25] worthy for you to come under my roof all
[1:20:27] you need to do is just speak the word
[1:20:30] and at Thy word we could see a healing
[1:20:32] come to pass amen out of the junction of
[1:20:35] time brother Bram says as a gos brother
[1:20:37] as a gospel preacher this morning I
[1:20:40] believe that the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:20:42] through mortal lips today of anointed
[1:20:45] ministers are speaking the time has come
[1:20:49] time is here and omnipotence is
[1:20:53] answering the miraculous is taking place
[1:20:56] has to we're at the junction but how can
[1:20:59] this miraculous take place outside of
[1:21:02] that Dynamic power of the real Holy
[1:21:04] Ghost living out through
[1:21:07] us and there when he done all the
[1:21:11] miraculous while
[1:21:13] omnipotence God manifested In the
[1:21:17] Flesh speak the word Lord and my servant
[1:21:20] will heal my servant will be will live
[1:21:23] he knew amen that Roman Centurion knowed
[1:21:28] he was a man under Authority that he
[1:21:31] knowed that whatever was under him had
[1:21:34] whatever he said they had to do it he
[1:21:37] said I come to say to this man come and
[1:21:39] he comes and that man go and he goes
[1:21:42] said I'm under Authority and everything
[1:21:45] under my authority obeys me and Lord I'm
[1:21:49] not worthy that you come in my house
[1:21:52] just speak the word hallelujah he know
[1:21:55] that was
[1:21:56] omnipotence brothers and sisters he was
[1:21:59] standing in the flesh there yeah but
[1:22:03] where is he
[1:22:05] today is he in those seats at the back
[1:22:07] over there is he in the seats at the
[1:22:10] front here the word of God says where
[1:22:13] two or three are gathered together in
[1:22:15] his name that he's there it doesn't mean
[1:22:18] that he's here just in a spirit form
[1:22:20] floating around the room it means that
[1:22:23] Dynamic power is is in the heart of the
[1:22:26] believer so I want to say to you today
[1:22:29] if you've got the holy ghost in your
[1:22:30] life you have Jesus Christ in your
[1:22:36] seat if you don't have the Holy Ghost in
[1:22:39] your life desire to get the Holy Ghost
[1:22:41] in your
[1:22:42] life right and you will have
[1:22:46] omnipotence he know when omnipotent
[1:22:49] smoke miraculous would take place oh my
[1:22:55] oh
[1:22:57] my we serve a mighty God brothers and
[1:22:59] sisters and he wants to show his love he
[1:23:02] wants to show his life in our lives
[1:23:06] yes we don't need to be afraid we don't
[1:23:10] need to be worried the devil is going to
[1:23:12] be right there on your shoulders saying
[1:23:14] don't say it you'll have an inspiration
[1:23:16] in your heart to say something with your
[1:23:18] lips to speak something into existence
[1:23:21] to speak a word but the devil will be
[1:23:23] right there saying don't say it and you
[1:23:26] know you can really notice it when it
[1:23:28] comes time to worship I'm not judging
[1:23:30] anyone because I've experienced it
[1:23:32] there's times in my life where I would
[1:23:33] come to a worship service to
[1:23:35] church oh my and I'd have something
[1:23:38] maybe we'd have a fight on the way to
[1:23:39] church not very
[1:23:42] often but sometimes it's tough getting
[1:23:44] out the door when you've got children
[1:23:46] and you want to be on time you want to
[1:23:49] actually get it to church there's times
[1:23:51] where the pressure comes but you know
[1:23:53] what the the the most obvious time is
[1:23:55] when you come to church and you just
[1:23:56] don't have the desire to worship why
[1:23:58] don't you have the desire to lift your
[1:23:59] hands and worship I'll tell you why
[1:24:03] because the devil is stopping
[1:24:05] you the devil is stopping you because
[1:24:08] that's the one thing that God wor
[1:24:10] desires is worship he is an object of
[1:24:13] worship and if we don't worship Him the
[1:24:16] rocks will immediately cry out to him
[1:24:19] that's the word of God that's where we
[1:24:21] need to understand his will if you want
[1:24:23] to see blessing in your life brothers
[1:24:25] and sisters when you don't have that
[1:24:27] desire to worship fight through it fight
[1:24:30] through it do do something outrageous
[1:24:32] and raise your hands unto him and say
[1:24:34] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:24:37] I desire to Worship You Lord I don't
[1:24:39] care about the song leader I don't care
[1:24:41] about the musicians I don't care about
[1:24:43] anything else except for you Lord and
[1:24:46] give him your very best worship the word
[1:24:48] of God says to make a Joyful Noise it
[1:24:51] doesn't say to have perfect pitch to be
[1:24:53] able to do everything according to the
[1:24:55] way human beings think they
[1:24:57] should give God something to honor and
[1:25:01] see if he won't come around and bless
[1:25:05] you and you know what it might not be a
[1:25:07] blessing like you think it's always
[1:25:09] going to be a little bit different
[1:25:11] sometimes it's exactly the way you think
[1:25:12] but other times it's totally
[1:25:15] different that's the God we
[1:25:17] serve amen but if you have that that
[1:25:20] that thing where you just feel I just
[1:25:23] don't want to worship I just I'm tired
[1:25:25] this morning or I'm frustrated this
[1:25:26] morning or whatever this morning I don't
[1:25:29] want to worship that's the
[1:25:31] devil learn to identify him and kick him
[1:25:34] out brothers and sisters if we want more
[1:25:36] from God there's more from God to be had
[1:25:39] the reason we want more is because
[1:25:40] there's more where there's a deep
[1:25:42] calling there's a deep to respond and he
[1:25:45] wants to respond he wants to
[1:25:49] respond out of the spoken word is the
[1:25:51] Original Seed brother Brown I'm talking
[1:25:53] about the pyramid he talks about how the
[1:25:55] pyramid the way it was built and he says
[1:25:58] in this message that Enoch built it when
[1:26:00] Enoch built this pyramid he says that
[1:26:02] when he built this pyramid he built
[1:26:04] those blocks so close together you can't
[1:26:06] even fit a razor blade between them
[1:26:09] there's no mortar there's no mortar
[1:26:11] holding the pyramid together there's
[1:26:13] there's rocks that are cut out so
[1:26:15] Precision so perfectly and they're not
[1:26:17] just cut out straight Square rocks
[1:26:20] they're cut out with I don't know what
[1:26:22] you call them pivot Points or hinge
[1:26:24] points points different different shapes
[1:26:26] in the Rocks geometrical shapes to hold
[1:26:28] them together to lock them together so
[1:26:30] that if this world shakes they will stay
[1:26:33] in place and we know the pyramids are
[1:26:35] pretty old they've been there in that
[1:26:36] shape for a long time brother Ram he
[1:26:38] says blend with this word in that
[1:26:41] pyramid you can take a razor blade and
[1:26:43] you can't run between them
[1:26:46] rocks where the mortar was it's so fitly
[1:26:50] put together they said Solomon's Temple
[1:26:52] was the same see God is taking the elect
[1:26:55] out of the Pentecostal
[1:26:57] church that hybrid pulling it out why is
[1:27:02] it hybrid Pentecostal church we might
[1:27:04] ask that question I think it's good
[1:27:06] maybe we'll just talk about that a
[1:27:07] little bit why is the Pentecostal Church
[1:27:09] hybrid because what they did was they
[1:27:12] said the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost of having the holy ghost in your
[1:27:15] life is being able to speak in tongues
[1:27:17] period yeah come on can you imagine
[1:27:20] that's it that's all it was but that's
[1:27:22] what causes it to be hybrid we don't
[1:27:24] want to take the word of God and say a
[1:27:27] period behind any one of the words am we
[1:27:30] want to say be it unto me according to
[1:27:32] Thy word but the Pentecostal Church
[1:27:34] decided to actually just just like many
[1:27:37] other churches this is the way it is
[1:27:39] this is the way we saw God move in our
[1:27:41] midst and we're going to say that this
[1:27:42] is what we're going to do and this is
[1:27:43] the way we're going to roll forwards now
[1:27:45] as a group and you know what it can
[1:27:47] actually happen in a congregation in a
[1:27:49] church brothers and sisters we could see
[1:27:51] something fantastic something
[1:27:53] significant happen in our lives a real
[1:27:56] blessing from God maybe a healing
[1:27:58] happens maybe somebody gets saved maybe
[1:28:00] they do a Victory lap in the church
[1:28:02] during a service and and and we start to
[1:28:04] think well what was the song We sang how
[1:28:06] did we create that environment what was
[1:28:08] it that that caused that atmosphere
[1:28:10] because we want to do that again and
[1:28:11] then we start to do that what that's
[1:28:13] doing is hybridizing we're actually
[1:28:16] saying that now we can manipulate the
[1:28:18] way God's going to do things we can't do
[1:28:19] that what we need to do is humble
[1:28:21] ourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[1:28:23] He will Lift us up so long as we're
[1:28:26] willing to do that he will lift us
[1:28:29] up but God is taking the elect out of
[1:28:32] that Pentecostal
[1:28:34] church that hybrid pulling it out and
[1:28:36] finishing up the
[1:28:39] word I love how he says this God's doing
[1:28:42] it brothers and sisters this is the
[1:28:44] thread that's probably going to weave in
[1:28:45] and out through the whole thing today
[1:28:47] God's doing it we we said it on
[1:28:49] Wednesday God is doing this we don't
[1:28:52] need to try and do this the only thing
[1:28:54] we need to do is humble ourselves in the
[1:28:56] sight of the Lord how do we do that
[1:28:58] we've said it before I'll continually
[1:29:00] say it brothers and sisters humble
[1:29:01] ourselves one to another amen cuz where
[1:29:03] is the Lord amen the Lord isn't at this
[1:29:06] altar even though sometimes he is
[1:29:09] sometimes we need to actually take a
[1:29:11] step forward by faith and come to the
[1:29:12] Altar and and and ask for prayer I'm not
[1:29:15] saying don't do that I I would never say
[1:29:18] don't do that but what I am saying is
[1:29:20] this building does not contain God your
[1:29:22] heart is what contains God he lives in
[1:29:25] the human heart that Temple not made
[1:29:27] with hands is where you will find
[1:29:33] God God is taking the elect out of the
[1:29:35] Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling
[1:29:37] it out and finishing up the word and
[1:29:39] it's got to be so close until the word
[1:29:41] itself will blend with this word with
[1:29:45] this word I think it's so beautiful the
[1:29:48] word itself will blend with this word
[1:29:51] with the message of the hour the message
[1:29:53] of the hour being lived out in our lives
[1:29:55] will blend so much with the word that it
[1:29:57] will blend with this word this word that
[1:30:00] he's speaking that he's bringing and
[1:30:02] telling the world it will blend with
[1:30:05] this word there Comes The Headstone
[1:30:08] crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace The
[1:30:12] Headstone Amen brother bradam talks
[1:30:14] about The Headstone The Headstone comes
[1:30:17] down and it becomes one yes yeah we've
[1:30:20] said it in the past many times we have
[1:30:21] the diagram it shows the stature of the
[1:30:23] perfect man and then it has the flat
[1:30:24] spot and then it says the Holy Ghost
[1:30:26] then it has another pyramid on top of it
[1:30:28] what he's speaking of right here
[1:30:29] brothers and sisters is it becoming one
[1:30:32] pyramid one pyramid nothing between
[1:30:36] separating any of it it's all one that
[1:30:39] is exactly where we're heading and
[1:30:41] that's exactly what's taking place today
[1:30:44] even here in this service yeah brother
[1:30:47] Bram goes on to say in the spoken words
[1:30:48] The Original Seed Ministry just exactly
[1:30:50] like that word he says here you are like
[1:30:54] this see on there see how it way down
[1:30:58] way wide down here and it keeps getting
[1:31:01] closer and closer and closer the
[1:31:03] ministry after a while here come here's
[1:31:07] Luther justification Justified here come
[1:31:09] Wesley Sanctified bunch here come
[1:31:12] Pentecostal restoration of the gifts now
[1:31:14] God is taking from there honing out a
[1:31:17] bunch to make a Ministry just exactly
[1:31:21] like that word there because it's got to
[1:31:24] fit with that word there's the bride
[1:31:27] take her up I think it's beautiful
[1:31:29] because I'm going to go back to the
[1:31:31] fruit of the spirit brothers and sisters
[1:31:32] how do we know when we're actually
[1:31:34] fitting with the word of God how does
[1:31:37] that work in our lives how do we see the
[1:31:39] representation we can quote the Bible we
[1:31:41] know the scripture we know the message
[1:31:43] we can quote the quotes we go to church
[1:31:46] we have service in the church we have a
[1:31:48] wonderful life that we live we're
[1:31:50] dedicated but do we have that fruit
[1:31:52] hanging on our branches brothers and
[1:31:54] sisters if it's not hanging on our
[1:31:55] branches then we haven't made it yet to
[1:31:57] that place where the word is becoming
[1:31:59] the word in our lives that Dynamic power
[1:32:03] has not taken hold yet it's not too late
[1:32:06] am all we need to do is give him a
[1:32:08] little bit of
[1:32:09] worship if you want a tree to grow you
[1:32:11] got to water it and we know that
[1:32:14] watering the word causes a life to come
[1:32:19] forward here come Pentecostal
[1:32:21] restoration of the gifts now God is
[1:32:23] taking from there honing out a bunch to
[1:32:25] make a Ministry just exactly like that
[1:32:29] word there because it's got to fit with
[1:32:31] the word there's the bride take her up I
[1:32:36] think it's such a wonderful thing
[1:32:38] there's the bride fit exactly with the
[1:32:41] word and how does it fit with the word
[1:32:44] like we said it has to be the fruit of
[1:32:46] the spirit in our lives amen amen I say
[1:32:49] Lord help
[1:32:50] me I get
[1:32:52] angry you know what there's times where
[1:32:54] I've actually wanted to be
[1:32:56] vengeful malice in my life you know what
[1:33:00] that's not the fruit of the spirit right
[1:33:02] and you know the devil will come around
[1:33:03] and say that's you and you have to say
[1:33:06] no no no that's not me that's you that's
[1:33:09] not me that's you once upon a time I I I
[1:33:11] think that was me before I had the
[1:33:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's going
[1:33:15] to he doesn't believe we've got the
[1:33:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost he didn't
[1:33:18] believe that Jesus was Jesus he didn't
[1:33:20] believe that Jesus was almighty God
[1:33:23] that's why he kept coming at him and
[1:33:25] that's why he put him on a cross because
[1:33:27] had he known that he was The Lord Of
[1:33:29] Glory what does the word say they never
[1:33:32] would have crucified the Lord Of
[1:33:34] Glory just like him Jesus manifesting
[1:33:39] God you manifesting God he doesn't
[1:33:43] believe it one bit he's going to come
[1:33:44] around and try and remind you about
[1:33:46] anger he's going to come around and try
[1:33:47] and remind you about all these other
[1:33:49] things these problems these issues that
[1:33:51] we had in our former lives
[1:33:54] just tell the devil they're his give
[1:33:56] them back to him rebuke him in the name
[1:33:59] of Jesus Christ there's one thing that
[1:34:00] he can't stand brothers and sisters and
[1:34:02] that's the name of Jesus
[1:34:04] Christ just remind him the name of Jesus
[1:34:09] Christ
[1:34:11] amen you know I just think it was such a
[1:34:13] beautiful lesson brother Toby and the
[1:34:16] Sunday School lesson that he brought
[1:34:18] even had a brother say you know you
[1:34:19] should give him a a a second sermon on
[1:34:22] that because it was so good and I think
[1:34:24] Lord willing will definitely do that but
[1:34:26] you know there's lots of little nuggets
[1:34:28] that I got out of it but one I wanted to
[1:34:29] bring today is is simply this as married
[1:34:34] folks because we're talking about the
[1:34:35] invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ we're talking about the Heavenly
[1:34:39] bridegroom and the Earthly bride we're
[1:34:41] talking about the two becoming one and
[1:34:44] and brother Toby said it so masterfully
[1:34:46] he even quoted it that the
[1:34:48] representation on Earth our marriage
[1:34:52] between husband and wife is an exact
[1:34:54] reflection of our relationship with our
[1:34:57] Heavenly bridegroom he instituted
[1:34:59] marriage to demonstrate that there will
[1:35:02] be a union so when we live our lives in
[1:35:06] a marriage here on Earth does it reflect
[1:35:09] the image that we desire to have with
[1:35:11] our heavenly father and if it doesn't
[1:35:15] why doesn't it I think it's just a a a
[1:35:18] magnificent thought and I'll tell you
[1:35:20] it's caused me to step back and
[1:35:22] recalibrate all that I've thought about
[1:35:24] in terms of marriage it's wonderful to
[1:35:27] be married to have a wife to have a
[1:35:28] bride but how do I want my heavenly
[1:35:32] bridegroom to treat me as a bride come
[1:35:36] on do I treat my bride the way that I
[1:35:41] desire to have him treat
[1:35:43] me help us Lord I I I had to take a step
[1:35:48] back I actually had to take a stagger
[1:35:50] back and say Lord have
[1:35:52] mercy because I I don't think I think
[1:35:55] about my wife the way that you think
[1:35:57] about me according to Jeremiah chapter
[1:35:59] 29 I know the thoughts that I think
[1:36:01] towards you hey thoughts of love and
[1:36:05] peace and joy there's times in my life
[1:36:08] where I didn't line up with the word of
[1:36:10] God in the way that I thought about my
[1:36:12] wife and now there's lots of things that
[1:36:14] got in the way I I I let work get in the
[1:36:18] way I let my mismanagement of time get
[1:36:21] in the way I let all these different
[1:36:24] things happen in my life God never did
[1:36:26] it to me and you know what the devil
[1:36:28] will only do what you allow him to do he
[1:36:31] doesn't come around sometimes we do have
[1:36:34] cataclysmic circumstances that God
[1:36:36] allows they don't happen by accident God
[1:36:39] allows them so that he can actually
[1:36:41] bring something out in our lives but you
[1:36:43] know what brother Toby said was
[1:36:45] masterful I thought just a simple
[1:36:47] question can we go to our spouse and say
[1:36:49] to her or to him are you happy
[1:36:54] are you happy in this marriage
[1:36:56] honey and you better step back you
[1:36:59] better brace because they might say not
[1:37:03] really but why are we in it if we can't
[1:37:06] be honest
[1:37:08] right amen and why would we not want to
[1:37:12] have our spouse happy we want we want we
[1:37:16] want to be happy we want him to make
[1:37:18] sure that we're happy we want him to
[1:37:20] bless our bank account we want him to
[1:37:22] bless our bodies with good health we
[1:37:23] want him to bless us with good preaching
[1:37:25] we want him to bless our children we
[1:37:27] want we want we want what about her yeah
[1:37:33] what about him what about our spouse are
[1:37:37] we willing to give everything everything
[1:37:39] that we've got for their happiness
[1:37:42] because I'll say this to the young
[1:37:43] people if you're thinking about getting
[1:37:45] married don't you dare think about
[1:37:46] getting married unless you're willing to
[1:37:48] give everything you've got for their
[1:37:51] happiness amen
[1:37:54] and if we're in a position where we're
[1:37:55] not doing that I want to say today by
[1:37:57] the word of God take a step backwards
[1:38:00] and recalibrate your
[1:38:02] thinking you want to have a good
[1:38:03] marriage ask her ask him are you happy
[1:38:08] and if they're not why
[1:38:10] not maybe you can actually make it
[1:38:13] better maybe you could help the
[1:38:16] situation but the trouble is we got to
[1:38:18] look in the mirror we got to be willing
[1:38:20] to take a long look in the mirror and if
[1:38:23] we're seeing anything other than the
[1:38:24] word of God living out through our lives
[1:38:27] then maybe we're looking in the wrong
[1:38:29] mirror maybe we need to look in the
[1:38:31] mirror of the
[1:38:32] word is everything okay yeah okay I just
[1:38:37] want to make sure looked like something
[1:38:38] maybe wasn't we've got to make sure that
[1:38:41] we know our spouses are happy if our
[1:38:43] spouses aren't happy Our Lives aren't
[1:38:45] going to be happy and you know what our
[1:38:47] children aren't going to be happy and
[1:38:49] sometimes we can drag that unhappy with
[1:38:51] us everywhere we go and the funny thing
[1:38:53] is as we do when we're not happy and the
[1:38:55] other people you don't have to say a
[1:38:56] word other people see it other people
[1:38:58] feel it other people know it right it's
[1:39:01] the way it is we can't hide it we think
[1:39:03] we're hiding it but everyone can see it
[1:39:05] you know it's like looking in the mirror
[1:39:07] we want to make sure we're looking in
[1:39:08] the right mirror though brothers and
[1:39:09] sisters it's got to be the mirror of the
[1:39:11] word amen you know out of the spoken
[1:39:14] word is the Original
[1:39:16] Seed but the bromy says now Christ was
[1:39:19] manifest for a
[1:39:21] purpose Christ was manif to destroy the
[1:39:24] works of the devil he says you believe
[1:39:27] that now I can't explain all this I'm
[1:39:30] just going to go through it just quickly
[1:39:33] now hit the high place so you won't stay
[1:39:36] too long Christ was manifest to destroy
[1:39:38] the works of the devil is that right
[1:39:40] amen you all believe that amen what was
[1:39:44] he God's word which destroys the works
[1:39:48] of the hybrid the devil because we know
[1:39:52] that the devil is a hybrid he can't
[1:39:53] create the only thing he can do is
[1:39:55] hybridize the only thing that he can do
[1:39:57] is manipulate the only thing that he can
[1:39:58] do is is hybridize whatever is going on
[1:40:02] he can only manipulate what's happening
[1:40:04] he is not a
[1:40:05] Creator he says what was he he was God's
[1:40:08] word which destroys the works of the
[1:40:11] hybrid devil is that right he was done
[1:40:14] to do that he was born to be that to
[1:40:17] destroy the works of the
[1:40:20] devil now his body is to do the the
[1:40:24] same where's his
[1:40:29] body now his body is to do the same
[1:40:32] because the body is the head and the
[1:40:35] body is
[1:40:37] together that's why you don't have a
[1:40:39] husband here and a wife here and she's
[1:40:42] going and doing her thing and he's going
[1:40:44] and doing his thing and they call
[1:40:45] themselves married husbands and wives it
[1:40:48] doesn't work that way the husbands and
[1:40:50] the wives are together as one working
[1:40:53] together for the same cause amen but
[1:40:55] when they're not it causes a problem in
[1:40:58] the
[1:41:00] body just like having a
[1:41:02] church just to say it plainly when you
[1:41:05] get people pulling one way and pulling
[1:41:07] another way it's not in unity if it's
[1:41:10] not in unity it's not one right if we
[1:41:14] want to see the power of God move in our
[1:41:16] services we've got to come together as
[1:41:18] one to be in one mind and one Accord and
[1:41:20] we know we don't want to have our own
[1:41:22] thoughts about it we want his thoughts
[1:41:24] about it his word says let this mind
[1:41:27] that was in Christ Jesus be also in
[1:41:32] you now his body is to do the same
[1:41:34] because the body is head and body is
[1:41:37] together that right if Christ is the
[1:41:39] head was the word his body has to be the
[1:41:42] same thing as his head was that right a
[1:41:45] church of the word born of the word
[1:41:49] virgin born from the word not
[1:41:52] denominational thou virgin born from the
[1:41:56] word and I know this is where people who
[1:41:58] are denominational who are parts of
[1:42:01] different denominations or maybe parts
[1:42:03] of churches who maybe are inter
[1:42:06] denominational uh churches that whatever
[1:42:09] when you get into having the the the the
[1:42:12] Apostles Creed and and and the nian
[1:42:15] Creed as part of what you believe as a
[1:42:18] church you you have the trinitarian
[1:42:20] doctrine whether you agree to it or not
[1:42:23] you are a part of the the United
[1:42:26] Federation of world churches you put
[1:42:29] yourself in that position because you
[1:42:31] don't might maybe see it but the elders
[1:42:33] have already signed the proclamation to
[1:42:36] join up to sign up with the other mother
[1:42:39] of Harlot the the main church we know
[1:42:42] that but the thing about it is we can
[1:42:45] find ourselves being a virgin to the
[1:42:48] word and the only way that's going to
[1:42:50] happen is to just say be it unto me
[1:42:52] according to the word I'm not interested
[1:42:54] in having a hybrid religion I'm not
[1:42:57] interested in saying that I'm affiliated
[1:42:59] with anybody but you know the folks that
[1:43:00] we just describe they'll say well now
[1:43:02] you're getting crazy because you're not
[1:43:04] willing to be Affiliated if you're not
[1:43:06] affiliated with everyone you're going to
[1:43:07] say that your Sovereign assembly your
[1:43:09] assembly is Sovereign then then you're
[1:43:12] you're a wildc card you're you're
[1:43:15] Fanatics right and yes indeed we are yes
[1:43:19] it's amazing because we truly are coming
[1:43:21] to that place where we are the Fanatics
[1:43:24] amen a church called out from a church a
[1:43:27] church of the word born of the word
[1:43:30] virgin born from the word not
[1:43:34] denominational now virgin born from the
[1:43:37] word I think that's so beautiful because
[1:43:40] every seed will bring forth after its
[1:43:42] own kind this is the spoken word is the
[1:43:44] Original Seed that's what brother bradam
[1:43:46] is preaching from here that's what we're
[1:43:49] excuse me diving into here every seed
[1:43:51] will bring forth after his own kind and
[1:43:54] it has to be a church of the word and if
[1:43:57] it's not a church of the word we're
[1:43:59] going to bring forth a hybrid church and
[1:44:01] we'll just continue to have those hybrid
[1:44:04] members hybrid Believers and you know we
[1:44:07] can make different exceptions and say
[1:44:09] we'll do this and we'll do that there's
[1:44:10] Liberties that happen and before long
[1:44:12] you'll have exploding assembly you'll
[1:44:15] have lots of money it'll be flush with
[1:44:17] cash and everything will be fine and you
[1:44:19] know what you will have left the word
[1:44:22] yeah we're not interested in that right
[1:44:24] I personally would just like brother
[1:44:26] bradam said would rather have fewer
[1:44:28] members that really believe the word of
[1:44:31] God to see the dynamic power of God
[1:44:33] moving in our services when we know the
[1:44:35] Devil comes around and tries to take our
[1:44:37] children we can gather together and know
[1:44:39] there is a dynamic power of the Holy
[1:44:43] Ghost the only way it's going to happen
[1:44:45] is to be a virgin to the word and like
[1:44:47] we've said many times it's not a virgin
[1:44:49] in our flesh it's not a virgin Even in
[1:44:51] our our mind it's a virgin in our soul
[1:44:55] the only thing that we are interested in
[1:44:57] is the word of God
[1:45:00] Amen that's the only thing that we can
[1:45:02] take into our bodies is the word of God
[1:45:06] Amen brother bromy goes on to say in
[1:45:08] another paragraph here tell me where he
[1:45:10] ever said
[1:45:11] organize tell me where the head all say
[1:45:15] it's all right for women to cut their
[1:45:17] hair huh mention it it's not there tell
[1:45:21] me where the head ever said said these
[1:45:23] works I do but you shall not do them
[1:45:28] tell me that doesn't say it in the word
[1:45:30] of God does
[1:45:31] it tell me where it says in the word of
[1:45:34] God that you can have women
[1:45:36] preachers doesn't say that tell me in
[1:45:39] the word of God where it says you can
[1:45:40] have same-sex
[1:45:42] marriage it
[1:45:44] doesn't these are the days that we live
[1:45:46] in those things are condoned and and
[1:45:49] they're made to be all right but they're
[1:45:52] outside of the word of God so as soon as
[1:45:54] we step outside of the word of God what
[1:45:56] we have is a hybrid religion and at that
[1:45:59] point brothers and sisters anything
[1:46:03] goes it's not good but it's it's
[1:46:06] true mention it it's not there tell me
[1:46:10] where the head and we know the head is
[1:46:11] The Headstone crying Grace Grace unto it
[1:46:14] we know the head headstone is Jesus
[1:46:16] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:46:18] forever we know that Jesus Christ was
[1:46:20] God himself manifest in the flesh came
[1:46:23] down to the world condescended so that
[1:46:25] he could come and save all that were his
[1:46:28] but he says mention it's not there tell
[1:46:30] me where the head ever said these works
[1:46:32] I do but you shall not do them tell me
[1:46:37] that you know brother Bram in this day
[1:46:39] he was talking probably to people who
[1:46:41] were saying you know the days of
[1:46:42] Miracles are passed died with the
[1:46:44] apostles age you know when when the
[1:46:46] apostles were gone then all of those
[1:46:48] Works were gone there's people that want
[1:46:50] to believe that and and we know there's
[1:46:51] many people who actually who believe in
[1:46:54] a trinitarian doctrine that believe that
[1:46:56] these Works they will do also and and
[1:46:58] they get Mighty
[1:47:00] results but it doesn't matter because
[1:47:02] any gift can be impersonated is what the
[1:47:04] prophet said that's what God Said
[1:47:06] through the prophet Satan can come
[1:47:07] around and impersonate any gift whether
[1:47:10] it's healing whe whether it's whatever
[1:47:13] it is but the one thing Satan cannot
[1:47:15] take is the word of God
[1:47:17] Amen but the head said
[1:47:20] this you want to put the scripture down
[1:47:22] I'll give it to you John 14:12 The Works
[1:47:25] that I do shall you
[1:47:27] also that's his body is what he says to
[1:47:31] the church that's his body it's not just
[1:47:35] him and I I think this is what gets me
[1:47:37] so excited you might wonder why brother
[1:47:39] Barry do you get so shouting and and get
[1:47:40] so excited because this is not about
[1:47:43] William marryam brandom yeah this is not
[1:47:46] about just Jesus Christ this is about
[1:47:50] the Bride of Jesus Christ this is about
[1:47:53] the Living Word of Jesus Christ alive
[1:47:56] and well in the bride
[1:47:59] body it's about us today see now why I
[1:48:02] have been so zealous of the kind of seed
[1:48:04] that I planted for the body why he's so
[1:48:08] zealous speaking only the truth why he's
[1:48:11] so zealous that he would step away take
[1:48:14] his his his membership card for the
[1:48:16] Baptist Church and say you know what if
[1:48:18] you want to allow women preachers I see
[1:48:20] that Paul said you're not supposed to
[1:48:21] allow women preachers but if that's what
[1:48:23] you want to do then you can take my
[1:48:24] credentials I'm not interested at all
[1:48:27] I'm interested in following the word of
[1:48:29] God because I had an angel messenger
[1:48:31] come and reveal a message to me amen yes
[1:48:36] that just like John the Baptist your
[1:48:38] ministry will forun amen the second
[1:48:41] coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:42] Christ isn't it wonderful that he didn't
[1:48:45] actually give in that he did actually
[1:48:48] surrender himself see now I have been so
[1:48:51] zealous of the kind of seed that I
[1:48:52] planted for the body the rain is going
[1:48:54] to fall pretty soon now I mean the real
[1:48:56] rain what does he mean by the real rain
[1:48:59] I'm not going to say what he means I
[1:49:01] could only imagine that he means the
[1:49:02] former and the latter rain falling
[1:49:05] together all of the rain falling
[1:49:07] together the Holy Ghost we sing that
[1:49:09] song Holy Spirit rain
[1:49:12] down my I mean the real rain and it's
[1:49:16] got to have seed to fall on amen amen he
[1:49:21] says I hope to live to see it it do you
[1:49:23] understand now if you're wondering where
[1:49:26] I'm getting this from I'll I'll tell you
[1:49:28] it's out of the spoken word is the
[1:49:29] Original Seed I think it's up there the
[1:49:31] spoken word is the Original Seed but if
[1:49:33] you were to type in pick up your pen and
[1:49:35] write this is where brother bradam he
[1:49:38] says in this message the spoken word is
[1:49:40] the Original Seed and in the pergami and
[1:49:41] church age we've been studying in the
[1:49:43] exposition of the seven Church ages on
[1:49:44] Wednesday but in the spoken word of the
[1:49:46] original seat is the only other place he
[1:49:48] picked up he talked about this pick up
[1:49:50] your pen and write and when he talks
[1:49:52] about it he says the the Lord Holy
[1:49:55] Spirit inspired me to pick up my pen and
[1:49:56] write and so I picked up my pen to write
[1:49:58] but then he goes on a a really big long
[1:50:02] way around explaining this that she's a
[1:50:05] virgin to his word that there is a
[1:50:08] headstone that the two are one before he
[1:50:11] comes to the place where he talks about
[1:50:13] pick up your pen and write and and this
[1:50:15] is what the message actually is to the
[1:50:17] church he finds a scriptural
[1:50:19] identification about this pick up your
[1:50:21] pen and write right see now why I have
[1:50:24] been so zealous of the kind of seed that
[1:50:27] I planted for the body only going to be
[1:50:30] a word seed only according to the word
[1:50:32] no deviation whether everyone walks away
[1:50:35] from him whether he gets kicked out of
[1:50:37] every single assembly and we know that's
[1:50:38] what it happened this was
[1:50:41] 1962 3 years later there was not many
[1:50:44] people that wanted to have him around
[1:50:46] right great oh my but then when he
[1:50:49] passed away there was all kinds of
[1:50:50] people around oh yeah
[1:50:53] yeah but this is why he says it this is
[1:50:55] why I've been so zealous of the kind of
[1:50:57] seed that I planted for the body and I
[1:50:59] just can't help but zoom out and think
[1:51:01] was this William Mary and bradam saying
[1:51:03] these
[1:51:05] words we know that he's jealous over his
[1:51:08] bride with a Godly
[1:51:10] jealousy this is why I have been so
[1:51:13] zealous of the kind of seed that I
[1:51:14] planted for the body there was a time
[1:51:16] when I first started coming to church
[1:51:18] maybe for the first couple years that I
[1:51:19] thought man why why isn't there anything
[1:51:21] gentle it's always really deep and heavy
[1:51:24] it's it's it's it's mysterious and and
[1:51:28] and I know why now because I had a
[1:51:30] pastor that was on the word he knew that
[1:51:34] if he actually just milkfed the
[1:51:37] congregation that they would have an
[1:51:39] appetite just for milk and milk won't
[1:51:41] take you to a body change brothers and
[1:51:43] sisters it's got to be the revealed word
[1:51:47] amen it's got to be the right seed the
[1:51:50] rain is going to fall pretty soon now I
[1:51:51] mean the real R and it's got to have
[1:51:53] seed to fall on I hope I live to see it
[1:51:56] do you understand now it will be the
[1:51:59] Living
[1:52:00] Word as it was at the beginning the
[1:52:03] spoken word of God have his power for it
[1:52:07] is in him in his own body working his
[1:52:12] own way
[1:52:14] am that's why we don't have a will right
[1:52:17] we do but we humble ourselves we humble
[1:52:21] our will to his will amen the Believers
[1:52:24] always wants to subject themselves to
[1:52:26] the word of God and by doing so we
[1:52:29] actually humble ourselves we submit
[1:52:32] ourselves therefore unto God it gives us
[1:52:34] the ability to resist the devil then and
[1:52:37] he'll flee many times we hear that
[1:52:38] scripture just resist the devil and
[1:52:39] he'll flee we know we talked about it a
[1:52:42] long time ago if anybody has ever
[1:52:44] experienced it last summer we did we got
[1:52:46] close to a rattlesnake and and when you
[1:52:48] get close to a rattlesnake we know they
[1:52:50] can hurt you if they bite you but they
[1:52:51] make the rattle sound
[1:52:54] they're going to get you if you get
[1:52:55] close if you get too close he's going to
[1:52:57] strike you and and you know brother bam
[1:52:59] talks about it many times our
[1:53:00] Temptations can be like a rattlesnake
[1:53:02] they can be like a snake and we can just
[1:53:04] look at that snake we can hear it
[1:53:05] rattling and and and you know this snake
[1:53:08] is here and it's rattling maybe this
[1:53:10] stand here is a snake and it's rattling
[1:53:12] and it's coiled up and it's going to
[1:53:13] strike and I keep looking at it and I
[1:53:15] keep saying I rebuke you in the name of
[1:53:17] Jesus Christ maybe it's something in my
[1:53:19] life that I just don't seem to be able
[1:53:21] to get over maybe whatever it is our
[1:53:23] problems can be in life and we know
[1:53:25] they're wrong the Holy Spirit leads us
[1:53:26] and tells us I don't want to see you do
[1:53:28] that anymore but we keep looking at that
[1:53:29] problem and saying I rebuke you in the
[1:53:31] name of Jesus Christ I keep looking at
[1:53:33] that problem I rebuke you in the name of
[1:53:35] Jesus Christ brother Bram says if we
[1:53:37] keep doing that that's what we're going
[1:53:38] to keep doing yeah but if you just go
[1:53:41] like this amen and you don't look at it
[1:53:43] anymore eventually when you start
[1:53:45] walking far enough away you won't even
[1:53:47] hear the
[1:53:48] rattle right you don't even have to
[1:53:50] rebuke it
[1:53:52] look the other way amen do something
[1:53:56] different brother bradam says if we've
[1:53:58] got a selfish streak in us if it's all
[1:54:02] about me and I he says do the
[1:54:06] Opposites force yourself to do the
[1:54:09] Opposites maybe if we're super Frugal
[1:54:13] and tight with our money and we just
[1:54:15] can't help the poor we just can't ever
[1:54:18] jar loose with our money brother bradam
[1:54:20] says just do the opposit
[1:54:22] and see if God won't come on the scene
[1:54:25] if if if we've got whatever it is just
[1:54:28] do the opposite don't let Satan have the
[1:54:30] power in our lives yeah out of the
[1:54:33] spoken words The Original Seed brother
[1:54:35] bam says and when you become not your
[1:54:38] own dot dot dot that's really the goal
[1:54:41] that's really the the place that I want
[1:54:42] to get to today brothers and sisters we
[1:54:44] got
[1:54:45] more Lord willing but when you become
[1:54:49] not your
[1:54:51] own as a husband when you become not
[1:54:54] your own you're actually the
[1:54:58] families you're actually in charge of
[1:55:00] the entire family all the children to
[1:55:02] make sure that when they come to church
[1:55:04] they're equipped for church to make sure
[1:55:06] that your wife is able to put groceries
[1:55:08] in the fridge to make sure that
[1:55:10] everything is happening in order when
[1:55:13] when you become not your own all of your
[1:55:16] Ambitions and your dreams you're willing
[1:55:18] to set aside to say I'm willing to not
[1:55:21] become my own I want to be the slave for
[1:55:25] my family now some people might say wow
[1:55:27] that's pretty heavy I ain't never going
[1:55:29] to be the slave for my family well don't
[1:55:31] be see what happens see how it works for
[1:55:34] you but I say when you do that when your
[1:55:37] family can see you're willing to give
[1:55:38] everything that you've got guess what's
[1:55:41] going to happen you're going to see a
[1:55:42] different garden growing in your patch
[1:55:44] it's going to be a different life for
[1:55:46] you but as long as there any me or
[1:55:50] I it's a problem
[1:55:52] yeah but boy I'll tell you when you are
[1:55:55] are willing and when you're become not
[1:55:58] your own and God knows no and fornew by
[1:56:01] knowledge who would take this gift and
[1:56:04] who would use it in the right way those
[1:56:07] who have it are Vindicated by the word
[1:56:10] of God with the rest of the word and
[1:56:14] spirit that
[1:56:16] clear you're
[1:56:18] Vindicated other people can see it yeah
[1:56:22] people experience it when they get
[1:56:23] around you other people are able to pull
[1:56:27] off of your tree gentleness oh my and
[1:56:32] they just want to be around you as they
[1:56:34] eat that fruit of gentleness and and and
[1:56:37] and peace oh my when they get around you
[1:56:40] there's just some kind of peace that
[1:56:41] passes all understanding they don't even
[1:56:43] understand it and you know many times we
[1:56:45] don't even understand it but there's
[1:56:47] something about the atmosphere in our
[1:56:49] life we have the fruit of the spirit for
[1:56:51] other people to enjoy it's not for us to
[1:56:55] enjoy if we're trying to enjoy the fruit
[1:56:58] on our own tree I think we've got
[1:56:59] something wrong now I say Lord forgive
[1:57:02] me if I've got that wrong but I believe
[1:57:04] he's been showing that to me and I think
[1:57:06] it's such a powerful Revelation it's not
[1:57:08] for us brother bradam said eternal life
[1:57:11] is
[1:57:11] what living for
[1:57:15] others the fruit on our tree ain't for
[1:57:17] us it's for others yeah but we'll be
[1:57:21] identified by the fruit that grows on
[1:57:22] our tree yeah that's right is so
[1:57:26] true those who have it are Vindicated by
[1:57:29] the word of God Amen and the rest of the
[1:57:31] word and spirit that clear some would
[1:57:34] have you believe it comes by schooling
[1:57:37] scholarship or degrees and I remember I
[1:57:40] encountered
[1:57:42] that couldn't be the pastor because I'm
[1:57:44] a novice
[1:57:46] sure but where where's the best
[1:57:48] schooling for this there's no
[1:57:51] scholarship to get in here that's right
[1:57:53] it comes some would have you believe
[1:57:55] that it comes by schooling scholarship
[1:57:57] or degrees I want to say if we have that
[1:57:59] that idea that theory it it's a
[1:58:01] denominational Theory yeah it's a
[1:58:03] denominational idea someone have you
[1:58:06] believe it comes by schooling
[1:58:07] scholarship or degrees if you go to
[1:58:09] school so long if you've been in the
[1:58:11] message so long if you've done something
[1:58:13] so long if you become a bishop study to
[1:58:16] be a pope or you become a cardinal or
[1:58:18] something like that some would have us
[1:58:21] believe that's where it comes from when
[1:58:24] a man by laying on of hands make you
[1:58:26] something to do it but they are off the
[1:58:29] word of God there's no man that can make
[1:58:32] you anything but what God's already made
[1:58:35] you gifts and callings are without
[1:58:37] repentance and if you have a gift and a
[1:58:40] calling you know what alls we need to do
[1:58:43] is actually pray that God would manifest
[1:58:45] that gift remember we said it he's the
[1:58:48] vine we're the branches and every branch
[1:58:50] that brings forth fruit he's going to
[1:58:52] purge it yeah amen but everyone that
[1:58:55] doesn't he said it it gets cut off it
[1:58:58] gets pruned and he Into the
[1:59:02] Fire where we're going today is
[1:59:04] understanding that it's at Thy word at
[1:59:08] Thy word amen we don't want to make it
[1:59:10] the centurion's word we don't want to
[1:59:11] make it brother bram's word we don't
[1:59:13] want to make it even Jesus word even
[1:59:15] though it is his word but we're talking
[1:59:17] about now the bride's word his word
[1:59:20] being on her lips
[1:59:22] yeah amen because we are his
[1:59:27] body brother bam says in the spoken
[1:59:29] words of the original see listen close
[1:59:31] now how different Jesus was in his days
[1:59:33] from the denominations of his
[1:59:36] day how different is he today from the
[1:59:40] denominations of our
[1:59:43] day from the denominations of his day
[1:59:46] they would point back to him how I'd
[1:59:48] like to hold on this a while phew
[1:59:52] they would point back over their
[1:59:53] shoulder back down through time and say
[1:59:56] we are moses'
[1:59:57] disciples we know that God appeared to
[2:00:00] Moses in the burning bush we know but I
[2:00:03] want to say this morning brothers and
[2:00:05] sisters has he appeared to you in the
[2:00:08] burning
[2:00:09] bush has he appeared to us in the pillar
[2:00:12] of fire because that Pillar of Fire that
[2:00:15] was taken over the head of William Mari
[2:00:16] and bradam that hangs in the in in
[2:00:19] Washington DC even today that picture
[2:00:21] where where Gordon Lacy I think it was
[2:00:24] maybe just Lacy he was the one that took
[2:00:27] took and identified the picture and
[2:00:28] certified it to be the only supernatural
[2:00:31] being captured on
[2:00:33] film we know that picture yeah that's
[2:00:36] the same same fire that Moses got to see
[2:00:40] in the burning bush amen it's not
[2:00:42] different he's the same yesterday today
[2:00:44] and forever but they would point back
[2:00:46] over their shoulder back down through
[2:00:48] the time and say we're Moses disciples
[2:00:51] we know that God appear to Moses in the
[2:00:52] burning bush and today we might say that
[2:00:55] we are William Mary and bram's disciples
[2:00:58] and that's good if we're truly William
[2:01:00] Mary and bram's disciples brothers and
[2:01:02] sisters then we're going to go all the
[2:01:04] way and get into Christ amen we're not
[2:01:06] just going to say I've got the books and
[2:01:08] tapes I know the message of the hour
[2:01:11] we're not just good behaviors we're
[2:01:13] going to go and follow his instruction
[2:01:16] he said if you can't take my word for it
[2:01:18] take his we know the story of elaser I
[2:01:20] don't want to get into preaching that
[2:01:22] today but elzer went to take a bride
[2:01:24] that's all and elzer got the bride to
[2:01:27] the groom and then eleazer
[2:01:32] disappeared right they know they know
[2:01:35] the history of Moses but they did not
[2:01:38] know the god of
[2:01:39] Moses cuz he stood before them in John 6
[2:01:42] and said before Moses was before Abraham
[2:01:46] was I am the burning
[2:01:49] bush and they know Moses
[2:01:54] history so it is today they know
[2:01:58] God they claim they know the word of
[2:02:01] Christ but they don't know the God that
[2:02:04] was in Christ painted
[2:02:08] fire who can get warmed by a painted
[2:02:11] fire a seminary
[2:02:13] experience an idea that someone's been
[2:02:16] around the message long enough they'll
[2:02:18] be able to have the credentials to be
[2:02:20] able to do something that God's called
[2:02:21] them to do how can that be that's not
[2:02:24] the way it works it's a painted fire and
[2:02:26] who can get warmed by a painted fire a
[2:02:28] seminary experience they knowed Moses
[2:02:31] but not as
[2:02:33] God you know we we have the ability to
[2:02:36] go all the way and have the relationship
[2:02:38] with Jesus Christ ourselves why would we
[2:02:40] want to stop at a at a Sanctified
[2:02:43] position where we know that we're we're
[2:02:46] good enough we we've been set aside
[2:02:48] we've been Sanctified we've been washed
[2:02:50] out we were once in the ch chicken pen
[2:02:52] but now we're not we're put in the
[2:02:53] cupboard who wants to just be left in
[2:02:55] the cupboard what don't mean just left
[2:02:57] in the cupboard we want to actually be
[2:02:58] used
[2:03:01] Amen brother bam goes on to say in the
[2:03:03] spoken words The Original Seed and yet
[2:03:04] at 12 years old he confounded the
[2:03:06] scribes and the Pharisees oh my that
[2:03:09] spoke of it why why didn't they say
[2:03:11] something to him as a kid it was God's
[2:03:15] word and they couldn't withstand that at
[2:03:18] 12 years old Jesus in the temple
[2:03:21] withstanding the scribes and the
[2:03:24] Pharisees the religious ones no wonder
[2:03:27] the people were astonished at his
[2:03:28] Doctrine did you ever read that in Mark
[2:03:30] 1:22 if you want to put that down the
[2:03:32] people was astonished at his Doctrine
[2:03:34] because he taught like somebody that had
[2:03:36] Authority he know what he was talking
[2:03:39] about see the church now should have a
[2:03:41] double portion of the spirit
[2:03:45] right for it's true like Elijah's
[2:03:49] garment fell upon Elisha a double
[2:03:52] portion the same thing come from Jesus
[2:03:57] Christ but then
[2:04:00] what that portion went somewhere
[2:04:02] brothers and sisters don't think that it
[2:04:05] just went to William Mary and Bram just
[2:04:06] for him that portions for you that
[2:04:10] double portions for me yeah amen he says
[2:04:14] the same thing come now from Jesus
[2:04:16] Christ now you say oh brother Bram
[2:04:18] you're talking about his church that's
[2:04:20] right that's his body the church is
[2:04:24] supposed to be his
[2:04:26] body they're the ones that are supposed
[2:04:29] to be performing his word remember we
[2:04:32] said it in read it in in the spok in the
[2:04:35] in the perian church age she has thus
[2:04:40] saith the Lord she's not looking for it
[2:04:43] some people are still looking for it
[2:04:45] they don't understand that that's
[2:04:47] already happened the Baton has already
[2:04:49] been passed she just needs to say amen
[2:04:54] right but you know just like this
[2:04:57] Centurion
[2:04:59] here in Luke chapter 7 amen he was given
[2:05:04] the opportunity to see
[2:05:07] Jesus in fact when you read it I think
[2:05:10] in
[2:05:11] Matthew Jesus when he was asked to go I
[2:05:15] might have it wrong but I think it's in
[2:05:17] Matthew Jesus was asked to go and and
[2:05:20] see him just Matthew's account to the
[2:05:22] same instance when he was asked to go he
[2:05:24] said immediately I'll go yep let's
[2:05:28] go but we know that the Centurion he
[2:05:31] said to his servants no no no hold on a
[2:05:34] second I'm not worthy for you to come
[2:05:36] under my house I know what it means to
[2:05:38] be a man of authority and you're a busy
[2:05:40] guy and I don't want to interrupt your
[2:05:41] meetings I don't want to stop you from
[2:05:43] what you're doing I I just want you to
[2:05:45] speak the word if you could just speak
[2:05:46] one word to my direction to my situation
[2:05:50] for my problem that would change
[2:05:52] everything in my life just one word from
[2:05:54] you and you know it's gone from just
[2:05:57] asking like the Centurion was to now
[2:06:00] being told
[2:06:03] speak speak the word it's been given
[2:06:06] back to you you've got the checkbook and
[2:06:09] you've got the full bank account with
[2:06:11] all the money all you need to do is
[2:06:12] learn how to fill out the
[2:06:15] checks the bride's commission is to
[2:06:17] speak the word I'll call the musicians
[2:06:19] we're already at noon here at 12:00 the
[2:06:23] bride's commission brothers and
[2:06:25] sisters at Thy
[2:06:27] word at the word of the
[2:06:30] Bride the husband's will is accomplished
[2:06:34] yeah
[2:06:35] amen and she knows what he wants done
[2:06:38] with his
[2:06:40] word she does it and and she does it
[2:06:43] because she has the authority to do
[2:06:46] it the only way
[2:06:49] though is for our word to match his word
[2:06:53] when we want to speak the word and try
[2:06:55] and make it our own way our own will our
[2:06:58] own situation if it's not according to
[2:07:01] his word we're going to ask a miss and
[2:07:03] James talks about that we're going to
[2:07:04] ask to consume it upon the lust of our
[2:07:06] flesh our brother prayed about that
[2:07:08] earlier today we don't want to ask
[2:07:10] according to the lust of our flesh we
[2:07:11] want to ask according to the word of God
[2:07:13] knowing exactly who we are and where we
[2:07:16] stand you know maybe stand with me as we
[2:07:19] close today in 1964 in the tri I don't
[2:07:22] know if you got this quote or not
[2:07:23] brother Bram you can I I I'll just say I
[2:07:26] challenge you look that up in 1964 0419
[2:07:30] as we close today this is out of the
[2:07:33] trial understanding that you know
[2:07:36] brothers and sisters the bride's
[2:07:37] commission is to speak the word not to
[2:07:39] be afraid not to call upon the Lord over
[2:07:42] and over and over again but to speak the
[2:07:44] word without fear knowing where we
[2:07:47] stand you able to find that I challenge
[2:07:50] you to believe that Jesus Christ is
[2:07:54] revealed in the form of son of man
[2:07:59] right now some people will say well this
[2:08:02] is this is just talking about William
[2:08:04] maryiam branam this is only about
[2:08:07] William Mar and
[2:08:08] Bram and others are going to see it
[2:08:11] maybe a little more personal than that I
[2:08:13] challenge you to believe that Jesus
[2:08:17] Christ is revealed in the form of son of
[2:08:20] man in human flesh
[2:08:23] amen I'm just waiting I want I want to
[2:08:26] bring it up so right to throw a
[2:08:28] curveball at you I challenge you to
[2:08:31] believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in
[2:08:34] the form of son of man yes in human
[2:08:38] flesh amen through the bride's body yes
[2:08:43] accept his call amen amen we have God
[2:08:47] speaking to this generation through his
[2:08:49] Vindicated Prophet saying this I
[2:08:51] challenge you to believe
[2:08:53] it that he's here amen we know that he
[2:08:57] declared he's here I'm not declaring
[2:08:59] he's coming and and that he's gone
[2:09:01] brother brandom said it very clearly I
[2:09:04] am declaring that he is here and here we
[2:09:07] have in the trial in 1964 I challenge
[2:09:10] you to believe that Jesus Christ is
[2:09:12] revealed in the form of son of man now
[2:09:15] the son of man Ministry is that tiny
[2:09:17] little window that tiny little Ministry
[2:09:19] we've talked about it on the timeline we
[2:09:21] we all know about it but it is him being
[2:09:24] born in flesh yes that's why we get born
[2:09:28] again when we get born again it's the
[2:09:30] son of man Ministry am amen that's the
[2:09:33] son of man Ministry not through just
[2:09:35] William Mary and brand we just put it
[2:09:37] off onto the prophet then we're doing
[2:09:38] what he said we're putting it off to the
[2:09:40] Future looking back to another age but
[2:09:42] ignoring what he's doing right now this
[2:09:44] is where the dynamic power of the Lord
[2:09:46] Jesus Christ comes into the church
[2:09:48] brothers and sisters when we can take it
[2:09:50] and say that's mine that's for me be it
[2:09:53] unto me according to Thy word when we do
[2:09:55] that that's where we see the Dynamics
[2:09:58] come down on the
[2:10:00] mechanics I challenge you to believe
[2:10:03] that Jesus Christ is revealed in the
[2:10:05] form of son of man in human flesh
[2:10:08] through the bride's body accept his call
[2:10:11] amen amen it's up to us to accept his
[2:10:14] call all we have to do is accept it and
[2:10:17] if we're willing to do that if we're
[2:10:19] willing to disel that's why his theme
[2:10:20] song was only believe not go and do
[2:10:24] remember it's not our job to try and
[2:10:28] make the word of God come to pass it's
[2:10:32] only our job to believe the word of God
[2:10:36] to allow him to bring it to
[2:10:39] pass amen Galatians
[2:10:44] 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit this is
[2:10:47] the fruit that we want to see on our
[2:10:49] tree because there's the world that's
[2:10:51] starving brothers and sisters and
[2:10:53] they're not starving for food there's
[2:10:55] more food everywhere all around the
[2:10:58] world right now than probably there's
[2:10:59] ever been and maybe there's some that
[2:11:01] would say there's a challenge for but
[2:11:03] many people in North America there's no
[2:11:05] challenge for food but we're talking
[2:11:07] about the food that is actually Eternal
[2:11:10] and and that that food that fruit that
[2:11:13] people is starving for where they're is
[2:11:15] a famine in the land that famine isn't
[2:11:17] for food it's for the word of God and
[2:11:20] and it's love and joy and peace those
[2:11:22] are the fruits we want to see hanging in
[2:11:24] our branches for our families for our
[2:11:26] brothers and sisters for our neighbors
[2:11:28] for our bosses for our co-workers for
[2:11:31] everyone around us the teachers at
[2:11:33] school we want to set that atmosphere
[2:11:36] that they can enjoy gentleness and
[2:11:38] goodness and faith and meekness and
[2:11:40] Temperance in our
[2:11:42] lives that's the measuring stick
[2:11:44] brothers and sisters that's how we know
[2:11:47] that we are actually heading the right
[2:11:49] direction cuz we can say Amen to the
[2:11:51] word I believe the word of God I believe
[2:11:53] the message of the hour all we want but
[2:11:55] can we live it because when we start
[2:11:57] living it that's the fruit that's
[2:11:58] hanging on our
[2:12:00] branches God bless you this morning

[2:12:21] little crunchy or chewy father but Lord
[2:12:24] I pray that you would give us the
[2:12:25] ability to to to consume these words
[2:12:28] Lord that we would think about them that
[2:12:31] we would Ponder them in our lives Lord
[2:12:33] Jesus and see how this word applies to
[2:12:35] us personally in our lives Lord not

[2:12:57] spirit in the name of Jesus Christ

[2:13:09] lamps and five of them just lacked a
[2:13:11] little bit of oil all of them had oil
[2:13:13] all of them had lamps all of them were
[2:13:15] virgins all slumbered and slept oh

[2:13:27] that we would be able to heed the call
[2:13:30] from the bridegroom coming and father if
[2:13:32] there's anybody here today that has not
[2:13:34] truly enjoyed the baptism of your Holy
[2:13:38] Spirit father Lord I pray that in the
[2:13:40] name of Jesus Christ they would be able
[2:13:42] to go all the way Lord into you that you
[2:13:46] would Lord give them the desire give
[2:13:49] them the ability father to hum
[2:13:51] themselves to your word to go all the
[2:13:53] way and get into you father Lord we love
[2:13:57] you and we thank you we pray that you
[2:13:59] would be glorified in every area of Our
