[48:05] who cannot speak well and say we are
[48:08] going to be like a legendary it doesn't
[48:10] make sense
[48:19] it's not possible first of all I against
[48:23] people
[48:25] secondly
[48:26] um I'm fine I'm never
[48:29] exactly when I was praying
[48:31] you not took me to Exodus chapter 4.
[48:37] um
[48:40] you know
[48:41] Moses
[48:45] speaking
[48:49] like he said God give me everyone to
[48:53] speak for me
[48:55] foreign
[49:30] right
[49:35] but beyond the Miracles
[49:38] God will voice speaking
[49:41] and so those
[49:43] that are coming to the to the Miracles
[49:47] must Miss The Voice
[49:51] because they are looking only at the
[49:54] miracle
[49:55] amen
[49:56] but
[49:58] worldwide
[50:00] in Numbers Chapter 14.
[50:07] chapter 14.
[50:09] when
[50:11] um
[50:12] um moves from 12 styles to clean up
[50:16] right
[50:17] and this
[50:20] selected so it wasn't in London
[50:27] out of every class of Israel
[50:32] well let me make it still play
[50:34] this man my elders in the truck
[50:38] there are men who have been in the
[50:41] message for a long time
[50:44] and so they understood everything and I
[50:47] was like they were chosen
[50:50] they are professions they knew the laws
[50:54] they use everything that muscles use and
[50:56] so they are influencer
[50:59] and so they were chosen
[51:07] you know because
[51:10] it was a missed multitude
[51:18] two people
[51:20] go who are following Moses because of
[51:24] the sign
[51:27] and those following muscles because of
[51:30] The Voice
[51:32] two
[51:34] now listen closely
[51:38] those foreign
[52:00] what
[52:03] and so
[52:05] when we have 12 people
[52:18] because all the return because all their
[52:22] hearts were in the science of Miracles
[52:26] Giants what things are Madness muscles
[52:30] does not have or the science that we
[52:33] have seen before is not enough to
[52:35] conquer these people
[52:38] because they are looking at the size
[52:43] and so when you came back
[52:46] they said Moses everything you told us
[52:48] is true
[52:50] they did not deny the fact
[52:53] want to shake is true God
[52:58] remember
[53:01] that's why
[53:03] and when when the husband came to eat
[53:06] okay did God tell you
[53:09] that was that was wonderful
[53:12] but
[53:17] book book
[53:18] the devil always as a conjunction to the
[53:22] word of God
[53:24] ask something to me
[53:26] he does not really good night
[53:36] I thought healed the roof and crumble
[53:38] and that way in Latin cancer form
[53:41] when you came to Christ he created this
[53:44] Christmas
[53:45] and so the brother used to cook very
[53:49] well
[53:52] no
[53:54] when the women who came out and when
[53:57] they were coming
[53:59] I said Moses
[54:08] but we shot Giants
[54:11] and we saw things
[54:18] the report that we had
[54:20] convict all Israel
[54:24] foreign
[54:56] far away
[55:02] and so
[55:04] foreign
[55:07] was too powerful
[55:09] that the prophet of the day was not held
[55:15] and I think again I said the salon got
[55:20] those 10 people
[55:25] got the message of that game was no hand
[55:38] what was love
[55:39] we've come to another time
[55:42] you know uh the American Medical uh uh
[55:47] in the men's group
[55:48] when he said that
[55:51] um the world is promoting for things
[55:55] men men want to become women
[55:59] and women want to become men
[56:01] and guys
[56:05] anything right
[56:08] foreign
[56:09] [Music]
[56:17] long long horse
[56:20] in the car to the airport to the rocket
[56:25] and then that's how the message has
[56:28] moved down the edges and you can say
[56:31] that we are now in the locker right in
[56:34] time that we the last coming time
[56:37] not listening
[56:39] now
[56:41] the world is closing things
[56:47] foreign
[57:10] [Music]
[57:18] [Music]
[57:20] and crying against the abdomination in
[57:24] the world
[57:29] Holy Ghost those who feel
[57:34] and so the most dear people that
[57:37] requires times against that abomination
[57:41] not to complain not tomorrow but men can
[57:46] be underneath crying against the
[57:48] solution
[57:51] and that is where we are today
[57:55] you've got you can join yourself
[57:58] Gomorrah
[58:01] we are in such a situation
[58:06] to come to destroy that City
[58:10] is Nick James James
[58:12] yeah the other thing does not invite us
[58:15] man every day he was crying in hanging
[58:19] every day
[58:21] the field of the city
[58:28] and
[58:31] we are in in before our you know and you
[58:36] figure you see the things
[58:43] like things
[58:45] but right before our very eyes
[58:48] we see both things
[58:54] that a man did not marry a man
[58:58] a woman reminding a woman an animal
[59:02] he doesn't make sense
[59:04] because
[59:05] like that to show them
[59:08] but people think that it's not true but
[59:12] now before our eyes we see those things
[59:16] dimensions
[59:22] that is our reaction to it
[59:28] the angel when God do
[59:31] to shine
[59:32] to to people and stand on those that are
[59:36] trying against the abomination in life
[59:45] now I would try to introduce myself
[59:54] open floor foreign
[1:00:14] do what
[1:00:16] are his work
[1:00:24] so
[1:00:26] um
[1:00:35] okay fine
[1:00:42] foreign
[1:01:08] foreign
[1:01:42] because God has done this
[1:01:47] all titles
[1:01:51] upon them
[1:01:53] and God shall not in all the things all
[1:01:57] your life amen
[1:02:02] oh
[1:02:04] I want to stick on drinks
[1:02:14] and then
[1:02:17] I'm not just sticking on doing like
[1:02:20] doing with all your games I just want to
[1:02:23] bring about something
[1:02:25] that the grace of God is playing purpose
[1:02:30] now
[1:02:32] Adam
[1:02:35] what was that
[1:02:36] is
[1:02:41] now at this point
[1:02:43] mindfulness
[1:02:46] I want to look at himself I think that
[1:02:48] he was naked
[1:02:50] this is a man
[1:02:53] he got the Dominion in fact
[1:02:57] that was a perfect man
[1:03:00] man
[1:03:06] that's what it means
[1:03:09] physical so Adam had this castle of a
[1:03:13] perfect man
[1:03:16] and that was perfect
[1:03:19] he had dominion over all
[1:03:26] in time of Adam
[1:03:28] what we call Supernatural to bring was
[1:03:32] natural
[1:03:35] do you understand
[1:03:37] foreign
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:48] animal
[1:03:49] everything he learned them because he
[1:03:52] had the authority
[1:03:54] now Adam had the authority of God on
[1:03:58] Earth
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:00] okay
[1:04:02] no
[1:04:04] what happened
[1:04:12] that is in the word of God
[1:04:15] because
[1:04:19] right because the water the other thing
[1:04:22] that God has necessity his world and
[1:04:26] goes his own name
[1:04:28] do you understand
[1:04:30] God Has Lifted his own world as those
[1:04:33] his own land
[1:04:36] no
[1:04:39] no Adam coming down
[1:04:43] and in his basement missions the Bible
[1:04:46] says
[1:04:49] that the man was not refused
[1:04:51] because the woman being translation
[1:04:56] So Adam knew what he was doing when he
[1:04:59] didn't ask
[1:05:01] and then the cause of the wife
[1:05:05] you know to Adam this woman to tackle me
[1:05:10] I thought if this woman will die let me
[1:05:14] die
[1:05:15] tell us again
[1:05:19] you see
[1:05:21] that God lost Fellowship
[1:05:25] now it is
[1:05:29] God came down for Fellowship right
[1:05:32] as of course Owings to to bring God only
[1:05:35] some kinds of services
[1:05:42] why God lost Fellowship
[1:05:46] and what that evening
[1:05:49] God came I think he did not know what
[1:05:52] happened God knew what happened so Adam
[1:05:56] where are you
[1:05:58] now
[1:06:04] foreign
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:15] to the devil
[1:06:17] if you have to remove it it is not to
[1:06:20] the devil that was why Adam was
[1:06:23] I don't know
[1:06:25] I don't want to hide the focus is good
[1:06:27] because he looks like a sweet dreams of
[1:06:30] course
[1:06:32] I could not cover him
[1:06:35] foreign
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:07:10] foreign
[1:07:21] God did not attribute to the Earth
[1:07:24] to agonize
[1:07:26] the Act was to be second
[1:07:29] and gotten justification
[1:07:32] they never did it in your first name
[1:07:39] turn to the circus is not asking many
[1:07:42] questions
[1:07:55] no
[1:07:58] at that time the girl who became
[1:08:01] confused
[1:08:03] because the devil has its own plan
[1:08:07] and at that time his home plan he
[1:08:11] thought that he has gotten what he was
[1:08:12] looking for
[1:08:14] his plan was actually in English
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:24] because in resignation this doesn't make
[1:08:27] us to understand that before the world
[1:08:30] ever to God that will not go swimming
[1:08:33] right
[1:08:43] I wish together new
[1:08:48] and so
[1:08:50] when God came down
[1:08:52] to four things I don't drink
[1:08:58] yet remember because God that came
[1:09:01] looking for Adam not Adam looking for
[1:09:04] God
[1:09:08] can you have messed up he was hiding and
[1:09:11] then God came to him
[1:09:14] okay it was not of work that animal will
[1:09:17] do
[1:09:24] and then
[1:09:28] as I'm doing a perfect type of life
[1:09:36] why Eve was making sure
[1:09:45] quiet dying for
[1:09:49] when you can't go from America before
[1:09:54] God would like what we are saying is not
[1:09:57] I'm not I'm not trying to
[1:09:59] to use food and make magical I'm trying
[1:10:02] to show you from the scriptures
[1:10:07] to us
[1:10:10] so that we can have confidence in the
[1:10:13] word of God
[1:10:14] and when you think you speak with
[1:10:16] confidence because look at what you are
[1:10:18] saying is in the world
[1:10:22] no
[1:10:25] because
[1:10:27] foreign
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:52] Genesis
[1:11:04] of God
[1:11:09] and so
[1:11:11] yes there was fornication in the garden
[1:11:13] of England
[1:11:15] but the thing was underneath
[1:11:18] because the woman God gave it that Lord
[1:11:23] God shall not equal this
[1:11:25] and all that is that he came to do was
[1:11:28] to make sure that she is
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:35] the very word of God
[1:11:38] because that work and make him because
[1:11:40] that's what he stopped the world as he
[1:11:43] came into being
[1:11:45] that same world we turn our backwards
[1:11:51] now
[1:11:53] don't bring
[1:11:56] was there even before the world ever to
[1:11:58] God
[1:12:01] no because Noah
[1:12:04] and I will see that all we read the
[1:12:07] class
[1:12:09] not all well
[1:12:14] every every day
[1:12:21] but look at how it looks like
[1:12:25] no
[1:12:27] when you are hungry the other thing that
[1:12:30] you are free for 120 years
[1:12:35] never found something that made them
[1:12:38] convinced and confirmed
[1:12:41] 120 years will come from that
[1:12:46] every day you are thinking 120 years
[1:12:50] Americans
[1:12:53] I'm like sometimes while 20 times four
[1:12:57] of my age
[1:12:59] and this man every day he will go with
[1:13:02] his microphone because the marketplace
[1:13:06] I'm speaking God is calling just this
[1:13:10] act
[1:13:11] every day look on that
[1:13:15] no contact
[1:13:17] then it doesn't make sense that you have
[1:13:20] the word of God and it is not conducting
[1:13:22] people
[1:13:25] but what makes sense
[1:13:27] but those he met something
[1:13:31] that many convenes that this is God's
[1:13:34] word
[1:13:36] you see so you are not even pass some
[1:13:39] time for wonders well yet he was so
[1:13:41] shocking of the word of God
[1:13:45] for like 20 years
[1:13:48] so at the time
[1:13:50] you can ask and in those days they are
[1:13:55] good scientists good scientists
[1:14:03] the science
[1:14:05] I hope they look over they saw
[1:14:08] everything
[1:14:15] from animals using influence
[1:14:30] let me show something here
[1:14:33] foreign
[1:14:36] foreign
[1:15:27] I really care
[1:15:29] no
[1:15:32] because when he was speaking the last
[1:15:34] time
[1:15:35] he stood on groups being a covenant
[1:15:40] now I want to look forward
[1:15:47] not according to the clothing life like
[1:15:49] I made in the father and the day because
[1:15:57] foreign
[1:16:29] what
[1:16:33] how that came
[1:16:34] and then today we want to make the
[1:16:38] mission in mental stuff
[1:16:41] so when I have
[1:16:43] one line one thousand one hundred
[1:16:47] uh Commandments
[1:16:52] like that
[1:16:55] until the message becomes a relation to
[1:16:58] you
[1:17:00] amen you have to be a reservation to be
[1:17:04] revealed
[1:17:07] and until you come to that point you are
[1:17:09] not a Christian
[1:17:12] but anything that is going without food
[1:17:17] anything
[1:17:19] I mean anything that is done without
[1:17:22] faith in sin
[1:17:24] and so meaning that for a Believer every
[1:17:27] step that he says he must give that
[1:17:30] resolution
[1:17:32] and so we need to understand when we say
[1:17:36] we are in the message we need to
[1:17:38] understand what we are talking about
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:04] in English
[1:18:10] in that time
[1:18:13] again
[1:18:17] a new heart
[1:18:20] and then if you think
[1:18:22] and then I'll give my experience in them
[1:18:27] foreign
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:50] that is the message
[1:18:53] the Bible says that the message is the
[1:18:55] Holy Ghost
[1:18:57] foreign
[1:19:18] logically because that's what we have to
[1:19:22] do people the slave message in a logical
[1:19:25] sequence right
[1:19:29] this is
[1:19:33] right and so
[1:19:35] and so today this Castle comes into
[1:19:37] exhausting doctors
[1:19:47] mental yoga
[1:19:51] and I will put my love in the mind
[1:19:55] and write them in their heart
[1:19:59] is not good
[1:20:03] but you come in Houston Texas right
[1:20:08] before man
[1:20:12] life in your heart
[1:20:14] that thing
[1:20:16] this is Christianity I'm trying to think
[1:20:19] of something that this is Christianity
[1:20:22] when Christ why would he tell Joshua
[1:20:25] this one day and night
[1:20:29] and when you Google you have good
[1:20:31] questions
[1:20:33] let's be written in the presence of your
[1:20:36] heart
[1:20:41] I you you ever wonder the program told
[1:20:45] us that the greatest that you ever
[1:20:47] fought
[1:20:48] foreign
[1:20:52] I know because
[1:20:54] we have something else in our heart
[1:20:57] that is not the world
[1:20:59] and that was like when the guy said
[1:21:02] something he said the reason why you
[1:21:05] don't hear the voice of God
[1:21:07] it was because they are hearing and
[1:21:09] another voice
[1:21:13] and your love's wife
[1:21:19] of God or you're hearing another one
[1:21:24] that's what you see
[1:21:26] all these things are in the message
[1:21:29] but we don't have time for the message
[1:21:32] because we also lose the message
[1:21:49] okay
[1:21:51] and they shall not treat every nice
[1:21:54] middle
[1:21:55] or
[1:22:11] it is the work of God
[1:22:13] God doing it
[1:22:17] now
[1:22:20] let me go to Abraham
[1:22:22] Joshua
[1:22:25] Joshua
[1:22:27] where he was about to die or something
[1:22:29] yeah and told them
[1:22:33] the fella of Abraham Taylor
[1:22:36] was uh an agonica
[1:22:40] so Abraham came from an angle Washington
[1:22:43] family
[1:22:46] foreign
[1:23:01] no
[1:23:02] nothing foreign
[1:23:15] what because
[1:23:18] when he was born even his father his
[1:23:21] grandfather
[1:23:22] foreign
[1:23:52] foreign
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:36] if you walking with God every step of
[1:24:40] the way
[1:24:45] little family lives use everything
[1:24:49] what am I going through I don't know and
[1:24:52] God showed me something and then he kept
[1:24:54] moving
[1:24:57] a lot
[1:25:00] oh
[1:25:08] lots of network
[1:25:11] and then they kept moving now as I was
[1:25:15] 75 years when God called him
[1:25:25] seven to five years an old man
[1:25:28] and then
[1:25:35] the brother called me they didn't make
[1:25:37] any promise he called me informed me
[1:25:40] online
[1:25:42] I don't know
[1:25:47] foreign
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:15] no
[1:26:23] if those of God to whom you are supposed
[1:26:26] to bring and I was trying to understand
[1:26:28] things
[1:26:36] so
[1:26:41] the the length of employment
[1:26:46] and that what was God doing
[1:26:48] first of all the damn Christian missions
[1:26:52] now the work of God also in
[1:26:54] concentration
[1:26:59] foreign
[1:27:31] now this is 24 years
[1:27:34] this man has been working with God and
[1:27:37] God has made him a promise of his son
[1:27:40] for 24 years
[1:27:44] 199 years now
[1:27:46] and God will come back soon I want to go
[1:27:48] and Destroy them when you see my friends

[1:32:09] but now what was God going
[1:32:13] this is the highest level of succession
[1:32:17] where a man can die to walk in love for
[1:32:20] God
[1:32:25] What is love
[1:32:26] what was love because
[1:32:31] if you love me pick my Commandments
[1:32:35] Commandments

[1:32:42] otherwise
[1:32:44] [Music]

[1:32:51] Isaac did not know why he was going
[1:32:53] through
[1:32:54] and everyone in his heart was crying oh
[1:32:57] God I am going to happen
[1:33:00] a lot of walking
[1:33:02] foreign
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:20] now
[1:33:22] the grace of God
[1:33:25] when you look at Hebrews
[1:33:27] the account of God on your behalf
[1:33:31] because he he
[1:33:33] will not right laughs
[1:33:37] Hallelujah
[1:34:00] okay
[1:34:08] very well he was not just an adult
[1:34:13] right
[1:34:20] and then in that mission I'm not on the
[1:34:23] universe so that on the user of on the
[1:34:27] losers
[1:34:28] so from a group of the river a great one
[1:34:32] so when you go to classical and ask for
[1:34:36] a harlot you will not show you rehab
[1:34:39] so not just normal
[1:34:44] okay
[1:34:46] now
[1:34:48] foreign
[1:35:24] talking
[1:35:28] because
[1:35:32] oh yes
[1:35:38] and
[1:35:40] Christ came from her
[1:35:47] Christ came from the language of New
[1:35:50] York
[1:35:51] in Hollywood
[1:35:52] of hollow
[1:35:58] now
[1:36:00] John chapter 4 drunk after Inc ground
[1:36:04] four the woman and well American right
[1:36:11] two of us and I don't know how to do
[1:36:14] things we have four horsemen but the one
[1:36:17] that you have now is not inside
[1:36:20] foreign
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:44] lost so who
[1:36:48] foreign
[1:37:14] work in her heart
[1:37:18] he said no you threw some people and you
[1:37:22] look as well
[1:37:24] they are gone they are dead
[1:37:26] you go to the conditions that they are
[1:37:29] into
[1:37:31] it one day I I went to Marble station
[1:37:37] um
[1:37:40] so when I was struggling I saw this
[1:37:43] homeless people and I was trying to like
[1:37:46] avoid them
[1:37:49] in my room
[1:37:57] I think
[1:38:03] of God
[1:38:06] in that situation
[1:38:10] and what we have spoken to him I would
[1:38:13] have been an expression of the grace of
[1:38:15] God to him at that time
[1:38:18] but I did not
[1:38:22] oh
[1:38:23] um
[1:38:29] the power of God is greater than God's
[1:38:32] power
[1:38:36] foreign
[1:38:48] this one was talked in the act
[1:38:52] and so let us hear what you have to say
[1:38:56] now the government mistake that morning
[1:38:59] in doesn't make a mistake
[1:39:02] because
[1:39:05] to Christ
[1:39:07] [Laughter]
[1:39:10] Anna because
[1:39:20] was present at that time for that woman
[1:39:25] and so
[1:39:27] when the sound shoes who were at that
[1:39:31] time the highest level of Christianity
[1:39:35] I don't understand that
[1:39:38] did you put delivery assistant
[1:39:46] so let's not do that
[1:39:49] but
[1:39:51] the other one that called the summer
[1:39:53] as well as at that time
[1:39:56] according to restriction that woman was
[1:40:00] meant to die
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:08] yeah it was a mental knowledge
[1:40:12] because assuming they knew the grace of
[1:40:15] God
[1:40:16] recognize that you thank you standing
[1:40:19] before them was very brilliant we are
[1:40:21] looking for
[1:40:26] was calling and the terrible woman and
[1:40:30] the dragon was that it was a conclusion
[1:40:32] for Christ
[1:40:34] classical music
[1:40:37] they are looking like an adult life
[1:40:45] could be five things
[1:40:47] and so why you are holding your stroke
[1:40:51] at all
[1:40:57] that kind of measures when clients
[1:40:59] choose dimensions
[1:41:17] all of them it was hot in their heart
[1:41:21] yesterday
[1:41:27] foreign
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:37] and then that woman
[1:41:40] you cannot tell her that what should
[1:41:43] make that game was not good
[1:41:46] because
[1:41:48] on mental
[1:41:50] she was supposed to die in fact God has
[1:41:53] lost my last day on Earth
[1:41:57] I hope
[1:41:59] to die according to the scriptures
[1:42:03] after that time
[1:42:06] and so
[1:42:09] foreign
[1:42:33] go home no more
[1:42:39] no
[1:42:40] I've been talking about all the results
[1:42:49] doesn't
[1:42:51] a thing you know how you start from
[1:42:53] under your skin
[1:42:56] first of all the first respect was to
[1:42:58] bring the ark
[1:42:59] not in the way of God
[1:43:02] gospel
[1:43:13] do not the problem
[1:43:15] now
[1:43:16] when I was looking after I was laughing
[1:43:19] I was talking in my room
[1:43:22] doesn't
[1:43:24] Israel went to war
[1:43:26] baby who is the pastor did not go
[1:43:30] so he came home
[1:43:32] why he was supposed to bring the
[1:43:34] battlefield to stay home
[1:43:37] and then the Dragon
[1:43:43] so when he went out he saw that woman
[1:43:50] well that's another point
[1:43:58] foreign
[1:44:05] now
[1:44:07] because David is a seed of God
[1:44:11] God has to get this and immorganisms
[1:44:16] Morgan
[1:44:17] adultery I don't know how
[1:44:19] big of God's eye absolutely
[1:44:24] he never had there's no person for that
[1:44:27] girl to return
[1:44:30] he was okay with it
[1:44:33] yo the guy who can bring you africanisms
[1:44:47] I want you to return from this
[1:44:51] but God who is
[1:44:55] God had to send a process because
[1:45:00] remind him now when he went to church
[1:45:05] David's own government condemned him
[1:45:09] and so David was supposed to die that's
[1:45:12] something
[1:45:14] by his own government
[1:45:20] now I was talking so much time but I
[1:45:23] want to have to make I want someone
[1:45:26] anymore now
[1:45:28] I will not go up here
[1:45:34] oh I'm just trying to do nothing
[1:45:39] the work of Grace
[1:45:45] why was God bringing everyone to that
[1:45:49] point
[1:45:53] to him
[1:45:56] why was God bringing Moses to that point
[1:46:00] where God Called Moses
[1:46:02] you cannot encounter
[1:46:05] all these years now
[1:46:11] but one mistake he's talking about twice
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:33] let me show you something when Moses
[1:46:36] died
[1:46:37] the devil came to Texas governor
[1:46:40] it doesn't have to let God right for
[1:46:43] that problem
[1:46:49] has sinned
[1:46:53] as well
[1:46:59] at that time you got Paul
[1:47:02] when God bring power to for where he was
[1:47:05] to employ it like I said
[1:47:08] foreign
[1:47:28] gospel
[1:47:58] of God
[1:48:00] oh
[1:48:08] any man who has worked with God must
[1:48:11] come to report how before die how many
[1:48:15] people can die
[1:48:16] two times
[1:48:21] Escape when the angel went back and to
[1:48:24] do some time to die
[1:48:27] so he went back
[1:48:29] knowing that he was going to die
[1:48:31] imagine
[1:48:35] surrender to God Is So Many important
[1:48:39] but what I'm saying that language I mean
[1:48:42] important Miss God if it comes through a
[1:48:46] manuscripts meeting together the one
[1:48:48] figure when it happens that if you can
[1:48:51] knock life down to a call
[1:48:54] what was God doing back together the
[1:48:58] grace of God is to bring us to a place
[1:49:00] where you can come only important
[1:49:04] to do
[1:49:06] I was talking right now
[1:49:10] um
[1:49:11] foreign
[1:49:47] with me
[1:49:54] what we are talking about testimony of
[1:49:57] God or for your life
[1:50:00] and that's all that matters
[1:50:12] that the drug will be the last voice
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:24] it's lovable
[1:50:26] it means that God will scoop through the
[1:50:30] drive in this day
[1:50:33] now remember that the reason why we are
[1:50:37] the reason why
[1:50:39] there is still calmness everywhere is
[1:50:42] because of the blind
[1:50:44] nothing from the floor
[1:50:47] if those because of the elect
[1:50:51] this is something
[1:50:53] right
[1:50:56] and because it's very illegal Syria the
[1:51:00] grace of God will come upon the Earth
[1:51:02] right
[1:51:04] now why we are here how do we express
[1:51:08] that grace of God
[1:51:11] are we not supposed to be an expression
[1:51:13] of God bless
[1:51:19] ings of Jesus Christ everything he went
[1:51:23] to God preaching the gospel
[1:51:27] of the world
[1:51:31] but how come a song that loses his
[1:51:34] server is of no use
