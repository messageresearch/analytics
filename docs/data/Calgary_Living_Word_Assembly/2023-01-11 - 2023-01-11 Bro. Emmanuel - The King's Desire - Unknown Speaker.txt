[Music] I think that's all the singing will do um let's quickly go into the word thank you musicians let's read from First Chronicles chapter 11 and I'm going to read from verses 15 to 19. First Chronicles 11 verses 15 to 19. amen all right verse 15. now three of the 30 captains went down to the are you there say amen amen now three of the 30 captains went down to the rock of to The Rock to David into the cave of agilam and a host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of raytheim and David was then in the hold and the Philistine Garrison was then at Bethlehem and David longed and said all that one will give me a drink of water of the will of Bethlehem that is at the gate and the three break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David but David would not drink of it but he poured it out to the Lord and said my God forbid it me that I should do this thing shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in Jeopardy for with the Jeopardy of their life they brought it therefore he will not drink it these things did these three mightiest amen ah let's Bother our hearts before him precious Lord merciful father we're just grateful for one more opportunity to be in your presence this night Lord As We Gather we are gathering on to you father we are coming expecting from you we are not coming expecting from a man we thank you oh God for being with us throughout the weekend bringing us thus far now we come together we thank the signs of Zion we've sang your Praises we brought our worship whether we confess our weakness before you we confess above all our our unreserved dependence on you Lord without you we are Drafting and as we stand here we are waiting on you therefore that you will do what you know how to do best father that you will come and feed your children oh God breathe break this bread of life for God for The Souls of your children father we need strength this evening we deserve some more encouragement oh God we want guidance we want Direction Lord help us all go to recognize who we are what we created for our God and what is expected of us in this end time let your will be done oh God we love and appreciate you oh God we remember all those who may be joining us online and wherever else oh God let your War be done in their lives of god father even as a pastor's journey is winding down further may you bring him and the family safely home with brother Marvin and family let your will be done even as we go forward in Jesus Christ name amen all right you may have your seats um but a very uh wanted this announcement for those of you who have not seen yet he wanted the announcement of the uh I think Edmonton Living Word brother Eugene Brown's place they they have this Edmonton winter Youth Camp 2023 and it starts from March 22nd to March 26th and so but um the registration will be opened on Friday night and the reason he wanted it out quickly was that there are limited spaces and so if you want to be part of it then um you you have the link it's on the on the WhatsApp platform yes and so every other detail it's there as well and uh again let's I think tomorrow is the first prayer meeting of the year and so whoever can make it I think it's it's nice to get together before the Lord amen all right and so um from the scripture we read yes I chose to read this from Chronicles because um it makes a special distinction now this story it's it's it's related almost word to word and second Samuel in fact a little more detail in second Samuel but it makes a very important distinction with which I I think I I I want to draw attention right off the bat and that is that it refers to these three captains as the mightiest and I think that in all of the scripture that is the only place where they are referred to as the mightiest in fact in all of the King James Bible the only time the word mightiest is used in the superlative is in this sport so I just wanted to read that there's to sort of uh bring out what I want to speak about now um my topic this evening will be the king's desire the king's desire now it's true most of us will see this as uh maybe a story of Conquest a story of uh fighting and it's it's all of that but it's more than that it's a story of love hallelujah it's a great story of love that is expressed by these people towards the Akin now we have to know that David at this point was not a king yet but they knew that he was the coming King Hallelujah they knew that he was a communication so they sought every opportunity that they could get to please him and Brian says the least of his desire was their command Hallelujah even at the risk of their lives now I want to start off quickly by reading this uh quote from why little Bethlehem now it's a long quote I'll read parts of it um hopefully I can end this and not drag it too long so why little Bethlehem that's uh December 1963 brother Abraham says if I only had a drink inside of him cried out if I could only drink once more from that bowl at Bethlehem his desire was a commandment to those who loved him he said remember his soul was crying for a drink of that water and those who loved him his least desire was a command Hallelujah now the desire was a command not to everybody but to those who love him praise the name of the Living God now the fact is what I want to bring across is why talk about David yes these are military men these are Fighters or Warriors and they are loyal to their King and so what now further down the line Abraham says David here is a type of Christ because Christ is David's son here he was standing there crying for a drink of that water and his desire was a command and then he says I say to those who love him Hallelujah three of those men pulled their swords and forth 50 miles of men down to that City While others fought keeping them were Gallant Fighting men those Philistines twice their size some of them they were great men they trusted God they had faith in their leader and they cut his way down true until while some of them cut and the other one got a bucket of water and they cut their way back through another 15 miles of them and brought that up to David so he could drink praise the name of the Living God now so brother Abraham tells us that here David is the type of Christ and so for those who loved him the least of his desire was a command now for most of these people David actually represented the will of God for Israel because it's a time that Israel has started backsliding because the leadership was backslidden praise the name of the Living God and so these people were very attracted to David and because they were attracted to David they were also committed to the cause of David and so they were living even to die for it but in all of this their life with him was that they were doing everything they can seeking every opportunity just to please him so they were not thinking of how far they can go before sin no instead they were looking for the opportunity praise the name of the Living God so their question always was will this be pleasing to my Lord in everything that they did what they sought to do was will this be pleasing to my Lord when they are talking they are thinking as what I'm saying is going to be pleasing to my Lord when they are dressing is what I'm the way I'm dressing going to be pleasing to my Lord when they are driving is the way I'm driving going to be pleasing to my Lord praise the name of the Living God and wherever they are they sought to please the Lord praise the name of the Lord now when the people are seeking to please the Lord like that what are they doing they're seeking to represent him they are seeking to portray him to the rest of the world they are seeking to say this is what it is when the spirit of God lives in a man Hallelujah and so brother Brian tells us that they're for 15 miles to Bethlehem and 15 miles back other places he gives a different numbers but you see when you are doing that fighting through people now it's like this your King has expressed a desire the desire is Behind Enemy Lines and now we're talking about Bethlehem but at this point is Enemy Lines and so you have to fight through this now you don't know how many people are there you don't know anything about it but because the King has a spirit and that is all their motivation their King has expressed a desire and so they have an opportunity to fulfill it and so I wonder sometimes is that Earth attitude towards God is that our Behavior towards God hallelujah you have to do that this is I I would say is that it's it's a love an expression of love and it goes beyond love of Duty this is like devotion out of love praise the name of the Lord and so we will understand as we go ahead and what spirit will make a people behave like that because at this point they've heard they Akin and without telling him that's the other part of it they never said a word to him and so they are behaving like like a lover who has got a hint of their beloved and they are seeking and putting their lives on the line just to please it Hallelujah now because of what all this entails and the extent of the sacrifice and the display of bravery and all that God kept a record of all this Hallelujah he gave the record of all this which I I would say the exploits for their King and they are also exploits for Israel but even more than that they are experts for God's program for that day because while God's program for that day was what he was doing with David and these people caught the Revelation and so they put their lives to it Hallelujah on behalf of the revealed word he even kept a record of their names for posterity and so the First Corinthians 10 tells us that all of these are written for the benefit of those of us Hallelujah those of us who are in the For Whom the ends of this world have come trying to speak like the Bible Hallelujah and so my question is how burdened are you for the things of God how burdened are we all for the things of God when we read the scripture when we hear the message and we see all the all the sin around us how burdened are we do we just take it that oh yeah they're unbelievers does it or are we burdened do we want to do something about it because these people saw what is going on and they took the steps to do something about it but what I'm saying is we are all witnessing the spirit of Sodom and God Finance how do you feel about it within you we see that complete adulteration of Christianity just being watered down to to a club it's like a lodge that you can just join to meet nice people and have fun the world has been taken out of some way and the focus and emphasis the science are somewhere else and when you see that how do you feel and how do you want to react because for these people the least of the desires of the King was a commandment Hallelujah even in the message we see that happening but you see when you love somebody and this is why I'm asking these questions then you care for the things that are important to the Beloved praise the name of the Lord and so this is where we have been called to that these people fall their way 15 miles in then they got the water now they are coming back and they are fighting people not just any people trained people people who would be happy to kill them they have to fight them without knowing their number but as they're fighting them to they are keeping their bucket of water praise the name of the Lord and so think of the extent extent of it why they were they went and they brought this power David no wonder he did not drink it because he did not even feel worthy to drink it he did not feel worthy to drink it at all he you see yes then the first was there the initial first was there but once they came and he realized what had happened it changed into all it changed into admiration it it dawned on him the extent of the sacrifice that these people are willing to go for his sake Hallelujah now why would these people raise their life so much for a bucket of water couldn't they get any bucket of water from anywhere and especially this pocket it's not as if if if David doesn't drink he's going to die on heaven in the end he didn't even drink it and so why would they rake their life that much and this is the key they caught the revelation of what God was doing in that day Hallelujah they received a revelation for their day and and and that is what happens when people cut the Revelation for the idea they behave strangely they don't anymore belong to the crowd and even as they stand apart and they are different they are still proud to be different now I could talk so much about that but I just want to draw attention to something like um Moses for instance or the appearance of Moses amram Djokovic they call it revelation and so there was an order from a king but what they had received from was from a higher authority and so they had their baby but they wouldn't kill him right they defy the king's orders when when Joseph and Mary had to run to Egypt it was in defiance of an order from from Herod now I could go on and talk of all so many other things that people do but all I'm drawing attention to is the fact that when you catch the Revelation for your day it sets you on a course of action that is not like anybody else of course the devil will fight you and that is why we find this happening like Bethlehem is now a Garrison of the Philistines that's what the Bible says and so for it to be a Garrison it means that they've captured the city they control the city they fortified the city they are stationed at the city and they operating from the city it's practically theirs and that is David's hometown he can mention his his grandfathers who formed that City but now here they are under enemy territory and so that is what happened the devil fights all the time but you see program tells us that these three people trusted God Hallelujah and so when he said they trusted God it's like this God had already spoken by the lips of Samuel and he had already stated that David was going to begin there was no power in heaven that was going to stop that when God already declares his plan when God already declares intention nothing can stop it and because of what they had received because of what they had believed it started dictating their behavior it started dictating their actions praise the name of the Living God and this is where I'm saying that you have received God's program for this day you know what God is doing today how has that affected you how many of the things that we do is influenced by what we see surrounding us now remember a Christian is supposed to act not react you act based on your convictions of the word you have received and not all what goes around around you and so here we are these are three people who permitted the weather they have received to dictate their actions they had a revelation that David was a coming hand and they were not afraid to stand by him they were not afraid to take his time knowing that this is ordained of God hallelujah now I'm reading uh from why little Bethlehem a little further down it says remember when David come to his throne these men stood by him because he knowed they knowed he was coming to the throne they note that David was going to be on the throne no matter how much he was rejected he was the worst fugitive in their land and so is the true word of God this is a very sad situation but I like the fact that first it says David represents Christ now he says David represents the true word of God and Christ is the word and it says it's foreign to organizations and that's precisely where we are that the true word of God the revealed word of God is foreign to organizations but it's been revealed to you and God if there's one thing you can say about God is that he does not waste one word everything he said he meant it and it's supposed to produce something in us hallelujah now we know Jesus is the word of God made flesh and the Bible says that he comes to destroy the West of the evil one Hallelujah and so wherever Jesus is made manifests in whatever whatever life in whatever situation what happens is that because Jesus is made manifest the west of the evil one are destroyed Hallelujah now when you receive this message of the hour this revealed word of the hour which by the way is a program of God for this season any action that you take based on this word is a distraction of the work of the evil one but more than that any action that you take is also a testimony of the Lord's victory praise the name of the Lord and so whether you are at work what do you do as long as it is part of the word that you have believed as long as it's out of your conviction you are destroying the works of the evil one Hallelujah and you're manifesting the victory of the Lord in your life when you do that at home your actions based on the word this message that we have received you are destroying the works of the evil one and you are witnessing Hallelujah the Lord's Victory praise the name of the Living God and so we when we are called and when we are giving this message what we are coming to do here is to witness the complete fulfillment of God's word for today by accepting that word by believing that word by acting on that word we become Witnesses of his Vindication because God will not fail never not with vindicate his word no if the word is made manifest in your life he is there to confirm it praise the name of the Lord I'm reading from influence 1963 brother Raph says and whatever God has called you to let it be because he wants you to be a real housewife to reflect your influence upon another person that would want to be a good white housewife if you're a good businessman let your life so be that will reflect Jesus Christ in your business with honesty and integrity and with things that really mean something because somebody is watching your life you are influencing somebody God has to have a real housewife God has to have a real Teenage in school young people God has to have a real minister a real businessman somebody that will reflect him because there they see in you Christ no matter what the rest of the world has got to do that has not one thing to do with you or I we are responsible to God for our lives and for our experience in Christ praise the name of the Living God now we understand that David he was a Shepherd boy a few years before now he was taking care of his father's business which is in the countryside the Throne of Israel was the farthest thing from his mind it was God himself who went to him it was God who sent a prophet to David to go and tell him what he wants for him God declared his plan to David the only thing David did was believe it Hallelujah but it was God who went to declare his plan to David and what I want to say is that most of us were not looking for God no it was God himself who came our way it was God himself who spoke to us praise the name of the Lord and so once he has spoken he cannot take it back and so let's take him at his word we are not called to prove that word it is his responsibility Hallelujah so God took care of everything in spite of all the obstacles and difficulties and that's what he does for us too but as he protects us our duty is to love him and also completely commit ourselves to his purpose for our lives Hallelujah it was God himself who called David a man after his own heart Hallelujah it was God himself who even named The Throne of Israel his chosen people he named it the Throne of David Hallelujah and so sometimes you say oh if God did that then he chose him for a special purpose maybe things were smooth for David maybe things were easy for David no not David Hallelujah from the time he was anointed he went from one obstacle to other until he was crowned against him were so high that quite frankly it's difficult for any person to assume how even David survived because you see while the king of Israel at that time who just saw was looking for him to destroy him David had nowhere to go because the neighboring Nations he had a bad reputation there they all knew he had killed their champion they all knew he killed Goliath and so and he didn't even knew about the song about David that yes Saul had killed a thousand David had killed his ten thousands I believe personally that maybe they would even rather see David dead that's all because David was the one who was leading them out and in until he fell out with Saul and so this is the situation that he felt one obstacle after the other and I believe that a lot of times when God calls us sometimes he plays us into such a situation where you become a fugitive where you don't fit in quite well and then you are forced to look up Hallelujah you are forced to look up to him and him alone praise the name of the Lord now you see in all these things and they ought against him God still protected him why because he has spoken about him and this is part of where I wanted to get to that God has spoken about you Hallelujah it was God's responsibility to bring him the throne to bring him to the throne it is God's responsibility to bring you to that same throne praise the name of the Living God is the Queen of Heaven here God has spoken to you God has spoken about you it was God who called you his bride it was God who called you his elect it was God who said you were perfect without blemish it was God who said you are the apple of his eye if God speaks like that about you who are you to oppose it who are you to resist it what I'm saying is let's yield to his desire Hallelujah I'm reading from revelation chapter 4. that is 1961. look at David portraying Christ see when David was coming into power the first thing he had an awful time before he got into power yet he had anointing on him Hallelujah yeah the anointing was on him and a lot of people thought he was just a little Renegade a little guy that was different trying to tear up something but there is some men know that he was the coming King they stayed right with him brother I mean you couldn't even get them away from him as they walked on Hallelujah so this were people who caught the revelation and they lived by it Hallelujah anyway so the Lord protected him by placing many people in the life of David and those people were there to protect him those people were there to bring him to the throne so that all that God has spoken concerning Israel and concerning David will come to pass and so because they caught the Revelation they knew that in spite of the fact that he's a fugitive noun his ordained and in fact anointed for the throne and there's a blessing for everyone who placed a role in bringing to pass the word of God Hallelujah these were people who found their identity in the revealed word of the day have you found your identity here Hallelujah listen everybody reads the Bible all these churches are reading And when they see bright they know yes it's the Church of God and those that is going to save and but you read it I know it's about you and it's for now Hallelujah you know he is here to take you home praise the name of the Living God so when you find your identity you yield to the cause they were true to the Revelation their God about what they were created for they do their purpose also protect the king they knew they were to bring him to the throne because it was the king's desire now watch this it was Kevin's desire but it was they deserve the King of Kings as well because David his desire and that of God have become one at that point Hallelujah so they were willing to do whatever they can to fulfill the word of God even at the Peril of their own lives and that's why God handed him Hallelujah God honored them in his word God knows you as an individual Soldier God knows that he calls you alone especially as a gentile and God will always honor your faithfulness to his word and so when you receive that word there is nothing more than to be faithful praise the name of the Living God he brings his own word to pass now if a person can find his identity in the revealed word of the hour What Spirit do you think it's an operation at that point because no other spirit outside the Holy Spirit and I know you say oh we're talking about the Old Testament no Spirit Will Reveal your identity to you in the word of God outside the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Living God so if you know yourself now understand it it didn't just happen it's not because you are smart it's not because I'm preachers stayed here and repeated it no God revealed it to you and when he speaks to you personally like that then he'll reward your faithfulness to that word that he has spoken to you Hallelujah I want to read from ah the church ages this is lovely yes in the programian church age brother Rhymes says now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he said the church in order Paul had to say to those who claim another Revelation all having people claimed other Revelations oh yeah the message is good but it's not only the message now what did God say if you believe the Bible go to the Bible read it and understand that God himself said the Lord himself shall descend with a shout so if God promises that he is bringing a message and he brings it you think it's foreign it's not for a purpose and he declared it and so we know what it's for but still people who use logic and claim other revelation I thank God that we can stand on this revealed word Paul had to say to those who claim another Revelation what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a spiritual Christian believer is not to produce the truth but to receive the truth and to believe and Obey it praise the name of the Lord and so when you find these people they are soldiers they have caught the revelation of their age that word is not for us today but it was for them then to receive the Revelation for their day believe and obeyed and put their lives through it their lives were on the line every step of the way all that they did you understand that there is a spirit in operation and that is the spirit of God um I want us to read a couple of verses from first Samuel 22 so that will get a little feel of who who were these people who followed David first Samuel 22 um I'll just reach the first two verses the first two verses of first Samuel 22. David therefore departed them and escaped to the cave Adam and when his Brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down theater to him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented guided themselves together unto him and he became a captain over them and they were with him about 400 men everyone that was discontented everyone that was in debt brother there is a man here who will not hold your background against you you'll not hold your history against you in fact he'll pay your debts and he will send you free to make a choice and that's what sometimes baffles people because if the Lord has done all of this for me then maybe I'm I'm bound I'm obliged no it's not an obligation he's a gentleman he shows you what he can do for you and he leaves you to make the choice praise the name of the Living God now if we read I think second second uh someone 15 I'm not going to read it because I I really want to finish quick it talks about some other people who joined him and and I mentioned it because in this case they were gentiles and and I'll confess right now that What attracted me the most or the name of the Ali that's why I I looked him up he tied the guitar I thought it rhymed he tied the guitars but this is a man who is well when he's here guitar this means he's from gas he's from the place where Goliath was but he followed David and not just him 600 other men with him he was Captain of these 600 men and not only that their wives and their children were with him and even when David gave him the opportunity now this was David had ascended the throne and had been betrayed by his son Absalom and he was leaving and David said go back said no way I'm going with you now you know what happened after David came back when the Army was organized into three separate divisions One Division was led by a job there won't be enough time to talk about him here but if you read the Bible you know about job the other one was abhishai and then the third one was itai so it's like even in the camp of David there was no difference between Jew and Gentile Hallelujah I hope you're looking at it because I've already stated that according to brother I'm David represented Christ the name of the Living God and so from the scripture that we we just read in in in 1st Samuel 22 we find out that King David had hundreds of Fighters and especially mostly from Israel and they came to him ready to fight they knew who was the coming King they knew he was coming to the throne and I believe there are people here today who know that there is a coming King there are people here who know that he's going to sit up on the throne of his father David praise the name of the Lord now what I I I I asked at the beginning I'm still asking this is it just mere knowledge or are you willing to do something about it especially when you know he's not a very popular person no he's not easily accepted he's not recognized in places that was the situation of David that is the distillation of the Lord Jesus Christ now like program says the pure word is not accepted among the organizations right and so that's the situation now if you want to know what it was like for David everybody knows the story of Abigail I think you'll find it in first Samuel 25 I hope it is and everybody knows the story of Abigail when David the husband rather the husband neighbor when David sent and these people went to ask for and that was the time David was a fugitive they went to ask for help they wanted to ask for food what did Nebo say who is David who is the son of Jesse so there there are slaves these days who don't who break away from their masters should I take my food and water and give it to them right that is how much it was hated in some circles because this man was prospering and that the regime of Saul but those who were indebted those who are discontent they went with David Hallelujah and the soul and the establishment rejected everything David not just a man but all the people who sort of associate with him and that is key and that is very special for us today to understand that for us to be with our King it means life as normal won't actually be because most of these people they left their towns they left their Villages they went into the Wilderness they went into a cave they were not at one place at the time they were roaming they were vagabonds that is what it meant to take a stand for David then rather if we have taken a decision it means we will bear his reproach it means we'll share in his rejection but it also means ultimately that when he comes to the throne Hallelujah will be there with him and that is the cause that is the motivation and that is why we are supposed to focus on praise the name of the Lord because even Jesus himself had to focus on what lies ahead to pass through a time of difficulty Hallelujah so this is a beautiful picture of the selfless commitment and dedication that is required of us we are commanded to do it it's an act of love and for us most of these things it goes beyond desire it's a commandment of the king so we are not called to check and see and pick and choose oh did he say this did he really mean it was it no halleluia if you hear it he meant it praise the name of the Living God now David was not called to generate anything he was called to be himself only faithful to what God has called him for because when God calls you he doesn't call you to do he called you to yield so that he will do through you praise the name of the Lord and when you catch that Revelation you rest praise the name of the Living God because you see from the beginning of time God has never ceased from his desire to dwell in a man's heart he has never ceased to lead from the heart Hallelujah but you see when you yield to him it also pleases you in the line of fire of the devil right and then he starts all the alarms go off and all the distractions come in but it doesn't matter if you are yielded to him he'll protect you Hallelujah now second Samuel 8 says that the Lord preserved David with a server he went and as we read and we read a lot about David he was not busy thinking about his defense he was not busy thinking if there are some Traders among him the his group no he was just moving forward according to the word of God he was conscious that God has already declared it it'll come to pass and all of the people who were with him they knew it and so they kept marching forward because it was God's responsibility and it's no different from today and so this is all what I keep saying it's no different from today God has spoken about us we can't figure out how he's going to do it but he'll bring it to pass and so let's just focus on the things he said about us let's read it let's love it let it be the things that we meditate on Let It Be the things that we think about even when there are distractions sometimes they are there to bring the best out of you sometimes God permits these distractions to bring some correction some encouragement some strength sometimes just an opportunity for him to reveal himself a little more to you just for you to realize oh I'm still with you praise the name of the Living God and so this happens over and over so that the will of the Lord will be done so don't focus on oh he saw me and he pretended he hasn't seen me he looked at me and he whispered to that brother oh he looked at me from top down so what if you understand who is with you why do you like about why do you care about who is against you praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah anyway I'm just getting to where I wanted to be and then I'll I'll get to closing now beside the hundreds of committed Warriors whose sole purpose was to bring David to the throne there was an elite group of 30. who were part of his inner circle and these people were utterly completely devoted to David with a French and loyalty like like nothing could dissued up or change them they were there and they didn't care about their lives as long as David was safe and flourishing it doesn't matter what happened to them that is the extent of the of the commitment and then after this Elite group of 30. now if we read the Bible sometimes you want to count you'll count about 36 37 part of it with some some Diet some replace them and all that but they were always called the 30 of David now beside this Elite group of 30 there was what he calls the three mighties now these were over the top so much so that the Bible recalls their experts and please let's just read a little bit from second Samuel and and I think it's better read from the Bible than All That I Can Say so I would go to second Samuel 23. the second Samuel 23 I'll read from 18 second Samuel 23 yes I'm reading from 18. and abhishai the brother of joab the son of zeruya was Chief among three and he lifted up his peer against 300. and slew them and had a name among three was he not most honorable of three therefore he was their captain how be it he attend not onto the first three now I'll pause here because they have mentioned where I'm going to and that is the first three now we've mentioned these three matches ferocious Warriors nothing could stand in their way and by the Bible is describing one of them and and and the things that he did now abhisha was very specific in the fact that yes he was the nephew of David and he was always by David but look at a man who could stand at one time and literally do the impossible and I say that I'm not afraid to say that the Bible doesn't say that but how do you kill 300 fighters in a day how do you kill 300 Fighters at a stand they are not babies or animals they are warriors and they are powerful ones like that because they've captured part of your country and then one man you take a stand and you kill 300. that is abhishai IBC I was the kind of man that one point when David wanted to go to to to to to to to to to saw when Saul was hunting for David and everything and David wanted to go to where Saul was flying I sleep fast asleep and cut something and show to him that yes I could have killed you he said who will go for me Abisha was the only one who said I'll go with you Abisha was the man when David was cornered at one point that even the the giant was going to kill him I believe that was the one who killed the giant first and after all of these things the Bible says he did not attend to the first three just note that let's keep reading 20 he says and benaya the son of jeruida the son of a valiant man of capsuil even his father was Valiant who had done many acts he sleeps two lion-like men of Moab he went down also and slipped a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow and he's still an Egyptian a goodly man and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand for he went down to him with the staff and plugged the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and steal him with his own spear these things did benaya the son of jehoiah and had a name had the name among three Mighty Men he was more honorable than the 30 but he attended not to the first three one would ask what else is left of this killed lion like men two of them killed it now the Egyptian it doesn't say but in Chronicles it actually says that the Egyptian was a giant and benaya killed him and after all of that he says he attained not to the first three who are the first three but Abraham talks about them over and over and talks about their exploits uh to to David because they were the top of the land that there was none above them in David's Army and because we are at second Samuel 23 maybe we'll just read about them because the record of their data also recorded but what what is drawing my attention so much and why I want us to see it is the fact that they were gentiles now I wouldn't read that or know that from this Bible but program told us they were gentiles Hallelujah so just like you and I they call the revelation of the hour now understand that as Gentiles at that time they were not even entitled to know or hear about David or know about God's plan for that time but as long as they committed themselves to read God honored them and this is very important I don't want anybody ever listening to somebody saying oh yeah it's a fancy they know you've done this and you cannot stand and all it takes is the commitment nobody said even God did not say you are able but commit first and he'll take over from there praise the name of the Lord let's read second Samuel 23 let's read I will read from eight and then maybe I'll I'll just about closing seconds that's where we are from eight it says these be the names of the Mighty Men whom David had the technology that sat in the seats Chief among the captions the same was adino the S9 he lift up his spear against 800 whom he is still at one time he did what was impossible to do without the hand of God so for him when he held the sword there was no compromise when he held the sword there was no retreat when he held the sword he never gave up praise the name of the Lord now remember we are not sent to go and go out there and kill people the thought of the spirit is the word of God Hallelujah and so a sword has been handed to you in this end time it has been funded to you and it's Sharp the question is what is it for are we just supposed to just display so that everybody will know what the sharp sword we have or are we supposed to go forward with it I'm reading from nine and after him was a laser the son of daughter the our height one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that way they gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away he arose and smooth the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand cleaved onto the sword and the Lord wrote a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil Eliza defied popularity he was left alone but he stood his ground now it doesn't say it here but I think in in chronicle says that that was a barley field and I've seen I've heard commentaries that oh it wasn't important and everything at that time food was very important and there were a lot of food battles fought at the time of harvest and so they're in a battlefield the Philistines are coming people didn't think it was important enough to fight for it but for him it was his heritage he believed in it and he stood his ground and because it was that determined he fought and for me what I love the best is that his hands stuck to the sword that is what happened when you go on the offense with the word of God you get addicted to the word of God he sounds stuck to the sword and for me this is what I'm saying that the only addiction that I approve of is this addiction he's so addicted to the word that's the only thing that he knows and this is our call this is our call we have it it's in our hand yes we saw that the symbolism of it it was handed to the prophet it was handed to us everything that happened there was for our sake we are not here because of the Prophet The Prophet came because of us praise the name of the Lord and so this is how it went that he fought he went on the offense and he got addicted to the word praise the name of the Living God 11. this is the third one of the first three now the first three are those that are called referred to in Chronicles as the mightiest and after him was Sharma the son of Iggy AJ the haral rights and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and still the Philistines and the Lord wrote a great victory so another food battle this time's lentils but it's still very important and they were going to fight over it but the people retreated but he stood alone he stood against that discouragement that comes when you are found alone he took a stand for the Lord Hallelujah now time is for I spent I'll read about two or three quotes and we are done but I just want to say this the Lord brought about a great victories it's repeated over and over and this is where I'm saying that the people are Avail themselves they committed themselves to the cause and the Lord brought about the victory it's not because they were smart they were healed they could fight they were they had some magical powers no it was God in them and that is what it is when you commit yourself to the cause of the Lord Hallelujah and so anyway I'll read this this is there is a man here that can turn on the library says and the list of David's thoughts was a command to those Gentiles for they a type of the gentle Church Hallelujah you see where the interest is he doesn't just say that a type of the gentle church today and so brother if God has called you he's left these things in the scripture for us to go by to know what is expected of us and I'm not saying we can do it but he has already done it before he can do it again in US all it takes is for us to yield to this word and understand the exclusivity of this word a type of the general shirt today Gallant men see those men who stood by David were gentiles but Gallant men they were Fearless they didn't even know what fear was one man took a sword and killed 800 men he was a gallant man a gentile looking upon anointed one that he knowed was coming into Power did you notice them being so Gallant to David when David finally came in power he made them ruler over cities didn't Jesus promise the same thing Hallelujah I'll just read two more quotes and then we are done oh God the coming of that great King Jesus and we realized God had we realized God that every one of those men that pulled that sword and fought for David when he was a fugitive when he came into Power he made them rulers overseas every one of them has cities and you promise that in the Bible that we would have cities oh God as Gentiles fell air through the Gentiles that we might be partakers of his Holiness and righteousness that is not it says let us today Lord as men Warriors take that word knowing that those who stand for him in this hour there will be rulers over cities not as we want to be rulers but we want to be servants to you Lord praise the name of the Lord I will invite the musicians as I read the last quote and this is Brother Abraham making a call he says I call for men Warriors who is not afraid I don't care if there's 800 standing on one side and 10 000 on the other I want Warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines my brother Brown qualifies it cut a line of a line of unbelievable citizens the World Council that's God garrisoned around the word of God trying to make it create and feed the people there is a well there's a fountain opening the House of David Bethlehem for sin and uncleanness brother sin is unbelief in his word who Warrior that can see the Millennium coming what Warrior can see this great Holy Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ the literal Body of Christ to take over again stand with me stand with me let's get a hold through this denominational Creed let's get in there he's crying for a good fresh drink of Pentecostal water or original Pentecost not a bunch of carrying on screaming hollering here I mean a genuine Holy Spirit baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ back into the person Hallelujah are we going to hit the call let's start on our feet Hallelujah he has to
