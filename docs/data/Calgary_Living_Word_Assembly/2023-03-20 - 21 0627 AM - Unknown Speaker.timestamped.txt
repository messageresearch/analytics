[51:04] diminish that thought Lord we never want
[51:06] to forget Lord Jesus what you have done

[52:04] directly to you we just ask all these
[52:07] things now in Jesus Christ name we pray
[52:10] amen
[52:12] God bless you this morning
[52:15] thank you musicians
[52:18] if you have your Bibles this morning I'd
[52:20] like to
[52:21] take a look at the book of Philippians
[52:25] if you could turn to Philippians chapter
[52:27] 2
[52:40] I trust that everyone's weak has gone
[52:42] well so far
[52:46] and here we have the highlight of our
[52:47] week as Believers to get together with
[52:50] believers
[52:52] Fellowship around the word with the word
[52:56] Philippians chapter 2.
[52:59] start reading with verse 1.
[53:03] if there be there for any consolation in
[53:06] Christ
[53:07] if any comfort of love
[53:09] if any Fellowship of the spirit
[53:12] if any bowels of Mercies
[53:15] fulfill ye my joy
[53:18] that ye be like-minded having the Same
[53:21] Love
[53:22] being of one Accord
[53:24] of one mind
[53:27] let nothing be done
[53:29] through Strife or vain Glory
[53:32] but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[53:36] other better than themselves
[53:39] look not every man on his own things
[53:42] but every man also on the things of
[53:44] others
[53:46] let this mind be in you
[53:49] which was also in Christ Jesus
[53:53] who
[53:54] being in the form of God
[53:57] thought it not robbery
[53:59] to be equal with God
[54:02] but made himself of no reputation
[54:05] and took upon him the form of a servant
[54:09] and was made in the likeness of men
[54:13] and being found in fashion as a man he
[54:16] humbled himself
[54:18] and became obedient unto death
[54:21] even the death of the cross
[54:24] let's turn over
[54:26] to Second Corinthians
[54:28] chapter 3.
[54:33] some very familiar scriptures
[54:37] these are taken directly out of
[54:41] the Mighty God unveiled
[54:46] second Corinthians chapter three we'll
[54:48] start reading with verse 6.
[54:54] who also hath made us able Ministers of
[54:57] the New Testament not of the letter
[55:00] but of the spirit
[55:03] for the letter killeth
[55:05] but the spirit giveth life
[55:09] but if the ministration of death written
[55:12] and engraven in Stones was glorious so
[55:15] that the children of Israel could not
[55:17] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[55:20] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[55:23] was to be done away
[55:26] how shall not the ministration of the
[55:30] spirit be rather glorious
[55:32] for if the administration
[55:35] of condemnation be glory
[55:37] much more doth administration of
[55:40] righteousness exceed in glory
[55:44] for even that which was made righteous
[55:47] had no glory in this Respect by reason
[55:50] of the glory that excellith
[55:55] for if that which is done away was
[55:57] glorious much more that which remaineth
[56:01] is glorious
[56:04] let's just bow
[56:06] gracious heavenly father was saying
[56:08] certainly thankful for your word
[56:10] Lord we know that we can turn back the
[56:13] pages of the Bible and read it carnally
[56:15] but father it takes your spirit to
[56:18] reveal it to us
[56:20] so father we pray that as we turn back
[56:22] the pages of the Bible today Lord as we
[56:25] read read the words written therein that
[56:28] father you would just reveal them to us
[56:29] Lord we pray that you would just bring
[56:32] out the the compound meanings and the
[56:34] compound Revelations to us today Father
[56:36] Lord that father I could get out of the
[56:39] way and just allow you father to
[56:40] minister to us Lord that the the spirit
[56:43] would be in continuity today Lord that
[56:46] there would be nothing Lord that would
[56:48] stand in the way of what you want to
[56:50] have said today and father if there's
[56:52] anything that would be contrary to your
[56:54] spirit now we just pray that father we
[56:57] could rebuke it in the name of Jesus
[56:58] Christ Lord if there's anything that
[57:00] would try and exalt itself against your
[57:02] word today Father we pray that we could
[57:04] just cast it down in Jesus name and Lord
[57:07] just give you all the glory that you
[57:09] desire we pray that you would just speak
[57:11] to us now sovereignly father by Your
[57:14] Word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[57:17] God bless you you may be seated this
[57:19] morning
[57:22] just before we get into the word we have
[57:25] a couple of announcements
[57:27] um
[57:28] a few announcements in fact
[57:31] next week Sunday July the 4th it looks
[57:35] like we will return to regular services
[57:39] which I find astounding I
[57:42] I mean
[57:43] here we are I'm sure that everyone
[57:45] probably feels that way as well
[57:47] it's felt like almost an eternity going
[57:50] through this covid the last
[57:53] a year and a bit has been certainly
[57:55] challenging for everyone
[57:57] and uh you know we've we've made it
[58:00] through God has seen fit for us to go
[58:03] through this and he's brought us through
[58:05] it and now we go forwards together and
[58:09] we certainly trust that uh whatever he
[58:12] wanted to have accomplished through it
[58:14] has been accomplished
[58:16] that's why it's going to disappear why
[58:18] it's going to be over and we will go
[58:20] forwards
[58:21] nothing happens by accident there's no
[58:25] mistakes
[58:26] there's no accidental things that go on
[58:28] in our lives in this world around us
[58:31] it's all for a purpose
[58:33] amen we're certainly thankful to be a
[58:35] part of his purpose
[58:37] so next week July 4th next Sunday we'll
[58:41] return to regular services and I would
[58:44] say just look for a calendar it will be
[58:46] coming out in short order
[58:49] and uh
[58:50] I think it's going to be wonderful
[58:53] it's going to be absolutely wonderful to
[58:55] see the church fill up
[58:57] on on that wise brother Peter is
[59:01] planning to put the chairs back into the
[59:03] sanctuary and we just wondered if there
[59:05] was a couple of brothers or a few
[59:07] brothers that were interested in helping
[59:09] out a little bit that would certainly
[59:10] help brother Peter we just wanted to put
[59:13] that out there many hands make light
[59:16] work and uh I know carrying chairs can
[59:19] be a little bit monotonous but I don't
[59:22] think it would take very long to put the
[59:23] rest of the chairs back in here so if we
[59:25] could just consult brother Peter
[59:27] we'll get all the chairs back in here
[59:29] and we'll just see if we can't get all
[59:32] the people back in here
[59:35] we know that uh
[59:37] yeah it's amazing I actually feel
[59:39] nervous about having church again
[59:42] um it's been such a strange thing to go
[59:44] from Full Church to you know no church
[59:48] virtual Church to a few people in church
[59:51] and more people in church and now here
[59:54] we are and uh hopefully we can get rid
[59:56] of the groups and uh not see people
[1:00:00] click but have one body in one mind and
[1:00:04] one Accord everybody getting to
[1:00:06] fellowship with everyone once again
[1:00:08] that's what we want to see
[1:00:11] we're certainly excited about the the
[1:00:13] word today and uh we just trust that the
[1:00:15] Lord will bless it to our spiritual
[1:00:17] nourishment as I mentioned I've really
[1:00:20] been inspired by the message uh the
[1:00:22] Mighty God unveiled and the unveiling of
[1:00:25] God and it just hasn't really gone away
[1:00:27] you know we've talked about the the
[1:00:30] bread of life last week and uh I'm
[1:00:34] certainly not out of the Book of John
[1:00:35] and and I just have to go the way the
[1:00:37] Lord leads me and it sometimes feels I'm
[1:00:40] sure like I'm just bouncing around like
[1:00:42] a ping pong ball but I know it's all
[1:00:45] God's word and we just trust that his
[1:00:48] will is being accomplished the way this
[1:00:50] is happening so
[1:00:52] um the Mighty God unveiled it's
[1:00:54] tremendous message
[1:00:56] before that though before we get into
[1:00:58] that very far I just want to talk about
[1:01:00] the word unveiled and you know years ago
[1:01:04] we talked about it how brother Ken he
[1:01:06] did that that that that
[1:01:09] I don't even know what it was a statue I
[1:01:10] think it was just on a pedestal at the
[1:01:12] front of the church and he had it
[1:01:14] covered it was veiled and and it was
[1:01:16] such an amazing display of this topic
[1:01:20] and uh I I don't even know if we could
[1:01:23] find that message it certainly would be
[1:01:24] good to listen to but just to to know
[1:01:27] that the word unveiled is a powerful one
[1:01:31] in terms of the message of the hour if
[1:01:33] you look up the word unveiled uh it's
[1:01:36] great you get some really really good
[1:01:38] quotes
[1:01:39] um what sort of goes hand in hand with
[1:01:41] that is the word in morphe I'm sure that
[1:01:45] many people have looked that up as well
[1:01:47] it's mentioned 19 times in the message
[1:01:49] the word Amore brother Branham talks
[1:01:52] about it about it being a part of uh
[1:01:54] maybe a show or a play and and how
[1:01:57] there's many different people in it but
[1:01:59] sometimes one person will play a few
[1:02:02] different roles in in the same play and
[1:02:05] what they do is they change costumes
[1:02:07] they change masks and brothers and
[1:02:09] sisters in in my true fashion here we go
[1:02:12] with a punch line that's what God has
[1:02:13] done throughout all of the ages and
[1:02:15] that's what we're talking about today
[1:02:16] God unveiled before our eyes
[1:02:21] we know that he's done it uh throughout
[1:02:23] the ages in many different ways and I I
[1:02:26] just think with this topic we'll
[1:02:28] probably just sort of take our time and
[1:02:30] go through it and uh and not really jump
[1:02:33] too far ahead so Lord willing we'll see
[1:02:36] what happens today
[1:02:38] um but just talking about the word
[1:02:40] unveiled
[1:02:42] in order to be unveiled first there has
[1:02:45] to be a veil
[1:02:47] there has to be a covering
[1:02:49] there has to be something
[1:02:52] hidden
[1:02:53] in order for it to be veiled
[1:02:55] and it's interesting when we we talk
[1:02:58] about this scripture we could probably
[1:02:59] just carry on here in second Corinthians
[1:03:02] chapter three I'd like to read a little
[1:03:04] further
[1:03:05] I didn't want to keep everyone standing
[1:03:06] it's a bit of a long reading but uh
[1:03:09] we'll just continue on
[1:03:12] from verse 11.
[1:03:14] brother Branham talks he reads these two
[1:03:17] scriptures out of Philippians and out of
[1:03:18] second Corinthians in uh in the Mighty
[1:03:21] God unveiled in 1964.
[1:03:25] so chapter three of second Corinthians
[1:03:27] verse 11 for if that which is done away
[1:03:30] was glorious
[1:03:32] much more that which remaineth is
[1:03:36] glorious
[1:03:37] brothers and sisters
[1:03:39] there's something that remaineth today
[1:03:43] verse 12 seeing then that we have such
[1:03:47] hope
[1:03:48] we use great plainness
[1:03:50] plainness of speech
[1:03:54] and not as Moses which put a veil over
[1:03:57] his face that the children of Israel
[1:04:00] could not steadfastly look to the end of
[1:04:03] that which is abolished
[1:04:05] but their minds were blinded
[1:04:08] for until this day remaineth the same
[1:04:10] Veil untaken away in the reading of the
[1:04:13] Old Testament which Veil is done away in
[1:04:16] Christ
[1:04:18] but even unto this day when Moses is
[1:04:21] read
[1:04:22] the veil is upon their heart
[1:04:26] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:04:29] Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:04:34] you know talking about this it's
[1:04:37] speaking about the Book of Revelation
[1:04:40] and when those two witnesses go back to
[1:04:42] Israel
[1:04:43] that's when this gospel that we're
[1:04:45] talking about will go back there and
[1:04:48] this gospel
[1:04:49] preached to the Jews will take away the
[1:04:52] Veil
[1:04:53] from the Jews
[1:04:56] it's interesting though because with
[1:04:58] that Veil there verse 15 says but even
[1:05:01] unto this day
[1:05:04] it's almost like when when we think
[1:05:06] about it I've thought about this quite a
[1:05:08] bit but when we think about it it's
[1:05:10] almost like the Jews just have a veil
[1:05:12] and the veil is over them and everything
[1:05:14] is there but what the word is saying
[1:05:16] here that when the book of Moses is read
[1:05:19] it causes the veil to happen
[1:05:22] it's not like they just have the blanket
[1:05:24] Veil over top of them like we talked
[1:05:26] about with the the display that brother
[1:05:28] Ken did although they do spiritually
[1:05:31] speaking their minds are blinded to the
[1:05:33] gospel that we believe which is Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:05:37] forever but even unto this day when
[1:05:40] Moses is read
[1:05:42] the veil is upon their heart
[1:05:44] it causes a block those cherubims that
[1:05:47] were placed in the Garden of Eden to
[1:05:50] block the way back to the Tree of Life
[1:05:52] those cherubims now are opening the way
[1:05:55] of life to us back to the Tree of Life
[1:05:58] pushing back all the powers of Darkness
[1:06:00] making a path for us to go right back to
[1:06:03] where we're supposed to be but the
[1:06:05] children of Israel they actually still
[1:06:07] guard the way back to the Tree of Life
[1:06:09] they can't go past those angels those
[1:06:12] cherubims but there's coming a day
[1:06:15] brothers and sisters
[1:06:16] when we're taken out
[1:06:18] where that gospel this gospel will go
[1:06:20] right back to them and those cherubims
[1:06:22] will then step back and they will Usher
[1:06:25] in
[1:06:26] the children of Israel to the Tree of
[1:06:27] Life
[1:06:31] verse 12 seeing that we
[1:06:34] have such hope we use great plainness of
[1:06:37] speech
[1:06:39] just like Paul said we don't
[1:06:41] come to you with cunningly devised
[1:06:44] Fables
[1:06:46] and the Excellence of man's Wisdom
[1:06:49] we're not interested in that we're
[1:06:51] interested in the power and the
[1:06:53] demonstration of the spirit
[1:06:56] if we read verse 17 and 18.
[1:07:01] now the Lord is Spirit
[1:07:04] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:07:06] there is Liberty
[1:07:08] in the footnote in my Bible says freedom
[1:07:12] brothers and sisters we won't always
[1:07:13] have this freedom
[1:07:15] to my way of thinking I think that's my
[1:07:17] takeaway from covid
[1:07:19] people get sick and people get
[1:07:21] vaccinated and all that stuff but you
[1:07:23] know what really rang true with me I got
[1:07:25] voted in to be a pastor and I think it
[1:07:27] was six weeks after that
[1:07:30] it was turned off
[1:07:32] my takeaway is one of these days it will
[1:07:35] be just like that overnight Everything
[1:07:37] Will Change
[1:07:38] it will not not be the same so what I'm
[1:07:41] getting to brothers and sisters just
[1:07:43] from verse 17 is where the spirit of the
[1:07:46] Lord is there is Liberty if there's the
[1:07:48] spirit of Lord here today then brothers
[1:07:49] and sisters you should have Liberty we
[1:07:51] should have freedom to worship there is
[1:07:54] no judgment there is therefore now no
[1:07:56] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[1:07:58] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:08:00] after the spirit if we are here and we
[1:08:03] have the Lord Jesus Christ here then
[1:08:05] brothers and sisters there should be
[1:08:07] Liberty to worship we should have the
[1:08:09] ability to jump up and down to Scream
[1:08:11] and Shout Whatever it is whatever you
[1:08:13] feel like doing I don't think anybody's
[1:08:15] going to put a restriction on it in fact
[1:08:17] I would say if you have an inclination
[1:08:20] to say something to do something if it's
[1:08:22] going to be in the spirit then brothers
[1:08:25] or sisters just go for it
[1:08:28] there is there is no judgment I think we
[1:08:31] have such a tremendous opportunity here
[1:08:33] if we talk about some of the people
[1:08:35] around the world who are persecuted just
[1:08:37] for being a Christian just to say that
[1:08:39] they're a Christian whether they're
[1:08:40] Roman Catholic or or whether they're
[1:08:42] Anglican or whether they're Pentecostal
[1:08:44] or Baptist or whether they're message
[1:08:46] believing if you say the word Jesus
[1:08:48] Christ and in part of your language and
[1:08:50] you say that's what I stand for you are
[1:08:52] heavily persecuted and here we are here
[1:08:56] we are in the land of the free we can
[1:08:58] worship freely speak about the things
[1:09:00] that so many so many Ages were longed
[1:09:04] for so many different people desire to
[1:09:06] see it and we have it all in our hands
[1:09:10] Verse 18 but we all with open face
[1:09:14] beholding as in a glass
[1:09:17] the glory of the Lord
[1:09:19] are changed into the same image from
[1:09:22] glory to glory
[1:09:24] even as by the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:28] where that Liberty is we are changed
[1:09:31] brothers and sisters we become new
[1:09:33] creatures in Christ Jesus we don't
[1:09:35] remain the same
[1:09:36] remember how they were on the day of
[1:09:38] Pentecost
[1:09:39] the 120 in the upper room
[1:09:42] they came out in the middle of the day
[1:09:44] and they were called drunk people
[1:09:46] they said oh they've been into the
[1:09:47] communion wine
[1:09:48] they must have had a real good community
[1:09:50] in there and just had a couple extra
[1:09:52] drinks
[1:09:53] maybe they did it the Roman Catholic way
[1:09:55] I had someone telling me this a little
[1:09:57] while ago for communion that uh they
[1:10:00] don't even drink the wine if it's wine
[1:10:02] that they drink the priest drinks the
[1:10:04] wine for each person that goes through
[1:10:06] the line
[1:10:08] you'd be stumbling out of there at the
[1:10:10] end of it
[1:10:11] but brothers and sisters
[1:10:13] when that stimulation of Revelation hits
[1:10:17] you you don't act like a normal person
[1:10:20] you can't
[1:10:21] how can we act like a normal person how
[1:10:24] can we just be the same
[1:10:27] it's impossible
[1:10:30] we have uh
[1:10:32] such a great cloud of witness
[1:10:35] all around us it's tremendous to be a
[1:10:37] part of it
[1:10:40] speaking about unveiled
[1:10:42] I'm just going to take time and and talk
[1:10:44] about some quotes
[1:10:46] about being unveiled and and we'll just
[1:10:48] see what the Lord will do here out of
[1:10:50] Jesus arose in 1956.
[1:10:53] so way before the seals were open
[1:10:57] Jesus arose and God raised him up and
[1:11:01] put him so high above
[1:11:03] every Heaven speaking about Jesus Christ
[1:11:05] here
[1:11:06] and God raised him up and put him so
[1:11:08] high above every Heaven until he has to
[1:11:10] stoop over
[1:11:12] to look to heaven
[1:11:13] that's what God did for him
[1:11:17] so if you want to be exalted humble
[1:11:19] yourself
[1:11:21] and if you exalt yourself
[1:11:23] you'll be brought down low
[1:11:26] and I think of him
[1:11:28] that when he had risen from the dead
[1:11:30] that morning
[1:11:32] that he was then
[1:11:35] had his own blood as the high priest
[1:11:38] and he went beyond the veils
[1:11:41] through every sphere
[1:11:43] Satan in the times past had men blocked
[1:11:46] off from heaven
[1:11:49] Satan
[1:11:50] in times past had men blocked off from
[1:11:53] heaven
[1:11:54] today
[1:11:56] Satan
[1:11:57] has men blocked off from Heaven how does
[1:12:01] that happen
[1:12:02] their minds become veiled their minds
[1:12:05] become blinded
[1:12:07] and you know what does it today
[1:12:10] is tradition
[1:12:12] Traditions will block our minds
[1:12:16] from what the message of the hour truly
[1:12:18] is
[1:12:19] Traditions will keep us from actually
[1:12:21] going all the way in to the inner Veil
[1:12:26] Satan in times past had men blocked off
[1:12:29] from heaven
[1:12:30] he could not get in contact with heaven
[1:12:33] but when Jesus
[1:12:35] took his blood
[1:12:38] the first Veil he rent was the veil of
[1:12:40] death
[1:12:42] I love how he goes through this and
[1:12:44] talks about the different veils
[1:12:46] this is out of
[1:12:49] Jesus arose in 1956.
[1:12:53] when Jesus took his blood the first Veil
[1:12:56] he rent was the veil of death
[1:12:59] and the veil of the grave
[1:13:03] and the veil in the temple
[1:13:07] he made it an open display
[1:13:10] that when he was
[1:13:12] dead on the cross in his flesh
[1:13:15] when he bowed his head and said it is
[1:13:17] finished when his body gave up the ghost
[1:13:20] he said to his father into thy hands do
[1:13:23] I commit my spirit
[1:13:25] when that happened
[1:13:27] we know that he went right into the
[1:13:29] temple and he rent the Veil from bottom
[1:13:32] to top from top to bottom tore it
[1:13:36] and you know everyone at the time who
[1:13:38] were involved with that they knew what
[1:13:40] was going on but they didn't want to
[1:13:42] admit it
[1:13:43] the priests they knew what was going on
[1:13:45] they didn't want to admit it
[1:13:48] and how did they know the proof of it is
[1:13:50] that they tried to bribe the guards at
[1:13:53] the end
[1:13:54] they told them don't say anything to
[1:13:57] anyone we'll give you a lot of money if
[1:13:58] you just shut your mouths and say that
[1:14:00] it was the disciples that took his body
[1:14:02] they knew what happened how did that
[1:14:04] Veil get torn from the top to the bottom
[1:14:06] in the temple
[1:14:08] could you imagine someone going into the
[1:14:10] temple in that day Jesus couldn't go
[1:14:12] into the temple and speak words speak
[1:14:14] the truth the word couldn't go into the
[1:14:16] temple and actually preach the word
[1:14:19] without there being a great problem How
[1:14:22] could somebody go into the temple and
[1:14:24] tear the Veil
[1:14:25] to the holy of holies
[1:14:28] it's amazing to think about but that was
[1:14:31] the first stop that he made
[1:14:33] after he conquered death
[1:14:35] and after he conquered the grave
[1:14:38] he just bypassed both of those it's
[1:14:40] amazing to think about hey went right
[1:14:43] into the temple and tore the veil in two
[1:14:45] and said now it's finished now there is
[1:14:48] a way back to the tree of life now I
[1:14:51] have provided that way and I'm going to
[1:14:53] tell the Angels the cherubims to step
[1:14:56] aside those flaming swords just take one
[1:14:58] step back for the Gentile bride now has
[1:15:01] access to the Tree of Life which they
[1:15:04] didn't have before
[1:15:07] his blood the first Veil he rent was the
[1:15:10] veil of death and the veil of the grave
[1:15:14] the veil in the temple
[1:15:17] and then he just sort of brings it a
[1:15:19] little further down I love this part the
[1:15:22] veil of the temple and then the veil of
[1:15:25] sickness
[1:15:26] think about that brothers and sisters
[1:15:29] by my stripes
[1:15:32] are ye healed
[1:15:34] he says it both ways in the Bible by my
[1:15:36] stripes were ye healed and by my stripes
[1:15:40] are ye healed present tense and past
[1:15:43] tense
[1:15:44] both of those
[1:15:46] sickness the veil of sickness he rented
[1:15:49] brothers and sisters it's torn
[1:15:53] the veil of fear
[1:15:56] he took the veil of fear and tore it
[1:16:00] for we have not been given the spirit
[1:16:03] again to bondage of fear
[1:16:06] but we've been given the spirit of power
[1:16:08] and of love and of a sound mind brothers
[1:16:12] and sisters if we are starting to fear
[1:16:15] if we're starting to have anxiety come
[1:16:17] over our bodies if we're starting to
[1:16:19] fear something's happening to us that we
[1:16:22] can control and and things are feeling
[1:16:24] out of control and and we have this
[1:16:26] overwhelming fear brothers and sisters
[1:16:28] it's an attack of the devil it's an
[1:16:31] Affliction of Satan it's a Tormentor of
[1:16:33] a devil coming upon you and you have the
[1:16:36] ability to say Satan I rebuke you in the
[1:16:39] name of Jesus Christ and you know what
[1:16:40] sometimes brothers and sisters we don't
[1:16:42] even have the ability to say that and
[1:16:44] I'll say it because I've witnessed it
[1:16:45] I've experienced it I don't understand
[1:16:47] it at the time I didn't understand it
[1:16:50] sometimes we don't understand it but you
[1:16:52] know we can always pick up the phone and
[1:16:54] say brother or sister can you pray with
[1:16:56] me I don't know what's going on in my
[1:16:58] life I have this great fear I have this
[1:17:00] great anxiety in my life but you know
[1:17:02] what Satan doesn't want us to do that
[1:17:03] Satan will say no if you do that you're
[1:17:05] weak if you if you call someone and you
[1:17:08] say that you're afraid or you're scared
[1:17:10] or you've got something going on in your
[1:17:11] life
[1:17:13] they'll talk about you they'll say
[1:17:15] you're weak
[1:17:16] oh yeah they'll they'll they'll pray
[1:17:18] with you all right and then they'll
[1:17:19] phone their other brothers and sisters
[1:17:21] and say oh look at the pastor he needs
[1:17:23] prayer for something he's a weakling
[1:17:25] you know what that is brothers and
[1:17:27] sisters that's Satan
[1:17:28] that's the devil
[1:17:30] that's the devil if you want to call
[1:17:32] someone and talk to someone we should be
[1:17:34] able to call any one of our brothers and
[1:17:35] sisters and talk to them about just
[1:17:37] about anything within reason and not
[1:17:40] have any fear that someone's gonna go
[1:17:42] and talk I'm towards about another
[1:17:43] brother or sister in fact I think
[1:17:46] there's even a quote we should be so
[1:17:47] close that we should be able to just
[1:17:49] like chew each other's gum right isn't
[1:17:52] that what the prophet said
[1:17:55] I'm not going to recommend that we turn
[1:17:57] that into a Doctrine
[1:18:02] and I I just won't even say any more
[1:18:04] about it
[1:18:06] but
[1:18:08] you know what if it's what God wanted
[1:18:09] then hey
[1:18:12] pass out the gum right
[1:18:15] we won't die from it
[1:18:17] and you know
[1:18:19] pre-covet we would actually drink wine
[1:18:22] from the same cup
[1:18:25] now I'm getting into Muddy Waters
[1:18:28] now I'm painting myself right into a
[1:18:30] corner aren't I you know what I'm not
[1:18:32] I'm not going to suggest that we start
[1:18:33] doing that right away
[1:18:35] just for the record I think we'll keep
[1:18:36] things just the way they are
[1:18:38] keep things steady as they go we'll just
[1:18:40] use individual cups
[1:18:42] I I don't want to see any problems
[1:18:45] happen but you know brothers and sisters
[1:18:47] there is coming a time where we're going
[1:18:48] to have to look past all of the flesh
[1:18:50] all of the cares of this life every
[1:18:53] single thing that tends to bother us and
[1:18:55] and we worry about and are afraid of and
[1:18:57] just move past it because we we can read
[1:18:59] what a Vindicated Prophet said what
[1:19:01] happened when Jesus gave his blood for
[1:19:04] our lives all of these different veils
[1:19:06] were torn they weren't just taken and
[1:19:08] put aside they were torn they were
[1:19:10] destroyed veils brothers and sisters
[1:19:12] sickness has no power over top of Our
[1:19:15] Lives you know what Satan Satan could
[1:19:18] come around and and say to God you know
[1:19:20] I would even go so farther is to say
[1:19:22] this like job The Book of Job it wasn't
[1:19:25] even Satan that said it God said to
[1:19:28] Satan have you considered my servant job
[1:19:31] think about that God might come down and
[1:19:34] say have you considered my servant Barry
[1:19:37] have you considered him huh
[1:19:40] why don't you go and have a go at him
[1:19:43] and Satan will say oh yeah I'll get him
[1:19:45] to curse you to your face and you'll say
[1:19:47] no you won't
[1:19:48] you can't do it do whatever you want but
[1:19:51] don't touch his life
[1:19:53] destroy everything this is crazy because
[1:19:56] I'm making it personal it's not about
[1:19:58] job
[1:19:59] it's about me and brothers and sisters
[1:20:01] it's got to be about you
[1:20:03] it's got to be a personal experience
[1:20:06] we've got to understand that that's the
[1:20:08] way it works
[1:20:10] it's not uh some accidental thing that's
[1:20:12] going on there's a council in heaven
[1:20:14] about every single one of our thoughts
[1:20:16] let alone Our Lives
[1:20:19] it's beyond beyond or even comprehension
[1:20:22] but to think about it
[1:20:24] God will say have you considered my
[1:20:26] servant
[1:20:28] you can't get them to curse you to my
[1:20:30] face you can't do it
[1:20:32] and even to the place where he'll say go
[1:20:35] ahead take his life
[1:20:38] and you know what we'll have someone
[1:20:40] stand at their post of duty till they
[1:20:42] can't even stand anymore
[1:20:44] preaching the gospel because they know
[1:20:47] Satan can't touch them
[1:20:52] it's got to be that way for each and
[1:20:53] every one of us brothers and sisters to
[1:20:55] know that you can't touch me Satan
[1:20:58] and you know what if if God wants you to
[1:21:00] be able to do that then it's going to be
[1:21:01] for you his glory and I say Bring It On
[1:21:05] Hallelujah
[1:21:07] we don't want to Race Across The Finish
[1:21:08] Line we don't want to race to the bottom
[1:21:10] we're not talking about that don't don't
[1:21:12] put me in the grave Lord but whether I
[1:21:14] live or whether I die I'm Christ
[1:21:16] and Satan isn't going to change that
[1:21:18] testimony that will never happen because
[1:21:21] I know that that veil of death is rent I
[1:21:24] know that's happened I know that the
[1:21:26] veil of the Grave is rent I know that
[1:21:28] the veil of sickness is rent I know that
[1:21:31] the veil of fear is rent
[1:21:34] and every single Veil that there was
[1:21:39] his rent
[1:21:41] brother Bradham says this the veil of
[1:21:42] fear I'll just read this again his blood
[1:21:45] the first Veil he read was the veil of
[1:21:47] death the veil of the Grave the veil in
[1:21:49] the temple and then the veil of sickness
[1:21:51] the veil of fear and every Veil that
[1:21:54] there was everyone
[1:21:59] an unveiled God to man
[1:22:04] unveiled God to man
[1:22:07] now this is in 1956 remember this is
[1:22:11] pre-seals
[1:22:13] this is free brother Bradham the prophet
[1:22:16] for our day speaking and morphe
[1:22:19] he didn't speak that until 64.
[1:22:22] he didn't speak it until his third pull
[1:22:25] of his ministry
[1:22:28] sorry I
[1:22:30] get a little excited about it but he
[1:22:33] went way above
[1:22:35] he went way in above the heavens of
[1:22:37] heaven and was Seated on the right hand
[1:22:39] of God and set down as a finished work
[1:22:43] and you know brothers and sisters we
[1:22:44] said it already I'll say it again though
[1:22:46] but if we are
[1:22:47] in Christ Jesus then we are already
[1:22:50] seated down with him right now that's
[1:22:52] what the word says
[1:22:54] and and when that spirit of fear comes
[1:22:56] knocking on our door when that Spirit of
[1:22:58] sickness comes knocking on our door we
[1:23:01] need to push those thoughts back and we
[1:23:03] just need to say hey you know what can
[1:23:05] sickness come and sit down with Jesus
[1:23:07] Christ in heaven can fear come and sit
[1:23:10] down with Jesus Christ in heaven those
[1:23:12] veils have been torn and there's no room
[1:23:14] for for them to be there there's no
[1:23:16] seats for fear or sickness in heaven
[1:23:20] there isn't
[1:23:22] brother Adam says that's right all above
[1:23:25] and there he opened up a channel that
[1:23:27] God used to come down
[1:23:29] through the corridors of heaven and talk
[1:23:32] to Mankind in the Garden of Eden
[1:23:35] huh
[1:23:36] that story back in Genesis
[1:23:39] and Satan by sin had blocked them
[1:23:44] he did
[1:23:45] Satan came in and blocked that access he
[1:23:49] thought that he had it figured out
[1:23:51] he was created to be a worthy adversary
[1:23:55] but he could never beat God never
[1:24:01] Satan by sin had blocked them
[1:24:04] but the great high priest
[1:24:06] with his Anointed with his blood
[1:24:10] went through every Veil and ripped her
[1:24:12] open and cleared out the skies again
[1:24:16] that God and man could be father and son
[1:24:20] and commune again with one another
[1:24:24] what a marvelous thing he says
[1:24:28] what a marvelous thing
[1:24:30] Brother Brad I'm talking about this back
[1:24:32] in 56 just as a historical discussion
[1:24:35] now
[1:24:36] thinking about this he's talking about
[1:24:39] it from a theological standpoint
[1:24:42] he is a prophet and he has that rock of
[1:24:45] Revelation I'm not demeaning that or
[1:24:47] taking away from that in any way
[1:24:50] but I think that it changes a little bit
[1:24:51] when we get into
[1:24:53] the unveiling of God in 64. and the
[1:24:57] Mighty God unveiled after that
[1:25:01] it's it's it's wonderful thing and and
[1:25:03] like he said what a marvelous thing he's
[1:25:06] not taking away from what he taught
[1:25:08] later on he's actually speaking the same
[1:25:11] thing but he certainly Builds on what
[1:25:13] he's talking about here that God and man
[1:25:15] could be father and son and commune
[1:25:18] again
[1:25:20] with one another
[1:25:23] it just brings to mind the scripture
[1:25:24] behold
[1:25:25] what manner of love
[1:25:27] the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:25:30] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:25:33] to think that he has people that he has
[1:25:36] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:25:37] world to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:25:41] and you know
[1:25:42] I'll just say it I'll sprinkle it
[1:25:44] throughout over and over again I just I
[1:25:47] have to I feel like it it's just what I
[1:25:50] feel led to do I think if I had a
[1:25:52] Ministry I think this would be it
[1:25:53] brothers and sisters is just to
[1:25:54] recognize that you are the unveiling of
[1:25:57] God
[1:25:59] the people in every single Age We Know
[1:26:01] It the seven Church age book speaks of
[1:26:03] it its continuity goes from the
[1:26:05] beginning of the Bible right through to
[1:26:06] the end of the Bible every single story
[1:26:09] in the Bible is an example of God's own
[1:26:12] life on Earth
[1:26:13] every single one is an example of the
[1:26:16] supernatural god making himself known to
[1:26:20] man
[1:26:21] brothers and sisters it's the Mighty God
[1:26:23] unveiled in every single age and every
[1:26:25] single age had a certain amount of light
[1:26:27] allotted to it a certain amount of word
[1:26:30] allotted to it but you know today
[1:26:31] brothers and sisters even though it is
[1:26:33] the skinniest teeniest little sliver of
[1:26:36] light is what brother Branham said maybe
[1:26:38] not on those exact words the tiniest
[1:26:40] amount of light
[1:26:42] it's the most amount of Revelation
[1:26:45] out of all the ages the culmination of
[1:26:48] all of the ages worth of Revelation in
[1:26:51] our day today
[1:26:53] it's a marvelous thing is what brother
[1:26:55] Branham says
[1:26:57] talking about the uh the veil and and
[1:27:00] how their minds were blinded
[1:27:03] out of second Corinthians here
[1:27:09] let's just read it again second
[1:27:11] Corinthians we'll just read from verse
[1:27:12] six all the way through we've got lots
[1:27:15] of time
[1:27:18] second Corinthians
[1:27:20] chapter 3 verse 6.
[1:27:25] who also hath made us able Ministers of
[1:27:28] the New Testament
[1:27:29] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[1:27:32] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:27:35] life
[1:27:36] speaking about the law and Grace right
[1:27:40] there verse seven but if the
[1:27:42] ministration of death written and
[1:27:44] engraven in Stones was glorious so that
[1:27:46] the children of Israel could not
[1:27:48] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[1:27:51] the glory of his countenance
[1:27:53] which Glory
[1:27:55] was to be done away
[1:27:57] how shall not the ministration of the
[1:27:59] spirit be rather glorious
[1:28:02] for if the administration of
[1:28:04] condemnation be glory
[1:28:06] much more death administration of
[1:28:09] righteousness exceed in glory for even
[1:28:12] that which was made glorious had no
[1:28:14] glory in this Respect by the reason of
[1:28:17] the glory that excellith for if that
[1:28:20] which is done away was glorious much
[1:28:22] more that which remaineth is glorious
[1:28:25] seeing then that we have such hope we
[1:28:28] use great plainness of speech and not as
[1:28:31] Moses which put a veil over his face
[1:28:34] that the children of Israel could not
[1:28:36] steadfastly look to the end of that
[1:28:39] which is abolished
[1:28:41] but their minds were blinded For unto
[1:28:43] this day remaineth the same Veil untaken
[1:28:46] away in the reading of the Old Testament
[1:28:48] which Veil is done away in Christ but
[1:28:51] even unto this day when Moses is read
[1:28:53] the veil is upon their heart
[1:28:55] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:28:57] Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:29:00] now the Lord is that spirit
[1:29:03] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:29:06] there is Liberty
[1:29:08] but we all with open face beholding in a
[1:29:11] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[1:29:15] into the same image from glory to glory
[1:29:17] even as by the spirit of the Lord
[1:29:22] looking at this scripture
[1:29:25] knowing
[1:29:28] that Moses he put a veil over his face
[1:29:31] that the children of Israel could not
[1:29:34] steadfastly
[1:29:35] look to the end of that which is
[1:29:37] abolished
[1:29:40] he's speaking about two things there
[1:29:43] one of them is when Moses came down off
[1:29:46] the mount when Moses came out of the
[1:29:49] Temple the other one
[1:29:51] is understanding that there will come a
[1:29:53] time where the law will end and Grace
[1:29:56] will go back to the children of Israel
[1:29:59] let's turn let's turn over to the Book
[1:30:01] of Exodus chapter 33 and just talk about
[1:30:04] this
[1:30:06] very specifically verse 13 as you turn
[1:30:09] over to Exodus
[1:30:11] chapter 33.
[1:30:21] just want to take a little bit of time
[1:30:23] and and talk about this
[1:30:25] because I feel there's just so much here
[1:30:30] we'll just start reading with verse 11
[1:30:31] out of Exodus chapter 33.
[1:30:38] and the Lord spake unto Moses face to
[1:30:41] face as a man speaketh unto his friend
[1:30:45] can you imagine that
[1:30:47] just that right there I believe we could
[1:30:48] stop and have a service
[1:30:51] to think that the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:30:54] face to face as a man speaketh unto his
[1:30:58] friend
[1:30:59] you know what where the spirit of the
[1:31:01] Lord is there's liberty
[1:31:03] if we have the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:31:04] and we speak to our brother we speak to
[1:31:06] our sister
[1:31:07] brothers and sisters we speak as the
[1:31:10] Oracles of God
[1:31:12] we need to remember that when we're
[1:31:14] talking to one another we're talking to
[1:31:16] a son of the most high God a daughter of
[1:31:18] the most high God don't allow Satan to
[1:31:21] put thoughts in our minds to come
[1:31:22] against that because every time that
[1:31:24] happens brothers and sisters if it seems
[1:31:26] to happen a lot I just want to throw
[1:31:28] this out there I don't even know why but
[1:31:29] I just feel led to go this way if it
[1:31:32] feels that way where you just have these
[1:31:33] thoughts about someone you know what it
[1:31:35] is it's because they are truly a son or
[1:31:37] daughter of God and you know what's
[1:31:39] happening is Satan is trying to get in
[1:31:40] the middle of you he's trying to mix it
[1:31:42] all up and get it all upset
[1:31:44] do the opposite is what the prophet
[1:31:46] taught
[1:31:47] do the opposite see what happens
[1:31:49] and the Lord spake unto Moses face to
[1:31:52] face as a man speaketh unto his friend
[1:31:55] and he turned again into the camp but
[1:31:58] his servant Joshua the son of none a
[1:32:00] young man departed not out of the
[1:32:02] Tabernacle he wasn't leaving that
[1:32:04] Shekinah Glory for nothing
[1:32:06] and Moses said unto the Lord see thou
[1:32:09] sayest unto me bring up these people and
[1:32:11] thou Hast not let me know with whom thou
[1:32:14] Wilt send with me yet thou Hast said I
[1:32:17] Know Thee by name and thou Hast also
[1:32:19] found Grace in my sight
[1:32:21] now therefore I pray thee if I have
[1:32:24] found Grace in thy sight show me now thy
[1:32:28] way that I may Know Thee that I may find
[1:32:31] Grace in thy sight and consider that
[1:32:34] this nation is thy people
[1:32:37] and he said my presence shall go with
[1:32:39] thee and I will give thee rest and he
[1:32:43] said unto him If thy presence go not
[1:32:45] with me carry us not up hence
[1:32:48] for when shall it be known here that I
[1:32:53] and thy people have found Grace in thy
[1:32:55] sight
[1:32:57] is it not
[1:32:58] in that thou goest with us
[1:33:01] so shall we be separated
[1:33:03] I and thy people
[1:33:06] from all the people that are upon the
[1:33:08] face of the Earth
[1:33:10] and the Lord said unto Moses I will do
[1:33:13] this thing also that thou Hast spoken
[1:33:17] for thou Hast found Grace in my sight
[1:33:19] and I Know Thee by name
[1:33:23] I just have to pause there and say this
[1:33:25] brothers and sisters
[1:33:27] you have found Grace in his sight
[1:33:29] if you have the ability to hear the word
[1:33:31] for our day you have found Grace in his
[1:33:34] sight this is not just a historical
[1:33:35] account of Moses
[1:33:37] this is about you
[1:33:39] you have found Grace in his sight
[1:33:41] because he knows you by name
[1:33:45] you didn't just get named by accident
[1:33:49] Verse 18 and he said I beseech thee show
[1:33:51] me thy Glory
[1:33:54] I just feel so encouraged by this
[1:33:57] brothers and sisters what if we just
[1:33:59] said that show me thy Glory
[1:34:02] show me thy glory Lord
[1:34:05] and he said I will make all my goodness
[1:34:07] pass before thee and I will proclaim the
[1:34:10] name of the Lord before thee and will be
[1:34:13] gracious to whom I will be gracious and
[1:34:15] will show mercy upon whom I will show
[1:34:18] Mercy
[1:34:19] and he said thou canst not see my face
[1:34:22] for there shall no man see me and live
[1:34:26] and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:34:28] place by me
[1:34:31] and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[1:34:35] we have been given a place by him
[1:34:37] brothers and sisters
[1:34:39] whereby we can stand upon a rock we can
[1:34:42] stand upon the rock of Revelation
[1:34:44] understanding the word for our day
[1:34:46] understanding who he said we are
[1:34:50] verse 22 and it shall come to pass while
[1:34:53] my Glory passeth by that I will put thee
[1:34:57] in a cleft of The Rock
[1:34:59] and will cover thee with my hand while I
[1:35:01] pass by and I will take away mine hand
[1:35:03] and thou shalt see my back Parts but my
[1:35:07] face shall not be seen
[1:35:11] to think about that my face shall not be
[1:35:15] seen
[1:35:18] just thinking about this
[1:35:21] we could talk about First Corinthians
[1:35:23] chapter 13.
[1:35:25] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:35:27] part
[1:35:28] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:35:30] then that which is in part
[1:35:32] it shall be done away with
[1:35:35] we're not going to be looking at the
[1:35:37] hinder parts
[1:35:39] all of the ages got to look
[1:35:42] at parts
[1:35:44] brothers and sisters
[1:35:46] we can go a little further here
[1:35:48] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:35:50] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:35:51] away remember when I was a child I spake
[1:35:54] as a child I understood it as a child I
[1:35:57] thought as a child but when I became a
[1:35:59] man I put away childish things
[1:36:02] I put away the the teachings that maybe
[1:36:05] the past ages live by and that was the
[1:36:08] light that they they lived by
[1:36:10] I just was having the conversation with
[1:36:12] the brother earlier uh I don't know
[1:36:15] about a week ago we're talking about
[1:36:16] someone beloved passing by that didn't
[1:36:19] really believe the message of the hour
[1:36:21] per se but was a Believer according to
[1:36:24] the light that they have it's amazing to
[1:36:26] think about it because even though they
[1:36:28] don't see it necessarily the way that we
[1:36:30] see it it doesn't mean they're not saved
[1:36:32] but the Branham says it very clearly
[1:36:34] don't think that Shelton Methodist
[1:36:35] grandmother of yours isn't going to be
[1:36:37] there because she lived according to the
[1:36:39] light of her day
[1:36:42] that's God's Sovereign choice
[1:36:45] and you know those people
[1:36:47] those those I would say soldiers of the
[1:36:50] Cross those people who are there from
[1:36:52] Generations prior
[1:36:54] they were warriors
[1:36:57] they were prayer warriors steadfast and
[1:37:00] true never deviating from the word no
[1:37:02] matter what comes along
[1:37:04] and they lived through some hard times
[1:37:07] just two or three generations back
[1:37:09] really hard times
[1:37:12] but still believers
[1:37:16] but when I became a man I put away
[1:37:18] childish things
[1:37:20] but verse 12 is what I wanted to get to
[1:37:22] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:37:26] but then
[1:37:28] what does it say
[1:37:30] face to face
[1:37:33] Moses got to see God
[1:37:36] and his hinder parts
[1:37:38] Moses just got to see the hind part of
[1:37:41] him
[1:37:44] the word says here that no man shall see
[1:37:46] God and live
[1:37:48] my own personal belief I'll just throw
[1:37:50] this out there it's coming a Time
[1:37:52] brothers and sisters where we will see
[1:37:53] God as he is where we will recognize
[1:37:56] what God is on Earth this side of
[1:38:00] Eternity
[1:38:02] and we'll go
[1:38:04] that's what the prophet said when we
[1:38:05] recognize what we are
[1:38:07] then the Rapture will go right
[1:38:10] there's coming a time where we'll come
[1:38:12] to that recognition
[1:38:14] where we'll see that we're no longer
[1:38:16] seeing the hinder Parts we're no longer
[1:38:18] just looking at bits and pieces we're no
[1:38:20] longer just gleaning our way along but
[1:38:22] we can see the fullness of the Lord
[1:38:23] because the Mighty God has been unveiled
[1:38:26] before our very eyes and where will he
[1:38:28] be unveiled brothers and sisters not in
[1:38:30] Revelations 19 in the sky he will be
[1:38:33] we'll meet him in the clouds
[1:38:35] but first
[1:38:37] something will happen
[1:38:39] first he'll break the bread and bless it
[1:38:42] first he'll use the last age Messengers
[1:38:45] the last stage preachers to just preach
[1:38:49] the word
[1:38:50] while the well the well the children of
[1:38:52] God they just ripen under the sun while
[1:38:55] those seeds just ripen and as they ripen
[1:38:58] the Harvest happens
[1:39:01] but now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:39:04] but then face to Faith face to face
[1:39:08] now I know in part
[1:39:10] but then shall I know even as I also I
[1:39:15] am known
[1:39:17] to look at that scripture and think that
[1:39:19] he's actually speaking
[1:39:22] about a future time
[1:39:25] where he will take away his hand
[1:39:29] and thou shalt see my back Parts but my
[1:39:32] face
[1:39:33] shall not be seen
[1:39:35] many people have desired to see the face
[1:39:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:40] and you know brothers and sisters
[1:39:42] we don't have to look very far in the
[1:39:43] message of the hour I know I'm not
[1:39:45] really preaching hard but I I'm I'll
[1:39:47] tell you I'm just running a marathon
[1:39:49] here I'm just set in a background I'm
[1:39:51] just trying to lay a foundation for what
[1:39:54] potentially could be coming but if you
[1:39:55] think about it let's just maybe fast
[1:39:58] forward and get into some of the deeper
[1:39:59] things here as we go and and and think
[1:40:02] that here Moses is told that I will take
[1:40:05] away my hand and thou shalt see my back
[1:40:06] Parts but my face shall not be seen
[1:40:10] through the message of the hour through
[1:40:13] the prophet for our day the Vindicated
[1:40:14] Prophet the seventh major Angel
[1:40:17] messenger what did he say John was taken
[1:40:20] up he was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:40:21] day and the whole world is saying the
[1:40:23] spirit on the Lord's day while he was in
[1:40:25] the spirit he got into the spirit the
[1:40:27] Pentecostal Spirit while he was at
[1:40:28] church on a Sunday or a Saturday or
[1:40:31] whatever day it is that that the people
[1:40:33] believe with their religion right but
[1:40:36] here we have the prophet for our day who
[1:40:37] takes us and says no no no that's not so
[1:40:40] what it is is a different time and place
[1:40:42] he's actually gone from time right into
[1:40:45] eternity and he's seen that there's a
[1:40:47] door open in heaven and when he sees the
[1:40:49] door open in heaven he's actually given
[1:40:51] an invitation to come hither and when he
[1:40:53] goes hither he's able to see one seated
[1:40:56] on the throne and that one seated on the
[1:40:58] throne has the book of redemption and
[1:41:00] he's given the whole story that if if
[1:41:02] there isn't a man worthy to come and
[1:41:04] take that book then all creation is lost
[1:41:06] everything is over your name is in there
[1:41:09] John and every other believer's name is
[1:41:11] in that book and if nobody is worthy to
[1:41:13] take that book then it's over forget
[1:41:15] about it for the first time ever
[1:41:19] man
[1:41:21] was shown
[1:41:22] the face of God
[1:41:25] through a Vindicated prophet
[1:41:27] and here he is talking about it
[1:41:30] but what happened on Sunset Mountain
[1:41:32] brothers and sisters what does the
[1:41:34] prophet for our day say about that
[1:41:36] picture of the cloud he says you can see
[1:41:38] his face you can see his eyes you can
[1:41:41] see his nose you can see his hair you
[1:41:44] can see the white wigged one one was
[1:41:46] Supreme deity with supreme authority now
[1:41:51] we see him face to face brothers and
[1:41:53] sisters it's no longer a mystery just
[1:41:56] like the rainbow you know from from the
[1:41:59] time that God created this Covenant and
[1:42:01] put it on Earth he set his bow in the
[1:42:03] cloud with Noah and said I'll never come
[1:42:05] and wipe out man with a flood again and
[1:42:07] I promise you forever and this this is a
[1:42:10] covenant that I set with man now for all
[1:42:13] the ages that I'll never do it every
[1:42:14] time I look on that bow I will remember
[1:42:17] my Covenant
[1:42:19] that's what God Said but he did it so
[1:42:21] that Noah could see it and remember that
[1:42:23] God's going to look at that bow every
[1:42:25] time we see a bow in the clouds brothers
[1:42:27] and sisters don't doubt it for a second
[1:42:28] that God sees it also
[1:42:31] every single time but you know just
[1:42:33] talking about prophesying in part and
[1:42:35] then when that which is perfect has come
[1:42:39] that which is perfect has come I'm
[1:42:41] saying that right now that which is
[1:42:43] perfect has come the message of the hour
[1:42:45] brothers and sisters is perfection it's
[1:42:47] the Lord Jesus Christ the second coming
[1:42:49] of the Lord
[1:42:51] don't be looking for a turnip when we're
[1:42:53] looking for the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:56] brother Branham said it if you don't
[1:42:58] know what you're looking for you're
[1:42:58] going to miss it that's why I have to
[1:43:00] just keep hammering this
[1:43:02] I have to
[1:43:04] it's the age we live in I don't want to
[1:43:06] preach Noah's message
[1:43:08] I don't want to preach Moses message
[1:43:11] we need to preach the message of the
[1:43:13] hour and that is the coming of the Lord
[1:43:15] remember brother Bradham he said it I'm
[1:43:17] not looking for another Revival there's
[1:43:19] people today that are looking for
[1:43:21] revivals
[1:43:22] I remember when I was an unbeliever I'll
[1:43:24] just throw this out there I was I was I
[1:43:27] was smoking and I was drinking and I was
[1:43:29] I was just a complete unbeliever out in
[1:43:32] the world and and I went to this church
[1:43:35] the the Pentecostal church and and we
[1:43:37] met all men are people that went to that
[1:43:39] church
[1:43:40] and my dad had this one fellow who was a
[1:43:43] real religious guy I thought growing up
[1:43:45] him and his wife they were real
[1:43:46] religious and and they went down to
[1:43:48] Mexico and they worked in a an orphanage
[1:43:50] there and and they really did stuff for
[1:43:52] the Lord I grew up believing this with
[1:43:54] all my heart and and I was helping my
[1:43:57] dad work on his house way back before I
[1:43:59] was professionally into Renovations I
[1:44:01] was an amateur into Renovations and my
[1:44:03] dad had this house we were working on
[1:44:05] when we were working on this house
[1:44:07] um this guy was there this man was there
[1:44:10] at this house and I hadn't seen him for
[1:44:12] many many years I was a young boy
[1:44:14] probably like
[1:44:15] um our middle boy Benjamin I was
[1:44:18] probably about his age just about 10
[1:44:19] years old 9 or 10 years old when I had
[1:44:21] seen him last now I'm an adult helping
[1:44:24] my dad renovate this house and I see
[1:44:25] this man there and I'm getting to a
[1:44:27] point about this and what I saw was this
[1:44:30] man he he was this religious guy and I
[1:44:33] had heard some stuff about him and I
[1:44:34] thought goodness sakes is that really
[1:44:36] what it is and I was already grossed out
[1:44:38] with religion as it were and you hear
[1:44:41] all of the the great online or or TV
[1:44:44] Ministries you know when you're in the
[1:44:46] world and you see all this nonsense and
[1:44:48] if you've ever had a taste of religion
[1:44:50] and you see these guys just pulling for
[1:44:52] money it's just another another
[1:44:54] lie is basically the way I felt and so
[1:44:58] here I am with this man and sort of
[1:45:00] reconnecting after all these years I'm
[1:45:02] probably like 29 years old at the time
[1:45:04] 28 years old and and doing my own thing
[1:45:07] and a man and and I have my own opinions
[1:45:09] formed and I meet this man again who's
[1:45:12] the religious guy and and he starts to
[1:45:14] talk to me and and begins to minister to
[1:45:17] me in his own way and begins to tell me
[1:45:19] that there's going to be a great Revival
[1:45:21] that's going to sweep the nation
[1:45:24] and it's going to start at the North End
[1:45:26] of Claire's Home Alberta
[1:45:29] and as an unbeliever I'm I'm I'm looking
[1:45:33] at this guy and I'm thinking what are
[1:45:35] you talking about
[1:45:37] I I couldn't buy it and I don't think it
[1:45:39] was even anything that he was about
[1:45:42] himself but I was just like I just don't
[1:45:45] believe that I just can't believe that
[1:45:47] there's something in me that just can't
[1:45:49] believe that and I know what it is now
[1:45:51] and I'm sure that anybody else who is a
[1:45:54] Believer today would be able to reckon
[1:45:55] with that you just can't actually buy
[1:45:58] into false you can't buy into lies but
[1:46:01] brother Branham said it and I'm so glad
[1:46:04] that that that that that same Spirit
[1:46:06] Vindicated what was actually speaking to
[1:46:08] me even there
[1:46:09] because you know what brothers and
[1:46:11] sisters I'll say this and I can say it
[1:46:13] by experience
[1:46:15] um God doesn't just start speaking to
[1:46:17] you one day
[1:46:20] sometimes maybe it's presented that way
[1:46:22] or sometimes maybe we think it that way
[1:46:24] or some sometimes maybe both God doesn't
[1:46:28] just start speaking to you one day
[1:46:30] God has spoken to you if he speaks to
[1:46:32] you today he has spoken to you your
[1:46:34] entire life
[1:46:35] the only thing that happens is you begin
[1:46:37] to recognize that voice you begin to go
[1:46:39] back in your life and start to connect
[1:46:40] the dots and say wow that was him
[1:46:43] speaking to me there and wow that was
[1:46:45] him speaking to me there and was that
[1:46:47] was him speaking to me there
[1:46:49] you go back in your life even as a
[1:46:51] ranked sinner even while we were yet
[1:46:54] dead in sin and trespasses right
[1:46:59] not not once we were all saved and
[1:47:01] Polished up in the church
[1:47:03] while we were yet dead in sins and
[1:47:06] trespasses
[1:47:11] today's the day brothers and sisters I
[1:47:13] just want to say it that
[1:47:15] you know our minds aren't blinded and we
[1:47:17] don't see the higher parts of God
[1:47:20] we see the fullness of God
[1:47:22] we live in the day brother Branham
[1:47:24] didn't just preach it just because it
[1:47:26] was a great topic just because it
[1:47:28] sounded cool and and forgive me if I'm
[1:47:31] saying it this way I'm just really
[1:47:32] trying to set a background I really
[1:47:34] don't mean to sound if it is
[1:47:36] condescending in any way I never want it
[1:47:38] to be that way but to think about it if
[1:47:40] we could just pause for a second and
[1:47:42] think about it the unveiling of God
[1:47:45] or or the Mighty God unveiled
[1:47:49] what does that mean
[1:47:51] that means that God is going to reveal
[1:47:53] himself to a group of people
[1:47:59] that means that he's revealing himself
[1:48:02] and you know
[1:48:04] I believe that once we recognize his
[1:48:05] revealing I said it before I'll say it
[1:48:07] again then the Rapture will go
[1:48:10] and where is he going to reveal himself
[1:48:12] brothers and sisters
[1:48:17] in Exodus 33
[1:48:21] it's real interesting if if uh sorry
[1:48:25] Exodus 34.
[1:48:27] turn over to Exodus 34. we'll just read
[1:48:30] a little bit more here
[1:48:34] verses 29 and 30. sort of the outcome of
[1:48:39] what we were talking about Moses seeing
[1:48:42] the higher parts of God
[1:48:44] having God just cover his face and
[1:48:47] letting him see the hinder parts
[1:48:50] verse 29 of Exodus chapter 34.
[1:48:54] and it came to pass when Moses came down
[1:48:56] from Mount Sinai
[1:48:58] with the two tables of testimony in
[1:49:00] Moses hand
[1:49:01] when he came down from the mount
[1:49:04] that Moses
[1:49:06] was not that the skin of his face Shone
[1:49:10] while he talked to him
[1:49:13] verse 30. and when Aaron and all the
[1:49:17] children of Israel saw Moses behold the
[1:49:20] skin of his face Sean
[1:49:22] and they were afraid to come nigh him
[1:49:25] can you imagine what that would have
[1:49:27] been like
[1:49:28] have his face shine so much that they
[1:49:32] wanted to cover him with the Veil
[1:49:35] but isn't it interesting that that's
[1:49:36] what they did they covered him with a
[1:49:39] veil
[1:49:40] because he had just a little bit too
[1:49:42] much glory for his day maybe just a
[1:49:45] little bit too much Revelation for his
[1:49:46] day maybe he just was shown just a
[1:49:49] little bit too much
[1:49:50] for his day
[1:49:53] verse 31 and Moses called unto them and
[1:49:55] Aaron and all the rulers of the
[1:49:57] congregation returned unto him and Moses
[1:49:59] talked with them and afterward all the
[1:50:02] children of Israel came nigh and he gave
[1:50:05] them in commandment all that the Lord
[1:50:07] had spoken with him in Mount Sinai
[1:50:12] until Moses had done speaking with them
[1:50:15] he put a veil on his face
[1:50:19] and when Moses went in before the Lord
[1:50:22] to speak with him
[1:50:24] he took the veil off
[1:50:27] because he got to speak to him
[1:50:29] face to face
[1:50:32] until he came out
[1:50:34] and he came out and spake unto the
[1:50:36] children of Israel
[1:50:38] that which he was commanded
[1:50:41] and the children of Israel saw the face
[1:50:44] of Moses that the skin of Moses faced
[1:50:47] Sean and Moses put the veil upon his
[1:50:50] face again
[1:50:51] until he went in to speak with him
[1:50:56] and I know
[1:50:58] that he didn't show him his face
[1:51:01] but what I'm saying with that is that he
[1:51:03] spoke to him as a friend
[1:51:07] he wasn't shown God's face
[1:51:10] he spoke to him as a friend face to face
[1:51:12] that's my implication there
[1:51:15] just for the record
[1:51:17] because I know what the word says
[1:51:19] but looking at this verse 13 of second
[1:51:21] Corinthians chapter 3 and not as Moses
[1:51:24] which put a veil over his face that the
[1:51:27] children of Israel could not
[1:51:31] that the children of Israel could not
[1:51:33] steadfastly look to the end of that
[1:51:36] which is abolished
[1:51:37] but their minds were blinded for until
[1:51:40] this day remaineth the same Veil
[1:51:44] untaken away in the reading of the Old
[1:51:46] Testament which Veil is done away in
[1:51:49] Christ
[1:51:50] all they would have to do is receive
[1:51:52] Christ
[1:51:54] if they receive Christ that Veil is
[1:51:57] taken away
[1:51:58] but how will they receive Christ
[1:52:00] by their own Prophets
[1:52:02] it has to be one of their own
[1:52:05] that takes the message back to them and
[1:52:07] when they do they will receive it they
[1:52:09] will receive Christ They will receive
[1:52:11] this very same message they'll realize
[1:52:14] the unveiling of God
[1:52:17] what an honor and a privilege it is I I
[1:52:20] sent a video out a while ago of the the
[1:52:22] children of Israel The Devout Jews they
[1:52:25] were worshiping in front of the Wailing
[1:52:27] Wall I'm not sure what the festival was
[1:52:29] I think it might have been the Festival
[1:52:30] of booths but the the the singing I
[1:52:34] don't know if anybody remembers seeing
[1:52:36] that video but the singing what it
[1:52:38] sounded like was one giant voice
[1:52:42] imagine the way the Jews will be when
[1:52:45] they recognize when they ask him where
[1:52:47] did you get those wounds and he'll say
[1:52:49] to them in the house of my friends
[1:52:51] imagine how those devout Jews those
[1:52:55] little Benjamins brother Branham calls
[1:52:57] them imagine how they will be brothers
[1:53:00] and sisters how much more ought we to be
[1:53:03] able to Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:53:05] to have the Liberty the freedom to
[1:53:07] understand the message of the hour to
[1:53:09] talk about it and just to be able to
[1:53:11] worship I'll tell you what I'm I'm
[1:53:13] seriously looking forward to some really
[1:53:15] good worship services with everyone
[1:53:17] getting back together again
[1:53:21] looking at this though
[1:53:23] to think that Moses he had to put a veil
[1:53:26] over his face
[1:53:28] and that same Veil is over the face of
[1:53:31] all of the Jews even to this day is what
[1:53:34] the word says when the word of Moses
[1:53:36] when Moses is read is what the word says
[1:53:39] hey
[1:53:41] even unto this day when Moses is read
[1:53:45] not even the word of Moses not the word
[1:53:47] of God when Moses is read
[1:53:51] the Veil is upon where
[1:53:54] their heart
[1:53:56] it's upon their hearts it's not even
[1:53:58] upon their minds it's not upon their
[1:54:01] eyes
[1:54:02] upon their heart
[1:54:05] but we know that their minds were
[1:54:07] blinded
[1:54:09] looking at the unveiling of God
[1:54:12] we talked about it a little while ago as
[1:54:14] we began to set a little bit of a
[1:54:16] background for this how many different
[1:54:18] times how many different ways did God
[1:54:20] choose
[1:54:21] to wear a mask choose
[1:54:24] to reveal himself to mankind
[1:54:27] we know I'm not even going to try and
[1:54:30] list them but every single one we talked
[1:54:33] about it the stories in the Bible is a
[1:54:35] representation of God in a specific
[1:54:37] story in a specific time it's it's what
[1:54:40] brother Bradham called the seventh seal
[1:54:42] being revealed in every single book of
[1:54:45] the Bible it's Jesus Christ in every
[1:54:48] chapter and every verse and every line
[1:54:49] and brother Branham said that if we
[1:54:51] don't see that then we need to go back
[1:54:52] and actually reread the Bible until we
[1:54:55] do because that's what it is the Bible
[1:54:57] is Jesus Christ the word
[1:55:01] but talking about the many different
[1:55:02] manifestations how God has shown chosen
[1:55:06] to represent himself to reveal himself
[1:55:08] to the world and express himself to
[1:55:10] mankind all of the different ways
[1:55:12] brother Bradham he called it in in the
[1:55:14] third pull of his ministry in the latter
[1:55:16] Parts like in 1964's when he started
[1:55:19] talking about it was en morphe
[1:55:22] that Greek word used 19 times in the
[1:55:25] message
[1:55:27] and the first time he used it was an
[1:55:29] unveiling of God
[1:55:32] excuse me
[1:55:34] I'm sorry I don't really know how to
[1:55:35] cough if I have to
[1:55:37] forgive me
[1:55:41] um the first time he used that word was
[1:55:42] in the unveiling of God
[1:55:44] and you know
[1:55:45] through this it's the introduction in
[1:55:47] plain language
[1:55:50] then he goes into the identified Christ
[1:55:53] of all ages he uses the word amorphy
[1:55:58] the identified Christ of all ages and I
[1:56:02] would say that's a great description
[1:56:03] it's probably a better description than
[1:56:05] what I used originally in that God
[1:56:09] had
[1:56:11] he had
[1:56:13] his identification
[1:56:15] in all ages the identified Christ
[1:56:18] through all ages
[1:56:20] all of the men and women
[1:56:23] that he chose to identify himself
[1:56:25] through
[1:56:28] the identified Christ of all the ages
[1:56:30] these are all messages that brother
[1:56:31] Branham preached
[1:56:32] in 1964. after the seals were open after
[1:56:36] John was shown that door open in heaven
[1:56:39] after
[1:56:40] the Mighty God came down and put one
[1:56:43] foot on the land and one foot on the sea
[1:56:45] and held the open book and raised his
[1:56:48] hand to heaven and said there shall be
[1:56:49] time no more
[1:56:52] then he preached the Mighty God unveiled
[1:56:55] before us
[1:56:58] I just think that message is so
[1:57:01] astounding to think about the Mighty God
[1:57:04] unveiled before us
[1:57:07] then he preached a message called the
[1:57:10] masterpiece all of these are messages
[1:57:13] where he used the word amore
[1:57:17] where a man a a spirit
[1:57:21] a being
[1:57:22] uses a mask
[1:57:24] picks a body and steps into it
[1:57:28] amorphy God amore
[1:57:32] the Mighty God unveiled before us
[1:57:35] then the masterpiece
[1:57:38] then he preached who is this Melchizedek
[1:57:42] they're not in sequential order
[1:57:44] but he uses the word amorphe in every
[1:57:47] one of these messages
[1:57:50] the last one that he used it in is
[1:57:52] called ashamed
[1:57:54] to think about the power
[1:57:57] of amorphe to think that God chooses to
[1:58:02] Veil himself
[1:58:04] but to reveal himself unto babes who
[1:58:08] will learn
[1:58:10] you know the word says that we entertain
[1:58:11] angels unawares
[1:58:15] sometimes we meet people
[1:58:17] and we don't even know where they're
[1:58:18] from
[1:58:20] we don't even know how we connect to
[1:58:21] them
[1:58:24] but they could be angels
[1:58:27] you never know
[1:58:28] who we're going to bump into brothers
[1:58:30] and sisters
[1:58:32] it's tremendous to think about
[1:58:35] because at any time
[1:58:36] in any place we can bump into an angel
[1:58:40] of the Lord
[1:58:41] and he's not going to have wings
[1:58:44] and he's not going to be glowing
[1:58:47] he's not going to have Godly apparel
[1:58:52] but he could be
[1:58:54] God amorphe
[1:58:57] come down to see what's going on
[1:59:00] to see how we will react
[1:59:04] I'm not saying that God is doing that
[1:59:06] walking around but I I will say
[1:59:09] that he is using eyes
[1:59:12] and he is using ears and he is using
[1:59:16] mouths that's his way for today
[1:59:19] God amorphe and and this is really the
[1:59:22] the point of all of it brothers and
[1:59:24] sisters he's chosen different bodies
[1:59:28] to jump into throughout the ages
[1:59:31] why not yours
[1:59:35] why not mine
[1:59:38] I would say
[1:59:39] that I I feel like I need to consecrate
[1:59:42] this Temple if that's what's going on if
[1:59:44] that's his choice because I certainly
[1:59:46] don't feel like the The Dwelling Place
[1:59:49] of the most high God
[1:59:51] but I would say thanks be to God for a
[1:59:54] prophet that would say your feelings
[1:59:55] have nothing to do with it
[1:59:57] that the Holy Ghost which is actually
[1:59:58] his Spirit amore
[2:00:01] in the human
[2:00:03] the holy spirit is without sensation
[2:00:06] and that there's only one true evidence
[2:00:08] of whether you have the Holy Spirit or
[2:00:10] not there's definitely attributes
[2:00:12] towards it attributes that go along with
[2:00:14] it but the true evidence is one thing
[2:00:16] that's your ability to receive the word
[2:00:17] for your day to be able to recognize who
[2:00:20] you are in the scripture to recognize
[2:00:22] your place in the word
[2:00:26] you know he revealed himself throughout
[2:00:29] the ages through His prophets
[2:00:32] I'll read a quote out of unveiling of
[2:00:34] God
[2:00:35] in 64.
[2:00:38] that's the way God did
[2:00:40] he bred this one to that one
[2:00:43] this one to that one
[2:00:46] to this one to that one
[2:00:48] till he got exactly what he wanted
[2:00:53] many times we look at our lives and
[2:00:54] think that you know I'm I'm just a
[2:00:57] product of you know Al and Sharon
[2:01:00] Johnson and and their parents and and
[2:01:03] their parents and their parents and
[2:01:05] their parents and it's just the way life
[2:01:07] works and it's an accident no it's not
[2:01:09] an accident
[2:01:11] it's exactly the way God's designed it
[2:01:14] exactly according to his purpose because
[2:01:17] remember there's a council in heaven for
[2:01:19] every single thought that we have let
[2:01:20] alone every single action when God has a
[2:01:23] plan and has a purpose he will say to
[2:01:25] the angels the Heavenly hosts who's
[2:01:27] going to go and accomplish my word in in
[2:01:29] that person's life on Earth God doesn't
[2:01:32] go and do it but he has Messengers that
[2:01:34] does
[2:01:36] and while those Messengers go they cause
[2:01:39] it to happen
[2:01:40] that's the way God did it he bred this
[2:01:42] one to that one to this one to that one
[2:01:44] to this one to that one until he got
[2:01:45] exactly what he wanted that's how he
[2:01:47] come down God unveiled himself in a
[2:01:49] pillar of fire down through the prophets
[2:01:51] then into the Son of God which he was
[2:01:55] God see he's the same God bringing out
[2:01:58] exactly from Perfection to Perfection
[2:02:01] from glory to glory that's the way the
[2:02:03] church goes
[2:02:05] to think about that quote
[2:02:07] how can anybody say that Jesus wasn't
[2:02:10] God Jesus was the dwelling place of God
[2:02:12] Jesus was God a more faith Jesus was the
[2:02:16] body that God created to inhabit
[2:02:20] so that we could have a kinsman redeemer
[2:02:23] if it wasn't God's blood
[2:02:25] then we're all lost
[2:02:29] but he came down and he revealed himself
[2:02:31] through the prophets
[2:02:34] he come down God unveiled himself
[2:02:38] he pulled the covering off
[2:02:40] he showed his face
[2:02:43] it's not God pulling the covering off of
[2:02:45] his hinder parts that was for a
[2:02:48] different day
[2:02:49] but what brother Branham is talking
[2:02:51] about here is he's pulling the veil off
[2:02:53] of his face how can you recognize
[2:02:56] someone you could have
[2:02:58] four men exactly the same height exactly
[2:03:01] the same weight where exactly the same
[2:03:03] clothes same thing with sisters you
[2:03:06] could line up four here and four here
[2:03:08] and have all of them turned around
[2:03:11] and all of them could look the same
[2:03:13] right
[2:03:15] how would you tell them apart
[2:03:17] how would you recognize them
[2:03:19] the only way you could recognize them
[2:03:21] was to have them turn around
[2:03:24] and see their face
[2:03:26] when you see their face
[2:03:28] the veil is no longer covering them
[2:03:31] there's no more mystery there you can
[2:03:33] understand who they are
[2:03:35] you can put a name to the person
[2:03:38] and that's what happened in the message
[2:03:40] of the hour
[2:03:42] the prophet came and made it so simple
[2:03:46] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[2:03:48] revealing himself in the same showing
[2:03:51] that Jesus Christ
[2:03:53] was God
[2:03:55] not another man not one of the three not
[2:03:58] another third person of a trinitarian
[2:04:01] Doctrine from hell
[2:04:03] because that's what he said it was
[2:04:04] that's what it is it's an antichrist
[2:04:06] Spirit that's crept into the church
[2:04:08] causing it to be lukewarm formal and
[2:04:10] Powerless
[2:04:13] but he unveiled himself
[2:04:17] and I just love how he says this too he
[2:04:19] unveiled himself in a pillar of Fire
[2:04:22] down through the prophets
[2:04:25] we can put that off in the past and say
[2:04:27] yeah that's you know he did
[2:04:30] but he also did today
[2:04:32] right
[2:04:33] revealed himself in a pillar of fire
[2:04:36] through the prophets
[2:04:38] today
[2:04:40] he come down God unveiled himself in a
[2:04:43] pillar of fire through the prophets then
[2:04:45] into the son of God
[2:04:47] which he was God see
[2:04:51] he's the same God bringing out exactly
[2:04:53] from Perfection to Perfection from Glory
[2:04:56] unto Glory
[2:04:57] that's the way the church goes
[2:05:00] I just can't help but think about that
[2:05:02] scripture in Ephesians
[2:05:04] or talks about that Glory
[2:05:07] that shall be revealed where
[2:05:09] in US
[2:05:12] That Glory is what we're talking about
[2:05:14] brothers and sisters Perfection to
[2:05:16] Perfection his Perfection coming out in
[2:05:18] our lives being expressed through us us
[2:05:21] being the expression of his perfection
[2:05:26] in this age how could that possibly be
[2:05:29] we would never say it we would never
[2:05:31] even see it really
[2:05:33] but we have to believe it
[2:05:36] it has to be something we believe
[2:05:37] because that's what the word says
[2:05:40] you know the song We Sing he looked at
[2:05:41] our perfect picture
[2:05:43] right it wasn't a a spotted picture
[2:05:47] his wife
[2:05:48] hath made herself ready
[2:05:51] with a spotless garment
[2:05:55] it's from Perfection to Perfection from
[2:05:57] glory to glory
[2:05:59] that's the way the church goes is what
[2:06:01] the prophet says
[2:06:02] from perfection
[2:06:04] from the original
[2:06:05] perfection in the Garden of Eden
[2:06:08] the spoken word
[2:06:10] existence
[2:06:12] right down through the fall of all
[2:06:14] mankind
[2:06:15] seemingly helpless hopeless no hope in
[2:06:19] sight
[2:06:20] a chain dangling over hell
[2:06:23] to the place where he comes down
[2:06:26] God and morphe
[2:06:29] in a different mask and reveals himself
[2:06:31] to us reveals himself not just to us
[2:06:35] brothers and sisters but this is what I
[2:06:36] want to point out through the message
[2:06:39] this is where I'm going with this and I
[2:06:41] would just encourage anyone who wants to
[2:06:42] study along with it
[2:06:44] not just God
[2:06:46] to us
[2:06:48] but God through us
[2:06:51] that's what the prophet brought in the
[2:06:53] message of the hour God unveiling
[2:06:55] himself
[2:06:56] through us
[2:06:58] remember he said that he didn't come to
[2:07:00] start a church he didn't come to start
[2:07:02] an organization he didn't want to start
[2:07:04] as a nomination he came to reveal that
[2:07:07] you are the PowerHouse of the Holy
[2:07:10] Spirit
[2:07:11] if we're the dwelling place of the Holy
[2:07:13] Spirit then where is God today brothers
[2:07:15] and sisters if the holy spirit is God
[2:07:17] and God and the Holy Spirit are Jesus
[2:07:20] Christ if the three are not three but
[2:07:22] they're one and you have a part of one
[2:07:24] of them then who are you
[2:07:28] it can't be any different
[2:07:31] it can't be part me and part him
[2:07:34] can it
[2:07:36] because the word says a double-minded
[2:07:37] man is unstable in all of his ways
[2:07:41] it's got to be Christ in me the hope of
[2:07:44] glory
[2:07:45] Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:07:50] that's why I say it over and over but
[2:07:53] brother Branham said that every single
[2:07:55] Speck of the old man has to die
[2:07:57] has to be a dying out there has to be a
[2:08:00] a a watery grave there has to be a time
[2:08:03] where we say I've just had enough of me
[2:08:05] and I want more of him
[2:08:08] and and to think that we have the
[2:08:10] opportunity to just fall on our face and
[2:08:12] worship just like Moses did we have the
[2:08:15] opportunity to just Proclaim his glory
[2:08:17] we have the opportunity to do that so
[2:08:20] why wouldn't we
[2:08:22] we don't want to let this world hold us
[2:08:24] back from enjoying all of the Liberty
[2:08:26] that we have you know the whole world
[2:08:27] even in the midst of covid they're going
[2:08:29] to put on the Stampede they're going to
[2:08:31] go and have a total carousing yahoo time
[2:08:35] in sin
[2:08:37] and they're going to do it the whole
[2:08:39] world does it over and over again
[2:08:42] what holds us back from just proclaiming
[2:08:44] the glory of the Lord from shouting to
[2:08:46] the Lord and thanking him for what he's
[2:08:48] done for us
[2:08:50] he's come down and revealed himself to
[2:08:53] us through the prophets through a pillar
[2:08:55] of fire now we're just about out of time
[2:08:56] again he's revealed himself to us
[2:08:58] through the word he's revealed through
[2:09:01] the Life of Christ he's revealed through
[2:09:03] the message now brothers and sisters how
[2:09:06] he reveals is through his word on our
[2:09:10] lips
[2:09:11] through his word on our lips that's how
[2:09:14] he reveals himself out of the abundance
[2:09:17] of the heart the mouth speaketh is what
[2:09:19] the word says what do we talk about
[2:09:21] where do we dwell
[2:09:25] I just want to say this if you're a
[2:09:26] Believer this morning if you've been
[2:09:28] baptized according to the scripture then
[2:09:30] brothers and sisters you are the
[2:09:33] revelation of Jesus Christ today
[2:09:36] if you are a Believer according to the
[2:09:37] message of the hour you are the
[2:09:40] revelation of Jesus Christ to this world
[2:09:43] some people would say well Brandon was
[2:09:46] that guy brother Bradham was the wave
[2:09:47] Chief brother Branham was the example
[2:09:49] for every one of us to come to
[2:09:53] that's astounding when you think about
[2:09:55] it
[2:09:56] because you couldn't tell his friends
[2:09:58] from his enemies and his enemies from
[2:10:00] his friends
[2:10:01] some of us we still have the old men old
[2:10:05] men
[2:10:06] very much alive in our lives
[2:10:08] and we still have people that we just
[2:10:10] can't stand to see can't stand to be
[2:10:12] around
[2:10:13] you know we have to just kill that that
[2:10:16] has to fall away that has to die in our
[2:10:18] lives
[2:10:19] that's not the life of Christ
[2:10:22] brother Branham said that we wouldn't
[2:10:23] wish
[2:10:25] Eternal separation from the Lord to
[2:10:27] anyone even our worst enemies
[2:10:31] but brothers and sisters you today are
[2:10:33] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:10:35] it's so humbling when you think about
[2:10:37] that I just can't even almost can't even
[2:10:40] bear the weight of that thought to think
[2:10:41] that I would be the revelation of Jesus
[2:10:44] Christ who me how could that possibly be
[2:10:46] there's no way
[2:10:49] but that I recognize that voice
[2:10:52] that's not the spirit of Truth
[2:10:54] that's not only believe
[2:10:57] that's Satan saying look at your flesh
[2:11:00] how could you possibly ever measure up
[2:11:01] to that how could you ever attain to
[2:11:04] that level
[2:11:06] you never could
[2:11:07] I never could on our own we never could
[2:11:10] but we know that atonement that was made
[2:11:12] that book that was given to John that
[2:11:15] John was told to eat up
[2:11:17] that book contained everything that we
[2:11:21] needed
[2:11:22] to make us exactly the way he wanted us
[2:11:25] to be the way he created us to be
[2:11:29] you are the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:11:31] today a part of the mystical body of
[2:11:34] Jesus Christ on Earth
[2:11:36] and that is why when you go from here to
[2:11:39] Africa or to Asia or Antarctica or the
[2:11:43] Arctic or Russia or wherever it is in
[2:11:44] the world that we go to and we meet up
[2:11:46] with brothers and sisters of like
[2:11:47] Precious faith those people who have
[2:11:49] received the message of the hour we
[2:11:51] become one it's like we've known each
[2:11:53] other forever because we have brothers
[2:11:55] and sisters that Spirit that's in me is
[2:11:57] the Same Spirit that's in you it's not a
[2:12:00] different spirit
[2:12:02] it's a tremendous thing but it's
[2:12:04] alarming when you see people who claim
[2:12:06] to have the same Spirit but yet
[2:12:08] demonstrate a different life
[2:12:10] it's really bizarre and you know we
[2:12:13] can't help that the only thing we can do
[2:12:15] is try and encourage a more excellent
[2:12:16] way just like Paul did to say look you
[2:12:19] know what maybe you just haven't been
[2:12:21] taught right or maybe something isn't
[2:12:22] right but let me just show you a little
[2:12:24] bit of a different angle maybe a more
[2:12:26] expedient way not common say I've got
[2:12:28] I've got the fivefold ministry here now
[2:12:31] I'm going to show you I'm going to teach
[2:12:32] you because I know all the quotes and I
[2:12:34] know how to comprehend and I know how to
[2:12:36] actually straighten out that thing you
[2:12:38] know what that spirit is brothers and
[2:12:39] sisters that's a spirit of deception
[2:12:43] you know we were talking about this
[2:12:44] recently and it's a very much alive and
[2:12:46] well and I'm going to say it because I
[2:12:48] believe it should be said those people
[2:12:50] that think that they have well within
[2:12:52] them what it takes to go and combat
[2:12:55] those people who want to say that the
[2:12:57] cloud is actually false or come against
[2:12:59] the message of the hour you will never
[2:13:01] be able to contend with that Spirit
[2:13:03] brothers and sisters never that spirit
[2:13:05] will capture you if you pursue it look
[2:13:09] the other way don't go to it look the
[2:13:11] other way get away from it you'll never
[2:13:13] be able to rationalize with an
[2:13:15] irrational Spirit if it's not the spirit
[2:13:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ then walk away
[2:13:20] rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:13:22] every single person that I've seen that
[2:13:25] has actually gone towards it because
[2:13:27] they're going to refute it they're going
[2:13:28] to point out all the quotes and the
[2:13:30] faults and straighten it out on its
[2:13:31] Doctrine what's happened to them is that
[2:13:33] Spirit has actually pulled them out
[2:13:35] it's grabbed a hold of them and taken
[2:13:37] them right away from church right away
[2:13:38] from fellowship right out into the world
[2:13:42] you won't be able to contend with it
[2:13:43] brothers and sisters there's only one
[2:13:45] true Spirit that's the spirit of Christ
[2:13:48] we want to make sure that we we remain
[2:13:50] in our place and there's no room for
[2:13:52] contentions or fightings or arguings
[2:13:54] those people are always going to be
[2:13:56] there and they're always going to do
[2:13:58] that and and they're not people they're
[2:13:59] Spirits we have been given the ability
[2:14:01] to discern the spirits we've been
[2:14:03] instructed to discern the spirits the
[2:14:05] spirit of discernment isn't just for a
[2:14:07] prophet it's for a prophetic people
[2:14:11] a special class of people
[2:14:13] and it doesn't mean that we're Elite
[2:14:16] I'll call the musicians it doesn't mean
[2:14:18] that we're we're better than anyone else
[2:14:20] what it means is that we're worse than
[2:14:23] everyone else
[2:14:24] and we recognize that
[2:14:27] and we've been given his spirit
[2:14:30] that makes us
[2:14:31] exactly who we were created to be
[2:14:35] to be a part of the many membered body
[2:14:37] the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[2:14:41] you know brothers and sisters brother
[2:14:43] bradham's Ministry
[2:14:44] was the unveiling of God
[2:14:47] to this generation
[2:14:49] to the final generation the message of
[2:14:51] the hour
[2:14:53] was was the unveiling of God
[2:14:55] and I would say is the unveiling of God
[2:14:59] because there's still people coming to
[2:15:01] the recognition of the message there's
[2:15:03] still people coming in there's still
[2:15:05] Grace in this world for those people
[2:15:07] that just haven't been able to see it
[2:15:08] yet all the way
[2:15:11] but today brothers and sisters don't
[2:15:12] think that brother Branham was the
[2:15:14] Mighty God unveiled
[2:15:16] he was he was the conduit that God chose
[2:15:19] to speak to the people through
[2:15:21] according to his word
[2:15:23] surely he'll do nothing unless he
[2:15:25] Reveals His secret through the prophets
[2:15:28] right he does everything according to
[2:15:29] the word his word he will never deviate
[2:15:32] from it
[2:15:33] but today brothers and sisters
[2:15:35] you if you've received the message of
[2:15:38] the hour you are the Mighty God unveiled
[2:15:43] and when we get that Revelation when we
[2:15:45] get that Revelation brothers and sisters
[2:15:47] that we are the Mighty God unveiled and
[2:15:49] we no longer look at ourselves through
[2:15:51] all the faults and failures and we no
[2:15:53] longer look at our brothers and sisters
[2:15:54] through all the faults and failures when
[2:15:55] we only look at ourselves and we say hey
[2:15:58] you know what I'm God's choice this is
[2:16:00] your choice right here this is who you
[2:16:02] chose and I just accept that in the name
[2:16:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ and I just
[2:16:06] believe it just because your word says
[2:16:07] it just like I believe that you love me
[2:16:09] just because your word says it just like
[2:16:11] I believe that I have eternal life just
[2:16:13] because your word says it I also believe
[2:16:16] that you chose me to be your
[2:16:18] representation today maybe stand with me
[2:16:21] as we close
[2:16:23] we can look at the life of a prophet and
[2:16:25] say you know wasn't that nice
[2:16:27] wasn't that good and and it was and it
[2:16:30] can make it so easy to say
[2:16:33] and and
[2:16:35] easy to even Elevate to a place that he
[2:16:38] would never want it to be
[2:16:40] he would never have wanted to be
[2:16:42] elevated
[2:16:44] [Music]
[2:16:45] but he was arguable
[2:16:49] our example to eat the book
[2:16:52] just eat the book
[2:16:54] don't dispute with it
[2:16:56] don't try and study your way into it
[2:16:59] don't don't try and and be anything
[2:17:02] other than what the word says and just
[2:17:04] eat it just follow the instructions and
[2:17:06] eat it and by doing that we become what
[2:17:08] we eat brothers and sisters and we truly
[2:17:10] do become what we eat if we eat junk
[2:17:12] food
[2:17:13] then we become junk food
[2:17:15] if we eat whole food Pure Food then we
[2:17:19] become whole and we become pure and the
[2:17:22] only way that we can do that is to eat
[2:17:24] the book eat the message read the Bible
[2:17:28] read the message absorb it take it in
[2:17:32] the more we take it in the more we
[2:17:33] become like him the more we the more we
[2:17:35] have the ability to reflect him out how
[2:17:38] can we ever give out if we don't take
[2:17:39] him
[2:17:40] we need to be like a tree and just take
[2:17:42] and drink in when the water is coming
[2:17:44] when the blessings are falling take in
[2:17:46] raise up your hands and worship him and
[2:17:48] take them in because they're not always
[2:17:50] going to be there that way and and there
[2:17:52] could come a day where it's just over
[2:17:53] and we can no longer gather together we
[2:17:56] need to make sure that we just take
[2:17:58] advantage of the moment when we have it
[2:18:00] and eat the book
[2:18:03] today brothers and sisters we are the
[2:18:06] unveiling of God and I'll probably keep
[2:18:08] talking like this for a while so I
[2:18:09] apologize in advance but I just believe
[2:18:12] it once the church catches the
[2:18:13] revelation of what she is what it is
[2:18:15] then the Rapture will go and I don't
[2:18:17] want to be here another moment myself
[2:18:20] and you know what all that are Gods
[2:18:22] won't be lost
[2:18:24] I I I can't make it happen and maybe I'm
[2:18:27] a little bit anxious trying to talk that
[2:18:29] way and I don't want to be that way I
[2:18:31] want it to be exactly when God wants it
[2:18:33] to be the only thing I can do is just be
[2:18:35] about his business and just preach truth
[2:18:37] according to our day and that's all I
[2:18:39] want to do I just want to try and
[2:18:40] encourage each and every one that Lord
[2:18:42] we are the Lord's choice we are the one
[2:18:45] that he has chosen to express himself to
[2:18:48] the world through
[2:18:50] using that word amore
[2:18:53] we are the mask of God
[2:18:55] let's just bow in prayer gracious
[2:18:57] Heavenly Father we just love you and we
[2:18:59] thank you for your grace and for your
[2:19:01] mercy

[2:19:18] hinder your spirit from moving Lord I
[2:19:20] just pray that you would help us to just
[2:19:22] cast them down to just lay them aside to
[2:19:24] set them down and just walk towards you

[2:19:28] yourself to us in a greater way Lord we
[2:19:31] know that there's there's no greater

[2:19:35] recognize you and father we just Lord we
[2:19:38] love you and we thank you for your grace
[2:19:40] to reveal yourself to us Lord Jesus

[2:19:47] would choose to reveal yourself to this
[2:19:49] age through Lord Jesus

[2:19:53] book ourselves and eat it that we could
[2:19:56] now take and and realize the fullness of
[2:19:59] the message of the hour that that
[2:20:01] fullness of the message of the hour is
