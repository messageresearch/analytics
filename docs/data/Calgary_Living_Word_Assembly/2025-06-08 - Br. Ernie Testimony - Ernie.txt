========================================

you and just just a real honor and a privilege to be here this morning. Amen. And I cannot believe this. This is this is unreal. The last time we're here, there wasn't was it here or wasn't the other church? The other church, there wasn't that many people. Oh, wow. Is there is there any congalles in here? Oh, you know, brother DDA and brother Christiana. I guess you listen to him singing on on Yeah, he brother DD is our pastor. Uh we live in Washington State and um is I have a very very unique testimony cuz Sister Katie and myself were raised in a Hutterey colony and then we became Hutter lefts cuz we left. So, so anyway growing up we grew up well from five years old when you start you grow up actually in fear. So no music. So that fear followed me for 55 years and at the age of 60 I was delivered from that fear. I would have never been able to come up here and do this. But no music at the colony. So the only thing you could really hide was a harmonica. But when they found it on me, I was whipped. I don't know how many times they took it away. I got another one and kept playing. And so, so here I am. I I played a harmonic. I after I give my testimony, I want to play a song for you. Brother Brandham, he said, when you come over yonder, he says, when you come up, he says, you'll hear me singing on the top of my voice, Amazing Grace. [Applause] And then then he said, then you'll see, oh, brother Bill made it. So that is my testimony. But we all we all went through 2020. I guess the sc we call it a scandmic, right? Scandmic. So October the 2nd, 2020, I come home. It was a Friday. I come home from work and I felt really sick. Told my wife, you know, I can't go to church tonight. you'll have to go by yourself. So, I stayed home and I started to throw up. By the following Wednesday, she took me into the hospital. They did an X-ray and said I had pneumonia. So, they give me penicellin twice, but they give me the wrong penicellin. So, I got sicker and sicker and sicker, just throwing up and throwing up. Like, every time she would feed me with a dropper and and a blueberry, I would just throw it up. And then and that I lost 40 pounds. And uh so anyway, by the 14th day on it was a Friday evening. It was a service and our nephew, Brother Daryl Hoer, some of you know him. He had written a song, cast the Mamba in the fire, tell the devil he is a liar, and then turn up the heat and burn his deceit. And they kept singing that over and over. and I'm listening to that. I was very very tired because my lungs were just totally given out and from my oxygen was down to 83 and I was actually between life and death at that time. So I I am actually a walking miracle. [Applause] So, I went to sleep and at 3:00 in the morning, I was awakened and I'm standing beside the bed here and I'm looking at myself. I'm laying in the bed. I'm on my elbow and I'm looking out the window at 3:00 in the morning. It's usually black, but it's daylight outside. And as I'm as I'm laying there, this black sheet come flying over my shoulder and into the garbage can. I said, "Cast the mamba in the fire." At 3:00 in the afternoon, I told Sister Katie, "Come take this mamba, tie it up, and go back in the fire pit and burn it." And that's what she did. Amen. Then I knew that Satan could not take my life. Now, by the by the following Friday, I I I couldn't walk, so I had two brothers come and and take me out of the bed, lift me in a chair, and rolled me out to the car. Sister T sister Katie hauled me to the hospital. So, they took me in. As soon as they put the oxygen, I I just completely revived. But I stayed in the hospital for 21 days. And so what happened is at 1:30 in the morning by ambulance because the hospital that she took me at didn't have the facility. So the ambulance at 1:30 in the morning called me to another hospital. So when When the attendants took me into the elevator, they pushed the floor. I didn't have a clue where I was going to land up. I landed up on the fifth floor. Grace, God's grace. That's all I I can't say anything else. So, they they put me in a room, put oxygen on me, put wires, you know, there won't be no wires in heaven, but I was full of them at that time. So, next morning, I got up about probably quarter after 8 or something, they brought me breakfast and I was I was I was hungry because I hadn't eaten for a long time. For the first time, I ate that breakfast and it stayed down. So, there's a big window there on the side of the of my bed where I was laying. And the building that was a flat building, and there was the metal flashing was going around the building. And uh and as I'm looking out, I see these two little birds hopping. They're hopping and they stop dead center in the middle of the window. And I'm looking at these birds. I could see their heads going like this. And I then I said, "That's turtle doves. They're cooing. They're they're speaking to me." I couldn't hear them, but I knew the way they were going. And they were they were white. And they stayed there about 10 minutes. And when they flew up, I didn't see the third one. It was sitting down. And then you miss and all three of them. Brother Brandham said, "Three is life." So then I knew for sure, Satan, you cannot take this life. There was such a presence that came into the room for two days. I just wept. I just wept. The Lord the Lord was so so it it was it was absolutely incredible. Amen. And then he gave me a song. He said, "When you come out of the hospital, you will sing this song with your fam family." And I don't sing, but when he tells you you sing, you sing. So here's the song. Satan tried to take my life through prayer. The answer was on the way. Three turtle doves so pure and white. A glorious victory was in sight. This bloodline Satan cannot cross. He was stopped by love divine. Doves came to lead this eagle home. Pure and clean, made fully whole. And here I stand. And the Lord give me a brand new set of lungs. [Applause] So now now the the new lungs I'm unstoppable. I can play whatever anywhere, whoever. So here I want to play in the key of G. I want to play Amazing Grace for it. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord glory. That is my desire. Just if I can just instill in you a little bit of faith as my desire to leave here and and if you need healing or whatever, I just said, Lord, if that testimony will touch somebody's heart, that is my desire. God bless you and thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Jesus saved yesterday, today and forever. Blessed be his name. Blessed be his name. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Maybe Gastan was
