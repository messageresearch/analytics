missed service on Sunday but we had a bit of fellowship and it was a real wonderful time to be with a group of people we were with beautiful people and certainly thankful that we were able to take that time I want to thank brother Toby for his opportunity to bring the word but his desire to actually sacrifice to bring the word we just have uh I not used to coming coming to the pulpit with a fast song kind of took me by surprise it just makes me want to sing I feel like singing how can you not actually understand that he set you free and not just want to worship him that is something else God bless you brother faren for stepping in my goodness if you have a prayer uh prayer request tonight maybe just make it known un to him with an uplift hand we just have two requests that I wanted to bring one is for Sister Amy she said thank you she's wants to thank God for his faithfulness to me and my husband today we complete a year in marriage I regard this in regard to this I request the church pray for him to join me soon I also request for prayers for our marriage God bless you Sister Amy we certainly will pray for you sister we just want to remember Sister Adina who is now living in Canal Flats British Columbia for a while for work and if you have a need maybe just make it known as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you created the first marriage in heaven Lord and we know that that was for a very specific purpose it was to begin the display of your attributes father of you as a husband and you as a father that you would take for yourself a bride and Lord we thank you for this prayer request from Sister Amy tonight Lord we thank you that Lord she requires prayer she requests prayer for her marriage Lord Jesus I believe that every single one of us request prayer for our marriage outside of your spirit there's no way that we would ever be able to have a successful marriage in this world it's set up to oppose marriage because you instituted marriage from the start Lord we thank you for this request tonight father we pray that you would open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be closed we pray that you would just pave away for immigration visas to happen Lord that Lord they could come to the place of getting a permanent residency father Lord we ask that you would just be with everyone involved with this transition Lord and especially Sister Amy Lord we know that a sister needs her husband father we know that her husband needs his wife and father we pray that they could just be United together again father we love you and we thank you we just commit this request into your hands we want to remember Sister Adina as well father living in Canal Flats father for work working on her permanent residency father we pray that you would just open those doors Lord that need to be opened and close the others father that need to be shut we know that you have all things in your control Lord Jesus there's no surprises no no variance no shadow of turning of your ways Lord Jesus and we thank you for that we just commit these needs into your hands father we also want to remember each and every request made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand father Lord we know that your arm is not too short that you're fully aware of every single need father we just want to commit them into your hands father we'll be careful to give you the praise Lord we love you we thank you we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians certainly appreciate each one thank you for the specials tonight it sets an atmosphere we know that he's here tonight we just uh want to turn to Revelations chapter 2 continue our journey in the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations chap 2 start with verse 12 Revelations 2 verse 12 to the perian church John on the aisle of patmas being instructed by the angel of the Lord and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth s saving he that receiveth it let's just bow one more time am Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you that there's a new name given amen to your children and Lord to those who are willing to receive it father and if we're willing to receive it it's only by your grace that we heard because that blood was presented Lord Jesus and we know that it causes us oh Father to to go and tell you Lord Jesus how much we love you father tonight we love you and we just want to ask father for a special anointing on this service Lord that you would take the words that are spoken and father use them for your glory speak to your children one more time father don't forget about me I pray Lord we love you we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen am God bless you tonight you may be seated we're certainly glad to be back as I was mentioning as usual I get a little bit excited when I get into the pulpit especially with a a song like that you know um we're going to get into worship and uh I'm just certainly excited about it it's a wonderful thing it's our opportunity to express our love back to him and uh you know many people can say it should be a certain way and that it shouldn't be the other way and you know I think it's just up to the individual and we need to make sure that we just are not hindering the spirit when he wants to come on the scene because really the fruit of our lips is his Spirit manifesting through US amen and when we refuse that that is not a good thing but boy when we can actually offer it what what a blessing because you know it it's one thing to have the word in print and and to have the word in in audible format where we can press play and and listen to it but you know he's not looking for that he's he's not looking for the books and he's not looking for the tapes and he's not looking for the Bible he's not looking for print form he is print form what he's looking for is praise that's what he's looking for and we need to be that Living Word and give him that praise amen hallelujah we were away last weekend uh last Sunday when brother Toby took the service I thought it was just a wonderful service by the way we have to have the right foundation and if we don't have that right foundation it's not going to turn out right and uh you know just one little quote that brother Toby brought um from the message where brother bradam talks about that girl that got mixed up in her relationship and she married a man got after the man and and and What attracted her to him was his feet she said he had cute feet and that he smelled good can you imagine that brother brandham said I'd rather smell like a pole cat and have hands like a gravel or feet like a gravel truck than uh than be that way um we have to make sure that we have the right right right step right we have to make sure that we're we're looking for the character of Jesus Christ am and and I thought it was so good the way brother Toby brought it just a tremendous blessing to the body part one and to um as mentioned we went to a a little birthday party for a bunch of folks I think there was four people that turned 70 this year and uh I should be able to name them all but I probably won't be able to but it was out at a farm in Saskatchewan it was the berries and uh brother Jean and sister Bev uh sturby that used to attend here um it's actually her family she used to be a berry that was her maiden name so her brothers still live on the Family farm and it's I think just about a Heritage Farm they've been there since the early 1900s and um two of her brothers still live there and actively Farm it they have cattle and they had a birthday party there and a couple of people camped and it was just a wonderful time to see uh many Believers there and just to see them we haven't seen them for many years and uh just to have some some conversation and break break bread with them something special about eating together and so we really enjoyed the time away there so thank you very much for everyone that looked after things in our stead I would like to get into the uh the scripture but I see I still have some announcements we've got the youth hike this weekend um the 9th and the 10th Friday and Saturday um Junction Creek Falls is the event and uh I think the youth chat has all the information for those people that are going brother Andrew Glover will be here August 16th 17th and 18th um as far as I know everything everything is scheduled to go and we're certainly excited to see him again and to hear what the Lord has put on his heart are you happy tonight I think it's a wonderful thing brother Toby said it I didn't even realize it I never had thought of it that way but truly it is that way we need to be able to ask our spouse are you happy and we've got to be willing to actually accept the response and and then if if the response includes us then we've got to be willing to maybe do something something to try and help change that or or fix that and you know I I I certainly I know that if I I ask my wife that I I have to be willing to accept the the answer that she gives me and and I truly hope that she's happy and sometimes I know she's not but you know one thing that can happen which uh it's kind of sad but it's just human nature is when we know that she's not happy I ain't going to ask her are you happy why would I do that I mean but sometimes we're just not sure sometimes we just don't know and and it's good to express our joy it's wonderful to be able to ask the question and and not be afraid to have the relationship it's important so anyways getting into the word tonight I want to pick up in the seven Church ages the exposition of the seven Church ages from the pergami church age we left off at paragraph 79 last time brother Bram he says now I want you to be very careful here and see this this is still lot of pick up your pen and write and uh boy I could go back and do a whole recap but I want to try and push forward here um I want you to be very careful here and see this he says God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled and how did he promise it through a prophet God has prom promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is the spirit quickened word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it's just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in its last Church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation he will start at the Serpent's Seed and carry on to the messenger in the latter Reign but he will be rejected by the denominations isn't it interesting that not one place he says now I I will be right with the word I will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation I will start at the serpent seed and carry on to the messenger in the latter Reign but I will be rejected by denominations not one place he said that he said he will be because he wasn't looking to actually make himself that person what he was doing was pointing to the word saying that whether I am or whether I'm not there's going to be someone that will fulfill that word of God spoken by the prophet because it wasn't that Prophet it was God speaking through that human being it's just an amazing thing this is what captivated me with the message of the hour this man said it over and over again if you claim that I'm God's Prophet you say that I'm his Prophet just an amazing thing that that just captivated me paragraph 80 he has to be for that is the history repeating itself from the time from the time of Ahab Israel's history under Ahab is happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears as Israel left Egypt to Worship in Freedom pushed out the natives raised up a nation with great leaders like David Etc and then put an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same in America our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in Freedom they pushed back the natives and took over the land mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon an Ahab was set in the presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him it is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come and you know looking at this here what what happens when when you push back all of the natives and all of the idolatry when you push back all of that that uh Pagan worship and and you create a place for the Living God to manifest and you Worship in Freedom and you set up a country and you have the freedom of religion and you worship the one true Living God but then you have that character come into the leadership set up in such a way that now all of the things that we once thought were good and and were we can change them to suit the lifestyles that we would like and what happens is we take God out of society and by pushing God out of society what you do is you create a vacuum for all of that Pagan worship to come right back into society again and that's exactly what he's talking about here they left for this land to worship and live in Freedom and and they pushed back the natives and took over the land mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men and we know we we've read it already but this just was stimulating something in me uh and it's such a common word now or phrase cancel culture why do they want to do that because these Great Men set up a place where we could worship in freedom but what they do is turn around and say well what they they were involved in the slave trade so they're they're they're tainted men we need to cancel the culture a and we need to do away with that we need to forget about all of that if there is anything to do with any of that we need to shut it down and what happens is when you erase history you can pretty much predict the future because anything goes if you don't look at history you can't learn you can't correct from your mistakes but when you don't have a history to look at or you have uh maybe a fabled history then you can do whatever you want to do but this cancel culture just came to mind made me think about it what a terrible thing there's there's men that played a part and and some terrible men that played a part I don't dispute that for a second and isn't it wonderful that the prophet of God said that I think it was brother Bram said it that that man made slaves God never made slaves that is not the right thing that's a terrible thing never to be accepted but it wasn't just these men so anyways going on paragraph 82 then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel Showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former Reign and was rejected by the organizations of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter rain amen but this part here brothers and sisters is just for me uh it's just the hammer on the head it just hits it so hard Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come he will come to back up his word and take up his prde in the Rapture amen hallelujah he's not even going to come and take on the Creeds and the dogmas and the ination he's not coming to fight that he's not coming to push back against all of that he's just going to come and vindicate his word and his bride and then take her home amen the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion the strange behavior of Moses Elijah and John withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected but the the seed had been sown the planting was over judgment was next they had served their purpose as a sign to the people so judgment was next and to think we've been alive in this generation to receive that word that was planted and now we see that word growing up it's not just in seed form anymore is it the next paragraph the next paragraph I I I just think it's really important to look at this just a little bit paragraph 84 I believe according to Revelations 13:16 that a bride will have to that the bride will have to stop preaching for the Beast is demanding the mark in the hand or the forehead if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the Mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great Harlot we can read this and say that in the chronical chronological order that he has written this is the way that it's supposed to happen we have to be very careful because at the very beginning of this paragraph the first two words are I believe he doesn't say thus saith the Lord here in fact he preaches a sermon where he says that it's the secret sudden going away of the Bride he says the bride actually judges herself in the message of the hour not that she will be actually persecuted again there's some people that are pre-trib and post-trib and midrib the bride doesn't go through a tribulation she's not hunted down like a dog she is taken into the into the palace and she is set aside while Joseph reveals himself to his brethren I I don't want to say one way or the other but I do want to say this just like he said I predict in 1977 he didn't say thus sayith the Lord right he says I believe he doesn't say thus sayith the Lord it doesn't change the fact whether he's a prophet or not it's the word that he's speaking we have to be very careful on on how much we're going to put in one paragraph or even in one one sentence we have to be very careful about what he's saying when we take it an apply to our own lives now remember that Moses was born for a certain work but he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work he had to go out in the desert and wait there God had an appointed time there was to be a certain Pharaoh on the throne and the people had to be crying for the bread of life before God could send him back amen this is true for our day but what do we have in this our day multitudes are working signs until we have a great generation of sign Seekers I pray Lord help us not to be a generation of sign Seekers where if we don't have a prayer request go forwards and God doesn't answer it the way that we feel like it should be answered that we don't have it that's not it it's the word we have to have the word and all those signs and wonders will follow we got to put that word first I'll start over here he says but what do we have in this on our day multitudes are working signs until we have a great generation of have until we have a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God if they see blood oil and fire they are happy it matters not what is in the word they will support any sign even unscriptural ones and I want to say tonight brothers and sisters because someone speaks in tongues and interprets it or not it doesn't mean that the word is there we've got to be Uber careful ultra careful in the day in which we live because it'll be so close that it will deceive the very elected if it were possible the truly elected is going to say put the word of God first and if somebody's going to speak in tongues it's going to be in order it's going to be the way that the word of God says that it should be it's going to be the way that the prophet came and magnified the word of God says that it should be exactly what Paul preached that's what's going to happen and if it's any other thing it's not right don't be looking to speaking in tongues as a sign right and I'm saying that for a reason I can see it you you don't have to look very far and you can see there's a great push to see the the signs and wonders and and people are really anxious to try and support them it's great to have them but they're going to follow the word and if someone's not preaching the true word and the signs that are following are not going to be true signs but God has warned us about that he says he said in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two Spirits would be so close together that only the very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived so how close is it going to be brothers and sisters it's going to be right in in the very Church in which we go to we're going to see things and we're going to have to go like this but that doesn't change the word of God and it shouldn't change our heart it should give us a heart to have compassion and love for our brothers and sisters because brother Ram said it there's an order for everything and uh we'll get into that at a later date but I just think this is so important for us to remember we need to know exactly where we stand how can you tell the spirits apart he says just give them the word test amen just give them the word test are those Spirits saying yay and amen to the word or do they have some sort of a a navigation around it some sort of a detour some sort of a shortcut some sort of a something remember one word off and I just can't help but think about Hebrews chapter 1 you know we talked about it last time I saw that Minister saying it you know in sunry times and diverse manners God spake to the fathers and the guy stopped but how did he speak to him he spoke to him through the prophets but if you take the prophets out then you can just create whatever kind of you want it just goes right into the denominationalism the the theological study I've got the certificate I know the Bible I have a Theology and uh that's not it at all but how can you tell the spirits apart I love how the the word in the prophet gives us the question the great question how can you tell those Spirits apart if they're going to be so close that they would deceive their very elect just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one as the evil one deceived the first two Brides I love this he will try to deceive the Bride of this last days but by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her say bless God I had this happen bless God we had that happen bless God the other happened but yet not live a life that's consecrated to the word there's something wrong it's not the word but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah told the woman bake a cake for him first remember that woman that Great Famine that was in the land amen she came out with two sticks to make a cross with that there would be a a cross between the old Covenant and the New Covenant there would be something that would actually make a way for life in the midst of death she and her son were dying of starvation she came out and said we're just about to die all I've got are these two sticks put to get to put together and and one maybe one morsel of of meal and that's it and we're going to die there's nothing left and and and how could she have that Revelation where the Prophet would say to her bake me a cake go go make me a cake how many of the sisters in here would do that when your children are starving in the midst of a famine how many people in here would do that for our children when when we're going through that kind of a situation I would say the very elected would if they've got that Revelation because they know that's a prophet of God that stands before them and if he says give bake me a cake what's going to happen the beautiful thing is it's not even just a prophet standing before her she knew that was God she knew that was God in flesh now I'm not saying that was Jesus but that was God the spirit of God was upon that man and she knew it she knew it as when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the the what I thought the prophet said oh the word said when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the Miracle it's interesting how he's written this this is still thus sayith the Lord in pick up your pen and write it was the word when she did as the word said even though it was the prophet standing before her talking when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of of the word and deny some of it you just have to say right like the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him yes his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the Rapture but you take and and you look at it there's many people that will take predestination out of it they'll say we then you don't have a Choice you're not a free moral agent but we know isn't it wonderful how how brother brandham brought that out made that clear how God made that clear through the prophet no you are a free moral agency and God knows what the outcome is and and he will see his word come to pass just look at the prophet Micaiah and see that whole story and see if he won't make it come to pass he he will help us make the decision we'll make the right decision the circumstances will be such that we will make the right decision but we will make the decision it will be us amen the Royal Seed of Abraham with the faith of Abraham's will hold to the word with him for they are predestinated together the last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is it is the end time now as we all know for Israel is in the Homeland any time now he will come according to Malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated pointed out in the word Revelations 107 and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion Showdown I just think that's so good we uh I just want to make sure I I read this again brothers and sisters it it's so good it's just back in paragraph 82 here then in the latter rain will come Mount carel Showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter Reign Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take up his bride in the Rapture first Showdown was Mount Carmel second was the mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion but at the beginning of this last paragraph he says Jesus Will Be The Showdown Jes Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations we're going to get into it a little bit further here as we go uh many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers but this Prophet will come and as the Forerunner to the first coming cried Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God coming in glory he will do this for even as John was the messenger of Truth to the the elect so is this one the last Messenger to the elect and word born bride I I just think it's so amazing brothers and sisters it just makes me think about the king's sword when when reading this paragraph Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and the Creeds you think about that story about brother bradam praying and that sword hits his hand what is that sword hitting his hand it's not just some some storybook design that we would teach our children that once upon a time there was a man that was praying up in in sainia Canyon up in the mountains and and suddenly there was a sword and it was said it was the sword of the king that's that word that we're talking about Jesus Christ coming back to man you know we we I just want to preach now we are talking about it before service you know this whole AI thing sorry brother I just have to I don't know it's just happening this AI thing brothers and sisters is a direct link back to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and isn't that interesting because everything that Satan does is a perversion of what God's done has God not come himself and actually given us the direct link back to the Tree of Life Hallelujah why wouldn't Satan do that why wouldn't he come and try and pervert it now and make it look like it's this wonderful thing we've got all this knowledge we can do everything that we want to one of these days I'm going to actually take a look at it I've never really looked at it I've just heard Lots about it it's just an interesting thing I find Satan can only pervert he cannot create and this word this sword that was placed in the hand of man again is what's going to do the dividing that's what's going to give us the ability to overcome it all then all the signs and wonders will follow Christ eulogizes the church out of Revelations 2:13 he says I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth he says I Know Thy works these are the identical words uttered to each of the seven Messengers relative to the people of God in each age as they are spoken to the two Vines true and false spoken to the True Vine to the both Vines hey the true and the false they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group but they ought to strike Terror in the hearts of the other for though we are saved by Grace apart from Works true salvation will bring forth works or deeds that will please God in 1 John 3:7 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous now I just have this next sentence highlighted it's just so beautiful and and he just backs it up with verse after verse after verse if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is little children let no man deceive you he that doeth worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous got to put the word first James 3:11 do a fountain sent forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter no do we have have dual personalities no we have Christ personality amen Romans 6:2 how shall we that are dead in sin dead to sin live any longer therein how can we continue in the old way it doesn't work Matthew 1233 to35 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit and isn't that exactly what Jesus did he manifested it before his disciples and they marveled at it he went to the fig tree saw it wasn't right it wasn't there when the King of Kings walked by that tree he should have had fruit hanging on it but Jesus said hey your time has come and now you're going to wither up exactly according to this scripture here he goes on to say oh Generation of Vipers how can ye bring being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things my goodness he's not talking about opening up a treasure box and showing evil treasure he's talking about what we're speaking with our mouths 1 Peter 1:23 brother bam he says this first though now if a man is born of the word he will produce the word 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that is in him now I think it's real important to say this sometimes we can be a son or a daughter of God and we can have the wrong fruit being manifest on our branches we can have the wrong life being lived before others but that doesn't mean that we are not a son and daughter of God it's not up to us to determine that it's up to God to determine that it's up to us to water that tree to give encouragement to that tree to give the The Gift of Life to that tree to to speak good things about that tree many times we can look at the fruit and sayoo it's terrible that's terrible fruit it can never turn out right God is the master of those situations amen and if we have any question we don't have to look too far just take a look at Saul or or Paul Paul in the Bible he had a terrible life and everyone would have looked at him and said that guy there's no way that he would ever have anything to do with the Church of the Living God but but yet what was he he was the first church age Master he was the pattern for the church wow the fruit of the works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that's in him that seed can come to life it can actually be birthed into a new birth his Works therefore will be scriptural oh what an indictment this truth is going to be against the pergami and age there stands that matchless one and his hand in his hand the sharp sword with the two edges the word of God when I was studying this I just had this Vision that that there he stands with the sharp sword in his hand not even speaking a word but being the word and in the midst of all of the evil that word that sword in his hand a little bit this way a little bit this way everything is destroyed everything is proven by that sword he doesn't have to speak a word there he stands with that sword SW drawn the word Discerning everyone my the sword with two edges the word of God and that word will judge us in the last day in fact the word is judging even now for it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I say Lord just just discern my thoughts and and and the intents of my heart it cuts a under the carnal from the spiritual and it makes us living Epistles read and known of all men to the glory of God I Know Thy works if a man fears that he might not please God this is really good I'm going to pause here and just say this is really good this is really good let's just focus on this for a little bit shall we I Know Thy works if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of Praise Hallelujah do you ever wonder that do you ever wonder if if you ever have that fear in your life that you might not please God all you got to do is follow his word and don't worry about the big Supernatural things don't worry about the great service that we can bring to the kingdom of God just do the ABCs and if you wonder what they are see what the prophet had said just read conduct order and Doctrine look at church order look at those little tiny ABC Elementary things in the message of the hour and see does our life line up with that because if it doesn't then we maybe will have a little bit of fear will we please God if you want to please God follow the word of the prophet that's what we heard that woman came out and followed the word and what happened she had her life restored I think this is just so beautiful this gets me excited I think it's so beautiful you don't we don't have to fear I guess is really I'm where I'm going with this where I said I wanted to dwell on it brothers and sisters we don't have to fear alls we need to do is just fulfill the word and how do we fulfill the word just follow the word put the word out front hold that word before our families hold that that word before our wives hold that word before our children hold that word before ourselves let him fulfill the word of God at his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of Truth was the Criterion then at is the Criterion now there isn't another standard and isn't it interesting how the world has tried to make another standard we've got this Doctrine we've got that Doctrine we've got the other Doctrine you just take that pure word out and see what happens it becomes a freef fall without a parachute terminal velocity is next and then impact right the word of Truth was the Criterion then it's the Criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another Plum line as the world is going to be judged by one Jesus Christ not two not three even so it is going to be judged by the word if a a man wants to know how he's making out then let him do as James suggested suggested look into the mirror of God's word he makes it so clear and so easy here it's just amazing I didn't even say where it ended I put so much emphasis on it I just want to mention this here where where pick up your pen and write ends in the exposition of the seven Church ages is right where he eulogizes the church Christ eulogizes the church and we know what a eulogy is that's read at a funeral that's where someone's died and you know there is going to be a death there has to be a death in order for there to be a new birth there has to be a death and with outside of the new birth outside of the death to ourselves a and a new birth happening in our lives the only thing we've got is the eulogy that Christ will read about us that we just didn't follow his word we tried to put some sort of works or some sort of other thing ahead of it and the only thing that we've got is death at that point and that's to be eternally separated from God paragraph 97 I Know Thy Works wow I Know Thy works as he stood there with the word examining their lives in the light of the blueprint he had laid out for them he must have been pleased in goodly measure for they like others who had gone on before were enduring ing the persecution of the unjust and still joyfully cleaving unto the Lord difficult though it was at times to serve the Lord yet they served him and worshiped him in spirit and in truth but with the false Vine it was not so alas they had repudiated the life that was that is built upon the word and we're now going further and further away from the truth their actions bore witness to the depths to which they had sunk thou holdest fast my name John 668 to whom can we go thou alone Hast the words of eternal life they held fast then they were holding fast now but not with fatalistic dread as men who live out Barren lives they were holding fast in his Str stren in the insurance of the spirit that they were one in him I just want to encourage us tonight brothers and sisters it's going to be hard to serve the Lord we know that but just hold fast just hold fast and and have the Assurance of the spirit that you are one in him theirs was the sure knowledge of sins forgiven and they bore the name of Christian in testimony to it they knew and loved that name that was above every name their knees had bowed to that name their tongues had confessed to it whatsoever they did they did it all in the name of the Lord Jesus they had named that name and departed from Evil and having taken their stand they were now prepared to die for that name being assured of a better Resurrection now this can be taken really really sort of surface level and lightly but it's very important and and I can say for me in my Christian walk this was basically the Crux for me to understand the unlocking of the power of the spirit of God and in just in my life just in in my ability to overcome to recognize the name of Jesus Christ the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is where all the power is all of it take the name of Jesus with you he says child of sorrow and of wo we know this is a song it will joy and comfort give you take it then where a you go precious name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy Of Heaven he says already in the second century those words Father Son and Holy Ghost had spelled out Trinity to many and the polytheistic idea of three Gods had become a Doctrine in the false church I was thinking this is pretty strong it became a Doctrine in the false church and you know it's not in the in the I don't even know what you call it the satanic Church the Church of Satan that's not we're talking about that's not what he's talking about he's talking about the church that is so close to the real Church the The Vines are so close he's talking about it in a way that this is the majority of the churches have taken it this way already in the second century those words Father Son and Holy Ghost had spelled out Trinity to many and the polytheistic idea of three Gods had become a Doctrine in the false Church it would not be long until the name was taken away that's great as indeed it was in this age and in instead the titles of the one great God would be substituted for the name Lord Jesus Christ while the many apostasis and embraced a trinity and baptized using titles of godhead is beautiful the little flock still baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so held to the truth amen with so many dishonoring God turning him into three gods and changing his gracious name to titles one would wonder if the signs and wonders that attended to such great name would still be visited amongst the people indeed those signs would still be would indeed those signs were mightily and wonderfully manifested though certainly not in the false fine men like Martin were greatly used of God and bore them witness both by signs and wonders gifts of the Holy Ghost that name was still effectual as it always has been and ever will be where the Saints honor him through the word and Faith I'll call the musicians up as we read the last paragraph here I really would like to keep going thou Hast not denied my faith in Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle had taken place upon the at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his Jesus name through faith in his jesus' name had made this man former strong yay the faith which is by from him Jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is it can sound really confusing the way he has it written there but he says see there it is jesus' name and jesus' Faith brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith anymore than he claimed that it was it was his own name he said that jesus' name was used in the faith which is from Jesus performed that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelations 2:13 it was his faith amen it was faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers Hallelujah and he's the same yesterday today and forever maybe stand with me as close tonight brother Bram goes into it I'm not going to go further with it we'll pick it up later but it's all about having his faith brothers and sisters recognizing that it's is no longer our faith and there needs to come a place I just had this scripture it came to mind when I was reading this studying here in 1 Peter 1:8 whom he have not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory verse 9 says receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you to think about this here there's a place where it's the end of our faith where our human faith comes to the end and I believe it's on this side of Jordan and when we step over that that Jordan River and we take that spiritual death in our life we actually step into a brand new faith and that's where we get that Caleb and Joshua kind of Faith that's where we have a different level of living in our lives boy I feel like I could preach now my goodness let's just bow in prayer amen gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your word thank you Lord Jesus that we can read it and and we can hear it and we can see it loud and clear that father you spoke to us through the prophet you are
