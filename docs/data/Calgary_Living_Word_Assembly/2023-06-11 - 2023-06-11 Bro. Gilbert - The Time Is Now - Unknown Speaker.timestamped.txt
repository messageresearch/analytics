[1:00:57] as we look unto thee for your blessings
[1:00:59] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:01:03] let's turn to our Bibles Revelation
[1:01:05] chapter 5
[1:01:08] and 2nd Corinthians chapter 2.
[1:01:36] if you are there you can say Amen
[1:01:39] okay
[1:01:40] and I saw in the right hand from verse 1
[1:01:42] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:01:45] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:01:47] and on the back side sealed with Seven
[1:01:49] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:01:52] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:01:55] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[1:01:58] seals thereof and no man in heaven or in
[1:02:02] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[1:02:04] to open the book neither to look their
[1:02:06] own and I wept much because no man was
[1:02:10] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:02:12] book neither to look their own and one
[1:02:16] of the Elder says unto me weep not
[1:02:18] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:02:21] the root of David has prevailed to open
[1:02:25] the book and to lose the Seven Seals
[1:02:27] there are of
[1:02:29] second Corinthians
[1:02:32] chapter 2.
[1:02:37] 6 sorry second Corinthians chapter 6
[1:02:40] verse 7. to 10.
[1:02:58] by the word of Truth by the power of God
[1:03:02] by the armor of righteousness on the
[1:03:05] right hand and on the left by Honor and
[1:03:08] dishonor by evil report and could report
[1:03:11] as deceivers and yet true as unknown and
[1:03:15] yet well known as dying and behold we
[1:03:19] live as chastened and not killed as
[1:03:23] sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor
[1:03:26] yet making many regions as having
[1:03:29] nothing and yet possessing all things
[1:03:34] may God add the blessings you can have
[1:03:36] your seeds
[1:03:45] this morning
[1:03:48] the title of my sermon is the time is
[1:03:51] now
[1:03:54] on Wednesday
[1:03:57] they evangelize the Evangelist talked
[1:03:59] about the day this is the day that the
[1:04:03] Lord has met
[1:04:04] now we want to zero in from the day now
[1:04:07] to time
[1:04:09] the time is now now if somebody says the
[1:04:13] time is now the time is now for what
[1:04:16] there must be something to be done
[1:04:18] yeah as I said somewhere else
[1:04:21] if you find somebody that is defeated
[1:04:24] with life
[1:04:25] and says the time is now that person
[1:04:28] wants to commit suicide
[1:04:31] he or she has made a decision the time
[1:04:34] is now now for us to say the time the
[1:04:37] time is now there must be something some
[1:04:40] circumstances that we have seen and we
[1:04:43] say by this then the time is now
[1:04:49] now
[1:04:52] the subject is
[1:04:54] my name is in the Book of Life
[1:04:58] so if we can trace that to find your
[1:05:02] name in The Book of Life then that will
[1:05:04] be the greatest thing you've ever had in
[1:05:07] your Christian Life
[1:05:09] I've divided into three portions the
[1:05:12] first portion why is the book important
[1:05:15] why is it important
[1:05:17] you are always talking about the book
[1:05:19] the book the book why is it important
[1:05:21] then two
[1:05:23] what is your name there
[1:05:25] is one thing to talk about it but is
[1:05:27] your name there
[1:05:29] then after you know that your name is
[1:05:31] there then you can apply it
[1:05:36] amen now
[1:05:42] in the book where we have read in
[1:05:44] Revelation
[1:05:46] John says there was nobody
[1:05:51] to take the book and open it
[1:05:55] and because there was nobody to take the
[1:05:57] book and open it John wept John must
[1:06:01] have been very serious
[1:06:03] why he was so much interested in the
[1:06:07] contents of that book
[1:06:10] why because in that book
[1:06:15] it is your inheritance
[1:06:17] in that book there is your eternal life
[1:06:20] in that book there is your courtship in
[1:06:24] that book is all that you need
[1:06:29] so
[1:06:31] now back to Genesis
[1:06:33] when God made man he made him a fellow
[1:06:36] God
[1:06:39] man was supposed to speak things into
[1:06:41] existence
[1:06:43] you were supposed to speak things and
[1:06:46] happen
[1:06:48] why because Man was created in the image
[1:06:52] and likeness of God
[1:06:54] so if you are in the image and the
[1:06:56] likeness of God then you are a god of
[1:06:59] the Earth
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:03] but what happened when Adam failed he
[1:07:07] forfeited that book
[1:07:09] when he forfeited that book it went back
[1:07:13] to the original owner but it was made
[1:07:16] for us
[1:07:18] no the original owner He adjusted to
[1:07:21] hold it waiting for the Redemption
[1:07:23] claims
[1:07:26] was there are these Redemption of claims
[1:07:29] then he returns it back to the owners
[1:07:32] the beneficiaries of that book
[1:07:34] are you a beneficiary
[1:07:39] amen
[1:07:42] now
[1:07:43] when Adam failed
[1:07:47] all that made Adam God was detached from
[1:07:52] him
[1:07:54] and because we were in Adam
[1:07:57] we also lost the courtship
[1:08:01] now when we lost the courtship and that
[1:08:05] courtship it was raw it was put in a
[1:08:09] book and rolled with Seven Seals
[1:08:12] hello
[1:08:16] may God help us this morning
[1:08:21] it was
[1:08:22] it was Seven Seals
[1:08:28] and put aside then how are we going to
[1:08:31] benefit out of it
[1:08:35] and thus the result
[1:08:37] that book is very important
[1:08:41] we can talk about that book from January
[1:08:44] to December why because that book is
[1:08:47] very important
[1:08:48] when you get that book oh my goodness
[1:08:52] when you receive that book and identify
[1:08:55] your name that this is my name
[1:08:58] nobody can shake you
[1:09:01] hey man
[1:09:03] now
[1:09:05] this is what the prophet says
[1:09:08] 63 0 3 17 e if you can get it I will
[1:09:13] appreciate if not it's okay
[1:09:17] paragraph 116. now oh my now the
[1:09:20] forfeited died of deed is now in the
[1:09:23] hands of the original owner almighty God
[1:09:26] the title did to to the Earth and to
[1:09:31] eternal life when Adam forfeited it then
[1:09:35] Saturns that the hands could not hold it
[1:09:37] so it went back to its original owner
[1:09:40] God himself we are going to find out
[1:09:43] just in a minute there he sits on the
[1:09:46] throne with it in his hand the title did
[1:09:50] oh brother Prana who claps his hands
[1:09:53] now paragraph 117 all right Waiting For
[1:09:56] What in the hands of God waiting for the
[1:09:59] Redemption claims he made a way of
[1:10:02] redemption he made a way back and
[1:10:05] somebody someday the Redeemer is to take
[1:10:08] it back you see where we are getting to
[1:10:11] now we will watch this Pharaoh sitting
[1:10:14] upon the throne all right waiting for
[1:10:17] the Redemption claims it's Redemption
[1:10:19] what is this book of redemption this is
[1:10:23] the title did the abstract diet or did
[1:10:27] paragraph 119 its Redemption means all
[1:10:32] decompositions only composition to all
[1:10:36] that was lost by Adam and the eve oh my
[1:10:39] what ought that to do to upon again
[1:10:43] Christian
[1:10:47] decomposition to that Abstract title did
[1:10:50] the title did of eternal life means that
[1:10:54] you possess everything that Adam lost
[1:11:00] do you possess what Adam lost
[1:11:04] okay
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:09] okay
[1:11:15] in that book
[1:11:18] that was forfeited
[1:11:19] it had the package of our courtship
[1:11:24] but God has a law
[1:11:27] that the way we are born we cannot
[1:11:30] access that book
[1:11:31] until you are born again
[1:11:34] until you are born the way God wanted
[1:11:37] you to be born now we were supposed to
[1:11:40] be born by the spoken word
[1:11:42] the way Adam was born by the spoken word
[1:11:48] so if you have not been born by the
[1:11:51] spoken word there is no way you can
[1:11:52] access this book and if you cannot
[1:11:55] access this book then you don't have any
[1:11:57] legal claim
[1:12:00] to the promises of God
[1:12:03] okay
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] now this document is our record claim to
[1:12:10] our courtship isawarika claim to our
[1:12:13] inheritance to who we are in God's mind
[1:12:16] as sons and daughters that can sit and
[1:12:20] have fellowship with him
[1:12:25] fellowship and the communion must be of
[1:12:27] the same nature
[1:12:31] I'll explain it
[1:12:33] Fellowship God wanted to have fellowship
[1:12:36] and as long as you are in you are in him
[1:12:39] there was no way he could have
[1:12:41] fellowship with you so he had to produce
[1:12:44] you out so that now he can have
[1:12:47] fellowship with you but we are saying
[1:12:50] fellowship and the communion have to be
[1:12:52] of the same nature
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:56] if I find you
[1:12:59] with your chicken
[1:13:01] having fun oh you are so cute oh how are
[1:13:04] you
[1:13:06] you are having fellowship with chicken
[1:13:09] there must be something wrong yeah
[1:13:13] so fellowship and the communion must be
[1:13:16] of the same nature
[1:13:21] so for you to have fellowship with God
[1:13:23] you must have the nature of God in you
[1:13:29] or rest there is no way you can have
[1:13:32] fellowship with God
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:39] okay
[1:13:49] now
[1:13:52] why is that book important we've said
[1:13:56] it holds your inheritance
[1:14:00] it has your eternal life
[1:14:03] it has all the promises that God has
[1:14:06] made for you
[1:14:08] hello
[1:14:11] I will come very slowly because I want
[1:14:13] this one to sink deep
[1:14:16] if you have a problem with it you can
[1:14:18] come and see me or take time to listen
[1:14:21] to the quotes
[1:14:23] take time to read those quotes
[1:14:25] there is something I want to put across
[1:14:28] so that we can know who we are
[1:14:31] because if we say the time is now the
[1:14:33] time for what
[1:14:36] okay
[1:14:37] now
[1:14:41] there is one thing
[1:14:44] possessing the title
[1:14:47] and there is another thing occupying the
[1:14:49] title The occupying the property
[1:14:52] you can have the title but somebody else
[1:14:55] is
[1:14:57] living or staying on your property I
[1:15:00] would explain
[1:15:03] the title
[1:15:04] is just a paper
[1:15:07] you can have it you can keep it in
[1:15:10] yourself
[1:15:11] but when we go to your property it is
[1:15:14] somebody else occupying that property
[1:15:17] and your property can be your children
[1:15:20] your property can be your health
[1:15:23] your property can you can be your peace
[1:15:26] your property can be anything
[1:15:28] so you can have the title and the claim
[1:15:31] oh this is my title did I have the title
[1:15:34] did but the property this quarter is
[1:15:37] occupying it
[1:15:42] you can feel it now yourself
[1:15:44] what the pro what part of your property
[1:15:47] the squatter is occupying you have the
[1:15:50] title did oh you are so proud I'm a
[1:15:53] proud owner
[1:15:55] but who is okay
[1:16:00] the devil can be sitting on your
[1:16:01] property
[1:16:03] he can be sitting on your health
[1:16:06] he can be sitting on your joy
[1:16:09] you are even in the church and you are
[1:16:11] you you you just can't even enjoy the
[1:16:13] service
[1:16:14] why this quarter is sitting on your
[1:16:17] property
[1:16:18] but now if we say the time is now then
[1:16:21] the time has come for us to claim back
[1:16:25] what the squatter is living on
[1:16:28] the time is now
[1:16:36] so what is that property
[1:16:39] that the squatter is sitting on
[1:16:43] God help us
[1:16:46] so having the prop having the title it
[1:16:49] is not enough
[1:16:51] you need to occupy the property yourself
[1:16:56] I want to occupy the property myself
[1:16:59] I have the title did yes
[1:17:01] but I want to sit on my property myself
[1:17:07] God help us
[1:17:10] oh yes
[1:17:12] so you don't have to live under
[1:17:14] privileged life

[1:17:19] so I wonder how many of us have
[1:17:22] identified that their name is there

[1:25:27] deceivers and yet we are true
[1:25:31] oh my as a known and yet well known we
[1:25:36] may not be known in the world because
[1:25:38] for the world they try to look for the
[1:25:41] names of Honor Dr so and so but they ask
[1:25:45] we are not interested in the names of
[1:25:47] Honor we are interested in our names in
[1:25:50] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:54] oh my
[1:25:56] as sorrowful and yet always rejoicing
[1:26:02] oh my goodness you look at somebody may

[1:26:19] there and when you come to the point
[1:26:21] where you say I know and I know truly my
[1:26:25] name is there then you must have seen it
[1:26:27] when once you see your name you can
[1:26:30] never remain the same
[1:26:33] that I your identification of that name
[1:26:37] in that book it brings a change in your
[1:26:39] life
[1:26:40] it changes the way you look at things it
[1:26:44] changes the way you behave it changes
[1:26:46] the way you dress it changes the way you
[1:26:48] act it changes the way you respond to

[1:27:23] make sure you see your name
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:30] now
[1:27:31] when I say that all that Adam lost
[1:27:35] is in this book
[1:27:39] I wonder how many can believe this
[1:27:44] that all that Adam lost
[1:27:48] oh my goodness
[1:27:49] I may not have time to read everything
[1:27:51] okay
[1:27:54] now now in the message unveiling of God
[1:27:57] now my subject this morning that is 6406
[1:28:00] 14 m
[1:28:02] paragraph 22. now my subject is moaning
[1:28:05] I trust that God will reveal this and
[1:28:08] each time if you who take the tips and
[1:28:10] listen and I hope and the trust that you
[1:28:13] have had a spiritual understanding of
[1:28:15] what god of what that God has been
[1:28:18] trying to get over to the church without
[1:28:21] saying it right out
[1:28:23] then it might be that some would say Oh
[1:28:25] you mean God would purposely do a thing
[1:28:28] like that he certainly does it
[1:28:31] one time
[1:28:32] the crowd was just too large for him
[1:28:35] then he said unless you eat my
[1:28:38] flesh
[1:28:39] and drink my blood
[1:28:42] all right some people looked at you say
[1:28:45] they said no
[1:28:47] that's too much
[1:28:49] they walked away
[1:28:53] the crowd reduced
[1:28:55] they remained seventh ministers oh we
[1:28:57] are ministers of the Gospel
[1:29:02] he made another statement they said no
[1:29:04] that is too much
[1:29:06] they walked away they remained 12. why
[1:29:09] he was reducing the number
[1:29:12] to remain only those who believed in him
[1:29:18] so
[1:29:20] he said now the twelve who remained he
[1:29:23] said okay you are still here
[1:29:25] oh you're still coming to church okay
[1:29:27] no yeah he met even a harder statement
[1:29:32] do you also want to go go
[1:29:35] he was not pleating with the people
[1:29:36] please come to church oh we are going to
[1:29:39] have sandwiches no
[1:29:42] no
[1:29:42] he only wanted the thoroughbred
[1:29:47] the cream
[1:29:49] those who can believe on him regardless
[1:29:52] of the circumstances
[1:29:54] they will say Amen no matter what they
[1:29:57] will say Amen that is me
[1:30:01] so he thinned the crowd until they
[1:30:04] remained 12. but Peter said to whom else
[1:30:07] can we go
[1:30:09] you have to come to a point where you
[1:30:11] say to whom else can I go I've come this
[1:30:14] far I've come this far where else can I
[1:30:17] go
[1:30:20] God help us
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:27] okay
[1:30:37] now when the lamb takes the book he
[1:30:40] passes it down to the prophet the word
[1:30:42] comes to the prophet and the Prophet The
[1:30:45] Prophet reveals it and is out in books
[1:30:49] and tips
[1:30:50] oh my
[1:30:53] now in the message the guide
[1:30:55] 62 10 14 e 6 2 10 14 e paragraph 35.
[1:31:06] and the Holy Spirit always speaks of the
[1:31:08] word I've got many things to tell you
[1:31:11] you cannot understand it now but when he
[1:31:14] comes he will guide you to it that is
[1:31:18] the reason the coming of the seals at
[1:31:21] the finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:31:24] mystery of God should be finished to
[1:31:27] know who God is what he is how he lives
[1:31:32] his nature his being you are supposed to
[1:31:36] be all the way up here by that time see
[1:31:40] bring us into the full stature of Sons
[1:31:44] and Daughters of God
[1:31:46] we are supposed to be way up
[1:31:49] but what is happening we are doubting
[1:31:52] even what God has met us
[1:31:55] we can't even believe ourselves
[1:31:58] go to have mercy on us
[1:32:01] okay
[1:32:10] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:32:12] 6507 25e
[1:32:18] paragraph 147.
[1:32:24] that that shall never die it's
[1:32:27] constantly unrolling itself from the
[1:32:30] very thing happening to the picture
[1:32:32] being Jesus standing looking at us how
[1:32:35] many have seen that picture
[1:32:42] nobody has seen that picture
[1:32:49] if you have not seen that picture how
[1:32:51] have you seen your name
[1:32:53] God have mercy the evening light has
[1:32:56] come caught vindicating himself what is
[1:32:59] it it is the fact that God and the
[1:33:01] Christ are one
[1:33:04] the white how many seen it the white
[1:33:07] weak upon him as we talked in Revelation
[1:33:10] 1. see the Supreme deity supreme
[1:33:12] authority no other voice no other God no
[1:33:15] other nothing in him towards the
[1:33:18] fullness of the godhead bodily the
[1:33:21] Angels themselves was his weak amen what
[1:33:25] has happened on Mount Sunset God
[1:33:27] confirming his word that's what all this
[1:33:31] noise is about it is God fulfilling his
[1:33:35] promised word again Revelation 10 1-7
[1:33:39] and Saint Luke 17 30 being fulfilled now
[1:33:43] we can say this day this scripture has
[1:33:46] been fulfilled and we Are Witnesses
[1:33:50] okay never despise Revelation there is
[1:33:54] power behind revelation
[1:34:00] okay
[1:34:03] let me jump
[1:34:06] okay
[1:34:09] so now who came down on Mount sunset

[1:34:22] to know this is sure and you that listen
[1:34:25] to to this step you might have thought
[1:34:28] today that I was trying to say that
[1:34:30] about myself being that I was packing
[1:34:33] this message I have no more to do with
[1:34:36] it than nothing no more than just a
[1:34:40] voice and my voice even against my
[1:34:43] better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper
[1:34:47] but it is the will of my father that I
[1:34:50] declare to do and determined to do I
[1:34:53] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[1:34:55] river
[1:34:57] I was already standing there when he
[1:35:00] appeared who appeared
[1:35:06] I'm not the one that performs these
[1:35:09] things and foretells these things that
[1:35:10] happens as perfect as they are I'm only
[1:35:14] one that is near when he does it
[1:35:18] I I want us to have the confidence of
[1:35:20] what who we have in our meetings
[1:35:23] who came down we are not following a man
[1:35:27] he says against even his better judgment
[1:35:30] he was only a voice
[1:35:33] that God used to speak to
[1:35:37] he was only standing there where these
[1:35:40] things were being performed now who was
[1:35:42] performing these things God Has Come
[1:35:44] Down For What so that you can Unite with
[1:35:48] him until you come to a point where you
[1:35:50] say I and my father are one
[1:35:57] oh yes
[1:36:00] the angel was not the son of man he was
[1:36:03] the messenger from the son of man the
[1:36:06] son of man is Christ he is the one that
[1:36:09] you are feeding on
[1:36:11] he is the one you are fitting on on on
[1:36:16] not a man his words with a man's what
[1:36:19] will fail but your feet feeding on the
[1:36:23] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:36:26] if you haven't felt fully on every word
[1:36:29] to give yourself strength to Fly Above

[1:36:44] is my name there
[1:36:48] is your name there
[1:36:54] 63 0 3 17 e the bridge between the seven
[1:36:58] Church H's and the Seven Seals please
[1:37:01] I'm coming now to our subject
[1:37:03] just laying the foundation so that we
[1:37:06] know we have seen the importance of the
[1:37:08] book
[1:37:09] now if you are convinced
[1:37:11] of the importance of this book then you
[1:37:13] will be concerned what is your concern
[1:37:16] is my name there
[1:37:17] so now we are coming to a point where we
[1:37:20] want to know is my name there how do you
[1:37:22] know how can you identify your name
[1:37:25] how do you know that your name is there
[1:37:28] so paragraph 300 in the preach
[1:37:32] say is my name there I don't know
[1:37:36] now imagine you go to the prophet
[1:37:39] yeah
[1:37:40] and ask him
[1:37:42] Prada pranam is my name there then it
[1:37:45] tells you I don't know
[1:37:49] if you are not there you will be
[1:37:52] discouraged and say
[1:37:54] if it is not there is not there
[1:37:58] do I care huh
[1:38:01] the way the young men would say it if
[1:38:04] it's not there it's not there who cares
[1:38:07] [Laughter]
[1:38:09] but if you are a serious candidate
[1:38:12] you will care
[1:38:15] so now is my name there
[1:38:18] then he says I don't know
[1:38:21] so some will stop there and walk away
[1:38:25] but those who are serious
[1:38:27] they want to follow up
[1:38:30] because they want to be sure their names
[1:38:33] are there so let's now follow that story
[1:38:36] oh I hope it is but if it is it was put
[1:38:40] on the book before the foundation of the
[1:38:42] world is my name there because this book
[1:38:45] is very important
[1:38:47] this book is very important
[1:38:50] the preachers have been talking about it
[1:38:52] so this book is very important is my
[1:38:54] name there
[1:38:56] okay
[1:39:00] can we know if our names are there yes
[1:39:03] paragraph 301 but the first thing that
[1:39:06] represented represented that Redemption
[1:39:09] come the lamp that had been slain from
[1:39:12] the foundation of the world and he took
[1:39:15] the book Glory opened the book and tore
[1:39:18] of the seals and said send it down to
[1:39:20] the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal
[1:39:24] it to his people
[1:39:29] he takes the book he keeps it to the
[1:39:33] seventh angel to reveal it to who to his
[1:39:42] okay
[1:39:46] 6307 28 paragraph 449
[1:39:50] we are still dressing is my name there
[1:39:52] we want to see how you know your name is
[1:39:54] there okay
[1:39:56] paragraph 449 63 0-728 paragraph 449
[1:40:01] Jesus said at that day which day
[1:40:05] this and that is this day at that day
[1:40:08] when this Revelation is made known you
[1:40:11] will know that I am in the father and
[1:40:14] the father in me I in you and you in me
[1:40:17] when the Revelation is met manifest at
[1:40:21] that day he shall know that I and my
[1:40:24] father are one I am in the father and
[1:40:27] the father is in me then when the
[1:40:29] Revelation comes forth then it is I in
[1:40:33] you you're in me there you are
[1:40:39] that is part of it
[1:40:41] there you are you can see your name now
[1:40:43] yeah
[1:40:45] at that day
[1:40:48] okay
[1:40:53] paragraph 5 24 the same book the same
[1:40:56] message
[1:40:57] now you see the seals when he is in his
[1:41:00] mediatorial work back they are redeeming
[1:41:03] but someday he comes forth to get this
[1:41:06] book that he has redeemed and all that
[1:41:09] is in this book would be him
[1:41:15] I expected a very big amen because he
[1:41:19] says all that are in this book
[1:41:22] huh
[1:41:23] it is you
[1:41:27] so if so far you have not seen your name
[1:41:30] then I don't know
[1:41:31] where else you are going to look for
[1:41:33] your name because I'm trying to show you
[1:41:35] how you can identify yourself now in the
[1:41:38] book

[1:41:41] so he says and all that is in this book
[1:41:44] would be him for that is the believer
[1:41:46] the words in the book and the word is
[1:41:50] him and all that is in that he come
[1:41:53] forth for this book of redemption whose
[1:41:56] names are written on the book before the
[1:41:58] foundation of the world when he was
[1:42:00] laying as a lamp so there you are
[1:42:06] okay
[1:42:11] oh my
[1:42:15] okay still paragraph but the first thing
[1:42:17] that represented that Redemption come
[1:42:19] the lamp that had been slain from the
[1:42:21] foundation of the world and he took the
[1:42:24] book Glory opened the book and tore of
[1:42:27] the seals and said send it down to the
[1:42:29] Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it

[1:43:46] give him a portion

[1:46:51] the message of restoration 62 0-422
[1:46:55] paragraph 86.
[1:47:02] enforcement or water text how I'd like
[1:47:06] to have two days on that enforce
[1:47:09] to restore means to bring it back
[1:47:12] or to restore Acclaim can it be enforced
[1:47:15] now to bring anything back to its
[1:47:18] rightful honor where it belongs
[1:47:20] therefore some way it went away from its
[1:47:24] rightful honor and can wander around
[1:47:26] anywhere but to restore is to bring it
[1:47:29] back to
[1:47:31] bring it back to it who really owns it
[1:47:34] or to bring it back to its natural
[1:47:37] estate where it was at the first time
[1:47:39] bring it back into the natural condition
[1:47:42] paragraph 85 like if somebody stole some
[1:47:45] property and they are holding the
[1:47:47] property captive then you can take the
[1:47:50] law and call to this person and the law
[1:47:53] forces and forces this person to restore
[1:47:56] this property back to its natural honor
[1:47:59] into its liable fast estate the same law
[1:48:03] that made me to be born and shaped in
[1:48:06] iniquity never taught how to speak the
[1:48:08] first lie all the demons in my lineage
[1:48:11] loted in me the devil enforced it in his
[1:48:14] time but now it's my time
[1:48:18] now it is my time
[1:48:23] I wonder if we can recognize that
[1:48:26] that now is my time
[1:48:28] we can leave that door change to people
[1:48:31] but now is my
[1:48:37] amen
[1:48:38] the law forces it doesn't beg
[1:48:42] oh please please please no the law
[1:48:45] forces
[1:48:47] oh yes
[1:48:48] you remember what happened when Jesus
[1:48:50] Christ came to the demons
[1:48:52] they saw him far
[1:48:54] and they say why have you come before
[1:48:56] our time
[1:48:59] how many are afraid that scripture
[1:49:01] the demon says they see him from far
[1:49:05] they say why have you come before our
[1:49:07] time
[1:49:10] if we can exercise our courtship
[1:49:13] the demons will see us from far I said
[1:49:16] why have you come before our time so the
[1:49:19] demons know their time
[1:49:21] but I wonder if we know our time
[1:49:32] so the law forces it does not beg
[1:49:39] man
[1:49:42] okay
[1:49:44] if Saturn okay 60 okay still in the same
[1:49:47] same message of restoration paragraph 98
[1:49:51] if Saturn has robbed you of the
[1:49:52] privilege of being a son and a daughter
[1:49:54] of God we have a right this morning by
[1:49:59] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of
[1:50:02] God bring them back

[1:50:22] free by his grace if something in the
[1:50:25] word can make you realize
[1:50:28] hello
[1:50:30] if something can make you realize what
[1:50:34] is that something is the revelation
[1:50:37] if you catch that Revelation if
[1:50:39] something in the word can make you
[1:50:41] realize
[1:50:43] when you catch that revelation
[1:50:46] then what will happen oh what makes you
[1:50:50] understand or some Act of God that it
[1:50:52] would that it included you it includes
[1:50:55] us all then you just accept it on those
[1:50:58] basis and you are free also you don't
[1:51:02] have to feel any different you don't
[1:51:04] have to feel anything at all it's not
[1:51:07] based on feelings
[1:51:10] Jesus didn't say did you feel it
[1:51:13] did you believe it
[1:51:19] oh my
[1:51:21] oh my okay I got the same same paragraph
[1:51:28] faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds
[1:51:31] the sharp to HD sword of God and that
[1:51:35] sharp to HD sword will cut every Promise
[1:51:38] free
[1:51:40] if that arm of faith is able to yield
[1:51:44] that sword some people has very weak
[1:51:47] muscle
[1:51:48] muscle trouble and they can just may be
[1:51:52] just cut off a little scratch
[1:51:55] enough to join a church
[1:51:58] others can come into justification some
[1:52:01] can go all the way to the baptism of the
[1:52:03] Holy Spirit a great strong arm holding
[1:52:07] this Bible can cut every Promise free
[1:52:13] so how strong are your muscles
[1:52:20] how strong are your muscles
[1:52:24] how strong are your muscles
[1:52:27] do you see people in the gym
[1:52:29] yeah
[1:52:31] without somebody supervising him or her
[1:52:34] yeah
[1:52:38] trying to gain muscles
[1:52:42] so how strong are your muscles
[1:52:46] some have just very strong
[1:52:48] weak muscles they just scratch
[1:52:52] others they can just go up to
[1:52:53] justification
[1:52:55] others will just go up to sanctification
[1:52:59] others will go all the way up to the
[1:53:01] baptism of the Holocaust
[1:53:04] but what we are talking about you go
[1:53:07] beyond until you say your name in the
[1:53:10] book
[1:53:12] when you say your name in the book all
[1:53:15] these are included in that package
[1:53:20] hello
[1:53:21] yes if you go all the way so it depends
[1:53:25] how much I how strong are your muscles
[1:53:29] hello
[1:53:31] oh my goodness
[1:53:35] amen as you amend the word you
[1:53:39] strengthen your muscles
[1:53:41] but if we have not said I meant since we
[1:53:43] started
[1:53:52] that is me that is me Hallelujah glory
[1:53:56] to God you strengthen your muscles
[1:54:00] oh my
[1:54:02] oh my
[1:54:05] okay
[1:54:15] God works in unexpectable way
[1:54:20] some things that you think in your mind
[1:54:23] that how God is going to work it out it
[1:54:26] may not work it out that way
[1:54:28] why he works in unexpectable way
[1:54:32] sometimes he answers prayers and yet you
[1:54:35] are still praying for it
[1:54:41] why because in your mind you have your
[1:54:44] own way
[1:54:46] on how you expect things to be done or
[1:54:49] how you expect God to answer that prayer
[1:54:51] he might have answered that prayer a
[1:54:53] long time ago and yet you are still
[1:54:56] praying praying for it okay
[1:55:01] okay
[1:55:03] now it reminds me
[1:55:05] Second Kings this story in second Kings
[1:55:08] chapter two let's let's open it I want
[1:55:12] us to get something there
[1:55:15] before we close
[1:55:18] I know some people are praying that I
[1:55:19] finish
[1:55:22] but before their prayers are answered
[1:55:24] let's look at this story
[1:55:29] second Kings chapter three
[1:55:40] okay
[1:55:50] are we there
[1:56:05] it's a beautiful story here
[1:56:08] from verse 1.
[1:56:11] now tehoram son of Ahab began to Reign
[1:56:15] Over Israel in Samaria the 18th year of
[1:56:18] Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned 12
[1:56:22] years
[1:56:24] and he wrote evil in the sight of the
[1:56:26] Lord but not like his father and like
[1:56:28] his mother for he put away the image of
[1:56:31] Baal that his father had met
[1:56:33] nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of
[1:56:37] jeropoham the son of nebot which made
[1:56:40] Israel to sin
[1:56:42] he departed not the route from and the
[1:56:46] Misha king of Moab was a sheep sheep
[1:56:48] master and rendered unto the king of
[1:56:51] Israel and a hundred thousand lamps and
[1:56:53] 100
[1:56:54] 000 Rams with a wool but it came to pass
[1:57:00] okay it came to pass when Ahab was dead
[1:57:02] that the king of moha prepared against
[1:57:04] the king of Israel and the King jehoram
[1:57:08] went out of Samaria and the same time
[1:57:12] and numbered all Israel and he went okay
[1:57:15] let's jump to verse 11.
[1:57:17] but Jehoshaphat said is there not there
[1:57:20] uh not here a prophet of the Lord that
[1:57:23] we may inquire you can read the whole
[1:57:25] story now from verse 1 but let's because
[1:57:28] of time but Jehoshaphat said is there
[1:57:32] not here a prophet of the Lord that we
[1:57:34] may inquire of the Lord by him and one
[1:57:37] of the king of Israel's servants
[1:57:39] answered and said here is Elisha the son
[1:57:43] of shaffard which brought water on the
[1:57:46] hands of Elijah and Jehoshaphat said the
[1:57:50] word of the Lord is with him so the king
[1:57:53] of Israel and the josephat and the king
[1:57:56] of Adam went down to him and Elijah said
[1:58:00] unto the king of Israel what have I to
[1:58:03] do with thee get thee to the prophets of
[1:58:06] of thy father and to the prophets of thy
[1:58:09] mother and the king of Israel said unto
[1:58:12] him nay for the Lord hath called these
[1:58:15] three kings together today deliver them
[1:58:18] into the hand of Moab and Elisha said as
[1:58:22] the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I
[1:58:25] stand surely where were it not that I
[1:58:28] record the presence of josephat that the
[1:58:31] king of Judah I would not look toward
[1:58:35] thee nor CD but now bring me a mystery
[1:58:39] and it came to pass when the mystery
[1:58:41] played that the hand of the Lord came
[1:58:44] upon him and he said thus says the Lord
[1:58:48] make this Valley full of ditches okay
[1:58:51] this is the situation they were going
[1:58:53] they were in a fight they had gone the
[1:58:55] wrong way of the desert until they were
[1:58:58] so weary because there was no water so
[1:59:00] they needed some water but then
[1:59:03] Jehoshaphat advised them now you are
[1:59:05] looking forward
[1:59:06] of it
[1:59:09] oh yeah Elijah is there so when they
[1:59:12] went to Elijah he said bring me the
[1:59:13] musician so that after the musician
[1:59:16] played then the word of the Lord came to
[1:59:18] Elijah and told them what to do now this
[1:59:21] is this is what he told him make
[1:59:24] Bus 15 verse 16. and he said that says
[1:59:29] the Lord make this Valley full of
[1:59:31] ditches for thou says the Lord he shall
[1:59:34] not see wind neither shall I ye see rain
[1:59:37] ye that yet that Valley shall be filled
[1:59:41] with water that he may drink both ye and
[1:59:44] your cuddle and your beasts
[1:59:49] make this Valley full of ditches
[1:59:57] make this body full of ditches
[2:00:01] read these messages
[2:00:04] yeah
[2:00:05] the more you underline them you are
[2:00:08] making body full of ditches
[2:00:11] yeah
[2:00:12] so after you make body full of ditches
[2:00:15] what happens now the water came
[2:00:18] they didn't see the rain they didn't see
[2:00:21] the wind but what happened the water
[2:00:23] came
[2:00:24] you will not see the wind you will not
[2:00:26] see the rain but what will happen the
[2:00:28] water will come
[2:00:30] make this body full of dishes read the
[2:00:33] word listen to the word as you listen
[2:00:36] you are making values full of dishes and
[2:00:40] what will happen water will come and you
[2:00:43] will drink and even your animals they
[2:00:46] will also drink
[2:00:47] God help us
[2:00:49] make Valley full of dishes
[2:00:53] oh my
[2:00:57] oh yes
[2:01:00] now
[2:01:02] we are talking about enforcing now
[2:01:05] the claim
[2:01:09] you have won the case
[2:01:11] you have the title the legal claim
[2:01:16] now what happens in most cases
[2:01:19] you look for the agent
[2:01:22] yeah who is the agent
[2:01:26] you must have an agent the prophet says
[2:01:29] the holy spirit is your agent
[2:01:33] yeah
[2:01:35] oh my
[2:01:38] now we have an agent that God has given
[2:01:42] us who listens to your instructions
[2:01:44] because you are unaware of God
[2:01:48] oh my goodness if we cannot say Amen to
[2:01:51] that one
[2:01:52] then I I wonder if we really have the
[2:01:54] agent
[2:01:57] yeah the prophet says the holy spirit is
[2:02:00] our urgent
[2:02:03] I don't have to read that quote but I
[2:02:04] will just quote it the prophet says
[2:02:06] somebody stole our brother's vehicle
[2:02:09] and the prophet says he engaged the
[2:02:12] agent he sent the agent the Holy Spirit
[2:02:15] who condemned that person until he
[2:02:18] abandoned the vehicle
[2:02:23] so if you have an agent
[2:02:26] yeah
[2:02:27] this quarter understands the agent
[2:02:31] he only knows the agent
[2:02:34] oh my goodness illegal fraternity there
[2:02:36] are some names you mentioned then once
[2:02:39] you mention that oh he says who who is
[2:02:42] your who is your legal agent you
[2:02:45] mentioned that name then your opponent
[2:02:46] will just surrender I cannot argue with
[2:02:49] that person
[2:02:51] you have already won the case so who is
[2:02:54] your agent
[2:02:57] who is your agent
[2:02:59] now what if you don't have the Holy
[2:03:01] Spirit
[2:03:02] so you don't have an agent
[2:03:05] and that's why you just copy for him to
[2:03:08] plead oh mercy oh mercy no if you have
[2:03:11] an agent the prophet says the agent
[2:03:14] listens to your instruction
[2:03:17] is
[2:03:19] and you send the agent
[2:03:21] what happens the squatter knows the
[2:03:24] agent
[2:03:25] oh my goodness
[2:03:28] may God help us who is your agent
[2:03:34] God help us
[2:03:37] oh my okay
[2:03:41] now
[2:03:46] stealing the message of restoration 6204
[2:03:49] 22
[2:03:50] paragraph 89.
[2:03:53] but the law of the spirit of God is to
[2:03:56] force Saturn to give up
[2:03:58] that which he has unrightfully and
[2:04:00] deceptically taken from God Souls of men
[2:04:04] he took from God source of women
[2:04:06] children sicknesses of the body he
[2:04:08] placed upon people where God Made Them
[2:04:11] In His Image to be like him and the
[2:04:13] church is given the rightful legal
[2:04:15] rights
[2:04:18] you have been given
[2:04:20] now it is you to exercise it
[2:04:23] can we exercise it
[2:04:25] can we take it
[2:04:27] oh my goodness
[2:04:30] now
[2:04:31] okay paragraph 134 I love this
[2:04:36] paragraph 134 and God speaks something
[2:04:40] and that is our law and the Holy Spirit
[2:04:43] is here to enforce that law amen for the
[2:04:46] believer you have to be ordained to do
[2:04:49] so and it takes a Believer you got to
[2:04:52] have the badge of a believer
[2:04:58] you got to have the badge of a believer
[2:05:03] yeah
[2:05:05] you put it here
[2:05:09] the badge of ah
[2:05:16] even before you speak
[2:05:18] if we are packing your courtship
[2:05:22] if we are packing your courtship with a
[2:05:24] badge of a believer
[2:05:27] this quarter looks at you and he knows
[2:05:30] who you are
[2:05:33] yeah
[2:05:35] you remember the sons of skeva
[2:05:40] the demons are Paul we know
[2:05:44] so they know
[2:05:45] so if you have a batch of a believer
[2:05:49] how men are wearing that patch of I
[2:05:51] believe
[2:05:54] you have a patch
[2:05:57] wherever you go
[2:05:58] just wear that patch of a believer
[2:06:02] yeah
[2:06:03] what makes you that because you have
[2:06:06] identified your name
[2:06:09] and now you are packing your equal claim
[2:06:12] oh my
[2:06:15] okay
[2:06:19] God's law okay
[2:06:24] how to enforce it
[2:06:26] as long as you are you are you as long
[2:06:30] as your name is on that book then you
[2:06:32] have a law that is not in other people
[2:06:36] You Have To Know Your Law
[2:06:39] you have to know you alone
[2:06:42] there is a law that you need to have
[2:06:45] enough faith that you just need to relax
[2:06:47] about the situation
[2:06:49] you committed to God and call you away
[2:06:53] I wonder how many can get to that point
[2:06:57] but you just committed to God and call
[2:07:00] you away
[2:07:01] and allow their law
[2:07:04] to have its way
[2:07:08] I wonder how many can get to that point
[2:07:12] the prophet says the fish they have
[2:07:15] alone
[2:07:16] yeah
[2:07:18] it can stand it can die why it is
[2:07:22] exercising the law that is in in it the
[2:07:25] buds in the air they have a low because
[2:07:27] they have weight they are outbound they
[2:07:30] are supposed to come down according to
[2:07:31] science but instead they Co-op Against
[2:07:34] Gravity why because they exercise the
[2:07:37] law
[2:07:38] now what if a Believer today you really
[2:07:42] know the law that is in you and you
[2:07:45] exercise that law what will happen
[2:07:52] how many today they know they have a law
[2:07:57] how to exercise that law the prophet
[2:08:00] says let go and let God
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:06] let it go and let God
[2:08:10] let the law have its way
[2:08:13] why I know the law that is in me
[2:08:18] I know and I want to exercise that law
[2:08:22] oh my
[2:08:26] God what happens
[2:08:27] if you know
[2:08:29] that you have that law
[2:08:31] then we can give the devil as someone
[2:08:35] yes
[2:08:37] yes we can keep the devil this morning
[2:08:40] as someone
[2:08:45] how many are ready
