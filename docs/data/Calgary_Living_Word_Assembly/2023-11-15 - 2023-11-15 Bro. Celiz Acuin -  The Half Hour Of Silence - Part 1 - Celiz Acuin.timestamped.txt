[40:02] will do something to upset you um and
[40:08] I I was just singing the song today just
[40:11] listening to it I must tell Jesus and I
[40:14] did a bit of uh research on who wrote
[40:17] the song it was written by a pastor
[40:20] called Elisha hufman in the late 19th
[40:23] century um he had gone to visit a woman
[40:28] one of the members of his church who was
[40:30] in great distress and sorrow and uh he
[40:33] advised her as much as he called with no
[40:36] success until at some point he looked at
[40:39] her and said the woman kept saying what
[40:41] shall I do what shall I do and he
[40:43] replied and said you cannot do better
[40:45] than to Take It All to Jesus you must
[40:48] tell Jesus
[40:50] and for a moment he said she seemed
[40:53] abstracted in meditation and then her
[40:56] face glowed our eyes lighted up and with
[41:00] a huge animation she exclaimed yes I
[41:03] must tell Jesus I must tell
[41:06] Jesus and I believe uh this is the
[41:09] testimony of all of us and uh if it
[41:12] applies to you as well I'll just invite

[1:14:02] 16 in the message entitled a thinking
[1:14:05] man's filter
[1:14:08] 1965 and I'm
[1:14:11] anxiously waiting for the
[1:14:14] hour to where we can all
[1:14:17] congregate in one place and preach on
[1:14:22] those seven PL
[1:14:24] flags and seven
[1:14:27] vials and the
[1:14:29] trumpets and so forth they all happen
[1:14:34] right in a
[1:14:36] cluster you say Amen brothers and
[1:14:38] sisters amen is that
[1:14:42] right the seven Trumpets the prophet of
[1:14:45] God said they are for Israelites yes sir
[1:14:49] all
[1:14:50] right and the Seven vials they are for
[1:14:54] the foolish
[1:14:56] virgins how many understand
[1:15:00] that that's why brother Bram said in his
[1:15:04] teachings that while the seven trumpets
[1:15:08] are
[1:15:09] sounding over
[1:15:14] Israel because God sent his two prophets
[1:15:17] Revelation 112 and 3 Moses and Elijah
[1:15:21] and that is the Feast of the trumpets
[1:15:23] for the children of Israel Byam said
[1:15:27] okay and these seven
[1:15:30] vials and these seven
[1:15:32] trumpets they
[1:15:34] happened during the Great
[1:15:37] Tribulation for a period of three and 1
[1:15:41] half years is that correct yes brother
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] amen sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit
[1:15:51] to Daniel listen now in
[1:15:54] closing the Seven
[1:15:57] Seals seven
[1:15:59] trumpets seven
[1:16:02] vials three woes woman in the sun
[1:16:06] casting out of the
[1:16:08] devil or the red
[1:16:11] dragon comes between these
[1:16:14] times
[1:16:16] during the Great Tribulation period
[1:16:19] don't forget it all this things amen
[1:16:25] take place during this
[1:16:31] time amen I believe you are able to
[1:16:33] follow yes sir amen come on
[1:16:36] brother now some people believes in the
[1:16:40] seven years Great Tribulation after the
[1:16:42] Rapture is that right but the prophet
[1:16:45] does not teach that the prophet
[1:16:49] teaches that there's only three and one
[1:16:52] half years Great Tribulation no seven
[1:16:56] years because this is what the prophet
[1:16:59] of God
[1:17:00] said while the seven
[1:17:03] trumpets are sounding to
[1:17:06] Israel to call and seal the
[1:17:11] 144,000
[1:17:13] Jews of Revelation chapter 7 is that
[1:17:16] right 144,000 were sealed sealed there
[1:17:21] by the two Prophets Ministry of
[1:17:23] Revelation 11 2 and three Moses and
[1:17:26] Elijah is that
[1:17:29] correct while the seven trumpets are
[1:17:31] sounding for Israel the seven vials of
[1:17:35] woes are being poured to the foolish
[1:17:38] virgins who were left behind from the
[1:17:43] Rapture
[1:17:45] Hallelujah the Great
[1:17:47] Tribulation is in Revelation chap 6 12-1
[1:17:51] 17 which is the six seal is that correct
[1:17:54] brothers and
[1:17:55] sisters and the preaching of the two
[1:17:58] prophets is in Revelation 11
[1:18:01] 3-13 yes sir it happened the prophet of
[1:18:05] God said it happened at the same time
[1:18:09] uhuh three and one half years only not
[1:18:13] seven
[1:18:14] years excuse me would like
[1:18:21] to in the message entitled six seal
[1:18:27] 1963 then God dealt with the
[1:18:31] Gentiles till they took out a people for
[1:18:35] his
[1:18:36] name as soon as the Gentile church is
[1:18:39] taken out he taken up the
[1:18:42] church and when he
[1:18:44] did excuse the sleeping
[1:18:48] virgin the bride went up and the church
[1:18:51] itself was put put into outer Darkness

[1:32:55] to
[1:32:56] announce and on the seventh seal there
[1:32:59] is no Beast to announce it no powers to
[1:33:03] announce it see no one does it after the
[1:33:07] fourth seal there is no Announcement by
[1:33:12] any beast power from the fifth six or
[1:33:16] the seven seal not at all now notice I
[1:33:21] love this the prophet of God said as in
[1:33:24] the times of the rider of the four
[1:33:26] horses the rider singular of the four
[1:33:30] different horses there was a beast that
[1:33:32] announced the power every time the rider
[1:33:36] struggled another horse and comfort to
[1:33:39] ride another kind of a Beast come out
[1:33:42] and announce it that's a great mystery
[1:33:46] that is the mystery why announcing the
[1:33:50] mystery amen
[1:33:52] why isn't there one here on the fifth
[1:33:56] seal to announce it here it is according
[1:33:59] to the Revelation that the Lord Jesus
[1:34:02] gave me today or this morning
[1:34:05] early that is that the mystery of the
[1:34:09] church ages are already
[1:34:13] finished at this time that's amen The
[1:34:18] Mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at
[1:34:21] this
[1:34:22] time the Antichrist took his last
[1:34:26] ride and we found him on his Pale Horse
[1:34:31] mix with his many colors and rides all
[1:34:35] the way into
[1:34:36] bition we get it on the trumpets and so
[1:34:39] forth when we teach that I'd go to it
[1:34:43] now but we get plumed off the subject
[1:34:45] again that's the reason there is no one
[1:34:49] there we know written
[1:34:53] cause some reasons for something
[1:34:56] remember at The First beginning I said
[1:34:59] can't be nothing without a reason
[1:35:01] remember the littleit drop of ink now
[1:35:05] you got to find the reason well there
[1:35:08] was some reason they did not have to
[1:35:09] have a beast or a power to announce it
[1:35:12] this seal being
[1:35:15] broke Only God Can
[1:35:19] reveal why that's all
[1:35:22] amen but the reason that he reveals it
[1:35:26] as I understand that it is because the
[1:35:29] mystery of the book of redemption as far
[1:35:34] as the Antichrist being revealed and at
[1:35:37] the same time the church is gone and
[1:35:41] these things don't even happen in the
[1:35:43] church AIDS amen the fifth sale the
[1:35:48] sixth C they don't pertain to the church
[1:35:52] age anymore brother R said but the seven
[1:35:56] seal amen that's still
[1:36:00] part help the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:05] amen the four stages of his riter has
[1:36:08] been revealed the four stages of the
[1:36:11] Antichrist writing has been revealed at
[1:36:13] this time therefore they don't have to
[1:36:15] have
[1:36:16] anymore and there was four living
[1:36:18] creatures of God to announce the writer
[1:36:21] as they wrote for V are four poers now
[1:36:25] we know that this by interpretation of
[1:36:28] the terms of the Bible symbols means
[1:36:31] power now let's get that close the
[1:36:34] forist in the Bible represents a power
[1:36:38] among the people yes amen praise the
[1:36:42] Lord and this power did not came from us
[1:36:45] his power came from the Lord Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ and it was given to us to come
[1:36:52] the attack of the Antichrist against us
[1:36:55] in these last days brothers and
[1:36:57] sisters without the presence of God
[1:36:59] without the Holy Spirit without the word
[1:37:01] of God we will not be able to withstand
[1:37:04] this world is full of
[1:37:07] deception this world is controlled by
[1:37:10] the devil but God is good God be praise
[1:37:15] because he has given us his powers

[1:38:55] prophet of God
[1:38:58] said the seven seal 1963 and when the
[1:39:01] seals were opened God noticed he omitted
[1:39:07] revealing even any symbol of the seventh
[1:39:11] one it's a perfect
[1:39:14] secret with
[1:39:16] God

[1:44:45] church and we are
[1:44:47] just vessels of God right amen nothing
[1:44:51] to to
[1:44:54] Glory but save our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:44:56] Christ
[1:44:58] amen we just want the word and the Holy
[1:45:01] Spirit to channel and speak the thoughts
[1:45:04] of God not our thoughts that's
[1:45:06] why I plan to stay with what the prophet
[1:45:09] of God said just present it to the
[1:45:11] church and let it speak to you from the
[1:45:15] Holy Spirit and give you Revelation and
[1:45:18] understanding of this great message that
[1:45:21] came from
[1:45:23] God he has given it to us brothers and
[1:45:26] sisters amen that should be the name of
[1:45:28] the
[1:45:30] Lord 7even seal
[1:45:42] 1963 so just remember the seventh
[1:45:45] seal the reason it was not
[1:45:48] open see the reason it did not reveal it
[1:45:51] no one should know about it that shows
[1:45:54] it's from God for see it fits exactly in
[1:45:59] the promises of God yes from the end of
[1:46:02] the message you notice for the End of
[1:46:07] Time message this seal End of Time
[1:46:11] message after he has revealed all the
[1:46:13] six but he did not say nothing about the
[1:46:17] seven and the end time time seal when it
[1:46:23] starts it will be absolutely a total
[1:46:27] secret according to the Bible before
[1:46:30] knowing that remember Revelation 10
[1:46:33] 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel
[1:46:38] message yes at the end of the seventh
[1:46:43] angel message all the mysteries of God
[1:46:48] would be known yes brother we are at the
[1:46:52] end time the opening of The Seven
[1:46:58] Seals
[1:47:01] amen the prophet of God
[1:47:04] said the seventh
[1:47:06] angel will open the mysteries of the
[1:47:10] seven seal why there was silence in
[1:47:13] heaven why why God did not show it in
[1:47:17] any form even in symbols God wants to
[1:47:22] keep this seven seal in secret he don't
[1:47:26] want anybody else to know about it yes
[1:47:30] even Satan the devil God does not want
[1:47:33] him to see or to hear anything of this
[1:47:37] great secret
[1:47:38] mystery amen amen that's the reason
[1:47:42] brother Brenham said it was kept silent
[1:47:45] and has no
[1:47:47] symbol on it he said the seven seal
[1:47:51] 1963 now
[1:47:53] why why this is
[1:47:55] silence why this is
[1:47:58] silent if
[1:48:00] Satan should get a hold of it he might
[1:48:05] do great damage yes there is one thing
[1:48:10] he don't
[1:48:11] know he can interpret anything he wants
[1:48:15] to and impersonate any kind of a gift
[1:48:19] true that's true I hope you're learning
[1:48:22] but he can't
[1:48:24] know that it's not even
[1:48:27] written it's not even written in the
[1:48:30] Bible yes sir amen it's a total
[1:48:36] secret Hallelujah prophet of God said
[1:48:39] Satan will know nothing about it you
[1:48:42] want something to happen you have to
[1:48:45] take my word for this if I'm planning on
[1:48:49] doing something uhh I know better than
[1:48:52] to tell anybody about
[1:48:54] it not that that person would tell
[1:48:57] it but Satan will hear it
[1:49:01] amen see he can't get
[1:49:04] it in my heart there as long as God has
[1:49:10] got it closed up with the holy spirit so
[1:49:13] that's between me and God he don't know
[1:49:18] nothing about it until you speak it he
[1:49:22] hears it and I have tried I tell people
[1:49:25] I'll do a certain certain thing and
[1:49:27] what's the devil cut off every will he
[1:49:31] can to get there before you to bit me to
[1:49:34] it true but if I get the Revelation from
[1:49:37] God and just don't say nothing about it
[1:49:40] sir then it's
[1:49:42] different amen and that's one of my
[1:49:45] weakness I will I will not you know
[1:49:48] include you in that sometimes I'm very
[1:49:50] excited oh I'm going to do
[1:49:52] this you know you can't hold it anymore
[1:49:56] because you're excited you want to tell
[1:49:57] the word what you want to plan to do but
[1:50:00] you know it behoves us sometimes to just
[1:50:03] be
[1:50:04] silent and pray before God what's what's
[1:50:07] ever inside this heart
[1:50:09] amen
[1:50:13] now remember Satan will try to
[1:50:18] impersonate every
[1:50:21] thing that the church will
[1:50:23] do try to do it we notice it through the
[1:50:27] anti
[1:50:28] christ you see that brothers and
[1:50:32] sisters the impersonation of
[1:50:36] Christianity in these last
[1:50:38] days did not the prophet
[1:50:42] said the first bride was deceived e and
[1:50:47] here e deceived the denomination and
[1:50:50] Pentecostals by saying in the Book of
[1:50:54] Genesis I have gotten a man from the
[1:50:57] Lord and by saying that the denomination
[1:51:00] took it and they said we don't believe
[1:51:02] in serpent seed because if said he has
[1:51:05] gotten a man from the Lord that was
[1:51:09] him that said he has gotten a child from
[1:51:12] the Lord not the word of God and that's
[1:51:16] why when the denomination and been read
[1:51:19] that they don't believe in serpent seed
[1:51:21] yes sir deceived by Eve amen they were
[1:51:25] deceived by
[1:51:27] Eve yes sir the the first bride was
[1:51:29] deceived yes sir and she is
[1:51:33] deceiving the people sir by the word
[1:51:38] amen
[1:51:40] amen and the prophet of God said the
[1:51:42] second bride was also deceived in 3:25
[1:51:47] ad0 amen and she is doing the deceiving
[1:51:54] now Hallelujah the second bride that was
[1:51:58] deceived she is
[1:52:02] deceiving the
[1:52:04] People by the word yes sir by the
[1:52:08] perverted word
[1:52:09] right right and they are going to try to
[1:52:14] deceive what the third bride brother
[1:52:16] said because the third bride is the
[1:52:19] restor and pure bride in these last days
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:26] hallelujah can you say Amen to that
[1:52:28] brothers and sisters is that
[1:52:31] correct amen amen and that's why the
[1:52:35] prophet of God said the false anointed
[1:52:38] ones in these last days and the true
[1:52:40] anointed ones in these last days the
[1:52:42] only difference that you can see between
[1:52:46] them it's not their life they can copy
[1:52:50] the fruits of the Holy Spirit too amen
[1:52:53] they're also good they they changed life
[1:52:57] but brother bam said the only difference
[1:53:01] between the false anointed ones and the
[1:53:05] true anointed ones is their
[1:53:09] teaching their teaching is contrary to
[1:53:12] the word of
[1:53:15] God they are also baptized with the Holy
[1:53:19] Spirit by
[1:53:20] said they are genuinely the prophet of
[1:53:23] God said they are genuinely baptized
[1:53:26] with the holy spirit amen but in their
[1:53:30] soul they disbelieve the message of the
[1:53:33] hour they disbelieve and add and
[1:53:36] diminish the message of the prophet and
[1:53:39] they claim to be the Bride of the Lord
[1:53:42] Jesus Christ to waiting for the
[1:53:45] Rapture
[1:53:46] amen I do believe that this church is
[1:53:50] not the second bride that was
[1:53:52] deceived this church is the third bride
[1:53:56] amen that true restored third bride the
[1:54:01] true church of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:04] that believes every
[1:54:08] word and say to the word of God Amen to
[1:54:12] every word of God

[1:55:31] study and with good motive and intention
[1:55:34] God through the holy spirit will reveal
[1:55:36] it to the pastor to the ministers to the
[1:55:40] true members of the fightful ministry
[1:55:42] amen hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:55:45] Jesus okay let me wrap this this up May
[1:55:49] my brothers and sisters amen before
[1:55:52] I close this part one message amen
[1:55:58] so see
[1:56:02] that there's no
[1:56:04] mimic to the seven seal no impersonation
[1:56:08] because it was silent yes sir no
[1:56:11] symbol Satan has no idea what it
[1:56:15] is so it cannot be impersonated because
[1:56:18] brother bam said Satan can impersonate
[1:56:20] everything he hears everything he saw is
[1:56:24] already already have a copy cut no
[1:56:27] that's how the devil is but in this
[1:56:30] seven sh the prophet of God said he said
[1:56:33] remember
[1:56:34] Satan will try to impersonate
[1:56:39] everything and the prophet of God said
[1:56:41] but this is one
[1:56:44] thing excuse
[1:56:48] me
[1:56:50] this is one
[1:56:52] thing he cannot
[1:56:56] impersonate there'll be no mimics to
[1:56:59] this because he don't know there's no
[1:57:03] way for him to know
[1:57:05] it it's the third
[1:57:10] pole he just knows nothing about it he
[1:57:14] doesn't understand it and what is the
[1:57:17] third poll brother Bram said the
[1:57:20] opening of the
[1:57:23] word what is the third pull is speaking
[1:57:26] the word into existence and Satan cannot
[1:57:33] create amen that power to create belongs
[1:57:37] to
[1:57:37] God and to his sons and daughters only
[1:57:42] Satan cannot do it Satan cannot speak
[1:57:45] the word into
[1:57:46] existence that's why he cannot
[1:57:48] impersonate ated brothers and sisters he
[1:57:51] cannot mimic this glory to Jesus
[1:57:55] Hallelujah that's the third pool bam
[1:57:58] said amen amen glory to
[1:58:03] Jesus
[1:58:08] amen one more quach Christ is the
[1:58:11] mystery we revealed
[1:58:14] 1963 God's great
[1:58:16] mystery of how it's a secret
[1:58:20] he kept it a
[1:58:21] secret nobody know nothing about it even
[1:58:25] the angels did not understand it no he
[1:58:28] did not reveal it that's the reason
[1:58:30] under the seventh mystery when the
[1:58:33] seventh seal was open there was silence
[1:58:37] yes Hallelujah Jesus when he was on
[1:58:39] Earth they wanted to know when he would
[1:58:41] come he said not even the son himself
[1:58:46] don't know when it's going to happen God
[1:58:48] has this all to himself is a secret and
[1:58:50] that's the reason there was silence in
[1:58:52] heaven for a space of half
[1:58:54] hour
[1:58:56] and notice brothers and sisters
[1:59:02] and seven
[1:59:04] Thunders yes sir uttered their voices
[1:59:08] and John was even forbidden to write it
[1:59:12] see the coming of the Lord uhuh there's
[1:59:15] one thing he has not revealed it of how
[1:59:18] he will come
[1:59:20] and when he will come it's a good thing
[1:59:24] that he
[1:59:25] doesn't know
[1:59:28] amen blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:59:30] there are many
[1:59:31] quotations you can read in the message
[1:59:33] of the Prophet where he
[1:59:36] said that
[1:59:39] the the seven seal is the coming of the
[1:59:45] Lord yes sir now what coming brother
[1:59:47] Bram said there are are two kinds of
[1:59:51] coming
[1:59:52] appearing and coming in Corporal form
[1:59:56] amen that's what the prophet of God said
[2:00:00] before the Corporal body comes to redeem
[2:00:04] the bride he will appear
[2:00:10] firstall and brother Bram said
[2:00:12] Revelation 101 to4 yes that's the
[2:00:17] appearing of Christ on
[2:00:20] Earth as a mighty
[2:00:22] angel with an open book with the Seven
[2:00:27] Seals broke amen amen to reveal the
[2:00:31] Mysteries to the seventh angel brother
[2:00:33] Bram amen that's the appearing of
[2:00:38] Christ the appearing has to happen
[2:00:40] before the coming because the appearing
[2:00:43] will prepare the bride for the rapturing
[2:00:46] Fai he cannot come come in his second
