[20:36] [Music]
[20:38] And I was born

[20:51] Think about that tonight. Oh, I hold
[20:55] for the presence
[20:59] of the Lord. Won't Jehovah flash
[21:03] tonight. Oh,
[21:06] let my life
[21:10] now be
[21:13] so consecrate
[21:16] it all to thee
[21:20] that I might be
[21:24] what I was born
[21:27] to.
[21:30] Yes, I
[21:32] was born
[21:36] to be
[21:38] heart.
[21:46] I hope
[21:49] for the presence
[21:52] of my Lord.
[21:59] Let my life
[22:04] now be
[22:07] so concentrated
[22:13] that I might be
[22:18] what I
[22:24] stand for as we sing this song. It's not

[22:58] and through
[23:02] eternity.
[23:05] Oh, I'm going to sing his praise.
[23:12] Oh, and I
[23:19] will

[23:30] a privilege it always is to come into
[23:33] the presence of the King of Kings and
[23:34] the Lord of Lords, the only God, the
[23:38] living God. Oh, Father, you're the same
[23:41] yesterday, today, and forever, Lord
[23:43] Jesus. And the same miracles that you
[23:45] did, Lord, when you were walking on this
[23:47] earth, Lord. Father, you're doing
[23:49] through your bride even right now, Lord
[23:51] Jesus. Oh father, that same healing

[24:20] Jesus. And this evening, Lord, let us
[24:22] open up our hearts to receive the word,
[24:24] Lord, and to give us the revelation,
[24:27] Lord, and the understanding of your
[24:28] word, Father. Lord, let us be a
[24:30] lighthouse to all those in this wicked
[24:32] generation, Lord. In this darkness, oh
[24:35] Father, that's taken over this world,
[24:37] Lord. Oh, Father, we're so glad that you

[25:20] he? Ever. He always comes where he's
[25:22] invited and you've invited him tonight.
[25:25] Here we are singing this song. He
[25:27] touched me. Shackled by a heavy burden.
[25:31] Well, I was shackled
[25:33] by a heavy
[25:37] burden.
[25:40] Oh, I was peaceful,
[25:44] a load of guilt
[25:47] and shame.

[25:54] the hand of Jesus
[25:58] touch me.

[26:13] he touched me.
[26:16] Oh,
[26:17] yes, he touched me.
[26:22] You always have
[26:26] the joy
[26:28] that loves my soul.

[27:16] I will never cease
[27:20] to praise your God.
[27:24] Oh

[27:34] Oh yes, he touched me.
[27:39] Oh
[27:41] yes, he touched me.
[27:47] Lord

[27:56] for something
[28:00] happened
[28:02] and now I know
[28:07] he touched me and he made
[28:12] me
[28:14] for something
[28:18] happened
[28:20] and Oh, I know
[28:24] [Music]
[28:26] he loves me
[28:28] and he

[28:36] you.
[28:39] [Applause]
[28:44] Oh, and Jesus,
[28:46] you are all the world to me.
[28:53] Oh, without your love I wouldn't want to
[29:00] be.
[29:02] Oh,
[29:04] you gave your life so that I might live
[29:10] and now my heart to you I give.
[29:16] Jesus, you are all the world to me.
[29:23] Oh,
[29:25] your goodness is a treasure
[29:29] that I am so unworthy
[29:33] of.
[29:35] So I commit my fragile heart to the
[29:40] mercies of your love.
[29:44] Oh, your truth and your forgiveness.
[29:49] My soul cannot resist.
[29:55] And all the sin in God, it comes down to
[30:00] it.
[30:04] Oh yes Jesus, you are all the world to
[30:10] me.
[30:12] Oh,
[30:14] without your love I wouldn't want to be.
[30:22] Oh Lord,
[30:24] you gave your life so that I might live.
[30:30] Now my heart.
[30:33] [Applause]
[30:35] Jesus, you are all the world to me.
[30:42] Oh, in
[30:44] all of life that matters and in all that
[30:50] I hope most
[30:54] is to know you. Jesus is the thing, the
[30:59] thing that matters most.
[31:03] For when I did did not know you, you
[31:09] made your choice.
[31:13] And now with every breath,
[31:18] I lift my voice.
[31:23] Oh Jesus, you are all the world to me.
[31:29] But it told me what to come. Oh,
[31:33] without your love, I wouldn't want to
[31:38] be.
[31:40] Oh,
[31:42] you gave your life so I might live. And
[31:48] now my heart to live my
[31:54] you are all the world to me. Oh Jesus,
[32:01] you are all the world to me.
[32:07] Oh
[32:09] without your love I would want to be.
[32:16] Oh Lord,
[32:18] you gave me life so that I might live.
[32:24] And now my heart to you. I give
[32:30] [Music]
[33:02] God bless you churchless
[33:04] [Music]
[33:06] Uh this is an old song. It's probably
[33:09] hundreds of years old. One of the songs
[33:12] we learned as kids and sang in church.
[33:16] It's titled I shall be no stranger
[33:19] there.
[33:21] Talks about when the plegator opened and
[33:26] it just occurred to me that if Jesus is
[33:30] not a stranger to you here, then you
[33:33] wouldn't be a stranger there. Amen. But
[33:36] if he's a stranger,
[33:39] then there's no opportunity.
[33:42] I pray you be blessed.
[33:45] It's my confession. I believe it's yours
[33:47] as well.
[33:49] [Music]
[34:02] When the pearl
[34:04] gates are opened
[34:08] to a sinus
[34:10] saved by grace
[34:13] when through everlasting
[34:17] mercy
[34:19] I behold
[34:21] my savior's face
[34:25] when I enter
[34:27] in the mansions
[34:30] of the city
[34:33] pride and fair.
[34:36] I shall have a royal welcome
[34:41] for I'll be no stranger there.
[34:46] I shall be no stranger there.
[34:52] Jesus will my place to prepare.
[34:57] He will greet me. He will greet me. I
[35:03] shall be no stranger there.
[35:08] True times ever changing seasons.
[35:13] I am pressing
[35:16] to all the gold.
[35:18] Seize my heart, sweet native country.
[35:23] It sees the homeland of my soul.
[35:29] Many loved ones clothed with beauty
[35:34] in those wonderous glorious year.
[35:39] When I rise redeemed, forgiven,
[35:44] I shall be no stranger there.
[35:49] I shall be no stranger there.
[35:55] Jesus will my place prepared.
[36:00] He will meet me. He will greets me. I
[36:05] shall be no stranger.
[36:10] There my dear redeemer leaving
[36:14] blessed lamb upon the throne
[36:20] by the creing
[36:22] lights upon them. He will surely
[36:27] claim his own.
[36:30] So whenever
[36:32] you're sad and lonely,
[36:35] look beyond
[36:37] this threatening care.
[36:40] We reach out of God. Remember
[36:44] you will be
[36:46] no stranger there.
[36:49] I shall be no stranger there.
[36:54] Jesus. Yes. my place prepare.
[36:59] He will meet me. He will greet me. I
[37:04] shall be no stranger.
[37:09] He will meet me. He will greet me. I
[37:14] shall be no stranger.
[37:20] [Music]
[37:26] [Applause]
[37:34] wonderful, wonderful promise and a
[37:35] wonderful confession. What a wonderful
[37:38] just comfort and encouragement to know
[37:40] that that's the truth. If we're one of
[37:42] his and we're part of him, we won't be a
[37:44] stranger there. Thank you, my brother.
[37:46] That was just really enjoyable. Just
[37:49] makes you homesick, doesn't it? just
[37:51] around the next bend. As we've said many
[37:53] times, maybe stand with me if you would
[37:55] as we call our pastor, lead me, Lord.
[37:59] It's hard to take the first step. The
[38:01] Lord leads the way.
[38:04] [Music]
[38:06] When it's hard to take the first step,
[38:11] when I don't know the way.
[38:16] Each step is so uncertain.
[38:21] But I learn to walk by faith.
[38:26] But you gave me the promise
[38:30] that you will never leave.
[38:35] You will lead and guide me.
[38:39] And Lord, I do believe.
[38:44] Lead me.
[38:49] I
[38:51] will follow.
[38:54] Lead me
[38:58] and I
[39:00] will grow.
[39:04] You have called me
[39:09] and I have answered.
[39:14] Lead me home
[39:17] and I
[39:19] will go. Oh, your plans for me are
[39:24] perfect.
[39:26] I never need to fear.
[39:31] Although sometimes I feel alone, I know
[39:36] that you are here.
[39:40] My heart just wants to follow.
[39:45] I'm willing to
[39:48] [Applause]
[39:50] take my hand in lead
[39:54] and I'll follow
[39:59] your way.
[40:01] me.
[40:04] I
[40:06] will follow
[40:10] me
[40:13] and I
[40:15] will go.
[40:19] Oh, you have called me
[40:24] and I have
[40:29] leave you alone
[40:32] and I
[40:37] Jesus your name
[40:41] is power.
[40:46] Oh Jesus, your name
[40:50] is mine.
[40:54] Oh Jesus, your name will break.
[41:04] Jesus, your name.
[41:09] [Music]
[41:11] Oh yes.
[41:13] Jesus your name
[41:17] is healing.
[41:22] Oh Jesus your name
[41:26] is.
[41:29] [Music]
[41:30] Oh Jesus your name it will create.
[41:38] [Music]
[41:40] Oh Jesus, your name
[41:44] is
[41:46] our pastor.
[41:48] Oh Jesus, your name
[41:53] is
[41:58] Oh Jesus. Jesus, your name
[42:02] is
[42:08] Jesus. Your name is
[42:14] every other
[42:17] Jesus. Your name
[42:20] is
[42:24] Amen.
[42:26] Hallelujah. God bless you tonight.
[42:28] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[42:30] Certainly an honor and a privilege to
[42:32] gather together in the name above every
[42:35] name. If you have a need tonight, maybe
[42:37] just make it known unto him by way of an
[42:39] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[42:43] Gracious heavenly father, tonight, Lord
[42:45] Jesus, we don't take it lightly that we
[42:48] get to stand in your presence, Father.
[42:51] Lord Jesus, I just was thinking today
[42:55] how you sent angels from your presence.
[43:00] But yet, Lord, the angels said that they
[43:02] stand in your presence.
[43:06] It's impossible to understand that word
[43:09] how how it could be that way. They're
[43:11] standing in your presence, but yet
[43:13] they're sent from your presence. Lord
[43:16] Jesus, tonight we recognize that we're
[43:19] talking about different dimensions.
[43:22] And we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that
[43:24] even though our earthly senses can't
[43:26] declare your presence, oh Father, your
[43:29] word says that you're here. And we thank
[43:32] you for that, Lord Jesus. And Father, we
[43:35] know that you had an angel come from
[43:38] your presence, still standing in your
[43:40] presence and minister to your bride in
[43:43] this last age, and tell us about who we
[43:46] are, Father, we're so thankful for your
[43:48] grace and your mercy to us, Lord.
[43:51] Father, tonight we just want to commit
[43:52] each need made known unto you by the way
[43:55] of an uplift hand. Father, Lord Jesus,
[43:58] we know that you're more than able. And
[43:59] father, you've allowed the trials and
[44:01] the situations to come by our way so
[44:04] that your character can be developed in
[44:07] us, Father. And we thank you for that,
[44:09] Lord. Help us, Father, to buy that gold
[44:12] tried in the fire. Oh, Father, that gold
[44:15] that you require of us, Lord Jesus.
[44:18] Tonight, Father, we just want to
[44:19] remember Sister Mary Carpenter, Father,
[44:22] who rolled her ankle at church on
[44:24] Sunday. Father, the devil didn't like
[44:26] them coming and having communion. But
[44:28] Father, we know that you will bless them
[44:30] abundantly, Father, for making the
[44:32] effort to come. Lord Jesus, we thank you
[44:35] for touching her in the name of Jesus.
[44:37] Amen. Now, Father, as we turn to your
[44:39] word, Father, the highest order of this
[44:41] service, we pray that Lord Jesus, you
[44:44] would be reverence now. Father, we greet
[44:46] you with a kiss, Lord. Father, we anoint
[44:49] you with oil, Father. Lord Jesus, we
[44:51] want to wash your feet with our tears.
[44:53] Lord God, we want to acknowledge you,
[44:56] Father, as our Lord and our Savior as we
[44:58] go forwards, Father. So have the
[45:00] preeminence we desire.
[45:03] We just ask all these things in Jesus
[45:05] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank
[45:09] you musicians.
[45:11] Certainly wonderful to be here tonight.
[45:14] Like to welcome my friends, the Hilda
[45:15] Bratz. God bless you. Certainly
[45:18] wonderful to see you. Welcome to all of
[45:20] our visitors tonight. Brother Clawson,
[45:23] Sister Rebecca,
[45:25] my isn't it wonderful to be in his
[45:28] presence?
[45:30] If you have your Bibles tonight, I'd
[45:31] like to read from the book of Joshua.
[45:35] Joshua chapter 1. And then I'd like to
[45:38] turn over to Joshua chapter 10.
[45:42] Joshua chapter 1 and Joshua chapter 10.
[45:51] And I'm sorry, is it Sister Vera
[45:55] and Sister Haley with us tonight as
[45:57] well? God bless you. It's good to see
[46:00] you again.
[46:02] Joshua chapter 1, verse one.
[46:07] Now after the death of Moses, the
[46:09] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[46:12] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[46:15] of Nun, Moses minister, saying, Moses,
[46:20] my servant, is dead. Now therefore
[46:23] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[46:27] this people unto the land which I do
[46:31] give to them, even to the children of
[46:34] Israel.
[46:36] every place that the soul of your foot
[46:38] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[46:42] you, as I said unto Moses,
[46:45] from the wilderness and this Lebanon,
[46:48] even unto the great river, the river
[46:51] Euphrates,
[46:53] all the land of the Hivites, and unto
[46:56] the great sea, going toward sea, toward
[46:59] the going down of the sun, shall be your
[47:01] coast.
[47:03] There shall not any man be able to stand
[47:06] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[47:10] I was with Moses, so I will be with
[47:13] thee.
[47:15] I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
[47:20] Be strong, and of a good courage, for
[47:24] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[47:26] an inheritance
[47:28] the land which I swear unto their
[47:31] fathers to give them.
[47:34] Only be thou strong and very courageous,
[47:38] that thou mightest observe to do
[47:41] according to all the law which Moses my
[47:45] servant commanded thee. Turn not from it
[47:48] to the right hand or to the left, that
[47:51] thou mayest prosper, whethersoever thou
[47:54] goest.
[47:56] This book of the law shall not depart
[47:58] out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
[48:01] meditate therein day and night, that
[48:04] thou mayest observe to do according to
[48:06] all that is written therein, for then
[48:10] thou shalt make thy way prosperous,
[48:13] and then thou shalt have good success.
[48:16] Amen. Have not I commanded thee? Be
[48:20] strong and of a good courage. Be not
[48:23] afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for
[48:26] the Lord thy God is with thee,
[48:29] whethersoever thou goest.
[48:33] Let's just bow one more time and we'll
[48:35] turn over to Joshua chapter 10. Gracious
[48:39] heavenly father, we're so thankful for
[48:40] your word, Lord. We know that it has a a
[48:44] compound meaning and revelation, Lord
[48:46] Jesus. And tonight, Father, I just pray
[48:49] that your word would find the mark in
[48:51] the hearts of your children the way that
[48:53] you have desired. Lord, I know that you
[48:55] led me here. And I I pray that, Father,
[48:57] it would just be that blessing that that
[49:00] we need, Father, to face another day,
[49:02] Lord, to understand that, Lord Jesus,
[49:04] you have an emphasis for us as well,
[49:06] Lord Jesus. We love you and we thank
[49:09] you. We just commit these words into
[49:11] your hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[49:13] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[49:16] you tonight. You may be seated.
[49:20] Welcome once again.
[49:23] Uh I just felt led to get into this.
[49:25] It's out of the message, a paradox. And
[49:29] I kind of chuckled to myself today when
[49:31] uh I was studying it and just the the
[49:35] thought came to me as usual. I've got
[49:37] some quotes that I want to bring. And
[49:38] tonight I'm not going to kill you with
[49:40] quotes. So don't get nervous. We're
[49:43] fortunate that way. But, uh, I do have a
[49:45] couple notable ones that I really want
[49:46] to bring out. And but I was just
[49:48] chuckling to myself thinking about how
[49:50] some people say that, you know, folks
[49:52] that quote the prophet, they parrot the
[49:55] prophet.
[49:57] They parrot the prophet. And, you know,
[49:59] I didn't understand that for the longest
[50:01] time. I I just thought it was the
[50:02] strangest thing that people would say
[50:04] that they parrot the prophet. People
[50:05] parrot the prophet. Alls they do is say
[50:08] what the prophet said. And, you know, to
[50:10] some extent, I guess that's true. And
[50:12] you know, it's even more true when our
[50:14] lives don't actually match what the
[50:17] prophet says. Yes, sir. And that's
[50:19] exactly what that means to parrot the
[50:21] prophet. When people will quote the
[50:24] prophet and quote the prophet and quote
[50:26] the prophet and talk about the prophet
[50:28] and quote the prophet, but yet they
[50:29] don't live the prophet, they're paring
[50:32] the prophet. And it just made me chuckle
[50:35] to think that there's people that
[50:36] actually do live in that realm. They
[50:38] parrot the prophet. and and you know,
[50:40] not in a humorous way, in kind of a sad
[50:42] way because who would want to do that?
[50:46] The only way that we can ever not parrot
[50:49] the prophet is to just simply do what
[50:51] the prophet said and allow Christ
[50:54] himself to make himself personally known
[50:58] to us through the new birth where we
[51:01] truly become converted and then we
[51:03] receive his spirit and our spirit dies.
[51:07] Then when we quote the prophet, we're
[51:08] quoting not the prophet, we're quoting
[51:10] our life. We take this message that was
[51:13] quoted in the 60s and we make it
[51:15] relevant in 2025 because it's not just
[51:18] the scriptures and it's not just the
[51:19] quotes. It's Jesus Christ alive and well
[51:22] in flesh on earth. Yes. Amen. But could
[51:26] you imagine if that's all we did was
[51:27] just parrot the prophet. What a sad
[51:30] place to be.
[51:32] then we can't actually see the the power
[51:34] and and and dominion that God is
[51:38] actually issuing to Joshua in the book
[51:41] of Joshua that we read. How could you be
[51:43] strong and very courageous? And how
[51:46] could you prosper if you're just paring
[51:49] the prophet? If you're not actually
[51:50] doing what the prophet said. Alls we
[51:53] need to do is what he said and we'll see
[51:56] the success in our life. over in the
[51:59] book of Joshua chapter 10. This is, you
[52:02] know, kind of the inspiration that
[52:03] brother Brandham takes out of the
[52:05] paradox in 1965.
[52:08] And I'm sure that uh those who are here
[52:11] um
[52:13] that attend regularly here, you'd
[52:14] understand that I'm probably moved on
[52:16] from uh 64 and now I just it's like
[52:19] usual, you just can't get enough. So,
[52:21] you're on to the next messages and I'm
[52:22] moving into 1965.
[52:24] just going through taking my time and
[52:26] and studying the messages and there's
[52:28] just so much when you hear the summary
[52:31] of all of the message in 1964 1965 it
[52:35] just it's it's such a different uh I
[52:39] think experience myself but in Joshua 10
[52:43] verse 12
[52:46] Joshua 10:12 very familiar scripture
[52:49] once again then spake Joshua to the Lord
[52:52] in the day when the Lord Lord delivered
[52:55] up the Amorites before the children of
[52:57] Israel. And he said in the sight of
[53:00] Israel, son stand thou still upon
[53:04] Gibian. And thou moon in the valley of
[53:06] Agelon. And the sun stood stood still,
[53:09] and the moon stayed until the people had
[53:12] avenged themselves upon their enemies.
[53:15] Is this is not this written in the book
[53:17] of Jash? Jasher? So the sun stood stood
[53:21] still in the midst of heaven and hasted
[53:24] not to go down about a whole day. And
[53:28] there was no day like that before it or
[53:32] after it that the Lord hearkened unto
[53:36] the voice of a man.
[53:39] For the Lord fought for Israel.
[53:42] And I just can't help but think that
[53:45] this is not exclusive to Joshua.
[53:48] This is not exclusive to Israel. And you
[53:52] know in the day in which we live, we
[53:54] know that Paul said that eye hath not
[53:56] seen nor hath ear heard, neither has it
[53:59] even entered into the heart of a man.
[54:01] Amen. What God has prepared for those
[54:03] who love him, those people that go over
[54:07] into that other dimension. But you know,
[54:10] it's interesting because the day in
[54:12] which we live, we had a prophet that
[54:14] actually did go over. He did go beyond
[54:17] the curtain of time and he said there's
[54:19] no human word that you could actually
[54:22] use to describe it. He said sublime. It
[54:25] doesn't even touch it. He said there's
[54:27] no way that you could explain it. How it
[54:29] could possibly be that everyone is about
[54:32] 20 years of age and everyone has love
[54:34] one for another. Everyone has a love
[54:37] different from human love. And we know
[54:39] that brother Brandham said if you don't
[54:42] get anything else get that love.
[54:45] get that love because the only thing
[54:46] that there is over there is that love.
[54:49] What a tremendous thing that is. But to
[54:52] look at it, the day in which we live, we
[54:54] had a prophet who would quote what Paul
[54:57] said. Eye hath not seen, ear hath not
[54:59] heard, neither has it even entered in
[55:00] the heart of a man. But yet this man, he
[55:02] went and actually did come back with
[55:04] some ideas and some words about what
[55:07] it's going to be like on the other side.
[55:09] What a tremendous thing. And you know,
[55:11] maybe maybe it's it's about the new
[55:13] heaven and the new earth. We don't know
[55:15] that. But I just can't help but think
[55:18] something significant happened in the
[55:19] day in which this prophet walked the
[55:21] earth. The Elijah ministry in the day in
[55:24] which we live in this generation, the
[55:26] seventh angel messenger. This guy, some
[55:29] people think you just worship a man. We
[55:31] don't worship a man. We worship God. We
[55:34] do what that prophet said. We don't just
[55:36] parrot him and say what the prophet
[55:38] said. We actually do what the prophet
[55:40] said. And you know what? Sometimes we
[55:42] might actually misquote that prophet.
[55:44] But that's irrelevant because what we do
[55:46] do is serve God. We worship Jesus
[55:49] Christ. That's what he said. Follow
[55:52] Jesus. If you can't take my word for it,
[55:53] take his word for it.
[55:57] Talking about this story in the book of
[55:58] Joshua. I think it's amazing. Verse 14.
[56:01] And there was no day like that day like
[56:04] like that before it or after it that the
[56:07] Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man.
[56:10] For the Lord fought for Israel. Now, I'm
[56:12] not going to read it tonight just for
[56:14] time's sake. And to be honest with you,
[56:16] I didn't actually get a chance to bring
[56:18] it up. Otherwise, it might have been
[56:20] just a whole bunch of quotes, but I just
[56:22] want to throw it out there. It might be
[56:23] worth taking a look at it. Look at the
[56:26] two times that brother Brandham
[56:28] interacted with squirrels. Yes, sir.
[56:30] What happened in those stories? We know
[56:33] what happened in those stories. He got
[56:36] an inspiration
[56:38] and through that inspiration
[56:40] he spoke.
[56:42] God never spoke. He spoke. And then he
[56:46] started to doubt what he spoke. Right?
[56:50] And then what happened? God said to him,
[56:52] "Did you not speak? Did you not say
[56:55] this?
[56:57] You said this." Isn't it interesting?
[57:01] A very similar parallel, but you have to
[57:04] believe that God sent a prophet first
[57:05] before that makes any sense. Otherwise,
[57:07] it's just someone making something up.
[57:09] But, you know, he is the same yesterday,
[57:11] today, and forever. That's right. And
[57:13] who knows how many thousands of years
[57:15] ago this was
[57:17] and how many maybe decades ago it was
[57:21] that God spoke through a man here on
[57:23] earth. Once again, it's just tremendous
[57:26] to think about. There was no day like
[57:28] that before it or after it that the Lord
[57:30] hearkened unto the voice of a man. For
[57:32] the Lord fought for Israel.
[57:35] Now I'm taking this from the message the
[57:37] paradox. It's in 1965. It's uh the
[57:41] second message actually. The first
[57:43] message in 1965 is a wedding ceremony.
[57:47] It's pretty interesting to hear how
[57:48] brother Brandham does that. But the
[57:50] paradox is a is a real interesting
[57:52] message, you know, and brother Brown, I
[57:54] mean, he doesn't make it too heavy for
[57:56] the most part. It's not really rich in
[57:58] doctrine and and and really deep
[58:01] mysterious things and revelations, but
[58:03] yet it does actually state something
[58:06] really amazing. And I think that's
[58:07] really what I want to get into tonight.
[58:09] And that's talking about a paradox. And
[58:11] he says, according to Webster, it's
[58:13] something incredible but true.
[58:17] It's something absolutely incredible but
[58:20] true. Now, I'm going to jump to the
[58:21] punch line like I always do. And I want
[58:23] to say this tonight, brothers and
[58:24] sisters. If you have the ability to
[58:25] believe this word, you're the paradox.
[58:28] Summarize that whole entire message. If
[58:30] you've got ears to hear what the prophet
[58:32] said to this age, that's the spirit of
[58:34] God speaking to this age. Because the
[58:36] word only comes to a prophet. When it
[58:38] comes to the prophet, if you can hear
[58:39] what that prophet said and say amen to
[58:42] it and begin to change your life to
[58:44] pattern after that prophet, you're the
[58:47] paradox.
[58:49] Because who can actually hear what the
[58:51] spirit saith unto the church? But those
[58:54] whom he called
[58:57] before the foundation of the world. But
[59:00] it is something that's incredible, but
[59:01] it's true.
[59:03] My and you know, brother Random, he says
[59:06] it in here. It's actually
[59:08] stranger than fiction. Many times it's
[59:11] stranger than fiction because we can
[59:14] have I'll say it this way. We can be one
[59:16] of those people in this world that have
[59:17] all the money in the world. All the
[59:20] money in the We can have so much money
[59:21] we just don't even know what to do with
[59:23] it. So much money that we don't even
[59:25] count it anymore. We just weigh it
[59:27] because we have so much money. Stacks
[59:29] and stacks and stacks of Benjamin
[59:31] Franklin's. We just weigh it. Put it on
[59:33] the scale. How much is there? We don't
[59:35] know. We don't count it. We don't have
[59:37] to. We could have all that much money,
[59:39] but we won't be happy.
[59:42] In fact, what will happen is we'll
[59:43] gradually become more and more miserable
[59:46] because it will consume us. The more we
[59:49] get, the more we want. And it can become
[59:51] that way with anything in our life if
[59:53] we're not careful. If we don't have the
[59:55] spirit of God living through us and
[59:57] governing us, whatever it is, can seem
[1:00:00] like a tremendous blessing, but it
[1:00:01] becomes a curse very quickly if his
[1:00:04] spirit isn't leading us and guiding us.
[1:00:07] But I think it's amazing because this
[1:00:08] this ability that's a paradox to believe
[1:00:11] the word for our day. It's incredible
[1:00:14] and it's true,
[1:00:19] but it is very strange.
[1:00:22] You know, brother Bam, he talks about it
[1:00:24] in this message. How Moses in the day in
[1:00:26] which Moses lived, he represented the
[1:00:29] law,
[1:00:31] but Joshua
[1:00:33] was representing something else. Joshua
[1:00:36] was representing grace.
[1:00:39] For the people to go and live in a land
[1:00:41] that's full of safety, it was actually a
[1:00:44] period of grace that they were stepping
[1:00:47] into. And isn't it amazing how those
[1:00:50] people could not accept the word of the
[1:00:54] prophet.
[1:00:55] They resented him. They mocked him. And
[1:00:59] I can't help but think they parided him.
[1:01:03] But Moses, brother Bradam says,
[1:01:04] represented the law which brought them
[1:01:07] out of Egypt. But Joshua, he represented
[1:01:10] grace.
[1:01:12] He represented unmmerited favor. That's
[1:01:16] what grace is. It's something that we
[1:01:18] don't deserve. That wedding band of
[1:01:20] unmmerited grace that he gave to us. He
[1:01:22] said, "I I love you and I I want to take
[1:01:25] you as my bride. Would you marry me?"
[1:01:27] That's the call of the age. That's the
[1:01:29] age in which we live in. He's inviting
[1:01:32] us to the wedding. And the wedding is
[1:01:34] here and now. The wedding isn't going to
[1:01:36] be some other day, some other place.
[1:01:38] We're going on to the wedding supper.
[1:01:40] That marriage had better have taken
[1:01:41] place already.
[1:01:44] But Moses, he represented the law. And
[1:01:46] you know, as I was studying this, I was
[1:01:48] just thinking how some people, they just
[1:01:49] want to live under the law and they want
[1:01:51] to scrutinize everything to the letter
[1:01:53] of the law. And and most of all, they
[1:01:55] want to scrutinize everyone else to the
[1:01:58] letter of the law. And you know what
[1:02:01] happens when you do that? You push
[1:02:03] people away. And and if we're not
[1:02:05] careful, we can push people away from
[1:02:07] the kingdom. Now, some people might say,
[1:02:09] "Brother Barry, I can do it all I want
[1:02:12] because I know that whoever he's called,
[1:02:14] he's he's fornown. And whoever he's
[1:02:16] fornown them, he's already justified.
[1:02:19] And those who he's justified, he's
[1:02:20] already glorified. If you're truly
[1:02:22] elected, you could never be pushed
[1:02:24] away."
[1:02:26] Is that true? I think so. But we might
[1:02:30] actually cause a little bit of
[1:02:31] disturbance if we're not careful. If
[1:02:34] we're simply paring the prophet and
[1:02:36] other people see us living a different
[1:02:37] life, double lives will always come out.
[1:02:41] The word says that be sure your sins
[1:02:43] find you out. And I say, Lord, I'm not
[1:02:46] perfect.
[1:02:47] But I don't want to live a double life.
[1:02:50] I don't want to be a a double agent. I
[1:02:52] don't want to be playing one side of the
[1:02:54] fence for God and and the other side of
[1:02:56] the fence for the devil. I just want to
[1:02:58] be on the right side of the river. And
[1:03:00] you know the children of Israel, if they
[1:03:02] chose to stay on the other side of
[1:03:04] Jordan, they did not get the benefit of
[1:03:07] living in the promised land.
[1:03:10] They had to go over. Even those that
[1:03:13] said, "We want to stay here. It's so
[1:03:15] lovely here. We've got room for our
[1:03:18] cattle. The grass is so green on this
[1:03:20] side of Jordan. We just love it here."
[1:03:22] The commandment was, "All right, if
[1:03:24] that's what you want, you can have it.
[1:03:26] But you still have to go and fight for
[1:03:28] your brothers and your sisters. You
[1:03:29] still have to go to church and worship
[1:03:31] with them on Sunday. Until they get
[1:03:34] positionally placed in the Holy Ghost,
[1:03:37] you're still on the hook.
[1:03:40] It's interesting to look at it that way,
[1:03:42] but it's true. Yes, sir. Joshua
[1:03:44] represented grace and that took them
[1:03:47] into the promised land. Brother Brandham
[1:03:50] says another way was that the law and
[1:03:51] grace were two different aspects of
[1:03:53] God's command. Don't worry about the
[1:03:55] quotes. I I've only got two that I
[1:03:57] really want to bring up, so don't worry
[1:03:59] about that, brother. I'm just going to
[1:04:00] skip over a few here. He said there were
[1:04:03] two different aspects of God's command.
[1:04:05] Now, the law brought them out.
[1:04:08] Moses
[1:04:10] and Joshua took them in.
[1:04:13] And I just can't help but think,
[1:04:14] brothers and sisters, it's good to talk
[1:04:16] about it. There is a coming out of, but
[1:04:19] that ain't enough.
[1:04:21] You have to go in.
[1:04:24] You have to go in. Amen. Brother
[1:04:26] Brandham says that if we don't go in,
[1:04:28] then we're lost as lost can be. What
[1:04:29] does it mean to go in? It doesn't mean
[1:04:30] to go into church. It doesn't mean to go
[1:04:33] into camp meetings. It doesn't mean to
[1:04:36] be good people. What it means is to go
[1:04:38] into Christ. To get all the way into the
[1:04:41] baptism of
[1:04:44] Holy Ghost. Outside of that, we're lost
[1:04:47] as lost can be.
[1:04:50] But we don't live under the law. We live
[1:04:52] under grace. It's such an amazing thing.
[1:04:54] Amen. The RAM says it's a law that
[1:04:57] brings us to recognize that we're wrong.
[1:05:00] We need the law, but we don't stay
[1:05:03] there, do we? We don't stay there
[1:05:06] because
[1:05:08] the letter kleth,
[1:05:10] but the spirit, the spirit is what
[1:05:12] giveth life. It's the law that brings us
[1:05:15] to recognize that we're wrong, but it's
[1:05:18] grace that forgives us.
[1:05:21] And we know full well that the proverbs
[1:05:25] says a soft word does what? It turns
[1:05:30] away wrath.
[1:05:32] Instead of trying to be right, I'm
[1:05:35] right. I'm right. You're wrong. My
[1:05:37] position. Instead of that, just to
[1:05:41] simply have grace and say, you know
[1:05:43] what, Lord, be it unto me according to
[1:05:44] your will. Pray for my brother. Pray for
[1:05:47] my sister. Pray for my husband. Pray for
[1:05:49] my wife. pray for my children. You know,
[1:05:51] one of the worst things that we can do
[1:05:53] is try and just hammer our kids with the
[1:05:55] law.
[1:05:56] We need to give them grace. We need to
[1:05:59] shower them with grace. We need to let
[1:06:01] them know that God is in control. Hold
[1:06:04] this word before them continually, not
[1:06:07] be pushovers and say, "Oh, that's okay
[1:06:09] if you want to just go." And Brother
[1:06:10] Brandham says it very clearly about the
[1:06:12] daughter that wants to go and run around
[1:06:13] all night. He
[1:06:16] he he says what should happen there. But
[1:06:19] a child that wants to go and run out
[1:06:20] into the street, what are we going to
[1:06:22] do? Say, "Oh dear, don't worry about
[1:06:24] that. Just just go slow. Make sure you
[1:06:27] look both ways." When we have a little
[1:06:28] child like that, we're going to run
[1:06:29] after them. We're going to grab them and
[1:06:31] we're going to learn them. We're going
[1:06:33] to teach them. Don't do that. Why?
[1:06:36] Because it will hurt them. That's right.
[1:06:40] We're not interested in abuse. We're not
[1:06:41] trying to promote that. But what we're
[1:06:44] doing is saying we love our children.
[1:06:47] And any parent that won't actually
[1:06:49] chastise their children, are they
[1:06:51] actually the parent? We know that if
[1:06:54] we're not willing to accept chastisement
[1:06:56] by the word,
[1:06:58] then he who's our father then.
[1:07:02] But it's the law that brings us to
[1:07:03] recognize that we're wrong. And and
[1:07:05] that's what happens. We we recognize the
[1:07:07] law. The word says that we're sinners.
[1:07:09] We're born in sin. We're shaped in
[1:07:11] iniquity. We come into this world
[1:07:12] speaking lies. There's nothing in us
[1:07:14] that's good. We're humans outside of the
[1:07:18] Holy Ghost inside of us. We're a brute
[1:07:20] beast. You don't have to look around
[1:07:22] very far now and you can see a lot of
[1:07:24] brute beasts in this world. And you
[1:07:26] know, we're not exclusive
[1:07:28] except for we've got the Holy Ghost in
[1:07:30] our life. That's the only difference.
[1:07:33] That's the only difference.
[1:07:36] Brother Brandham talks about them here
[1:07:38] in the in the message. She says that,
[1:07:40] you know, if you notice that the
[1:07:42] journey, they had three stages in their
[1:07:44] journey. And we know that that's kind of
[1:07:47] the same way it is for the believer. And
[1:07:49] and and you know, to I guess maybe
[1:07:52] preface this or or parallel it. Brother
[1:07:54] Random talks about Ephesus in this
[1:07:56] message. He doesn't I don't think say
[1:07:58] that that the book of Ephesians
[1:08:01] perfectly parallels the book of Joshua.
[1:08:03] It's not in this message, but it is in
[1:08:05] the message. Brother Brandham says that.
[1:08:08] And you might say that the book of
[1:08:10] Joshua perfectly parallels the book of
[1:08:11] Ephesians. I might have got them
[1:08:12] backwards, but you get what I'm saying.
[1:08:15] But he says that they had three stages
[1:08:17] of their journey. The first was
[1:08:19] preparation by faith down in Egypt.
[1:08:22] There was the oral tradition. You know,
[1:08:23] God's going to send a deliverer
[1:08:25] somewhere somehow someway. There's
[1:08:27] supposed to be a deliverer from this
[1:08:29] hard bondage. And and we know that there
[1:08:32] was some people that really were excited
[1:08:34] about that. And other people probably
[1:08:37] just scorned at it and said, you know,
[1:08:39] whatever. It's probably never going to
[1:08:41] happen. But the ones that did actually
[1:08:44] get excited about it, what happened?
[1:08:45] They started to cry out. Why? Because
[1:08:47] they had just a little bit of faith in
[1:08:49] them. Something inside of them cried
[1:08:51] out. Brother Bradom says that it was the
[1:08:53] preparation by faith down in Egypt under
[1:08:55] the sacrificial lamb. And he says, "Then
[1:08:58] they crossed the Red Sea into the
[1:09:00] wilderness. A separation
[1:09:03] crossed the Red Sea." And you know, he
[1:09:05] says later on in the message here that
[1:09:07] they had a baptism.
[1:09:10] They got saved first, then they got
[1:09:12] baptized, but they still had to cross
[1:09:14] over. The third step was they needed to
[1:09:17] cross over that Jordan. They needed to
[1:09:19] cross over into a new land. They needed
[1:09:22] to go into a place where it was
[1:09:24] absolutely frightening to look at from
[1:09:26] the human perspective to think that they
[1:09:28] could stand against any one of those
[1:09:30] giants. We know that 10, I always talk
[1:09:32] about it. those 10, they came back and
[1:09:34] said, "Sure enough, we've got the figs,
[1:09:36] we've got the pomegranates, we've got
[1:09:38] the milk, we've got the honey, all the
[1:09:40] stuff that was spoken of, it's there.
[1:09:42] Here's the proof of it. The grapes that
[1:09:45] it took two grown men to carry, they're
[1:09:47] all here. Let's eat of it. Enjoy it.
[1:09:49] It's wonderful. But we can't do it.
[1:09:54] We've come all this way out of the hard
[1:09:56] bondage. all this way. Signed, all the
[1:09:59] plagues in Egypt, the Red Sea, the
[1:10:04] baptism now crossing over. They're right
[1:10:07] there to cross over. I can only think,
[1:10:10] brothers and sisters, as a believer, we
[1:10:12] know what we're talking about tonight.
[1:10:13] If we don't, I just want to make it
[1:10:15] plain and simple. the crossing over of
[1:10:17] Jordan is us dying out to ourselves and
[1:10:20] leaving the wilderness behind us of our
[1:10:23] old selves and crossing into a new land
[1:10:26] to say that I'm going to live my life
[1:10:28] for Christ. Whether it takes the hide
[1:10:30] off of me, whether I have to lose all of
[1:10:32] my friends, whether I've got to go get a
[1:10:34] new job, whether I've got to move to a
[1:10:36] new location, it doesn't matter because
[1:10:38] I believe that he lives and he is the
[1:10:41] only one that I want to serve in this
[1:10:43] life. And because of that, I'm willing
[1:10:45] to change absolutely anything that he
[1:10:49] wants. That is the life of a believer
[1:10:52] until we come to that place in our life.
[1:10:54] I wonder, have we truly crossed over
[1:10:56] into that promised land?
[1:10:59] Are we willing to throw away everything
[1:11:01] that we know for this gospel?
[1:11:06] Not saying we should, but I'm saying,
[1:11:09] have we crossed over?
[1:11:11] We say it all the time. Brother Brandham
[1:11:13] said it, you know, how can a woman
[1:11:14] forget that she had a baby? How can it
[1:11:17] happen?
[1:11:20] I don't know. I'll ask the question
[1:11:22] tonight. Maybe I did on Sunday, but I
[1:11:24] think it's so stimulating to think
[1:11:25] about. Is there any moms in the room
[1:11:27] here that could ever forget their baby?
[1:11:31] If you could raise your hand.
[1:11:34] I know there's not that many moms in the
[1:11:36] room, but there's a few. And I don't see
[1:11:39] any hands going up. How could you
[1:11:41] forget?
[1:11:43] Like we talked about on Sunday, there's
[1:11:45] so many details. Even as a dad, I
[1:11:47] remember very clearly when we went in,
[1:11:49] we had an appointment to be induced for
[1:11:52] Christopher. It was a little bit of a
[1:11:53] different thing, but it was chip night
[1:11:55] at the hospital. And I remember it
[1:11:58] vividly because I'm a chip guy. And I
[1:12:00] thought, "This is just perfect. Welcome,
[1:12:02] Christopher.
[1:12:04] Glad to be here with you." But you don't
[1:12:06] forget.
[1:12:08] And when you cross over Jordan, you
[1:12:09] don't forget. When you know who you used
[1:12:13] to be, you don't forget.
[1:12:16] God takes you and allows you to be
[1:12:19] brainwashed. Some people will say,
[1:12:21] "You're brainwashed by that prophet."
[1:12:23] Amen. I'm so glad that I'm brainwashed.
[1:12:25] Brothers and sisters, if you've ever had
[1:12:27] to deal with the poison that's in this
[1:12:29] world and to be able to become
[1:12:31] brainwashed by this gospel, you can only
[1:12:34] praise. That's right. Right. But I think
[1:12:37] that some people haven't allowed this
[1:12:39] word to maybe just wash them all the
[1:12:41] way. Just maybe not completely
[1:12:43] brainwashed. And that's where we're
[1:12:44] going with this. Brother Brandham talks
[1:12:45] about it. You know what? If we have one
[1:12:46] speck of the old man still alive in us,
[1:12:48] then we ground the power of the spirit
[1:12:50] of God. We have not fully crossed over
[1:12:53] the Jordan River because there's still
[1:12:55] some of the old guy kicking and
[1:12:57] screaming.
[1:13:00] But these people back in the day of
[1:13:02] Joshua, they had three stages of their
[1:13:05] journey. First was a preparation of
[1:13:06] faith down in Egypt under the
[1:13:08] sacrificial lamb. Then they crossed the
[1:13:10] Red Sea into the wilderness which was a
[1:13:12] separation. A and we need that
[1:13:14] separation. Sometimes we need that
[1:13:16] separation more than we realize. We need
[1:13:19] to separate ourselves from all of the
[1:13:21] things which bind us in this world. We
[1:13:25] need to separate ourselves from
[1:13:26] ourselves which can be the most
[1:13:28] difficult thing to do. And and I would
[1:13:30] say this just by experience, one of the
[1:13:32] things that can help us do that is to
[1:13:34] actually turn off our phone and actually
[1:13:36] just have a day or two with no phone, no
[1:13:39] contact to anyone else and just set our
[1:13:41] sights on the Lord and just ask him what
[1:13:44] he wants from us in our lives. And if we
[1:13:46] don't know that we've got that Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost in our lives, if we don't know
[1:13:50] that we've actually fully crossed over
[1:13:51] Jordan, we don't know if there's still a
[1:13:54] portion of that old man alive in us. You
[1:13:55] know why I'm saying this, brothers and
[1:13:56] sisters? Because we have blind spots.
[1:13:58] Human beings have blind spots. I know
[1:14:00] I've got blind spots. I've got big ones.
[1:14:02] But we all have blind spots. And some
[1:14:03] people have bigger blind spots than
[1:14:05] other people. And you know, we think
[1:14:07] that we're all doing great. Everything
[1:14:09] is fine in our life. But have we taken
[1:14:11] the time to just spend time alone with
[1:14:13] God and ask him, "Is everything okay in
[1:14:16] my life?"
[1:14:17] And give him the chance to answer
[1:14:20] or do we just carry on? Everything is
[1:14:22] fine. God's blessing us. We've got a
[1:14:24] great job. We've got a great career. Our
[1:14:27] bank account's full. Our portfolio is
[1:14:29] awesome. Everything is good. Is it?
[1:14:33] I guess I'm saying this because you know
[1:14:34] what, brothers and sisters? I I'm a part
[1:14:37] of a few different chats like some
[1:14:39] ministers are. And uh you know, I'm
[1:14:41] saying to people now, they're saying,
[1:14:43] "Hey, brother from Uganda. Hey, brother.
[1:14:45] Brother Herbert Makoba. Brother uh
[1:14:49] you know, a few of the brothers anyways.
[1:14:50] And uh how you doing, brother? You know,
[1:14:51] we're good. We're good. We're good over
[1:14:53] here. How about you? Are you ready for
[1:14:55] the rapture?"
[1:14:57] because that's the season we're living
[1:14:58] in. This isn't the season to come and
[1:15:01] play church. It's not the season to
[1:15:03] parrot the prophet. This is the season
[1:15:05] to get all the way over the Jordan
[1:15:07] River. Get into the Holy Ghost for
[1:15:10] yourself.
[1:15:11] That's the season we're living in.
[1:15:13] Brothers and sisters, I can only imagine
[1:15:15] that Noah would have been preaching
[1:15:17] quite similar to this. Get in the boat,
[1:15:19] man. It's going to rain. The boat's
[1:15:22] finished. Can't you see all the animals?
[1:15:24] They have come. That supernatural sign
[1:15:27] and wonder doesn't get any stronger than
[1:15:29] that. Get in the boat. Amen.
[1:15:34] But sometimes people can just be
[1:15:35] comfortable in a church experience.
[1:15:36] Brothers and sisters, don't do it. Don't
[1:15:39] do it. Don't get comfortable in a church
[1:15:40] experience. Get comfortable in Christ.
[1:15:47] Talks about the three stages. He says
[1:15:49] because under the preparation when they
[1:15:51] all got ready then they when they came
[1:15:54] to the Red Sea there was a a failure
[1:15:56] again.
[1:15:58] The people did not believe
[1:16:01] after seeing many things that God had
[1:16:03] did. They still did not believe.
[1:16:06] And God opened up the Red Sea and took
[1:16:09] them forth which were taught that all
[1:16:11] the people were baptized unto Moses
[1:16:14] under the cloud and the sea. And we know
[1:16:18] that it went from there after they were
[1:16:19] in the promised land for a little while
[1:16:21] that they got baptized under John. John
[1:16:24] the Baptist. He was baptizing unto
[1:16:27] repentance.
[1:16:29] He said, "Get baptized." And all he
[1:16:31] wanted to do was get baptized. And he
[1:16:32] was capturing the attention of the
[1:16:34] people because he was declaring
[1:16:36] something. It wasn't just baptism. He
[1:16:39] was actually declaring the coming of the
[1:16:42] Lord. Yes. And so maybe I sound a little
[1:16:45] bit fanatical and crazy tonight. I hope
[1:16:47] so. But you know, we had a prophet in
[1:16:49] our day that said he was here and he was
[1:16:52] told that he was declaring the second
[1:16:55] coming of the Lord.
[1:16:59] So if he was here to forerun the second
[1:17:02] coming of the Lord and now he's gone,
[1:17:06] where are we?
[1:17:08] Oh my. Where do we stand? But under
[1:17:11] Moses, they were baptized under the
[1:17:13] cloud and the sea. And today, I just
[1:17:15] can't help but think, brothers and
[1:17:16] sisters, we've been baptized under the
[1:17:18] cloud and the pillar of fire. Oh my, it
[1:17:23] ain't going to rain again on this earth.
[1:17:25] It's not going to rain water. We talk
[1:17:27] about climate change. It's going to
[1:17:29] change. All right.
[1:17:32] But isn't it wonderful? Now, we're
[1:17:34] talking about peace all over the place.
[1:17:36] It's beautiful. Peace. Peace.
[1:17:39] We know what the word says. When they
[1:17:41] start talking peace, look out. That's
[1:17:43] why, brothers and sisters, I just can't
[1:17:45] help but think, what day do we live in?
[1:17:49] You talk to some of the old-timers, I've
[1:17:52] only been around since 2005 in the
[1:17:54] message. But those old-timers, the
[1:17:57] elders that have been around for years
[1:17:58] and years since Brother Brandham was
[1:18:00] around, e even after brother Brandham
[1:18:02] was around in the 70s and the 80s, you
[1:18:05] you talk to those brothers and sisters
[1:18:07] and and they would say it even now. They
[1:18:09] did not think that we would make it even
[1:18:11] to 1990
[1:18:13] and then the year 2000, Y2K
[1:18:16] and here we are 25 years later.
[1:18:20] Why? And back in the 60s, this prophet
[1:18:23] was saying, "It's later than you think."
[1:18:26] Yes, sir. And I personally believe it.
[1:18:28] My view is he said that because he did
[1:18:31] actually herald the second coming of the
[1:18:34] Lord. Amen. Sunset Mountain wasn't just
[1:18:36] a cloud. It wasn't just a mystery cloud
[1:18:39] above the cl above the mountains. It was
[1:18:41] way more than that. It It was lit. We
[1:18:43] read it on Sunday. He said it. Turn it
[1:18:47] right. Look at it right. Turn it 90
[1:18:50] degrees, however you want to say it,
[1:18:52] because you can see a face there, the
[1:18:54] white-wiged one, the alpha, the omega,
[1:18:57] Jesus Christ, the author and the
[1:18:59] finisher of our faith.
[1:19:03] And you know, when that which is per
[1:19:05] which is perfect is come, that which is
[1:19:07] in part will be done away. So, it's time
[1:19:10] to not be parenting the prophet. It's
[1:19:12] time to actually be living what that
[1:19:14] prophet said. But brother Brandham in
[1:19:16] this message he says there's some people
[1:19:18] today of today that do not believe in
[1:19:20] miracles
[1:19:22] they say they just can't believe that
[1:19:24] there is such a thing as miracles in
[1:19:26] this modern age.
[1:19:29] Well, I don't mean to say anything bad
[1:19:31] about that person. But here's the thing,
[1:19:34] brothers and sisters. They're
[1:19:36] spiritually numb.
[1:19:38] That's the problem. They become
[1:19:41] spiritually numb somewhere along the
[1:19:42] way. And it got me thinking sometimes in
[1:19:45] our life if we have a prayer and we pray
[1:19:48] the prayer a and it's an urgent prayer
[1:19:51] and God doesn't answer that prayer the
[1:19:54] way we want.
[1:19:56] Does it actually cause us to become a
[1:19:58] little spiritually numb?
[1:20:01] Can it? I can tell you by experience it
[1:20:04] does that it can it can cause us to
[1:20:07] become spiritually numb to think the
[1:20:10] devil is just right there on your
[1:20:11] shoulder to say, "You know what? Yeah,
[1:20:13] that prophet was around and when he was
[1:20:14] here, he had a tremendous ministry. And
[1:20:16] there's other ministers out there in
[1:20:17] this world that have tremendous
[1:20:18] ministries. And you know, if if you're
[1:20:20] not around them, you're probably not
[1:20:22] going to see a miracle. And we know that
[1:20:24] there have been teachers in this world
[1:20:25] that have said, "There's only that many
[1:20:28] ministers in the world that have a a
[1:20:29] ministry."
[1:20:31] That's not the day in which we live. No,
[1:20:33] sir. He is Hebrews 13:8. Amen. Jesus
[1:20:37] Christ, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:41] forever.
[1:20:43] He is. Yes. He goes on to say they're
[1:20:46] they're spiritually blind.
[1:20:49] They have no spiritual sight or
[1:20:52] spiritual feelings at all.
[1:20:56] Now, maybe this is just me.
[1:20:58] Maybe it is me. And and you know,
[1:21:00] brothers and sisters, I don't want to
[1:21:01] sound arrogant by saying this. And I'm
[1:21:05] not saying that maybe it's just me. I've
[1:21:06] got a view. I'm saying maybe it's just
[1:21:07] me. Maybe this whole thing is just about
[1:21:09] me. You could talk to my wife. We went
[1:21:11] through a phase about a decade in our
[1:21:13] life where we were spiritually numb
[1:21:15] where I felt like I actually began to
[1:21:18] lose all my spiritual feelings. I I
[1:21:20] began to question my own experience. Why
[1:21:22] would I come to church and I'll tell you
[1:21:25] straight up why I'm going this way with
[1:21:27] it? Because we had a baby boy or at
[1:21:29] least we're supposed to. And you know,
[1:21:31] we only were able to deliver him early
[1:21:34] and and what happened was he he was
[1:21:36] perfectly healthy and alive. We just
[1:21:37] couldn't see him live in in the
[1:21:39] environment that he was in, mama. And so
[1:21:41] she delivered him early and he died. And
[1:21:44] you can bet that we were praying.
[1:21:48] You can bet that we believed that God
[1:21:50] had miracle in store for us just around
[1:21:52] the corner. There was weeks and weeks
[1:21:54] and weeks of a roller coaster up and
[1:21:56] down, up and down. Maybe it's going to
[1:21:58] happen. Maybe it's going to be good.
[1:21:59] Maybe it's not. Oh, we don't know what
[1:22:00] to do. And in the end, we got to bury
[1:22:03] him and trust that we'll see him one day
[1:22:06] about 19 years old. His name is Timothy.
[1:22:10] Timothy Johnson. We're going to see that
[1:22:12] boy.
[1:22:15] But, you know,
[1:22:17] I won't speak for my wife because I
[1:22:19] don't want to put her on the spot
[1:22:20] anymore than I already have. But I can
[1:22:22] say this. I became just a little bit
[1:22:25] spiritually blinded. I started to wonder
[1:22:28] what was going on. and and you know,
[1:22:31] other things came up around the same
[1:22:33] time. And I'll tell you what, the devil
[1:22:35] was right there in my ear saying, "This
[1:22:38] is what you're doing with your life. You
[1:22:41] threw away everything that you knew in
[1:22:42] the past. And now you're a fanatic
[1:22:45] following a man. This is the God you
[1:22:48] serve after all you've done." I can kind
[1:22:51] of relate a little bit to what Brother
[1:22:52] Brandham said, not a lot, but a little
[1:22:54] bit when he was dealing with Sharon Rose
[1:22:56] and his wife.
[1:22:59] When the chips are down, brothers and
[1:23:00] sisters, what happens? That's really why
[1:23:04] we need to know we where we stand.
[1:23:06] What's our why? What are we doing with
[1:23:08] it in our life? If we can go to that
[1:23:11] place, I believe we will know. There
[1:23:13] won't be any shaking us. But sometimes
[1:23:16] God will allow I know by experience this
[1:23:19] the experience that I'm talking about.
[1:23:20] God will allow everything that can be
[1:23:22] shaken in our lives will be shaken in
[1:23:24] our lives. And that will be so that we
[1:23:26] recognize that he is God and he is our
[1:23:30] God. And everything that happens is
[1:23:32] perfectly according to his will and good
[1:23:35] purpose. Everything.
[1:23:38] It doesn't make it easier. I'm not
[1:23:40] saying it makes it easy. I'm saying that
[1:23:43] he has it all under control and we come
[1:23:45] to that place when we get to our our
[1:23:47] lowest lowest place. He allows us to do
[1:23:50] that sometimes. Brother Bradom said it.
[1:23:52] He'll allow us to get flat on our back.
[1:23:54] Why is that? Just so that we can look
[1:23:56] up. Just so that we can look up. He said
[1:23:59] they're they're spiritually blind. They
[1:24:01] have no spiritual sight or spiritual
[1:24:03] feelings at all. Cuz no man can sit in a
[1:24:06] crowd of people wherein the Holy Spirit
[1:24:09] is falling. No matter if he is
[1:24:11] absolutely a sinner or she, but what
[1:24:15] they're bound to sense the presence of
[1:24:17] God.
[1:24:20] Now, brothers and sisters, I want to say
[1:24:22] this.
[1:24:24] Sometimes people will read this and say,
[1:24:25] 'Well, I mean, in brother Brandham's
[1:24:27] meetings, they had the prayer line. And
[1:24:28] in this message, he did. 1965 second
[1:24:31] message, he had a prayer line and he cut
[1:24:34] the message short, I think, so that he
[1:24:35] could do the prayer line. And you can
[1:24:37] hear it, you can read it, you can see
[1:24:39] all the different cases that came
[1:24:40] through and how the people were healed
[1:24:41] and stuff. Don't look to that. I mean,
[1:24:44] that's wonderful to see God discerning
[1:24:47] the people, but we know that Brother
[1:24:48] Bosworth, I think, is the one that said
[1:24:50] it to him. That's the bait on the hook,
[1:24:52] isn't it? It's so that you could capture
[1:24:55] the attention of the people. And if you
[1:24:57] know the vision that Brother Brandham
[1:24:59] had, or maybe it was a dream where he
[1:25:01] was fishing and what he was doing was
[1:25:02] fishing and there was fish, there was
[1:25:04] little fish and he would try and reel it
[1:25:06] in and then he explained to the other
[1:25:07] ministers what was going on and how his
[1:25:09] line got all tangled up and the angel of
[1:25:11] the Lord told you, "I I told you not to
[1:25:13] do that." and how he couldn't actually
[1:25:16] get any further and he was it goes into
[1:25:18] a shoelace and the eyelid and all all
[1:25:20] that. But what he talked about was how
[1:25:22] the little fish were swimming around
[1:25:24] after the lure. And what happens is when
[1:25:26] the little fish get excited, so do the
[1:25:28] big fish. The big fish see the little
[1:25:30] fish. And I just can't help but think
[1:25:33] that's exactly where we are today. It's
[1:25:35] it's capturing the attention of the big
[1:25:38] fish. And I've heard people call it the
[1:25:40] uh covenant fish, right? the rainbow
[1:25:43] trout, those fish from the final age.
[1:25:48] Brother Badam, in this message here, he
[1:25:50] talks about how the Holy Spirit can be
[1:25:51] falling. And you know, it doesn't matter
[1:25:53] if a person is a sinner or or she, but
[1:25:56] what they're bound to sense the presence
[1:25:57] of God when you see the word he promised
[1:26:01] being fulfilled. What is that word being
[1:26:05] promised that he fulfilled? It's not a
[1:26:09] healing line. It's not a campaign. Don't
[1:26:12] get caught up in that. Don't look for
[1:26:13] signs and wonders, brothers and sisters.
[1:26:15] Although they follow, but look for that
[1:26:17] word being fulfilled in our lives, our
[1:26:20] ability to say amen to that angel that
[1:26:24] comes our way. Yes, sir. I was looking
[1:26:27] at it, the story of Zachariah and and
[1:26:30] and Mary and how the angels the angel
[1:26:35] came to both of them and and you know
[1:26:38] Zachariah, what did he do? questioned it
[1:26:40] and and Mary, she did also. Isn't that
[1:26:44] interesting?
[1:26:45] But the man, I believe he should have
[1:26:47] just said, "Amen." Just like the girl
[1:26:49] did. But the girl's question was
[1:26:52] reasonable because she said, "How could
[1:26:54] it happen seeing that I know no man?"
[1:26:57] And we know that brother Brandham talks
[1:26:59] about the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:01] being exactly like that. It's without
[1:27:02] sensation. Now humans when they actually
[1:27:06] come together and the twain become one
[1:27:09] there's a sensation and that's why
[1:27:11] brother Brandham said don't be hugging
[1:27:12] up to anyone except for your spouse
[1:27:16] parents and children okay but for a man
[1:27:19] and a woman in a congregation to be
[1:27:21] hugging up and being friendly and giving
[1:27:23] hugs and people in the world we give
[1:27:25] hugs we're huggy people that's what we
[1:27:27] do it's not right that's what the
[1:27:29] prophet said why is that because you
[1:27:30] leave an imprint on that person.
[1:27:34] It's impossible to do that and not have
[1:27:36] a sensation. And we might not have a
[1:27:37] sensation, but that other person might.
[1:27:40] That's where brother Brandham talks. I
[1:27:42] could go a long ways with it. I'm not
[1:27:43] going to. But you know what I'm saying?
[1:27:46] People don't need to look for the word
[1:27:49] of promise being fulfilled. I I I I
[1:27:53] maybe they do need to look and sometimes
[1:27:55] God will allow it to happen, but we
[1:27:56] oughtn't to look for a great sign or
[1:27:59] wonder. We ought to look to the word of
[1:28:01] God. Can we say amen to the word of God?
[1:28:04] Can we actually not parrot the prophet,
[1:28:06] but speak what the prophet said and and
[1:28:08] actually listen and follow what that
[1:28:11] prophet said about getting back to the
[1:28:13] word of God and then live that word even
[1:28:16] if it makes us uncomfortable in the
[1:28:18] situations that we're in in our lives.
[1:28:20] He goes on to say, then you would have
[1:28:22] to be numb if you can't sense the
[1:28:24] presence of God falling in a service.
[1:28:27] And the presence of God falls in a
[1:28:29] service, brothers and sisters, in our
[1:28:30] our climate, in our area, maybe when
[1:28:32] we're singing, maybe when people play in
[1:28:34] the spirit. Maybe some people might
[1:28:36] dance in the spirit. You know, the
[1:28:38] spirit of God falls in the midst of the
[1:28:40] service when people say amen to the word
[1:28:42] of God. The more people say amen, the
[1:28:45] more the spirit falls. That's the way it
[1:28:46] works. When people pull, people preach.
[1:28:50] He says, then you would have to be numb.
[1:28:52] And when you see it with your own eyes
[1:28:54] happening, then you'll have to be blind
[1:28:57] spiritually. I'm not speaking
[1:28:59] physically. He says, "But you can
[1:29:02] certainly be spiritually blind and have
[1:29:05] 2020s physical sight."
[1:29:09] Now, that one to me was a little bit of
[1:29:10] a shocker, but I mean, it's exactly in
[1:29:12] line with what we're talking about,
[1:29:13] brothers and sisters. It's incredible,
[1:29:15] but it's true. We can be sitting in a
[1:29:17] church service and be able to see
[1:29:18] perfectly with our eyes 2020 vision and
[1:29:21] completely miss this word of God. And
[1:29:23] why is that? Is because we'll say, "I
[1:29:26] know it already. I've already got it,
[1:29:29] man. You're not telling me nothing new."
[1:29:31] And maybe we're not speaking anything
[1:29:33] new. But does this word make us say
[1:29:36] amen? Does it give something inside of
[1:29:38] us excitement? Do we get excited about
[1:29:41] it? He says, "Do you remember Elijah
[1:29:43] down at Dothan where he went out and
[1:29:45] smoked the the whole army blind?" And we
[1:29:48] we know the stories in 2 Kings chapter
[1:29:50] 6. I'm not going to go into it tonight,
[1:29:52] but we know the the servant, he came out
[1:29:54] and he woke up and and looked out the
[1:29:56] window and said, "Whoa, we're
[1:29:58] surrounded, master, how shall we do?
[1:30:01] We're going to die. They've got us,
[1:30:04] man." And he said, "Ah." put down his
[1:30:07] cup of coffee, got up and walked out the
[1:30:09] door. Marched right out into the face of
[1:30:11] the enemy. This guy must have been
[1:30:12] afraid. His servant must have been
[1:30:14] shockingly afraid. But what did he do?
[1:30:16] He walked right out there and said, "Hey
[1:30:17] boys, who are you looking for? What's
[1:30:19] up? We're looking for that prophet, that
[1:30:22] troublemaker," they said, right? And we
[1:30:24] know he said, "Oh, I know where he is.
[1:30:26] You want me to show you?" And they said,
[1:30:27] "Yeah." And he led them right into
[1:30:30] Israel. Took the Syrians right into
[1:30:32] Israel. We know the story.
[1:30:35] And what did he do? He didn't slaughter
[1:30:36] them either. He said, "Make them a a
[1:30:39] table. Prepare a table before your
[1:30:42] enemies."
[1:30:46] But he says the Bible said that he did.
[1:30:48] He smoked that whole army blind
[1:30:51] and led them right into an ambush when
[1:30:53] they didn't know who he was. And yet had
[1:30:56] his just exactly what he was supposed to
[1:30:58] look like and so forth. And he went
[1:31:01] right out to them, but they were blind.
[1:31:06] And you can stand in the presence of the
[1:31:08] living God. You can stand under the
[1:31:10] anointing of the spirit and see it
[1:31:13] moving and still it won't touch you.
[1:31:18] Why? How does that work? How can we have
[1:31:21] a worship service and people just be
[1:31:23] flat,
[1:31:25] believe this message but just have
[1:31:27] nothing to offer God.
[1:31:32] It's the word of a vindicated prophet
[1:31:33] here. We can stand in the presence of
[1:31:35] the living God. Some people might say,
[1:31:37] well, you know, if I was standing in the
[1:31:39] presence of that prophet, I would be
[1:31:41] standing in the presence of the living
[1:31:42] God. If I was in that position on the
[1:31:45] stage where he said, "Can you feel that?
[1:31:48] Not two feet from me is the angel of the
[1:31:50] Lord." Then we would be standing in the
[1:31:53] presence of God. Brothers and sisters,
[1:31:55] where two or three are gathered together
[1:31:58] in his name, the word of God says that
[1:32:00] he's there. Amen.
[1:32:02] But I want to say this. Are we
[1:32:04] spiritually numb? Do we get to a place
[1:32:06] where we become so spiritually numb, we
[1:32:09] just don't sense his presence? It's just
[1:32:11] another gathering in the name of Calgary
[1:32:14] living word instead of the name of the
[1:32:17] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:32:21] He says, "You can see what God said
[1:32:23] preached to you perfectly and then
[1:32:26] manifested and still won't go in, still
[1:32:29] won't cross over, still won't go all the
[1:32:32] way. Still have reservations. Still say,
[1:32:34] "I've got a traditional teaching and
[1:32:36] we've done it this way my whole entire
[1:32:38] life." And I'm not changing for nobody.
[1:32:39] I'm not saying adapt your ways to
[1:32:41] Calvary Living Word. I'm saying make
[1:32:42] sure that our ways line up with the
[1:32:45] word.
[1:32:46] That's what I'm saying.
[1:32:49] says they won't go in. Don't believe it.
[1:32:51] Then there you are beyond reach.
[1:32:56] You're already dead.
[1:32:59] I say, Lord have mercy.
[1:33:01] Numb, blinded, gone on. He said they
[1:33:05] were completely.
[1:33:09] I think it's incredible when we look at
[1:33:10] this story here.
[1:33:12] We're only getting to the good stuff
[1:33:15] now. And uh we still have a few minutes
[1:33:17] so certainly trust the Lord here.
[1:33:22] Brother Random says in this message we
[1:33:23] could preach a sermon on that. How that
[1:33:25] God no matter he is in glory but his
[1:33:27] orders there is just the same effect on
[1:33:30] the whole world and anybody that takes
[1:33:32] the promise.
[1:33:34] His order is given.
[1:33:37] his laws of nature,
[1:33:40] they absolutely carry themselves true
[1:33:44] from Pentecost or any other time. And
[1:33:47] remember, we talked about Pentecost.
[1:33:49] It's not the Pentecostal church. Brother
[1:33:51] Brandham says it very clearly in the
[1:33:53] message. It's not the Pentecostal
[1:33:55] assemblies. It's not the Pentecostal
[1:33:57] denomination.
[1:33:58] It's a Pentecostal experience. Yes. And
[1:34:02] and to fast forward from the days of
[1:34:04] Joshua to the day of Pentecost when it
[1:34:07] was fully come, we know that the Holy
[1:34:09] Ghost swept into the room and they were
[1:34:10] all baptized with cloven licks of fire
[1:34:13] over their head and they were able to
[1:34:15] speak in tongues. A and it was actually
[1:34:18] an understandable speech. It wasn't
[1:34:20] glosselia. It was actually according to
[1:34:24] the languages of the people around. And
[1:34:26] he was able they were able to minister
[1:34:29] to those people. It wasn't actually out
[1:34:32] of the norms. And and brother Bradam
[1:34:34] says here that it will be absolutely
[1:34:36] carry themselves true from Pentecost or
[1:34:38] any other time. Any time that God made
[1:34:42] the promise, he will stay still stay
[1:34:47] with that promise regardless of where
[1:34:50] the people is at. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:34:53] Just like he says that it doesn't
[1:34:55] matter. There ain't no unbelief that can
[1:34:57] actually stop the word of God. Amen. We
[1:35:00] can come to a service and say, "It's
[1:35:02] brother Barry again, you know, blah blah
[1:35:04] blah or brother so and so. I just don't
[1:35:07] believe the way they preach it. I can't
[1:35:09] see God calling a man like that."
[1:35:11] Whatever it is in our heart, fold our
[1:35:13] arms and and grudge through the service.
[1:35:16] We could do that, but it doesn't stop
[1:35:20] the purpose of God. There's no amount of
[1:35:23] unbelief that can stop it. And I think
[1:35:25] it's beautiful. You can talk about
[1:35:27] brother Bradom and I think he was in
[1:35:28] Germany, isn't it? When he was in
[1:35:30] Germany and he talked about having the
[1:35:32] service outside and there was witch
[1:35:34] doctors, there was people maybe
[1:35:36] Satanists. They were they were trying to
[1:35:38] cast a spell and they were chanting
[1:35:40] trying to get the storm whipped up and
[1:35:42] the storm was whipping up. And you know
[1:35:43] what he said about those people? He said
[1:35:46] that they were Pentecostals. Yes.
[1:35:49] Splitting feathers,
[1:35:52] creating witchcraft, doing their thing,
[1:35:54] trying to mess up. But, you know, they
[1:35:56] could not stop God's prophet from
[1:35:59] fulfilling his word.
[1:36:01] You know, I think that word witchcraft
[1:36:03] is really interesting, too, when you
[1:36:04] think about it because many times we'll
[1:36:06] think about candles and pentagrams and
[1:36:08] all the different things that go along
[1:36:09] with witchcraft. And, you know, I'm not
[1:36:11] going to go too far with that, but what
[1:36:13] does the Bible say? The Bible says that
[1:36:15] rebellion actually not following the
[1:36:18] word of God. The spirit a rebellious
[1:36:20] spirit, a child that has a rebellious
[1:36:23] spirit, I would say a a lay member that
[1:36:25] has a rebellious spirit, a a spouse that
[1:36:28] has a rebellious spirit, a pastor that
[1:36:31] has a rebellious spirit, an evangelist
[1:36:34] that has a rebellious spirit, any human
[1:36:36] being that has a rebellious spirit. It's
[1:36:38] as the wi the the the the the spirit of
[1:36:41] witchcraft.
[1:36:43] It's the same.
[1:36:46] I say, Lord, let us not be rebellious
[1:36:48] people.
[1:36:51] But you know, Brother Brandham says he
[1:36:53] he will stay. He will still stay with
[1:36:56] that promise regardless of where the
[1:36:58] people's at. Thank you, Lord. Hebrews
[1:37:00] 13:8. How many thousands of years off
[1:37:03] his laws ever remain the same? I am so
[1:37:06] thankful for that because I know as a
[1:37:08] human being, I have let him down. But
[1:37:12] you know, I haven't surprised him.
[1:37:15] I know that. And he's always there. That
[1:37:19] song, his makes his mercy new every day.
[1:37:21] He's he's there for us. And brother
[1:37:24] Brandham says it very clearly. How do we
[1:37:26] fix it if we ever have a problem in our
[1:37:28] life? Brothers and sisters, I don't even
[1:37:30] know why this message came up other than
[1:37:32] listening to it. But to preach it like
[1:37:34] this tonight, you know, the only thing
[1:37:36] we need to do is go back to where we got
[1:37:38] off. Amen.
[1:37:40] And if it works that way with God, it
[1:37:42] can work that way in our relationships
[1:37:44] if we just simply go back to where we
[1:37:46] got off.
[1:37:48] But sometimes we've got to remember that
[1:37:50] we're given one mouth and two ears for a
[1:37:53] reason. The two ears are so that we can
[1:37:56] listen more than we talk. Otherwise,
[1:37:59] we'd have two mouths and one ear.
[1:38:03] But God's pretty pretty wise the way he
[1:38:06] does his creation.
[1:38:08] Out of the paradox, brother Bradomy
[1:38:10] says, "How the seed falls into the
[1:38:11] ground and it rots
[1:38:14] and to bring forth life again."
[1:38:17] Looks like if it was ever going to bring
[1:38:19] forth life, it'd be in its perfect
[1:38:22] shape.
[1:38:24] Not so. And that's where I say, brothers
[1:38:27] and sisters, if people want to come to
[1:38:29] the house of God, let them come. If they
[1:38:33] want to come in here look a certain way,
[1:38:35] let them come. If they want to come in
[1:38:37] here with a some kind of an attitude,
[1:38:40] let them come.
[1:38:42] Get in here. Get right in here and get
[1:38:45] in the presence of God and let the word
[1:38:48] wash us. Because that's the only way
[1:38:50] we're going to get success in our lives
[1:38:52] is if we can be washed by the water of
[1:38:54] the word and and and get some faith
[1:38:56] inside of us. How does faith come? The
[1:38:58] only way faith comes is by hearing and
[1:39:01] hearing of the word of God.
[1:39:05] So if we go and say, "Well, that person
[1:39:07] is just doing this and that person is
[1:39:09] just doing that." How can we ever ever
[1:39:12] let them in? They're just going to
[1:39:13] disrupt the service so bad. I'll never
[1:39:15] be able to worship God because I know
[1:39:17] that's going on. Why are we here? What
[1:39:19] are we doing? We're going back to that
[1:39:21] law that we talked about. That's that's
[1:39:23] this side of Jordan. We want to get on
[1:39:25] the other side of Jordan.
[1:39:30] Brother Brandham, he talks about how if
[1:39:32] if life ever was in it, talking about
[1:39:35] the seed now, if life ever was in it,
[1:39:38] then why wouldn't it just come forth?
[1:39:41] Put it in the ground and the life would
[1:39:43] just spring forth. Why does all that's
[1:39:46] around that life, all that's around that
[1:39:48] germ that no man can find, how is it
[1:39:51] that everything material around that
[1:39:53] germ has to die?
[1:39:57] He says, "So it can bring forth in a new
[1:40:00] life." Now remember, we don't need to be
[1:40:03] conformed
[1:40:05] to Jesus Christ. We need to be
[1:40:08] transformed
[1:40:10] by the renewing of our minds. So when we
[1:40:13] want to talk about brainwashing, that's
[1:40:15] exactly what's going to happen. But you
[1:40:16] know, he's going to take and give us a
[1:40:18] new heart. He's going to take and give
[1:40:20] us a new mind because the mind that he's
[1:40:22] going to give us is going to be his
[1:40:24] mind. It ain't going to be our mind.
[1:40:26] It's not going to be us plus him. And I
[1:40:28] think that's what a lot of times happens
[1:40:30] with Christianity. That's what happens a
[1:40:32] lot of times with the message of the
[1:40:33] hour. I had to come to the place where I
[1:40:36] had to say, you know, all the
[1:40:37] Pentecostal teaching that I thought that
[1:40:38] I had, I just need to set it aside. Not
[1:40:40] throw it in the garbage can. Just set it
[1:40:42] aside and just say, Lord, teach me. And
[1:40:46] sometimes we can grow up. I know it by
[1:40:48] talking to people even in the message of
[1:40:50] the hour and think that we've got the
[1:40:53] edge on everything. But what we haven't
[1:40:55] got is truly the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:58] Spirit in our lives.
[1:41:00] Now, why would you say that, Brother
[1:41:01] Barry? Because I could say there's still
[1:41:03] wars and fightings amongst us. Now,
[1:41:07] we'll get into a scripture in the last
[1:41:08] five minutes here, but we'll read this.
[1:41:10] Brother Brandham, he says, "So it can
[1:41:11] spring forth in a new life, but
[1:41:14] everything around it must also die and
[1:41:18] rot
[1:41:19] before it can spring forth to life out
[1:41:21] of the invisible unity of the bride of
[1:41:23] Jesus Christ." Brother Radam says,
[1:41:24] "Every speck of the old man has to die."
[1:41:29] Every single speck. Now, that's hard.
[1:41:34] Ask me how I know
[1:41:36] cuz I feel like there's still some of
[1:41:38] the old man here. I don't know. And I
[1:41:41] think as long as we're here, brothers
[1:41:43] and sisters, we're going to have some of
[1:41:44] that old man. Because, you know, this
[1:41:48] flesh is never going to be converted.
[1:41:51] This flesh is always going to be our
[1:41:53] enemy. This flesh is always going to be
[1:41:55] enmity against the word of God.
[1:41:59] But if we have the word of God inside of
[1:42:01] us, yet yay, God himself inside of us,
[1:42:06] then he will always prevail over this
[1:42:08] flesh. That's right. And that's what I
[1:42:11] want to encourage us tonight, brothers
[1:42:12] and sisters. So it is with an
[1:42:16] individual, brother Brandham says. Now
[1:42:18] remember, he's talking about the seed.
[1:42:19] So it can spring forth in a new life,
[1:42:22] but everything around it must also die
[1:42:24] and rot before it can spring forth to
[1:42:26] life. So is it with an individual
[1:42:30] as long as there is any human
[1:42:33] injections. Well, my parents taught it
[1:42:36] this way. The church that I used to go
[1:42:38] to taught it that way. And I think that
[1:42:42] we should do it the other way.
[1:42:45] As long as there's any human
[1:42:47] interjections, human ideas,
[1:42:51] then God's germ of life, what's his germ
[1:42:55] of life? Can you see that in there? Then
[1:42:58] God's germ of life, the what?
[1:43:02] Can't work.
[1:43:05] This is why brother Barry harps about
[1:43:07] this all the time, brothers and sisters.
[1:43:08] It's got to be a new spirit placed
[1:43:10] within us. Remember, Brother Brandham
[1:43:11] said that we need a new spirit. Why?
[1:43:13] Because we can't hardly get along with
[1:43:15] our own spirit.
[1:43:17] We can't hardly get along with our own
[1:43:18] selves. And I know myself, I was talking
[1:43:22] about a little while ago, there comes
[1:43:23] times, you ever have that time, I'll say
[1:43:25] it tonight, where you look at that guy
[1:43:26] in the mirror and you're just disgusted
[1:43:28] with that guy in the mirror.
[1:43:31] You just, you're like,
[1:43:35] I can't look. So it is with an
[1:43:38] individual. says, "As long as there's
[1:43:40] any human interjections, human ideas,
[1:43:42] then God's germ of life, the Holy Spirit
[1:43:45] cannot work. You cannot be healed as
[1:43:48] long as there is a fraction somewhere."
[1:43:51] Now, don't necessarily look at our
[1:43:53] bodies and think about a human healing.
[1:43:55] Think about our souls. Think about the
[1:43:57] eternal life. Think about that Holy
[1:43:59] Ghost and the crossing over of Jordan.
[1:44:01] Think about being able to speak to the
[1:44:03] sun. Think about being able to speak to
[1:44:05] the wind. Think about being able to
[1:44:06] speak to that problem in your life. When
[1:44:08] the devil comes along and tries to rise
[1:44:11] up against you, think about having that
[1:44:13] power. That power is you. You're the
[1:44:16] paradox. But the only way that power is
[1:44:19] there if there's a complete death here.
[1:44:22] That's it. To think that we're going to
[1:44:25] carry on with a speck of the old man and
[1:44:27] just assume or or better yet or worse
[1:44:30] yet, presume.
[1:44:32] Brother Bradom says, "What is it to
[1:44:34] presume is to venture without
[1:44:37] authority." We know there was seven sons
[1:44:40] of SA, right? Boy, I feel like I want to
[1:44:44] preach now. And what did they do? They
[1:44:47] went and decided to make a show of it.
[1:44:48] They said, "We're going to have uh signs
[1:44:50] and wonders. We're going to have a
[1:44:51] prayer line in our service. We're going
[1:44:52] to really get her done." And what did
[1:44:54] they do? They went and actually tried to
[1:44:56] cast a devil out of a man. and and and
[1:44:58] and that spirit that was in the man, he
[1:45:00] said, "You know, Paul, I know and and
[1:45:02] Jesus, I know, but who are you? You
[1:45:05] still got some of the old man alive in
[1:45:07] you. You don't have the Holy Spirit all
[1:45:09] the way. You've experienced the
[1:45:11] anointings of the Holy Ghost. But who
[1:45:13] are you?"
[1:45:15] And we know that they got it. They got
[1:45:17] it bad. Brother says, "You cannot be
[1:45:20] healed as long as there is just a
[1:45:22] fraction somewhere that it's not rotten
[1:45:26] yet. It's got all the human elements,
[1:45:29] all the scientific ideas, all of it
[1:45:32] figured out. Man, I know how this should
[1:45:33] be. This should be this way. It's always
[1:45:35] going to work good if we do it this way.
[1:45:37] He says, "All the days of miracles has
[1:45:39] passed." So-called all that has to all
[1:45:43] not only die, but rot.
[1:45:47] Then from there grows the germ of life
[1:45:51] unto a new life. That's the only way it
[1:45:54] can grow.
[1:45:56] And I just want to say it this way,
[1:45:57] brothers and sisters. Sometimes it can
[1:45:59] be as simple as we said earlier. Shut
[1:46:01] off our phone, dedicate a day, dedicate
[1:46:05] two days, dedicate a week, go somewhere
[1:46:07] away from everywhere and spend some time
[1:46:09] with the Lord and just say, "Be it unto
[1:46:12] me according to your will, according to
[1:46:14] your word." Because that's his will.
[1:46:18] It's the only way it can grow. We've got
[1:46:20] to die out to ourselves.
[1:46:22] Now, I know that we've got pressures in
[1:46:24] life. And you know, if God knows that
[1:46:26] we've got a genuine desire in our heart,
[1:46:29] we don't need to go and labor and spend
[1:46:31] weeks and months. We don't have to go
[1:46:34] and labor and spend days.
[1:46:37] In an instant, just like that, without
[1:46:41] sensation, when he knows that we're
[1:46:43] ready to be genuine, when he knows that
[1:46:45] we are absolutely ready to say, "I
[1:46:48] forsake all, but I take you."
[1:46:51] Then we got it. Then we cross over
[1:46:54] Jordan.
[1:46:57] Excuse me, I'll call the musicians.
[1:46:58] Brother Bradom, he says, "That's the
[1:47:00] reason we don't get what we ask for."
[1:47:03] Brother Bradom says this. We try to take
[1:47:06] with us as much of our own ideas.
[1:47:10] We got to stop doing that, brothers and
[1:47:12] sisters.
[1:47:13] Guilty. I'm guilty.
[1:47:17] We got to stop taking our own ideas and
[1:47:19] thinking that it should be a certain
[1:47:20] way. You know, over in the book of James
[1:47:22] chapter 4 says it in there very very
[1:47:25] clearly. He calls the people adulterers
[1:47:28] and adulteresses.
[1:47:30] And why does he do that? If you go and
[1:47:32] listen to uh or even read in Romans
[1:47:35] chapter 7 how brother Brandham talks
[1:47:36] about the adulteress,
[1:47:39] someone who actually has a living
[1:47:41] husband but doesn't actually let that
[1:47:45] husband die and then goes and tries to
[1:47:47] get married again, goes and tries to get
[1:47:49] married to Christ, goes and tries to
[1:47:51] follow Christ but still has that old
[1:47:52] husband there. She's an adulteress and
[1:47:55] we know she is a type of the church, the
[1:47:57] feminine. If we are not willing to kill
[1:48:01] that old man, Brother Bradam says it,
[1:48:03] then we become an adulterer, an an
[1:48:05] adulteress, we cannot have two living
[1:48:09] husbands. We cannot do that. And I'll go
[1:48:11] so far as to say this, brothers and
[1:48:13] sisters, we cannot have two living
[1:48:14] wives.
[1:48:16] It's against the word of God. But in
[1:48:19] James, he says that we wind up asking
[1:48:21] upon our lusts. Oh my, I think that we
[1:48:25] should have it this way. I think that I
[1:48:27] should have it that way. Because of this
[1:48:28] in my life, because of that in my life,
[1:48:31] I believe that it should be the other.
[1:48:33] Soon as we start doing that, we've got
[1:48:35] problems. Brother Brandham, he says this
[1:48:37] in closing, maybe stand with me. He
[1:48:40] says, "There it stays. It cannot grow to
[1:48:42] that perfect image of Christ until every
[1:48:44] word of God is received into you."
[1:48:48] And then
[1:48:50] here we are, the pinnacle of the
[1:48:52] service. And then you become that word.
[1:48:57] It's like the seed that went into the
[1:48:59] ground. God bless you tonight, brothers
[1:49:02] and sisters.
[1:49:04] You are the paradox when that word goes
[1:49:06] inside of you. Let's pray. Heavenly
[1:49:10] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:49:12] your word. We thank you, Lord Jesus,
[1:49:15] that we can hear the word that you gave
[1:49:18] to this age, Lord.
[1:49:21] Father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we
[1:49:23] can lay ourselves upon your altar,
[1:49:26] Father, and and and and die out to
[1:49:28] ourselves,
[1:49:30] Father. Our desire is to know you in a
[1:49:33] greater way, in a greater measure. And
[1:49:36] Father, tonight I I just pray Lord while
[1:49:39] we're all praying to you, Father, that
[1:49:41] Lord, if there's anybody that doesn't
[1:49:43] know you the way that we've spoke about
[1:49:45] tonight,
[1:49:47] fully in the power of your resurrection
[1:49:49] to become a new creature in Christ
[1:49:51] Jesus. Father, I pray that you would
[1:49:54] just allow them, Lord Jesus, the space
[1:49:58] to come to the realization that they can
[1:50:00] know you that way.
[1:50:03] And one more time, Father, if there's
[1:50:04] anybody here whose experience has just
[1:50:07] grown cold because of the pressures of
[1:50:09] life, Father, I pray that Lord, they
[1:50:12] would be able to just raise their hands
[1:50:14] unto you, lift their cup up, and just
[1:50:16] ask you to fill their cup once again,
[1:50:18] Lord. Father, we know there was only one
[1:50:20] difference between the the virgins,
[1:50:22] Lord. One had oil and one didn't. And
[1:50:25] Father, that's why we gathered together
[1:50:27] in your name, so that we can have the
[1:50:28] oil that we need. Father, help us, Lord,
[1:50:31] to to see the old man die. Help us, Lord
[1:50:34] Jesus, to purge our minds and our hearts
[1:50:37] of old traditional thinking and and
[1:50:39] teachings, Lord, and just allow you, the
[1:50:42] spirit of truth, manifest to us and
[1:50:44] through us, Lord, that we would be able
[1:50:47] to see all of that old man die. Oh,
[1:50:50] Father, and that new life grow. Oh,
[1:50:53] Lord, help us to witness that new life
[1:50:55] growing in our lives. Father, we love
[1:50:58] you tonight and we thank you for your
[1:50:59] goodness and your tender mercies.
[1:51:01] Father, we pray that you would be with
[1:51:03] our visitors, Lord. That you would bless
[1:51:04] their way, Father, that you would just
[1:51:07] put a a spring in their step, Lord
[1:51:09] Jesus, and a song in their heart,
[1:51:11] Father, and grant to them traveling
[1:51:12] mercies. Father, we love you and we
[1:51:15] thank you. We just ask now that you
[1:51:17] would go with each one of us as we go
[1:51:18] our separate ways. And if it's your will
[1:51:20] for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord,
[1:51:23] we'll bring a sacrifice of praise unto
[1:51:26] you, Father. We'll recognize why we
[1:51:28] gather because we gather together in
[1:51:31] your presence. We love you and we thank
[1:51:33] you. We ask all these things in Jesus
[1:51:36] Christ's name we pray.
[1:51:39] Amen. Amen.
