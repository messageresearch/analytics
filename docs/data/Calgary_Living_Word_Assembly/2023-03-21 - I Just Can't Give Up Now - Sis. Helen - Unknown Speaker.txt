========================================

God bless you Saints um just when we're about to get ready for church this morning I was actually in the washroom when uh I was called on that my son Benny was just throwing up so he was fine last night but he woke up sick so I just looked at him and I just prayed I said Lord I know the devil wants our attention this morning but we are not giving him that attention and you know it's just strange that this morning brother Barry just said Jesus needs our attention so I rather give my attention to God than give it to the devil thank God [Music] there would be mountains I would have to climb and there would be battles I would have to fight but Victory or defeat it's up to me to decide how can I expect to win if I never tried [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just can't give now I've come too far from where I start from nobody told me the road would be easy and I don't believe brought me this far to leave me he never said there wouldn't be trials he never said I won't fall he never said that everything will go the way I wanted to go but when my back is against the wall and I feel a hope is gone I I just lift my head up to the sky and say help me to be strong [Music] I just just can't give up now I've come too far from where I started from nobody told me the road would be easy and I don't believe brought me this far to leave me oh Lord you didn't bring me out here to live me lonely even when I Can See Clearly I know [Music] that against [Music] [Music] leave me I just can't give up now I've come too far from where I start from nobody told me the road would be easy and I don't believe you've brought me this far to leave me no I don't believe you've brought me this far to leave me yes I don't believe you brought me this far to leave me thank you [Applause]
