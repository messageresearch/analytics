just so thankful [Music] welcome to the house of the Lord once again on a Wednesday evening beautiful spring day we have more birds passing through what a tremendous opportunity it is to be here tonight his living representation here on Earth and we know I think we said it on Sunday as the birds change their song because they can sense the seasons change how the bride changes her song she can recognize the change in the season as well what an amazing time we live we have a couple of announcements tonight before we get into the word brother Mila and sister in this kakuji announce the birth of their baby girl sister Mila Jermaine kakuji was born I should have offered a picture maybe I'll just check with a brother and we'll see if we can share some pictures she's an absolute sweetheart just a beautiful little girl we want to do a baby dedication when the rotation comes around next we'll see we'll try and work that out we have a brother in the city that would like to fellowship with us he's been around the message for I think just over a year now he picked it up in Dublin Ireland he heard about the word in an online Bible study goes to show this online thing there's nothing going to stop the word of God he's going to blow every single one of our paradigms the way that we think things should be maybe the way things were done all the way along in the past we're going to throw those things away and we're going to move forward and he's going to force us he's not going to force us but he's going to cause us to actually get into him and forget about all the things that that maybe would hold us down and give us the opportunity to just be free and completely liberated in him so we want to welcome a brother named Fergus Howard I've been communicating with them I will meet with him this week and we'll we'll just see what the Lord will do we'll add added him to a list in one of the groups and we'll see see how things go um perhaps if he's good with it we'll pass out his contact information I'm sure he would love to fellowship with believers so we'll just see how that goes pray for brother Howard Fergus Howard and uh just remember him in prayer there's a few things that we'd like to talk about uh in terms of housekeeping but we'll get into that a bit later maybe on Sunday [Music] um prayer request tonight we just have praise reports tonight and I just think how how fitting for a service like this sister Charmaine is at home and well blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] spoke to my dad today I've spoke to him every day just about and uh he said his eyesight in his left eye is back I have a little quote that I want to read before we get too far down the road and you know what's sort of been on my heart the background to it all talking about church order brothers and sisters is about what we're experiencing right here tonight and that's Revival that's having an excitement for the word it's not just a mundane service it's not just an ordinary everyday Wednesday night service in the middle of the week just because that's what we do it's because we get to go to the house of the Lord and meet with him and all he wants is a sincere heart like brother Toby said it's so true we have such an opportunity to fellowship with the Lord Revival is what I'm looking for brothers and sisters and I know that we're not talking about the World Revival brother Bradham says it very clearly that's over but there's still a Revival in the bride it's an individual Revival every single day of Our Lives to understand the reason we have breath is because he put it there and he put it there for a purpose not just so that we can take air oxygen out of this world and consume minerals it's so that we can be a representation a living witness of him on Earth in our age it's quotes out of Jehovah Jireh in 1962 striking at the women and men both last night and seeing them in respect to the word seeing them stand up and admit they're wrong [Music] want God's forgiveness and to go on brother Bradham says this is the place to have Revival when we're willing to forgive when we're willing to have hearts that say I'm wrong how do we actually cause forgiveness in a relationship it's to admit that we're wrong if we go into a a conversation to say I'm you know I made a mistake but you know I'm a human and I just make mistakes what's that gonna do in the relationship as a friend or or to our wife or to whoever it is we have to have a humble heart we have to come with that approach brothers and sisters he says this is the place to have Revival if there'd be any Revival I know of it had happened right along here where Honest Hearts why you've got something to work on see something most of them will get arrogant they don't want you to tell them about it just remember that type of a seed is a denominational seat but we're not talking to denominational seeds here tonight he says not a Seed of Abraham a Seed of Abraham sees the word and believes the word quickly Brothers and Sisters Let's have a Revival it doesn't have to be in the church it doesn't have to be a Pentecostal thing I'm not looking for that I want to see every single one of our brothers and sisters have complete Liberty in the word and have complete Liberty with the Lord in their lives and in their homes and in their families and not be bound by anything that could bind us Up and Hold Us Down blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to him in prayer tonight if you do have a need just make it known with an uplifted hand gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just want to come to you with sincere Hearts tonight as our brother prayed father Lord we don't want to have anything hiding in the background Lord we don't want to Lord hinder your spirit in any way father we pray that you would just meet every single need represented by the uplifted hand tonight father and as our brother prayed we we just ask that you would do something special for us tonight Lord that this wouldn't be just an ordinary service and Lord I know for sure that that's exactly what you had planned before our brother prayed it because tonight it is different father we just love you and we thank you and we bless your name one more time you have already Vindicated your word Lord Jesus already shown the confirmation for this direction so father I'm excited we're excited Lord for what you want to do tonight in this service just take your Liberty tonight father we pray let me get out of the way father I pray and you can just use us tonight For Your Glory we just ask that you would bless this service now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Hallelujah what a wonderful God we serve thank you musicians special thank you to all the musicians who bring of their gifts every single service week after week not just here but at Lethbridge so many different opportunities tonight we're definitely taking a different direction if you could turn in your Bibles to John chapter 8. [Music] John chapter 8 I trust it's a familiar scripture and I just we got into it a little while ago in in terms of studying and it just spoke to me so strongly John chapter 8 verse 1. Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again to the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they said unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very Act now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayeth thou this said they this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst and when Jesus lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we know that you've inspired this word tonight you've inspired this word to be spoken father this word was inspired thousands of years ago we know that but Lord Jesus what good is it a thousand years ago it has to be alive today and Father we just thank you that you have given us Revelation about this word for our day and Lord we don't make ourselves anything if anything this humbles us because we know that is the word that you speak to your bride even tonight so father we pray that you would just take the words that are spoken tonight and speak to us sovereignly Lord Jesus as our brother prayed already we thank you for meeting his prayer because when we leave this building tonight this will not be a normal ordinary service and father we're just excited to see the Liberty that you have in store for us Blessed Be Your Name we just ask that you would bless this word now father to each and every one of us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated what a privilege it is it just was bouncing around in my head over the last little while thinking about the uh the the temple and and and uh and and the exact order that God laid out for the children of Israel in the wilderness and and and then to have the the the the the the Brick and Mortar temple built by Solomon for the Lord and to implement the exact same measures but but the exacting description the the instructions to build the temple and then to execute the the positions in the offices in the temple how complicated how extremely complicated to build to maintain and then to execute the offices and and and here we are tonight here we are every day of Our Lives we have the ability to enter into the the most holy Place commonly referred to as the holiest of holies but the word calls it the most holy place behind the inner Veil one more time here we are brothers and sisters and to be behind the pulpit called The Sacred desk to think that we have something to bring to feed the children of God it's it's daunting sometimes but he always comes through I thought I had thoughts when I came to the church this afternoon but I'll tell you it completely changed sometimes there's a little change but today was just totally different tonight I want to talk about aren't accusers what a powerful scripture this is we could just talk about this scripture I feel like in in terms of just reading it and and you know Jesus standing up and saying woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned me condemned thee and you know brother Branham he preaches the indictment and and what he does is is he discredits he discredits the accusers in that message he totally disassembles the prosecution and he does the same thing right here woman where are those line accusers because he who has no sin just go ahead you can be the one just go and cast the first stone that that one of you who is perfect without sin tonight I don't want to talk about that what I do want to talk about is is is getting more so into the way the Lord views the church um mixing things and and bringing things in and and getting mixed up with with different ideologies and and things that can so easily beset us and and cause the word of God to be of none effect it's kind of the curse of the age the the laodicean church to be lukewarm formal and Powerless and and none of us wants to be there but I I just believe the Lord totally brought us this way so let's let's go you know let's turn over to Genesis chapter one Genesis chapter 1. sort of the I don't even know what you call it the context maybe of the thought would be just just talking about adultery and I believe that this this is going a direction that has many many many different directions from this direction and uh and and we're going to see what the Lord has his story here I'm excited about it but in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 very familiar scripture where we're all very familiar with there might be some that aren't though so uh we'll just sort of try and set a background here Genesis 1 verse 27. so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now we know many times people will just read that like a newspaper and they'll just gloss right over it and they won't catch what's being said in the word and what's being said in the word was brought to us clearly by the prophet to say that this was a spiritual creation of man and woman they were one they weren't two separate beings at this point they were one and it was in spirit form that they were created both masculine and both feminine and that's exactly what the word says he created both male and female in spirit form then over in Chapter 2 chapter 2 verse 7. just one page over and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and a Man became a living soul and at this point that's where Man became a living Soul just like the word said that's where he became flesh and Bone that's where he was created out of the 16 elements that brother Bradham talks about that that that he creates a body from and then we go further we just I guess I just want to make this point that male and female are still in this body that hasn't changed the spirit form both masculine and feminine has now transformed into a body form with a living soul both masculine and feminine and then further over he takes the woman out of the man chapter 2 verse 21 to 23. verse 21 says on the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked and the man and his wife and they were not ashamed they were different creatures there that's that's the end of verse two we know that going into verse 3 chapter 3 sorry the end of chapter 2 going into chapter 3 is where the curse happens tonight we're not going to get into that maybe down the road Lord willing we will but it was at this place that he he went so from the spirit masculine and feminine creation to the body masculine feminine creation to the actual splitting of the masculine and feminine out of the body man and woman becoming one and the other and we know I'm just going to sort of graze over some of this for those of us who know it but some might not God is the masculine in our world and the church the bride is the feminine when we talk about the bride when we talk about the church she's the feminine and really if you want to see a lot of inspiration for what I'm talking about tonight you can just go and Listen to Invisible Union of the Bride brother Branham talks about Romans how a woman how if she's married to another while her living while her husband yet lives she shall be called an adulteress and tonight I really want to try and talk about that word adultery and how important it is to realize that word adultery that the power that is there in that word not because we want to celebrate it because we don't want it we don't want it we want to make sure that we don't have it at all in our lives in our church in our families no adultery and you know there's the natural we just talked about it the spiritual and then the natural how God created it there's also the spiritual adultery and the natural adultery and neither one is acceptable but there's both but just to look at this scripture in John and the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they said unto him Master this woman was taking an adultery in the very Act if you could just imagine the setting the situation in in the temple here he is teaching the people and now this sinner is brought and thrown right down at his feet and and said you know this this she's worthy of death and how many of us would fit that bill maybe not because of a natural adultery not not in the flesh maybe not but which is worse a physical adultery or a spiritual adultery I ask us tonight which is worse if we mix one word with the word we have committed spiritual fornication brothers and sisters to leave out or to add add in that's what that is we don't want to do that they said unto him Master this woman was taking an adultery in the very Act now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned what saith thou try and put them on the spot but look at his actions here his actions are he just ignored them of course he heard them but he probably was groaning in himself laughing a little bit look at these fools they're coming to do this here they think they're going to trick me they think they're going to trap me here we go I'll can I'll I'll condescend to their level and and and we'll straighten them out and and just a couple words from the master a couple of words from the great Creator the one that we read about rolled all of the worlds off of his palms created everything into existence here he is and these guys are trying to trap him draw them in and trap them just think about how the accuser comes around if that is in front of the word what's it like for us as Believers how does the accuser go before the Brethren day and night trying to bring us down and trap us in adultery before the king saying the law says you should be condemned you should be stoned every one of us this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and just wrote with his finger on the ground as though he heard them not you could imagine what he was writing pardoned pardoned so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that's without sin he's whoever's the Holy One just go for it just cast the first stone you can have at her just do what you need to do and that was all it took one word from the master hey and right after that he stooped down like he didn't care just ignored them and it must have really really really really agitated him the most holy people the most educated people just being dismissed just being totally yeah whatever if you feel inclined you have no sin just go ahead you cast and it's amazing because they had every right to do it too didn't they according to the law but something in the master just like that night they went to get him out of the garden and he asked them who are you looking for and when he said that what did the word say they all fell backwards to the ground at the words of the master and he wasn't condemning them and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst just can't help but think brothers and sisters this is going to be us and you know what it's not going to be it is truly every time we have fellowship with the Lord this is it we come with all these burdens in our heart knowing that we have to cast our poor souls at his feet because of all the accusations and all the sin and all the things that we've done wrong and all the accusers that are dogging us all the Devils that are trying to keep us from praying because we've done this or or we've done that all the terrible lives that we lived as Believers I don't know if you suffer from that but I do I surely do I have the devil on my back all the time telling me like there's no use praying why would you pray what God's it going to do you're a sinner he's not going to hear your prayer you know the word says that his ears are open every time we pray not just sometimes not just when we feel good not just when we look good not just when we do something good but every single time we pray he's listening intently and imagine how intently he's listening for his sons and daughters remember there's five wise and five foolage and and we don't want to throw off on anyone because they're all virgins the only difference is one one group had oil so brother and sister if we have oil in our Labs tonight we've got every single reason to rejoice and have a Revival because we know his ears are open to our prayers but when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned me what happened here the room was full of people that just wanted to kill you and the law says that they should but where are these guys now can you imagine that every time we go on our knees brothers and sisters same same conversation happens can we see that conversation happening I I if I can I just want to try and encourage that one thought that every time we go on our knees that's what he's saying to us where's your accusers there's no accusers it's just you and me here now let's talk and she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more if we could just do that in our lives if we could just do that every time we go to our our knees and pray and remember that it's the devil that accuses it's not God that accuses there's times when we do things wrong in our lives but we just need to make it right that's all we need to do we need to have a humble heart and we need to just go and make it right not not drag it around and pretend that it's all good and it's okay I heard a brother saying this and it was so good if we have a situation in our lives between a husband and a wife if we go and and just pretend if we've offended our wife if we've hurt her with words that we said and and we just pretend that it's just not a problem because we've hurt her what good is it to say I'm sorry if we haven't truly repented to her how much more with our heavenly father who can see our hearts but to think about his his perception where's our accusers goodness talking about adultery I'm just going to start cruising now uh for time's sake in Exodus chapter 20 just to sort of lay a foundation a background now we were reading from the New Testament you don't have to turn there but out of Exodus chapter 20 verse 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery it's it's part of the Ten Commandments it's a very important part but remember there's ten parts to the Commandments it's not just one there's ten this one's the seventh and it's a very important one and it's interesting the way that God uses this in the Bible and and goes weaves in and out of spiritual adultery and natural adultery through the entire Bible and the prophet picks it up and talks about it very clearly that way as well in Leviticus chapter 20 verse 10 and the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife even he that committeth adultery with this neighbor's wife the adulterer and the adulteress shall be surely put to death talking about our scripture just setting a background for it they should be put to death those people were completely justified in their behavior before Jesus there that's the law Proverbs chapter 6. verse 32 but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul a wound and dishonor shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away for jealousy is the Rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of Vengeance he will not regard any Ransom neither will he rest content though thou give us many gifts think about how we just read those scriptures and let's not talk about natural adultery let's talk about spiritual adultery that's really what I want to talk about tonight because when we get into spiritual adultery it is death to a person we can be the most religious people but if we mix something with this and say that it's our tradition we've done it this way it's just what we believe it's what we've been taught it's adultery brothers and sisters it's not going to work we can't take the message and mix anything with it he is espoused to one wife to one wife and you know really where this is going if we talk about spiritual fornication let's let's just break it right down here now for a second where is the truth for our day there's one one way one truth and one life that's the Lord Jesus Christ through his Vindicated Prophet the message of the hour that's the truth for our day so if we want to take the message of the hour and try and interpret it try and do it our own way brothers and sisters what we're doing is committing spiritual fornication we're committing adultery we don't want to do that but I mean we can talk about it for a second I hope I've heard it said that and I didn't realize it this way but it's interesting in the Old Testament there was a time where they began to set up Groves and high places and and have hireling preachers and the Groves and the high places were there places of worship at home for the idols that they created they no longer took their their sacrifice to the temple they no longer went and and operated according to the methods that we talked about in the temple and how sacred the the office of the temple was and and all of the things that needed to be executed in the temple people started to create Groves plant trees and create a private space where they could go and worship the way that they want to almost like the the days of the judges where the people just did what was right in their own sight but what happened when the people of God raised up when there was a king that raised up maybe the son of a king that raised up of the Old Testament and he walked after the ways of God and he didn't walk after the ways of his father what he would do one of the first things he would do is go and smash the Groves and cut down the high places maybe I said that backwards cut down the high places and smashed the Groves and get rid of all the idols get rid of all of the adultery that's going on in the land we don't want to have any of that in our lives brothers and sisters we talked about it a little bit adultery in our lives can be idolatry having something in our life that's just as equal as God is in our life there's nothing equal to God in our lives and if there is we need to be careful we need to check it yes but in Proverbs it says that he will not regard any Ransom neither will he rest content though he gives it give us many gifts to commit that that spiritual fornication adultery is is Unforgivable it's the one thing that God will not tolerate in in our lives in the Old Testament you know the prophets talked about it Jeremiah read the book of Jeremiah he talks about it whoredom and adultery spiritually speaking the way they worshiped Ezekiel Jose they they all cried out against it they were speaking they were the Lord's mouthpiece for their age crying out for it and you know what's no different for brother Branham when you hear him talk about this he cried out about it Israel and Judah both getting mixed up with other gods beginning to mix their own ideas with the truth for their day God didn't call it heirs or sin he called it adultery that's a heavy statement and you know the word it's having an intimate relationship with someone other than your spouse when you're married to someone you make a commitment to them when you get saved and you make a commitment to God we make a commitment to God and we give our lives to God and and we're espoused to him but then there comes a time where potentially we mix something else in there with it we take it and mix it in maybe it's a little bit of psychology maybe somebody gave us something that sounded really good at a time and we mix it in I say Lord help us because it floats around it's all over the place we need to make sure that what we believe checks with the word and that's why we were talking about church order not because we need to do things differently here because we need to understand why we do things the way we do and to be careful to be vigilant to not let anything else creep in we can we can have things creep in very easily the Devil comes to church but we don't want to commit adultery spiritual adultery in second Corinthians 11. verse 2 for I am jealous over you with The Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband if you just this is just so amazing that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ end of a new year but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ we don't want to try and make Christ the doctrine of Jesus Christ anything more than what it is it's not complicated it's come according to the word for our day and watch him bless us mightily in the message why Christ speak and the church is organized and all them gathered together as harlots to the and everything exactly in the way of whoredom whoredom what is that telling women they can cut their hair telling women they can wear shorts telling men they can do this they can do that and this is where it gets right personal for me but I'm reading it he says and a preacher saying do this and the social gospel and things don't you see it's committing adultery with the true word of God and God has sent us his true word undenominational no strings tied to it and give us a pillar of fire and the Holy Ghost that's been with us now for he says 30 years but I would think it's probably like 60 years somewhere in there and everything that he's predicted and said come to pass exactly the way he said it talking about our day brothers and sisters we don't want to mix anything with the word in Matthew chapter 5. ye have heard that it was set by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whomsoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart now this brothers and sisters might be a place where we sort of pause and and just talk about this for a little bit because when has there ever been a time with so much visualization in this world we don't know what there was in the days of Noah and brother Branham said that there was technology that was beyond ours they could build the pyramids and so on but talking about this scripture here you know brother Branham he really spells it out really brings it out so good it's not good but he makes it clear which is a good thing is what I mean that's what I'm trying to express it's good that we have such Clarity for it and and in that a man that looks on a woman to lust after her in his heart has already committed adultery just because he's looked on her but brother Branham says why does the man look on her because she presents herself that way and you know the woman that presents herself that way brother Branham says this that she has a lust Spirit upon her and she doesn't even know it and to think about all of the stuff that we see in this world it's impossible for us to not see things men and women but I'm going to pause and speak to the men for a little while here I say unto you that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart when has there ever been an age like this one brothers and sisters and we're going to drill down a little bit and I pray that we don't get uncomfortable and I I I I beg further conversation about this the internet it can be a dangerous place in light of this scripture I don't know how many people have experienced it but you can make one wrong click on the internet and you see things that you don't want to see and we're gonna we're gonna drill down a little bit here if we spend a little time the internet can be a very dangerous place and you know as I was I was meditating on this today if we talk about a pandemic and what is a pandemic brothers and sisters and we have a real clear top of Mind understanding and description of a pandemic we're in the midst of one and every single person here is a representation of it because there's so few people and the EP only people that are here are wearing a mask because of that word pandemic it's caused an action to take place in this world the entire world because of a pandemic a pandemic the definition of a disease prevalent over a whole country or the world brothers and sisters if there is a pandemic for covid then what is there for pornography and you know what I'm going to call that Spirit out tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because I know that Spirit has made itself a home in people's lives right here in Calgary and you know what brothers and sisters if I said that I haven't been affected by it in my lifetime I would be a liar and I'm not going to be a liar and I'm not going to be a hypocrite I am going to say that there is a delivering power in the name of Jesus Christ and we don't have to tolerate the spirit of pornography in our lives and brothers and sisters if I have one message to give out tonight if there's someone that has a problem with it what does the word say it doesn't say go and isolate yourself and pretend that you're the only person that has a problem it says confess your faults one to another reach out for help don't hide let's draw closer together brothers and sisters I'm not going to say that I have a problem with it now but I can tell you that the time in my life I did have a problem with it and I'm not I'm not boasting that I had a problem I'm boasting that there is a delivering power in the name of Jesus Christ we don't have to tolerate it and you know brothers and sisters from what I've seen in my life just my own experience that's the only thing I can talk about and say with with with a real conviction in my heart is that when you experience something you just know that it happens you know that there is a way out once you've experienced it but when you're in the midst of it you can feel like you're drowning you can feel like there's no Escape you feel like if you talk to anyone about it you'll be shunned you'll be kicked out of the church you won't be loved your family won't love you your spouse will divorce you speaking about this very specific thing brothers and sisters we don't have to give it any power we can destroy it brother Branham says that an exposed Devil is a defeated devil if you've got trouble if it's afflicting you Reach Out seek help don't try and live it on your own don't don't don't just pretend that it's just gonna go away one day because it won't we need each other brothers and sisters we're dealing with a pandemic and you know it's one thing to see all of the treatment that's out there for this this pandemic of covet that that kills some people and some people don't even know they have it it's just up and down and all around but what's going on for this this one topic of pornography when I was growing up in the Pentecostal church it was a it was it was a really quiet discussion nobody wanted to talk about it and I'm not I'm not going to start going off parents relax I'm not going to go off in in a strange direction we're in a mixed audience it's as far as I'm going to go that way but what I am saying is it's not something that we want to shy away from parents we have got to educate our children we have got to make sure they're hearing about this topic from us because they're going to hear about it somewhere what this does in the life of a human being is is you can look the research up if you're into it I'm not recommending that you just go and do a bunch of research on it if you're not affected by it then God bless you it's wonderful if you are affected then God bless you there's treatment you can be helped and you can be helped in and around the message there is a way to be helped but what it does is it causes a cycle of iniquity in people's hearts even the unbelievers they don't even realize that what they do is they they start to Hunger for More and what they do to feed that hunger is they just go and and do whatever they do and brothers and sisters when we get into this cycle it just cripples our spiritual walk it cripples us we're on a cycle like a hamster wheel like we'll never be able to get off one day we're up praise the Lord I'm saved and I feel it and it's all good and then next day comes around and something happens and before long you're feeling like you just failed and God doesn't want to hear your prayer because you failed and and you feel like you've just committed spiritual adultery and you know there's a way out there's a way to be helped we don't have to tolerate that we don't have to tolerate sickness we don't have to tolerate mental problems we don't have to tolerate this cycle of iniquity in people's hearts what we need to do is get behind the Waters of separation and let the word wash Us by the washing of the water of the word just thinking about all the time and the resources poured into treating covet though and and there's there's a greater pandemic going on in this world and it's causing people to just become crazy they don't even know it they're completely veiled by a lust bail and you know brother Branham talks about it in the Garden of Eden how Adam and Eve they were veiled by a spiritual Veil by a Godly Veil and that's how they didn't know they were naked but once the curse happened that's when that veil was taken off and that's when they became ashamed and that's when they clothed themselves with what brother Branham says religion the world says fig leaves brother Branham says religion isn't that amazing so right back there it turns into spiritual adultery right there even though it was a natural typing the spiritual we don't have to tolerate it brothers and sisters Satan tries to divide and conquer and he's taught man to do that we don't have to do that brothers and sisters it's what happens how many was here when brother Dale Smith preached a snake bit and dog it was in the upper room I know not many were here for the Dale Smith a good brother he was here not long ago actually but he preached a sermon about a snake bitten dog and really what it was was how someone could actually get a dog can they can have a dog that's their best friend man's best friend just loves them comes every single time he calls them best of friends but he goes and he gets bitten by a snake and he starts to get poisoned by that snake that venom goes through the dog and he starts to foam at the mouth and he was relating that to a person that has something that happens to them in their lives and he wasn't calling brothers and sisters dogs but what he is relating it to was how the reactive behavior is when that poison starts to flow through a a person to someone who is actually spiritually endowed it stops the power of God and what they do is they they start to pull away and a dog that's been snake bitten won't come to you he doesn't want to come to you one minute he's your best friend the next minute he snake bit and he's poisoned and he doesn't want to come around that's what the devil does he gets us to a place where we just maybe stop coming to church as much maybe we stop fellowshipping with our brothers and our sisters as much maybe our relationship starts to just become a little bit cool in our marriage maybe maybe um whatever it is we just start to have a difference in behavior and we don't have to have that the word in James 5 says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another how can we properly pray for one another if we don't confess our faults I can say God bless brother Toby help him in his ways but if I don't know what he's struggling with how can I actually draw my sword and put it to the throat of the devil that's attacking my brother confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a veileth much think about that brothers and sisters if we know what's going on in each other's lives we're not afraid to talk to one another and say I've got this thing and and I just don't feel like I know what to do with it will you just go on your knees with me and pray and not suffer in silence imagine the power of that brother to brother sister to sister and then to be able to have the honest conversation brother how are you doing and to be able to answer back honestly we're humans we're dealing with devils and they think they're going to win brothers and sisters they are not going to give up think about the animals how smart they are what do they do when they're being attacked they Tighten Up In The Herd they draw closer together and they put the weakest ones in the middle do we do that as Sons and Daughters of God or do we just say you know hey I'm saved I'm I'm a Son of God and they're a Son of God and we've got Sons and Daughters of God and we're super strong we're super strength and we are but are we applying the word the way it says to apply it we can't live our lives and think that we're going to get an Apostolic blessing in an Apostolic age if we don't apply the word the way the apostolic blessing comes just talking about adultery here in a visible Union of the Bride how can we strain at the natural because it's so tangible right the Holy Ghost is using this illustration to show the church something she has this sacred Womanhood no wonder that men act around women the way they do it's because women act around men the way they do she characters herself out here with a pair of shorts on and skin tight and men's clothing and things out on the street twisting around now I'm not talking about our sisters here just for the record I just feel that I'm not talking about our sisters here I'm just quoting what the prophet said about the world around us no matter what she says she might be as virtuous to her husband as she can be but in the sight of God she is adulterous whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart and she presented herself to be that and that's exactly what the church has done with the world that's what we're talking about here the the natural and and and the spiritual how can a preacher go out here to a seminary and look at Acts 2 38 and it sees there's not a person in the Bible ever baptized in those titles and then still say he's pregnant with the word of God what does the prophet say here he's telling you a lie he sold his birthrights he's committed adultery against the very thing that he said he's put away in divorce I heard something astounding this week trinitarianism I didn't realize it was so important I mean I know it's important if you don't actually come according to the word you're you're not going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you might get a a spiritual anointing you might get a physical anointing you might get both of those but you might not get it on your soul that token might not be where it's supposed to be but trinitarianism you can look up that word in the message brother Branham talks about it in Revelations chapter 4 part 3. he says now my precious brother I know this is a tape also now don't get excited let me say this with Godly love the hour has approached where I can't hold still on these things no more too close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil and he says I say that thus saith the Lord I didn't realize that it was that prominent look where it come from it come from the Nicene Council when the Catholic Church became in rulership the word Trinity is not ever mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three Gods that's from hell there's one God that's exactly right remember that one God he's a jealous God like I said earlier I believe that there is a lot of avenues that we're going to explore with this I just wanted to hit on this one thing tonight and and sort of set a stage and we'll just see where things go we're not done yet just for the record I should say I'm I'm I'm closing we have 15 minutes he says there's one God that's exactly right in Ephesians chapter five now we're going to go back to the Natural submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body the husband is the savior of the family the husband is the savior of the home it's not a pastor's job to be the savior of a home it's not a pastor's job to be the savior of the family it's not the prophet's job to do that that's the father's job the father is the head of the home for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now just for the record this isn't talking about making your wife a doormat this isn't talking about a wife being a Slave this is talking just just I'll put it in in in in in Barry's lingo this is talking about a husband being in his spiritual position and when he's in his spiritual possession then the wife is going to have a submission to her husband who is in her his spiritual position it's going to cause everyone to fall in their place and if there's a problem in the home it's not what the child necessarily and it's not with the wife necessarily husbands take a look at yourselves we need to research our own lives and say am I right with the Lord do I have iniquity in my life again I can preach this because I've experienced it get your life right and watch everything change in your life get your life out of order I don't know if anyone else has experienced this husbands if you get your life out of order however you do I'm not pointing at anything in particular but get outside of the word for just a little bit and watch I've seen in my house my house goes upside down the kids start going crazy the wife gets upset before I know it I want to leave the house because I'm thinking what's going on what's the big problem and then I get out the door thinking man those people are crazy and the Lord says to me but what did you do why is it that way let's have a talk come son let's let's have a conversation the grace of our loving father to give us the opportunity to see that in our lives to have him speak to us and show us that not through me I'm just saying myself and my own experience here what a tremendous blessing it is husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave it gave himself for it that he might sanctify it I love this that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish if we can get ourselves into this order brothers and sisters just get rid of all the iniquity in our lives not have any stumbling blocks and if we do just call someone confess your faults one to another and pray for one another so that you may be healed there is a bomb in Gilead he says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones that day on Calvary that's when the bride the feminine part was taken out of him that's when the rib came out of Jesus Christ came out of the Lord God Almighty that's why how on Earth if that wasn't God that died on Calvary how could we even be the bride we'd be espoused to Jesus as a third person some other guy it's total adultery for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery he says but I speak concerning Christ in the church he's using a natural example right out of Genesis that we read but he's using it as an example for the church this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless that every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverends her husband James 5. is any money any among you afflicted is anybody afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing songs Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if we have committed sins they shall be forgiven him they'll be forgiven not even because we did anything just because we came according to the word we came and were Anointed with oil and and just brought it before the church to be the Elders of the church to just have the blessing of God in our lives he goes on to say confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth for a space of three years and six months he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit I'm going to pause there for a second brothers and sisters the Lord show me something with this this afternoon and that is I always wondered about this scripture because Elias he's he's the prophet right Elijah he's got the the prophetic gift he's in an office he's got the power to pray what he's saying here he's a man of like passion and if he can pray that prayer and see a result for his prayer so can you we can pray and see results for our prayers that's what that scripture saying to us it's not putting it off onto someone else it's taking it and putting it into our own laps and it's up to us to do what we want with it and he prayed again and the heaven gave up rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit Brethren if any of you do air from the truth and one convert him if someone's hurting inside if someone is dying inside and he has the strength to reach out and help and you have the ability to say to him brother it's okay let's pray together let's see the spirit of God come back upon you let's get rid of this devil that's cast him out in the name of Jesus Christ Brethren if any of you do air from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the air of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sin we have the ability to do that brothers and sisters for each other for our families for people that we don't even know we live in a world where this world is hurting and the world is taught to be strong and just take it on the chin be a man be a woman be independent but that's not what the word says remember my strength is made perfect where we don't need to be strong brothers and sisters we need to be right with God and if we're right with God then Satan won't even know what to do with us and we've even read it that Satan he won't even be able to find us because we'll be so far back in the word will be gone let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the air of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins remember when Jesus lifted himself up and he saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are thine accusers and I want to say that tonight brothers and sisters after knowing the message of the hour after knowing that we don't have to tolerate devils in our lives we don't have to tolerate sin all of the afflictions that come around our ways we know that that all the thoughts that come to us they're not our thoughts they're God's thoughts and they're Satan's thoughts and they're God's thoughts and their Satan's thoughts and the word of God says to take every single thought into captivity and run it through the filter of the word and if it jives with the word then let it in and accept it but if it doesn't then dismiss it get rid of it it's like having the double barrel shotgun the old and the New Testament and when those birds fly over they're going to try and Roost in the tree and we have the opportunity to just let them start bringing sticks and building a nest and get a nest that's so big we've got to cut half the tree off to get rid of the nest or when we see that bird there we can just squeeze the trigger and get rid of them woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee can we look around in our lives and say no man Lord no devil lord no devil lord and hear him say to us neither do I condemn thee [Music] go and sin no more brothers and sisters I maybe stand with me tonight as we truly do close remember the prophet for our day before this quote he said it's as though you never did it in the first place out of invisible Union of the Bride the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely now he's not saying it's not like you never did it the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sinned in the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it woman where are those thine accusers does anyone accuse you when we go and stand before the Lord Jesus Christ and we apply the word imagine what it's like brothers and sisters to live with no condemnation in our lives that when we pray it's not us praying it's God actually speaking through us that's what we're talking about that's where it's omnipotence that's where it's divine favor when we speak he speaks adoption brothers and sisters the message of the hour Christ and flesh the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ the unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled all of that living out through us it is the rising of the sun it's that quickening power in our lives the anointing knowing that there's no condemnation there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after this flesh but live in the spirit the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sinned in the first place you're a son and daughter of God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or daughter of God the prophet for our day telling us this brothers and sisters you're standing there washed in your old book of divorcement it's put away and is dead absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of God think about that how we go and pray oh my sounding brass and tinkling symbol prayers Lord help me help me help me help me help me help me what about just saying this is what the prophet said and I just believe it so that's got to settle it that's God speaking through the prophet to his children if you could just if we could just have ears to hear what the spirit's saying to the church think about the power that's there for us to overcome [Music] you are The Virtuous bride of Christ spouse to one husband you are The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with the pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested all right I just I could just read this whole quote on I could just keep going on and on and on with it he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning a sinless son of God a sinless daughter of God no matter what we've done on this Earth what we deal with in terms of accusations in our lives brothers and sisters for those people who might be tuned in or might have something here all of these things that the accuser brings Before the Throne they're all attributes of something and it's this old nature but when we've been converted what is your desire do you still desire to do that stuff do you still desire to go that way you don't so when the Devil comes around and tells you because you have these attributes these things that are being accused Before the Throne they're all lies because you believe we just haven't had the ability to maybe go all the way we don't want to let the devil lie to us I know in my life I let the devil lie to me way too many times for way too long but what we need to do is just simply speak the word to the devil just like Jesus defeated the devil we need to do it if we can recognize that Antichrist Spirit brothers and sisters creeping into our lives Satan will be powerless before us [Music] he's not only coming for a pure unadulterated bride what the prophet is saying in this quote here is that you are the pure unadulterated bride you never did it in the first place if you have the ability to hear the message of the hour to recognize your position in Christ Satan has no power over you no matter how Temptation comes your way no matter how much Temptation we get in our lives it doesn't change the fact that he already sees us as Sons and Daughters of God that he has already washed us with those Waters of Separation to be his virtuous bride never did it in the first place let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just love you and we thank you and we bless your name father we know that there's nothing that we could bring on our own before your throne of mercy and Grace the only thing that we could bring is your righteousness father and out of true humility in our hearts father to recognize that there's nothing we could ever do to Merit that in your kingdom it's what you did for us father from before the foundation of the world you didn't just do it someday in our lives when we just came stumbling into the church somebody didn't just tell us about you and we suddenly became a son or daughter of God you you made us a son or a daughter before the foundation of the world and we just recognized that that's what you made us what a tremendous blessing it is Father Lord we just love you and we thank you and we just give you all the praise of Our Lives Lord Jesus help us to go forward with just a conviction in our heart Lord just a confidence in our heart Lord Jesus knowing that if any of us has anything in our lives there's an appropriate way that we can deal with it and and and put Satan back under our feet again we don't have to be badgered by sin we don't have to be badgered by the devil we can overcome your word says that we are more than conquerors father we pray that you would just be glorified in our lives Lord Jesus help each one of us father to keep you first Lord let there be no idolatry in our lives Lord if there is Lord I pray that you would just show us in such a way that it's undeniable father and then when we have that opportunity to see it give us the strength and courage to cut down the Groves Lord to smash the idols to tear down the high places and to put you first once again in our lives Lord that we might see that that Apostolic blessing father we just love you and we thank you we pray that you would just be with those father who are already in perfect strength maybe there's those fathers that don't contend with the things that we talked about tonight father and and that's very real and we pray that you would just strengthen and encourage them Lord Jesus give them the ability to continue on in their lives Lord with the great assurance that Blessed Assurance knowing that you are theirs already father we just love you and we thank you and we bless your name tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound every time we hear the word it's just Amazing Grace over
