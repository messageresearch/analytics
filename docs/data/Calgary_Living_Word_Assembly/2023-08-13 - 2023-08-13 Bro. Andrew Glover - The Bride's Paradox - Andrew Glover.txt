the Believers dwell how many believers do we have here tonight amen I believe he's here won't we just spy our hearts together is they just play that softly and maybe you have something on your heart

brother Barry to be here and to fellowship with you all this weekend and many of you were meeting for the first time and we see a few familiar faces so we want to say God bless you all and sure enjoy the time the fellowship this morning and the breakfast with the brothers and amen any Goods used to be a Christian amen into fellowship with God's people and amen we want to bring you greetings tonight from our pastor brother Sean Martin the Saints Faith Tabernacle send their greetings to you this evening and if you have your Bibles we want to turn in the Book of John the 14th chapter and in this ear monitor there's I'm not this microphone's not in it if we could put this microphone in it would be great amen The Book of John the 14th chapter and we want to look in the 12th verse of John 14. um for those of you that don't know me I'm brother Andrew Glover I don't have any strange doctrines I've just got the message so somebody told me one time said well all you God's the culture brother Branham I said that's all I need amen it's the Vindicated word of the hour amen and I believe it's going to address a bride for a Rapture amen amen The Book of John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse I know it's a very familiar reading to you in John 14 12 Jesus you're speaking he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me The Works that I do shall he do also brother Brahman said that's the head speaking to the body and Greater Works in this shall he do because I go unto my father now we know brother Brahman said Greater Works not in quality but in quantity he said he stopped nature raised the dead healed the sick said nothing greater could be done there would just be more of it the 13th verse and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I love the authority of these next few words I will do it if you ask anything in my name I will do it now in the book of Hebrews 11 and verse 1. I know it's a very a familiar reading to you tonight Hebrews 11 and we want to look in the first verse um Hebrews 11 and verse number one Hebrews 11 and verse 1. Paul here writing he says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it so by faith for by faith the elders obtained a good report so by faith they obtained a good report now watch what he says here and through faith we understand so by faith and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to reading of his word is you can have your seats here uh amen we'll get it straightened out here in just a minute amen praise the Lord It's Working amen amen we want to tonight by the help of the Lord I tell you when we get to heaven there'll be no microphones amen I thank brother brother Daryl Ward said the other day he said everywhere I go he said I have microphone trouble and he said if I get to heaven and they hand me a microphone I'll know I didn't make it so uh but we we thank the Lord for for allowing these things to work out here tonight amen uh from those scriptures I want to tonight just a simple thought here on my heart but if I would title this tonight I want to speak to you for a few moments here on the thought of the bride's Paradox uh the bride's Paradox you know brother Branham preaches the message and I know you're very familiar with it he preaches the message about six different times and he calls it a paradox and I just want to maybe open up here tonight and make this declaration of faith and I believe amen that we are living in a season of paradox how many would agree with me we're living in a season of paradox now when brother Brandon preaches this he said it like this he said now according to Webster he said the Paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true he said therefore a paradox then would be the the same as a miracle he said a paradox is when something that seems like it just couldn't be the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true so a paradox is something that is incredible but it's true he said it's something that seems like it just couldn't be amen the knowledge of the human mind but it's incredible but yet it's proven true he said now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle amen cannot be explained so when Birdman says a paradox we could easily say a miracle he said a miracle is something that happens that you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox amen it's incredible but yet it's the truth it's incredible but yet it's the truth he said now people today a lot of modernists believe that the days of Miracle surpassed they don't even believe in such a thing as a miracle he said but yet I believe that the world is full of Miracles how many agree said with brother Brown that the world is full of Miracles he said I believe amen that the Paradox is constantly so as we said another word for Paradox is a miracle and the prophet of God said I believe that Paradox is constantly I believe that Paradox is continually now when you look through the Bible the scripture actually records about 45 miracles of Christ that he performed amen throughout the New Testament and I I believe it like this I've heard it said before amen that we we shall see Miracles we've all heard that I even believe it's a song that we shall see Miracles but I happen to believe amen that we have seen Miracles amen we are seeing Miracles and we shall see Miracles I I don't believe that we're just we're just looking at past Miracles or looking for future Miracles amen but I believe that Miracles are actually sitting here tonight amen because brother man said anything outside of the ordinary that's a miracle anything outside of the ordinary is a miracle now you say ordinary well we're living in a day and time where anything amen ordinary is normally not going to be the things of God and anything extraordinary or out of the ordinary amen is the things that God recognizes now when you think of this you realize in this generation it's not ordinary Amen to believe that God sent a prophet but actually you're sitting here tonight amen believing that God fulfilled his word amen by sending Malachi 4 so that actually amen is a miracle it's something amen that's out of the ordinary but it's it's incredible but it's true now when you when you look at this but remember said the world is full of paradox he said it like this one place he said the Earth itself is a paradox Hebrews 11 3 said through faith we understand amen that the worlds were framed by the word of God Amen so they're the things which are seen were not made of things which to appear remember I said this very Earth that we're sitting is a paradox what is it amen it's the word of God made manifest see he made it without anything to make it out of only thing he had amen was his word so the only thing he had Amen to make this world was his word and he said and his word is a creation in itself his word is a creation in itself when it once it spoke it could never return again until it is accomplished that which it's been purpose for he said oh doctor I'm beginning to feel religious his word amen cannot return until it is accomplished that which it has been spoken for now God he said is waiting this afternoon on a people amen that'll take a hold of that word and hold on to it until it's accomplished what it is purpose for so amen the word of God with the Bible says he sent his word and he healed the people so when God sends his word amen his word will not return unto him void but it will accomplish that when he sent it for to do if he sends his word to heal it's going to heal if he sends his word to deliver it's going to deliver if he sends his word to save it's going to save if he sent his word amen to perform a miracle that's going to perform a miracle because whatever God sends his word for amen it's going to do that and his word is not going to return unto him void now when you think about that I love how he says that the word itself is creative how many believes amen that we are actually under the power of a creative word we're actually sitting here tonight amen under the power of a creative word but like this he said every man and woman in here has everlasting life amen by the creative word of God who spoke things into existence another place he says in the beginning was the word and the word spoken was a creative word and every word that's spoken cannot be taken back for a mistake so when God speaks his word there's no there's no possibility of God taking his word back and saying well I made a mistake when I said this or I made a mistake when I said that amen but his word will accomplish that which he sent it for to do he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us which is Christ now the word of God written in the Bible is his word to us so amen it's not just in general amen but this word is a specific word this word amen is a it's a direct word and it's not just to anybody amen but it's a love letter to his bride he said and every promise has the same power amen of creation behind it that God's word did at the beginning if we believe it to be the word of God see it depends on where this seed Falls if it falls into ground a ground that can create a moisture a nourishment around the promise of God it'll bring forth the promise the Bible made he said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you'll just look at it and take care of the word amen because the infinite God spoke it it's God's word amen so the beautiful thing about this is its creative word amen and is falling into creative ground and there is a creative power behind it listen friends amen the prophet of God tells you that you were born amen with a gene seed in your soul he said you were prepared ground from before amen the foundation of the world when you came into this age you was prepared for one purpose and that purpose was to receive him in the age that you're living listen amen if you were living in Luther's day you would have received Luther's message if you were living in Wesley's day or Pentecost day you would receive those messages but guess what you're not in those days you are in this day amen and this is the bride's day so God is not sending amen just a message of justification he's not just sending a message of sanctification come on he's not even just sending a message of the restoration that gives amen that he's sending a restoration message which is restoring the whole word amen to put you in position to perform a miracle you say brother Andrew what is that Miracle going to be it's not going to be walking on water it's not going to be raising the dead so much it's going to be some morning amen between six and nine your bodies are going to be changed listen this word is not a powerless word amen it's not a helpless word this is a powerful word it's a creative word it's an authoritative word and the only thing this word needs is not your education it does not need your ability it does not need your understanding this word needs your body Amen to manifest itself through amen it's the creative word of God falling into creative ground and Jesus said abide in me and my words in you then ask what you will and it shall be given to you he said where is the church standing at amen let me ask you tonight friends where is the church standing at he said Moses said let there be frogs and there wasn't a frog Amen in the country but in an hour's time amen there were about foot deep in places he said what was it God the Creator amen was hiding himself in a simple man he said I want to ask you something if the blood of a bull or a goat be used for a bleach which can only cover amen could put a man in position to speak amen the creative word of God bring flies into existence he said then why would you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ amen could speak a squirrel or something into existence listen amen people amen you going to church and tell them that Moses spoke and there were flies and then there weren't amen there was blood and then there wasn't amen they'll shout right with you amen but tell them that in this age amen a man was hat in the woods honey and needed squirrels and spoke and squirrels come into existence amen and they'll call you crazy you know why amen because they're not prepared ground to receive the creative word in the age that we're living but this bride amen has the ability to receive amen whatever God sends her amen he sent her Seven Seals and she received it amen he sent her the third pool and she received it amen he centered the pro amen the Spoken Word by creation power and she received it he said don't stumble over Simplicity amen believe that he still remains God hey man how many here tonight believes that He Still Remains God see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart amen but believe what you said will come to pass amen you can have what you're saying now now sometimes people are getting their mind they meant to see a miracle we got to have a lot of people but a prophet changed that and said it only takes one believe her to see a paradox amen the only thing God's waiting on is to get one man not an organization amen not denomination one man he can wrap his Spirit into amen that he'll take the rest amen and there will be another Paradox listen if I didn't have the words of William Branham I could not preach to you tonight the bride's Paradox because as far as I could go amen was Moses Paradox and John's Paradox and Paul's Paradox amen but a prophet said if the same God that God in them amen gets in the church today there will be another Paradox he said until he can get someone come completely surrendered amen that's the way God does his work amen he used his paradoxes amen God looking for somebody amen who is completely surrendered and through that surrendered vessel he will perform another Paradox remember said see what we're either surrendered to amen Israel surrendered to God or we're surrendered to the devil you realize that amen every person in here tonight you're not your own person I don't care how much you think you are you're not your own person you're either surrendered to God or your surrender to the devil remember I said the maniac and gadaro is just so mean till he was cutting himself with rocks amen they'd binding with chains he'd break them he said now that's the devil's power did you ever fool around with somebody that was a maniac somebody with double their power it was Satan IC and will give them twice their strength amen now if a person is completely surrendered to the devil we'll give him twice his strength he said then what will a man completely surrender to God Amen it'll make you so weak maybe you're crippled and you cannot stand up amen but surrender yourself to God and new life and new strength comes in and you'll go to walking away listen friends amen up Shaw sit there for 66 years it was not William Branham that brought him out of the wheelchair amen it was a paradox amen that God got into a man amen and he surrendered himself to believe amen this Supernatural manifestation and when he surrendered himself to it it released his strength in him listen friends I don't know about you but I think we've been sitting on the premises long enough I think it's time to stand on the Promises amen and the only way we can stand on the Promises is if a supernatural strength will come into the church and will release you from the infirmity we'll release you from the disease where release you from the complex listen I believe my God is still in the releasing business I believe he can still release the young he can still release the old he can still heal the he can still raise the dead because he remains to be kind he's just looking for somebody to believe that he's still God and His word is true and his power is here it don't take a hundred it takes one it don't take a thousand it takes one one person completely surrendered to God with the anointing of God upon them amen you'll get up and walk amen you'll believe again you'll worship again you'll Rejoice again because it's not you it's the god of paradox oh Hallelujah my God is not dead he's a miracle worker he's a soul saver he's a home restorer he's a church Revival Giver he's Jesus Christ and he remains to be the high and the Mighty God oh you're superlander it's impossible not if Jehovah's in the midst because brother remember said Jehovah is the god of Miracles that's what we're under tonight we're under Revelation that Jehovah of the old is the Jesus Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new then can I tell you where our strength comes from don't get him mad but our strengths don't come from the music our strengths don't come from the personality of a Preacher amen our strength comes from Jehovah how are you still sitting here tonight it's because the strength of Jehovah has become your strength how are you still believing this word because it's not you believe in it it's somebody on the inside of you amen that's stronger and mightier and more powerful than you amen remember said it's God believing his word through you love what Isaiah said he said behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength he is my song and he has also become my salvation he said trust you in the Lord forever amen for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength well I'm just going to preach because I feel like I can amen you know what I want to say we're stronger now than we've ever been we're stronger now than we've ever been I know we got more problems but we got more shrinks we got more situations but we got more strength we got more against us but we got more strength and I want to say what the Bible said if God be for us then who can be against us if God is with us if God is in us if he is anointing us then there's no devil too big there's no mountain too high there's no trial too long but what this bride will persevere through because she's completely Anointed with the strength of Jehovah oh god Jehovah is our strength Jehovah is the god of paradox you say but Andrew what makes a paradox but remember said when somebody believes God and takes him at his word when somebody believes God and takes him at his word that's what makes a paradox now how many will agree with me that God's word is the truth and you know what the prophet said he said truth is Stranger Than Fiction think about that truth is Stranger Than Fiction he said like somebody told me one time that William Tell amen shot an apple off of his boy's head he said it never even happened he said but people believe that he said to prove that fiction amen sounds more real than truth I love this one he says I was over in France one time he said I was touring around I was up on a hill and he said when he got up on this hill they said now don't say nothing he said well why can't I talk they said well because this is a it's kind of like a uh uh how would I said a reverent place he said there was a man a hundred years ago supposed to be a saint got in the fight now listen to this he got in the fight down there somehow got his head cut off so he just decided he didn't want to die there a man gets in a fight gets his head cut off and then decides he don't want to die there so he just picks up his head puts it under his arm walks five miles up the hill and died and they built Church Reverend said you expect people to believe says Tommy right is that I said that's only by faith isn't it he said I want to tell you right now amen my faith is too weak for that now here's what I love about this amen as a prophet said my faith is too weak to believe that fiction now you realize the world we're living in actually will accept fiction and they will reject Vindicated truth they will accept that William Tell shot an apple off of this boy's head and they'll deny that a cloud appeared over a prophet's credit crib amen they will believe that a man had his head cut off packed it five miles up the hill and they'll denounce it that seven angels met a prophet and revealed to him his commission and sent him back East to open the word they will accept Tommy Rod amen and reject Vindicated truth now you know why they'll do that because it's an evil world and it's seasoned with fiction but I want to say this we are Sanctified by the god of righteousness can I say this young people we are in the world but we're not of the world we're in laodicea but we're not of laodicea program said look it's a paradox now in John 17 verse 15 Jesus actually prayed over you and said I pray that thou shouldest take them out of the world Amen but thou shouldest keep them from the evil so they would be in the world the bride would be in the world but she would not be a part of the world see they are not of the world even as I am not of the world see sanctify them through the truth I want this sanctify do it sets you aside it cleans you up sanctify them through the truth amen for Thy word is truth now I want to read you something here from the church age book the prophet of God said here is most evidently set forth at the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works somebody say that with me word and works so we have the word and we have the works he said that is exactly what we have been teaching all along then when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced I've met people and they'll say like this brother Mary we're a word church we're just a word church we ain't in all those Works we're just a word church then I preached in churches and they we're on in that word we ain't in all that revelation we just want to see the works but here's the funny thing you can't have the word and not have the works and you won't have the works without having the word they're Inseparable they're the same thing see the word is God the spirit is God they are all one they cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that's how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them he said now Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him he said now watch he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb speaking of John when he was baptizing in Jordan the word of God Jesus came to him see the word always comes to the truly Spirit field that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said I will pray the father he will send you another comforter he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive he said now we know what truth is he said Thy word is truth amen John John 8 43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did you notice that Jesus said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost you are in the world but you're not of the world and the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost amen neither could they receive the word because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets amen the word would come to you amen and you would receive it see John 14 26 he said here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of God now somebody asked me one time amen where do you find this well it's in John 16 13 gives us a beautiful commentary of that one scripture he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth he stops and says word is come he will guide you into all truth he stops and says Thy word is truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear he stops and says the word of God that shall he speak he says word and he will show you things to come he said the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy let me say this to you you're not just church members you're not just citizens of Canada amen you're a prophetic class of people that's why this message had to come to you because the spirit brings the word of Prophecy see I want you to catch this he never said the evidence would be that you danced or spoke in tongues or prophesied amen the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age amen see evidence has to do with receiving the word the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order I love this last part he said the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth the word but to receive the truth the word and to believe it and to obey it the believer's responsibility is to receive the word amen obey the word come on church amen amen believe the word receive the word and Obey it listen people say well we're spiritual but you can't quote a prophet not very spiritual to me come on we're we're we're we're we're really we're really spiritual amen but we disagree with brother random here not very spiritual to me because the prophet said that the spirit only comes to the word that's why the spirit don't come to your feelings the spirit don't come to your emotions the spirit comes to the word the prophet of God said it very beautiful he said we are in the Battle For Truth amen all them lost sins amen must be restored he said and we're looking for Malachi 4 we're looking for his manifestation and we'll see the Vindicated word of God he said now there will be just a few understand it amen isn't that powerful there will be just a few understand it as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man amen as it was in the days of lots amen so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there will be very few saved amen translated in that time amen and one of the mysteries of that church is being taken up now how many will agree we're in the Battle For Truth we're in the world we're not of the world but we're in the Battle For Truth amen now somebody say well what what is the Victory Day for the Battle of truth it's the rapture the Victory Day for the Battle of Truth is the rapture you say how can you say that amen because the word must be restored you say then why are you focusing why why is this message so focused on restoring the word because the prophet said the bride takes the Rapture by the word amen when I when I caught that Revelation I about shouted all over my study amen the bride takes the Rapture by the word she does not take the Rapture by the way she feels she does not take the Rapture by Royal conditions she does not take the Rapture by who's in the White House come on church she does not take the Rapture amen by the conditions of the church she takes the Rapture by the word that's why you had to break out of feelings you had to break out of the emotions you had to break out a sensation you had to step over into the promise of the word amen to believe God regardless of how you feel regardless of what you concede regardless of what you can hear regardless of what you can remember you got to remember this one thing that's the word she'll go in the Rapture by the word now in this word that we're living it's a word age for the bride but listen we're in the world but we're not of the world I haven't left the Paradox we're in the world but we're not of the world so we're in a bright age can we agree but remember said we're in a bright age but he also said we're living in an intellectual age so in this intellectual age it's a bride age and the bride is preserved by the word that restored the bride he said God keeps his word in this intellectual age he said what is God warning he's wanting people to believe in a paradox he said now I believe it could be a paradox right here I believe that God is willing and wanting there are two powerful words God is willing and wanting to take his people and show himself if he can only get a man or woman boy or girl to lay down their own thoughts and become a prisoner to him and believe him he is the word amen and the Word was made cash now watch and now he is in you oh that's a powerful point now he is in you the hope of glory he's the same yesterday today and forever and he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also listen friends a prophet directly connected amen of paradox with John 14 and connected it to the Greater Works and announced amen that the God that was above us has been God With Us amen but now he's God in us you say how did everybody else get a paradox because the Paradox was not coming from the flesh it was coming from the word and the Word was in the flesh which was performing the Paradox listen let me say this plain as I know how amen the god of paradox is now in you the god of paradox is now in this bride you say well what is this bride she is the Sons and Daughters of God well brother Andrew someday someday will be the sons what about first John 3. amen now are we the sons of God see and it does not yet appear what we shall be amen but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen for we shall see him as he is can I make an announcement to you he's already appeared we're not looking for his appearing we're looking for his coming his appearing was Luke 17 30. his appearing was Revelation 10 1. we are not looking for his appearing he has been identified the Invincible oh God the identified characteristic of God has been made visible in the church in these last days now we are the sons of God not we're going to be not we might be not someday we might work hard enough and become a son amen we will always be the sons of God well that's a shouting point we will always be the sons of God Amen we are this morning we are this very hour if you call a revelation that you'd whip a hundred devils in two seconds amen you're not going to be the sons of God you might not be the sons of God right now this very night this very hour this very second you are the sons and daughters of God come on you got checkbook Authority you are an invincible Army you are the Overcomers you are the elect lady well someday what about today well brother Andrew in the Millennium will have Miracles we're not going to need miracles in the Millennium we need Miracles right now well what are you saying I'm saying this we are in the god of paradox somebody say that with me we are in the god of paradox and and the god of paradox is in US we are in him Hallelujah we are in him and he is in US If any man be in Christ he is a new creature the old things are passed away and behold all things are become new come on what is it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed in you oh if any man be in Christ who is the god of paradox and if a god of paradox being any man the hope of glory well I feel like preaching If any man be in Christ and Christ be in that man every born-again member of the Bride of Jesus Christ is a paradox he said you're a paradox in yourself he said what are you a perfect example of a paradox he said how that you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost because something happened to you you were changed your whole being anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is it's a miracle come on church when something transpired in your soul you were changed he said then there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and get him a new birth outside of God he said God Alone is the only one God Alone is the only one that can do it and it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking he can take his ways he can take his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it I know where some of y'all sitting right now you're sitting there saying well brother Andrew I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I want to be I'll agree I'm not either but I can raise my hand and say thank God I'm not what I used to be I may not be what I can what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be but I'm on my way to being what I want to be because the god of paradox Has Come Into My Soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has changed my ways he has changed my thinking he has changed my nature he has changed my habits he has changed my talk he has changed my walk he has changed everything about me because he's a change in God he's a new creation God somebody say well amen not a lot changing listen amen it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change oh what a change oh what a change in my life amen you just because you don't see it don't mean something ain't happening come on church just cause you don't see it don't mean something ain't happening what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying when you're born again it's an easy thing for you to believe in miracles when you're born again because you are a part of God see then what is God he's his own interpreter and how does God interpret his word he interprets his word by bringing it to pass now I can read you second Corinthians 5 17 and take you to Matthew Henry's commentary I can read you Colossians 1 and take you to what Schofield said but that's not the true interpretation come on but if I read it to you and then I point it brother Barry I point it brother Mervin I point it some of you Believers I'm actually identifying God's commentary of his word in this age it's a Living Translation it's a living interpretation it's a living manifestation Christ is the living interpretation of his own word listen if the spirit of John Dillinger was in me I would be a murderer if the spirit of Beethoven was in me I would be a beautiful piano player I could play music like you never heard amen but if the spirit of Christ is in me come on church if the spirit of Christ is in you amen then you'll do what he done you'll forgive like Jesus you'll love like Jesus you'll pray like Jesus you'll come to church like Jesus you'll worship like Jesus because the spirit of Christ is in you he's the living interpretation of his own word what are you say about Andrew I'm saying amen that this Bible is the truth it's this bride is the living interpretation of this word of truth then I can declare to you tonight that we are not we are not following Fables we are not following stories We are following the word of God but the Bible said we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we make known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eye witnesses we were eyewitnesses of his majesty come on Church what other preacher could stand on a platform and tell you that when he raised the Widow of named son you was there with him when he walked on water you walked with him when he went up to Calvary you went with him when he healed Bartimaeus you was with him no other preacher could tell you that amen but a word Prophet who was anointed to preach the Paradox of the invisible Union of a Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride could announce to you he's in you you have seen him you have heard him you have failed him oh God I feel like shouting he's in you the god of paradox is in you we're not following stories we're not following Kennedy devised fables I love I love that definition cunningly you know what it means it means to play the sofas the definition of kindly is to play the sofas listen to this when you look at that word play the sofas it is related to skepticism now you've got the tapes called the trial right who is one of the characters brother Branham identifies in that sermon Mr skeptic now listen to what he says he says may we see it tonight the living Christ who is not dead but is raised again for our justification he now lives Among Us he now lives Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost may he come tonight and speak to every heart that's visible and invisible and may he perform in their hearts the work of the new birth and bring them to the Redemption power of his resurrection taking away all Shadows of doubt and unbelief are you ready for this and destroying all skepticism that the church might move on in perfect harmony with the will of God as presented by the Bible and the Holy Spirit now some of y'all say well brother Andrew I I don't have no Spirit of skepticism okay maybe you don't have a spirit of skepticism about the message or a spirit of skepticism about the prophet but maybe you've got a spirit of skepticism about who you are one day you're a Son of God the next day you don't know one day you're going to make it the next day you're lost one day all is well the next day all is falling apart are you hearing me you know what that is that's called a roller coaster it's called an emotional roller coaster that you're riding and what's what oh God how can I preach and what it is it's a spirit of skepticism but a prophet of God was anointed by the spirit of God and in that message from that time in Spokane Washington he said my Ministry is different he said my Ministry is not like a pastor or an evangelist he said my Ministry is to declare him he's here my Ministry is to declare him he is here listen church if there's a spirit of skepticism about somebody the last thing you want to do is get that spirit in the presence of the personal I'm on Church listen if I had it I'm just going to use you for an example brother Mary if I had a spirit of skepticism I don't know if a man named Barry Johnson actually exists is he really a human does he really live is he really a person if I had that spirit I could go around saying I don't know if Barry Johnson's a real person I don't know if he's a real person amen but if I ever met him or I come in his presence amen his presence is enough to deflate the skepticism yes oh God his presence is enough Amen to silence the voice of skepticism and a reality set in I know he lives because I've seen him I shook his hand I've had fellowship with him come on church and that's the same way it is you know what we need we need an experience with a person of this message and the person of this message is Jesus Christ now brother Birmingham says it very plain he said now I know this sounds rational but if you'll just bear with me a few minutes I believe that ah are you hearing this I believe that I by God's help with his word and according to his word I can bring him right here before you laughs I know this sounds rational but I believe that I by God's help with his word according to his word can bring him right here before you see then what is this message it's not a myth it's not an imagination it's not a fairy tale it's a supernatural manifestation of a supernatural God see now now let me say it like this the prophecy spoke of the end time that in the end time people would turn from truth to Fables right the Bible says for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they heat to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables now listen to prophet he said the separation time is now taking place when God is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church God is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church how is the devil calling a church by turning their hearts from the truth unto fables but how is God calling a bride by the visible manifestation of his presence being here in the church oh can I say it it's something holding on to you brother Andrew what are you saying he said somewhere out in this mess they're still honest people that's ordained Alive Now The Devil's calling the church and God is calling abroad now here's the Paradox of the true bride is she will stay with her mate who's called her she will stay with her mate who's called her listen this on the wings of a snow white dove the dove is always somebody say always loyal to his mate always never leaves her and may I stop here just a few moments and say this a true bride a female dove is loyal to her mate too it won't inject any Dogma any denominational Doctrine anything of the world it'll stay loyal to its mate the word see always loyal now listen if you go through the Bible you can see and I'm just gonna I'm gonna give them to you very quick if that's okay the Bible is full of paradoxes of people who stay loyal to the word you know what the Bible says about Noah it says it was quite a hard thing for Noah and that great intellectual age he lived in to try to tell people by word of God that it was going to rain now it would be no doubt it didn't meet the qualification of their scientific research he said but Noah by Faith said there would be rain because God said there would be rain he said now God said so or thus saith the Lord it never meets the scientific approval of the day the saith the Lord or God said so never meets the scientific approval of the day he said but when the time come for the word to be fulfilled it Reigns just the same that was Planet Paradox to think that rain could come out of the sky where there is no rain amen the three Hebrew children was a paradox remember said there was a genuine Paradox of the keeping power of God against any enemy when a man is ready to admit that God is true when a man is ready to admit God is true he will perform a paradox through the believer that will admit the trueness of the one true Living God Amen Daniel was a paradox he was in a den full of hungry lines but oh how that group of hungry Lions stayed in the cave with him all night and Daniel came out without any harm Samson was a paradox are you hearing me Samson was a paradox amen Samson just an ordinary man that's all he was brother he was an ordinary man he was just a little bitty old shrimp little bitty guy here he was walking out like a little saying and with a Philistine garment he said up against him a helmet about an inch a half a thick a solid brass over his head he said now listen a thousand of them was trained and here they met the servant of Lord out there a little curly-headed shrimp probably a little jacket on but the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he picked up the Jawbone of a mule and beat down a thousand for this things he said why brother that old that old rotten Jawbone of that mule he had hit one of them big brass helmets it would have spattered a thousand pieces but it was a paradox see because God oh God because God was on that old Jawbone come on church it's incredible but it's true Robert said somewhere in history that that mule had died in a specific place are you hearing me that mule had died in a specific place for years it had been laying there rotten amen going down to nothing until it was just a brittle old Jawbone you know why because God of creation oh God God of creation God of Eternity god of time God of everything knew that one day his little curly-headed shrimp his little old servant little boy will be walking through there and would meet a thousand Philistines and he wouldn't eat something to whip them Devils with so God allowed a Jawbone of a mule to lay there oh it was brittle it was frail come on church but when Samson picked it up he began to slay one Philistine he began to slay toothless teens come on he slayed a thousand for listings with a dead dry rotten brittle Jawbone I'm gonna go ahead and say it if he can get on a dead one [Music] if he can get on that dead one hell glory to God you say preacher what are you getting at he can surely get on ours that's alive you got a job on you got a Jawbone you got a Jawbone come on you know where that Jawbone is it's in your mouth and you know what the Bible said amen from the heart of righteousness comes the word of faith come on Church how do you confess the word you confess it with your mouth you confess it with your Jawbone listen I feel like preaching right now amen amen there's a thousand devils in this building tonight there's Spirits all around you and they're trying to torment you they're trying to bind you they're trying to destroy you amen but for God of paradox is on the scene tonight and if he can get in a dried Jawbone he ought to be able to get into yours what are you saying preacher I'm saying the days of quiet Services ought to be over come on y'all know I'm telling the truth it's time to Rejoice it's time to confess it's time to preach with the preacher I know I know you get to preach about that people say oh my here we go emotion I am not promoting emotional fanaticism but I am preaching the authority of the confession of the believer [Applause] and you know what sometimes you got to do you got to defy every devil in the service to confess your promise you know what sometimes you got to open up your mouth and say I'm Healed you gotta open up your mouth and say I'm Delivered come on church when Samson picked up that Jawbone it was one whack two wax three wax you know what they heard whack whack whack whack whack whack well you know what you're not doing you're not saying whack whack whack you're saying amen hallelujah that's the truth that's nothing but the truth come on preacher amen glory to God hallelujah I believe it it's the truth it's the truth the devil is defeated I'm Healed I'm saved I'm going in the Rapture ain't no devil Gonna Stop Me if God can get in a dry dead Jawbone I believe he can get an ever living tall boat here tonight amen Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen amen what are you doing I'm pushing her back against Philistines amen the word is the truth he's the same yesterday today and forever he's my healer he's my strength he's my portion he's my peace he's my life he's my future he's my Rapture he's my resurrection he's my God he's my father he's my kinsman redeemer He's My All In All he's my everything he's here he's here he's here he's here in power he's hearing supreme power I'm not a crazy man I'm whipping devils [Music] they're not fanatical you're whipping devils Andrew don't you think you're getting too farther no I think it's time to put a whooping on the devil I think he's ripped us around long enough I think he's ripped our families around long enough I think he's whipped our churches around long enough I think he's whipped our kids around long enough I think it's time somebody pick up a Jawbone and with that devil someday this day some hour this hour some message this message oh God what are you saying I'm saying the same God that God and Joshua and said Son stand still the same God that God in Joshua and said Son stand still is in this building come on Church he's in this building but he's not in this wood he's not in those those seats he's not in this carpet he's in your flesh come on Church he's in your flesh it's your turn to speak what are you saying I'm saying the part of God said that this today the same God Mark 11 22 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said are you ready for that that's defy nature sure you have the power to defy nature but you have to have a motive and an objective to do it see motive and objective is connected with it now I find out in the word if it's supposed to be done and then God is calling you to do it oh God can I preach to you find out in the word if it's supposed to be done and then find out if God is calling you to do it and it'll do it direct quote find out if it's God's will to be done if it is find out if God is calling you to do it and if he is it'll be done come on Church why did God stop the son under the voice of Joshua because it was God's will why did God Amen allow rain to come out of the skies in the face of the critics because it was God's will why did God allow the three Hebrew boys to walk out of the fiery furnace unharmed by the fire because it was God's will he said now watch can I can I have a few more minutes when you know it's spoken in the word to do it then God has called you to do it then it'll happen if your motive and objective is right to God he said now watch that's why Visions take place while things are going the way you have to know and God promised at this hour now can I say it like this Jesus when he was on Earth he was a paradox I've come through Noah I've come to the Hebrew boys I've come through Daniel I've come through Samson I've come to Joshua now I've come all the way to our lord Jesus when he was on the earth you say you got there pretty quick I know I got a lot to cover when he was here on Earth he walked on water that's incredible but it's true see scientifically tell me how a man can walk on water paradox it's incredible but it's true see one day somebody say one day he took five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand now I want to set you like this sometimes I think we ought to I think we ought to really tell a story don't you and we're gonna tell it let's tell it the Bible said five thousand men and their wives so if you've got five thousand men plus their wives That's ten thousand now we'll say that all ten thousand had five kids that's fifty thousand well let's make him as big as we can he took two fish Five Loaves and fed 50 000 people y'all don't ever forget that he took two fish Five Loaves and the Bible said fed five thousand he said now what kind of an item did he turn loose what kind of Adam did he turn loose he said the fist wasn't even alive we were not working with living fish a boy skipped school went to Jesus meeting heard him preached brought his lunch to him it was good fish cooked bread and the prophet said he lined them up and when he broke the bread he broke it off a piece of a biscuit now watch this when he handed it out he said the time he got his hand back there again there was cooked fish Oak amen amen it's like you got it it's like you got a line here and Jesus has got this two fish Five Loaves in his hand and he says here's your portion and when he brings it back there's already fish and bread here's your Porsche come on church he never put his hand in a denominational resource come on he never put his hand in the Pharisees ideas he called God I'm about to explode what he done was he just stood there and he preached the message what are you saying I'm saying we got some five-fold preachers that are standing in the pulpit and Wednesday night they're handing you some fishing bread and they're coming back Sunday morning and there's more fish and bread they're coming back Sunday night and there's more fish and bread they're coming back on Saturday night come on sir they're not putting their hand out there and then pulling it back and it's empty so they reaching Dr Dobson to find something to say they're feeding you the bread of his presence laughs now can I can I take it another step he said in his hand was a piece of fish another piece of cooked fish listen that element is given to us that element is given to us if we'll just abide in the word oh God I believe we're on the verge of sin it happen live through the word there you are he had cooked fish that was a paradox can I say it to you like this whatever element was in his hand okay brother Barry whatever element was in his hand is in his church whatever creative element was in his hand is in his church come on church it's in you it's in the bride listen we're not we're not a bunch of a bunch of fairy tale preachers we're preaching Vindicated word and the prophet said the Creator the creative element of God has returned to the church now I said do you like this when we get rid of the human element that element goes out then the spirit of God fills the vacancy he said what are you talking about then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings yet he will be revealed in human beings what are you saying I'm saying that's the same thing that happened when Jesus fed those hungry people was deity was being revealed in human flesh oh God whatever was in his hand is in his church deity revealed in human beings listen church when we lay aside that human element we lay aside the human mind he said get all the human elements all the scientific ideas all the days of Miracles has passed all that has to die all that has to rot and then from there grows The Germ of life into a new life now brother Mary if the human young woman has to go out then what element fills the vacancy the prophet of God said amen it's a supernatural element now what is your Supernatural can I have a few more minutes a mystery is a scripture which is a previously hidden truth but it's now divinely revealed which is a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation see so when the human element goes out then the supernatural element comes in that's why you're seeing the manifestation in the degree that you're sitting in in this age because the message has removed the human element and is filled the vacancy where the supernatural element of God come on church that's why our meetings are becoming more powerful are you hearing me that's why our services are becoming more powerful because the human element's gone out now don't get mad at me but for years all the people fed on was the human element I was with brother Branham uh honey with brother Branham brother Branham called me friend brother random called me because y'all know I'm telling the truth and no disrespect but it was the human element but when the human element went out and the supernatural element of Revelation begin to pour into the vessel the church began to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man and a strength came in the church an anointing come in the church a power come in the church come on church amen I'm not that old I'm just 27 years old but I've lived long enough to remember amen when you go service and all you heard was God sent a prophet God sent a prophet I remember I remember I was a little kid amen I heard a guy preach one time preached about 30 minutes God sent a prophet God sent a prophet I went home and I had a little bible I was just a little kid and I got over my great grandparents and I got to preach them God sent a prophet they were methodists had no clue what I was talking about God said probably and we got fat but then we begin to move further into why God sent a prophet and the reason he sent a prophet was to release the supernatural element come on church can I say this You're the Reason God sent a prophet you're the reason that God fulfilled Malachi 4. why brother Mervin because he wanted to perform another Paradox but he could not perform it as long as the human elements had the preeminence in the church so he sent a prophet with a message of the super sign and the super sense are you hearing me I feel good right now of the super sign and the super sense to show you that the only way a miracle can take place is by the super sign and the super sense Isaiah 7 14 the Lord himself shall give you what a sign but hold a virgin shall conceive bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel super sign Mark 11 22 Jesus answering Seth and them have faith in God super sense brother said this Sixth Sense belongs only to the Christian he said the five senses inner outer was given the contact to Earthly home he said but that Sixth Sense is better known to the Christian as Faith are you ready for this it's the one that governs you and guides you it's Superior to all other senses he said and the super sense is the holy spirit are you ready for this the faith of God that dwells in you okay come on Church can I preach a minute why are some of you all still believing this message [Applause] come on church you've been through stuff that should have destroyed you but you're still here you've been through troubles it should erect you but you're still here some of y'all have come through false doctrines you've come through all kinds of things but you're still here do you know why you're still here because you're a paradox in the last days I will pour out my spirits saith the Lord come on church and you as a prepared ground to receive the presence of God the faith of God the faith of God is in every believer oh my oh if you're left that five centuries be yielded to The Sixth Sense it'll guide you and will bring all other five senses under the control of the super sense are you ready for this it makes you act where you do not think the five senses whatever think about it we're the five senses would never let you go The Sixth Sense takes you with the five senses which say is Off Limits The Sixth Sense takes you there listen are you ready for this I'll tell you what I'm trying to close but I tell you why the devil hate you it's cause the devil can get in those five sixes and lie to you but he cannot he cannot he cannot touch that super sense it's far beyond his reach come on Church it come from God oh that ought to make you want to shout hallelujah well we ought to take a minute and say praise God praise God the devil can get in your sight he can get in your hearing he can get in your smell he can get in your feeling he can get in your reason he can get in your imagination but he cannot get in your faith he cannot get into your faith because your faith didn't come from your mama it didn't come from your daddy but your faith Hallelujah your faith come from God come on church then that's why the devil can't have you because you come from God and you've got to go back to God [Applause] oh you're a paradox you're a paradox you're looking for a miracle look in the mirror you're a paradox the faith of God the faith of God is ruling raining governing oh I know what I'm talking about it's ruling right now it's raining right now it's governed right now your feelings don't want you to have this but your face says sit down shut up it's my promise it's my message it's my anointing it's my Revival it's my hour listen listen if you're going to see a miracle you're going to separate your faith from your feelings now I know where I'm at because the devil the devil's a liar that devil is a liar are you ready for this and The Sixth Sense come for only one reason that is to make five senses in you didn't deny anything deny anything that's contrary to God's word can I go ahead and read it any symptom that's contrary to God's promise the sixth sense says it's not there brother more than the sixth sense says it's not fair see what happens is the super sense comes in connection with the super sign are you ready for this and the supersonic I'm trying to close the super sign is God in man manifesting his written word then Greater Works in this she can do the Greater Works who is she she's the bride can I say this to you when brother Brown speaks sometimes you know I refers to you little bride brother he calls you little bride you know what he says he said don't you worry you little bride God's coming don't you worry everything's right on time this has got to happen like this the word says so are you ready for another one in the midst of Darkness who is going to bring the little bride out the chief designer are you ready for another one he's pulling his little bride out are you ready for another one he's going to bring this little bride that smitten right back to the side of the original word are you ready for another one but thank God the little bride has made herself ready are you ready for another one when that little Bride come in view it was different it was the Alpha and the Omega are you ready for another one like the little bridegroom taking the bride to her surprise how the little bride stands there in all as she looks at her future home can I give you one more now the humble little bride of Christ just simply believes the word whoever she is oh they say preacher why are you emphasizing on little because my Bible says in Proverbs 15 16 better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith you know what that word little means smallness it means fewness you know what Jesus said fear not Little Flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom can I close and leave you with this little is much [Music] little is much when the god of paradox is in it you say well brother Andrew we're just a little church on the side of the road in Calgary can I say this little as much little as much when God is in it and you know what I say I say God is in this church God is in this pastor God is in this body God is in this church ever devil is defeated little is much [Applause] you say brother Andrew little yeah few a number come on what is her 55 or 60 or tonight few in number but greater in power come on as she nears the headstone as she nears the Capstone the honing time she will be fewer in number but she will be greater in power what are you saying if God got into fish and Five Loaves and fed five thousand he can get in the water with potentials and turn it into wine he can get into every believer amen and perform unlimited miracles what are you saying preacher I'm saying this is bride time this is adoption time we have not received oh God y'alls are pulling church we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear brother Mary this is not the time to fear this is the time to believe come on church it's your time to believe it's your time to believe this is not the time to fear this is the time to believe for the impossible believe for the impossible believe for the impossible believe for the impossible believe all things are possible to them that believe what are you saying preacher I'm saying this I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body now I say this Satan is challenged Satan has challenged and a prophet is challenged can I say something stupid devil Satan challenged but when he challenged a prophet challenged and you know what he said he said and this challenge must be met so you know what I say I hear your challenge Satan you say well if God is with you then where's all the Miracles you know what I say they're here they're here where is all his miracles they're here Hallelujah they're here you're a miracle I'm a miracle Hallelujah Living Word assembly is a miracle you're a miracle he's here he's here he's here he's performing his miracles in his bride what are you saying I'm saying he's here performing Miracles can I tell you a few inclusion the other day out in Pennsylvania I was preaching that brother Jim shoemak's church just standing there preaching the word just preaching not laying hands on nobody hadn't even opened the alternate and while I'm preaching brother Mary I read across a quote when I looked at it I just kept on going I was going through some some through some discernments real quick and when I skipped over it something spoke to me said go back read it so I walked back over I said y'all forgive me I found that quote and I read it you know what it was it was a prophet calling out a sinus trouble when I read that quote there was no emotion there was no screaming I read it kept on preaching we got to brother Jim shoemake's house after service we're sitting around the table and his son Jimmy sitting there and all of a sudden brother his son Jimmy goes and just breathes in and he goes oh my Lord dad he goes I'm Healed he said I'm Healed brother Jim said really son he said yeah he said dad you know I've had this problem in my sinuses and hadn't been able to breathe out the left side of my nose in years he said but brother Andrew when you read that quote he said I didn't feel nothing he said all I did was say that's the truth the god of paradox performed a paradox you know why because we're not preaching doctrinal we're not preaching Dogma we're not preaching Creed we're preaching created word just last year out in Cloverdale I was there ministering I was preaching I pray it's okay to testify for a minute and I'm done I was out preaching in Cloverdale preaching there on a Wednesday night before the Winter Camp while I was preaching I was preached on the third pull creation power and I said now when brother man spoke those cross into existence he the spirit didn't come down and find some squirrel guts and squirrel DNA and squirrel bones and dry squirrel blood and say abracadabra abracadoo by the spirit I make a squirrel out of you no there was nothing there but created word created squirrels and a prophet killed him when I said that I didn't know but brother Murphy Wong's daughter sister Grace she was sitting there and her and her husband was Desiring a baby they were Desiring a little child I didn't know her condition the next year I go back to those meetings brother Murphy says you got to hear Grace's testimony sister Grace and her husband come over there she said with Andrew when you were preaching last year she said you read that quote and you said there was nothing there for God to work with but he created anyhow he said here's my testimony she said I went to the doctor and the doctor said if I was ever going to have a child she said I would have to have a surgery they meant to fix something in my body she said because there was nothing there was nothing there to create a child with are you hearing me listen to me there was nothing there to create a child with she said but when you said that she said something in my heart said I believe it she said I had been through a prayer line she said brother Ron had a vision brother Ron Spencer said she'll have a child she said I had settled to believe that by the vision and the surgery I would have the child she said but when I received that word that night she said the next morning I got up she said and I took a pregnancy test she said I come to Camp last year with a positive pregnancy test she said and here is the child are you hearing me church but God of paradox is back in the flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ you're a creative bride with a creative word what are you say it I'm saying this is God's word these are God's Miracles oh my can I tell one more I feel the devil getting scared we might as well running back to Hillary come from my God still in the healing business it's not a man doing it it's the super sense by the super sign out brother out in the Church of the day my wife Mariah I thank God for a holy ghost-filled life our little baby just a few months old she was changing his diaper one day and noticed his in his belly button a little a little hernia pick him the doctor the doctor said ma'am said that's a some some type of hernia said if it's not gone by the time he's four years old she'll have to have surgery and it will have to correct it amen but my wife in a meeting one day I was preaching when I got done preaching she brought malachite for prayer she said I want to pray this hernia will be gone laid our hands on him in just a few days a hernia sticking that far out was totally gone [Music] as if it was never even there what are you saying I'm saying the creative word has fallen into creative ground the super sense is nourishing it let our musicians come [Music] this [Applause] this is the bride's paradox do you realize we're living in the season of creation power by the spoken word it's actually happening it's not currently devised Fables it's not Skeptics it's a prophet the Holy Spirit you know just the other day we was out in North Carolina and I I share this I pray it's okay we was out North Carolina brother Joe Greene's it's a missionary convention meeting was there a minister in myself and brother Ron Spencer and they have they have in the morning Services they have missionary Brothers just take the services so it was Wednesday morning I was actually speaking that night and I was speaking on this thought of paradox and I'm sitting there in the morning service some of you may know brother uh charnick brother George sharnik from South Africa he has a son Nicholas charnick they call him Nikki he's great old big tall Felder man he he gets up he's always fired up but that morning he he come out he come out of the back room fired up man I mean just he was ready to go and he walks out there and he says everybody be seated everybody be seated he said I want to share a testimony with you and he was just rejoicing and he said like this he said last year when I was here he said I was preaching I was feeling good he said I just got home from the Amazon he said I went come here and preach went home he said a day after I got home I felt deathly ill said I went to the doctor I'm just going to leave out a lot of details for the sake of time brother Mary said I went to the doctor he said when I went to the doctor they said sir there's something wrong with you we don't know what it is we don't know where you've contacted he said well I just came out of Amazon they put him in an isolation room not even his family Carly going there shut him in an isolation room and they began to run scans when they begin to run these scans on one of the scans his lungs was literally leaving his body I've got the pictures if you want to see me send them to me they were literally leaving his body like from the from I mean you can see they're gone well it was something he had contacted was destroying his lungs and he was basically laying there dying and he said while I was laying there he said I just began to praise and my wife was praying my babies was praying he said I'll begin to pray and he said Lord he said I need lungs to preach he said I need lungs to preach your word and he said I breathed in and he said all of a sudden something changed in my body he said the next day they did an x-ray to see how far up that disease and eat more of my lungs he said and they come in there totally shocked they said we don't know what happened but you got a brand new set of lungs [Applause] there's a bread he said [Applause] he said I didn't have a lung transplant he said the only thing I know was the creator come by and created me a brand new set of lungs now brother Barry I was sitting about where you're sitting and when brother when brother Nikki said that something spoke in my heart and said this is a creative meeting this is a creative meeting I just wrote it down on my notepad and right behind that the voice of the Lord spoke to my heart and I just spoke it out in the service cancer is trespassing on Creative lungs when I said that I literally wrote it down and then I went back brother and I underlined and highlighted and circled the word on because on the way to preach that meeting was brother Ron Spencer who's fighting stage four lung cancer stage four lung cancer fighting it and in that meeting in 2009 after the fire he received a brand new set of lungs in that same meaning received a brand new set of lungs and it just spoke out of me cancer is trespassing on Creative lungs so that not in the back room I left your brother on I said brother Ron I'm going to share your testimony from when brother bisco was preaching and your lungs were created brand new he said go right ahead he said can I give you something you may want to use too I said sure he said the other day they'd done scans he said when they've done those scans he said they ran the scans and come back and said the tumors the cancer the cancerous tumors he said your lungs are too powerful [Music] your lungs the doctor said your lungs are too powerful for the cancer to get in them the tumors are hanging on them I said brother Ron run that by me again he said that cancer can't get in my lungs it's just hanging on my lunch I said old devil isn't that just like the devil whenever God does something he can't get in it so he attaches himself to it but I want to tell you tonight if God's done something for you the devil has no right the devil has no right he has no right on your family he has no right on your ministry he has no right on this church Satan is a trespasser and we endure him in the name of Jesus Christ and we believe the presence of Jesus Christ is in this building to perform the miraculous once you stand your feet with me tonight he's here [Music] he's here in this building tonight why did you tell those testimonies because the devil's defeated Satan Satan is defeated [Music] he's defeated and I stand here tonight under a commission of almighty God to say what a prophet said and you know what a prophet said God is here to put Satan out God is here to put Satan out now listen I believe he's here in this building tonight I believe the god of paradox is right here [Music] he's here to put Satan out what's your bow your hearts with us tonight here I declare unto you that he is here [Music] and I tonight by God's help and God's word according to his word have brought the god of paradox right here before you tonight [Music] he's here he's here to heal he's here to save he's here to deliver he's here to do exactly what his word he said he would do [Music] now listen Satan is a defeated being and a prophet said he knows it now think about that tonight as you bow your hearts before the Lord Satan is a defeated being and he knows it he knows he's defeated and he still showed up in this meeting tonight to try to defeat you he tells you you're not going to make it he tells you this message is not for you he tells you you're too sick you're too bound you're too you're too you're too far gone that's a defeated being telling you that but what if I tell you what the word said greater is he that's in you then he it is against you listen I believe tonight the god of paradox is in the building as we pray tonight this altar is open brother Bram said it like this he said why do we preach the power of paradox why do we preach the power of Deliverance in the Holy Ghost and deny the people the opportunity to experience it I believe you can experience a paradox tonight because it's your paradox almighty God we bow our hearts we humble ourselves in your presence tonight Lord father I heard your Prophet say one time he said I bring these people into your presence Lord by the means of Prayer father this is the little bride this is the elect lady this is the bride that you have called out by identifying your presence in her midst Lord this is the bride that has turned from fables to truth she's turned from Creeds and dogmas and false doctrines to truth to reality father your Prophet said it's so beautiful he said then lay your soul upon the altar and let the god of paradox make a paradox out of you Lord we invite you in this building tonight we invite you in this building Lord you see the needs of your children father you see the situations but I bound the spirit of the enemy in the name of Jesus Satan I a journey in the name of Jesus Christ come away from God's believing believing May the power and the liberty and the anointing the presence of God may they become completely anointed with the spirit of God Lord May their strength increase and increase an increase so Lord they step out of that situation they rise up out of that condition and they begin to walk they begin to walk as a paradox father we love you too we bless your name in Jesus name in Jesus name in Jesus name [Music] he's here tonight he's here he's here can we sing that only believe oh [Music] please [Music] all things are possible [Music] baby cause our pastor comes tonight all things are possible if anyone else

[Music] tried and true [Music] with things [Music] forward here I believe we've heard from Heaven tonight these were not the words of a man this was not the words of Andrew Glover this was the word of God to remind us about Who We Are and where we stand and if Satan is here he's trespassing it's that simple he's got no right over our church no right over our families no right over our children no right over our relationships he's a defeated trespassing being [Music] and we know our position I don't think he's here right now though I think we put the run on him we have a testimony tonight that uh I believe sister Faith wants to share if it's okay I could give you the mic brother [Music] I believe the Lord's done something here tonight if he's done something for you say Amen [Music] [Applause] God bless you God bless you Church just in case anyone has any doubts that God is really here God is here amen I came to church today with a very heavy heart just trusting of many things and I was on my City airplane without I don't felt let's go to the front to go and pray and I prayed and I said Lord I want to hear my name today just just speak to me just just tell me something that will show me that it's really really you are with me and when the brother came remember Andrew came to preach the very first Bible verse you read was John 14. I've been studying The Book of John and today I was read John 14 but I missed it it's Wednesday said John for like wow John 14 I said Okay God is that to you and the next thing he read was Hebrews 11. I didn't even hear another thing I only heard now faith that was what I had now Faith and I said Lord this can only be used calling me out directly amen and as as he was preaching I was on my chair here you know I don't felt something cold like I said all the burnings in my heart just just lifted away and I personally thank God because I know that all I asked him for I know he's going to Grant every one of them hey man glory to God [Applause] we got service tomorrow morning I know it's just about 8 30 and some people might be getting nervous but remember that's not the spirit of God I just feel like singing Because greater is he that is in you and me than he that is in this world [Music] why don't we sing that song maybe sing a couple songs and then we'll dismiss and just think about these words that we heard tonight he's here brothers and sisters the prophet didn't come to say he's coming he came to declare he is here and if he's here then we should see him as he is we'll start with that first verse Satan's like a roaring light roaming to and from seeking whom he may devour the Bible tells us [Music] today today [Music] [Music] [Music] on the day of Pentecost of Mighty
