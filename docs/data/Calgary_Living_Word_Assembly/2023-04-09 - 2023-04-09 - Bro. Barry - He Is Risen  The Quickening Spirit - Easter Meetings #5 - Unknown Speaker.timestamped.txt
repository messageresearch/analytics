[1:18:52] were willing to go to Calvary Lord Jesus
[1:18:56] or a group of people
[1:18:58] Lord that you were willing to condescend
[1:19:01] from your throne
[1:19:07] to the lowest estate of a human being
[1:19:09] born in a hybrid condition
[1:19:13] father
[1:19:15] to be humiliated
[1:19:18] to be spit on
[1:19:20] to have your beard torn out

[1:19:26] to be mocked
[1:19:28] or Jesus
[1:19:31] to be whipped
[1:19:34] to be belittled to have that
[1:19:37] mockery Crown of Thorns put on your head
[1:19:43] and then
[1:19:45] to lay your life down
[1:19:48] so that we could be here this morning

[1:19:57] but Lord we know that we could never
[1:19:59] ever
[1:20:01] compare any suffering in this world to
[1:20:05] what you went through

[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:20] just like to read from Matthew chapter
[1:24:22] 28.
[1:24:24] verses 1 2 7.
[1:24:29] very familiar scripture
[1:24:33] in the end of the Sabbath
[1:24:35] as it began to Dawn
[1:24:38] toward the first day of the week as
[1:24:40] brother
[1:24:42] Emmanuel brought last night
[1:24:44] the three days and three nights
[1:24:48] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[1:24:50] Dawn toward the first day of the week
[1:24:52] Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[1:24:54] to see the Sepulcher
[1:24:57] and behold there was a great earthquake
[1:25:00] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[1:25:02] heaven
[1:25:03] and came and rolled back the Stone from
[1:25:06] the door
[1:25:06] and sat upon it
[1:25:09] his countenance was like lightning and
[1:25:12] his raiment white as snow
[1:25:15] and for fear of him
[1:25:17] the keepers did Shake
[1:25:19] and become became as dead men
[1:25:22] and the angel answered and said unto the
[1:25:25] women notice he didn't say it to the
[1:25:27] guards
[1:25:28] he said it to the female
[1:25:30] fear not
[1:25:33] fear not ye for I know that ye seek
[1:25:36] Jesus which was crucified
[1:25:39] he is not here
[1:25:41] for he is risen
[1:25:45] as he said
[1:25:48] come
[1:25:50] see the place where the Lord lay
[1:25:53] come and see the proof
[1:25:55] and go quickly and tell his disciples
[1:25:58] that he is risen from the dead
[1:26:01] and behold he goeth before you into
[1:26:03] Galilee
[1:26:04] there shall ye see him
[1:26:07] lo I have told you
[1:26:10] let's turn over to Romans chapter 8.
[1:26:20] exactly where
[1:26:23] the Gilbert started
[1:26:25] Romans 8 11.
[1:26:28] very familiar scripture once again
[1:26:37] but if the spirit of him
[1:26:41] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:26:44] in you
[1:26:46] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:26:49] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:26:53] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:26:56] let's just bow one more time
[1:26:59] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:27:01] for this word
[1:27:03] we thank you for the mechanics
[1:27:05] and Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[1:27:07] Dynamics
[1:27:09] because we know that this word is just
[1:27:12] word in print form
[1:27:14] but when the Dynamics comes
[1:27:16] father that changes everything
[1:27:19] we know that that Dynamics is the
[1:27:21] quickening spirit that this word speaks
[1:27:23] of father and we welcome it this morning
[1:27:25] and we welcome it not as an inanimate
[1:27:28] object but we welcome that Spirit as the
[1:27:31] person of Jesus Christ father you told
[1:27:34] us last night that you would have a
[1:27:36] manifestation in flesh once again on
[1:27:39] Earth before the Rapture of the church
[1:27:41] and we just accept it the way that
[1:27:42] you've brought it to us father and we
[1:27:44] just ask that you would take this
[1:27:46] quickening spirit this morning Father
[1:27:48] and Quicken this word to our very Souls
[1:27:51] Lord father that it would come from the
[1:27:53] very soul out into our very Spirit Lord
[1:27:56] that it would begin to consume our
[1:27:59] spirits and our our emotions that are on
[1:28:01] the innermost Spirit of the humans that
[1:28:04] are here father and that it would begin
[1:28:05] to manifest in our bodies Lord Jesus on
[1:28:09] the body uh father all of our our
[1:28:13] emotions in our bodies Lord the way that
[1:28:15] we think father the thoughts that come
[1:28:17] into our mind that it would change the
[1:28:19] the way we behave towards those thoughts
[1:28:21] Lord Jesus that that quickening Spirit
[1:28:23] wouldn't be an ointment on the on the
[1:28:25] top of our skin that we would just apply
[1:28:27] from the outside Lord but that
[1:28:29] quickening Spirit Lord Jesus let it come
[1:28:32] from the very inside Lord that teeny
[1:28:34] little space that you made in the heart
[1:28:36] of a man father that it would change our
[1:28:38] bodies from glory to glory we just
[1:28:40] invite that quickening Spirit now you
[1:28:43] yourself Lord Jesus have the preeminence
[1:28:45] now in our service Lord in our thoughts
[1:28:48] and in our hearts father we ask in Jesus
[1:28:51] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[1:28:54] this morning you may be seated
[1:28:57] I don't have any announcements this
[1:28:59] morning
[1:29:01] other than I just want to say thank you
[1:29:03] so much to everyone for the week of
[1:29:05] meetings here
[1:29:07] it certainly has been an encouragement
[1:29:09] to me
[1:29:10] if for nobody else I have been
[1:29:12] thoroughly thoroughly thrilled
[1:29:16] we certainly miss those who are
[1:29:17] traveling but we know that uh
[1:29:21] they're just having fun they're doing
[1:29:23] what they do some of them are in
[1:29:25] Edmonton this week I know brother
[1:29:26] Justice in the family went to Edmonton
[1:29:28] to Fellowship brother Toby is actually
[1:29:31] taking the service right now for brother
[1:29:33] Sig Clark
[1:29:34] and uh brother Daniel and sister Christy
[1:29:37] I understand went with them as well
[1:29:39] just to fellowship with them
[1:29:42] God bless you Sister Jermaine it's so
[1:29:44] good to see you
[1:29:45] certainly a pleasure to see our brothers
[1:29:47] and our sisters
[1:29:48] when we don't get to see them all the
[1:29:50] time
[1:29:52] but here we are this morning and and
[1:29:53] it's just a beautiful morning
[1:29:56] this morning when I
[1:29:58] I woke up I
[1:30:00] it was way before daylight and I I just
[1:30:03] I thought
[1:30:05] I wonder what it was like
[1:30:07] the moment that Jesus opened his eyes in
[1:30:10] the Tomb
[1:30:11] what was that moment like
[1:30:14] because I can guarantee all the devils
[1:30:17] in hell we're watching
[1:30:19] they were watching intently as were all
[1:30:22] of the angels in heaven they were
[1:30:24] watching intently they knew the Angels
[1:30:27] knew what was going to happen but the
[1:30:28] Devils those Fallen Angels they didn't
[1:30:30] know but boy oh boy when those eyes
[1:30:32] opened they must have gasped they must
[1:30:35] have had a heart attack a heart failure
[1:30:38] just like Rahab told the two spies that
[1:30:41] you know our hearts melt within us when
[1:30:44] we hear about your God all the devils in
[1:30:47] Hell their their hearts must have just
[1:30:48] melted when his eyes opened that very
[1:30:51] instant
[1:30:52] when that quickening power came upon him
[1:30:56] I don't want to get too far into it yet
[1:30:58] this morning but I'm just certainly
[1:30:59] thankful for the ministering brethren in
[1:31:02] the congregation and I'm sorry brother
[1:31:04] Paul and brother Joshua brother Jose I I
[1:31:08] wanted to have a spot for everyone but
[1:31:10] it just didn't work out and we'll make
[1:31:12] sure that we find a spot for you both as
[1:31:15] well
[1:31:15] but uh we know our hearts are together
[1:31:18] we're not Divided We believe the same
[1:31:20] message of the hour and and we just
[1:31:23] trust that the Lord is working things
[1:31:25] out for his glory
[1:31:26] and uh it just was a wonderful week and
[1:31:30] I'm just gonna maybe do a little bit of
[1:31:32] a recap I can't help but talk about it a
[1:31:34] little bit you know how brother Gilbert
[1:31:36] brought it from Romans 8 11 about this
[1:31:39] this this Spirit of him that raised up
[1:31:42] Jesus from the dead if it dwells in you
[1:31:45] it will Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:31:47] I've just been tumbling this around in
[1:31:50] my mind and in my heart for some time
[1:31:53] well before the Easter meetings because
[1:31:55] it was a very scripture I was going to
[1:31:57] use brother Bradham uses it in the
[1:31:59] Easter seal he preached that just before
[1:32:00] he preached uh it is the rising of the
[1:32:03] Sun a 1965 both of those sermons he uses
[1:32:07] Romans 8 11. it's about the quickening
[1:32:09] power the spirit of Jesus Christ that's
[1:32:12] the quickening power and it will Quicken
[1:32:14] our mortal bodies but what I've been
[1:32:16] been really dwelling on is it's not that
[1:32:18] it's quickening our mortal bodies to to
[1:32:21] say that we're just gonna have maybe the
[1:32:24] spirit enter into a service and it's
[1:32:25] going to Quicken our bodies and we're
[1:32:27] just going to praise God in a in a
[1:32:29] greater way or or we're going to maybe
[1:32:31] do more for the body of Christ because
[1:32:33] our bodies have been quickened it's not
[1:32:36] just that it's going to get us out of
[1:32:37] the Grave one day it's going to Quicken
[1:32:39] our mortal bodies that will have a
[1:32:41] theophany body really what this word is
[1:32:43] saying is that it's going to Quicken our
[1:32:45] mortal bodies this Flesh on the outside
[1:32:48] and the spirit on the inside is going to
[1:32:51] Quicken both of those to the word of God
[1:32:53] for our day
[1:32:54] it's going to take the bodies and cause
[1:32:56] us to become subject to that word if we
[1:33:00] have the quickening power and that
[1:33:01] quickening power brothers and sisters is
[1:33:03] the Holy Ghost that's why I can't say it
[1:33:05] enough and everyone who preaches will
[1:33:07] always say it as well we have got to
[1:33:09] have the Holy Ghost in our life but
[1:33:11] outside of a man that God would send to
[1:33:14] tell us how to come out of
[1:33:16] denominational tradition how else would
[1:33:18] we ever know how to get the true Holy
[1:33:20] Ghost anointing in our lives and not
[1:33:23] just an anointing on the flesh as we
[1:33:25] said not an anointing in the spirit but
[1:33:27] an anointing in our soul
[1:33:29] to get that token brother Branham says
[1:33:31] it that if we have that token we have
[1:33:33] the right to every single promise in the
[1:33:36] word that's where the word becomes
[1:33:39] quickened
[1:33:41] my
[1:33:43] but you know there's Spectators and
[1:33:44] there's players I love how brother
[1:33:46] Gilbert brought that it's pretty
[1:33:47] straight but you know we live in an age
[1:33:49] where it's not time to play church it's
[1:33:52] time to talk straight let let good be
[1:33:55] good let bad be bad it's going to be
[1:33:57] what it's going to be and those people
[1:33:58] who want to play will play they'll jump
[1:34:01] in the game and if someone is on the
[1:34:02] sideline today saying I don't know
[1:34:04] whether I should jump in or not try
[1:34:06] jumping in try it once jump one time
[1:34:08] brother Branham said about that story of
[1:34:11] the eagle just flap your wings one time
[1:34:13] and see if God won't actually meet you
[1:34:15] there
[1:34:18] but it's time to jump in the game
[1:34:21] the whole entire world is playing their
[1:34:22] game Satan's playing his game and you
[1:34:25] know what I'll say this he ain't playing
[1:34:28] he ain't playing he wants to destroy
[1:34:30] every single one of us
[1:34:32] and if we've got that quickening power
[1:34:34] inside of us he can't touch us
[1:34:36] and and if he can touch us it's only
[1:34:38] because he's been given permission to do
[1:34:41] so so that we could be perfected
[1:34:44] if we have a trial in our life the word
[1:34:46] says to rejoice in the midst of our
[1:34:49] trial because our trial is worth more
[1:34:51] than the best finest gold than we could
[1:34:53] ever get
[1:34:55] because it's going to perfect us
[1:35:00] we got Spectators and players
[1:35:03] why
[1:35:05] you know I heard this and I just think
[1:35:07] it's wonderful I'm gonna I'm gonna say
[1:35:09] it
[1:35:10] brother Bradham he he asked this gets
[1:35:12] asked this question and questions and
[1:35:13] answers
[1:35:14] and it's beautiful because you know how
[1:35:17] we have so many different ideas and
[1:35:20] traditions brother Emmanuel hit on it
[1:35:23] last night how we can have a quote and
[1:35:25] spin it to fit our lives to suit our
[1:35:28] needs and and make us Believers still of
[1:35:31] this message of the hour but yet bend
[1:35:34] the way the word says to do it brother
[1:35:36] Branham says just speak the word the way
[1:35:38] the word says it you don't have to
[1:35:40] interpret the word god interprets his
[1:35:42] own word you don't have to try and make
[1:35:44] it suit you but here brother Adam he's
[1:35:46] asked this question do you teach the
[1:35:48] bride must not attend any other Church
[1:35:50] unless you are preaching
[1:35:53] preaching or else otherwise the
[1:35:55] Tabernacle
[1:35:57] can you imagine that
[1:36:00] yeah that's that's that's the spirits
[1:36:02] that we're around and you know what
[1:36:03] Spirits don't die they're alive and well
[1:36:05] today
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:08] even around this message that's why it
[1:36:10] would be so close it would deceive the
[1:36:11] very elected if it were possible brother
[1:36:13] branham's answer he says no exclamation
[1:36:15] mark
[1:36:16] I don't teach that I don't believe that
[1:36:20] I do not believe it
[1:36:23] we've got ministers setting here that's
[1:36:26] scattered all around through the country
[1:36:28] and I just want to say we've got
[1:36:30] ministers sitting around that's
[1:36:32] scattered all around through the
[1:36:33] congregation
[1:36:35] right
[1:36:37] through the country and I believe that
[1:36:39] they are part of that bride
[1:36:41] I believe that a man or woman can go to
[1:36:43] church anywhere they want to go that
[1:36:46] teaches the word
[1:36:49] it's beautiful
[1:36:51] but he goes further with it doesn't just
[1:36:54] stop there
[1:36:55] I think it's so wonderful he says and I
[1:36:57] believe if they don't teach the whole
[1:37:00] word
[1:37:01] you should just stay at home and stream
[1:37:04] no that ain't what he says I'm just
[1:37:07] wanting to see if you're listening he
[1:37:09] says and I believe if they don't teach
[1:37:11] the whole word and you can't go to a
[1:37:14] church any other place where they teach
[1:37:16] the whole word go where they teach half
[1:37:19] the word until you can get to where they
[1:37:21] teach the whole word
[1:37:25] he says go to church whatever you do do
[1:37:29] that
[1:37:31] I want to say like brother Emmanuel said
[1:37:34] if there's someone saying you can be a
[1:37:36] pastor and you can just have an online
[1:37:38] Ministry I don't have to have a
[1:37:40] congregation I can have a virtual
[1:37:41] congregation or you could just stay home
[1:37:43] and stream brothers and sisters that's a
[1:37:45] lie of the devil
[1:37:46] that's a wolf and sheep's clothing La
[1:37:49] he's lying to you
[1:37:51] go to church the prophet of God said go
[1:37:54] to church
[1:37:55] don't sit at home go to church
[1:37:59] and I think it's beautiful it took me a
[1:38:01] little bit of learning but hey you know
[1:38:02] what I I know that God called me for
[1:38:05] however long he's called me if if
[1:38:07] brother Barry doesn't suit your fancy
[1:38:09] don't worry just go to church
[1:38:11] just go to church
[1:38:13] because you don't come to worship
[1:38:15] brother Barry
[1:38:16] you want to go worship God
[1:38:20] and I think it's wonderful we could go
[1:38:22] to a Pentecostal Church as a believer of
[1:38:25] this message of the hour and still be
[1:38:27] blessed and I believe that we could
[1:38:29] bring a blessing to that church
[1:38:32] I believe that's possible now I'm not
[1:38:34] saying stop coming here I'm not saying
[1:38:36] that I'm saying go or you can be fed
[1:38:39] go you can be fed it took me a little
[1:38:42] bit to get used to it some people left
[1:38:43] immediately when I came in here some
[1:38:45] people left after you know what it's
[1:38:47] God's doing it's God's people just go to
[1:38:50] church don't go home if you're staying
[1:38:53] home something's wrong
[1:38:57] I just thought it was beautiful the the
[1:38:59] idea of of players
[1:39:02] and Spectators we don't want to be
[1:39:04] Spectators this is no time to be a
[1:39:06] spectator because what we're going to
[1:39:07] watch is the rapture go and we're going
[1:39:10] to say wasn't a lie supposed to come
[1:39:11] wasn't
[1:39:13] are we supposed to have a third pull
[1:39:14] Ministry wasn't Lim supposed to be
[1:39:16] restored wasn't there all this different
[1:39:18] stuff supposed to happen
[1:39:19] no it ain't going to be the way we maybe
[1:39:21] think it's going to be we heard about it
[1:39:23] last night there's going to be a
[1:39:25] manifestation in flesh but brothers and
[1:39:27] sisters like I've said so many times
[1:39:28] take a look around this is it right here
[1:39:30] the Believers in Christ the bride age
[1:39:33] Revival is on right now
[1:39:35] people are looking for a great
[1:39:36] tremendous Revival I heard them talking
[1:39:38] about it in a in a in a
[1:39:40] interdenominational meeting they were
[1:39:42] saying oh the Revival and they were
[1:39:43] talking about the Revival and how
[1:39:45] there's going to be a Revival and there
[1:39:46] was just a Revival and there's coming a
[1:39:48] Revival and I was thinking my
[1:39:50] prophet of God has said the Revival's
[1:39:52] already happened and they missed it
[1:39:55] and now they're crying for oil oh my
[1:39:58] goodness what does that mean we know
[1:40:00] what that means as Believers of this day
[1:40:04] you know that was that was that was
[1:40:06] Wednesday what a tremendous message it
[1:40:08] was then we went on to the the greatest
[1:40:09] battle ever fought was in Gethsemane I'm
[1:40:11] sorry I need to get going here and you
[1:40:13] know we have part of our mind that's in
[1:40:15] our brain but we have part of our mind
[1:40:16] that's in our heart because as a man
[1:40:18] thinketh in his heart who thinks with
[1:40:21] their heart nobody thinks with their
[1:40:23] heart according to science but the word
[1:40:25] of God says we do
[1:40:27] there's a part that we know of that we
[1:40:28] can see potentially but then there's a
[1:40:30] part that we just can't see it's that
[1:40:32] inner man and that's that quickening
[1:40:34] Spirit we're talking about
[1:40:36] you know our body or our spirit we we
[1:40:39] don't want either one of those the body
[1:40:41] or the spirit to control us we we want
[1:40:44] to actually control them and excuse me
[1:40:46] when that quickening Spirit comes in
[1:40:48] brothers and sisters it's not like we
[1:40:49] have to try and do it it just happens
[1:40:52] just like sheep make wool just like
[1:40:54] doves are white there's just something
[1:40:56] on the inside of the inside that
[1:40:58] Babbling Brook brother batam talked
[1:40:59] about it just keeps pushing out what
[1:41:01] keeps you so happy Brooke it's just
[1:41:03] something on the inside of the inside
[1:41:04] that just keeps bubbling up we can't
[1:41:06] control it it's the Lord and you know
[1:41:08] brother Bradham he talked about that we
[1:41:09] heard that quote you know what if you're
[1:41:11] one of those those those people that's
[1:41:13] just used to have in your own way one of
[1:41:14] those Childs that's just a little brat
[1:41:16] maybe growing up into a grown man that's
[1:41:18] just used to having your own way all the
[1:41:20] time and you find it's always a problem
[1:41:22] maybe just try doing the opposite just
[1:41:25] just change the direction if you're used
[1:41:27] to having everything coming to you maybe
[1:41:29] start giving it away don't don't do what
[1:41:32] you've always done if you always do what
[1:41:34] you've always done you're only going to
[1:41:36] get what you whoever God but if you want
[1:41:37] to see more of God in your life there's
[1:41:39] more of God to have
[1:41:41] just take the Versa is what brother
[1:41:43] Bradham says the vice versa just do the
[1:41:45] opposite and Watch What Happens
[1:41:48] you know brother Bradham he said that we
[1:41:50] heard that quote he says that's the way
[1:41:52] to overcome anything do the opposite
[1:41:56] we talked about this a while ago I don't
[1:41:58] know how long ago a long time ago
[1:41:59] sometimes we can have a problem in our
[1:42:02] life and we can just simply say I rebuke
[1:42:04] you I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke
[1:42:06] you and we'll continually do that
[1:42:08] brother badam talks about it it's like
[1:42:10] seeing a rattlesnake you can see the
[1:42:12] rattlesnake there and he's got his tail
[1:42:13] rattling and as long as you stand there
[1:42:15] and you rebuke him he's going to keep
[1:42:17] his tail rattling and he could bite you
[1:42:19] but if you just say I rebuke you and
[1:42:20] turn around and walk away he's got no
[1:42:23] power over you he can't touch you
[1:42:25] that's what we need to do in our lives
[1:42:27] when we have problems if there's an
[1:42:28] issue we just need to walk away from it
[1:42:30] just move forwards keep walking
[1:42:34] and we heard about how you and I the
[1:42:37] bride is Christ's Victory there's five
[1:42:39] musts that we must do brother Mervin and
[1:42:42] three must Nots
[1:42:45] you know we've had so many mechanics so
[1:42:47] much mechanics
[1:42:48] bye how about some Dynamics brothers and
[1:42:51] sisters
[1:42:52] let's let's put some Dynamics into the
[1:42:55] mechanics now we've got a well-oiled
[1:42:57] machine we understand how to have church
[1:42:59] and we understand the message of the
[1:43:00] hour we understand all of the Mysteries
[1:43:03] now let's just let Christ come that that
[1:43:06] quickening spirit and Quicken this word
[1:43:08] to our very Souls my goodness and you
[1:43:11] know when we get those two together
[1:43:14] we become Justified
[1:43:15] [Laughter]
[1:43:17] because it's not us doing it is it
[1:43:19] such a beautiful beautiful ending to
[1:43:21] that message wasn't it how how that
[1:43:23] servant could not have left the garden
[1:43:25] with his ear on the ground or in his
[1:43:27] hand or in his pocket or someone
[1:43:28] carrying that ear because then there
[1:43:30] would have been a witness about them
[1:43:32] being bad about them being evil but
[1:43:35] Jesus said no no no no that's not the
[1:43:37] way this is going to go down put your
[1:43:39] sword up Peter because if you live by
[1:43:40] the sword you're going to die by the
[1:43:42] sword but man's only going to live by
[1:43:44] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:43:46] mouth of God it's not going to be the
[1:43:47] sword in your pocket it's going to be
[1:43:49] the sword of the word
[1:43:51] you know
[1:43:54] my
[1:43:58] looking in the uh the Easter seal
[1:44:01] oh my goodness
[1:44:04] I just think it's beautiful I'm not
[1:44:06] going to get into that yet I want to
[1:44:07] talk about brother Emanuel I just have
[1:44:09] some some of my notes uh that I was
[1:44:12] planning are quite like what brother
[1:44:14] Emmanuel was bringing last night and
[1:44:16] it's just the continuity of the of the
[1:44:18] spirit we had the discussions early on
[1:44:20] brothers and sisters are you going to
[1:44:22] announce who is going to actually preach
[1:44:24] and I said no I'm not going to announce
[1:44:26] who's going to preach when and the
[1:44:28] reason for that is I don't want to have
[1:44:30] assumptions I don't want us to be saying
[1:44:31] I'm going to maybe come because my
[1:44:33] favorite minister is going to preach or
[1:44:34] whatever I just want to see who is going
[1:44:36] to come and what's going to happen we'll
[1:44:38] get together as a body of Believers and
[1:44:39] just have church and then what are we
[1:44:42] going to talk about I don't want to talk
[1:44:43] about that I just want to see the
[1:44:44] continuity of the spirit I want to see
[1:44:46] the Lord move in every single service
[1:44:48] and you know from the very beginning
[1:44:49] right to the very end it's just exactly
[1:44:52] where I was anticipating we would go
[1:44:54] with it he has risen but not just 2 000
[1:44:57] years ago right now today in our very
[1:44:59] lives through the understanding of the
[1:45:01] message of the hour
[1:45:04] he's identified by his deeds
[1:45:07] that's what we heard about last night
[1:45:09] and you know if you can't believe me
[1:45:11] just believe the works that I do because
[1:45:13] they are what testifies of me and you
[1:45:17] know how does that apply to us do we
[1:45:18] have many signs and wonders no we don't
[1:45:21] necessarily have many signs and wonders
[1:45:22] but can you believe the word remember
[1:45:24] what the greatest Miracle is the ability
[1:45:26] to be turned from a filthy pig a human
[1:45:29] being that's a beast with a beast nature
[1:45:31] into a into a lamb of God into a son or
[1:45:35] daughter of God to actually receive the
[1:45:37] new birth
[1:45:38] that's the greatest Miracle ever
[1:45:40] we don't be looking for signs and
[1:45:42] wonders we want to see that quickening
[1:45:43] Spirit come to life in our life and
[1:45:45] that's when we'll be a real husband to
[1:45:46] our wives that's when we'll be a real
[1:45:48] wife to our husbands and children to our
[1:45:50] parents and brothers to our sisters
[1:45:52] that's when that quickening spirit will
[1:45:54] come in our lives but he's identified by
[1:45:57] his deeds
[1:45:58] and our lives speak volumes we don't
[1:46:00] even have to talk many times Our Lives
[1:46:03] speak volumes and sometimes it's just as
[1:46:06] simple as the you know we can we can be
[1:46:08] doing things and maybe somebody will do
[1:46:10] something and and we have a situation
[1:46:12] where we can make it better or or we
[1:46:14] could benefit by not doing anything and
[1:46:16] not saying anything as a Believer we
[1:46:17] want to make it better we want to see
[1:46:19] the person not not come up short we
[1:46:22] don't want to have people in in a
[1:46:24] situation
[1:46:25] maybe done wrong in a business deal or
[1:46:28] what have you
[1:46:29] we want to demonstrate the Life of
[1:46:31] Christ we were talking about it
[1:46:33] yesterday because really whose money do
[1:46:35] we have and when we're talking about
[1:46:36] money specifically we'll go there whose
[1:46:38] money do we have we've got God's money
[1:46:40] we don't just give him his 10 percent
[1:46:43] we keep his 90 percent
[1:46:46] he gives us his 90 percent all of it is
[1:46:50] his money the only reason we have any
[1:46:52] money is because he gave it to us my
[1:46:55] goodness
[1:46:56] you know uh out of the Easter seal
[1:46:59] brother Bradham talks about how that
[1:47:00] seal was broken and that's that's where
[1:47:02] I want to get into this morning here I
[1:47:05] certainly thank the brethren for the for
[1:47:08] the efforts for the labors knowing that
[1:47:11] we're we're holding down jobs and and
[1:47:13] coming and having Church like this what
[1:47:15] a tremendous blessing it's been though
[1:47:17] and like I said yesterday I think it was
[1:47:19] we might not see the results from this
[1:47:21] for weeks months years maybe even
[1:47:24] decades we don't know
[1:47:26] but we might be blessed tomorrow
[1:47:29] we we don't know what tomorrow has in
[1:47:32] store
[1:47:33] it could be a prayer from today that
[1:47:35] changes our life tomorrow we don't know
[1:47:38] in the Easter seal brother Branham he
[1:47:40] says
[1:47:41] but the real seal had been broken
[1:47:45] and one who once lived as we live
[1:47:50] died as we will die
[1:47:54] was risen from the dead
[1:47:57] what a morning
[1:47:59] never one like it in all the history of
[1:48:03] the world
[1:48:04] the secret was made known
[1:48:07] that he was both resurrection and the
[1:48:11] life
[1:48:12] the secret was made known that seal was
[1:48:16] open and isn't it wonderful brothers and
[1:48:18] sisters that that seal has been open in
[1:48:21] our day
[1:48:22] that seal that that that thing that had
[1:48:25] been hidden
[1:48:27] that he was both the resurrection and
[1:48:29] the life has been opened he goes on to
[1:48:32] say and he said when he come forth on
[1:48:35] that morning because I live you live
[1:48:37] also
[1:48:39] Not only was he the beneficiary of the
[1:48:42] Resurrection
[1:48:43] but all those seed that was resting in
[1:48:46] God's Great promise was a benefactor of
[1:48:50] that Resurrection to life
[1:48:53] because he said because I live ye shall
[1:48:55] live also and that was the breaking of
[1:48:57] the seal because he brought up
[1:48:59] so will everyone that's in Christ be
[1:49:03] brought up with him
[1:49:04] I heard something in a discussion this
[1:49:07] week that I thought was real interesting
[1:49:09] they said that there was a tomb of
[1:49:12] prophets that was opened in the 40s in
[1:49:15] Israel
[1:49:16] they found and they said that it was a
[1:49:18] tomb where prophets were and I'm not
[1:49:19] sure who the prophets were exactly but
[1:49:22] when they opened it they said what'd you
[1:49:23] find in the Tomb they said nothing
[1:49:25] it was empty
[1:49:27] and and they said why is that and
[1:49:30] someone said well when Jesus came
[1:49:33] forward many of the saints that slept in
[1:49:37] the graves came with him
[1:49:41] their tombs were empty also
[1:49:43] what a tremendous thought
[1:49:46] but we which are alive and remain oh my
[1:49:50] until the coming of the lord we know
[1:49:52] there's a promise coming brothers and
[1:49:53] sisters it's never been closer that
[1:49:56] promise is here and we have the ability
[1:49:58] to be the benefactors also as we just
[1:50:01] read because we are that seed
[1:50:04] and anyone who can hear this word
[1:50:06] actually is that seed
[1:50:08] if we can't hear this word then maybe
[1:50:11] we're not that seed and you know as we
[1:50:13] heard last night just because somebody
[1:50:14] can't hear today doesn't mean they won't
[1:50:15] be able to hear it tomorrow
[1:50:18] the key to it is as Believers is to not
[1:50:21] put anybody in or put anybody out
[1:50:23] because one day we're going to answer
[1:50:25] for it we're going to be the ones that
[1:50:28] are going to answer we'll stand before
[1:50:29] God and he'll say why did you treat that
[1:50:31] brother or that sister that way
[1:50:34] it's up to him to judge
[1:50:39] I certainly enjoyed the the services
[1:50:41] this week and I know that I've truly
[1:50:43] been blessed thank you everyone for your
[1:50:45] efforts all the song specials the the
[1:50:48] music all of the talent we have here is
[1:50:50] just tremendous
[1:50:52] certainly thankful for it
[1:50:55] you know uh talking about the quickening
[1:50:57] spirit
[1:50:59] second Corinthians
[1:51:01] 1 verse 22 who hath also sealed us and
[1:51:06] given us the earnest of the spirit in
[1:51:09] our hearts
[1:51:10] that quickening Spirit the Lord Jesus
[1:51:13] Christ the one who came and died and
[1:51:16] rose again he hath given us that
[1:51:18] quickening Spirit but you know it's the
[1:51:21] earnest it is the down payment brother
[1:51:23] Branham said of that Resurrection it's
[1:51:26] the proof and this is where I'm going to
[1:51:28] start to weave in brother Emmanuel I
[1:51:30] just thought it was so wonderful you
[1:51:31] know what nowadays when we see a
[1:51:33] Salesman they don't just actually come
[1:51:35] and try and tell you about their product
[1:51:37] they give you a sample of your product
[1:51:40] if you go to Costco and you walk through
[1:51:42] some people go to Costco just for the
[1:51:44] samples
[1:51:46] but you know brothers and sisters we've
[1:51:47] been given the sample the earnest or
[1:51:50] down payment of the life this
[1:51:52] resurrection that we talk about this
[1:51:54] quickening spirit
[1:51:56] I think it's just absolutely tremendous
[1:52:00] let's go back in our Bibles here
[1:52:02] just talking about our scripture in
[1:52:04] Matthew 28.
[1:52:09] just
[1:52:12] go backwards into Matthew 27.
[1:52:21] just after Jesus crucifixion
[1:52:25] his death
[1:52:27] and now his burial in the midst of it
[1:52:31] verse 62 of Matthew 27.
[1:52:37] according to what brother Emmanuel
[1:52:39] brought last night now here we go now
[1:52:42] the next day
[1:52:43] that followed the day of the preparation
[1:52:47] the chief priests and the Pharisees came
[1:52:49] together unto Pilate
[1:52:51] saying sir
[1:52:53] we remember
[1:52:55] that that deceiver said
[1:52:58] while he was yet alive after three days
[1:53:02] I will rise again
[1:53:04] command therefore that the Sepulcher be
[1:53:07] made sure until the third day lest his
[1:53:10] disciples come by night and steal him
[1:53:12] away and say unto the people he has
[1:53:14] risen from the dead so the last Heir
[1:53:17] shall be worse than the first
[1:53:19] and pilate said unto him ye have a watch
[1:53:21] go your way make it sure as he can
[1:53:25] so they went and made the Sepulcher sure
[1:53:27] sealing the stone and setting a watch
[1:53:32] now I can't help but think that was just
[1:53:34] anointed last night where we had man put
[1:53:38] a stone in the way of man's access to
[1:53:42] Jesus
[1:53:44] and we had man Desiring through the
[1:53:47] government to put a seal upon that stone
[1:53:51] to completely make it sure but isn't it
[1:53:54] wonderful that pilate he had the wisdom
[1:53:56] to say make it sure as you can because
[1:53:58] you're not going to be able to keep it
[1:54:00] you're not going to be able to stop it
[1:54:02] but go ahead and try
[1:54:03] I'll give you some servants some
[1:54:05] soldiers I'll give you maybe the Signet
[1:54:08] to go and put a wax seal on it you can
[1:54:10] go and make it sure as you can go ahead
[1:54:13] and try it
[1:54:15] but we know he couldn't keep it we know
[1:54:18] that it didn't happen that way
[1:54:20] but the point I want to get to here is
[1:54:22] verse 63 specifically
[1:54:26] we know that they they came to him
[1:54:28] saying
[1:54:29] sir
[1:54:30] we remember
[1:54:33] that that deceiver said
[1:54:36] can you imagine that brothers and
[1:54:38] sisters here we are once again
[1:54:40] the infidels the ones who don't believe
[1:54:42] believing
[1:54:44] though his disciples said that it was as
[1:54:47] Idol Tales when she came back and said
[1:54:49] he's risen he's already risen here we
[1:54:53] have those people who put him on the
[1:54:55] cross saying oh my we recognize remember
[1:54:58] this guy this Deceiver
[1:55:01] the most religious people hey
[1:55:03] understanding that there's something
[1:55:05] behind that word for their day
[1:55:07] understanding that something could
[1:55:10] happen we better make it sure as we can
[1:55:12] right let's go and put a rock in the way
[1:55:14] let's go and try and unveil them let's
[1:55:16] go and try and hide this from man
[1:55:18] because if they get the true revelation
[1:55:20] of the two Spirits within the framework
[1:55:22] of the Christian Church they'll become
[1:55:24] an invincible Army Satan won't be able
[1:55:27] to touch him the Gates of Hell will not
[1:55:29] be able to Prevail against that rock of
[1:55:31] Revelation that they actually receive
[1:55:34] when that angel rolls that stone away
[1:55:36] but isn't it wonderful brothers and
[1:55:38] sisters what happened in our day an
[1:55:40] angel messenger came and actually broke
[1:55:43] open that stone for us and now we're
[1:55:45] talking about it word wise but here we
[1:55:47] have it physical this was physical with
[1:55:49] Jesus in the grave who was God
[1:55:52] but we know that it wasn't man that
[1:55:54] opened that stone man is the one that
[1:55:57] tried to block the way man is the one
[1:55:58] that tried to get into the way of
[1:56:01] keeping man from being able to see Jesus
[1:56:03] but the angel of the Lord came and said
[1:56:06] no not so you're going to roll this
[1:56:09] Stone back and what happened there was a
[1:56:11] magnificent earthquake he's the same
[1:56:13] yesterday today and forever what
[1:56:15] happened when brother Branham was here
[1:56:17] and he threw that stone up in the air
[1:56:18] and he said get under something quick he
[1:56:20] was talking about something very
[1:56:21] specific there it wasn't just take cover
[1:56:23] under a tree get under an anointing get
[1:56:26] under the word for your day because
[1:56:28] there's coming a judgment on this Earth
[1:56:30] and what happened Good Friday
[1:56:32] 1964 65 63 when was it somebody probably
[1:56:37] knows Alaska almost sunk it was Good
[1:56:40] Friday it was the largest earthquake to
[1:56:42] ever strike North America in recent
[1:56:44] history
[1:56:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:56:48] forever
[1:56:50] I can't help but think that there was an
[1:56:52] angel rolling away a stone
[1:56:55] pulling back some Revelation opening it
[1:56:57] up to the people to say you know what
[1:57:00] there's something in store for you just
[1:57:02] keep pressing on
[1:57:05] you know talking about this uh
[1:57:08] I just think it's beautiful talking
[1:57:10] about this this this setting the stone
[1:57:13] there and and we know that they set a
[1:57:16] watch on it and and to make it as sure
[1:57:19] as you can they went to verse 66 says so
[1:57:23] they went and made the Sepulcher sure
[1:57:26] they went to make it sure
[1:57:29] sealing the stone
[1:57:31] and setting a watch
[1:57:33] think about that how they sealed that
[1:57:36] stone
[1:57:38] I I I just did something to me I looked
[1:57:41] it up sealed in in g49 72 is is is the
[1:57:45] word sealed and there's two forms of
[1:57:48] sealed in the Bible that I was able to
[1:57:49] see g4972 is the one that's used the
[1:57:52] most commonly and that is to stamp with
[1:57:54] a Signet or private mark
[1:57:58] for security
[1:58:00] preservation literally or figuratively
[1:58:02] by implication to keep Secret
[1:58:05] to attest
[1:58:07] set at and seal up
[1:58:10] and isn't it an amazing thing to think
[1:58:12] that here we have men trying to do that
[1:58:15] very thing
[1:58:16] but we've read in second Corinthians 1
[1:58:18] 22 who hath also sealed us and given the
[1:58:23] earnest of the spirit in our hearts it's
[1:58:26] the same word sealed trying to close it
[1:58:30] up but there's another sealed in the
[1:58:33] word in Revelation and that's the only
[1:58:35] other place that I could see it in
[1:58:37] Revelation and it's to seal closely in
[1:58:39] it's Revelations chapter 5 when he had
[1:58:41] loosed those seals when he was opening
[1:58:44] the seals creating the Revelation making
[1:58:47] the way for us to see what's actually on
[1:58:50] the inside of the inside
[1:58:53] to seal closely
[1:58:56] I just think it's a wonderful thing to
[1:58:58] look at this story here you know it
[1:59:00] wasn't very long before this if we turn
[1:59:02] over in our Bibles this morning just
[1:59:04] another scripture here in in John
[1:59:09] kind of picking up where
[1:59:11] where we left off before
[1:59:14] we talked about Lazarus and and I
[1:59:18] believe it was I don't know I'm not
[1:59:20] gonna pretend I can't remember we talked
[1:59:22] about this a little while ago maybe last
[1:59:24] Sunday or the Sunday before talking
[1:59:26] about The Story of Lazarus and and how
[1:59:30] they they they knew that Jesus could
[1:59:33] have prevented this from happening but
[1:59:35] we know Jesus knowing all things we know
[1:59:38] the story we're not going to go back and
[1:59:39] read it all but I just want to pick up
[1:59:41] in in the midst of the story where Jesus
[1:59:44] finally comes Lazarus is already dead he
[1:59:46] was God he knew what was going to happen
[1:59:48] he he didn't come on purpose when he was
[1:59:51] called for a reason he wanted to show
[1:59:54] them something he wanted to show them
[1:59:55] who he truly was
[2:00:00] but in Saint John 11
[2:00:11] Saint John 11 verse 21.
[2:00:14] Jesus had finally come
[2:00:17] then said Martha unto Jesus Lord
[2:00:21] if thou hadst been here
[2:00:23] my brother had not died
[2:00:27] we heard that beautiful special
[2:00:29] four days late
[2:00:31] I think that's what it was
[2:00:33] four days late many times we look at our
[2:00:36] lives and we have prayer and we have
[2:00:38] needs and their desperate needs and we
[2:00:40] would say that Jesus is four days late
[2:00:42] he doesn't come right when we say that
[2:00:44] we need him we know that we need to have
[2:00:45] an answer in prayer and he just doesn't
[2:00:48] come when we see it but we know that
[2:00:50] that's exactly the way it's supposed to
[2:00:52] be all things work together for the good
[2:00:54] so those who are called according to his
[2:00:57] purpose
[2:00:58] they don't always work together for the
[2:01:00] good
[2:01:02] verse 22 but I know that even now
[2:01:05] whatsoever thou Wilt ask of God God will
[2:01:09] give it thee so she didn't even realize
[2:01:11] that he was God yet
[2:01:13] she was talking to him as the second
[2:01:14] person God was another person to her
[2:01:17] Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[2:01:20] rise again
[2:01:22] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[2:01:24] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[2:01:27] the last day
[2:01:29] of course it's going to happen we know
[2:01:31] that's what's going to happen that's
[2:01:32] what we've been taught our entire lives
[2:01:34] Jesus saith unto her verse 25 I am the
[2:01:38] resurrection
[2:01:39] and the life
[2:01:41] he that believeth in me though he were
[2:01:43] dead yet shall he live
[2:01:47] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[2:01:49] shall never die and we know we left off
[2:01:53] with this believeth thou this and that
[2:01:56] was the message we had uh we had read
[2:01:58] from but if we could just drop down
[2:02:02] to verse 39 the same chapter we know
[2:02:05] that there was a discussion Jesus wept
[2:02:08] and we know people have said well how
[2:02:10] could God be God and weep we know that
[2:02:13] Jesus was all God and He was all man
[2:02:16] that's just the way it is
[2:02:18] verse 39 says
[2:02:20] Jesus said take ye away the stone
[2:02:24] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[2:02:28] saith unto him Lord by this time he
[2:02:30] stinketh
[2:02:31] for he hath been dead four days
[2:02:35] Jesus saith unto her
[2:02:38] said I not unto thee
[2:02:40] that if thou wouldest believe thou
[2:02:43] shouldst see the glory of God
[2:02:45] not the glory of Jesus
[2:02:48] but the glory of God
[2:02:50] then they took away the stone
[2:02:52] from the place where the dead was laid
[2:02:55] and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said
[2:02:57] father
[2:02:58] I thank thee
[2:02:59] that thou Hast heard me
[2:03:03] and I knew that thou heardst me always
[2:03:07] but because of the people which stand by
[2:03:10] I said it
[2:03:12] that they may believe
[2:03:14] that thou has sent me
[2:03:17] and when he had thus spoken
[2:03:20] he cried with a loud voice
[2:03:22] Lazarus come forth
[2:03:25] and he that was dead
[2:03:27] came forth bound hand and foot with
[2:03:29] grave clothes and his face was bound
[2:03:32] about with a napkin and Jesus saith unto
[2:03:36] them loose him and let him go
[2:03:39] now we know
[2:03:41] that this was God very God standing
[2:03:44] there in flesh calling him out of the
[2:03:47] Grave out of the Tomb calling him back
[2:03:49] maybe from from the regions Beyond from
[2:03:52] Paradise calling his soul his Spirit
[2:03:56] right back into him and when he came out
[2:03:58] of that tomb he was bound hand in foot
[2:04:02] and he had a napkin over his face and
[2:04:05] we've heard many different depictions of
[2:04:07] this but isn't it interesting
[2:04:09] Jesus said lose him immediately lose him
[2:04:13] but who was there to lose Jesus
[2:04:16] he didn't need loosing
[2:04:18] he was that quickening spirit in fact he
[2:04:21] actually took that grave cloth and
[2:04:23] folded it and laid it down to say the
[2:04:25] work is complete we heard brother Wayne
[2:04:28] talk about that one time The Carpenter's
[2:04:30] job when he worked in in Israel in those
[2:04:33] days when he was done he would wash
[2:04:35] himself and he would dry his hands and
[2:04:38] he would fold the napkin and lay it down
[2:04:40] and that was actually the proof that the
[2:04:42] work was finished
[2:04:44] it's a beautiful thing out of it's the
[2:04:47] rising of the sun brother Branham says
[2:04:49] that God knows Hallelujah he's got a
[2:04:51] predestinated four ordained Church
[2:04:55] he note he's got sons and daughters and
[2:04:57] a bride waiting somewhere and when the
[2:05:00] Holy Spirit begins to fly over it that
[2:05:02] wave Chief oh my he's the same yesterday
[2:05:05] today and forever not some mythical
[2:05:07] story but a reality no matter how man
[2:05:10] tried to tell him
[2:05:12] an eagle
[2:05:14] he didn't know what an ego was he's
[2:05:16] talking about the eagle
[2:05:17] the Eagle's egg being hatched under a
[2:05:19] hen but the Branham called it setting a
[2:05:22] hen putting the eagle egg under a hen
[2:05:24] and having an eagle hatch with chickens
[2:05:28] and being in the chicken yard and and
[2:05:30] raising up and not knowing that he's an
[2:05:32] eagle he looks at the chickens and he
[2:05:34] thinks that's the way he looks nobody
[2:05:36] ever put a mirror in front of him but he
[2:05:38] always felt a little bit different
[2:05:39] brother Brown's talking about that no
[2:05:41] matter how man tried to tell him an
[2:05:43] eagle he didn't know what an ego was and
[2:05:46] yet he was an eagle
[2:05:48] he would not understood it until he seen
[2:05:52] something that reflected him that he
[2:05:55] reflected rather
[2:05:57] and I just think this is so beautiful
[2:05:58] this is where it really starts to go
[2:06:00] like this with the message last night
[2:06:02] because we know him by his deeds we know
[2:06:05] him by the life we live how will the
[2:06:08] world know that we love him brothers and
[2:06:10] sisters not because we say we do the
[2:06:12] world's gonna say everyone says they
[2:06:14] love him the Catholic church say they
[2:06:16] love him and how many people did they
[2:06:18] put to death over the years
[2:06:20] in the name of God my goodness how will
[2:06:23] the how will the world know that we we
[2:06:25] love him we've got love one for another
[2:06:27] we're not divided we don't have
[2:06:28] divisions and camps and all of that
[2:06:31] business we don't do that not believers
[2:06:33] he says no matter how man tried to tell
[2:06:35] him an eagle he didn't know what an ego
[2:06:37] was and yet he was an eagle he would not
[2:06:39] understood it until he seen something
[2:06:41] that reflected him that he reflected
[2:06:43] rather and when we see not a
[2:06:46] denomination
[2:06:48] not a PhD
[2:06:49] not an lld not a good neighbor but a Son
[2:06:54] of God molded in the image of God with a
[2:06:57] dynamic power of God to answer the
[2:06:59] request of this day that he's the same
[2:07:02] yesterday today and forever
[2:07:04] there ain't no head that's going to hold
[2:07:06] you
[2:07:07] and you know brothers and sisters I want
[2:07:09] to say this here I want to interject
[2:07:10] this here I'm not saying what he said
[2:07:12] but what I do want to interject here is
[2:07:14] to Simply say this we're not talking
[2:07:15] about being quickened to the to the to
[2:07:18] the first and second polls to having a
[2:07:19] great manifestation of signs and wonders
[2:07:21] I'm just going to keep underlying this
[2:07:23] we're being quick into the word we're
[2:07:25] being quickened to say Amen to the word
[2:07:27] and not just to say Amen to the word but
[2:07:29] to actually reflect the word that's what
[2:07:31] brother Matt I'm saying there we're able
[2:07:33] to reflect that word to the world around
[2:07:35] us when I see you I see an eagle when I
[2:07:38] see you I see the word when I see you I
[2:07:40] see Jesus Christ I don't see my brothers
[2:07:42] Badger skin I don't see the the
[2:07:44] infirmities in your flesh I don't see
[2:07:46] the the maybe the temperament and
[2:07:48] different things that you have if
[2:07:50] somebody says something bad about us we
[2:07:52] just say you know I don't think he meant
[2:07:54] that brother Branham he said they said
[2:07:56] about him you wouldn't know his friends
[2:07:57] from his enemies we don't talk bad about
[2:07:59] each other we don't slag each other you
[2:08:01] know people might not hear us and that's
[2:08:03] fine but God does God hears us our
[2:08:06] thoughts even are louder in heaven
[2:08:09] then our words
[2:08:10] he says he's the same yesterday today
[2:08:12] and forever there ain't no hen that's
[2:08:14] going to hold you
[2:08:17] the eagle he says he hunts for his mama
[2:08:19] he's an eagle to begin with he
[2:08:21] recognizes this real Eagle recognizes
[2:08:24] the call of God's word
[2:08:28] and that's what we're talking about
[2:08:29] today brothers and sisters not just
[2:08:31] being a spectator and watching the
[2:08:33] Eagles Fly and saying my look at those
[2:08:35] Eagles those Eagles are beautiful
[2:08:37] they're so Majestic and they can fly so
[2:08:40] high they can go fast they're the
[2:08:42] biggest predators on the in the world
[2:08:44] they can do this and they can do that
[2:08:46] there's so many different varieties and
[2:08:48] types of them and maybe we have all the
[2:08:49] different stats on all the different
[2:08:51] players of eagles you know it's not
[2:08:52] going to do us any good what we got to
[2:08:54] do is jump we got to flap our wings one
[2:08:56] time we've got to raise our hands and
[2:08:58] jump up and down and praise the Lord and
[2:09:00] say thank you Lord for redeeming me for
[2:09:02] giving me the ability to receive your
[2:09:04] word in my day it says he's an eagle an
[2:09:07] eagle
[2:09:08] a word before the foundation of the word
[2:09:13] to the word
[2:09:15] the word predestinated to the word
[2:09:18] written for the hour
[2:09:21] you realize your position
[2:09:24] that sounds like a a mouthful it's kind
[2:09:26] of confusing but I'll say it like this
[2:09:28] brothers and sisters if you're in him
[2:09:31] now if he's in you now then you were
[2:09:33] with him at Calvary and we've already
[2:09:34] heard that this week you are not going
[2:09:36] to be here now without have being there
[2:09:39] on Calvary and if you were there on
[2:09:41] Calvary then you were with him before
[2:09:42] the foundation of the world and if
[2:09:45] you've been there before the foundation
[2:09:46] of the world then what it is it's the
[2:09:48] word being spoken by a Vindicated
[2:09:51] Prophet God's word echoing through a
[2:09:54] prophet into the ears of a son and
[2:09:56] daughter of God that doesn't understand
[2:09:58] who they are as a baby eagle they've
[2:10:00] been raised in a chicken pen and there's
[2:10:02] chickens all around they don't
[2:10:03] understand who they are but something
[2:10:05] sounds different about that word that
[2:10:07] they've heard and it quickens that word
[2:10:09] seed Gene of God inside of them to say
[2:10:12] Amen to that word I don't understand
[2:10:14] egos I don't understand the message or
[2:10:16] the seals or the Mysteries I don't
[2:10:17] understand any of that but there's
[2:10:19] something about that word just like
[2:10:21] Hattie Wright said with the third poll I
[2:10:23] don't understand it but there's
[2:10:25] something about that word that ain't
[2:10:27] nothing but the truth brother Branham
[2:10:29] talking about squirrels speaking
[2:10:31] squirrels into existence and we heard it
[2:10:33] last night he didn't say thus saith the
[2:10:35] Lord that squirrel is going to come out
[2:10:36] this way he just simply said that
[2:10:38] squirrel is going to come out this way
[2:10:39] who does that God is the only one that
[2:10:43] does that but it wasn't brother Branham
[2:10:45] being God it's not Christ Branham it's
[2:10:47] God in brother Branham and the same God
[2:10:49] that was in brother Branham is in you
[2:10:51] today
[2:10:52] that's the quickening spirit in Romans 8
[2:10:55] 11 that we're talking about brothers and
[2:10:57] sisters
[2:10:58] it's not some other person don't look
[2:11:00] for another person look for Jesus Christ
[2:11:03] the same yesterday today and forever to
[2:11:05] live out through us it's the word to the
[2:11:08] word the word predestinated from before
[2:11:11] the foundation of the world
[2:11:12] predestinated to the word written for
[2:11:15] the hour
[2:11:17] not some other hour
[2:11:19] I love how brother Mervin said it it's
[2:11:21] the message of the hour I got about 18
[2:11:23] minutes left
[2:11:26] the message of the hour
[2:11:28] we only want to keep it to be an hour
[2:11:31] but one of these days maybe it'll just
[2:11:32] continue on you know I I can't help but
[2:11:35] think that one day maybe we'll start to
[2:11:36] see loved ones
[2:11:38] maybe we'll have 30 about 30 to 40 days
[2:11:40] you know there will be maybe that will
[2:11:43] happen and I I I'll say this I'll take
[2:11:45] all my resources brothers and sisters
[2:11:46] and I'll throw caution to the wind and
[2:11:48] I'll get a tent big enough to fit as
[2:11:50] many people that want to come to it
[2:11:52] maybe it sounds fundamentally crazy but
[2:11:55] hey you know what I'm only going to want
[2:11:57] to have church I'm only going to want to
[2:11:58] praise God I'm only going to want to
[2:12:00] shake the hands of all those Believers
[2:12:01] that we start to see all around I'm not
[2:12:04] going to be interested in going to do
[2:12:05] the things that I want to do
[2:12:08] but you know that's that's never been
[2:12:09] closer brothers and sisters it's never
[2:12:11] been closer
[2:12:13] that many of the Saints who slept will
[2:12:16] be seen in the city we could start
[2:12:19] seeing loved ones and and I would say
[2:12:21] we're not just could start seeing loved
[2:12:23] ones we will start seeing loved ones and
[2:12:26] I don't know about you but I've heard of
[2:12:28] a bunch of different people who have had
[2:12:30] dreams about people the past loved ones
[2:12:32] who have gone on before us and how Vivid
[2:12:36] the dreams are about about what they're
[2:12:38] wearing about what they say about how
[2:12:42] they say it I've heard many accounts of
[2:12:45] that in the last probably decade of
[2:12:47] loved ones who have gone on I believe
[2:12:49] it's for a purpose brothers and sisters
[2:12:51] we know the word of God says that the
[2:12:52] old men will dream dreams and the young
[2:12:54] men will see Visions that's not too far
[2:12:56] off the truth that's the word of God and
[2:12:58] we should be able to hear that stuff
[2:13:00] without being freaked out about it oh my
[2:13:02] that that brother is getting a little
[2:13:03] bit fundamental for me you know what
[2:13:05] brother Bradham talks about there's two
[2:13:06] two types of people in this world he
[2:13:08] said he traveled the whole world and he
[2:13:09] said there's the fundamentals they
[2:13:11] understand all the word and I would say
[2:13:12] we could bring it right down to where we
[2:13:14] live brothers and sisters and we'll say
[2:13:15] there's a fundamental message believers
[2:13:17] they know all the quotes they understand
[2:13:19] the church age book they they could
[2:13:21] quote quotes up and down inside and out
[2:13:23] they know it all they've got a perfect
[2:13:25] record with church a perfect life
[2:13:27] everything is fundamental with them
[2:13:30] but they're cold
[2:13:31] informal
[2:13:34] and Powerless
[2:13:35] brother Branham talks about the other
[2:13:37] ones who are the Pentecostals the
[2:13:39] Pentecostals boy oh boy they like to get
[2:13:41] down they like to praise God they love
[2:13:44] to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ but you
[2:13:46] know what the the morals aren't there
[2:13:48] they don't have the fundamentals down
[2:13:50] maybe the women wear pants and and they
[2:13:52] have cut hair and and boy oh boy can
[2:13:55] they sing like Angels they can do all
[2:13:57] manner of goodness they can they can
[2:13:59] really really worship God they have the
[2:14:02] power of God maybe they speak in tongues
[2:14:04] and they interpret in their services
[2:14:05] they see the mighty moving of God
[2:14:10] but they don't have the faith
[2:14:11] to activate it
[2:14:13] brother Branham talks about it how the
[2:14:15] fundamentals and the Pentecostals if you
[2:14:17] could just get those two together one
[2:14:18] time
[2:14:19] if you could just bring them together
[2:14:20] one time it would be like the the man
[2:14:22] who's got a checkbook but but can write
[2:14:25] a check but he's got no money in the
[2:14:27] bank
[2:14:28] but then you've got someone who's got a
[2:14:30] bank account that's so full he could
[2:14:32] never spend at all
[2:14:34] but he doesn't have a checkbook or he
[2:14:35] has a checkbook and he just doesn't know
[2:14:36] how to write the check maybe he's
[2:14:38] illiterate but boy if you could get
[2:14:40] someone who could write that check for
[2:14:43] that account that knows that God will
[2:14:45] actually pay that bill
[2:14:47] my goodness what would happen
[2:14:50] but that's the word that we're lit
[2:14:52] that's what the world that we're living
[2:14:53] in brothers and sisters this world is
[2:14:54] falling apart all around us but as this
[2:14:56] world falls apart and we know all of
[2:14:58] these different groups and movements
[2:14:59] they gain strength and they gain
[2:15:01] momentum and they're they're growing
[2:15:03] into positions where it can be pretty
[2:15:05] scary for us as Believers to look around
[2:15:07] and think this is the world that we live
[2:15:08] in but goodness sakes what's happening
[2:15:11] to the Bride of Jesus Christ the devil
[2:15:13] wants us to think nothing's happening to
[2:15:14] the bride the bride is just just just
[2:15:16] being suppressed and she's going to be
[2:15:18] squished into a corner and one day she's
[2:15:20] going to have to have the third pole
[2:15:21] manifestation and nothing's happening
[2:15:23] but I'll tell you that's a lie of the
[2:15:24] devil the bride is in the midst of the
[2:15:26] greatest Revival that she's ever had she
[2:15:29] knows that her time is short she knows
[2:15:31] that the resurrection and Rapture is at
[2:15:34] hand this is about the word to the word
[2:15:36] the word that was predestinated from
[2:15:39] before the foundation of the world to be
[2:15:41] spoken through a Vindicated Prophet to
[2:15:43] the word see Gene of God inside the
[2:15:46] heart of the believer to say Amen to
[2:15:49] that word and what happened is when that
[2:15:51] happens you come forth from the grave
[2:15:53] just like Lazarus we know that brother
[2:15:55] Bradham said very clearly that he had to
[2:15:57] say Lazarus he didn't say just come
[2:15:59] forth with a loud voice he didn't put
[2:16:02] his shoulders back the way he said that
[2:16:03] and say come forth because if he did
[2:16:05] that knowing who he was the General
[2:16:07] Resurrection would have happened but he
[2:16:09] had to call him by name and isn't it
[2:16:11] wonderful to think brothers and sisters
[2:16:12] that he's still calling by name he's
[2:16:15] still doing it and when he does you come
[2:16:17] forth from that grave that you were in
[2:16:19] that Sepulcher that you were Bound in
[2:16:21] Traditions and ideas and teachings and
[2:16:24] you say be it unto me according to Thy
[2:16:27] word I'm not interested in what my
[2:16:28] forefathers did I'm not interested in my
[2:16:30] brothers and sisters I want to see them
[2:16:32] all saved but I'm only interested in
[2:16:33] what God's showing me right now my
[2:16:36] goodness
[2:16:38] think about that in Lazarus life in the
[2:16:40] sisters where we're saying Jesus if you
[2:16:42] would only have been here and he said
[2:16:44] you know what I came to tell you that I
[2:16:46] I didn't I tell you that you would see
[2:16:48] the power of God the manifestation of
[2:16:50] God
[2:16:52] my and then he said the distinctive
[2:16:55] words I am
[2:16:57] same words he said to Moses same words
[2:17:00] he said all over the place in the Bible
[2:17:02] I am I am the resurrection and the life
[2:17:06] who could say those words oh my goodness
[2:17:11] my goodness
[2:17:14] I believe that we could get into our
[2:17:16] text now start preaching goodness
[2:17:19] you know I just can't help but think how
[2:17:22] that angel came
[2:17:24] in in in our scripture this morning that
[2:17:26] we read in Matthew chapter 28.
[2:17:30] that angel came
[2:17:32] and rolled away the stone
[2:17:34] Jesus told the people the same thing
[2:17:37] in The Story of Lazarus he said roll
[2:17:39] away the stone walked up to it and and
[2:17:41] said roll away the stone I can't help
[2:17:43] but think that he said the same exact
[2:17:45] words to the angels
[2:17:47] roll away that stone and the angel came
[2:17:50] down from heaven and rolled that stone
[2:17:52] away and isn't it wonderful to think
[2:17:55] that we have had that same thing happen
[2:17:56] in our day we've had an angel come down
[2:17:59] an angel messenger and our day come down
[2:18:01] and roll that stone away roll that stone
[2:18:04] away break that seal of man break all of
[2:18:07] the traditions and ideas that we have
[2:18:09] and give us the ability to see inside
[2:18:11] the proof isn't it wonderful to think
[2:18:14] that we've been given that proof and not
[2:18:16] just that that proof is that he rose
[2:18:18] from the grave oh my that that up from
[2:18:21] the grave he arose a mighty triumph over
[2:18:24] his foes to think that every single one
[2:18:27] who was against him had to now see the
[2:18:30] proof they had to see that what he said
[2:18:33] was true that all the promises in the
[2:18:36] Bible was now culminating in the life
[2:18:38] that quickening power of Romans chapter
[2:18:41] 8 verse 11 but it was only an angel that
[2:18:45] could reveal what was inside
[2:18:47] they had set a guard they had set a seal
[2:18:49] they made sure that Sepulcher was sure
[2:18:52] right
[2:18:53] pilate told him make it as sure as he
[2:18:55] can
[2:18:56] because those unbelievers believed
[2:18:59] they knew something was going to happen
[2:19:01] so they had to go and do that and isn't
[2:19:03] it interesting brothers and sisters that
[2:19:05] what happened was when he did come forth
[2:19:07] out of the grave and those soldiers went
[2:19:10] back they didn't go back to pilate they
[2:19:12] knew better than that they went back to
[2:19:14] the high priest trembling and the
[2:19:16] trembling soldiers told the high priest
[2:19:19] what happened
[2:19:20] an angel was there and he's gone and
[2:19:22] they said oh no it can't be we we knew
[2:19:25] that was going to happen and the Bible
[2:19:27] says they gave them big money
[2:19:30] to shut their mouths and the Bible says
[2:19:32] that that story still stands today
[2:19:35] they still believe the same story that
[2:19:37] that go and take this money and just go
[2:19:40] and tell everyone who asks that his
[2:19:41] disciples came and and and and broke the
[2:19:44] seal and pushed back the stone and and
[2:19:45] took his body and said that he
[2:19:47] resurrected can you imagine that it's
[2:19:49] like stealing it's so much easier just
[2:19:52] to get a job if you just get a job and
[2:19:55] get a paycheck you could live
[2:19:57] comfortably without fear but here they
[2:20:00] are spinning a Web of Lies continually
[2:20:03] trying to cover up what truly happened
[2:20:06] but I believe in their heart of hearts
[2:20:08] they knew what was going to happen they
[2:20:10] knew full well that he was coming
[2:20:11] forward from that grave
[2:20:13] but it took an angel to reveal it
[2:20:16] yeah brother Bradham he says this
[2:20:17] there's two classes of people he says
[2:20:18] I've always said
[2:20:20] excuse me
[2:20:21] I met two classes of people the
[2:20:23] fundamentals and the Pentecostals the
[2:20:24] fundamentals positionally studies the
[2:20:26] scriptures and figure it out
[2:20:28] they say well we are sons of God
[2:20:31] they believe that yes sir that they
[2:20:33] don't have any faith with it
[2:20:35] the Pentecostals has a lot of faith and
[2:20:38] they don't know their sons of God I
[2:20:39] apologize I think I said the faith on
[2:20:41] the Pentecostal side
[2:20:42] I uh I got that wrong
[2:20:45] Pentecostals has a lot of faith they
[2:20:47] don't know they're sons of God like a
[2:20:48] man got money in the bank can't write a
[2:20:50] check and the other one can the other
[2:20:52] one
[2:20:53] can write a check but got no money in
[2:20:55] the bank if you could ever just get the
[2:20:56] the thing together he says till men and
[2:20:59] women could realize you that's been
[2:21:01] truly baptized into the Holy Spirit and
[2:21:04] you have the token to display you have a
[2:21:08] right to every Redemptive blessings that
[2:21:11] God's promised everything that he
[2:21:13] promised is yours
[2:21:15] I love how he says this too brothers and
[2:21:17] sisters that's why we have to have the
[2:21:18] Holy Ghost that's what the token is
[2:21:20] that's what he's talking about here
[2:21:21] everything he promised is yours
[2:21:25] hold your token over your unwavering
[2:21:29] Faith as you pray and over his word
[2:21:33] faith in his word so brothers and
[2:21:36] sisters when we go to prayer for
[2:21:37] something when we are praying for
[2:21:39] something that we need for someone that
[2:21:41] we love for a situation that's occurred
[2:21:44] when we're praying for that every single
[2:21:46] promise is actually ours
[2:21:49] but hold that Faith over it don't say
[2:21:51] that I've got faith and I'm just going
[2:21:53] to take it and hold it I've got a token
[2:21:54] I'm just going to hold it say Lord Jesus
[2:21:57] come and pray for me come and intercede
[2:22:00] for me you're the Holy Spirit
[2:22:03] I love how brother Emmanuel said that he
[2:22:05] said you know if we go looking for Jesus
[2:22:07] we need to look for Jesus on the inside
[2:22:09] we need to see his deeds in our lives
[2:22:11] but when we have his deeds living out
[2:22:13] through us then we can bear witness of
[2:22:15] that life of that quickening power but
[2:22:18] unless we're willing to go through and
[2:22:19] weed the garden and take a look inside
[2:22:21] our life we might not be able to see him
[2:22:24] but boy once we see him once we're able
[2:22:26] to show him to the world around us
[2:22:29] people take notice
[2:22:33] whether about him in the rising of the
[2:22:34] Sun
[2:22:35] it brought your body not well you say
[2:22:37] well not let me tell you something my
[2:22:39] pastor I don't care what your pastor
[2:22:41] says
[2:22:42] he says it pretty straight it's what the
[2:22:45] word says
[2:22:47] and I would say it this way too don't
[2:22:48] care what I say if I'm your pastor don't
[2:22:50] care what I say if I'm off the word care
[2:22:53] what the word says
[2:22:55] only what the word says if a pastor
[2:22:58] anywhere if a minister anywhere if
[2:23:00] anybody anywhere ever says anything
[2:23:01] that's off of the word take the word
[2:23:05] don't take their word
[2:23:07] if you want to be a chicken go on with
[2:23:10] him but if the pastor speaks different
[2:23:11] from this word then he's not a feeder of
[2:23:14] the Eagles
[2:23:15] he's a feeder of the Hennessy not of the
[2:23:18] Eagles
[2:23:20] eats On Eagle's food see
[2:23:23] I believe we've just had an abundance of
[2:23:25] Eagle food this week the Lord's been so
[2:23:28] good to us
[2:23:31] he said Eagle eats On Eagle's food see
[2:23:33] they're clean the Bible said it's wrong
[2:23:35] to do that
[2:23:36] and the men and so forth and that's what
[2:23:39] all you do that's wrong say the days of
[2:23:41] Miracles has passed
[2:23:43] this Bible said he's the same yesterday
[2:23:45] today and forever
[2:23:47] if they say that's a mental telepathy
[2:23:50] and it's some kind of a mind reading
[2:23:52] this discernment and all these visions
[2:23:54] and things is nonsense see
[2:23:57] they are chickens
[2:24:00] and I can't help but what brother
[2:24:01] Branham talking like this to think that
[2:24:03] they're not just chickens in terms of
[2:24:04] you know clucking hens on the ground and
[2:24:06] scratching through the manure and and
[2:24:08] looking for the seeds and maybe the food
[2:24:10] scraps that get thrown out to them
[2:24:12] they're not just chickens that way but
[2:24:14] they're afraid
[2:24:15] you ever deal with a chicken
[2:24:17] man you can have a chicken that you
[2:24:19] raise from an egg a chick we have one
[2:24:23] called pip
[2:24:24] we raised them from an egg from an
[2:24:26] incubator he didn't have a mama didn't
[2:24:28] have a papa just had an incubator
[2:24:30] and we were his mama and his papa he
[2:24:33] comes into the world and here we have
[2:24:35] this chicken and we feed them and we
[2:24:37] look after him we water him we do all
[2:24:39] the things for him we feed them water
[2:24:41] them and make sure that he's looked
[2:24:42] after and you still you go close to him
[2:24:45] and he freaks out and runs away like
[2:24:46] you're gonna harm him
[2:24:48] and as a human being you kind of take it
[2:24:50] personal thinking my goodness don't you
[2:24:52] understand I want to actually help you
[2:24:55] but he's a chicken and he can only ever
[2:24:58] behave like a chicken and I can't help
[2:25:00] but think brother Branham he's talking
[2:25:01] about them being afraid of This Promise
[2:25:04] in the word of God
[2:25:06] people are afraid to see this Dynamic
[2:25:08] power in their lives because you're not
[2:25:11] going to act normal you're not going to
[2:25:12] be quiet you're not going to be calm
[2:25:14] brother Bradham says you're not going to
[2:25:16] sit like a dried up old stick in a
[2:25:18] service you're going to worship God
[2:25:20] because you know that you're redeemed
[2:25:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:25:27] forever
[2:25:28] if they say that's all a mental
[2:25:30] telepathy and some kind of mind reading
[2:25:31] this discernment and all these visions
[2:25:34] and things is nonsense see they're
[2:25:36] chickens they don't know what Eagle food
[2:25:38] is but brother when you hear that scream
[2:25:40] there's something inside of you you're
[2:25:42] an eagle to begin with not everyone can
[2:25:45] hear the word for their day not everyone
[2:25:48] believed that it would rain in Noah's
[2:25:50] day the prophet in our day said they had
[2:25:52] Rockets scientific achievement to send
[2:25:54] Rockets into the atmosphere to prove
[2:25:56] that Noah was wrong
[2:25:57] and there's people that would say you
[2:25:59] know what the doctor's report says that
[2:26:01] this disease is actually going to
[2:26:03] overwhelm me and there's nothing that
[2:26:05] anybody can ever do about it now whose
[2:26:07] report are we going to believe are we
[2:26:08] going to believe the word of God are we
[2:26:10] going to believe the doctor's report
[2:26:12] because whose report we believe is what
[2:26:14] will happen
[2:26:17] I just can't help but think that he's
[2:26:19] identified by his deeds and our lives
[2:26:21] and the life that we live we're going to
[2:26:23] express his life we're going to express
[2:26:25] the life that's inside of us brothers
[2:26:27] and sisters we can't hide it if we've
[2:26:29] got the Holy Ghost in our life we're
[2:26:30] going to express the Holy Ghost in our
[2:26:31] life brother Bradham said it if you've
[2:26:33] got the spirit of Dillinger inside of
[2:26:35] you you're going to be like Dillinger
[2:26:37] was if you've got the spirit of
[2:26:39] Beethoven inside of you you're going to
[2:26:41] compose and play like Beethoven did but
[2:26:44] if you've got the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:26:46] in you then you've seen his works in the
[2:26:49] Bible as we heard last night he's
[2:26:51] identified by his deeds
[2:26:54] well there's a Bible question there has
[2:26:56] to be a Bible answer
[2:26:57] [Laughter]
[2:26:58] I just thought it was so beautiful how
[2:27:00] brother Emanuel brought the the days
[2:27:02] three days and three nights how that
[2:27:03] could be just beautiful
[2:27:06] and you know that life in the Tomb is
[2:27:09] not where where life ends it's where it
[2:27:11] begins that's the beginning of life it's
[2:27:14] the dying out as brother Mervin brought
[2:27:16] and that that chart that shows the cycle
[2:27:19] of the seed you know what the seed is
[2:27:21] not the final part the dying out of that
[2:27:23] seed is the final part but what that is
[2:27:25] is the beginning and it's the same thing
[2:27:28] as the first day of the week as we read
[2:27:30] in here when they ran to the Sepulcher
[2:27:32] to see did it happen did he come to life
[2:27:35] did he come back as he said he would
[2:27:37] there was something inside of a few of
[2:27:40] them that really wanted to believe
[2:27:42] but who says those things and let alone
[2:27:44] says them but who does them who who goes
[2:27:47] and gets killed and then comes back to
[2:27:48] life
[2:27:49] I don't think I've ever thought about
[2:27:51] the Easter
[2:27:52] Story the way that I have this year just
[2:27:55] to think about how that must have
[2:27:57] disrupted all of the disciples lives
[2:27:59] everything that they thought they knew
[2:28:01] and and believed all that that they
[2:28:04] understood about this man Jesus what it
[2:28:07] must have been like for Mary to see her
[2:28:09] son the one that she was promised by the
[2:28:11] angel to see him destroyed by Man by the
[2:28:14] most religious people and Peter the most
[2:28:16] fervent of the day but told you know
[2:28:19] what before the crows you're gonna
[2:28:22] you're gonna you're gonna oh my three
[2:28:25] times you are going to disown me you are
[2:28:28] going to not be associated with me three
[2:28:31] times
[2:28:32] Peter
[2:28:33] and what it must have been like when
[2:28:35] they had that conversation at one point
[2:28:37] we were talking about that last night
[2:28:37] after service it's tremendous it was
[2:28:40] Peter that was speaking no no no Lord
[2:28:41] I'm not going to let them come after you
[2:28:42] I'm not going to let them have a piece
[2:28:43] of you and what does Jesus do he turns
[2:28:46] to him and he says get thee behind me
[2:28:47] Satan you're an offense you you know
[2:28:49] that the word has to come to pass he
[2:28:51] could identify who was speaking in that
[2:28:53] man
[2:28:54] but what must it have been like they
[2:28:55] must have said oh that's the one who's
[2:28:57] going to betray him right but then we
[2:29:00] heard brother Emmanuel he brought it
[2:29:01] last night that's why we're having this
[2:29:02] conversation because he said go tell my
[2:29:05] disciples and Peter that I've risen go
[2:29:08] tell him
[2:29:09] he's never ever going to be not one of
[2:29:12] the twelve
[2:29:14] I just think it's so beautiful
[2:29:16] what a tremendous thing you know in in
[2:29:19] in John 14 Jesus says to them he says
[2:29:22] let not your hearts be troubled you
[2:29:25] believe in God believe also in me
[2:29:27] in my father's house or many mansions if
[2:29:30] it were not so I would have told you I
[2:29:32] go to prepare a place for you and if I
[2:29:34] go to prepare a place for you I will
[2:29:36] come again and receive you unto myself
[2:29:39] that where I am there ye may be also and
[2:29:44] whether I go ye know and the way you
[2:29:47] know
[2:29:48] and I just can't help but think that's
[2:29:50] the promise waiting for us brothers and
[2:29:52] sisters the day in which we live in in
[2:29:54] his house are many mansions brother
[2:29:57] Branham he says very clearly in the
[2:29:59] message of the hour 1965 that means many
[2:30:01] kinds of mansions because we're all
[2:30:03] different people some people like the
[2:30:05] ocean he said some people like the
[2:30:07] desert some people like the Foothills
[2:30:09] some people like like wherever different
[2:30:13] places different desires different
[2:30:15] people a variety of likes in in the body
[2:30:19] of Christ and and he's gone away to
[2:30:22] create a place for us to go to that we
[2:30:24] will not just maybe appreciate a little
[2:30:26] bit we'll be thrilled with and I just
[2:30:28] can't help but think of the story
[2:30:29] brother Branham talks about where he
[2:30:31] actually goes into that vision goes into
[2:30:34] that dream this is when he's telling his
[2:30:37] life story he talks about seeing that
[2:30:38] broken down wagon with a broken wheel
[2:30:41] and he says that that represents his
[2:30:42] family and then he sees that little girl
[2:30:45] and and he's like wow she's a fine young
[2:30:47] woman and and he she says hi Daddy
[2:30:51] and he's like Daddy who are you
[2:30:54] and she says don't you don't you
[2:30:55] recognize me Daddy
[2:30:57] I'm that one that you saw go cross-eyed
[2:31:00] with flies in my eyes because of the
[2:31:02] disease when when God brought that sheet
[2:31:05] down over top of your prayers and said
[2:31:07] that you're not going to be healed and
[2:31:08] that greatest battle that you ever
[2:31:09] fought where the devil came around and
[2:31:12] said you could heal everyone around look
[2:31:13] at the great healing campaigns you've
[2:31:15] done you got out and made a fool of
[2:31:16] yourself till one in the morning on the
[2:31:18] street corners preaching this gospel up
[2:31:20] and down in the Earth all around the
[2:31:22] world and he won't heal your wife or
[2:31:24] your daughter
[2:31:25] the greatest battle that he ever fought
[2:31:28] when he said though he slay me and I'll
[2:31:31] served him
[2:31:32] you can't touch me Satan the desire in
[2:31:34] his heart was to serve him he he was
[2:31:36] identified by his deeds even in his
[2:31:39] greatest trial but he sees this girl and
[2:31:42] she says hi Daddy
[2:31:44] he says if you're my daughter
[2:31:46] if you're Rebecca then where's Mama
[2:31:48] where's Mama and she says she's up in
[2:31:51] the house he says the house she says
[2:31:53] yeah Daddy we got a house right up there
[2:31:55] and he goes running up the stairs and he
[2:31:58] goes into the house it's a real place
[2:32:00] brothers and sisters he goes into the
[2:32:02] house and what does he see the chair
[2:32:03] that they took from his house because
[2:32:06] they couldn't afford the payments while
[2:32:08] he was laying his life down for the
[2:32:09] kingdom of God putting his money into
[2:32:11] the Tabernacle that people now go to but
[2:32:14] but here he sees that chair
[2:32:17] that they had and remember the story of
[2:32:20] how they came and took the chair and his
[2:32:21] wife knew they were coming they couldn't
[2:32:22] afford the payments and she did what a
[2:32:25] wife would do to try and distract him
[2:32:26] bake him a pie try and distract him
[2:32:29] maybe we should go fishing tonight honey
[2:32:30] knowing that they're coming to get the
[2:32:32] chair he tells the story it's
[2:32:34] heart-wrenching to think about but here
[2:32:36] he is and she says don't worry about us
[2:32:38] we're fine we're in that mansion that he
[2:32:41] talked about in John that place that's
[2:32:44] promised that he's gone away to make for
[2:32:46] us
[2:32:47] brothers and sisters we have a place
[2:32:49] waiting for us too
[2:32:51] in John 16 verse 7 nevertheless I tell
[2:32:54] you the truth it's expedient for you
[2:32:56] that I go away for if I go not away
[2:33:00] the comforter will not come unto you but
[2:33:04] if I depart I will send him unto you
[2:33:08] brothers and sisters that's where we are
[2:33:10] today he has sent that comforter hasn't
[2:33:13] he don't we have that Comfort to know
[2:33:16] that we have the ability to receive the
[2:33:18] word in our day it's not a mighty sign
[2:33:20] or a Wonder because we believe the
[2:33:22] message of the hour We're Not Looking
[2:33:24] for great prayer lines and and we'll
[2:33:26] have we'll have special services like we
[2:33:29] did but we'll just get fed Eagle food
[2:33:31] and we'll just Worship the Lord we're
[2:33:34] not looking for great signs and wonders
[2:33:36] to come out of it we don't know what
[2:33:38] will happen
[2:33:40] I just can't help but to read a few more
[2:33:43] things if you're okay for a few minutes
[2:33:44] here you know First Corinthians 15 45
[2:33:48] and so it is written the first man Adam
[2:33:50] was made a living soul and the last Adam
[2:33:54] was made a quickening spirit
[2:33:57] this is where it gets good for us
[2:33:59] brothers and sisters how be it that was
[2:34:01] not first which is spiritual but that
[2:34:04] which is natural and afterward that
[2:34:07] which is spiritual
[2:34:09] it was the man that went into the grave
[2:34:12] but it was the spirit that quickening
[2:34:14] Spirit of Romans 8 11 that brought that
[2:34:16] man out of the grave the first man is
[2:34:19] the Earth is of the earth earthy
[2:34:22] the second man is of the Lord From
[2:34:25] Heaven
[2:34:27] as is the earthy
[2:34:29] such are they also that are earthy
[2:34:33] and as is the Heavenly such are they
[2:34:37] also that are heavenly
[2:34:40] you know
[2:34:41] out of the abundance of the heart the
[2:34:43] mouth speaketh where where
[2:34:45] our heart is that's where our treasure
[2:34:47] is where where we dwell brothers and
[2:34:50] sisters that's really Who We Are
[2:34:54] and if we're feeding on this word if
[2:34:55] we're dwelling on this word if we're
[2:34:57] recognizing our position in Christ Jesus
[2:35:00] then brothers and sisters nothing can
[2:35:02] stop us
[2:35:03] nothing can stop us the Gates of Hell
[2:35:05] cannot Prevail against that Revelation
[2:35:08] that we've been given
[2:35:10] out of the rising of the sun brother
[2:35:11] Bradham says this then this Earthly body
[2:35:14] is quickened and brought by the
[2:35:16] quickening spirit of God to obedience to
[2:35:20] the word of God
[2:35:22] this is where he says it brothers and
[2:35:24] sisters it's so Crystal Clear here this
[2:35:26] then this Earthly body this body here is
[2:35:30] quickened by Romans 8 11 by that same
[2:35:33] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[2:35:35] it gets inside of us and it quickens us
[2:35:37] but it doesn't Quicken us to a
[2:35:39] resurrection and Rapture although it
[2:35:41] will one day
[2:35:42] doesn't Quicken us to come out of the
[2:35:43] Grave before it's time we could all wind
[2:35:45] up in the grave who knows what tomorrow
[2:35:47] holds in store we don't know
[2:35:50] but once we're there there's something
[2:35:52] that's going to change our bodies it's
[2:35:54] that quickening spirit I can't help but
[2:35:56] throw this in there brother Bradham says
[2:35:58] it very clearly in the Easter seal the
[2:36:01] quickening power never loses its power
[2:36:03] it never ever loses its power and so
[2:36:06] much so that they threw a dead man in on
[2:36:10] the bones of a prophet one time didn't
[2:36:12] they they saw the enemy coming and they
[2:36:14] threw him in there on the bones and what
[2:36:16] happened that quickening power overtook
[2:36:18] him it pulled his his soul right back
[2:36:21] from wherever he was in the regions
[2:36:23] Beyond
[2:36:25] brother Branham says this then this
[2:36:26] Earthly body is quickened and brought by
[2:36:29] the quickening spirit to
[2:36:32] spirit of God sorry to obedience to the
[2:36:36] word of God quickly
[2:36:38] when he wanted to know how he could get
[2:36:40] there with her talking about the eagle
[2:36:42] he'd been taught he couldn't do that you
[2:36:45] can't jump you can't you can't flap your
[2:36:46] wings you can't get excited and go a
[2:36:49] little higher brothers and sisters I
[2:36:51] would that everyone would get a little
[2:36:52] bit excited and go a little bit higher
[2:36:54] don't don't stay stay on the ground flap
[2:36:57] your wings and allow that that
[2:36:59] quickening power to take over and just
[2:37:01] see what happens
[2:37:03] he says when he wanted to know he could
[2:37:05] get there with her he'd been taught he
[2:37:07] couldn't do that you can't jump no
[2:37:09] higher than you can jump you can't get
[2:37:11] no higher than you can jump sorry see
[2:37:13] he's a chicken see but this ego said
[2:37:16] that's not so
[2:37:19] well look at the chickens no matter what
[2:37:21] the chickens are you're an eagle
[2:37:24] just start spreading those wings and get
[2:37:26] a little exercise in them brothers and
[2:37:29] sisters I can't help but think the the
[2:37:31] chickens are the spectators the Eagles
[2:37:33] are the players
[2:37:35] the players are going to be the ones
[2:37:37] that jump the players are going to be
[2:37:39] the ones that live by faith the players
[2:37:41] are going to be the ones that say Hey I
[2:37:42] think God wants me to move somewhere he
[2:37:44] wants me to do something different with
[2:37:45] my life is there a church there because
[2:37:47] if there's not a church there I don't
[2:37:49] know if I want to go there it's going to
[2:37:50] be something inside of them that wants
[2:37:52] to follow the word of God we become
[2:37:54] quickened to the word of God not quick
[2:37:56] into an idea
[2:37:59] well look at those chickens no matter
[2:38:00] what the chickens are your ego just
[2:38:02] starts spreading those wings and get a
[2:38:04] little exercise in them start moving up
[2:38:06] to the word to the word
[2:38:09] here he says it again to the word to the
[2:38:12] word brothers and sisters I want to say
[2:38:14] it if we if we have an idea that we just
[2:38:17] can't raise our hands and just sing to
[2:38:19] God and maybe Sway and dance and and
[2:38:22] Shout just just try it one time brother
[2:38:25] Bradham is saying it just try it one
[2:38:27] time raise your hands to God and see if
[2:38:29] he doesn't pour out a blessing on you
[2:38:31] that you can't even contain don't say
[2:38:33] it's my Canadian tradition it's my
[2:38:35] whatever tradition if that's the way it
[2:38:37] is brothers and sisters allow his Spirit
[2:38:39] to come into you and see if you won't
[2:38:42] see a difference he says no matter what
[2:38:44] the chickens are you're an eagle just
[2:38:45] start spreading those wings and get a
[2:38:47] little exercise in them there's been
[2:38:49] times in my life where I raise my hands
[2:38:50] and I get sore shoulders and you know
[2:38:52] what I want to do I want to press into
[2:38:54] it and say oh I don't want to lift
[2:38:56] weights I want to praise God you know
[2:38:58] brother Branham said it a man isn't
[2:39:00] known by the muscles in his arms or his
[2:39:02] body a man is known by the bags in his
[2:39:05] knees from the prayer life that he has
[2:39:07] with God
[2:39:08] it's not the way we suppose
[2:39:11] start moving up the word to the word
[2:39:15] when that word comes to the word inside
[2:39:18] of us something happens to us we flap
[2:39:22] our wings and we go a little higher and
[2:39:24] what he's talking about is higher in
[2:39:25] Revelation higher in Christ higher in
[2:39:27] understanding the things of the message
[2:39:30] of the hour The Works that I do shall
[2:39:33] you also he that believeth in me the
[2:39:35] works that I do shall he also see
[2:39:38] because I live he lives also and if the
[2:39:40] spirit that raised up him from the dead
[2:39:42] dwells in you it quickens your mortal
[2:39:45] body but it doesn't Quicken us the way
[2:39:47] we maybe we think it's going to Quicken
[2:39:49] us to come out of the Grave Just Like
[2:39:50] Jesus did one day it might one day it
[2:39:52] will if we don't actually go into Sky
[2:39:54] we're going to be in the grave we know
[2:39:56] we have this this Blessed assurance that
[2:40:00] Jesus is mine brother Branham talks
[2:40:01] about that talking to the life insurance
[2:40:03] salesman we have that assurance that if
[2:40:06] we get into the graveyard it's going to
[2:40:07] get us out of their life insurance won't
[2:40:08] get us out of the graveyard
[2:40:10] but his quickening spirit will get us
[2:40:12] out of the graveyard we have that
[2:40:14] Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine
[2:40:17] I just can't help but think brothers and
[2:40:19] sisters believe us thou this my goodness
[2:40:22] what a tremendous time
[2:40:25] I'm just going to read this scripture
[2:40:27] I'll call the uh the musicians I just
[2:40:30] want to say this as we close
[2:40:32] the meetings for this week
[2:40:36] talking about the original messenger
[2:40:40] to the Gentile Church brothers and
[2:40:42] sisters
[2:40:43] Paul speaking to the church
[2:40:47] we follow the teachings of Paul
[2:40:51] some folks might say that we just follow
[2:40:53] the teachings of William Branham
[2:40:56] but if you take a look at what William
[2:40:57] brownham preached
[2:40:59] he preached what Paul preached
[2:41:02] and when he went beyond the curtain of
[2:41:04] time and he saw that vision of all those
[2:41:06] people over there
[2:41:08] he told that angel do I have to be
[2:41:11] judged with my people
[2:41:14] the angel said yep that voice yep you do
[2:41:18] and he said oh my
[2:41:19] well if Paul's people have to be judged
[2:41:22] then I I preached what Paul preached
[2:41:24] and that's what we believe we believe
[2:41:26] what Paul preached but in what he said
[2:41:28] to the Philippians maybe stand with me
[2:41:29] as we close this morning Philippians 3
[2:41:31] verse 7.
[2:41:34] but what things were gained to me those
[2:41:37] I counted lost for Christ
[2:41:41] as a believer of this word there comes a
[2:41:44] point where we have to say I'm going to
[2:41:46] get into shaky Waters I might get into a
[2:41:49] place that's beyond where I've always
[2:41:51] been I'm going to step into a place that
[2:41:54] that's going to require more faith
[2:41:56] brother Branham says we need more faith
[2:41:57] now than any other age
[2:42:00] we're going where no one has ever gone
[2:42:02] before
[2:42:03] we're going to see things that no one
[2:42:05] has ever seen before
[2:42:06] because nobody in in the Gentile church
[2:42:09] has ever been where we are today
[2:42:11] but you know I believe it with all my
[2:42:13] heart brothers and sisters just because
[2:42:14] nobody's gone there doesn't mean we need
[2:42:16] to be chickens
[2:42:18] we don't need to be afraid
[2:42:20] we can have full confidence
[2:42:22] because we know just like Joshua was
[2:42:25] commissioned we've been commissioned as
[2:42:26] well we've been commissioned to go all
[2:42:28] the way to cross right over Jordan and
[2:42:30] we know that means to go on to the New
[2:42:32] Birth means to go into our Promised Land
[2:42:34] which is Christ but here we have Paul
[2:42:36] saying to the Philippians but what
[2:42:38] things I uh things were gained to me
[2:42:41] those I counted for loss accounted loss
[2:42:44] for Christ yea doubtless and I count all
[2:42:48] things but loss for the Excellency of
[2:42:51] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[2:42:55] I just can't help but think that's
[2:42:57] exactly what brother Bradham was saying
[2:42:58] the word to the word
[2:43:00] the knowledge
[2:43:01] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've
[2:43:04] suffered the loss of all things and do
[2:43:07] count them but done that I may win
[2:43:10] Christ
[2:43:11] and be found in him not having mine own
[2:43:14] righteousness
[2:43:16] which is of the law
[2:43:18] but that which is through the Faith of
[2:43:21] Christ
[2:43:22] the righteousness which is of god by
[2:43:25] faith
[2:43:26] we know there's coming a time in the
[2:43:28] life of every single believer where it's
[2:43:30] no longer our faith where it becomes his
[2:43:32] faith living out through us and that's
[2:43:34] what that quickening Spirit does
[2:43:35] brothers and sisters it gives us a faith
[2:43:37] that's Supernatural to believe in these
[2:43:39] things that we're talking about to just
[2:43:40] understand that we can understand with
[2:43:43] our natural thinking we just have to
[2:43:45] have faith but it's his faith living out
[2:43:47] through US verse 10 says that I may know
[2:43:49] him and the power of his resurrection
[2:43:52] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[2:43:55] being made conformable unto his death
[2:44:00] I just think that's so powerful the
[2:44:02] power of his resurrection that's what we
[2:44:04] all desire but if any means
[2:44:07] if by any means I might attain unto the
[2:44:10] resurrection of the Dead
[2:44:12] not as though I had already attained
[2:44:13] either were already perfect
[2:44:16] none of us are perfect brothers and
[2:44:17] sisters except for that word that's
[2:44:18] inside of us when we say Amen to that
[2:44:20] word then we become perfected I follow
[2:44:22] after if that I may apprehend that for
[2:44:25] which I am all I am apprehended
[2:44:29] which also
[2:44:31] I am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[2:44:33] Brethren I count myself
[2:44:35] to have account not myself to have
[2:44:39] apprehended
[2:44:41] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[2:44:43] things which are behind
[2:44:44] and reaching forth unto those things
[2:44:46] which are before
[2:44:51] I just want to encourage us brothers and
[2:44:53] sisters verse 14.
[2:44:55] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[2:44:57] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:45:00] to consider the words that were spoken
[2:45:02] this week and just to recognize there's
[2:45:06] nothing that we could ever do except for
[2:45:08] say Amen to the word except for be able
[2:45:10] to believe the word but you know the
[2:45:13] ability to believe to truly believe this
[2:45:15] word is that greatest miracle
[2:45:18] that in itself is the greatest miracle
[2:45:21] if we truly believe it
[2:45:24] seeing a healing saying someone raised
[2:45:26] from the dead getting a big fat bank
[2:45:28] account or a big house
[2:45:30] all new clothes all of that
[2:45:33] is nothing it's all going to burn
[2:45:36] the only thing that we have is the
[2:45:38] ability to believe this word for our day
[2:45:41] and that's the holy ghost that is Jesus
[2:45:44] Christ the same yesterday today forever
[2:45:45] that's the quickening spirit if that
[2:45:47] same spirit that raised up Jesus from
[2:45:50] the dead that rolled away that stone
[2:45:53] dwells in you then it will Quicken your
[2:45:56] mortal body the word to the word I just
[2:46:00] want to suggest that maybe check that
[2:46:01] out look it up the word to the word it's
[2:46:04] a strange saying isn't it
[2:46:06] but maybe the Lord will just Quicken it
[2:46:08] to our spirit if we just study it a
[2:46:10] little bit God bless you today
[2:46:13] let's bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[2:46:15] we love you today we thank you for your
[2:46:18] Resurrection we thank you Lord Jesus
[2:46:20] that you were willing to come and die
[2:46:22] and take our place Lord that you became
[2:46:25] sin
[2:46:27] for our sake Lord
[2:46:28] oh Father we know that was the greatest
[2:46:31] oh
[2:46:33] it totally duped the devil he could not
[2:46:36] believe that you would condescend that
[2:46:38] far Lord Jesus
[2:46:41] it just makes me wonder how magnificent
[2:46:43] you really are
[2:46:46] and with our minds our finite Minds we
[2:46:48] have no way of really understanding that
[2:46:50] but Lord there's something in the heart
[2:46:53] of every single human being that desires
[2:46:56] to worship something and father you have
[2:46:59] made it so Crystal Clear to us as
[2:47:01] Believers we know who we believe
[2:47:05] We Know Who You Are and we thank you for
[2:47:08] the ability to recognize you in our day
[2:47:12] Lord Jesus I pray that you would just
[2:47:14] take the words that were spoken Lord
[2:47:16] this morning and this week father and
[2:47:18] that you would Quicken them to our
[2:47:20] spirit Lord that you would Quicken them
[2:47:22] to our bodies Lord to our minds and to
[2:47:25] our souls father that we would feed upon
[2:47:28] this word maybe just a little bit more
[2:47:30] than we have in the past father that
[2:47:32] maybe we would want to try just a little
[2:47:34] bit harder Lord Jesus maybe that we
[2:47:36] would just want to try and flap our
[2:47:38] wings as Eagles just a little more
[2:47:40] father or jump a little higher Lord
[2:47:43] Jesus just to see you we know the
[2:47:45] children of Israel they were in in
[2:47:47] bondage for 30 years longer than the
[2:47:50] promised Lord father I pray that your
[2:47:52] children would begin to cry out unto you
[2:47:55] father in this age that Lord perhaps we
[2:47:58] wouldn't go over time in this age Lord
[2:48:00] we know that you've already sent a
[2:48:03] deliverer
[2:48:04] but father
[2:48:05] even so come Lord Jesus
[2:48:08] we just asked that you would go with us
[2:48:10] as we go our separate ways father that
[2:48:12] you would be with those who were
[2:48:13] traveling that you would bring them back
[2:48:14] home safely at the appointed time father
[2:48:17] that you would just Lord if it's your
[2:48:19] will for us to gather together again on
[2:48:21] Wednesday Lord that we would be just
[2:48:22] careful to come and and consecrate
[2:48:25] ourselves unto you once again Lord we
[2:48:27] love you and we thank you and we just
[2:48:30] give you all the praise and all the
[2:48:31] glory of Our Lives Lord go with us now
[2:48:34] as we go our separate ways in Jesus
[2:48:36] Christ's name we pray
[2:48:38] amen amen
[2:48:40] amen
[2:48:44] if that same spirit
[2:48:47] that raised him from the dead if the
[2:48:51] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[2:48:55] dead dwells in you
[2:49:02] if the safe spirit that raised Christ
[2:49:07] from the dead

[2:51:41] from him
[2:51:43] sometimes we have many hurts in our
[2:51:45] lives and some doors we just don't ever
[2:51:47] want to open but he's not interested in
[2:51:49] leaving one door closed can we sing that
[2:51:51] song I surrender all as we close today
[2:51:54] as we're dismissed
[2:51:57] he's looking for total surrender 100
