[52:17] invite you Lord Jesus to have the
[52:19] preeminence in every aspect of this

[53:02] that I want to bring amen before we uh
[53:04] read a scripture here it's from Sister
[53:07] Stella and uh it says Brethren I'm
[53:10] thanking God for successful dedication
[53:12] of my baby Jordan today back home I want
[53:16] to thank the church to remember the
[53:19] mother Joy who is not feeling too well
[53:22] for God's healing and to the entire
[53:25] family God bless you all sister Stella
[53:28] amen we're certainly thankful for the
[53:30] healing touch of Our Lord we know that
[53:32] he is more than able amen if you have
[53:35] your Bibles this morning thank you
[53:37] musicians I'd like to read from
[53:39] Ephesians chapter
[53:42] 5 I'd also like to read from the book of
[53:44] Joshua when we get
[53:46] there um Lord willing Ephesians chapter
[53:50] five very familiar
[53:53] scripture I just uh I felt it impressed
[53:57] to uh maybe stir up our our Pure Minds
[54:00] by way of remembrance this morning and
[54:02] there's nothing better that can do it
[54:04] than the word of God Amen Ephesians chap
[54:08] 5 verse
[54:10] 21 we took this as a tremendous study of
[54:14] uh our position and our roles on
[54:16] Wednesday nights a little while ago
[54:19] verse 21 of Ephesians chapter 5 says
[54:21] submitting yourselves one to another in
[54:23] the fear of God wives so subit
[54:26] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[54:29] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[54:33] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[54:36] head of the church and he is the savior
[54:40] of the
[54:41] body therefore as the church is subject
[54:44] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[54:46] own husbands in
[54:49] every husbands love your wives even as
[54:54] Christ also love the church
[54:57] and gave himself for it remember
[54:59] brothers and sisters he didn't just come
[55:00] to church by giving himself for it he
[55:03] didn't just pay his tithes he didn't
[55:05] just put groceries in the fridge he
[55:06] didn't just pay the mortgage he didn't
[55:08] just teach his children he gave his life
[55:12] for his church and the word says that
[55:15] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[55:19] also loved the church and gave himself
[55:22] for it that he might sanctify and
[55:25] cleanse it with the washing
[55:27] of the Water by the
[55:29] word I just love this next verse that he
[55:32] might present it to who to himself a
[55:35] glorious church not having spot or
[55:37] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[55:39] should be holy and without blemish if we
[55:42] try and present ourselves to him it's
[55:45] with blemish and it's not holy it's
[55:49] religious so ought men to love their
[55:51] wives as their own
[55:53] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[55:57] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[55:59] own flesh oh my but nourisheth and
[56:03] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[56:07] church for we are members of his body of
[56:10] his flesh and of his bones for this
[56:14] cause shall a man leave his father and
[56:17] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[56:20] and they too shall be one
[56:24] flesh this is Paul speaking to the
[56:26] Ephesian church here we know that it's
[56:28] God speaking through his age Messenger
[56:31] to the church he says this is a great
[56:33] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[56:35] and the church Oh my he said so much
[56:39] about the natural husbands and wives but
[56:41] then he says no this is about a mystery
[56:43] this is something that pertains to more
[56:46] than just husbands and
[56:48] wives but then he says nevertheless let
[56:51] every one of you in particular so love
[56:55] his wife even as himself and the wife
[56:59] see that she reverence her husband amen
[57:02] let's just bow one more time gracious
[57:05] Heavenly Father we're so thankful for
[57:07] your word Lord and this morning we
[57:10] recognize that Lord you are the
[57:14] husband and Lord the called out church
[57:17] is your wife and if we are your wife
[57:20] Lord as the called out church then help
[57:22] us to reverence you
[57:23] today give us the strength Lord that we
[57:26] need to reverence you in
[57:29] every Lord Jesus we love you and we
[57:31] thank you we just want to commit this
[57:32] service into your hands now for your
[57:35] glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[57:37] amen God bless you this morning you may
[57:39] be
[57:41] seated just a couple of announcements
[57:43] before we get into the word here um we
[57:47] will be commencing with the vote for the
[57:50] church officers it's later than we've
[57:53] done in previous years and I do
[57:55] apologize for that
[57:57] but we will be commencing with that on
[57:58] the 1st of October which is I think a
[58:00] Tuesday this year the voting will
[58:03] commence on the 1st and it will close on
[58:05] the
[58:06] 4th and uh if you just watch for the
[58:09] email it will be just like the last
[58:11] couple that we've had from uh a proxy it
[58:14] will be an online vote so we have uh the
[58:17] church officers that have served in the
[58:19] past they are the same ones that desire
[58:21] to serve in the capacity that they have
[58:24] in the future and uh we're certainly
[58:26] excited to see what the Lord will do are
[58:29] you thankful for the church officers
[58:30] this
[58:31] morning give them a
[58:37] round we know that it takes a desire to
[58:41] serve it it's a it's a desire that not
[58:45] everyone has but the trustees they look
[58:48] after the office of the church the
[58:51] building and keeping everything in check
[58:54] making sure that we are comfortable
[58:56] making sure that everything is
[58:57] functioning and uh it's not an easy job
[59:00] but they do a wonderful job because
[59:02] every single time we get to church it
[59:04] just sort of happens we have it all in
[59:05] order we're certainly thankful for that
[59:08] we're thankful for the office of the
[59:09] deacons the deacons that stand at the
[59:12] door tirelessly that look after things
[59:14] for us that sometimes have to speak out
[59:17] and say you know what if you wouldn't
[59:19] mind please don't do that or you know if
[59:21] you could please move up here because we
[59:23] just need to create a seat at the back
[59:25] for another family that's maybe come a
[59:26] little bit later sometimes we maybe
[59:29] don't like what the deacons have to say
[59:30] but we know the prophet for our day said
[59:32] that the deacons are the policemen for
[59:34] the church and they don't need to they
[59:36] shouldn't wait to talk to the pastor to
[59:39] see if they should do something you know
[59:41] if if you look at the word if you look
[59:43] at the office of a deacon I would say
[59:45] this and perhaps maybe some would argue
[59:48] but we can have a discussion about it if
[59:50] you look at the requirements of the
[59:51] office of a deacon it's even a little
[59:53] bit higher than that of a pastor we know
[59:55] the the pastor oversees it all but the
[59:58] office of a deacon actually does quite a
[1:00:01] bit of function it is a good thing when
[1:00:03] we desire the office of a deacon but it
[1:00:05] is a very very strong scriptural
[1:00:09] spiritual office it's not something to
[1:00:11] be taken lightly and for these brothers
[1:00:13] to be willing to stand up and actually
[1:00:15] step into that office that shows that
[1:00:17] they're willing to demonstrate by their
[1:00:19] lives that they live that they're
[1:00:21] qualified for that position because we
[1:00:24] would not want to serve the Lord in any
[1:00:26] capacity thinking presuming presuming
[1:00:29] that we're okay in our lives in our walk
[1:00:31] with the Lord and actually not having
[1:00:34] that walk that it takes to be in that
[1:00:36] position so God bless you Brothers for
[1:00:38] stepping forward to take that position
[1:00:40] as a deacon and uh I know I did it many
[1:00:43] years and it's not easy but the Lord
[1:00:46] gives us strength he's more than
[1:00:48] faithful are you happy this morning we
[1:00:51] have a communion service coming up next
[1:00:53] uh Sunday the 22nd at 5 5:30 p.m. we
[1:00:57] certainly look forward to seeing each
[1:00:58] and every one who desires to come and uh
[1:01:02] submit ourselves one to another in the
[1:01:04] fear of God because when we come
[1:01:06] together in a communion service it's not
[1:01:08] about us it's about coming and
[1:01:10] recognizing Discerning the Lord's body
[1:01:13] our brothers and our sisters that who
[1:01:16] have the Holy Ghost Inside of them we're
[1:01:18] actually not washing our brother our
[1:01:19] sister's feet when we come to the
[1:01:20] communion table we're actually partaking
[1:01:22] of communion bread and taking a little
[1:01:24] bit of wine but what we're doing is
[1:01:25] Discerning the Lord's body the body that
[1:01:27] was broken for us and the blood that was
[1:01:29] shed that brought our Redemption that
[1:01:31] not just brought our Redemption but
[1:01:32] gives us the ability to understand who
[1:01:34] we are in the day in which we live the
[1:01:36] communion service brothers and sisters
[1:01:38] for those who haven't participated for a
[1:01:40] long time I've strongly recommend that
[1:01:42] you examine your life and take a look at
[1:01:44] it and say is this for me because we
[1:01:47] know the prophet for our day said the
[1:01:48] communion service is for every believer
[1:01:51] it's not something that's just a
[1:01:53] voluntary thing I'll just take it and
[1:01:55] leave it if we're Believers then we
[1:01:57] follow the word of God and that's what
[1:01:59] the word says so we have a communion
[1:02:00] service coming up on the 22nd next
[1:02:02] Sunday at 5:30 p.m. we'll have
[1:02:05] testimonies we'll have foot washing and
[1:02:07] we'll have communion
[1:02:10] service all right let's get into the
[1:02:13] word today uh talking about our
[1:02:15] Ephesians chapter 5 going back to this I
[1:02:18] just felt so led to go here today really
[1:02:20] enjoyed the service last week with
[1:02:22] brother toonbo there's so many notes
[1:02:24] that I got out of it and I trust that
[1:02:26] everyone else did and I think it's just
[1:02:28] a beautiful thing when we do have the
[1:02:30] online services that we can go back and
[1:02:32] reference to sometimes maybe we don't
[1:02:34] take notes personally in service I find
[1:02:38] that I like to I try to but sometimes I
[1:02:41] get so into the word that's happening
[1:02:43] it's impossible to actually write notes
[1:02:45] and you know what H used to happen to me
[1:02:47] is uh I'll just be completely
[1:02:50] transparent my pastor used to talk so
[1:02:52] fast sometimes it would make me
[1:02:54] frustrated because I couldn't write the
[1:02:56] notes down but we could always get the
[1:02:58] recording so we could always go back and
[1:03:00] reference it and I I began to actually
[1:03:02] really appreciate that I really enjoyed
[1:03:04] the fact that I could go back and listen
[1:03:06] and you know we all have that ability
[1:03:07] now through YouTube we don't even have
[1:03:09] to ask for a CD from the brothers for a
[1:03:12] piece of the service we can just go and
[1:03:14] look any single time we want to and it's
[1:03:16] just a wonderful thing when we can look
[1:03:18] back and and just pick things up but I
[1:03:21] know that I got uh quite a bit of notes
[1:03:24] and uh just appreciate brother tonbo and
[1:03:27] his stand for the word and you know I
[1:03:30] think one of the things that really
[1:03:31] indicates his stand for the word is the
[1:03:34] just the life that he lives serving the
[1:03:36] lord as long as he has and the capacity
[1:03:38] that he's at and and I think we all
[1:03:40] heard the testimony that when he came to
[1:03:43] Calgary here it was the first time he'd
[1:03:44] taken a break in in many years even
[1:03:46] Decades of preaching the gospel and he
[1:03:49] was able to just have a rest which is
[1:03:51] certainly a wonderful thing but really
[1:03:53] enjoyed the service last week and uh
[1:03:56] today getting into our scripture talking
[1:03:58] about Ephesians chapter 5 we know that
[1:04:00] Paul speaking to the Ephesian Church
[1:04:02] he's talking about the husbands and how
[1:04:04] they're supposed to conduct themselves
[1:04:05] according to the word of God and wives
[1:04:08] how excuse me they're supposed to
[1:04:09] conduct themselves according to the word
[1:04:11] of God when we did this study on
[1:04:13] Wednesday night um probably about a year
[1:04:16] ago or longer probably two years even um
[1:04:19] I just pointed out I felt so impressed
[1:04:21] to point out we we can look at the
[1:04:23] scripture and say that you know the
[1:04:25] husband has been taught that the wife is
[1:04:26] supposed to just submit and it's an
[1:04:28] unconditional thing just submit and it
[1:04:30] truly is according to the word of God
[1:04:33] but a wife that doesn't see a husband
[1:04:34] living his life according to the word of
[1:04:36] God is going to have a real hard time
[1:04:38] being able to submit to that being able
[1:04:39] to surrender her headship to her
[1:04:42] headship she's going to have a real hard
[1:04:43] time with it it doesn't mean that it's
[1:04:44] not conditional it's not conditional if
[1:04:48] you want to see the power of God move in
[1:04:49] your life you got to accept it the way
[1:04:50] that God's given it and then God will
[1:04:52] honor his word amen but it starts verse
[1:04:56] 21 submitting
[1:04:57] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:05:00] God we have to be willing to come
[1:05:03] together to submit ourselves one to
[1:05:05] another and you know when we have the
[1:05:07] Holy Ghost in our lives in our midst it
[1:05:10] it's really important for us to
[1:05:11] recognize if we truly do have the Holy
[1:05:13] Ghost In Our Lives when we're submitting
[1:05:14] ourselves one to another we're
[1:05:15] submitting ourselves unto God now some
[1:05:18] might say brother bar you're taking and
[1:05:20] making a human being god well who are
[1:05:22] you if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:26] I want to talk about uh a little
[1:05:28] testimony I've got a I've got a a friend
[1:05:30] that I knew in the world and years ago I
[1:05:35] I grew up with and I've told some
[1:05:36] testimonies about this this gentleman
[1:05:38] and anyways I uh I drove past his house
[1:05:43] a little while ago this summer and uh I
[1:05:46] noticed that this old friend of mine the
[1:05:48] the house had changed it was the same
[1:05:50] way for years for decades but when we
[1:05:53] went past this summer I noticed that it
[1:05:55] was it was changed and I knew something
[1:05:57] was different the house sold or
[1:05:59] something was wrong something had
[1:06:00] changed and his parents lived in the
[1:06:02] house and they were old and it turns out
[1:06:05] that his his dad had passed away and so
[1:06:08] they had to sell the house his mom could
[1:06:09] no longer live there and uh so he now
[1:06:12] lives with his mom and it's kind of a a
[1:06:15] long story that way but what I'm getting
[1:06:17] at is
[1:06:18] seeing the life that was lived when I
[1:06:22] was in the world and seeing the life
[1:06:24] that I Live Now is is a dramatic change
[1:06:28] and even in the midst of that worldly
[1:06:30] life that I was living there was a time
[1:06:32] where this friend of mine he was uh
[1:06:35] connected with this woman that was his
[1:06:36] girlfriend at the time and he went to a
[1:06:38] church with her and he went to this
[1:06:41] church and he said that that for some
[1:06:43] reason he found himself at the front of
[1:06:45] the church and I thought he was telling
[1:06:47] me this story in the world and and I
[1:06:49] thought wow that's an interesting story
[1:06:51] he he found himself at the front of the
[1:06:53] church and he said when they prayed for
[1:06:54] him he felt something go in the top of
[1:06:57] his head and out the bottom of his body
[1:06:59] out out out his foot and I remember in
[1:07:01] the world having a moment thought a
[1:07:04] thought where I was like that's
[1:07:06] interesting you never hear people talk
[1:07:08] like that in the world what was that in
[1:07:10] a church it made me think that perhaps
[1:07:12] there was some kind of power or
[1:07:14] something that that that could have been
[1:07:16] there and I asked him you know what
[1:07:17] about that did you continue going to the
[1:07:19] church and he said no no no but it
[1:07:21] really stuck with me it made me think
[1:07:23] about it and and even in the world I
[1:07:25] thought man there's something about that
[1:07:28] and I remember when I first started
[1:07:29] coming to church here that was kind of
[1:07:30] my reference point to Modern
[1:07:32] Christianity it's kind of strange but
[1:07:34] it's true and I actually asked brother
[1:07:36] Ken do you have that kind of power in
[1:07:38] the church here is this the same kind of
[1:07:42] church and brother Ken said well maybe
[1:07:44] not exactly like that but what I learned
[1:07:49] and I'm sure that we all have and this
[1:07:50] is really kind of where I want to get to
[1:07:52] today is that that truly we know if you
[1:07:55] listen to anointed ones at the end time
[1:07:57] brother radam says that's the real
[1:07:58] anointing on the false vessel right you
[1:08:01] can have the real anointing it comes
[1:08:02] into the church he comes where he's
[1:08:04] invited now I'm not saying this man that
[1:08:06] I know is a false vessel I don't know
[1:08:07] that's up to God to figure out that's
[1:08:10] not up to me to figure out and it
[1:08:11] behooves us to make sure that we're not
[1:08:12] trying to figure it out for other people
[1:08:14] but what I'm getting at is I wanted to
[1:08:16] say to him and I plan to in the future
[1:08:19] is you know what you don't have to have
[1:08:21] it just come in and then go out and I
[1:08:24] think many times in Our Lives that's
[1:08:26] what happens is we experience the
[1:08:28] anointing of a service and we say wow
[1:08:30] that's a fantastic service bless God God
[1:08:34] bless everyone Shake everyone's hand and
[1:08:36] then we go home and we just live the
[1:08:37] same life that we've ever lived brothers
[1:08:39] and sisters it doesn't have to be that
[1:08:41] way you can take him with
[1:08:44] you you can take that power of God and
[1:08:48] and live it amen not us live it but
[1:08:51] allow him to live it through us and the
[1:08:53] only way that happens is through
[1:08:54] surrender amen
[1:08:55] but that's where I want to get to today
[1:08:57] you know talking about submitting
[1:08:59] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:09:01] God how do we do that come according to
[1:09:03] the word amen unless we're willing to
[1:09:06] come exactly according to the word we're
[1:09:09] not going to get the right results and I
[1:09:11] just you know I I was laboring thinking
[1:09:14] I don't know if I want to go and start
[1:09:15] talking about this today in service and
[1:09:18] you hear the songs and you hear the poem
[1:09:20] You Hear The testimonies and it's God
[1:09:22] vindicating it saying yes go forwards
[1:09:25] like Joshua Don't Be Afraid don't don't
[1:09:27] don't don't worry because I'll be with
[1:09:31] you so here we are submitting ourselves
[1:09:35] one to another in the fear of God wives
[1:09:37] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:09:38] as unto the Lord for the husband is the
[1:09:40] head of the wife even as Christ is a
[1:09:42] head of the church and he is a savior of
[1:09:44] the body therefore as the church is
[1:09:47] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[1:09:49] to their own husbands and everything so
[1:09:52] what that says to me brothers and
[1:09:53] sisters and I think the prophet says it
[1:09:55] I'm not going to bring up too many
[1:09:56] quotes about it because I want to go
[1:09:57] further with it but I'm just sort of
[1:09:59] laying a background setting a foundation
[1:10:00] here what I want to say is that based on
[1:10:02] the word of God the wife is completely
[1:10:06] and totally surrendered unto the husband
[1:10:10] she is 100% the husband's
[1:10:13] responsibility for the husband to say
[1:10:14] the wife is acting out and going crazy
[1:10:16] she's maybe doing things and maybe
[1:10:19] things are wild and and we're not sure
[1:10:21] what's happening the reason for that is
[1:10:23] there's something wrong with the husband
[1:10:25] something is wrong something is off
[1:10:27] something needs to be
[1:10:29] corrected but it's not something that we
[1:10:31] need to see correction in terms of a a a
[1:10:34] an embarrassing situation we just need
[1:10:36] to get back to the
[1:10:38] word that's all the husband is head of
[1:10:41] the wife you know what Christ is the
[1:10:43] head of the
[1:10:44] church right and we want him to be our
[1:10:47] husband and we want him to nourish us
[1:10:50] and to cherish us and to keep us in
[1:10:53] every single trial and every tribulation
[1:10:55] that we go through are we actually
[1:10:58] ministering the same Grace is that same
[1:10:59] Grace flowing from Christ through us as
[1:11:02] husbands to our
[1:11:04] wives if it's not then we need to just
[1:11:08] stop and we need to check up with the
[1:11:10] word of
[1:11:11] God because there's something wrong if
[1:11:14] it's not because it doesn't line up with
[1:11:16] the
[1:11:17] word 25 says husbands love your wives
[1:11:20] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:11:22] gave himself for it there wasn't one
[1:11:25] thing that he held back on he gave all
[1:11:28] of himself for the
[1:11:31] church remember when he was let's just
[1:11:34] start with the
[1:11:36] end shall we maybe how much he gave when
[1:11:40] he was on the cross how much pride did
[1:11:42] he have when he was on the cross how
[1:11:45] much of himself was he covering up there
[1:11:48] was nothing covering him on the cross
[1:11:50] was there no he was naked on the cross
[1:11:54] he was put put to an open
[1:11:56] shame why was he put to an open shame so
[1:12:00] that we could see Redemption so that we
[1:12:03] could be husbands to our wives amen so
[1:12:06] that we could have overcoming power in
[1:12:08] our lives amen he wasn't put to an open
[1:12:12] shame you know how the Catholic Church
[1:12:15] does it how many people do it they put
[1:12:17] the loin cloth around them no no not at
[1:12:20] all and and you know many times I think
[1:12:24] we can just get into sort of a I don't
[1:12:27] even know how you would describe it
[1:12:29] maybe almost like a fairy tale
[1:12:30] perspective of what happened and maybe
[1:12:32] an example of that could be like
[1:12:34] Christmas time how you know Jesus was
[1:12:37] born in a manger he was in a manger and
[1:12:40] and the world presented in such a way
[1:12:42] that it's soft and fluffy and maybe a
[1:12:44] little bit of straw that's nice and
[1:12:45] clean you know it wasn't that way he was
[1:12:48] wrapped in a swaddling cloth which was
[1:12:51] the filthy stinking rag that was between
[1:12:53] the the yolk on a ox and he probably had
[1:12:57] straw in the manger the manger is what
[1:12:59] they feed the animals out of he probably
[1:13:00] had straw in there that had manure on it
[1:13:03] who would take their baby into a
[1:13:04] position like that who would want to
[1:13:06] have a baby in that kind of a hospital
[1:13:08] room my point is sometimes we can paint
[1:13:11] a picture and have an idea in our head
[1:13:13] that it's really kind of different than
[1:13:15] what it was he was put to an open shame
[1:13:18] there was no pride in Jesus Christ when
[1:13:20] he was on that cross for us
[1:13:25] you know in our
[1:13:27] day God sent us a prophet and we all
[1:13:30] know the prophet that's why we're here
[1:13:31] because we believe that God sent a
[1:13:33] prophet God sent a Vindicated Prophet
[1:13:35] for this age that's why we're here he
[1:13:37] was born in the hills of Kentucky 1906 I
[1:13:40] believe we know this land was a a land
[1:13:42] of religious freedom we could go into
[1:13:44] all the history of the US but but I
[1:13:46] think it's amazing to look at because
[1:13:48] this land was raised up for one purpose
[1:13:49] wasn't it brothers and sisters to
[1:13:51] fulfill Revelations 13 according to the
[1:13:54] word of this Vindicated Prophet but here
[1:13:56] we had to have a place for a Vindicated
[1:13:59] Prophet to rise up do you think God
[1:14:01] could raise up an entire nation for a
[1:14:04] Vindicated
[1:14:06] prophet he did we know this man he had a
[1:14:09] strange birth he had strange experiences
[1:14:12] we know that when he was young working
[1:14:13] for his daddy who was just a normal
[1:14:16] human being of the day what was he doing
[1:14:18] living in prohibition I think and what
[1:14:20] were they doing they were making
[1:14:21] moonshine his dad was making moonshine
[1:14:24] and and and and carousing with women
[1:14:26] after hours and this is what this boy
[1:14:28] the environment this this Prophet was
[1:14:30] raised in and we know that he tells the
[1:14:32] stories where people judged him hard and
[1:14:34] said you're a brandom they'll cross the
[1:14:36] street so they don't have to talk to him
[1:14:38] because they didn't like his
[1:14:40] daddy we know that he said his people
[1:14:42] they died with their boots on you know
[1:14:44] what that means that means there's no
[1:14:45] peace or rest people die in the street
[1:14:47] wearing their boots they get
[1:14:50] killed he said those were the people
[1:14:52] that he came from but we know in the
[1:14:54] midst of of all of that there was a time
[1:14:56] where the voice came and spoke in the
[1:14:57] tree and we know the story all too well
[1:14:59] I'm not trying to give a story time here
[1:15:01] but I'm trying to paint the picture
[1:15:03] about this Vindicated Prophet there was
[1:15:05] a time where that angel of the Lord came
[1:15:07] and spoke to him in a whirlwind in a
[1:15:09] tree and said to him don't drink don't
[1:15:11] ever drink or smoke or defile your body
[1:15:13] in any way because there's a work for
[1:15:15] you to do later and isn't it wonderful
[1:15:18] to think that this work that he did
[1:15:21] later has manifest now in our lives amen
[1:15:25] that work that he did is manifesting
[1:15:28] right now we know that he had a call on
[1:15:30] his life to preach not knowing where it
[1:15:32] would take him but but this this Angel
[1:15:34] of the Lord came and met him again and
[1:15:36] told him you know what your your message
[1:15:38] the word from you you're going to go and
[1:15:40] preach all around the world to Kings and
[1:15:42] potentates and they're going to they're
[1:15:43] going to hear your word there's going to
[1:15:45] be kings that are want to be prayed for
[1:15:48] by you and we know it
[1:15:50] was it was you can look it up King
[1:15:53] George I believe was that was that Queen
[1:15:55] Elizabeth's dad he was prayed for and
[1:15:59] healed but we know this angel came and
[1:16:01] told him that and we know that's what he
[1:16:03] went and
[1:16:05] did we know that this man the
[1:16:08] identification of him is actually in the
[1:16:10] word Revelations 10:7 Malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:16:16] I I think it's just so so beautiful we
[1:16:18] all know this I I know it's exactly what
[1:16:20] we believe it's it's what we know and
[1:16:22] the entire message that this man brought
[1:16:24] point points to the word of God points
[1:16:26] directly back to the King James version
[1:16:28] of the word and we know that this God
[1:16:31] that we're talking about the God that
[1:16:33] everyone claims but not everyone is
[1:16:35] willing to actually take his word about
[1:16:37] this God that we're talking about he
[1:16:38] sent this Prophet for a purpose it
[1:16:40] wasn't just to have a Healing Ministry
[1:16:42] to go around the world it wasn't just to
[1:16:44] have a a first and second poll it wasn't
[1:16:47] so that there could be a a voice of God
[1:16:49] Recordings in a geographical location
[1:16:51] and people could go and and and partake
[1:16:54] of some of the things that the prophet
[1:16:55] liked to do or or have sightseeing tours
[1:16:58] or all of that that was not the purpose
[1:17:00] at all of what this Prophet was sent for
[1:17:02] the purpose this Prophet was sent for
[1:17:04] was just like elaser was sent for and
[1:17:07] that was to go and call a bride amen for
[1:17:10] Isaac his dad wanted to see him get the
[1:17:13] right bride not just any bride but the
[1:17:16] right bride this Prophet was sent to
[1:17:19] call out the right bride to set the
[1:17:22] church in order sir to bring Church
[1:17:25] order to show us how to love our wives
[1:17:30] to show our wives how to love our
[1:17:31] husbands and to show all of us how to
[1:17:34] love our Heavenly
[1:17:36] husband and how do we do that just
[1:17:39] follow the word of the prophet and get
[1:17:41] back to the word and push aside all of
[1:17:44] our traditions and all of our teachings
[1:17:47] I love the song that sister kindness
[1:17:49] sung it's not time to be playing
[1:17:52] games it's not time to be playing Church
[1:17:55] brothers and sisters it's not at all
[1:17:57] time to say I I've heard it all there's
[1:17:59] nothing you can teach me who are you
[1:18:02] looking for if that's what you're saying
[1:18:03] I want to say this to you who is it that
[1:18:06] you're looking for to talk to you are
[1:18:09] you looking for God to speak to you or
[1:18:12] is a church experience that and that
[1:18:15] alone it's just a church
[1:18:16] experience God sent the prophet for a
[1:18:19] purpose to call a church to call a bride
[1:18:22] of his own choosing and the only way
[1:18:23] that bride is going to be called out the
[1:18:26] only way she's going to be that bride
[1:18:28] the true identification of her being the
[1:18:30] bride is she will get in line with the
[1:18:32] word she will line right up with that
[1:18:36] word and if she is his bride She'll
[1:18:40] follow his word holy amen I think it's
[1:18:44] so
[1:18:44] beautiful She'll follow his word holy
[1:18:48] let's turn over to Joshua chapter
[1:18:52] 14 now today I just want to be sure that
[1:18:55] we're clear I'm not picking on wives and
[1:18:56] I'm not picking on husbands I I'm not
[1:18:59] trying to pick on anyone what I want to
[1:19:01] do is encourage us to follow the lord
[1:19:05] holy amen hallelujah we want to see the
[1:19:09] Lord move in our lives amen there's only
[1:19:12] one way we're going to see that happen
[1:19:13] brothers and sisters in Joshua chapter
[1:19:16] 14 a very familiar scripture I I hope to
[1:19:19] refer to it all the way through this
[1:19:22] morning verse 6 then the children of
[1:19:25] Judah came unto Joshua in gilgal and
[1:19:28] Caleb the son of jauna the kenite and
[1:19:32] said unto them Lord thou knowest the
[1:19:35] thing that the Lord said to Moses the
[1:19:37] man of God concerning me and thee in
[1:19:40] Kadesh
[1:19:41] barnea and we know what the thing the
[1:19:44] Lord said was there's only two of you
[1:19:46] that are actually going to go in to see
[1:19:48] the promised land all the rest of them
[1:19:50] who were there decided to follow the
[1:19:53] words of the spies
[1:19:55] the the other 10 that were with them we
[1:19:58] know 12 went into the promised land I
[1:20:00] won't go too far into that right now
[1:20:02] verse 7 says 40 years this is Caleb
[1:20:05] speaking here 40 years old was I when
[1:20:08] Moses the servant of the Lord sent me
[1:20:10] from Kadesh barnea to aspy out the land
[1:20:13] and I was brought him word again as it
[1:20:16] was in Mine Heart nevertheless the
[1:20:20] Brethren that went up with me now notice
[1:20:22] he says the Brethren he doesn't say the
[1:20:25] enemies he doesn't say the the people
[1:20:28] from the land he says the
[1:20:30] Brethren nevertheless my brethren that
[1:20:33] went up with me made the heart of the
[1:20:36] people melt how did they make the heart
[1:20:38] of the people melt go back and read the
[1:20:40] story of Kadesh barnea what were they
[1:20:42] doing murmuring what were they doing
[1:20:44] talking what were they doing having
[1:20:47] Whispers And conversations in the
[1:20:49] background about what they thought the
[1:20:51] ministry should be doing about what the
[1:20:52] prophet should be saying and how how
[1:20:54] they couldn't do it look at the natural
[1:20:57] circumstances but what did God say hey
[1:21:00] you know what you're not willing to take
[1:21:01] me at my word you're not willing to
[1:21:02] trust me all the way away with you can
[1:21:05] you imagine how they must have felt we
[1:21:07] know there was a great mourning in the
[1:21:08] land because they heard the word of the
[1:21:10] Prophet they were right there they
[1:21:12] probably were I'm going to say in their
[1:21:14] day they were probably message
[1:21:16] theologians they probably knew more than
[1:21:18] that Minister could ever learn that's
[1:21:20] right they've probably been in the
[1:21:22] message for generations for decades
[1:21:26] but for some reason some reason they
[1:21:29] just couldn't go all the way they
[1:21:30] couldn't they couldn't actually accept
[1:21:32] the word for their day nevertheless my
[1:21:35] brethren that went up with me made the
[1:21:37] heart of the people melt my and they
[1:21:41] paid for it didn't they but I wholly
[1:21:43] followed the Lord my
[1:21:45] God brothers and sisters today I want to
[1:21:48] say let that be our scripture let that
[1:21:51] be where we rest in the word of God I
[1:21:54] holy followed the word of my God there's
[1:21:57] coming a day where we're going to have
[1:21:58] to stand before God ourselves ourselves
[1:22:01] with no one else around there ain't
[1:22:03] going to be no church there ain't going
[1:22:04] to be no family there ain't going to be
[1:22:06] no Traditions nobody is going to be able
[1:22:08] to speak on our behalf except for Jesus
[1:22:11] Christ and you know we could say hey we
[1:22:14] cast out devils in your name and he'll
[1:22:16] say you
[1:22:17] know I I I don't think I ever even knew
[1:22:20] you we didn't have a personal
[1:22:23] relationship for for some reason I I
[1:22:25] don't I don't think I knew
[1:22:28] you but if we wholly follow him amen
[1:22:32] then Jesus Christ is our intercessor
[1:22:35] he's the one that's going to say enter
[1:22:37] thou into the joy of the Lord come on my
[1:22:41] servant you've made me pleased you've
[1:22:42] really done what I wanted you to do all
[1:22:44] the way along verse n says and Moses
[1:22:47] swear on that day saying surely the land
[1:22:50] whereon thy feet have trotten shall be
[1:22:52] thine inheritance and thy children's
[1:22:55] forever because thou Hast wholly
[1:22:58] followed the Lord my
[1:23:01] God remember this is Caleb speaking
[1:23:04] here he's in a position where he's
[1:23:07] beginning to recognize this is not just
[1:23:10] a historical teaching about the message
[1:23:12] I've seen signs I've seen wonders I've
[1:23:15] followed the Lord holy all the days of
[1:23:17] my life and now I I've actually got this
[1:23:19] great challenge ahead of me there's this
[1:23:21] great mountain in front of me and I can
[1:23:24] choose to go around the mountain I can
[1:23:26] choose to step back from the mountain or
[1:23:28] I can put my shoulders back and square
[1:23:30] up and say I holy followed the Lord in
[1:23:33] my day and we know that's what he's
[1:23:35] doing here verse 10 says and now behold
[1:23:37] the Lord hath kept me alive as he said
[1:23:40] these 4 and5 years even since the Lord
[1:23:44] spake this word unto Moses while the
[1:23:47] children of Israel wandered in the
[1:23:49] wilderness and now lo I am this day four
[1:23:52] score and5 years old old 85 years old
[1:23:56] he's an old man as yet I am as strong
[1:24:00] this day as I was in the day that Moses
[1:24:03] sent me as my strength was then even so
[1:24:07] is my strength now I pray that brothers
[1:24:10] and sisters we would be able to have
[1:24:12] that testimony right now my strength is
[1:24:14] just as strong right now as the day that
[1:24:17] I got saved the day that I recognized
[1:24:19] that God came in flesh died on a cross
[1:24:22] so that I could receive Redemption when
[1:24:24] I recognize that for the first time in
[1:24:26] my life my I pray that would be our
[1:24:29] testimony brothers and
[1:24:31] sisters oh
[1:24:33] my as yet I am as strong this day as I
[1:24:37] was in the day that Moses sent me and as
[1:24:40] my strength was then even so is my
[1:24:43] strength now for war both to go out and
[1:24:48] to come
[1:24:50] in sometimes we find our our flesh our
[1:24:53] bodies are weak we know that Jesus had
[1:24:55] to say it to her his disciples one time
[1:24:57] when he wanted them to pray in the
[1:24:59] garden you know I know the spirit is
[1:25:01] willing but your flesh is weak you just
[1:25:03] keep falling asleep when it's time to
[1:25:04] pray I pray that we won't be falling
[1:25:06] asleep when it's time to pray amen verse
[1:25:10] 12 now therefore what does he say give
[1:25:13] me this
[1:25:14] mountain give me this mountain don't
[1:25:17] take it away from me don't don't don't
[1:25:19] find a way around it don't help me
[1:25:21] tunnel through it don't don't make it
[1:25:23] Tunnel Mountain for me like in B but
[1:25:26] give me an opportunity Lord to go
[1:25:28] forwards in the power and strength of
[1:25:31] your might and now give me this mountain
[1:25:34] wherefore the Lord spake in that day for
[1:25:36] thou heardest in that day how oh my the
[1:25:39] anakims were there uhoh no no no no no
[1:25:42] we got to back up sorry we could have
[1:25:45] had that mountain but the Giants were
[1:25:47] there we need to step back you know the
[1:25:50] CPR one time they were actually going to
[1:25:52] Tunnel through the mountain tunnel
[1:25:54] Mountain but somebody came up with a a
[1:25:57] really smart idea naturally speaking and
[1:25:59] they said why would we tunnel through it
[1:26:00] when we could just go around
[1:26:02] it so instead of tunneling through the
[1:26:04] mountain they just went around it but
[1:26:06] they call the mountain Tunnel Mountain
[1:26:09] but you know Joshua wasn't looking for a
[1:26:11] way to tunnel under it he wasn't looking
[1:26:13] for a way to go around it but I love how
[1:26:16] he's so excited about it you know as I
[1:26:17] follow the lord holy and all of this and
[1:26:20] I'm in position oh now therefore give me
[1:26:22] this mountain wherefore the Lord spake
[1:26:24] in that day for thou heardest in the day
[1:26:26] how the anakims were there oh my the
[1:26:29] Giants and that the cities were great
[1:26:31] and
[1:26:33] Fen if so be the Lord will be with me
[1:26:38] what then I shall be able to drive them
[1:26:42] out as the Lord
[1:26:44] said brothers and sisters we know full
[1:26:47] well that Caleb is a type of the Bride
[1:26:49] of Jesus Christ Joshua is a type of the
[1:26:53] Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] the one that would lead and guide Caleb
[1:26:58] that's right so now looking at our
[1:27:01] scripture through that lens I want to go
[1:27:03] back to Ephesians 5 and say what's our
[1:27:06] Promised Land because remember the
[1:27:08] prophet that we believe that we follow
[1:27:10] holy he said the book of Ephesians
[1:27:13] perfectly parallels the Book of Joshua
[1:27:16] amen amen and maybe he said it this way
[1:27:18] I'm going to back up in case anybody is
[1:27:20] trying to challenge me on that maybe he
[1:27:22] said it this way that Joshua
[1:27:24] perfectly parallels the book of
[1:27:26] Ephesians he could have said it one way
[1:27:28] or the other but I know he said it I'm
[1:27:31] not claiming to be a theologian I'm just
[1:27:33] claiming to know that I know the man who
[1:27:35] wrote this
[1:27:38] Bible you know the prophet he said get
[1:27:40] back to the word what we're talking
[1:27:43] about today brothers and sisters is
[1:27:44] recognizing our position as husbands all
[1:27:46] of the responsibility is ours full stop
[1:27:49] amen that's what the word of God says we
[1:27:52] can say that we've taken a bride and
[1:27:54] everything is wrong and she's
[1:27:56] maybe acting out and and if that's the
[1:27:59] case what's wrong with you where do we
[1:28:02] stand before the Lord there has to be a
[1:28:05] reason for it but same thing with the
[1:28:08] with the husband if the husband is is is
[1:28:10] not willing to follow the word of God
[1:28:12] what's what's going on with the wife we
[1:28:14] are supposed to be
[1:28:16] one but I just love how it says
[1:28:18] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:28:19] the fear of God wives submit yourselves
[1:28:22] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[1:28:25] you know what I want to talk about today
[1:28:27] brothers and sisters I guess if I had to
[1:28:29] maybe put a title on this sermon I I
[1:28:31] would title it leadership I would want
[1:28:33] it to be titled leadership and we're
[1:28:35] probably going to talk about that today
[1:28:37] with the young people about leadership
[1:28:39] we have got to be willing to be led you
[1:28:41] know brother bradam talks about
[1:28:42] leadership right at the end of his
[1:28:44] ministry the culmination of the entirety
[1:28:46] of the message and we had talked about
[1:28:48] this in the past how we have communion
[1:28:50] with the Lord Jesus Christ we know
[1:28:51] communion was the very last message but
[1:28:53] just before that was leadership you know
[1:28:55] if we're not willing to be led then
[1:28:57] we're never going to be able to have
[1:28:58] communion that's just never going to
[1:29:01] happen everybody has to be led we get
[1:29:03] led into this world brother brandham
[1:29:05] says and we get LED out of this world
[1:29:07] that's just the way it works we can't
[1:29:10] help it but we have the ability to thank
[1:29:13] the Lord that he has given us the
[1:29:15] ability to recognize his calling to call
[1:29:19] a bride a wife of his own choosing and
[1:29:21] if she is truly his bride then she will
[1:29:23] follow follow his word holy amen
[1:29:27] hallelujah you won't be interested in
[1:29:28] listening to traditions and saying ah I
[1:29:31] don't know I've done it another way all
[1:29:33] these years and everything will be fine
[1:29:34] you know what don't take my word for it
[1:29:36] take the word of God for it take the
[1:29:37] message of the hour for it see what the
[1:29:40] prophet of God says thank you you know
[1:29:42] in the exposition of the seven Church
[1:29:43] ages the samian church age we've already
[1:29:46] gone over this we we went over this in
[1:29:49] uh my it's getting warm in
[1:29:52] here we went went over this in uh on
[1:29:55] Wednesday night services the exposition
[1:29:57] of the seven Church agents did you get
[1:29:59] the the emails brother you have this
[1:30:02] one why does he stand by brother
[1:30:05] brandham is talking about how God
[1:30:09] sometimes lets us go through trials
[1:30:11] Let's us go through tribulations why
[1:30:12] does he just stand by
[1:30:15] sometimes why does he stand by he says
[1:30:18] he says the reason is in Romans 8:17 and
[1:30:21] 18 and if children then air
[1:30:25] Hees of God and Joint HS with Christ if
[1:30:28] so be that we suffer with
[1:30:31] him that we may also be glorified
[1:30:35] together sorry I'm just getting really
[1:30:36] hot here I just need to get some
[1:30:37] ventilation I might even have to do a
[1:30:39] little bit of this hope that's
[1:30:42] okay that we may also be glorified
[1:30:45] together for I reckon that the
[1:30:46] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:30:48] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:30:50] which shall be revealed in US amen
[1:30:54] very familiar quote here I know we we we
[1:30:57] all know it and if we don't I I
[1:30:59] recommend that we just look it up and
[1:31:00] maybe consider it a little bit the
[1:31:02] reason for this he says is that
[1:31:05] character simply is never made without
[1:31:09] suffering because we're born into the
[1:31:11] message of the hour our parents are
[1:31:13] message Believers for decades does not
[1:31:15] mean we have the character of Christ in
[1:31:17] our lives we have got to have a new
[1:31:20] birth experience amen Mary the mother
[1:31:24] the one that the Catholic Church wants
[1:31:26] to esteem greater than
[1:31:30] Christ she had to have an upper room
[1:31:32] experience she had to be one of the 120
[1:31:36] upstairs that came stumbling out like
[1:31:38] drunk people into the streets and one
[1:31:40] moment they were afraid of the Romans
[1:31:42] they were afraid they were going to get
[1:31:43] persecuted and hurt for talking about
[1:31:45] this Jesus but in the next moment they
[1:31:49] had boldness like they'd never seen how
[1:31:51] does that happen it's the glory which
[1:31:53] shall be revealed in US brother bam says
[1:31:56] the reason for this is that character
[1:31:58] simply is never made without
[1:32:01] suffering character is a
[1:32:04] victory not a gift
[1:32:06] amen so if it's a victory how do we get
[1:32:09] that Victory brothers and sisters we
[1:32:11] don't go out and get fed to Lions do we
[1:32:14] some might say well my co-workers they
[1:32:16] call me a Holy Roller that's part of it
[1:32:20] I would say but I would say the greater
[1:32:22] part of it is where we take our own will
[1:32:25] and we actually bring it to center with
[1:32:28] the word of God with the message of the
[1:32:30] hour we're willing to surrender all of
[1:32:32] our thoughts and all of our ideas and
[1:32:34] say be it unto me just like Mary said
[1:32:37] according to Thy word and what happens
[1:32:40] when that happens we have the new birth
[1:32:42] we get the power of the highest
[1:32:44] overshadowing us and we have a new life
[1:32:47] starting to come forward inside of us
[1:32:50] and that life Shall be Called who Jesus
[1:32:54] amen Jesus the reason for this is that
[1:32:57] character simply is never made without
[1:33:00] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:33:03] gift we've got to surrender our own will
[1:33:05] if we're going to see Victory a man
[1:33:08] without character can't Reign because
[1:33:11] power apart from character is
[1:33:16] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:33:18] to
[1:33:19] rule so now we come to the stage where
[1:33:22] we have to say well
[1:33:24] what
[1:33:26] character are we talking about here
[1:33:29] because I could say that fellow he's a
[1:33:31] real good character that fellow he's got
[1:33:34] a really good character I I I've got a
[1:33:37] really good
[1:33:38] character but we can all have different
[1:33:41] characteristics but you know brothers
[1:33:43] and sisters this character that we're
[1:33:45] talking about here is the life of Jesus
[1:33:48] Christ that's right we know the word of
[1:33:49] God says let this mind that was also in
[1:33:54] who
[1:33:56] bew in you so if that's the case it's
[1:34:00] not us any longer it's got to be his
[1:34:04] character living out through
[1:34:07] US Christ brings
[1:34:11] Redemption to the church
[1:34:14] Hallelujah we all say Amen to
[1:34:17] that Christ is the masculine the church
[1:34:23] is the the
[1:34:24] feminine
[1:34:26] husbands you bring Redemption to your
[1:34:29] families amen you bring Redemption to
[1:34:32] your
[1:34:34] wives we know that's exactly according
[1:34:36] to the word of God Amen we know that a
[1:34:39] Christian marriage in this world is
[1:34:42] exactly a reflection of our relationship
[1:34:45] to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and if
[1:34:48] it's not a reflection of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ then there's something wrong
[1:34:54] a man without character can't Reign
[1:34:57] because power apart from character is
[1:34:59] satanic if we want to try and demand
[1:35:03] I've got power you submit I'm going to
[1:35:06] say this from the pulpit you've got a
[1:35:08] little bit of something satanic going on
[1:35:11] right brothers and sisters it either is
[1:35:13] or it isn't that's right but when we're
[1:35:16] willing to lay down our life for our
[1:35:18] brides and say hey you know what search
[1:35:21] me and try me Lord just like the prophet
[1:35:24] said invisible Union of the Bride when
[1:35:26] he opens in his prayer he says search
[1:35:28] our hearts and try us Lord oh but Lord
[1:35:30] search me and try me
[1:35:33] first unless we're willing to do that
[1:35:36] brothers and sisters I want to say this
[1:35:37] real loud and clear we're not ready to
[1:35:39] be married yet we've got to be willing
[1:35:42] to lay down our lives for our wives and
[1:35:46] I say Lord help
[1:35:50] me but if we're willing to take and take
[1:35:53] the word of God if we're willing to take
[1:35:55] the word of God without being in our
[1:35:56] position correctly as a husband and try
[1:35:59] and usurp some sort of authority and say
[1:36:01] the word of God says this you're
[1:36:02] supposed to submit without being in line
[1:36:04] ourselves that's a satanic thing that
[1:36:07] we've got going on and I say Lord help
[1:36:10] us not have anything satanic in our
[1:36:14] lives but you know it's either good or
[1:36:16] it's bad it's it's
[1:36:18] either it's either of the Lord or it's
[1:36:21] of the devil right there's two Spirits
[1:36:22] at play here so don't get too uneasy
[1:36:25] when I say it's satanic because there's
[1:36:27] a lot of satanic there's a lot of evil
[1:36:28] in this world that's right power without
[1:36:32] character is satanic but Power with
[1:36:36] character power with the character of
[1:36:38] Christ in our lives power with and I'll
[1:36:40] say this brothers and sisters we might
[1:36:42] even be in a situation I'm talking from
[1:36:44] experience here now we might even be in
[1:36:45] a situation where we know that we're out
[1:36:47] of order according to the word of God we
[1:36:48] are out of order according to the word
[1:36:50] of God we just don't know how to do it
[1:36:52] you know what as long as we are willing
[1:36:54] to say Lord I don't even know how to do
[1:36:56] it oh Lord just help me I don't know
[1:36:59] what this guy's preaching he keeps
[1:37:01] harping on it over and over again but
[1:37:03] but but but I believe it is the word of
[1:37:05] God help me to realize it help me to
[1:37:07] apply it in my life if we're willing to
[1:37:09] do that that's all it takes he'll come
[1:37:12] on the scene and he'll show us that's
[1:37:14] right and you know what he won't just
[1:37:16] show us he'll actually begin to do it
[1:37:18] through us we'll come to the place where
[1:37:20] we'll say how come did that happen that
[1:37:22] way why did I behave that way that's
[1:37:24] beyond my thinking and even your wife
[1:37:26] will say what's wrong with you buddy
[1:37:28] maybe your husband will say whoa what
[1:37:30] happened to her I want to say this if
[1:37:32] you want to see your wife change then
[1:37:34] take a look in the mirror see if we line
[1:37:38] up with the word of God and if we don't
[1:37:40] all we need to do is do that's
[1:37:43] all that's where I said though so
[1:37:46] sometimes many times oh my many times
[1:37:50] we've just got a little bit of a garment
[1:37:52] on us still we want to go on to that
[1:37:54] cross just with Christ but we don't want
[1:37:55] to do it fully naked we just want to
[1:37:58] have that loin cloth right we just want
[1:38:00] to have that little bit of Pride left in
[1:38:02] our lives we don't no we're not going to
[1:38:04] go that far it's kind of like doors and
[1:38:06] doors brother bradam talks about it we
[1:38:08] can have the Lord come into our life
[1:38:09] into our house and we could bring them
[1:38:11] into the Foy we could bring them into
[1:38:12] the kitchen into the living room hey
[1:38:13] check out the beautiful Lazy Boy
[1:38:15] recliner there why don't you fix
[1:38:17] yourself a sandwich just make yourself
[1:38:19] right at home but don't you dare go into
[1:38:21] that room under the stairs I I've got
[1:38:23] some private boxes in there that nobody
[1:38:25] gets to see I've got some hurts in my
[1:38:28] life that I never want to talk about I
[1:38:31] I've got some some things maybe from my
[1:38:33] family that I can't talk about you don't
[1:38:36] have to talk about just tell him about
[1:38:39] just invite him to come inside that room
[1:38:42] just one time open that door come and
[1:38:44] look at all the boxes come and take
[1:38:46] those boxes and you know what he'll do
[1:38:48] he'll take those boxes right out of that
[1:38:50] room and throw them into the sea of his
[1:38:51] forgetfulness
[1:38:54] but as long as we're willing to keep
[1:38:55] that door locked and keep it private
[1:38:57] then we're going to stay right where we
[1:38:58] are exactly where we are there will be
[1:39:00] no progression but to try and usurp any
[1:39:03] kind of authority without first being in
[1:39:06] line with the word of God oh my we're
[1:39:10] actually trying to demonstrate a satanic
[1:39:13] power and you know I think many times we
[1:39:16] don't even realize it in our lives it's
[1:39:18] just the way we've always done it we've
[1:39:19] lived this way according to the message
[1:39:20] of the hour our whole entire lives our
[1:39:23] parents did this is the way it's always
[1:39:26] been it's not the way that God wants it
[1:39:28] the only way that God wants it is
[1:39:30] according to his word that's the only
[1:39:32] way God wants it is according to his
[1:39:34] word and how do we see his word through
[1:39:36] the lens of a Vindicated prophet in our
[1:39:38] day and we're willing to subject
[1:39:40] ourselves to that he goes on to say and
[1:39:42] since he wants us to share even his
[1:39:44] throne on the same basis that he
[1:39:46] overcame and has sat down in his
[1:39:49] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[1:39:52] to sit with him
[1:39:54] what do we have to overcome we can look
[1:39:55] around and say we got to overcome
[1:39:57] Hollywood we got to overcome the
[1:39:58] internet we got to overcome our jobs we
[1:40:00] got to overcome the pride of life where
[1:40:02] we want to just amass Supreme amounts of
[1:40:05] wealth we want to be so flush with cash
[1:40:07] we've got to overcome all of that we've
[1:40:10] got to overcome our pride you know the
[1:40:12] biggest thing that we've got to do is
[1:40:13] overcome
[1:40:14] ourselves overcoming ourselves and
[1:40:17] subjecting ourselves one to another in
[1:40:19] the fear of God so long as we're
[1:40:21] submitting ourselves one to another
[1:40:23] another in the fear of God that is the
[1:40:25] starting point that is the place where
[1:40:27] we begin amen hallelujah brother Brown
[1:40:30] goes on to say and the little temporary
[1:40:32] suffering we go through now is not
[1:40:33] worthy to be compared we know that this
[1:40:36] is exactly the scripture right that's
[1:40:38] right it's not worthy to be compared to
[1:40:42] the tremendous Glory that will be
[1:40:43] revealed in us when he comes hallelujah
[1:40:47] oh what Treasures are laid up for those
[1:40:48] who are are willing to enter into his
[1:40:52] kingdom through much
[1:40:54] tribulation how is that tribulation
[1:40:56] going to be brothers and sisters many
[1:40:58] times in leoda where we're rich and
[1:41:00] we're increased with goods and we don't
[1:41:01] have any need of anything do we the
[1:41:03] worst that can happen to us for the most
[1:41:05] part is maybe we'll have a a a situation
[1:41:08] where there'll be a global pandemic and
[1:41:10] everything will shut down all of our
[1:41:11] businesses and the churches and
[1:41:12] everything and everything is disrupted
[1:41:14] right I mean we have other things that
[1:41:16] go on in our lives but I'm just saying
[1:41:18] that we we go through tribulation but
[1:41:21] not really tremendous tribulation Maybe
[1:41:23] like some people do where they're
[1:41:25] actually persecuted for speaking the
[1:41:26] name of Jesus Christ where they'll be
[1:41:28] actually taken and thrown in prison
[1:41:30] where they will maybe be executed where
[1:41:32] where family members will just disappear
[1:41:33] and people will wonder what happened to
[1:41:35] them while they were
[1:41:36] Believers we don't suffer that kind of
[1:41:39] tribulation what we suffer is trying to
[1:41:41] get over
[1:41:43] ourselves and the devil knows it full
[1:41:45] well that's why we have this barrage of
[1:41:48] things in our lives that continually
[1:41:50] seem to to drag us down but you know the
[1:41:52] word of God God says and brother bradam
[1:41:54] says it here think it not strange
[1:41:55] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:41:57] try you that's what Peter said is it
[1:41:59] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:42:03] Christlike character that comes through
[1:42:05] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:42:09] we all have trials those who say they
[1:42:12] don't watch
[1:42:15] out we're all tried and chastened his
[1:42:20] sons we're all tried and chastened
[1:42:23] Sons not one but goes through that the
[1:42:26] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:42:28] being tried hasn't got
[1:42:31] it he even says it isn't of God brothers
[1:42:35] and sisters we have to have trials we
[1:42:37] have to have situations we have to have
[1:42:40] tribulations but it's working out the
[1:42:42] victory of Christ's character in Our
[1:42:46] Lives who wants our own character anyway
[1:42:50] we got to see the old man die
[1:42:53] Hebrews 126 and8 For Whom the Lo Lord
[1:42:57] loveth he chasteneth now remember he
[1:43:02] chasteneth when we step into the role of
[1:43:06] trying to chasen One Another We're
[1:43:08] actually stepping into the position of
[1:43:10] God and I want to say this we're
[1:43:11] potentially getting into the place where
[1:43:13] we're actually getting into maybe a
[1:43:15] little bit of Satan Satanism that little
[1:43:18] satanic thing where we have a little bit
[1:43:19] of power without the character of Christ
[1:43:22] behind us we don't want to persecute one
[1:43:24] another we love one another it's the
[1:43:26] Lord that does the chastening and he
[1:43:29] scourgeth every son whom he
[1:43:32] receiveth but if ye be without
[1:43:34] chastisement if we're not willing to
[1:43:35] take it whereof all our partakers then
[1:43:39] ye are bastards and not Sons were not
[1:43:42] even counted to be one of his my you
[1:43:46] know I started looking at this power
[1:43:47] without character and uh it just made me
[1:43:50] think of a couple different different
[1:43:51] people in the Bible and uh there's a
[1:43:54] couple of real Stark examples of power
[1:43:58] without character and the first one is
[1:44:00] Pharaoh we know that God allowed pharaoh
[1:44:02] to raise up but if you want to know
[1:44:04] specifically where I'm going I'll tell
[1:44:05] you and that's simply this he heard that
[1:44:08] there was a message of a deliverer
[1:44:09] didn't
[1:44:10] he and he knew it was a prophetic
[1:44:12] utterance he knew that so he was afraid
[1:44:16] it automatically brought an insecurity
[1:44:18] and a fear to him so what did he do all
[1:44:20] the children two years of of age and
[1:44:22] younger kill them all just wipe them out
[1:44:25] but there was that one wasn't there that
[1:44:28] one called Moses that was put into the
[1:44:30] reads and he was saved that was a a sign
[1:44:34] of an insecure leader that was someone
[1:44:37] who had all the power in the land with
[1:44:38] no character no Christlike
[1:44:42] character and we know it repeated
[1:44:43] exactly the same isn't it interesting
[1:44:45] how it repeated exactly the same in the
[1:44:47] time of Jesus the word came through
[1:44:49] through the Magi Herod caught wind of it
[1:44:52] oh my there's something going on in the
[1:44:54] land there's a prophetic utterance what
[1:44:57] there's a messiah oh my he's he's a baby
[1:45:01] oh my two years and under kill them all
[1:45:04] and we know that it was exactly
[1:45:06] according to scripture Matthew 2:18 in
[1:45:08] Rama was there a voice heard lamentation
[1:45:10] and weeping and great mourning Rachel
[1:45:12] weeping for her children and would not
[1:45:14] be comforted because they are not
[1:45:17] because the whole land all the children
[1:45:18] were
[1:45:19] killed Spirits don't die right
[1:45:23] power without
[1:45:26] character we know that Satan loves to go
[1:45:28] to church and he's the most religious
[1:45:31] out of
[1:45:32] everyone I uh I find it interesting when
[1:45:36] you get the folks that are I call it
[1:45:38] hyper
[1:45:39] religious hyper religious everything is
[1:45:41] absolutely spiritual some things in this
[1:45:43] life aren't really spiritual we know
[1:45:45] that we're not wrestling against flesh
[1:45:46] and blood we're wrestling against
[1:45:48] principalities and Powers but sometimes
[1:45:50] you can't even have a conversation
[1:45:51] without somebody making some sort of
[1:45:53] spiritual
[1:45:54] thing it it it it yeah we don't want to
[1:45:58] go too far one way or the other brothers
[1:45:59] and sisters we know there's a middle of
[1:46:01] the
[1:46:03] road and I know we've heard it said in
[1:46:06] our lives I think this is real good real
[1:46:10] important when we go when we pass on
[1:46:12] what would people say about us what
[1:46:15] would be the Legacy that we leave
[1:46:19] behind and we've heard it said what
[1:46:22] would our enemies say say about
[1:46:24] us and I think that's so important too
[1:46:27] what our enemies say that we we are
[1:46:29] spiteful we Christians but we're not
[1:46:32] afraid to put up our Dukes we're not
[1:46:34] afraid to go blow for blow in terms of
[1:46:37] words they can say something and we can
[1:46:39] say something they can say something and
[1:46:40] I can say something better they can say
[1:46:42] something that's really hurtful and I
[1:46:43] can get even more hurtful than them but
[1:46:46] I'm a believer I'm a Christian right I'm
[1:46:48] not afraid to tell you in the next
[1:46:49] sentence I'm a Believer
[1:46:53] what kind of character is
[1:46:55] that and I want to go further with it
[1:46:57] and say should we pass on what would our
[1:47:01] spouses say about
[1:47:03] us what would our families say about us
[1:47:06] those ones that know us the most
[1:47:10] intimately what would our children say
[1:47:12] about us I say Lord help me amen Lord
[1:47:16] help me check me examine me I don't want
[1:47:19] to be saying these words thinking that
[1:47:22] I'm anywhere cuz I know I'm nowhere
[1:47:24] without him amen but we've got to be
[1:47:27] willing to subject ourselves to his word
[1:47:29] amen
[1:47:32] wholly
[1:47:33] entirely not partially 1963 a trumpet
[1:47:37] gives an uncertain sound you know what
[1:47:38] brother Ram talks about when he says the
[1:47:40] trumpet gives an uncertain sound if you
[1:47:42] haven't heard this message I strongly
[1:47:44] recommend listening to it we know it's a
[1:47:46] it's actually a scripture but in here
[1:47:48] just a quote I've got a few quotes 146
[1:47:51] if the Church of the Living God is the
[1:47:54] Church of the Living God if the Church
[1:47:57] of the Living God is the Church of the
[1:48:00] Living God it'll put forth the word of
[1:48:03] the Living
[1:48:06] God it sounds so
[1:48:09] simple he says you don't have to add
[1:48:12] peacock feathers
[1:48:14] nowhere and every feather in there will
[1:48:16] be adjoined to a
[1:48:19] peacock you can believe that and every
[1:48:22] feather that's joined into the Church of
[1:48:24] God will be the word of God he will
[1:48:27] never inject anything else but the word
[1:48:31] amen cuz the nature of the spirit puts
[1:48:35] out only the word amen amen I'm getting
[1:48:39] to feel religious
[1:48:41] right he goes on to say not nothing you
[1:48:45] try to do nothing you
[1:48:50] manufacture so we can try and do all we
[1:48:52] want brothers and sisters but it's not
[1:48:54] going to bring us the right the right
[1:48:55] results he goes on to say you can't
[1:48:59] manufacture you can't manufacture
[1:49:02] salvation you can't manufacture the
[1:49:05] gifts you've got to Bear the gifts
[1:49:07] certainly see the Sheep doesn't
[1:49:10] manufacture wool he has wool because
[1:49:13] he's a sheep he just Bears the wool the
[1:49:17] cherry tree doesn't manufacture cherries
[1:49:20] it just Bears cherries because the life
[1:49:23] of it is that it's that way isn't it
[1:49:27] beautiful to think that the fruit of the
[1:49:29] spirit it's not even for us the fruit of
[1:49:32] the spirit is on our branches for those
[1:49:33] other people that come around to meet us
[1:49:35] so that they can pick of that fruit and
[1:49:37] say wow there's there's there's there's
[1:49:39] kindness and there's love and there's
[1:49:41] longsuffering and you know every single
[1:49:43] time I get around you I just don't
[1:49:45] understand it I just feel good you're
[1:49:47] always so happy there's so much joy in
[1:49:50] your life amen hallelujah they in of
[1:49:53] that fruit and they're eating it they're
[1:49:54] partaking of it brother the ROM says and
[1:49:57] the Church of the Living God doesn't
[1:50:00] inject this to try to make themselves
[1:50:03] look like
[1:50:04] something the Church of the Living God
[1:50:07] doesn't have to manufacture and put out
[1:50:10] there the Church of the Living God
[1:50:12] doesn't have to do all kinds of
[1:50:14] different things to try and get people
[1:50:16] around them to think that they believe
[1:50:19] they just are they just live a life amen
[1:50:24] they don't have to try to make
[1:50:25] themselves look like
[1:50:27] something they're already what they are
[1:50:30] by the grace of God Amen and the word of
[1:50:33] God is joined with them and they're
[1:50:35] joined with the word and the works that
[1:50:37] was brought forth in that perfect one
[1:50:40] Jesus Christ God manifested in flesh
[1:50:45] will produce itself through every Born
[1:50:48] Again believer
[1:50:51] amen isn't that good it just will it's
[1:50:56] not something that we have to try and
[1:50:59] manufacture amen I don't have to come to
[1:51:01] church a certain number of times in a
[1:51:03] month or in a year to be a believer I
[1:51:06] don't have to tithe a certain amount I
[1:51:08] don't have to come to prayer meetings a
[1:51:10] certain amount I don't have to go to
[1:51:11] communion service a certain amount I
[1:51:13] don't have to dress a certain way I I
[1:51:15] don't have to not smoke I don't have to
[1:51:17] not drink I don't have to not carouse I
[1:51:20] just do all of that because I
[1:51:24] am Jesus Christ God manifested in flesh
[1:51:28] will produce itself through every
[1:51:30] born-again believer he said so amen
[1:51:32] nothing else now that's something
[1:51:35] certain now we're changing gears as we
[1:51:37] as we go forwards brothers and sisters
[1:51:39] I'm not interested in talking about God
[1:51:41] sending a prophet and talking about
[1:51:43] history like we have there's tremendous
[1:51:45] stories about that but what about that
[1:51:47] to you what does God sending a prophet
[1:51:51] God having a Vindicated Propet in the
[1:51:53] land mean to you does it change your
[1:51:56] life does it make us believe the word of
[1:51:58] God more Hallelujah does it cause us to
[1:52:01] step up when we know we're falling down
[1:52:05] or does it push us back and we say oh no
[1:52:07] that's too much it it hurts brother
[1:52:09] Barry oh you're being really strong you
[1:52:12] know what where we're at we're at a
[1:52:13] place where it's not time to be playing
[1:52:15] games if we were going to be allh handed
[1:52:18] rifles today with bayonets on them and
[1:52:20] full clips of ammunition because another
[1:52:23] country was invading our country and the
[1:52:25] only way we're going to survive is so
[1:52:27] that we can get out there and actually
[1:52:29] kill the enemy and we were all handed
[1:52:31] rifles today how would we be talking
[1:52:33] would we we would we just be saying you
[1:52:36] know let's try and be strong let's not
[1:52:40] get too excited because you know people
[1:52:42] could get upset we'd be screaming amen
[1:52:45] I'd be screaming saying take no
[1:52:47] prisoners don't let those anakins live
[1:52:50] brothers and sisters take your Mountain
[1:52:52] amen you followed the Lord holy all of
[1:52:55] your life what have you got to be afraid
[1:52:57] of you're in your Promised Land am you
[1:53:01] don't have to be a prisoner and you know
[1:53:04] what happens brothers and sisters
[1:53:06] unfortunately it's the truth we can come
[1:53:08] to the place where we can become a
[1:53:09] prisoner of this word that's
[1:53:12] right we can become a prisoner of this
[1:53:15] word where we say we believe the message
[1:53:17] of the hour but we don't exercise the
[1:53:19] message of the hour if we're not willing
[1:53:21] to exercise the message of the hour we
[1:53:23] might as well not claim
[1:53:25] it now that's really strong and I
[1:53:28] wouldn't say just walk away and get fed
[1:53:30] up what I would say is get
[1:53:32] moving you've got the greatest thing
[1:53:35] that's struck this Earth since Jesus
[1:53:37] Christ the tying up of all of the Loose
[1:53:39] Ends amenallah there's nothing Stopping
[1:53:42] You brothers and sisters there's nothing
[1:53:44] stopping us the devil's going to come
[1:53:46] around and say no no no you can't the
[1:53:49] word of God says yes yes yes you can am
[1:53:53] doesn't matter if it's a giant just be
[1:53:56] like Caleb oh my but if you don't follow
[1:53:58] the word of God holy how could you be
[1:54:00] like
[1:54:01] Caleb yes sir we know the word of God
[1:54:05] says that if if our hearts don't condemn
[1:54:07] us then what we can have confidence
[1:54:10] towards the word of God we can have
[1:54:13] confidence towards the Lord but when
[1:54:15] we've got that little thing there that
[1:54:16] little thing there it's not going to
[1:54:18] work Ephesians chapter 5 going back to
[1:54:21] our our theme today about leadership
[1:54:23] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:54:26] the fear of God am you're not greater
[1:54:30] she's not
[1:54:31] less we're all children of God Amen and
[1:54:35] you know if you listen to questions and
[1:54:36] answers you hear brother bradam talk
[1:54:38] about how a Son of God ought to treat a
[1:54:41] daughter of
[1:54:43] God he ought to remember that she should
[1:54:46] be very much
[1:54:48] respected and never treated like the
[1:54:50] world like husbands treat their world
[1:54:52] worldly wives and he says it in a way
[1:54:55] that if you're wondering what I'm asking
[1:54:56] you better go listen to it because it's
[1:54:59] strong we better examine the way we
[1:55:01] treat our wives submitting ourselves one
[1:55:03] to another in the fear of God it's
[1:55:06] important if we're not willing to do
[1:55:08] that we're not going to see the power of
[1:55:09] God and and you know at the end of it it
[1:55:12] says he I speak of this great mystery
[1:55:14] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[1:55:15] church brothers and sisters Once Upon a
[1:55:17] Time this was a mystery we had a
[1:55:19] Vindicated Prophet that came and made
[1:55:20] this mystery history amen because we're
[1:55:23] talking about now the life of the
[1:55:25] husband coming into the wife the church
[1:55:29] the Lord Jesus Christ coming to life
[1:55:32] manifesting In the Flesh and if this
[1:55:34] message isn't causing Jesus Christ the
[1:55:36] same yesterday today and forever to
[1:55:38] manifest in our flesh there's something
[1:55:40] wrong with this message and I want to
[1:55:42] say clearly there's nothing wrong with
[1:55:44] this
[1:55:45] messag so who's manifesting in our flesh
[1:55:48] are we willing to subject ourselves to
[1:55:50] the word of God holy amen or in part
[1:55:55] just partially just as much as I can
[1:55:57] take it you know it's it's a bit much in
[1:56:00] strongs strongs concordance you know oh
[1:56:06] my sorry
[1:56:08] yeah ah sometimes I get a little too
[1:56:11] excited I apologize verse 29 of
[1:56:13] Ephesians chapter
[1:56:16] 6 oh maybe we'll go to 28
[1:56:23] so ought men to love their wives as
[1:56:25] their own
[1:56:27] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:56:32] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[1:56:35] own
[1:56:37] flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it
[1:56:41] even as the Lord the
[1:56:44] church I got looking at these words here
[1:56:46] hated is
[1:56:48] g344 Meo
[1:56:53] and it means to
[1:56:55] detest especially to
[1:56:58] persecute I know that sometimes in our
[1:57:02] lives the devil will come around and try
[1:57:04] and get us to actually persecute we try
[1:57:08] and get us to say to the wife oh you
[1:57:10] didn't do this and oh you didn't do that
[1:57:12] and and oh you forgot about the other
[1:57:14] thing and oh look at your hair and look
[1:57:15] at your skirt and the the clothes aren't
[1:57:17] pressed and and the house is dirty and
[1:57:19] and and and and and and and and and and
[1:57:21] and it just got me thinking about this
[1:57:23] how quickly we can begin doing this if
[1:57:24] we're not careful brothers and sisters
[1:57:27] because the word of God says that no man
[1:57:29] ever yet hated his own flesh never yet
[1:57:32] persecuted his own flesh but we know
[1:57:34] that when we have a wife she is our own
[1:57:37] flesh so when we begin to do that with
[1:57:39] her we're not hurting her even though we
[1:57:41] are hurting her we're persecuting
[1:57:44] ourselves now I'm saying that from a uh
[1:57:46] uh maybe a a selfish perspective as
[1:57:49] husbands but think about the damage to
[1:57:51] her when we start doing that if we dare
[1:57:54] start doing that think about the damage
[1:57:56] to her sometimes we can do things that
[1:57:58] takes years decades maybe
[1:58:01] forever sometimes it's impossible to
[1:58:03] heal wounds that we cause but we know
[1:58:06] nothing is impossible through the Lord
[1:58:08] Jesus
[1:58:10] Christ I love how he goes on to say for
[1:58:13] no man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[1:58:16] nourisheth what does that word
[1:58:18] nourisheth
[1:58:20] mean Tre
[1:58:23] to rear up to
[1:58:26] maturity and I always thought this was
[1:58:28] to nourish if to make sure that there
[1:58:30] was maybe some lotion and maybe the skin
[1:58:33] was nourished and you know maybe there
[1:58:35] was nutrients there was proper groceries
[1:58:37] and stuff but that's not what the word
[1:58:39] of God says at all it says that as a
[1:58:41] husband what what we're learning here
[1:58:44] what I'm learning here is that we're
[1:58:45] supposed to make sure that our wives are
[1:58:47] coming to maturity we're supposed to be
[1:58:49] raising them up that's what that word
[1:58:51] nourish means
[1:58:53] g625 e Tre to rear up to maturity I.E
[1:58:58] genitive case to cherish or train bring
[1:59:02] up and nourish husbands it's up to us to
[1:59:05] be doing this with our wives and to
[1:59:08] cherisheth
[1:59:09] it even as the Lord the church oh my who
[1:59:14] doesn't want to be cherished by the Lord
[1:59:16] today raise your hand no nobody wants to
[1:59:19] raise their hand because we all want to
[1:59:21] be cherished by the
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:25] Lord so we ought to be cherishing our
[1:59:29] wives it's G
[1:59:31] 2282 phpo probably it says to warm to
[1:59:37] brood I.E figuratively to Foster to
[1:59:40] cherish anybody ever seen a brooding
[1:59:43] hen how hens are with their young when
[1:59:46] they've hatched the the hens yeah they
[1:59:49] put their wings out they puff out and if
[1:59:51] the children children if those little
[1:59:52] chicks start poking their heads out she
[1:59:54] covers them she keeps them she you can
[1:59:57] take her and you can push her we were in
[1:59:59] Hawaii one time and we found a Broody
[2:00:01] hen with chicks under her and we kind of
[2:00:03] pushed her a little bit and and the
[2:00:04] chicks ran right over under her and she
[2:00:07] just kept puffing out and protecting him
[2:00:09] it's amazing to see that but it's to
[2:00:12] Foster to cherish to brood to keep warm
[2:00:16] who would not want to cherish their own
[2:00:20] flesh for no man ever yet hated his own
[2:00:23] flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it
[2:00:25] even as the Lord the church for we are
[2:00:28] members of his body of his flesh and of
[2:00:32] his bones for this cause shall a man
[2:00:35] leave his father and mother and shall be
[2:00:38] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[2:00:40] be one flesh there's coming a point in
[2:00:43] time in our lives brothers and sisters
[2:00:45] where we need to no longer be under our
[2:00:48] mothers we no longer need to be under
[2:00:50] our fathers but we need to actually be
[2:00:53] married to the Lord Jesus Christ where
[2:00:55] we have got to have our own experience
[2:00:57] and we know full well from the Garden of
[2:00:59] Eden that there isn't going to be three
[2:01:02] people in the marriage that was created
[2:01:04] in heaven there's only going to be two
[2:01:06] it's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:08] and his bride and they twoo are going to
[2:01:10] become one amen my now let's get into
[2:01:15] some quotes let's start preaching let's
[2:01:17] have
[2:01:18] church 1963 Christ is the mystery of God
[2:01:21] God revealed he says and as it was in
[2:01:23] the days of Noah so shall it be at the
[2:01:25] coming of the son of man and as the days
[2:01:27] of lot when a modern Billy gram and Oral
[2:01:30] Roberts went down into Sodom and
[2:01:32] preached to them sodomites and blinded
[2:01:34] their eyes see with the gospel one Angel
[2:01:37] stayed back a messenger with Abraham and
[2:01:40] the elected group the one that didn't
[2:01:43] say father Son and Holy Ghost that
[2:01:45] didn't say I saw three I didn't say
[2:01:48] Lords I saw Lord there was one God amen
[2:01:52] a messenger with Abraham and the elected
[2:01:55] group and what kind of a sign did he do
[2:01:57] see what did he call what did Abraham
[2:01:59] call him Elohim God manifested in flesh
[2:02:03] and isn't it beautiful to think when I
[2:02:04] was contemplating this brothers and
[2:02:05] sisters he came in the flesh and he sat
[2:02:08] down and he ate meat and he drank milk
[2:02:11] and he ate bread and he ate butter and
[2:02:13] it all just sort of signified to me in
[2:02:15] that moment that he came right down to
[2:02:17] where Abram was when he was giving him a
[2:02:20] name change don't think that we need to
[2:02:22] become some sort of Pious holy
[2:02:24] individual before we're going to connect
[2:02:26] with God he knows exactly where we are
[2:02:29] he'll come down and have lunch with you
[2:02:31] if you invite him if you follow his word
[2:02:33] holy amen
[2:02:36] hallelujah God manifested in
[2:02:39] flesh back in that day what about this
[2:02:42] day amen Jesus showing that he himself
[2:02:45] God in him will be manifested in
[2:02:50] where his bride am his bride in the last
[2:02:54] days he says oh my just no end to it
[2:02:57] just a revelation of God it's Eternal
[2:02:59] just keeps moving on and on I just can't
[2:03:01] help but think about the the the the
[2:03:04] scripture in Revelations let us rejoice
[2:03:06] and be exceedingly god let's be very
[2:03:08] very glad why for the marriage of the
[2:03:11] Lamb hath come we know the scripture all
[2:03:13] well and his wife hath made herself
[2:03:16] ready not not the bride many times I've
[2:03:18] quoted that the bride has made herself
[2:03:20] ready no no no it's moved signifies
[2:03:23] something intimate has happened there's
[2:03:25] a relationship there and it's not it's
[2:03:28] not the bride any longer his wife hath
[2:03:31] made herself ready how do we do that by
[2:03:33] believing this word by following this
[2:03:35] word holy that's how we do it you know
[2:03:39] sometimes we're just a little bit afraid
[2:03:41] to and that's really what it comes down
[2:03:44] to that's the bottom
[2:03:47] line I've done it this way all my life
[2:03:50] and I'll say this that's why we are
[2:03:52] where we are but when we're willing to
[2:03:54] step out by faith and say hey you know
[2:03:56] what maybe I haven't got it right maybe
[2:03:58] it hasn't worked the way that I thought
[2:04:00] it should if we're willing to step out
[2:04:02] by faith and show him that step of Faith
[2:04:05] where I'm taking my pride and I'm just
[2:04:07] going to say goodbye Pride I I don't
[2:04:09] need you anymore I trust the Lord holy
[2:04:13] I'm I'm willing and Desiring to follow
[2:04:15] his word holy in a new way that I never
[2:04:18] have before so that he could potentially
[2:04:21] bless me and you know what brothers and
[2:04:22] sisters if you're willing to do that if
[2:04:24] you say to him God be God and I'll
[2:04:26] follow you that way I Promise You by
[2:04:29] experience I'm a witness to it he will
[2:04:31] bless you
[2:04:34] amen sometimes we're just a little
[2:04:36] afraid to take God's word to to take it
[2:04:38] holy well all say we take God's word but
[2:04:40] sometimes we're just a little afraid to
[2:04:42] take it wholly and you know what it
[2:04:44] takes to do that it takes being honest
[2:04:46] we've got to be willing to be honest not
[2:04:49] just with the word but with ourselves
[2:04:50] that's right we got to be honest with
[2:04:52] ourselves and and what that means is to
[2:04:54] allow the word to correct us when we
[2:04:56] need correction and if we can't receive
[2:04:59] correction according to the word we know
[2:05:00] what we already read it says that we're
[2:05:02] not his
[2:05:05] son I just think this is so beautiful in
[2:05:08] Joshua 14 you know he talks about his
[2:05:11] Brethren that went up with him doesn't
[2:05:14] matter what anyone else does brothers
[2:05:15] and sisters doesn't matter what anybody
[2:05:17] else says it only matters where we are
[2:05:20] in our own hearts amen are we able to
[2:05:23] say that I followed you holy and you
[2:05:25] know what we might be able to look back
[2:05:26] in our lives and say you know um for so
[2:05:29] long I didn't follow him wholly and and
[2:05:32] I've been afraid to maybe take a step
[2:05:34] forward and make a change and do things
[2:05:36] differently it doesn't mean that we
[2:05:38] can't follow him wholly
[2:05:40] today and I guarantee you he's calling
[2:05:42] for that if there's someone that hasn't
[2:05:44] he wants us all to follow him wholly and
[2:05:47] if we're willing to do that we will see
[2:05:49] the power of God manifest in our lives
[2:05:51] amen we will see the character of the
[2:05:54] Lord Jesus Christ in our lives talking
[2:05:57] about the word taking on flesh I can see
[2:05:59] it's already 12 I I just my how time
[2:06:03] flies brother bradam I'll call the
[2:06:05] musicians or I we'll keep going for a
[2:06:07] while here he says we see the end time
[2:06:10] this is out of the token we see the end
[2:06:12] time signs of the Holy Ghost return back
[2:06:14] upon the people as it was in the days of
[2:06:16] lot how the Holy Spirit worked through
[2:06:17] that human flesh there that was God
[2:06:20] manifest in the flesh it's so good to
[2:06:22] look back we can say look at brother
[2:06:23] brandham God manifest In the Flesh now
[2:06:26] we don't make brother brandham God but
[2:06:27] we can see his Spirit was standing two
[2:06:29] feet from him we know that he wasn't the
[2:06:31] son of man he says I was a son of man
[2:06:34] revealing the son of man how God would
[2:06:37] manifest himself in his bride in that
[2:06:40] day and show the same sign Jesus said
[2:06:43] it'll be the same thing in the last days
[2:06:45] we see it many times brothers and
[2:06:46] sisters because we had a prophet a
[2:06:48] Vindicated Prophet come on the scene and
[2:06:49] have the signs and wonders we say unless
[2:06:52] we see the signs of Wonders we're not
[2:06:54] actually in the word I want to tell you
[2:06:56] something the only thing that's going to
[2:06:58] separate us is our willingness to be in
[2:07:00] the word if we're found in the word then
[2:07:03] we've got the greatest sign and wonder
[2:07:05] that we could ever manifest in the day
[2:07:06] in which we
[2:07:09] live and that's God manifesting himself
[2:07:13] in flesh because human beings in this
[2:07:16] age they can't line up with the word
[2:07:18] they never will they will never do it
[2:07:22] when their eyes were open 1964 but when
[2:07:25] you see the son of man revealed the word
[2:07:27] come back in human flesh a man that eat
[2:07:30] the Flesh of a calf drink the milk from
[2:07:32] a cow eat cakes that was made Upon A
[2:07:34] hear and was called Elohim amen a man
[2:07:38] with Dusty clothes on God manifest in
[2:07:41] flesh boy it sure sounds good back there
[2:07:44] doesn't it what about
[2:07:46] today where is he today brothers and
[2:07:49] sisters there he was
[2:07:52] on Earth manifest In the Flesh and said
[2:07:54] as it was in the days of Sodom when the
[2:07:56] son of man is being revealed in the last
[2:07:57] days the world would be in a Sodom
[2:08:00] condition and here it is
[2:08:03] amen when was this
[2:08:05] preached
[2:08:07] 1964 he says here it
[2:08:11] is could he see where we are
[2:08:14] today where are we today brothers and
[2:08:17] sisters here it
[2:08:19] is why
[2:08:22] here it
[2:08:26] is
[2:08:34] my I'm sorry the identific the
[2:08:36] identified maybe stand with me as we
[2:08:39] close the identified Christ of all
[2:08:48] ages remember God changes his form and
[2:08:53] morphe the Greek word means he puts on a
[2:08:56] different mask like in kmen or something
[2:09:00] or Shakespeare's plays he's like an
[2:09:02] actor he changes his
[2:09:04] form all what those prophets were that
[2:09:08] was God in those prophets Jesus said so
[2:09:12] you call them Gods who the word of God
[2:09:15] came to and here I am the Son of God how
[2:09:19] do you condemn me oh my the same thing
[2:09:21] is today it's God manifested in
[2:09:25] flesh the message of the hour the light
[2:09:28] of the day we can't
[2:09:29] have them other messages back there they
[2:09:32] have to be done lived up here we live in
[2:09:35] a glare of a
[2:09:37] light that's the greatest Deb the
[2:09:40] greatest robbery the nation's ever known
[2:09:42] was performed in England here not long
[2:09:43] ago done by false light $7 million Train
[2:09:46] Robbery never was known before known of
[2:09:49] before in history that was a great
[2:09:51] indebt a marker to the age of villains
[2:09:54] in the world and the greatest marker of
[2:09:56] villains in the age in the world that we
[2:09:58] ever live in is a false light in this
[2:10:02] hour that we're living in trying to put
[2:10:05] us back under some kind of a Creed in
[2:10:08] things when we're living

[2:10:13] Epistles that's living that's been

[2:10:25] was and we know the word of God says
[2:10:27] that were written Epistles read of all
[2:10:28] men we can say what we want to say but
[2:10:31] people are reading our
[2:10:33] lives he says that's what John the
[2:10:35] Baptist was he was the voice of one
[2:10:36] crying in the wilderness he tried to
[2:10:38] tell them that he was also Malachi 3
[2:10:41] behold I send my messenger before my
[2:10:43] face prepare the way before the people
