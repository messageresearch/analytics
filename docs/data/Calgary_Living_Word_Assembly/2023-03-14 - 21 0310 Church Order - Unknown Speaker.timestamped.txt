[22:53] [Music]
[22:57] surrender
[23:00] to thee
[23:02] what a confession that song is
[23:05] to think that's the life of a True
[23:07] Believer
[23:09] understanding that there's just no way
[23:11] we could ever pay back
[23:14] and we were never intended to pay back
[23:17] it was the free gift of God unto us his
[23:20] grace
[23:22] to his children welcome to the house of
[23:25] the Lord again
[23:26] on a Wednesday night
[23:29] we just want to remember a few prayer
[23:32] requests
[23:33] continuing in prayer for sister Vicki
[23:38] sister Grace's friend's mother
[23:41] I believe she's in Connecticut
[23:43] no
[23:46] I can't remember where she is but
[23:50] she needs a touch from the master she's
[23:52] on a ventilator
[23:54] because of kovid with pneumonia
[23:58] and naturally speaking it doesn't look
[24:00] good
[24:02] but Supernatural speaking
[24:04] Anything is Possible
[24:07] we just want to continue to remember
[24:09] Sister Becky
[24:10] we also want to remember Sister Jermaine
[24:13] and we have two unspoken requests
[24:15] tonight that we would like to bring
[24:16] Before the Throne
[24:18] and if you have a need maybe just make
[24:20] it known to him with an uplifted hand as
[24:22] we go in prayer
[24:27] we have another request for Brennan
[24:30] Brennan's wife Katie
[24:33] not sure what it is but
[24:35] we know he knows
[24:38] let's go to prayer
[24:40] gracious Heavenly Father
[24:43] Lord one more time we're so thankful
[24:45] that we can just come before your throne
[24:47] of mercy and Grace
[24:50] and Lord Jesus to know that
[24:53] when we come according to your word
[24:55] which is according to your will
[24:59] father we are experiencing the
[25:01] culmination of all of the ages
[25:04] and Lord Jesus
[25:06] more than anything we know that you are
[25:09] just waiting to hear
[25:11] our voice that you want to hear our
[25:15] confession about what your word says
[25:17] in a situation as we encounter it
[25:21] and Lord Jesus what an honor and a
[25:23] privilege it is to be a shining light in
[25:25] this Dark Age
[25:27] father we just want to remember
[25:29] Brennan's wife Katie tonight Lord we
[25:32] don't know the need but we know you do
[25:34] and father we know that you you had the
[25:37] answer before the need was ever
[25:40] manifested on the lips of brother Paul
[25:43] so father we pray that it would just be
[25:46] a strong witness of your life in brother
[25:48] Paul that it would move beyond what is a
[25:52] confession on the lips of a man to his
[25:55] staff but that it would just become the
[25:57] living Jesus Christ on Earth that it
[26:00] would be you tabernacled in flesh in our
[26:04] brother
[26:05] to his staff
[26:07] Lord we pray that it would just be a
[26:09] powerful testimony of your grace
[26:12] Lord we just want to remember Sister
[26:13] Vicki
[26:15] we haven't forgot her Lord and we know
[26:17] that you haven't forgot her father and
[26:19] Lord that you are watching over her even
[26:22] now you have been all along father we
[26:25] know that your eye is on the sparrow and
[26:27] tonight father we just thank you that
[26:29] you are watching over sister Vicki and
[26:31] father we just asked that you would
[26:33] continue to do so father according to
[26:35] your will
[26:37] father we know that sickness is not
[26:39] according to your will so father tonight
[26:41] according to the the the the the
[26:43] authority that you have vested in us as
[26:46] your children tonight we just rebuke
[26:48] that devil of illness in the name of
[26:50] Jesus Christ from our sister Vicki and
[26:52] we pray Lord that you would just raise
[26:54] her up off that bed Lord

[29:08] [Music]
[29:23] that we monitor that people are welcome
[29:25] here if they can't come in here and get
[29:27] Washed by the Water of the word then how
[29:28] will they ever
[29:29] how will they ever
[29:32] you know and the reason I'm saying this
[29:33] is there's people who actually have
[29:36] really strong beliefs that unless you
[29:38] actually come to the door at a certain
[29:40] level you won't be able to get in
[29:42] there's churches out there that way
[29:43] there's churches that believe that
[29:45] unless you're born into a lineage
[29:47] message churches message churches
[29:51] that believe if you don't get if you're
[29:52] not born in a certain lineage you'll
[29:54] never make it to heaven
[29:55] it's an antichrist Spirit brothers and
[29:57] sisters
[29:58] that is a cult
[30:00] that is a cult the message of the hour
[30:02] is not a cult the message of the hour is
[30:05] Jesus Christ on Earth again
[30:08] welcoming the publicans and the sinners
[30:12] speaking to prostitutes could you
[30:15] imagine that
[30:18] speaking to the prostitute
[30:20] allowing a prostitute to cry on his feet
[30:23] and wash his feet with her hair
[30:26] with her tears
[30:29] spending good money on an ointment
[30:33] that could have been given to the poor
[30:34] oh it could have had perfect religious
[30:36] form right
[30:38] we're not about that brothers and
[30:39] sisters no way
[30:41] that's an antichrist Spirit anything
[30:43] other
[30:44] than what the prophet says for this age
[30:46] brothers and sisters that's our
[30:47] benchmark
[30:48] it's an antichrist spirit
[30:51] and it's going to make the church
[30:52] lukewarm formal and Powerless and we're
[30:54] not into it not into it at all
[30:57] brother Branham goes on to say that
[30:59] there's fanaticism and there's
[31:00] fanaticism in every single age and
[31:01] there's fanaticism even in around the
[31:03] message and and it's just the way it is
[31:06] Devils love the truth that's where they
[31:08] come in and they get around where
[31:10] there's fanaticism he says although in
[31:11] such we have found throughout the world
[31:13] that there is much fanaticism hooked
[31:15] along with people who profess to be
[31:16] Apostolic Believers some of the most
[31:19] religious people with the most religious
[31:21] motion
[31:23] Fanatics and you know what we don't want
[31:25] to we don't want to Major on this but
[31:27] but there are people but you know what
[31:29] we've said it last time they're
[31:31] scarecrows
[31:32] and and scarecrows get raised up Satan
[31:35] raises up scarecrows around the truth to
[31:38] try and stop the True Believers from
[31:40] actually getting that Apostolic blessing
[31:43] and tonight we just want to rebuke that
[31:45] devil in the name of Jesus Christ where
[31:47] you see a scarecrow brothers and sisters
[31:49] don't run don't get scared if you see
[31:51] someone that's a little bit fanatical if
[31:53] you see someone that kind of Acts a
[31:55] little bit off maybe just take a moment
[31:57] and look at their life examine them give
[31:59] them an opportunity to speak contact
[32:01] their spirit is what brother Bradham
[32:03] said that that he did and and that's
[32:05] what Jesus did with that woman at the
[32:07] well it's the same spirit in in in all
[32:10] of us just take the time to contact a
[32:12] person and see what their spirit is and
[32:14] show them a little bit of that Apostolic
[32:17] life show them that sweet Gentle Spirit
[32:19] maybe that thundering life that we live
[32:22] could actually Thunder out that devil
[32:24] out of that person for a moment just
[32:26] long enough for that person to see that
[32:28] that sliver of light that's there in the
[32:30] last Church age
[32:32] through you
[32:34] through us don't let the scarecrows hook
[32:37] us up don't let them scare us off
[32:39] brothers and sisters
[32:42] and standing in the Gap in 63 brother
[32:44] Branham says that's how you know a
[32:45] Christian by how he lives
[32:49] so never jump any higher than you live
[32:52] so then just but there
[32:54] it's a devil making a scarecrow to keep
[32:57] the real genuine Believers away from the
[32:59] true thing of it but God help us to
[33:01] separate and be able to discern between
[33:03] right and wrong help us to separate
[33:07] not God
[33:08] we have been told to discern the spirits
[33:12] not just ask God to protect us and and
[33:15] live a narrow life that just runs down
[33:17] the middle and we don't look one way or
[33:19] the other we're supposed to interact
[33:21] with people around us and discern the
[33:23] spirits we have nothing to fear brothers
[33:24] and sisters if we have his holy spirit
[33:27] in US
[33:29] there's nothing that we should fear
[33:32] he says but God help us to separate and
[33:34] be able to discern between right and
[33:36] wrong and the word will always
[33:38] straighten that out
[33:40] out of perseverance he says but my sons
[33:42] don't be disturbed now just before his
[33:45] appearing there's going to be all kinds
[33:47] of fanaticism raised up around it always
[33:49] is it's the devil trying to put a
[33:52] scarecrow out see scare you away but
[33:55] remember the scarecrows is always at the
[33:59] good tree
[34:00] so why we're talking about this brothers
[34:02] and sisters is I Want To Set set set
[34:04] this out there sort of I just want to
[34:07] put this before us if we see gifts rise
[34:10] up in the body don't be afraid of it
[34:13] we don't want to be afraid of it
[34:15] we want allow to manifest
[34:17] and we want to encourage it because if
[34:19] it's of the word God will prosper it if
[34:22] it's not of the word God will actually
[34:24] hinder it
[34:25] but it's up to us to set that example
[34:27] it's up to us to give it the ability to
[34:29] be nurtured not be scared away because
[34:31] of something that we experienced early
[34:33] on in our Christian walks or maybe we've
[34:36] seen or heard about it in another
[34:37] message church or or church around the
[34:40] world or whatever no we just want to see
[34:43] what the Lord will do here we're trying
[34:45] to make sure that we have everything in
[34:47] place to see this Apostolic blessing so
[34:49] that when people come through these
[34:50] doors brothers and sisters we talked
[34:52] about it a long time ago I believe
[34:54] brother Branham says when we have such
[34:55] unity in the body
[34:57] there ain't one disease that can come
[34:59] through that door we can challenge any
[35:00] disease to come through that door and it
[35:03] cannot stand in the presence of God can
[35:06] you imagine if we just had one God here
[35:08] one Jesus Christ here but I can count
[35:11] one two three four five six seven eight
[35:14] nine ten eleven Lord Jesus Christ's here
[35:17] with flesh on can you imagine how many
[35:19] devils in Hell could stand in the midst
[35:22] of that omnipotence
[35:25] but you know we have to come to the
[35:26] place where we believe that brothers and
[35:28] sisters
[35:29] we've got to come to the place where we
[35:30] believe that
[35:32] brother Branham says the Scarecrow he'll
[35:34] try and scare you away but remember the
[35:36] scarecrows is always at the good tree
[35:38] just remember that not out on the old
[35:41] Sour Apples no it's always where the
[35:44] good eating's at so he said Just
[35:47] remember now there will be some raise up
[35:49] saying they're this and some saying
[35:50] they're that and some saying so forth
[35:53] and claiming Messiahs and everything
[35:54] else but don't you believe it
[35:57] now the only way to be sure is what
[36:02] take what the word says
[36:04] it's always the word brothers and
[36:05] sisters
[36:07] so we want to see the manifestation of
[36:09] the spirit in our midst it's something
[36:10] that brother Branham talked about he
[36:12] said now another thing that we believe
[36:13] that the manifestation of the spirit is
[36:15] given to every man to profit with all
[36:16] every one of us
[36:18] has the Holy Spirit every one of us has
[36:20] a gift that's going to manifest because
[36:22] of that Holy Spirit in our lives
[36:24] I'm not here to say what is or what
[36:26] isn't I don't want to analyze what gifts
[36:28] are and and how they should operate and
[36:30] what your strength is and do a color
[36:32] chart I'm not into that we have the Holy
[36:34] Ghost In Our Lives God will manifest
[36:36] that gift in your life brothers and
[36:37] sisters just keep feeding on the word
[36:39] keep watering that gift by the word
[36:42] listen to the message read the Bible
[36:44] pray and see if God won't manifest that
[36:46] gift in your life
[36:48] now we believe that when these gifts and
[36:50] so forth are operating in the church
[36:52] which we covet and desire that the
[36:54] people who are gifted by the Spirit come
[36:56] and worship with us now on most places
[36:58] we find that when these people when
[37:02] sorry now in most places we find that
[37:05] when these gifts in the people
[37:07] the people does not understand how and
[37:11] when to use these gifts
[37:13] and in doing so they only bring reproach
[37:17] and you know brothers and sisters this
[37:19] is what I'm talking about the Scarecrow
[37:21] there can be people maybe in our past
[37:23] who have done this
[37:25] who have brought reproach but that
[37:27] doesn't change the word
[37:29] it doesn't change the fact that there
[37:31] are gifts in the church
[37:34] so we don't want to be afraid we want to
[37:36] come according to the word we already
[37:38] read it the word will straighten it out
[37:41] and we'll be able to go forwards
[37:43] he says which we believe would be just
[37:46] what Satan could do to make The
[37:49] Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth
[37:51] afraid of this wonderful blessing that
[37:53] God has given to the church in these
[37:55] days the message of the hour the words
[37:58] the message of the hour people operate
[38:01] in a in a in a strange Behavior the
[38:04] devil gets into the people and they
[38:05] don't know how to operate the gifts they
[38:07] don't know how to use them and they wind
[38:08] up causing reproach to what we believe
[38:11] is the message of the hour that doesn't
[38:13] change the word that doesn't change the
[38:15] message
[38:16] doesn't change God one iota not one bit
[38:19] in our lives we don't have to be afraid
[38:21] even if someone has done that brothers
[38:22] and sisters just keep marching forward
[38:24] just keep shoulder to shoulder just keep
[38:26] real sweet just keep real love keep that
[38:29] Unity be thundering out hurt to the
[38:32] devil every time we speak with our voice
[38:35] because that's what hurts the devil
[38:37] you know we talked about it we get to
[38:39] get to the place where Satan just won't
[38:41] even know what to do with us another
[38:43] place we read Satan just won't even be
[38:45] able to find us another place we're
[38:47] reading is that we're going to be able
[38:48] to hurt the devil
[38:50] my goodness I I don't know
[38:54] people who are not according to the word
[38:56] they're the ones that will actually not
[38:57] know what to do with the gifts
[39:00] when the word is in US brothers and
[39:02] sisters we'll know
[39:04] when that inner teacher comes the spirit
[39:06] of Truth he'll lead us into all truth
[39:10] I'm just gonna fast forward here a
[39:13] little bit
[39:14] brother Branham says there's a few
[39:15] things few other things he says I think
[39:17] the first thing and we believe these
[39:19] things which I say is essential and must
[39:20] be carried out in this manner in the
[39:23] Bradham Tabernacle why
[39:26] for it to prosper in the Lord
[39:29] and I think if we had to summarize it
[39:30] that's kind of it for tonight brothers
[39:32] and sisters the reason we're talking
[39:33] about this again the reason we're trying
[39:35] to go through it real systematically
[39:36] over and over and over recap just come
[39:40] to a place and then recap and then come
[39:41] to a little further place and recap and
[39:43] go all the way through it is just so
[39:45] that we can do exactly that for it to
[39:48] prosper in the Lord we want to see this
[39:50] church prosper in the Lord we want to
[39:52] see the children prosper in the Lord we
[39:55] want to see the old people prosper in
[39:58] the Lord we want every single member of
[40:01] this mystical body of Jesus Christ to
[40:03] prosper in the Lord we don't want to
[40:05] just be coming to church just to be
[40:06] coming to church
[40:07] living below our privileges
[40:09] he says I think first that every member
[40:11] or every worshiper of the Branham
[40:13] Tabernacle should be so much in Divine
[40:15] love with each other until it would it
[40:18] would their hearts would long for each
[40:20] other when they would have to go away to
[40:22] leave each other at the end of service
[40:24] at night I'm a True Believer in Divine
[40:27] love the Apostle Paul said that was the
[40:29] evidence of the Holy Spirit
[40:32] by this matter will all men know that
[40:34] you are my disciples
[40:36] that you have love one for another
[40:39] not worried about something someone said
[40:41] and you know I I've said it so many
[40:43] times I'm just going to carry on we all
[40:45] know worshipers
[40:47] should meet together brother Branham
[40:49] says it if we have people who feel like
[40:51] they have gifts and people who really
[40:53] want to have prayer meetings and so on
[40:55] and so forth brother Branham says it
[40:57] right here that you know what we should
[40:58] do is actually meet before service and
[41:01] and and I say it I've said it I'll say
[41:04] it again I'm here at least an hour
[41:05] before many times many hours before and
[41:08] and I'll make sure that door is open for
[41:10] any person that wants to come and start
[41:12] getting in the spirit that wants to come
[41:14] and start setting that atmosphere
[41:15] because they know that that service is
[41:18] just like no other service it's going to
[41:20] be the best service ever and that's
[41:22] really what needs to happen in our
[41:23] hearts brothers and sisters forget about
[41:25] all the past Services we've had some
[41:26] good ones but what about right now today
[41:28] it's like having a Pentecostal
[41:30] experience in our lives it's like being
[41:32] saved you know what's good to talk about
[41:34] a prophet and and what God did in his
[41:36] life it's good to talk about all the
[41:37] heroes of the Bible but what good does
[41:39] that do me today I need to see that
[41:42] Apostolic blessing in my own life
[41:45] come and set that atmosphere let's do it
[41:48] together brother Branham says worshipers
[41:50] should meet together now the next thing
[41:52] we we believe that these worshipers
[41:54] should meet together these gifted people
[41:57] such as tongues people who gets
[41:59] Revelations and interpretations and so
[42:01] forth these members or these Believers
[42:04] rather should come together at least 45
[42:07] minutes or an hour before the services
[42:09] ever begin the church should be opened
[42:11] early and the Believers come together on
[42:13] these nights and at least 45 minutes to
[42:16] an hour before the service begin
[42:18] we've got people that want to have
[42:19] prayer meetings why don't we get
[42:22] together and actually have a prayer
[42:23] meeting before service
[42:25] we're going to have a jubilee brother
[42:28] Branham calls it a gastronomical jubilee
[42:30] we're going to get together and meet
[42:31] with the Lord Jesus Christ with all of
[42:33] our brothers and sisters let's bring our
[42:34] licks of fire together and see what can
[42:37] be done
[42:39] you know we we typically start half an
[42:41] hour early we're talking 15
[42:44] 15 minutes to uh 45 minutes
[42:48] earlier than that
[42:50] you know what brothers and sisters it's
[42:51] a commitment we've all got busy lives
[42:54] but you know what the Lord he wants to
[42:56] see what are we willing to do are we
[42:58] willing to sacrifice a little bit
[43:00] are we willing to give a little bit more
[43:03] we've talked about money in terms of
[43:06] tithe forget about money what about our
[43:08] time
[43:09] more than anything he wants to hear the
[43:11] confession on our lips he wants us to
[43:13] know who we are and what we're doing
[43:16] when we come together to meet in a
[43:19] service like this brothers and sisters I
[43:21] don't think that anybody should leave
[43:22] sick
[43:24] and that's just my opinion but I mean
[43:27] hey
[43:28] I've been sick I've come to church sick
[43:30] and I've left church sick I'm not going
[43:32] to say anything about anybody but you
[43:35] know
[43:35] we have an opportunity to set an
[43:37] atmosphere in this building
[43:40] and we've heard brother Bradham say it
[43:42] that
[43:43] if we can have that Unity of spirit and
[43:46] that's really what it's about brothers
[43:47] and sisters coming together and getting
[43:49] in that Unity of spirit forget about all
[43:51] the things in this life all the
[43:53] pressures of work all the pressures of
[43:54] school what somebody said what they
[43:56] didn't say all of the stuff that we deal
[43:58] with on our Cardinal level just for a
[44:00] few hours just push it all aside and see
[44:04] if we can't open up a window of heaven
[44:06] where he could pour out a blessing on
[44:08] our lives on our service that we can't
[44:10] even contain
[44:12] we have the opportunity to do that we're
[44:15] still not shut down here completely I
[44:17] mean there's only 12 people allowed but
[44:19] imagine 12
[44:21] Messiah ETS
[44:23] gathered together in one place
[44:26] thundering out a life
[44:30] imagine that
[44:33] James 2 even so faith if it hath not
[44:36] works is dead being alone yea a man may
[44:39] say thou has faith and I have work show
[44:41] me thy faith without thy works and I
[44:42] will show thee my faith by my works
[44:46] thou believest that there is one God
[44:48] thou do as well the Devils also believe
[44:51] and tremble
[44:52] and they especially tremble when that
[44:54] life starts to live out through our
[44:55] lives
[44:57] when we say you know maybe
[44:59] what I've been doing is good
[45:01] it's great and I know that God's been
[45:04] pleased but what else can I do
[45:06] what else can I try
[45:08] what else can I experience because I
[45:11] think as long as we're here brothers and
[45:12] sisters we're in a state of cultivation
[45:14] of Our Lives we we have the ability to
[45:17] go higher and go farther and not stay in
[45:20] one place and say that you know it's
[45:21] it's one and done I got saved in 1970.
[45:25] two years before you were born
[45:28] if we have that Spirit brothers and
[45:31] sisters that's an antichrist Spirit it
[45:33] is
[45:34] and it's not a fault all we need to do
[45:36] is rebuke it and move on
[45:38] we just don't need to accept that kind
[45:39] of behavior as long as we're in this
[45:41] flesh we're children children learn we
[45:44] have to learn and grow until we get to
[45:46] that place where we're on the other side
[45:48] where we see that body change you know
[45:50] Enoch pleased God and was not maybe we
[45:53] could get to that place in our own lives
[45:55] until that great day
[45:58] we want to see Jesus
[46:01] speaking about Divine love and questions
[46:03] and answers but it's accepting the
[46:05] person Jesus Christ and these other
[46:07] things come right on in and they fit
[46:09] together that every member in this body
[46:11] this morning this evening let this
[46:13] little group of people if we could pull
[46:15] the curtains down along each side and
[46:17] every person in here receive the person
[46:20] of Christ Jesus
[46:23] there wouldn't never be a fuss
[46:25] there would never be an argument
[46:27] there would just be perfect love you
[46:30] know some people would say yeah sure
[46:31] that's great let's get out the guitar
[46:33] and we'll sing Kumbaya and everything
[46:35] will be fine brothers and sisters we're
[46:37] talking about
[46:38] the Glorious Church Without spot a
[46:40] wrinkle that bride of Jesus Christ the
[46:42] one that he calls his own
[46:44] Mark 16 in action
[46:46] the mature Christian Church the ones
[46:49] that actually believe the message of the
[46:51] hour
[46:52] he says there wouldn't never be a fuss
[46:54] there would never be an argument there'd
[46:56] just be perfect love
[46:58] his love divine love beyond
[47:01] comprehension
[47:04] totally Beyond everything that we can
[47:05] think we wouldn't be fussed why would we
[47:08] be fussed because it's his church it's
[47:10] his program he's got everything under
[47:12] control if we've got a job it's because
[47:14] he gave it to us if we've got Health
[47:16] it's because he gave it to us if we've
[47:18] got a family it's because he gave it to
[47:20] us if we've got a church it's because he
[47:22] gave it to us if we've got an
[47:24] understanding of the message of the hour
[47:25] it's because he gave it to us brothers
[47:27] and sisters it's not because of
[47:28] something we've done it's not because of
[47:30] something someone's taught us it's
[47:32] because of his Sovereign Grace to us
[47:33] because of election
[47:36] what do we have to fear what do we have
[47:38] to get upset about
[47:40] there just be perfect love you would
[47:42] still believe this and believe that we'd
[47:44] still have our opinions and our and our
[47:46] lives but we just wouldn't Express them
[47:48] we'd run our thoughts through the filter
[47:49] of the word in our lives we would take
[47:51] every thought into captivity and not say
[47:54] that's just the way I'm created I can't
[47:56] control my mouth the word says you can
[48:01] there'd be perfect love you'd still
[48:03] believe this and believe that but it
[48:06] would just be so full of love you just
[48:08] see he says that's it now Jesus said by
[48:11] their fruit you shall know them and the
[48:13] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[48:14] long-suffering goodness meekness and
[48:17] gentleness I'm gonna just I'm just gonna
[48:19] book on that with this thought
[48:22] that just because we might see someone
[48:24] that really can't control their mouth
[48:27] but they love the lord they're still a
[48:30] son or a daughter they're a sibling in
[48:32] Christ and we need to encourage them the
[48:35] word says to exhort them even more so as
[48:37] you see the day approaching don't slam
[48:40] them and say oh they just talk whatever
[48:41] they think you don't got no filter all
[48:43] that business I don't have to listen to
[48:45] them listen to them they're they're not
[48:47] even saved don't do that
[48:49] pray for them
[48:51] encourage them
[48:52] tell them
[48:54] brother I sure love you when the devil
[48:56] wants you to say can't stand that guy
[48:58] call him up and say brother I sure
[49:00] appreciate you why not because you're
[49:02] lying because the prophet that we all
[49:04] believe to be the prophet said do the
[49:06] opposite
[49:08] do the opposite
[49:10] and see what happens when that Divine
[49:12] love starts to get projected what
[49:13] happens when we project Divine love
[49:15] brothers and sisters Glory
[49:18] you know what he goes on to say
[49:20] justification sanctification baptism of
[49:22] the Holy Ghost it's not another step of
[49:24] Grace but it's more of the same Grace
[49:27] that's what it is brothers and sisters
[49:29] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is not just
[49:31] taking us picking us up cleaning us up
[49:33] setting us aside for service and then
[49:35] giving us an anointing on the outside of
[49:37] our bodies that's going right down into
[49:38] the soul of who we are our very essence
[49:41] it's actually the Capstone to our life
[49:44] to our own pyramids it's that Capstone
[49:46] Revelation that happens to us the Holy
[49:49] Ghost it's more of the same Grace we
[49:51] believe in the New Testament teachings
[49:53] and Paul the Apostle was called and
[49:55] chosen vessel elected by God to be sent
[49:58] to the Gentile Church to set it in order
[49:59] this is what brother Branham says
[50:01] we believe in full immersion water
[50:03] baptism according to Acts 2 38 in the
[50:05] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[50:07] Ghost not the name of the father and the
[50:10] name of the son and the name of the Holy
[50:11] Ghost not three people not three
[50:13] separate entities but one one God when
[50:17] John made it up through that door in
[50:19] heaven he looked and he saw one throne
[50:21] and he saw one sitting on the throne and
[50:23] he only heard one voice speak to him one
[50:27] we baptize full immersion water baptism
[50:30] as Paul preached and you know what we
[50:32] believe the same promise for today but
[50:34] you know it goes a little bit further
[50:36] than that because there was a time where
[50:38] we prophesied in part and and we spoke
[50:41] in part but we didn't see that that
[50:44] which was perfect was come then but you
[50:46] know brothers and sisters if we have the
[50:48] ability to receive the message of the
[50:49] hour that which is perfect is come
[50:52] that's what the message of the hour is
[50:54] it's the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:56] and revealing himself to those who have
[50:59] ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart
[51:01] to receive it
[51:03] it's not just enough to be justified
[51:04] it's not just enough to be Sanctified
[51:06] and it's not just enough to be justified
[51:09] and Sanctified and it's not even enough
[51:11] just to have the Holy Ghost
[51:14] brother Branham said you can have the
[51:15] Holy Ghost every day of your life every
[51:17] hour of your life and still go to hell
[51:20] it's a powerful statement and we'll have
[51:22] to drill down on that sometime but
[51:24] really it just means that you can't have
[51:25] it on the outside on your flesh even
[51:27] though you can you can't have it on your
[51:30] spirit which changes you and makes you
[51:32] talk good and sound good and you act
[51:33] good and you're so kind and nice but you
[51:35] just don't believe one part of the word
[51:37] it's right down inside into that Soul
[51:39] when it comes into the soul you become a
[51:42] new creature in Christ Jesus you're not
[51:44] being actually conformed up until that
[51:46] point you're just conforming but you
[51:48] have to be transformed by the renewing
[51:51] of your mind by the washing by the water
[51:52] of the word it's not just enough to go
[51:55] all through all of the exercise and and
[51:57] be there and Justified and Sanctified
[51:59] and and filled with the Holy Ghost I can
[52:01] come to church and act all good it's not
[52:03] about that it's about being able to be
[52:05] the living word for our day that's why
[52:08] this church is called that the Living
[52:10] Word Calgary Living Word
[52:12] it's not just about coming and hearing a
[52:15] word it's living it
[52:16] and if we're talking about anything else
[52:19] we need to just correct that because
[52:20] it's not about us associating with a
[52:23] place that that preaches the Living Word
[52:25] even though that's what it is brothers
[52:26] and sisters it's about getting people to
[52:28] Christ Christ in you the hope of glory
[52:30] having the Living Word in you being an
[52:35] actual Living Word to those people
[52:36] around you
[52:39] you know we have to have the baptism of
[52:41] the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters I'm
[52:43] not discounting that I'm making sure
[52:45] that we're just going further with it it
[52:47] has to be the literal life of Jesus
[52:49] Christ Living out through us not just
[52:51] something that we do
[52:52] this is the message for our day in times
[52:55] past it was only a portion but today
[52:56] it's the absolute fullness of the word
[52:59] the absolute fullness of the word all
[53:01] seven seals are open
[53:03] that cloud happened for a reason
[53:06] he set his foot on the land and his foot
[53:07] on the sea and said there shall be time
[53:09] no more all of the revelation of Jesus
[53:12] Christ the entire mystery of God is now
[53:15] about to be revealed and today we have
[53:18] given that entire word we have all of it
[53:21] at our disposal brothers and sisters and
[53:23] that's what we say living up to our our
[53:25] our potential living up to our privilege
[53:29] understanding that if we're Messiah it's
[53:31] if we have Jesus Christ Living out
[53:33] through us his holy spirit now permeates
[53:35] through our very being
[53:37] what devil can stand before you
[53:41] there's not one devil that can stand
[53:43] before you
[53:45] if you have the Holy Ghost
[53:48] that she would have that testimony in
[53:50] her world in her surrounding in her
[53:52] sphere of influence father to all those
[53:54] people around her Lord that you wouldn't

[56:17] .
[56:24] we'll look at church order one more time
[56:26] and hopefully we'll
[56:29] we'll wrap it up tonight
[56:32] I believe that we've covered it all
[56:34] quite thoroughly and there might be
[56:36] still things that we have to talk about
[56:38] with it but
[56:40] I don't know how much longer I can stay
[56:43] put on this topic
[56:45] I feel so inspired about so much else
[56:50] so tonight in Hebrews chapter 10 let's
[56:52] read verse 23
[56:55] to 25.
[56:58] Hebrews 10 23.
[57:01] let us hold fast let us hold fast the
[57:06] profession of our faith without wavering
[57:09] for he is faithful that promised
[57:12] and let us consider one another to
[57:15] provoke unto love and to Good Works
[57:19] not forsaking the assembling of
[57:21] ourselves together as the manner of some
[57:23] is
[57:24] but exhorting one another
[57:26] and so much more the more as ye see the
[57:30] day approaching
[57:31] how many sees that day approaching
[57:35] let's turn over to Malachi chapter 3.
[57:43] Malachi chapter 3 verse 16 to 18.
[57:51] Malachi chapter 3 verse 16.
[57:55] than they that feared the Lord
[57:58] spake often one to another
[58:01] and the Lord hearkened and heard it
[58:04] and a book of remembrance was written
[58:07] before him for them that feared the Lord
[58:10] and that thought upon his name
[58:14] and they shall be mine saith the Lord of
[58:16] hosts in that day when I make up my
[58:18] jewels
[58:19] and I will spare them as a man spareth
[58:22] his own son that serveth him
[58:25] then shall ye return and discern between
[58:28] the righteous and the wicked between him
[58:31] that serveth God and him that serveth
[58:35] him not
[58:36] let's just bow one more time
[58:39] gracious Heavenly Father we just are so
[58:42] thankful for the scripture that you've
[58:44] given us
[58:45] Lord and the ears to hear what the
[58:48] spirit saith unto the church and the
[58:50] eyes to be able to see the things that
[58:52] all the sages and the prophets of of the
[58:55] ages desired to look upon but father you
[58:58] you have chosen us father to be here and
[59:01] to have these abilities not by our
[59:03] strength as we as we heard tonight not
[59:05] by something that we could ever do but
[59:07] simply by your grace father Lord Jesus
[59:10] tonight we accept
[59:12] what you have given us we accept your
[59:15] provided way and Lord we pray that you
[59:17] would just open this word to us one more
[59:19] time that you would just speak to us
[59:21] father lip to ear that Lord I could just
[59:24] get out of the way now and Lord just
[59:26] allow you to use me as a vessel for your
[59:28] children to be fed One More Time Lord I
[59:31] pray that your children wouldn't stumble
[59:33] at the vessel Lord that they wouldn't
[59:34] stumble at the veil that they would
[59:36] recognize you speaking tonight
[59:39] father we just love you and we thank you
[59:41] and we just bless your name in Jesus
[59:43] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[59:46] tonight you may be seated
[59:51] this scripture here is just continually
[59:54] speaking to me verse 16 through 18.
[59:58] then they that feared the Lord spake
[1:00:00] often one to another and the Lord
[1:00:02] hearkened and you know just to have
[1:00:04] Fellowship one to another what a
[1:00:07] tremendous thing it is just to have a
[1:00:09] conversation with someone someone that
[1:00:11] you know believes what you believe
[1:00:13] brothers and sisters of like Precious
[1:00:15] Faith what a tremendous thing it is
[1:00:18] before we get going too far we just have
[1:00:21] a few announcements one of them that's
[1:00:23] fairly important is that we have a time
[1:00:25] change coming up this Sunday
[1:00:28] and uh so Saturday night before you go
[1:00:31] to bed you want to make sure that you
[1:00:32] set your clocks ahead we lose an hour
[1:00:35] spring forward and and fall behind fall
[1:00:39] back
[1:00:39] in the fall we'll change it back again
[1:00:41] but uh so now the days are are getting
[1:00:45] longer spring is in the air you can hear
[1:00:48] the birds they have a different song
[1:00:51] and you know brothers and sisters I just
[1:00:53] we all believe it when the resurrection
[1:00:55] happens Springtime happens there's just
[1:00:57] a different song in the heart of a
[1:00:58] Believer because we can see that that
[1:01:01] day draws close we know that
[1:01:02] Resurrection is imminent and it just
[1:01:05] changes our song it put us puts a spring
[1:01:07] in our step we just feel so good to feel
[1:01:10] that sun shine on us again I just uh
[1:01:13] it's amazing it just keeps taking me
[1:01:15] back every spring to it's the rising of
[1:01:17] the Sun and uh
[1:01:20] I just guess that's the way the Lord has
[1:01:22] it set up but uh time change this Sunday
[1:01:24] March 14th 2 A.M probably do it before
[1:01:28] you go to bed don't be up at two
[1:01:31] um
[1:01:32] it feels better Sunday morning when
[1:01:33] you're not up that late
[1:01:36] we have brother Mervin in Lethbridge on
[1:01:38] Sunday
[1:01:39] pray for him and we have a virtual young
[1:01:41] people's coming up on the 19th
[1:01:44] Friday night so
[1:01:47] in our scriptures tonight just really
[1:01:49] spoke to me that word hearkened
[1:01:52] and you know as I was
[1:01:54] meditating on this I just I just thought
[1:01:56] about
[1:01:57] I believe it was Nathaniel that was
[1:01:59] under the tree
[1:02:01] and you know when the disciples came and
[1:02:03] they got him and they said we found the
[1:02:05] Messiah you need to come and see don't
[1:02:08] just listen to what we're saying
[1:02:10] actually physically come and see what we
[1:02:13] found see this man and when he got there
[1:02:16] he said to him behold an Israelite in
[1:02:20] whom there is no guile he was able to
[1:02:23] discern the thoughts that was in his
[1:02:24] heart he understood who he was but he
[1:02:28] also demonstrated that he understood
[1:02:29] that in the words that he spoke to him
[1:02:32] and I just I just thought man
[1:02:35] isn't that wonderful every time that we
[1:02:38] we just meditate on him
[1:02:41] he's hearkening to our thoughts
[1:02:43] just like he did there in the gospel
[1:02:46] just like he did for Nathanael he saw
[1:02:49] him when he was under the tree
[1:02:50] meditating on him having having just
[1:02:54] that time that quiet time of meditation
[1:02:56] according to what he was taught in his
[1:02:59] tradition and you know as we as Sons and
[1:03:01] Daughters of God as we have that desire
[1:03:03] to meditate on him whether we're in our
[1:03:06] car or whether we're at work or whether
[1:03:08] we're at church or in the morning when
[1:03:10] we get up or just when we're going to
[1:03:12] sleep the the first thing we think about
[1:03:14] when we wake and the last thing we think
[1:03:16] about when we lose Consciousness and go
[1:03:18] into a dream
[1:03:20] hearkening unto the Lord
[1:03:23] thinking about him
[1:03:27] you know the word we read tonight it
[1:03:29] says then they'd have feared the Lord
[1:03:30] spake often once in another
[1:03:32] and exhorted one another even more so as
[1:03:35] they seen the day approaching
[1:03:37] not just the physical gathering together
[1:03:39] but exhorting one another how will men
[1:03:43] know that you love me
[1:03:46] by the love you have one for another
[1:03:49] looking past the veil looking past the
[1:03:52] Flesh and saying you know maybe my
[1:03:54] brother says those things and I just
[1:03:55] don't believe that he means it that way
[1:03:58] having having a testimony in this world
[1:04:01] that you can't tell my friends from my
[1:04:03] enemies
[1:04:05] because of that divine nature that is in
[1:04:07] me it's it's the dove leading the lamb
[1:04:10] it's not a wolf nature no it's not a
[1:04:14] dead man that you can kick and it still
[1:04:16] comes to life again call him a hypocrite
[1:04:18] and see what happens
[1:04:21] just what brother Branham said that's
[1:04:23] that's his words
[1:04:24] dead men don't move when you kick them
[1:04:28] but many of us were just a little bit
[1:04:30] too alive still is what brother Branham
[1:04:32] says I say Lord help me
[1:04:35] but the Lord hearkened so I just that
[1:04:38] spoke to me that word I looked it up in
[1:04:40] in in in the old dictionary it says to
[1:04:43] listen to lend an ear to attend to what
[1:04:46] is uttered
[1:04:48] what are we uttering brothers and
[1:04:49] sisters
[1:04:51] are we moaning
[1:04:52] and groaning
[1:04:54] because of the trials we've got
[1:04:57] or are we saying blessed be the name of
[1:04:59] the Lord the lord giveth and the lord
[1:05:01] taketh away whatever he wants done is is
[1:05:04] his will and it's going to work out for
[1:05:06] the good because I know he's my father
[1:05:08] and he knows my name he's got everything
[1:05:10] under his control and all I need to do
[1:05:13] is just praise His name because it's
[1:05:14] going to bring out a character in me
[1:05:16] that he's looking for
[1:05:19] to listen to lend an ear to attend to
[1:05:22] what is uttered with eagerness or
[1:05:24] curiosity can you imagine that
[1:05:27] God Almighty is is attending to us it's
[1:05:30] no accident this word was chosen there's
[1:05:32] no accident this interpretation was
[1:05:33] written there's no accident that we have
[1:05:35] this interpretation of it in terms of
[1:05:37] the the dictionary definition from that
[1:05:40] era to attend to what is uttered with
[1:05:43] eagerness or curiosity
[1:05:47] do you ever do you ever listen to
[1:05:48] Children talk
[1:05:50] as a parent and just listen to it with
[1:05:52] eagerness and curiosity
[1:05:55] maybe not even as a parent I I know I've
[1:05:58] heard brother Gilbert talk about being
[1:06:00] in the school and understanding the the
[1:06:01] needs in children's lives and seeing
[1:06:03] children who have strong needs but being
[1:06:06] able to just listen with curiosity and
[1:06:09] understand some of the trials that
[1:06:12] children are going through just by the
[1:06:13] way they talk
[1:06:14] but to listen to
[1:06:16] what is uttered with eagerness or
[1:06:19] curiosity this is talking about God
[1:06:21] hearkening
[1:06:23] to The Voice
[1:06:25] they that feared the Lord do you fear
[1:06:27] the lord tonight they that feared the
[1:06:29] Lord spake often one to another and the
[1:06:31] Lord hearkened and heard it
[1:06:33] and a book of remembrance was written
[1:06:35] before him for them that feared the Lord
[1:06:38] that thought upon his name
[1:06:40] it goes from from speaking
[1:06:44] to thinking about his name that's why I
[1:06:46] said that thought of Nathaniel how many
[1:06:48] times do we Ponder the Lord do we Ponder
[1:06:51] his greatness do we Ponder how many
[1:06:53] times he's bailed us out of the of the
[1:06:55] of the trials and troubles we get
[1:06:57] ourselves into how many times does he do
[1:07:00] it we think about his name how many
[1:07:02] times we think upon his name he hearkens
[1:07:05] to us
[1:07:06] with eagerness or curiosity
[1:07:09] to attend to regard to give heed to what
[1:07:12] is uttered to observe or obey to listen
[1:07:15] to
[1:07:16] attend
[1:07:18] to Grant or comply with
[1:07:21] the Lord hearkened and heard it
[1:07:24] and a book of remembrance was written
[1:07:26] before him for them that feared the Lord
[1:07:29] I can't help but think that that that
[1:07:31] this is exactly a type of the story of
[1:07:35] Esther
[1:07:36] and how King ahasurus had a book of
[1:07:40] remembrance written about the events
[1:07:42] that happened in his day-to-day life and
[1:07:46] how one time it was brought to his
[1:07:48] attention through the reading of that
[1:07:50] book that Mordecai actually saved his
[1:07:53] life Mordecai did something for him
[1:07:56] you know he was rewarded for it but just
[1:07:58] to think that this is exactly in line
[1:08:00] with that story and it's exactly in line
[1:08:03] with our lives a book of remembrance is
[1:08:06] written about us
[1:08:07] is tremendous
[1:08:09] just tremendous every time we gather
[1:08:11] together and talk about his name
[1:08:14] even more so as we see the day
[1:08:15] approaching every time we call one
[1:08:17] another on the phone even more so as we
[1:08:19] see the day approaching there's a book
[1:08:21] of remembrance written
[1:08:24] before him
[1:08:27] tonight I want to carry on with church
[1:08:29] order and I just have a different little
[1:08:31] bit of a different quote that I want to
[1:08:32] read tonight
[1:08:34] and uh I heard something just profound
[1:08:37] this week that just I just have to say
[1:08:40] it because really what we're talking
[1:08:41] about here is having a church that
[1:08:44] follows the doctrine of Paul
[1:08:47] that follows the doctrine of William
[1:08:49] Miriam Branham that follows the doctrine
[1:08:51] of the Pentecostal fathers that they
[1:08:54] will change the heart of the children
[1:08:56] that has already turned the hearts of
[1:08:58] the children back to that Pentecostal
[1:08:59] faith and not a Pentecostal Doctrine but
[1:09:03] a Pentecostal experience the true
[1:09:05] experience of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:09:08] know
[1:09:08] brothers and sisters we have authority
[1:09:10] and and I don't think we need to live
[1:09:12] below our privilege we need to live
[1:09:14] right up to our privilege and I think
[1:09:15] the more that we actually talk about
[1:09:17] these things the more the book of
[1:09:18] remembrance is going to be written about
[1:09:20] us the more angels are going to attend
[1:09:22] our way because we're actually
[1:09:23] confessing the truth about who we are
[1:09:26] and the authority that we have imagine
[1:09:28] if we never confess the truth about the
[1:09:31] authority that we have brother Bradham
[1:09:33] says God can't do anything for you
[1:09:35] unless you first confess it
[1:09:40] we need to make sure that we confess it
[1:09:42] so anyways when I was growing up I
[1:09:44] remember our pastor Lucas saying at the
[1:09:46] end of the service you know he'd say God
[1:09:48] bless you the Lord keep you or whatever
[1:09:50] go on and be a nuisance to the devil
[1:09:52] I always thought it was kind of a joke
[1:09:54] you know going to be a nuisance to the
[1:09:56] devil how do you do that the devil's a
[1:09:57] nuisance to us well here we have a
[1:09:59] prophet in our day saying that you don't
[1:10:00] need to be a nuisance to him you can
[1:10:02] actually be thunder to the devil
[1:10:07] says all right here was voices Oh how we
[1:10:10] need in Jeffersonville thousands of
[1:10:13] lived voices
[1:10:15] so we could just take that out and say
[1:10:16] how we need in Calgary
[1:10:19] how we need in Canada
[1:10:21] how we need in Jeffersonville thousands
[1:10:23] of lived voices
[1:10:25] the Thunder of God thundering out in
[1:10:28] sweetness
[1:10:29] and Holiness Purity undefiled lives
[1:10:32] walking around in the Earth today
[1:10:34] without a blemish
[1:10:36] can you imagine that can we live up to
[1:10:38] that
[1:10:39] you know we we can't on our own
[1:10:43] but if we can just accept what his word
[1:10:44] says about us and come his provided way
[1:10:48] then we fit that description exactly
[1:10:50] brothers and sisters exactly that
[1:10:52] description he says yes sir real
[1:10:55] Christians that's Thunder against the
[1:10:57] enemy
[1:10:58] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:11:00] holler the devil don't care how much you
[1:11:03] can jump
[1:11:04] how much you can do this or Shout
[1:11:08] but this is what caught me was this
[1:11:10] statement right here he says but what
[1:11:12] hurts the devil
[1:11:14] how many wants to hurt the devil
[1:11:16] but What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[1:11:19] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:11:24] say anything to him call him anything
[1:11:27] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:11:30] right on he says oh my that throws him
[1:11:33] away that shakes that's the Thunder that
[1:11:37] shakes the devil
[1:11:39] brothers and sisters we're talking about
[1:11:41] a glorious church here in Calgary
[1:11:44] Alberta without spot or wrinkle this
[1:11:46] isn't Calgary living words church this
[1:11:48] isn't brother Barry's church this isn't
[1:11:50] any man's church this is the Church of
[1:11:53] the Living God the mystical body of
[1:11:55] Jesus Christ
[1:11:57] he's doing his work here through every
[1:12:00] single one of us and when we can come
[1:12:02] according to the word that he has given
[1:12:04] us for our day to realize that we truly
[1:12:07] are that Sanctified bride Justified
[1:12:09] Sanctified filled with the baptism of
[1:12:11] the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters two
[1:12:13] omnipotents when they come together
[1:12:14] that's deity in flesh that becomes God
[1:12:17] you are a son of God his Spirit comes
[1:12:20] down upon you it's no longer you it's no
[1:12:23] longer just him it's it's it's together
[1:12:25] as one
[1:12:27] when you speak he speaks
[1:12:30] but you know the Devil comes around and
[1:12:31] says well you said that before and it
[1:12:33] didn't work so you know why would you
[1:12:35] say that again why would you have that
[1:12:37] confession again it just didn't work out
[1:12:40] the way you thought that it should
[1:12:43] he's not interested in in our opinions
[1:12:45] about maybe what what's gone on or
[1:12:47] hasn't gone on he just wants us to
[1:12:49] confess it brothers and sisters
[1:12:52] but imagine you know in this quote if
[1:12:54] you look it up it's in Revelation
[1:12:58] um part four uh Revelation chapter four
[1:13:01] sorry part three in 1961.
[1:13:04] um I would say look it up if if you feel
[1:13:06] inclined it's powerful before and after
[1:13:09] the quote that I just read
[1:13:11] um if you were to just look up What
[1:13:13] Hurts The Devil it'll bring it up just
[1:13:15] like that
[1:13:17] think about that What Hurts The Devil
[1:13:19] think about how the devil just loves to
[1:13:21] hurt us What Hurts The Devil brothers
[1:13:22] and sisters it's that sweet consecrated
[1:13:24] life it's not screaming and shouting
[1:13:27] it's not pouring oil on people it's it's
[1:13:30] not doing all of the religious motions
[1:13:32] it's living a sweet consecrated life so
[1:13:36] that people in this world can see Jesus
[1:13:39] Christ on Earth in flesh
[1:13:42] we've said it before that our children
[1:13:44] they need to see God in flesh they don't
[1:13:46] need to see a traditional form of
[1:13:47] worship they don't need to see us just
[1:13:49] come to church and go home come to
[1:13:50] church and go home come to church and go
[1:13:52] home and every time it's the same thing
[1:13:54] nothing ever changes it's always the
[1:13:56] same it's not that no we need to show
[1:13:59] our children that we serve a living God
[1:14:00] that he is alive and well and where is
[1:14:03] he he's in us he's not just somewhere
[1:14:06] else he's not in a geographical location
[1:14:08] he hasn't hallowed any ground even
[1:14:11] though I stand corrected he did Hollow
[1:14:13] some ground one time for Moses he told
[1:14:15] him kick off your shoes because the
[1:14:16] ground that you stand on is hallowed but
[1:14:18] it didn't stay that way did it it was
[1:14:20] only in that moment while he was there
[1:14:22] that that ground was hallowed but you
[1:14:24] know brothers and sisters everywhere you
[1:14:26] walk is Hallowed Ground if you have his
[1:14:28] spirit in you you set an atmosphere in
[1:14:31] your life to the people around you oh my
[1:14:34] that throws him away that's the Thunder
[1:14:36] that shakes the devil it's that
[1:14:38] consecrated life it's understanding that
[1:14:40] his Spirit living out through us
[1:14:42] it does something and Satan is going to
[1:14:45] do everything in his power to try and
[1:14:48] make us believe that nothing is changing
[1:14:50] nothing is changing he's not scared he's
[1:14:53] not afraid and he's not because of
[1:14:55] fervent prayers and he's not afraid
[1:14:57] because we know all the quotes and he's
[1:14:59] not afraid because we know all the
[1:15:01] scriptures what he is afraid of is if we
[1:15:03] can live the life
[1:15:04] that is what it comes down to brothers
[1:15:06] and sisters tonight we're talking about
[1:15:08] church order like I said we're going to
[1:15:10] try and wrap it up I just wanted to set
[1:15:12] that sort of bar for the service tonight
[1:15:14] because I believe we're going higher
[1:15:17] we're going to go farther we're going to
[1:15:18] move on from just talking about church
[1:15:20] order to seeing his life living out
[1:15:23] through us because that's the key that's
[1:15:24] the critical Factor if he doesn't we
[1:15:27] don't have his life living out through
[1:15:28] us then what are we doing
[1:15:30] we have to see his life living out
[1:15:32] through us and and we have a specific
[1:15:34] order in the church and that's why we've
[1:15:36] talked about this there's a very
[1:15:38] specific order
[1:15:39] um you know if somebody's gonna buy a
[1:15:41] house they need to go and and do an
[1:15:43] inspection on the house and just make
[1:15:44] sure that everything is fine and and you
[1:15:47] know airplanes before you fly them every
[1:15:49] single time you have to do a little
[1:15:51] inspection just to make sure that
[1:15:52] everything is there all the nuts and
[1:15:54] bolts are tight everything looks in
[1:15:56] order you have to go through the
[1:15:58] checklist to make sure that everything
[1:15:59] is right before you you fly your
[1:16:01] pre-flight you know brothers and sisters
[1:16:03] in the church I think it's worth our
[1:16:05] while to make sure that everything that
[1:16:07] we do
[1:16:16] people that don't understand why
[1:16:19] so that's why we're doing this and and
[1:16:21] hopefully we can just move on from this
[1:16:24] this whole Theory tonight
[1:16:26] Lord willing you know we're talking
[1:16:28] about our church being an Apostolic
[1:16:29] church with an Apostolic blessing
[1:16:31] understanding the same life that the
[1:16:32] apostles lived when Jesus was here those
[1:16:36] those men that walked around who we look
[1:16:37] at and maybe classify as Heroes you know
[1:16:40] the the two that went up to the gate
[1:16:43] beautiful and said to the the beggar
[1:16:44] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:16:46] I have give I Thee I have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:48] and I'm willing to impart it to you just
[1:16:50] rise up and walk
[1:16:52] you know brothers and sisters that's
[1:16:53] what we're talking about we're not
[1:16:55] talking about the form and and looking
[1:16:57] good and acting good and speaking good
[1:16:59] and and having everything set just in
[1:17:01] order because we live in in a really
[1:17:03] good church and we attend a church and
[1:17:05] it's an association it's not about that
[1:17:07] it's about understanding that we might
[1:17:09] look like Fanatics to people the way we
[1:17:11] worship the way in which you call heresy
[1:17:14] that's how I worship God brothers and
[1:17:16] sisters it's not about perfect form what
[1:17:19] it's about is having his life live out
[1:17:20] through us and when his life lives out
[1:17:22] through us we are going to look like
[1:17:24] Heretics we're not going to look like
[1:17:26] normal people the apostles when they or
[1:17:28] the 120 when they came out of that room
[1:17:30] the upper room they were stumbling
[1:17:32] around and and the normal people in the
[1:17:34] world seemingly normal we're calling
[1:17:36] them drunk people
[1:17:38] seeing it was the ninth hour of the day
[1:17:40] and they had already been into the wine
[1:17:42] they were stumbling around like drunks
[1:17:45] being formal you know what that we know
[1:17:47] what that says
[1:17:49] sorry what the uh the Bible says is that
[1:17:52] the laodicean church will be lukewarm
[1:17:55] formal and Powerless and the Antichrist
[1:17:57] spirit will creep into the church
[1:17:58] causing it to be so
[1:18:00] brothers and sisters if we're lukewarm
[1:18:02] we need to get hot or we need to get
[1:18:04] cold is what the word says the laodicea
[1:18:06] the word to the land of the sea in
[1:18:07] churches I would that you were hot or
[1:18:09] that you were called but because you're
[1:18:10] neither I'm just going to spew you out
[1:18:12] because you're lukewarm and you make me
[1:18:14] sick we don't want to be that way
[1:18:17] I don't even want to be talking this way
[1:18:18] forgive me I I
[1:18:20] don't know why it goes that way forgive
[1:18:22] me we want we want to be an Apostolic
[1:18:24] Church living an Apostolic blessing not
[1:18:27] talking about it that's what it comes
[1:18:29] down to tonight we want to be living
[1:18:30] that Apostolic blessing showing the
[1:18:32] world around us Jesus Christ with flesh
[1:18:35] on him
[1:18:36] there's no members as joiners remember
[1:18:39] we've talked about all these I'm just
[1:18:40] gonna
[1:18:41] go many membered body is what we're
[1:18:44] talking about not joiners we don't hand
[1:18:46] out membership cards you can't tithe
[1:18:48] your way into the church you can't say
[1:18:51] that I want to do something great for
[1:18:52] the church and that you'll just put my
[1:18:54] name on the book The Only book there is
[1:18:56] here in this church is this book right
[1:18:58] here and if you can come to this church
[1:19:00] and hear the message of the hour then
[1:19:02] your name is already on the book brother
[1:19:04] and sister it's not something you can do
[1:19:06] it's the many membered body the mystical
[1:19:08] body of Jesus Christ is what we're
[1:19:10] talking about and you know what all
[1:19:12] people are welcome here there's nobody
[1:19:14] that's excluded from here we haven't
[1:19:16] excluded anybody
[1:19:18] the only people that don't come here are
[1:19:20] the ones that don't want to for whatever
[1:19:22] their reason and that's their reason
[1:19:23] that's fine
[1:19:25] but you know what everyone is welcome
[1:19:27] here
[1:19:28] this this business of it being us for
[1:19:31] and no more that's that's not here
[1:19:34] that's not here this is an occult to say
[1:19:36] that unless you wear a skirt you're not
[1:19:39] welcome here or or if you're a man and
[1:19:42] you come here wearing shorts you'll be
[1:19:43] turned away at the door you know what
[1:19:45] you need to become come in and get
[1:19:47] Washed by the Water of the word
[1:19:49] when Jesus came he didn't come to the
[1:19:52] most religious people wearing all the
[1:19:53] clergy clothes and and all of the the
[1:19:56] Royal apparel he came to the Sinners and
[1:19:59] the publicans the people that were hated
[1:20:01] of the day
[1:20:02] we need to make sure that we have that
[1:20:04] attitude brothers and sisters we could
[1:20:06] have some maybe call it greasy and grimy
[1:20:08] people come through the door but they're
[1:20:10] the ones that need this gospel they're
[1:20:12] the ones that need to be washed
[1:20:14] I was once
[1:20:16] were you
[1:20:18] people here are welcome
[1:20:21] that us for a no more mentality if
[1:20:24] somebody comes to the door and they're
[1:20:25] they're they're not wearing a skirt
[1:20:27] deacons I just want to say this in front
[1:20:29] of everyone let them in
[1:20:31] I don't want to hear that someone gets
[1:20:33] turned away from that maybe if someone
[1:20:34] is drunk and unruly you know brother
[1:20:36] Bradham talks about it in this message
[1:20:37] if that's the case then we need to do
[1:20:39] something about it but you know what
[1:20:41] people need to come in they need to be
[1:20:43] welcomed here
[1:20:45] anything that would act differently than
[1:20:47] that brothers and sisters I'll say this
[1:20:49] from the pulpit it's an antichrist
[1:20:51] spirit
[1:20:52] remember the disciples
[1:20:55] they were commissioned to go out and
[1:20:57] heal the sick raise the Dead cast out
[1:20:59] devils
[1:21:01] but there was one that just couldn't
[1:21:02] they just couldn't deal with but it's
[1:21:04] because they weren't converted brothers
[1:21:06] and sisters we're converted
[1:21:09] we don't have to tolerate Satan
[1:21:12] we can Thunder out that life
[1:21:15] today we have the entire person of Jesus
[1:21:17] Christ the fullness of the word the
[1:21:19] ability to speak the word
[1:21:24] I'm just wrapping up here
[1:21:27] it's kind of exciting to see that we've
[1:21:28] made it through this here it's the
[1:21:30] ability to speak the word brothers and
[1:21:32] sisters and understand that as he would
[1:21:34] speak the word not as we would speak the
[1:21:36] word
[1:21:37] not as we
[1:21:38] carnally think about the word and want
[1:21:40] to present the word sometimes many times
[1:21:43] in our lives it's not like that it's
[1:21:45] understanding that we don't need to take
[1:21:47] thought for what we'll say because that
[1:21:49] word that inner teacher that that Spirit
[1:21:51] of truth that will lead us into all
[1:21:53] truth he'll speak
[1:21:55] at the right time the right word
[1:21:58] not just most of the time
[1:22:00] but every single time every time in our
[1:22:03] lives
[1:22:06] to this age
[1:22:07] brothers and sisters
[1:22:10] have you heard it said before
[1:22:12] that you
[1:22:14] are all
[1:22:16] this world
[1:22:18] will ever see
[1:22:20] of Christ
[1:22:23] I said it that way and I'll say it again
[1:22:25] just because it's so incredibly powerful
[1:22:28] that you and I are all this world will
[1:22:32] ever see of Christ
[1:22:34] until Revelations 19.
[1:22:37] and you know the the verse 18 here in
[1:22:40] Malachi says then shall ye return and
[1:22:43] discern between the righteous and the
[1:22:44] wicked he's speaking
[1:22:46] of Revelations 19 when that bride comes
[1:22:48] back with him
[1:22:52] we are all that this world will see of
[1:22:54] Jesus Christ
[1:22:59] brother Branham says in 1951
[1:23:02] think about how early in his ministry
[1:23:04] he's talking this way the resurrection
[1:23:06] of Lazarus and if we become
[1:23:10] in spirit sons of God
[1:23:13] deity dwells
[1:23:16] in the man
[1:23:19] Hallelujah
[1:23:21] then you talk about blind eyes being
[1:23:23] open
[1:23:26] they said nothing impossible to God
[1:23:30] said nothing impossible with you
[1:23:33] if you'll believe
[1:23:36] not with God
[1:23:37] but with you
[1:23:39] this is what brother Bradham is saying
[1:23:41] this is a direct quote of his deities in
[1:23:44] man
[1:23:45] the fairy God God that stood back there
[1:23:48] on the mythical platform of the
[1:23:51] eternities and rolled worlds off his
[1:23:54] hands and created these things give you
[1:23:57] the privilege to be his son and you're a
[1:24:00] part of him
[1:24:02] and God dwells in mankind and man
[1:24:05] himself
[1:24:06] is deity
[1:24:09] so where's Jesus Christ today brothers
[1:24:11] and sisters
[1:24:13] what happened in 1963 why is there such
[1:24:16] a conflict around the cloud
[1:24:18] why is there so much controversy around
[1:24:21] all the seals being opened and and some
[1:24:23] of them not being open and so on and so
[1:24:25] forth why is there so much controversy
[1:24:28] about that these people that come in and
[1:24:30] around the message and they just don't
[1:24:31] have the ears to hear or the eyes to see
[1:24:34] this is what the prophet was saying in
[1:24:35] 1951.
[1:24:37] and God dwells in mankind and man
[1:24:40] himself is deity Hallelujah there you
[1:24:45] are he says it might choke you but study
[1:24:48] it over that a little while see he is
[1:24:51] God dwells in man and man becomes the
[1:24:54] Son of God not him and himself but the
[1:24:57] Holy Spirit that's in him
[1:24:59] is God
[1:25:01] the Creator lives in the creation oh my
[1:25:05] how I think of that then stand with an
[1:25:07] unwavering faith
[1:25:10] and ask what you will it'll be done unto
[1:25:13] you
[1:25:13] there he is God there he is
[1:25:17] imagine that brothers and sisters then
[1:25:20] stand there with an unwavering Faith
[1:25:22] just like Abraham
[1:25:24] you know
[1:25:26] I just love how the word says it that
[1:25:28] he's staggered not at the promise of God
[1:25:30] through unbelief but was strong
[1:25:34] he was of good courage
[1:25:36] he was strong in the faith that God had
[1:25:38] given him
[1:25:39] I heard a brother say it recently and I
[1:25:41] thought it was so amazing you know when
[1:25:43] David was anointed
[1:25:45] by Samuel
[1:25:47] to be king over Israel
[1:25:50] he knew he caught a revelation that he
[1:25:52] was anointed to be king
[1:25:55] and Imagine This
[1:25:58] when he went out to see his brothers who
[1:26:01] are on the front lines of the army and
[1:26:03] that giant Philistine was down there
[1:26:05] Beacon off
[1:26:07] at the army of the Living God on on on
[1:26:10] the Holy Ground on on Israel's Promised
[1:26:15] Land here's this giant down there acting
[1:26:18] out acting the way he was and David said
[1:26:21] you know what I can't believe that you
[1:26:23] guys are allowing this to happen step
[1:26:25] aside and let me go down there I'll go
[1:26:27] deal with him
[1:26:28] or this brother say it and and I don't
[1:26:31] know if brother Bradham says it and you
[1:26:32] know forgive me for even saying it but I
[1:26:34] believe it because this is a message
[1:26:35] brother believer a preacher he said that
[1:26:38] you know when David went out there he
[1:26:40] had such Revelation about what was going
[1:26:42] to happen that if if Goliath killed him
[1:26:45] if he died God would have been obligated
[1:26:48] to raise him up instantly
[1:26:50] because he wasn't anointed to go and
[1:26:52] kill a giant he was anointed to be king
[1:26:55] and he wasn't yet King
[1:26:58] what a thought
[1:26:59] brothers and sisters until your time is
[1:27:01] done you have been anointed to be a son
[1:27:04] and daughter of God and there's no devil
[1:27:06] that can stand in your way until you
[1:27:08] fulfill the purpose that God has called
[1:27:10] you for
[1:27:11] it just brought such encouragement to me
[1:27:14] to think about that until God is done
[1:27:16] with me on this Earth whether I go to
[1:27:18] the Grave or whether I go to the sky it
[1:27:20] doesn't matter
[1:27:21] I've been ordained to do something for
[1:27:23] him
[1:27:24] but then stand with an unwavering faith
[1:27:27] and ask what you will it'll be done unto
[1:27:29] you there he is God there he is
[1:27:33] my goodness
[1:27:35] there he stands oh isn't he wonderful
[1:27:39] I got one more quote
[1:27:41] and we'll close it tonight
[1:27:43] there he stands and I guess I'm I'm
[1:27:45] throwing these in because it's beyond
[1:27:47] Church order now now we're talking about
[1:27:49] why we have church order why we try and
[1:27:51] do things the way we do according to the
[1:27:53] prophet of our day and so that we can
[1:27:54] see that Apostolic blessing and
[1:27:56] understand the authority by which we
[1:27:58] stand there's people out there now that
[1:28:00] are preaching this Authority but they're
[1:28:03] not receiving the message of the hour
[1:28:04] and you know what's going to happen to
[1:28:06] those people they're going to be the
[1:28:08] five foolish virgin they're still virgin
[1:28:11] they're still for God but they're just
[1:28:13] not totally getting the whole picture
[1:28:15] and probably it's not because of
[1:28:18] something that they've done they just
[1:28:19] haven't been given ears to hear
[1:28:21] but there's people preaching Authority
[1:28:23] this level of authority out there the
[1:28:25] brothers and sisters when you can
[1:28:26] understand it that that it's actually
[1:28:29] Christ Living out through you it's not
[1:28:31] just an authority that Christ gave you
[1:28:33] and you can just grab on to it like
[1:28:35] something that you get from him and then
[1:28:37] just go and wave it around and get the
[1:28:39] excitement going and and push back the
[1:28:41] devils and have conquering Powers it's
[1:28:43] not about that at all it's not waving a
[1:28:45] little wand it's speaking the word it's
[1:28:48] it's Christ Living in US speaking the
[1:28:51] word forward knowing that there is a
[1:28:53] full authority of that one that rolled
[1:28:55] the worlds off his hands from the
[1:28:57] eternities is now living in US
[1:29:00] my
[1:29:02] out of Patmos Vision now man I was going
[1:29:05] to choke it but I'm going to say it I
[1:29:08] love this man is omnipotent
[1:29:12] you don't believe that but he is
[1:29:15] you could look up that that quote right
[1:29:17] there you don't believe it but he is or
[1:29:19] just simply man is omnipotent you don't
[1:29:21] believe that but he is a man fully
[1:29:24] surrendered to God is omnipotent
[1:29:27] did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever
[1:29:30] things you say and don't doubt in your
[1:29:33] heart it'll come to pass you can have
[1:29:35] what you said
[1:29:37] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:29:39] he says
[1:29:41] I'll call the musicians as we as we
[1:29:43] finish off here
[1:29:44] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:29:48] when God and man comes together
[1:29:51] two omnipotents some things got to shake
[1:29:57] imagine that brothers and sisters
[1:29:59] when that happens that causes that sweet
[1:30:02] life
[1:30:03] it just does
[1:30:04] we just can't live a different life and
[1:30:07] even if we get upset with someone we
[1:30:09] might go and talk to them and say you
[1:30:10] know my brother forgive me for for maybe
[1:30:13] saying this or asking this and I and I
[1:30:15] don't want to upset you but I just have
[1:30:17] this or that or whatever and and it's
[1:30:19] not coming Gruff we don't go and attack
[1:30:21] each other but it's that Spirit we're
[1:30:23] talking about that life living out
[1:30:24] through us what happens when the two
[1:30:26] omnipotents meet when God and man comes
[1:30:29] together two omnipotents something's got
[1:30:31] to shake and you know what's going to
[1:30:33] shake brothers and sisters it's going to
[1:30:34] be the devil
[1:30:35] because it's that life that lives out
[1:30:37] through us that sweet Pure undefiled
[1:30:40] Life our words they're kind one to
[1:30:43] another they're encouraging they're
[1:30:44] exhorting one another even more so as we
[1:30:46] see that day approaching we're not
[1:30:48] slaying each other we're slaying Giants
[1:30:51] by the life we're living that life is
[1:30:53] thundering out and hurting the Devils
[1:30:55] around us getting the devil so he
[1:30:57] doesn't even know what to do with us
[1:30:58] pushing us so far back in behind the
[1:31:00] hedge of God in behind that hedge that
[1:31:03] job lived in Bush of us so far back in
[1:31:05] there that the devil can't even find us
[1:31:07] because of that life we live
[1:31:10] he goes on to say some whatsoever you'd
[1:31:13] say with that creative power
[1:31:16] of omnipotence of God knowing that he's
[1:31:18] promised it
[1:31:20] and he said
[1:31:22] it in his word
[1:31:25] it creates a power
[1:31:27] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:31:30] to pass
[1:31:32] things that is not
[1:31:34] it makes them as though they are
[1:31:38] because two omnipotents have met
[1:31:41] when he truly comes into a son and
[1:31:44] daughter of God it's no longer just us
[1:31:46] speaking
[1:31:48] and I believe that really the the true
[1:31:50] test for us as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:31:52] is being able to surrender our will so
[1:31:54] that our voice isn't the one that's
[1:31:57] speaking it's so that it's the Lord
[1:31:58] Jesus speaking before our carnal nature
[1:32:01] can get out before that old nature that
[1:32:04] is always just constantly behind us
[1:32:07] haunting us
[1:32:08] for all of our days
[1:32:11] before that nature can speak
[1:32:14] we surrender our will and and and say be
[1:32:16] it unto me according to thy will Lord
[1:32:18] and and and just speak through me and
[1:32:21] when that happens
[1:32:22] I I truly believe it and I hope that
[1:32:25] somehow these words will encourage every
[1:32:26] one of us to know that we're going to be
[1:32:28] pushing Devils Back not because we're
[1:32:31] interested in trying to go to war and
[1:32:33] and and do something fancy or fun that's
[1:32:35] not what we're talking about we're
[1:32:37] talking about living up to our potential
[1:32:39] living up to our privilege not being
[1:32:41] slapped around by Devils but by just
[1:32:43] going forward with full confidence
[1:32:44] knowing that we are
[1:32:46] omnipotent that's what the prophet said
[1:32:49] we are omnipotent his voice in US
[1:32:53] means that we are omnipotent means that
[1:32:55] there's nothing that can't be done
[1:32:56] anything that we say will be done
[1:32:59] that's what his word said
[1:33:01] don't doubt in your heart speak it and
[1:33:03] don't doubt it in your heart and it
[1:33:04] shall be done
[1:33:07] our purpose here brothers and sisters
[1:33:08] stand with me tonight
[1:33:10] this church here in Calgary Calgary
[1:33:12] Living Word is dedicated to exalting the
[1:33:15] Lord Jesus Christ on Earth here again
[1:33:16] today
[1:33:18] one day I know every one of us will go
[1:33:21] and give an account for the parts that
[1:33:22] we play and I just want to say it with
[1:33:24] my voice today this church here is
[1:33:27] dedicated to exalting the Lord Jesus
[1:33:29] Christ to the absolute highest level
[1:33:31] that we can do it brothers and sisters
[1:33:33] that's why we gather here that's why we
[1:33:35] have Calgary Living Word it's to exalt
[1:33:38] Jesus Christ by hearing what the spirit
[1:33:41] saith unto the church and how do we hear
[1:33:43] that Spirit by listening to what the
[1:33:45] prophet had to say
[1:33:47] every single age that had a prophet the
[1:33:50] people that listened to the prophet they
[1:33:52] lived
[1:33:53] the people that didn't listen to The
[1:33:55] Prophet they perished
[1:33:57] and that's the way God's program works
[1:34:01] we exalt Jesus Christ by listening to
[1:34:03] what the prophet said it gives us the
[1:34:05] ability to set the church in order to
[1:34:07] have proper functioning Church order so
[1:34:10] that we can see the Lord prosper in our
[1:34:12] services prosper in our lives
[1:34:15] that's why we've gone through this these
[1:34:17] many services I trust that somehow some
[1:34:19] way it's been a blessing and that we
[1:34:21] could potentially see not not something
[1:34:24] change because something's broken but
[1:34:26] just see growth spiritually speaking
[1:34:29] that's all we're trying to do is
[1:34:30] encourage that
[1:34:35] we strive to see the fullness of Christ
[1:34:37] in our lives
[1:34:39] and we strive to preach the word
[1:34:42] the fullness of the word for our day
[1:34:44] that's the purpose of us being here in
[1:34:46] this church brothers and sisters is to
[1:34:48] hear the fullness of the word for our
[1:34:51] day
[1:34:51] you know it's Colossians
[1:34:54] one it's it's first Colossians
[1:34:58] 27 Christ in you the hope of glory to
[1:35:01] whom God
[1:35:02] would make known what is the riches of
[1:35:04] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:35:06] Gentiles
[1:35:08] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:35:11] that's the reason we gather here
[1:35:13] we want to see that that mystery
[1:35:17] revealed in in you

[1:35:53] we are omnipotent which means that we
[1:35:55] are creators and everywhere we go in our
[1:35:58] lives we are continually creating with
[1:36:00] the words that we speak and the behavior
[1:36:02] that we display and Lord Jesus tonight I
