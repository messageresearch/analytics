in the Bible who had backed his name was Samson and he came as at all the times not realizing that the strength and the power had left but whenever we come to God knowing that we're entirely insufficient then he can do the work himself we happy to be in church this morning amen just want to bring greetings from our pastor texted me yesterday wanted um me to pass on his greetings let's

hearers of the word Lord Jesus will be regenerated once again Lord by this lifegiving word that you bringing to us this morning at the end of the service may we be careful to give you all the thanks and praise for in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians God bless you if you could please turn in your Bibles with me to Genesis chapter 2 I have three portions of scripture to read we'll start with the first one and I will have you take your seats while I read the other two um portions of scripture Genesis chapter 2 from Verse 18 Genesis 2 Verse 18 we all know Genesis the 1 book of the Bible very easy to find if you hear there say Amen all right I'll read and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help made for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the earth and brought them unto Adam to see what he will call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the earth and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his reaps and clothes of the flesh instead thereof and the reap which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now the bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man he then says therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife life and they shall be one flesh you may have your seat I'll flip over to Mark chapter 10 I'll read from verse 1 to9 a lot of reading this morning we trust in the Lord will be our help just want to make sure that we set the context from the scriptures because we have nothing else to bring other than what has been given to us and he arose from then and cometh into the coast of Judea by the father side of Jordan and the people Resort unto him again and as he was once he taught them again and the Pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him and he answered and said unto them what did Moses command you and they said Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement to put her away and Jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female now this where I'm taking my title from this morning for this cause so my title is for this cause for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and their twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God had joined together let not man put aund last scripture reading Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians 5 all very common scriptures you probably can guess where I'm going this morning from verse 22 it says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man yet ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause again we are seeing that phrase again you notice the first time we saw um something close to that phrase was in genes is to use the word therefore but they are all very similar meanings right and when Jesus was also going to answer the question he also took them back to where the beginning right and now we see Paul comparing what we see on Earth with what we see in heaven I won't go ahead of myself sometimes I like to go ahead of myself you know why sometimes people fall asleep so I can give it before they fall asleep but hopefully no one will fall asleep this morning I know we had less an hour of sleep um but we are trusting the Lord for strength right for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular still love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she Reverend her husband so I said this morning the Lord had blessings to the Ring of his word my title is for this cause and if you look at that phrase for this cause if we look at the strong lexicon it says it's the same as for the sake of because of or on account of and when you look at this it's telling us that when those words are used it's pointing us to the reason for which something has been said many times when we talk about marriage which was instituted by God which was authored by God we don't often consider the reason why God set marriage in place we don't consider the why but AB brah preached many messages that started with why there were few he preached that was just you know the word why he had some messages that he preached that started with why including why I am a holy ruler why I pray for the sick why are people so tossed about why is it that so many Christians find it hard find it so hard I like the word so hard because it didn't just say find it hard but they find it so hard to live the Christian Life why some people can't keep the victory why are we not a denomination why little Bethlehem why cist speak why I am against organized religion why he had to be Shepherds in all of this messages brother Braham was trying to answer a question of why something had to be the way it was now if you look at the word those the phrase that we used uh for this cause by title this morning it could also be said to have been derived from a primary proposition of purpose or result and I want to spend some time this morning to dwell on that word purpose because purpose is very very important purpose tells us the reason for something if you don't know the purpose of something you cannot effectively function in that place in that in that state or or whatever that thing is if you don't know the purpose why you come to church you can't get the full benefit of coming to church if you buy a garget and you don't know the purpose of it you cannot get the full benefit of that garget so it's important to know purpose now when we start to talk about purpose the corresponding Greek word that was used you know in the Bible um you know we we we have a scripture that we often quote for I know the thoughts that I think towards you said the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end that word that's been translated as thought in English actually is the same translation as the word purpose right are we are you with me this morning are you with me this morning let's say amen yeah so purpose is very important and it refers to a deliberate plan or purpose the word that was used which is prothesis and this conveys the idea of something that is set forth or displayed often in the context of God's Divine Purpose or plan so when God says for I know the thought I have towards you it could also be said for I know the purpose that I have towards you now in our regular World organizations spend so much money on purpose more than we know I work in what is called one of the four big firms consulting firms in the world the biggest of the of of them the four biggest ones and it would interest you to know how much money we spend for our firm and for other companies to help them to discover their purpose you will find words um books that you know have titles like purpose-driven life now in studies that they have done they realize that organizations that are Purpose Driven they have at least 10% more in Revenue and many times a three or four times more better in Employee Engagement and productivity they have better customer loyalty and reputation they are better at Innovation and long-term strategy and they are more resilient during crisis why because they understand purpose they understand the why they understand the reason now brother Braham told us that our existence is for a purpose in Victory Day He said and each one of us is burned for something we just wasn't put here for nothing he said that mountain never happened out there just to be that tree was not put there for a was put there for a purpose everything is for a purpose it's God to serve and we are here for a purpose and brother Ram talked about Dwight Moody who a w woman a wash woman um got inspired to rent a place and have an evangelist come preach and it was in this service that Dwight Moody was saved and brother Bram said that that woman that did that she would be rewarded for all the souls the millions of souls that Dwight Moody want to the Lord because she recognized her purpose she recognized that she was not just a wash woman she got inspired to do something and she went ahead and did it because God said are there for a purpose amen now God himself he had a purpose amen but something about purpose his purpose starts out as a mystery that's why we always say discover your purpose amen it's not on the surface it's not easy to find you've got to dig deep to find it brother Bram said said in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said now God had a purpose a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak unto the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever begun and how that it's unfolded itself right now to this present hour it was a mystery but not the prophet saying it has unfolded itself amen we are still going to come to marriage but I want to set the foundation right Hallelujah so that we understand the importance of knowing what the purpose is for this cause we didn't Institute marriage God instituted marriage but for what purpose amen is it to have children is it to have a companion is it to have someone that you know like the Bible said is better for two is better um two is better than one because when one is cold the other one keeps him warm right is is it we we could ask those questions but the answer is right in the pages of the scripture now brother BR was typing because you've got to understand that God's ways are always the same if God started out with a mystery a purpose brother Abraham called it a threefold purpose and God is revealing that purpose he's been revealing it from the start of time and still revealing it today then we understand that God works by the principle of purpose now many people you know we are we we are humans that study you know what God has done and based on that we able to create something that's similar think about the airplane the people that created the airplane started the bird how does the bird you know fly how does he Glide they took time to study it and they try to use the principle that is already existing in nature to create something that helps us to travel quicker and further right now brother Bram said God's great mystery of how it's a secret purpose STS out as a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angel didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under a seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence there was silence because why it was a mystery God kept it a secret right but we know that that secret has been revealed amen so what was this purpose that God had brother brah said it was a three-fold purpose he said the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people God filled all Earth and space we couldn't get a hold of him we couldn't see him and the very first thing God will do was to condescend and if you think about the word condescend it means to come to a lower level the god that could not be contained in every anything first formed himself out as a logos a word body but that was not enough because though the logos appeared in many ways to some people in the Old Testament it was not permanent permanently with them that they could have interactions with him that they could learn from him the logos came in a body melis sedc appeared unto Abraham the logos took a body went and was the fourth man on the fire for the three Hebrew children but God had a purpose in mind he wanted to reveal himself to us he wanted us to be able to experience him not just as God that is super but as a human being and then the Fulfillment of that very first purpose of God to reveal himself to the people was the coming of Jesus Christ but brother BR told us it was a threefold purpose he said the second purpose which is more relevant to us is to have the preeminence in this body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people amen now God has fulfill the first fold of that purpose Jesus Christ came on Earth he did what he was meant to do now the second fold of the purpose is he wants to live in me and you not just live in us but live out our lives by himself not us living our lives but he wanted to live out our life right he wanted a bride that he might leave in the people now the third purpose is fold of that purpose is is futuristic he said is to restore the kingdom to his rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with a people and talked with them and fellowship with them we know that is coming we know there will be a millennium Reign on this Earth where we will live with God where we will talk with him where we would we won't have anything you know um of this worldall that that's that's that that bothers us we have everything in Perfection now when you understand purpose it pours you into action that's the thing about purpose it's not just an information when you understand purpose it poures you into action now we can look at a few characters in The Bible one of them was Moses we know the story of Moses Moses was born as a deliverer at a time when the children of Israel were in Egypt God had already told Abraham a time will come your seed will be strangers in a foreign land and they're going to be there for 400 years and after 400 years I'm going to bring them out andram told us that story teaching on Moses as he like really dramatized it my kids we'll call that one of the best sermons for kids to listen to because it was really really good uh uh brother brah did a good job of dramatizing but he told us that amram and J the parents of Moses they had been praying to God for a deliverer just like the rest of Israel now when they prayed to God for deliverance God had a set time for that deliverer to come and then at that set time God told Abraham I am going to bring the deliverer through your family now when God brought that deliverer it was at the time when the king of Egypt also said that all the Jewish babies should be killed but God gave them wisdom to hide those baby and eventually they had to let the baby go and in letting the baby go are you with me this morning I see a few people sleeping let's let's let's praise the Lord let's let's clap let's let's give a a huge Shout to the Lord this morning praise the Lord hallah we're in church we only here for a few hours don't worry I won't keep you late it's only 10:00 we started so early today don't worry I have my watch here so I would look at the one other the back but we found Moses becoming the son of Pharaoh's daughter now here's where I'm going when the mother of Moses the first one we know started to carer for her son and got paid for it she used that opportunity to reveal the purpose of Moses life to him Fifth Gospel she told Moses you are not an Egyptian you are born a deliverer amen and although Moses could not understand how how God was going to bring that to pass in his life that purpose was pushing him he pushed him to a point when he was 40 years old Moses was out and he saw an Egyptian and an Israelite fighting and because of the purpose in him the Revelation that he was born to be a deliverer it did not wait for God's time we know that was wrong but it spot him into action I'm here to deliver those people that's the power of purpose Samson the Bible told us when the angel appeared to his parents they told him that this son that will be conceived in you will be the deliverer he going to deliver Israel from the Philistines right and I don't want to go into all the the details of Samson's life but here's where I want to go to Samson understood the purpose for his life and at the final moment of his life where it looked as if that purpose would not be fulfilled remember he was born to destroy the Philistines and when he looked as if that purpose will not be fulfilled Samson came to himself and prayed to God and said please let me Avenge the Philistines of my two eyes and the Bible told us that those that he killed that day were more than all that he killed in all of his life there's a woman in the Bible called Esther she was a slave girl that had been brought to the land of the Chans and whilst she was there for some reason that we don't know the queen that was on the seat at the time disobeyed the king and the King was looking for another queen now when Esther went into the palace Esther did not have a full idea of the purpose why God placed that in the palace how do I know that when hamus planned to destroy the Jews and Mori heard about it and Mori sent Messengers to Esther and said Esther this is what what what aamas is planning hman sorry not hammers I I was wondering why it looked so recent I don't I don't know if they are from the same family but it was a hman and you know Esther was given that information hman has plans to destroy the Jews she was fearful At first she gave excuses I can't go into the king unless I'm called it's not time to go but let's listen to what morai said to her I call this one of the greatest messages it was just a couple verses of scripture am but I was great enough to make her understand that you are here for a purpose Moni told Esther after all th excuses for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou has come to the kingdom for such a time as this when Esther heard that she understood that purpose amen she wasn't there to show how pretty the King was I know I've preached on the beauty of Jesus Christ using King aerus as a type of Christ and Esther as a type of the bride and Esther being the one in whose body you could see the beauty of the king but our purpose was more than that her purpose was to be a deliverer and sisters you might think you are the weaker vessel but you don't know the extent to which the Lord can use you if only you surrender to him amen when Esther heard those words then Esther B them return Modi this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shan and fast you for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will Fast likewise and so I will go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish when you discover your purpose you will realize that your purpose is greater than your life the Saints of old we just sang the song ancient words that verse said holy words long preserved to our walk in this world came to us through sacrifice is it sacrifice of bulls and Rams no it was sacrifice of the blood of men and women but they understood the purpose they were here they knew that they were here to stand for God and they counted their lives nothing before them they were willing to give their lives for the cause of the Gospel our Lord Jesus Christ also knew his purpose Amen in John N he told us you know he had healed a blind man that was blind from his birth and his disciples had come to him he had not healed him he had seen the blind man and the disciples had come to him to say this guy that is blind why was he blind who sinned was he his parents on he or him knowing that sin you know sickness could be as a result of sin and Jesus answered and said to them now neither have the man seen nor experienced but that the works of God should be made manifest in him now Jesus said this precious words I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day now Jesus was not just telling us the importance of purpose but he was making us understand that purpose is time bound if you don't carry out your purpose at the time that's been allotted for that purpose you can miss out on fulfilling that purpose now we have a promise brother Braham said that anything that fulfills the purpose of God will be in the resurrection are you understanding how important purpose is Jesus Christ said while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world Amen now John told us in first John 38 said he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinned from the beginning he now told us the purpose of the son of man for this purpose the son of man was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now we don't have the son of man here in flesh any anymore but in whose flesh is the son of man who only mine is it just me only 20% raised their hands let's see how many more how many more okay all of us yeah so we also have a purpose and that purpose is to destroy the works of the devil in our lives in the lives of others now as a minister of the Gospel by the grace of God I also ask myself what's the purpose of the gift that God has placed in my life and in my search and I'm saying this you know in not honesty trusting that the Lord will continue to fulfill that and maybe continue to make it happen that way but I believe that God wants me to bring his Believers to the knowledge of the truth because there's a reason why he placed the fivefold my purpose might be different from an evangelist's purpose an evangelist might come here raise your faith everyone is jumping and shouting that is what God called them to do but when I come I want to be sure that the spirit of God can help me as brother br said he was talking about those that have a Teaching Ministry he said they will take these things that I'm teaching you I'm telling you preaching to you and show you where they are in the Bible Paul told Timothy he said for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth so it's something that I will want us to all do in all the callings of Our Lives In Everything we are called to do when you at work at home as a son as a daughter as a father as a mother what is the purpose for this now let's go to the topic for today when those Pharisees came and tempted Jesus Jesus took them back to the beginning right amen amen Jesus took them back to the beginning why brother Braham said that Genesis is the SE chapter of the Bible how important is a seed very important right can you get crops without seeds no if the seed has not no life in it are you going to get crops no so what Jesus was showing us is if you go back to Genesis you will see the why for everything but remember it's there and hidden now what happened in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth God made animals from the dust we know he told the animals to come from the earth and he made them male and female and God blessed it was at that time that after God made man the spirit man God blessed and said be fruitful and multiply so way before Eve was formed God has already talked about procreation before marriage happened is someone getting something this morning I know some people are not married yet but you can keep this in the back pocket because if you know the purpose for it you will go into it the right way not just that you will have the right expect the greatest thing that causes divorces today is people go into marriage with a wrong expectation because if you go with the right expectation if you know the purpose for it then it will be easier for you to wither the storms because it's also designed as we going to see I'm going ahead of myself if you're sleeping I'm going going ahead of [Laughter] myself because it's designed to be Rocky why is it designed to be Rocky because as we are going to see for this cause which cause Paul started to tell us that the actual purpose of marriage is so that marriage on Earth can reflect Christ and the church when you got saved that was the relationship with Christ and the church before you got saved with you and Christ what was the relationship were you always obeying him were you do were you doing things that pleased him no so I'm going ahead myself but we'll get there so God made Man In His Image the Bible said male and female created he them so the spirit man that God made had the masculine and The Feminine and then we realize that God then formed Man Out of the Dust of the Earth in Genesis chapter 2 and he put that Spirit which had the masculine and The Feminine in this flesh body that he formed which he called Adam now where we read in Genesis Genesis what Genesis 2 yeah Genesis 2 it said it is not good for man to be alone and then he formed the woman brother brah told us that God then took out the feminine spirit and plac it in the woman now immediately God did that it became a law of contrast the way I like to describe cribe this is if you have a gadget that uses two batteries One battery the positive will face the north the negative will face the South the other battery you will make sure that the negative is facing the North and the positive is facing the South so they are in opposite direction but without the two of them being in that state you can't have power now brother Bram told us that God made the woman he took the Bible told us took out the reap made the woman brother Braham said he took the feminine Spirit put in the woman brah also made us to know that you marry who you are why because that feminine Spirit used to be in you I don't know when so don't ask me but he used to be in you now you realize that you're attracted to people that have similar values as you it's just natural but the reason is that way is that feminine Spirit used to be in the man now brother Ram said in hear ye him he said God here was going to do something that he will ask man to do and God will never ask you to do anything that he would not do himself did you ever think of that did you ever go back to the Garden of Eden in the great coming forth of Adam and Eve the Bible said that Adam was not deceived Adam was not deceived he knowed just exactly what he was doing but because of the love that he had for Eve he walked right into death with her not because he add two he know difference Paul told us Adam was not deceived it was the woman that was deceived she was the one in the transgression and brother Ram is saying the same thing here Eve was absolutely deceived she thought she was right but Adam knowed better but he walked out with her and took death with her so we start to see that the very first thing that was displayed in marriage was Redemption now brother brah said in adoption number two he said now but he wanted to put things in time he had to make something to wash ship so his attributes produced this then he made man he's talking about God then in this man he looked lome so now to show now his great mind what he had in picture of Christ and the church now he told us that God had a threefold purpose which was a mystery now as God started to reveal that purpose we talked about the first one he wanted to come down and be able to be uh be in person with man which he did that in Jesus Christ the second one he wants to have the preeminence and in having the preeminence he wants to start to display his attributes in human beings one of those attributes was he had a bride that he loved when she was yet in sin the Bible said whilst we are yet sinners God loved us so the first display of that was Adam Adam loved his wife when she was yet in sin she had committed adultery according to the law she was to be put away we know that was before the law but he still the same God that gave the law but to show us Redemption from the very beginning we saw him brother BR said he went into death to get his wife back and is telling us that God had a picture of Christ and the church in his great mind he took not a different piece of clay and made a woman but he took from the side of Adam a reib and took from the spirit of Adam the feminis and put it in this reap but Rah told us they are two different spirits altoe but together they make one unit just like the example I get of the battery now but around to explain to us the difference in the spirit of man and the spirit of woman and this where brother Braham went and talked about women that want to be like men men that would want to be like women and said he ought not to be he said he made the Burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminist Spirit from for the woman in time tested Memorials of God he said he separated them in flesh and made them difference but joined them together and raising their children as one now this is where the problem is because we are different it brings tension everybody awake this is important now don't worry you're going to enjoy it it's going to be fun so let's look at the differences between how men and women think so this is not scripture but this is science this is studies right and I'll take the Liberty because brother br will also bring things from nature to type the spiritual when it comes to problem solving men are very solution oriented right they focus on facts logic and direct problem solving they look for a practical and efficient way to fix an issue if Brothers you know that if your wife comes and says I'm very overwhelmed it's been a busy day um your mind you're like yeah draw out a plan right plan your day and it should be easy right but women are more process oriented so they take a more holistic approach they will think about emotions relationships long-term consequences before making decisions so when my wife starts to tell me things about what's going on at work most of the time she's not asking me for feedback she just wants a listening here and someone to agree with her whether she's right or wrong right because God made us different when it comes to communication and expression men are more compartmental in the way they think and their thoughts are often more lineal so you know you tell a man to go do something that is what is in his head he's not able to juggle too many things together and brother Braham gave us his story and I want to say as well that I'm grateful to God that brother Braham told the stories that he told and don't let take them as just stories just like the Bible there are many stories in the Bible that you wonder why why were they put there right I I I wondered as a young child the story of the old prophet and the young Prophet right a prophet was told to do something don't go this way when you're coming right and then the old Prophet met him and said God told me to tell you why Weise he was deceiving him and the the young Prophet lost his life for that eaten up by a lion but those stories are there for us to learn from so brother Bram brought his life he he he told so many stories that were personal stories but there's a lot to learn from it so brother brah was telling us this story you have this in here we have no continuing City 1950 I like to read it so it was talking about sister hope his first wife right um about the time she was passing away and she said she was saying to brother BR don't let my babies be pulled about from Pillar To Post she said and some things I got to confess to you so brother BR said what is it he said do you remember one time and said you were going fishing and I called you and that night we were going to Fort way for a meeting I said yes she said you went to get me some stalkings I said yes I remember them she said them was the wrong kind of stalkings honey them wasn't right so what had happened is sister hope I told Brother Braham to go get her some women's socks and she had told Brother Bram the name Shor and brother Bram because men think lineal it's just straight we can't have too many things in our head brother Ram started repeating that to himself as he was going so he will not forget and he got to a point where he met someone on the road and they got into a conversation so he totally forgot what he was sent to buy and because you know it was Jess penes he was supposed to buy it from because he had forgotten he said well I can't go there I have to go somewhere where I can ask someone so he went to another store where he had a friend that was working and he got there and said oh that you know hope asked me to buy this H some stockings and the lady said no hope doesn't wear stockings I said no she does she actually do and said okay what are the types that you have and he said we have the chiffon and we have the rayon and said oh it's the rayon so let's give me that one well it was for old women that one and that's the one he bought but the lesson here is sister hope never scolded him for it right so short lesson for sisters we are not as smart as you are many times we actually act as if we are but we can't multitask like women can and I struggled with this I used to think I can multitask but when it comes to how we think we cannot multitask why are we talking about this differences because these differences are the things that causes conflict and tensions but I want you to know that it is in God's design amen for it to be like that because when we look at Christ and the church and we're going to get to what the role of Christ is and what the role of the church is and also type that the role of the husband and the role of the wife right let's at a few other examples emotional processing men like to compacte compact mentalize their emotions and just want to be sure I'm not yeah yeah and um so I mean they are IDE the we we are very very high level the way men think right we are more relying on logic as we make decisions well women are more integrated into having their thinking and emotions together right so when it comes to decision making women have a lot of emotions in their decision making so someone once talked about the nothing box how many brothers have asked their wife what's wrong with you and they get the answer nothing when a man when you ask a man is anything wrong with you and he says nothing most likely it's nothing but when a woman says nothing you better be wise right because of just how they are and I was hearing a preacher preacher and he was saying well he's not sure whether the sisters tell a lie or they're just expressing that it's nothing of your business or maybe it's nothing until you do something about it because you're supposed to go into our mind and figure what's going on and do something about it when it comes to risk taking and decision making men are very good at risk taking and we make very quick and impulsive decisions women want to spend time and think about it so when it comes to making decisions at home the man just goes yeah this is what we're going to do the woman is an the life in it taking our time and that's what happens when they go shopping as well I was reading somewhere brother Ram was talking about going shopping with sister MAA and how his legs were hurting and uh I felt well I'm not alone because to be honest I don't like going shopping with my wife cuz if I go shopping I get into the store I know where everything is I go get it and I come out but she goes and she's looking around and like we are not here to buy this but she's taking a look at it oh I just want to look at it why do you want to look at it we are not here for this right but that is how women think and if we understand that God made the feminist Spirit different from the masculine Spirit a lot of our problems will be solved how many brothers will say that their wives somewhat contribute to them coming late to church because they taking their time to get ready but it's not because they intentionally doing that sometimes I'll be honest I once felt like maybe my wife doesn't yet have the revelation of 30 minutes before service but that's not it because she's thinking more holistically she's emotions is there she's thinking about what food we we will have when we get back from church all L of those things are going on I'm not giving an excuse for sisters to make us come lat to church but I'm just saying that what is going on in our brain is different from what is going on in your brain cuz when you wake up you have things to do I get the car ready you know if you help with the kids which you should I'll do this and do this and do this and then you get it done faster than she does but she's thinking about many other things for the benefit of the family now God made us different I didn't hear the comment but it's okay God made us different so that the situation can be right for what Christ and the church should be so that the husband and the wife can be that now we have said that Adam was not deceived but he projected love why he projected love to redeem his bride now what I want you to get is he did not look at the state of his wife before he projected love which made it an unconditional love so what God requires of us as men is to love our wives unconditionally amen amen she listens to me I love her she doesn't listen to me I love her still because the purpose of marriage is to reflect Christ and the church and as I said before whilst we were yet sinners he loved us now brother BR said in Hebrews and we're going to see you know what he expects from the bride as well he said Grace is what God did for me works is what what I do for God said now they make a Doctrine out of it they think that the think that works that works is what wins your Merit if it is it isn't a free gift Grace is what God did for you by Grace you are saved and works is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed you and if you love him you like to do the works of the Lord so let me also say as you're going to see a few examples this morning the woman is called to serve a husband in appreciation of the man choosing her out of the many women that are in this world and that is also based on no conditions no conditions I'm going to challenge you all this morning with a few stories that brother bah told to make you know that your situation might not be the worst but there are people that have been in worse worse situations than you've been that decided to follow this principle and that turned around their marriage why because they went to the real purpose of marriage and Society focused on it but Ram continued to say here he said and if you love him you like to do the works of the Lord certainly because you love him he said accepting M the bro as my wife was what love done for her what she does in appreciation she's a nice woman stays home takes care of the children and leaves a good true life that's not because we are married we are married but she does that in appreciations if she runs downtown every day and took in every T store and up and down the street and never washed the dishes or anything else we are still married absolutely when I took my vow and we're going to visit that vow this morning when I took my vow that settles it she is my wife as long as there is life in us she's my wife that's her vow but what appreciation she does for that she stays home and takes care of the children and tries to be a real wife brother the Braham is saying I have no excuse not to love her because of what she does or what she fails to do I could run out and be gone all the time just guarding about over the country and let us have sta or anything let the children go without something to eat we are still married if she even divorces me I am still married long as there is life in my body I took that vow remember I said a lot of people go into marriage not knowing the purpose of marriage maybe not even meaning The Vow is why we have so many divorce cases till death we separate that's right we are still married but yet I make a poor excuse of a husband she would make a poor excuse as a wife so if we love one another we stick together and pull the load together amen said that's the way God and his church is for this cause what cause God and his church but Abraham said that is the antitype our marriages are the type which means we're going to give account one day for how well we try to mirror the antitype when you're born in the kingdom of God you'll have ups and downs true but you're still a Christian you still born of the spirit of God but brah gave us a few examples he told us something in when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place and brother Bram was narrating something that happened at home in his house he had had sister Meer she was 37 years old at that time and he said she was completely gray and he said she stood between me and the public and he said one day brother Braham had been praying for the sick not in church but those that came to his house said the entire basement of full was full of people you know the the living area was full of people he was praying for them and there were some Fanatics as well that continued to run around the building saying that God had told them to tell brother Braham something and brother Braham had done nothing about it and sister maida was taking care of the children but the whole house was in chaos so he said when he was done praying for the sick tired tired you can imagine what it is I haven't prayed for a lot of sick but out in the ministry I've had to do some prayers and depending on what demons you're dealing with you leave that place tired so imagine how tired brother Braham was brother Braham came back and he said he saw his wife she had her head in between her legs and she said the children hasn't had anything to it and I don't know what to do but the RAM said well I thought now there's just one thing to do now brother Braham had a choice he could have come back and said say don't you know how tired I am after praying for the sick and just to take care of this children you couldn't just do that for me but let's see what he did what he did said now there's just one thing to do now I am tired but I'm going to do this I was praying in his heart now heavenly father in my heart you help me to be what you would have me to be on this scene why why was he asking for God's help that is the model it's only Christ that can react to his bride when she was lost with love right but the Bon I thought now if I can just get her quiet so I said sweetheart will you rush out with me for dinner and she replied oh I'd have to clean up the children and this and that the BR said and you could hardly hear yourself think little Joseph just beating the floor as hard as he could Ram said so I sleeped over and got an apron a tired man sleept over got an apron put it around me and I begin to help her and I said honey you know what I saw the prettiest dress the other day I just wanted to get it for you and he was in a certain city just here closed and we'll go get it the ram said as he was doing that maybe helping with the dishes maybe helping to sweep the floor which we should all do as brothers maybe helping to cook which we should all do that is what Christ did for us and as husband that's what we should do for our wives said he was praying all the time Heavenly Father quieting this dear little woman and I put my hand on her not knowing her not knowing what I was doing doing he was praying in his heart she didn't know that what that's what he was doing I said yes honey what oh it was beautiful kept saying oh Lord quieten this little woman and just kept on you know her not knowing what was I doing was projecting creating a different atmosphere it's my duty to create the atmosphere in my home if the atmosphere is not right it's my responsibility I must own it and I must do something about it as you can tell this message is for me as well so he not a perfect brother Toby coming to pray to you I ask the Holy Spirit to speak to us I want to be spoken to as well so that my home can be different amen because there's a model that God has given to us and that is Christ and the bride but brah said walk in the love of God have Fellowship and in a few moments she got quiet and then when she got quiet Sarah and Becky divided up the play blocks Joseph got him something to play with and there was peace in the home amen why the Redeemer took his place the Redeemer stepped up and took his place and created a different atmosphere because he knew that that was his home home and then God giv his spirit and through that spirit with love to my family Sovereign Grace coming and quieten the family but Bram said he will do it I know it will now brother BR also told us in questions and answers he said this story a few times but in questions and answers number three someone had asked him a question and he was going to use the story of this Christian sister who had a drug card has a husband so the question that was asked brother Braham was this brother Braham how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her and yet stay with the word but still having a question like this said why don't you practice what you preach or believe so let me explain that are we still awake amen am we need something to wake us up let's shout hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord don't worry I'll be done soon and I'm in it I know brother kyri says that a lot but I promise you I'll be done amen very soon now this question that was asked brother Braham a brother wrote to brother Braham and said how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her while staying with the word and still getting a question from the wife wife that says why not Practice What You Preach so it gave a sense that this man's life was not lining up with the word that he was trying to teach at home or trying to show that he has a relationship with now this is Brother braham's answer he said well well then sorry Brothers I'm sorry I didn't give you the quot but if you can find it that'll be good if not that's okay said well then if the wife if the wife is saying this to you she has a right to say it you better get right but Braham said if you are not preaching what you believe you better get right then if she's saying it just to be evil remember the Bible said it was better than a millstone was hang on your neck and drawn on the depth of the sea then even to offend the least of this my little on so let's say the scenario the wife is not a Believer the husband is and the woman is just you know trying to say that to be evil like why don't you practice what you preach so but brah said that wouldn't be good because she's putting herself in danger but brah said 115 and maybe that this wife is not that type of person maybe she's a different maybe she's a good person maybe she's just testing you to see what you'll do said now stay in love with her and let her see Jesus in you amen you do that see you just go on I give a little illustration this morning about a person one time this little woman had received the Holy Ghost she was a very sweet little person well she had had a hard life and her husband was an alcoholic and so she kept on she bore with him she says you want to go to church honey take off but now he went down to the salon down at Old Brown Debby down here going on so they hung out there all the time used to be boners many of you oldtimers here remember when boners had there um on the corner of it's called Brown Derby now I believe it is so hanging around down there and the first thing you know one night come up a question about church and Christians so this man and his friends hanging out all drinking and one of the old drunks sitting there said there a't no such thing as a Christian anymore and there's no certain thing all this bunch of Hypocrites you see them out out here smoking drinking doing something that we do and said call themselves Christian there's no such this one drunk raised up and said just a minute there is one that I know they said who is it said it's my wife see she had become salty he was catching it all the time he said no she's a Christian I prove it to you said I tell you what Let's do let's go up home and I'll show you whether she's a Christian or not said let's go up home and now let's really be drunk we're going to act like we're really drunk knocked at the door coming staggering over everything and and why the chair sitting around this way and everything and and she set them all on a chair and and his guest you know and try to make them just as welcome as could be said I want to fix you up some supper she went to fix some and said we want ham and eggs you know they had it so they fixed the ham and eggs when he got there at the table he looked at them picked up a plate and slammed the stuff on the floor said you know I don't like my HS like this come on boys let's get out of here anyhow but abam said they went out and sat down like that you know she came out she said dear I'm sorry I didn't get them fixed I'll fix some more for you oh nonsense you know I didn't want them that way in the first place just carrying on like that they went out there and sat down and act like they was drunk they heard her in there kind of sobbing to herself singing really low voice must Jesus bear the cross alone all the world go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me this consecrated cross I'll bear Till Death Shall Set Me Free one Drunk Cat looked at the other one said she's a Christian she's got it and that little woman let her husband possess others to Christ that night see why just be real sweet just remember he knows all about it says so sister brother whoever it might be or brother it's here cuz he asked about his wife you just be salty she'll get thirsty if there's anything in her to thirst for if it isn't remember if you got the wrong person you'll get the right one in the Millennium you just keep ongoing all wrongs will be made right don't look at your wife and say I'm just going to bear with you on this Earth I'll get another one in the Millennium I want to believe that the one you have today is the one you will be with in the Millennium brother Braham said we will be Eternal mats in glory I'll call the musicians As We rise on our feet this morning for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and they too shall become one flesh that cause is not for what we often think it is for it is to mirror Christ and and the church as we have heard Christ love his church unconditionally and because of that love she serves him unconditionally I want to bring to our remembrance for those that are married what the marriage vows would have been this or a variation of it if you're standing close to your wife your husband you can hold hands if you want to some of us can't I don't want to bring my wife here brother Barry is not here sorry but I want us to reflect on those words that you might have said or responded to however so many years ago this this is what would have been read to the husband will you have this woman to be your lawful weeded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love and honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty and will forsake all others as long as you both leave and the man will have said I will and this would have been asked the woman will you have this man to be your lawful weed husband to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love honor and cherish and support in sickness or health Riches of poverty and cleave thee only unto him as long as you both leave and the bride will have answered I do just reflecting on this as we have our eyes closed we might have failed in some way to be exact to what we vowed before God to do but is a merciful god and I believe this morning he has pointed our attention to the very reason that he instituted marriage and if we can go back and just do what he expects us to do following the model that he has placed before us of himself and his church then he can make all wrongs right again just going to offer this word of prayer for all of us that are married and maybe for those that yet to be married as well as God is bringing this to our remembrance just to know what the right expectation will be going into marriage whenever that time is if Christ ties we're going to ask the Lord he him that loved his bride he's also the one that gave his bride the ability to serve him in appreciation of that love that God will help us to focus on what is the primary reason for marriage and we know that when we discover the purpose it pours us into action there father we thank you for this precious words that were long preserved for our walk in this world you knew that we couldn't walk alone so you made sure that the word was there for us to guide us as a samon said Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and the lamp onto my path we cannot walk alone there Lord and Lord we confess that sometimes we are failed as husbands not to love our wives unconditionally as wives not to serve our husbands unconditionally we found excuses we have behaved in ways we ought not to and we ask that you forgive us there Lord Lord you're looking at marriages especially of believers and wanting to see that reflection of Christ and the church and we know we'll answer one day if we have done according to the pattern if we have built according to the blueprint Lord we just pray that you be our help there father we know the devil is on a an attack spray Lord Jesus attack spray Lord Jesus trying to destroy marriages there father we ask that you protect our marriages there Lord that Lord our marriages knowing that they have been founded on the solid rock that father Lord when the storms will come we will go back to the foundation we will go back to the beginning as you answer those Pharisees and said but from the beginning this is how God made them Lord and this is the purpose for which God made them this way may we always go back there Lord Jesus may we receive the strength to love Lord Jesus even when it it appears Lord Jesus that our wives

put our hands together [Music] [Applause] amen I believe that those vows that were read are not just words we say in order to get a a spouse they are something that are set in the presence of God Amen it is binding now one thing I want to say and it may appear one-sided is that sister the church got a perfect husband you didn't but at least you know the standard to which your husband is held to he's been called to emulate the Lord Jesus Christ when you don't see it pray for him praise the name of the Lord you understand that his faithfulness is what the family is holding on if you if any if you have any doubt look at the relationship between Christ and his church right thank you so much brother Barry brother Toby keep saying brother Barry and there is a purpose for everything there's a purpose why you are here there is a purpose why God sent a message for you and I amen there is a purpose why it's not out there in front of everybody there's a purpose where you are the one who received it because you are the one he laughed even when we were all siners praise the name of the Lord so let's be conscious about this is and not let's not take it lightly it's a very important and I'm talking all this because this morning at Sunday school we're all talking about the the the the secred trust that God has given to the chur chur being his word hallelujah you know what it's time is up his faithfulness is keeping us let's sing faithful one as we close let's bow down our hearts before precious Lord and King our master and savior we love you we appreciate you so much amen once more
