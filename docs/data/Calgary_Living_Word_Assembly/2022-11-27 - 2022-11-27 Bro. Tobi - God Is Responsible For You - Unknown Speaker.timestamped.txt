[41:49] [Music]
[41:50] [Applause]
[42:17] um God bless you
[42:19] um before I sing the song I actually
[42:21] have a testimony
[42:23] um
[42:25] ever since we came here like the last
[42:27] time there was a youth I and we were
[42:29] announced that there was going to be a
[42:30] banquet I was really excited and I was
[42:34] wanting to come
[42:35] but
[42:37] um
[42:38] just last week a certain like a certain
[42:40] type of like discouragement came over me
[42:42] and I just felt like I wanted to fund
[42:44] every excuse not to come
[42:46] and like I would tell my friend at work
[42:48] I don't think I'm gonna be coming and
[42:49] then I all of a sudden I got a cold
[42:51] and then I got an excuse that you know
[42:54] what I have a cold I'm not gonna come I
[42:55] don't want to get anyone sick and
[42:57] everything else
[42:58] but um on Wednesday uh I was listening
[43:02] to a sermon
[43:03] and there's something that was said like
[43:06] that really like
[43:08] stuck out to me and then I read it to my
[43:10] friend at work and the testimony is that
[43:13] like in the line of what I I had read
[43:17] um brother Toby spoke about it yesterday
[43:20] um so he spoke about
[43:23] purified purified for service or
[43:26] purifying for service and where I was
[43:29] reading is um it's a message from
[43:31] Brother Branham where it the title of
[43:35] the message is if God be with us then
[43:38] where are the Miracles
[43:39] and on uh the 1616 paragraph it says
[43:44] take the cloud away then what happens
[43:47] the sun is right there the only thing on
[43:51] the only thing you have to do today
[43:54] see not oh Jesus come and heal me oh
[43:58] Jesus give me the Holy Ghost just take
[44:01] the cloud away he's already there he
[44:05] came he he come
[44:07] um
[44:08] 1900 years ago and he still there and
[44:12] he'll always be there I'm Alive
[44:16] forevermore the same yesterday to Dan
[44:18] forever and that goes in line with what
[44:21] brother Toby was saying about purifying
[44:23] yourself like most of the time we're
[44:24] asking ourselves do I have the Holy
[44:26] Spirit do I have this but there's a lot
[44:28] that we need to get rid of in order to
[44:31] even get to him because he already gave
[44:33] it in the like when he came and died for
[44:35] us there's a lot of things that he had
[44:37] already done for us
[44:38] and
[44:40] um I also wanted to thank Sister Lisa
[44:42] for the activity that she did because
[44:44] it's one of the reasons that I'm gonna
[44:47] be singing I was not gonna sing the song
[44:49] I was also discouraged to sing the song
[44:51] but um through the fellowship that we
[44:54] had I got to talk to a young sister and
[44:58] um it pushed me to want to sing this
[45:00] song even more
[45:02] so
[45:03] um bear with me I have a cold so
[45:10] I speak the name of Jesus over you

[56:15] all know that as we sing we welcome him
[56:20] I just want to thank everyone for your
[56:22] prayers
[56:23] I uh as most of you know I had a fall
[56:28] this week and you know the Lord was good
[56:31] I met with the doctor and it was strange
[56:36] I'll just explain what happened I I
[56:38] slipped and fell on Wednesday and I just
[56:41] felt bruised I didn't feel any issue and
[56:45] I just carried about my life
[56:47] but Thursday about supper time I was
[56:50] busy doing something and I just Twisted
[56:53] a certain way and I heard a pop and I
[56:56] felt a pop and the thing that I thought
[56:59] was a bruise in my rib was actually a
[57:01] lot more than what I thought and so I
[57:04] went to emergency and the doctor told me
[57:06] you have a broken rib and so he's given
[57:09] me medication and uh I'm okay so I so
[57:13] long as I'm on the medication the pain
[57:15] isn't very strong but I just thought it
[57:18] would be safe to invite brother Toby to
[57:21] see if he wanted to expound upon maybe
[57:23] the Youth Event last night so we'll just
[57:25] see what the Lord has in store with our
[57:27] brother there but I do want to thank
[57:29] everyone for your prayers the Lord's
[57:31] been good to me the doctor put it into
[57:33] perspective when I told him I think I
[57:36] have a broken rib he said is that all
[57:39] said yeah I think that's all certainly
[57:42] wonderful sometimes just to take a step
[57:44] back and and look at our lives and
[57:46] recognize that the Lord is so good to us
[57:48] isn't he
[57:50] maybe if you have a need this morning
[57:51] just make it known to him with an uplift
[57:53] hand we just have one request from the

[1:02:04] and we trust that the Lord is here to
[1:02:06] bless us
[1:02:08] thank you musicians thanks for
[1:02:11] setting the atmosphere thank you for the
[1:02:14] fall as well and for all the specials
[1:02:16] that were wonderful just before we read
[1:02:19] the scripture I just want to acknowledge
[1:02:20] some visitors in our midst brother tolu
[1:02:25] sister dolapo bang boy they're
[1:02:28] originally from Nigeria and there they
[1:02:31] have three kids Ron Jesse and Nathan
[1:02:34] you're welcome and uh God bless you
[1:02:40] I think we didn't get the chance to get
[1:02:42] their names earlier so brother Peter
[1:02:44] just go there and give it to me let's
[1:02:46] just quickly turn on the scriptures this
[1:02:48] morning to Romans chapter 8.
[1:02:51] very familiar scripture
[1:02:54] I don't want to have you sit and make
[1:02:56] you stand again so
[1:02:58] we'll just read the scriptures and I'll
[1:03:00] have you take your seat
[1:03:03] I'm going to start reading from
[1:03:07] verse 31 and I'll read you verse 39.
[1:03:15] if you don't mind just giving me some
[1:03:17] volume on the monitors so I don't
[1:03:20] find myself screaming
[1:03:25] all right so um verse 31 says what shall
[1:03:28] we then say to these things and we know
[1:03:32] this was false speaking right into the
[1:03:34] Romans
[1:03:36] said if God be for us who can be against
[1:03:39] us
[1:03:40] he that spared not his own son but
[1:03:44] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:03:47] not with him also freely give us all
[1:03:50] things
[1:03:52] who shall lay anything against
[1:03:55] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:03:58] is God that justifieth we see that
[1:04:00] condemneth it is Christ that died year
[1:04:03] rather that is risen again who is even
[1:04:06] at the right hand of God who also
[1:04:09] makeeth into session for us
[1:04:12] he said who shall separate us from the
[1:04:14] love of Christ
[1:04:16] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:04:19] persecution or farming or nakedness or
[1:04:23] Peril or sword
[1:04:25] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:04:27] killed all the day long we are counted
[1:04:30] as sheep for the slaughter
[1:04:33] nay in all those things we are more than
[1:04:37] conquerors
[1:04:41] it said through him that loved us
[1:04:45] for I am persuaded like neither death
[1:04:48] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:04:51] no powers no things present no death nor
[1:04:57] sorry no things present no things to
[1:04:58] come no height no death nor any other
[1:05:01] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:05:03] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:05:06] Jesus our lord let's just vow to pray
[1:05:09] before we take us it's their father
[1:05:12] the hour is here Lord Jesus Christ where
[1:05:14] we are going to hear from you what you
[1:05:17] have to say to us today
[1:05:20] we know Lord Jesus Christ that before
[1:05:22] the foundation of the world you knew
[1:05:24] about today you knew about the state of
[1:05:27] every life that is present here you know
[1:05:31] the needs in our lives Lord Jesus at
[1:05:34] this very moment Lord Jesus and we know
[1:05:37] Lord Jesus that you have provided that
[1:05:40] Lord Jesus which is required to meet our
[1:05:43] needs this morning we ask that you open
[1:05:46] up our hearts yourself Lord Jesus may
[1:05:49] you take me out of the way father Lord
[1:05:51] Jesus May the Holy Spirit by inspiration
[1:05:54] speak to the hearts of your people may I
[1:05:57] be blessed as well Lord Jesus through
[1:05:59] those words that you are going to speak
[1:06:00] to us may we leave this place rejoicing
[1:06:03] for in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:06:07] amen you may have your sin
[1:06:11] just so anyone else
[1:06:14] not nervous I know this preaching is
[1:06:17] starting late but I would not take time
[1:06:19] at all
[1:06:20] so just uh sit down relax
[1:06:23] and trust that the Lord will speak with
[1:06:25] us this morning
[1:06:27] this morning I want to bring the title
[1:06:31] God is responsible for you
[1:06:35] and I don't know what that means to you
[1:06:37] but I was thinking about it I guess
[1:06:39] yesterday
[1:06:40] if you were trying to go on vacation and
[1:06:43] you were trying to save money and you
[1:06:45] know the bills are just too many you're
[1:06:47] not able to make it and just
[1:06:50] out of the Blues someone offers you an
[1:06:52] all-expensed paid trip to Hawaii
[1:06:57] you're not going to worry about saving
[1:06:59] money anymore
[1:07:01] what you desired in your heart
[1:07:04] you are no more responsible for it
[1:07:07] someone else is paying the bills someone
[1:07:10] else is taking up the cost someone else
[1:07:13] is responsible for your trip
[1:07:16] and if you work in a company that you
[1:07:18] know will send you overseas to to do
[1:07:21] some work some official work you know
[1:07:23] that you don't have to worry about the
[1:07:25] the ticket I mean the very first time I
[1:07:27] flew a business class it was it was so
[1:07:30] good
[1:07:31] I was going for
[1:07:33] um was supposed to be an official trip
[1:07:35] in in the UK then I was in Nigeria and I
[1:07:37] flew British Airways and when I sat in
[1:07:41] the business class and I started to get
[1:07:43] the business class service I was feeling
[1:07:45] like a big man people that saw me would
[1:07:48] think that I had the money
[1:07:50] you know that someone else that bought
[1:07:52] the ticket themselves had
[1:07:54] but it was not my responsibility
[1:07:57] it was the responsibility of this
[1:07:58] company that was sending me on an
[1:08:00] official duty to buy the ticket to put
[1:08:04] me in that flight and I enjoyed all the
[1:08:07] benefits
[1:08:10] I didn't have to be the one that paid
[1:08:11] for it but I enjoyed the benefits now
[1:08:15] this morning I'm saying to you that the
[1:08:17] god of Heaven the one that created
[1:08:19] heaven and earth is responsible for you
[1:08:23] I don't know if there's anything that
[1:08:26] should make you fear when you come to a
[1:08:28] realization that the god of Heaven is
[1:08:31] responsible for your life
[1:08:33] the brother Brian said in this message
[1:08:35] and this is a quote that if you have the
[1:08:37] privilege to book Market I will
[1:08:39] recommend that you bookmark it and
[1:08:41] always go back to it the message the
[1:08:43] great Shining Light brother Brahm says
[1:08:45] but it gives us consolation
[1:08:48] to know this
[1:08:50] that we do not hold our destiny
[1:08:54] god holds our destiny and he has
[1:08:58] ordained it to be so and there is
[1:09:01] nothing
[1:09:03] nothing we just read that now Paul told
[1:09:06] us he said there is I'm persuaded that
[1:09:10] neither debt nor life nor angels no
[1:09:12] principalities no powers no things
[1:09:14] present no things to come nor height nor
[1:09:17] deaths don't any other creature shall be
[1:09:22] able to separate us from the love of God
[1:09:23] and but the brand said there is nothing
[1:09:26] will ever interrupt the program of God
[1:09:31] nothing we interrupt the program of God
[1:09:34] he said we are bound to arrive
[1:09:41] oh this makes me feel good
[1:09:44] nothing we interrupt the program of God
[1:09:46] you know as humans many times we see our
[1:09:49] life in a limited uh uh uh from a
[1:09:52] limited lens I'll say we look at the
[1:09:55] present we look at the immediate past we
[1:09:58] look at we anticipate the immediate
[1:09:59] future but when God looks at our lives
[1:10:02] God is looking at his entire Plan of
[1:10:04] Redemption we're going to get to it but
[1:10:07] I want you to know this morning that
[1:10:09] before the foundation of the world God
[1:10:12] had a plan and as God was laying out
[1:10:15] that plan from when time will begin from
[1:10:18] when he said let there be light God laid
[1:10:20] out that plan from the beginning of time
[1:10:22] to the end of time which makes it from
[1:10:25] eternity to Eternity and when God was
[1:10:28] laying out that plan for each of his
[1:10:31] children God had a space for you in that
[1:10:34] plan from the moment when you were born
[1:10:37] to all through your life to the moment
[1:10:39] it will take you home or take you in the
[1:10:42] Rapture God was very detailed about the
[1:10:45] plan
[1:10:46] what does that mean there is nothing
[1:10:48] that is happening in your life that is
[1:10:50] outside of that Clan as a matter of fact
[1:10:53] if something is happening in your life
[1:10:55] that is not in that plan that means the
[1:10:58] plan of God is about to be defeated
[1:11:00] and the purpose of God cannot be
[1:11:02] defeated you believe that same amen this
[1:11:04] morning
[1:11:07] we see God demonstrate this
[1:11:10] to people and I was having a
[1:11:11] conversation with my dad on the phone
[1:11:12] yesterday just fellowshipping around the
[1:11:15] world
[1:11:16] and one of the things I said I said Dad
[1:11:19] I said it's interesting to know that you
[1:11:22] know the Bible will tell us that all the
[1:11:23] things in the scriptures were written
[1:11:25] for our examples
[1:11:27] and we can always go back to it but the
[1:11:30] man will tell us that if you see what
[1:11:31] God has done for something for someone
[1:11:33] before it gives you the opportunity it
[1:11:36] gives you the it gives you the Assurance
[1:11:37] to know that God that did that for that
[1:11:40] person upon the basis of the faith of
[1:11:43] that person if you come upon the same
[1:11:45] basis God will do the same for you
[1:11:48] and we know that there's this character
[1:11:50] in The Bible called Joseph
[1:11:52] was a dreamer he was born a dreamer he
[1:11:55] did not make himself a dreamer but God
[1:11:58] made a more prophet and by the way of
[1:12:00] her dream God was showing him his future
[1:12:04] now just there was so little to
[1:12:05] understand what was going on in his life
[1:12:08] was probably confused and as any little
[1:12:11] child will go and tell their dream
[1:12:13] sometimes it could be a nightmare and
[1:12:15] for Joseph that might have been very
[1:12:17] close to a nightmare
[1:12:19] they got to tell their siblings they go
[1:12:21] to tell their parents I had the street
[1:12:23] so Joseph went and told his parents I
[1:12:26] had a dream and told the siblings I had
[1:12:28] a dream I had a dream I saw myself we
[1:12:31] were all in in the field and and we all
[1:12:34] took our sheaves and and you laid your
[1:12:36] sheep down mine was there and all of you
[1:12:39] were bowing down to mine
[1:12:41] and then he had another dream he said he
[1:12:43] saw the sun and the moon and Eleven
[1:12:45] stars bowing down to him he didn't
[1:12:47] understand what this was
[1:12:49] but when he related his dream to the
[1:12:51] people that were supposed to understand
[1:12:53] people that were close to him he brought
[1:12:56] hatred
[1:12:58] for most of them they started to to to
[1:13:00] to resent that dream they started to
[1:13:03] hate him for that dream and Joseph
[1:13:05] didn't understand what was going on God
[1:13:08] was expressing to Joseph what was going
[1:13:10] to happen in his future
[1:13:13] and if Joseph you know were to
[1:13:16] anticipate how that was going to happen
[1:13:19] Joseph would not have seen everything
[1:13:20] that was in between
[1:13:25] so many times we are like Joseph
[1:13:28] we think that when God makes us a
[1:13:30] promise
[1:13:31] God fulfilling that promise is going to
[1:13:34] be a flowery bed of roses
[1:13:38] but that is not how it is
[1:13:40] because when God laid out that plan God
[1:13:42] ensured that there were Hills and
[1:13:46] Valleys
[1:13:47] there was day and night
[1:13:51] when God laid out that plan because God
[1:13:54] was trying to ensure that all that you
[1:13:56] require
[1:13:58] to bring you to that perfect purpose
[1:14:02] oh wonderful we're having a conversation
[1:14:04] on Friday night
[1:14:06] talking about the shepherd the Good
[1:14:08] Shepherd psalm 23.
[1:14:11] and if you go back and read I guess just
[1:14:13] six verses of that chapter
[1:14:15] you will realize that everything that
[1:14:18] was being said about the shepherd was
[1:14:20] showing how the shepherd is responsible
[1:14:22] for the Sheep
[1:14:25] now not all of the things sounded good
[1:14:28] for the Sheep when when David will say
[1:14:31] that he he he lead at me in the path of
[1:14:34] righteousness for example and again it
[1:14:36] now comes and says he takes me through
[1:14:38] the valley of the shadow of death
[1:14:41] that's no fun at all
[1:14:44] but that's part of the plan
[1:14:46] now the purpose of the shepherd
[1:14:49] the ultimate purpose of the shepherd is
[1:14:53] to ensure that that sheep can come to
[1:14:56] its full potential
[1:15:00] we as parents know what that means when
[1:15:02] we're raising our kids
[1:15:04] sometimes coming to full potential
[1:15:06] requires some spanking
[1:15:09] and I'm not advocating that you have to
[1:15:11] beat up your kids that's not what I'm
[1:15:13] saying here
[1:15:14] but sometimes it also requires some
[1:15:17] denial
[1:15:19] when your child will say Mommy I want
[1:15:21] this and you know that this is not good
[1:15:22] for the child the child does not
[1:15:25] understand that he's not good for them
[1:15:26] but you have a superior understanding
[1:15:29] and because you want the full potential
[1:15:33] of that child to come to pass in the
[1:15:34] future you deny them of that
[1:15:37] it's a way of showing love
[1:15:40] and the father a Heavenly Father shows
[1:15:43] us love many times just as he was doing
[1:15:45] to Joseph the Pastor Joseph becoming a
[1:15:49] ruler the path to Joseph having his
[1:15:51] brothers and and his mother and the
[1:15:53] father bow before him like he saw in the
[1:15:55] dream was not going to be a flowery bed
[1:15:57] of roses
[1:15:59] it was going to be the Crooked ways it
[1:16:02] was going to be the Lawson Park
[1:16:04] when it was it was going to find himself
[1:16:08] as a slave to the hidden
[1:16:11] God had given them a promise God had
[1:16:14] given Abraham the promise your sister
[1:16:17] possess the gates of their enemies
[1:16:21] and that would have been related down
[1:16:23] from from from the generations down to
[1:16:26] Joseph that was what the word says but
[1:16:29] the same enemies are taking him captive
[1:16:31] and was supposed to be a slave to them
[1:16:34] but one thing that God does all through
[1:16:36] our life's journey God will ensure that
[1:16:39] his presence is always felt
[1:16:43] I like what Mr Queen said this morning
[1:16:45] and that's quote that she read we just
[1:16:47] got to take away the cloud and we're
[1:16:49] going to see that the sun is there
[1:16:52] so sometimes God takes us through those
[1:16:54] experiences where it seems as if God is
[1:16:57] not there but you just take away the
[1:16:59] cloud and you will see that is the ever
[1:17:01] present help in the time of trouble
[1:17:05] so just have found himself in Egypt
[1:17:08] it was light against
[1:17:11] it was rejected
[1:17:13] it had hot trials
[1:17:15] he had testings
[1:17:17] all of this was part of the plan
[1:17:21] Joseph was not responsible for himself
[1:17:24] Joseph was not responsible for himself
[1:17:26] to come out of prison as a matter of
[1:17:28] fact Joseph was trying to help himself
[1:17:32] when those two servants of pharaoh that
[1:17:34] were in the in in the prison with him
[1:17:36] when they had their dreams and Joseph
[1:17:38] came and told them what okay this is the
[1:17:40] meaning of your dream and he came to
[1:17:41] pass just exactly and he had told the
[1:17:44] bot lab please when this happens don't
[1:17:46] forget me
[1:17:48] but God made the bottler to forget
[1:17:52] because the revealing of Joseph
[1:17:55] the revealing of the gifts in Joseph to
[1:17:58] Pharaoh was for an appointed time
[1:18:02] if it came earlier
[1:18:04] if if Joseph came out of the prison
[1:18:06] earlier than that it would have been
[1:18:08] before the dream
[1:18:10] it would have been before Pharaoh's
[1:18:12] dream but God signed it God made sure it
[1:18:16] was perfect God made the butler to
[1:18:18] forget
[1:18:19] so that when the time of need came when
[1:18:22] the King was looking for someone to
[1:18:25] interpret his dream it would be at that
[1:18:27] time that the butler will remember oh my
[1:18:29] Lord the king I'm ashamed of myself
[1:18:32] there was a man I met in prison
[1:18:35] and this man told me the meaning of my
[1:18:37] dream
[1:18:38] and this man can help you as well
[1:18:40] so God was watching over his word
[1:18:43] to perform it
[1:18:45] abacock tells us set for the vision
[1:18:48] is yet for an appointed time
[1:18:51] he said but at the end it shall Speak oh
[1:18:56] what Vision has the Lord given you
[1:18:59] that seem to linger
[1:19:04] what is that request you've placed
[1:19:06] before the Lord
[1:19:08] that seemed to linger
[1:19:10] and it seems as if it's not going to
[1:19:12] happen
[1:19:14] but he's telling us this morning but at
[1:19:17] the end it shall speak
[1:19:19] and not lie God is not a man that he
[1:19:24] should lie
[1:19:25] neither is he a son of man that she
[1:19:27] should repent we're having a
[1:19:28] conversation with the young people
[1:19:29] yesterday
[1:19:32] and the fact that when you grow up in
[1:19:35] the message
[1:19:37] it's a little bit different from someone
[1:19:38] that comes from the outside
[1:19:41] your Christian work
[1:19:44] because you've lived your life
[1:19:46] in such a way that it aligns with the
[1:19:49] word of God
[1:19:50] you've been obedient to your parents and
[1:19:53] you get to a point you're finding a
[1:19:55] difficult
[1:19:56] so think of what you can repent of
[1:20:00] because in actual fact
[1:20:02] you've done everything right
[1:20:05] and when you do something wrong you make
[1:20:07] it right and according to the word of
[1:20:09] God you're forgiven
[1:20:12] but sometimes we dwell in our
[1:20:13] self-righteousness
[1:20:16] and that becomes an hindrance for God to
[1:20:19] work in our lives
[1:20:20] for God to reveal himself to us
[1:20:24] so regardless of what you're going
[1:20:26] through
[1:20:27] regardless one of the things you should
[1:20:29] remember is that before the foundation
[1:20:32] of the world got planned out your life
[1:20:36] now God gave us a clue what the end will
[1:20:39] be
[1:20:41] he made us understand that your end is
[1:20:45] coming to perfection
[1:20:47] is to be conformed to the image of the
[1:20:50] Son of God and you're going to go
[1:20:52] through things that look totally
[1:20:54] different from that you're going to go
[1:20:57] through situations that will make you
[1:20:59] feel that that will never happen but
[1:21:01] he's telling you this morning though
[1:21:03] it's tari he said You shall do what wait
[1:21:07] for it
[1:21:10] it could be hard to wait
[1:21:13] think about those virtues in First Peter
[1:21:16] chapter 2.
[1:21:17] and the one I find you know
[1:21:20] as I'll call it a milestone of our
[1:21:23] growth as Christians as patients
[1:21:26] but the brand was saying in Statue of
[1:21:27] perfect blood he said what is patience
[1:21:29] he said patience with God and patience
[1:21:32] with man
[1:21:35] sometimes it's hard to be patient with
[1:21:36] God because we want God to do it right
[1:21:38] away
[1:21:40] and when it comes to being patient with
[1:21:41] men
[1:21:43] speak to the couples
[1:21:47] it's hard
[1:21:49] right it's hard to be patient with your
[1:21:51] husband it's hard to be patient with
[1:21:53] your wife God knows how to do it I've
[1:21:55] noticed that in many marriages God will
[1:21:58] bring two unlike poles together
[1:22:03] if you're very organized very likely
[1:22:06] your wife is not
[1:22:10] why will God do that
[1:22:17] but why will God do that
[1:22:20] because God the institution of marriage
[1:22:24] is a place for development it's a place
[1:22:26] for learning we understand why it's I
[1:22:29] mean you wonder why it's called an
[1:22:30] institution because it's a place of
[1:22:33] learning it's a place of building
[1:22:35] character
[1:22:37] and if you talk to those that have been
[1:22:38] married for years
[1:22:40] sometimes when they talk to the younger
[1:22:42] ones they'll just tell them you know you
[1:22:43] need to calm down
[1:22:45] oh is she going to change
[1:22:47] well she might not change well you'll
[1:22:49] get used to it
[1:22:51] and that's what happens because God
[1:22:53] brings us there to make us to develop
[1:22:55] character
[1:22:57] so all of those things they are planned
[1:23:00] out by God remember the title this
[1:23:02] morning is that God is responsible and
[1:23:05] if there's anyone that can actually make
[1:23:07] a plan that works
[1:23:10] then it's God
[1:23:15] you know I think about David I don't
[1:23:17] think there's any time I preach I don't
[1:23:18] talk about David because the life of
[1:23:20] David is just so much of
[1:23:24] a lesson to us but also a an expression
[1:23:27] of the grace of God an expression of
[1:23:29] God's blessings an expression of God's
[1:23:31] attributes various attributes that God
[1:23:33] expressed through David
[1:23:35] but you know that David was just an
[1:23:37] ordinary Shepherd boy
[1:23:39] turned into the Sheep at the backside of
[1:23:42] the desert
[1:23:44] and he must have been having some
[1:23:46] experience with God as we read on the
[1:23:48] terms and we'll know that God was
[1:23:50] actually teaching David about himself
[1:23:53] using nature
[1:23:56] God knows how to use what you know to
[1:23:59] express himself to you
[1:24:02] if you're a musician God can use music
[1:24:05] to express himself to you because he
[1:24:08] knows that that is something that you're
[1:24:10] familiar with
[1:24:11] so God was doing that to David
[1:24:13] expressing himself to David in in the
[1:24:16] wilderness in in the field David will
[1:24:19] talk about the creation of God he will
[1:24:22] talk about the greatness of God he will
[1:24:24] talk about the Sun the Moon it will talk
[1:24:26] about those Stars it will talk about all
[1:24:28] the creation of God how they were
[1:24:30] expressing God because God was revealing
[1:24:32] himself to David
[1:24:35] and when King Saul did something that
[1:24:37] God said was unpardonable for him at
[1:24:40] least when it comes to the decision of
[1:24:42] the Kingdom God sent Samuel the prophet
[1:24:45] to go and anoint David and we know the
[1:24:47] stories I'm not going to go into it but
[1:24:49] when Samuel anointed David
[1:24:53] one of the things I want you to realize
[1:24:54] we don't often talk about it but it took
[1:24:57] about 20 years
[1:24:59] before that promise was fulfilled
[1:25:03] took 20 years
[1:25:05] David was anointed king
[1:25:08] the anointing was upon him but between
[1:25:11] the time he was anointed king and when
[1:25:13] he really became king of Israel was
[1:25:16] about 20 years
[1:25:17] what was happening in between
[1:25:20] God gave him some victories that's
[1:25:22] that's good sometimes it gives us that
[1:25:24] it killed Goliath all the women were
[1:25:27] shouted and praising and saying Saul has
[1:25:31] killed his thousands but David has
[1:25:33] killed his ten thousands that would have
[1:25:35] made him feel proud that was that was a
[1:25:38] a an assurance to him again that God was
[1:25:41] with him
[1:25:42] that was a sign that that anointing that
[1:25:44] came from the prophet was right and was
[1:25:47] true
[1:25:48] but yet again
[1:25:50] just after that
[1:25:52] the king that David was servants to King
[1:25:55] Saul started to persecute him
[1:25:58] how do you explain that
[1:26:00] but that was all in the plan of God
[1:26:04] many times we want God to do things
[1:26:06] right at the time when he promised that
[1:26:08] he was going to do it sometimes we don't
[1:26:10] want to wait but God has a plan God is
[1:26:12] responsible for every step of the way
[1:26:18] so David got to a point
[1:26:20] where you had to look back at this
[1:26:22] creature
[1:26:23] and realized that there was a man before
[1:26:26] his time whose name was Joseph who also
[1:26:29] had to wait on the Lord because if we go
[1:26:31] and and
[1:26:33] you know look at Sam 105 verse 17 to 19
[1:26:37] David was writing about Joseph
[1:26:40] he said the center man before them even
[1:26:42] Joseph who was sold for his servants
[1:26:44] whose feet they hurt with Fetters it was
[1:26:48] laid in Iron until the time that his
[1:26:51] word came
[1:26:55] God is the one that watcheth over his
[1:26:58] word to perform it what does that mean
[1:27:01] when God says something
[1:27:03] God takes responsibility for what he has
[1:27:05] said
[1:27:07] and God watches over that word as events
[1:27:09] start to unfold God is watching over
[1:27:12] that word waiting for the word to get to
[1:27:15] its point of manifestation
[1:27:18] and God ensures that he comes to pass
[1:27:20] just as he said it would
[1:27:26] as God made a promise to you this
[1:27:28] morning
[1:27:30] wait for it
[1:27:34] and when it comes to God making promises
[1:27:36] it applies to everything in our lives
[1:27:39] you want a new job God can give it to
[1:27:42] you
[1:27:44] you're going through some trials in your
[1:27:46] life there's a sickness there's
[1:27:48] something that's wrong with you there's
[1:27:49] something the wrong that's wrong with a
[1:27:51] loved one if you come to God upon the
[1:27:53] basis of his word
[1:27:56] God will do it for you
[1:27:59] is this promise
[1:28:01] whatever you desire I don't know how I'm
[1:28:03] feeling this morning but I'm just
[1:28:04] feeling so much Faith right here that
[1:28:07] whatever you desire
[1:28:09] whatever you desire if you've never
[1:28:11] desired it before if it's right now
[1:28:13] you're Desiring it lay a stick at this
[1:28:16] moments and say God you made this
[1:28:19] promise you will bring it to pass
[1:28:28] so why do we know that God is
[1:28:30] responsible for us
[1:28:32] what makes us know that God
[1:28:35] is not just watching us living our lives
[1:28:39] and being that's that's Headmaster or
[1:28:43] that's that principle that will just
[1:28:46] show up when we've done something wrong
[1:28:48] or that Taskmaster
[1:28:51] the Brahm said let's take a trip
[1:28:54] to before the foundation of the world
[1:28:57] when God was by himself
[1:28:59] he said it was not God at that time it
[1:29:01] was Elohim
[1:29:02] because there was no one to worship him
[1:29:05] he had not made any creature to worship
[1:29:07] Him it was when God was by himself that
[1:29:10] God had attributed himself
[1:29:12] God has the attributes to be a father
[1:29:15] God has the attributes to be a Healer
[1:29:17] God has the attribute he had the desire
[1:29:20] he had the potential
[1:29:22] to be a redeemer to be a husband
[1:29:27] to be the king of kings
[1:29:29] to be the mighty conqueror
[1:29:31] all of this were Desires in the heart of
[1:29:34] God and many more things
[1:29:37] so to fulfill that desire God started to
[1:29:41] lay out a plan
[1:29:43] God let our plan part of that plan was
[1:29:46] God was going to create angels
[1:29:48] part of that plan was God was going to
[1:29:50] make Man In His Image in his likeness it
[1:29:55] was going to make the spirit man and as
[1:29:57] we're learning Genesis chapter 2 God was
[1:29:59] going to put that spirit in a flesh body
[1:30:03] and God was going to bring out of that
[1:30:05] man the feminine part and the man was
[1:30:08] going to call her the woman
[1:30:13] in that plan was to fall
[1:30:15] but Ibraham said that God made us free
[1:30:18] moral agencies
[1:30:19] what does that mean God brought us God
[1:30:22] God brought us to this earth and gave us
[1:30:24] the the the the the the the the choice
[1:30:27] The Power of Choice you know he can make
[1:30:29] a choice but God also had a full
[1:30:32] knowledge
[1:30:33] so God knew the ending right from the
[1:30:36] beginning
[1:30:37] and when God did that part of that plan
[1:30:40] was the four was going to happen and our
[1:30:43] Plan of Redemption was set in place
[1:30:47] now when God was writing that Plan of
[1:30:50] Redemption he had you in that plan
[1:30:54] so he set out that Plan of Redemption
[1:30:57] in that Plan of Redemption there was
[1:30:59] election
[1:31:01] and what is election election tells us
[1:31:04] that God was going to elect a certain
[1:31:07] group of people
[1:31:09] now God is Not unfair and unjust just as
[1:31:13] I've said a moment ago God did his
[1:31:15] election by foreknowledge
[1:31:17] God is Not cherry picking and saying
[1:31:19] this will go to heaven that will go to
[1:31:22] Perdition no God knew the egg from the
[1:31:25] beginning and when God saw the ones that
[1:31:27] will accept him what did God do God put
[1:31:30] a stamp to it God
[1:31:33] predestinated them what is
[1:31:35] predestination I'd like to explain it
[1:31:37] this way it's a pre-de predetermination
[1:31:40] of your destination
[1:31:44] determination of your destiny where the
[1:31:46] Bram cell told us that quote I read he
[1:31:48] said that god holds our destiny
[1:31:51] we are bound to arrive
[1:31:55] so God knew that before the foundation
[1:31:57] of the world that this person this boy
[1:32:01] this girl would give their life to me
[1:32:03] they'll serve me they might go through
[1:32:05] trials they might go in sin they will
[1:32:07] repent they will come back to me and God
[1:32:09] put a stamp to it that this will happen
[1:32:15] and in that kind of redemption like I
[1:32:16] said before there was the form
[1:32:18] why did God allow the fall
[1:32:21] God knew that without the fall he could
[1:32:24] not express his attribute of being a
[1:32:25] Healer
[1:32:27] because there won't be sickness
[1:32:31] it says to Germaine is here this morning
[1:32:33] trusting the Lord for healing but that
[1:32:36] was part of the plan
[1:32:38] we as humans will look at it and we'll
[1:32:40] say why is this woman suffering why
[1:32:42] can't God just God I've read this
[1:32:45] happening to her and just keep her
[1:32:46] imperfect and all the days of our life
[1:32:48] but that was part of his plan because he
[1:32:50] wants to be a Healer
[1:32:51] brother said if no one is sick there is
[1:32:54] no one for God to heal
[1:32:56] but God takes us through those trials
[1:32:59] brings the sicknesses upon us so that we
[1:33:01] can depend on him and then he can
[1:33:04] express that attribute of being a Healer
[1:33:10] wanted to be a savior so people had to
[1:33:13] sin
[1:33:15] he also wanted to be a deliverer
[1:33:19] in times when we cannot help ourselves
[1:33:22] when we come to our wheat cent Peter we
[1:33:25] tell us he said that the trial of your
[1:33:27] faith
[1:33:29] being more precious than gold
[1:33:33] but I didn't I had the first time I had
[1:33:35] the opportunity to go to South Africa I
[1:33:37] was my colleague and I were in the car
[1:33:39] being driven by
[1:33:41] or driver and we were driving on the
[1:33:44] highway and I saw this like a hilly
[1:33:47] place on the left and I was asking the
[1:33:48] driver where is that he just looks like
[1:33:50] mountains Hills and he said well that is
[1:33:52] where they are mining gold
[1:33:56] I was like wow this doesn't look
[1:33:58] desirable at all just look like red sand
[1:34:01] or something it doesn't look like gold
[1:34:05] but when a human being who God gave the
[1:34:09] wisdom to understand that that can be
[1:34:11] something that becomes precious goes
[1:34:13] there and extracts it it's got to take
[1:34:16] it through a process
[1:34:19] is going to take you through the
[1:34:20] refiners fire
[1:34:22] it has to take everything that is unlike
[1:34:26] the substance that is looking for
[1:34:28] because what we were seeing at that um
[1:34:31] right there
[1:34:32] um on the left on the highway was not
[1:34:34] gold
[1:34:35] was inside it but that wasn't gold
[1:34:40] and that's how our lives are when the
[1:34:41] Lord
[1:34:42] calls us manifests us here we are not
[1:34:46] yet in the image of Christ
[1:34:48] but God is extracting that image out of
[1:34:52] us taking out everything that is unlike
[1:34:54] him so that we can be fully conformed to
[1:34:57] His Image ultimately
[1:35:00] so Peter was telling us here he said the
[1:35:02] trial of your faith
[1:35:05] is much more precious than gold that
[1:35:10] perisheth
[1:35:12] though it be tried with fire
[1:35:17] so he's telling us that the trying of
[1:35:19] our faith
[1:35:20] when you compare that to gold gold is
[1:35:23] gold is very
[1:35:26] it's very it's Priceless almost
[1:35:28] it's pricey people spend a lot of money
[1:35:31] on it some people get obsessed with it
[1:35:34] they use their money to buy so much gold
[1:35:37] much more than they require thank God
[1:35:39] our sisters don't wear jewelries
[1:35:41] at least except the husband gives them
[1:35:44] something
[1:35:45] necklace Bill Graham said is okay
[1:35:50] but you realize that women that were
[1:35:52] hearings that were chains on their legs
[1:35:56] that were they spent so much money
[1:35:59] on gold
[1:36:02] and I mean back back in Nigeria if if
[1:36:05] someone boggles your house the first
[1:36:07] thing they are looking for is gold
[1:36:09] because they can make a lot of money
[1:36:10] from it
[1:36:12] we even know that the currency the what
[1:36:15] we probably will call the currency of
[1:36:18] the Roman Catholic Church is gold
[1:36:21] the only app the largest amount of gold
[1:36:23] so it's it is actually precious from
[1:36:25] Human understanding it's pricing from
[1:36:27] Human understanding but Peter is telling
[1:36:30] us here that that in terms of value you
[1:36:34] cannot compare that with your trials
[1:36:37] what does this mean
[1:36:39] it means that God sees more value
[1:36:43] in the trials that he allows to come our
[1:36:45] lives
[1:36:47] than the value that we see in gold
[1:36:52] can you think about that for a moment
[1:36:56] the trials of my life I don't I don't
[1:36:58] value it I don't even want it
[1:37:01] was a song with my my wife was singing
[1:37:04] and he said sometimes you need to be
[1:37:07] you need to be careful of the kind of
[1:37:09] sounds you sing and I can't remember the
[1:37:10] song we had to do with God try me in the
[1:37:12] fire
[1:37:13] refine me
[1:37:17] and she was singing and she was getting
[1:37:18] scared if God were to refine me I said
[1:37:20] but God has to refine us
[1:37:22] we really need to get refined otherwise
[1:37:24] we can't be like him but Abraham said
[1:37:27] that that Goldsmith we continue to
[1:37:29] refine the gold until when it starts to
[1:37:31] see his reflection in the gold
[1:37:38] so refine us fire yes we all need it
[1:37:41] because that trial that we are getting
[1:37:44] it's more precious than gold tried in
[1:37:47] the fire
[1:37:49] so everything that is happening in your
[1:37:51] life
[1:37:52] was all planned out by God
[1:37:57] what does that mean for the believer no
[1:38:00] regrets
[1:38:03] but the brand said a Christian will
[1:38:05] never lose
[1:38:08] what does that mean there's nothing that
[1:38:10] happens in your life like oh I wish this
[1:38:12] never happened no it was part of the
[1:38:16] plan
[1:38:18] what do we have to do just trust the
[1:38:20] process
[1:38:21] trust the shepherd
[1:38:24] earlier on in the chapter we read Paul
[1:38:27] says that and we know that all things
[1:38:28] work together for the good for good to
[1:38:32] them that love God to them who are
[1:38:34] called according to his purpose
[1:38:39] so if anything is not working for your
[1:38:40] goods
[1:38:42] that is altering the plan of God
[1:38:45] and that cannot happen
[1:38:48] the plan of God cannot be altered he
[1:38:51] said for whom he did for no he also did
[1:38:53] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:38:56] image of his son that he might be the
[1:38:59] firstborn among many brethren
[1:39:02] so now we see that the reason why God
[1:39:04] brought us here as I've said before is
[1:39:07] that we be conformed to the image of his
[1:39:09] son
[1:39:09] remember I said as well that the purpose
[1:39:12] of the shepherd lead on the Sheep
[1:39:16] through various terrains is so that that
[1:39:19] ship can come to its full potential
[1:39:21] if the ship is being raised for the wool
[1:39:24] the shepherd will do everything possible
[1:39:26] to be sure that the wool comes out at
[1:39:28] the right time and he gets the maximum
[1:39:30] amount of wool that he can get
[1:39:32] if he's been raised you know for the
[1:39:36] meat is going to be sure that it comes
[1:39:38] to the size that is good enough for him
[1:39:40] to be able to get into the market and
[1:39:42] sell it at a good price
[1:39:44] bringing out the full potential of the
[1:39:47] Sheep
[1:39:50] but many times
[1:39:52] they are crooked ways
[1:39:54] they're rough paths
[1:39:56] there are ups and downs the things that
[1:39:58] we don't want in our lives that God we
[1:40:00] allow and that's why I always refer to
[1:40:02] that song only believe
[1:40:06] one of the verses said your Shepherd
[1:40:08] selected the path you must tread
[1:40:12] when you talk about selection it means
[1:40:14] that there were all the choices
[1:40:16] there were other choices that looked
[1:40:18] better to us but what did he do
[1:40:21] he looked at the one that he sees the
[1:40:23] best
[1:40:25] because he knows the end from the
[1:40:26] beginning
[1:40:29] so whenever you find yourself in a
[1:40:30] situation
[1:40:32] the right question to ask is not why me
[1:40:36] the right question to ask is will this
[1:40:39] situation
[1:40:41] lead me to becoming more conforms to the
[1:40:44] image of Christ
[1:40:46] if it's going to lead me to be more like
[1:40:48] Jesus if by time I've fallen
[1:40:51] and Rising
[1:40:53] will be so that I can have character and
[1:40:56] be like Jesus then that is the best for
[1:41:00] me
[1:41:01] that is working according to plan
[1:41:04] and I was looking up the song goodness
[1:41:06] of God
[1:41:08] and the
[1:41:09] person that wrote it the couple that
[1:41:11] wrote it I think it was a woman
[1:41:13] and uh the the story behind the song is
[1:41:16] not so much I mean it's not like very
[1:41:18] phenomenal but it had to do with this
[1:41:21] couple they were they had just adopted
[1:41:24] their fourth child and I think they
[1:41:28] they've had like couple of their they
[1:41:30] had their own children biological
[1:41:31] children I think and this was the second
[1:41:33] one they were adopted
[1:41:35] and she was just driving down you know
[1:41:37] after picking up the boy
[1:41:39] and
[1:41:42] she was just thinking about all the
[1:41:45] process of the adoption
[1:41:47] and that was when that song dropped in
[1:41:49] our hearts
[1:41:50] the goodness of God
[1:41:53] and started she started painting that
[1:41:56] down she was on the long Country Road
[1:41:59] just driving and thinking about the
[1:42:02] faithfulness and the kindness of God
[1:42:05] and I was thinking about how much that
[1:42:07] song has blessed people around the world
[1:42:10] today there's hardly anywhere you go to
[1:42:13] you will not hear it being sang most of
[1:42:15] the places most of our services we sing
[1:42:18] that song
[1:42:19] but that song came out of someone
[1:42:20] reflecting on their life
[1:42:23] and not seeing the negative but seeing
[1:42:26] the positive
[1:42:30] I know like process of adoption is is
[1:42:33] not an easy process
[1:42:35] because they're thinking about the child
[1:42:38] is this the right child this is the
[1:42:40] right family to get this child from I
[1:42:42] was not at the Men's breakfast but I
[1:42:43] heard about you know brother
[1:42:45] um Gilbert talking about you know like
[1:42:48] the genealogies and blessings or curses
[1:42:51] that could be passed on from Generations
[1:42:53] and a family trying to adopt a child
[1:42:56] will have all these considerations
[1:42:58] I said what he had to do was to wait on
[1:43:01] the Lord pray for to the Lord and let
[1:43:03] the Lord guide them to which child to
[1:43:07] adopt
[1:43:08] and after they had gone through this
[1:43:09] process
[1:43:12] at the end of it
[1:43:14] she was thinking about the goodness and
[1:43:16] the kindness of God
[1:43:18] and then she decided to write that song
[1:43:20] and that's what it should be for us that
[1:43:23] we look at our lives the way God sees us
[1:43:28] I've read this quote before and I'm just
[1:43:30] closing right now so I told you I was
[1:43:32] going to close early
[1:43:34] how many people are happy about that
[1:43:38] because people look tired and sleepy so
[1:43:41] let's just close and go home and have
[1:43:42] lunch
[1:43:43] right
[1:43:45] no but I wasn't going to stay long with
[1:43:46] you anyway still I read this quote
[1:43:49] before the water of Separation but the
[1:43:50] brand said that you are redeemed because
[1:43:53] he always sees you through Christ
[1:44:01] it's time for us to stop looking at
[1:44:03] ourselves from a human lens
[1:44:06] it's time for us to start looking at
[1:44:08] ourselves
[1:44:10] from the lens of God
[1:44:13] the way God sees us
[1:44:16] it does tremendous things in your life
[1:44:19] when that starts to happen
[1:44:21] because Satan will not be able to lie to
[1:44:23] you anymore
[1:44:25] your things in your life that looks real
[1:44:28] you have a weakness and Satan is
[1:44:29] pointing you to it this is your weakness
[1:44:31] you cannot tell me that you did not do
[1:44:33] this
[1:44:34] but that's not how God sees you
[1:44:37] is simple the one who is
[1:44:42] is scoring the exam right you write a
[1:44:46] paper you write an exam right and the
[1:44:49] teacher said the exam and your colleague
[1:44:52] is telling you your classmate is telling
[1:44:53] you you got that answer wrong
[1:44:55] But the teacher said you got it right
[1:45:02] who's right
[1:45:04] the teacher
[1:45:05] so that's that is what it is here when
[1:45:08] God says we are perfect
[1:45:10] Satan has no say
[1:45:15] and the moment we realize he has no say
[1:45:17] the quicker we'll put him in this
[1:45:19] position and we've heard before where is
[1:45:21] the position of the devil under our feet
[1:45:24] that's where you know I love that I
[1:45:27] can't remember he said very repeated it
[1:45:28] as well if he's not under your feet then
[1:45:31] you are out of your position
[1:45:36] so if you find out that it's not under
[1:45:38] your feet you get in your position and
[1:45:41] automatically you'll find Satan is under
[1:45:43] your faith because that is where he
[1:45:45] belongs
[1:45:48] when the ram said that's the reason we
[1:45:51] can be perfect
[1:45:53] is that not perfect in the sense of
[1:45:55] sinless
[1:45:57] we are perfect in the eyes of God when
[1:46:01] we are in Christ
[1:46:04] so what's the question today am I in
[1:46:06] Christ
[1:46:08] not self-righteousness
[1:46:11] but am I in Christ if I'm in Christ then
[1:46:14] I am sinless
[1:46:16] by his definition I am sinless oh you
[1:46:19] said I still did this thing wrong
[1:46:20] yesterday the question I ask is how did
[1:46:23] you feel when you did that thing wrong
[1:46:26] were you comfortable with it
[1:46:30] maybe this will help the young people
[1:46:34] because this is the lie that Satan told
[1:46:36] me
[1:46:36] I talked about it yesterday
[1:46:39] but when God is giving you the Holy
[1:46:41] Ghost
[1:46:42] you receive it by faith
[1:46:45] now Satan will lie to you that from that
[1:46:48] point on you're supposed to be a hundred
[1:46:50] percent perfect in your flesh
[1:46:55] and that is a lie
[1:46:58] because you've never seen a baby that's
[1:47:00] born that they start to talk on the day
[1:47:02] that they were born
[1:47:03] there is a growth process
[1:47:06] Peter told the young believers he said
[1:47:09] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:47:13] of the word
[1:47:15] when it's time for you to have milk be
[1:47:18] satisfied with milk don't try to eat
[1:47:21] meat it will kill you
[1:47:26] so let our expectations be right
[1:47:28] when God fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:30] is enlisting you into his army brother
[1:47:34] Brahm said that King and land is not the
[1:47:37] Millennium why but the prayer said that
[1:47:39] many times why because there's fighting
[1:47:41] that happens when you cross Jordan which
[1:47:45] is a type of you Crossing to receive the
[1:47:47] Holy Ghost into the promised land you've
[1:47:49] got to fight for every inch of ground
[1:47:53] so when you find yourself doing that bad
[1:47:55] thing again what is the desire in your
[1:47:58] heart that's the question that's the
[1:47:59] proof whether you've got the holy ghost
[1:48:01] or not
[1:48:03] why if you desire
[1:48:07] to still do it again then you need to
[1:48:09] check yourself
[1:48:10] but if when you did it you couldn't wait
[1:48:14] to repent of it
[1:48:16] then ask yourself what is making you
[1:48:18] wanting to repent
[1:48:21] it's a desire in you
[1:48:24] it is the spirit of God in you that is
[1:48:27] telling you this that I've done wrong I
[1:48:29] cannot wait I've got to repent of it
[1:48:31] right now
[1:48:36] so when that happens
[1:48:38] and Satan comes tell Satan that the
[1:48:40] desire to repent is not my desire
[1:48:43] the desire to repent on my sins is the
[1:48:46] desire that God has placed in my heart
[1:48:48] and I know that tomorrow is going to
[1:48:50] give me the strength it's like you're
[1:48:52] climbing a mountain
[1:48:55] there are steps when you climb this step
[1:48:58] you trust that by the grace of God
[1:49:00] you're not going to fall off to to the
[1:49:01] step you've already passed you trust
[1:49:02] that you're going to keep going and
[1:49:04] moving forward
[1:49:06] but Abraham said that's the reason he
[1:49:08] said be ye therefore perfect
[1:49:10] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:49:13] Perfection come by Jesus Christ
[1:49:15] said now I'm not perfecting your sight
[1:49:19] and like brother but I'm talking about
[1:49:20] it here this way because it makes us
[1:49:24] understand that the ram is not talking
[1:49:25] about perfection by works
[1:49:28] he said now I'm not perfect in your
[1:49:31] sights
[1:49:32] you may not be perfect in my sights he
[1:49:35] said but what about in God's side
[1:49:39] that's where it lays and if you're born
[1:49:41] again into the body of Christ then God
[1:49:43] looks upon you as perfect as Christ was
[1:49:47] himself
[1:49:48] nothing you can do it's not by works
[1:49:53] that you can do at all it's by grace
[1:49:56] God has given you this offer and if
[1:49:59] you've accepted it in the sight of God
[1:50:01] you are perfect God gives you the offer
[1:50:05] if you accept it in the sight of God you
[1:50:09] are perfect
[1:50:12] you are redeemed you're washed in the
[1:50:15] blood of the Lamb
[1:50:16] but the man said you are without fault
[1:50:19] without blemish
[1:50:21] you are without spots
[1:50:25] I'll call the musicians now
[1:50:27] but that's how Christ wants us to see
[1:50:29] ourselves
[1:50:33] is responsible for us
[1:50:36] The Plan of Salvation
[1:50:38] was completed before the foundation of
[1:50:41] the world
[1:50:43] it was done it was closed
[1:50:47] it was sealed for a while
[1:50:50] we are living in the day and age where
[1:50:53] this plan has been fully unveiled
[1:50:56] revealed to us the seals have been
[1:50:58] broken why were they broken so that we
[1:51:01] can know the mind of God Amos told us he
[1:51:04] said the secret things of God belong to
[1:51:07] God but the things that God will choose
[1:51:09] to reveal they belong to us and our
[1:51:13] children
[1:51:15] so if the sales has been revealed
[1:51:17] my question
[1:51:20] is what is that to you
[1:51:23] what has that told you
[1:51:25] have you found your name in the book
[1:51:28] have you seen your life in that Plan of
[1:51:30] Redemption
[1:51:32] that God did not just bring you here for
[1:51:34] fun
[1:51:35] that God is ordering your footsteps
[1:51:39] according to his perfect Plan before the
[1:51:42] foundation of the world
[1:51:46] and it's going to bring it to pass
[1:51:49] you believe that this morning
[1:51:51] believe that this morning
[1:51:53] are we feeling cold
[1:51:55] looks like the weather is it snowing
[1:51:57] outside yet
[1:51:59] all right let's be on our feet this
[1:52:00] morning
[1:52:01] spend some time to Worship the Lord this
[1:52:03] morning
[1:52:08] let's sing that song Maybe the goodness
[1:52:10] of God
[1:52:13] just express your appreciation to him
[1:52:16] just before I turn it over to the pastor
[1:52:20] God's Plan of Redemption
[1:52:25] he decided to have you I look at myself
[1:52:27] small me
[1:52:30] God had me and this plan before the
[1:52:33] foundation of the world
[1:52:36] and is expressing that today
[1:52:40] what do I have to fear
[1:52:43] why should I even get depressed
[1:52:46] why should I have any worry
[1:52:48] if he is responsible for me
[1:52:58] I love you Lord
[1:53:03] for your mercy never fails me
[1:53:09] all my days

[1:56:28] as the musicians keep playing I just
[1:56:30] felt like to read this to you again
[1:56:33] Paul says I'm persuaded
[1:56:37] well each and every one of us has got to
[1:56:39] be persuaded ourselves
[1:56:41] that need a death nor life
[1:56:45] nor angels
[1:56:47] principalities
[1:56:49] no powers
[1:56:50] no things present no things to come
[1:56:53] nor a height nor death nor any other
[1:56:58] creature
[1:56:59] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:57:01] love of God
[1:57:03] which is in Christ Jesus
[1:57:05] whatever you've encountered in your life
[1:57:08] whatever you will encounter
[1:57:12] never ever get to a point
[1:57:15] where you think that God doesn't love
[1:57:17] you
[1:57:19] nothing can separate you from his love
[1:57:22] nothing can make him to stop loving you
[1:57:26] if he loses you you will have lost a
[1:57:29] part of himself
[1:57:31] and God cannot lose a part of himself
[1:57:34] you are so precious to him
[1:57:37] you're more precious than gold stride in
[1:57:40] the fire
[1:57:41] he allows those trials to come your way
[1:57:45] not because
[1:57:46] he's displeased with you
[1:57:49] but because he wants to achieve
[1:57:51] something
[1:57:53] that will bring glory to his name
[1:57:56] and will bring you benefits as well
[1:58:02] a single song Amazing Grace my chains
