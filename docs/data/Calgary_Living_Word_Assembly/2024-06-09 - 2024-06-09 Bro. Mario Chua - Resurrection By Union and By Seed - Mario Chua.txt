heart Lord God because it is your will Lord to speak to your may you just bless stify our ears our heart Lord our mind that you may have the Lord this morning and also Lord hide me in your pres Lord we only see you and glorify your name this morning we ask it in Jesus Christ name can you take a seat for just a moment and uh thank you once again for welcoming us uh in the church Brother P God bless you and I always have a high regard and respect for person uh especially a pastor it's really a hard uh office to be a burden Bearer I was once a pastor for 5 years and I realized that it is it was not my calling because I don't have patience and Temperance to be so I just respect the person who would take those responsibility and also the associate ministers who is backing him up and make the church go and continue the journey till Jesus come and thank you very much for welcoming us I just feel welcoming spirit and just feel at EAS and so welcome it's been a long while Hallelujah brother Ken I miss him so he was the first uh invited us in 2016 and I've been here two times already and also meet brother mvin during that time tremendous Str brother family brother their Hospitality are more just physical we have just more physical relationship it's more than that amen and we know our real brother and sister those who love the Lord Jesus Christ even they ask the Lord Jesus Christ who is my mother who is my brother the one who loves me they mother brother we are the real brothers and sisters so thank you so much and I bring greetings from brother Ron and to those who know him he send that send our greetings and love to them so God bless you all I cannot mention the names uh as my hair grow uh turn white I become you know always not upgraded so so I will borrow the the words of brother bam and just take me for what I mean and not for what I say amen because as our hair turn white sometimes our thought is different than what we say so just forgive me for that amen so we bring greetings also from uh some of the brothers who knows here and they spend their greetings and we were just uh surprised then when we leave Phoenix it's 114° and when we came with 40 or something like that I thought it was summer but it's still winter oh praise the Lord at least we enjoy we still enjoy the winter amen so praise the Lord so the most important things we will go to the word of God I'm not really good in uh preliminaries so we'll just go directly to the word of God uh can I invite you to stand and I have two portion of scripture uh the Deuteronomy chapter 25 thank you musicians God bless you Deuteronomy 25 verse 5-6 then 1 Corinthians 15 verse 21 to 22 are you glad to be a Christian this morning am amen so brother brandham said that to be a Christian it was not your desire to be a Christian it was God's desire for you to be a Christian because he said no one can comes to me except the father draws him near so and then brother Braham said that God put in your heart to be hunger and thirst it's your heavenly father trying to reveal to you something amen so praise the Lord Deuteronomy CH 25: 5-6 says that if Brethren dwell together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the Dead shall not marry without unto a stranger her husband's brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her and it shall be that the first born which she Barett shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not put out of Israel so if the first husband of the woman dies then the nearest Kinsman of her husband is to bring resurrection of the name and family of his Dead Brother by marriage and by seed because marriage and seed is what brings forth a family men and a race of people and a nation so 1 Corinthians 15 verse 21-22 for since by men Came Death by men also came the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all dying even so in Christ shall all be made alive amen let's borrow once again Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God this morning that you give us the privilege to gather together to Worship You Lord and uh we ask you Lord special blessings to the word that we read Lord you can read it and turn the pages but it take your Holy Spirit Lord to reveal something over this word Lord so we ask you to come Lord speak to us in Jesus Christ's name amen so you may be seated so my title this morning is resurrection by Union and by seed amen and we know that seeds are very powerful thing they come in many different forms and without seed there is no continuation of Life sin is what continues life and resurrects life because when a man when a plant dies it has a resurrection by the seed that is in itself because there is always a power of transformation within the seed as the word of God said let every seed bring forth of its kind amen so there's power of transformation within the seed so anything that is not living by the word is not truly living because life can only exist by the word of God Amen so just like uh Timothy he said that in Timothy 56 he said but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while he is living amen so without the seed of God even though you are alive in the sight of God you are just dead amen so because the word of God they are spirit and they are Life John 63 said it is the spirit that Quicken it but the flesh profet nothing but the word that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so without the word of God we cannot live good life amen may we may live in pleasure but in the sight of God we are already dead it only takes the word of God because in Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth of its kind the grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so so the seed is a light carrier and without seed there is no life and no Resurrection what a very important thing that we need to recognize about the seed of God because even brother Bram made mention in the message super sign he said that he said that denominational churches are just just sitting on Buns of Breen eggs because they have refused to unite with Christ right and receive the word of SE this hour that God sent through this channel of the seventh angel super sign paragraph 36 that's the way with our organized religion until they come in contact with the mate Christ Jesus there a bunch of BR and eggs right the whole thing need to be thr out of the nest they'll never hat the best thing to do is clean out the nest start all over again get the maid Christ Jesus so an egg without the mate cannot be fertilized cannot hatch so they need a mate in order to H or be fertilize so before there can have a resurrection of New Life there must be a first a union and Seed combination amen so Resurrection is not just an event Resurrection is a person in John 11 verse 21 it's speaking about Martha about Lazarus when Lazarus died and Martha uh heard that Jesus was coming so he approached Jesus Christ immediately because she heard that Jesus was coming so in verse 11 then said Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died sounds like he's blaming Jesus Christ indirectly for the death of his brother because she believed that if he come his brother could live so indirectly it sounds like he was blaming Jesus Christ then said Martha Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died but in verse 22 but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it unto thee she believeth she have faith in Jesus Christ although he didn't come when she was called but now that he was in the present tense she believed that whatever he said will come to pass then Jesus said thy brother shall arise again amen what a great consolation but he misinterpreted because looking at the resurrection as an event he said Jesus and Jesus said un thy brother shall rise again then Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so he was looking at an event of Resurrection at the last days but Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live so Resurrection is not only an event but Resurrection is a person of Jesus Christ you cannot be there in the event of the Resurrection until you know the person of the Resurrection so to be in the resurrection you need to know the person of the Resurrection Hallelujah because the resurrection is the present tense he was always in the present tense we need to know the resurrection amen now that we spiritually speaking we are already resurrected because he said and the and I am the res resurrection of the life he that believeth in me yes though he were dead yet shall he live do you believe do you believe the Lord Jesus CHR is here amen we can never be here together without the grace of God in our lives so we are the testimony of his resurrection amen it was not an event but it was the resurrection of Jesus Christ we are born into a new life so our life now is a testimony that his word is the truth amen Christ is the word and he's the only one that can carish the Original Seed of the original life he is the life Bearer so in the Garden of Eden death come by Adam raised by a false Union and hybrid seed do you believe it that came by hybriding the seed of the word of God so therefore Resurrection can only return to Adam Race by a true Union with Christ and by receiving the Original Seed of the original life again amen it takes the original word amen to resurrect us again amen oh what a blessed name amen amen amen So Adam lost fellowship with God Amen when they received the hybrid seed they lost Fellowship amen they lost eternal life praise be to God but God is restoring us what Adam lost amen during the time just God just came down in the cool of the day and have fellowship with Adam every time God open his word to Adam Adam just say Amen Lord another word open amen Lord another word open amen Lord he don't misinterpret the word he don't mislocate the word and he need he didn't need to Mis interpret the word of God he just say Amen to every word of God Amen Hallelujah he don't reason it out praise God he just believe it and as a real believer of the word of God we just say Amen to every word of God if we cannot understand we just pray to God lord open my high understanding Lord hallelujah don't let me interpret your word don't let me reason out your word praise God I just believe it Lord yes amen just open my eyes of understanding amen and every time the evening evening comes he was already waiting for God 30 minutes before yeah the service come amen he was already always on time right he was is always hungering for Fellowship amen amen if that fa spirit before the PO came is here it will be the same effect we'll be in the church for 30 minutes and we don't want to be late because we want Fellowship amen hallelujah hallelujah we want to have fellowship with God hallelujah so we just humble our that's why God put a hunger and thirst in our heart because he wants to reveal to you something the hidden Mystery before the foundation of the word he wants to try to reveal it to each and every one of us he lost Fellowship he lost eternal life praise God during that time before the fall he has no problem he has no hurache he has no trouble he has no jealousy so everything he just go to day he just enjoy it and God is trying to restore us back to that condition he has fellowship with all the animals he has control amen he can just say to the to to whatever let lion let us pray elephant he can command every has Dominion all over the Earth we can see even in our present day we can see a lot of uh uh short video clip how people train a small animals even the the Tiger The Lion then the lion grows up and they can still play it's just a glimpse of the Millennium during the time amen although we are in the Fallen state but still the word of God has commissioned that you have dominion you have rule over all the Earth and I believe God is is beginning to restore us back to that amen so that's why sometimes some of us we love pets because there is always a connection right some likes do some likes cat some likes crocodile whatever you can see it all in a short video clip when you open the vide some have pons for their pet some spiders whatsoever because it was already a spirit that gave us a dominion and one of days in the Millennium you can read in Isaiah 11 that even the lamp are playing with the lion but now it not happen but there will it will be happening soon so let us go back to our uh scripture reading if the first husband of woman dies then the newest kmas is to bring a resurrection of the name of the family of his dead brother let me just help me in the Pulpit amen I'm a little bit nervous hallelujah thank you Lord being in the Pulpit is so sacred and it is not just a one way amen right uh a minister is just like a just like a a speaker it's a it's a two-way that's right right you need to help the minister amen that's as a minister we are just like a waiter that's right if you order we will serve but if you will not order there we just wait that's sometimes uh it's keeping our torque dry so we need to you need to order so that I can deliver amen so it's not a one way it's a two way uh just uh when I read the scripture if I I'm stammering my lip just nud your head it will help me right don't look at me as if I'm a stranger because I become nervous yeah help me just n your head and smile a little bit it will be okay amen cuz I remember the that uh Angels um they don't really Rejoice just like uh with us being Sinners saved by grace yeah that's right we can appreciate the grace of God in our lives amen so even our nodding of our head and saying amen could not give Justice to what God has given us by his grace that come into our life we are nothing so the grace of God Is A Mir UNM merited favor best upon so even though we say n amen it will not give Justice right amen hallelujah so Angels don't really cannot relate to what we experience being a sinner saved by grace so we need to practice it amen we are not forcing you to say Amen but we are encouraging you to say amen amen right because being grateful Hallelujah God will always dwells in the Praises of his people Angels don't know how to praise or or or cannot relate to what that's right we receive being a senior Sav by Grace because they were sent as a messenger sent as a protector so every time you worship they are just sitting and looking at you what are they saying what are they rejoicing but sometimes if we don't know how to worship God to praise him we look like Angels amen so we need to say Amen we need to practice it we are in the house of God I we are not somewhere else or you don't need to asham to worship God to clap him and to praise him because that is our only only obligation is to give back our Praises unto him don't be ashamed to say amen and be asham to smile amen thank you for your smile you're are a beautiful smile amen so let us uh back to Exodus 32:10 now therefore let me alone that my rod may walk hot against them that I may consume them and I will make of the a great nation God in this Ro is going to wipe out the Jewish race and resurrect the race against Moses seed a resurrection by seed and this is the principle of the Bible now Adam was like the first husband that died that brought a separation amen and death to his entire human race Offspring but then Christ the second Adam amen by Redemption brought a resurrection to Adam's Fallen race again by Redemption and by Union and by seed so we can see the pattern type throughout the entire stories of the Bible if there is a pattern we cannot change all the pattern because God is the same yesterday today and forever amen he leave us a pattern that if we can see all the pattern God is doing the same we may have different ages different time different day but the pattern of how he moves is still the same so we have the Assurance if we can see it in the scripture we have the assurance that God is in his word in the book of Bruth the in in Lim when he died boas brings a resurrection and Restorations to the family and lineage of imik by uniting with Ruth praise God in marriage Union and by giving her sin just like in 1st Samuel 29 we see that nabal Abigail's first husband died and when he was United in marriage with David during the time of his Exile before he was King over Israel Abigail had two son the first son was called KB which means like his father just like Tamar reive seed after his husband died amen we know that Tamer praise God married the first son of Judah and that died and he promised to give s but they don't give seed to to Tamer because Judah thought that maybe T was a everything dies when have contact with him so he didn't give his younger son but Tamer the only thing that God will bless him he need to have a seat that's right so he he changed his garment her garment to a garment just like a harlot that's where he get the seed from Judah and Judah said K was more righteous than him because he was trying to hide it amen through the seed so all the stories in the Bible are revealing something to us about this Great Harvest Time and Resurrection time that we are now living because the marriage of the Lamb to his bride is now come Revelation 19:6 Thou come not coming but already come in fact it was already marriaged because the bride the wife had made herself ready so she was not a bride but she was already a wife the wife is already making herself ready are you ready tonight morning Hallelujah so we know that Christ the second Adam has bring about a resurrection of this hour of the Bride of seven Church ages because of but people in this day that have come into a union with him and that have received the fullness of the seed of his original word again so how does the resurrection take place in this hour by marriage Union and by the Original Seed of the word of God being restored to us in its fullness the word of God is being restored to us in this last days amen amen it is the life and the voice of the seed of the revealed word that is calling our names in this hour that is what will produce resurrection of this hour our name is being called by the revealing of the mystery that was sent in our day that's how God called our name in the L of life amen by the mystery that is being revealed in these last days so the full word is being restored as back back again amen we are not only Justified we are Sanctified we are baptized with the Holy Ghost now it's the person of Jesus Christ himself that's why when you receive the Holy Ghost you become God's coworker Hallelujah you are not just a worker right if you are just a worker you have a boss right but you don't have a boss you are a coworker of God Amen because it was God working through you you become his mouthpiece you become his eyes you become his feet praise God God is continually using each and every member of his body to be his coworker in this last days each and every one of us has a Ministry amen not only the people person in the Pulpit but even in your home in your offices in your school we have a Ministry of our own because thou must prophesy again we are not commanded to evangelize again we are commanded to prophesy again and to prophesy means you you need to share hallelujah what was amen what is and what is to come God don't know about the original sin but we need a minist a a prophetic Ministry to tell them what was happening in the beginning what he was doing today and what he will going tomorrow hallelujah praise the Lord so let us go back in the Book of Ruth chapter 4 vers verse 2 and 5 and he took 10 men of the Elders of the city and said sit down here and they sat down so the setting of Ruth chapter 2 is just like the setting of Revelation chapter 5 one sitting in the throne with all the elders beside him and he said unto the Kingman Nomi that is come uh come again out of the country of Moab said that a parcel of land which was our brother's IMX and I thought to advertise this saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the Elders of the people if thou wi redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee and he said I will redeem it so so it was going to cause him to rain back eliminate lost and that was going to spoil his own wealth because the son of Bruth would go on to inherit it for amik El's family's name then said boas what day thou buyest the field of the hand of Nomi thou must buy it also of Ruth the moabites and the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance and we know that boas was a type of Christ who was prepared to have his own inheritance marred in order to bring a resurrection to Adam's race and the kingsman said I cannot redeem it for myself l i Mar my own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot redeem it so so Satan sometimes trying to to own us but he will not redeem us right amen he will just leave us in limbo he cannot continue on if be given a chance to give the Redemption he will not redeem it he will just temp us he will give us trial and testing all of that but he will not save us that's right and Satan was given permission to Temp that's right just like when the Lord Jesus Christ was baptized by John the Baptist in georia River and there was a light coming down just like adab and the boy said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell there was an identification so Satan immediately knows who Jesus was right that's why he went and temp him if thou be the Son of God because he already heard the voice this is my beloved Son in whom I'm dwell please Satan will not tempt you if you are not Sons and Daughters of God he knows you are Sons and Daughters of God that's why he than you if thou be the Son of God turn this water into turn this turn this if thou be the Son of God if thou be the son so every trial that comes your way Satan knows that you are Sons and Daughters of God you will not give in so that's why if thou be the Son of God command this Stone to turn into bread amen he didn't say he didn't just say turn this Stone into bread he command because he knows he's talking to a commander in you right he command the stone turn into bread he knows that Jesus Christ was the bread of life amen so Satan knows each and every one of us that's why when Temptations and Trials Come amen God and Satan is behind it yes it's included in our package remember that Jesus Christ he said that I am the Alpha and the Omega I am the beginning and I am the ending whatever he start he will finish it at the End Amen so in between there is always a blank right whatever Tri you're in let us fill in the blank but at the end he's already done it amen he already overcome it so to be part in the First rection in this day that we are living in you must first come into Union with Christ and receive the word of the revelation of the original word of God in our day amen you cannot be in the Resurrection unless you receive the seed of the the word of God just like in the uh the scripture Mark 4:3 heren behold there went out a s to sa and we know that a s s seed in the field and we know that the field is the woman and that's why it takes a man and a woman to bring forth a new body because a man has seed and a woman has a field and so these two combines together is what produces the new body amen and that is why in this age for us to change from Mortal to immortality and to put on a new body we need these two things to come together again an original seed and a field and we are the field of the word of God in each say they had a portion of Original Seed but in the last day it must be the entire seed that comes together again in Union with the people at church in order to produce the literal resurrection of 2,000 years of sleeping Saints in this hour they need us to be completed amen so without us they can never be resurrected they are waiting for us and they are looking for us amen and maybe they are just like the o just go on brother go on Amen keep moving on brother whatever PR you are in is not compared to us we we we sacrifice Our Lives to a lion being eaten by a lion being swn as Su Hallelujah we don't experience that kind of Trials but our greatest battle is in our mind amen we need to move on as Paul said let us run the race amen because as we run he is running with us into the Finish Line he will never leave us nor forsake us whatever trials your are in he with he is behind it so praise God it takes the resurrection it takes a seed right to be in the resurrection in Genesis 4:25 it says and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God said she had appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew Seth was a type of Christ Resurrection amen so in the message infallible proof of Resurrection paragraph 25 and brother Bram said then when he slew Abel he thought he got it right y because he destroyed the only righteous part of the SE then God raised up set to take his place a beautiful type of death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ so Isaac was also one received from the dead because he came by the Seed of Abraham and notice in the beginning death came by a false Union of a wrong seed that was received into the womb of a woman the first Eve so therefore life can only come back again by the right Union and the right seed of the original word of God back in the womb of a woman again so if the false Union and false took us out of Eden then it must take a union with Christ in this hour that the pregnation of the Original Seed again to put us back in Eden again Hallelujah and that is what the promise of this age and that is what is going on right now under the seven seal mystery of God is restoring us back the Original Seed of God so the entire Bible is the story of redemption amen and in our opening script reading we see that the Lord that if the first husband died and that was a type of Adam then there is to be a marriage to the nearest brother nearest Kinsman and who is in our Cas was Christ the second Adam and by his seed the seed of his revelation of the word he brings life and restoration back again Hallelujah in the message there's only one way Pro provided by God for anything and that is by the revelations of God so every sermon of brother bam is just not only a title a good title for his sermon but every title of the Prophet is a declaration amen because as a priest we are called priest and King a priest always represent the people to God yes while a prophet represent God to his people so every sermon titled sermon is a declaration just like when he say he is here there is a man that can turn on the light amen the almighty God unveil before us amen that is all a declaration not only a titled sermon but it was a declaration because the prophet represent God to the people amen so this is there is only one way provided by God for anything paragraph 6 7 he said and God promised the church a scriptural sign and he said the resurrection would be reproduced amen Jesus Christ and his church would become so they would be one take notice that God promised this church C Small seed a scriptural signed but he said and the resurrection would be reproduced Jesus Christ and his Capital C church so there is a distinction between small C church and capital c Church Capital C he was identifying that he has a true church and a church mean elesia which means the called out one we are being called out in this evil age in this last days not only we are called but we are chosen we are elected we are predestinated we are separated Hallelujah we are Justified we are Sanctified and we are ready glorified Hallelujah his church would become so they would be one in the last days amen thank you Lord are we living in the last days Hallelujah Jesus Christ and his church would be become so they would be one in the last days of mared union he promised it not now we know that it is true because he came down [Music] himself now he also promised that there would be a restoring of the faith we read over in Judah he said earnestly content for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints amen now we are promised in Malachi 4 by the same system he always did that he would be restored back to original faith and remember brother brandham said that the prophet came to fulfill Malachi 4 to restore the heart back of the children to the father and Revelation 107 is to reveal the secret of the seven seal because when the Revelation chapter 10 when the mighty angel came down and the Prophet identified that Mighty Angel was the Lord Jesus Christ spirit for coming down with an open book in his hand right hand amen which is the hand of Authority open book while in Revelation 5 it was a closed book right but now in Revelation 10 it was already an open book and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices and J was about to write and he heard the voice stop it it was prepared for the seventh angel to reveal what was in the seventh he can do two things turn the heart of the children and reveal the mystery of the seven tender amen so we are not it takes only the revelation of the word of God that will give us rapturing Faith denomination preaching so nothing's against that there are a lot of good sermons when about the denominational preachers nothing against that because some of the denominational preachers are sometimes good preacher compared to us in the message of the hour good grammars good sentences good ination all that and sometimes it can help people right better to become a better Christian in their Community right good standing good status in their Community right and sometimes it can help them feel the the presence of God and sometime they can cry they can worship they can testify of the goodness of God in their heart but the only thing that denomination can give us is the rupturing Faith because rupturing Faith only lays in the revelations of the word of God Amen so that's why outside of the revealed word of the hour we cannot receive the rupturing Faith because rupturing faith is the revelation of God personally to each and every one of us it was not given to anybody but it was given to a special class of people remember when Jesus Christ was resurrected they be the disciples are following Jesus Christ for how many years three and a half years in his ministry he saw they they saw all the Miracles the healings and all all the blessings but when he was crucified and he was resurrected and he presented himself to the disciples they don't even know know him they were so blank because dispensation changed he was no longer about his personal appearance he he was not dealing with the the physical flesh anymore right he came back to the logos again and he was trying to reveal the mystery of his will he's trying to reveal the mystery to his disciple that the the ministry changed he was trying he was not trying to point them to his physical fles he was trying to to point them back to the scripture that must be fulfilled in their age so that's why when he walked with the disciples to the nas what happened to you we we all know the stories and he told them oh you men of little faith D you know so he started opening the scripture beginning Moses true and the scripture said he opened the scripture beginning at Moses and to his time revealing himself revealing the scripture concerning himself so he's pointing back back pointing them back to the word that must be fulfilled in their age that's why in this last days this message is not for everybody it is only for his disciple remember that when he resurrected he didn't appear to the pareses the sagues the great denominational teachers of the day he did he he didn't show himself to to to Nazareth dist in Galilee where he was born right he didn't go to the to the place where he performed a lot of Miracles he didn't show himself to the public anymore but he only show himself to the disciple he shows to Mary all the disciples he show to to to everybody he was not long he was not longer revealing himself publicly but even the disciples Martha and Mary they went first into the tomb and they recognize that Jesus was not there and Jesus appeared to them and revealed himself right amen and they were so excited to share their experience that they saw Jesus Christ and they share it to their to the disciple to Thomas to Peter but did anybody believe it one another testimonies no it takes Jesus Christ himself to reveal himself to each and everyone that like brother Braham said New Birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally yes sir it is not by anybody's testimony anybody no it must be Christ himself personally revealing to you and that is by the opening of the word it takes himself to reveal to you this great deep mystery that's why he said why are you hungry in church why you're thirst is your heavenly father trying to reveal to you something and what is is something your part in his program of God so being the bride we are a part of God's program we need to recognize who we are or else we can never be restored how can you be restored when you don't know who you are that's why restoration back to the original is to know you are in the originally so that you can recognize to be go back in that direction so remember we need to recognize who we are yes if we don't recognize Who We Are that's why the prophet has the Declaration you need to recognize your day and your message it was not just only A good sermon that we can go okay but you take it personally because a prophet represent God directly to you just like Elijah was sent directly to you not to anybody else not to us or to somewhere else but Elijah was sent to you Hallelujah and that you you need to take get personal my heart was turned because I am part of that amen amen that's why when the Revelation seal was open Revelation 10 and the Seven ther Ed the voices and John I don't know where he get his [Music] pen but he was about to write what he heard don't write it John and sometimes maybe we don't know maybe when he was about to be thrown you know when you are in the death row they they always ask you what is your last request so maybe J requested can I have a pen amen hallelujah so that I will leave my testimonies in case no I will not make it I can leave my testimony for somebody else that God is good amen I was beaten by scorpion I was beaten by venomous snake but I'm still alive fulfilling Mark 16 right that was maybe his thought but God in the book of Isiah said my thought are higher than your thoughts and my ways are higher than your ways he never thought about this book of Revelation he just as a pen maybe I can write my testimony here but God is so gracious right he has a higher ways he thought is high so that's why he gave him the Revelation Hallelujah of Jesus Christ so that every time he saw a vision he just wrote it wrote it so that's why we are privileged as John said blessed are they that read and hear the word of the testimony not the testimony of John but testimony of Jesus Christ because the Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ not the experience of J while he was in the P so he was given the vision and he wrote everything until he come to Revelation chapter 10 when the seven Thunders uttered their voices he was so excited oh it's a thing I can write it but when the seven Thunders UT voice John don't write it I don't know if he that he was disappointed or not maybe he has a question in his mind why is so important that God will not allow me to write this Thunders everything I wrote it in except this certain portion of scripture don't write it John seal it it was the The Mystery of the seventh th Earth is given to the seventh angel of Revelation chapter 10 in the days of the voice of his seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God Reve it the holy spirit that forbid John to write is the same holy spirit that tell brother Braham pick up your pet and write in the P message he said one night I was seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write the same holy spirit that tell God don't write it God but here the same Holy Spirit tell the prophet pick up your pen and write while he seeking the Lord so that's important to seek the Lord we just don't come here and just listen to whoever Minister we need to read and listen to the scripture amen and sometimes we cannot understand what the the minister is saying because we are not reading amen when you read you can understand oh I know I read about it oh this is what it mean but if you are not reading true you will just stare the minister in blank face because you are not willing so you need to listen to the word of God if you cannot understand I believe the minister was sent to let you understand what you are reading amen just like when you go to school do you have textbook and sometimes you cannot even understand what you're reading until you're teacher came and teach what you are reading then you understand just like the message of the hour is so important that's why bless are they that hear and a lot of people cannot hear anymore so God is gracious you can still read amen God is so gracious you have no reason anymore because this message is directly addressed to each and every one of us thank your p and write and I grabs the pen and write Hallelujah so if it if the holy spirit is leading you don't hesitate to move according to what God is leading you amen his Spirit gave me a message to the church so this message is directly to the church yes amen I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride so that's why this letter this message is a love letter to each and every one of us this is so personal the Holy Spirit told Brother pick up the pen and write and he said his Spirit gave me a message for the church and I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bright Hallelujah here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction that each spe bring forth after it own kind even according to Genesis 1 verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed and the fruit yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself so the fruit is already in the seed amen and the fruit yielding fruit after his kind who seed in itself upon the Earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into plant and dance into the fruit he said the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed bring forth of its kind remember in the Book of Genesis 1 verse1 it said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth so if they say there is no God they are foolish because in the beginning God created the Heaven Earth period you cannot argue with it everything that we see around it testify that there was God it was not an evolution but it was God and we have the Bible the absolute word of God that declares that everything that we see around us it was God who created them and when God created the heavens and the Earth it was perfect amen amen but in verse two and there was void and darkness upon the Earth there was another sermon in verse two and verse one because God is not the author of darkness and confusion and Chaos God is righteous and he was perfect when he created heaven and earth it was perfect everything is harmony right but in verse two something happened that it became chaos and become dark and verse three and God begin to restore let there be life light and there was life let there be life let there be let there be let there be and it was so and it was good yes but when it came to verse 11 it didn't say Let There Be seed it says let every seed bring forth of its kind so the Earth even though in chaos and darkness the seed was already in that condition just like we yes when we are born into this world we are in darkness confusion we don't know anything about we don't know about God we don't know anything about it but when the prophet said when he preached God the mystery of God revealed he said when you are still a little baby the seat of God was already in you you may be in some confusion then you jump from one Church to another trying to find that thirst and thirsting your heart you can understand but there is something bubbling something moving that you cannot understand praise God that one day Hallelujah the gospel of the word of God was preached and the seed was quickened whatever seed you are in it will bring it to life there is a power of transformation he didn't say Let There Be seed he said let every seed bring forth of its kind Hallelujah if you are the seed of God in this last day then the Gospel Life will Quicken the seed and whatever seed you are in you will become that sin if you are a son of God you will manifest God whether you like it or not whether you want to run away from it you will manifest it because we have the word of God s in US last day to Quicken the sea let every SE bring forth be if you are son of the of God you will manifest God and what is got the word of God [Applause] don't worry about your fruit we don't struggle to manifest the fruit oh I need to have faith I need to have patience I need to have brotherly kindness and I fail then I go back together that is law but the word of God let every SE bring forth to be kind the fruit which is in the seed amen will take and with time and season for that seed to manifest because the fruit is already in that seed just like the Sheep cannot produce or manufacture the W the Sheep always manifest of the world is just naturally because that it was a part of his makeup that's like you as Sons and Daughters of God you don't struggle to have patience don't struggle to have faith don't struggle to have brotherly kindness let the word of God lay the presence of the son the resurrection son that will take the greenness away from you and it will manifest in his time and his season we are not legalist don't do this don't do that don't know Hallelujah the message is Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Hallelujah [Applause] we don't limit the grace of God our thought is limited our ways are limited our judgment are limited but the grace of God is unlimited thank you Lord that's why when you go to the Philippines we have a lot of fast food that offers unlimited rice that's why the business is booming because rice is one of our stable stable food when you say unlimited rice everybody goes there we will go to this place because it's unlimited we have unlimited promise of God hallelujah Psalms 103 I am the Lord God that Health all th and do not forget this B ofit do not forget the bit of how God praise God gave himself for you he didn't gave himself for anybody else just for you if you are in trouble remember that he said it is that it is minut it it is already done deal whatever situation you are in right now just believe ask anything he said ask anything in my name he didn't say and brother Barry will do it and brother mbin will do it and any Minister will do it he said if you ask anything in my name I personal will do it do you believe it Hallelujah if you are a message believer you need to believe [Applause] [Music] it and don't be discouraged when you ask I say he didn't manifest in my life but God promised he will do it but why did it didn't happen don't make God a I amen amen when you ask we want answer in our own way Lord answer according to our understanding but when God say he will do it he didn't say I will do it immediately because sometimes God answer yes and sometime he answer no right and he sometime he answer wait right Abraham when God gave him the promise Abraham waited 25 years but the scripture said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong Hallelujah because he sinth faithful the one who made a promise when God made a promise he is obligated to fulfill it amen we are not obligated to fulfill it brother Braham is not obligated to fulfill what God's PR but it was God himself will do it Noah waited 120 years but did God do it yes he did just don't ask God that Lord let me win a lot of with but God is not the prophet is not legalist oh it's sin no he don't want to say that he just check your motives and objectives if you are a Christian are you asking to win a lot brother bam said it is a sin he he didn't say it is a sin but they said check your motive and your object there because if you are a Christian you are seeking more on the revelation of the word of God because he said seeking first the kingdom of God and all these things whatever things that you need it will be added according to your faith amen so we need to seek first the kingdom of God Amen sometimes we struggle on that Avenue because we don't even give our tithes and offering that's why we always look why I am so poor why am I'm not blessed because you are not fulfilling God's promise he said try me he challenged you try me if I will not pour out the blessing and you have no room praise God to fulfill it that's the secret not the lottery ticket right now the very same law applies to the church today yes amen so we have a presentent message whatever seed you are in praise God you need to recognize it because if you cannot recognize it you will never be restored back amen because this is the message of restoration and only those who are part of the program of God will be restored just like Redemption is bringing back to your original own the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed and in this last day the true bride church with the parenthesis is Christ SE so here is your identification the true church is Christy are you Christy this morning don't be ashamed to claim I am it because God is trying to reveal to you who you are Hallelujah you need to claim it you need to profess it I am the thank you Lord hallelujah the more you are grateful for the things that God is doing for your life the more God will reveal himself to you more and more don't hesitate to claim Who You Are in this last day you need to identify yourself I am the Son of God I am not Hallelujah I am not just anybody I am a Son of God although I have so many failure but God don't count your failure he's looking at the SE in N SE there is nothing to Quicken but if you are the SE of God then you can be reor because in N SE there is nothing to be quickened but if you are the seed of God hallelujah God is obligated yes amen to Quicken that sin so in this last day do don't look at your shortcomings sometimes we don't enjoy the blessings of God because we keep on looking out our mistakes we keep looking at our failures but the message of the hour just recognize who you are not your failure just like Gideon when they they commit sin unto the Lord they were given to the to their enemies so that's why they are always hiding in hiding so that's why when you commit sin to the Lord you you you you refrain yourself from fellowship from from going to church because you are hiding for something remember that God is so gracious when the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon I want you to deliver your people right yes the Gideon began to look at himself yes his failure they were poor always hiding from the enemy but the angel of the Lord said I want you to deliver the people he heard the word of God but he looks at his failure maybe you're mistaken Lord for somebody else because you see I am the poorest of all the poor but the angel of the Lord said you are a man of follow yeah amen he did the the message of the hour didn't point to your shortcomings but your representation Thou Art the man of our and the Propet said in this last day thou are a super race of people you are special of people you are super race of people you are not just an ordinary people you are not just an ordinary church member you are the Church of the Living God don't look at your shortcoming look at the promise of God pertains to yourself you you are the Son of God and you need to stay Lord I know I have so many shortcomings but I need you Lord I only believe that I am Sons and Daughters of God because I will never walk with you this far true if not by the grace of God because his promis so through I will never leave you in the midst of your trial in the midst of your persecution in in the midst of your distress I will never leave you and I will never even forsake you but I will be with you not only with you but I will be in you walking through you Hallelujah so that's why the promise is here continue praise God feeding yourself with the word of God because lay in the presence of God where can you lay in the presence to the preaching of the word you need to hear every word every time you hear the word hallelujah it will give you something amen thank amen Jacob was a supplanter and a deceiver as the prophet said Jacob was a Shyer a mama's boy right he deceived his dad but Esau was a strong man when we look at physically we will vote for Esau he was a hunter he was a strong man man he was a responsible man he L his father but Jacob he was as yers a boy a skinny boy but the time has come that God is going to reveal to him who he was am that's why he wrestled with the angel of the Lord and when the angel of the Lord is trying to reveal who he was he keep on struggling I am supplanter I am deceiver I have done nothing good in my life but the angel is trying to reveal to him something you are not a sulter Jacob you are not a deceiver Jacob you are not a mous boy but you are a prince of God Jacob you need to recognize who you are you are a prince of God hallelujah so don't look at yourself because the time has come that God is going to reveal to you who you are don't look at mistake but your representation in Christ that's why the angel of the Lord you are not a supplanter you are not the deceiver and when we receive the Revelation keep on liing it was the evence then he received the revelation of who he was there must always be a change amen not by your own struggle because if you struggle to become who you are you will fail right but just humble ourselves in the presence of the Lord Lord help me just reveal to you reveal to me who you are amen and I can humble myself Lead Me Lord all the days of my life amen [Music] hallelujah the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the will come for whether you like it or not that's right you will come for because this is the Harvest Time that gaing all the seed of God whether you want to run go run amen but God will yes sir true remember Jonah he was trying to run from the presence of God he has the right decision he has the right thinking because he if go to the Nineveh he will be persecuted he has the right thought so he went to thus yes but remember when God created in the Book of Genesis God created a whale the Book of Genesis yes is what do you think it was an accident that created a whale of all the pieces that men can eat when he created a whale because that whale was prepared for Jonah when he comes when he manifest amen everything that comes our way God already prepared everything for amen that's why we said the lamb was slain before the foundation of the word amen who is who is the who who is first The Sinner or the Savior right first is the savior he already prepared a way before we came born that's why Jonah before he decided to go to Tarsus God already prepar a whale in fact that whale was already prepared in the Book of Genesis for 4,000 years or maybe 2,000 years it's a long way but God already prepared so you cannot run away from the program of God that's 400 years God already prepared a whale that when the time comes that Jonah will decide to go against the word of God the whale was already prepared to bring him to where God wants him to be that's why don't run away from God you will just experience misery despair Temptation anxiety depression but just humble yourself in the presence of God lord it seems that I cannot make it but you promise to be with me help me Lord humble myself praise God Lead Me Lord and I believe your word even I cannot understand I cannot explain it but I believe your word 100% that whatever you said you will accomplish or else you will never be called God right right amen amen that's what make him God because he keep his word what a blessed people we are I think our time is to to to short let us stand or to our feet I request our musician so this is just to encourage you amen the time has come that God send the message to Quicken whatever seed you are in right now whether you like or not God is so gracious to let you know who you [Music] are don't look at your shortcomings don't look at your circumstances in life you've been in the message quite a long time and that is not by yourself it was the grace of God exended you can never be this far it's not by the grace of God hallelujah am even in my Ministry I've been Pastor for five five years then I realized I'm not called to be a pastor so I decided to be a simple Layman and I thought to myself well to be a minister and to be a Layman is we we can still receive the same reward why should I sacrifice myself spend so much time uh asking God what what to preach that's why I always respect a pastor it takes a lot of time effort dedication to seek the mind of God right amen the sermon is not just to to praise him oh he has a good sermon no the word of God was inspired put in his Minister's heart that is for the people it's not for himself but it's for you and me yes amen and that word sometimes that we which we can benefit out from it because the message is not for ours but for you and sometimes we prepare a sermon and we can preach sometimes our sermon as it was inspired by the word of God by your help God will turn our thoughts right Amen to minister to its needs that's why every Gathering is a supernatural Gathering we may not know what's the leading of the Holy Spirit but if we yield he can minister to your needs because God is sharper than two edged George you know the thoughts of your heart the intent of your heart he knows each and everyone's needs amen amen I decided not to to minister anymore my great to the US and stay brother on church and just be a simple Believers and he asked me can you preach for us no brother I'm sorry but I cannot preach because my English is is no good there's a lot of brothers here white brothers that have a desire to preach so just excuse me because I I I I I'm already satisfied with being a lay man he asked me three times and I said no just give it to them but then I have a burden for the brother in Philippines I know I I will never pre again but I have decide I'd bring brother Ron there to preach for them and brother Ron said that I will not go to the Philippines because there's already a lot of ministers coming in coming in and I don't want to go where all the ministers are going and I told him just go to my hometown because the ministers are just stuck in in Manila in Theon there's so many churches and mostly of the ministry cannot go to my hometown so it's another Province you need to fly by by plane for 1 hour and they said okay I we go there's not so much minutes coming in so we went there and he share and was so blessed then the next time I told him we would go again in Manila so during the time of Manila it was a convention and uh he was so sick that he was given three kinds of antibiotic but it never help him then he said but Mario Can You Preach for for me so I have no I cannot say no because we are caught up in that situation said okay anyway I don't have any problem because it was my own language so it's okay so when I preach after that the service and the spirit of God moved and said brother Mar I want you to preach in my in my church when we go back home and when I heard that I was so nervous that in my thought I decide I will not go back to the US and when we arve in the state he is announcing oh maybe we can try some of the brothers here and I keep on pray Lord please let brother Ron forget what he's told me Lord but then we cannot run away from our time has come that he persuade me to preach and he said brother you know when I was a deacon in our church my pastor also told me to preach and every time he told me to preach I was so nervous that I come to the point that even vomited because of my nervousness and my pastor told me I don't okay if you bang it in the pet I want you to preach and it gives me a parable okay so I cannot run away from this even though I say I'm not good in English but he's trying to persuade me to preach and I told him okay just pray for me and I preached during that time Mother's Day May 10th of 19 or 2010 and I preached and by God's grace uh I make it to the end and after the the service it was brother Aon McGary you know him so he went right ahead to the office and he said brother Mario I was so blessed by your preaching that the question in my heart for how many years it was answered through your preaching amen I told to praise the Lord and was not me brother it was God himself that's why we cannot run away from our calling we cannot run away if we are a seed of God God Will Make A Way for that seed to manifest so God bless you this morning he trust that it will encourage you to keep on moving we have a promise if we cannot make it this in this earth we still have a place where we can meet one this day keep on moving just like Enoch was keep on moving in the light of the hour that he was amen there is a lot of Temptation and immorality around him but he keep on moving and the scripture said he keep on walking yes amen hallelujah walking there must be an action every time God revealed to you something don't heal the don't doubt it just keep on walking just keep on walking Keep On Walking until the scripture and he was found now right because he was raptured the same thing will happen if the Rapture comes tomorrow just keep on moving if you have a plan to get married and the rupture you know that the rupture will come just go on with your with your praise God with your plan right and you cannot hinder the Rapture said you must be so holy you must be this and be no just walk in the life that was God Amen he don't count about about our failures because God who is in your heart if you if you commit mistake the inside teacher will be the one to remind you that you are wrong you may correct this because I believe if you're a real Christian you will humble yourself and be corrected and be stand corrected amen but if you are not you will go against the word of God you may heard a lot of sermon being chastisement amen but you are here have you wondered why you are here it was God keeping you so walk in the light as Enoch walk in the light and one of these days you will found you will found you just keep if you have plan plan as if God will come 100 years but live as if he will be coming tomorrow let's bow our head most loving gracious Heavenly
