[0:04] my mind but it's not just been a song

[0:12] important in life is knowing Jesus
[0:15] and I know our pastor has been talking
[0:17] about
[0:18] how he has been
[0:20] focused on drawing closer to God
[0:23] and that's been my
[0:26] my aim and my objective as well and I've
[0:28] seen God
[0:29] work out some
[0:31] wonderful things
[0:33] just to show me that if I could draw
[0:35] closer to him then
[0:37] it will manifest himself more and I just

[4:53] I was really wavering on what whether to
[4:55] sing this song or not tonight giving
[4:57] them a bit out of breath and tired
[5:00] um but I've been um having this song on
[5:03] my mind um especially as we've been
[5:05] talking about the uh
[5:07] the conduct of children in the last
[5:09] couple Wednesdays the pastor preaching
[5:11] about all of that
[5:13] um and I remember the teaching of the
[5:15] Lord Jesus Christ saying uh very Legacy
[5:18] unto you
[5:19] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[5:21] of God as a little child he shall not
[5:24] enter bearing and there's this old song
[5:27] old old song that we used to sing
[5:30] um you will always be a child
[5:32] in my eyes so it's not really a special
[5:34] song So if you know it please sing with
[5:36] me tonight
